Gettin' Wise,Brassy,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38613d1975652138ae1/1:1/w_160/1959708b.jpg,2004-01-07 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/917-gettin-wise/,BeggarsWiiija,"If archeologists were to one day peruse the voluminous crates of Brassy reviews over the last three years, they would uncover a lot of first sentences that tell readers how vocalist Muffin is Jon Spencer's sister. It's true that we reviewers are lethargic cretins opposed to thinking of actual criticisms, but the real reason everyone's compelled to state this relationship is that Muffin has so little going for her, it just seems like we can give her a reprieve by bringing someone else into the review for a minute. It's like that old ""how would it feel to be Jesus' sibling?"" joke. Of course, Jon Spencer is barely the Son of Pussy Galore, let alone God. Suffice to say, when Jesus rolls out his blues explosion, you better all be packing heat. As for Brassy, well, put it like this: If you are Brassy, please don't read the rest of this review. It's rarely a good sign when the best track on an album is a 30-second sample of some 50s pop standard. Anyone who's ever heard a 50s pop standard knows that could not possibly be a compliment of anything on this CD. Anything that was obliquely, lingeringly entertaining about 2000's Got It Made is thrown on the ground here, disparaged, defiled, and left for dead. It is admittedly significantly more hip-hop-inspired than its predecessor's cauldron of spaz-pop, echo chambers, creepy psychopathic narcissism, and lyrics that all but defined the word ""stoopid."" This is not saying much. Lest the genre of hip-hop is at all familiar to you, let it quickly be noted that the hip-hop inflections here are the same ones present on Limp Bizkit's newest album. I doubt there's a more incompetent DJ in the entire western hemisphere than DJ Swett. His contribution to his own band's songs is tantamount to what DJ Shadow contributes to the average Tito Puente album: effectively nothing. To dispel with the task at hand in the most harmless way possible: ""Hit 'Em Hard"", ""Mine"", ""Feeling Sorry"", ""Dus'"", and ""Where Did You Get That Funk?"", and, okay, almost every other song on this album, all have some cliched wah-wahing funk guitar that's kind of interesting in its absurd banality until it becomes apparent that there's usually nothing else accompanying them-- for, on average, four minutes straight of our lives. Occasionally, pop/punk guitar bursts will punctuate the meandering attempts at making people ""hit 'em hard"" or ""shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie"" (yes, this is actually repeated in a song) or ""still stealin' when we come to the stage"" or whatever other nonsensical stream-of-boredom choruses get tossed into the mix. The most unique offering is ""1-0-0"" and this is primarily because it centers itself around a two-note keyboard line and mindless reverbed vocals that, maybe, grasp at some sort of jazz singing amidst the typical Jon Spencer-style egomania, smugness, and vain disco-rapping. For some point of comparison in terms of sheer pillaging, uniformity, and tedium, I'm going to go with that Jamiroquai song off the Godzilla soundtrack, except I at least liked the bass on that song the first few times I heard it. In the aim of balance, it can be claimed that ""Mine""'s beat is sort of fascinating in the same way tumbling kitchenware is. Kettles, ambience, radio static, and studio echoing permeates a lot of the mixes, but they're superfluous layers done better elsewhere. The lyric about ""my unfettered flow"" was briefly amusing. Poor imitations of trip-hop are distributed through a handful of tracks seemingly only to ensure listeners know this group can hollowly duplicate a few more sounds. And to quietly appreciate aspects of one song, ""Still Stealing"" has a guitar riff as dismembered and discombobulating as P. Diddy's ""Bad Boy for Life"". Whether you think these aspects are enough to warrant interest in this album is up to you. But they shouldn't be. Perhaps if you're really into dancing, to the neglect of all intelligence and taste, you could find one or two songs to enjoy here. For the rest of us, let's forget this whole family and move on with our lives.

Here Comes That Weird Chill,Mark Lanegan,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9dc0084474cd0c2b1b/1:1/w_160/ce312184.gif,2004-01-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4678-here-comes-that-weird-chill/,Beggars Banquet,"Fact is, I can attribute little more than the confluence of personal ignorance and journalistic negligence to the fact that I had, until now, predominantly associated Mark Lanegan's name with his work as the frontman of Screaming Trees. I had mistakenly and categorically written him off as a splintered postscript by-product of the necessary dissolution of Seattle's overindulgent early 90s scene, that is, until recently exploring a good chunk of his back catalog and this, Here Comes That Weird Chill, his most recent solo release. Granted, the post-departure travails of the driving forces behind such rusted vehicles as Dinosaur Jr. and Soundgarden surely contaminated my expectations, but I wouldn't say they had ritually poisoned me to bar acceptance of artistic redefinition within their sphere. So, then, what flowers may bloom from the northwest doorway? Read on, Chris Cornell. For these eight, brief snapshots of Lanegan's vitality-- a mini-LP featuring one finished song and assorted outtakes from his forthcoming Beggars Banquet debut-- he's dropped much of the southern folk and acoustic blues of his previous solo releases, giving way to a muddier, more driven sound. A highlight, ""Wish You Well"" exemplifies Lanegan's ability to grittily belie a gorgeous base melody with layers of guitar and droning tones from organs, looped noise and synths. Above the mix rest his vocals, which are best served when he deploys a low-down, brash Waits-ian husk, as on ""Lexington Slowdown"", and are contextually masterful when he plays the role of a confessional journeyman. Past the midway point of the album, ""Lexington Slowdown"" marks the first time a lucid piano rings beneath his growling sing/speak, dichotomously playing up the role of his pipes above a mirthfully ponderous piano lilt. A gospel-infused chorus then enters, but with such subtlety as to merely excuse its presence. Other than this, the rest of the material grinds on through low-level electric guitar and random, elemental scattershot accompaniment. Settle down, J Mascis. But his ability to consistently deliver dirty, linear melodies without too-soon drying the well is the biggest feather in Lanegan's cap. ""Methamphetamine Blues"" (the ""single,"" as it were) begins the album with an industrial assembly-line percussive element, hitting like tormented anvils on sparking steel, but never flies loose; rather, it flits along with a dirty persistence. ""Message to Mine"" does reel away for a moment of churning swamp-rock, but gently haunts its way into the spin before dying off to Lanegan's plea, ""Baby/ It's good/ So good/ It's gonna make me forget/ Forget myself again."" His delivery is so artfully persuasive and soulfully wrought. And it's all so sleazy that this backwoods poetry reads like Dylan Thomas under all the murk and dirt and scum. Lanegan manages to pack down layers of sonic dirt on each track here, but it's all so deftly wound that the songs never feel anything but linear and reserved, even for all the action. The lone acoustic moment is employed as a launch pad for the electric guitar machine-gun rendering of ""Skeletal History"", which tightly jams on after a brief reprieve, but never relentlessly so. He also offers a cover of Captain Beefheart's ""Clear Spot"", which he manages to slime up and slither unnoticeably between his original pieces. Lanegan is the brand of artist who can make a home in any camp, and, as he proves on this stormy release-- in any weather. Watch your back, Mark Eitzel.",,7.6,
"Love Is Hell, Pts. 1 & 2",Ryan Adams,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a001ea9e61561daa447f/1:1/w_160/a70a8958.gif,2004-01-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/41-love-is-hell-pts-1-2/,Lost Highway,"If anyone out there is still wondering just how Ryan Adams can be so prolific, maybe it's because the urgency of his situation compels him to strike while the iron is hot. It took his former band, Whiskeytown, seven years to release a trio of critically revered albums, and his first solo record, 2000's Heartbreaker, was in the works for half that. But when Heartbreaker saw release, and was promptly met with virtually unanimous critical praise, Adams clearly became inspired and quickly turned out sixteen new tracks for a sophomore record-- the rushed, overproduced Gold-- which came with a bonus disc sporting five tracks in the more stripped vein of the album's predecessor. And when that album scored Adams a commercial alternative radio hit in the well-timed ""New York, New York"", he descended into a recording fervor that continues, unabated, to this day. Irrational outbursts and public meltdowns aside, Adams is, at heart, an extremely gifted songwriter who just doesn't realize that what he really needs is to take a deep breath and slow the fuck down. During the course of the past two years, he's released a collection of demos (Demolition), and a 21-track side project called The Finger with ex-D Generation frontman Jesse Malin (the ""double-album"" We Are Fuck You/Punk's Dead Let's Fuck). He's currently planning a box set titled Career Ender, which will be crammed with five discs of the songs he's discarded since Gold dropped two years ago. And that's not even taking into account the four-tracked blues version of The Strokes' album Is This It that he's said to have recorded. Did I mention his collaborations with Beth Orton and Emmylou Harris? How about the track he co-wrote for the Counting Crows? His session work with Lucinda Williams and Alejandro Escovedo? His production work on Jesse Malin's solo album? I think you get the point. The question is: why doesn't he? Adams originally intended Love Is Hell as his official third full-length, but his label, Lost Highway, scoffed when he handed in the tapes. Initially, he planned to rework it, but then agreed to dashing off a glossy, radio-friendlier full-length (the disasterous Rock N Roll), provided the label would also make room on their release schedule for a secondary release for Love Is Hell. It's easy to see why Lost Highway balked: an insincere, smugly posturing Ryan Adams who lives up to his stage persona by creating an album like Rock N Roll simply had to have been preferable to the miserable, slobbering woe-is-me shtick he plays up here. At least when he was wearing the proverbial alt-country tag, his balancing act of conceitedness and overemoting was halfway convincing. Unfortunately, just as the caricature-laden excesses of Rock N Roll aped garage-rockers and postmortem Rock Hall of Famers, Love Is Hell reaches for the dripping, maudlin sentimentality of Rufus Wainwright or a mock Jeff Buckley. It's a shock, given that the press surrounding the Love Is Hell sessions had pegged the record as Adams' return to the sparse, two-in-the-morning flair of his debut-- and when Lost Highway postponed the recordings, calling them ""too dark,"" it only heightened the expectations of optimistic fans hoping for a stark, brooding future classic. Of course, it did seem something of an enigma as well: Adams' music, after all, had always faired best with pared-down arrangements making room for his own brand of confessional singer/songwriter groveling (e.g. Heartbreaker standouts ""Call Me on Your Way Back Home"" and ""Come Pick Me Up""); shelving Ryan Adams for being too dark seemed to make about as much sense as shelving Kraftwerk for being too German. But while it's safe to say that these EPs are certainly dark-- at least in contrast to Rock N Roll and even parts of Gold-- they fail to capture the striking imagery and confident vocals of which Adams seemed a master on Heartbreaker. For example, Love Is Hell's opening, piano-led ""Political Scientist"", replaces Adams' confessional, first-person narratives with a third-person tale that indicts the government for supplying cocaine, and candy factories for poisoning the environment. Conspiracy theories aside, playing Greenpeace spokesman is not Adams' strong suit; he attempts the political profundity of a Thom Yorke and comes off like a diet Chris Martin. And if Adams fails to adopt Yorke's political relevance, he'll settle for the Radiohead frontman's melismatics-- Love Is Hell is riddled with Adams' unabashed aping of Yorke's signature fragmented lyrical style. On the lethargic lite-country stomp of ""This House Is Not for Sale"", Adams repeatedly pleads, ""Calm down/ Just calm down,"" the emotional resonance of which verges on laughable. Meanwhile, the sleepy, acoustic blather of ""Afraid Not Scared"" has Adams repeatedly confessing that he is ""really dying in here,"" and just wants to be ""let down,"" sounding about as genuinely distraught as Ja Rule sounds genuinely ""gangsta."" The eight songs that constitute Love Is Hell, Pt. 1 seem intentionally built around a studio version of Adams' infamous live staple, a cover of the Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"". Acclaimed Smiths producer John Porter unfortunately buries Adams beneath a sobering wall of reverb, which drains the song of its spirited pop ingenuity and transforms its nonsensical lyrics into some sort of momentous, self-important dirge. Consequently, ""Wonderwall"" seems emblematic of the rest of the disc, a collection of preposterously cheerless (and charmless) songs that try much too hard to achieve a poignancy-- or anything, really-- that might hide their complete insignificance. As Love Is Hell, Pt. 1 resoundingly proves, Adams is at his finest when he sticks to the subject matter he knows best: broken hearts and bar fights. Given this, it's no shock that the highlight of this entire project comes with the Dylanesque Beth Orton kiss-off ""English Girls Approximately"". Appearing halfway into Love Is Hell, Pt. 2, the song is classic Adams, brimming with his smug wit (sample lyric: ""You said you didn't love me, it was right on time/ I was just about to tell you, but ok, alright"") and unabashed, acoustic guitar-driven ecstasy. As Marianne Faithful lends her austere vocal harmonies to the chorus, it serves as a breathtaking reminder of the chemistry Adams shared with Emmylou Harris on Heartbreaker's divine ballad, ""Oh, My Sweet Carolina"". Another highlight of Love Is Hell, Pt. 2 is its closing R&B; vamp, ""Chelsea Nights"". Over a bed of radiating Wurlitzer chords and bluesy guitar fills, Adams narrates a night spent aimlessly wandering New York City's unfeeling winter streets, searching for the love he always manages to lose. The track, which peaks with Adams' plaintive confession, ""I played your song/ I got the melody all wrong,"" is filled with the self-awareness, irony, and despondency that's made Adams' best work so moving, all the way back to his Whiskeytown days; it's a shame he forces his listeners to wade through a glut of unsalvageable crap-rock to arrive at it. Indeed, these two tracks are anomalies-- happy accidents, or moments of clarity-- amongst the overbearing melodrama of the bulk of material contained on Love Is Hell, Pt. 2. ""Thank You Louise"" serves as the harrowing antithesis to these diamonds in the rough, an atrocious slice of sloppy sentimentality in which Adams sings, over an unnecessarily bloated string section, of a mother receiving news of her son's death. For a guy who's attained uncommon levels of infamy by simply being a sarcastic fucking prick all the time, he pours on the schmaltz here like he studied under Air Supply. The Joy Division rip-off ""City Rain, City Streets"" is so bereft of any humor that its megalomania challenges even Conor Oberst: Adams crams nearly four minutes of distorted new-wave guitars and gratuitous reverb into this shudder-inducing display of shamelessness, proudly spouting disasters like, ""I fucked you over a million times,"" and, ""You died, you died, you really died."" Listening to these discs, one can only imagine the myriad reasons Lost Highway decided to release the Love Is Hell sessions not as one spiraling, abysmal full-length, but as a pair of EPs (let alone why they shelved it to make way for Rock N Roll instead). The obvious, cynical answer is that it wouldn't detract from the publicity they were expecting Rock N Roll to receive. But it's also easy to envision the label's creative heads considering how spreading the material out might help conceal the songs' alarmingly empty sentiments. The sad fact is, no marketing strategy, no matter how savvy, could conceal this collection's bathetic, overwrought travesties and gruesome failures. In the midst of this mess, both Adams and Lost Highway come out losers: one critical car-wreck might have been manageable, but they may not recover from two.","If anyone out there is still wondering just how Ryan Adams can be so prolific, maybe it's because the ...

"Now, More Than Ever",Jim Guthrie,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfd7abf31b7dc7156384/1:1/w_160/002481b1.gif,2004-01-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3613-now-more-than-ever/,Three Gut,"Conjure this portrait: a skinny, corduroy-clad kid, folded up on his or her childhood bedspread, picking at a cheap acoustic guitar and clicking awkward beats into an oversized laptop, red-faced and breathless with the notion of original creation. If nothing else, the image of the humble bedroom troubadour is one of the greatest equalizers in pop music: almost every successful musician started somewhere, cramped, goofy, and cross-legged on beige carpet. The trick is knowing when to bundle up your gear, inch down the hallway, and creep cautiously out the front door to broaden your scope, your skills, and your means. Having bravely abandoned the scrappy pings and whistles of his Playstation-heavy solo debut, Royal City's Jim Guthrie has finally dragged his guitar out into the open, opting to indulge in some bold studio bluster and multi-instrumental antics for his latest release, the fulsome Now, More Than Ever. Fulfilling the promise of his last full-length, 2002's Morning Noon Night, Guthrie's new album proves he can successfully scramble up the lo-fi ladder without sacrificing any of his quirky charm. The disc, in fact, marks a unique moment of catharsis for the songwriter; Jim Guthrie has left the bedroom. It's tricky to address Guthrie's maturation without unintentionally belittling his earlier work; 2000's A Thousand Songs was hasty, skittish, and alarmingly energetic, its moments of idiosyncratic brilliance often overshadowed by self-referential giggles. Now, More Than Ever is hardly glossed to perfection (there are still a handful of broken plates, squeaky tiles, and toys exploding in the background), but it nonetheless provides a slightly more substantial pedestal for Guthrie's getting-stronger-by-the-second songwriting. The record's approach is docile, but its impact is immediate: this is an album packed with gorgeous, intricate pop songs, carried by Guthrie's plaintive whispers and delicate strums. With a battalion of able players backing him up (check the impeccable string swells here, lovingly arranged by Owen Pallett of Toronto's Hidden Cameras, or the shimmering banjo shakes on ""Problems with Solutions"", carefully played by The Constantines' Bry Webb), Guthrie's songs occasionally evoke the versatile billowing of Sufjan Stevens, or the Byrds-ish croon of The Clientele. ""All Gone"" shudders open with a chorus of yawning, suspense-heavy strings, each nervous yelp bending back in favor of a soft melody and Guthrie's obtuse poetics (""The forest needs the fire/ Like the fire needs the tree/ Can you make something out of nothing?""). ""So Small"" is a loping, unpretentious rumination on mortality, gently layered over bleating horns, jangly piano, and a nervously plucked violin. For most of this record, subtle apprehension rules: despite its perfectly established prettiness, an unspoken anxiety still hovers, each careful arrangement belying a strange urgency-- meticulously bowed violins descend into feedback-heavy outburts, stretches of calm somersault into chaos. These kinds of dualities pervade the album; Now, More Than Ever is both hushed and sprawling, serene and agitated, jumpy and constant. Even if the phrase ""Canadian indie pop"" rouses your skeptical, hype-resistant scowl from its post-New Years snooze, the lush, orchestral puffs of Now, More Than Ever should prove undeniable: Jim Guthrie's sweet, fertile pop deserves all the praise it gets.","Conjure this portrait: a skinny, corduroy-clad kid, folded up on his or her childhood bedspread, picking at a cheap acoustic ...

Things Viral,Khanate,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc27ea9e61561daa73f2/1:1/w_160/b8a30bbb.jpg,2004-01-07 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4567-things-viral/,Southern Lord,"Khanate play so. Fucking. Slowly. Their ""extreme doom"" descends from grinding to just plain labored. They plug in their amps like they're too tired to breathe, their hands hit their instruments like hundred pound weights. The drummer plays like he's falling limp on the kit. Total silence mires the noise and swallows all hope. Only one of them doesn't go down for the count, and that's singer Alan Dubin. The band makes a fierce rumble, to be sure-- Stephen O'Malley's repeating, laudanum AC/DC riffs chime like burnt-out church bells, and James Plotkin will make your subwoofer moan like a masturbating whale; but the drone-noise-metal cascades hang back in a fog while Dubin gets the spotlight. He makes a soliloquy of shrieks and agitation. At turns drowning in a swamp, then shrieking as shrilly as if his throat were pinned open, Dubin protests and wails, vanishing for minutes then coming back at full volume. He lingers over lyrics and then garbles others (""pockets"" sounds like ""sockets,"" or ""fuck it""); wails high like our generation's other great existential hero-- Peter Jackson's Gollum-- then rasps back to the mists. It wouldn't work if the band didn't stand firm against him. Between the stern music and Dubin's ejaculations lies the existential dilemma: he's struggling without a hope for release, he's mired in conflict but can't picture an end. Dubin fights without advancing a step, and he can't stop fighting even though he has nothing to show for it. Even the music's few peaks fall into thuds instead of blowing into catharsis. It's empty outrage: they're a Sisyphus that can't budge the stone. With an hour of music divided into just four tracks, the tempo crawls-- it's even slower, and darker, than their self-titled debut. It forces you to obsess over every overtone in O'Malley's guitar, every rip in Dubin's larynx. It's reminiscent of some of Stephen King's stories-- not the horror ones, but the stories that take you through a drawn-out process: digging a car-sized pit in the baking desert sun, or crawling around the ledge of an office building. Khanate have that skill for unfolding an action in such excruciating detail that you're slowly edged off your seat. But in this case there's no resolution, aside from an uptick of squealing discordance and a buzzing electronic noise that ushers out the record. Things Viral is extreme enough to appeal to people who don't have any interest in metal; the members cross metal pedigrees with noise-drone-art-damage bands-- from Burning Witch and Old, to Sunn 0))), to Blind Idiot God's Tim Wyskida on drums. It's committed but not overbearing, too resolute and unyielding to resist; it'll grab your skull and hold you achingly still as it thrashes through the depths, then totally, quietly wears itself out.","Khanate play so.

Coral Fang,The Distillers,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb62c0084474cd0c2846/1:1/w_160/03dd0b1f.jpg,2004-01-06 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2537-coral-fang/,SireWarner Bros.,"It's unfairly easy to play the crotchety, old-guard punk in an era when even The Offspring can manage to garner esteem for ""keeping punk alive"" merely by sucking for ten years running. ""Everything's so goddamned obligatory!"" cries the punk relic. ""The sound, the look, the act-- time was, this whole thing used to be about standing apart, not blending in!"" And it was, for about a day, until Richard Hell ostensibly wore a ripped t-shirt onstage and finally gave everyone a consensus-cool role model (if only 'cause most of them couldn't pull off the Dolls' drag, or Reed's arrogance). Sure, the great bands still beat a few divergent paths even if they all ended at the same idealistic destination, and to be fair, no one too far under 40 can know the exact feeling of starvation and heroin addiction in the Bowery circa 1973 or water-rationing in England, but neither did most of the bondage-clad horde back then, either. It's the nature of a trend: only a few people are allowed to drive-- the rest are along for the ride. I realize that punk rock's own Trail of Tears is a long road to travel just for me to lead up to The Distillers (but here we are)-- doubly so because I'm about to ask you to disregard all of it. I only mention it because that specter of some sort of ideal or credibility is inescapable. Still, for all the talk of parallels between Hole/Nirvana and Brodie Dalle's Distillers/ex-husband Tim Armstrong's Rancid, all the willful categorization, all the thousand-times-old liberty spikes, chains, and piercings, The Distillers have created one hell of a rock album-- and it doesn't purport to be anything more. Coral Fang impresses not just by some nebulous ""punk"" standards, but by the standards of just about anyone who wants to be rocked gently out of sleep by the dulcet tones of thrashing guitars, pogo-friendly love songs, and possibly the most compellingly forceful female punk vocals since Exene Cervenka wailed her way out of the nihilistic abyss that cartographers call ""L.A."" Here, technical ability takes a back seat to frantic blasts of distortion and mechanical percussion like a metronome powered by the Hoover Dam. Though far from a three-chord wonder, Coral Fang doesn't fall far from a typically SoCal sound-- the chord changes aren't rocket science, but the rhythms are fast and the fills are rare, quick and poisonous. From the lonely start/stop build of ""The Hunger"", to the jackhammer assaults and beautifully harmonized choruses of ""Coral Fang"" or ""Die on a Rope"", the album's range is strictly textbook material, albeit with some uncommonly effective production. With surprising consistency, The Distillers come off like a cross between X at their most incomparably, beautifully raw and the greased-up melodies of an angry Rocket from the Crypt. But this is really Brodie Dalle's show; her razor-cut cords are the bastard product of Mike Ness and Exene Cervenka, and from the sound of things, they could possibly go on to rule the world if sufficiently provoked. Anyone who lifted a hand to champion Karen O as some symbol of modern empowerment in rock music, take note, because Dalle is everything Karen isn't: an impassioned, powerful frontwoman, the legitimate heart of her band, and probably the most dominating female presence-at-large (read: receiving M2 rotation) in rock right now. Not that she has much competition, apart from O and maybe plastic surgery disaster Courtney Love, but if the field were increased tenfold, I'd still like her odds. She has a wearied depth and subtlety in her voice that lends genuine weight to what otherwise might seem merely passable punk anthems, and a charm and vulnerability that carries more conviction and authenticity than caricature-- which is an almost unspeakably rare trait for someone who opens her record shouting, ""All my friends are murderers."" Dalle gives Coral Fang what may be best described as a sense of near-maturity. It's an earnest call among the crowd of would-be voices of youth in carefully controlled and marketed revolt, but also provides a hint of the adolescent sense that real revolt is a logical means to an end. It panders to that angst-ridden vibe somewhat, alternately flexing and wallowing, but it's ultimately forgivable; as long as a kid dreams of smashing the system while struggling to balance equations before homeroom, there'll be a need for this. The classically retarded, album-ending storm of outro chaos raises the sense of gratuity a little higher, but not as much as so, so many have in the past-- like Rancid, or Bad Religion, or even the Sex Pistols, say. ""Wait, what the hell are you doing coming back to 'punk rock?' Isn't this, like, not about that stuff?"" An astute question, friend (cue music for the sappy resolution, and fight back the tears, kids-- I'll keep the after-school special brief). I don't know, maybe the punk ""ideal"" of pure individualism passed rock by for bands like Liars, or for Kevin Drumm, or any number of other artists who are really unburdened by the need for critical or popular success, even if they sometimes get it. But if simply knowing Coral Fang rocks exceptionally hard isn't enough, I'll say this: die-hard ""punk as fuck""-ers can (and likely will) easily find reason to cry themselves to sleep on their badass spiked-leather pillows, and The Distillers might not be able to spot a new idea with the Hubble, and no one will single-handedly save any faltering genre anytime soon, and even with that ""punk"" stigma looming large... Coral Fang is still a proud achievement.","It's unfairly easy to play the crotchety, old-guard punk in an era when even The Offspring can manage to ...

Everyone Alive Wants Answers,Colleen,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f1c0084474cd0c0aad/1:1/w_160/98333ba7.jpg,2004-01-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1743-everyone-alive-wants-answers/,Leaf,"It's often the case that making up a biography for an artist turns out to be much more rewarding than the truth. To that end, I'm going to start writing this review before I do the obligatory background research on the mystery that is Colleen, frightened as I am to be let down by the actual story behind this group/band/woman/entity. Everyone Alive Wants Answers is one of those albums that has me quick-drawing on the ""unlike anything I've heard"" cliché, a curious album that catches my pop-oriented fancy even though it's clearly more Dominique or Richard-San territory. The cue cards read ""glacial"" and ""ambient,"" but I'd rather make up my own interpretation. The opening, self-titled track is, appropriately, a thesis statement of the record's approach, cutting in abruptly with a ragged-edged loop of what sounds like a harp played with a sharp rock. Loops like these are the foundation of Colleen's unusual sound, though to call them loops is pretty much a technical overstatement; more accurately, they'd be called skips. If Oval made music by meticulously scratching compact discs, Colleen's compositions appear to manifest themselves out of vinyl scratches, the repetitions coming less from ProTools Ctrl+V-ing than from a stylus sentenced to trace the same groove forever. Many tracks add instrumentation of some sort over these backdrops, like the title song, which features soloing that sounds like an octopus tuning a piano in double time. Others add layers of malfunctioning records to build atmosphere like a slowcore DJ, ""Ritournelle"" weaving ellipses of soft vibraphone, eternally swelling strings, and dust particle crackles into an Elfman-esque score that's equal parts creepy and fantastical. Colleen's attic toybox seems bottomless: ""One Night and It's Gone"" has a ""bassline"" crafted from different tones of static hiss, ""Nice and Simple"" features a chorus of music boxes, while ""Long Live Mice in the Metro"" incorporates backwards tweaking and heavily treated effects without sacrificing organic warmth. Chances are, there are modern compositional precedents for all of these sounds-- hell, some of them have modern Björk-asitional precedents even I've heard before. And while Everyone Alive Wants Answers is most definitely top-heavy, hitting its peak with the first two songs and losing focus as the rough-edged loops make fewer appearances, at 39 minutes it ends before one's iPod finger gets itchy. Thirteen tracks wrapped in a reassuring blanket of fuzz, it's the perfect headphones soundtrack to a bus ride through ultraviolet city snow. Turns out Colleen is, in fact, a she, though it's a she confusingly named Cecile, and she's from Paris, which explains some of the exoticism. Instruments reported include glockenspiel, cello, Melodica, and music box, with nary an octopus to be seen. The truth is only a slight disappointment (at least it's not another unshaven guy with a Powerbook and a fiber-optic light show) but a letdown nonetheless, though it's no fair fight pitting actual biography against my commute-time imaginings in this post-liner notes age-- an age that suits Everyone Alive Wants Answers, one of those rare, truly evocative abstract pieces of art where every observer takes away their own interpretation, and is left feeling a little more special about their experience as a result.","It's often the case that making up a biography for an artist turns out to be much more rewarding ...

Major Fables,Lot Six,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd66eb335119a49ece8a/1:1/w_160/f4479a52.jpg,2004-01-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4870-major-fables/,Tarantula,"I'm not exactly sure why, but it's been a damn long time since I just sat back and enjoyed a balls-out rock record. For some reason, mingling with heavy riffage and wild drum fills just didn't seem that appealing last year. But absence, as they say, makes the heart grow fonder, and lately I've been craving rock with an ""a"" and a ""w"" in doses far greater than I can ever remember. Enter Major Fables, the third album from Boston quintet The Lot Six. Packing raw throats, a triple-guitar phalanx and several more beats per minute than your average rockers, The Lot Six manage to merge punk rage and energy with classic rock flair that does away with prefixes and pretense and gets right to the point. ""Autobrats"" bucks its way out of the gate with a crusty but melodic riff and flails like mad for 3\xBD minutes, lead vocalist David Vicini vigorously contributing more mass to the polyps that no doubt coat his vocal cords by now. Blasts of fuzzy bass face off against whirling, skritchy guitars that nod to Fugazi and Drive Like Jehu on ""No UFO's"", which also has drummer Lawrence Sinclair royally abusing his toms in the spastically shouted chorus. It's not all wild hammer-ons and buzzsaw axe interplay, though, as some funky tack piano finds its way into ""I Was You"" courtesy of guitarist Julian Cassanetti, who also handles trombone on the song. The track bounces through its verses, Vicini trading his shout for a wayward croon and then trading it back for some outlandish outbursts on the chorus. ""X-Rayted"" bursts with three-chord Kinks riffs, and Vicini goes totally Ian MacKaye on us on ""Out of Control"" with his wildly shouted refrain of, ""Ordinary everyday people ought to stay that way."" Things only really slow down twice on Major Fables-- once for the pastiche country of ""My Baby's Gone"", which comes complete with closing time harmonies and a bit of slide guitar from Apollo Sunshine's Sam Cohen; and once again for the more ambitious and less tongue-in-cheek ""Go to Sleep"", whose slow-motion ska groove is damn tedious. Which is unfortunate, because these guys do some of their best work at their most ambitious; last year's Animals is still their best album precisely because it aimed high. Major Fables may be more focused and consistent, but it's also less compelling as a result. That the band appears to be retreating here from a more expansive approach is a shame. Still, this album is a taut blast of muscle-bound rock with enough brains to lodge a bevy of splintered riffs and shouted hooks in yours. When the bone-headed punk of closer ""Die Polizei"" ends things on a ragged, delirious note, it puts the cap on a satisfyingly rough-and-tumble collection of songs that, while failing to constitute a masterpiece, will nonetheless give your adrenal glands a swift kick.","I'm not exactly sure why, but it's been a damn long time since I just sat back and ...

The Essential Bruce Springsteen,Bruce Springsteen,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64cea9e61561daa532f/1:1/w_160/28f4b4b5.jpg,2004-01-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7727-the-essential-bruce-springsteen/,Columbia,"It's been a long time since Springsteen has been hip, if he ever was. His coolness was in question even back in the '70s, despite the grudging thumbs-up (""Springsteen is all right"") Lou Reed gave him on the live album Take No Prisoners. The aging population that loves ""real rock 'n' roll"" are his biggest supporters, from rock critic turned producer/manager Jon Landau through biographer Dave Marsh and on down. If Springsteen partied with Warhol, the photos are rarely anthologized. Springsteen is neither glamorous nor mysterious, but as this three-disc compilation demonstrates, he is an extremely talented and important artist. Assembled as part of Columbia's Essential repackaging of its signature artists, The Essential Bruce Springsteen is a fine introduction to his work and it atones for the shoddy 1995 compilation Greatest Hits (12 tracks are common to both). The previous Hits collection was both too brief, and poorly selected. The Essential stretches 30 of Springsteen's best-known songs over two discs and then adds a third of odds-and-ends. Springsteen's career has been a series of attacks and retreats. He stormed out of the gate in 1973 on Greetings from Asbury Park as a word-drunk boho who spent as much time in Manhattan as he did on the Jersey shore. Manfred Mann and Greg Kihn made ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""For You"" into hits by omitting words, smoothing out Springsteen's chaotic phrasing and tightening the rhythm. The original versions here are loose and elastic as they come, with rubbery drumming by early E Streeter Vinnie Lopez that was the polar opposite of Max Weinberg's robotic thud. The race for the rock 'n' roll prize picked up steam later that year with The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, but here, Springsteen traded some of the goofy Dylanesque wordplay of his debut for detailed, romantic character studies that borrowed from Van Morrison. When Tom Waits described Springsteen's songs from this period as ""little black and white films,"" he was talking about material like ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"". And there has never been a bar band rave-up quite like ""Rosalita"", which is structured like a suite without losing any of its whiteboy R&B; energy. The final phase of Springsteen's early charge was the 1975 album Born to Run, where he openly stated that he was trying to make the greatest rock album of all time (later he clarified that what he was shooting for was Phil Spector producing Roy Orbison with words by Dylan). Songs like ""Born to Run"" and ""Jungleland"" are overblown to a degree that some find comical (here is the structural template for Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell). It's true, these songs swirl and build and jump from one discrete section to the next, and who now would try and get away with the line, ""I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight in an everlasting kiss""? (Andrew WK, maybe.) This is rock mythology as gospel music, and there is no possible way to appreciate it other than to give yourself over to it completely. Darkness on the Edge of Town from 1978 was the first retreat. Springsteen's lyrical focus darkened as his sound became leaner. This was the record in which Springsteen saw economy as a storytelling virtue, perhaps in emulation of fiction writers he admired like Flannery O'Connor. Unfortunately, Darkness is probably the album served most poorly by Essential. The omission of ""Racing in the Street"" is puzzling, considering that it's one of Springsteen's best ballads and also manages to turn the mythology of ""Born to Run"" completely on its head. ""Candy's Room"" is one of his best rock songs and should have replaced ""Promised Land"". The two-disc album The River is difficult to pull from for an anthology. It was something of a summary of what Springsteen had done to that point, its upbeat frat-rock cuts alternating with country weepers. The Essential chooses ""Hungry Heart"" and ""The River"", one great song from each end of the spectrum. Obvious choices, certainly, but sensible. ""Hungry Heart"" was Springsteen's first Top 10 single and he followed that popularity by drawing inward and recording the solo acoustic Nebraska, the album that has certainly become the indie rock favorite in Springsteen's catalog. He was at home with the four-track years before it became an indie cliché, and he was writing stark, superbly focused songs that people have been covering ever since. ""Nebraska"" and ""Atlantic City"" are the two represented here, again completely obvious choices but ones that make the most sense for a Springsteen newcomer. The second disc of The Essential picks up with ""Born in the USA"". At some point after Nebraska, Springsteen decided to kick his career back into high gear. His sound got huge, he became versed in the ways of MTV (though his videos were awful), and he basically lived in stadiums for a couple years. Born in the USA has little to recommend to an indie purist but listen to ""Dancing in the Dark"" and it's easy to hear why it was so popular: Springsteen's melodic gift was at its peak. The Essential adds ""Glory Days"", which I never liked (I would have swapped it for ""I'm on Fire"", the album's subtlest moment), and the title track, about which little remains to be said. It was ironic but the patriots loved (and love) it. After the deluge of Born in the USA, Springsteen laid low for a good ten years to make quieter music and eventually raise a family. Tunnel of Love from 1987, recorded largely alone at his home studio, is Springsteen's most underrated album and certainly his last great one. The title track has the booming synth-pop sound of the preceding record, but Springsteen is painting with a finer brush and dealing with emotion in the abstract. ""Brilliant Disguise"" is perhaps Springsteen's finest lyric, a sharply observed mediation on vulnerability and self-doubt. The two albums Springsteen released in 1992 were the weakest of his career, and Essential rescues the titles cuts and ""Living Proof"" from the heap (though only ""Human Touch"" approaches the best of Tunnel of Love). Springsteen peaked melodically in the early 80s, but he's compensated for his weaker tunes since by becoming a more skilled storyteller. The Ghost of Tom Joad has the stark sound and detail of some Nebraska songs, but the title track, represented here, lacks a tune that sounds like it has always existed. The events of 9/11 energized Springsteen, calling him back to the spotlight for his first record with the E Street band since Born in the USA. I like the melody of ""The Rising"", but it sounds an awful lot like Steve Miller's ""Jet Airliner"", and ""Mary's Place"" doesn't have nearly enough of a hook for a song about a party. As demonstrated on these songs and the live tribute to Amadou Diallo, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"", Springsteen addresses big contemporary topics with nuance, but it's tough to listen to songs repeatedly when you know they're connected with a single real-life event. The bonus rarities disc is spotty but has awesome highs. It's great to finally have Springsteen's dynamic live cover of Jimmy Cliff's ""Trapped"" on CD, which was previously released only on the USA for Africa album (it was a radio staple in 1985). The slow, gentle ""Lift Me Up"", which Springsteen recorded for a John Sayles film, has an ungodly beautiful falsetto and perhaps Springsteen's best melody of the 90s. I could do without the cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"", however, and ""Code of Silence"" is a Springsteen rocker on autopilot. But that's why they're a bonus. The meat of this collection is enough to chew on for a lifetime. The two discs get the Springsteen story as right as is possible in 150 minutes, and if they don't work, then Springsteen is definitely not for you.","It's been a long time since Springsteen has been hip, if he ever was.

I'm Going to Do What I Wanna Do: Live at My Father's Place 1978,Captain Beefheart,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f09d034d5c69bf367b/1:1/w_160/cc5bf6f9.gif,2004-01-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1742-im-going-to-do-what-i-wanna-do-live-at-my-fathers-place-1978/,RhinoRhino,"Although time has already rendered most of Captain Beefheart's studio recordings magnificent at best and reluctantly inspired at worst, there's never been a successful method of conveying what must have been one of the great live shows in the history of rock. Even if it hardly needs to be mentioned at this point, The Magic Band's music aspires to a confluence of all the most visceral and kinetic forms of music in the last century: sliding, sling-shotting Chicago blues, cindered rockabilly brannigans, eviscerating free-jazz convulsions, and spontaneous ""turn on, drop out"" happenings. One would imagine a Magic Band at their prime could, at the very least, challenge the galvanic pandemonium of a Ronnie Hawkins/Albert Ayler double-bill. If the U.S. could harness this kind of energy, we wouldn't be in Iraq right now. Unfortunately, for the last three decades, the official live Beefheart concerts have been pretty dismal: They either document some of the less interesting permutations of the band in the 1980s or are marred by poor recording technology. There was a slight consolation for the wealthy businessman who happened to find themselves in the German bootleg market; the rest of us suffered in silence. Until now. Or, actually, three years ago. In 2000, Rhino Handmade released an Internet-only 1.16-disc recording of the Shiny Beast-era Magic Band at a November 1978 show in Long Island. Now it's being re-released all over Amazon.com and your local Blockbuster Music, permitting all those off-line backcountry hippies to relive their glory days without sacrificing their bizarre commune lifestyles. Most of the selections in the 85-minute show are drawn from 1978's Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller), Beefheart's return to form after three previous lackluster albums. However, there's also ample material from 1967's gorged garage masterpiece, Safe as Milk, 1972's eerily approachable Clear Spot, and Trout Mask Replica. For a band often accused of an overly abstract exploitation of rhythm and blues, this particular Magic Band incarnation can growl like a toasted bar-band or keep the sort of lock-step dance percussion that later generations would ignorantly deem ""post-rock."" On ""Owed T'Alex"" and ""Tropical Hot Dog Night"", the guitars are weightless, flickering, and muted. Robert Williams' drums are given prominence and Bruce Fowler's epically metal trombone plunges straight to the Earth's core. And, of course, there's also Beefheart's deranged grumbling of lyrics that even Freud would shake his head at. The yelping crowd, alternately entranced and exasperated, drives the Captain to ever-further limits of howling depravity. His voice is more carcinogenic than Bob Dylan's, more drunkenly spastic than Hasil Adkins', and more sinisterly sepulchral than Johnny Cash's. Even more interesting than the Shiny Beast tracks, however, is the band's rendition of songs written by an earlier Magic Band. Guitarists Jeff Tepper and Richard Redus never try to simply ape Zoot Horn Rollo's legendary lunacy on Trout Mask Replica. Instead, on ""Old Fart at Play"", ""Moonlight on Vermont"", and ""Veteran's Day Poppy"", the new band folds the cuttingly arrhythmic honks and squawks into traditional blues arcs that are only apparent after the ""riff"" is over. This perfectly captures the whole point of Beefheart's music: not to sound crazy, but to sound one step away from normal, like a jigsaw puzzle that coincidentally fits together without making the intended picture. Though Beefheart's vocals on the older Safe as Milk songs aren't always up to his usual standard, the songs themselves seem faster, leaner, and, on ""Dropout Boogie"", even more self-parodic, like a teenage anthem played from the bottom of a well. Nevertheless, the most enticing aspect of this might be Beefheart's between-song banter. He somehow manages to sound even more unhinged than he sounds in the studio. By the end of the second song, he's already rambling about Roslyn's Hollywood telephone cords to a clearly hostile audience. At other points, he breaks off a performance to yell (at an audience member?) about assuming a song is in 4/4 and blames the death of poetry on a 24-hour Denny's. Obviously, then, this is a damn good time. Still, I'm Going to Do What I Wanna Do certainly doesn't recommend itself to Beefheart neophytes. Although it's surely the best official Beefheart live release on the market right now, I will be personally offended if you listen to it before hearing his studio albums. At the same time, isolated milliseconds of a song like ""Suction Prints"" have been converted into entire albums by indie cognoscenti in the 80s and 90s. There are one or two moments on this show, towards the end, that are as close to a pure distillation of rock energy as this sad world is ever likely to get. It comes down to this: one of the best bands of the 70s playing some of the most intimidating and irrational songs of the century in front of a crowd of acidheads and hooligans.","Although time has already rendered most of Captain Beefheart's studio recordings magnificent at best and reluctantly inspired at worst ...

The charismatic vocalist is (was?) the perfect voice for Star Trak's sci-fi disco, and should rightfully be a household name by now. The limelight, however, managed to elude her over the course of her past two albums, marking her for a career more akin to that of Bubba Sparxxx: some critical acclaim, a slight public profile, but otherwise wrongly written off as a diversionary pet project for a superstar producer. It all started well: a duet with ODB (""Got Your Money"") and a minor hit (""Caught Out There"", with the memorable refrain, ""I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!"") from a fantastic debut, Kaleidoscope, which made more than one PFM writer's best-of-the-90s list. Sadly, the record-- an offbeat blend of afrofuturism and futuristic beats-- was merely a cult hit, and her no-less-accomplished follow-up, the prescient lo-fi digital disco-spattered Wanderland, wasn't even released domestically. A steady stream of guest appearances with everyone from dance producers Richard X, Moby, and Timo Maas to Star Trak cohorts Philly's Most Wanted and N.E.R.D. kept her in the public sphere, if still largely out of the public eye. The result of it all has made Kelis one of the unluckiest women in pop, so when, on her Tasty collaboration with fiancé Nas, she says she wants to get it on ""in public,"" she could as likely mean MTV or the glossy pages of music monthlies as ""a club bathroom or a restaurant mens' room."" Too often here, it sounds as if she's aiming for that alone, trading the eccentricity and rough-edged headsnap of her first two albums for a fairly generic run of radio-friendly sounds: nu-soul balladry, a Rick Rubin-circa-1986 outtake, and some Neptunes-by-numbers. Indeed, with Tasty, Kelis has left the roller-rink, returned from outer space, and she's back on her own two feet on terra firma-- unfortunately. That Nas collaboration, ""In Public"", is possibly the low-point of what is often a transparent Beyoncé-aping full-length (starting with the cover art, which bares a striking resemblance to that of the ""Crazy in Love"" single). Naturally, Kelis' relationship with Jay-Z's one-time sparring partner Nas aids comparisons like this, but they're deserved nonetheless, as the once fiercely individualistic singer now seems content the constitute one-half of Bonnie and Clyde '04. Despite her concessions to shoot higher in the charts, Tasty is far from all doom-and-gloom. Ironically, it's one of the album's most adventurous beats, ""Milkshake"", that's providing Kelis a breakthrough-- all the more reason to lament the pair of sluggish duets with Raphael Saadiq and the woeful Neptunes track ""Sugar Honey Iced Tea"", which both demonstrate touches of straight-laced, polite nu-soul. Most of The Neptunes' tracks are fine, and all are recognizable-- you know the drill by now-- but little to get excited about. Outkast's Andre 3000 puts in appearance as well, reciprocating for Kelis' guest spot on ""Dracula's Wedding"", with a decent track that, while an improvement on most of his overcooked work on The Love Below, still feels a bit slight, like a sketch or an idea half-realized-- and which ironically relegates Kelis herself to the margins. Dallas Austin punches above his weight with ""Trick Me"", on which Kelis advises to ""call the police/ There's a madwoman in town,"" over a skanking, slightly echoed guitar. Alas, that's a warning more apropos for Kaleidoscope and Wanderland, but since neither of those records could get Kelis arrested in this country, she's doing little to draw attention to herself, apparently satisfied that her ""Milkshake"" is quite enough.","When you've been the house chanteuse for The Neptunes for the past five years, you'd expect to have ...

The Glad Fact,Dirty Projectors,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5fea9e61561daa720d/1:1/w_160/f69613d0.jpg,2004-01-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2534-the-glad-fact/,Western Vinyl,"Things you should know about Dave ""D-Lo"" Longstreth, the singer, visual artist, and multi-instrumentalist behind The Dirty Projectors: The Yale dropout is (why pull punches?) a nobrow genius, who claims to find similar solaces in the work of Beethoven, Wagner, Zeppelin and Timberlake. He is obsessed with rendering into song an image that congeals the iconography of Poe, Hitchcock, and McDonalds. That image: a young man defending himself from an army of finches by pelting them with french fries. This daymare haunts Longstreth's (for freak-out fans only) Morning Better Last EP and his current album The Glad Fact, as well as his forthcoming ""double EP"", Slaves' Graves and Ballads (half of which will feature his ten-piece Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra), and his upcoming ""glitch opera,"" The Getty Address. His (often multi-tracked) vocals are (often wonderfully) way over the top: he belts like a conspicuous olden minstrel who'd be murdered by his knights, croons like a homeless, yankee Morrissey, warbles like an acid-bent Jim James, panics like a bansheefied M. Ward, and even occasionally barks like a castrati Casablancas. These comparisons are cute indie lilypads for us to drink to, but I am still failing to communicate how soothing Longstreth can sound, how raceless, and how sincerely surreal. I could throw more vocal styles at you (Xiu Xiu, Bobby McFerrin, TV on the Radio), but the neighbors and their cops would think we were causing a disturbance. He wrote much of The Glad Fact in lungbursts, accompanying himself with a fist on the roof of his car. One of the album's showpieces, ""My Offwhite Flag"", with its deconstructed Toots & The Maytals versus Need New Body vibe, evokes a Lockheed Martin post-kaboom-scape: to this song the listener can picture a West that has been smithereened into archipelagodom, where the human survivors place their faith in po-mo calypso's power to impress the warlord carnival judges. He doesn't cling to any lo-fi manifesto, telling me in an email Q&A; that championing one aesthetic as somehow offering more texture than another is ""like religion, a way of training your gaze to obscure what's in front of you."" While he promises that his next project will be 5.1, fuzz-and-buzzheads may savor the Robert Pollard chords of ""Naked We Made It"" and the underplayed epic solo of ""Lit from Below"". He has created some bizarrely tuned and timed Connecticut jazz. ""Boredom Is a Product"" plays like Owls being led by a drag Nina Simone; the brilliantly strummed ""Like Fake Blood in Crisp October"" suggests a pre-intermission ballad from Institutionalizing Porgy and Bess. Longstreth coos the Liars-esque line, ""That's not a monument/ It's a grave,"" only to transcend it: ""The new feelings will probably be buried here, too."" Let me clarify my earlier reliance on ""genius."" Longstreth is not necessarily a zeitgeisty and palatable master assimilator (see Bob Dylan). He's another kind of genius, the unhinged, half-formed kind who sometimes overconceives and overexecutes (see Phil Elvrum). D-Lo has, fittingly, toured with several of the experi-mellow bands out of the increasingly mystical K Records compound. Also be warned: if you grew up in the back of a stationwagon, near a ""classic parking lot at the end of time,"" prepare for a life-changingly deadpan and exultant refrain about those days of plastic passion: no one can swoon ""We drank a two-liter of Orange Crush"" the way Dave Longstreth does.","Things you should know about Dave ""D-Lo"" Longstreth, the singer, visual artist, and multi-instrumentalist behind The Dirty Projectors:

Can DVD,Can,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fe9d034d5c69bf31c7/1:1/w_160/3f057434.gif,2004-01-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1272-can-dvd/,Mute,"I'm sitting here listening to one of Michael Karoli's tracks with his band Soforkontakt from the third disc of Mute's Can DVD set as I write. Karoli, as is consistently revealed throughout the documentary and concert footage, is at once completely in his own world and utterly dependent on those around him to supply a vast, textured canvas upon which he can deposit all the glorious, psychedelic sun rays his guitar can muster. His portion of the disc demonstrates that although Can were no longer an active entity, he was playing with the same abandon, albeit with a slightly vintage grace that would have been too restrictive for his younger self. Sure, Soforkontakt sound suspiciously like a jam-band Can, but weren't Can really just a smart, curious, disciplined jam band, anyway? Or, I could attempt the high road and say Can were the archetypical post-rock collective. They took the spontaneous energy and immediacy of rock music and replaced it with pure spontaneity. They didn't really need ""riffs,"" hooks or drum solos, because their ideals were found in the individual processes of actively trying to go where no one had gone before, while at the same time being acutely aware that each of their fates were indelibly tied to those of the others. Working as a whole, the music and the trip would take care of themselves. The band certainly knew of rock and took inspiration from it, but were also aware of alternative revolutions: Fluxus, Stockhausen's radical formalism, jazz, free improvisation and a whole world of indigenous folk music. And of course, they had the fortune not to have been from America or the UK, where already robust foundations of modern pop and rock would have very quickly consumed their ambitions. Can were always outside and apart from rock music, yet ultimately dependent on it. Can DVD helps make a lot clear about the German band, while maintaining much of the band's time-honored mystique. Consisting of two DVDs and one audio CD, the set contains an incredible free concert from Cologne in 1972 (originally available on VHS in the out-of-print Can Box), multiple documentaries and remixes, and a CD of solo works by Irmin Schmidt, Jaki Liebezeit, Holger Czukay and Karoli. There are a few testimonials from other musicians (including a frankly tossed-off ""film"" by Brian Eno), and even a vaguely surreal sequence of Flea and John Frusciante giving a lifetime achievement award to the band at the 2003 Echo Awards (apparently, the German Grammys). Of course, nobody buys these things because they need to know how great the band is-- they buy it because they're big fans and they'll buy anything. Luckily, and probably predictably, Can's video retrospective offers a lot more than glazed montages. The first disc begins with the aforementioned Cologne performance, and should be required viewing and listening for any serious Can fan. Collectors are making noise that Mute dropped the ball by not including more live material (or at least different material than was present on the old Can Box video), but having this concert available on DVD can't be considered a bad thing. Director Peter Przygodda captures a band still in transition from raucous motorik mammoths to minimalist sound-painters. The opening scene cuts between close-ups of the band, a small child playing drums and other seemingly random images (an elephant, a tower, etc.); later, scenes of the band playing onstage are interspersed with scenes of them performing the same piece in the studio. The direction is a tad on the artsy side, but I think more or less in the spirit of the group. The bass-heavy, burning, claustrophobic version of ""Spoon"" that opens the show works wonders on any complaints I have of the filmmaking. Przygodda also compiles the ""Can Notes"" documentary on disc one, which features interviews and footage from the band spanning 1997 (the press tour for the Sacrilege remix project) to 2003. ""Can Notes"" goes a long way towards establishing the various personalities of Can's members, all of which are repeatedly emphasized throughout the remainder of the set. Holger Czukay comes on like the wise, buoyant, eternally fascinated professor; Jaki Liebezeit is a simple, modest craftsman; Karoli, even in middle age, still a child of a different, boundless era; Schmidt surprised me the most in that he was clearly the greatest ""star"" of the band. He enjoys being offhandedly provocative, receiving no end of pleasure relating his tales of becoming ""corrupted"" in New York City in 1966. The second disc contains another full-length documentary compiled by seasoned music video directors Rudi Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher. Of the most immediate interest are the performance clips of ""Paperhouse"", ""Vernal Equinox"" and their ""disco"" single, ""I Want More"", among others. The performances are taken from German television, and UK programs like Top of the Pops and Bob Harris' Old Grey Whistle Test, and are goldmines not only of Can-icana, but of vintage 70s music television direction. The 1971 ""Paperhouse"" performance, wherein the band are backed by a formless yellow-green background, and with Damo Suzuki in full hillgnome/hippie mode will have Schoolhouse Rock junkies running for cover. I was pleasantly surprised at the energy in the band's later 70s performances, like ""Vernal Equinox"" from 1975. This track didn't do much for me on the Landed album, but here the band blows it down in freaked-out disco-funk style. Similarly, their 1977 German TV instrumental renditions of ""Moonshake"" and ""Dizzy Dizzy"" blaze by, then with former-Traffic bassist Rosko Gee laying down a slippery fusion lines that eventually prompt Schmidt to get fucking crazy on his keyboard, slapping, elbowing and otherwise terrorizing the keys. All that and a scene where Karoli and Schmidt talk about nose hair! Can has long been more of an occasional gathering than a ""band,"" per se, and their decision to fill this collection's third disc with solo tracks by each of the members is entirely in line with past efforts like 1990's Cannibalism 3 compilation. For the most part, the music is sometimes reminiscent of Can, but more so (and suitably) of the individual forces at work. Schmidt's pieces with Kumo (who provides beats and other electronics) recall much of his solo work with evocative synth patches and a not-too-subtle classical influence, as if Schmidt would be perfectly at home providing space-age bachelor pad music for Maurice Ravel. Czukay's three live selections with his current collaborator U-She are exercises in ""theories"" of musique concrete put into gothic techno-pop practice, though not quite as openly embracing dance music as the pair's 2003 release, The New Millennium. Liebezeit's music with Flanger's Burnt Friedman is fittingly the most percussive of the collection-- even for a group of people who Schmidt describes as judging music ""in the first place"" by its rhythmic qualities. It's a shame Liebezeit's DVD footage isn't nearly as fleshed out as his one piece on disc three, but then, you have to respect a drummer who has refined his craft to the point where he doesn't even need to use his legs anymore. There are a couple of things Can DVD makes clear. Firstly, they were one of the great live bands. If I have one complaint, it would not be that this set duplicates material from another box, but that there just isn't enough of it. Make no mistake: This is a band who have still yet to take advantage of the music in their vaults; I wouldn't be surprised if there are 10 discs' worth of top-notch concert material thus far unheard by anyone other than the band and the audience. Secondly, given the range of personalities, interests, aims and backgrounds that went into Can, it's a minor miracle that they're still known as one of the great, experimental collectives. Furthermore, it becomes obvious over the course of the documentaries that the remaining members are still very much a part of each others' lives. At any moment, if the mood should strike and everyone agrees it is the best decision, it seems they could reform and produce something of as great an impact as on any of their classic records. Or, they could leave behind all of this business tomorrow. Regardless, their music will remain vital for as long as people are fascinated with Whatever Comes Next.","I'm sitting here listening to one of Michael Karoli's tracks with his band Soforkontakt from the third disc ...

Don't Postpone Joy,Egg,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce7abf31b7dc7155e1a/1:1/w_160/5223eb3d.gif,2004-01-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2896-dont-postpone-joy/,Mutek,"The threshold wasn't well defined, but at some point, after years of shopping at Boston's Twisted Village Records, I inevitably felt drawn to take advantage of the record store's extremely unorthodox and potentially self-destructive perk: a cart-blanche listening station. The only true try-before-buy I know of, short of supermarket samples and certain types of prostitution, any album can be cracked open and held suspect to the stylus; everyone, it seems, has struggled through the Merzbox for at least a couple hours. This feature finds itself particularly useful in the case of those countless, expensive electronic imports that continually elude the P2Ps. My criterion for the day was admittedly simple-minded: I was perfectly beat-happy, and the debut innards of Montreal-based Egg's digipak, Don't Postpone Joy, had to be, too. The disc, beyond the onus of introducing artists Julien Roy and Guillaume Coutu-Dumont, also inaugurates Mutek Records, which plans to issue a compilation of its successful Montreal experimental electronic festival namesake and a wealth of similar-minded local Montreal talent. Much of Don't Postpone Joy is largely upbeat, falling squarely in the crib of minimal electronic's archetypal, failsafe slickness. The record most consistently recalls the darker, respoked big beats and glitchy quirk of Mouse on Mars' Idiology and the crisp, wiry sampling (and geography) of Akufen's My Way-- although in forgoing a reliance on hooks for almost suffocating builds of cut-ups and added instrumental lines, this duo seems to aspire less to the dancefloor than to some intensified abstraction of its sweat. ""Alternative Biology"", ""La Corde"" and ""Continuous Drizzle"" constitute the album's dark, delicately composed opening sequence. There's more rhythm present in these tracks than in the more abstract material of Eggs' contemporaries in Mouse on Mars, as shots of synth are fired into vast, open chambers, and vocal cut-ups echo and pan across the Bucaphelan bounce. An unobtrusive bassline and sputters of high- and low-frequency glitch settle into the mix, which for its nervous turbulence, lacks any discernible build or motivation. ""La Corde"", on the other hand, flat-out smokes. Coupling a big bass/tiny click movement with deft string section cut-ups, Egg stuffs the track with quick shouts of ""Party!"" and vinyl, locked groove-style violin skips. The groove's heart of darkness is loosened only once, when a fleeting string sample sounds the track's lone major chord. ""Continuous Drizzle"", with its endless barrage of vocal cut-ups and fittingly splattered treble drops, is simply stormy Akufen-- which is both a compliment and criticism. Clearly, the duo take root in a storied electronic tradition, and their ability to make sweeping stylistic shifts is commendable, but at times, their similarities to predecessors and forbearers are too overwhelming: the spritely ""Clara"", while enjoyable, also rips its pages from Akufen's book; ""Ramp"" sports effects eerily similar to Wolfgang Voigt's 12-inches; the brief ""Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport"" is a quirky sampling ditty that comes off too much like a middle-aged Max Tundra. Beyond these regurgitations, however, Egg offer two wonderfully inventive tracks: The first, the downtempo ""Kabuki Express"", borrows the tapered horn blasts of Mouse on Mars and shrouds itself in a verdant mist and spooky flute and synth melodies. The samples react to one another with a dynamic akin to jazz rhythm sections, inhabiting a peculiar consciousness that expresses itself through the samples' call-and-response mimicry and self-incarnation. The second, ""Rouge de Base"", most clearly showcases Egg's potential ability to busy a track with an inordinately varied number of samples while maintaining legitimate and perspirant movement. What's unusual about this track is that, despite its complete lack of a hook, it remains undeniably a song in the most traditional sense, its tearful bassline bearing all the marks of a tech-house break-up anthem like Luomo's ""Tessio"". Between these two numbers, it's clear that Egg have something new to add to a micro-house genre growing exponentially as artists, labels, and debuts of both crop up before us. As an inaugural release for Mutek, Don't Postpone Joy also promises the possibility of a new electro-label epicenter: a Montreal Kompakt or Basic Channel certainly couldn't be a bad thing.","The threshold wasn't well defined, but at some point, after years of shopping at Boston's Twisted Village Records ...

"Hey You, Yes You",Ben Lee,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbf13d197565213b3b5/1:1/w_160/0404aca7.jpg,2004-01-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4712-hey-you-yes-you/,F-2,"Think of niche-songwriting as a delicate system of checks and balances, a constant scuffle to avoid pesky, ever-constricting labels: Maybe more so than any other sonic subculture, floppy-haired, pink-faced singer/songwriters have an odd tendency to eschew ""sensitive"" pigeonholing by employing jerky beats and wobbly loops, threading in synth lines to counteract their earnest acoustic strums. Thus, the emergence of a formula: Temper organics by sneaking in squeaky electronic bits, each earthy, misty-eyed component carefully offset by its cold, shiny opposite. Australian press-prodigy Ben Lee's last full-length, 1998's Breathing Tornadoes, saw him pushing the same kind of disappointingly benign electro-folk aesthetic: precious warbling layered over limp, tittering beats, an endless expanse of flaccid, noncommittal elevator-pop without the hooks or ingenuity to endure. Nearly six years have passed since that album's release (Lee's label, the Beastie Boy-owned Grand Royal, has since collapsed), and while Lee has since roped in an impressive collaborator-- shockingly, Hey You was produced by Dan the Automator-- and spent plenty of time weaseling around with fellow pop-rockers Ben Kweller, Ben Folds, and Evan Dando, his artistic agenda hasn't shifted in any significant way. If anything, Hey You, Yes You is remarkable for its blankness; the record putters along, dopily paced and packed with glib, yawning one-liners (""It's not my fault/ Your love's like salt""), politely trotting itself into the ground. While not quite as self-consciously electro-drenched as Breathing Tornadoes, Hey You has more than enough instantly forgettable lite-rock quasi-noodling to compensate for its lost beats. While Lee never quite grew into the brilliance his chattering critics predicted, his earlier releases nonetheless showcased an ability to pen inescapable pop hooks, which was vaguely remarkable, given his age: At 14, Lee, then fronting childhood band Noise Addict, was stacking up massive piles of next-big-thing press clippings, unilaterally lauded for his songwriting prowess and championed by cred-heavy U.S. artists like Thurston Moore (who released Noise Addict's demo as an EP, on his Ecstatic Peace label) and Mike D. (who later signed Lee to Grand Royal). Hey You, Yes You reveals little of young Lee's fervor, and even less of his energy: Opener ""Running with Scissors"" is as clichéd as its title: A goofy guitar riff and Lee's high warbles coalesce into a perfectly generic whole, while the synthesized percussion keeping time beneath sounds plucked from the pre-programmed beatbank of a cheap Casio. ""Dirty Mind"" features the keyboard stylings of Phantom Planet's Jason Schwartzman (who also co-wrote ""Chills"", a sappy trip-hop lament that boasts the face-souring/mind-blowing chorus, ""You give me chills"") and is, regrettably, Hey You's most instantly palatable track, a bouncy, vocals-heavy bit of blippy folk-rock. ""Music 4 the Young and Foolish"" (chorus: ""'Cause this is music/ 4 the young and foolish"") seems unintentionally dated with its clunky, oddly arrhythmic disco swells. ""No Room to Bleed"" is almost embarrassingly overwrought, its plaintive piano melody periodically interrupted by bursts of drum machine, and Lee's mournful coos landing like the yelps of a less smirky Ben Folds. By now, the straightforward folk-ballad ""Shine"" feels gloriously, refreshingly honest. It's possible that Ben Lee's been perpetually distracted by his numerous side projects, or simply gotten too comfortable with steady mediocrity. Either way, Hey You, Yes You is a wincingly ordinary experiment in wincingly ordinary songwriting. Folk-beat formula can, occasionally, yield brilliant (or at least interesting) results, building unexpectedly prickly tensions-- or, it can allow, as it does here, for a record that sounds stifled, contrived, and unbearably trite.","Think of niche-songwriting as a delicate system of checks and balances, a constant scuffle to avoid pesky,\n\ ever-constricting labels ...

The Complete Studio Recordings: NYC 1977-1978,Mars,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c447c0084474cd0c365e/1:1/w_160/b5022ac1.gif,2004-01-04 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5563-the-complete-studio-recordings-nyc-1977-1978/,G3GSpooky Sound,"I'm looking up from an interview with William Burroughs, at a mariachi group as they smile and try to find their balance on a downtown train. Their gestures of voice, guitar, and rhythm are promptly drowned in brake drones, the shuddering of the decrepit old tracks, and plastic-protected ads for acne surgery and model-proffered Budweisers. All I can hear through the din is the disquieting roar of Mars and singer China Burg's sinister slurring: ""What I put together, I can take apart."" Since I refuse to spend the $30 for a CD copy of No New York, I'm grateful to have the complete recordings of Mars (count one seven-inch, four tracks from NNY, and one EP-- a half-hour in total) howling through my headphones. For those keeping track, since the digital age, another complete discography of Mars already came out on the Atavistic label, but with vague sonic tweaking by Foetus scraper Jim Thirlwell. Purists might argue that since band member Mark Cunningham used a different master tape for transferring the Mars EP (even restoring its binaural recording quality), it's still not going to sound like the ""murkier"" frequencies of the original wax. From the metallic sparkle of the midnight blue card sleeve to the insightful commentary offered by the remaining members (Sumner Crane passed away earlier this year), this limited edition package is too exquisite to overlook, no matter how distressing the aural mess splattered inside. For those obsessed with the no-wave aura, the biggest surprise would appear to be their first single, ""3E""/""11,000 Volts"". The quartet of Burg, Crane, Cunningham, and drummer Nancy Arlen were still toying with post-punk in 1977, the instruments fairly coherent as they churned together. Sumner could've sounded as haunted as Ian Curtis were he not evoking Swann's Way in the lyrics. On the flip, the ever-encroaching menace of their sound manifests itself, seeping up around the eerie utterances of China Burg. It continues to seethe through certain moments of Sonic Youth and the Dead C, up through the Liars and Yeah Yeah Yeahs today, but here it's an uncut sound that curdles milk into white-noise gobs. Mars' quarter of No New York still stuns, despite Eno's fabled ""no production"" technique. From the strafing runs of ""Helen Forsdale"" through the bleary stabs of ""Hairwaves"", they remain beyond rock (or any music's) reason. Whether smothering everything in the claustrophobic horrors of ""Tunnel"" or flashing a brief second of funk bass before the hallucinated ""Puerto Rican Ghost"", their malice merges with the absurd. How else to have sneered lyrics about ""pimply pimply skin so reptilian"" and off-track betting go with transcriptions of homeless madmen, snatches of impenetrable French writer Raymond Rousseau, and readings from The Theory of Business Enterprises sound so deranged and (the biggest surprise for me) dangerous still? As they continued to devolve and finally disintegrate, by December of 1978, Mars happen upon disinterred beats and sonic dementia too bleak to ever again be approximated. Lurching and moaning like the undead, their final EP (basically a live performance for no one, recorded by Arto Lindsay) is scabrous and abhorrent listening. Nothing gags a fashionable name-dropper like ""The Immediate Stages of the Erotic"", their final three minutes. Despite a vocal performance that purportedly draws on Kirkegaard and ancient Egyptian consonants, these are the band's death spasms, their sound like a bag lady retching up rodenticide while roasting on the third rail, beyond thought and notated music into the tarry, animalistic pit of it all. Harrowing and writhing beyond the constraints of any art concept or tidy movement, Mars music falls apart like zombie limbs, no matter how anyone tries to piece it back together.","I'm looking up from an interview with William Burroughs, at a mariachi group as they smile and try to ...

Welcome Tourist,B. Fleischmann,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be80abf31b7dc7156162/1:1/w_160/61fd5c7b.jpg,2004-01-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3282-welcome-tourist/,Morr,"Austrian-born minimalist Bernhard Fleischmann has put his two previous long-form excursions into the sublime world of minimalist electronica (1999's Pop Loops for Breakfast, and 2000's A Choir of Empty Beds) behind him. Those record displayed enough glitch-friendly melodic bliss to satisfy fans of both Prefuse 73 and Arvo Pärt, but with Welcome Tourist, he attempts, like his labelmates, to push the IDM envelope. Here, for the first time, Fleischmann has added a varied assortment of live instrumentation to his once-solo, groovebox-born musings: Fleischmann himself plays piano, drums, and vibraphone, and fleshes the mix out with saxophone, steel guitar, and looped slabs of musique concrete sampling which he has presumably collected while touring. Unfortunately, though this fusion of sonic elements has produced remarkably vibrant results on albums like The Notwist's Neon Golden, and Ms. John Soda's No P. or D., Fleischmann's double-disc Welcome Tourist is a stubbornly monotonous and solemn affair. The album's twelve compositions (eleven on the first disc, and one 45-minute excursion on the second) are anchored around a quote from American political iconoclast Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience. While Fleischmann's pieces seem too icily removed from Thoreau's heated, emotive writings, many of the record's formal components are tainted with their own brand of individualist politics. Part of the reason the album seems so distant is that Fleischmann no longer allows his melodies to take sonic center stage; each pristine melodic motif is shrouded under sweepingly oppressive and unruly blankets of distortion. In this context, Welcome Tourist seems to present an aesthetic power struggle among different layers of opposing musical strata. Rather than simply allowing these divergent textures to harmonize, Fleischmann aims to show that there will always be an oppressor, and an oppressed, striving for freedom. These power roles remain in constant flux throughout the record. ""A Letter from Home"" features the subdued groove of a live drumkit holding steady under a wondrous piano theme reminiscent of Sigur Rós' ""Untitled #1"", only to be disrupted by boisterous rounds of wailing distortion and icy electronic meandering. Later in the track, the blissful calm of a saxophone (courtesy of Charhizma Records guru Christof Kurzmann) appears like a referee helping to quell the established aesthetic tension. The choppy hip-hop bounce of ""Grunt"" spotlights this same formal equation to equally moving results; a frenetic layer of crumbling sub-atomic sheen holds the muted gloom of tumbling piano notes and the interweaving rhythmic motifs of live drumming and skittering glitch-friendly pops under lock and key. The shining moment of Welcome Tourist, as it so happens, is in complete opposition to the stark instrumental IDM gloom that populates much of the record; near the end of the first disc, ""Le Desir"" swoops in, a modest burst of pure glitch-pop exuberance. The song (which was previously released in another form, and is one of two non-instrumental tracks here) comes as a proverbial breath of fresh air, perfectly capturing Fleischmann's individual championing ideology without coming at the expense of his own music's energy. Over a bed of wistfully melting Rhodes notes and the minimal, driving bounce of electropop liveliness, Christof Kurzman sings empathy-laden lyrics like, ""Yes, we have dreams, and we want them to come true/ Yes, we will live for these moments, me and you/ There's more to life than the everyday routine/ Keep this in mind until life becomes your dream."" ""Le Desir"" is a rare inspired moment of unhampered sentiment, and its purity offers respite from the record of Welcome Tourist's bitter tension. Much of this record can be summed up in its stagnant, 45-minute closure, appropriately titled ""Take Your Time"". Over the course of an album's length, Fleischmann projects a six-note piano motif within as many different stylistic cues as possible, from country to rock to IDM to jazz. Ultimately, though, like the project as a whole, the track is wildly ambitious, but unfortunately, far too refined to match its scope with any lasting sonic ingenuity.","Austrian-born minimalist Bernhard Fleischmann has put his two previous long-form excursions into the\n\ sublime world of minimalist electronica (1999 ...

In the fast moving worlds of both commercial and underground mixtapes, success in collaring the most relevant acts and freshest cuts is the difference between flash-in-the-pan and beat culture empire. In regards to the Nature Sounds team, their display of talent remains balanced enough to warrant a listen. As expected from an album that exists upon the inherent differences of the artists involved, Convexed touches myriad concepts with several atypical approaches: ex-Cannibal Ox magnate Vordul extols the virtues and problems with habitation in ghetto in two tastes (""In the Hood"" with Carnage, ""Never Gonna Hurt Again"") from his upcoming Nature Sounds solo record, MF Doom indulges in aural fear and loathing with his stellar drug and drink anthem ""All Outta Ale"" and RA The Rugged Man & Timbo King contrast the differences between both positive and negative spectrums on ""Black and White"". While the majority of the record falls positively, a few tracks lower this high standard. Nature Sounds artists Space and Ancient Coins bore in the manner expected from label upstarts on a star-studded compilation, while the surprising appearance of a Cannibal Ox track (""Handle That"") leads to a sign of the times: Vordul rapping the same going-for-broke abstract word salad that helped make The Cold Vein a classic, Vast Aire rehashing a lame freestyle from his unbalanced mixtape album and then awkwardly freestyling out of the verse (""And it's like that [awkward silence]/ Cannibal Ox [more awkward silence]/ I wear mini hats/ Whether the jimmy or the New Era/ I get on the mic and sound clever""). This is the same guy that once said, ""You've got beef but there's worms in your Wellington""? The most powerful statement is Aesop Rock's contribution, ""Numb (To the Guns)"". Opening with a news reporter speaking from the middle of an Iraq hot zone, Aesop Rock gives his hilarious and lackadaisical take on the war on Iraq, juxtaposing the convenience of watching war with other common television with intriguing results. Unloading great wordplay (""Me and my fine T&A; on TNT,"" ""P.O.WB, buzz over the rumble of cannons and lead sandwiches""), Aesop claims to have empathy for the battle situation, but is unfortunately more concerned with watching Bring It On, and having ""Wolf Blitzer 'holler at his boy' when he hosts Blind Date."" When asked for his opinion on the war in a street news interview, his answer is simple: ""War sucks donkey dick, what's the Knicks score?"" It's a refreshingly loose vision of a commonly maligned topic, given a lighter approach from the person many wouldn't expect it from. The production is a definite bright spot for the Nature Sounds team. With the majority produced by Nature Sounds (with some work from the Professor and Omega One), the beats succeed in mirroring the personalities of the rappers, from the gorgeous Mobb Deep soulful boom bap of Vordul's ""Never Gonna Hurt Again"" to the sharply chopped Premier-esque piano jazz of Count Bass D's ""Dro Grown"" to the red hooked Twilight Zone guitar loop of Cage's ""Middletown NY"". A couple beats disappoint, most notably Cannibal Ox's ""Handle That"", with its lazy gear shifting sample and boring dub chimes, and Zion I's ""Spinning"", which sounds like a strangled Dr. Mario instrumental. While some songs meander and fail to fully develop, others completely fall flat and several never catch your attention, the intent is complete: Nature Sounds makes a name for itself through a nicely produced, traditional hip-hop compilation that both gives hope to the direction of some artists and reinforces the positives of others.","When it comes to the game of modern compilations, the main caveat is longevity.

DFA Records Presents: Compilation #1,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81013d1975652139580/1:1/w_160/009ac858.gif,2003-12-09 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2031-dfa-records-presents-compilation-1/,DFA,"The Neptunes of the discopunk underground have finally released their answer to Clones: the DFA's Compilation #1, for the first time, compiles all the Brooklyn-based production duo's hype-building twelve-inches, from The Juan MacLean's straightforward electro singles ""By the Time I Get To Venus"" and ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"", to James Murphy's famously tongue-in-cheek ""Losing My Edge"" and decidedly less danceable ""Give It Up"", to The Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers""-- the track that more or less made the DFA the internationally renown playboys they are today-- and the mellow vocal dawn of its B-side, ""Silent Morning"", to Black Dice's danceperimental rockers ""Cone Toaster"" and ""Endless Happiness"". With the exception of the Black Dice track, all of these songs were released last year, and by now, it's safe to say that most indie music fanatics have heard, owned on vinyl, or downloaded sketchy Ogg-Vorbis wax rips of them. This disc means iPodders can now download cleaner versions for their commutes, but after months and months of ""Losing My Edge""-- witty and brilliant though it may be-- most listeners have already moved onto newer DFA releases like the new LCD Soundsystem single, ""Yeah"", which is currently widely available despite its vinyl-only status. At the moment, Compilation #1 to a large degree functions more as an archival folio for early DFA output; in itself, it's a fantastic comp, but perhaps it came a little too late. In time, the songs themselves will undoubtedly regain much of their initial potency, but for now, one can't help but be at least somewhat bored with the exact same song and dance. Maybe that's one of the keys their success, though: Despite having released virtually just singles, the DFA have managed to become the most formidable production team on the indie scene. Their sole employment of vinyl-- an ever scarcer medium for a self-selecting crowd of hardcore music lovers-- created one of the most effective buzz mechanisms I can remember. Perhaps their only recent musical supply-vs-demand equals are the robber barons of Jamaican dub soundsystems. Any schmuck who's read Walter Benjamin can tell you that there's a relationship between a piece of art's exclusivity and the vitality of its aura; it's nothing new here, but the DFA is exceptionally textbook. Moreover, this is a commendable act of self-preservation. Look at what's happened with The Neptunes: their immediately recognizable bump/grind formula made them the most relevant producers in hip-hop; but now, through oversaturation, too many commissions and not enough time to develop new musical ideas, their popularity has begun to wane. The DFA could be to all of rock what The Neptunes are to hip-hop-- there are more than a few tales of major pop stars knocking at their door-- but Goldsworthy and Murphy opt instead to issue mix albums for obscure French clothing outlets and electronic music magazines. For all intents and purposes, their exclusivity maintains their credibility, and refuses any possible allegations that they are a one-trick dancepunk pony. The compilation is indeed called Compilation #1, and implies not only more material in the future as is obvious, but a commitment to growth and diversity in their production as well. To hell with the kids; the DFA ain't losing its edge at all.","The Neptunes of the discopunk underground have finally released their answer to Clones: the DFA's Compilation #1, for the ...

I'm telling you, it's not an easy race to run, this either/or business. A safe and sturdy middle ground is hard to find these days; you try to ride a fence too long and you wind up with your arm in a sling-- or worse. Personally, I say either straight-shoot 'er or put down your guns. And so I take Okkervil River, for example: They seem to be pretty into their thing, be it alt-country or indie-folk or barnyard-to-dive bar-pop or what-the-fuck-have-you, and they seem pretty sincere about it-- which is the crux of the issue; but then again, you never can be too sure. Every few minutes or so during Down the River of Golden Dreams I have to sit back, scratch my chin, and wonder... ""wait a minute..."" 'Cause, damn, I sure hate being taken. Sure, I'd like to think that maybe this is just an honest little batch of songs-- after all, these sentimental, acoustic tracks do feel like old friends. Perhaps these sketchy moments where the band drifts into well-trodden paths and postured frameworks that don't necessarily reflect the band's ingenuity are mere aberrations or stochastic eventualities. What makes me wonder is the occasional sidestep; the buoyantly affected pop-mongering of Bens Folds and Kweller on ""Blanket and Crib"", or frontman Will Sheff's frequent throaty outbursts during which he dons a Conor Oberst-style charcoal hoodie with a Ludens-stuffed kangaroo pocket. I mean, when he's reserved there are these undeniably Tweedy-inflected vocals of crestfallen awareness. And sure, maybe the stuff isn't so much a stealthy combination of its influences (though all done admirably), as it is an expansive, heartfelt, and genuine display of songsmithing that runs from pure balladry to starkly sketched, deeply personal and densely moody revelations. Maybe. 'Cause no posturing indiephile I know opens a song (""The War Criminal Rises and Speaks"") over meekly struck piano chords, earnestly and without any trace of excess-pageantry, with ""The heart wants to feel/ The heart wants to hold/ The heart takes past Subway, past Stop-N-Shop, past Biel's/ And calls it 'coming home.'"" 'Cause it's just not cool. But it is effective, and consistent with the tone of the rest of the album. Most of the songs wade in this pool of lost love and desperation, thrashing or floating about with a seeming disregard for stylistic retention, but in a manner so sufficiently suffocating it sometimes feels calculatedly linear, even though the results come in a variety of shapes and sizes: there are moments big and small, frisky and repined, shifty and direct. Okkervil River perfectly deploys healthy doses of Hammond organ, Rhodes piano, Mellotrons, and Wurlitzer over the course of the album. Sometimes, as on ""It Ends with a Fall"", these instruments serve to counteract the jaunty musings of the track to retain its dredged moodiness. On most of the album, though, acoustic guitars and slight percussion wilt beneath keys and sprinkled pedal steel flavorings. Tracks like ""Maine Island Lovers"" and ""Yellow"" largely forgo involved arrangements, but creep and crawl through Sheff's heartbroken narratives with spacious good taste. In all, the album may feel a bit like sleepwalking through a Decemberists set (and may also be packaged as such), but when you surrender yourself to the sincerity and listless candor of it all, it's easy to side with originality and purebred good taste. Songs this poignant and easy to digest will always have relevance, but then again, they had to have known that, hadn't they?","Go ahead and call me ""Dutch Door"" for this one, 'cause I can swing both ways.

In the past, Pitchfork has only given them compliments as if they were confessions-- and the site wasn't alone (or necessarily wrong), either. There was a time when writing about Coldplay meant unfavorable Travis comparisons (!), trying to sort out exactly what the hell ""Yellow"" was meant to be referring to (I still have no clue), and gleefully reporting that singer and lyricist Chris Martin admitted he was drained of ideas after the release of their debut album. But a funny thing happened to Coldplay on the way to their plot in the post-Bends cemetery next to Starsailor and Lowgold: they got wildly popular. What's more, the band sharpened their skills and that weariness Martin felt trying to write A Rush of Blood to the Head translated into a handful of affecting, populist tracks. Martin's exhaustion exposed his wounds and shrouded them in swirling, melodic arrangements, and while Coldplay may not have taken Radiohead's crown as the Thinking Man's Arena Rock Band, with ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and especially ""Clocks"" they sort of became the Feeling Man's Arena Rock Band. It wasn't really a transformation, just an improvement, that made Coldplay one of a handful of artists who bestrode 2003 by slowly winning over their dissenters and the disbelievers-- and by the time the critical establishment rediscovered the band, they ironically had to cast aside their preconceptions in much the same way that they'd done eight years earlier with The Bends. It's fitting, then, that Coldplay's year ends with a live CD and DVD recorded in Sydney-- a documentation of them engaging with their public, those who were at their side from the start. The decision to package both of these releases together for the same price as either would command on its own helps make what could be seen as a cash-in more of a bargain thank-you. The disc omits five of the tracks from the DVD, including the fan favorite ""Don't Panic"", the singles ""Trouble"" and ""The Scientist"", and ""Daylight"", which would have been a welcome mood-changer for this often middle-of-the-road set. The band does little here to brush off their reputations as rock's nice, dull bunch, offering hopeful sentiments like, ""We sincerely hope you have the best evening of your lives,"" and, ""There's no excuse to be sat down during this song. If you stand up we promise to buy you all ice cream."" The live performance seems more stirring than rousing-- the old softie onstage would rather you put your arms around your best girl or guy than your mates-- and if Martin's guy-next-door stuff isn't part of the band's appeal for you, it may bring on a wince. Another unfortunate downside to the set's prevailing mood is that, at around the halfway mark, Martin's recommendation that ""this would be a great time for you to start singing with us"" stretches a campfire singalong version of ""Everything's Not Lost"" to nearly nine minutes and my patience well past its breaking point. The hits and the better album tracks from A Rush of Blood (the driving ""Politik"" and ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"") shine brightest, but there's little here for the novice. Rarities include the acoustic-based ""See You Soon"" from The Blue Room EP and B-side ""One I Love"", a guitar-driven track which is one of the most Echo & The Bunnymen-like things Coldplay have ever done, with Martin's voice even taking on a touch of McCulloch's brooding baritone. New track ""Moses"", meanwhile, is gutsy and crisp, indicating that Martin may have restored his confidence-- something that might not play to the strengths of a band that's best with its heart on its sleeve. Chris Martin's humility and honesty-- as evidenced by his admissions about the state of his writer's block and/or prolificacy-- are often construed as either bravado or proof of the band's inadequacy. I side with bravado, contending that he likely respects his art enough not to go through the motions and finds strength in appealing to a large audience. After all, Coldplay sound better the bigger they are: Some artists just wouldn't work as a passed secret, and they're one of them. It was this ubiquity that won over unlikely fans such as Timbaland, Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake, and elevated them past yer Stripes and Good Charlottes and Linkin Parks on the rock star ladder this year. The challenge now is in holding that spot, and that's what's going to determine whether this live record turns out to be their Rattle & Hum-- a document of the band at their commercial and, some might say, artistic peak-- or merely their Wide Awake in America, with something more improbably adventurous and potentially soul-enriching yet to come.","Coldplay are arguably the world's biggest rock band, so according to my indie rock guidebook, I should treat them ...

Marquee Moon / Adventure,TelevisionAdventure,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86db1335d7bf16992a0/1:1/w_160/599c9a11.jpg,2003-12-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/,Elektra,"These reissues arrive just a few months too late to catch the red-hot apex of 70s New York revivalism, but that doesn't mean they're any less welcome: with all the attention Television have received lately, it's been strange to see their masterpiece, Marquee Moon, stuck in a bin with all the other old classics at the record store, in a barebones edition with a blue ""Super Saver"" sticker on the wrapper. Television, along with the other 70s legends that inspired the recent reintroduction of guitars, punk and garage-rock to the mainstream, are continually rediscovered by new breeds of NYC hipsters looking to start their own bands. The group's place in history has been resacramented again and again, so by now the backstory's old hat-- you know, the one about them kicking Richard Hell out of the band before they cut their first single, playing gigs and publishing verse with Patti Smith, and talking the owner of the then-unknown CBGB's to host shows of other genres than just ""country, bluegrass, and blues"" (which also makes them largely to blame for all those people that wear the club's t-shirts). You can read first-hand accounts and second-hand analyses of all these events, and one thing you'll uncover is the debate over how ""punk"" Television was. Sure, they joined the movement from the beginning, playing out as early as 1973, and they harnessed the energy you associate with punk, even as they crossed it with art-rock and the poetic urges of frontman Tom Verlaine (nee Miller, renamed after the French poet-- but not in a fey way). But they were also a rock band that roared through long, tense jams: When I first heard ""Marquee Moon"", it somehow felt like I'd already been exposed to it on a classic rock station wedged between Steve Miller and Skynyrd. With all that context, the most interesting thing about picking up Television's Marquee Moon-- today, for us folks who weren't old enough to buy the first edition vinyl-- is how ahistorical it sounds. If you listen to their original Brian Eno-produced demos, you hear a scragglier, faster band that's less confident and more... punk? If nothing else, the band at least sounded closer to the sometimes-sloppy Bowery clubrats Eno must have taken them for on those early tapes. Their sound on Marquee Moon, though, is clean, raw and simple. The band never breaks for a squall of energy, yet the whole record crackles with it, and they never rely on atmosphere to make their case. Billy Ficca's drums and Fred Smith's bass are extra lean and crisp, and the band's so tight that even the ""Did you feel low?"" call-and-response on ""Venus de Milo"" sounds amusingly rehearsed. The only rough edge is Tom Verlaine's striking warble, a somewhat choked-off tenor influenced either by Patti Smith or by someone kicking him in the throat. But the things that make the record so classic, that pump your blood like a breath of clean air, are the guitars. This whole record's a mash note to them. The contrast between these two essential leads is stunning: Richard Lloyd chisels notes out hard while Verlaine works with a subtle twang and a trace of space-gazing delirium. They play lines that are stately and chiming, rutting and torrential, the riff, the solo, the rare power chord, and most of all, the power note: the second pang on the riff to ""Venus de Milo"" lands like a barbell; the opening bars of ""See No Evil"" show one axe rutting the firmament while the other spirals razorwire around it. If Jose Feliciano had rearranged ""Marquee Moon"" the way he ruined ""Light My Fire""-- by emphasizing the melody and lyrics and ditching the solos-- he'd have failed Television even worse than he did The Doors; every part of the song is a bridge to the monstrous Verlaine showpiece, and yet his guitar solo has no bombast: it climbs and soars in tangible increments, edging its way up scales and pounding like a contained explosion. The structural integrity makes this an Eiffel Tower in a world of Burning Men: in a decade full of guitarists spraying sweat on the arenas, Verlaine comes off like a man punching through ceilings. Rhino's remastered release of 1977's Marquee Moon adds a few alternate takes; for example, you can hear ""See No Evil"" with guitar solos scrawled all over the verses. But you also get the first-ever CD release of ""Little Johnny Jewel"", a raw single that twangs and skitters around Verlaine's bug-eyed singing. So if you're new to Television but shy about picking up this bedrock masterpiece for the first time, just tell the cutie at the record store that you're buying it for that single, which alone would be worth the price. With Marquee Moon entrenched in the canon, it's more interesting to revisit their 1978 follow-up, Adventure. This record has always suffered by comparison, mainly because it's so easy to relate it to the first record: the arrangements and the aesthetic are roughly the same, but the music is quieter and more reflective, and that means less horsepower. It's not weak or even very different from their debut, but you might be disappointed when the earth doesn't cave beneath your feet. There isn't a weak song here, even if you count the abandoned title track, which is restored here as a bonus cut. ""Carried Away"", the best ballad on either album, floats away on an organ instead of a guitar; ""The Fire"" sounds as melodramatic as ""Torn Curtain"" but a lot less Stygian. And while ""Foxhole"" and ""Ain't That Nothin'"" wouldn't have broken the flow on Marquee Moon, there's a sense that they're going in a different direction but with the same tools. The reissue is great-- especially for the bonus ""Ain't That Nothin'"" instrumental runthrough-- but a new Television listener would probably be tempted to check out a whole different experience by picking up the live albums, The Blow-Up or Rhino Handmade's new Live at the Old Waldorf. Television broke up after Adventure, and like typical mid-level rockers who fade away instead of dying, they went on to other projects, cut a reunion album in 1992, and still play occasional shows to this day. Writing this up now, it's hard not to feel out of place as someone too young to have caught their shows while the world is bursting with tributes and nostalgia from the people who loved them back when. But if my generation only inherited the band, then this release enshrines it again as something timeless, like that Greek sculpture the band once namechecked that shows motion and grace no matter what museum it's displayed in. Rhino and labels in the future will keep carbon-dating and explaining Marquee Moon, but sometime in the future, some Martian kid who can't get dates and hates sports will look past the plaque and sit in his room, blaring this music and wondering how life can possibly sound this great.","

Archival 1991,Richard Chartier,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ef13d19756521392c7/1:1/w_160/70dfe6fe.gif,2003-12-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1741-archival-1991/,Crouton,"Emptiness; like the sound of hopelessness as you fall through wide corridors, surrounded on every side by an icy, metallic barrier and the flush of a chill wind suffocating any lingering thoughts of the natural world. Depressing? This kind of emptiness even devours depression, acting like a vacuum for emotion. There is no hope, only space. Whenever you think you see a light at the end of the cylinder, it turns out to be an illusion. This is not a dark place, rather an infinite reflection of light without source. You are falling quickly; the bite of the draft momentarily distracts you. In some way, giving into the downward spiral seems like the easiest way to crawl out-- though at your speed, crawling would do little. No, this seems much more permanent. It is the sound of sudden death. Okay, I'll back up. Luckily, the impressions I get from sound artist Richard Chartier's strikingly minimal Archival 1991 are not quite as permanent as death. They are pretty extraordinary, capable of as much resonance as you're willing to invest in them. Since there isn't much ""activity"" involved in the single 46-minute track, the mind has plenty of time to wander into spaces most people probably shy away from as a matter of practice. This isn't to say the music is boring, but merely suggestive where most commercially available stuff (even experimental) works in brighter, more persuasive colors. This CD probably requires an allotment of time alone (or with very attentive friends), in an uncluttered space. In truth, it probably requires a lot more than that, but if you're willing to give it a chance, there are some pretty amazing/scary head games to play. Some people might actually know Chartier (born 1971) better as a graphic designer. In addition to designing all his CD art, he's had work featured at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art and Belfast's Catalyst Arts gallery. His visual aesthetic seems to emphasize the sleek, minimal and straightforward, as if designing an instructional manual for members of a particularly eclectic deep-space exploration team might be his dream job. Fittingly, his music tends not to recall scenes from daily or natural life, but coolly impressionistic vignettes of a scientific world. He releases much of his music on his own Line imprint, though also put out an excellent compilation this year of his non-Line compositions, Other Materials. According to Chartier, Archival 1991 began as two synthesizer-based pieces originally created in 1991. This summer, he revisited (i.e., applied much digital trickery to) those pieces to form this release. As I hear it, he's done a masterful job of integrating the source material into a seamless whole; Archival 1991 not only doesn't sound like a ""remix"", it threatens to overwhelm whatever source might have gone into it. Although beginning hardly louder than the hum from your stereo, it's the kind of piece that will draw you in before you realize how much time has passed. Strictly speaking, this is ambient music, but that shouldn't imply that it's sterile. The piece works through many ebbs and flows. It begins subtly, sounding not unlike the angry sea as heard through a conch shell. Throughout, I'm reminded of the open sound of rushing wind or large bodies of water. A few minutes later, I realize the sound has become more intense, as if nearer the heart of a turbulent current. Furthermore, there are passing washes of bass, guttural in their pitch, but as smooth as a glacier. These washes become more pronounced (and deeper) as the piece reaches its midway point, and as such, the surrounding wind-like sounds retreat to the upper registers. Over time, the winds mostly subside, and the bass seems more focused-- though that could be that I've become much more used to its patterns over the last half hour. Archival 1991 ends as these bass movements spiral into nothingness. If this is emptiness, it is intimidating only in that we are left to our own devices to find a happy ending, or even recognizably ""human"" signposts along the way. However, it's an impressive emptiness from an interesting composer.","Emptiness; like the sound of hopelessness as you fall through wide corridors, surrounded on every side by an icy, metallic ...

Cedric Im Brooks & The Light of Saba,Cedric Im Brooks,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a447c0084474cd0c0463/1:1/w_160/6adb439a.gif,2003-12-08 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1098-cedric-im-brooks-the-light-of-saba/,Honest Jon's,"I feel sorry for a guy like Stephen Hawking. Not because he has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, but because he's hopelessly trying to tie the unbending ends of Einstein and Heisenberg's universal principles, be they macrocosmic or subatomic, into one tidy theory. It's something to which I can sort of relate: My biggest problem as an aficionado of African music is how to tie together Sun Ra, Jamaican godfather producer Sir Coxsone Dodd, Fela Kuti, and Mahmoud Ahmed, the James Brown of Ethiopia. Fortunately, with the help of the similarly obsessive Brits at Honest Jon's, my connective theory for all four giants was simply solved by this compilation of the work of Jamaican saxophonist Cedric Im Brooks and his collective, The Light of Saba. Originally cutting sides in the 1960s at Studio One, the heart of all Jamaican music (check the free sax squall on his ""Mun-Dun-Go"" side off of Soul Jazz's Studio One Instrumentals), Cedric Brooks ended up studying music in Philly late that decade. Already a fan of players like Pharoah Sanders and Sonny Rollins, he gigged and expanded on his sunny and lilting Caribbean tone, meeting up with folks like Leon Thomas and Sun Ra (who had moved the Arkestra back to Philly at this time). When he returned to Jamaica, the ideological outlook of Ra greatly informed Brooks' new approach to creating the music of his home and for his people around the world. Outwardly, they took up a similar sort of garb (down to the robes and shiny headgear), but the music expanded as well, with jazzy ensemble tones, outer-space group chants, and a heavily pan-African handdrum base that could support this all-encompassing and expansive music that was still rooted in the gritty sound of the island. Listen to ""Free Up Black Man"", ""Outcry"", ""Jah Light It Right"" or ""Rebirth"", which all swing heavy roots messages within elephant-pounding and snake-rattling beats, as if Lee Perry had weighted the Black Ark down with a baked dozen of the Arkestra's drummers for his own dub-roots masterpiece, Super Ape. Over the manifold pounding of hand drums, crisp cymbals, and other peripheral clops, Brooks blows a spiritual fire that reiterates the group chants and the parallel themes of Rastafarianism happening elsewhere in the island's music. ""Lambs Bread Collie"" and ""Sabasi"" have as much in common with Lonnie Liston Smith's early 70s head explorations on Astral Traveling or Charles Mingus' experimental Cumbia and Jazz Fusion as they do with those tough Studio One tracks: the horn lines ride shakers, congas, bird calls, and basslines that thud from deep in the jungle foliage to enlightenment. To show how universal they were getting down there, there are even added dashes of Latino, mid-era funk, and disco (?!) beats on tracks like ""Sabebe"" and ""Africa"". Adding another twist are the Ethiopian scales that Brooks was infatuated with at the time. Woven into songs like ""Sabayindah"", ""Song for my Father"" and ""Sly Mongoose"", the scale imparts a snaky surface on the melodies that slithers between the smoky polyrhythms that seem so familiar yet sound so new. Despite some of the most unfriendly paper packaging I have yet to come across (my disc was already marred beyond belief upon breaking the seal), this record still ties together the variegated threads of the world's music in a way that only true dreads can.","I feel sorry for a guy like Stephen Hawking.

Good 2 Go,Elephant Man,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce6c0084474cd0c2ba9/1:1/w_160/c79157fa.jpg,2003-12-08 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2895-good-2-go/,VP,"Seemingly falling from the sky a few years ago, Jamaica's Elephant Man almost single-handedly generated an underground renaissance for the dormant dancehall scene, refueling the public's interest with a frantic mix of jubilant synth and street-smart patois. Now, in a world where dancehall wouldn't sound out of place in a Carnival cruise line ad, Elephant Man unmasks himself to the masses with his widest-ever commercial release, Good 2 Go. To those unfamiliar with his work, O'Neil Bryan's hard lisp, ball-bearing flow and ridiculous rhythmic power amalgamates his own brand of dance music that not only tastefully borrows 80s rock choruses for rhyme schemes, but also accounts for his own personality. If Sean Paul is our generation's Shabba Ranks, Elephant Man is the incumbent to Bounty Killer's throne: he screams, coughs, chants and most amusingly, compounds his own private collection of asides-- ranging from common acknowledgements (""Yep!"", ""Okay!"") to skewed slang terminology (""Shizzle!"", ""Let's dance!"", ""Good to go!""). No one else could've made this album, regardless of the commonality of the riddims chosen. Conceptually, Good 2 Go breaks very little ground: Elaborating on the common bad-man lifestyle, insulting assailants of his character, and detailing the measures he'll take to receive various methods of copulation (""Apply the pressure, make she choke and cough/ Next time, watch your dark half"") are the order of the day. But in the case of dancehall reggae, you've come to the game to watch the mascot jump through a ring of fire, not to see a triple play, and Bryan is as gifted a showman as you're likely to find in the genre today; his mastery over chorus and bridge explains his immediate draw to the club crowd, while his constantly evolving flow barrels from expedient machine gun to labored somersault bounce with little-to-no difficulty. With his humorous anecdotes and distinctive voice, there's reason he's become the hottest commodity in the commercial hip-hop world. ""Wine Up Yuh Self/Head Gone"" stomps and claps into the scene with a heavy array of bass drum hits, violent chants (""Bring them, we choppa off they head!"") and island bongos. The show is ultimately driven by Elephant Man's powerful choruses, seamlessly shifting from a rhythmic plea of insanity (""No, I ain't got no head"") to a suggestion for dancefloor acrobatics (""Do it like a genie, wine up yourself""). In a club scene with lazy commercial rap awkwardly lurching through speakers and identity-confused R&B; acts pleading for acceptance, Elephant Man's straightforward party assault is refreshing. Production is a less-than-balanced affair. With the majority of the production done by dancehall mainstays Vendetta, Baby G and the Blake brothers, it's hard to not notice sameness in Elephant Man's style of beat. Despite this, the disc is packed with standouts: the time-delay claps, muted cymbal crashes, register bells and ""Tequila""-style guitar of ""Real Gangstas""; the dizzy fainting synth and jungle drum set of ""Fuck U Sign""; and the incredible Surprise riddim's background chants, dark synth hues and grinding low end on ""Jamaica"". Only a few offerings truly disappoint, notably Lil' Jon's out of place inclusion ""Jook Gal"" and the obviously commercialized light synth treatment of ""Cock Up Your Bumper"". With a glut of boring non-dancehall guest performers (no Kiprich? Vybz Kartel?), a lack of Elephant Man's most triumphant riddim disc offerings (notably missing are the spidery galleon cannonball creep of ""Gyal Alone We Love"" and the staggering flaming synth ring and Eastern bounce of ""Show Me""), a lame ""Bumper"" remix and a repetitive nature inherent in both production and content, the otherwise stellar Good 2 Go must be docked a few points. Still, while many dancehall proponents opting for either full-on commercial intermingling or hardline dancehall sensibility, Elephant Man is one of few artists in the field that can hold his own on either side of the battlefield.","Seemingly falling from the sky a few years ago, Jamaica's Elephant Man almost single-handedly generated an underground renaissance for ...

Streetcore,Joe StrummerThe Mescaleros,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58e5e6ef95969320b1e/1:1/w_160/e3c412f7.gif,2003-12-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7540-streetcore/,Epitaph,"The only thing more potentially demonizing for a music critic to cover than charity records are posthumous albums from once legendary musicians. Most of the time these records either pale in comparison to the quality of the artists' earlier work, or prove to be incredibly sentimental mortality-pondering affairs. Furthermore, given that the artist is dead, picking out the weaknesses of their final contributions to the music listening public at large seems rather heartless, and more to the point, unnecessary. The job of the music critic is already unfairly viewed as a predatory position; no reviewer in his right mind would want to be accused of picking on the dead. The way most critics seem to go about reconciling this rather unfortunate occupational hazard is by dishing out undeserved laudatory acclaim for these predominantly lackluster releases, which allows a perfect in for critics to eulogize about the great contributions that so-and-so musician once doled out to the world. Most importantly, though, this critical approach unfairly presents a very illusory and all-too tidy closure to creative lives that rarely seem to get wrapped up in such convenient Hollywood endings. It's in this mired context that Joe Strummer's fourth and regrettably final solo release (excluding the Walker soundtrack), Streetcore, presents itself as somewhat of a posthumous album oddity. Given that Strummer's death last December from a heart attack came entirely unexpected, Streetcore brims with previously untraveled aesthetic directions, bittersweetly forward-gazing lyrics, and most of all, the overwhelmingly celebratory insurgence of rock 'n' roll-- decidedly not the trappings of pondering mortality. Ironically, it's a record that refuses to acknowledge endings; the album's aesthetics are an inconsistent but moving string of conflated genres, including rocksteady, dub, blues and folk, that thankfully avoid the hokey world-music-influenced pitfalls of Strummer's previous solo outings. So, while the record fails at living up to the hyperbolic critical proclamations of London Calling's second coming, it does make for a pretty decent, if somewhat unexpected, sweat-soaked finale for The Clash's legendary golden boy. The record opens with its greatest moment; ""Coma Girl"" is a wildly exuberant blast of telecaster majesty whose seething, stripped-down production (courtesy of Mescaleros Martin Slattery and Scott Shield) provides a vital injection of youthful crunch. Though a fairly standard 4/4 rocker in spirit, it manages to equally evoke Allen Ginsberg, Jimmy Cliff, and the Rolling Stones. The nostalgic romp ""Arms Aloft"" offers a possible explanation for Strummer's brazen return to his rock 'n' roll roots: Over a din of sneering guitar licks and rollicking percussion, he finds solace in his glory days with a fist-raising chorus whose mantra goes, ""Just when you were thinkin' of slinkin' down, I'm gonna pull you up, I'm gonna pull you down/ May I remind you of that scene, we were arms aloft in Aberdeen!"" One of the most surprising aspects of Streetcore is that whenever Strummer indulges these Jamaican influences, the results are less than noteworthy-- which is saying something for a man who historically helped merge the worlds of reggae and punk rock. For instance, the unabashedly rocksteady backdrop of the anti-capitalist plea ""Get Down Moses"" comes off more like No Doubt than Rockers, even while Strummer drops some well-intended lyrical musings. The instrumental ""Midnight Jam"" reaches for the echoing, hallucinatory highs of dub, but instead presents a laconic guitar vamp, startlingly bereft of any murky reverberated beauty. And then there's the worst offender: Strummer's cover of the Bob Marley classic ""Redemption Song"". It pains me to say that this track-- the only one not drawn from the original album sessions, and included by Strummer's widow Luce for what are most likely sentimental reasons-- verges on comedy. The song may have been recorded with the best of intentions as an ideal showcase for Strummer's love of reggae and folk, but Rick Rubin's spare production only leaves room for Strummer to make a fool of himself affecting a thick Marley patois for lines like, ""Oh, pirates, yes they rob I."" If Streetcore fails to serve as the groundbreaking solo manifesto that critics had hoped for, it's of no consequence. The real marvel of the album is that it serves as an ideal document of one of rock's greatest, most diverse individuals. As Joe hauntingly sings on the record's sublime country-flavored closer, a cover of a Bobby Charles tune retitled ""Silver and Gold"": ""I'm gonna go out dancing, I'm gonna see the city lights/ And do everything silver and gold, I got to hurry up before I get too old."" Streetcore is proof that Strummer indeed lived it up ""silver and gold"" on record, and probably still is wherever he might be today.",,6.9,
Wandering as Water,Chris Brokaw,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44613d1975652138c94/1:1/w_160/7adfa5d5.gif,2003-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1097-wandering-as-water/,Return to Sender,"One of the most overlooked gems of the past year, Chris Brokaw's second solo full-length showcases the songwriter's commitment to dreamy Americana and stunning acoustic explorations. An installment in the German label Normal's exclusive Return to Sender series-- which among its 40+ titles includes limited-edition LPs by U.S. Saucer, Townes van Zandt, Steve Wynn, and Barbara Manning-- the record is limited to 2,000 copies. I'd like to think it's the modest press run that's conspired to keep Wandering as Water a secret; more likely, though, the subtle tones of Brokaw's craft lack the bells needed to attract a critical catchphrase or youth-market angle. Suffice to say: He oughta be a star. The original drummer for seminal NYC slowcore band Codeine, Brokaw co-founded Come with Thalia Zedek and played guitar for the Boston band until its demise. He's also played his six-string with Steve Wynn and knocked out a beat for post-Bedhead rockers, The New Year. He currently handles guitar in Consonant with Clint Conley of Mission of Burma and collaborates with Evan ""Don't Call It a Comeback"" Dando. Despite the pedigree, Brokaw inhabits an unassuming, almost anonymous space with his quiet acoustic strums, warm voice, wordy vocal lines, and single foot-tapped tambourine. Like his previous all-instrumental Red Cities (2002), this largely vocal offering creeps along an unadorned path towards anachronistic purity, opening up and gathering detail with each repeated listen. Recorded live, it's breezy and intensely focused, and though at times the songs get awkward and seem ready to fall apart, Brokaw hems disparate sections together, allowing the overall passages to flow crisply into smooth resolutions. Somewhat backwards looking (in an especially effective way), these fifteen tracks include a spate of older material. The splintery, patient acoustic interpretations of Come's ""Shoot Me First"", ""Recidivist"" and ""German Song"" are gorgeous. ""My Idea"", a track he wrote with Lemonheads collaborator Tom Morgan that ended up on Dando's Baby I'm Bored, stands out as better enunciated and intoned than Dando's slacker version. Near-sacred covers of 60s troubadour Fred Neil's ""Ba-Di-Da"" and Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey"" do what good covers should, pointing towards inspirations while offering an entrance into further, worthwhile listening. Of the nine new compositions, the prairie instrumentals are especially strong, each evoking a well-drawn visual sequence. ""La Playa"" and ""Calimoxcho"" tackle subtle rhythmic variations, evoking at times the pace of a silent but emphatic one-step across the damp hay of a darkened barn or a jangling horse ride through the night to a dozing loved one. Over its course, ""Dresden Promenade"" accrues the pathos of a badly attended Veteran's Day parade or a lonely prom's last dance. The album's closer, ""The Fields"", wrangles a distorted ambience, a frantic chase, country-noir. Brokaw's slide and finger plucks should especially interest fans of M. Ward and, more so, John Fahey. Though the newly penned vocal works aren't as successful, there are standouts. ""Cranberries"" avoids its initial leanings towards ""Scarborough Fair"", lighting into a sleepless territory that breathes ramshackle blues into the patter of repetitious guitar outbursts. Likewise, the anger in ""My Confidante"" shifts to a transcendent chorus reminiscent of something Robert Pollard would've written for Bee Thousand: ""Staring hard and fast/ High on the overpass/ Spoken in our defense/ Spoken in confidence."" Here, the tambourine picks up like a gust of wisteria, leading the song into a maze. Brokaw continuously dances nimbly through these sorts of unexpected shifts; his acuity with control and complexity creates a subtle, unspoken poetry.

Friendship,Frenemies,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7fea9e61561daa78de/1:1/w_160/1958ada5.jpg,2003-12-07 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3281-friendship/,Morphius,"Frenemies is the solo project of Chris Freeland, drummer for that furiously algebraic band that spawned a thousand college-town lessers, the Oxes. Which means that Frenemies crawls across the hallowed sod lain by past drummer branch-outs, i.e. the careers of the Foo Fighters, Sparrow, Phil Collins, Gary Young, Charlie Watts, and Ringo Starr. Those who prefer to describe the Oxes' output in the lingo of car-porn (""high octane,"" ""full throttle"") should be warned that Frenemies' music is an ounce more fanciful and diverse than that of Freeland's other combo. The weirdness of Baltimore informs this disc's tonelessness, spontaneity, and incoherence. The listener imagines the scene there as a clandestine commune; bands must sneak into their stuffy art spaces, darting past Orioles scalpers, tiptoeing around urban chickens, and creeping past the corner bars where a Redskins doo-rag can either get you beaten up or felt up. How can such duress not lead to arrested development, or worse, batting-cage hissyfits? How do Baltimore artists grow past a fascination with wigs, boogers, and bicycles? This album's title track wails, tellingly, ""I'm not a friend, why should I be/ I got all my friends in Baltimore here with me,"" and later, ""I've got all my friends from high school here with me."" Friendship drifts like a nitrous zeppelin, from after-school punk, to noodly art-flux, to interesting anti-rap, to splendid loner-pop. I assume that Freeland designed every sound here, except for the happy-hour choir parts, the female vox that kick off ""Moving Day"", and the rhymes of Bow & Arrow (though I have to believe that Cex, listed as a ""Frenemy"" in the liner notes, served as a consultant for the heinous flow on the ""hip-hop"" tracks-- which, to their credit, always feature elegantly pimpy key loops). A creative mania compensates for Freeland's half-hearted genre-splicing; fans of the one-take (pre-Geffen) Beck may fawn, as could proponents of Space Needle's analog blasts and ironic wanderscapes. ""Big 4 You"" is the funkiest keeper, about vowing to disinter up a buried-alive companion, even if the speaker's fingernails break. ""Love"", meanwhile, is the disc's best manifestation of post-Tortoise xerox-jazz, pumping like an autistic opus penned by Jaco Pastorius' ghost through the lovable contraption from both Short Circuits. Baltimore is America's cluttered attic, and Freeland's freeform songs are tossing some of the junk into the sideyard. The weak singing limits the proceedings somewhat; think Callaci from Refrigerator, or Beaujon from Eggs. The Rapture and Hot Hot Heat, et cetera, may be getting the dancefloor scuffed with their rangeless frontmen, but the persistence of Thom Yorke and the emergence of The Darkness' Justin Hawkins are raising the bar beyond even Freddy Mercury's operatic stunt-pipes. ""Step 1"" may offer DFA-worthy old-school skreeback, but this release knows that it's ultimately as ethereal as SARS. Frenemies just want to hang out.","Frenemies is the solo project of Chris Freeland, drummer for that furiously algebraic band that spawned a thousand college-town lessers ...

Lost and Found: Hip-Hop Underground Soul Classics,Pete Rock,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2efc0084474cd0c016b/1:1/w_160/0a4309cd.gif,2003-12-07 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6902-lost-and-found-hip-hop-underground-soul-classics/,Rapster,"The year was 1992. It was a time when Yo! MTV Raps would broadcast its irreverent brand of an early hip-hop DIY aesthetic into millions of bedrooms across the globe. It was a time when a five-mic review in a fledgling rap journal called The Source meant more than your record label making a check out to Benzino. It was a time when up and coming legends like Gang Starr would release career defining albums (Daily Operation) and a slew of fresh faces would soon after drop incendiary landmark debuts (In '93: Wu-Tang, Black Moon; In '94: Biggie, Nas). Most importantly though, 1992 was the year when a young duo named Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth flooded the airwaves with their rousing jazz-laced elegy, ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"". Featuring a remarkably agile and sincere vocal delivery from C.L. Smooth, and Pete Rock dropping haunting strands of interweaving horn melodies, stabbing sax blurts and a smooth snare-driven groove, ""T.R.O.Y."" would become one of the most stirring and beloved hip-hop songs of all time. Only two years later, the duo would call it quits, and though C.L. Smooth would seldom be heard from again, Pete Rock's foggy jazz-infused production would give birth to millions of imitators (if little commercial success). Though the legendary four-year period spanning 1992-1996 served as one of hip-hop's most creatively inspired eras, the music business was, at the time, completely clueless as to the genre's profitability and artistic value. The industry's prevailing ignorance over hip-hop (epitomized by the Wu-Tang lyric, ""Who's your A&R;, a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?"") meant that, along with the many landmark albums that hit record store shelves, an ungodly amount of potential rap classics never got to see the light of day: Large Professor, for example, instructed listeners to ""buy my album when I drop it,"" on A Tribe Called Quest's ""Keep It Rollin'""-- and almost ten years later we're still waiting for its release. So hip-hop aficionados worldwide should tip their collective throwback jerseys to the British beat-centric label BBE for rescuing some of Pete Rock's finest mid-90s production moments from a death in obscurity. Collected here, in their entirety are two forgotten Pete Rock-produced gems: InI's Center of Attention and Deda's The Original Baby Pa. The infamously bootlegged Center of Attention, with its relentless, jaw-dropping sequence of solid instrumentals, is the real showstopper. ""Think Twice"" bounces by on a choppy bed of sublimely looped piano chords, guitar stabs, and a hazy, meditative Black Moon-influenced drum break. Tracks like ""Step Up"" and ""Fakin' Jax"" fare even better, all piano melodies submerged in a thick fog of sub-aquatic vapor, while armies of shimmering horns slice through the substantial haze in intoxicating loops. Additionally, a track like ""To Each His Own"" (which features guest spots from Q-Tip and Large Professor), with its drizzling vibe notes and flurrying horns seems to sonically billow open from out of the speaker fabric, like a dense trail of weed smoke swelling from out of the tip of a blunt only to be diffused in the surrounding air. But while the instrumentals on Deda's The Original Baby Pa are similarly inspired to the ones found on Center of Attention, both albums showcase a problem that's plagued Pete Rock's career from day one: the quality of his beats consistently overshadows the quality of his emcees' rhymes. It's no coincidence that 2001's instrumental affair, Petestrumentals, was one of Rock's greatest moments. On the Deda track ""Blah Uno"", Pete cooks up a dizzying brew of swirling horns, radiating, woofer-friendly bass notes, and the irresistible boom-bap of snare cracks and galloping ride cymbals only for Deda to inanely spit, ""Blah Uno here to put suckers in the mix/ The music was fixed for me to bust wild dicks."" While on ""No More Words"", InI's three members (Rob-O, Grap Luva, and Pete Rock himself) kick undeniably smooth verses with easygoing group chemistry bereft of any lasting inspired insight. Furthermore, a track like ""Markd4Death"" may showcase a debonair instrumental of pensively unraveling Rhodes notes, but Deda's predictable gangsterisms and humdrum threats sound about as moving as the drone of a computer fan. The glory of the early 90s will always hold a special place in the hearts of hip-hop listeners far and wide; they were the adolescent years before bling killed the urban anti-star. Of course, even while hip-hop fans are proverbially salivating like Pavlov's dogs for a planned Rock reunion with original partner-in-crime C.L. Smooth (and a possible sequel to 1998's Soul Survivor), Lost & Found's unearthed treasures provide an ideal soundtrack for nostalgia while successfully building anticipation for future material.","The year was 1992.

Mutant Disco,Various Artists,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80db1335d7bf16991b5/1:1/w_160/13f24984.jpg,2003-12-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2028-mutant-disco/,ZEZE,"""Mutant disco"" doesn't accurately describe the genre that, in the early 80s, lunged out of ZE Records, hit the UK Top 10, and dissipated into respectable obscurity for fifteen years. Mutant disco was not a genetic fluke in the disco DNA. As the squadrons of recent reparative 80s NY compilations attest, it was exactly the opposite: a small clubhouse of brash intellectuals, avant-garde crackpots, and underground flotsam calculatedly engineering a disco insurrection. They (post-punk, no-wave, new wave, post-wave) brought the disco; the disco didn't come to them. The assumption here is that the only thing weirder than being weird is being partially weird. Going from the most outsider music possible to the most polished, mainstream sound smacks of an audacity we can barely comprehend. To list only a few of the credentials: James Chance was on the original No New York comp; Bill Laswell's Material featured Sonny Sharrock and Fred Frith; and Was (Not Was) littered their early singles with stream-of-consciousness surreal rants. To bring things into the present, this would be an event equal to Jim O'Rourke being produced by The Matrix. By any account, this merger should clear the dancefloor faster than Shaq's DJing skillz. On this two-disc reissue of the original 1981 comp (effectively quadrupling the number of tracks), any hesitation is erased in the first moments of Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out"". The great surge of generic disco hi-hat releases a flittering confetti of tin-foil synths. Jagged god-rawk garage feedback bides its time in the recesses of the track until it's propelled forward with punk rock slashes courtesy of the MC5's Wayne Kramer and pistonsful of Latin jazz. Even the lyrics skip along the thin line between naked pleasure-party and obscure psychopathy: ""No one's discouraged by you who never push the wheels. You did it. And I'm next."" You can be a street urchin or a glam princess: This irrepressible beast of a song will, at the very least, make you the most popular person alive and may very well make for the sort of nights that, in appropriate temperatures, cause some people to become pregnant. Material's collaboration with ex-Labelle member Nona Hendryx stacks crepitating basslines with entire battalions of gradually digitized guitars lost in their own egomania. Kid Creole's hit, ""Annie, I'm Not Your Daddy"", sticks five genres that would be sublime easy listening by themselves and networks them until they take on a sonic glory, busking cuicas and crashing cymbals. Paternity tests have never been quite this riotous before. And never mind that James White's ""Contort Yourself"" is to 80s NY compilations as ""Happy Together"" is to 60s Summer-of-Love ones. The rockabilly avant-jazz version of The Contortions' version is here streamlined and put on dubs with a life-changing beat and enough reckless sax to let you know this band came to disco and can leave at will. The ZE supergroup, The Aural Exciters, begins ""Spooks in Space"" with the utterly unimpeachable line, ""Mama say there'll be days like this.. but she ain't say nothin' 'bout SPOOKS!"" and forms a song out of bubbling potions, banana pratfall sound effects, and haunted dancehall trepidation. A personal favorite is Cristina, a neglected diva that's alternately complacent and histrionic. Her version of ""Drive My Car"" renders the Hollywood dazzle of the lyrics even more playfully vacuous than the original. She sounds like a hollow shell of a ditzy bombshell in a car that refuses to conform to certain air pollution laws. ""Blame It on Disco"" has a lurching bass and a brass reggae pace, but for some reason there's also gales of sleet and when the swelled strings and backup singers tell us to ""blame it on disco with a fascinating sound/ That's the talk of the town,"" it's somehow hard to not think of a coke-snorting Rogers & Hammerstein. ""Disco Clone"" is absolute mayhem: blaxploitating rumble and Bernard Hermann dagger thrusts with a refrain that's pitched so high my windows broke because the dogs ran into them. Also, it's a disco song with the word ""sauntering"" in it. I can die happy. This is the tip of the iceberg. For a genre that often encompasses some of the most flagrantly irritating music this side of ragtime, there is such diversity here, from hewn guitar pyrotechnics to lilting bossa nova, two hours isn't hardly enough. We have hit the day when disco made a better double album than Pink Floyd. It just goes to show that two (or more) genres don't need any similarities except hedonism, narcissism, and drug abuse.

The Meter Glows,National Eye,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9609d034d5c69bf51e7/1:1/w_160/83b5d46a.jpg,2003-12-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5885-the-meter-glows/,Feel,"Plenty of post-rock players are preemptively pegged as spacey, or explained with loads of meaningless math-based metaphors. However, Philadelphia's National Eye embody galactic mystery in a way that's pretty undeniable: prickly and dissonant, The Meter Glows, National Eye's eerie-but-warm full-length debut, mimics the sound of a band blindly pinging about the universe and bouncing off of planets as it spirals, satellite-style, further and further into space. The band's embrace of big, atmospheric oddities (including any and all internal discrepancies-- check their unexpected style-hops from track to track) doesn't necessarily mean that The Meter Glows is destined to sit perpetually out of reach, or even that the album will feel especially chilling to listeners. Flitting from Lips-ish psych to country strumming to spectral, vacant whispers, the record packs its own quirky charm (see their surprisingly pitchy croons and a few overtly sentimental lyrics), and a generous slathering of melodic shimmer. In a way, the album's greatest achievement is that it makes discordance sound so endlessly inviting. The Meter Glows is also a stylistically surprising album. National Eye are tricky to pin down because they pull from many contemporary sources, but take their root influences second-hand. They offer a fresh re-reinterpretation of an adventurous rock canon (ranging from Pink Floyd to Wire), as opposed to another rote mimicry. The approach may sound confounded, but the results are pleasantly surprising: opener ""I Ran Into Him"" is a sweeping start, with rushing vocals, inching closer, and distorted guitar noodling layered over crackling amp fuzz. The folky ""Dracula's Always with Me"" mixes a timid piano line with twinkling, effects-heavy guitar, while ""Just a Dream"" starts with a handful of yawning effects and settles into a sliding, earthy lament featuring all vocals, drums and tiny bits of bass and guitar. National Eye may wholeheartedly embrace post-rock moodiness, but they stubbornly (and nobly) avoid soaking everything in a dulling puddle of drone. On the contrary, the instrumentation here is distinct. The band wields their arsenal of noise carefully, and with high regard to traditional songcraft; consequently, many of these songs are as memorable as they are abstract. Mixed by producer Thom Monahan (Silver Jews, Pernice Brothers, Beachwood Sparks), The Meter Glows boasts other interesting sounds-- from organ and e-bow to creaking synths and muted microphones-- and the final collage is almost enough to make you want to teeter outside in your headphones, granting the record the kind of celestial context it requests.","Plenty of post-rock players are preemptively pegged as spacey, or explained with loads of meaningless math-based metaphors.

Afro Finger and Gel,Mu,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c445ea9e61561daa80f1/1:1/w_160/98308b20.jpg,2003-12-04 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5561-afro-finger-and-gel/,OutputTigersushi,"About midway through ""Chair Girl"", Japan's Mutsumi Kanamori, the wife half of Sheffield-based duo Mu, creeks out the maxim that ""DJs are a rock band,"" while her husband, Baltimorean Maurice Fulton, whips Model 500 basslines around submarine alarms and a dubbed-out salsa beat. It all makes sense for a second, until I re-read the lyrics and realize that she's actually saying: ""Deejays are rocked by an electric chair girl."" I misunderstand her, but the two impressions, be they of a dancefloor-manifesto or the sensual-personal, are both extremes that get delved into on the couple's debut, Afro Finger and Gel. Hers is the heavily-FX'd split personalities; his is the manic approach to beat-chopping that swallows up classic Chicago house, second-line whistles, digital uprisings, even Cubano instrumentation; and together, the couple have birthed one bizarre, brilliant album. Over a hairy squelch, ""Jealous Kids"" opens as damning and acerbic as LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"", berating hipsters with lines like, ""Insecure kids can't close to me/ Frightened kids can't dance,"" and, ""Bored kids are trying to kick me off/ Are we still high school kids?"" As the beat turns into nasty bleeps and a steel door the size of the Grand Canyon thuds shut on the sweaty masses, Mutsumi flips her vocal presets to the ""Another Brick in the Wall""-style chant-chorus of ""How many days can we life for?/ How many times are we smiling?/ How many people can we know about?/ How many music can we feel to?"" sneering at the onlookers as she morphs into a digital wraith and scares all the kids off the dancefloor with abrasive shrieks. It's all in good fun, though, as ""Let's Get Sick"" coughs up Liquid Liquid's leftfield lugies at a ferocious pace with a full minute of air-raid sirens before Mu's processed voice gets beamed down to walk on Yoko Ono's thin ice, cracking cold cowbells and ice-picking timbales with each four on the floor. She barks direct orders about being positive and calling in sick to work so that she and her man can lay about all day, puffing on a spliff. She even goes so far as to rhyme ""we feel each others' bodies"" with ""kisses to my oranges,"" which is ticklish enough, but then proceeds to go doot-doot ahhhhhh like Stereolab used to do, before snapping out of her haze with a scream of ""Fuck that!"" The sexual frankness of the title track and ""Hello Bored Biz Man"" isn't as blatantly gaudy as cuts by Peaches or Avenue D, although it's a hundred times more psychotic. Still, no amount of prophylactic protection or chemical inoculation can prepare you for the illness of ""My Name Is Tommi"". Based on a UK television show that pits couples against each other, Mutsumi simultaneously plays the cheating boyfriend, the hysterical girlfriend, the announcer, and the Jawa-voiced host while the entire set is destroyed around them, their personas melting into an icky id-mess that wallows in the nastiest, most petulant part of human nature, complete with commercial breaks for its viewers/listeners. The last half of the album embeds the most enlightening messages in its manic and intricate beats. ""Tell You Something"" strangles a late-era Funkadelic lick over what could be the ""Billie Jean"" beat, while Mu shouts over a rubbery bassline that ""Jealousy doesn't give you anything/ Let's change the way people think.../ Make a revolution to yourself."" I start to believe her as her voice distorts into a Kelis-like tongue lashing over a pole-axed break of broken Afro-Cuban percussion and flickering glitches. She explains her predicament further: ""I tried to be nice to everyone/ I said yes to everything/ Contradiction was getting bigger in my mind/ I found a lot difference between what I said and what I think."" Appropriating the melody of Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime"" for ""Destroying Human Nature"", Mutsumi's voice gets ""screwed"" down to a slurred baritone as she plaintively wonders, ""Do you have anyone who can comfort you?/ Drugs, money, fame.../ Too many things can destroy human nature.../ I really hope you don't let yourself to lose them."" For what will most likely be played out on the dancefloor, it's a weird question to ask the revelers and ravers, the anorexic models and fashionable kids. 2003 might go down as a year in which some rock records learned how to dance (Electric Six, !!!, The Rapture, Ssion) and some dance records learned to rock (Basement Jaxx, T. Raumschmiere, Fat Truckers), but Afro Finger and Gel straddles the diametrically opposed genres obliviously, not giving a fuck. It lashes out at the p(r)etty people with their limited vision, imploring them to put aside their differences and encouraging everyone to be true to themselves (and their humanity) above all, either between two people or between the sheets. Simultaneously fun and dark, ludicrous and serious, it's a fucked-up and uplifting record. ""So we are only human/ Misunderstand each other,"" Mu confesses at one point, and the message is undeniable, even if it's a bit hard to make out.","About midway through ""Chair Girl"", Japan's Mutsumi Kanamori, the wife half of Sheffield-based duo Mu ...

Car Paint Scheme,Req,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25c13d1975652138855/1:1/w_160/b73e5b52.jpg,2003-12-04 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6761-car-paint-scheme/,Warp,"How minimal is too minimal? British hip-hop kid Req is a minimalist, though he's not a student of Philip Glass and doesn't know or care about microsound. What Req is about is beats, with every trace of meat and gristle gnawed off. He wants to see how little he can leave inside his raw, repetitive loops and keep people interested. He'll take a drum break or an 808 pattern and let it run solo longer than just about anyone outside of a break record compiler. Req's second album for Warp consists of tracks selected by pal Damian Harris, boss of his former label Skint. Some tracks were created specifically for the new album; some have been lying around for several years. Roughly half the record is strictly rough-and-ready breaks. ""Ry Drum I"" is total trash funk, with a booming loop that sounds like it was recorded in a shed behind Fred Sanford's house. The only accouterment comes from a squelchy bass synth and a cheap organ, and they play about three notes between them. ""Worthing Line"" swaps the sampler for a drum machine, lets the programmed beat play essentially untouched for almost five minutes (save a couple of fills) and adds a few eerie chords. ""Rhythm 77"", amazingly, makes do with even less for much of its length, with only a faint ghost of synth chords occasionally creeping in between the beats. Car Paint Scheme, like its immediate predecessor, Sketchbook, is a grab bag, and the rest of the record is fleshed out with other styles. It's not completely instrumental: Two tracks have some cockney spitting from Kid Acne. His throwback style fits the music well and, of course, Req gives him plenty of room to breath, supplementing his beats with turntable scratching. ""Train Jam"" is built around the kind of old funk guitar riff that makes you want to track the original down, and unlike the bulk of the record its mood is sunny and bright. The beat on ""Runout Scratches"" sounds built from what the title implies, connecting Req with the long line of turntable artists who have fetishized surface noise. Incredibly, Req makes his naked rhythms work most of the time. There's nothing mind-blowing about the music by any stretch, but the minimal beatscapes manage somehow to evoke a desolate, broken down street scene. Perhaps he's tapping into our collective memory of graffiti documentaries, the images of colorful walls set against decay that's inevitably accompanied by old school hip-hop soundtracks. But there's something uncanny about how enjoyable these simplistic, looped rhythms can be. You should, of course, be doing something else while this plays, though, because these tracks won't likely hold all your attention. Despite the praise he deserves for doing so much with so little, Car Paint Scheme is ultimately a bit flat and one dimensional, the sort of thing you put on very occasionally when the mood strikes.","How minimal is too minimal?

Darts of Pleasure EP,Franz Ferdinand,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7cea9e61561daa78da/1:1/w_160/a876c7fb.jpg,2003-12-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3278-darts-of-pleasure-ep/,Domino,"My list of anxiously anticipated debut full-lengths just doubled in size; I've scratched Franz Ferdinand's name right under TV on the Radio's, folded it twice, and shoved it back into my desk drawer next to my weekly to-do-list and the old address book I've been meaning to fill up for ages. The Glasgow quartet may not yet shoulder the same weight of expectation garnered by early Strokes or Interpol EPs, but based on what I'm hearing here, I'm guessing Santa won't be missing their house come late December. Given only five tracks to work with-- two of them being home demo recordings, and the latter of these an encore to the disc's first single and opening title track-- the band has as many viable future trajectories as it does sonic resemblances. ""Darts of Pleasure"" is a bombastically truncated nod to all things indie/electro/new wave. Strikingly Interpolian as they lunge in alongside a healthy drum clip, jagged guitar, and a hardboiled bassline Alex Kapranos' morose-chic vocals are coy but cool: ""You are the devil that sells a line of dark fantastic passion."" It's a line of modern-baroque recollection the band tightropes for the whole act. Synths filter in for the second verse before the song drops off to a quick-sting bass-and-drum interlude before swirling all its ingredients back in for an everyone-in-the-studio-we're-German singalong, ""Ich heisse superfantastiche!"" Outstanding. ""Van Tango"" is a glam testament to why Franz Ferdinand were a perfect fit for sharing the stage with Hot Hot Heat and Interpol on recent tours, as it meshes the disparate elements and better parts of both acts into a stew of snappy jubilance; too content not to be cool and too cool to be content, it jangles its way through the peppiest of apathetic musing as it discusses the life of its nominal night-walking neo-vampire hipster. ""Shopping for Blood"" could well be the new post-Rocky Horror Picture Show party anthem-- sporting a sock-hop goth-gallop and a ""Monster Mash"" narrative, it's more glam than gore. On ""Tell Her Tonight"", the band lets a little Kinks/Beatles-meets-electro-indie slip out. However, I can only surmise that the reason for the inclusion of the demo version of ""Darts of Pleasure"" was to show that the band is not The Strokes, but could wear the costume for Halloween if they wished. Stripped of their razor sharp production, this is what's left. But by then it doesn't matter, I already had my pen out.

Don't Forget to Boogie,Tetuzi Akiyama,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17fc0084474cd0bfe02/1:1/w_160/211b00e2.gif,2003-12-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/416-dont-forget-to-boogie/,Idea,"If you know guitarist Tetuzi Akiyama, it's probably as one of the forefront players in modern Japanese improvisation. Along with Taku Sugimoto, Toshimaru Nakamura and Otomo Yoshihide, Akiyama has helped shaped the sound of Onkyo with his guitar-- in a scene largely heralded for its use of electronics, these musicians' use of a much more traditionally ""rock"" instrument shouldn't go unnoticed. Furthermore, along with Nakamura, Akiyama organizes a monthly ""meeting"" at the Off Site venue in Tokyo wherein many of the world's most interesting improvisers collaborate in a series of electro-acoustic performances. The third CD compilation of these performances was recently released, and will be of interest to anyone into modern improv and experimental electronic music. Now, all of that said, DON'T FORGET TO BOOGIE!!! Sorry, I just had to spit that out. Despite a CV that might lead you to believe Akiyama wouldn't be caught dead listening to a classic rock station, he sees fit to issue his third solo album as something of a tribute to the electric blooze of acts like Canned Heat, Led Zeppelin and John Lee Hooker. Don't Forget is a straight solo performance of riffs, licks and grease that would make Billy Gibbons jealous and European festival organizers scratch their heads in bewilderment. Where other infamous Japanese guitarists like Keiji Haino or Makoto Kawabata use their infatuation with hard rock to inform apocalyptic freakouts, Akiyama is content to play the kind of music that you might hear in a Louisiana dive late at night, after all the drunk cowboys have gone home and only the drunker barflies are left to give their respects to the blues. In some way, Akiyama's record (vinyl only, of course) is a very clichéd notion of preserving an outdated model of authentic rock expression. In another way, it's a stone, hypnotic jam. Opener ""It's a Boogie Thing"" will have the hardline improv-geeks running for the hills, but all you closet ZZ Top fans need to go ahead and surrender now. Akiyama's devil-come-runnin' blues shuffle is practically an archetypical soundtrack to cruising Texas two-lane highways in an old pick-up as the sun burns your arm and bugs splatter against the windshield. The minimal, repetitive groove carries on without a care in the world, as if simply sitting back and reveling in the glory of a groove and a $35 amp is the height of sophistication. Tunes like ""Doll House Shakin'"" and ""Dead Or..."" proceed similarly, emphasizing an almost intimidating willingness to do absolutely nothing for minutes at a time other than worship a riff. Not everything is so straightforward. ""She's a B-Girl"" is a pretty rumination on the power of shimmering light as translated by a tremolo'd guitar. Here, Akiyama uses his instrument not so much as a conduit to his rock and blues heroes, but as a paintbrush, crossing stroke after stroke of an impressionist still life. Just as he does on his improvised releases, Akiyama finds a way to make sparse figures add up to much more than the sum of their parts. This is especially the case in the ultra-trance of ""Fast Machine""; you'd be surprised how engaging a single, quickly repeated guitar chord emulating the monolithic pulse of passing highway lane-dividers can be. Akiyama describes Don't Forget to Boogie as his ""ego trip,"" and it's certainly an album that requires some compromise from listeners. For most people, perhaps an album consisting of only solo electric guitar blues-rock wouldn't sound like a must-have, and I'll own up to having been fairly skeptical before hearing it. However, I shouldn't have been surprised to know that good musicians tend to make interesting whatever they try, even when they might trip over their own enthusiasm along the way. Akiyama's ego trip is, at worst, a guilty pleasure, and at best, a carefree cruise into the rock and roll sunset.

One A.M.,Diverse,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5ec0084474cd0c2838/1:1/w_160/b3c49b80.jpg,2003-12-04 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2533-one-am/,Chocolate Ind.,"It's ironic that so many rappers pay lip service to the idea of ""flow""-- especially their own-- while settling for a string of unrelated one-line putdowns. Might all this talk about fluidity be masking a sense of helplessness when it comes to rhythm and phrasing? Are flow-obsessed rappers just dried up? Even as I ask, Diverse wipes the smirk off my mouth. Since his sleepy 2001 debut, the Move EP, the Chicago-based rapper has made a relentless stream of cameo appearances on albums by Rjd2, Prefuse 73, Mos Def, and others. At some point, his style just came together, built around an easy mastery of micro-timing, emphasis, and pitch. Diverse avoids insults, hype and one-liners, but doesn't even need to say anything interesting to get your attention-- his gift lies in a rare kind of self-possessed delivery that could move you hard even without a beat. It's all in his flow. ""A lot of MCs let the rhythm dictate how they rhyme,"" Diverse was recently quoted. ""I'm a poet even before I'm an emcee, which allows me to dictate to the beat."" It's true that Diverse has a poet's gift for turning words-- the abstract, segmented raw materials of daily language-- into a concrete, continuous stream. But I'd go farther: Diverse can make almost any beat better by weaving it through with little darting tendrils of words-made-music, leaving a sparkling trail of associations almost as an afterthought. In this case, he has his work cut out for him, since the production (by Rjd2, Prefuse 73, and Madlib, among others) leaves very little room for improvement. ""Certified"" and ""Uprock"", whose hype hooks pull forward while Rjd2 leans back into a lilting cut, are crowd-movers, pure and simple. The production becomes mercilessly spare on a gritty Vast Aire collaboration, ""Big Game"", where Diverse shows his range by rhyming ""disposable circumference"" with ""pump your fist."" Then Vast Aire tosses red meat into the Can Ox fanclub's cage, dropping: ""I got you thinking I'm an animal/ Kind of like Tarzan but raised by cannibals."" Despite the potential, there's no jungle-of-cities concept here, just a string of rhetorical twists on ""Big Game"". Madlib produces ""Ain't Right"", a decent two-part story-song about sudden death claiming guilty and innocent alike. Diverse can tell a story, we learn, but the increase in continuity is barely noticeable: Flow alone will carry him. ""Jus Biz"", a loose meditation on wealth and livelihood, features the first of three busy, diaphanous Prefuse textures, with trademark distorted Rhodes, vibes, and feminine ooh's backing a loping boom-clip. Diverse fights for space in this environment, but wins. But ""Explosive"", a thorough collaboration with Quannum rapper Lyrics Born, doesn't quite earn its name. When he's really on, Lyrics Born can produce a brilliant flood of phonemes that stays a few steps ahead of any paraphrasable meaning. But here, articulation is his downfall, as a river of unenunciated blabber just makes Diverse's consistent spitting shine all the brighter. In ""Under the Hammer"", Jean Grae's perverse ghetto portraits get a rise out of Diverse, who's at his most arch and bleak. Then, horns reeking of jet fuel, ""747"" flies low with a heavy load of funk, spewing a hazy trail of puff-ups and put-downs. Ill as they are, I just can't believe Diverse means harm, especially after hearing the next track, a nuanced and tonal apology for ""Leaving"" home. I wish I'd left, too; the last track is a forgettable jazz collaboration with Tortoise guitarist Jeff Parker and drummer Ted Sirota. Diverse's delivery is so beguiling that after dozens of listens I have yet to worry about absorbing the content of this album. Maybe that's because there isn't much, and next album, I'll grow impatient with the sheen of his immaculate delivery. For now, I'm still enjoying it: Nothing deep, but all delicious.","It's ironic that so many rappers pay lip service to the idea of ""flow""-- especially their own-- while settling ...

The Amos House Collection III,Various Artists,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fd9d034d5c69bf392e/1:1/w_160/19d8bc3b.jpg,2003-12-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2016-the-amos-house-collection-iii/,Wishing Tree,"While the Rhode Island-based non-profit organization Amos House is inarguably a champion of a worthy cause (providing living essentials to individuals in need), their last two attempts at indie moral appeasement seemed overbearingly dull, if star-studded, affairs. Fortunately, this new double-disc offering fares better, breaking the mind-numbing cycle of compilation blues by presenting a meticulously sequenced collection of new originals, rare demos, B-sides, and previously released tracks from indie-rock standard-bearers such as Wilco, Super Furry Animals, and Spoon. One of The Amos House Collection III's greatest assets is that its contributions, despite that many of its bands are making their second or third appearances on an Amos House comp here, have never sounded so fresh as a unified piece: The two opening tracks from Amos House alumni Emily Sparks and Spoon fit together beautifully. Sparks' ""Find Your Own Fire"" segues into Spoon's invigorating burst of acoustic indie-rock synergy, an early unplugged demo of the Kill the Moonlight standout ""Jonathan Fisk"" that serves as a fantastic counterpoint to the lilting guitar triplets and sweeping melancholy of Sparks' stark opener. But disc one's inspired opening pales in comparison to the sequencing home run of its closing four tracks. Wheat's contribution, ""Long Shadow, USA (Wheat vs. Tim Rutili)"", eschews the overproduced alacrity of their latest record to match its guest guitarist's meandering bursts of distorted urgency with spacey synth lines and a wondrously esoteric, happy vibe. This driving, rhythmic stargazing exercise is flawlessly followed by the seething, distortion-drenched stumble of Califone's cover of the Stones' classic ""Ventilator Blues"". Remarkably, just as Califone's blues-din has driven you to the bottle, the energized lo-fi pop shimmer of Elf Power's ""Evil Eye"", and the swaggering bucolic crunch of the Super Furry Animals rarity ""Foxy Music"" (culled from the hard-to-find International League of Screaming EP) draw the disc to an irresistibly rousing close. Fans seeking any juicy dregs of lush, psych-pop ingenuity from Circulatory System-- the Athens, Georgia clique formerly known as Olivia Tremor Control-- will find much to obsess over on ""Deserts (As Big as a Star)"". The track features a dizzying Eastern-influenced melodic line floating atop crumbling stutter-stop breakbeats and Cullen's smothering nonsensical vocals. Unfortunately, Wilco's contribution, ""Let Me Come Home"", doesn't hold up quite as well. The track feels slightly mired by its gloomy arrangement; wandering brush sticks caress the face of the snare, creating a shifting, disconcerting fog over stumbling minor piano chords and Jeff Tweedy's cracked melodramatic appeals for redemption (sample lyric: ""I'll let my dreams be your escape/ If you'll just let me come home""). It's not bad, but in light of the unusually high standards set by Wilco's previous outstanding work, its status as an outtake could not be clearer. In fact, Wilco's sonic disparity seems rather endemic of the vibe on most of the second disc. Azure Ray's sullen, x-chromosome monotony reigns supreme on the languid ""Lucky Sevens"", while in a blindfold test, Matt Smith's melancholy Rhodes-driven innocence on ""Lay Down in the Leaves"" could pass for just about any of Ida's tender minimal musings. To make matters worse, even a big old Saddle Creek singalong can't stop The Good Life's Tim Kasher from urgently declaring that he's ""lost his direction,"" in the ode to abandonment ""Haunted Homecoming"". Still, despite disc two's drudgery, The Amos House Collection III is a bold step forward for compilations of its ilk. It serves as a strong reminder that even the most diverse collection of great tracks, when sequenced thoughtfully, can coalesce into a unified, listenable whole.","While the Rhode Island-based non-profit organization Amos House is inarguably a champion of a worthy cause (providing living essentials to ...

Dangerous Magical Noise,The Dirtbombs,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5ceb335119a49eca07/1:1/w_160/f58cc774.jpg,2003-12-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2531-dangerous-magical-noise/,In the Red,"As a musical landscape, Detroit is tangled up in mythology: the twitchy legacy of Motown, the ashes of The Stooges, the political caterwauling of John Sinclair and the screeching MC5, the piercing howls of a carnivorous, vine-swinging axman, and the recent commotion kicked up over a brother/sister duo and a loping white rapper. Fold in a handful of press-ready analogies about industry and grime, and a few prosaic portraits of clanging pistons, merciless winters, and honest, pink-faced Americans, and unleash the wordy enigma that is contemporary Detroit. Forced to sacrifice a viable cultural identity for series of one-dimensional, Upton Sinclair-meets-Norman Rockwell-meets-8 Mile clichés, it becomes impossible not to ask: Does Detroit even exist outside the pages of Mojo? Chances are, The Dirtbombs hate that they've become just another notch in the greasy Motor City totem pole (check every White Stripes feature framed by a meaningless Dirtbombs sidebar), but Dirtbombs frontman Mick Collins has Detroit roots that can't be easily overlooked, or at least not anymore: former guitarist for late-80s garage beasts The Gories, Collins has recently been dragged into the very weirdest kind of posthumous regard, with sold-six-copies Gories records suddenly becoming elite status symbols for Detroit-crazed garage-rock revivalists. A crude, pubescent, magnificent mess, The Gories were both a reaction to and an embodiment of the city which spawned them; the band sucked up much-discussed local influences and then promptly spit them back out on the floor, each rock-soul-garage song a half-digested, unrecognizable, and entirely gross hometown homage. Collins' mission with The Dirtbombs is not so different: Dangerous Magical Noise, the band's third full-length (and follow-up to 2001's soul covers record, Ultraglide in Black) quakes with the potential for total implosion, always threatening to completely dissemble itself and leave a tiny pile of gravel behind. That danger-- the menace of possible destruction, or of feeling like this record might never play again because it's just too fragile to hold up-- is also exactly what makes Dangerous Magical Noise so unabashedly glorious. Stubbornly lo-fi and expectedly scrappy, the album is also tremendously listenable, a rhythmic, leg-flailing romp through vintage soul cool, glam boogie, classic rock thrash, and punk bravado. The Dirtbombs boast two drummers (and have recorded with two bass players), but even with all that thumping, the band's backing effort is barely enough to support Collins' wild guitar freakouts and billowing Henrdix-hollers. Opener ""Start the Party"" is as clear an introduction to raucous Detroit stomping as anyone's ever gonna offer, a fuzz-laden Kick Out the Jams promise that, while breeze-blowing powerful, doesn't readily admit to the band's capacity for subtle tinkering. The rollicking blues-rocker ""F.I.D.O."" belies The Dirtbombs' ability to craft emotionally complex, anthemic songs; ""Motor City Baby"" showcases the band's readiness to dip into the hooky, bubblegum choruses that made Motown wiggle. There's not too much here to dismiss: ""Stuck in Thee Garage"" is ultimately forgettable (although its title is a nice implication of the Bombs' embrace of high/low dichotomy), but Dangerous Magical Noise plays better as one big, somersaulting explosion, aggressive and gentle and smarter every time you look. If The Dirtbombs are any indication of Detroit's real ""scene,"" they're proving that the frantic archivists and smoking-jacket cognoscenti will never actually come to terms with the anti-poetry of this city. But if the lack of a realistic, cohesive music community means it's possible to create this kind of bizarrely assimilated beauty, then Detroit shouldn't even care.","As a musical landscape, Detroit is tangled up in mythology: the twitchy legacy of Motown, the ashes of The\n ...

"Rise, Rise, Rise",Tyondai BraxtonParts & Labor,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16cb1335d7bf169825b/1:1/w_160/e8a32e7d.gif,2003-12-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6531-rise-rise-rise/,Narnack,"The split release is an interesting phenomenon of independent music-- it's like a recommendation from a friend, a band you like endorsing a band they like. But while it seems like a new split single or EP sees release every day, split full-lengths aren't so common. There's a reason for this: EPs and singles tend to serve as stopgaps in the rock world, small offerings to keep the masses entertained and hungry between albums. Though dancier rock and file-trading are gradually taking over the underground, the album, for now, is still viewed by most as the definitive statement an artist can make, and sharing that statement with another artist isn't something I'm sure most bands would seriously consider. But Tyondai Braxton and Parts & Labor manage not just to successfully expand the split EP concept into a full album, they also make a cohesive, logical sounding record in the process. It's split down the middle, with Parts & Labor taking the first half, and Braxton stretching out three compositions over the latter. Braxton, who asserted himself as a challenging, vital artist in his own right on last year's stunning debut History That Has No Effect, has a more obtuse muse than his partners in crime, but the two halves are so sonically of a piece with each other that his work never seems displaced. In fact, there's not even a break between the two sides, as Parts & Labor's last song, the jittery explosion ""The Endless Air Show"", segues directly into the motion sickness-inducing drum onslaught of Braxton's ""Stand There"", a titular retort to the album's opening track, ""Don't Just Fucking Stand There"". That song has Parts & Labor's Dan Friel playing his guitar as though it were bagpipes, laying out a majestic drone over drummer Joel Saladino's reserved pulse and bassist BJ Warshaw's squelching electronics. The weirdly traditional Celtic melody can't help but sound at home in Friel's reedy guitar tone, and the band even brings in real bagpipes on ""Jurassic Technology"", highlighting just how effective Friel's technique is at imitating them. Parts & Labor offer a few vocal songs as well, gurgling like a Highland Brainiac on ""Days in Thirds"" and bursting with stuttering rock fury on the aforementioned ""Endless Air Show"". Friel and Warshaw mask their voices in electronic veils, barking with force, but melting into the music around them. Braxton follows this up by drawing a long, slow vocal melody out over the frenetic backing of ""Stand There"", a catchy blast of frayed noise that serves as the record's high point. ""Disintegrating Reels"" sounds a lot like its namesake, a slow, shapeshifting monster of a track that showcases Braxton's facility with processing and looping. Ink-black guitars trickle over chopped and diced vocal samples, and as the piece staggers on, Braxton adds flute, cello, viola and trumpet in modest doses, creating a frenzy of agonized noise that lurches full bore into closer ""Jackpot"". ""Jackpot"" is full of fluttering piano beset by scrolling tape noise, like an old Disney score put through a paper shredder and haphazardly rearranged. It's unsettling, but pretty at the same time, an industrial sound that still manages to come off as playful and lighthearted before finally morphing into a kind of evil fantasia cut through with menacing vocals and fractured guitar. And with that, Braxton closes the disc about as far into left field as you can get-- a pretty good place to end, as it seems like the place these two artists are likely to spend most of their time in the future. Parts & Labor are an exciting prospect, drone rock that's as much rock as drone, while Braxton's harshly experimental approach ought to continue yielding potent fruit for a long time to come. Braxton's debut album is still the best place to hear him first (if you can't make it to one of his mind-bending live shows, that is), but this is an intriguing, challenging album and an excellent introduction to two artists full of great ideas.",,7.8,
This Is Not a Test,Missy Elliott,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc51c0084474cd0c2a78/1:1/w_160/8ba1a73f.jpg,2003-12-03 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2758-this-is-not-a-test/,Elektra,"This is a Brent DiCrescenzo exclusive. Readers'd revolt if I began every review that way. Unfortunately, Missy Elliott did just that on last year's Under Construction, proclaiming the unnecessary before each track. It's nitpicking criticism, but enough reason to proclaim dark, dense This Is Not a Test as the new, and likely temporary, Best Missy Elliott Album. Time has come to examine the cultural idiosyncrasies of Virginia and discover how the region produced the core clique of pop innovators. With attention focused on New York, Manchester, Miami, and even Seattle, the notion sounded preposterous a decade ago. Now entrenched as the Ronnie and Phil of crunk, Missy and Timbaland need only compete against their past, and the occasional Neptunes track. As in any healthy muse/artist relationship, the producer reserves his next level work for the queen. The sparse scratch and siren driven ""Let It Bump"" hits speakers like a SWAT team on a motel door. The broken-cone bass buzz and snapping steel guitar string supersaturates ""Pump It Up"" with sickness. There's no way these beats were going to Kiley Dean or Magoo. Nothing in the world rattles jeeps more than war and hip-hop. Surrounded by a Hummer, Black Panthers, bull terriers, and a burnt sky, Missy looks ready to meld the two. In this current climate, such imagery comes obviously loaded, yet she abstains from any referential iconography, such as Madonna's Che chic, or manifesto. Songs like ""Let Me Fix My Weave"" and the dildo ode ""Toyz"" throw no stones at administrations or pseudo-pundits (though I suspect Condi is quite familiar with both subjects). The imagery evokes Missy's unabashed forthrightness and Timbaland's accompanying steely, spiked clamor. A verse on ""Weave"" levels J.Lo's extensions with the common lady getting her hair ""did,"" Missy's table at Madre's be damned. No veils of cute or coy or irony are pulled before her façade. Timbaland laces no trendy bhangra or dancehall into his minimal assaults, even those on which Elephant/Beenie Man guest. Video vixens may pant and rub themselves to stumps before approaching the true sexuality of a woman who's run out of patience for those refusing to dance, drop their posturing, or go down on her. But it's the album's end-to-end strength that speaks the most-- against hip-hop artists who fail to make solid albums and those rock idiots who say it can't be done. 16 tracks clock in under 60 minutes with meaningful mini-skits, intro, and outros. Even the plethora of guests inconspicuously slip into the mix. There's no way the two stars could be outshined, though Nelly redeems his crassly commercial career with his ""go go Gadget dick,"" while Jay-Z brilliantly rhymes ""rectum"" with ""David Beckham"" on ""Wake Up"". As that track crushes like a submarine hull crunching over sonar pings, Missy says, ""You ain't got a cellular phone/ It's all right/ If you gotta wear them jeans again/ It's all right."" Even when backed up by the Kings of Bling, Missy continually cuts the crap. Everyone is invited to the party, even those getting dissed. Those familiar with Missy through the radio only need know this: even the skyscraping ""Pass That Dutch"", a masterwork of robot ropeskipping riding unbelievably deep bass that turns subwoofers into hair dryers, seems a mere hillock over its surroundings.","This is a Brent DiCrescenzo exclusive.

600% Dynamite,Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e613d197565213951f/1:1/w_160/91310933.jpg,2003-12-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1992-600-dynamite/,Soul Jazz,"About a year after the most recent addition to its outstanding Dynamite series, Soul Jazz Records has finally released the latest chapter, 600% Dynamite. For those who aren't familiar with the Teflon label's releases, the Dynamite records are a cross-section of Jamaican music, past and present. Rather than cramming what can be an exhausting sound to some listeners into genre-oriented compilations (as the Trojan cut-price three-disc boxes do), Soul Jazz strives to present an eclectic look at the rich history of Jamaican music. The result is that instead of the monolithic nature of many comps, the London-based label combs the archives of Studio One, the famed label run by Coxsone Dodd and presents something for everyone. The label offers a chance for people to check out the variety of Jamaican music and determine what they favor from the likes of ska, rocksteady, reggae, roots, soul crossovers, DJs, lover's rock, dancehall, ragga, dub, and so forth. So far, 100% is the one for completists and 200% was the head-turner that expanded into dub and featured a solid mix of classics and lesser-known tracks. Perhaps the best introduction to the series, though, is 300%, which has the highest strike rate but features a lot of well-known tracks and compilation fodder. It's the place to start for the Jamaican music novice, but may prove superfluous to some longtime listeners. Follow-up 400% nearly matches the quality of its predecessor, but features many more lesser known tracks-- it's the pick for the connoisseur. Last year's 500% expanded to include dancehall and ragga while still maintaining a high hit-miss ratio. Not surprisingly, 600% picks up where 500% left off, leaning heavily on dancehall. It kicks off with a 2003 version of Barrington Levy's dancehall classic ""Under Mi Sensi"". Although a great track, it's a slightly regrettable choice because it also appears on both Ragga Ragga Ragga 2003 and The Biggest Dancehall Anthems 2003, the two compilations that casual observers of dancehall would most likely track down to get a solid cross-section of this sometimes difficult-to-follow scene. What the inclusion of ""Under Mi Sensi"" does do, however, is continue the series' dialogue between tracks over different discs, highlighting the incestuous and back-scratching nature of Jamaica music. (The original ""Under Mi Sensi"" was featured on 400% Dynamite). Despite the presence of that update (and other popular favorites, such as Dennis Brown's ""Westbound Train"" and Yabby You's ""Conquering Lion""), the track most familiar to most listeners will be the Johnny Osbourne's Winston Riley-produced ""Ready or Not"", the inspiration for the Fugees track of the same name. Osbourne's warm, mellifluous vocals are also featured on the uncharacteristically frantic, almost scat of the low-rent disco ""Budy Bye"". The underrated Winston Riley also provides Sister Nancy's ""Transport Connection"" and he outdoes his ""Ready or Not"" with Prince Mohammed's ""Come Mek a Rub a Dub"". Osbourne""s ""Budy Bye"" is representative of most of the compilation's dancehall sounds. Rather than the sometimes harsh and masculine ragga-vocaled dancehall that's currently at a commercial and artistic peak, 600% mostly highlights the sweeter, more feminine side of dancehall-- sort of the two-step to ragga's grime garage. The sweet-voiced Tenor Saw pitches in with the soulful, horn-driven ""Golden Hen"". Cynty & The Monkees' ""Lady Lady"" (produced by Lee Perry) draws a line between gospel-inspired soul and girl-group music. Even the harshest ragga track, Papa San's ""Give Her the Credit"" is praising the feminine (but, playfully, only ""when she deserve it"") with a chopped-up beat that's part Public Enemy (literally) and part Todd Edwards. Elsewhere, Lloyd Chalmers' cheeky, proto-dub fascination with playful sounds and a bit of echo is highlighted on Tall T & The Touchers' ""Touch the President"" and Chalmers' group, The Uniques, pays tribute to another regal figure on ""Queen Majesty"". (The In Crowd's ""His Majesty Is Coming"" is also included, but they're anticipating spiritual guidance rather than any political figure.) Slanted heavily toward early dancehall and more soulful vocals than many of the previous additions, 600% Dynamite sort of tilts some scales by dropping roots and ska music from its lineup. It's another outstanding and worthy addition to the series-- one that thankfully shines a light on a great number of lesser-known gems. Soul Jazz's inclusion here of primarily rocksteady and dancehall tracks is fitting. Those are the Jamaican sounds that seem to be getting the most critical scrutiny and praise at the moment, demonstrating that the label has its finger on the pulse of the now just as surely as it does on that of the past.","About a year after the most recent addition to its outstanding Dynamite series, Soul Jazz Records has finally released the ...

"Hardcore UFO's: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere",Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc713d197565213b936/1:1/w_160/2b43d581.jpg,2003-12-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3598-hardcore-ufos-revelations-epiphanies-and-fast-food-in-the-western-hemisphere/,Matador,"With a band as prolific and uneven as Guided by Voices, describing any single release as ""definitive"" seems dubious, if not misleading. To apply this term to the band's third box set seems nothing short of comical. But I'll be damned if the boys at Matador weren't on to something when they slapped a big yellow sticker on the Hardcore UFO's box set that reads, ""The definitive GBV box set."" Rather than simply lumping together a bunch of marginal or unreleased material, Hardcore UFO's actually pulls together a bunch of material fans have been anticipating for a good long while; a decent GBV live album, the perpetually out-of-print debut EP Forever Since Breakfast, and most of the B-sides from the band's Matador heyday. The last GBV box, Suitcase, was an impenetrable mess. Though a surprisingly high percentage of its 100 unreleased songs were wonderful, there was no discernible organization to the set, making it a real challenge to wade through. Hardcore UFO's, on the other hand, compiles five easy-to-swallow and separately titled CDs, a DVD, and a book of photos into one nicely compartmentalized, intensely approachable package. And like the best box sets, Hardcore UFO's manages to be representative of GBV's greatness without rehashing too much previously available material. The one questionable inclusion here is that of a chronologically sequenced Human Amusements at Hourly Rates, the band's also-separately-released best-of album. Pollard's sequencing proved pretty essential to the enjoyment of the best-of disc, and hearing the songs ordered chronologically only brings out the disparities between GBV's fractured and imaginative early work and their more straightforward recent output. On a more practical level, it's pretty safe to assume that somebody willing to drop $55 on a box set is pretty familiar with the band's albums-- with the best-of album also available separately, it's hard to justify its inclusion in a ""hardcore"" box set. Thankfully, Human Amusements is the only disc here that needlessly rehashes old material. Demons & Painkillers, a collection of B-sides and compilation appearances from the Alien Lanes through Mag Earwhig! period, shows just how much of the band's best output has never been released on one of their full-lengths. Studio-produced versions of ""Motor Away"", ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"", and ""Game of Pricks"" are welcome inclusions, if they ultimately prove less dynamic than the basement versions from the albums. The B-sides from the underrated Mag Earwhig!, including a fantastic rocked-up version of ""Now to War"", while the epic ""(I'll Name You) The Flame That Cries"" may be the best songs on the disc, speaking to the wealth of fantastic post-Under the Bushes material. Much of this material pops up on Live from the Wheelchair Races, by far the best GBV live document ever to see release. Culled from throughout the band's career, the disc captures spot-on performances of the band's best songs, the inebriated antics of previous live releases played down in favor of excellence and energy. Enthusiasm has always been one of the band's greatest strengths, and this is the first of the band's live recordings, apart from the video-only Live in L.A. performance, to truly capture this. Perhaps the most predictable disc in the set, Delicious Pie & Thank You for Calling is the latest in a seemingly endless batch of previously unreleased demo recordings to see the light of day in recent years. Thankfully, the overall quality of the songs is slightly higher than usual this time around. Early demo versions of Mag Earwhig!'s balls-out rockers demonstrate Pollard's excitement at having a more virtuosic band at his disposal. Super-early demo recordings show that the ""lo-fi"" setup used by Pollard to record most of GBV's classic output doesn't sound so awesome on its own. As per usual, there's little here that challenges the best from Bee Thousand or Alien Lanes, but plenty of interesting material for fans to dig through. The Forever Since Breakfast EP also proves a compelling listen, showing that Pollard was honing his big-rock chops long before he began to explore his inimitable melodic sensibility. And then there's Watch Me Jumpstart, a fascinating documentary directed by Banks Tarver that perfectly rounds out Hardcore UFO's. The film loosely chronicles the band from their early days through their mid-90s ascent. About as far as you can hope to get from a glamorizing rockstar biopic, Watch Me Jumpstart watches as Pollard carves out his own private musical universe amidst the boredom and sprawl of Dayton, Ohio, and shows that Guided by Voices didn't come out of nowhere-- they grew out of a rock and roll history absorbed and recreated in Robert Pollard's basement. Though by no means a complete document of Guided by Voices, Hardcore UFO's is a welcome window into their origins and development.","With a band as prolific and uneven as Guided by Voices, describing any single release as ""definitive"" seems dubious, if ...

In other words, she's indiedom's pet mainstreamer, a slightly humiliating vocation that can be traced back to a massive contextual mix-up. Here's what happened: Orton's prolonged stint as the Chemical Brothers' ashanti (to launch a term for the go-to hook girl) got her 1997 solo debut, *Trailer Park, into thousands of Discmen theretofore unsullied by chanteuses. Brit ravers who'd never mind Orton's Lilith Fair kin-- or, later, Dido-- embraced her music as a particularly luxurious species of chill-out. Critics, for their part, acted as if Orton were the first to dress acoustic folk in loops and ambient beds. (Actually, it was Suzanne Vega, whose 1992 album * 99.9\xBA F was so far ahead of the curve that it sounds, well, current). Two more song collections followed, with predictably diminishing returns. Orton never fiddled with the formula enough to alienate her original audience, but the ardor gradually faded. Both Central Reservation and Daybreaker were roughly three parts twang to one part electronica-- a docile, infinitely accommodating recipe that absorbed contributions from Dr. John, Emmylou Harris, Ben Harper, Ryan ""Rock'n'Roll"" Adams and the Chemical Brothers with equal ease. So: three albums (each with a cover photo featuring the gawky singer in a sun-dappled outdoor scenario), zero hits outside the UK, and a dwindling supply of critical benevolence. Doesn't quite sound like the moment for a greatest-hits album. And yet here is Pass in Time, containing no less than 54.5% of Trailer Park (six songs out of eleven!), 41.6% of Central Reservation and, mercifully, only 20% of last year's Daybreaker. Until the chronology begins to hiccup toward the end of disc one, the collection scans like a producer's progress report: from album to album the sonic spaces grow wider and the instrumentation more lush. Trailer Park's ""Sugar Boy"" is typical early Orton-- simple, delicate and almost imperceptibly stilted by its own politesse. ""Stolen Car"", which opened Central Reservation, is a darker Beth, the main harmony alternately caressed and bruised by mewling backward guitars. The album provides a two-song glimpse into the singer's ""embarrassing"" pre-debut, an early 90s recording called Superpinkymandy-- in reality, the iffy production is the only factor setting these tunes apart from the rest; as a songwriter, Orton is consistent to a fault. Pass in Time's second disc culminates with her collaborations with William Orbit, an EP's worth of echoey pop that may hint at a future direction. The future, as you might have guessed, sounds fairly familiar. The single most interesting thing about Beth Orton remains her unique voice, best described as a kind of guttural lilt. An all-purpose instrument, it glides as smoothly alongside Princess Superstar's blabber as it does over the Chemical Brothers' crunch (whose deafening coda to ""Where Do I Begin"" off the Vanilla Sky soundtrack delivers this collection's sole moment of urgency). The awful truth about Beth Orton may be that she is still, at heart, an ashanti.","Beth Orton is fat-free angel cake, a guiltless dessert; so goes the rock-crit wisdom. In other words, she's\n ...

Sparrow,Sparrow,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64ab1335d7bf1698dc5/1:1/w_160/0497ec83.jpg,2003-12-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7725-sparrow/,Overcoat,"Sparrow's self-titled debut is the new project from ex-Zumpano drummer Jason Zumpano, and that's about the most exciting thing I can say about it. Which is shocking given that Zumpano's two early 90s full-lengths for Sub Pop, Look What the Rookie Did, and Goin' Through Changes, both brimmed with sprightly blasts of instantaneous hookiness and shimmering youthful exuberance. But despite Zumpano getting its namesake from their drummer, Sparrow's debut may serve as yet another unfortunate reminder that Carl Newman, ex-Zumpano frontman and current New Pornographers guru, seems to have been the man behind most of Zumpano's kitschy irreverence. If one chooses to disregard Zumpano's past, then Sparrow's tunes sound exactly as flaccid as one might expect coming from a band named Sparrow. The dreadful cover art alone can be considered a disclaimer for the tedious and mind-numbingly dull exercise in chamber-pop within; the cover displays a colorless illustration of a bird from whence the band assumedly gleaned their thrilling name, while the back of the album features a gray photo of Jason Zumpano, hands firmly tucked in his suit pant pockets, with an dispossessed expression across his face-- which also, ironically enough, was my reaction after attempting to remain focused on this grueling album. Zumpano may be a fucking ridiculous drummer, but as exemplified by the relationship kiss-off ""Don't Stand on Me"", the guy can't sing worth a damn. Lines like, ""Don't you think of standing on me again/ I knew that you were heartless,"" should spill over with sincerity, but instead seem completely callous and disconnected. By the time Zumpano reaches the liberating declaration of the song's conclusion, ""You are gone, and I am happy,"" his delivery has been so indifferent that the words drift by in an empty fog without making the slightest impact. Though Zumpano's vocals are seemingly beyond help, Sparrow would have faired somewhat better had the accompaniment sounded at all inspired. There's a possibility that it once did-- Sparrow was originally conceived, just after the breakup of Zumpano's band in the late 90s, as an instrumental affair. However, each number here seems plagued by their predominantly piano-driven arrangements, while an unrelentingly gray mix holds any potential charms captive. On the album's pastoral opening track, ""Mountain on Mountain"", a rolling piano motif, which should come off as an intricately melodic counterpoint, instead seems remarkably plaintive and uneventful. The would-be piano-and-drums bombast of ""One Eye Closed"" sounds more like a whimper, as ex-Zumpano guitarist Michael Ledwidge's lively chiming guitar chords, and the band's earnest attempts at backing vocal harmonies are, for better or worse, buried beneath the murky mix. In fact, the only winning moment on the entire album comes with the very last number, the resigned acoustic ballad ""A Broken Sign"". Maybe it's that, amidst the colorless piano tones of Sparrow, the casual strum of an acoustic guitar can sound like a revelation, or that for the first time on the whole record, Zumpano's disenchanted vocal style seems to fit better with the generally apathetic lyrics of the song. Either way, its note of resignation by now echoes that of the listener; as Sparrow pensively draws to a close, so do its fans' expectations.","Sparrow's self-titled debut is the new project from ex-Zumpano drummer Jason Zumpano, and that's about the most exciting ...

The Cunt Chronicles,Shat,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6499d034d5c69bf34d0/1:1/w_160/c84a65a8.gif,2003-12-02 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7724-the-cunt-chronicles/,Buddyhead,"As if Skull Ring wasn't enough on its own to pour sugar into the gas tank of Iggy's terminally stalled career, the Pop has to go and associate himself with Shat. Iggy, I will meet you out by the flagpole at three o'clock for this; if even one person mistakenly thinks that some of your ""cred"" has rubbed off on this jackass, why, I'll... Well, probably get my ass kicked. I'm no match for a guy who used to roll around in broken glass, even if his body has been wrecked by heroin. But it's the principle, dammit. Ig opens The Cunt Chronicles with a guest monologue, graciously informing us that the following eternity of faux-metal schlock is a ""best of"" compilation, but this is a lie; the disc is not blank. The best thing Shat can offer is silence, and not just any run-of-the-mill silence-- impenetrable death-silence. After sixty-five cuts that can only be seen as symptomatic of the growing rate of functional illiteracy in this great nation, The Cunt Chronicles is so remarkably vacant that it fails even as parody, succeeding only in making the sweet release of death seem all the sweeter with every track. But I, your intrepid reviewer, will hold on just a little longer. I'm on a deadline. Okay. So, the album's not to be taken seriously; granted. With song titles like ""If She Has a Kid, You Know She Fucks"" (the brutal logic underlying the tragedy of teen pregnancy!), Sesame Street lessons like ""Open/Close"" (""Open the door/ Close the door""), and the fortune-cookie wisdom of the enlightening ""You Can't Just Shit"", this much is clear. And yet, it may not be a sincere endeavor, but that doesn't mean it's funny. I'd mention Anal Cunt, but they're hard enough to be scary, with far better song titles and lyrics. The Queers' ""Day Late and a Dollar Short"" (an early, brilliant EP collection from before they became surf-punk fluff) is really Shat's holy grail-- a goal sought, but never attained; for every cheap laugh produced by three-chord shoutalongs like ""This Place Sucks"", The Queers were able to hit on genuine humor and some actual music on tracks like ""Kicked Out of the Webelos"". Shat is not so talented. Instead, The Chronicles are as relentless and unflagging as brain cancer, and twice as fun. Sixty-five tracks of this, y'all. Sixty-five tracks, and barely three times that many different lyrics between them all. Sixty-five tracks of mindless slog-metal that Def Leppard's drummer could play, with some obvious ""ironic"" riff-stealing-- in case you didn't know how funny it was to hear-- oh god, I'd give an example of one of the 80s hard-rock already-a-self-parody songs they mimic for kicks, but I'd have to listen again. Sixty-five tracks, but here's one Jeff Wood (the chief mastermind behind Shat) forgot to include. It's called, ""Shat is Shit"": ""Shat is shit!

All of them. If there's any justice, some honcho over with at ASCAP will read this and investigate why I'm not receiving royalties for this album. Don't think it's that easy? Let's ask Jeff. Jeff, how do you write most of your songs? ""Most of them I write at work. Like the song 'I Stepped in Shit'. I walked into this person's backyard, because I spray chemicals on lawns, and I fucking, I just stepped in shit and I was like 'Fuck.' And my friend said 'What?' and I said, 'I stepped in shit.' And it was like bing, that's a song, so I ran to the van and fucking wrote it down. My memory is shot. I've got to write it down because as soon as I write it down the song is done."" This is the future of music. Think this sounds funny? Think this album might be ""good for a laff?"" Oh my no. One song. That's it. One song, and then run as fast and far as you can. If I were to humbly suggest the tune of choice, how about ""Cunt Flavored Lollipops"", primarily notable for an amusing breakdown of the song's one and only line-- that's right, ""cunt-flavored lollipops""-- to the tune of ""The Good Ship Lollipop."" But don't even sit still long enough to laugh at it, even if you'd like nothing more than to savor literally the one moment of humor on The Cunt Chronicles. Flee before you are caught and devoured. There's nothing funny about realizing that you'll never get back a full hour of your life that could have been spent more productively having sex with a power sander, forgetting how to read, or simply letting the blood flow out of your wrists and into the bathtub drain, gently... so gently...","As if Skull Ring wasn't enough on its own to pour sugar into the gas tank of Iggy's ...

Bless the Headless / We Like It Wild,The Impossible Shapes,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95aeb335119a49ec754/1:1/w_160/33a2a442.jpg,2003-12-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11759-bless-the-headless-we-like-it-wild/,Luna,"These guys might hail from Bloomington, Indiana, near the heart of Middle America, and they might have band ties to Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina, the midwest's unofficial blue collar songwriting spokesperson, but when I listen to each of The Impossible Shapes' 2003 releases, I get two-fold British vibes. Lead vocalist/principal songwriter Chris Barth channels an austere lyrical sensibility that harkens back to the best of England's Romantic Period poets, and We Like It Wild, the more cohesive and accomplished statement of the two records, finds the band running their psychedelic-to-folk-pop gamut in effortless stride; the sound often bleeds true British Invasion. Previous releases have drawn comparisons to the Elephant 6 collective, Pavement, and Robert Pollard, but their sound has yet to remain stagnant long enough to really pin it down to any map or timetable. If anything, their closest contemporaries range from the quirky indie-smart jangle pop of Versus to the sweeping pastoral and rustic tones of the Fruit Bats. The Shapes' continued evolution is manifest in the disparity between the shifty Bless the Headless and the conditioned We Like It Wild; the first finding release in March and the latter in October. Perhaps the only connective ligaments are the band's reluctance to settle into any scripted role, and Barth's affinity for serene, vernal poetics and autumnal imagery. Both albums are rife with lyrical references to rolling hills, trees, creeks, dirty knees and breezes, and delivered in direct couplets or simply rhymed tercets. A spiritual, almost ritual, awareness of mortality along with meditative accounts of pastoral tranquility bedaub the Spartan narratives-- though the fairy-tale fever that sweats through Bless the Headless is a bit shiftier, paralleling the less vigilant song structures of the album. ""Play with Me"" restlessly jerks its way through an octagonal pop structure, epitomizing the band's quirky and amorphous arrangements. As playful as its namesake, the song shifts and spins through several enchanting melodies and polyrhythmic beats. Either a subdued rocker or an ambitious dirge, carried by subtly propulsive drum timings and rhythmic guitars, it manages to center itself with a unique immediacy and vision. ""Bathing Swans"", with a bit more of a jam-bent, comes in with ""Love is here and hope is gone/ We must cry for the bathing swans."" It's distinctively Wordsworthian (or even Blake-like) in tone, as are much of both albums' lyrical stylings. Album highlights include the multiplicities of ""Good to Lie"" and ""A Final Feast Forever"", a daring carnivalesque pop number with a beautiful crescendo of melody, keys and percussion. Also, ""Always the Way"" turns on a dime from pinpoint melody to aimless meandering, and succeeds unqualifiably in the process. However, their more spacey and digressive numbers (""Kids Need Clerks"", ""The Line So Flexible"") too often recall a basement-jam band. The songs on We Like It Wild are more focused and fully realized. ""Give Me a Note"" limps in with a Velvet Underground-flavored murky, rain-soaked serenity. ""The Perfect Timing"", host to a guitar line similar to post-millennial Built to Spill, begins a set of expertly crafted pop songs, sometimes riding bareback galloping rhythms, and sometimes toeing the line with crisp, jangled guitar lines. ""Sharing Our Space"" delightfully showcases Barth's fey voice over a lively rhythm on a multitracked vocal melody and lines such as, ""I turn away glad, glory be/ And be blessed to befriend a sugar tree/ Sharing our space aligned,"" before giving way to a tastefully key-adorned instrumental outro. ""Two Be Wild"", a more subdued song with serene acoustics, sits patiently in the middle of the album with understatement as an anchor, and finally, ""Lovers Living Uphill"", the closer, lets loose but reigns itself back in with a gorgeous propulsive melody that settles from a dust cloud of instrumental indulgence. The rest of the record is mostly fit with variegated structures within any single track, but the songs rarely lose control as they sometimes did on Bless the Headless. Shifty, nervous, and relentless, each track packs its own reward, and many are carried on the strength of the aforementioned British Invasion guitar-driven bent. In all, We Like It Wild better frames The Impossible Shapes' structural wanderlust, and pockets several more linear arrangements to buoy the end result. Truly, selecting a weak track could prove relatively laborious. If the band has a weakness, it's likely the lack of true depth or grit: the album runs a similar course to The Shins' Chutes Too Narrow but can't carry an emotional load as heavy. Though all finely balanced, their mercurial song structures rarely claw deep enough to grow roots; a gentle breeze, a quick sneeze, a lit match, and they're gone. But despite its ephemeral beauty, We Like It Wild is a formidable accomplishment and solid effort throughout. If you smoke Indie-Lites, and have a taste for this sort of thing, you might consider switching brands.","

Holiday Diary,Flim,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc813d197565213b602/1:1/w_160/3c1fe325.gif,2003-12-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3102-holiday-diary/,Plinkity Plonk,"The phrase ""thrown together"" denotes carelessness, but it's not always so. It's possible to be both spontaneous and reverent. After beginning his recording career with the intensely focused Given You Nothing, which consisted mostly of solo piano, Flim's Enrico Wuttke has loosened up and started to experiment. Most of the limited edition Holiday Diary (500 copies were pressed) was recorded in a single day, pieced together from field recordings and melodic fragments played by Wuttke on guitar, organ, piano and accordion. By definition, Holiday Diary was thrown together, perhaps, but there's something interesting at work. Wuttke has a knack for making seemingly incongruent sounds work together. The opening ""Murmer Room"" is built around a loop of a plucked acoustic guitar, and Wuttke layers keyboard and percussive sounds, the random banging of a drunk navigating a darkened room. The following ""Lime"", one of two tracks recorded in 2001, opens with shifting chords on what sounds like a pipe organ, eerily evocative of Popul Vuh, and then a massive, distorted power chord shatters the meditative mood until the organ eventually resurfaces. ""Current Description"" is a dark and sad piano solo with just a faint wisp of processing, and here Wuttke's 25 years of training are apparent, as he squeezes every drop of feeling from the gulf-like spaces between the notes. Holiday Diary is a back-and-forth kind of record that jumps between sounds and styles, but it works. Shifting gears yet again, ""Above Seagulls"" displays Wuttke's oft-stated love for Talk Talk's Laughing Stock, with loose, booming drums and a circular chord structure ribbed with tension. Then it's back to piano for ""Home"", a minimalist piece that could have come from Philip Glass' solo piano record. ""No Guitars Please"" is a short piece for accordion, and then ""Ecstatic Brown"" is a return to field recordings, piling identifiable scrapes and bumps with throbbing organ chords in the manner of C-Schulz & Hajsch before releasing the tension by folding in a delicate piano melody. Kid606 and his ilk brag of being able to make an album in one night, but Holiday Diary is different. It feels like a backlog of ideas assembled quickly for posterity, yes, but somehow the slapdash nature of the project seems perfect. It feels organic, simultaneously random and unified. I'm not going to call Wuttke a genius, but after hearing three albums I will say that his music is unusually fresh and unique. Who else is combining the most trad acoustic sound possible (untreated piano) with heavy electronics? His music is generally serious with a faint whiff of academia, but Wuttke keeps his eye on the ball and moves to maximize the effectiveness of each individual track. And most importantly, he sounds like no one else, which, these days, counts for a lot.","The phrase ""thrown together"" denotes carelessness, but it's not always so.

"Lovers, Lead the Way!",Viva Voce,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23613d19756521387fb/1:1/w_160/0a109add.jpg,2003-12-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8519-lovers-lead-the-way/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Every band is a kind of marriage. There's the constant balancing of your own preferences with those of your bandmates, the occasional spat, and intrusive friends, family members and Yoko-esque boy/girlfriends are like built-in in-laws. An onerous recording contract supplants the mortgage; fussy equipment replaces four-legged pets and (hopefully) two-legged babies; solo albums sit in for the ""I need some space"" weekend getaway to the spa. And bands, of course, splinter for all kinds of reasons financial, creative, and egoistic, just like half of all modern American marriages. So imagine playing in a band with your spouse. It takes a certain kind of couple to enter into an artistic partnership without letting the conflict of marriage seep into the creative process. And when you make your music the way Portland, Oregon's Kevin and Anita Robinson do-- that is, without ever leaving your living room-- it's hard to imagine disagreements over which songs are garbage not impacting an overdubbing session just a little. Amazingly, though, the Robinsons rise above it all to pull together some ambitious and affecting indie pop, and Lovers, Lead the Way!, their second album in five years, is a relaxed, cohesive statement. Though the duo does all of their own recording and production at home-- the album art features one especially telling shot of a mic'd amp next to the toilet-- this is not your traditional bedroom pop record. Indeed, it opens with an epic swell or piano, organ and Mellotron, carried along on Bonham-by-way-of-the-picket-fence drumming, finally paring back to the skittering programmed drums and analog synths of ""Fashionably Lonely"", which features Anita's pretty, understated alto bobbing amongst the hazy atmospherics. The fuzzy bass and boy/girl harmonies of ""One in Every Crowd"" are going to get Viva Voce compared to Mates of State on many a critic's page, and the comparison's not too far off, though the Robinsons place much greater emphasis on texture and layering-- not to mention Anita's exquisite guitar playing. She reels off a frazzled, passionate solo on the Kevin-sung ""Red D-Lish"" over his ""Strawberry Pet Sounds Forever"" backing of Mellotron and clip-clopping percussion. Kevin's other showcase, ""Brightest Part of Everyone"", is incredible, his chilled-out double-tracked vocal easing through a shuffling mass of electric piano, fuzz bass and keyboards. The dense instrumentation gives way to nothing but Anita's angelic backing harmonies on the chorus, a brilliant dynamic shift that makes it one of several peaks on the album. These two are clearly full of ideas, and they don't shy from exploring them, touching on new wave in the ping-ponging Moogs of ""Wrecking Ball"", prog pomposity in the towering, wah-bathed intro to ""The Tiger & How We Tamed It"", and the morphing post-rock textures on the instrumental ""Yr Epic Heart"", which features busy drumming, slightly out-of-tune bells, gurgling keys and some noisy, Ira Kaplan-ish fret fireworks from Anita. Closer ""Let's Bend Light"" is a noir thriller smothered in vibraphone tone clusters and ride cymbal, with Anita's vocals strutting through the shadows, offering impressionistic lines like, ""All that we wasted is time/ When we could bend light/ And shape the room."" So give credit where it's due. The Robinsons have navigated all the potential pratfalls of making music with one's mate with a deft, unified hand. Lovers, Lead the Way! is a fine slice of kitchen sink indie pop with atmosphere to spare-- this marriage begat one quiet stunner of an album.","Every band is a kind of marriage.

Turn Off the Radio Mixtape Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin',dead prezSticky Fingaz,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5beb335119a49eca04/1:1/w_160/29ac4cf1.gif,2003-12-01 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2530-turn-off-the-radio-mixtape-vol-2-get-free-or-die-tryin/,Landspeed,"If you're reading this website, there's a relatively high chance that Dead Prez hates your fucking guts. It's nothing personal. Chances are, it's just the color of your skin. Sure, the group has historical evidence to back up some of their disdain for the other white meat, but in stark contrast to the creative narrative-based style of The Coup's Boots Riley and the abrasive, loudspeaker soundclash of Public Enemy, Dead Prez's music fails by sounding purely conventional and presenting their cause in the most ignorant manner possible. m1 and stic.man are the emcees behind the most popular anti-establishment, pro-black militant rap group today and they draw their lyrical fury from a history of drug dealing, dropping out of high school, and traditional ghetto upbringings. Their songs span a vast array of subject matter: disdain for the police, revolutions, drugs, depressed mothers, black power, the hood, revolutions, black power, dead homies, revolutions and black power. This in mind, there are only eight full-length songs and the best track is a remake. ""Last Days Reloaded"" is an exercise in how a new style of soundscape and limited exposure can help a group. Fredro Starr's dusty windsong production harkens back to Marley Marl, while the Dead Prez duo make good use of the backing (and original rhyme schemes of the Onyx classic) for the best song on the album. Most impressively is Sticky Fingaz returning to form in the face of one of his older great works, with ridiculously raw lines like, ""I done broke every rule in the good book/ Trust me, I've memorized the anarchist cookbook,"" and, ""Fuck it, throw me in jail, I need a vacation!"" The caveats of the Dead Prez movement are plentiful: The subject matter is underdeveloped and narrow, their guest emcees are less than sharp, and the album structure is made for abbreviated listening, yet comes off more loosely constructed than urgent. Most importantly, even though the artists speak about news reporters ""making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner"" and the death of Tupac with fervid emotion, they still manage to bore with their meandering song structure and lazy neo-soul choruses. The production is vastly disappointing when compared to their work with Kanye West and others on their near-classic debut. Most of the beats are skewed towards an embarrassingly dated Tupac bootleg album feel, while a scant few are reduced to tone-deaf bounce tracks that make Lil' Jon look like a platinum-clad Prefuse 73. Particularly unfortunate are Tahir's ""Paper, Paper"", sporting a melody that could easily pass for a child's first experiment with Mario Paint's music editor, and the fake piano and flat bass of ""Scared to Die"" by Askari X. m1 is currently dating Erykah Badu, and her influence is fresh in his sudden penchant for song. If Badu is responsible for Andre 3000's creative renaissance and Common's bad rapping/knitted hats, m1 will be rocking shows with red, green and black parachute pants, writing ballads about how his love for Badu is like a shotgun in a white man's mouth. Regardless of their good intentions, if Dead Prez were in place of Malcolm X in front of the pedestal, the shooters would be aiming for the mics and not their heads.","If you're reading this website, there's a relatively high chance that Dead Prez hates your fucking guts.

When she plays drums or guitar, or worst of all, when she breaks out the ukulele, she persists with mechanical patience, switching chords like she's just getting the knack, and rendering some pretty decent lyrics in either a sing-song or a monotone. The plainness of it all is disarming, and not in a good way: it's like a child who's just stopped being cute. And that's not even counting the crayon-and-marker-colored liner notes. ""Gimme a T! Gimme an R! Gimme a U! Gimme a C! Gimme a K! For truckers!"" Around the eighth time she sings, ""I am an emergency vehicle,"" you wonder if anything's wrong, yet nothing here points to a crisis or problem-- in fact, this is some of the most transparently confident music around. Instead of giving us a mystery or asking us to psychoanalyze her, she seems to be striking out boldly, expecting us to take her as-is. Or, as she puts it in the liner notes: ""I'm not a dreamer. I make things happen. I also coach."" What seems so weird may just be the simplicity of her style, how ur-punk her tools are-- the lack of colors, the bare singing, and the use of repetition all suggest that any additional instrumentation or melody or anything other than the most starkly minimal elements would be an excess. Granted, Niblett occasionally receives some support from another guitarist and drummer, but even they seem to value sparseness, and more often than not, they're nowhere to be found anyway: most of I Am consists simply of Scout alone with an instrument, singing in that folky-dry British voice that has mostly been commended for how American it sounds. And Steve Albini-- the perfect engineer for this project-- captures her in perfect, quiet solitude. I Am, though more settled than her crazed singing and amateur drum-bashing on the I Conjure Series EP, is still pretty far from the minimal but warmly bluesy Sweet Heart Fever. On ""Drummer Boy"", the guitars fall like an avalanche, but other tracks are so focused they become faintly desperate: she gets some yearning tones from her ukulele, buried under the annoying ones. As for the lyrics, they reveal more subtlety than you infer from her singing. ""Texas"", for one, is rather elegant with its ""postcard from an art school girlfriend"" language: ""And Texas is hot/ Even when driving at night/ And Texas is sci-fi/ And Texas is plain/ And Texas is alright"", each verse punctuated by a whomp on the drums. This record is definitely an acquired taste, but what you get is an appreciation for a difficult but ultimately honest artist, stripped out of the ""rock"" or ""country"" labels into a private cave of her own-- like anything that wasn't 100% Scout got cut and thrown away, and whether you like what's left, at least you know it's hers. This kind of record is no fun to rate, because where I'd want a little more anything (more developed songs, maybe, or a little more emotional range in these parched-earth vocals), I know that others will be hit in the gut by every weird little tune on this album.

Songs We Should Have Written,Firewater,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda913d197565213b5c0/1:1/w_160/6a94f422.gif,2003-11-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3072-songs-we-should-have-written/,Jetset,"Pick your interpretation: view cover bands as shaky, budding novelists, tugging Hemingway tomes down from library shelves and re-copying whole paragraphs in their own wobbly hands, desperate to make the prose seem more accessible, more indigenous, more possible. Or see them as liberators, granting dusty, half-functional songs a contemporary glow, revising and updating and bestowing precious relevance, digging through the past for muddy, uncut gems. Or understand them as stubbornly embryonic garage trios that just didn't feel like writing anymore of their own stuff last weekend, proudly rolling out Zeppelin tracks and Radiohead B-sides and sixteen stupid, confounded versions of ""All Along The Watchtower"". But, however you choose to interpret these bands, do not deride the cover song: yes, they can be underwhelming and lazily executed, but mediocrity is not inherent to the form. On the smugly titled Songs We Should Have Written, ever-clever NYC ensemble Firewater sponge brilliant songs from brilliant songwriters (Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"", Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"", Tom Waits' ""Diamonds and Gold"", The Beatles' ""Hey Bulldog""), and crib other cuts originally written specifically for non-songwriters (the mostly spoken ""Is That All There Is?"", immortalized by Peggy Lee, or ""Some Velvet Morning"", long owned by Nancy Sinatra). The band's approach is classic admiration-marred-by-envy: most of these versions are instantly recognizable, despite being slowed down, sped up, or re-arranged, and Firewater's renditions are faithful, if a little caustic-- re-imagined but not always more convincing. As a band, Firewater consists of musicians who, generally, are better known for their previous projects: former Cop Shoot Cop bassist Tod Ashley leads the collective, which has, at various points, also featured Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion multi-instrumentalist Kurt Hoffman, and Elysian Fields vocalist Jennifer Charles. Given the members' own echoing reputations, Firewater's decision to release a record featuring exclusively cover songs is sorta funny. Still, Songs We Should Have Written is an interesting hop forward for the band, whose last full-length, 2003's The Man on the Burning Tightrope, was mucked up by its calliope-riddled burlesque theatrics, a throbbing, Waits-ian stew of accordion-heavy Mexploitation excess. Here, the broth is thinned out: ""Folsom Prison Blues"" opens with a clip of Cash bellowing ""Hello!"" and slips into warbling organ and honking guitars, Ashley's wildman holler keeping Cash's spirit afloat. ""Paint It Black"" is laboriously decelerated (a trick the Stones themselves occasionally employed) and haunted by sitar, with Ashley's low, loping chant eventually becoming starkly menacing. ""The Beat Goes On"" maintains playful Sonny & Cher flirtation, with Ashley and Charles trading off on vocals, whispering and cooing at each other over a thick foundation of keyboard and drums. Indeed, no matter how you finally decide to quantify the artistic merit of performing a cover, Songs We Should Have Written proves Firewater perfectly adept at the game of masquerade.","Pick your interpretation: view cover bands as shaky, budding novelists, tugging Hemingway tomes down from library shelves and re-copying whole ...

Splinter,Hip Tanaka,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0eb5e6ef95969323617/1:1/w_160/6a2e77b4.gif,2003-11-30 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3876-splinter/,Local 33 1/3,"God, I miss Boston. I lived there for four years, just like hundreds of thousands of student-aged people, and suffice to say I became attached to the city. There's something about the way the sports fans were still fanatical about teams that never won championships, the way you can walk pretty much anywhere, the uneven streets that don't conform to a grid pattern in the slightest, the bridge measured in Smoots, and the relatively short buildings that just made me feel at home. And then there was the music scene. I've heard the whole range of comments on the music scene in Boston, from ""it's awful"" to ""it's wicked good,"" and I fall somewhere toward the latter opinion. Boston gets tons of good shows, all reliably falling in a few choice venues, the Phoenix gets the word out admirably (for free, no less), and there are about a hundred hardcore scenesters you can bet will be at any show you turn up at (I knew most of them by sight, none of them by name). And of course, Boston turns out crop after crop of great leftfield bands, going back to The Standells in the 60s, The Modern Lovers and The Cars in the 70s, Mission of Burma, The Pixies and Treat Her Right in the 80s, and Morphine and The Dambuilders (Hawaiian transplants though they were) in the 90s. Maybe it's just all the academics in the air, but the Boston/Cambridge area produces a hugely disproportionate number of artsy pop bands for its population. I always tried to show up early to shows so I could catch locals like The Fly Seville, Baby Ray, Apollo Sunshine, and these guys, Hip Tanaka. I first caught them on a local bill with a couple bands I've forgotten about, and their spiky blender pop hooked me right as I was walking in the door. Their debut album, The Sky Is Smaller Than the Sea, had them coming off like a punkier They Might Be Giants, and it's kept its place on my shelves after a couple of moves. Splinter is the band's third full-length, and it actually shows their attention spans getting shorter, smashing most of its songs into durations of well under three minutes. Oddly, they kick the album off with the weakest track, the nebulous warm-up of ""Ready or Not"", but slide into their groove nicely on the second song, the spastic explosion of melody called ""Heart Attacks & Autographs"". The songs get gradually better as the disc spins on, too, and by the time you get past the halfway point and into the rubber rhythms of ""6,000,000,000 (And Counting)"", they're pounding out the tight, layered pop with seemingly little effort. ""Dr. Highway"" splashes loose harmonies over chunky riffs and melodic bass, occasionally slipping into a beat that wants to be disco, but never takes the full plunge. They manage to cram a lot into the song's three minutes and change, including a slamming electronic bridge full of buzzing sawtooth waves and bleeping noises. ""Heyday"" is the true highlight, though, with its stacks of vocals and careening guitar parts. The a capella break in the middle is full of claustrophobic tension, but the chorus smashes down the walls and insinuates itself into the very fiber of your being before the layers peel back for the exposed denouement. It's 3\xBD minutes of freakish pop perfection that's just as challenging as it is catchy. And that's really the strength of Hip Tanaka-- their music approaches you on what seem like your terms, and then abruptly pelts you with a hail of curve balls. With Splinter, Hip Tanaka provide just enough of a pop furnace blast to keep you wanting more. Things look as good as ever in Boston.","God, I miss Boston.

The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place,Explosions in the Sky,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd413d197565213b3e2/1:1/w_160/d07a5b2d.jpg,2003-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2879-the-earth-is-not-a-cold-dead-place/,Temporary Residence,"When the Texas quartet Explosions in the Sky released their last album, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever, it was unfairly plagued by coincidence. The record was a fragile triumph effectively mixing brooding melodrama and frantic rock bombast, but while the album's music was inspiring, it was no match for the ensuing mythology. Yes, a band named Explosions in the Sky did release a record the day before there were, quite literally, explosions in the sky on September 11th. Yes, the album did have a track called ""This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow"". However, it also came as a devastating obstacle for Explosion's music, as even music-snob bastards like myself needed something a little more ""upbeat"" to listen to as the world came apart at its seams. It's in this gloomy context that Explosions in the Sky's sophomore record, The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, comes as quite a revelation. While the album still exhibits the ominous melodrama of Those Who Tell the Truth, The Earth is a much warmer affair. Even the title, with its emphasis on the word ""not,"" seems laced with an intense yearning for optimism in the face of horrific circumstance. The inside sleeve of the outstanding album art depicts a sketch of lifeless autumnal leaf wistfully tumbling in the air, only to transform into the body of a fluttering dove. In other words, this is about as close as indie rock gets to an intentionally ""post-9/11"" album. One of the most impressive aspects of The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place is that it feels constantly in flux, growing and transforming with every note. While this achievement would be notable in any genre, in the ceaselessly masturbatory realm of post/indie/prog-rock (really folks, let's just call it ""music""), where bands either take far too long to arrive anywhere (Godspeed You! Black Emperor), or just don't have anyplace special to go (Mogwai), bands that avoid both seem increasingly rare finds. The record's opening track, the aptly titled ""First Breath After Coma"", serves as the perfect testament to this art-rock mastery. It begins with a single lilting electric guitar note, miming the incessant nerve-wracking electrical beeps of a hospital heart monitor. As the shimmering guitar note settles into a steady groove, the echoing thump of a bass drum organically rises out of the shadowy mix, playing the pensive ""lub-dub"" rhythm of a human heart. Each rhythmic line of the guitar and the drums gently coerce one another, cautiously teasing and intertwining until each one explodes into their own new forms; the electric guitar note gives birth to an incessant army of sparkling guitar melodies, while the calming bass drum motif morphs into the rollicking snare attack of a traditional marching beat; and this is all within the first four minutes! The only disappointing aspect of The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place is its lack of more diversified instrumentation. While each of the record's five tracks is given its own title, trying to pick one out from another can be difficult. The tumbling meditative guitar melody that opens ""Six Days at the Bottom of the Ocean"", for instance, seems so reliant upon the feverish guitar freakout that closes ""The Only Moment We Were Alone"" that any track separation would spoil the spotless evolutionary vibe. The band themselves had to have realized this fact, as they list the tracks on the back of the album buried within a blurry din of verbiage having their lengthy album title spelled out ad-nauseum. In this context, by its tail end, Explosion's limiting bass, drums, and double guitar line-up becomes an increasing hindrance. With this album, Explosions in the Sky have constructed a sweetly melodic, inspirationally hopeful album for a genre whose trademark is tragedy. For the astute listener, under the CD tray, amongst the illustrated scattered leaves, lies the answer to the album's desperately optimistic title; it reads ""Because You Are Listening."" It serves as a poignant parting sentiment from a band whose music is as dramatic as finding hope.","When the Texas quartet Explosions in the Sky released their last album, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those ...

Its distinguishing characteristic: tinny anxiety. David Dondero stands a good chance of being canonized by the white-blues scholarbots of the next fiscal millennium, though he's currently just one of the genre's migrant laborers, helping to polish the statues of several of his agitated ancestors and impatient contemporaries (Townes Van Zandt, Gordon Gano, and Simon Joyner, for starters). STANDARD: White blues boasts its own possessed forefather: Daniel Johnston fills the Robert Johnson role. FULFILLMENT: Dondero can shiver on a Johnstonian scale. STANDARD: White blues requires frantically scraped chords alienated from their folk, gospel, and rump-shaking roots. FULFILLMENT: Dondero's uptempo work suggests a one-man Sebadoh (that's heyday Sebadoh) and holds him a spot in the alphabetized archives after Billy Bragg and Chickasaw Mudd Puppies. STANDARD: White blues self-consciously meta-acknowledges its newbie fraudulence as a genre. FULFILLMENT: Dondero poses about journeyman posturing and sings about the woe-joys of songwriting. Aware that he's working in what can be a prestigeless idiom, Dondero performs with the who-wants-some aplomb of a masochistic busker. Aware that the sensitive vagabond songwriter shtick can devolve into an embarrassing piss-contest (during which the acousti-messiahs may as well claim total elephantitis of the heart: ""I can feel the suffering of a jaundiced stepchild three states away"" versus ""I was sensing disturbances in the force back when Alec Guinness was Ewan McGregor playing paddycake on Liam Neeson's lap""), Dondero is careful (on ""Less Than the Air"") to offer an invective against such wallowing: ""You're not the only one who got caught in the rain/ This whole world don't revolve around your pain."" As smart and as likable and as good at maintaining white-blues tumultuousness as Dondero is, the listener will still have difficulty pinpointing what makes this collection singular, despite its all-star supporting cast, including producer Mike Mogis, keys by Wolf Colonel, backup vocals by Conor Oberst, and Tiffany Kowalski's violin lending gypsy tinges of Desire (except for the exuberant ""The Stars Are My Chandelier"", which she helps to launch into Tall Dwarfs-land). Maybe this guy ought to hire outside lyricists, because his arrangements pack so much more wallop than his words, which are often too explanatory, as if Dondero didn't trust the strength of his images and observations. Do we need to be told on the first song that he plays ""the skinny indie white boy blues"" when the third song conjures such blinding shades of pale? I will think, sympathetically, of Dondero whenever I pass an abandoned minivan on the interstate.","I am not talking about ol' E-Clap, or the reverential minstrelsy of juke-nillas such as Jon Spencer or The Black ...

Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell EP,The Flaming Lips,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb713d197565213b5d8/1:1/w_160/3cf52677.jpg,2003-11-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3085-ego-tripping-at-the-gates-of-hell-ep/,Warner Bros.,"I was somewhat looking forward to panning this disc, expecting the worst as it came hot on the heels of the awful, novelty-loaded Fight Test EP. But while Ego Tripping doesn't correct all of Fight Test's misgivings (would somebody please convince these guys to include the damn Yoshimi outtakes already?), it does contain four inspired new originals. One of these, ""Assassination of the Sun"", opens the album with the Lips sounding the loosest they have since The Soft Bulletin. As Wayne Coyne's earnest tenor sings of millions of stars forming into a sun and machines that churn out pain, a breezy rolling drum break drives the song forward alongside floating piano chords and wiry bucolic guitar lines. The track proves not to be a fluke: the two originals that follow it, the interestingly titled instrumental ""I'm a Fly in a Sunbeam (Following the Funeral Procession of a Stranger)"" and the interstellar sex romp ""Sunship Balloons"" equally make good on the meticulously layered, languid atmospherics and anime-inspired, metaphysical pop promise of their last two full-lengths. ""I'm a Fly in a Sunbeam"" sets a serene horn solo against a pulsating backbeat, mellow piano chords and organ drone, drenched in a bath of aquatic reverb. ""Sunship Balloons"" is even better: over an insistently bouncy chopped-up drum break and sparkling electric guitars, Coyne gives up the first Flaming Lips R&B; slow jam, spitting come-ons like, ""Let's do it once/ Let's do it twice/ Let's do it alllll niiiiight until the sunrise comes too soon."" Following the strength of the leading triplet of originals, the middle section of the EP all-too-predictably consists of filler. The remix of ""Do You Realize?"" is the most disappointing, given that it's produced by Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel and Postal Service fame. He takes the original vocal melody of the song and centers it atop a jerky IDM synth beat while laying a straightforwardly boring drum-n-bass break over the chorus. The first remix for ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"", produced by Jason Bentley, would be right at home on Fight Test, stripping the introspective planetary pop of the original and recasting the track as a 1994 chillout track. The second ""Ego Tripping"" remix, by Blow-Up Aka Paolo Cilione and Claudio Camaione, fares only slightly better (though it would've had to have been a total catastrophe to not) with its pounding bass drum pulse, laconic rimshot clicks, and wandering tinny electronic pings and pangs giving way to irrepressibly motivating electro-rhythms. The EP closes with Wayne Coyne's frank plea for world peace via protest-song-cum-Christmas-ditty, ""A Change at Christmas (Say It Isn't So)"". And it's not as bad as you might expect-- if anyone can pull sentimental rubbish like this off in 2003 without sounding like a total jackass it's Coyne, who quixotically asserts: ""If I could stop time it would be for a moment just around Christmas, when mankind reveals its truest potential."" Okay, it's a bit Miss America Pageant, but Coyne's hopeful daydreams are clearly sincere, and dipped in fantastical accompaniment by his fellow bandmates; sparkling triangle and xylophone notes drizzle down from above the optimistic ring of hefty piano chords, all held together by a mischievous drumbreak. Granted, the new material on Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell doesn't exactly show the band's sound evolving, but then, they've pretty much perfected it: ""Assassination of the Sun"" and ""I'm a Fly in the Sunbeam"" in particular would have added another substantial round to Yoshimi's dreampop arsenal, and the others, despite their slightly oddball lyrics, show the band in top form musically. Put simply: Any fan would be thrilled if their next record sounded like this. Still, I'm not sure why the Lips feel obligated to toss in substandard remixes (it's certainly not going to get them club play). Had they cut those from the disc-- or seen fit to include the Yoshimi originals available only on the newly released $20+ Deluxe Edition & DVD version of the album-- it would have made a much more fluid listen. But with the record degenerating into anonymous techno halfway through, it feels less like a unified piece than an overpriced just-in-time-for-the-holidays moneymaker.","I was somewhat looking forward to panning this disc, expecting the worst as it came hot on the heels of ...

New River Head,The Bevis Frond,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29613d19756521388e3/1:1/w_160/0ea91879.gif,2003-11-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/685-new-river-head/,RecklessReckless,"Second only to Twisted Village's Wayne Rogers, Nick Saloman is my choice for king of the 60s psychedelic revival when it finally comes back around. Sort of a J Mascis type (he even has the hair!), the British multi-instrumentalist writes all The Bevis Frond's material; he sings and plays just about every instrument on his albums, engineers and produces them, and then releases them on his and Adrian Shaw's Woronzow label, named after a street near where he grew up. Which, for rock history's sake, was close to Abbey Road. Despite his control-freak tendencies, Saloman comes off as an affable guy without the stoner ego of a guy like Mascis. For starters, he's got major collaborators and not paint-by-numbers cronies feeding off his aura. Most notable is Adrian Shaw (ex-Hawkwind, Magic Muscle, Tom Rapp, etc), who's stuck by Saloman since The Bevis Frond's 1984 inception. In concert, Saloman handles guitar and vocals while Shaw takes the bass; a rotating lineup of drummers-- which on any given day might include Andy Ward (ex-Camel and Marillion) or Joe Propatire (The Silver Apples)-- expand the percussion outward. As of deadline, Saloman's released 16 albums, plus innumerable collaborations, singles, and one-offs. One of his earlier works, New River Head, was first issued in edited form in 1991. This reissued version takes the opposite route: It includes 30 songs spanning two hours and two CDs, restores the six tracks cut from the 1991 version, and tacks on nine new bonus tracks. Beginning with the prerecorded sounds of an old-school British announcer, New River Head wastes no time shifting from ho-hum sampling to blistering guitar work. The first proper track, an instrumental called ""White Sun"", includes the saxophone of Cyke Bancroft (who's illustrated some of The Bevis Frond's album sleeves) alongside Nick Saloman's nuanced riff. The same style comes up in ""Solar Marmalade"", a studio jam that hits a peak early and remains at that level until the end of its eight-minute run. ""He'd Be a Diamond"", a pop song about guys treating girls like shit, has been covered by everyone from Mary Lou Lord (well, obviously) to Juliana Hatfield and Teenage Fanclub. Here, on the original, Saloman croons like Elvis Costello: his voice has often resembled old Four Eyes, but here the structure also follows Costello's pop path. The protracted ""God Speed You to Earth"" is a dramatic landscape of echoey vocals and gentle strums culminating as pure rock bliss, while ""Thankless Task"" serves as Saloman's attempt at writing a traditional folk song with more contemporary themes: ""I felt the image of a damaged hippie chick was more identifiable than, say, a wronged milkmaid."" The result? An upbeat tale that would sound at home on an Incredible String Band album. With a band this expansive and virtuosic, it's interesting to chart the interactions on the inevitable lengthy freakout. ""The Miskatonic Variations II"" weighs in at a mind-altering 16:23, but it sure makes an adequate bridge to the bonus tracks. The dozy atmospheric includes Adrian Shaw, Bari Watts, Current 93's David Tibet, Cyke Bancroft, and Barry Dransfield. Almost new age in its arrested entrance, piano, violin, horn and Tibet's creepy chants lead into Carlos Santana-esque guitars, rock-out drums, and, yeah, a full-on mind-melt. Structurally, it's the songs that came before joining together for a final bow. I was a youngster when New River Head first dropped, and though I wouldn't consider myself a manic fan of The Frond, the other day I tallied nine of the band's records in my collection. Some are less interesting than others, sure, but each is at least somewhat compelling due to Saloman's inclination to forever fuck with psychedelic conventions and tackle diverse genres without a hitch. Within such an impressive body of work, New River Head is certainly the crown jewel. One of the headier agglomerations of the past decade, its non-grasping pace and epic palette issue the breezy confidence of an unmistakable classic.","Second only to Twisted Village's Wayne Rogers, Nick Saloman is my choice for king of the 60s psychedelic revival ...

The Document II,DJ Andy Smith,by: Andy Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ae5e6ef95969322a0a/1:1/w_160/45d64205.jpg,2003-11-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2349-the-document-ii/,Classic,"Andy Smith mixes like I try to review: with an often intolerable confluence of lechery, violence, idiocy, incoherence, and abominable analogies. The body beneath Portishead, Smith DJs with the passion and naivete of someone who covets popular music like it's about to marry his son and cruelly tempt him for the rest of eternity. When someone loves pop culture this much, quality is an afterthought, an extravagance that can only be afforded to imaginary people who have heard everything. Smith knows the number of pop songs you can filter over krush grooves and plush pop is infinite, and goddamn it, he's going to get in as many of those sprightly lunatic anthems as he can. As a result, he also balefully refuses to discern the appalling from the appealing. If there are flaws here, they're the flaws of ceaseless ambition. Smith reaches dizzying heights of Top 40 splendor and underground abysses-- and he keeps on going, without respite, handling, or guidance. The enthusiasm is infectious. We might almost call it cute if we weren't afraid Rakim and Kool Keith would come strangle us with our own backhanded compliments. There are two ways to understand this mix. Both are inaccurate and reconciliation is impossible. First, it's fundamentally a hip-hop album, suffused with rolling, reverberating funk guitars and its fuzz keyboards always supplemented by riotous, exasperating shouts and clamors, like a Pentecostal church built on lunar breaks. The selections range from Mr. Lif's sordid ""The Unorthodox"" to Black Sheep's goof-hop bass-in-the-attic classic ""The Choice Is Yours"". The second way is to realize that this is an album that starts with Kate Bush and romps through blue-eyed soul, grandfather swing and prog before plummeting straight into what could be the worst version of ""Fire"" I've ever heard. It also concludes with the most beguiling, tumultuous, archetypal, somewhat pathetic pop song of the 60s, Barbara Acklin's ""Am I the Same Girl?"", including everything that title would assume: anticipatory love lyrics occasionally delivered in a queasy falsetto, distracting background vocals, and the passion of the singer without any of the passion of the song itself. Needless to say, a far cry from a critical breakdown. Don't even try to figure this out; you'll only hurt yourself in the process. Just ascribe it to some sort of ironic or ""kitsch"" intention and we can all go home, right? This isn't new territory at all for Smith, or for DJ mixes in general. Portishead fashioned their sound by rolling torch songs and jazz ballads into fragile gutter-soaked blunts. But whereas on 1998's The Document swinging from Marvin Gaye to Tom Jones just felt manipulative and contemptible to everyone involved, the new album sounds like someone who quite honestly thinks Mr. Lif could segue into Three Dog Night, a band so antithetical to hip-hop their last ""rap battle"" was with Neil Diamond. Or from the toasters, screeches, and epileptogenic bop of DJ Bombjack's ""Big Beat No. 3"" to the greatest jungle-noir French pop song ever, Serge Gainsbourg's ""Requiem Pour un Con"". It's a persuasive argument that all music was hip-hop, whether a particular genre knew it or not. Of course, this should all be predicated on quality to begin with. If you're mixing James Brown, Kate Bush, and Rakim, it's almost scandalous to make people suffer through Boca 45, Sugarman 3, and other bands so unoriginal they had to plagiarize the names of integers. It's not particularly terrible, but if a mix is all about momentum, these guys are a station wagon's break system. Five by Five's ""Fire"" has got to be the only recorded version known to replace the guitar solos with kazoo. Within the context of the album, it's a bit like seeing Woodstock open for the neighborhood garage band. But then, I just compared half the album to Woodstock, which is about as tenuous and exciting an analogy as anything Smith tries to (or succeeds in) drawing up musically. Smith's actual DJ skills are impeccable and, like all good DJs and governments, virtually imperceptible. He thinks the girth and grit of hip-hop can accommodate the sorrow and sanguinity of old soul 45s without the imposition of irrelevant scratching or vain attempts to show why a DJ can be permitted his vanity. Pop music is the bounteous land of elfin mistresses, drug deals, Vegas showmen, and church congregations. Smith seems inundated, and stimulated, by the excess, a martyr to the street and the sublime stupidity of pop history.","Andy Smith mixes like I try to review: with an often intolerable confluence of lechery, violence, idiocy, incoherence, and abominable ...

Want One,Rufus Wainwright,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b89d034d5c69bf3cd8/1:1/w_160/81399670.jpg,2003-11-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8558-want-one/,Dreamworks,"Rufus Wainwright is a soldier! He's fashioned as a forlorn knight of yore on this record's cover, brandishing a three-foot iron sword, and shrouded in medieval battle armor. But this image misleads: Want One is more a drove casting of arrows than any detailed fencing bout with mythical demons and fire-breathing dragons. The record is something of cinematic effort, composed of roughly half of the material recorded over the course of six months' studio time that yielded thirty-odd products of his unique musical vision. A follow-up, Want Two, is scheduled for future release, and is said to boast the set's more adventurous and cumbersome confections. A Renaissance man in modern application, Wainwright's grand scope here covers a great deal of space and unwittingly mines the ground dug out by many a contemporary artist. With multitracked vocals and lush, complex arrangements (both, Wainwright staples), the ghost of Brian Wilson seems a ubiquitous presence-- especially on numbers such as ""Vicious World"", where Rufus' plaintive, appealing croon takes center stage, backed by a chorus of his own likeness and a finely tuned, direct arrangement. ""Movies of Myself"", with its straight-ahead bounce, drum-led clip, and aberrant guitar crunch, recalls Jason Faulkner. ""14th Street"" is a Jim Croce chorus-line cabaret burlesque, and ""Natasha"" loosely tunes in to early Paul Simon-inflected tribute-narratives. But to say Wainwright is following anything but his own vision would be a misconception. His footsteps mostly lead him back to his earlier cabaret-infused theatre pop and maudlin, hushed anti-ballads. The result is a top-heavy album, with his best material-- the more operatic and unconstrained works-- all unfolded within the album's first half hour. ""Oh What a World"" opens the album with a tuba's reluctant elephant steps and some acoustic plucks, and slowly trickles in a full concert's worth of accompaniment before deploying a string rendition of Ravel's Bolero behind Wainwright's plaintive warble. ""I Don't Know What It Is"" follows in with a slow building, twinkling pop sensibility, carrying his most melodic vocal punch. ""Go or Go Ahead"", the album's most compelling portrait, falls in like fine China crashing to the ground in slow motion, reaching an epic chorus that carries the song just shy of the seven-minute mark. The lyrics carry mythological grandeur, but as with the rest of this album, they're shot through with vulnerability and emotional nudity. ""Vibrate"", then, marks the album's low water mark, taking his stream-of-consciousness, take-me-as-I-am drama too far: Over thin instrumental accompaniment and languished tones he sings, ""My phone's on vibrate for you/ Electroclash is karaoke, too/ I try to dance Britney Spears/ I guess I'm getting on in years."" This, along with ""Natasha"", ""Pretty Things"", and ""Want"" are simply too sparse to offer any real substance. But then ""Beautiful Child"" cuts in, sounding, before the mix becomes too cluttered, like Wainwright fronting an inspired, experimental U2.

And between the scrambling and shifty vulnerability, he stumbles onto something that is uniquely his own. But if there's any momentum to speak of leading into this album's sequel, it's the anchoring weight of Want One's second half, without which the record could survive itself.","Rufus Wainwright is a soldier!

With underground rap constantly evolving and splintering into immediately intriguing subgenres, the formerly ultra-popular white spoken-word rap movement has lost itself in a less than constructive manner. The lackluster nature of recent releases from previous vanguards Dose One and Sole have proven to cement the negative stigma inherent in the scattershot abstract indie rap arena. Having such strikes against his character from the outset, The Listener's debut solo record, Whispermoon, begins fighting against preconception at its outset and closes with less than satisfactory results. Comparisons to his influences are obvious from his opening prose. Standing as a vocal amalgam of MacLethal and Alias, instant issues arise from his monotone delivery and a low vocal mix reminiscent of early Qwel on most tracks. Lyrically, The Listener is Sole without the charisma, hurling word salad manifestos about conversation with train station vagrants, underground financial hierarchy and the importance of metaphorical doors with little variation or impressive metaphors. His delivery tends to be a little dry and awkward, but his conceptual balance helps to equalize any issues you may have with his vocals. Simply put, The Listener is more slam poet than emcee. The saving grace of Whispermoon is its varied production. Instead of struggling over abstract drum arrangements or harsh synth lines, The Listener gets his message across best through rock-solid mid-90s boom-bap and modern sample tricks. Handled mainly by Dust and Gruntwork, the production varies from the distant horn and stuttered strings of ""You're So Underground"" to the sunny guitar, high vocal sample and curled bassline of ""Train Song"" to the wind chimes, whirling synth and lonely piano of ""Ways of the Wind"", utilizing a dark palette of sounds for both ambient and diamond-hard purposes. While housing a couple poorly sequenced beats and several pointlessly esoteric displays of poetic lyricism, The Listener manages to entertain on many levels, displaying obvious talent that, if centered across a similar style of incredibly subtle backdrops with more focused verse structure and a deeper portfolio of rhyme schemes, he could be held in the highest esteem of a relatively uninteresting facet of underground hip-hop. It's his potential to develop a sound that attracts artists from various schools of hip-hop that makes for a bright future in the world of abstract introspective rap.","The Listener is in a rather compromising position.

Ghosts of the Great Highway,Sun Kil Moon,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2279d034d5c69bf2b23/1:1/w_160/8d8677c3.jpg,2003-11-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7722-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/,Jetset,"Drug abuse, jealousy, bloated egos, alcoholism, and sleeping with a band member's girl, are among the numerous inglorious reasons that many a rock and roll band has decided to call it quits. However, among this ignoble collection of excuses, not one reason has dispassionately slain as many of your favorite rockers, and been called out with more misguided sincerity than the proclamation of ""artistic differences;"" otherwise known as the reason Rob Zombie has a solo career. The most continuously baffling aspect of what I will dub, for the purposes of this review, ""Rob Zombie Syndrome"", is that nine times out of ten these ""differences"" only lead an artist to embark on a solo venture where they make music that sounds, for all intents and purposes, exactly the same as the music they had performed with their previous band. Thing is, most of the time this material is bereft of all the frenetic energy and inspiration of their prior group. In light of this gloomy context, Sun Kil Moon, the new solo project from Red House Painters virtuoso Mark Kozelek, can be understood as a miraculous unforeseen godsend for his listening audience. Instead of the album simply serving as a coda to all of Kozelek's previous incarnations, this new batch of material displays him putting to use a variety of wondrous subtle sonic touches that mark unbelievable artistic growth, unraveling unexplored harmonic territory while staying faithful to his trademark brand of languid folk-rock introspection. With Sun Kil Moon, whose members include fellow Red House Painters cohort Anthony Koutsos on drums, American Music Club's Tim Mooney (also on drums), and ex-Black Lab bassist Geoff Stanfield, Kozelek has finally taken the time to fully indulge his own artistic vision. For instance, all of the numbers on Ghosts of the Great Highway are Kozelek originals; in other words, no more AC/DC covers! Furthermore, it seems that, for the first time, Kozelek has put out an album whose meticulous sequencing yields more than just a random scattershot collection of great songs, but rather a complete cohesive musical statement. Ghost of the Great Highway is the sonic equivalent of a tightly woven patchwork quilt, a sprawling aesthetic manifesto overflowing with empathy, warmth, nostalgia, and an intensely resigned anger and yearning to reclaim those who time has taken. The album's wistful opener, ""Glenn Tipton"", serves as a testament to this desire to recover the most modest of moments from one's past. In the song, Kozelek reminisces about debating over boxing legends (""Cassius Clay was hit more than Sonny Liston"") and Judas Priest guitarists (""Some like K.K. Downing and some Glenn Tipton""), while mirroring these discussions to memories of his own dad watching Clark Gable movies on TV. On the stately Neil Young-influenced rocker ""Salvador Sanchez"", Kozelek tells the story of Sanchez, a boxer who died in a fatal car accident at 23; whose story is told, yet again, on the acoustic string-laden stomp of the album's closure, ""Pancho Villa"". The effect of this repeated conflation of iconic ghosts from the past with Kozelek's own personal narratives is remarkably moving. All sense of time and stability are lost; Ghost of the Great Highway comes to symbolize the mechanics of actual memories, where people, places, discussions, events, and disarmingly ordinary and average moments are jumbled longingly together with little sense of any historic time-line outside of one's own experiences. While Kozelek's albums with the Red House Painters never seemed quite colorful enough to sustain for their entire 70-odd-minute lengths, Ghosts of the Great Highway wholeheartedly avoids this same grim fate. The record achieves this vibrancy largely through balancing Kozelek's retrospective vocals, and penchant for acoustic and electric guitar noodling, with dazzlingly exotic arrangements, and inspirationally subtle instrumentation. On the blissfully tender ""Gentle Moon"", the calming strum of acoustic guitars is blanketed within the shimmer of a brilliant electric guitar melody, all the while twinkling xylophone notes sparkle and luscious sweeping strings color Kozelek's frail tenor. While on the obligatory 14-minute psych-rock epic, ""Duk Koo Kim"", a fuzzy pensive electric guitar motif gives way to the valiant insistent strums of an army of mandolins, only to be draped by a rainstorm of solitary acoustic guitar notes. Sun Kil Moon's Ghost of the Great Highway is a modest win for great music everywhere: it is the triumphant sound of an industry underdog finally making good on his past potential, and consequently demanding some long unappreciated due. The fact that it wasn't with Red House Painters is an irony that only makes this victory of an album that much sweeter.","Drug abuse, jealousy, bloated egos, alcoholism, and sleeping with a band member's girl, are among the numerous inglorious reasons ...

Let It Be... Naked,The Beatles,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44113d1975652138c8b/1:1/w_160/b65d69c5.jpg,2003-11-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1093-let-it-be-naked/,Capitol,"""I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey & The Deaf Aids."" ...Or some such convoluted story. All these years after the fact, what is clear is that The Beatles were special mainly because they were dedicated to producing things nobody else could. These songs, the band's persona, the stances they took and lessons learned in front of the camera weren't just the exploits of a popular band, but live memoirs of the spiritual, artistic and disciplined Ideal. For each word written and photo taken of all manner of celebrities, they are still arguably the only group of musicians worth talking about with the same significance as any world leader or religious icon you care to name-- at least in the West. Bigger than Jesus? All you need is love, and there is nothing I could write about them that isn't a cliché a hundred times over. Because of this, most folks with a half a brain refuse to write about them in the same boundless way fans and journalists did in the 60s. I suppose this is a wise choice; after all, I'm about as interested in sifting through their complete story right now as I am in reading the dictionary cover-to-cover. Sure, it's ""important,"" if music and people and getting swept up in a minor revolution of love and change is important, but it's too fucking much. Collectively, The Beatles had so many ideas, made so much music, affected so many people, inspired so much good (and bad) that they were necessarily bigger than life. Thus, we're necessarily stuck with tackling this stuff bit by bit. It's a story of looking at things under a microscope, taking things slowly and trying to remember why we were so interested in the first place; it's a story of uncovering some small kernel of their legacy and watching it wind its way back to the center. Everything worthwhile gets back eventually. ""Phase one in which Doris gets her oats."" Paul McCartney is a smug, charmless fuck. Ahem: ""The great thing now about the remixed versions is that, with today's technology, they sound better than ever."" If he had any humility, he'd insert a joke about receiving a bonus CD of outtakes when you ordered now; let's see some testimonials from satisfied customers as they pump their Beatles-themed parties, and claim, ""Listening to this stuff brings back so many memories!"" If his reasons for bringing you the ""real"" Let It Be seem cribbed from an infomercial, one can hardly fault his timing. George Harrison did, in fact, sign off on this release before his death, but given that he actually quit the band during the original sessions, one can only hope McCartney is reaping all his karmic just desserts for this ""naked"" edition. In January 1969, about six weeks after The White Album was released, the band more-or-less agreed that their next project would involve being filmed as they performed their music. Well, at least they agreed they should be filmed; or, they had certainly been open to the idea of all being in the same place at the same time, working on music, possibly making a movie (but ""no movies,"" as Harrison protested) and maybe eventually playing live somewhere in an Arabic desert. Or France. Or maybe on the rooftop of their studios. Oh, and, ""Any of us can do separate things as well and that way it also preserves The Beatles bit."" Hmm, but, ""What we're doing is still rehearsing and we'll get it together."" ""We'll collect our thoughts and you collect yours."" The sessions and rehearsals that eventually produced the original issue of Let It Be have been rightfully documented as disorganized and tension-filled. After spending a month being filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg (who they'd already worked with on videos for ""Hey Jude"" and ""Revolution"", among others) as they rehearsed new material, and having put so much sound to tape that no one could be bothered to sift through it all when the time came to deliver an actual product, the band, realizing their defeat, handed it all off to engineer Glyn Johns and moved on to their next project. One original idea for these sessions was merely to be filmed performing songs from The White Album; another was that they should get back to their roots of performing raving rock 'n' roll in front of an audience. Typically, The Beatles' ideas and ambitions far outreached what they could possibly have achieved on their own-- and for the first time since they'd been together, most of them were too tired, distracted or otherwise uninspired to make sure all those ridiculous ideas actually materialized. Johns compiled his version of what the record should be: studio chatter, adlibs, many rough takes of new songs and even off-the-cuff covers. He was chosen because of his work with The Rolling Stones, but only too soon discovered that his new employers operated differently. Even after several modifications and release dates, his compilation was rejected. The tapes were shelved until the band agreed to let legendary producer Phil Spector have a go at squeezing a good record out of them. It should be noted that while The Beatles were only too happy to rid themselves of the burden of Let It Be, they were working with George Martin on Abbey Road in exactly the same way they always had: If perfectionism and pride were forgotten in the winter of '69, apparently they could make amends on a ""proper"" LP. Of course, when the band actually heard what Spector had produced, they balked (well, most of the time, depending on who was arguing with who). Nevertheless, Let It Be was released in January 1970, after Abbey Road, and despite considerable differences of opinion on its ""greatness"" at the time, it has become yet another canonical set of Beatle music. So what did Spector produce? First, he added a couple of songs, including an old throwaway by Lennon called ""Across the Universe"", which was originally from 1968 and had recently been released on a charity compilation called No One's Gonna Change Our World. Secondly, he beefed up some of the rather sparse arrangements with ersatz orchestral and choral parts-- much to the fury of McCartney after hearing his ""The Long and Winding Road"" turned into a Hallmark commercial. Never mind that Spector had at least given the band a releasable record, including managing to turn a minute-and-a-half Harrison song fragment into ""I Me Mine"". Given McCartney's famed disgust over the resulting LP, his enthusiasm to issue his idea of how this music should sound shouldn't surprise anyone. Let It Be... Naked is a remixed, resequenced presentation of the most maligned Beatles album, and for better or for worse, will wrap no loose ends whatsoever. ""Don't Let Me Down"" The best news about this record is that the songs themselves have not changed much in 33 years. Those of you who love ""Across the Universe"" and ""Two of Us"" for their elegant simplicity and overwhelming beauty will be happy to know they haven't changed, even if these performances are not the ones to which we've become accustomed. By the same token, I don't think I can ever love ""The Long and Winding Road""; sure, the choirs were a bit much, but then, McCartney didn't really need them to lay on some pretty thick drama. In any case, once over the initial shock of the new song order, Naked will seem very familiar to fans. The sound is perfect, of course. If anything, Naked serves as a great argument for a project to remaster all of the original Beatle albums. Producers Paul Hicks, Guy Massey and Allan Rouse have done an excellent job cleaning up whatever warts were on the original tapes, and presenting these songs in a fresh way without resorting to making them sound overly ""modern."" They've also somehow found a way to make McCartney play in tune, so I can only be grateful for that. Now I must ask: Why? In 2003, there are few people clamoring for an alternate version of Let It Be, and those that are have almost certainly discovered the myriad bootlegs offering every possible combination of halfway-finished covers and studio banter. There is Beatle music yet to be released that should be: My pick would have been a legit issue of their sessions at George's house playing The White Album songs unplugged before recording them. This is music that lends a considerably different light to their music than any remix ever could, and also has the advantage of not being horrifically over-analyzed for the past 30 years. Conversely, Naked is really only interesting as a mild curio, for fighting the boots and for the strangeness of reading a lecture on the wrongs of music-sharing placed within the cover of a Beatles record. ""Riffs are the only thing that will help all of us."" So then, the tunes. To my ears, ""Get Back"" and ""For You Blue"" are unchanged. The difference is that ""Get Back"" now leads off the record, and ""For You Blue"" is slotted third, suggesting McCartney thinks more of it than Spector did. Likewise, ""I Me Mine"" features the same familiar Harrison vocals and guitar lines, but is completely stripped of the cinematic Spector backing arrangement. ""The Long and Winding Road"" also seems mostly the same, minus the orchestra and choir. However, listening more closely, I'm sure this is a different performance; McCartney's vocal wavers slightly and Billy Preston's organ solo gives it a subtle, soulful feel, reminiscent of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" (one of McCartney's favorite songs). However, what's immediately noticeable is the marked clarity of all of these songs. Ringo's hi-hat is crisp, Harrison's Leslie'd asides are in plain sight, rather than being buried by excitable sopranos. Lennon's ""Don't Let Me Down"" wasn't on the original LP but was rehearsed at the same sessions. The band performs it here more uptempo than on the released ""Get Back"" B-side, and generally more ragged-- as is to be expected, given that this was pulled from their famous rooftop performance. Lennon lets loose with some wailing falsetto near the end, and even though they weren't the tightest outfit ever to play, few can deny the contagious enthusiasm they mustered onstage. ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""One After 909"" are also pulled from the roof concert, and are similarly raw. Still, they're hardly bad recordings and I wonder why the band was so reluctant to release them at the time. The tracks that struck me most on Naked were ""Let It Be"" and ""Across the Universe"". The former because it seems very much improved with this remix; the Harrison guitar solo is new, so this is likely a different version than was released originally, and the hymnal-esque backing vocals are gorgeously placed across the aural plane in the mix. These are the kinds of changes that make Naked an interesting listen for longtime fans, and raise the question of the powers that be possibly issuing a full-length project of Beatles remixes wherein drastic changes are made to songs without the obligation of placing the project alongside the rest of their proper LPs, as if this is the way they were ""meant"" to be. That said, ""Across the Universe"" is the same (slowed-down) vocal and guitar from Let It Be, but with more reverb and soft sitar-like sounds. Though there's already a beautiful, lesser-known version of this track available (an elaborate George Martin-produced studio version with a background children's choir and bird chirps), this take eclipses the already beautiful original Let It Be version as the second-best performance of the song. Let It Be... Naked also comes with a second disc entitled Fly on the Wall, consisting of several short fragments of studio conversation and song rehearsals, amounting to approximately 21 minutes of bonus material. This disc will doubtless be fascinating to fans, and in particular the snippets of John performing a very early version of ""Imagine"" (here referenced as ""John's Piano Piece""), and a short, striking version of Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"", obviously influenced by his time spent with Bob Dylan and The Band in America the previous year. However, given that the entire two-disc set runs less than an hour, I wonder why it wasn't condensed to a single disc. Furthermore, if a 21-minute outtakes collection deserves its own bonus disc, why not expand this material to fill the rest of the CD? Apparently, releasing two versions of Let It Be make more sense to the remaining Beatles than giving fans something new. ""Let It Be"" Ultimately, Naked is not essential. Unlike scattered moments in the Anthology series, this music, though immaculately presented, doesn't really expand on either the music of Let It Be, or The Beatles' legacy. At this point, I'm not sure many people are prepared to accept a new take on the band anyway, but I might at least be happy knowing they didn't take me for a raving completist. And yet, I stood in line for this, just like millions of other like-minded fans will, merely for the chance to hear some small kernel leading me back to the reason I started listening in the first place. The albums will always be there, and the legend will forever be imprinted on the hearts of anyone believing in the affirming power of their music. In the end, regardless of what I write, this is The Beatles, and you already know what that means.","""I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey & The Deaf Aids.""

Silence Is Easy,Starsailor,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a551b1335d7bf1698b87/1:1/w_160/54f5b5ee.jpg,2003-11-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7480-silence-is-easy/,Capitol,"The recipe for chart-topping Britpop these days seems fairly straightforward: start with a rock ballad, mix in lyrics about restless hearts and rolling meadows sung in a lilting falsetto by a northern golden boy, add layer upon layer of symphonic string arrangements, a sprinkle of piano here, a dash of plucked guitar there, and voila! See you at the Reading Festival, mate! Starsailor (the name comes from the Tim Buckley LP) revels in all of these romantic pretensions on Silence Is Easy, their melodramatic, overproduced, but not altogether unpleasant sophomore release. The new album covers a lot of the same territory as their platinum-selling 2001 debut, Love Is Here: Like any self-respecting English bard, singer/guitarist James Walsh piles-on references to clear skies, sunshine, cafes, rising seas, and a-love-that-will-somehow-find-a-way, which compliment the maudlin orchestral overtones on much of the album. Defiantly sappy, Silence Is Easy survives mostly on Walsh's oddly graceful singing. Unfortunately, the music on the whole is prosaic, even boring at times. It just sweeps right past you, like an unnoticed breeze. The release of the un-Spectorized Let It Be...Naked on Tuesday made abundantly clear the sort of havoc that Phil Spector can wreak on an album. And while only two of the tracks on Silence Is Easy were produced by the gun-toting maniac, his presence is palpable on the entire record. The song ""Telling Them"", for instance, starts out decently enough, with Walsh sounding like a young Robert Plant over Barry Westhead's piano playing and Ben Byrne's punctual drumming. But, thanks no doubt to Spector's influence, the band is quickly overtaken by a cello and some accompanying strings that work themselves into a sentimental lather worthy of a Rob Reiner film. ""Fidelity"", too, has the makings of a nice rock song, with cutting, tumultuous guitars and a catchy chorus. But it also feels too careful, too deliberate and fussed over to have a genuinely cathartic effect, and the overwrought harmonies bury the track before it's had a chance to live. Walsh sounds alternately like Thom Yorke, Neil Young, Chris Martin and Jeff Buckley, though he isn't a smidgen of the songwriter that any of them are (or were). His lyrics prove him incapable of understatement (a problem that apparently doesn't afflict him in conversation: ""I think some of the last record sounded overwrought in parts,"" he said recently about Love Is Here). On Silence Is Easy, Walsh recycles truisms about love, sex, hate and co-dependance without any insights or significant lessons to add. Of course, few songwriters have anything consistently new to say, but in the course of an album, a song or two should catch you in a way that makes you sit up and say, ""Yep."" Walsh isn't quite there yet. ""Four to the Floor"" opens with a hip-hop beat and a funk bassline, but is soon engulfed by more strings, which promptly crowd out the other instruments. What at first sounds like the soundtrack to a 70s film car chase is instead a pathetically crafted metaphor for, what else, but the thrill of new love. ""Four to the Floor, I was sure that you would be my girl,"" Walsh sings lamely. This is the point in the album where you might start thinking, ""C'mon, man, fucking pull yourself together! Enough with the chicks already!"" Despite these myriad complaints, Silence Is Easy actually has its share of tolerable moments. Walsh is undoubtedly talented and his songs can be endearing even in their shameless mushiness. Give him some time to shake off this Phil Spector phase (he'll ruin you like a diseased whore, Walsh!) and who knows how he'll develop musically. For now, silence would be better.","The recipe for chart-topping Britpop these days seems fairly straightforward: start with a rock ballad, mix in lyrics about restless ...

Usually packed fat with studio scraps, bits of live shows, dubious band experiments, covers, and a mess of other shit that doesn't quite fit anywhere else, outtakes discs are typically devised as a boon for completists, assembled without the internal and temporal cohesion of an album, and delivered to the public with minimal ceremony. Check the outtakes disc as the musical equivalent of a Sunday morning yard sale: a row of rickety folding tables overstocked with dusty, aging crap that was deemed too valuable to toss blindly, but not considered functional enough to keep around. Staple a construction paper sign to the nearest telephone pole, drag a rusty plastic lawn chair out from the garage, and sell every last thing for a dollar. Irish folk-rockers The Frames have been fractured and reassembled a ridiculous number of times since their original formation in 1990, and their latest release, The Roads Outgrown, features selected non-pieces and leftovers from their last three years as a performing unit: a Will Oldham cover (""Tomorrow's Too Long""), a Mic Christopher song (""Listen Girl""), an outtake from their 2000 Albini sessions (""Rise""), a handful of reworked tracks from their last full-length (2001's For the Birds) and a fiery, ten-minute live version of a cut from their second record (""Fitzcarraldo""). It's classic outtakes-collage, cobbled together from disparate sessions/periods/albums, but, surprisingly, The Roads Outgrown plays more like a cohesive project, its seemingly unrelated cuts assembled with an artful sense of unity. The Roads Outgrown also functions as an oddly convincing introduction to the band, showing how their different methods/lineups always reach the same earthy conclusion: earnest, vaguely melancholic folk songs punctuated by quivering violins and frontman Glen Hansard's shaky country croon. Excellent opener ""Lay Me Down"" (reworked and re-recorded at ""Joan's house"" before being selected for inclusion here) layers a light acoustic guitar melody over heavy bass-drum thumping, easing out in a haze of violin pulls, Hansard's voice flitting from whisper to coo. ""Headlong"" follows, sounding a bit like a Radiohead circa-The Bends B-side, as Hansard howls and strums with welcome intensity. The Oldham cover, meanwhile, is plumped up with whining fiddles and half-whispered vocals, The Frames' delicate instrumentation breathing new warmth into Will's obtuse poetics. The Frames' understanding of their own discography seems to have informed the fluidity of this collection, and its song-to-song coherence is both impressive and perplexing; while boldly varied in tempo, volume, and style, The Roads Outgrown is always concerned with its implicit mission-- namely, offering sincere, cerebral folk-pop crafted with the quiet confidence of a thirteen-year career.","Conceptually, the collection of B-sides, outtakes, and arbitrary live tracks is an underwhelming proposition.

Black Rooster EP,The Kills,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb985e6ef95969322c4d/1:1/w_160/324fdfff.jpg,2003-11-18 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4426-black-rooster-ep/,Dim MakDim Mak,"I first heard The Kills on the day that Waylon Jennings died and, despite a crushing bleakness that enveloped me like a giant pair of shit-stained undies, they made me feel a little better about life. Later that day I told a female acquaintance (someone who'd had the misfortune of being educated in Northeastern private schools and naturally had no idea of who Waylon Jennings was) about Waylon and she thought I meant Peter Jennings, the newscaster. ""Oh noooo,"" she said slowly, cupping her hand to her mouth, ""Not Peee-ter. He was soooo great."" We were at a barbecue eating shish kabobs, and I credit The Kills with preventing me from plunging my metal poker straight through that girl's black heart. One-half of The Kills is Alison ""VV"" Mosshart, a Floridian who, along with Sam Beam of Iron & Wine, may eventually rehabilitate the sullied name of that near-forgotten state. She sings like Joan Jett, though initially, you might recall Happy Days' Pinky Tuscadero, whose coquettish growl stood in poetic juxtaposition to the leather body suit, kerchief and biker gloves that she sashayed in onstage. Remember the episode where Pinky battles the Malachi brothers in a demolition derby and gets righteously mangled? When the Fonz lifts her limp body from the wreckage he has this implacable look in his eyes-- a look he wore only once before, if memory serves me correctly, when Al's restaurant burned down-- and you just know some beatdowns are imminent. Man! That still gives me goose bumps. The point being, VV puts the melodrama to good use. Her voice has a frenetic, indignant quality much like Karen O's, and it's the foundation of four out of the five songs on their freshly reissued Black Rooster EP. The other half of The Kills is Londoner Jamie ""Hotel"" Hince. Aside from having the coolest nickname on the other side of the Big Drink, Hotel plays a furious, unwieldy guitar that provides the perfect accompaniment to VV's vengeance-minded crooning. Their transatlantic collaboration has a peculiar resonance on the song ""Cat Claw"", which sounds something like if The Stooges cut a single with Boss Hog. The drumming is relentless but understated, and the lyrics (some of which are inscrutable) are violently lustful: ""Never know who comes it might easily be me/ You don't give a fuck for my love 'cause that's too much."" On the title track, Hotel and VV trade come-ons in a call-and-response chorus: ""You wanna fuck and fight?/ In the basement/ The kid gotta rattlesnake gun/ In the basement."" Both songs bring to mind a softcore version of Backyard Wrestling with Sean Connery versus he-woman Jennifer Capriati. The Kills have earned comparisons to Captain Beefheart (which is sorta fucked), but they owe more of a debt to Sonic Youth and Royal Trux-- though Black Rooster is neither as self-indulgent or drug-obsessed as Herrema and Hagerty in their prime. Aside from the last track, an experimental throwaway titled ""Gum"", the songs on this EP make for an extraordinary debut.","I first heard The Kills on the day that Waylon Jennings died and, despite a crushing bleakness that enveloped me ...

Jay Dee asks on the ""The Mission"", a standout track on his new collaboration with ultra-prolific producer Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib). It's not so much a hard-fast rule as it is an unfortunate trend that producers rarely get in front of a mic-- producers like Kanye West and El-P have frequently proven themselves capable of holding their own with heavyweight emcee. Fortunately, these two haven't had much trouble making time for rhymes: Jay Dee's appeared prominently with Slum Village on 2000's Fantastic Vol. II and solo on the 2001 BBE release of Welcome 2 Detroit, while Madlib has put down lyrics with the legendary Oxnard, California-based underground collective Lootpack and on his own solo records as himself (this year's Blue Note-sampling Shades of Blue) and Quasimoto (2001's The Unseen). The concept behind the Jaylib project, then, seems a logical conclusion: each provide beats for the other's rhymes. As expected, Champion Sound is unquestionably one of the most exciting and inventive hip-hop productions this year: Jay Dee's characteristically bass-heavy breaks and Madlib's wonderfully off-kilter quasi-organic dutchery compliment each other perfectly, and their best moments here easily rank among their personal highs. But call it a self-fulfilling prophecy: the lyrics are its Achilles' heel. Jay Dee and Madlib change places with each successive track, but their message-- mostly that ""Jay Dee and Madlib are collabin',"" that they ""are in this mothafucka,"" and ""live bitches is what [we] need""-- rarely butterflies into much else. Fortunately, the record's focus doesn't rest on its lyrics: Madlib-produced ""McNasty Filth"" assume's the role of party track and just kills, alternately flaunting organ and baritone sax drones before upshifting into some vaguely Prefusian cut-ups and a hi-hat's violent treble attacks. Title-track ""Champion Sound"", also produced by Madlib, comes peppered with ample fuzz and an offbeat chorus of ""Wah!"" while orbiting a sultry female vocal sample. ""Strip Club"" is the album's most amusing track, a quirky steel drum sample reminiscent of Super Mario 2 backing a brilliant dialogue between the duo in which Quasimoto plays a stripper offering deeper intimacy: ""I can touch you and you can touch me."" Three ""The"" tracks-- single ""The Red"", B-side ""The Official"", and above-mentioned ""The Mission""-- make for Champion Sound's best moments. Pulling no punches, ""The Red"" packs a spooky piano vamp and female chorus sample into a characteristically minimal Jay Dee backbeat, over which Madlib throws out a host of shoutouts and the occasional Quasimoto-ism. Madlib's muted trumpets on ""The Official"" recall Miles Davis' late 50s work with Gil Evans (particularly Miles Ahead or 1960's Sketches of Spain), and its understatement is answered in opposite by the fast-paced sampling, boastful string vamp and Philly soul-style horns of ""The Mission"". If there were a scorecard for Champion Sound, Madlib would undoubtedly receive higher marks than J Dilla on both sides of the beat, but both far exceed the buffoonery of guest rapper Talib Kweli on ""Raw Shit"", the album's abysmal low-point. Lazy production, lame tropes like, ""Everybody say I love/ That bullshit/ I like it/ I love it,"" and, ""Everybody just gather 'round / 'Cause all we want to do/ Is get on down,"" and Kweli's incongruously deadpan delivery make this track pretty much unlistenable. The disjointed ""React"", while interesting, becomes grating before it finally closes out, and Madlib's initially promising revolver-like beat on ""Strapped"" is a similar headache. Fortunately, slip-ups like these are few and far between. Champion Sound in theory is a remarkable proposition, and for the most part the Jaylib team deliver the ridiculous beats expected of them while, perhaps ironically, acknowledging in verse the album's lyrical shortcomings. The tracks floating around from the Madvillain sessions, a similar Stones Throw collaboration between MF Doom and Madlib, seem more promising both lyrically and musically, but in the end, Champion Sound is itself certainly no lightweight.","""And who said producers ain't supposed to rap?""

It's a Crackhaus Thing,DeadbeatStephen Beaupré,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d013d1975652139746/1:1/w_160/c11c2574.gif,2003-11-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2220-its-a-crackhaus-thing/,Onitor,"It's extra special when you can have both, but I'll take ""good"" over ""original"" any day. Last year, Montreal's Scott Monteith, who records as Deadbeat, released Wildlife Documentaries. Solid record, but the extreme influence of Stefan Betke (aka Pole) was what stood out most. Deadbeat adopted the glitched-out dub and ghosted synths wholesale, without adding much of his own personality to the mix-- and the fact that Wildlife Documentaries was released on Betke's ~scape made the similarities that much more glaring. Now Deadbeat returns in collaboration with fellow Montreal resident Stephen Beaupré to make ""crackhaus"" for Stuttgart's Onitor label. Catchy new genre name, to be sure, but it wasn't necessary: The two claim to have been ""inspired"" by Akufen (Marc Leclair from, yes, Montreal), and in fact, they're working completely in the realm of what Leclair called ""microsampling."" The Montreal crew share a technique, processing tiny fragments of sound into bubbling, funky, minimal house music. Akufen pulled his material from the radio exclusively on My Way, where the Crackheadz use additional sound sources a la Matthew Herbert, another acknowledged inspiration. House producer Todd Edwards predated all these guys with this business, for those keeping score at home. So originality is out, but that's all right. Monteith and Beaupré are completely open about where their ideas come from, and most important, they do great things with them. To my ears, It's a Crackhaus Thing beats the pants off the enjoyable but overrated My Way and dances happily away with Leclair's trousers on its head. The key for Monteith and Beaupré is their restraint with their samples. They keep their sequences short and simple, playing up the hook when it's there and letting it slink to the background when it's not. And then throughout, their massively satisfying basslines pick up the slack. Their approach to sound, despite the glitches, is clean and welcoming. All the sharp digital edges have been sanded out to allow more room for movement. And there should be movement. Though house is the centerpoint, there are twists to the beats. ""Shine Your Light"", which builds a riff from a sampled gospel moan and a harmonica blast, has a pogo effect on the upbeat that gives the 4/4 beat a bit more bounce. ""Little Cosmonaut"" and ""Single.mtl"" organize the tiny sound hacks (percussive taps, half-syllables, a doorslam) into a loping gait, a sort of rounded shuffle under and around the bass drum, all bolstered by the snaking bass. Like Herbert, Monteith and Beaupré have a skill for turning the everyday noise into funky percussion that blends with the soundfield of the individual track. So when a squeaky motor is sampled and looped to form the beat for ""Who Says"", it doesn't draw attention to itself. It sounds like the right instrument for the rhythm, not some shoehorned fragment that sounded too cool not to be used somewhere. Monteith and Beaupré know their strengths with Crackhaus and play to them. There are no extended builds here, no allusions to a peak they cannot reach; rather, the nine tracks range from 5\xBD to 7\xBD minutes, just long enough to let the groove build but never outstaying their welcome. If the dynamic range is a bit flat, this accentuates the functional nature of this physical music, where emotion is muted in favor of more reptilian pleasures. Here on my rock it feels as good as the morning sun.","It's extra special when you can have both, but I'll take ""good"" over ""original"" any day. Last year ...

Monolith,Omid,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fb5e6ef959693202f5/1:1/w_160/3e45cb67.jpg,2003-11-18 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6091-monolith/,Mush,"Defining what makes a good producer is one of the most subjective arguments a critic can make. Some appreciate pure, raw sample building, some praise sharp, calculated synthetic melodies and others simply opt for a position that can create tension or atmosphere. In the case of Mush Records' latest upstart, Omid tries everything on his debut LP, Monolith, but never quite creates an identity. The first comparison to be made is that his style of production stands as an admittedly intriguing amalgam of Anticon lo-fi and West Coast underground bombast. His focus is utterly scattered, making it difficult to define his approach: ""Live from Tokyo"" is Rick Rubin minimalism, a display of stutter crunk with horns and boardwalk bass thump, ""Double Header"" is an idiosyncratic, heavy-drummed carnival whistle bounce, while ""Ripple Study"" is fuzz-synth shimmer with popping, clicking drums and analog noises. Unfortunately, it's never as interesting as it sounds-- the concepts sound ethereal, but the actual composition leaves much to be desired. Instead of being concise like Prefuse 73 or adding various phaseshifts like Rjd2, Omid is content to let his compositions drift stationary or shift to less than interesting directions. In the most basic terms, Omid's a decent producer with no idea how to pace an instrumental. As with many modern instrumentalist showcases, Omid has called in a few of his subterranean friends to bless his soundscapes, with varying degrees of success. While Hyminal comes off like a fake Saul Williams (that is to say, faker), Busdriver never utilizes his mastery of speed rap or melody, instead opting to cover his voice in radio feedback while screaming anti-Bush rhetoric over jagged Alec Empire-styled noise synth, and even Buck 65 sounds uninspired, retreading tired baseball metaphors and sleepwalking through what sounds like a series of unrelated outtakes. ""Live from Tokyo"", though, is the biggest disappointment by some distance. Featuring Slug, Aceyalone, MURS, and Luckyiam.PSC, the track seemed to bear incredible promise. The retro pause-funk of the beat could've easily inspired better performances from each artist, but it seems as if Omid's production purely draws mediocrity from rappers, regardless of his obvious talent. Aceyalone lets us (and the friends he's obviously now writing verses to) know that he's ""not Japanese,"" but rather ""Nigganese,"" while Slug manages once again to provide a verse with stunningly elaborate depth that means absolutely nothing: he esoterically insults MC No One and focuses on a woman's facial features in a single verse. Less sprawling than the Anticon production team, yet too unpolished to hope for commercial viability, Omid is caught in a production paradox. His work is never bad, but he rarely takes his beats far enough to carry an album based solely around an artist's background musical talent. If Omid can manage to master a single style, instead of haphazardly attempting several approaches, he might yet carve his niche in the turbulent underground.","Defining what makes a good producer is one of the most subjective arguments a critic can make.

Motor Motel Love Songs,Jason Collett,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ea13d19756521392b8/1:1/w_160/725dcd39.jpg,2003-11-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1736-motor-motel-love-songs/,Arts & Crafts,"It seems that among every self-respecting indie rock label collective, amidst the motley crew of obligatory producer/multi-instrumentalists, folksy female singer/songwriters, reclusive genius frontmen, and the dude who's always selling the merch, lurks another none-too-rare breed of indie rock royalty: the earnest male singer/songwriter. Yes, we've all seen them, usually pathologically clutching their browbeaten acoustic guitars while gently emoting nostalgic notes of heartbreak. In fact, they're most likely spotted conveniently serving as a handy opening act for your favorite label's marquee band; which, if you're really lucky, this broken-hearted rebel may also serve as a member of. Such is the case with Broken Social Scene guitarist/songwriter Jason Collett. His debut solo album for the ever-expanding Canadian all-star label, Arts & Crafts, is titled Motor Motel Love Songs, and predictably features a selection of his finest moments from off of his earlier self-released discs. Unfortunately, this record bears three strikes against it even before we're able to get the album out of its shrinkwrap. With a title as yearningly cliched as Motor Motel Love Songs, and a tracklist that reads sappier than Hugh Grant's film canon (sample track titles: ""Bitter Beauty"", ""Tiny Ocean of Tears"" and ""All I've Ever Known""), it looks bleak for the originality of the music within; and, for the record, I'll just let the numbingly pastoral cover art speak for itself. However, the real obstacle this record faces is the dazzling modest beauty of one of this year's most outstanding releases, Broken Social Scene's You Forgot It in People. It is a resounding disappointment that Collett's run-of-the-mill solo work bears little in common with the epic fractured subtleties of his focal band's sound, and anyone left searching for lingering elements of Broken Social Scene's music will undoubtedly be left disappointed. In spite of all of this, one of the most surprising elements of Motor Motel Love Songs is that, while the album fails to break any new musical territory, Collett is incredibly adept at recreating the melodic sunny ambience, and California strum of 70s-era AM pop. Despite featuring a lyric as banal as ""I know it's complicated, but don't you think giving up is so overrated,"" the sparkly telecaster rock of ""Tiny Ocean of Tears"" is melodically charming. The mid-tempo muted hum of ""Choke Cherry"" and the Woody Guthrie-inspired litany of ""Honey I Don't Know"", both seem to serve as perfect musical canvases for the self-introspection of the protagonists in each of the numbers. Furthermore, a disarmingly offhand song like ""Gabe"", which drives along on an empathetically understated melodic line three times removed from Pete Yorn, Eddie Vedder, and The Eagles, seems to become more insistently catchy with each listen. The real saving grace of Motor Motel Love Songs, though, is Andrew Cash's flawlessly restrained production. Despite reaching success on his own with the obscure 80s alternative group, L'etranger, fellow Toronto stalwarts Cash and Collett have had a long history of collaboration together including serving as fellow band members in The Andrew Cash Band, Ursula, and Bird. On a number like the memorably idyllic ""Blue Sky"", Cash supplies Collett's rambling bucolic melody with a gleaming, stripped-down accompaniment, made up of a snaky bassline, choppy reverb-drenched guitars, and a mellow organ refrain played by fellow Broken Social Scene cohort Brendan Canning. And on the countrified midtempo rocker that serves as the album's opener, ""Bitter Beauty"", Cash uses all these same elements and adds a brilliant layer of sun-drenched vocal harmonies as a perfect accent to the already rootsy mix. Motor Motel Love Songs will likely have Collett's listening audience despondently frustrated with his trite cliché hopping and swooning after his timeless rustic melodies all at the same time. While he may not appear much different from the legions of other singer/songwriter hopefuls, resigning to sing their proverbial musical diaries to indifferent chatty audiences at dive bar venues across the globe, he adequately gets by with a little help from his friends.","It seems that among every self-respecting indie rock label collective, amidst the motley crew of obligatory\n\ producer/multi-instrumentalists, folksy ...

Today Is the Day!

Don't cross the particle beams, but more importantly, as realized by noted physicist Robert Zemeckis, under no circumstances should you go back in time to make a sequel (or two). That said, we stand at the threshold-- nay, the edge of a precipice-- looking out into the unknowable abyss, preparing to shatter one such limitation of the universe-at-large; this is the final frontier (but for real this time), and our guide is none other than Yo La Tengo. Ladies and gentlemen, Yo La Tengo have covered themselves. Years of pledge drives spent taking requests-- not of their own material, but of nearly any song that can be conceivably recreated with guitar, drum, and bass-- in benefit of their local radio station WFMU should leave Yo La Tengo's dominance of ""the cover"" incontestable. With more than fifty years of rock and roll history as fair game, that YLT can even be so consistently competent is nothing short of remarkable, but the truth is, imperfect or not, they do a hell of a lot better than mere competence. To reinterpret themselves is the last stone unturned; it was only a matter of time. Today is the day, folks; here, they revisit the improbably homogenous Summer Sun's most fully-realized track, and ""Cherry Chapstick"", a rare pop standout among the wintry 'scapes of And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. The concept alone is uniquely impressive in its sheer simplicity, but in execution, it's absolutely sublime; actually, YLT has reworked songs in the past (""Tom Courtenay"", among others), but never before have they seemed so not only fundamental, but immediately relevant as well. It's unlikely that YLT set out with any intentions of silencing some of the critical dissent surrounding either of their last two albums, but it so happens that by turning these tunes inside-out, and exposing the vibrance beneath their docile veneer (and vice versa), the most pressing flaws disappear. Whereas the warm breeze and sun-swept beaches of the original ""Today Is the Day"" concealed only the slightest hint of rain in a single, plaintive riff; the version contained here is a downpour of distorted guitar. Hissing drones and cymbal crashes sweep away any memory of the former's dulcet overtones. The only constant is Georgia Hubley's lovely vocal, which still carries the melancholy air of someone shut inside missing a sunny day; but where she once sounded disappointed in spite of her musical surroundings, she's re-cast here as the subtle, reserved heart amidst the thrashing guitar. Reinterpreting another artist's material is a feat to do well, but still fairly common; to so effectively seek out another angle to a song Yo La Tengo know every facet of as their own, though, while technically no more difficult, is made more impressive given their presumed familiarity with the source material. Enjoying the result of such acute self-awareness is decidedly more uncommon. ""Cherry Chapstick"" doesn't fare quite as well as ""Today Is the Day"" in its translation, but is equally revelatory, in its way, this time envisioned in step with the rest of And Then Nothing as a minimal acoustic number. By reining the tune in considerably, it becomes an even more natural fit with its old host, albeit at the loss of some needed diversity. In and of itself, it drags in its sparseness, but still bookends this EP near-perfectly. It should also be noted that there are also vital signs in Yo La Tengo's new material following Summer Sun. If the long-absent hum of ""Today Is the Day"" stirs recollection of an earlier YLT, back to I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One, or even Painful, then ""Styles of the Times"" and ""Outsmartener"" see those thoughts to their logical conclusion, bringing back the pop guitar dynamics of old without seeming complete throwbacks. ""Styles of the Times"" is particularly infectious, sounding as bouncy and aggressive as one of Wire's sawing Pink Flag assaults, with an equal measure of anthemic melody. This sort of passion has been sorely missed in some quarters, and shows that the band can still, despite worry to the contrary, tap into their old-fashioned ampbuzz seemingly at will, and without even looking over their shoulder. The ""covers"" (not to confuse them with the actual cover of folk singer Bert Jansch's ""Needle of Death"") on the Today Is the Day EP make explicit what should have been obvious: Yo La Tengo are still one of the most talented acts going, and whether they're maturing or simply cooling off these days, they're still evolving.","Certain boundaries are not meant to be crossed; not because of societal or political custom, but simply because space-time doesn ...

1958,Soul-Junk,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d89d034d5c69bf316f/1:1/w_160/1cb36dc4.jpg,2003-11-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7367-1958/,Sounds FamilyreSounds Are Active,"If the participants in American Christianity's relentless quest to entertain us were given qualitative rankings, Soul-Junk would be perched in the upper echelon, if not at the very top. That means they'd be ahead of the Bush Administration (with its oil-anointed, hymn-composing, boob-fearing Attorney General, its Security Adviser seeking counsel from a pompadour'd televangelist, and its Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence seeing Satan over Mogadishu), ahead of great management books such as Laurie Beth Jones' Jesus CEO (with chapters titled ""He Kept in Constant Contact with His Boss"", ""He Owned It"", and ""He Did Not Kick the Donkey""), and ahead of the film adaptations of the Left Behind books (still waiting for a porn studio to unveil From Behind, starring Kirk Rameron). Seriously, folks: American Christianity has lead to a lot of fascinating art. Consider the untrained scribble-painting of Howard Finster, James Hampton's garbage sculpture, or the judgmental fiction of Flannery O'Connor. Raving campus preachers always seemed more anthropologically interesting than the nervous Asians cycling past them or the stoned malingerers flicking bird-poop at them. Check out the documentary Chase the Devil: Religious Music of the Appalachians to be floored by wild, sincere Christian music and its accompanying spectacle (get ready for ""No Blacklung in Heaven"", for Vernon Oxford's heartbreaking ""Lord, I've Tried Everything But You"", for gospel that sounds like punk colliding with John Lee Hooker's Endless Boogie, and for the ""leper"" who talks to Jesus through a wobbling car antenna). This creative tradition could never have seen Soul-Junk coming. With some engineering help from friend Sufjan Stevens, and some sounds lent by a seven-guest roster that includes free-jazzers and vinyl-""users"", Galaxalag and Sloro have made an at-times unlistenable masterpiece. I crap you negative: 1958 contains hip-hop so out-there, so deconstructed, so avant-garde, so every-other-term-for-radically-pioneering that all geeks seeking that sacred ""next level"" will consider it a harbinger of rapture deserving Pitchfork's sacred 10.0. And yet, and yet: The huge step forward in experimentation results in too big a step back in grooves. The micromanaged haphazardness is impressive, even overwhelmingly so, but must every track pause, capsize, collapse, get pregnant, get spliced, and undergo sundry transubstantiations? I certainly wouldn't want this band to compromise their Ziplocalypse vibe by ""going club,"" but the few accessibly bumping tracks end up feeling like teasers of how Soul-Junk possesses the production chops to sway the multitudes. I mean, the awesome ""World's Loudest Ventriloquist"" samples ducks and elephants to go with its synthesizer squeals! Free-formity is their ethos: Like many of its neighbors, ""Nerve and Gall"" sees no need to make up its mind about how much to echo, or multi-track, or pitch-shift, or overlap, its vox. Like several of its brethren, ""Sabor"" suggests a digital Beefheart leading a Bible-camp Boredoms. ""Hogging All the Islands"" ends with a panic-attack simulation of manipulated gasps (no faxlung in heaven?). Your CD rack will wonder aloud if you are listening to Raymond Scott's audition to join the Bomb Squad. When I reviewed 1957, Junkheads came out of yon woods to tell me I got their discography scheme wrong (the albums start at 1950 and go forward while EPs and singles go backward to 1938-- how you like me now?) and to warn me that their concerts were preachier than their platters (ah, but the duo is known to wear cardboard costumes like an orphanage Halloween party). The sermonizing on 1958 shouldn't ruffle anybody's tolerance or leave any Puritan blisters, as it is subtle, interspersed with anarchic wordplay, or just ill (""let the son of God give the spit-blood-dirt Visine between cracked lids""). On the flowchart, Galaxalag remains the king of the funky stutter and the baked slur, while Sloro is hilarious and charming as a kind of confidently awful eunuch-Eminem. Computer-havoc beguilingly collides with Eastern/ancient elements throughout 1958, as if Soul-Junk is conjuring the logic of the scene in Jesus Christ Superstar during which the resurrected Judas wonders why Christ chose to visit when he did, since there was no mass communication then. And scholars are abuzz examining the functional similarities between hypertexts and ancient religious scrolls. Meanwhile, I hold out hope that Soul-Junk gets conscripted to soundtrack a Terminator 4: Terry Gilliam Debugs Pixar. Some jawas clearly shitwired this album's genius droids: its gargantuan beats summon a Messiah who looks more like an expanding Akira or the Stay-Puftzilla than he does the suicidal ninja cop from Braveheart.","If the participants in American Christianity's relentless quest to entertain us were given qualitative rankings, Soul-Junk would be perched ...

A Beautiful EP,Clem Snide,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f513d197565213909a/1:1/w_160/b428378f.jpg,2003-11-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1502-a-beautiful-ep/,spinART,"When a non-mainstream rock outfit chooses to cover a ubiquitous chart hit, the opportunity for mockery is often just plain overpowering: suddenly, all the latent indie elitism buried deep inside their collective bones bubbles up, springing each member directly into the throes of a hearty group snicker. Some bands manage to eschew the temptation-- The Flaming Lips' cover of Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" was wound down and slathered generously with organ, a re-arrangement that only emphasized the track's freaked-out, sighing hopelessness (and Wayne Coyne's willingness to acknowledge its dynamic). But while the Lips nobly avoided condescension in favor of ingenuity, their approach is far from standardized: the bit-lip, determinably ironic cover remains an alarmingly popular vehicle for loads of artless wanking. On the five-track A Beautiful EP, Brooklyn country-folkers Clem Snide dig their bloody claws into Christina Aguilera's empowerment-pushing ""Beautiful"", stripping down the original's histrionic instrumentation and replacing it with spare electric guitar riffing and a sped-up backbeat. But while their intentions may have been glowing, the results are still stupidly underwhelming. For Aguilera, ""Beautiful"" was primarily a platform for strutting her pipes, with a peripheral, stop-making-fun-of-my-outfits plea for magnanimous self-acceptance. Snide vocalist Eef Barzelay, who boasts, thankfully, neither Aguilera's sprawling vocal range nor her familiarity with the burn of the public's knife, spends the entire three minutes sounding like he's stifling a big, raucous giggle-- which might be okay if the song didn't continually reveal itself as awkwardly one-dimensional and (still!) unbearably maudlin. The album version of Soft Spot's lead single, the gushy ""Al Green"", hits next, and the difference in tone is palpable from the start. Barzelay proudly owns his grinning prose, and each lyric drips peaceably into place, as soft and lush as the story itself (""Summer will come/ With Al Green and sweetened iced tea/ Summer will come/ And be all green with the sweetness of thee""), languid guitar and chiming keys rolling into one lazy, languorous flow. ""Mike Kalinsky"", the only previously unreleased original included here, is more prototypically Snide, flaunting their now-patented blend of purposefully clever vocal-folk (see Mountain Goats) and careful alt-country strumming. The studio difference is noticeable (gone is the golden gloss of the Soft Spot sessions), and ""Mike Kalinsky"" sees Barzelay returning to his snarkier roots, sidestepping the super-sweet lamentations of Soft Spot in favor of rambling barbs (""He had difficulty breathing so he couldn't participate in sports/ And all the jocks said he was gay.../ Mike Kalinsky spent high school alone in his bedroom listening to Joy Division and The Misfits/ And going nowhere""). When it comes time for Mike Kalinsky himself to seize control of the story, the song tumbles from placid acoustic strums into 30 seconds of storming garage bangs, a funny-the-first-time explosion of noise designed to stubbornly define the narrative shift. The final two tracks on A Beautiful EP were recorded live on WFUV; the first, a striking cover of The Velvet Underground's ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", sits in wild contrast to the band's take on Aguilera-- the crinkled-nose sneer is gone, replaced by loads of sincere, held-breath reverence and persuasive conviction. Unlike ""Beautiful"", ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" earns aping: Clem Snide expertly stretch the song out to a bit over three minutes (skillfully harmonizing where Nico and Reed just doubled-up), threading in some melancholic cello lines and acoustic finger-flourishes, Barzelay's wobbly croak providing a warm alternative to Nico's brisk, disembodied warble. The disc closes out with ""Nick Drake Tape"", plucked from their sparse 1998 debut You Were a Diamond, and rendered faithfully on-air; the song is a perfectly breathy finish to an EP that's, ultimately, just as light.","When a non-mainstream rock outfit chooses to cover a ubiquitous chart hit, the opportunity for mockery is often just plain ...

Always Will Be EP,J-Live,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b2ea9e61561daa7046/1:1/w_160/65fa07c2.gif,2003-11-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4180-always-will-be-ep/,Fat Beats,"Precocious, hyper-intellectual emcee J-Live is perhaps best-known for the infamous label woes which kept his mythically bootlegged, classic debut, The Best Part, from hitting record store shelves years after its inception. Thankfully, the fiasco of music business politics didn't put J-Live off from recording, and subsequently, he came back fresher than ever with 2002's matured sophomore triumph, All of the Above. The album, which was largely an effective mix of J-Live's own cerebral word games, inspired flow, and candid introspection, not only served as a well-earned sign of endurance in the face of the hip-hop community and music industry at large, but also marked a colossal evolution in J-Live's own sound. In this light, J-Live's new EP, Always Will Be (a companion piece to his Always Has Been EP, featuring fresh material) comes as something of a disappointment. The album has a surprisingly lighthearted and indifferent quality to it; it serves as neither a substantial aesthetic devolution nor a marked progression either. While J-Live has always worn his old-school influences on his sleeve, never before have they eclipsed his artistic growth as much as they do here. Part of the reason for this is the fact that J-Live chose to self-produce all of the EP's eight tracks; and while J-Live makes for a wondrously impassioned and well-spoken emcee, his production skills rarely match his verbal cunning. DJ Spinna and Usef Dinero's esoteric, soulful instrumentals are resoundingly missing. Tracks like the Sugar-Hill Gang homage ""Add-a-Cipher"" and the tediously ironic ""Get Live"" bounce by on monotonously minimal drum programming, bland keyboard sounds, and lackluster horn samples. While this kind of stripped production does leave more room for J-Live's intricate wordplay and rousing delivery to reap the spotlight, it also unfortunately makes him sound inexpressively derivative; instead of innovating the past, J-Live now sounds trapped in it. This realization is particularly frustrating since many of the tracks off Always Will Be are conceptually inspired, and feature remarkable performances from J-Live on the mic. J-Live, who himself is an ex-schoolteacher, has always demonstrated an overt passion for language; his unrelenting flow weaves an intricate web of verbiage, spinning words into every possible rhythmic and thematic context before moving on to the next line. On the older-school ""Add-a-Cipher"", J-Live boasts, ""There is no simile that's similar enough to capture the imagery of my syllabic symmetry."" It's a mouthful, but one would never know it hearing J-Live deliver the line in such an unfussy manner. On the closing track ""Skip Proof"", which addresses that while he's a fixture in ""underground"" hip-hop he has yet to go gold, he muses, ""the only plaques I got is on top my bathroom sink in a bottle I use to fight plaque."" While on the concept-driven track, ""Car Trouble"", J-Live schools Wordsworth (of Lyricist Lounge infamy) on the pitfalls and perils of getting a record contract, using shopping for a new automobile as an extended metaphor for the whole ordeal; J-Live wittily queries, ""Are you a soloist or down with a band, 'cause six in a two-seater's not a good plan."" Still, despite showcasing J-Live's abundant talent, Always Will Be will likely just leave most fans hoping he'll turn back to outside producers. Towards the record's end, on the undulating track ""9000 Miles"", J-Live asserts his aesthetic manifesto: ""I can't spit that old rhetoric, I gotta spit ten steps ahead of it."" And he's right: his wordplay's hovering off into the future; but next time his instrumentals will need to catch up with him.","Precocious, hyper-intellectual emcee J-Live is perhaps best-known for the infamous label woes which kept his mythically bootlegged, classic debut, The ...

Compathia,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42c5e6ef959693207f1/1:1/w_160/d7625574.jpg,2003-11-17 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7200-compathia/,Holy Mountain,"When I was in high school, they forced us to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I thought the book was mostly a manual for baby-boomer self-importance, but one passage about how the author thought his friend was refusing to accept technology because it wasn't cool stuck with me. There is a whole culture of people out there who don't seem to exist on the same plane as the rest of us. I don't really believe these people are getting into holistic medicine and going back to the country because they think it's ""cool,"" but there is certainly something they're tapping into (consciously or not), in direct opposition to the information overloaded M.O. we're supposed to be all about. There are artists in music, like Six Organs of Admittance, Charalambides, and Richard Youngs, who reflect this mindstate. While they've hardly cracked the mainstream, they have all participated in some strange continuum of space-folk that goes back some 40 years-- probably not coincidentally when the 60s counterculture really got going. In particular, Ben Chasny's Six Organs project is the statement of someone in tune with the history of underground folk and psychedelic music, and only too willing to ignore the conventions of his own time to bring them further back into the collective experience, as he did so well on last year's Dark Noontide. And I guess that's my complaint with Six Organs' latest, Compathia: rather than expand on the strange, rustic eccentricity of Dark Noontide, Chasny has opted to emphasize his singer/songwriter tendencies. Not that Compathia is a pop record, but its roots are much nearer here to early Marc Bolan or even Donovan. The melodies don't necessarily guide a narrative as drift through loose arrangements (which usually consist only of multiple acoustic guitars), but there is significance in the notion that those melodies are the heart of this music. In many ways, Chasny is traveling down a similar path to Devendra Banhart, except that Banhart is able to make his songs sound as bizarre and unique as most other peoples' freakouts. The music of this record is hardly so out there, and that wouldn't be so much a criticism if Chasny's songs had a bit more meat to them. ""Only the Sun Knows"" encapsulates the sound of Compathia, illuminating the simplistic, elongated melodic phrasing Chasny prefers, as well as revealing the nearly omnipresent drone still very close to his music. It isn't likely his modest tune you'll remember, though-- it's Comets on Fire multi-instrumentalist Ethan Miller's searing, completely on-the-mark guitar solo. What I'd always hoped Six Organs would deliver was a kind of apocalyptic, epic-strength acid-folk, and when Miller blasts off and Chasny injects the odd layer of wheezing electronic mush, my hope is realized. Of course, it's a far cry from most of the low-key balladry of the rest of the album, and when the final verse appears, this fiery, chaotic vision suddenly seems distant. More typical for the album are songs like ""Close to the Sky"", ""Run!"" and the instrumental title track. These are short, sweet examples of folk informed by psychedelic music (and lifestyle), but still grounded enough to work in non-chemically enhanced states. The first tune in particular even approaches the almost-catchy acoustic pop of the Elephant 6 bands, if they'd been more in love with Donovan than The Beatles. The tambourine and handclaps (?!!) tighten up his arrangement, but for some reason, it seems strange to hear a Six Organs' song with something like a chorus. Chasny's vocals are much more out in front on Compathia, and but for a slight warble-- and a slighter detour into space-guitar at the end-- ""Close to the Sky"" could very much pass for straightforward folk-pop. Not everything is so cut and dry: ""Somewhere Between"" (perfect title) begins as a dark, calm-before-the-storm lament but gradually transforms into Eastern-tinged repeated mantra, featuring droned guitars and all manner of jingling percussion. It's a very cool sound, and one that I wish Six Organs would explore more in the future. Ultimately, Compathia is an accomplished, heartfelt record, if not necessarily the one to define Chasny's artistic voice. I get the feeling he's either taking it easy or making a transition to an altogether smoother plane; in either case, an appreciation for pastoral, lightly burnt acoustic pop is what you really need to enjoy his stuff.","When I was in high school, they forced us to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

Mechanical Royalty,Babbletron,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44013d1975652138c88/1:1/w_160/505937ad.gif,2003-11-16 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1092-mechanical-royalty/,Embedded,"The hardest thing about building a reputation in the turbulent world of underground rap is formulating an identity. Unless your crew has a fresh face, new sound or interesting persona, they'll sink instantly into the pop culture quagmire folks call independent obscurity. Such is the hurdle now facing Embedded's new Brooklyn protégés, Babbletron. Consisting of Jaymanila, Calm-Pete and producer DJ Pre, the Babbletron team take their no-frills boom-bap to various platitudes, from regrets about the nature of time (""The Clock Song"") to discontent with the artificial aspects of life (""SpecialFX"") to an idiosyncratic (yet unfortunately corny) trip into outer space (""Space Tech Banana Clip""). Issues arise with personal taste regarding the vocalists: Jaymanila comes off like a smoke-free LoDeck, while Calm-Pete has a relaxed droll that recalls a more serious, introspective, and possibly sedated Edan. While most of the album stands purely solid, ""Birds"" is the obvious triumph on Mechanical Royalty, and it may be one of the best songs of the year. An extended metaphor for promiscuous women, the boys play devil's advocate to her irresistible whoredom while Calm-Pete, rapping with a pleasantly slow, light cadence reminiscent of Slick Rick, warns, ""Beware of the succubus, out to belittle us/ She's a perfect stranger, don't be ridiculous!"" Over a xylophone and hard drum display, Jaymanila also hops into the fray, detailing how ""you want her to want you, but she's just a cheap trick"" and ""the roles that she play don't have hit points or Bilbo."" It isn't often that a song about such a common topic can end up so cleverly distinct. Unfortunately, the production here is largely inconsistent. The crew's producer and scratch handler DJ Pre has a traditional beat approach that often seems to lack any kind of pulse, with few change-ups or even interesting samples. Ese and Hipsta, saviors of LoDeck's fantastic debut EP Bash It!, also appear, but fail to bring quite enough talent to distract from the lackluster production. Luckily, Rjd2 comes by to drop lounge piano, swirling windy cavern choir and entangled guitar lines on ""The Clock Song"", while MF Doom swings his way through theme show horns and a speedy break on ""Space Tech Banana Clip"" for a massive payoff. Although they occasionally drop clever lines (""Sometimes I spit it so raw, the Japanese think I'm edible/ Oedipal, it ain't complex to see why you cry mommy""), Babbletron's song structures and lyrics come off as run-of-the-mill intelligent boom-bap, among the most vanilla offerings of the underground, regardless of their obviously noble intentions. The beats are weak, the record's too short, and the songs kind of blend together in a monotonous mash. While still a remotely interesting debut full-length, it leaves far too much to be desired.","The hardest thing about building a reputation in the turbulent world of underground rap is formulating an\n\ identity.

Parsley Sounds,Parsley Sound,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16bb1335d7bf1698258/1:1/w_160/9206c26f.jpg,2003-11-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6530-parsley-sounds/,Mo'Wax,"For all of indie rock's iconoclast ambition and pretension, the genre has been able, time and again, to inexplicably produce bands whose music has risen to monumentally epic heights. Throughout the 90s, benchmark indie groups like Pavement, Archers of Loaf, Sebadoh, and Guided by Voices all adopted an unapologetically lo-fi aesthetic in order to not only combat the monotony of the mainstream with inexorable layers of distortion and healthy doses of irony, but to also create an entirely new language of sonic possibility for music as a whole. However, while in 2003 many of indie's founding fathers are either off chasing classic rock fantasies, trading in their distortion pedals for Sun Ra records, or releasing greatest hits collections, an inevitable new breed seems hard at work. Take, for instance, the enigmatic new duo, Parsley Sound: Sounding like the vibrant lovechild of Badly Drawn Boy's melodic lo-fi folk, The Beta Band's beat-conscious noodling, and the Suppy Furry Animals' penchant for 60s psychedelia, Parsley Sounds is one of those rare records that manage to sound modest while frequently pushing the sonic envelope. This realization comes as quite a surprise, given that Danny Sargassa and Preston Mead, the brainchildren behind Parsley Sound, have only released a handful of EPs (one of which being under their alter-ego, Slum) prior to recording this glorious debut for James Lavelle's Mo'Wax label. From the melodic boho strum of the aptly titled opener, ""Ease Yourself and Glide"", to the pensive suave soul of ""Candlemice"", each song here seems to organically unfold layer by layer like budding pedals, revealing subtle sonic nuances. Rather than fracturing the landscape of each song with maniacal floods of distortion, Parsley Sound script a new sonic vocabulary by merging fundamental elements from disparate genres, and in turn construct new contexts for these sounds to flourish. For instance, on the Technicolor wonder of ""YoYo"", a meditative Rhodes piano motif gives way to a choppy insistent drum loop, only to be followed by crashes of rolling pastoral acoustic guitars, hushed vocal harmonies, irrepressible bursts of flute, and the blissful shimmer of it all interweaving together. While on the tripped-out melancholy of ""Twilight Mushrooms"", the group immerses the lyrics, ""Dream, that's all I do,"" within a dreamy accompaniment all its own; gloomy Wurlitzer chords rub shoulders with the breezy muted bop of brush drum sticks, syncopated guitar strums, and layers of tape-hiss. The most impressive aspect of Parsley Sounds, though, is the fact that despite the group's own diverse aspirations, the album never comes across as simply an exercise in studio trickery, two producers just trying to unify dissimilar elements for the sake of doing so. Parsley Sounds, rather, overflows with memorable melodies and inspired songcraft. The meditative psychedelia of ""Ocean House"", with its shimmering electric guitars, and wandering harpsichord lines, sounds like a brilliant 2003 remix of The Beatles' classic, ""For No One"", while the unrelenting catchiness of ""Ease Yourself and Glide"", which imparts a leading melody straight out of the Elliott Smith songbook, is a beautifully hushed forestal ode with clanging, playworn percussion-- just the kind of lushly orchestrated, lo-fi pop expedition with which this album is packed tight. Debut albums rarely come this fully realized, but with Parsley Sounds, this Watford-based duo have stumbled onto the kind of uniquely inspired sound that could influence tomorrow's indie rock as deeply as yesterday's has inspired them.","For all of indie rock's iconoclast ambition and pretension, the genre has been able, time and again, to inexplicably ...

Taking Northern Liberties,Three 4 Tens,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a792c0084474cd0c0c05/1:1/w_160/83f8277c.gif,2003-11-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8032-taking-northern-liberties/,Rainbow Quartz,"The last time music like this was truly fashionable, a secretive administration was conducting a foreign war in pursuit of unclear goals, the Palestinians and Israelis were at each others' throats, and Bob Barker was hosting The Price Is Right. Just a coincidence, I guess, but I couldn't help noticing just how resolutely the same these and many other things have remained over the decades as Communism collapsed, the cost of living exploded, and computers took over our lives. Mark the Three 4 Tens up as yet another thread to the past-- the Philly trio has been all over this Nuggets thing for seven years now, and damned if they don't bring 1969 right back to life in the comfort of your living room. They've got the requisite fuzztones and harmonized whoo-hoo-hoo's for the job, and they're newly signed to Rainbow Quartz, which is, like, the Lord-God-King of retro 60s revivalism in the post-Elephant 6 world. Their first full-length, 2001's rather ironically titled Change Is On Its Way, evoked the early years of experimentation and excess in rock better than a Wonder Years box set, and Taking Northern Liberties follows up with basically more of the same. Things skew a little darker this time around, though, as if the band's finally skid straight into drug paranoia. The gaggle of ladies on the cover fiddling with bottles and handfuls of prescription drugs is the first indication of this, though the sharpest example is definitely the crunching riffage and muffled screaming of ""Whore House and Suicide"", which juxtaposes extremely unintelligible lyrics about just that with spirited backing vocals and a bruising drum assault. ""I Believe"" is a weirdly buoyant acoustic song on which two members (I'm not sure which ones) swap verses-- one in a Nick Cave-ish monotone and the other in an amateurish yelp. ""I believe past the clouds/ There's a Heaven floating 'round"" becomes ""I believe past the stars/ It's all strip clubs and bars"" just a few seconds later, and sparsely timed wah pedal dribblings keep things feeling uneasy as the song stays afloat by clinging to a brightly melodic keyboard. Other songs don't dwell so much on the negative: opener ""Philly Blues"" is all thick harmonies and son-of-the-blues guitar hooks; ""Jack the Tripper"" is a bouncy tribute to altered states replete with harmonica and fuzz bass, and ""Ride in Style"" catches the glint of chrome on a passing muscle car in its circular guitar riff. But nothing quite tops the slow-burning psych of ""My Stoned Ass"" for sheer escapist thrill. It starts as a slow build of pick slides and cymbals, but finally grows impatient and, after about a minute, takes that elevator straight to the thirteenth floor, drums crashing, guitars digging in and maniacally chanted verses alternating with big, chunky choruses. The band slides into an old-fashioned freakout from there, a reverse build that pares back from guitar solos and violent drumming to heaving bass and creaking organs, decaying into something like a lost take of Pink Floyd's ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" before growling back for one last chorus. There's really only one head-scratcher here, and that's the closer (though it's listed on the sleeve as the penultimate track), ""Manned Space Flight"". It's not necessarily bad, just totally incongruous-- rather than plunking me down a few minutes after LBJ left office, this bleepy instrumental sounds like what'll probably be on the radio while I'm vertical parking my hover car outside the Social Security office in 2064. It's like K-Tel closing out a garage-rock comp with a St. Etienne song, and makes no sense in this context. But aside from the confusion that move causes, the Three 4 Tens have once again managed to play their limited hand for a good return simply by playing it so well. Taking Northern Liberties is an enjoyable trip to a different era that, all told, may not be quite as far away as we think it is.","The last time music like this was truly fashionable, a secretive administration was conducting a foreign war in pursuit of ...

The Black Album,JAY-Z,by: The Pitchfork Staff,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d8c0084474cd0c26da/1:1/w_160/556c8ce3.jpg,2003-11-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/,Roc-A-Fella,"01 Intro [w. Ryan Schreiber]
For Shawn Carter, the last seven years have been ridiculous. In 1996, he came up from an impoverished childhood in New York's Marcy projects to record a debut that would eventually come to be considered one of hip-hop's landmark albums, and spent the succeeding six years dominating Billboard charts, filling the East Coast void left by Biggie's death, and building a hip-hop empire to rival Puffy's Bad Boy Entertainment. In that time, he's seen as many failures as successes-- critics panned him for selling out after the critical reverence of Reasonable Doubt, La Roc Familia was a disaster from any angle, and, by Jay's standards, last year's The Blueprint 2 couldn't even claim to be a commercial success. Still, he's come out on top time and again: Today, he's reclaimed the title as hip-hop's reigning emcee, and his Rocafella record label, clothing line, and film company together are said to be valued at more than $4.4 billion. So why would he want out now, at the peak of his popularity? The Black Album, touted as his final release, offers some answers, though none as clear-cut as what may or may not be the truth: that it's all an elaborate publicity stunt. Or maybe it's not: Jay has cut an album every year for the past seven years; that he'd want a break of some sort now is understandable. Certain lyrics hint that this isn't the last record he'll cut, but if that's true, will his game still be as tight when gets around to the comeback? It's anyone's guess, and that mystery is part of what makes this album such an intriguing listen. The prospect of hip-hop's finest producers laying down tracks for the final LP from the rap world's brightest talent has made The Black Album one of the most anticipated rap records of the decade. What's stunning is that it delivers rap's greatest career-ender since Outkast's Stankonia. Even in falling short of Jay's classics, Reasonable Doubt and 2001's The Blueprint, it manages to eclipse 1999's brilliant Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter as his third-best album-- which in itself makes it one of the year's best. In light of the hype this record's received for its choice of beatmakers, we egomaniacally matched the personalities of our staff writers to Jay's producers. (However, we regret that we could not take the concept to its logical extreme and cease operations after publishing it.) 02 December 4th [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton]
In this game of stick-and-move with triumphantly spiraling Chi-Lites strings, Hova's mother Gloria narrates a dizzying tale of growth through adversity, unusual childhood circumstances, and the catalysts for our protagonist's career. The victorious overtone gives Carter the opportunity to apply his unwavering flow and powerful control of conceptual direction to his own personal experiences: When he details that he ""had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted"" and that ""this is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me,"" the emotional context of the lines quickly turns to dumbstruck awe. Regardless of the reasonably simple Blueprint-tempered backing and familiar topical terrain, ""December 4th"" stands not just as one of Jay's finest performances to date, but Blaze's, too. 03 What More Can I Say [p. The Buchannans; w. Hartley Goldstein]
""What More Can I Say"" is the sprawling pinnacle of every element that makes The Black Album an unrelentingly inspired future classic. Buchannans, one of two unknown producers featured here, supplies a triumphant instrumental that serves as a perfect counterpoint to Jay's trademark hubris and incendiary braggadocio. I mean, the track is introduced by a sample of dialogue from Gladiator: It doesn't get more epic than that, people! Merciless horn blasts, tender guitar licks, and turbulent string crescendos distract you when he identifies Martha Stewart as ""Jewish,"" but the one element that makes ""What More Can I Say"" a true marvel is that, despite it serving as Jay-Z's alleged last hurrah, it manages to sound more like a celebratory changing of the guard than a self-penned elegy by one of hip-hop's greatest emcees. 04 Encore [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum]
It's a little hard to take Jay's claims of retirement at face value when The Black Album's first three songs all claim to be his last and this one makes reference to ""when I come back like Jordan wearing the 45."" But the concept of ""Encore"" makes such nitpicking irrelevant-- a track like this leaves you waiting for the comeback. Kanye West whips up a soul revue backing band complete with melancholy trumpet line and miasma-happy backup singers (""Hooo-woahhh-WOAHHH-ohvveee"") for an imaginary mini-gig, while Jay contributes a very live-sounding performance. A posse chants for the hook while an emcee encourages crowd participation and the band idles between verses two and three. Sure, it sounds gimmicky on paper, but if anyone can pull it off it's ""rap's Grateful Dead""... whatever that's supposed to mean. Keep on truckin', Jay. 05 Change Clothes [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber]
The first single! And you know it's a hit already 'cause it's rocking the world's most reliable (and expensive) hip-hop production team. But no, and here's why not: The Neptunes, talented though they may be, have spread themselves a bit thin lately, coasting on Neptunes-by-numbers beats and Pharrell's by-now-goddamn-insidious falsetto. ""Change Clothes"" is, unfortunately, one of their worst productions since Busta's ""Pass the Courvoisier""-- the vapid, forgettable chorus and cheesy piano loop are the obvious product of an off day in the studio. Jay fares no better, like he almost knows it's subpar-- just spits out a couple recycled lines, and forgoes his visual style to make room for crap like, ""Young Hov in the house it's so necessary/ No bra with the blouse it's so necessary/ No panties and jeans that's so necessary."" If they could afford to cut the Dre-produced ""The Theater"", surely this-- one of two Neptunes productions on a 14-track album-- could have been scrapped, too. 06 Dirt Off Your Shoulder [p. Timbaland; w. William Bowers]
If you're old, you probably macked in a maroon Fiero ten years ago, listening to Timbaland ""get sticky"" with Jodeci. If you're young, you could still spot him behind the curtain of this anthem's anti-syncopation and arcade-shogun keyboard coils. Don't be fooled by the title; the song is not a cave-in to Charlotte Beers (the dandruff-shampoo ad-exec who was until recently Bush's Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs), but that doesn't stop it from being a commercial for itself and its brand. Recapping the story of how Jay clambered from shooting birds at God while holding his testicles to being synonymous with overexposure, the song lives and dies by Timbaland's battering-ram beat and laser-tag riff. ""Dirt"" is gregarious but exclusive: It's meant to shake balcony barstools, but it coyly congratulates only those who have been beaten down. The chorus is about shedding a stigma, about the actualization of a capitalist dream, about legitimacy, about arrival-- for a guy ending his career, Jay's tone is suspiciously akin to pre-game smack. Because I'm old, I hear the Joeski Love (""Pee Wee's Dance"") in Jay-Z's obtuse voice. Because I'm young, I acknowledge that he's larger than, er, life. 07 The Threat [p. 9th Wonder; w. Sam Chennault]
I can't decide what's stranger: that Little Brother producer 9th Wonder contributed a track on Jay-Z's final album, or that he's flipping a sample of R. Kelly. But it's 2003, and the entire underground/mainstream divide has been so flipped and conflated that it should come as no surprise. Nor should 9th's tendency to sound both hopelessly derivative and endlessly enjoyable; the track's rolling piano line and classic boom-bap breakbeat recall a smoother Primo, or a Pete Rock on autopilot. Given a title like ""The Threat"" and Jigga's infamous street credentials, you'd expect a fairly macabre affair, but remember: This is a post-therapy Jigga (who dates Beyoncé and listens to Coldplay), not the crack slinger Reasonable Doubt introduced us to in '96. As such, the tone of the track is more comical than maudlin, and Cedric the Entertainer's guest spot won't let you forget it. Here, Jigga puts Larry King on his ass and namedrops Christina Aguilera, Bill O'Reilly, George Bush, Halle Berry, Warren Buffet, Joe Pesci, Sammy Davis Jr., Jet Li, David Blaine, and Frank Sinatra, and, in the second verse, even tries (only half-successfully) to twist them into verbs a la GZA's ""Fame"". The song is a disappointment, unfortunately-- an easy concept lazily executed. There are a couple of decent lines (e.g. ""I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again""), but it's far from Jay's finest hour. 08 Moment of Clarity [p. Eminem; w. Ryan Schreiber, c/o Mullah Omar]
We asked Mullah Omar to write this part but he wanted all kinds of special treatment. Man, you should have seen his rider, it was totally nuts! It just proves Mullah makes the perfect Eminem: he's got his gimmick (""I WILL NOT BE EDITED!!!"") and he just keeps beating you with it over and over. But for his outrageous demands, he still hits it out of the park; the same can't be said for Em, whose shit is all just the same these days: You get your minor-chord, downtempo horror-esque piano sample (a white boy copping a white boy-- where's Shadow's kickback on that shit?), your loping/plodding canned beat, some ominous strings, and you're done. The only difference between this and his Blueprint track, ""Renagade"", is that his sound was slightly less tired two years ago. Jay, fortunately, delivers a determined verse about his father's death, and one for Beanie Sigel. But saying he wants to ""rhyme like Common Sense""? I cannot express my disappointment. 09 99 Problems [p. Rick Rubin; w. Brent DiCrescenzo]
Ain't-It-Cool rumor has it Hollywood plans for a live-action Transformers film. Feasibility of visual effects aside, the true question of the production is how to modernize Soundwave, the behemoth audio cassette ""ghetto blaster"" Transformer, for the MP3 generation. To the director, take a note from Rick Rubin's Jay-Z soundbomb: Keep it old school. Some studio suit surely wants a giant robot iPod smashing trucks, but the original concept still slays. Likewise, ""99 Problems"" towers over The Black Album's supposedly forward-looking tracks. Carrying the Decepticon analogy: The 808 kick quakes like Rumble's pistons. As the back of his toy box boasts, Frenzy's ""screaming voice and belligerent manner alone could shake up an opponent, but he can enhance this effect by spinning the drum-like devices in his torso."" So, too, does Rubin eject seismic, metallic blasts from his deck's chest like tornado-thrown telephone poles taking out a, um, transformer. After years of intimate, acoustic productions for Johnny Cash and Tom Petty and his sawing work with Slayer and System of a Down, ""99 Problems"" re-establishes Rubin as THE mutherfucker with a swami's beard who invented this minimalist trunk rumble. And unlike any other track on this record, it can be said that Jay's vocals matter little. Close inspection reveals dubious claims such as, ""Got beef with radio/ If I don't play their show/ They don't play my hits/ Well, I don't give a shit."" His lips rip like Lazerbeak, but the meaning is inconsequential. Do Jay's problems run deeper than Rocawear inseam durability or Bentley electrical recalls? His self-aware braggadocio goes back to those days of comedic Jamaican toasts, which potentially amuse if you're ever tempted to turn down the volume. 10 Public Service Announcement [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton]
Dictating to a labored ringing piano roll and a thunderously high-toned extended organ riff, Jay-Z once again decimates his peers in their own game, handling the school of violent hubris in a manner that embodies not just mere lyrical supremacy but actual metaphorical depth. Hova is one of few artists who can ask his listenership to follow his fashion sense while simultaneously schooling the talent pool on rhyming style in a single line: ""I got a hustler's spirit, nigga, period/ Check out my hat, yo, peep the way I wear it."" It's also a way of saying that the genre's old hat to him these days, even while it was his style that so ridiculously raised the bar. A bold statement among bold statements, this track is mastery of a style, regardless of brevity, repetition, or random use of quotations. 11 Justify My Thug [p. DJ Quik; w. Chris Dahlen]
The big story behind this track is that Madonna was supposed to give it live vocals but couldn't make the deadline. Instead, they went with Sharlotte Gibson, a longtime backup vocalist for Whitney Houston, who pulls off an adequate impression. The track is all about DJ Quik's electro beat, though, which starts out whomping and wears itself out through repetition. Sadly, not much else happens. It's easy to tag this as the simplest, weakest moment on the record-- I don't think anyone could reasonably contest that-- but on the other hand, it is nice 'n' nasty, and hilarious for how it makes Jay's thug life lyrics so unromantic and just-for-show. The lyrics moan on about gangsta code and social ills, but over that beat, he just sounds like he wants to get some ass on his face. 12 Lucifer [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum]
On first listen, ""Lucifer"" comes off a bit too close to flavor-of-the-month material for an album that promised to avoid easy singles: The accelerated Max Romeo sample could be construed as pandering to the Jamaican influences back in favor with hip-hop, and the refrain, ""I'm from the murder capitol where we murder for capital,"" is wordplay a little too beginner's-level for Hov. Fortunately, his verses make up for these slights by following an incredibly intricate structure, somehow managing to land on religious imagery every time the sample comes up, while Kanye's beat retains a snaky bounce without going down the obvious ragga route. If it does indeed end up a single, like ""Beware of the Boys"" it'll still be jagged enough to stand out in the trend-pile. 13 Allure [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber]
This is more like it. The Neptunes come back hard from their substandard earlier offering, riding a string section slick enough to rival Love Unlimited, a pulsing kick/snare combo, and gunshots for percussive effect and good measure. Jay is particularly on point, killing line after line like a Blueprint standout. It's the penultimate Jay-Z track ever, and buoyed on that stormy, oceanic orchestra, Hov comes damn close to teary-eyed: ""Shit, I know how this movie ends/ Still I play/ The starring role in Hovito's Way."" ""Allure"" is Jay in eternal struggle with his vices, confident as ever he can give up the game, but even the title forebodes. He knows, and when the Neptunes downshift and the chorus kicks in, reality strikes: ""But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back/ OHHH NOOOO!""

After spending most of the record summing up his life and career, Jay thankfully doesn't try to end it with the Cliff's Notes version. He instead handles his ""second major breakup"" by coupling his typically self-celebratory language with avuncular advice-- from himself and Biggie, who drops in from the afterlife-- and a rare display of humility. Throughout the sentimental closer, Jay keeps his chin up and makes the song cry with emotive, bolero-tinged production from the previously unknown team of Aqua and Joe ""3H"" Weinberger. Always the entrepreneur, Hova abdicates his throne and slips into his full-time CEO role with a series of almost memoir-like shoutouts that double as teasers for his upcoming bio, The Black Book-- in stores soon!","01 Intro

YosepH,Luke Vibert,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95313d197565213984b/1:1/w_160/35ed3c26.jpg,2003-11-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8463-yoseph/,Warp,"Luke Vibert is a man who warrants our sympathy. Whereas most geniuses only have to maintain one momentous reputation at a time, Vibert has gotten himself embroiled in the renown of Plug, Wagon Christ, Amen Andrews, and himself. When this guy dies, he's going to receive ten obituaries on the front page of the Times. On YosepH, his first album for Warp, Vibert is torn between the traditional and the modern, pure nostalgia and the removed eddying of experimentation. The album makes a conscious attempt to burrow into the glitzy, wondrous world of classic acid house and the infamously resonant and bouncy modulations of the Roland TB-303, a machine basically responsible for most of the house and electro of the last twenty years. This is, of course, not necessarily a positive attribute. The problems with reminiscences in techno have been distributed as copiously drawn 700-page schematic tomes elsewhere. For now, it will suffice to say that: 1) Acid house has not existed long enough for us to feel any nostalgia yet; and 2) Anyone who's ever heard anything from The Belleville 3 knows this is like being nostalgic for industrialized hyper-android flying-trains Futureland 2100. There are a lot of things to be nostalgic for; the future is not one of them. Navigating these predicaments, Vibert gets caught up in the 303 mentality: the record is named after acid tests, the track titles are ""Synthax"", ""Countdown"", and ""ILoveAcid"", and the record sounds like, well... it does not sound like the neighborhood church's youth organization. Much of the album seems to have been entirely composed of snorting, spitting, and dehydrating. ""ILoveAcid"", the album's pièce de résistance (for better or worse), accumulates patches of sirens and robo-bong hits to underscore a vocoder that, none too subtly, relates its analytically derived position on lysergic acid diethylamide (or maybe just music): ""I love acid and the way it makes me move... I love acid. I can feel it in my dreams."" ""Countdown"" is all brushing and salivating, hocking gobs of crystal meth out over fizzling mission launches and at least four full tracks of clapping. The countdown, pricelessly hilarious, goes from ""Ten. Nine. Eight."" to ""Zinc. Blacnh. Redweke. Six. Six. Easy."" For all Vibert's work on sedatives and therapeutic madcap acid flashbacks, YosepH also contains some of his most debauched and bewitching hip-hop since Wagon Christ's Tally Ho!-- gat-brandishing, ice-shoveling beats that are more imperturbably confident than MTV's Rich Girls and twice as dangerous. On ""Noktup"", the album's standout track, atmospheric clanging abruptly merges into a 24-hour hip-hop factory, a mechanical lever imprinting the heaviest beat of our times straight onto our foreheads. Two melodic synths are running the operation, and then they start falling behind, Lucy-in-a-Chocolate-Factory style, until the track submits to what sounds like a bunch of gun clips being loaded. All in all, the finest techno song to ever faithfully express the impetus behind Communism. Throughout, the sensation is of a flawless incorporation of Vibert's patented vertiginous melodies and crisp rhythms into the soul of acid house and early hip-hop. Still, it's not imperceptible. Your enjoyment of YosepH is fundamentally related to how much you can stand those two genres or Vibert's earlier work. There's not enough here to sway you one way or the other, nor enough endeavoring to want to make acid house palatable to someone senselessly resistant to it. However, there is one track (""Slowfast"") that suggests a reason as to why Vibert has found refuge in the past. Disconcerting at first, it becomes apparent that the part where the beat skips is the beat; the rhythm consists entirely of that rhythm being interrupted. It leaves one with the impression that, on the rest of the album, Vibert is so far ahead of the game that he's back to where he started.","Luke Vibert is a man who warrants our sympathy.

Spokes,Plaid,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a09d034d5c69bf2779/1:1/w_160/b95a1459.jpg,2003-11-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6337-spokes/,Warp,"If you were trying to explain IDM to someone who had heard neither the term nor the music categorized as such (i.e. 99% of the populace), you could do worse than to put on a Plaid record. With a history stretching back to the formative days of post-techno, including a contribution Warp Records' seminal Artificial Intelligence compilation (the duo was then working with Ken Downie as Black Dog Productions, but their track was released under the name I.A.O.), Plaid strikes me as the prototypical IDM act. Aphex Twin and Autechre, both of whom were also featured on AI, have developed too unpredictably; their records can go anywhere. Plaid, on the other hand, continue to refine and develop their early sound. But back to the hapless no-IDM-knowin' subject of our experiment: What would he call Plaid if we were to throw on a record? My guess is ""techno."" ""Techno"" is in its widespread usage among casual music fans is a catchall term for any danceable electronic music. Depeche Mode were called techno when I was in college, back before anyone had heard of Derrick May, and when Eminem dismissed Moby because ""nobody listens to techno"" only serious music heads questioned the accuracy of his label. That someone without an interest in electronic music subgenres (which, again, is almost everybody) might describe Plaid as such is ironic because, in fact, they are much closer to the ideal of sleek Detroit techno of the Belleville Three than most of their Warp roster brethren. Unlike Aphex or Ae, Plaid have never been particularly interested in texture in the micro sense; they're quite content to let their synths sound the way ""futuristic"" synths sounded in the late 80s and early 90s. Plaid has always been more about the rhythmic and arrangement possibilities of digital music, which puts them closer to where the music started. In the past Plaid sprinkled their sober post-techno with playful experiments and excursions into the rhythms and sonic signifiers of cultures not usually associated with their kind of music (Latin America, the Far East); with Spokes, Plaid offers their most focused vision yet. A consistent mood is carried through most of these ten tracks, and it can be characterized with words familiar to people who listen to a lot of IDM: reflective and mysterious, with an occasional tension verging on paranoia. Beats are everywhere, but they're never danceable nor do they seem to be the focus of any specific track. Instead, percussion here mostly serves the traditional function of marking time while the swirl of synths builds and develops. The interplay of the sounds on Spokes is occasionally striking. The rapid, overlapping sequences of ""Crumax Rins"" lock together to form a constantly shifting tapestry of sound, the sonic equivalent to a vibrating field of colors that transforms completely every time you blink. The acid arpeggios that mark the lead-in to ""Upona"" have a similar effect, introducing the world of the track as a place of speed and random twitches, where the vibrations just beneath the surface of awareness are disorienting. The opening bass throbs of ""Marry"" suggest a celestial scene-- some sort of deep space docking station, perhaps. But then the peppy (if malnourished) drums kick in, and the focus turns to the swirl of synths that lag behind the beat and coagulate into a bland but pretty melody that, unfortunately, doesn't seem a galaxy away from Mannheim Steamroller. Indeed, there are some dull moments on Spokes, but plucking tracks from the record and turning them around under the magnifying glass probably misses what Plaid intended (this one seems meant to be listened to in succession). For my money, the highlights on the album come during the tracks that depart from the album's script. ""Get What You Gave"" has pads that sound like an electronic steel drum carrying the melody, and that combined with the polyrhythmic stop/start beat evoke a light, airy Latin feel. And then ""B Born Droid"" is like a cyborg waltz, with a patient, shuffling gait and a minor key synth lead. These standouts are open and full of possibility amid tracks that seem content to work within narrowly defined parameters established years ago. Plaid do both very well, mind you, but I find myself wishing the ratios were reversed. ","If you were trying to explain IDM to someone who had heard neither the term nor the music categorized as ...

Chain Gang of Love,The Raveonettes,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21a9d034d5c69bf2afe/1:1/w_160/b946d34a.jpg,2003-11-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6698-chain-gang-of-love/,Columbia,"Last year, The Raveonettes came popping out of Copenhagen with an armload of press-ready gimmicks: a quirky boy/girl rapport, a preoccupation with 1950s, noir-heavy American kitsch, The Jesus & Mary Chain's discography memorized in full, and a 20-minute debut EP recorded exclusively in B-flat minor, without a single track eeking over three minutes long. It was late 2002, and (kudos, NME!) the public's interest in consuming a boundless barrage of backstory-hype had been waning for months; Whip It On! was a tiring proposition, both sonically and contextually, its thick, repetitive post-punk guitars and yawning, aimless vocals making its brief playtime feel like a whole shitload longer. Chain Gang of Love, The Raveonettes' shiny major label debut, is a far less off-putting introduction: they've kept up the pop posturing (check founding members Sherin Foo and Sune Rose Wagner bedecked in black leather and perched atop motorcycles on their retro film-poster cover, or the fact that this one is played exclusively in B-flat major), but all the peripheral jigging is, finally, apropos to something real-- trading in the dark J&MC; theatrics for bubblegum harmonies and pleasantly saccharine coos, Chain Gang of Love is blatantly inspired by coifed, mid-century American pop, with thick, Phil Spector-esque production and tightly controlled melodies, each mesmeric hook sufficiently roughed up but still intact. The Raveonettes' reigning aesthetic principle seems to be density, and the heavy, concentrated bulk of these songs can occasionally seem impenetrable, a characteristic that's only aggravated by their doubled-up vocals, ever-rushing feedback, and ringing, distorted guitars. Still, if your ears are freshly cleaned, it can also be a glorious buzz: now with Manjos Ramdas on guitar and Jakob Hoyer on drums, The Raveonettes' incessant B-flat majoring pits scratchy garage effects against sweet, copasetic songwriting, creating an internal tension that's curiously compelling. ""Noisy Summer"" opens with handclaps and impeccable harmonies; soon, distorted guitars crash in, throbbing until the very end, blanketing everything in an opaque layer of hum. ""Remember"" is Chain Gang's best, an atmospheric, billowy track with chiming guitar and frothy vocals, a breathless exhalation as full as it is weightless. The Raveonettes' rote reinterpretations inevitably grow a little tiresome (closer ""New York Was Great"" is imminently forgettable), especially after you've patiently swallowed ten or eleven fizzy versions of the exact same thing. But sweet/sour juxtaposition is their bag, and, lyrically, they've splattered these otherwise innocent songs with just enough disjointed teenage sex-drama to stretch interest for a few seconds longer than expected: the cloudy bedroom entendres and veiled invitations that haunted the bubblegum tracks of the 50s and 60s are suddenly transformed into explicit admissions and/or requests, like ""Little Animal""'s honest proclamation that ""My girl is a little animal/ She always wants to fuck/ I can't find a reason why/ I guess it's just my luck,"" or ""The Love Gang""'s astute observation: ""Chains, black leather, and sex/ Yeah, it's not that complex."" The kick is that their quips are still delivered with wide-eyed, Leave It to Beaver earnestness-- ""Dirty Eyes (Sex Don't Sell)"" sees Wagner and Foo whispering, ""Jimmy says that sex don't sell/ I think he's just..."" right before a blissfully sighed, overwhelmingly innocent ""oh well"" swells up. Blame The Raveonettes' questionable grasp of the English language, or their self-imposed key limits, but this is the kind of content/delivery, virgin/whore dichotomy that should make Britney Spears quake with envy. At thirty-three minutes long, Chain Gang of Love cuts off right before you start getting up to flip off the stereo, proving that The Raveonettes have finally learned how to bow out before their game gets unbearable. Ultimately, Chain Gang suffers from a lack of depth, but it's not so painfully hollow that listening isn't kinda fun.","Last year, The Raveonettes came popping out of Copenhagen with an armload of press-ready gimmicks: a quirky boy/girl rapport ...

Fabric 13,Michael Mayer,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43ceb335119a49ed8d3/1:1/w_160/beb75369.jpg,2003-11-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5551-fabric-13/,Fabric,"My wishlist of albums from artists who have yet to record full-lengths is as follows: Superpitcher, Junior Boys, Vitalic and, most of all, Michael Mayer. Whenever a new Mayer project is announced, it serves as a reminder of how few of his productions have been released. Yet whenever I hear these projects-- whether they be remixes, another release on his peerless tech-house label, Kompakt, or his ground-shifting mixes-- I'm reminded how thankful I am that he's at least out there doing what he does. The latest work from Mayer is his contribution to one of London club/label Fabric's mix series. Fabric's label division has been spoiling us recently with outstanding contributions from Swayzak (Fabric 11) and Jacques Lu Cont (Fabrclive.9), among others, but this is arguably the strongest release in its history. Incredibly, it also challenges 2000's Immer as the best release in Mayer's catalog, effortlessly drawing from his own Kompakt pool as well as eight other labels, including Playhouse, Plong, and Volt. Like most of Fabric's releases, Mayer's record is made with the dancefloor in mind so it's more ferocious than Immer, but like that dissection of the blissed-out end of German microhouse, it retains a Big Picture overview. In the past, Mayer's mixes have often seemed to be an attempt at taking a definitive snapshot of a particular sound from Neuhouse's mission statement, from the effortlessly blended, almost soothing and silken Immer to the schaffelfieber of Mayer's recent Peel Session (which is available only on mp3, not that we endorse that sort of thing, etc.) to the collection of Kompakt's more banging 12\xA5\xA5 sounds on Speciher. Instead, Fabric 13 is a more eclectic set, blending the differences between the seductive warmth and melody-- and increasingly pop and nu-glam-- sounds of Kompakt and adding underlying tones of menace and melancholy. Connecting the dots between elements of not only his own label but of German tech-house as a whole, Mayer offers a panoramic view of the scene. He even steps overground on a couple of occasions, utilizing both Jackson's Midnight Fuck remix of ""Run into Flowers"" by French nu-shoegazers and Pitchfork faves M83 and a remix of Westban's German hit ""Oldschool, Baby"". With vocals by Nena (of ""99 Luftballoons"" fame), who wields her retro charm as a weapon, ""Oldschool, Baby"" flits between quoting small elements of Italo-piano and acid house and 80s electro, drawing on the charms of the past without ever rooting itself in one place and time. ""We are the moment/ Here to last,"" Nena claims on a track that even outdoes the set's other great pop moments, the pair of mixes of Heiko Voss' contagious ""I Think About You"" that bookend the mix. (Voss' oftentimes partner Thomas Schaeben appears twice, including a collaboration with Geiger and Schad Privat called ""Really Real"", a swoon song whose superfluous title fits its overflowing sound.) Elsewhere, the always thrilling Superpitcher is represented by his Total 5 glam-shuffle track ""Mushroom"", and a newer Mayer favorite, Richard Davis, is tossed into the mix a couple of times-- most memorably on ""Bring Me Closer"", a nightmare filled with haunting skips and jumps, baroque strings that seem to move in multiple directions at once, and an uneasy central pulse. The central pulse on Fabric 13, Villalobos' ""Easy Lee"", is more of a solemn, battered lub. One of the highlights of his Alcachofa album, the Chilean ex-pat's woozy, weak vocodered voice sounds even more ominous and mournful among the near-gothic tones of Mayer's mix. Villalobos' work is a fitting foundation for this record, a mix of surging, sharp dance rhythms which never build to any of the kind of overpowering peaks that could keep home listeners and/or tech-house novices at arm's length. Every so often Mayer will get the odd criticism that he's simply an excellent ringleader and idea man, sort of the Dave Eggers of tech-house. Well, that line of talk is frankly wrong. He expertly scouts and attracts the talent, sequences the tracks, and sets the tone for the entire sound-- despite his own productions remaining sadly few and far between. Michael Mayer's two mixes and his Peel Session mark him as one of the year's most vital artists, a sort of weatherman who determines which way the wind blows in Berlin, Cologne, and any place where ears are cocked.","My wishlist of albums from artists who have yet to record full-lengths is as follows: Superpitcher, Junior\n\ Boys, Vitalic ...

In the Fishtank,Jaga JazzistMotorpsycho,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4445e6ef95969323a05/1:1/w_160/dfd932e3.jpg,2003-11-13 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5560-in-the-fishtank/,Konkurrent,"You could argue that with Konkurrent's In the Fishtank series, getting a great record is beside the point. The ten Fishtank albums released so far-- featuring bands like June of 44, Low + Dirty Three, Tortoise + The Ex, and Willard Grant Conspiracy + Telefunk-- all follow the same template: the label grabs bands that are touring through Holland, sticks them in a studio for a couple of days (most don't even rehearse) and persuades them to cut records that are more experimental, offbeat and, critically, more casual than they would ever make in their normal studio time. Although strict jazz and improv artists toss out live records and unrehearsed meet-ups as a matter of course-- Some Guys That Showed Up at the Velvet Lounge, Vol. 3 or what have you-- it's rarer for avant-rock, post-rock and jazz-informed bands to just scribble out an album and release it: LPs are events, and even EPs are policy statements. It's telling that even with bands as adventurous as Norway's Motorpsycho and Jaga Jazzist, it's hard to imagine any of their albums coming out as loose or random as this thrown-together EP. Jaga Jazzist-- represented here by their horn section-- is the jazz/fusion/techno nonet known for their densely pancaked instrumentals and gymnastic arrangements. Motorpsycho is a long-running psych-rock band, extremely popular in their home country, whose work jumps from classic rock jams and pastoral acoustics to hypercatchy psychedelia. (Their latest record, It's a Love Cult, serves as a great introduction.) The Jaga Jazzist horns have tagged along on a few Motorpsycho tours and done session work on their records, but In the Fishtank is their first real two-way collaboration. On the Mingus-referencing ""Doffen Ah Um"", a typically knotty Jazzist instrumental rubs against Motorpsycho's rock drums and grungy rhythm guitar; the soft psych-folk song ""Pills, Powders and Passion Play"" gets an extended instrumental break, highlighted by Mathias Eick's muted trumpet. These horn players are so identified by their tight ensemble work that it's a revelation to hear them play slow, almost drifting passages-- like when Jørgen Munkeby takes extended flute solos that evoke the dry desert sound of Julius Hemphill. And they come to the rescue when Motorpsycho ham their way through the Art Ensemble of Chicago's ""Theme de Yoyo"": while the singers go for a ""you had to be there"" delivery of the loopy lyrics, the horns' punchy funk salvages the song. But the clincher here is the last track, the twenty-minute ""Tristano"": building on a repeated motif that crackles with energy, the ensemble plinks and clatters up a mammoth arc, climbing with the nervous deliberateness of a rollercoaster until the theme comes in at minute thirteen and the band careens through the denouement. A free jazz structure tempered by pop urges, it does nothing more nor less than show off how well the bands spark off each other, in a setting that's more open than you may ever get from these guys again. And it's just the culmination of the ""anything goes"" aesthetic that makes this whole record so enjoyable-- that in a setting like this, the musicians can reveal themselves in ways that you never get from their normal work. It's one of the strongest records in the Fishtank series to date, and at times, it's damn near definitive.","You could argue that with Konkurrent's In the Fishtank series, getting a great record is beside the\n\ point ...

Muted,Alias,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17713d197565213863a/1:1/w_160/1d6fca15.jpg,2003-11-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/409-muted/,Anticon,"Listen up, kids; it's time for me to play like Mr. Rogers. The lesson today concerns the issue of paradox, 'cause this record unfolds like a case fresh out of Webster's: Despite its show of technical proficiency, Muted, the latest full-length outing from Anticon producer Alias, suffers for lack of sentiment or expressive accomplishment. The album's desolate, downbeat production provides the album with a sense of internal subversion, and also represents a pinnacle of craftsmanship, but the tracks are sterile and underdeveloped, suffocating and slumbering through a heavy-handed hour of dirty industrial drum rhythms and distorted glitchwork. Breaking almost completely from Alias' hip-hop backlog, Muted is largely instrumental, with the exception of one rhyme-laden track near the record's end, and the unfortunate ""Unseen Sights"", where The Notwist's Markus Acher lends his tender vocals in a potentially perfect fit-- one which at least had the barebones makings to parallel his own work in tone and vibrancy. Unfortunately, Acher's insouciant mastery of crestfallen sobriety is dredged from a metallic sea of mercurial and wandering breakbeats. Even his own lyrics, which clumsily allude to American media hiding the bigger picture and abstracting the truth, fail to make a positive impact, and instead freeze him as a caricature of anti-war/anti-consumer backlash. The track's structure and application are too sterile to play on Acher's emotive prowess, and the near-miss collaboration stings, feeling at best like a Notwist demo. Much of the album rides a rocky terrain of wandering breakbeats and ambient under/overtones, but a handful of well-realized moments thankfully save the record from infamy. ""Full Circle Blues"" is a windy, sensual breath on a metal playground full of robots. ""Am I Cool Now?"", a moment of self-conscious reflection, features the vocal snippet, ""Anticon ain't hip-hop yo/ They try to hard to be weird/ They're only popular on the Internet/ It's just stupid nerd rap,"" amidst a slaughtering barrage of drums and heavy beats. ""Chew the Fat"", the record's standout, then slides in with an echoing, searching, teeter-totter affair of lively electronic manipulations and release/relapse drumwork. Additionally, the closer (with the exception of the 15-minute break to hide the hidden track) carries the torch of capability with a nice use of space and a more focused compositional design. Of course, I'm not out to deprive anyone of their sole sanctuary, being that I might fall into the category of Internet-nerd-critic-- and, as Muted loudly proclaims, Alias is too well informed and knows the game too well to succumb to pressure-- but if he turned some of the knobs down just a bit, and turned up the heat, maybe I could hear a little better.","Listen up, kids; it's time for me to play like Mr. Rogers.

The Culling Is Coming,23 Skidoo,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86cb1335d7bf169929d/1:1/w_160/88e96fb4.jpg,2003-11-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8245-the-culling-is-coming/,Operation TwilightOperation Twilight,"Warning: This recording is deeply, willfully obtuse, enigmatic and difficult. May cause loss of patience in otherwise open-minded listeners. If you're already a fan of 23 Skidoo, you're probably wont to ignore that warning. You already know that, throughout their brief existence in the early 1980s, 23 Skidoo were an exceedingly inaccessible outfit, offering their clattering, mostly undanceable brand of noise-blighted funk in strictly linear doses. They rarely stuck with a groove for long, preferring instead to tease their audience with five-second bursts of straightforward rhythm and melody and shred expectations mere moments later. But even if you're intimately familiar with a record like their 1982 debut Seven Songs, you're not likely prepared for what's on this disc. Seven Songs has justifiably been hailed lately as something of a classic of the post-punk era, a concise, pointed attack on the senses that contains most of the band's easiest listening in tightly governed chunks of collapsing funk. Their final album (discounting a 2000 reunion LP), 1984's Urban Gamelan, largely eschewed the harmonic elements of Seven Songs for a more bare-bones, percussion-focused approach to the sound, accented by the occasional relapse to white noise or sputtering bass. It's a far more abstract final product, and a difficult listen for those seeking some sort of immediate payoff. As uncompromising and abrasive as Urban Gamelan is, though, The Culling Is Coming makes it look like a hippie drum circle by comparison. Originally released between their other two albums, The Culling was never meant to embody a statement of purpose by the band, but instead to merely document a pair of live experiments in industrial noise-making (this reissue appends a third) for posterity. This helps explain why it's just now reaching CD for the first time, but it also helps explain why it's the one 23 Skidoo recording nobody ever really talks about. The performances themselves are entirely freeform explorations of pure sound, with no real sense of build or release, which is really where the disc falters as a listening experience. The first performance, given the over-arching name ""A Winter Ritual"", was performed at Dartington Music College by brothers Johnny and Alex Turnbull, the band's two key members, using Gamelan, gongs, flute, and kendang drums, and it's the most straightforward section of the disc. The duo moves through a series of loose improvisations built on repetitive patterns performed on the Gamelan and Kendang, hanging snatches of nearly melodic flute just out of the listener's reach. Unfortunately, rather than use the intriguing textures they develop as building blocks for something bigger, only once do they actually choose to develop them, on ""G-3 Insemination"", wherein some sort of tambourine-like percussion instrument is used to lend a sense of urgency to certain passages, thus giving at least a sense of development. ""A Summer Rite"" is much darker, inhabiting the same headspace as dark ambient pioneers Current 93 and Nurse with Wound. The Turnbulls are joined by Fritz Catlin, and all three are credited with ""Metal Percussion"". Most of the sounds seems to be coming from tape manipulations, though, as crunching, buzzing, scraping and animalesque human utterances dominate the proceedings. The fact that this was recorded at the 1982 W.O.M.A.D. World Music Festival is almost funny-- I can't imagine what a W.O.M.A.D. audience must have thought of these guys, heads shaven clean, faces painted with camouflage patterns, assaulting them with a minimalist collage of inscrutable sound. ""Move Back - Bite Harder"", the bonus offering on this reissue, is perhaps the most interesting, featuring a series of heavily manipulated looping vocal samples and fleeting snatches of squealing and incidental noise, but as it drags on for 27 minutes, it's hard to stay focused on it. The Culling Is Coming is of primary interest for devoted noiseniks, people with huge amounts of shelf space devoted to Throbbing Gristle, Clock DVA, Nurse with Wound, and the like. As a fan of 23 Skidoo and an admitted dabbler in the world of dark ambient and noise, I can't recommend The Culling Is Coming to anyone else, really, though it is an interesting document of a challenging band at their most confrontational.","Warning: This recording is deeply, willfully obtuse, enigmatic and difficult.

Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds: A Shortcut to Teenage Fanclub,Teenage Fanclub,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74713d1975652139397/1:1/w_160/a86a6c12.gif,2003-11-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7956-four-thousand-seven-hundred-and-sixty-six-seconds-a-shortcut-to-teenage-fanclub/,Jetset,"There's a moment in the scalding raucous pop of ""Radio"" when Teenage Fanclub formally announce their modus operandi: ""Find a craze that fits and stay there for a while."" Unfortunately for the faceless masses never exposed to Teenage Fanclub's tantalizingly classic power-pop, the band never found a craze, particularly not one that fit anywhere. Like all verifiable Glasgow bands, Teenage Fanclub write seductive shrines to love and disenchantment, love and wanderlust, sometimes just love and more love. Needless to say, at some point soon after 1991's heralded masterpiece Bandwagonesque, the 90s had to make their choice: rock songs about Scottish sunsets or rock songs about antichrists and bad sarcasm. In retrospect, we made the wrong decision. In the modern age, the only time you'll hear of Teenage Fanclub is in a sentence explaining how back in the early 90s, this music was somehow eroded by Nevermind. That's just lazy musical genealogy. The roots of this band stretch deep into the soil of Britpop and indie rock as we now know it. Witness ""The Concept"", the first song on both Bandwagonesque and this new best-of. The wry, affably pretentious, pseudo-anti-satirironic first line alone (""She wears denim wherever she goes/ Says she's going to get some records by the Status Quo"") was as influential for 90s indie rock as any of the great songs of its time. There's just enough feedback here to keep you from getting slammed against a locker when playing it too loud outside gym class; the twinkling ""oh yeah"" chorus draws equally upon The Beatles and bands mocking The Beatles; and the drawling two-minute guitar solo enjoins the world to call it the Scottish ""November Rain"". On Bandwagonesque, the band's three strong songwriters (Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond McGinley) formed like a genteel, slightly nebbish Voltron and rocked more Big Star allusions than a Texas patriot. ""What You Do to Me"" would be indistinguishable from some of the songs on Radio City except Fanclub churns them out more melodically and cheerfully, and at a volume that would decapitate Alex Chilton. By 1993's Thirteen, the band would attempt nth-wave grunge and find that they were simply too brilliant to pull it off: ""Hang On"" opens like some rip-off of a Stone Temple Pilots hit before an uncomfortably inevitable slide into flakes of white noise and scaling strings. 1995's Grand Prix was slightly better, but even while the acoustic ballad ""Mellow Doubt"" featured lyrics as dumb and endearing as the best Big Star track, much of the record felt like weaker material from Bandwagonesque, with impotent songwriting and dismal performances. Their last two albums, Songs from Northern Britain and Howdy!, have been fairly hit-or-miss, and Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds does an admirable job of compiling the best of these: ""I Don't Want Control of You"" is a brass rendition of a theme to an imaginary 60s sitcom. ""Planets"" is a bizarrely dispiriting and hopeful space anthem with silly lyrics and orchestral crescendos. And, though this is a band clearly indebted to several major influences, there's always a song like ""My Uptight Life"", which idiosyncratically pairs what sounds like a phosphorescent theremin with backup harmonies that cynically say, ""Cynicism's a box I don't want to be in."" There are three new songs as well, all comparable in quality to the ""hits."" The band is softer here, more interested in song structure than feedback or atmosphere. The standout is ""The World'll Be OK"", a dance number that brings oscillating chords to drums, handclaps, and a dejected performance that belies the song's optimism. There are, of course, complaints that the compilers neglected ""Alcoholiday"" or ""Ret Liv Dead"", but with 21 tracks in 80 minutes, this is probably the first and last Teenage Fanclub record you're likely to need. More than 75% of the album consists of some of the best melodies the 90s ever produced-- melodies Blur, Oasis, and Radiohead would have orchestrated entire ""grunge revolutions"" in order to prevent you from hearing.","There's a moment in the scalding raucous pop of ""Radio"" when Teenage Fanclub formally announce their modus operandi: ""Find ...

Nervous Cop,Nervous Cop,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95f5e6ef9596932294b/1:1/w_160/fbb26fcd.jpg,2003-11-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5884-nervous-cop/,5RC,"Ah, group drumming! Having spent a large portion of my life residing in punk houses, I've taken part in plenty of these sweaty, multi-person freakouts. We tried our damnedest not to call them drum circles, but the logistics couldn't lie: five crusts with more than five sticks bang like crazy on one rickety kit. While barely any of these events were successful musically, the overall catharsis was always the more attainable (and certainly more noble) goal. Hammering out a wall of skittering percussion, Nervous Cop's assault by tom-tom conjures these late-night exercises in caffeinated stamina. On the debut release from the side project of Hella's Zach Hill and Deerhoof's Greg Saunier, Nervous Cop beat out a William Hooker impersonation for a little over a half hour then call it a day. The clashing/smashing smackdown pauses once or twice to allow a plucked or ringing harp jam from Joanna Newsom of The Please (who after two beautifully countrified self-released solo discs, has something coming out on Drag City sometime in 2004) and run-of-the-mill digital twiddling from electro-acoustic composer John Dieterich, also of Deerhoof. To place Nervous Cop somewhere within the context of the main players' history, the stuff is more interesting than Hella, less compelling than Deerhoof. I never cared much for Don Caballero or math rock in general, so Hella's post-Breadwinner intricacy doesn't move me. Deerhoof, though, have impressively notched a genre of their own. With this album, Hill and Saunier certainly rock an admirable barrage, eschewing lazy-boy fills for flat-out pounding, but it never gels enough to stand-up as anything other than a pleasant, albeit thin, excursion by two guys who don't usually play much music like this. All in all, the compositions, if not strong, are gleefully sporadic. Per the law of dynamics, the avalanche begins sedately with ""Setting the Bushes on Fire"", a 33-second clip of classical harp and incidental tones. Then comes 36 seconds of manic, rattling hardware percussion arbitrarily titled ""Rice Precipitation"". A similar sound gathers swells of electronics on ""Nonrum Nonproblem"" and ""Get Wolf Boy and Get in Context"". While continuing the patterns of the album as a whole, the newly beaten drums work a pulsation into the overall palate. The spare electronics-- little gurgles, a random computerized raindrop-- don't shift much either. Throughout, you get that sense that this was one long solo chopped into parts, layered later. The first long piece, ""III Pearls"", borrows the electronics of the prior bits, and the drums continue in same patterning, but an introduction of a distorted sound-wave musses things up a bit. Eventually the drums grow frantic and satisfyingly overlap. Another epic, ""Frank vs. Frank"", includes an airy harp solo: the mix shifts, the drums are distanced, a pretty disjunction arises, sounds operate singularly in a weird collective path. In time, of course, the insistent drums overtake the harp, an assault of cymbal crashes and rides. This ravenous rock 'n' roll give-and-take continues through the finale. Though I imagine a real-life anxious policeman sounding a bit more shrill, Nervous Cop do a good job locating a rhythm and sticking to it. Still, while the set offers a partially satisfying dose of chaos, in the realm of drum-based maniacs I'd rather take an unguided tour through grindcore, Harry Pussy, William Hooker and Art Blakey. Or the nearest Sam Ash, actually.","Ah, group drumming! Having spent a large portion of my life residing in punk houses, I've taken part in ...

Sheath,LFO,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc1c0084474cd0c2d84/1:1/w_160/920e5138.jpg,2003-11-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4955-sheath/,Warp,"It was bound to happen: in all the rush to run back to 1982 for beats and patches it seems what was passing for sharp dance music a couple of years ago suddenly seemed very far from the dancefloor. It turns out glitch wasn't the future of electronica after all, and being that few had expressed a desire for a greater abundance of convulsions at the club prior to 1995, I guess it's not surprising. What's surprising is the lay of the land in 2003; the rocket scientists and bedroom punks have gone their way-- Squarepusher, Aphex, \xB5-Ziq and 808 State now seem either hopelessly in their own worlds, or consciously at odds with what hipster electro-heads are pumping. Second-generation comers ranging from Boards of Canada to Lali Puna to Hrvatski exhibit varying degrees of familiarity with dance music that actually promotes happy movement, but if anything have evolved along a path born directly of their immediate predecessors rather than connecting the dots to some grand, electronic funk party. UK techno duo LFO began life as many of their contemporaries, labeled the future of dance; the fallacy being that back then, most electronic music with a beat was ""dance"" music, for lack of a better non-industrial umbrella. The funny thing was, LFO was the real thing. Gez Varley and Mark Bell's 1991 debut Frequencies is one of the truly seminal documents for IDM, not just because it united electro, house, hip-hop breakbeats, and Detroit and UK techno in a vaguely experimental bent, but because it was one of the few records everyone had access to. Pre-Internet, and before the dawn of filesharing, this was as important a factor as any for young ""intelligent"" dance music. So, here we are many years later, and wouldn't you know, those very qualities practically brand LFO as an oldies act. Of course, this is all relatively speaking (the only kind of speak that makes much sense anymore), but Bell's tunes on Sheath-- his first record as LFO in seven years, and first without Varley-- are close to quaint. This is not to say he sounds behind the times necessarily, but possibly that he's no longer proceeding at the same velocity as many of the people he must have inspired. Sheath is a friendly, playful record-- one that will likely return as much joy as you're willing to afford it in listening time-- but it's decidedly lonely, in the same way your parents are lonely after you've left home forever. Life and LFO go on, and doubtlessly still have adventures left to uncover, though the days of having to prove themselves are probably gone. Bell's most promising work sounds as if related to his tenure working with Björk. ""Blown"", ""Monkeylips"", ""Moistly"", ""Sleepy Chicken"" and ""Premacy"" not only sound as if they might have been backing tracks for Vespertine at some point, most of them sound better! ""Sleepy Chicken"" is especially wonderful, a model of slinky grace, despite its goofy title. Bell sprinkles an arrangement of repeating jazz bassline and blurry piano with mildly distorted static-pulse, giving the song an unearthly, pixie-dust ambience, then injects a strange, elastically prone pogo-synth loop about halfway in. If ever trip-hop had a future, it is this song. The first single from the album is ""Freak"", a very straightforward take on the bouncy electro LFO helped define at the outset of the 90s. Unless you're not listening to any other new electro, it probably won't sound terribly distinctive, though there's hardly anything inherently unpleasant about it. However, when the chorus promises that ""this is going to make you freak,"" perhaps something hotter than Inside Edition-assimilated bass hits should be going off. Fending a little better is ""Snot"" (another less than becoming title); yes, it's probably only going to sound fresh to the Fatboy Slim crowd, though it's hard to hate something so vibrantly spaz-joyous. The uptempo, big-beat motorik serves Bell's fiendishly simple, but very effective bassline well. Since LFO hardly need to be innovators to produce a good record, I don't have much problem recommending Sheath, with the caveat that when pleasant, easy-going atmospheres set in, sometimes amiable disinterest on listeners' parts follow shortly. Perhaps it's merely the fact that Bell's strength seems to reside in his softer sides that fools me into thinking his more extroverted outings are lacking. In any case, even after the wait, he's probably as close to a sure, comfortable thing as you'll find.","It was bound to happen: in all the rush to run back to 1982 for beats and\n\ patches it ...

Wig in a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80c5e6ef9596932110a/1:1/w_160/0885ba63.gif,2003-11-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2027-wig-in-a-box-songs-from-and-inspired-by-hedwig-and-the-angry-inch/,Off,"Later tonight, sixty or so people and whoever else I can sneak in will squeeze into the experimental wing of Cambridge's American Repertory Theatre to see the cult-rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch, the transatlantic, transgender spectacle that took off-Broadway by surprise in 1997 (and Hollywood, to a lesser degree, two years later). Our production of Hedwig has been in planning for a few months now, so when Off Records announced earlier this year that they were putting together a Hedwig tribute album featuring takes from The Breeders and Yo La Tengo, one producer's pipedream was to get these bands to perform in our show-- to be our Angry Inch-- and (this was my idea) to charge $1,000 a ticket, maybe even $2,000, and buy a couple Camaros. It never happened, of course; there are no Camaros, tickets are actually free, and the tribute, despite its initial hype, came out with surprisingly little fanfare. Entitled Wig in a Box, the entire project is pretty straightforward: a rag-tag team of indie rockers and b-rate musical celebrities take on the Hedwig songbook of John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask. Musically, the featured acts differ in approach to the original songs-- some, like Rufus Wainwright, remain fairly conservative; some, like Bob Mould, chance with bombastic trance; and most others hedge their bets somewhere in between the two extremes, such as having a woman sing what was originally a man's song as a subtle performatization of the title character's gender conflicts. That said, the best songs on Wig in a Box are the best songs from the musical itself; in the end most Hedwig anthems can't mask their true rock musical colors, and this compilation, for all its star power, comes off largely as cult novelty. After Rufus Wainwright's decountrification of ""The Origin of Love"", Sleater-Kinney recreate the quirky punk fervor of the original ""Angry Inch"", aided by the trademark nasal wail of B-52's co-vocalist Fred Schneider whose delivery renews lines like ""when I woke up from the operation I was bleeding down there"" with unspeakable creepiness. Frank Black adds teeth to the once tongue-in-cheek ""Sugar Daddy"", transforming it into a terrifying maniacal rant, while The Polyphonic Spree maintain the Bowie glamour of ""Wig in a Box"", but tastefully infuse it with flat-out awesome horn parts, harp and piano lines, and a barrage of E6-like sound effects. There seems for Wig in a Box contributors a great challenge of liberating the songs from the musical's shackles, and providing them some semblance of autonomy. Spoon, however, are the only group here to truly succeed at this, stripping ""Tear Me Down"" of its boisterous theatricality, butt-rock guitar and lyrical symbolism in lines like, ""I made it over the great divide."" What remains is much more reserved, the guitar strumming clean straight eighths over non-confrontational tom work, as Britt Daniel effortlessly delivers the song's now-orphaned lyrics. Wig in a Box has its share of lackluster offerings, too: both new songs-- Mitchell and Trask's ""Milford Lake"" and Robyn Hitchcock's ""City of Women""-- are largely forgettable. Jonathan Richman's ""Origin of Love Reprise"" degenerates into faux-ska by its end, and Cyndi Lauper and The Minus 5's take on ""Midnight Radio"" finds the wash-up drenched in 80s reverb, indulging unconvincing glam tropes and, perhaps most egregiously, swallowing the song's lyrics, which could have comprised the delicate original's most interesting element. ""Hedwig's Lament/Exquisite Corpse"", the much-discussed collaboration of a noticeably louder Yo La Tengo with Yoko Ono, is at first endearing, but ultimately chokes on its incongruity. And while the original ""Nailed"" wasn't the best of songs, Bob Mould just slaughters it here, replacing whatever life it had with mindless pre-programmed trance beats and hackneyed Oakenfold through-the-matrix zoomers. This compilation doesn't pretend to be a primer or introduction to Hedwig the musical; the very notion of a tribute album demands to some extent knowledge of that to which it pays tribute. That said, anything that keeps this compelling musical in the foreground of popular consciousness is worth something, and if a fan of Hedwig happens to be an indie rocker as well, this compilation is a delightful wedding.","Later tonight, sixty or so people and whoever else I can sneak in will squeeze into the experimental wing of ...

Burn Radio Airtest EP,Single Frame,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41a9d034d5c69bf2fab/1:1/w_160/13ecb065.gif,2003-11-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7181-burn-radio-airtest-ep/,Already Gone,"Eight songs and seventeen minutes deeper into Single Frame's vault, I've been spun full circle: I'm now disoriented, punchdrunk, and a little thirsty. Featuring five new tracks and three alternate takes of previously released songs, Single Frame's Burn Radio Airtest EP is the clipped and burnt follow-up to their prodigious full-length, Wetheads Come Running. That album offered as much in the way of promise as it did in tangible payoff, but exactly what direction their future work would take remained to be seen. With this EP, that future sound is beginning to take shape, and it seems to be leaning much more conspicuously towards East Coast dance-punk flavors, electro freakouts, and darkwave discord. The title track most closely follows the blueprint rolled out on Wetheads; warbled synth lines, choppy drum work, and Isaac Brock-like squawking, all bookended by found sound and reverb. It's one of several great tracks here, even if the tastes are a bit fleeting to feel substantive-- it's the same pleasure derived from all of their work to date, a sort of blustery slap and sinking afterglow of indulgence. ""Clipper Ship"", too, is easily recognizable as Single Frame material, only grimier and more linear. ""Dry Lips Usually Crack"" and ""Without Pens"", meanwhile, are pure unbridled energy carted in with electric distortion and an apocalyptic sense of immediacy, the latter song employing 30 seconds of digitized vocals before giving way to a few furiously intermittent rockouts. As for the remixes, none stand up to their originals in terms of temperament, but some trip into a newfound atmospheric success. ""Eavesdropper (Insomniatronic Mix)"" could easily be dubbed ""the Kid A version."" It pushes the evocative vocals to the back of the mix, distorting them almost unintelligibly, slows down the keys, and deploys a drum machine breakdown in the middle. It's more harrowing but decidedly less hedonic. The other two are mixes of ""New Car"" and ""Been to a Party at this House"", the latter altered very frivolously-- perhaps simply more electro-tinged and distorted-- and the former reduced to a drone-session utilizing the borrowed guitar lick from the original. The record concludes with ""100,000 Troops"", a two-minute smattering of feedback, vocal samples, and persistent drums, all the while evoking the ghost of societal displeasure. As is, the first half of the record takes an aggressive route, pushing the envelope the band sealed earlier this year, while its second half mostly wanders and kicks ponderously at stones in the road. To say where they're headed next is anyone's guess, but it seems to me this might have been more of an off-the-cuff sprouting than a sprinkling of planted seeds. Either way, I'm eager to see what happens next.","Eight songs and seventeen minutes deeper into Single Frame's vault, I've been spun full circle: I'm now ...

Keep on Truckin',Caustic Resin,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55cb1335d7bf1698ba0/1:1/w_160/833f422d.jpg,2003-11-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1360-keep-on-truckin/,Up,"These guys aren't fooling anyone, least of all themselves. That's why they've stuck together for more than ten years, I'm sure; because the crowd doesn't exactly part down the middle for this type of stuff anymore. At least, together and still ""truckin',"" this Boise trio can travel the country plugging in and rocking out, sharing joints, beers, and stories about playing with Built to Spill. On their own they'd be, well: they'd be J Mascis. So dig this crazy tripped out mindfuck: Caustic Resin find a way to strip the splinters away from Pink Floyd, Neil Young, and Dinosaur Jr and drive them into your ears with unabashed relentlessness and seeming disregard for cohesion, melody, or any discernible eye for restraint. Sometimes, as in the opening moments of ""Wizard of the Upper Snake River"", you get a little taste of the mid 90s in its anthemic tone and undulating dynamics (at best a loose echo of Modest Mouse at their most digressive and angst-led moments), but this is as current as it gets-- not to mention as palatable. The opening two tracks immediately go about harshing my mellow with abrasive guitar romps, open-ended song structures, and spacy freak-out psychedelia. Netson's vocals are of the Axl/Wayne Coyne hybrid variety, only sans any semblance of charm or melody. ""Fry Like Ace Jones"" chills out the mix a bit, but the band's patience quickly wanes, and over the next three tracks, we're subjected to nearly thirty minutes of impenetrable crunch and burn reverb, guitar solos, and feedback. The whole mess, laced with pleas to ""Keep freakin'/ Keep on freakin' out,"" amounts to a suffocating Wall of displaced apathetic aggression and slacker languishment. Some of the darker moments sound a bit like Tool on GHB-- dense, stomping, and maniacal, but with sloppy undertones of ambivalence constantly pulling the bottom out from underneath them. The entire affair, for as heavy handed and metallic it is, washes clean and leaves no mark. You'd think the enlistment of Phil Ek and a return to Go would stifle their recidivist crimes, but Caustic Resin are too unaffected and backward-looking to care. This is unapologetic, hazy-eyed, shirtless bar-rock at its most vulnerable, so don't come looking for a fight-- you'll just leave with stinging eyes, ringing ears and no memory of what brought you there in the first place. Which, given what went down inside, is a good thing.","These guys aren't fooling anyone, least of all themselves. That's why they've stuck together for more than ...

North Head,Lovely Midget,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc013d197565213b5ee/1:1/w_160/83e021a0.jpg,2003-11-11 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4954-north-head/,Family Vineyard,"Since 1995, New Zealander Rachel Shearer has created opaque, gurgling compositions under the well-chosen name Lovely Midget. Her music career began with two self-released CDs which soon caught the ear of Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, who promptly reissued her Sings the Lost Chord EP as a 10-inch on his Ecstatic Peace! label. Her first proper album followed in 2002 on Corpus Hermeticum. Prior to her largely solo project, she played in the Xpressway-sanctioned Angelhead (with Michael Morley of the legendary Wreck Small Speakers on Expensive Stereos, Dead C, Gate, et al.) and the all-girl rock quartet Queen Meanie Puss, who released singles on Flying Nun and Siltbreeze. Later, she worked on sound design for feature films and the cartoonish bluster of syndicated television, adding to her production arsenal. And now there's North Head, a dense sonic landscape brimming with interwoven, minute abstractions. A distillation of two years worth of recording, the gothic-tinged North Head resembles the incidental crumble of fellow New Zealander Peter Jefferies, especially the kitchen-sink aura of his Last Great Challenge in a Dull World or Michael Morley's noisy, protracted solo work with Gate. The influence of some non-New Zealanders is detectable as well: electronic music pioneer and composer Pauline Oliveros' notions of deep listening are also apparent in Shearer's sustained interweaving of keyboards, guitar, flute, vocals, and digital processing. Moments of North Head invoke a tenser, more saturated take on Primordial Lift, a field of long notes bolstered by Oliveros' accordion, electronics, and vocals; fattened with the electronic violin of Tony Conrad, the harmonium of David Grubbs, and a sea of cellos and low frequency oscillations. In this vein, the album's opening title track floats by in a deep freeze. Not as successful as some of the other pieces, it hinges awkwardly on the jarring sound of distant female voices. Not singing so much as vocalizing, these women were recorded in caves and their echoing shouts remain below the level of the music. A beautiful track in some respects, the too-pronounced humanity removes the aura of the more mysterious, organically anonymous works. Likewise, ""Dolphin"" ends the album abruptly, with the sound of voices sped and slowed, intermixed with string reverb, picking, scraping. Bolstering and assisting the title track, though, is any accompanying visual loop of falling snow and falling pedals. Shearer filmed these frenetic landscapes then re-sampled and looped them, exploiting generation loss and magnifying the grain of both the water, trees, and the medium itself. Throughout the album this swarm of multi-layered sonic information remains fairly continuous. The best tracks are positioned within a foreshortened field: layers appear homogenous but drip nuance. ""Swollen Dusk"" and ""Heavy Weather"" gloriously sound every bit their namesake. ""Squall"" is an undulating muffle, a submerged microphone enacting a nautical drift. Its fog and distant ghosts bring to mind Nurse with Wound's Salt Marie Celeste, but remain more interior, a frozen chunk of claustrophobia, the inside of an anchor. ""Fading"" locates a similar tension, but explores outwardly with guitars that fly off like violins whittling the air. These tones are supported by the vaguest impression of intermittent percussion. Here, I thought of a microphone charting the decomposition of dry ice or, quite differently, bugs caught alive in amber attempting a strenuous escape. On North Head, the occasional fragment dislodges itself from the pack and begs for your attention, but then it's gone. Unfortunately, the seven tracks are relatively brief. Ranging from three to seven and a half minutes, these environments warrant a lengthier stay; then the teeming landscapes could then last as long as they demand, clattering rivers pushing towards a distant location, endless.","Since 1995, New Zealander Rachel Shearer has created opaque, gurgling compositions under the well-chosen name Lovely Midget.

Singing Bones,The Handsome Family,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c051c0084474cd0c3189/1:1/w_160/e8dc9655.jpg,2003-11-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3729-singing-bones/,Carrot Top,"Many Americans historically moved West to seek wealth, prosperity, and adventure. More recently, people made the shift to the clean air, open space, and lack of humidity of Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California for improved health. But whatever the reasons that The Handsome Family, the avant-country husband/wife duo of Rennie and Brett Sparks, had for picking up stakes in Chicago and relocating to Albuquerque, it hasn't seemed to affect the dark humor or morbidity of their gothic Americana music. Like most of their work, Signing Bones, the band's sixth album, is another collection of tales of madness, thoughts of suicide, and acts of brutality and murder. Which isn't to say that Singing Bones doesn't sound as if it was informed by their change in geography. Like their best album to date, 1998's Through the Trees-- which was peppered by lyrical references to Chicago's stool bums, long, wide avenues, and Wisconsin weekend ""getaways""-- Signing Bones seems to echo the wide-open space and endless skies of the Southwest. In a way, then, this is the band's most beautiful record, an expertly arranged blend of their acoustic old school country augmented by pedal steel guitar and bowed saws and sometimes colored by elements of mariachi, gospel, and rural folk. Rather than the airy, light sounds of their recent In the Air and Twilight, the new record has a spacious, almost minimalist sound that seems to echo with the sound of the nominal ghosts. Departed friends and lovers, the weight of history, and personal demons all seem channeled by the Sparks. From the apparitions that haunt the aisles of the ""24-Hour Store"" to the stench of death in ""Far From the Road"" to the sense of resignation that accompanies loss in both ""The Bottomless Hole"" and ""Gail with the Golden Hair"", ruin and decay-- spiritual, mental, and physical-- are central themes of the record. Maybe it's the clean air, but the Sparks are in better voice than ever before, too. Brett's rich baritone-- which also shined while voicing feelings of claustrophobia, personal insignificance, and mental breakdown on Through The Trees and Milk and Scissors-- is better suited for these lush, spacious arrangements than it was for the band's most recent work or its roots-rock beginnings. Their harmonies, too, have improved dramatically, with Rennie now favoring a wavering falsetto rather than her typical affected, sometimes abrasive, and potentially off-putting growl. Morbid but still melodic, the sharp imagery and deft storytelling of Rennie's lyrics set her apart from most of the depressive, post-Plath acoustic pluckers and bores with which the band often is lumped in. And both her sense of fractured romanticism and tangible grasp of loss and consequence make her writing effortlessly better than the emotive types parading in the punk dives for whom pain and discomfort seems bandied about as fashion or a calling card. It's not, of course-- it's private and difficult to grasp, an unseen specter like the ghosts that haunt this record.","Many Americans historically moved West to seek wealth, prosperity, and adventure.

Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?,The Unicorns,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8fec0084474cd0c0f5e/1:1/w_160/8fef8bb1.jpg,2003-11-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8380-who-will-cut-our-hair-when-were-gone/,Alien8,"Pop music gets off way too easily; so long as groups stick to only the sweetest melodies, throw in a couple of ba-ba-buh's and sing about how Stacey's mom ""has got it goin' on,"" or some other such timeless verse, they're valued as somehow above the fray. It seems even the most venomous rock elitists can be defanged by a few simple hooks, turned endlessly forgiving by some easy harmonies. If Stalin himself had ruled with less of an iron fist and more Beach Boys-style harmonies, he might be remembered as much for his keen songwriting chops as for the wholesale slaughter of millions of his own people; such is the inexplicably titanic redemptive power of pop. That self-same blinding power is also why it takes a band as innovative as The Unicorns to throw the complacencies of pop into stark relief, to finally hold it accountable for such casual abuses. When it's so easy for bands to stay behind the indie-pop curve that you'd think someone's handing out ice cream back there, The Unicorns are ahead. In fact, they're so far ahead that superficial distinction becomes virtually unnecessary; they're striking at the most fundamental structure of the pop song itself. Without scrutiny, Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?, their debut album for the otherwise experimental Canadian label Alien8, can pass for the same sort of sugar-glazed jangle-pop that's been done to death, but has nevertheless been beloved for years in indie circles; all the elements I just derided are present in abundance, right down to a rare few instances of smarmy lyrics. The band traffics in the occasional oooh's and aaah's, and relies on retro-basic keyboards for the requisite flourish above and beyond the standard guitar fuzz. And yet, The Unicorns toe the line of bedroom intimacy and heart-swelling wonder as perfectly as any of the modern masters of the form. In that sense, they rival The Shins, or The Magnetic Fields, or any of the innumerable indie touchstones, but what truly sets Who Will Cut Our Hair apart is the near-total absence of traditional verse/chorus/verse framework in their songs; to nail beautiful, memorable lines with such remarkable ease is a feat unto itself, but to do so in essentially formless compositions is a different class of achievement entirely. Songs shift effortlessly from segment to segment, never relying upon the crutch of repetitive composition to create the illusion of a powerful hook. That's not to say that motifs aren't revisited throughout a song, but elementary concepts of A-B-A structure are abandoned in favor of brilliant, sprawling whole-song compositions. These days, when ""epic"" describes a line at the bank, it doesn't seem adequate to describe the scope of some of these tunes, but it'll have to suffice. ""Jellybones"" is a titanic wreck of styles and forms, offering glimpses of hooks that would serve other bands as whole songs like so many kittens; ""Tuff Ghost"" builds around two simple rhythmic shifts and never looks back, burning through a dozen variations of the song's central keyboard line. And the intricate plucking to open ""I Was Born (A Unicorn)"" gives way to a bizarre fiction: ""I was born a unicorn/ I missed the ark, but I could've sworn/ You'd wait for me,"" then, ""So how come all the other unicorns are dead?"" This hilariously morbid variation on a typical theme of loss or abandonment is par for the course on Who Will Cut Our Hair, exemplifying how The Unicorns continually and effortlessly sap the drama from rock's favorite, most maudlin topics, and transform them into simple, charming, light-hearted fun. It's a big part of what separates them from all those careerist indie rockers getting by on everyday hooks and affected disinterest; even at their goofiest, The Unicorns' level of comfort with their material-- and the obvious confidence that engenders-- makes it all seem totally natural and new.","Pop music gets off way too easily; so long as groups stick to only the sweetest melodies, throw in a ...

"8,000,000 Stories",Soul Position,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ddc0084474cd0c05a9/1:1/w_160/0c30cd87.gif,2003-11-10 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7369-8000000-stories/,Rhymesayers,"The way paths tend to merge and intertwine in the world of underground rap is fascinating. Individual artists, realizing their greatest assets, split for side projects with other seemingly disparate artists, and while the results obviously vary, it's surprising how often they find success. From The Weather (in which underground emcees Busdriver and Radioinactive paired up with sample-crazy IDM artist Daedelus), to Non-Prophets (introspective lyricist Sage Francis teamed with harder-edged producer Joe Beats), to this unlikely duo, which matches low-profile, self-producing lyricist Blueprint with official Ohio soul machine Rjd2, these bizarre side projects are quickly becoming some of the underground's best bets. Those unfamiliar with Blueprint's previous work with acts like Illogic and Aesop Rock may be taken aback by his ability to exude unusual confidence, charisma and emotionally powerful delivery in conjunction with his nasal voice and sharp, educated pronunciation. Essentially escaping comparison, his diverse subject matter spans topics like disdain for occupational hierarchy (""Fuckajob"") and the trials and tribulations of hot-headed female companions (""The Jerry Springer Episode""). One of his most gripping outings here appears in ""Run"". With a beat, chorus and concept recalling Book of Human Language-era Aceyalone, Blueprint glides around Rjd2's ethereal bobbing string-guided beat with an urgency that lends well to the topic at hand. Print examines the bleak state of mind inherent in the ghetto environment he grew up in, from gestation to age of majority: ""I learned how to walk at age 1/ And wasn't satisfied until I learned how to run/ At age 18, I didn't wanna run/ But I had to run from the shots fired by a gun."" His focus later changes to the escapist philosophies of his fellow project purveyors, finding that they're better off when not ""running from responsibilities."" Print's fresh take on the relatively common ghetto life theme is a powerful example of his wordplay capabilities. Rjd2 typically plays the background when laying down beats for emcees, trusting traditionalism over his obvious strength in experimentation, but here he makes several advances to match Blueprint's radicalism. From the trickle-down skank and blaxploitation recoil of ""Fuckajob"" to the ""clumsy ghost"" piano hammer smash of ""Look of Pain"" and the stuttered orchestral horror film crescendo, subtle piano, and gorgeous panning electric guitar of ""Survival"", RJ manages to dominate independent beatmaking. Even his simpler offerings (""Right Place, Wrong Time"", ""Printmatic"") are tastefully executed: they not only serve their purpose of enhancing lyrical focus, but also expose the more colorful tracks on the disc. Some missed opportunities remain: the beat on the three ""Candyland"" interludes is strong enough to rescue the track from its alphabetic retro dalliance, while ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" seems largely pointless with the same verse being dropped twice (and lacking resonance, development or purpose both times). Also, despite his preference for darker beats, Blueprint could easily have benefited from more upbeat production. Still, with these minor complaints pending, it's obvious that this amalgam between one of the most promising rappers in the underground and the most in-demand producer in the industry is a winning combination.","The way paths tend to merge and intertwine in the world of underground rap is fascinating.

Berlinette,Ellen Allien,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a179b1335d7bf169827c/1:1/w_160/aa2bf2ff.jpg,2003-11-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/411-berlinette/,Bpitch Control,"Lately I feel a little shaky. It rains too much and the coffee's too strong and the sirens are too loud, too often. People aren't as pretty as they used to seem, and on top of that they're gradually electing the entire cast of the movie Predator to significant governorships. Minnesota, California: I think I saw Carl Weathers in Central Park yesterday with a stack of leaflets. When late November rolls around and someone asks what I'm thankful for, I might just give up and say Ellen Allien's Berlinette, which has made the past six or seven months a lot nicer. That's the kind of love she inspires. Another Pitchforker came back from Berlin a few months ago, having seen her DJ at a party for her label, Bpitch Control, and said faux-hawked German boys had been lined up around the deck to bring her drinks. Thom Yorke's been going around talking about how great the label is, the cheat: yes, yet another cadre of ultra-fine German electronics. And earlier this year she released Berlinette, which is ""serious,"" and ""pop,"" and beautiful, and which I've had more success recommending to people than anything in years. It's a record that German techno enthusiasts and Björk fans can agree on; it tweaks and thumps and then pulls gorgeous ghostly pop out of it; it's big and solid and lovely. How so? The truth is that it's just enchanting, in a way that has to do with something much more than the sonic inventiveness and precision engineering that I'll have to settle for discussing here. It's rare for artists to manage what Allien does-- to take the tweaky cutting edges of techno and IDM and electro and draw from them pop music evocative enough to entrance even people who are usually turned off by electronics and ""repetitive beats."" It's even rarer for an artist to manage that with anything like Berlinette's sense of mood and personality, which mostly transcends the mechanics of the sound. But Allien manages all of this, in about eleven different ways. Just try one track: ""Trashscapes"". Her beats are like tiny hypercomplicated machines, with lots of pistons and articulated limbs; ""Trashscapes"" kicks in with a stiff, daunting one, one that pounds and then hangs in the air for a second before flipping over and starting again. Then come bursts of gnarled guitar, processed into a grim, extra-terrestrial chug-- the same way Allien's vocals are always processed into what feel like departure announcements from a spaceport on Mercury. At first we can't hear her: just micro-second clips and stutters popping over the mech-beat. Then she's singing and it feels heavy but it hasn't quite gelled into sense: ""Wo is where/ What is when/ Why we are here."" But when the guitars speed into an evil blur she comes out all steely-eyed with the record's mantra: ""The past is a lighttrain to unknown trashscapes."" That's what she does, on the face of it: She blurs the line between ""real"" sounds and ""fake"" ones, weaving processed patches of voice and guitar directly into the laptopped complexity of her rhythms; on ""Abstract Pictures"" it's the clang of a sequencer that rings out clear and natural. On ""Push"" she indulges in the half-crazy tweakery of some of her labelmates, toying with stompy synth blurts and calling, ""Push/ Push/ Kick your ass."" When she goes pop it's not by watering down the beats and crooning seductively or anything like that; it's just by gathering her steady tech throb up into gorgeous sweeps of melody. ""Sehnsucht"", one of the record's other standouts, has a compositional swell that's like the best days of Orbital, another act that always had the same ghostly, personal sheen Allien conjures: the beat here is her second-best machine (see ""Wish""), and the vocal is just another micro-processed blip, a half-syllable ""Ah."" It stutters in and takes its shape, and by the time the song draws up, roaring, there's no lyric that could be more right than the electronically pitched melody of those half-syllables. But all that's only technical. If it were just that, Berlinette would be an outstanding record, but not so outstanding as this. No, Berlinette has something extra-- the sort of mood and magic that makes you want to bring Allien as many drinks as she'll let you buy her. It's in the hyper-pretty, otherworldly electro-funk of ""Secret"", in the almost Cure-like cerebral throb of ""Open"", and even in the embarrassingly bald, maybe even naïve lyric of ""Wish"", which, like any good moment of vulnerability, makes you like Allien that much more. ""Need a planet without cars and wars/ I wish it could be true,"" she sings-- an almost strange thing to hear on a record full of alien machines. So that's the thrill: realizing all over again just how evocative and gorgeous the stiff clatter of technology can be. You sit calmly listening, drifting off to somewhere else, and then you notice that the little people dancing inside your head could almost be jacking their limbs off to certain points, or that the sounds of power tools are peeking out between the sounds of androids singing arias. Oh, maybe it's not that amazing: It's just a record, after all, and one of plenty of great ones released this year. But I've spent half the year with it, and it only gets better, and I can't wait to hear how it sounds in a few months, when the Predator itself announces a dark-horse independent bid for the presidency.","Lately I feel a little shaky.

The Music of Milton Babbitt,Milton Babbitt,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43fc0084474cd0c0452/1:1/w_160/242c71fd.jpg,2003-11-06 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1091-the-music-of-milton-babbitt/,Bridge,"Mathematics and music have a partnership that spans the life, well, either-- if you're counting all sound as music. However, the physics and natural mathematical relationships in music can apply to a lot more than just the time it takes for you to hear a tree crashing. In fact, music theory is largely based on math principals developed by old Greek guys like Pythagoras, who most of us probably only ever heard about in math or physics class. Yes, I expect intervallic relationships and the origin of a major scale are probably old hat and yesterday's cup of tea for all of the dinner table intellectuals out there, and I won't bore you with my hilarious retrograde and inversion anecdote-- but I will let you in on a little secret: there's more to music than ancient Greek postulates. Bam!! Since I know you're still getting over that and not really taking this part of the sentence in, I'll start the real idea here; chiefly, music, you see, takes advantage of many scenarios that math and physics can explain, but not necessarily create. That part requires a human element, and in our case, it's a very good thing (as anyone unfortunate enough to sit through one of those PBS specials about symphony writing robots can attest). That said, some folks like American composer Milton Babbitt have done some pretty amazing things with music using theories previously best suited for the biochemistry lab (as distinct from Rob Mitchum doing the same thing with music reviews). Grab some popcorn and prepare for his tale of mystery and intrigue! (And math.) Babbitt was born in Philadelphia in 1916, son of a mathematician. He'd originally gone to college to study math himself, but soon switched to composition. However, doubtlessly influenced by a very numerically informed upbringing, he soon discovered the marvelous world of Arnold Schoenberg's 12-tone music, a kind of beast that attempted to do away with the idea of traditional major and minor tonality and basically just get all out there with numbers, arrays and rows. The birth of the 12-tone system meant the birth of atonal music as a viable mode of performance-- anyone questioning the relevance of this stuff might need to chuck their Sonic Youth records out the window. Anyway, Babbitt was fascinated by it so much that he not only applied its logic to notes, but also to rhythms and duration. Truly, he so crazy. Babbitt is also quite the music nerd (in the best possible sense) via his contributions to electronic music. Possibly due to the fact that his stuff was becoming too damn hard to play by actual people, Babbitt was attracted to the possibilities of the synthesizer and programmed music very early on. His Philomel (1964) is one of the pioneering works for tape and voice, and should be of interest to anyone who thought what The Beatles were doing on ""Tomorrow Never Knows""-- or for that matter, what The Books are doing now-- was groundbreaking. The Music of Milton Babbitt doesn't really hit on the electronic stuff, but is a fine introduction for folks curious about his general modus operandi. The selections are all from his chamber music (i.e., small ensemble) repertoire, as well as one piece for organ. Of special interest to Babbitt fans is the inclusion of his recently completed ""Swan Song No. 1"", featuring flute, oboe, mandolin, guitar, violin and cello. This generally delicate (but hardly soothing) piece finds Babbitt's usual flair for angular ""melodic"" sequences and intimidating, complex rhythmic figures present. Still, newcomers with a penchant for following a zigzag path could probably spend a year chasing the jet trail left by just one of the instruments here. It's not chaos (Babbitt doubtlessly could give mad lectures on the structure of this thing)-- in fact, if you listen close enough, he has a curious tendency to repeat things; the violin mocks the flute, the cello hands the mandolin his part upside down. The important thing to remember about Babbitt (and many other atonal music composers) is that he isn't trying to scare you, but he might get a kick out of tricking you for a bit. ""Quatrains"" is a short episode for voice and two clarinets. Soprano Tony Arnold (it's a girl) is pretty famous for performances of modern classical works, and she's typically impressive here, singing what have been extremely challenging lines with impressive delicacy and accuracy. More than that, the piece itself is practically amicable, as Babbitt goes. Arnold sings of awaking from a dream as the clarinets scamper up, around and below her, perhaps imitating the butterflies she notices on her flowerpots. Allen Blustine's clarinet on the three-part ""My Ends Are My Beginnings"" exhibits just as much ease with flighty figures, but taken over the duration of the piece, more closely resemble the inner dialogue of a particularly stimulated intellectual rather than insects. Even though it might have been the result of a convoluted system of equations, I wonder if it isn't just as clear a picture of what's going on in old Babbitt's head. ""Soli e Duettini"" (1989) for two guitars proceeds with similar interplay as the clarinets on ""Quatrains"", but with a subtle flamenco aftertaste. Again, the performance is elegant, but the mood is hardly dainty. Babbitt's music often has a way of provoking conflicting emotions from listeners, and not just because it's atonal. His music never really comes out and tells you what to think, and because of its rather experimental origins, some people have a tough time making out anything but anything but a bunch of ""wrong"" notes. Still, Bridge has done a nice job of compiling pieces that are relatively easy on the ears, yet manage to reward anyone in need of a challenge-- especially with that cover art! Babbitt is one of our greatest living composers, so here's hoping his bandwagon gets a boost.","Mathematics and music have a partnership that spans the life, well, either-- if you're counting all sound as music ...

By the Roads and the Fields,Crescent,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e313d19756521392a7/1:1/w_160/64db446a.jpg,2003-11-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1730-by-the-roads-and-the-fields/,Fat Cat,"It's hard to talk about Crescent without engaging latent tendencies toward melodrama, nobly reaching for the appropriately epic metaphor, or fervently combing your memories for an applicable landscape: fiercely organic, Crescent's spare, throbbing soundscapes are hard to link up to anything other than large, natural formations. It's unsurprising, then, that Crescent, along with Movietone and Flying Saucer Attack, are the byproduct of Bristol's quasi-legendary space-rock scene. By the Roads and the Fields, the band's fourth record (and first since 1999's Collected Songs) is still lodged firmly in the goo of post-rock drone-- its hazy, sprawling tracks pour on an avalanche of slow, spectral structures that often recall onetime labelmates Third-Eye Foundation. Punctuating their percussive tracks with tiny, hidden melodies, Crescent seem far less concerned with capturing anyone's attention than slowly seeping into their audience's collective subconscious, and as a result, By the Roads plays more like a long-term installation than a transient collection of songs. Supposedly conjured with ""no budget,"" By the Roads and the Fields is a brilliant exercise in empty-pocket resourcefulness: recorded on eight-track tape, the album boasts the unpredictable stylings of a self-made double bass, a stack of metal bowls, clips of found sound, prepared piano, copycat tape delays, bowed wine glasses, and loads of atmospheric tape hiss. Ultimately, Crescent's shoestring studio setup is evident in both its feats and foils: although meticulously arranged, there's an element of scrappiness inherent to these songs, a kind of palpable fragility that suggests that everything here could fall apart if shaken too hard, dissembling onto the floor in a fit of clatters and pings. Piano bits and meandering saxophone melodies wander in and out of the forefront, snippets of Melodica and organ pop up unannounced, and sparse, careful percussion strings everything together-- just barely. Matt Jones' monotone, straight-faced chant/sing is hypnotic in its redundancy, but not especially engaging; even if you hug your eyes shut and mentally strip Jones' voice of its bloody red origins, it still doesn't add much to the wispy instrumentation, remaining too deliberately detached and lethargic to justify the distraction it inspires. Consequently, ""Mica"", the album's lone instrumental, is also its most compelling: a series of metal bowl-banging pings orchestrated (interrupted by the chirps of birds) and arranged, ""Mica"" is both weird and warm, a stark, metallic composition that's also surprisingly innovative. But even while By the Roads and the Fields is, at times, a compelling sonic experiment, it's one with no discernable resolution-- at just over 45 minutes, the record is short enough that it can easily be fully absorbed in one sitting, but it can also be unbearably tiring, too misleading and smoky to feel like a particularly honest or persuasive offering.","It's hard to talk about Crescent without engaging latent tendencies toward melodrama, nobly reaching for the appropriately epic metaphor ...

Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second,Wheat,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa0dc0084474cd0c1129/1:1/w_160/a1335b6d.jpg,2003-11-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8641-per-second-per-second-per-second-every-second/,Columbia,"A lot can change in four years. You could argue that these last four have seen quite a bit more change than most similar spans-- the years all start with a 2 now, television networks have just stopped trying and resorted to shoveling unscripted emotional manipulation in front of their viewers, and the entire American complex of invulnerability came down in a horrible hail of debris two Septembers ago, changing our collective view of the world for the foreseeable future. It was four years ago, in 1999, that we last heard from the guys in Wheat, and mercy, what the time hasn't done to them. Back when the 90s were drawing to a close, Wheat sounded pretty well at home plying a brand of melancholic, slightly lo-fi mope-rock. For all intents, they were an indie rock archetype for their era, filling in while Guided by Voices seemed to be aiming arenaward and Sebadoh were falling apart. But as much as they captured the era on their sophomore LP, Hope and Adams, most music has since moved on to brighter, more rhythmic pastures, and this apparently wasn't lost on Wheat. Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second is Wheat's third full-length and first for a major, and the difference is huge from the first note to the last. Wheat always had a whiff of the suburban anthem in them (see: ""Raised Ranch Revolution"" from Hope and Adams), but they take a whole-hearted leap into huge, airwave-friendly shoes here that you'd hardly even recognize them. Producer Dave Fridmann, who also worked with the band four years ago, might as well be Dave Eringa as far as the sound of the thing is concerned-- it's punchy, and packed full of big riffs, tight harmonies and sharp, close-mic'd drumming, half a world removed from his work with Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips and The Delgados. Thankfully, the band is up to the challenge of turning up the spotlights and the volume, and they crank out a solid batch of insanely catchy, pristine pop songs that'll crawl inside your brain and die there, only to come back and haunt you at the oddest times. ""Closer to Mercury"" is bursting with guitar riffs and harmonized leads, occupying a strange place between Thin Lizzy and U2. Principle vocalist Scott Levesque breaks out in a big way on this album, verging on (rock) operatic at times-- he even tiptoes around the ghost of Jeff Buckley on ""Life Still Applies""-- but always with his signature hint of grit and resignation holding it down to earth. Wheat don't waste any time announcing how much they've changed, kicking off with the choppy rhythms of ""I Met a Girl"" and Levesque's chorus of ""I met a girl I'd like to know better/ But I'm already with someone"" bypassing everything for the jugular. The song's bridge smooths out, almost getting lost under a wave of vocal processing, but the chorus roars back for a final go-round just in time. ""Breathe"" nods to George Harrison with its lead guitar part over a bubbling bassline and wordless backing vocals, one of several songs that ought to keep college DJs busy for a few weeks. Wheat have made a bold move here by stepping out entirely from behind whatever lo-fi shield remained on their last album and hurling themselves completely into no-holds-barred pop. Per Second has an immediacy that it once seemed unlikely we'd ever hear from this band, to the point where some of Wheat's old fans may not be willing to follow them down their new path. It's their loss, really. Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second is an expertly crafted great time.","A lot can change in four years.

Softcore Jukebox,Ladytron,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6feb335119a49ecc7c/1:1/w_160/d653a696.jpg,2003-11-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4634-softcore-jukebox/,Emperor Norton,"Psst, hey buddy, over here: wanna buy a playlist? I got all the shit you need right here, all the fresh tracks you need to know about to impress that record store chick with the Chan-hair and Loeb-glasses. I got all the finest mixes of all the latest genres: carport, kaleidocore, lapelgaze-- hell, if you want, I'll give you the entire contents of my iPod-knockoff on shuffle: that'll last you six days or so. What, you say a playlist isn't worth any money? You say who the hell am I that you would want to squander a hard-earned paycheck percentage on a mix disc of my making? Well, then, explain to me why you just cashed in a peach twenty on Ladytron's Softcore Jukebox! Sure, they may be big shots in the highly dubious world of ""electropop,"" what with their fancy blinking-light keyboards and Roxy Music tribute cover art. But in the era of the file-sharing speakeasy, when the distance between recommendation and listening is covered as fast as your DSL runs, pause-between-tracks compilations of this sort don't fulfill the role they used to. Okay, okay, Softcore Jukebox is such an excellent grab-bag I can cut it some slack. Turns out when Ladytron slice themselves open for some gross anatomy, their keyboard-spangle sound disassociates into equal parts critic's-pet rock, white-label 12's, and electrotrash. Slammed together, it's an hour-twenty set of danceability without the usual preconceptions about what's ""acceptable"" dance music. It's just a shame they couldn't have at least downloaded that crossfader plugin for Winamp. Starting out with the ambassadorial move of slotting My Bloody Valentine, Wire, and The Fall within the first five tracks, Ladytron quickly get to the core of why they're the one group under the electroclash banner that gets spun on indie-rock dance night. A new version of their own ""Blue Jeans"" that almost seems to accommodate a sample of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" (Sonic Youth's version, at least) and space allotted to an ancient song from dance-punk procrastinators !!! are yet more beat connections to the arms-crossed crowd. Though I'm not sure how many head-nod loyalists are willing to embrace a comp that connects the dots between Loveless and Fannypack, I salute Ladytron for the attempt. ""Hey Mami"" is the best of the tracks that reflect Ladytron's coy, flirtatious side, unabashed fun alongside ooo-dirty-me! crude-beat like Xtina's ""What's a Girl to Do"" or, um, Fat Truckers' ""Teenage Daughter"". More classical tropes of dance music are highlighted by the updated disco of Dondolo's ""Peng"" and MIDI diva-anthem ""You Got the Love"", while Snap Ant's ""Saviour Piece"" cuts and dices acoustic guitar like an audition to produce for Madonna. All these disparate elements are most emphatically wadded-up in Ladytron's sole completely-new contribution to the disc, a wonderfully twisted reworking of Tweet's ""Oops Oh My"" built on ""National Anthem"" fuzzbass and flanging keyboard assaults. No fronting on the original, but Ladytron's darker take drops a Roofie into the single's keg cup, morphing the tune from swept-away swoon into date-rape you can dance to (and feel appropriately filthy about afterwards). It's a cover with something to say, miles away from the usual indie-band-covering-radio-hit irony-jerkoff. A segue from ""Oops Oh My"" to the Big Brother & The Holding Company clone Shocking Blue to Beach Boys-ambient Pop Levi to echobox-cowboy Lee Hazlewood's ""Some Velvet Morning"" closes out Softcore Jukebox with a bang-- yet they're not really segues at all. And that's the frustrating thing: with the continued, mystifying dearth of DJ mixes incorporating rockist leanings (does nobody realize the appeal of 2 Many DJ's was less mashup gimmickry and more the excitement of hearing rock placed back into a dance context?), Ladytron comes a couple dozen easy beat-matched transitions away from filling a gaping hole. In missing this opportunity, they've created a fantastic dance-party playlist, but one that could just as easily have been posted on their website as a guide-map through the Soulseek wilderness.","Psst, hey buddy, over here: wanna buy a playlist?

Something's Gotta Give,Roosevelt Franklin,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07c13d19756521383cc/1:1/w_160/825de6d9.gif,2003-11-05 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6901-somethings-gotta-give/,Third Earth,"Named after the first black Muppet, it's obvious that the underground duo Roosevelt Franklin-- featuring ex-Company Flow DJ Mr. Len and Masterminds producer/emcee Kimani Rogers-- have a sense of humor. They also, in representing a disenchanted sect of the hip-hop underground, have a fresh message, fractured and unpolished though it may be. Vocalist Kimani is the most important variable in determining your reaction to the group's full-length debut, Something's Gotta Give. His style here is no-frills, mixing a steady, monotonous delivery with straightforward lyrics that-- at least until his content hits you-- give him the presence of any generic indie emcee. His tendency to opt for either idiosyncratic humor or emotional poignancy gives his flow an immediacy that lends itself to a more identifiable persona, and recalls more introspective artists like MURS and Slug. His topical breadth, meanwhile, runs the gamut from tales of the infamous friendship zone (""The Line""), to dealing with depression and sleeping issues (""Insomnia 411"" with Jean Grae and Slug), to the various problems inherent in society (""Troublearth""). Suffice to say: those expecting a verbal firestorm will want to turn elsewhere. But one attribute that separates Kimani's character from others is his obvious rock influences. ""Timmy"" lifts its chorus from Primus' ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""; ""A Meditation on Why Love Sucks"" opens with Kimani crooning lines from Leadbelly's ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"", and the skit ""I Am So Rich"" samples ""Art Star"" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Most overt are the consistent Nirvana references: Kimani speaks of ""nightmares with wrists slit, smashed through the windowpanes/ I woke up in cold sweats with visions of Kurt Cobain,"" gets robbed at an ATM by Kurt Loder over a loop of ""Scentless Apprentice"", and, most interestingly, happens to be a depressed Pisces, disillusioned with the most popular pillars of his genre. It's a parallel that adds an interesting dimension to otherwise uninspired music. Regardless of some issues with his less-than-spectacular flow, Kimani is still one to bring a burner when it comes to more trad-rap issues. ""New Jack City"" melds the production sensibilities of Little Johnny from the Hospitul with Kimani's pleasant drone for one of the most addictive tracks of the year. Sporting a jagged railroad blues smasher, he admonishes the new guard of underground hip-hop, claiming to be ""from a time when cats wore hats that fit/ And when beef would ever kettle, it gets settled with fists."" He also manages to hold a spotlight on artists: ""Dr. Seuss raps/ Cat in the Hat/ Where you just fill in the blanks and get a pat on the back/ Then a platinum plaque."" Unfortunately, there are some inconsistencies with the production. Although the liners say it comes courtesy of both members (mostly Mr. Len), Kimani's hit-and-miss traditional loop style is radically disparate with Mr. Len's ruggedly eccentric, electronic beat masonry. Some triumphs show through the lo-fi Buddy Slim-esque dreamscape of ""Troublearth"", the raw keyboard catwalk of ""The Line"" and the warped synth and distorted screams of ""Maybe"", but the majority of the album's production is either too convoluted (the dry piano sample and corny drum arrangement of ""Insomnia 411"") or unpleasantly arrhythmic (the jagged, awkward keyboard nodes and offbeat drums of ""Lately""). Despite their questionable production choices, uninspired topics, and spotty sound quality, Roosevelt Franklin's future remains bright.

Tasheyana Compost,The USA Is a Monster,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8fcb1335d7bf16993f2/1:1/w_160/c3d3d5cf.jpg,2003-11-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8378-tasheyana-compost/,Load,"From early 2000 on, Charlottesville, VA has played home to an almost unfathomably fertile art-rock and noise scene. At its epicenter is Pee Wee's Pudhouse. No more than a cramped house serving as a venue (but still by all accounts Charlottesville's Hacienda), the Pudhouse puts on donation-only shows, feeds performers home-cooked meals, and even allows bands who just happen to show up unexpectedly a place in that night's line-up-- the likes of which have included Quintron, Neon Hunk, and Lightning Bolt. USAISAMONSTER's Colin Matthews and Tom Hohmann, both former Bostonians, are among the most responsible for planting the demon seeds of Charlottesville's noise scene. The two were the first to rent out the space that would become the Pudhouse, and were the venue's biggest promoters and most frequent performers. Various lineups of the band (at one point numbering seven people) quickly cut four albums, the first one within weeks of the band merely existing. For whatever reason-- perhaps it was the incident when drunk beardclashers nearly set the venue ablaze-- USAISAMONSTER decided it was time to leave town, and soon relocated to Brooklyn, playing and recording their brand of jerky, often melodic noise-rock, and eventually landing on the radar of genre heavyweights Load Records. Which brings us to Tasheyana Compost. Now a duo, USAISAMONSTER's most recent effort is a varied ten-song collection that can at times recall the spasm and quirky melodicism of Deerhoof, the heavy-handed drumwork of Sightings, and the riffcentricity of Pink & Brown. The band is at its best when these elements interact effortlessly, affording songs a curious tinge of edgy, mournful Americana that ultimately defines the overall tone of the record. ""Reservation treaties no longer stand"" in opener and standout track ""Somehow"", a passionate battle cry on behalf of Native Americans whose ""home cannot be returned."" A reverent guitar line and snare drum roll accompany thoughts on the rift between modern and tribal culture and our respective interactions with nature: ""Run and get a wrench. Let's get the hell out of here."" Thoughts become fragmented alongside more spastic rhythmic figures in the second part of the song, bridged to the first and the third by a Deerhoofian duet of Casio keyboard and guitar. The band returns once more to unhinged jumpy narrative, concluding in quirk with, ""In light of native history the progress looks like cancer cells to me somehow,"" an unsettling finale if only because it's couched in such precocious melody. While not possessing the ambition of ""Somehow"", ""No More Forever"" is similarly jerky, the Casio keyboard reappearing as part of a guitar duet behind steadily intensifying drumwork, rapid-fire guitar octaves, and a close-harmony rendition of Nez Perce Chief Joseph's famous last words, ""I will fight no more forever."" ""Ruin"" blends noisy Sightings-like territory, discordant DC mathematica, and Tom Waits-ish vocal delivery. Album closer ""Crumble"" recalls Deerhoof once more musically and thematically, a compelling ballad on man's environmental disrespect: ""Painted symbol marks the hidden place overgrown pile of robotic waste."" The song ebbs in and out of rolling torrents of rabid strummed guitar, reverting back to its relatively clean folk-like setting for conscious lyrics that somehow never grate, and finishing itself in octave-jangling bravado. For all these unusually human moments in a genre not known for its sanguinity, USAISAMONSTER occasionally give too much precedent to riffage at the expense of any discernable or cohesive song structure. In these instances, what results is an unfocused, poorly considered parade of butt guitar; it's loud, but hardly interesting or much of anything else. ""Screaming Bloody Murder"" is perhaps the biggest offender, further weighed down by its downright awful free association word plays: ""Next hot glue gun karaoke duck bill platypus wack pretending alien sabertooth hippy punk ham hock soup."" ""Anal Lies"" takes second place, and ""Poison Snake"", which opens promisingly, degenerates into mindless riffage. It's rash, though, to count the penultimate track ""Love"" among USAISAMONSTER's failed musical experiments on Tasheyana Compost-- indeed, its last minute of discord fearlessly bubbling over soulless garage-rock and 80s hair-metal theatricality poses an enormous question: can the genre accommodate other musical traditions? Is this something it even wants? Noise-rock has proven it can be loud, but now what? Is song structure its next point of refinement? Tasheyana Compost hints at possible directions for the genre, and, while not fully realized itself, the album promises much in store.","From early 2000 on, Charlottesville, VA has played home to an almost unfathomably fertile art-rock and noise scene.

Birth of a Prince,RZA,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e5ea9e61561daa4b62/1:1/w_160/1d635ba7.jpg,2003-11-04 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6888-birth-of-a-prince/,Sanctuary,"No pop artist has been more consistently disappointing in the past few years than the RZA. Granted, as the evil genius behind some of the most inventive and unsettling hip-hop ever made, he's set the bar for rap producers to stratospheric heights-- it's a lot to live up to. But when he followed his early masterpieces with a long torrent of trifling, sluggish and insufferably narcissistic material, the fans started wondering: What the hell happened? The clearest explanation I've heard so far is that the RZA quite possibly went insane sometime around late '98, the year his superhero alter-ego Bobby Digital first appeared as the basis for a poorly conceptualized solo project. The decline since then has been painful to witness, like a careening school bus plummeting over a precipice with screaming children inside. When Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers appeared in '93, I was an instant, fanatical devotee. I felt like I'd found in the RZA a kindred spirit who shared my love of dark, angry beats, Kung-Fu films, 40s, and hos with equal zest and abandon. That I was a funny-looking white kid from the midwest made no difference. GZA's Liquid Swords, Raekwon's Only Built for Cuban Links, ODB's Return to the 36 Chambers; for a couple of years the RZA could do no wrong. But inevitably, he started slipping. Though still a strong release, Wu-Tang Forever had its share of question marks (""Black Shampoo""?), and The Swarm, a collection of songs featuring rappers mostly outside of the original Enter nucleus, was mostly a disaster with a few bright spots. That, of course, was five years ago now, and by my count, seven albums. And though there have been glimpses of his early genius and visionary lyrical style since (particularly songs like ""Lab Drunk"" and ""Brooklyn Babies"" on the otherwise dire Bobby Digital albums), they've always seemed like the last dying gasps of a wounded giant. As if teasing us with the possibility of a dramatic rebirth, Birth of a Prince opens with a quiet, soulful sample of a woman singing, ""It's a new dawn/ It's a new day/ It's a new life for me."" If only this were an appropriate precursor to the album and not just wishful thinking. Still mired in the tired blaxploitation-era pathos of his most previous work, RZA adopts any number of interchangeable personas on the album-- from gun-toting revolutionary thug, to erudite religious humanist, to champion satisfier of female loins-- and sorting them all out quickly becomes tedious. In direct contrast to these workalike personalities, the music is schizophrenically uneven. Isaac Hayes-laden soul and funk riffs collide with 80s hip-hop minimalism and 60s R&B; crooning to create a fragmented, disorienting landscape of sound. Add to that the RZA's dated off-tempo drums, deranged keyboards and slurred rhymes, and you come up just short of a muddled catastrophe. ""Fast Cars"" offers a taste of the mind-numbing narcissism and affected gangsta banality to which the RZA has succumbed. Over a dull, relentless beat, scattershot horns and what sounds like a squeaky toy piano, he warns, ""Gats burst off, thugs take their shirts off/ Five niggaz drop off before I got the verse off/ Pop go the glock, wipe the fucking smirk off."" As the chorus demonstrates, this is also the most inane homage ever recorded: ""We be ridin' fast cars/ Weed all in the glass jar/ Chrome on my crash bar."" Even Ghostface can't help, as he recycles the same tired lines about Clark Wallabies, ice jewelry and brand new jeans we've heard since day one. Ol' Dirty Bastard appears on ""We Pop"", yet another song about shooting glocks (the RZA's last solo album, Digital Bullit, featured an almost identical one called ""Glocko Pop""), but only sparingly on the chorus. It has the same bass-laden beats and floating electronic strings of a 50 Cent song, but with none of the playful wit on its sing-songy chorus, ""We pop/ We brawl/ Get money to the day we fall/ My glock/ My four/ Go shot through your bedroom door."" And it goes on like that. The 80s-infected ""Bob 'N I"" recalls the minimal old-school production of Audio Two and early Marley Marl, but serves mainly as a forum for the RZA's nifty rhyme couplings, like ""cannon"" and ""Michael Landon,"" or ""defrost 'em"" and ""proceed with caution/ You'll get your beans baked in Boston."" Which means nothing. ""A Day to God Is 1000 Years"" is the RZA's obligatory per-album summing up of his confusing hodgepodge of pseudo-religious philosophies and political views. Over a deep soul sample, he raps, ""Time couldn't end me/ Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me.../ I face my worldly challenge/ In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral/ My respect for all men is mutual."" Sometimes when I'm listening to the RZA's lyrics a line from Spinal Tap pops into my head: ""It's a thin line between clever and stupid."" I wonder whether he could actually explain in non-illusory terms what, exactly, he believes in. The RZA, with so much experience under his belt and insane expectations from his audience, carries the hulking burden of his past awkwardly. But if nothing else-- and maybe this is denial, but-- Birth of a Prince, while a career low, doesn't feel like the last word. RZA has yet to bounce back from his post-Wu slump, but I have the distinct feeling that, sooner or later, he will. I just hope that when that time comes, I haven't completely lost interest.","No pop artist has been more consistently disappointing in the past few years than the RZA. Granted, as the evil ...

Caught the Blast,Party of One,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16a5e6ef9596932019c/1:1/w_160/82d5259c.jpg,2003-11-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6529-caught-the-blast/,Fat Cat,"If lo-fi ever had any integrity as a creative approach, it sure as hell doesn't now, and here's why: it takes more money and effort to sound ""bad""-- in that specific, tightly regimented, Four-Track-Demos-on-a-Two-Dollar-Guitar way-- than it does to sound produced. With the advent of ProTools and its sundry cheaper alternatives, the PC has become the real weapon of the proletariat, resigning the Tascam to the kind of wanker nostalgia John Vanderslice spoofs in ""Me and My 424"". Now that cutting, pasting and tweaking material at the touch of a button has become the soundest and most cost-effective recording method, the current purveyors of lo-fi must practice stoicism that borders on narcissism. This, mind you, is a major breakthrough for me-- sort of like the time I realized that the average goth spends more time in front of the mirror than the average cheerleader-- and I've got Party of One to thank. They sound like absolute shit, which I'm sure they'd take as a compliment: every note produced by every instrument on Caught the Blast has been meticulously designed to suck. You know precisely what I'm talking about: dry, tinny, not-quite-tuned guitars, castrated bass, hissy cymbals, a snare drum that sounds like somebody left a half-eaten sandwich in it. Add a male vocalist who trades in sub-Malkmusian yelps an octave over his natural range, and his female associate who whispers as if embarrassed to be there, and we've got the perfect end result of everything bands like Sebadoh and the Swirlies have wrought, handily doubling as a parody. Caught the Blast opens with ""Snap You Like a Twig"", addressed to ""all you pricks in the present and all you pigs in the past."" Of course, it's not really ""addressed"" to anyone or anything-- singer/songwriter Eric Fifteen is far too clever to rely on actual subjects; his lyrics consist mostly of unrelated idioms culled from the white noise of the American media (although signed to a British label, the band hails from Minnesota), usually repeated ad nauseam. Since his verbiage betrays a number of nights spent in the company of Fox News and a joint, Party of One will inevitably mistaken for a ""political"" band; well, yeah, they do have a song called ""Baghdad Boogie"", an unpleasantly Ween-like number sung from the point of view of a caricatured fedayeen: ""Bring your boys home in a box/ You got an army that really sucks rocks."" Look: real dissent, real provocation, real satire would come in really handy right about now. This is none of those things; Saddam Hussein seems to occupy roughly the same cultural space in this ironist's brain as Scooby-Doo. Party of One also have a song called ""Six Million Anonymous Deceased"", the chorus of which goes (prepare yourselves): ""Six million anonymous deceased, six million anonymous deceased"" about 16 times in a row, and none of these times does the incantation mean shit to Eric Fifteen. Is he an intuitive Situationist? Nah, he clearly can't be bothered. It's an intellectual equivalent of lo-fi, and in 2003, it's just as dishonest. A pose of bemused ineptitude is a pose first and foremost, and Party of One are nothing if not poseurs. This band's entire raison d'etre is to demonstrate how suavely they go about the business of not giving a fuck. It would be the ultimate hubris to assume that we'll react with anything other than a yawn to match.","If lo-fi ever had any integrity as a creative approach, it sure as hell doesn't now, and here's ...

Electric Babyland/Lullabies,Rafael Toral,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e1b1335d7bf1699154/1:1/w_160/6d1c1587.gif,2003-11-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11850-electric-babylandlullabies/,Tomlab,"Ironico is Portuguese for ""ironic."" I could almost use it in a sentence to correlate my previous experiences with the music of Portuguese guitarist/composer Rafael Toral. I was able to use his second solo album of extreme/gentle Loveless-washes, 1995's Wave Field, to both fall asleep to (at a low volume) and wake up with (at a higher level). Seeing him twice in a live setting never failed to put me to sleep, though, and with his latest outing, Electric Babyland/Lullabies, it seems as if he's come to terms with the Sandman and decided to indulge in the creation of some legitimately sleep-inducing tunes. Toral's concentration on each of his records has always been on isolated sound objects and the process of making long-form pieces out of them. Albums like Wave Field-- or his last album for the prestigious experimental label Touch, Violence of Discovery and Calm of Acceptance-- focused on his Fender Jaguar for most of the coaxed sounds, while his Aeriola Frequency was composed from the non-sounds of two delay pedals with no inputs. The first five tracks of this new album are sourced from a little music box, comprising almost a half hour of clean rings and distorted metallic melodies either glitched up or left to make a slowly solidifying sustain of held tones. The first half of the record tinkers around without much success, not quite settling to sleep as much as turning restlessly, without a satisfying position of rest. The disc starts to wind up (or perhaps down) with the third piece, ""Rdm"", plunking the tongs in its most straightforward way. It twinkles like Sun Ra's ""Medicine for a Nightmare"" melody, the speeds tweaked in the middle as it both warps fast and then slows before finally reaching a shimmering stasis. ""Dne"", at nearly ten minutes, is more methodical in its gleaning of the music box melody. It starts off steadfastly, as Toral builds up an incessant plucking. The physical motion almost crackles as the underlying vibration slowly wakens into itself, soon blanketing the track with a very warm dreamscape that seems to embody the deepest stage of beatific sleep. ""My Head on Your Shoulders Feels Like Home"" opens the Lullabies section of the album, continuing the music box theme as its foundation. Here, the tinny melody becomes heavily distorted, but its gurgling only coos briefly at a minute or so, and it never has a chance to sink deeper. ""Little Stars"" recreates the instrument's soft twangs on guitar, approaching the lilt of a lullaby for an indifferent two minutes. The final track, though, ""Bodyjoya Mix Pt. 12: Dreaming into the Locked Groove"", takes the fuzzy notes of the guitar and rocks them into a low-level hum, and then keeps it on that almost imperceptible plane for a good 13 minutes of dreamy effervescence. It seems less ironic than intentional that the two sleepiest movements of the disc are what keep it interesting in the end.","Ironico is Portuguese for ""ironic.""

Human Amusement at Hourly Rates: The Best of Guided by Voices,Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc613d197565213b932/1:1/w_160/fa61b6df.jpg,2003-11-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3597-human-amusement-at-hourly-rates-the-best-of-guided-by-voices/,Matador,"Some time around my sophomore year of high school, I just gave up. Frustrated by the music I was hearing on the radio, and lacking the guidance of a knowledgeable older sibling or a hip college radio station, my interest in music gradually devolved into belligerent apathy. Turning what little hope I had left towards the Internet, I happened upon a group whose bandname interested me: Guided by Voices. In what, for me, seemed an incredibly defiant gesture at the time, I ordered Mag Earwhig! without having heard a note of it, and five-to-seven business days later, I had a new favorite band. A year later, my new favorite band put out a new album. Do the Collapse was host to a few great tracks, but the cheesier moments sprinkled liberally over Robert Pollard's songs proved tremendously disheartening. For the first time, I took to reading reviews of Guided by Voices' records, each one fortifying my belief that the quality of their output had been spiraling downward since the glory days of Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes. Over the course of Guided by Voices' next few albums, my excitement began to wane, and by the time Earthquake Glue was released this year, I had all but lost interest in Guided by Voices. Up until recently, I'd never have thought that a one of these collections could rekindle my interest in a long-neglected band-- it's just hard to shake the feeling that enjoying a best-of album is like beating a video game with all the cheat codes on. But listening to Human Amusements at Hourly Rates, it becomes immediately clear that Guided by Voices' vast and uneven catalog is perfectly suited for this treatment. Over the course of fifteen records, two (going on three) box sets, and countless singles and EPs, Robert Pollard has written more than enough brilliant songs to carry five of these things. But those great songs have always been broken up by weaker tracks on GBV full-lengths, putting a damper on the momentum that could be generated by an uninterrupted sequence of near-perfect rock tracks. On Human Amusements, this unadulterated flow of excellence is fully realized, and the results are absolutely glorious. Best-of records are frequently criticized for robbing songs of the context created by their respective albums, but Human Amusements succeeds largely for this very reason, collecting material from the most seemingly disparate eras of Guided by Voices' output, and reconstructing them into a surprisingly cohesive whole. The shallow and misleading ""lo-fi"" tag has led many to construct an impregnable descriptive barrier between ""early"" and ""late"" Guided by Voices, but Human Amusements is an alarmingly seamless listen. Indeed, the way the album is sequenced often serves to draw attention away from discrepancies in production, and towards the uniformly excellent quality of Pollard's songwriting. Many of the songs on Human Amusements actually come across much better here than they did on their respective albums. The synth-whispers of ""Things I Will Keep"", which seemed so insincere and cheesy on Do the Collapse, now appear utterly insignificant when compared to the song's gorgeous melody and subtle rhythmic variations. The languid melancholy of ""To Remake the Young Flyer"", which got slightly lost in the submerged early sections of Under the Bushes Under the Stars, is twice as affecting immediately following the crisp, upbeat pop of ""Game of Pricks"". The few selections chosen from Pollard's pre-Propeller era are top notch, and much easier to stomach outside of the generally mediocre albums from which they were drawn. As with any best-of album from a band with such a vast output, the final tracklist is bound to be the subject of debate. Personally, I don't see how ""Smothered in Hugs"", what I would consider to be the best song on Bee Thousand and a perennial fan favorite, could have been omitted from an otherwise well-considered tracklist. I was also disappointed to see that ""Weed King"" from Propeller and ""Don't Stop Now"" and ""Drag Days"" from Under the Bushes were left out. Ultimately, though, it's hard to register much of any disappointment with the tracks that Pollard did choose. Rather than simply picking his favorite tracks, Pollard seems to have put a lot of thought into selecting a sequence of songs that holds together incredibly well as an album. Aside from an album cover that looks like a 12-year-old's first Photoshop project, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Human Amusements at Hourly Rates. Best-of albums are generally disjointed and disappointing, especially if you're already familiar with the band's output, and Robert Pollard hasn't exactly shown himself to be the most adept person at judging his own work. But the momentum and contrast worked into Human Amusements is so staggering that it far exceeds any Guided by Voices mix CD I've ever put together or heard. Listening to this album now, I can feel echoes of the same giddy excitement that I haven't been able to fully recapture since I listened to Mag Earwhig! for the very first time. I may have heard them all a hundred times before, but these are my 32 new favorite songs.","Some time around my sophomore year of high school, I just gave up.

Leave Luck to Heaven,Matthew Dear,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb57c0084474cd0c2828/1:1/w_160/b4f8c154.jpg,2003-11-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2526-leave-luck-to-heaven/,Spectral SoundGhostly,"Matthew Dear has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year. In 2003 alone, he's released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International label), recorded for Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 imprint (as False) and Markus Nikolai's Berlin-based Perlon label (as Jabberjaw), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, Leave Luck to Heaven. It's no wonder that Dear allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop, to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres. So, yeah, more eclecticism, then? Not really, Leave Luck to Heaven is more like alchemy. Instead of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- Dear boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements of his own more catagorizable work. The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with Ricardo Villalobos' Alcachofa) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between home listening and the dancefloor. Comparisons to Hawtin and Villalobos arguably flatter to deceive at this point in Dear's career, but they're far from unfounded. In a sense, Dear is creating sounds that blend the same elements that Hawtin used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD Decks, EFX & 909. And, like the Chilean Villalobos, Dear takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear. As a result, Leave Luck to Heaven is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners. Its ebb and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when Dear stays closer to Detroit techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"". Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie washes of synths color Dear's deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""You're Fucking Crazy"", each of which twitch and hum with hollowed-out nervous energy. The vocal tracks, sung in gentle falsetto, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling basslines of Detroit's second-wave techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now"" and ""Dog Days"". The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't we work it out?""). ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping sing-song of synthetic horns, Dear's cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell another story,"" Dear repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing minutes. It could have gone on for another six. In a year in which Dear has written his share of stories, ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter.","Matthew Dear has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year.

Recorded in New York and mixed in Michigan, this record is no exception. Here, the two bands' frequency cruelties overlap-- all five tracks are untitled, and even the bandnames on the sleeve are obscured by the invigorating tagline: ""The Lord Helps You."" The two groups forgo percussion through almost the entire first half of the album, instead setting their sights to stringing up sine waves and static electricity gurgles. The cumulative effect of such moves slowly conjures up a sinister stasis merging with the lost echoes of the other tetchy elements as they sink below in the soupy mix, giving the early goings a murky undertow that threatens to keep the proceedings too still. On the choppy surface of the waves, a tugboat churns through the fog, but little is discernible beyond obfuscated shapes, and I keep waiting for the monsters to finally show themselves amongst all the primitive test signals and squeals. By track number three, the wintry winds of Aaron Dilloway and John Olson blow the doors wide open, letting in Hisham Bharoocha's corpse-thudding kickdrum and Eric Copeland's high shrieks. The beastly beat flings guts at the walls and the homemade circuits scream bloody murder before the track's throat gets slashed altogether, guaranteeing inclusion on your next haunted house mix. The remainder of the side is a slow slur of star hums and open-mouthed ghosts being twisted into tiny knots. Side B is given over to what could pass as a long-lost purgatorial landscape left off last year's Beaches & Canyons or a John Carpenter score for a Tylenol Cluster Headache Gelcaps commercial. A CD skips along in the underworld, slowly intertwining Wolf Eyes' menacing ghost machines with Black Dice's bass-heavy boiling. Around such a pulse, the remaining players pull noisy chunks right off the humming bone, picking the skeleton clean with saw-toothed oscillations and beaked stabs of hotwires before the side finally melts down into a single telltale heart pulsing against the floorboards. The seven players never quite reach the kinds of catharsis and climax that each separate entity produces, instead wallowing in the sort of dreaded ambience that, even when tossed off, offers a shivering sort of ebb and flow.",,7.4,

Why, in 2003, does he pander to the sickeningly ironic? Why even attempt the self-referential, in a format so attractive to the indolent and trend-hungry that it's already been done there a thousand times before? And why, for Christ's sake, on the very website where all the earlier Pitchfork scavengers at least reached postmodernism's corpse before it was just the dry, greasy bones being artlessly propped up here. These supposed ""journeys"" into the writers creative mind (where, as even Joyce wrongly thought, we apparently think without correct punctuation) are as uninsightful and lame as diaryish writing-about-writing can be, and a truly awful dramatic exercise between forgotten early-90s novelty rappers ""Kid'N'Play"" comes off as wholly unmoving even under the low, ironic standards of this sort of dialogue. Honestly, why do it?? Is he flailing in the ultimate impotence of the worried music critic, cowardly preempting his own inevitable criticism?? Is he that much in love with the ugly mental voice of his own feeble writing process that he feels he must proudly share it with us all, instead of actually working to produce coherent journalism? Or, as I suspect is probably the case, is he simply incapable of any coherent product, unable to produce anything in the proper, accepted form, and so resorts to this self-satisfied mishmash of uninformed genre dabbling and faux-confession. Perhaps the author believes that in the present enviroment of near-inescapable postmodernist criticism he can provide some definitive statement by reheating that same old dish once more, but the horse having been long-dead already doesn't make one's self-conscious flogging any more interesting.

P: Yeah, of course I do... what, do you? Okay, just got home, a few hours before my deadline, and once again it comes down to this-- is Obie Trice worth an actual paragraph?? Fuck, I honestly don't know if I can bring myself to plod through it. Right, okay, so: ""Got Some Teeth"" (track title) is the single (background information) with a bouncy, cartoonish beat (does that tell you enough?) by Eminem (identifying the producer, important), though Obie's (truncuation of artist's name) jokey rhymes (lyrical content) come off as sub-Eazy E (reference to previous artist who ""did it better""), especially considering (ooh! burn!!) he's meant to be the ""clown"" of Shady/Aftermath (I am not fooled by this artist's marketing). K: I dunno, I just don't really, I don't like that, offensive shit, you know. Whenever something is like, all dirty and misogynist, I just think of Marcus, you know, how he liked all that...
P: Yeah this isn't a Marcus thing, it's just really funny...
K: Well, that's what he said, like all the time, isn't it? ""Oh, this rap stuff is so fucking funny, it's fucking hilarious!!""... It shouldn't bother me still, but it does.
P: Yeah but you seem to use him as an excuse to not like any real hiphop... sorry, not ""real"" but you know what I mean.
K: No, it's like, I just can't give in to that part of myself, I know thats dumb but it seems like a betrayal to, the music and, like, to us, and just everything is... Look, I know this is unpleasant but it's easy enough to ignore, it's not the lead review, you don't care about Obie Trice, it's not the end of the world. Eventually it'll creep down the page and by next week no one will ever think about it again. Really, there's no false humility here. I know how bad it is. It's really bad. If you're reading now, and thinking about becoming a music writer for Pitchfork or anywhere else, my only advice (after ""just don't"") would be: Always Write About Yourself. Go on!! Write about how you're writing that review, about how your bitchy editor doesn't understand you, about the media format of the website or free weekly or whatever. If the article is due that night, write about the tail of the ""Q"" in the fucking font on your word processor. Make up terrible dialogues between characters and have them repeat discussions you had earlier that day. Why do I suggest this? Because I'm not a real writer. P: Did I tell you I saw Marcus downtown today?
K: No, oh... Christ, what was he doing?
P: Well, I dunno, he was with... they were just, I mean, she, you know...
K: Fuck, don't tell me that! What were they doing?!
P: Just, like, walking around, I said hi, but I don't really know either of them that well...
K: Yeah, Jesus, that's just... I fucking, ugh...
P: Yeah I know dude... I didn't mean to bring it up. I just think maybe, going back to what we were talking about, maybe you just can't get into more of the sort of, like, perverse stuff, just for now, because of... it's too soon, you know, like, for that kind of playful, sexualized stuff...
K: You're right. I'm going to die alone and unloved.
P: That's not what I said! We should just talk about something else, how was work today?
K: No, I'm serious, I really am.
P: Kid, how am I meant to take these requests... no, these outright CRAVINGS for sympathy, considering your absolute refusal to offer sympathy to anything else in the world?
K: .... It always seems so disposible, but so what if it is?? Why should we aspire to, as Lawrence Sterne said, ""swim down the gutter of Time""? (thats right you assholes, not Brent DiBenzino nor Barth nor Barthelme nor Thomas fucking Pynchon-- Tristam Shandy invented the pure horror of neurotic, self-referential writing!! He's stuck a novel called Tristam Shandy!!! It collapses into a descending spiral of self-reflexive bullshit!!! It's NOT FUCKING FUNNY!!). P: Okay, so the whole point of art, and subsequently criticism, is to have faith in things you wouldn't normally, I mean, suspension of disbelief is cliché for a reason, right? And look at America now, George Bush as dumb-but-honest, George Bush as strong-willed hero... the place for cynicism is fucking politics!! Ignore the ""machinations"" of the record industry, please!! Believe every spoken intent of the artists, wrap yourself in their lyrics, you critics need to reserve that spiteful, precocious cynicism for reality!!
K: Why do you keep awkwardly bringing George Bush into our conversation?
P: I dunno, why do you keep awkwardly bringing Obie Trice into it? Empty, grey sky. Dawn. Fiat lux. A lone plane gently soars acros FUCK This is the worst thing ever written by anyone!!! What the FUCK was I thinking?!!? ""Intentionally bad"" my ass!! Snide mimicry doesn't work as satire!! Is this supposed to be fucking Swiftian here, my lame, empty jabs at unpaid internet music critics?? I can't mock anything, who the hell do I think I am by trying?? Oh God... what if this means I really just wanted to write a genuine, sincere postmodernist PFork review?? With like, quotes from Samuel Beckett's LiveJournal, and pulpy Amazon explorer scenes, and lame gears-turning exposés of how I'm writing the review!! Fuck!! This is like the final sad recognition of my talentless hell, I may not actually be a good writer but I sure am good at hedging bets and second-guessing myself!! My flirtation with intellectual laziness has turned into a entire fucking affair!!! Wait... what if I let the self-hatred just become another caked-on layer of bad postmodernism?? And instead of a miserable failure... it would be a spectacular failure... a GLORIOUS failure!! And then, oh God, and then, by letting my readers in on this revelation, and using corny, quasi-religious words like ""glorious"", it would be even WORSE than before!! I am so, so sorry. K: Hold on, does he really think it's that important? Ethan P did ""unedited"" once!

Funfair,Child's View,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e2ea9e61561daa547b/1:1/w_160/1b9955c7.jpg,2003-11-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1729-funfair/,Bubble CoreBubble Core,"In early 1999, Nobukazu Takemura, recording as Child's View, quietly made his U.S. debut with the release of Funfair. Later that year, Thrill Jockey released the more abstract and difficult Scope, and, for better or worse, all the root ideas of the many, many Takemura records that followed can be found in these two albums. Listening to Funfair upon its reissue and having absorbed Hoshi No Koe, Sign, Water Suite, 10th, Songbook and Assembler/Assembler 2, I have to wonder: What the hell happened? How did this inventive artist, a guy who borrowed from post-techno IDM, pop, minimalism and 90s glitch and fashioned a readily identifiable and emotionally potent music of his own, come to turn out such inconsistent records mired in tedium? Takemura's oddly prolific artistic stagnation comes in part from his inability to move on once he's developed an interested technique. Funfair contains early recorded examples of several ideas he would go on to explore ad nauseam. The opening ""The Cradle of the Light"", for example, an achingly beautiful track that sounds like a skipping musicbox, works from essentially the same source material as Scope's ""Icefall"". This particular example of recycling never bothered me because the feel of the two tracks is so different. Where ""Icefall"" changes direction with a randomness that approaches violence, ""The Cradle of the Light"" is calm and serene, like a busted carousel speaker that continues to cycle through the same predictable but fascinating patterns. ""After Image"" comes later on Funfair but explores similar territory in terms of texture, and this time Takemura runs the simple bells through the shredder, creating an aural equivalent to a film that's lost its synchronization and flickers uncontrollably. Shifting gears, ""Saburé"" is one of Takemura's first and best stabs at tinkertoy electropop. Takemura emphasizes his synthetic vibe and mini-Moog melodies with cartoonish jungle breakbeats, which, five years on, impart a quaintness that only enhances the light and playful tone. That ""Saburé"" also closes the album in a successful live cover version by The Dylan Group underscores Takemura's songwriting skill during this period. Absent his masterfully patched synths and chopped rhythms, ""Saburé"" still makes for a captivating instrumental rock piece (no mean feat, that). The Dylan Group's acoustic guitars and simple keyboards demonstrate that Takemura was actually writing riffs, and it's great to hear his digitized vibes translated into the rich, extended tones of the real thing. Around this time The Dylan Group was also covering Aphex Twin, proving how well flexible well-crafted IDM with hints of pop could be translated into a live setting. The centerpiece of Funfair is the 15-minute ""Pendulum"". As she did on Scope's ""Kepler"" and the earlier ""Wax & Wane"", frequent Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko offers her childlike voice to be looped and manipulated inside a forest of hypnotic Reichian percussion. ""Pendulum"" is its own world, however, slow, blurry, drugged and dreamy where the others are crisp and bright. Xylophone, bass clarinet and organ provide the main instrumental accompaniment, but the various vocal loops are what make the track. I've heard some people describe ""Pendulum"" as a piece of crushing sadness, but I hear something else inside it, a sense of wonder tinged with danger because it all sounds a bit too open and defenseless. ""Pendulum"" is one of the best two or three tracks Takemura has recorded, and probably one of my twenty favorites by anybody in the last five years. Finally, there's ""Assi Que Dodo"" a more tuneful piece that seems a direct forbear to Takemura's Songbook experiments. Unlike the majority of Songbook, the melody on ""Assi Que Dodo"" is on point, even if it's not good enough to justify the song's 12 minutes. Of course, that this is the worst track says a lot about the overall quality of Funfair. While all the Takemura records since have a least flashes of brilliance (particularly Hoshi No Koe), they also have far too many skipable tracks, and some are downright painful to sit through in their entirety. But once upon a time his records were different. With Funfair, Takemura knew how to make an album work, and sadly, he hasn't made a consistently great full-length since.","In early 1999, Nobukazu Takemura, recording as Child's View, quietly made his U.S. debut with the release\n ...

Skull Ring,Iggy Pop,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ec5e6ef95969320087/1:1/w_160/8e846112.jpg,2003-11-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6409-skull-ring/,Virgin,"I take no pleasure in this, waiting to review Skull Ring. Lust for Life is on its third spin, I'm biting my nails, looking at Iggy's outstretched tongue in the liners to his latest, and wondering what happened to the guy. To forestall the inevitable, I figure I ought to at least get my good friend Lou on the phone, get his opinion on the elder Mr. Pop; very few people know Ig better, after all. I hit the speed-dial and wait; eventually the ringing stops, and with no word of greeting, only the icy breath coming through the receiver tells me he's on the line. ""Howdy, Lou."" ""What."" Should be a question, sounds like a statement. ""Just wondering if maybe you had a chance to listen to Iggy's latest album. He probably sent you an advance, right?"" ""Iggy who?"" ""Pop."" A pause. ""Isn't he dead?"" ""Doctors tell me he's not."" ""Have you listened to Beat 'Em Up?"" Clever guy, that Lou. ""Naw, man, if he's still hangin' on, I guess I didn't get a copy of Mood Ring, but I struggled through his last couple, and I'll say again what I told Bangs about Iggy: If he'd listened to David [Bowie] or Me, if he'd asked questions every once in a while... I'd say, 'Man, just make a one-five change, and I'll put it together for you, and you can take all the credit. It's so simple, but the way you're doin' it now you're just makin' a fool out of yourself. And it's just gonna get worse and worse...' And this was in 1975. Stop calling."" Lou walked away from the receiver; his contempt hung it up. 1975: still two years prior to The Idiot and Lust for Life; Lou sure had that call wrong. Of course, Bowie was still working with Iggy in Berlin for those, and if Lou was predicting a messy post-Stooges, post-Bowie end for the guy, he wasn't too far off. Still, I don't think he expected it would be dragged out across a handful of decades. Having listened to him languish since the release of the canned, thinly veiled jock jams of his 1990 ""comeback"" Brick by Brick (and even further back than that, if you ask me, though at least that one had ""Candy"") hasn't been easy for his fans, but after being sent to the mat hard-- twice in a row-- with the misplaced world-rock of 1999's Avenue B and the hard rock of 2001's Beat 'Em Up, you keep hoping he'll stay down, for chrissakes. At least on Avenue B, he failed while making a concerted effort to branch out away from the so-very-tired power chord cliches he'd been riding for years; Beat 'Em Up showed him crawling back, making his old-school rock ""xFC"" again, and failing at that, too. If he can't even pull off ""tough"" anymore, what's left? If the recent Peaches collaboration on her Fatherfucker doesn't prove that Ig's grasping at straws to attach himself to someone who approximates the controversy-driven ""nothing's sacred"" attitude he used to be known for, her contributions to Skull Ring ought to drive the point home. I don't care about any mutual admiration, or who asked who; this is simply embarrassing. The hypno-robotic buzz of ""Motor Inn"" might get the adrenaline flowing, but Iggy's desperate attempts at innuendo (""Her booty's got a rise/ Soon my hands will be/ Where I'm putting my eyes"") make it hard to take seriously. Similarly, Pop's cover of Peaches' ""Rock Show""-- especially the core ""rap""-- sounds stilted and forced, even with her conviction backing him up. His cool-by-association dalliance with the newest icon of image-over-talent is too hard to swallow given his recent falterings; a third trip to the canvas should be a T.K.O. But one look at Pop's grizzled, life-wracked frame proves he's resilient and ready to go down swinging. In fact, his perseverance in the face of self-created adversity is one of his most endearing qualities; it's hard to listen to ""Dum Dum Boys"" without a sympathetic ear to the various excesses of his time with The Stooges. Speaking of: You've probably already heard that Ron and Scotty Asheton contribute to a few songs on this record, making it as close to an official Stooges reunion as anyone's likely to see. And you know, they might've lost some of the breakneck tempo they once possessed, but the thin, treble-heavy grind of Ron's strings is still nearly as vicious now as it was then. Compared to the over-compensatory grandstanding of the other bands backing up Iggy here-- The Trolls, Green Day (!), and perhaps by the hand of Satan himself, Sum 41-- The Stooges get by with nothing but rattling, smoldering vitriol. Green Day (!) turn in a few notably driving riffs on ""Private Hell"", but the rest falls flat as overproduced, under-written, swaggering nonsense, as basic as rubbing three chords together. Of course, the one truth that's remained unchanged since 1977 is that The Stooges ain't nothin' without the Pop, and as misfortune would have it, he's nowhere to be found on Skull Ring. Sure, there's a guy singing who calls himself Iggy, but the similarities end at the name; like the drowned rat that he is, Iggy's fled this sinking ship and left a cantankerous shell to captain the wreckage. I believe Iggy himself is back walking the mean streets of Detroit, living on the edge of the night in a never-ending replay of his psychotic days hanging with the MC5, trading his body heroin for blood, and spraying the exchange on the walls; his replacement for now and ever more is James Osterberg, an aging approximation of one of history's greatest all-time rock stars. As recently as last album, Pop at least turned in a righteous snarl or two; here Osterberg sounds distant and lost. He nearly rips off his very own ""Search and Destroy"" with the line, ""I'm the kid that no one knows/ I live a life I never chose,"" and in doing so sounds utterly defeated. Iggy had a heart full of napalm; Osterberg is just cranky. People can moan about how it's unfair to hold artists up to the magnitude of past accomplishments, and they're right. But Stooges or not, this is a dismal, unengaging rock record by any standards-- one that absolutely wilts in the light of such past brilliance. It might not be fair, but you know what, Iggy? I still miss you.","I take no pleasure in this, waiting to review Skull Ring. Lust for Life is on its third\n\ spin ...

Spoon & Rafter,Mojave 3,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c388eb335119a49ed729/1:1/w_160/6f11a4a4.jpg,2003-11-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5378-spoon-rafter/,4AD,"It was seven years ago now that Mojave 3 rose from the ashes of Slowdive, but to listen to them, it's as though time has stood still. Since he let his folk jones shine through the gauze of guitar that enshrouded Slowdive's music, frontman Neil Halstead has drawn a steady stream of comparisons to everyone from Bob Dylan to Nick Drake. Purely in terms of mood and atmosphere, Drake's more baroque work (think Bryter Layter) isn't that far off the mark, but beyond that, things get sticky. Halstead simply isn't a singer/songwriter in the conventional sense: rather than relying on lyrics as a focal point, his music remains essentially texture-based, putting arrangements at the fore. Halstead's knack for stunning arrangements is in top form on Spoon & Rafter, and in this capacity, his music remains compelling, if no more or less than on any of his previous trilogy of Mojave 3 releases. As usual, Halstead's vocals remain calm and measured throughout the record, his sleepy tenor rarely ever rising above a murmur-- in fact, he more often recedes to a mere whisper. ""Billoddity"", as with any of the rest of the album's tracks, spotlights his relaxed vocal, but the song's arrangement is what makes this track pop: it's an upbeat number (by Mojave 3's standards, anyway), trotting on strummed guitars and a beat that calls to mind Stoned & Dethroned-era Jesus & Mary Chain. But ""Battle of the Broken Hearts"" is the true centerpiece and standout, with quiet glockenspiel- and Theremin-adorned verses and head-bobbing choruses that bounce on piano and cello accompaniment. One unfortunate change that does separate Spoon & Rafter from other Mojave 3 albums is that angel-voiced bassist Rachel Goswell doesn't sing lead on a single track-- she's instead relegated entirely to background harmonies. This has the adverse effect of highlighting the band's monochromaticity, though they do their best to make up for it with little flourishes like the Moogs that populate ""Tinker's Blues"" or the banjo that turns up on closer ""Between the Bars"". That last song has the most overt country feel of any song here, with a loping two-step, lonely harmonica and swelling pedal steel surrounding Goswell and Halstead's Prairie Home Companion-style harmonies. Of course, at the end of the day, Mojave 3, while an appealing band, aren't so appealing that owning more than one of their albums is at all necessary. If you're interested-- and any fan of Mazzy Star, Acetone, the Cowboy Junkies or others of that ilk probably has reason to be-- you're best off choosing one and ending it there. Spoon & Rafter, if mainly because of Rachel Goswell's decreased presence, isn't that album, although if you find it cheap, it's unlikely you'd be disappointed.","It was seven years ago now that Mojave 3 rose from the ashes of Slowdive, but to listen to them ...

Under the Tray,Reggie and the Full Effect,by: Noah Sutcliffe,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2495e6ef959693203a5/1:1/w_160/015b422e.jpg,2003-11-03 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6742-under-the-tray/,Vagrant,"In the sick and twisted world of 00s pop, rock bands may as well be legal stimulants: The Strokes are cigarettes; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, chewing gum; Reggie & The Full Effect, a slurpee doused with Skittles, Starbursts, and sugar packets. For the uninitiated, Reggie is the, ahem, schizophrenic twin of Get Up Kids' piano man James DeWees. He's surrounded by indie folklore and a suitable cloud of hype, which, like Reggie's earlier use of lo-fi recording techniques, attempts to obscure the shortcomings of previous efforts. Not to worry: Under the Tray producer Ed Rose strips away that fuzz like a roofer in the Kansas City sun. What's underneath? Pure indulgence. Whether it's the driving synth juice that kicks off ""Congratulations Smack + Katy"" or the Sprockets-esque bounce of ""Mood 4 Luv"", Under the Tray remains, for its entire duration, a bottomless fountain spewing the thickest imaginable cheese-pop. Indeed, the physical need to stop Reggie from plodding past the two-minute mark, as he does on most of these songs, is difficult to ignore. As novelty, this music is momentarily intriguing, but it quickly becomes monotonous, and its sonic intensity results in a dizzying sensory overload on all but a few songs. Rose ups the ante on production of Under the Tray, as it slips out of the lo-fi sheath that covered Promotional Copy. If DeWees and the 'Kids had responded with improved songwriting, Under the Tray might have emerged as a more captivating pop album; alas, Reggie is capable of no such effect. The guitars sound meaty, the drums spacey, and the keyboards twinkly, but the band's running on Equal, and when they finally burn out, it's not a pretty scene. It actually only took two or three seconds for ""Apocalypse WOW!"" to begin pruning away my dendrites, and as ""Megan 2K2"" rolled through 2K3 and beyond, I began to wonder why Vagrant even keeps them on the roster-- and this is Vagrant, you guys. Under the Tray's lyrics pull all the punches you'd expect: love, roses and ""posers."" There are a few jokes floating around in the syrup, but I can't say I'd be caught dead dropping $14 to find them in this dreck. I suppose one wouldn't expect The Get Up Kids to break out of their saccharine mold with this particular side-outing, but it's depressing to see such a dearth of inventiveness even after a band achieves instrumental competence-- if only through the accident of age.

Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor's sterile, skeletal song structures are a little better fed and fleshed out this time around, chartering thin rays of hope like sacks of turnips enterprisingly stolen with desperation's iron grip. The carpenters of change are twofold: newly arresting manipulations of electronic elements interlock with the duo's traditional organic fare, as well as bolder and sharper production approaches by longtime producer Eric ""Crooked Fingers"" Bachmann. The first three tracks slide in smoothly, showcasing drum programming, dexterous electronic measures, and textured arrangements-- all, of course, still very much shadowed by Fink and Taylor's sleepy harmonies. Their vocals remain the centerpiece of the mixture, tenderly wrapping around each other like weathered fingers on praying hands, and they retain the maudlin and enchanting tone of the duo's previous work even amongst more ambitious and adventurous routes. Elements that were once relied upon solely-- gentle piano, lazy acoustic guitar, sparse percussion-- are now accompanied, and sometimes overshadowed, by Azure Ray's new evocative sonic conviction. ""New Resolution"" even rocks a little, in a tiny electronic symphony sort of way, and the mid-album track ""If You Fall"" is downright animated, curiously parallel in tone to the work of labelmates Rilo Kiley. The duo's strength, though, remains the plaintive, tearful moments they so longingly craft. ""We Are Mice"", ""The Drinks We Drank Last Night"", and ""Hold on Love"" are highlights-- serene, direct vehicles for the duo's vocal prowess, albeit with a little less murkiness and a sharp sense of innovation. ""Look to Me"" plays on delicate falling-rain acoustic guitar with uneasy resignation. ""These Bright Lights Will Bend to Make Blue"" also creeps alluringly, perfectly cradling tones of cautious hope within. The lyrics are a bit thin, but its rarely an issue given the beauty of the voices that carry them. I could, of course, do without more than one song delineating ""pain inside,"" but if it came down to sacrificing the message or the messengers, the choice would be clear-cut. This is a band best served by straight lines, as is perfectly exemplified on roughly half this album, when they allow quiet hints of hope to belie a simple deployment of sentiment. Unfortunately, Hold on Love's more serene moments only weaken the lure of their more intricate and involved songs, ultimately underscoring the group's true strengths. As such, Hold on Love goes down in the books as their shiniest, though half-reflective, work to date.","Hold on Love, Azure Ray's third proper full-length, sees them hightailing out of their former albums' southern folk aesthetic ...

Logic Will Break Your Heart,The Stills,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6449d034d5c69bf34c7/1:1/w_160/4e5db77e.jpg,2003-11-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7718-logic-will-break-your-heart/,AtlanticVice,"Beware of lazy critics trying to turn us all into velcro-magnons. This album is not a ""classic."" As a member of that crucial demographic that has outlived Keats but not Jesus, I can understand why young'uns might consider Logic Will Break Your Heart poetic while the oldies find it miraculous. But those of us aged 27-32 have been thoroughly banged around by rock history revisions, fluctuations in irony, surrogate nostalgia, genre inbreeding, genre crossbreeding, and the pursuit of cool-- we've grown up inside a pasticheteria, so we know that The Stills are what The Posies were in their day, and what The Libertines were a few minutes ago: stuck in a phantom zone called ""not there yet,"" and possibly because the personalities of their influences eclipse any sense of identity they could muster. The Stills are a complicated case, though, inspiring equal amounts of pleasure and horror, like that dream in which everyone has mozzarella genitals. Speaking of dreams, didn't you want to believe the hype that this would be the album equivalent of what the film Donnie Darko was, a thrilling amalgam of eightiesness? The movie comprehensively homaged its forebears, dreaded its Republicans, and imaginatively conveyed the eerie and tragic. The Stills take some big cues from Darko's soundtrack standouts Echo & The Bunnymen, The Church, and Joy Division, but their retro arrangements, percussive guitar work, and ""big"" cavernous production have been beaten to the market by too many other bands, among them Interpol, The Organ, and several of those post-P.I.L., disco-bassline-abusing, Sly-and-the-Family-Stroke ""dancepunks."" The album does contain some fascinatingly elliptical ""political"" material, most notably ""Lola Stars and Stripes"" and ""Let's Roll"", which begins, if I can figure out Tim Fletcher's oversexed slur: ""Lie on the floor of the runway, babe, then/ Wait for the ride/ We'll have a comfortable flight/ Don't be afraid to be afraid here with me."" This post-boxcutter tune goes on to discuss plunging into wormholes, providing a ""fanciful"" take on the terror-war kickoff, and furthering the Donnie Darko connections. (The song definitely outperforms Neil Young's ""Let's Roll"", which is karmically funny, considering that a barrage of CSN&Y; is what comes up when one seeks file-sharers for ""Stills."") And about Tim Fletcher: he is the rare singer who is too proficient. This indie-rock Streisand is perfectly modulated throughout the album: guttural Bowie here, castrati Coldplay there, to the point that one never buys his band's rapturous lyrics. Straightjacketed by overproduction, no amount of Reagan-jangle lends him the requisite gone-daddy-gone-ness. And about that hit single: ""Still in Love Song"" is, of course, protectively and cynically titled, since the song repeats ""still in love"" as many times as our gubmint barks ""weapons o' mass destruction"" in hopes that we memorize and internalize it (sigh, at the illogic of patriotism breaking ones' heart). This old Motown technique confirms that the song ""bumps,"" but denies it ""tha bomb"" status, especially since it's a bait-and-switch considering the rest of the album's non-club sound. What makes matters more desperate is that ""Still in Love Song"" was already released on the band's debut EP, and will probably appear on their sophomore LP as ""I Still Know You're in Love Last Summer"" and later it will be their only entry on Cheney Beat!, the future K-tel compilation of hits from our epoch. When the chorus goes from minor to major during the breakdown, you can hear God's hernia acting up. In his recent book The Middle Mind, novelist Curtis White decries post-modern pluralism as the horny hypocrite that it is, and too often, The Stills try to commandeer a three-way between their savvy, their dopeyness, and their savvily dopey pop heritage. See their song titles: you get compelling poetry such as ""Gender Bombs"" and ""Yesterday Never Tomorrows"", cliches such as ""Ready for It"" and ""Love and Death"", and insider references such as ""Of Montreal"" and ""Allison Krausse"". (The Middle Mind's perfect work of art: eighties pastiche Blue Velvet, about the banality of evil, the banality of good, and the banality of banality.) BEST SONG: ""Animals and Insects"", by far. The only number that flirts with both lo-fi production and Schneider TM-style eclecto-rash, this track thanks The Cure for their Seventeen Seconds drum stylings and even lends a gorgeous melodrama to the sororitese mantra ""oh my god."" Did I mention that the ditty is about mass murder? When those drums explode, I'm like, brainwash me, you Canadian New Yorkers!

Married Alive,Mood Elevator,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c443ea9e61561daa80ef/1:1/w_160/dbefd934.jpg,2003-11-02 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5559-married-alive/,Doppler,"In a classic case of chicken vs. egg, it's easy to assume that the Brendan Benson-fronted band Mood Elevator is little more than an emancipated version of Benson's backing band, the Well-Fed Boys. This is more than just another subtle experiment in power shifts, though-- the three-year old band is the product of Benson and songwriter Chris Plum's long-standing high school friendship, a rapport reignited in Detroit in 2000, on the heels of Benson's trying One Mississippi sessions. With his own brand new home studio, built on Virgin Records advance dollars, Benson offered to record and produce a handful of Plum's songs; from this, Mood Elevator (with bassist Eric Potts, drummer Matt Aljian, and guitarist Zach Shipp) was born. A few short months later, the group's debut LP, Listen Up!, was released. (Perpetuating pesky Detroit in-breeding, Shipp has since bowed out of Mood Elevator to become Electric Six bandmember ""The Colonel."") When Benson was asked to select a backing band to accompany him on his Lapalco tour last year, Mood Elevator was his obvious choice, and the group took on a new name, performing behind Benson as the Well-Fed Boys. With Mood Elevator proper, Benson chipped in rhythm guitar, percussion, and a few lilting vocal harmonies, but generously forked over the leading-man post to Plum, whose deep, clear coo functions kind of like a funhouse version of Benson's: a little more raucous, but still perpetually on-key and curiously adolescent. Over half of the album sees just Plum and Benson credited as players, and their balanced push/pull interplay instantly reveals the well-rooted relationship from which the project sprouted. Mostly, Married Alive offers a slightly rowdier version of Benson's beloved pop/rock, a hybrid foot-tapper with more drum fills and distortion, but not quite as much beguiling charm. Whereas Benson's solo charisma has always been inextricably handcuffed to his genuine, sweet-faced whine, Mood Elevator's choice to skew a little rockier (read: big, Keith Moon-ish percussion and a splattering of expletives) has also cost the band its potentially appealing innocence. Still, Benson and Plum are both skilled songwriters, and each of this album's eleven tracks are carefully scribed, hook-riddled pop shouts, occasionally generic but always well-accessorized. As its title suggests, Married Alive is also full of goofy, locker-room heartbreak, with loads of exasperating lyrics about doing dumb shit in the name of love: looking the word ""baby"" up in the dictionary (""It always seemed to me/ A baby is supposed to be someone/ Who really loves you"") or nobly lamenting your shortcomings (""Anxious, anxious kind of guy/ I'm no longer cool/ I no longer rule""). The instrumentation follows suit: the Beach Boys-inspired summertime slinger ""Long Hard Look"" ties golden keyboard lines to singalong harmonies and rolling guitars, while ""Something I Need"" offers even more vocal frolicking, with Benson and Plum vigorously trading off sunny witticisms. Married Alive's liner notes feature a capitalized decree laid out in big gray letters: ""Love Breaks Your Heart."" It's age-old pop sentiment, true but irksomely familiar, unspecific, and ultimately unaffecting. This record is a testament to Plum and Benson's obvious capacity (see any of Benson's work with the Well-Fed Boys) for melody and harmony, but in the end, its songs are about as earth-shattering as its lyrical agenda.","In a classic case of chicken vs. egg, it's easy to assume that the Brendan Benson-fronted band Mood Elevator ...

The Secretariat Motor Hotel,Ashley Park,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11d5e6ef959693200fd/1:1/w_160/23513e52.jpg,2003-11-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/316-the-secretariat-motor-hotel/,Darling,"On 2001's American Scene, Ashley Park were the lesser, naïve cousins of such variegated indie-pop bands as Beulah and every band Sasha Bell ever joined, content to simply emulate those they admired. Dawdling in what heartier music fans might affectionately call ""puss-rock,"" Ashley Park doused their second album in barrelfuls of feyness, sullenness, aloofness, and non-alcoholic white wine. Their new album, The Secretariat Motor Hotel, dispenses with those rather poorly advised excursions into baroque, synth, and general Kindercore pop, and makes a full-length out of American Scene's ""The Last Day in the Life of Grand"". What this means for the average listener can be easily summarized: This is the most startlingly stereotypical alt-country I've ever heard. So to felicitate this review, I decided to theorize a song representing every song on this album that, for the sake of convenience, I shall christen ""It Looks Like the Farm's Horses Are Mighty Solitary in the Cosmos, Old Man Tuckerson"" (this would not be the most ridiculous title on the album). I stole this paragraph from the rough draft of my Sweetheart of the Rodeo review. I apologize for not writing a new one, but I got a hot date: ""It Looks Like..."" is a meandering ramble hidden in dewed bales of hay and rugged mounds of desert clay. Oaken guitars tortuously wrangle cattle, while the detached, conversational vocals circulate messages roughly equivalent to ""I am always alone, except when in a passionate embrace with the woman I love even when she occasionally leaves me."" The atmosphere of the production is a damp ditch in a trail leading to a snowy tavern. The songs are as exuberantly melodic as the performers are eerily disconsolate. It's the soundtrack to lives persecuted by society and befriended by airy pastures, families with straw on their backs, hail in their roofless bedrooms, sorrow in their consciences, and jubilance in their everyday lives. I understand that sounds sarcastic, but that's more the fault of my inability to be sincere than any specific vindictiveness on my part. There's nothing inherently wrong with music that fits the above description. Hell, that review might as well be applied to the state of Vermont. It's one of those albums that's already present in everyone's consciousnesses, where you already know the direction of every chorus and the placement of every slide guitar solo. It adds and detracts nothing to the formula while being intended as little more than homage to a genre. The songs are rarely differentiated. Occasionally, some organs will slide under the dejected mood or Kelly Haigh's back-up vocals will become more prominent, but, for the most part, this may as well be one endearingly slothful 40-minute track.","On 2001's American Scene, Ashley Park were the lesser, na\xEFve cousins of such variegated indie-pop\n\ bands as ...

Birthday EP,Junior Boys,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb395e6ef95969322b72/1:1/w_160/fd7bfda2.gif,2003-10-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4339-birthday-ep/,Kin,"In his review of Tujiko Noriko's From Tokyo to Naigara, fellow PFM writer Nitsuh Abebe placed an umbrella over ambient indie popsters who use delicate electronic melodies to convey the wistful yet wounded sensations that were once frequently articulated by jangly guitars and boy/girl vocals. Nitsuh gathered half of the Morr Music roster, Solvent, and Ulrich Schnauss, among others, and made them compatriots in a sort of un-named movement of bedroom electronica-- a marriage of indie sentiment and sensibility with sleepy laptop-driven melodies. In one sense, the Junior Boys fit here as well. On the EP's two vocal tracks, ""Birthday"" and ""Last Exit"", singer Jeremy Greenspan's fragile vocals relay lovelorn lyrics soaked in indie's too-familiar, almost inevitable cycle of pain and resignation. ""Take all this weight behind me/ And let it go,"" he pleads on ""Birthday"", trying to come to grips with rejection and strip himself of some of its debilitating weight. And yet, in another more engaging and encouraging sense, Junior Boys don't fit that lap-pop model at all. Pigeonholing Junior Boys amongst most of those artists negates their considerable command of more complex rhythms, as well as their grasp of dance and avant-pop traditions. Sonically, Junior Boys have condensed a large group of very apparent touchstones from (deep breath) Timbaland's icier more futurist production work to the texture and syncopation of two-step pioneers such as Todd Edwards and Dem 2 to the shimmer of early 80s synth-pop to Basic Channel's blissful tech-dub. In the process, they've created an alchemic sound that, after only one EP, is both identifiable and unique. Of the EP's other three songs, the graceful romanticism of ""Birthday"" spills over to ""Last Exit"", seven minutes of swoon and sigh, dance grooves and bedsit mournfulness, in which Greenspan whispers things like ""you make me feel more than real"" over a heart-tugging shiver of sound. The instrumental ""Unbirthday"" echoes the ghosts of a scrum between Herrmann & Kleine's ""Kickboard Girl"", Rhythm & Sound, and dubstep. And the EP closes with possibly its most immediately striking track, a Fennesz remix of ""Last Exit"". The Austrian star leaves the track's pop heart intact and offers it a series of trembling electroshocks. Despite that accomplished second half of the record, it's those two vocal tracks that nicely highlight the band's strength: effortlessly bleeding their songcraft into groove and rhythm, creating a delicate sculpture of broken dreams and beats. Sure, plenty of glitch or tech-house pioneers have tried the same in recent years, but they've mostly rushed arms wide open to disco-pop, swinging swiftly from clicks and cuts to digital disco. Surprisingly-- until this EP-- only Coloma and Vladislav Delay's Luomo project have attempted to bridge that gulf and position themselves somewhere between those two poles with any success. In an odd way, then, it's those three (Junior Boys, Coloma, Luomo)-- each of whom sound far less like the most frequently resurrected memories of ""80s music""-- that best capture the elegance and sophistication in some of that decade's synth-pop. I almost hesitate to even mention that decade because the inherently selective nature of revivalism already gives specific connotations to anything that is either electronic or reminiscent of the 1980s. But never mind the prevailing cycle of today's nostalgia. Junior Boys don't come across like the more synthetic, decadent end of electroclash. Instead, they trade in the slightly scuffed sheen of the decade's more heartfelt soundscapes, delivering tracks for the day after the disco-- soundtracks to mental slideshows of good times, the paradoxically cold reality of daylight, and the potential pain of wondering how soon is now.","In his review of Tujiko Noriko's From Tokyo to Naigara, fellow PFM writer Nitsuh Abebe placed an umbrella over ...

Full Circle,Hieroglyphics,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a513d197565213869c/1:1/w_160/7ba8400a.jpg,2003-10-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3970-full-circle/,Hieroglyphics,"Back in the early 90s, as a series of classic records from thousands of west coast street linguists were assaulting record stores nationwide, the massive Hieroglyphics collective was busy helping to shape the lyric-intensive west coast underground style and rising to prominence on the independent circuit. More than ten years on from their first recordings, the lineup still intimidates: Casual, Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, Souls of Mischief, Pep Love, and Domino. Full Circle, their first full-length together since 1998's Third Eye Vision, shows them still aggressively tackling concepts like the nature of their former and current sales capacity (""One Hundred Thousand Indi""), disenchantment with authority figures (""Powers That Be"") and the trials and tribulations of the typical Hiero tour date (""Chicago""). Most prominently, the boys elaborate on intellectual rap braggadocio (""Catch me with a group of babes, stunting like Super Dave"") and expound upon common rap clichés (money, cars, wack rappers, females, weed) with a street-smart looseness and rhyming proficiency reminiscent of late Freestyle Fellowship. Although it conflicts with their former anti-commercial mindstate, it still works due to the charismatic and lyrical status of the flow magistrates in question. Where most emcees talk of women in the context of their groupies or trifling significant others, a stark moment on Full Circle comes with the masterful narrative ""Maggie May"". Over a subtle drum arrangement, light upright bass plucks and a depressive trumpet sample, the collective delivers a eulogy for a fallen friend, each Hiero head detailing their own connection to the nominal character with a verse about her descent in the face of drugs and prostitution. Their differing lyrical approaches apply variety to the topic, along with interesting views and tight rhyme schemes. Each rapper writes from a different time in her devolution, from Opio rooming with her during college to Del declining her sexual advances in the prime of her promiscuity to Tajai running into her as a strung-out cokehead. Narratives don't manage to work on both technical and conceptual levels very often, but in a stunning return to form, the triple-eyed alliance emerges with what could stand as a modern classic. Those expecting the same basic sample piling that made 93 'Til Infinity and Fear Itself such classics should be prepared for a shock. More along the lines of Del's production on his own Both Sides of the Brain (and to a lesser extent, Casual's on He Think He Raw), Domino, A-Plus and Casual have seemingly cleaned up their beats, opting for the sophisticated bombast of synthetic instrumentation and a far more subtle sampling style. Unexpectedly, their collective production prowess works admirably, from the sluggish Timbaland-esque glitch-hop of ""Heatish"" to the chopped Venice strings and tavern keys of ""Shift Shape"" to the frantic rattle-and-strum and funky drumming of ""Chicago"". In the stone face of evolution, the Hiero crew do stagger somewhat with a lack of conceptual depth: the classic simplicity of beats that marked their previous outings has faded, there are a handful of repetitive tracks (""Fantasy Island"", ""Let It Roll""), and, with the exception of his strong conviction on ""7 Sixes"", former asset Del totally sleepwalks through the record. But even in the presence of bad decision-making, the point is made: Hieroglyphics remain ever relevant in the rapidly changing world of underground rap.","Back in the early 90s, as a series of classic records from thousands of west coast street linguists were\n ...

Or, admittedly, for my part: a faulty perspective-taking mechanism. This sort of wide-eyed high school glory rock, here pressed and sold by The Red Hot Valentines, is altogether lost on me, and though I'd rather not think too intently on where it would have registered with me at fourteen (I just flat out don't trust myself, to be honest), I'm wholly out of this band's target audience nearly ten years thereafter. Not to mention, newly down on the hollow plight of today's pubescent youths-- or at least the sort of music they can get their hands on. All ten songs from Summer Fling fall neatly within the confines of a Jimmy Eat World to Saves the Day enclave, with some synth-peppered Rentals textures looming portentously on the territorial outskirts. Crunchy three-chord pop/punk guitars ride kid-safe emotional rollercoaster dynamics through brimming-thick and baseline/vocal-thin. The formula features a sort of sing-by-committee affair that sometimes forgivingly uses three-part harmonies to drown out the nasal lead vocal mewling. ""Wishful Thinking"" adds a little more punch to the mix, and the requisite acoustic lamentation ""I Want To"" ventures into shallow Get Up Kids tide pools, but for the most part, these songs are unabashedly linear. The packaging even features a notebook-styled lyric book, filled with playful and lovelorn margin doodling, Polaroid pics of the band making funny faces, and handwritten lyrics-- five pages of: ""I've got a pocket full of secrets/ No one knows what I keep in it,"" ""Are you that far away from me that you'd forget about the time we watched the sunrise from my car/ And you woke up in my arms?"" (Curfews?! Anyone?), ""Tell everyone I'm chasing the sun/ 'Cause I can't wait for summer."" Everything above serves to remind me: There's a damn good reason I've conveniently/permanently misplaced my own high school poetry. These fine young men may well be the sort guys you'd one day want your daughter to bring home from college; innocent, well-intentioned, and musically inclined-- but when I have kids I don't want to find this sort of album lying around the house, or, God forbid, hear it blaring from upstairs while I'm trying to organize my compact disc collection.","What we have here is a failure to commiserate.

Fatherfucker,Peaches,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01aea9e61561daa44be/1:1/w_160/c687c793.jpg,2003-10-29 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6204-fatherfucker/,XL,"There are plenty of perfectly good ways to say ""I don't give a fuck."" Unfortunately, screaming ""I don't give a fuck"" at the top of your lungs over and over again isn't one of them. It's hard to imagine anything sadder than someone expending such a huge amount of energy trying to prove that, no, really, she doesn't give a fuck-- except, of course, for this desperate plea for attention being followed by the very apathy and disaffection it promises. Such is the case with Peaches' intensely disappointing second album Fatherfucker, which couples gratuitously ""shocking"" and embarrassingly unfunny lyrics with flat, lackluster instrumentation. For all its sexed-up bravado, Peaches' debut, last year's The Teaches of Peaches, was in a class of its own, if nothing else: something about the way she approached her subject matter with such hilarious juvenility and unabashed, joyful conviction, while going to all possible extremes to make herself appear as unapproachably hideous as possible, struck me as irresistible. Right from its frank opening line, ""Sucking on my titties,"" the album lived up to its name, providing a urgently needed collection of dirty schoolyard ditties for the immature and oversexed electroclash set. One of its best attributes was its ability to leave you wondering whether Peaches took any of it seriously: was she actually promoting a lifestyle of canned drum machine beats and empty, gratuitous sex, or sending it up so masterfully that her songs could be embraced by the very people she mocked? Either way, the joke's on Peaches here. When Fatherfucker opens with ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", in which a sample of Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" is answered, over the course of nearly two minutes, with a painfully drawn-out tantrum: ""I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!"" Yet, as outright terrible as this track is, Fatherfucker's general mediocrity and sterility proves even more frustrating. The gritty, overdriven 808 beats of Teaches were one of its greatest assets-- a welcome respite from the glossy, platonic ideal percussion tracks employed by so many electroclash artists. The beats on Fatherfucker are not only frustratingly simplistic, but the energy and surprising rhythmic complexity of the vocals on her debut are noticeably absent, too. Songs like ""I U She"" and ""I'm the Kinda"" consist of little more than minimal and repetitive lyrics delivered dispassionately over cookie-cutter drum machine beats. Whether she's singing about bitches, fucking, clits, threesomes, or porkbelly futures doesn't really matter; after a few songs, you, like Peaches, don't give a fuck-- and you don't have to fuck up a Joan Jett record to prove it. Nor do you have to indulge in a miserable, stupidly self-referential duet with Iggy Pop. In ""Tear It Up"", Iggy and Peaches throw back and forth snippets of each other's lyrics and references to their respective schticks. ""I used to cut myself up!"" says Iggy. ""Some people don't like my crotch!"" says Peaches. ""Hey, guys, shut the fuck up!"" says the imaginary singer I hallucinated out of boredom, offering up a lyric far too honest and straightforward to have been worked into the original song. Lame duets aside, there remain a lot of things I really like about Peaches. With all the press coverage she's been receiving as of late, she continues to willfully defy all conventional notions of attractiveness in the way she chooses to be photographed, and her live shows remain entertaining, despite weaker source material. Yes, Fatherfucker is a disaster, but it's a disaster that reveals just how unlikely its still-excellent predecessor was. Here, the swollen charisma and balls-out energy of Teaches is given up in favor of mediocre songs about swollen balls. Sorry, Peaches, but sometimes it pays to give a fuck.","There are plenty of perfectly good ways to say ""I don't give a fuck."" Unfortunately, screaming ""I don't ...

Parts in the Post,Plaid,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09f5e6ef9596931ffcb/1:1/w_160/97423b4c.jpg,2003-10-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6336-parts-in-the-post/,Warp,"Based on my limited knowledge of Rolling Stone interviews, musicians are beset by mounds of corrupt execs, massive mergers, treasonous KaZaA-crazy toddlers, and the aesthetic discomfort of the new $20 bill. As if those mattered. All those afflictions were dropped into Malibu and Bel-Air by the CIA in the mid-80s to distract them from the actual problem: Warp Records. When will people learn? Between Autechre and Aphex Twin alone, this simple and poorly worded aphorism should have been memorized by kindergartners: If you have a new song, DO NOT send it to Warp. Wave after wave of demos and masters are quickly deposited in the clammy hands of madmen. If the original artists are a song's parents, Warp remixers are those babysitters with gold eyepatches, tracks down their arms, fu-manchus, and babies speared on meat hooks in the basement. Nevertheless, this new double-disc compilation of virtually every major Plaid remix since 1995 shows that those reliable IDM lobbyists, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, somehow wrangled a whopping eighteen artists into letting them defile, dismantle, deconstruct, and generally destroy every genre from splintering big beat to twinkling Parisian accordion jams. Plaid have always excelled at melding tuneful melodies, ever on the brink of collapse, and the tarry mechanical weight of drum-n-bass and Detroit techno. This conjunction lends itself extraordinarily well to remixing as it effectively ensures that every track is filled out to its breaking point, balanced between immaterial and immolation. On a song like Reflection's ""Spiral Bits"" or Herbert's ""Foreign Bodies"", the sensation isn't clichéd popping, but volcanic romance: the release of an eruption surrounded by the weightlessness of ash. Witness how Gregory Fleckner Quartet's ""Juicy Jazz Girls"" begins with brilliantly delicate melodies and is eventually subsumed by the scuttling vermin crawling underneath the song's floorboards until, seven minutes later, the melody wreaks havoc on the abrasiveness again. It's dance music that's very, um, intelligent. The version of Dropshadow's ""Disease Fototienda"" is suffused with xylophonic scales, bent mandolins, military snares and sparkling orchestral pop, and bound with Velcro. Plaid replace the sinisterly throbbing undercurrent of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love"" with a heightened fragility, and instate a subliminal scrape on the bass that's even more meditative than the Homogenic version. Unfortunately, this is an exception. The few remixes of more popular artists seem slightly overburdened by the originals. Goldfrapp's own handling of disarming choruses on ""Utopia"" seems to limit Plaid's opportunities. Grandmaster Flash's ""Scorpio"" sounds like a great idea on the tracklist, but neglects the original's playfulness for its own nostalgia. Even worse, it's remarkably monotonous, throwing back to the decrepit second volume of MTV's Amp compilation series. But of the material I take issue with here, the two Nicolette tracks, ""No Government"" and ""Wholesome"", are by far the most disheartening. I have no fear of the ruling elite. My opinion still stands: Nicolette is in a league of intolerability with Breakbeat Era's Leonie Laws or Lamb's Louise Rhodes. And what's really frustrating? They're two of the best tracks on the album, which wins them the dubious distinction of being perhaps the most stunning remixes of atrocious source material since Kruder & Dorfmeister's ""Bug Powder Dust"". ""Wholesome"", in particular, is transformed into one of the best Plaid songs ever, managing to litter pockets of orchestral pop amidst a tense dub, and even finding room for a quick sample of The Meters. Why the hell did they have to put ""Love is wholesome/ Love makes babies"" at the beginning of it? Although Plaid are far from ""difficult"" for their genre, this is perhaps the best place for beginners to set out. The panoply of different moods and tempos is even more diverse than the last major compilation, Trainer, and that album is primed to be one of the best releases of the decade. Plaid has never been boring, but on this album, the jumps from the monstrously webbed and bloating ""Wrong Ways"" and the affecting worldliness of Coba's ""After Dinner"", prove, like Aphex a few months ago, that a musician's finest work does not always need to be their work.","Based on my limited knowledge of Rolling Stone interviews, musicians are beset by mounds of corrupt\n\ execs, massive mergers ...

Rise Up!,Black-Eyed Snakes,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cfc0084474cd0bfc6b/1:1/w_160/aace83fa.jpg,2003-10-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/756-rise-up/,Chairkickers Union,"There's something stupidly redundant about dubbing a record ""blues-based rock and roll,"" given rock's excruciatingly well-documented rural roots. Occasionally, though, a contemporary rock outfit will faithfully resurrect not just the now-ubiquitous 12-bar noodle, but also the coy, shifty-eyed spirit of the original blues, simultaneously employing skeleton cover art, cornbread mantras, and goofily enigmatic aliases. The Black-Eyed Snakes, the unlikely side project of Low's Alan Sparhawk, have wisely shied away from the puttering, voodoo blues schtick that made their 2001 debut, It's the Black-Eyed Snakes, play like pure masquerade. The members have, however, dutifully retained their cheeky blues pseudonyms (Alan Sparhawk continues to appear as ""Chicken-Bone George""), and a biography that reads like bad Toni Morrison (""OK, these ain't your mother and daddys Black-Eyed Snakes. Best tell everyone: things changed."") But Rise Up! is, at least sonically, a considerably less gimmicky effort than its predecessor, far more concerned with capturing the unquestionable ecstasy of riffing than with showcasing quasi-ironic posturing. Ultimately, Rise Up! transgresses, rather than regurgitates, knee-jerk blues formula; The Black-Eyed Snakes' brand of ""blues"" is just as informed by the energy and ethos of punk and garage rock as it is by the infamous Delta triumvirate of God/whiskey/women. And while blues-meets-punk is exceptionally well-tread ground in 2003 (see: Jon Spencer, Black Keys, etc.), the Snakes' brew tends to skew a bit dirtier, incorporating a backwards folk ambiance that's less reminiscent of The White Stripes than Califone: check ""Soggy"" Tim Rutili manning the slide on three tracks, or notice how the deft maraca opening of ""Hillside Stomp"" makes you think Brian Deck is lurking in the back of the room. There's also the issue of Sparhawk's alter-ego: If the experience of listening to Low approximates the aching sublimity of freezing to death, spinning the Black-Eyed Snakes is akin to bursting into flame. Sparhawk's vocals-- so peaceably docile when tumbling along with Low-- are painfully distorted here, and their new, dressed-up gurgle is deliberately misleading, much like Sparhawk's nickname; Sparhawk seems intent on keeping his respective projects wholly distinct (coyly cloaking both his real name and his real pipes), preemptively striking out at anyone eager to accuse him of wild Dr. Jeckylisms. Consequently, the Black-Eyed Snakes and Low remain superficially incomparable. Still, both employ an impressive sense of emancipation, of classic build-and-release structure, always see-sawing between the unlistenable and the sublime. ""Rise Up!"" opens the record with an exclamation-pointed promise of insurgence, and promptly offers an appropriate soundtrack: unpolished, heavily distorted, and teeth-gnashing fierce, the track boasts plenty of lustful guitar solos and thick-headed bass drum pumping. ""Cornbread"" tumbles from uncontrolled, freewheeling riffs into a drunken ""Devil's in the cornbread, cornbread"" breakdown, complete with handclaps and multi-voiced chanting, while a cover of ""Bo Diddley"" references its namesake in both riff and force (Sparhawk's hollers of ""Hey Bo Diddley/ Said hey, Bo Biddley!"" form an oddly convincing incantations), eventually easing in some perfectly unexpected congas. The Black-Eyed Snakes' version of the blues isn't always especially credible, but their evocation can still be transcendent: there are flashes of red on Rise Up! that are just fiery enough to manipulate listeners into instantly inking their own deals with the devil, even if it's just for the thrill of the burn.","There's something stupidly redundant about dubbing a record ""blues-based rock and roll,"" given rock's excruciatingly well-documented rural roots ...

The Instinct,Denali,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b962c0084474cd0c25d3/1:1/w_160/623dc3ec.jpg,2003-10-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2277-the-instinct/,Jade Tree,"Denali wisely journeyed beyond the dusted Southern geography of their home state when choosing an appellation. By referencing the Alaskan hinterland, the Richmond, Virginia quartet connects itself to 6,000,000+ acres of Denali National Park, a sub-arctic ecosystem that includes Mount McKinley along with a bunch of frostbitten grizzly bears. Like listening to the earliest Codeine while mired in a snowstorm, this vast chunk of ice, mountains, and large mammals is the apt environmental backdrop for the nine dramatically sweeping songs on The Instinct, Denali's follow-up to their self-titled debut. In spite of these references to cold things, Denali are most addictive when gritting their collective teeth and churning out a tapestry of jarring guitars, heavy bass, complex percussion rhythms, and synthesizer harmonics. The lynchpin operatic ballast of guitarist and keyboardist Maura Davis remains the critical focus, but her band solidly provides an ideal cushion for a vocal style that could grow obnoxious within a more staid or less fitting context. Evoking a cleaner PJ Harvey with zero Galas bluster (is that a female Thom Yorke? A 4AD diva?), Davis hits the high notes and tackles her vocal lines with aplomb. While her voice is impressive, she doesn't have much of a story to tell. This works well enough if she's taken as another instrument in the dense sonic squall, but once the lyric sheet comes out of hiding, well, uh, um. Including a fair share of these revved-up glacial formations, The Instinct shows a promising turn towards heavier, denser slices of chamber-rock. Davis's older brother, bassist/keyboardist Keeley Davis, is in Engine Down with drummer Jonathan Fuller, who earlier played in old-school chaos makers Sleepytime Trio. Rounding out the lineup is journeyman guitarist Cam DiNunzio of Four Walls Falling and a dozen other east coast floor-punching acts. With these guys in tow, a certain heaviness lurks within the trip-hop: tracks like ""Hold Your Breath"" and ""Surface"" initiate insouciant percussive breaks and rock-up dynamics similar to the work of Girls Against Boys or old timey London-based Touch & Go heavies, Silverfish (""Hips Tits Lips Power!""). ""Surface"", meanwhile, fixates around a stealthy bassline, dual-channel percussion separations, and a multi-layered careening guitar: during the final distorted vocal exchange, Davis' not especially interesting lyrics come off like holy writ because of where they're placed in the mix. To his credit, Peter Katis, who recorded other frosted bands like Interpol and Mercury Rev, sustains this well-chosen lushness for the album's duration, creating a site in which dappled arpeggios and aquatic notes pulse and flow three-dimensionally. When forging ahead with pretty disjunctions, Denali offer a solid take on a less traversed genre; as the band nods-off to dumbed-down Portishead-styled atmospherics, the propulsion dissipates. Bits like ""Run Through"", ""Nullaby"", and ""Welcome"" could make for fair-to-decent background music, but each lacks the payoff of the other work. Despite the production and sonic sweep, this is a standard rock band working within an oft-stated, faux-experimental dream-pop realm. For actual extended grooves and smacked-out excursions, I'd rather tap the epic drones of the Kompakt roster, Ellen Allien, or maybe just record the wind at Mount McKinley and see if it sounds at all like I think it would.","Denali wisely journeyed beyond the dusted Southern geography of their home state when choosing an appellation.

Deja Entendu,Brand New,by: Noah Sutcliffe,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43eea9e61561daa4e6f/1:1/w_160/3902cc02.jpg,2003-10-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1090-deja-entendu/,Razor & Tie,"Old adages and young women agree that things grow better with age, but a legion of late-90s rock bands stand as evidence to the contrary. Supergroups like Jets to Brazil and The Promise Ring rose to prominence as some of the last worthwhile pop bands of the decade, only to become the first great disappointments of the new millennium. One heard whispers of a confused direction, and perhaps even (in TPR's case) a confused sexual orientation. Either way, The Promise Ring went out with a sigh, and the odds of another good Jets to Brazil album are about as good as that dodo on the cover of Four-Cornered Night coming to life in your living room and shitting all over Electric Pink. Enter Brand New, whose first album was the effective sum of Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional. You guessed it: LIES. LIES stands for L.ong I.sland E.mo with S.creams-- think Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, and any other group of emo-dandies that prance delicately through candylands of Orange Rhyming Dictionaries, New Nathan Detroits and Bells, Bells, Bells. But S.O.S! Very Emergency! Brand New's new album for Razor and Tie, Deja Entendu, is produced by Stephen Haigler, engineer of the Pixies' Trompe le Monde. This and the album's postmodern cover art hint at something more substantial than 2001's Your Favorite Weapon. While it was surely a treat for ninth and tenth-graders chomping at the bit for ""Jude Law and a Semester Abroad"", Brand New's debut did little for anyone with an interest in instrumentation or variety; it also had a bad case of self-consciousness, with singer Jesse Lacey spending more time thinking up crazy song titles than anyone in the band (himself included) spent on actual songcraft. But Deja Entendu, while a football field short of groundbreaking, has an air of substance and maturity that, at its peaks, makes me forget a little of how Jade Tree once jaded me. Deja Entendu comes complete with its own share of ridiculous track names-- a few of which are funny if you can fit your tongue next to that lollipop in your cheek. The opener, ""Tautou"", isn't the album's strongest, but it's significant in that it introduces the band's new sound with just over a minute of minimalist guitar arpeggio and sombre vocals. Things pick up quickly with ""Sic Transit Gloria..."", as Lacey's layered whispering over the bass-driven verse breaks violently into an overdriven chorus. In come harmonic shrieks and screams which fall in bassy stair-steps back to the verse. This song rocks but it makes me wonder: Why would a band like this tour with Dashboard Confessional? To score chicks? ""Okay, I Believe You But My Tommygun Don't"" gives Brand New's formula away, but as the song progresses there are flashes of wit and maturity, even humor. Lacey scoffs at the narcissistic pretentiousness of the emo scene with lines like, ""These are the words you wish you wrote down/ This is the way you wish your voice sounds/ Handsome and smart/ My tongue's the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart."" As long as it stubbornly refuses to roll over and die, emo should at least develop this sense of humor. It could have come off a backpacker hip-hop record if it weren't pulled off with such searing sarcasm. ""The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"" is trite enough for radio play, which is frustrating as it opens promisingly. Unfortunately, though, LIES overcome the band and the song mutates into an aberrant hybrid of Jimmy Eat World and The Used. This burn is thankfully extinguished in favor of a Smiths-y ballad, ""The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot"". ""Jaws Theme Swimming"" is cool and controlled enough to be crafty, but ""Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis"" is flat-out indulgent. Fortunately, for the subsequent 3:25 seconds, ""Guernica"" will make you forgive and forget. It's a brilliant lament about the horrors of cancer that manages both desperation and confidence. Still, at the end of the day, we're left with just an EP's worth of decent songs and a spark of interest where formerly there might've been a laugh of disgust. Stephen Haigler may have aided Brand New in discovering a more mature approach to recording, but as far as breaking new ground, the album's title says it all.","Old adages and young women agree that things grow better with age, but a legion of late-90s rock bands stand ...

Forged Prescriptions,Spacemen 3,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6465e6ef95969320cca/1:1/w_160/2109addb.jpg,2003-10-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7720-forged-prescriptions/,United States Distribution,"Fifteen years ago, kids didn't listen to this kind of music on CD, cassette, vinyl; they listened to it on the tips of their tongues. It used to come on blotter paper, in tabs. When string-seducer Sonic Boom went into his Rainbow Guitarland of Doom, people's serotonin levels never recovered. The Perfect Prescription was like taking an acid bath in the dungeon of the mind: revelatory but solitary. On Forged Prescriptions, the Spacemen are trying to absorb us into their skin. This two-disc release consists of various alternative mixes, demos, and covers from Spacemen 3's Perfect Prescription recording sessions. According to the Boom, the majority of these mixes were ""considered by us to be too hard to replicate live and therefore reduced for the original release."" This is admittedly kind of absurd, like saying these tracks were too good to be listened to, but there is some validity in the sentiment. Whereas the disparity between the old and ""new"" mixes are perhaps subtle at best and practically indiscernible at worst, there is a difference in mood. If The Perfect Prescription often sounded extraterrestrial, it also just as often sounded like traditional Velvets-inspired indie rock. On Forged Prescriptions, though, the stratifications of guitar are even further attenuated to stunning single tones, the basslines float even more subliminally under the psychedelic mind-spinning noodling, and... well, okay, the drums are pretty much the same. The gateway drug on this collection is the alternative mix to ""Things'll Never Be the Same"". If the original was a feedback dust-up, quenched in gravelly, occasionally Bob Mould-ish vocals and an abyssal thump, the new mix is so bombarded with combating guitar squeals, earthen drums, and Pierce's sustained tones it will excoriate your entire body. From the classic intro onwards, the guitars are played backwards, forwards, sidewards, epiphanywards. The original was phenomenal strutting feedback stagnating in the void. This is a twirling tea kettle launched into orbit, feedback that goes somewhere, at a pressure that gives you the bends. By ""Call the Doctor"", the guitars are spewing their trajectories of cosmic refulgence farther than the ears can grasp. At one point, I accompanied this euphony with the ""Rolling Fire"" setting on Windows Media Player and my computer restarted itself. Truth. The new ""Walking with Jesus"" is perhaps the most startling mix, taking the original into an even more incorporeal and immaculate sphere. The Perfect Prescription version used too many 80s-indie-rock guitars for my liking, and vaguely sardonic; this one is an anesthetic plunge into purgatory, equipped with a choir instead of rock 'n' roll, and it's positively cultish-- the anthem of a Polyphonic Spree crossed with Heaven's Gate. ""Come Down Easy (Demo Version)"" is a filthy atomic 100-bar blues, oscillating echoes of birdman Pierce, our acidhead savior. You will bow down to him for his beatific benevolence and serenity. Except in this religion, the communion wafers are shrooms, the crucifix is the solar system, and the holy book is my hallucinations about Toad Demons: ""It's 1987/ All I wanna do is get stoned."" But the second disc is the one that truly breathes new life into Perfect Prescription. The extended version of the Red Krayola cover ""Transparent Radiation"" replaces the angry muddle of the album version with light and clarity. The demo version of ""Walking with Jesus"" is when the Son of God bought a shotgun, rockin' twine and fuzz battered by shivering engines. The demo version of the heralded ""Starship"" and the previously unreleased cover of the MC5's ""I Want You Right Now"" are bone-implodingly dense, perfect tributes to 60s psych-metal, plasma ghosts emerging from Sabbath's grave. To get pragmatic for a second (a little silly considering the only word this band knows is ""excess""), the differences between these tracks and their album version counterparts can seem innocuous enough if you're not listening closely. Purists who've spent years memorizing every note of The Perfect Prescription are sure to think of it as little more than a curiosity. Many of the mixes here, however, are more complex, harmonious and pulverizing than those on the original classic. The second disc also acts as a sort of paltry best-of that combines some excellent covers with the most memorable songs from the original LP. As for those neophytes who ask if this album's any good if you're not on drugs, a better question might be whether drugs are any good without this album.","Fifteen years ago, kids didn't listen to this kind of music on CD, cassette, vinyl; they listened to it ...

In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003,R.E.M.,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2519d034d5c69bf2b86/1:1/w_160/072521ad.jpg,2003-10-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6751-in-time-the-best-of-rem-1988-2003/,Warner Bros.,"The main peril of writing about R.E.M. is that otherwise rational people tend to form torturously private relationships with this band. I am one of them. As with any long-term engagement, there's a back catalog of injury: some of us felt slighted by R.E.M.'s eager dash to the big leagues; some can't get over ""Shiny Happy People""; still others considered the band officially defunct when Bill Berry quit (consider, for a moment, the integrity of a band that makes a drummer's departure seem catastrophic). But now comes the ultimate challenge: helplessly watching R.E.M. sink into the classic-rock Lethe. The symptoms came on fast: ""The One I Love"" gets a round of Clear Channel airplay on the flashback circuit, and the next thing you know there's a greatest hits package out there whose chronology begins with the band's seventh record. They're old. We're old. The upside is that I'm less likely to receive any mail telling me SUCK IT YOU PIECE OF SHIT REM R0X0RZ. Questionable though it may be for these paragons of rock rectitude to milk the vile ""two new songs"" format for their latter-day hits collection, *In Time, in its own safe way, logically picks up where * Eponymous left off. So discuss the lopsided sequence and the strange curatorial choices (""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"" but no ""Drive""?), but let's not forget that R.E.M.'s best tracks come pretty close to the pinnacle of what one can do with a riff, a verse and a chorus. The obligatory Two New Songs included here are actually a song and a half: ""Bad Day"" spent about 15 years as a half-completed B-side famous for carrying the germ of ""It's the End of the World As We Know It"". The lyrics are new-- angry and direct-- but you can still scream ""I feel fine"" over the chorus, which has retained the original chord progression. ""Animal"", the other new track, is one of those vaguely Middle Eastern stomps that Buck's Rickenbacker occasionally throws up (see also: ""I Could Turn You Inside Out"", ""You""), and has a great singalong hook, with Stipe gleefully yelping ""What's the big deal?"" as the harmony slides into a minor key. It would have been right at home on R.E.M.'s most substantive 90s offering, New Adventures in Hi-Fi. As something of a commercial non-starter, Adventures is represented here by only two tracks: ""E-Bow the Letter"" and the cutie-pie ""Electrolite"" (whose space might have been more deserved by ""Bittersweet Me""). Monster is, wisely, all but erased from the band's discography-- only ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" made the cut (although sadly not the live Letterman version with vocals by Dan Rather). Up, the band's first album as a trio, is correctly represented by the majestic waltz ""Daysleeper"" and ""At My Most Beautiful"", which marks the start of R.E.M.'s current Brian Wilson fixation. The inclusion of ""All the Right Friends"", off the Vanilla Sky soundtrack, severely stretches the definition of the word ""hit,"" but the song (written in 1979) is baggage-free fun that deserves another shot. Of course, Automatic for the People is the clear winner here, at least by Warner's standards: this disc includes no less than four of its songs, which should make you feel pretty stupid if you a) own it, or b) don't. The bonus disc on the album's pricier edition promises ""rarities and B-sides,"" but don't get your hopes up; it's long on live performances of hits and short on the kind of drunken studio fuckery that made Dead Letter Office such a blast. The highlights here are a fantastic trip-hop version of ""Leave"" (less a remix than a rescue operation, really), and a spare demo of Reveal's ""The Lifting"" that shows the precise moment at which the producers should have stopped fiddling with the material. There is one very welcome Dead Letter Office-esque track, though: ""Star Me Kitten"" narrated by W.S. Burroughs in a series of depraved howls. And there you have it: a great album that you probably already own piecemeal, impossible to pan but even harder to endorse. In Time will make a handy proselytizing tool for weaning your niece off Matchbox 20. To you, it's an unintentional reminder that R.E.M. are a classic and still-relevant band not because of, but in spite of, their commercial success.","The main peril of writing about R.E.M. is that otherwise rational people tend to form torturously private relationships ...

Sing Me a Song,Hurricane Lamps,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14beb335119a49ed534/1:1/w_160/564f0af8.jpg,2003-10-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3968-sing-me-a-song/,Sonic Boomerang,"About twice a year, sometimes more, I convince myself that indie rock is just deathly boring stuff that I'm no longer interested in. And right on cue, there always seems to be a record waiting for me that wins me back-- at least for a few months. By ""indie rock,"" I mean that bread-and-butter, classic formula that got you through high school or college or whatever other phase of your life during which you were obsessed with it: that old, reliable guitars/bass/drums setup with less-than-crystalline production and superchunks of memory-forming melody. Lots of albums full of this stuff still see release every year, but it's a lamentable fact that the vast majority of them lack any melody factor working in their favor, be it for want of a distinctive vocalist or a simple lack of compositional imagination. Over the years, I've heard too many of those albums to count, but it all feels worth it when you come across a record that really hits and makes the formula feel fresh again. Sing Me a Song, the fourth full-length by Washington, DC's Hurricane Lamps is one of those albums. The Lamps get more confident with each album they make, and on Sing Me a Song, they let their punk edge drop to reveal their pop heart more than ever, and the result is an adeptness at catching melodic lightning in a bottle and turning a phrase on a dime. More importantly-- and this is what separates an album like this from the masses around it-- the band also has a knack for arrangements that feel just as substantive as the songs they support. Rhythm guitarist Greg Bennett drops walking basslines while the band varies the rhythms and feels to better highlight the melody. If the devil's in the details, they've got him pretty much slain. The album lifts off slowly with the controlled burst of ""Listen"", with guitarist/vocalist Eric Tischler lying breathy harmonies over a thumping rhythm and phosphorescent guitar. ""Turn Me On"" is a blast of high-octane pop built around an exultant shouted chorus. Tischler's voice is a weirdly ingratiating tenor that muppets out completely when he really lets go (one of the few things I can foresee causing problems for more touchy listeners). He also speaks plenty through his axe, tossing off some pretty decent guitar solos, particularly on ""Dive"", where he lets himself just wail for a couple of seconds before the band closes out the song. Blessedly, though, he refrains from ever overdoing it-- only once does a whole song even top four minutes, much less a solo. Tischler also gets off a few good lyrical volleys on ""Dive"", including these parting words from an estranged lover: ""She said, 'Leaving's all I'm ever good for/ And leaving's all that's good for me/ 'Cause leaving's always there when you want it/ And leaving's where I want to be.'"" Elsewhere, he helps keep the nerdish personal armor of the underground intact, imploring ""don't confuse me"" on the pop rollercoaster of ""For a Good Time..."" and serving up lines like, ""I saw you cringe behind your politesse,"" without so much as a smirk on ""Judge You All Night"". Sing Me a Song is a fine entry point into The Hurricane Lamps' catalog, though I have a hard time choosing between it and 2001's slightly rougher Tilting at Windmills when deciding which to pop in. Either way, it's a great record that's at least somewhat restored my faith in the power of indie rock for the time being. I just wonder what will be there to pick me back up the next time I fall off the wagon.","About twice a year, sometimes more, I convince myself that indie rock is just deathly boring stuff that I'm ...

World Series of Love,Midwest Product,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c466c0084474cd0c36a6/1:1/w_160/492fd3ec.jpg,2003-10-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5277-world-series-of-love/,Ghostly,"Growing up in the Detroit area in the 1980s, I had the good fortune to be exposed to the Electrifying Mojo's radio show. For years, the legendary Detroit DJ piloted a mothership that descended on the Motor City with an eclectic cargo that included synth-pop, Kraftwerk, funk, Prince, new wave, and Philly Soul. From time to time, I'd listen to the program late at night, relishing its exoticism and becoming a little more wide-eyed and -eared every time I tuned in. Of course, I didn't realize how unique or rare the show was at the time, and certainly could never have guessed its influence on the Belleville Three and how integral the show would therefore be to the development of techno. The members of Midwest Product-- the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based trio of Ben Mullins (guitars, electronics), Chad Pratt (drums, electronics), and Drew Schmeding (bass, keyboards)-- may have grown up catching snatches of the same sounds and spirit. Mixing electronics and live instrumentation, their second album sounds like my faded memories of the more European portions of those broadcasts-- or at least the way they're pieced together and romanticized in my mind. On World Series of Love, the ghosts of those efficient, hook-filled synth-pop sounds dance with polished, crisp indie pop and experimental guitar as Midwest Product take a lateral step away their excellent, more electronic-based debut, Specifics. On their debut, the band occasionally droned on a bit long; here they leave everything short, trimming song lengths around the five-minute mark and delivering the album's seven tracks in around 30 minutes. The highs may not match either Specifics' ""Still Love in the Midwest"" or ""Laundry"", the highlight of Ghostly International's Idol Tryouts compilation, but the disc makes for a far more consistent listen. The sense of humor displayed on the album's Salinger-aping design and Prince-quoting title is found on both the pulsating yet detached new wave-meets-funk of ""Bank"" and the avant-pop of ""Dead Cat"". Where World Series of Love really hits its stride, however, is as it winds down, with a trio of nuanced, rich tunes that put the joke book back on the shelf. ""Duckpond"" best fuses the band's experimental nature and gift for melody, while the restless ""Motivator""-- fueled by arpeggio guitar and hollow vocals-- best displays the command of dynamics that Midwest Product boasted on their debut. The short, New Order-like ""Umbrella"" brings the record to elegant close. Two albums into their career and Midwest Product's skillful live playing and deft use of electronics have placed them in a fraternity with ambient pop stars such as Markus Acher, Manual, Christian Kleine, and Ulrich Schnauss. However, unlike the best of those, the band has yet to focus in on its strength and fully explore the limits of their songwriting. Instead, they're gleefully moving from one rewarding sound to another, relishing their range and honing their craft with a series of charming winks and nods.","Growing up in the Detroit area in the 1980s, I had the good fortune to be exposed to the Electrifying ...

Bring 'Em In,Mando Diao,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c440c0084474cd0c3650/1:1/w_160/72481f8d.jpg,2003-10-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5557-bring-em-in/,Mute,"It's already been well-established elsewhere in Pitchfork's deep annals that Sweden is neither a land devoted to the frivolous pursuit of happiness, nor a place where people mope in the gloom waiting for Death to challenge them to a game of backgammon. To make such sweeping generalizations about a people as diverse or cold as the Swedes is crass and shortsighted; it betrays a shocking lack of cultural relativism. National temperaments and temperatures aside, though, one thing must by now be certain-- and call this a gross generalization if you must, but: without American Rock and Roll, no Swedish bands would ever have been good at anything. Last-year's models, The Hives, were just the latest in an evolving line of acts hell-bent on stealing some good ol' American thunder, copping a couple vintage licks, and giving them enough gas to make most of our own sleepyheaded retro flag-bearers look limp in comparison. Beaten at our own game! The day an American band can't rip-off The Ramones as well as some clean-shaven, well-dressed foreigners is a sad day indeed. If only they weren't so consistently damn good at it. The latest installment in Sweden's rock 'n' roll clinic comes courtesy of the uniformly modded-out guys in Mando Diao, and they appear to have smash-and-grab routine down as well, if not better, than their forebears. Technically, the origin of Mando Diao's pilfered sonics is probably closer to the likes of The Who, The Kinks, or Creation, but the British Invaders were just taking lessons from Motown, the Blues, and a little Chuck Berry anyway, so it's not like Mando Diao's more than one step removed from our musical ancestors. And besides, no matter how many steps it took to get to their brand of soul-rock pastiche, on Bring 'Em In, their very first album, they absolutely nail it. Organs and tambourines flutter just at the edges of classic, ""My Generation""-sized riffs, tapping into the awesome power of some of the most basic roots of 60s rock and executing it perfectly. They even cultivate an air of being exactly 31% reckless and carefree in said execution-- the ideal, scientifically calculated percentage found to maximize the perception that they're somehow not borrowing shamelessly from their betters. Knowing the ratio will not render you immune. It's to Mando Diao's credit that, as easy as it is to rattle off a litany of easy influences, they come out sounding very much their own entity. The guitar line central to ""Sheepdog"", Bring 'Em In's opening track, wastes no time letting the listener that he or she is indeed about to be rocked into the ground, as immediately recognizable as some of Roger Daltrey's second-tier riffs, but bristling with the pent-up aggression that skipped his generation and went straight to the Heartbreakers. The Kinks' maximum R&B; rock gets a similar treatment: ""Paralyzed"" is descended from the genes of ""Sweet Lady Genevieve"", but trades that song's high-minded instrumental flourishes for a shot of pleasantly low-brow vitality. The album is so casually frantic, in fact, that Mando Diao stumble briefly in transition, at times, from the maniacal bliss-outs like ""Motown Blood"" (check the name in case you think I'm making this stuff up) into slower, more somber moments like ""Mr. Moon"". The deceleration between the two can cause whiplash, and ""Moon"" happens to be the album's weakest moment in and of itself, hampered by some unfortunately severe invocations to ""Mishtah Moo"" (or at least it sounds like it). It's the only instance where Bjorn Dixgard's vocals fail him, though, and in all seriousness, the guy can't help an accent. It's just unlucky that it sounds so momentarily out of place; he then proceeds to channel a hint of James Brown to kick off ""Lady"", and totally redeems that one false move. In general, between Dixgard and Gustaf Noren, who trade vocal duties, these songs are sung with reverence, and sincerity, and passion, to a degree which is truly impressive, and the band's dynamic, classic roots match them at every turn. It's convenient, I guess, to even imagine that this might be a posture, exacerbated by the passing similarity of tracks like ""Sheepdog"" to the leading revivalists on this side of the pond, The Strokes, but it's hard to listen to the entire album and still believe that. It's just not easy to fake the evident enthusiasm here. Mando Diao is stealing our rock 'n' roll thunder, but if we can't produce anyone to offer them some competition, I suppose they're welcome to it.","It's already been well-established elsewhere in Pitchfork's deep annals that Sweden is neither a land devoted to the ...

Chaiming the Knobblessone,Cerberus Shoal,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a576ea9e61561daa513e/1:1/w_160/b48cfbe2.gif,2003-10-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1385-chaiming-the-knobblessone/,North East Indie,"To judge this album is like putting a rating on weirdness, because that's what makes the record compelling-- a surreal head trip best described by Cerberus Shoal themselves: ""Our deepest investigation yet, of all thee swirling symbolisms buried in each our very own psyches', as they clink and clack upon thee others, each and all."" That's right, a personal journey with few clear themes and a lot of resolutely unfiltered lyrics, and no matter how many times you spin it you've got that nagging fear that you're not ""getting it."" And maybe you never will: it ain't your subconscious that belched this up. Chaiming the Knobblessone continues the direction Cerberus Shoal took on their recent split EPs-- for example, the abstract lyrics and obtuse sound collage of ""A Man Who Loved Holes"" (from the Ducks and Drakes of Guapo and Cerberus Shoal), or the intricate poetry and large-scale arrangements of ""Ding"" (from The Vim and Vigour of Alvarius B and Cerberus Shoal). Their wordless improvisations and clear world music influences have shattered, reconfigured and picked up lyrics, culminating in a sprawling album that comes off as some kind of art-damaged radio play. A male lead-- presumably Chriss Sutherland-- sings and recites most of the lyrics, backed by female voices that breast-beat and wail or sing like the chorus at a hippie repertory theater. The content shows a crazy wit as it switches from songs to dialogues: for example, in the mid-album intermission, ""A Paranoid Home Companion"", a futuristic interrogator grills a ""zek"" who has escaped from a communal hivemind. This starts as a sci-fi cliche about individuality versus the collective consciousness, but the Shoal's made-up language and snarky tone bring it to life. And exotic nonsense, holy and profane, drifts through the other epic-length songs-- dig the way ""Story #12 from the Invisible Mountain Archive"" sticks whack-off jokes and Christmas themes into its surreal adventure story. (And if you want to know what the ""remote control brain"" looks like, check out the gorgeous hand-painted liner notes.) The music is an intricate construction, coloring acoustic instruments and trumpet and accordion solos with collaged electronic sounds and grainy samples. Some parts are denser than others-- like the noise pastiche in ""Mrs. Shakespeare's Torso""-- but the work progresses like a typical Cerberus Shoal album, in an even amble that rarely blows into a crescendo. Just as they used to be mislabeled as a post-rock band, you can now lump them on the edge of the free-folk movement, with hints of the acoustic madness that's going on one state over in Vermont. This makes it feel stream-of-consciousness even though the arrangements are serious, the extra quirks-- toy percussion and piano, a choppy Spanish guitar-- woven in with care. There are a few reasons this isn't a masterpiece: some of the sections, like the closer ""Scaly Beast vs. Toy Piano"", run so long that they start to meander; and end-to-end, the seventy-seven minute runtime includes a lot of wandering. But Chaiming the Knobblessone is too big a mess of ideas and imagination to be taut or ""perfect."" What you get is an extraordinary triathlon of the id/ego/superego-- an album that's both crazy and calming, where no idea or image is too far-out to fit. It's another milestone for the always-intriguing Cerberus Shoal.","To judge this album is like putting a rating on weirdness, because that's what makes the record compelling-- a ...

Easy Listening,Cobra Verde,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e05e6ef95969320e44/1:1/w_160/0c4b82b0.jpg,2003-10-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1727-easy-listening/,Muscle Tone,"The dreary, cluttered aura of a Midwestern, two-car, suburban garage hangs heavily over Cleveland-based indie rock quartet Cobra Verde's third full-length, Easy Listening. Listening to this thing, I can see a scene from which the music originally sprung: sleeveless black t's, duck-taped bassdrum, microphone dangling from an overhead light, Stooges and Bowie posters pinned beside Dad's workbench. Since Viva La Muerte was released a little less than ten years ago, Cobra Verde's sound has exuded this type of heavy-handed rock romanticism. Full of thrashing guitars, pulverizing drums and tightly harmonized choruses, their songs mimic the feverish abandon and catchy intensity of the Buzzcocks, The Who and Hüsker Dü, while emulating more literate forebears like The Kinks and MC5. It's an unapologetically hybridized sound that, for a very brief time, seemed on the verge of growing into something new. While some people have characterized Cobra Verde's music as ""bombastic""-- a word that's usually taken to mean ""pompous"" (what I think they actually mean is ""incredibly loud"")-- I tend to think of it more as destructively melodic. The pounding, relentless rhythms are baldly formulaic from song to song, but they have a cumulative effect that, by album's end, leaves nerve-endings satisfyingly rattled and arm hairs standing on end. Depending on your temperament, this can be either a cathartic or disembodying experience, but regardless of how it hits you, Cobra Verde, to their great credit, never stand on ceremony. Each song is skin-and-bones rock: unpretentious, fierce and insolent. Unfortunately, about halfway through the album, the sound wears itself out, as the samey melodies edge towards the too-familiar, like the narrative arc of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, and, I hasten to add, the vocal harmonizing on the choruses borders on the diarrheic. As the album slogs on, the songs seem to become battles of will between the individual musicians, with singer John Petkovic's already toned-down vocals getting pushed largely to the background. The wall-of-sound of guitars and drums loses its frenetic, ardent profundity, and instead sounds merely like ornament to a lazily crafted song. Despite these shortcomings, Easy Listening does showcase its share of surprises. A memorable one comes during ""Til Sunrise"", where Petkovic's bleak, understated lyrics coalesce with the scratchy riffs from Frank Vazzano's guitar and Mark Klein's heavy-metal drumming into a luminous, Bob Mould-worthy hook. In a song that radiates a less-than-happy feeling, Petkovic wails, ""Everything looks beautiful/ With blurry eyes.../ You're not you/ I'm not me/ We're as good as we can be."" ""To Your Pretty Face"" has a catchy, almost country rhythm, until a 60s psych-rock organ creeps in on the chorus and the track shifts gears into a Jefferson Airplane-meets-Sparklehorse mindfuck. It's one of the better songs on the album, and the one on which Petkovic manages finally to get his voice out in front of the crashing cymbals and guitars. On ""My Name is Nobody"", the drums again take precedence and Petkovic struggles to make himself heard. But make no mistake, he is there, singing morosely, ""By the time I got to Phoenix/ I was halfway to hell."" The hauntingly textured ""Throw It Away"" is a nod to Irish drinking ballads. One can almost see Petkovic, equipped with tweed jacket and gravy-stained suspenders, toasting a long-gone bonny lass: ""Drink to what isn't here/ Raise a glass to the dead and gone."" Cobra Verde has largely shirked the exposure of their Guided by Voices affiliation and publicity-obsessed peers. They remain in Cleveland, where the various members teach, write, run a recording studio and practice juggling on the side. Petkovic said in an interview recently, ""I have another job and I am reconciled to the fact that, whether [the record] sells or not, I'm just going to have fun."" This is a refreshing departure from the self-satisfied ballyhoo typical of rockstars. If he ever changes his mind, though, I have a pretty good feeling that Cobra Verde could hit it big in New York.","The dreary, cluttered aura of a Midwestern, two-car, suburban garage hangs heavily over Cleveland-based\n\ indie rock quartet Cobra Verde ...

Later That Day,Lyrics Born,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbfea9e61561daa7785/1:1/w_160/2701ccd1.jpg,2003-10-27 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4953-later-that-day/,Quannum,"Having begun his career in close proximity to Blackalicious and DJ Shadow, dropped countless killer guest verses on records by Lifesavas, Tommy Guerrero, and Poets of Rhythm, and blazing Blackalicious' underrated full-length, it's hardly surprising that high expectations would surround the solo debut from the lower voice of Latyrx. What is surprising is that he's delivered as hoped: Later That Day shows him stepping out as the freshest driving force behind the less-than-vocal Quannum collective. The most important thing about this record is to realize that Lyrics Born's greatest strength lies in the power of his voice. Along the lines of Gift of Gab with a smoke-scarred throat, his soulfully, raspy vocals are augmented by rapid cadence changes and an enjoyable cold funk delivery. His subject matter touches upon mostly pedestrian concepts, from anxiety towards tax collectors and neglectful parents (""Stop Complaining"") to his tribulations within various friendships (""Before and After"") to his discontent with the mediocrity of his opponents (""Pack Up""). He handles these topics with a mix of crisp raps and addictive singsong hooks that works on both levels attempted, while still seeming genuine within the everyman role. But none of these tracks hold the emotional severity of the hammerhead mid-album chanter ""The Last Trumpet"" with partner-in-crime Lateef The Truth Speaker. A thinly veiled 9/11 response at face value, the song thrives chiefly on the ridiculous chemistry between Latyrx. Riding a barebones drum loop with rolling bass stabs and an orchestral hue, the duo trades off lines, with Lyrics Born detailing that the ""the harvest has no worth"" while Lateef vilifies a society wherein ""the people are the victims, sheep being led about."" The song reaches its apex with the criss-crossing choral ring that tightens around the rhymesayers in question, springing from a call-and-response game against the term ""right now,"" almost paying homage to Van Halen. It all amounts to the kind of positive rap rave-up you'd expect from Latyrx: fast, melodic and as far as you can get from rap without sounding too foreign. The production develops the surprising crux of Later That Day. The aesthetic is clear from the outset: Lyrics Born takes late 70s/early 80s standards and soundscapes, mangles them into rap format and drops a lovely modern veneer over them. From the bouncing guitar and crushing vamp of ""Bad Dreams"" to the cowbell-infused, chopped-up Dawn of the Dead disco of Cut Chemist's ""Do That There"" to the floating Rick James synth and electronic fuzz bass of ""One Session"", Lyrics Born embraces the past without sounding like a tribute album. Although the first solo from Lyrics Born has a dearth of lame skits (""Cold Call"" might feature Gift of Gab, but it's seriously just a four minute phone conversation with a beat that they never utilize) and a couple repetitive throwaway cuts (""Hello"", ""Rise and Shine""), but it still stands as a startling debut from an under-appreciated emcee in a steadily growing label.","Having begun his career in close proximity to Blackalicious and DJ Shadow, dropped countless killer guest verses on records by ...

Autumn Was a Lark,Portastatic,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f6c0084474cd0bfccf/1:1/w_160/42553791.jpg,2003-10-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6419-autumn-was-a-lark/,Merge,"Frontman side projects are notoriously disastrous, but Superchunk's Mac McCaughan is clever enough to consistently pull off Portastatic, his ever-self-modifying alter ego. The guise has long provided him an outlet for his more experimental urges, offering shifting band lineups, quirky narrative devices, and an undemocratic opportunity for him to orchestrate loads of unpredicted blips. McCaughan's latest release, Autumn Was a Lark, was initially conceived as a five-song companion EP to Portastatic's last full-length, April's Summer of the Shark, but has since been plumped up to include no less than nine live-and-acoustic ""bonus tracks."" The result is a jumble of seemingly arbitrary Portastatic tracks: some are new, some are old, some were recorded on-air at college stations, some are covers, and some are just weird (e.g. the desperate early-morning voicemail left on McCaughan's machine). Rounded out by a handful of tour-tested covers (Badfinger's ""Baby Blue"", Ronnie Lane's ""One for the Road"", and two Springsteen tracks, ""Bobby Jean"" from Born in the USA and Asbury Park's ""Growin' Up"") alongside a full-band version of Summer of the Shark's subdued ""In the Lines"", Autumn ultimately sports only one brand new Portastatic song: the surprisingly raucous ""Autumn Got Dark"". Swallowed whole, Autumn Was a Lark can seem sonically disjointed, but it's also an apt representation of Portastatic's ever-roaming muse: the first five tracks see McCaughan ably backed by his touring band (which includes Aaron Oliva on bass and brother Matt on drums and vocals, plus a few guest players), while the closing set has McCaughan accompanied only by his own acoustic guitar strums (which may explain his insistence that this half of the record be called a ""bonus""). The division is necessary: based solely on Autumn's opening romp, it might seem like the once-evident aesthetic lines separating Superchunk from Portastatic have completely blurred-- gone are the quirky keyboards and string experiments that distinguished early Portastatic records from the more straightforward, guitar-heavy Superchunk-- but taken in the context of the album's latter half, it becomes clear that Portastatic is more about fiddling with all available methods than establishing aural consistency. Opener ""Autumn Got Dark"" hollers back to Summer of the Shark, both lyrically (""So much for the summer of the shark/ Autumn got dark so fast"") and thematically (as the band explains in the album's liner notes, both songs lament ""a place where just when you think the world's fallen apart, you realize that maybe everything's about to get even worse""). With a distorted wallop of a guitar riff, ""Autumn Got Dark"" is an unexpected elegy to September 11th, easily Portastatic's most self-consciously ""rock"" song to date, and a cut that lacks, almost entirely, any explicit traces of melancholia. The results are compelling: chilling in its rowdiness, ""Autumn Got Dark"" reveals the kind of unfettered glee that goes hand-in-hand with having nothing left to lose. The live radio cuts are effectively raw, McCaughan's impassioned caw rising and falling with his whims, and serve as a potent counterpart to the more heavily produced studio tracks (especially ""You Know Where to Find Me"") also available here. The covers are fairly faithful to their originals, and always enthusiastically rendered, if a little underwhelming. Considered in conjunction with Superchunk's latest offering, August's B-sides, singles, and rarities double-disc extravaganza Cup of Sand, it might seem like McCaughan has spent the better part of his late summer and early fall hocking all the crap buried deep inside his closet. Happily, this particular pile of clutter is worth keeping around.","Frontman side projects are notoriously disastrous, but Superchunk's Mac McCaughan is clever enough to consistently pull off Portastatic, his ...

Make Me Pretty,Gentleman Reg,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe9c0084474cd0c30ef/1:1/w_160/51936534.gif,2003-10-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3629-make-me-pretty/,Three Gut,"Reg Vermue is used to being among good company as a member of the theory-tinged queerpop concern The Hidden Cameras. His second solo album finds him fraternizing with Bry Webb, who contributes guitar to two songs on this record, and whose band The Constantines realized the anthem of the year with ""Young Lions"". Nine of this album's songs also feature members of the Kindercore-y Royal City, whose recent plaintive cover of ""Is This It"" is more interesting than the attempts of fellow Stroke-tenders Vitamin C, Detroit Cobras, Ryan Adams, Los Hermanos and Starsailor. Vermue's also found an able backup singer in painter Kit Malo, whose cover-art portrait of a featureless duo glowering at pastries sets up this album's twin tones of androgyny and sickening sweetness. Vermue's stage name harks archly to the dozens of prissy wrestlers who were named Gentleman So-and-so. Though the word has also been cast as a euphemism for high-class homosexuals as well as male prostitutes, it could also simply mean ""gentle man"" in Vermue's case, since his music tests one's tolerance for the upper spectrum of fey wispiness. Nothing about Vermue's outing himself necessarily ghetto-izes his music (though he can sound like the gay-and-proud David McAlmont), because for every lisp, bit of lyrical shorthand, or overt reference to homosexuality, he aims for the universal elegance of hetero softies such as Stuart Murdoch and the late Elliott Smith (""Hard to Speak"" could have been gutted from the midsection of Either/Or). At his best, Vermue's vocals suggest white soul: a funkless Prince here, the most effeminate moments of interchangeable D'Angelos there. Still others will hear less-depressed echoes of the disputed sexuality of Nick Drake (please remember to spare your urinal neighbor the ""Pink Moon"" and ""Fruit Tree"" jokes). In fact, what the listener might initially consider tee-hee-ness is often just a general seductive pose that Vermue's vocals strike, similar to that come-hither quality that makes Vince Vaughn seem gay on the cover of Esquire even though he's surely thinking of last night's acrobatic, girl-stacked, purgatorial sixsome. A tremendous EP is buried inside this album, though I had to own the thing a year before I could sort it out (Vermue admits in interviews that his music requires a ""commitment""). ""Statement"" tiptoes around sexuality's relationship to identity, set to an if-Joan-of-Arc-were-optimistic arrangement. ""Give Me the Chance to Fall"" is a fine melodramatic crooner, complete with ""Brimful of Asha""-style chords and claps that beg the question of why the hell humans beat their hands together to show approval. ""Make Me Pretty"" risks intimating a coy Cat Stevens, but the piano and the confident chorus save it. ""You're So Alone"" bounces on Belle-Sab organ to its omnisexual conclusions. ""Heat"" is a damn fine slow-jam about seasonal modes of coupling, despite its Dawson's Creek aftertaste. ""Bless This Heart"" dips Hank Williams histrionics in Boy George daintitudes, resulting in a genre- and gender-bender on par with Fargo's inversions of maternity and noir authority. ""Anthem for Self-Confidence"" wins with humor, as the speaker insists that he is his intended's destiny, despite his obvious insecurities and disbelief in that whole destiny charade. Pity, then, that the album's six other tracks are a touch precious and adolescently hyper-self-referential. Failing to remember the Creative Writing 101 mandates of Ezra Pound (""make it new"") and Emily Dickinson (""tell it slant""), they sound too much like blog entries, reeking of fraudulent privation. Clarinets can't save their romanticism from Sex and the City superficiality. Reg Vermue has since recorded an anti-war tune (""Bombs in Baghdad""); one wishes that more songs on this album were so unfragile, or were at least as interesting as their author's frosted eyebrows.","Reg Vermue is used to being among good company as a member of the theory-tinged queerpop concern The Hidden Cameras ...

Room on Fire,The Strokes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58c13d1975652138f9e/1:1/w_160/1d3c4271.jpg,2003-10-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7538-room-on-fire/,RCA,"Okay, can someone please remind me why The Strokes were such a polarizing force about two years ago? Listening to Is This It last week had me scratching my head over how it managed to become the Roe vs. Wade of the rock crit world in 2001, with everyone forced to choose sides: ""saviors of rock!"" or ""everything that's wrong with music today!"" At the time, I found myself in the latter category, ironically earning myself a spot on this very staff with a lengthy diatribe against the band's hype machine, socioeconomic background, and rampant influence-pilfering. You know, basically everything but the music. I feel pretty silly about such grandstanding nowadays, having finally listened to, and embraced, at least the show-stopping middle third of The Strokes' debut. But with the release of Room on Fire, both sides of The Great Strokes Debate look a little foolish; NYC's finest have all but given birth to an identical twin. In the interim, a perplexing flirtation with Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich (""you know, 'Last Nite' was just a few lasers away from being perfect!"") was scrapped, and the band's relentless touring failed to lead them down the cockier, arena-rock path some suspected they'd travel. Instead, Room on Fire is eleven songs sharing DNA with its predecessor, a follow-up of more sleepy, contagious mono-pop that doesn't sound diligently recorded so much as yawned out. This is far from a bad thing, largely because The Strokes seem almost pathologically unable to write a song that isn't immediately catchy. Tracks like ""Reptilia"", ""Meet Me in the Bathroom"", and ""Under Control"" take their place alongside the highlights of the band's debut, all hitting that perfect contrast of woozy nonchalance and taut guitar work that appears to be the alpha and omega of their stylistic inventory. That there's nothing new or innovative to be found here is sure to be a common complaint, though only those who prize evolution over knowing one's strengths will cry fraud. Speaking of the originality quotient-- and not to add more historical tinder to the fire of what bands The Strokes supposedly owe a debt to, but-- lead guitarist Nick Valensi is sweating The Pixies' Joey Santiago something fierce here. His development is the only newish detail I can detect on Room on Fire, and it's an inspiration that lends improvement; Santiago's beautifully simple lead lines were The Pixies' secret weapon, and Valensi employs a similar humble style to lend a melodic counterpoint to the proceedings. Whether showing up at the Halloween party as The Cars' keyboard on ""12:51"" or contributing slow-hand solos to ""What Ever Happened?"" and ""You Talk Way Too Much"", it's an extra spritz of tuneship that only assists The Strokes' infectious ways. Of course, Julian Casablancas is a far cry from Frank Black as vocalists go, but it can at least be said that he knows his place through Room on Fire. Wisely avoiding the unbecoming screaminess of subpar Is This It tracks like ""Take It or Leave It"" and ""New York City Cops"", he instead applies a cough syrupy croon to ""Under Control"" and ""The End Is No End"", its bum notes smoothed out by his payphone vocal effect addiction. Casablancas also appears to have moved beyond the smirking misogyny of his early lyrics, just as the cover art is sagely chosen to continue the abstract graphic theme of the Stateside edition of Is This It rather than the Smell the Glove-style UK version. Meanwhile, the rhythm section, the band's Achilles' heel, continues to miraculously scrape by, lending these tracks a vaguely new wave air despite slack-limp playing (hey guys, trade Godrich's number for the DFA's and you might be onto something). Drummer Fabrizio Moretti has always tended to sound a bit like a drum machine, and here his best work happens when he shares the drummer's stool with a sampler-- ""The Way It Is"" and ""Meet Me in the Bathroom"" shuffle with the best technology 1983 had to offer. Bassman Nikolai Fraiture, mostly relegated to backbone status on this outing, carries less of the band's melodic weight than he did on Is This It but gets a front-of-stage moment on the perfectly choreographed breakdown of ""Reptilia"". It remains to be seen whether old white men will continue to trumpet The Strokes as leading the cause of hiphopicide, and if young white idealists will stand firm on the opposite side, regarding the band as the Nike of indie rock (and no doubt fixating their conspiracy theories on Casablancas' sarcastic aside ""keepin' down the underground, oh no!""); what's clear is that The Fab(rizio) Five neither deserve, nor desire, either status-- their goals are about as unpretentious and uncomplicated as possible. They may not be able to get away with milking this formula for many more albums, but for now, Room on Fire's eleven songs find them drowsily getting away with what they do best.","Okay, can someone please remind me why The Strokes were such a polarizing force about two years ago?

The Strangler's Wife,Cul de Sac,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b8ea9e61561daa5418/1:1/w_160/84c7d464.jpg,2003-10-26 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1687-the-stranglers-wife/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Writing about soundtracks is difficult. It's something like what a book critic would face if he reviewed a published screenplay. There's what the work was initially meant to do (a screenplay is a blueprint for a film, a soundtrack lends musical support to the drama), and then there's how you experience it on the consumer end (as a book or CD). When one writes about a soundtrack, the task is to tell the reader how it works as a piece of music. But the band, if they did their job right, created the music to work as part of a film first, and as a record second. So the soundtrack record is by definition an incomplete work of art. The Strangler's Wife is Cul de Sac's first attempt at a film soundtrack, and was written for the low-budget horror flick of the same name. While at work on their latest release, Death of the Sun. the band was approached by Roger Corman's production company about scoring the film, and put their full-length on hold to dive into the project, often improvising live as clips of the film ran in the studio. I haven't seen the film (and probably won't), but the soundtrack to The Strangler's Wife is a worthwhile document that both shows what Cul de Sac does well and reveals the limitations of the soundtrack as record. The first thing to point out is that The Strangler's Wife consists of 18 tracks over 42 minutes. These numbers are notable for Cul de Sac, a band that's never shied away form the epic and extended. In fulfilling their duties as soundtrack composers, many of the tracks are ""cues"" rather than fully realized compositions. Since cues, by definition, are small bits of music meant to convey a single emotional idea and often play during interludes as one scene transitions into the next, half of this record's tracks range from around 30 seconds to just over two minutes, and each pretty much embodies one feeling or mood. Similar in overall sound to Death of the Sun, Cul de Sac here leans away from their former guitar/bass/drums post-rock style toward a more electronically oriented sound. The 90-second ""Frustrated Seduction ('Wash it Off!')"" consists of some electric keyboard chords and drums cut and processed (presumably by the newest Cul de Sac member, turntablist Jake Trussell) to create a sense of anxious uncertainly, while the one-minute following track ""Fifth Victim (Aerobic)"" is pure aural violence, with frenetic drum-n-bass beats drowning in distortion. As befits a horror film, the mood throughout is generally foreboding, with the darkness reaching a pitch during the tracks composed for the murder scenes. That said, Cul de Sac do a nice job fleshing out the film's more reflective moments. Taken together, the album's short tracks are an interesting demonstration of Cul de Sac's range. If you've listened to them for a while, for example, you'll get a kick out of hearing the band that backed Damo Suzuki on tour compose their ultimate Can tribute on ""Tailing the Strangler""-- and certainly the idea of using this ""You Doo Right"" motorik in a chase scene is inspired. But these quickie moods are over so quick that there's a bit of a whiplash effect when listening to the entire record. The constant shifts keep the listener skimming the surface of the music. What redeems The Strangler's Wife as an album is the handful of excellent acoustic guitar instrumentals by Cul de Sac leader Glenn Jones. Despite the quick and improvisational nature of this project, there's nothing half-assed about Jones's melodies. While short, ""That's Great Then, Isn't It?"" brilliantly combines harmonically rich plucked chords with grating scrapes of digital noise. The five-minute ""Mirror II (Mae and Elana)"" is positively gorgeous, as Jones channels the lyricism of the late John Fahey (a former Cul de Sac collaborator) in a duet with violinist Jonathan LaMaster. On this sampler plate of a record, this is the meat, and when I return to The Strangler's Wife soundtrack it will be to cherry pick highlights like ""Mirror II"".","Writing about soundtracks is difficult.

Had I gotten my hands on this disc a few degrees earlier in the year, there's no doubt in my mind this review would have found me impetuously touting the Vells as 2003's Coppertone answer to Oh! Inverted World. And, of course, I'd have been wrong. The six classic pop songs spun here are pure British Invasion by-products (albeit, shipped straight down from Seattle), despite their misleading pedigree. Glossmaster Phil Ek produced and engineered the disc, whose cast also boasts former Modest Mouse drummer Jeremiah Green alongside a host of jewel-eyed indie vets. But perhaps the most salient Shins affinity is the album's undeniable magical enchantment and deftness of touch. For twenty minutes, Tristan Marcum's ether-worldly rising harmonies conspire with shiny melodies and steadily bouncing meters to craft perfectly visceral pop songs. It's clear from the start: These songs are about leaving clear-cut sonic impressions. ""Light on the Right"" and ""Gun for Gun"" feel like sharing a London Christmas with The Kinks in July. The latter rings in with a few bell touches under Ryan Kraft's chiming guitar before craftily deploying a vibraphone to beef up a mid-track breakdown that pulls at your cheeks. ""Blue, Blue Bones"" delivers a jangling Orbison-reminiscent melody with swiftly shuffling rhythms and vintage pop tones. ""In Sunless Seas"", a two-minute-long, comparably dronish affair, adds some edge to the sound, but best serves the record by temporarily breaking its hypnotic spell and highlighting the impact of each singular song, which do flow almost imperceptibly into each other. ""Starlights Our Way"" is as delightfully captivating as anything written this side of the New Pornographers, showcasing the band's ability to pen effortless yet substantive songs. In reaffirmation of the EP's stylistic design, Marcum's lyrics reflect vocal mastery of consonance, assonance, and inflection rather than any calculated message: ""Why-oh-why do skies come tumbling down/ Try we try but there's no wind to be bound/ Mild smiles and days may muddle the wild-eyed."" It's a perfect formula, done with just enough sincerity so as not to come off as flaky and uncommunicative. On the mid-tempo Hammond organ-adorned closer, ""The Very Scary Trees"", Marcum similarly stammers, ""If we can find the peaches in the very peary trees/ I'm on my sha-na-na-na knees."" And it woa-woh-woh-works. The Vells carve out a comfortable, if not wholly unfamiliar niche, but whether their future course will prove stagnant or expansive is uncertain: The question is whether the band needs to keep swimming in future releases in order to keep from sinking, or if a full-length of the same stuff will do. For now, this remains a music for all seasons, past and future, no matter where it came from, or where it intends to go.","Good thing it ain't summer.

Seven's Travels,Atmosphere,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a138c0084474cd0bfd6b/1:1/w_160/eff3b2f5.gif,2003-10-23 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/342-sevens-travels/,Rhymesayers,"Rap, like all genres, thrives on the versatility of its artists, each artist falling into certain niches and expanding within their own perimeters. There are those who rap about rapping, those who ponder the meaning of life, and those who pontificate on the finer points of baseball. In the case of Atmosphere and their newest record, Seven's Travels, one thing is immediately apparent: Slug likes to rap about girls. Though Slug started out as a rapper's rapper on Atmosphere's 1997 debut, Overcast! (then with fellow emcee Spawn), it wasn't until the Slug-centric Lucy Ford EPs that Sean Daley made a pivotal query: Why stress multi-syllabic rhymes and true-school sensibility when you can lazily rap about the same thing on every song, keep your existing fanbase and exponentially increase your stable of groupies? It's worked well for him since-- at least from a short-term careerist standpoint-- but what remains to be seen is how long he can continue successfully milking the formula. From the sound of Seven's Travels, probably not much longer. Here, Slug tries to create the illusion of diverse subject matter by packaging each track differently. Unfortunately, his shallow agenda couldn't be clearer: In personifying an escaped bird as both a girl and a symbol of the American government (""Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know""), dating girls with low self-esteem (""Good Times [Sick Pimpin']""), hitting up girls backstage on tour (""Cats Van Bags""), and trying to get with girls in unconventional places (""Shoes""), Slug plays the role of both the modern misogynist and the sensitive coffee date as a means of appealing to both sexual demographics. It's through this hollow and obvious ploy for universal appreciation that Slug truly lives up to his alias. Occasionally, though, Slug unearths his old cleverness; on ""Cats Van Bags"", he's ""navigating through a basement that masquerades as a nation/ Practicing [his] acetate masturbation,"" and effortlessly dropping elaborate disses: ""there's more said between the lines of your forehead/ Than they could ever try to fine print on the inside of that warhead."" But problems even crop up on the album's highlight, ""Always Coming Back Home to You"". Slug opens the track people-watching, but loses control of the narrative when a nervous kid ditches a gun with him, and he jumps, from out of nowhere, to ""the clouds ran away, opened up the sky/ And one by one, I watched every constellation die."" It doesn't help that he takes the song out singing like a stunted Everlast. The production is a concern, too, since nothing says hit-or-miss better than the words ""produced by Ant."" Ant pulled off a masterful cascade of 70s soul sampling earlier this year with Brother Ali's Shadows on the Sun but very few beats here are on that level. Maybe Slug is to blame for the beat selection, but instead of the smooth loops and hard, clean percussion of the Brother Ali record, we're treated to Ant's trademark abrasive snare drum and urgent, irritating sample chopping. Beats like the lazy drum loop dub of ""Shoes"" and the incredibly lame didgeridoo and whistle show (somewhere, Prince Paul is crying) on ""National Disgrace"" make for a less than magnificent aural experience. Some exceptions stand-- particularly the fuzz-guitar funk/punk seesaw of ""Cats Van Bags"" and the sizzling 70s soul tidal wave of ""Denvemolorado""-- but even then they're on, there's usually something to bring them down: on ""Denvemolorado"", Slug raps for one minute and sings the same refrain for another, destroying what could've stood as one of his best songs. The core problem with Seven's Travels is that Slug seems to have forgotten just what helped him lead his niche to begin with. The subject matter here is repetitive, pseudo-intellectual pandering runs rampant, pointless skits and mid-song dialogue sessions interrupt the flow, and most importantly, wasted beats fall at the hands of Slug's newfound penchant for verse-long tracks and poorly realized singsong bridges. At their worst, Slug's emotionally ""deep"" lyrics threaten Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba for the title of King of the Self-Important Youth. He should seek the conceptual balance of labelmate Brother Ali and rediscover the highly playable discourse of his former incarnation.","Rap, like all genres, thrives on the versatility of its artists, each artist falling into certain niches and expanding within ...

Systems/Layers,Rachel’s,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d8c0084474cd0bfee9/1:1/w_160/91c13354.gif,2003-10-23 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11810-systemslayers/,Quarterstick,"The music made the world feel as if it was moving in slow motion, its every swell and ebb somehow attuned to the constantly scrolling scenery outside. Every blank stare and sleeping passenger seemed accounted for in the violin and piano counterpart, and even the monotonous, anonymous voice announcing ""now approaching... Western... Avenue..."" was invited to become a part of the music. In fact, it almost made the music better. Everyone gets to have a few transcendental moments like this in their life, and mine was made possible by Rachel's, the Louisville collective some might call neo-classical, others might call post-rock, and I would call ambient. Systems/Layers is the band's fifth album, and it's a brilliant ambient musical experience-- you can tune it out if you choose and it'll still enhance your surroundings, or you can engage yourself fully and allow it to positively hypnotize you. I had it running through my big, cheap Koss headphones on Chicago's Metra commuter rail one morning, and it did just that. You might remember a Volkswagen commercial from a few years back where two people driving down a street notice everything synching up with the music they're listening to-- this was like that, only without such obvious signposts as a kickdrum and snare. Though virtually all of Systems/Layers possesses Rachel's characteristic modern chamber ensemble sound, there are dozens of field recordings and sampled voices that seep in around the edges, mostly drawn from source material sent to the band by friends and fans, and they serve to heighten the immediacy of the music and increase its sense of place. Virtually every song here conjures urban streets and dwellings, but each does so with a different set of sources: ""Wouldn't Live Anywhere Else"" takes the more obvious route, melding samples of ice cream trucks, children playing, people mumbling, birds, and sirens with the sparsest of drones, while ""Esperanza"", a gorgeous, entirely organic chamber piece, manages the same with strings and woodwinds. Rachel's cover some new ground here, too, particularly on the strange, percussive ""Reflective Surfaces"", which mimics Gamelan music with its interlocking rhythms and semi-melodic contour. It's odd how well it fits amongst the rest of the songs here, but sure enough, the hypnotic effect of the rhythms draws it together with the chamber pieces. The band's singer/songwriter labelmate Shannon Wright lends her pipes to ""Last Things Last"", a snow-swept dirge built on Grimes' sparse piano and Eve Miller's rich cello sawing. Like any of the other songs on the album, it's impressionistic in intent, and as such, it hangs in the air more like a scent than like music. Fans of Rachel's past work should make a concerted effort to hear this, as it stands easily next to any of their other albums, and depending on your exact mood, just might sound like their best. Beyond those already initiated, Systems/Layers will appeal to just about anybody who likes beautiful sound or enjoys the way great ambient music helps to shape the environment. Rachel's have crafted an album of undeniable power and grace, and if you fall under its spell, you may not want it to end.","The music made the world feel as if it was moving in slow motion, its every swell and ebb somehow ...

Turbo Mattress EP,The Chinese Stars,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6de9d034d5c69bf364c/1:1/w_160/2e0e37ac.jpg,2003-10-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1725-turbo-mattress-ep/,Skin Graft,"The early 1980s bore witness to the infamous ""Chinese Star Epidemic"": somehow, grade schoolers across the country found themselves in abundance of the deadly Asiatic projectile, and, smitten with the anger bug, threw the stars at anyone and everyone within a Trapper Keeper's reach, thereby ""terrorizing the psyche of the free world."" Perhaps you remember attending-- or being responsible for-- your fourth grade history teacher Mr. Colin Jost's untimely funeral. More than likely, of course, you knew neither Mr. Jost nor this epidemic which Providence rockers The Chinese Stars, formed from ex-members of Arab on Radar and Six Finger Satellite, claim as their namesake; the only documentation of either's existence is on the band's website. There legitimately was, in 1980s China, a loose collective of radical artists known as The Chinese Stars, who subverted Mao's demand for political art by breaking from Chinese art tradition entirely, embracing more abstract Western modes, and reclaiming art for art's sake. If this band takes its name from any story, it's clearly this one, and yet, the band makes nary a mention of it. Which begs the question: are these guys fucking with us? Yes, in every respect. Without even touching upon the music, it's clear that The Chinese Stars don't take no shit. Everything from the EP's scarce 14-minute length to the extravagant Chinese-star shape of the disc itself (undoubtedly incurring quite a cost to the modest Skin Graft label) is an enormous middle finger to standard music industry convention and simple cost efficiency. Like their nominal equivalents, The Chinese Stars agree to play by the industry's most basic rules, but beneath this appeasement is the most brilliant and passionate of sedition. Simply put, the Turbo Mattress EP is one of the most enjoyable and accessible fuck-yous from any musical act this year. Turbo Mattress is home to a relentless barrage of dark and energetic disco-punk hooks and grooves reminiscent of Brooklyn's Liars if fronted by a spacy lunatic (spacier than Angus Andrews, I mean). ""Sick Machine"" defines the ""balls-out opener,"" with guitarist Paul Vieira stabbing discordant lines atop drummer Craig Kureck's no-nonsense bashing. Vocalist Eric Paul's quirky high sing/speak, meanwhile, sports all the rhythmic intensity of Hot Hot Heat's Steve Bays or Luke Jenner of The Rapture, infusing the song with convincing urgency when he spouts off such impenetrable gems as ""Don't forget to put that mouth into that pocket so we can maintain the evil of your diet."" The cowbells, spastic drumming, and guitar screams of ""Loose Traffic"" comprise the breakneck velvet backdrop for even more theatrics, and my favorite Providence anti-platitude, ""Your love tastes better with food stamps."" Only twelve minutes have passed by the time The Chinese Stars close with ""The Fastest Horse Yet"", a vaguely bluesy downtempo number about growing up in a glue factory and, fittingly, gambling on horse races. It's here, at their quirkiest, that the band differentiates themselves from other disco-punk acts: while they take part in the scene's signature edginess and angularity, they are also, in contrast, oddly compelling lyricists. It's a sign that this chimerical genre is making progress beyond its simple conflation of two musical traditions. As critics left and right announce the death of rock, this progress is very encouraging.","The early 1980s bore witness to the infamous ""Chinese Star Epidemic"": somehow, grade schoolers across the country found themselves in ...

Twine,Twine,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84eb1335d7bf169924c/1:1/w_160/c42b7f23.jpg,2003-10-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8218-twine/,Ghostly,"You are listening to a record. There's the music, and then there's everything else. The time of day, your mood, the room you're in, the person you're sitting with. Sometimes the ""everything else"" can obscure what's happening with the music, other times it can clarify. In either case, the how and wherefore matter. I knew Twine's self-titled record was good the first time I put it on. It was clear that Greg Malcolm and Chad Mossholder had refined their approach, found what was most interesting about their moody style, and amplified it. But I didn't really hear it until a few weeks later, when hurricane Isabel tore through Richmond in late September and my apartment was without electricity for ten days. The night the storm hit, my wife and I plugged one of my computer speakers into her Walkman radio so we could listen to the news and follow what was happening. Even as a passive transmitter (no batteries for its amp) the speakers made the headphone signal audible as long as we maxxed out the volume. The next evening, after my wife went to bed and as I was reading by the light of a half-dozen candles, I plugged my CD Discman into the speaker and put on new Twine. With the Discman cranked to 10, the music was loud enough to be heard clearly, but having the internal headphone amp at that level imparted a faint halo of distortion. Which, at that moment, was perfect. It was completely dark except for the candles, even outside my window. Every house on the block, the streetlights, the traffic light on the corner-- all were without power. And Twine sounded like they were being beamed in via shortwave from some place halfway around the world. If only everyone could hear this album under those exact conditions (although you might want to skip the following morning's bone-chilling shower in a bathroom so dark you can't see your body to wash it), but it's not necessary. All you really need is for the sun to go down. Twine is a quintessential nighttime record, filled with broken transmissions and drones stretching into the vanishing horizon; it's the kind of night where an edge of paranoia is cut with flashes of comforting solitary bliss. You curl up to this thing. By customary definition, Twine is an IDM act, but the comparisons that stream through my head when I'm listening to this record come from elsewhere. The beats are nothing alike and Twine haven't a lick of hip-hop in them, but I can't help thinking of DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, the way this record uses disembodied voices and builds spacious atmosphere brick by brick. There's also a hint of Stars of the Lid in the drones that Twine favor this time out, and cinematic rock a la Godspeed seems somehow related, although Twine eschew extreme dynamics, and their only conventional instruments are guitar and piano, both of which are treated and looped. Ultimately, though, the thread holding Twine together is the voices. About half the tracks contain wordless vocals by Shelly Gracon and Alison Scola, and their contributions are key. On ""Plectrum"", which is built around slowing strummed guitar, the voice is clipped and percussive, where a word is snatched from meaning mid-syllable and set looping, giving a feel reminiscent of Laurie Anderson. Furthering the modern music references, ""Plectrum"" combines the sharp punctuation with some Tehillim-style sacred howls. In contrast to this art music approach are the ethereal Middle Eastern vocal drones with Taj Mahal reverb that snake through the 12-minute ""Kalea Morning"". There are the live vocals, and then there are the words, pinched and compressed by cheap radio transistors, which crackle in and fade out almost constantly. Adding ""lost transmissions"" to brooding electronic soundscapes is nothing new, obviously, but there's a subtlety to Twine's approach that makes it work. The voices appear and dissolve unexpectedly and the meaning is unclear; what they're actually saying doesn't seem terribly important-- the words are another layer in the dark cloud of sound that drifts slowly across the record. On ""Pendant"" an intercepted telephone conversation (an argument, maybe) is almost completely drowned out by the throb of electronic percussion. The track wouldn't be complete without it. Since forming in 1999, Twine have averaged a record a year, but their albums seem carefully laid out and constructed to work as individual pieces. They're not tossing tracks willy-nilly at every compilation that comes along and then gathering them together as a new CD. Twine has no killer must-hear track, and yet, each piece benefits by its relationship to what came before and what follows. It's an album in the old-fashioned sense of the word, and a damn good one. Try it at midnight first.","You are listening to a record. There's the music, and then there's everything else. The time of day ...

Bazooka Tooth,Aesop Rock,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01e9d034d5c69bf262f/1:1/w_160/204656e7.jpg,2003-10-22 05:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/66-bazooka-tooth/,Definitive Jux,"""Cameras or guns, one of y'all gonna shoot me to death..."" Aesop Rock is having trouble adjusting to fame. Just a few short years ago, Ian Bavitz was still selling his own handmade CD-Rs on the streets of New York, but it didn't take long for him to find his way into the spotlight: his groundbreaking Def Jux album Labor Days was an instant underground smash. Now, in the face of label inconsistency and heightened expectations, his new album, Bazooka Tooth, shows him struggling with the pressures of the media and a rapidly growing fanbase. Aesop Rock's abstract lyricism and gravel throat have earned him critical acclaim and a rabid following, but he's no longer just a Long Island poet-cum-cipher slayer, and some of the changes he's made to his style on Bazooka Tooth are drawing attention. Bavitz spent the early part of his career tied to a sluggish, steady delivery, but here, he's upgraded his style from a nicotine-tinged calm to a more natural, accessible flow. Now attacking his beats with a mix of nervous energy and raw confidence, the new Aesop Rock cracks, lisps, bends his pitch, and most importantly, confronts his listeners rather than choosing to subtly persuade them. His delivery isn't all that's changed; there's been a shift in subject matter, too, as this album sees Bavitz branching out from the singular topic of Labor Days to a variety of subjects, including the emergence of young killers (""Babies with Guns""), fondness for his home state (""N.Y. Electric"", ""No Jumper Cables""), and disillusionment with the media (""Bazooka Tooth"", ""Easy"")-- and all while offering his usual mix of hard-edged rhyme schemes (""Park your bets, sharks or jets/ It's bark marked targets where the barnacles nest"") and clever idioms (""They burrow deep under the carnivore's flesh, without a trace/ Carnival games, like try to shoot the star out of his space""). The track with the most buzz so far is also the one that has the least to do with Aesop's personal life: ""We're Famous"" features Def Jux CEO El-P in what serves as a company mission statement, Demigodz diss, and subterranean ""Grindin'"" response all in one. Cycling through harsh jackhammer synth stabs, toy gun alien abduction crescendos, and a crunk funk handclap-assisted drum line, El-Producto lambasts critics claiming ""hip-hop's over,"" disses Esoteric (""You ain't a vet, you're just old""; ""Some of these faggots used to send me their demos/ Breeding their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels"") and closes the verse with, ""I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap/ I'm making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard."" Aesop doesn't let the topic drop, claiming, ""The revolution will not be apologized for,"" and, ""B-boy, feed that to the needy/ Check your liquor hole, fuck you in 3-D, easy."" The one-two combination makes for one of the most addictive diss tracks this side of Jay-Z's classic ""The Takeover"". Most of the early disappointment regarding Bazooka Tooth came as a result of Aesop's decision to self-produce the record. While the Blockhead and El-P compositions stand out as the work of professional, time-tested beatmakers, Aesop's production style has a loose, raw intensity of electronic emotion that hearkens back to Company Flow and early Tricky. From the windy stadium synth-wave rocker ""No Jumper Cables"" to the city-stomping drum march and twisted gypsy vocal sample pan of ""Frijoles"" to the boogie synth, clanging staircase sample and (in the second movement) Atlanta hi-hat crunch of ""Mars Attacks"", Bavitz evolves from the one-dimensional sample work in which he once dabbled, and makes the step into the realm of mentionable producer. The transition, however, isn't completely smooth, with some of the interludes adding dead weight, a couple of songs failing to stand out among the pack (""Super Fluke"", ""N.Y. Electric""), some unremarkable beats, and a few unrealized conceptual possibilities limiting the total ascension of neo-Rock. Fortunately, the album has more than enough solid material to keep heads coming back again and again. No big surprise: Bazooka Tooth is another strong outing from one of underground hip-hop's most talented, thanks in no small part to its unprecedented wealth of lyrical depth and individual production style.","""Cameras or guns, one of y'all gonna shoot me to death...""

Don't Make Things,The Pleased,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a169ea9e61561daa47c4/1:1/w_160/805b693d.jpg,2003-10-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6528-dont-make-things/,Big Wheel Recreation,"After years of eschewing any label support, San Francisco five-piece The Pleased have finally settled down: now inked to Los Angeles-based indie Big Wheel Recreation, the band have released Don't Make Things, a strikingly uneasy collection of songs that reflect, almost perfectly, the band's apparent distrust of the future. The Pleased can be a surprisingly dark outfit, considering how many of these songs sound, at first listen, like perfectly danceable new-new-wave hits. A few additional spins, however, promptly reveal Don't Make Things as a record teeming with the threat of impending explosion: the album plays like a thick, vaguely melancholy exaltation of right now, wherein all glee is fleeting, tempered by a far grimmer appraisal of tomorrow. The Pleased's brand of joy is hinged, inextricably, on the notion that shit's gonna fall apart, and soon. As opener ""Already Gone"" posits, ""I know it looked so nice in the evening/ But now that the sun's up again/ We're better off alone."" The resulting work is palpably tense, with dodgy guitar, soulful vocals, and plenty of detached urban cool. Before you start conjuring images of Interpol, know this: at least superficially, The Pleased seem to take a lot of same sonic cues as Coldplay (both bands have made careers out of channeling the moody theatrics of the Bunnymen, and vocalist Noah Georgeson's sweet, undulating howl is easily comparable to Chris Martin's round yelps). Still, The Pleased are far less earnest crusaders, avoiding Coldplay's open sentimentality in favor of sneaky whispering-- a trade which may be tied into their instrument choices: check the shifty keyboards sliding in where Coldplay's precious piano might have gone. Ultimately, The Pleased end up being more accurately aligned with tourmates The Walkmen, and it's not surprising that the band are so often mistaken as members of the recent New York City influx-- they've got quite a bit of slink in their gait. Vocalists Georgeson and Rich Good routinely trade mic duties, and the haunting, bass-heavy ""No Style"" sees them engaged in an especially compelling battle of wits, their call-and-response bellows skewing slightly confrontational. ""We are the Doctor"" is a rich, sprawling guitar-rock song, reminiscent of The Bends-era Radiohead, while the album's title track (aside from hosting the remarkably cutting couplet, ""You don't try but I know why/ You don't make things"") is a taut jab, with mixed-down vocals and loads of jumpy percussion. The Pleased are obviously convinced of their own righteousness, and appropriately so-- Don't Make Things is an impressive offering, full of well-realized moments of panic and resignation. Be glad they make things.","After years of eschewing any label support, San Francisco five-piece The Pleased have finally settled down: now inked to Los ...

While trying to absorb the background information for Down for Whatever, a collection of run-of-the-mill garage-rock anthems by San Francisco's Vue, I came upon keyboardist Jessica Ann Graves' mention of one of William T. Vollmann's briefer novels, Whores for Gloria, in relation to the album's closer, ""The Rest"". Tantalizingly, she suggests Vollmann's scrubby evocation of San Francisco's Tenderloin district as a possible inspiration for the dopey song's lyrics. Why? Because she leant the book to vocalist Rex John Shelverton and, well, he read it. With this in mind, I decided to investigate the band's retro schtick more thoroughly, because hey, while the music itself made me roll my eyes and sigh, perhaps the language of the libretto reaches greater heights. If only. Though it's admittedly pretty difficult deciphering all the banality over the ""blistering"" harmonica, it seems likely that The Animals or Rolling Stones had a bigger influence on Shelverton's raucous approach to white-boy blues than Vollmann's dissection of traumatic desire. With a boring EP on GSL and two similarly dull albums on Sub Pop, Vue haven't changed things up much for their RCA debut. Lacking the hooks or pop sensibility of labelmates The Strokes, the quintet is an undistinguished yawn with semi-expensive haircuts. (Maybe they should've mentioned Jackie Collins in the press kit?) At this point, you'd figure a baker's dozen of Hives sound-alikes would be enough, right? Nope: Down for Whatever proudly stands up and asks the listener to accept yet another. Dribbling out of the gate with ""She's Sweet"", an ""energetic"" three-minute pop song that could just as easily have been written by any other post-Estrus band haunting sartorial-linked labels like Dim Mak or Sympathy for the Record Industry, the comfy sameness of the attack continues for the album's remaining eleven tracks. In fact, the band never once steps outside the genre's most watered-down tropes-- not even to go to the bathroom. To be fair, if you enjoy the other examples of this pre-fab genre, then I'm sure the Vue ransack the checklist adequately: the catchy ""Look Out for Traffic"" is the most Is This It of the batch, while the title track harnesses a snarky rock 'n' roll rebelliousness built on fuzzed-out braggadocio (""'Cause I'm down for whatevaaaah feels bad!""), and a wee smidgen of romantic new-wave seeps-in during ""Take Two Kisses"". Thinking optimistically, as I'm wont to do, maybe the random mention of Vollmann will turn a bookish rocker kid onto one of America's most idiosyncratic and ambitious writers. If that's the case, Down for Whatever will prove a valuable tool, richer in use value than its lackluster merits would otherwise suggest. While a hack-job rarely adds up to much once the label's money's gone and a new trend lodges itself in the mind of tireless hipsters, Vollmann's repeatedly beautiful dissection of commerce, colonialism, and love should survive. And, yeah, he's so much more punk rock than these cats, regardless of his unintentionally geeky glasses and 5th-grade bowl haircut.","If name-dropped correctly a little literature can go a long way.

Though my jaw dropped along with Millions Now Living Will Never Die, though I've exfoliated triumphantly in a clawfoot tub to Don Cab's American Don, and though the post-hardcore fusion of Guinness-world-record hopefuls Hella astounds me, I can barely bring myself to spend money on the stuff, which makes being a promo-entitled critic pretty bitchin'. If you can't admit that a large proportion of vocal-less CDs wallow in Louisville/Chicago plodnamics, then you must live in a library or a sex lounge. Which is, of course, a way of saying that these albums best befit either studying or, as PG movies in the 80s would say, the making of whoopee.

Their sound is as urbane as it is provincial, equal parts Fennesz and Jay Farrar's score for The Slaughter Rule. I'd normally flinch at how Bexar Bexar hints rather than goads, falling in line with instru-pop's creed of circuitousness, but they are the rare act that pulls off being scions of Mick Turner pedal-flexing and Martin Gore echo-sonics, and so subtly that they make Calexico's vocal-less numbers seem Limp Biskitesque. ""Aidos"" forges a gorgeous Frankensong out of laptoppery and sentimental guitar, suggesting a sublimi-core U2. Any rookie Ghostbuster could detect Jeff Tweedy's desire to strum over the blip-loops and hesitant piano of ""Where She Lives Every Day"". The Flintstones percussion of ""Esther's Vice"" entrances the listener as the plucking rises and fades in the mix, silencing anyone whose previous position on instru-pop was ""Hey mang, wake me when Cerberus Shoal is finished."" Full truth-in-advertising legislation would require that Bexar Bexar label their disc with a warning that it might take people back to that one particular adolescent autumn when sports seemed spiritual and the prom seemed like performance art. Their whittled sound is a Battlefield:Earth between synthesizers and six-strings in which no winner is declared. Only their late-blooming, pokier compositions lend credence to the idea that instru-pop is a tad Cirque de Soleil, or for people bored with debating how Philip Glass' symphony of David Bowie's Low ripped off his own Mishima soundtrack. Consciously fending off instru-pop dismissals by flouting how much they are loved by NPR's This American Life may be a poncey-bunk move, but a quick consultation of Bexar Bexar's ""Red R.O.T"" and ""Blue R.O.T"" should qualify them to accompany the day that cancer is considered a natural cause.","At the risk of sounding woefully unsophisticated, I must assert that the majority of instrumental pop releases strike me as ...

Some of My Best Friends Are DJs,Kid Koala,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8beb335119a49eca6c/1:1/w_160/6733ff7e.jpg,2003-10-22 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4415-some-of-my-best-friends-are-djs/,Ninja Tune,"The language we use to describe DJs is inevitably restricted and tiresome. When we're not calling them the Hendrixes of hip-hop, we're calling them the Van Halens. We, the Jealous Reviewers, have secluded them to the fringes of society while feigning to respect them as the bedrock of modern music. For me, and people like me, all DJs are, or should be, crazy block-rocking pyrotechnic experimental explosion collage artists, hellbent on throwing down flammable hardcore funkfests, and nothing but. For the hip-hop and indie rock elite, you're a good DJ if you can move the cueing lever with your tongue or light your fader on fire. This raises the question: Could there be an acoustic DJ? A Simon and Garfunkel DJ? No. Anyway, here we are. Kid Koala's new album. Ever since he hit the streets on the vanguard of the ""DJ contortionists"" with his track on Return of the DJ 2 in '97, Kid Koala has been at the forefront of instrumental DJ brilliance, with a sense of playfulness somewhere between the Invisibl Skratch Piklz and Cut Chemist. On his new rock-and-then-suddenly-stop half-hour album, Some of My Best Friends Are DJs, Koala sheds his former persona almost completely, with its tracks focusing more on structure, tone, and mood than how fast he can scratch. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome suggested this preoccupation, but there are virtually no discernible ""tick-a-tick-a"" sounds or mind-melting juggling here. It's a crackling, wooden excess of inebriated brass and meandering sideways bass. The predominant instruments are softly strummed ukulele and acoustic guitar. It's like a busking bossa nova Deltron 3030. The opener, ""Basin Street Blues"", is a startling scramble of subtle moderation for a DJ. First of all, it actually is the 1928 Spencer Williams standard ""Basin Street Blues"", which makes it one of the best (if not one of the only) DJ cover songs. A languishing bass starts buzzing, percussive acoustic guitar drums up, and the melody is taken by a sleepy trombone that falls into dilapidated moaning. It's a speakeasy DJ, performing for cotton pennies minted in the flapper era, watching the grime, poverty, and a parade. The beat keeps trying to jump into the morass only to shyly wander away. There are the requisite goofy samples, of course, but it's all rather seamless; this is more a composition than a mix. Elsewhere, ""Skanky Panky"" is like Tom Waits doing ska using your mom's easy listening killing fields and some convulsive funk. ""Robochacha"" is a robot learning how to dance. And I'm not just going David Fricke on the Pfork. That's what the song tells us it's about. Even my sordid heart and vexatious mind must surrender to a dancing robot song. The problem is, if the songwriting falls flat on an enterprise like this, there's no turntable pummeling to entertain you in languid spots. ""Annie's Parlor"" and ""Vacation Island"" are far from boring or overtly gimmicky, but the jazzy piano riffs and brass solos don't seem to be quite as well placed or stretched. ""Stompin' at Le Savoi"" has a decent beat and some grunting horn, but it never evolves, merely tracing innumerable loops around its sample. I might add in passing that rarely has a musician seemed less interested in his music than Kid Koala. This album comes with enhanced CD, a lengthy comic book, and a cut-out chess set, as well as a snide criticism of people like me (""free comic book + CD with this travel-size chess game""). In many ways, Some of My Best Friends Are DJs is little more than a brief comedy album, filled with strange samples of eccentric characters pontificating on their record collections and audio systems. You can either accept this as a sort of endearing (or perhaps sort of affably lazy) quality that shows he's in the game for fun, or you can wish he would stop jerking us around and fulfill his artistic potential. For some people, this tension will be a radical reinterpretation of turntable culture. Personally, I could do without coughing beatboxes and koala flatulence. Kid Koala is capable of making some of the best songs (and albums) in hip-hop. He knows it. We know it. His liner notes know it. The anticipation is abominable. He's three-quarters there.","The language we use to describe DJs is inevitably restricted and tiresome. When we're not calling them the Hendrixes ...

Where Is Tamashii?,Volapük,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98dc0084474cd0c1060/1:1/w_160/0c434fb9.gif,2003-10-22 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8517-where-is-tamashii/,Orkhestra,"French drummer and composer Guigou Chenevier formed Volapük in the early 90s with cellist Guillaume Saurel and clarinetist Michel Mandel. Fringe music lovers will recognize Chenevier from his infamous rock project Etron Fou Leloublan, one of the original RIO bands (Henry Cow, Univers Zero), and from appearing on Fred Frith's 1981 Speechless LP. He also played on one of the first real post-rock records, Vidéo Aventures' Musiques Pour Garçons et Filles (1980), reissued on CD in the late 90s and of interest to anyone at all into experimental rock. Chenevier's own work tends to feature angular, top-heavy riffs over his own precise, pitter-patter drumming and with a penchant for playful improvisation. In Etron Fou, he worked with sax and guitar or organ in sort of a DIY avant-prog vein; with Volapük the emphasis is closer to European folk, albeit highly energetic and sharply dynamic. Where Is Tamashii? is Volapük's fourth record, and second to feature violinist and vocalist Takumi Fukushuma (formerly of the brilliant Japanese experimental ensemble After Dinner). The band specializes in an expert fusion of folk, circus music, gypsy dances and sounding like something that would go very well over a silent film about murderous clowns. Fukushuma's occasional vocals also bring a few of the songs into a realm similar to Czech vocalist Iva Bittova's eccentric avant-pop. All of this happens without the slightest hint of ""Art,"" though the fact that Chenevier had to pull his musicians from classical conservatories should tell you something. There aren't many bands playing this kind of music, but I can say without hyperbole that Volapük is by some measure the best. Despite the distinctive ingredients that go into Volapük's songs, the best ones are those that aren't obviously tied to any particular style. The title track begins as a cumbersome, yet sweet string-led ballad; when Fukushuma's vocals enter it becomes a very odd (and just as alluring) form of café J-pop. And just as soon, Mandel hits a deft, repeated figure on bass clarinet suggesting modest chaos is never far from this band's minds. Likewise, ""Impro Cloche"" begins as a kinetic, repetitive math-rock vamp, but when the clarinet rears its head, and Chenevier drops his wind-up toy breakbeat, the whole mess transforms into a 21st Century version of Raymond Scott's powerhouse big band. Midway through, a violin wails as if being tortured, the rest of the band sneaks out and Chenevier is left to pound out his way with what sounds like a can of soup and silverware. Le awesome. Elsewhere, Volapük's folk roots shine through, as on ""Boom Boom"" (classical Asian) and ""Pas de Panique"" (tango/French chamber dance crossing). On these tunes, their abilities to pull off less intense music are obvious, though Chenevier can hardly hide his restless figures for very long. ""Mission"" begins as aggressive pouncing with drums and cello, and adds a fluttering violin to announce its lengthy mid-section development. Chenevier's playing occasionally reminds me of Can's Jaki Liebezeit in the way he translates minimal flash into maximum pulse; during the solo section, his playing under Mandel's low-key, slightly Klezmer-influenced solo is admirably restrained. The gradually work up an intense dialogue, even with Mandel doubling himself with another solo at the same time, yet never approaching anything close to skronk. Volapük's previous three records were released on the Cuneiform imprint, which should give yet another idea of what to expect for anyone familiar with that label's roster. As it happens, the band is much more accessible than their pedigree might lead one to believe, though that might come down to the crispness of their arrangements. I can say that music at once as joyous, strange and accomplished is few and far between, so with any luck this catches on outside their small circle of fans. Chenevier's projects can always stand more exposure, and Where Is Tamashii? is on par with the best of them.","French drummer and composer Guigou Chenevier formed Volap\xFCk in the early 90s with cellist Guillaume Saurel\n\ and clarinetist ...

12 Memories,Travis,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a803b1335d7bf16991a5/1:1/w_160/e5f7a60c.jpg,2003-10-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8146-12-memories/,Epic,"Circumstance and pedigree once conspired to march Coldplay and Travis down the aisle of America's radio waves and top ten countdowns hand-in-hand, on the strength of a few catchy singles. Though always mentioned in the same breath-- even to this day-- I find myself wondering now whether the two bands were ever really that similar, or if lazy music journalists (ahem) just conspired to propel a nonexistent movement. If the latter was the case, that movement died at ""Hello."" The postmillennial Radiohead proved to be-- sorry, boys-- Radiohead. Travis have done little more on their past three releases than wade contentedly in the wake of all that passed: their music has remained formulaically consistent and oblivious to (probably unfounded) media expectations. 12 Memories finally finds Fran Healy and his Scottish chums deviating a bit from past bequests (and doing so less a few high tides of vigilant UK press or any true semblance of stateside hype), but never really breaking stride enough to chart deeper waters. Mostly, they stumble, spin, and fall awkwardly into a middle ground too contemplative and, in the end, under-realized. Recording this album after suffering through drummer Neil Primrose's near-death diving accident and awakening to the rancorous societal and cultural injustices of our humble globe circa ought-three, Travis have been slapped out of their cheeky levity for good, and have lost nearly all worthwhile traces of their blithe, sing-along balladry-- once their greatest asset. Healy has an agenda this time around, and too frequently wields it like a cocksure amateur. Of the several anti-war-directed moments, the cumbersome lyrical bludgeoning that is ""The Beautiful Occupation"" stings the most. Peppered with references to the United Nations, and lines like, ""Half a million civilians are going to die today/ So look the other way,"" the song obstinately shoots blanks. Similarly minded, ""Peace the Fuck Out"" feels laughably more like a posturing cheerleader giving you the finger than a seriously reflective reminder, with ""Please don't give up/ You have a voice, don't lose it/ You have a choice so choose it/ You have a brain so use it."" Even the melody lacks color of any kind; a problematic recurrence. With the carefree, breezy melodies (or even lightly introspective moments) absent, such lyrical misfortunes take center stage, and lay waste to the potential windfall of Healy's falsetto. Instead, we're left with conspicuous déjà-Thom pleas (on ""Re-Offender"": ""You're fooo-oo-lin' yahself"") and moth-eaten clichés. Seemingly aware of its bankrupt course, overtly attention-grabbing moments such as the floor stomping romp on ""How Many Hearts?"" bedaub the record with a new sonic adventurousness, but merely serve to spread the final product thin. The album's best moments are crafted when the band plays within itself, and are mostly shuffled to the end of the deck. ""Somewhere Else"" and ""Walking Down the Hill"" are benign enough, with nicely twisted melodies and some well-needed understatement. The latter shines, if in a brushed-silver sort of way, and harkens back to early-laid blueprints. ""Happy to Hang Around"" garnishes the mix with a little tastefully spun attitude. But it all comes back to one central issue: each new direction leads into a wall or dies for lack of momentum. In short, nothing here has any edge. It's a problem Travis will need to resolve quickly if they intend on sticking around.","Circumstance and pedigree once conspired to march Coldplay and Travis down the aisle of America's radio\n\ waves and ...

I Am the Fun Blame Monster,Menomena,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43e5e6ef959693239f7/1:1/w_160/1fa97494.jpg,2003-10-21 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5555-i-am-the-fun-blame-monster/,BarsukMuuuhahaha!,"There's hardly a bolder statement you could make about your band's penchant for innovation than writing software specifically to aid your own distinctive compositional style. This is what Brent Knopf did; his program is called Deeler, and it allows his band, Menomena, to improvise short ideas and use them as the building blocks for broad, loop-based compositions which they then learn to play live. The method borrows most obviously from hip-hop and glitch, and you can pick up slight traces of both in the band's sound, but this music is distinctly pop-oriented, and reasonably traditional where its core melodies are concerned. The album opens with an accelerated, processed drum roll and then busts out into the aggressive rhythmic assault of ""Cough Coughing"". Drummer Danny Seim and bassist/guitarist Justin Harris can cut it up like nobody's business, and for some large portions of the song, it's just them sparsely making a groove happen, with vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Knopf's quivering piano occasionally rising like the ghost of an old ambient house record. The song's midsection is a series of head-spinning leaps and cuts through myriad textures, with Knopf resting on a tense piano melody. But it's not all highwire-act dynamics and ADD jams: I Am the Fun Blame Monster also brims with mood, a dark energy and sense of direction permeating every song. ""The Late Great Libido"" is a perfect testament to this, with its rivers of bubbling piano, droning sax and frenetic drums. The track is a not-too-distant cousin of Blur, but it does things in ways most bands would never dream of, bursting in the middle with thundering guitar melodies, building itself up in increments, snapping to silence and back, and sending each verse up differently than the one before. Harmonies float in on beautiful beds of piano in one instant, chase away tinkling glockenspiels the next, and then retreat altogether, yielding the field to pianos and heavily delayed drums. Elements you thought had disappeared for good resurface in new contexts with new meanings. You'll never get it all on the first listen, but there'll be no shaking that melody; Menomena could have a huge hit on their hands-- at least at the college level-- if this track finds its way into the right mitts. Surprises like the ones in ""The Late Great Libido"" are packed tightly into every song: guitars crash in only to anticipate silence, pianos weave through minefields of modular percussion, and Knopf's pleasing tenor runs a gauntlet of processing and fading to deliver what are fundamentally very basic melodies. ""E. Is Stable"" springs from a simple guitar line, repeatedly building up and breaking down, while ""Strongest Man in the World"" feels light until Knopf's hand reaches to the bottom octave of the piano and anchors the song to a sinister bass figure. Essentially, the band's process of building from small blocks enables them to put endless variations on each basic section of their songs-- introducing a pulsing organ and a plaintive piano separately, for instance, and then heaving them together in multiple combinations later in the song. Even the vocals are, by and large, just another module to be played with, disappearing for minutes at a time and reemerging with choruses just as you begin to grow accustomed to their absence. Suffice to say, Menomena are a hugely creative band, and with I Am the Fun Blame Monster, they've managed to make an album that's extremely accessible yet entirely unconventional. The thing that drew me to the album in the first place was the crazy artwork, which features a flipbook of four photos and very little other information, save that the disc's title is an anagram for ""the first Menomena album."" It's just one more subtlety that exemplifies the depth of detail apparent on this record.","There's hardly a bolder statement you could make about your band's penchant for innovation than writing software specifically ...

Kish Kash,Basement Jaxx,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2225e6ef95969320349/1:1/w_160/550fe2be.jpg,2003-10-21 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/573-kish-kash/,Astralwerks,"Over the past few months, some of the more conservative members of British music press have put their Coral raves on hold long enough to document the demise of the Superclubs (e.g. Ministry of Sound, Cream, Gatecrasher) and the continued splintering of music listeners. Trotting out a series of ""Dance Music Is Dead"" pieces that amount to little more than lazy thinking and gleeful opportunism, many of these critics aim to deflate a music they never liked in the first place. Here in America, we're slowly showing signs of shaking our deep-rooted discophobia. In recent years, indieland has finally embraced the post-punk that makes you wind up your waist instead of just standing around full of righteous political anger. In 2003, we're finally loose-limbed and non-puritanical enough to be able to bestow the Second Annual Gang of Four Award-- presented to the most overused musical touchstone of the year-- upon Prince. At this rate, a revival fueled by re-writes of ""Can You Feel It?"", ""No Way Back"" and ""Voodoo Ray"" should hit American shores sometimes around 2043. One problem with the typical dance rhetoric has been that it ignores most of the past thirty years of disco and its offshoots. At disco's peak, its detractors and demolition crews resented what was seen as a culture of exclusivity and hedonism. The haters put Bianca Jagger and the Studio 54's white horse in the crosshairs, ignored the communal and utopian nature of the dancefloor, and-- with at least a tinge of homophobia-- associated the sound with being fake, evil, anti-human. Since then, dance music's entry in the rock-crit history books has been limited to the late 70s when the music was inescapable: a few years when an industry-fed orgy of overspending and over-saturation and the shaky work of disco tourists clouded its quality. But talking about American disco and ignoring Philly Soul, The Loft, Salsoul, disco (not disco) records and the dance end of post-punk, Arthur Russell, garage, electro and house is sort of like approaching the thirty-year history of American punk and forgetting The Stooges, New York Dolls, CBGB's, The Germs, Black Flag, and their L.A. cohorts, hardcore, emocore, and every underground band from K Street to Gilman Street to focus only on Green Day, Blink-182 and Good Charlotte. And yet, the winner takes it all, so with the blessing of the rock press, that's exactly what's happened. In recent years, the non-rock world is again slowly incorporating pop/rock structures into their sound with great success. It was European dance DJs who made LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Radio 4, and the Electric Six names to drop. Bootleg culture did as much for The Strokes as it did for Xtina. Junior Senior's D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat is one of the best applications of the garage-rock revival. Outkast's Andre 3000 and the Luomo-versed Junior Boys have made two of 2003's best indie pop singles, and Bubba Sparxxx's ""Back in the Mud"" and Girls Aloud's ""No Good Advice"" rock as engagingly and forcefully as most guitar bands. And now comes Basement Jaxx, who on their new record Kish Kash produce both some of the most propulsive, ferocious music of the year as well as some of the most poignant, and they do it in part with the sounds of the old-fangled geetar. Kish Kash may not have highs as glorious as ""Red Alert"" or ""Romeo"", but it's the most consistently entrancing record of Basement Jaxx's career, and one on which they largely turn their ear away from the dynamics and repetition of dance music. For instance, of the tracks here, only ""Supersonic"" wouldn't have stood out on their debut, Remedy-- and even that track doesn't feature house's traditional 4/4 beat. (Plus, it has a guitar solo!) A little darker and less playful than their previous efforts, the first half of the record takes the energy, velocity and thrust of ""Where's Yo Head At?"" and adds a head-swimming number of sonic details, resulting in a series of dense dance-pop gems; the second half is more placid, built on acoustic guitars and broken hearts more than electronic dreams and broken beats. A pool of guest vocalists further enrich this material, adding an additional layer of variety to the album's already diverse palette. The Bellrays' Lisa Kekaula opens the record in strong voice, riding a regal rave-up of guitar, strings and handclaps on ""Good Luck"", a defiant, acerbic nu-""I Will Survive"". Siouxsie Sioux's pummeling anti-greed collaboration, ""Cish Cash"", knocks Fugazi back into Brent D.'s record box and sends most of electroclash back to Williamsburg or The Hague with its tail between it legs. First single ""Lucky Star"" retains the peerless Dizzee Rascal's eastern vibe while he thrillingly explains why he needs music to make him grow ""dy-na-mi-tee."" And ""Plug It In"" bathes J.C. Chasez in a tide of sighs, brutish synths and whipsmart drum breaks. The most surprisingly successful collaborations, however, are from Me'shell NdegéOcello, whose ""Right Here's the Spot"" is a more striking P-Funk/Prince (dig the ""Delirious"" reference) amalgamation than most of Speakerboxxx and more deliciously carnal than The Love Below. NdegéOcello also gives Kish Kash its tender close on the slow-burning ""Feels Like Home"", a fitting finale for its more stirring, introspective second half. You'd have gotten some pretty good odds at the beginning of the year that a Prince-influenced duo would wind up making one of the most sonically thrilling, genre-hopping records of the year, but it wasn't either of the more likely pairs that managed to do it. Pharrell and Chad treaded water, offering an album that consolidated their strengths but rarely approached their best work. Then Big Boi did his part, but Andre 3000 dropped the ball, creating a modern Lovesexy when a Dirty Mind would have been more rewarding. On Kish Kash, Basement Jaxx recover Dre's fumble and move near the front of the 00s' crop of rock-dance crossovers, a growing group of Paradise Garage rockers who, with luck, are a sign of the times.","Over the past few months, some of the more conservative members of British music press have put their Coral\n ...

New Sacred Cow,Kenna,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc22c0084474cd0c2a0c/1:1/w_160/4cf4ca02.jpg,2003-10-21 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4562-new-sacred-cow/,Columbia,"The most remarkable thing about Kenna's shameless new wave revivalism is that Fred Durst likes it-- enough to take Kenna aboard his inappropriately named Flawless imprint, anyway. After Puddle of Mudd, I'd assumed Durst would be court-ordered to remain a minimum 500 feet away from music at all times (Limp Bizkit, of course, would be allowed to continue on the premise that they had transcended even the loosest definition of the word). What? Tired potshots at career punchlines like Durst not your idea of music criticism? Then let me be more direct: the only other remarkable thing about Kenna's music is the inherent supposition that his audience has never heard Depeche Mode. His stock 80s Casio beats may be updated with enough 21st Century stop/start glitchcraft to keep a tenuous hold on the present (the album cover itself proudly proclaims that The Neptunes' ""Chase"" Chad Hugo is responsible for the record's production), but New Sacred Cow is a retro love-letter all the way, with sparse, lurching synths rattling around inside hollowed-out arrangements and vocals infused with just enough heartfelt rubber soul to give the tunes some bounce when the repetitive backing electronics fall flat. Unfortunately, that tends to happen a lot, and believe me, from the fifth track onwards, it's not a question of whether or not a track will break down to some theatrically soaring refrain, but simply when. It's a stretch that he might choking back emotion as he sings, ""Give me a ride on a Zephyr and rocket from here/ Give me all your affection and teach me how to feel,"" on ""Love/Hate Sensation"", but as he carries song after song with the same gasping investiture, it becomes a complete joke. And that's to say nothing of the actual content, typified by the aforementioned profundity. Of course, the vapidity of Kenna's outbursts isn't the problem; the issue is with how purely mechanical they become. Uber-simplistic, characterless loops are the backbone of nearly every track here, with barely a hook between them; Kenna tries to shoulder the load, but inevitably tires beneath it. There are a couple of minor standouts within the context of the album (""Man Fading"" capitalizes on the drama New Sacred Cow conjures up before it wears thin; ""Vexed and Glorious"" offers a slightly more subtle variation on the theme), but the only really great song present is the aptly chosen single, ""Freetime"". As the first real song on the album, it nails Kenna's formula, and leaves it for the rest of the album to beat to death. The difference between this and the album's other tracks lies entirely with the music. The coiled tension of the verse's staccato riff is wrapped that much tighter, the cascading washes that elevate the chorus are that much more grand. It's three minutes of the recent past as filtered through the near-future; the other forty-nine minutes just filter the past through the who-cares present, and for now you can pretty much find that anywhere.","The most remarkable thing about Kenna's shameless new wave revivalism is that Fred Durst likes it-- enough to take ...

Plays One Sound and Others / Red River / Cut the Cord,Knife in the Water,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc23c0084474cd0c2a0f/1:1/w_160/47c47f8b.jpg,2003-10-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11770-plays-one-sound-and-others-red-river-cut-the-cord/,Glitterhouse,"Austin quintet Knife in the Water have taken their moniker from the early Roman Polanski movie Nóz w Wodzie for a reason: the parallel between their music and the slow dread and bare-wrought tension of the film is uncanny. My first exposure to the band came nearly seven years ago, and it's weird to have that same 1998 debut album before me once again in a glossier, non-self-released edition. With a slightly separated remastering revealing the sharp edges of Cisco Ryder's restrained cymbals, Bill McCullough's smoky and swooping pedal steel, and John Brewington's rumbling bass, the debut remains as breathtaking as the first time I saw them, the solemn pacing of the disc as sure as a southern gentleman's gait, a Texas Two-Step, or Leatherface's limp (which may all be the same walk). From the opening breath of their epic signature song, ""One Sound"", the whispered vocals and lonesome reverberations of guitarist Aaron Blount and the harmonic siren song and Baptist organ undertow of girlfriend Laura Krause suck me under. Their voices lace together like star-crossed white trash to stir up Blount's tales of the dark, silty bottom of the hick id. His tales drift between the honky-tonking body choppery of ""I Sent You Up"", to the more nuanced and character-driven dirge of ""Married Woman"", and back into more expansive moments of barren countryside dread for ""Norma"". ""Come on Cotton"" and ""Swallows"", meanwhile, jangle just enough Galaxie 500 to keep the disc from slicing into the nearby wrist veins, but the abandoning sneer of ""Muse"" is downright cruel, and even that pales next to the album's most chilling track, ""Careening"", which reveals the band's oceanic depths. A haunting epic of bodily disintegration down in the greasy Gulf of Mexico, the drowning mind of the narrator spins final memories of kitchenettes, distant offspring, and spousal repugnance as the song drifts apart in waves of cymbal and the disembodied groans of Laura Krause, the tom and single bass tones ebbing like the tides. If anything, their debut reminds me of the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple, with just a few rough elements sketching out the tragic folk and wronged lovers. Burning trailers, severed ears, hatchbacked wrecks along the highway, taps of unhooked screen doors-- these gruesome images flicker along with the entwined throats of the two singers. This edition tacks on a single recorded for Western Vinyl, which sounds lifted from the wax itself. ""Slavery"" is as standard as a Knife in the Water song can get, but ""Redbird"" is stripped to barely touched guitar and rattle. Here, the lovers assuage each other in the burnt-out remnants of the mobile, caressing their betrothed with broken bottles of Lone Star. Red River somehow does their debut one better. The increased maturity here permeates everything: it's achingly slow Caesarian scars and bags under the eyes, and achingly slow movement; it's crow's feet and Hepatitis C and night sweats in the August air. A heavier drinking problem and taste for the harder stuff. The collated visions of the indescribable nights in South Texas are now recurring nightmare reruns at 3:00 a.m., the mini-thins still going strong as the TV irradiates the apartment with a ghostly blue light. This time around the band sounds completely fleshed out; Bill McCullough's steel swells with feedback on ""Watch Your Back"", bludgeon in hand, or else sketches out the spacious Hill Country on ""Machine to Tulsa"". Cisco Ryder brushes the drums like swaying wheat from Days of Heaven, now crackling and snapping, now burning bright like a blaze. Laura Krause's organ playing has greater elasticity, and her supporting voice takes on more roles, from comforting nurse to hoary tranny-talk, along the way evoking Patsy Cline's ""baum baums"" as well as Nancy Sinatra's velvety lines. (The latter, of course, isn't a surprising influence, as the band make the Nancy and Lee Hazlewood gem ""Sundown, Sundown"" their own here.) Blount's damned characters and purgatorial locales fall into even in sharper relief. ""Rene"" sits in a topless bar parking lot on the South side of town, a handgun in her lap, while visions of shooting her abusive lover in the face writhe before her eyes. A nameless transsexual washes up in ""Young Blood in the River"". The woozy ""Party (for the People of the Open Wound)"" pops pills and chugs keg beer on the east side of I-35 along with all the other revelers. This bleary-eyed chem delirium, conveyed with the sparsest of brush hits, string strokes, and breathless harmonizing, exemplifies what the band does best. The last two songs, much as on the debut, serve as successive pinnacles of this sustained sound tension and bare narrative vision. The narcotic effects of the music and swirls of steel only appear to alleviate on ""Broad Daylight"", instead letting the ghastly images of botched amputations and sexual denigration twist about in the song, between the multiple meanings of ""coming to/too."" Original album-ender ""Nightingales for Evelyn"" involves box-cutter-sliced kids and splattered bird feathers lilting over a slow waltz, drifting into a dark puddle of blood beneath as ""visions of glory collide."" Besides a poetic blurt by Bowers' beloved David Berman, the label has added to this reissue another single from around the period of the album's release: ""2 Spades"" and ""Sunset Motel"" are presented in reverse order, presumably to make the disc more cohesive. The B-side leans into some jerky-meat rockabilly recounting shallow graves and Russian roulette, while the latter is a pulpy seven minutes of organ gnashing, steel slashing, and motel murder mystery. This all sets the table for the latest from the group, Cut the Cord. Five years on from their debut, their country overtones are subdued, palpable more in the songs added for the U.S. release than in the album proper. Aside from McCullough's continued steel contributions, only Blount and Krause remain intact, the rhythm section completely overhauled. Perhaps that's what makes the songs feel somewhat more stiff at the start, although as ""The Very Air"" plays through, it makes more sense. Reverberating thwacks and trickling lines of pedal shift into drive with the bass and drums and the measures are more propulsive and less lateral landscape. ""Village Fireworks"" mingles a booming bass drum with shimmering metallophones and Doppler organs as the two singers whisper a curse for the city that's ""fucked itself."" ""Massacre"" feverishly strums a guitar and a snare-rattling march as yet another drowning occurs between the minute details: ""No termites in the rafters/ Needles stay upon the trees/ And lilies on the water/ She doesn't feel as heavy as she imagined."" Blount's songwriting has taken a turn for the more abstract and less Nowhere, USA noir. The readily-evoked highways and CrimeStopper scenes get replaced by temporal fireworks, sacrificial tigers, and lighthouses to the blind. ""Biltmora Children"" sketches out a tale of three children abandoned to the elements where ""bloodbait brings a strangeness to the wild."" The meanings remain vague, but the menace below the song-surface is still palpable, rippling like murder weapons in shallow water. The cello-kissed ""Warped Pearls"" is uncrackable: ""Mother moth cocoon becomes a bloody mess/ Lights between the trees drinking antifreeze."" All visual movement exists inside the heads of its characters now, filled with broken (and non-sensical) hallucinations that no longer tell their tales from the outside. ""My Skin Covers the Waterfront"" wavers between images of Frankenstein and Ed Gein-stitched skin, but most mysterious is ""Golden Calf Highway"", a road trip between Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Badlands. It begins with a ""Wagon Wheel""-type of loping cowboy beat while the singer, in death throes, sees young girls out the window ""running naked in the rain/ Sawed off blows buckshot through the hay.../ Air warped by gasoline/ June bugs giving up in May/ Carcasses dot the golden calf highway."" The lights grow increasingly dim as evil electronics and distorted blood drips rise up and overtake the disc in a bath of noise. Pack 'em in as a band with that whole No Depression crowd, or other purveyors of Americana that dabble in that other great folk form (country music), which can include The Mekons, Nick Cave, Low, Palace, Califone, Calexico, The Handsome Family, Chicagoans and New Mexicans or whomever, their songs shine through like switchblades in the bar neon. How long can it be till Willie or Steve Earle is singing ""I Sent You Up""? Three albums in, the couple evoke country's great duos, be it George and Tammy or Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, while also cutting a swath down South distinctly their own. Knife in the Water resonate with their own Texas twang and taint, burying clues and loads of bloody evidence in their wake.",,8.4,
Arborvitae,Loren ConnorsDavid Grubbs,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f769fc7814a47cd792/1:1/w_160/0c4a64f1.gif,2003-10-20 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5173-arborvitae/,Häpna,"Maintenant is the French word for now, its two components being the words for ""hand"" and ""hold."" But then, it's hard to capture ""now""-- and as any fan and follower of improvised music understands all too well, any brief epiphanies grasped too often slither away into empty gestures or extended technique until that next magical Moment occurs. Such moments, when experienced live, rarely reduce into words, and trying to nail that ephemeral moment in a studio environment (much less attempt to re-create past times) is a thankless endeavor, with lots of empty hands at the end of it. Loren Connors and David Grubbs had one of those Moments a few months ago out at the Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, turning in a fine set of duets. In general, the two guitarists can be relied upon to skirt uninspired time-filling or the practice of resorting to strange sounds for their own sake-- for better or for worse, their playing stays planted, be it roots in a motel room blues or po-mo songster threads for theses. On Arborvitae, the two capture every dimension of the uncluttered room they usually evoke, but unfortunately, they also attempt to capture the one-off feel of their cemetery performance, and, despite the fruitfulness of that initial meeting, their results here are far too two-dimensional. ""Blossom Time"" opens with the sort of phrasing that Grubbs' elucidated to stunning effect on Palace Music's Arise Therefore and his first solo album for Table of the Elements. The vibrant wood of the piano is melodic-coat-rack enough for Connors to hang his notes and spectral overcoats, and he riddles the piece with melancholy feedback. Poignantly stated and played, the two guitarists spread out and cover the space. But later, as the title track loses its harmonic framework at the halfway mark, the duo's tentative grip gets lost for good. Connors' once effervescent clouds reduce into flat puddles as he changes course-- he goes from fumbling feedback to mere melody echoing into some numbed-lip wah, uncertain how exactly to engage Grubbs' turgid piano plod. Grubbs can't keep it up, either, and his suspended piano goes pedestrian before stopping altogether. He switches to electric guitar for a few more minutes of meandering duets. ""Hemlock Path"" wanders upon a sketch of melody, but prolonged exploration reveals the duo to be in separate rooms altogether, their movements and habitual gestures noticed too late to be followed. Grubbs sits back at the piano for ""The Highest Point in Brooklyn"", and I myself wonder where that might be. It's certainly not here: banged-out chords clang free some fine tube-glow chains from Connors, the two sounds twining tightly together for a moment before finally letting go. The phantom sounds remain insubstantial, and for momentary music, it's flatter than a ghost sheet.",,6.4,
Chutes Too Narrow,The Shins,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d2b1335d7bf16987f4/1:1/w_160/d6a172c4.jpg,2003-10-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7114-chutes-too-narrow/,Sub Pop,"Reality television, actors-turned-governors, and wrestlers-turned-rappers aside, it's hard to think of many things that elicit cynicism and offhand dismissal like a sophomore album on the heels of a hyped debut. The dreaded ""sophomore slump"" is hardly a fictional pitfall fabricated by bitter music journalists and defensive cred-mongers; the pressures of turning out a second record can be crippling for bands who've encountered early success, and it often results in an album that pales in contrast to its predecessor. Yet, for every band that falters in the wake of initial success, there's another that puts their newfound experience to work for them, producing a second record-- a sophomore hump, if you will-- that delivers upon all the promise of their first. And with Chutes Too Narrow, the second album from much-lauded Pacific Northwest popsters The Shins, that sophomore hump is in full effect. Arriving on a wave of pre-release hype in 2001, The Shins' debut record, Oh! Inverted World, immediately established itself as one of the most uniformly and universally likeable records of that year. Though not nearly the second coming of The Beach Boys as described by its most vocal proponents, the album was forged in melody and drenched in atmosphere, casting a thin but palpable haze over a beautifully arranged landscape of sincere hooks and sparse instrumentation. It was an immediately inviting formula, if one that ultimately proved limiting; the blurred sonics that blanketed the record also often smothered it, dulling the focus and clarity that frontman James Mercer skirted during the album's most powerful passages. On Chutes Too Narrow, the blanket has been lifted, and the complexity and grace revealed underneath possess a surprisingly depth. Every instrument is allowed to exist in its own space, no longer smoothed together by excessive reverb. Mercer's voice resides comfortably at the front of the mix, revealing previously undiscovered layers of emotional subtlety and expressiveness. Every sound and syllable is perfectly and distinctly articulated, granting the album a much greater capacity for detail and profundity. And then there are the songs. Dear god, the songs! The uniqueness and inventiveness of James Mercer's melodic sensibility simply cannot be overstated. On Chutes Too Narrow, as with its predecessor, Mercer makes brilliant use of his formidable vocal range, writing soaring melodies every bit as original as they are memorable. ""Saint Simon"", one of two or three songs on the record that could easily contend for song of the year, sees Mercer exploring an almost Bacharach-ian level of melodic sophistication. The track is host to an elegance of exposition and development not even hinted at on Oh! Inverted World, as it seamlessly segues from a straightforward pop hook to an ungodly gorgeous choral segment, replete with lush strings and chiming guitars. By the time Mercer reenters with a perfectly aching vocal melody, it's almost unbearable-- this is the kind of song that overwhelms simply with the intricacy of its beauty. The evolution of Mercer's songwriting extends wonderfully into the louder songs on Chutes Too Narrow, as well. ""Kissing the Lipless"", the album's leadoff track, blissfully transgresses the restraint of Oh! Inverted World, building to an impossibly powerful chorus that slyly mirrors the melody of its verses. Indeed, while many pop songwriters seem to use verses simply as something to kill time between anthemic choruses, Mercer manages to squeeze some of the album's most memorable moments into places most songwriters would neglect or ignore. ""So Says I"", the album's first single, excels largely through the subtle variations worked into its verses, and enjoys its strongest moment in the transcendent harmonies that adorn a brief, seamless bridge. The attention to detail on Chutes Too Narrow is truly impressive, but the way that these details combine to form music so effortless and emotionally rich is astounding. Chutes Too Narrow is host to enough perfect moments to carry ten records, each one arising spontaneously from the multifaceted frame of a masterfully constructed song. The album may alienate some listeners by eschewing the instant and consistent gratification of Oh! Inverted World for more involved, developed songs, but the clarity and intricacy of these songs renders the record a much more rewarding listen. Not simply an excellent album, Chutes Too Narrow is also a powerful testament to pop music's capacity for depth, beauty and expressiveness.","Reality television, actors-turned-governors, and wrestlers-turned-rappers aside, it's hard to think of many things that elicit cynicism and offhand dismissal ...

EADGB*E,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80bb1335d7bf16991b1/1:1/w_160/185130b9.gif,2003-10-20 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2026-eadgbe/,12k,"Some time ago, Pitchfork writer Nitsuh Abebe planted this idea in my head that all digital art returns to the natural world for inspiration. What's interesting about this move is that it's the exact opposite of a ""retreat to simplicity."" When computer artists incorporate nature into their work they're actually borrowing from the most complicated and unknowable patterns in the universe. The physical world is difficult to break down to 1's and 0's (imagine a CGI rendering of surf crashing on the rocks next to a view of the real thing), causing these artists put aside the silicon and kneel humbly before wood and stone. The guitar is, among other things, a physical object with electrical properties. Each guitar is a series of tiny electrical fields-- strings, pickup, interior electronics-- that lends it a specific character, and this makes it a natural fit with computers. In the last few years it's become common in certain circles to use the guitar as a sound source for the creation of otherwise digital music. At least part of the reason this pairing has become popular is that it inserts the ""natural"" (which is, remember, complex) into an otherwise virtual world. EADGBE*, on the always-interesting 12k label, compiles music from four artists working with these tools. Earlier this year, Japan's Fonica released the sleeper Ripple on Tomlab (also home to The Books, Tujiko Noriko, and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone), a record with serious warmth and a vaguely pop sensibility. The two tracks they contribute to EADGBE* are more placid and a tad more academic. A cluster of quivering drones hover in the foreground of ""4:55"", and the melody is a punctuated series of bells that pop up at regular intervals. ""3:33"" is an overlapping series of groans that irregularly tumble through the sound field, creating new patterns with each passing second to nice effect. In contrast with Fonica's up-to-the-minute processing is Keith Fullerton Whitman's ""Lettera"". With its abrupt shifts in dynamics and texture and endless tweaks of simple sounds, ""Lettera"" sounds something like an early electronic tape piece, definitely much closer to 20th Century Classical than post-Eno ambient. Lacking the clarity and focus of Playthroughs, ""Lettera"" feels more like an experiment that didn't quite gel. EADGBE* gets more interesting with three tracks by Sébastien Roux. With his focus on sonic detail, Roux's aesthetic comes closest to the 12k ideal of microsound. Roux's tiny sounds usually enter the scene painfully, with an accompanying halo of noise. His style tends to combine a shifting layer of buzzing drones with clearly articulated melodic crackles dancing in front. Tapped guitar harmonics are shaped into repeating patterns on ""Utaro"", while ""Toasa"" focuses on single string strums that emit showers of static. These three are wonderful tracks to crawl around in. Fonica, Whitman and Roux are a gradual build to EADGBE*'s stunning centerpiece, seven related and connected tracks by San Francisco composer Christopher Willits called ""Seven Machines for Summer"". Willits' technique is to sample a number of plucked single guitar notes and then arrange them into pieces with relatively light processing. ""The Baroque Machine"", for example, consists of computer-assisted guitar runs, Takemura-like clicks, and what sounds like organ but is probably processed feedback. His rapid and repetitious style owes something to classic minimalism (occasionally I'm reminded of the Reich piece ""Electric Counterpoint"", written for Pat Metheny), but Willits' method is more overtly melodic and pop oriented. It's immediately catchy and emotionally engaging. Willits occasionally has a passage in ""Seven Machines for Summer"" that could have been played by a live guitarist, but that would have been boring. Instead, there is a stiffness and slightly ""broken"" quality in his digital arrangements that inject a pang of melancholy to feelings of joy. His tracks move gradually to the climax that is the almost painfully gorgeous ""The Fall in Love Machine"". This finale reprises the theme of ""The Baroque Machine"" but fleshes it out into a chattering musicbox symphony. Finally, after his seven-track series, Willits closes the compilation an unrelated short piece called ""Champagne and Soda"", a darker piece with an almost industrial texture. Had Willits put ""Seven Machines for Summer"" on its own EP, it would have been one of my favorites of 2003. As it is, his work anchors this occasionally spotty but ultimately excellent compilation.","Some time ago, Pitchfork writer Nitsuh Abebe planted this idea in my head that all digital art returns to\n ...

One Mississippi,Brendan Benson,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27613d197565213889d/1:1/w_160/e95c603b.jpg,2003-10-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/656-one-mississippi/,VirginVirgin,"Brendan Benson's songs are almost exclusively about girls: nearly every harmony-heavy track buried deep inside Benson's discography contains some sort of nod to a mangled or budding relationship, even if that allusion ends up sitting in the context of an entirely separate story. Ladies are tied to chairs, or eating soft-serve ice cream from Dairy Queen, or helpfully pointing out to everyone that Benson's just ""not John Lennon."" But no matter how tragic Benson's girl-trouble may occasionally seem, that ache has gotta be dwarfed by the devastation of his industry woes-- if profound major label distrust were to be given a dubious, heartbroken face, it would probably look an awful lot like Benson's sheepish mug. After being pegged as pop/rock's new blonde hero by critics and college DJs in 1996, Benson's promising Virgin Records debut, the effusive One Mississippi, was promptly declared insignificant by label heads, denied a substantial promotional backing, and left to languish peaceably in relative obscurity (see: the vast warehouses of Amazon UK). Virgin had signed Benson based on the strength of an untempered six-song demo, but their flippant dismissal of One Mississippi was preceded by loads of unsolicited meddling: the label had already asked Benson to shelve his original version of the record, produced by co-conspirator and one-time Jellyfish member Jason Falkner (who also co-wrote over half the songs), in order to work with Jane's Addiction/Minutemen producer Ethan James. Benson succumbed to the label's request and dutifully re-recorded One Mississippi with James at the production helm. As agreed, Virgin then shipped the record to radio stations, and Benson nobly attempted his first major support tour, opening for Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. But with little radio airplay and the still proscenium-shy Benson stumbling around awkwardly on stage, One Mississippi was largely ignored and Benson was dropped by Virgin; unsurprisingly, it took nearly five years for Benson to untangle himself and release a follow-up, 2002's comparably straightforward (but Jack White-endorsed!) Lapalco. Now with independent StarTime International, Benson has released a plumped-up, twenty-two track version of One Mississippi (including the six Falkner-produced tracks and two bonus songs, previously available only on the Japanese version of the LP), complete with gushing, masterpiece-declaring liner notes, thus priming the record for admission into the long-lost-classic canon. One Mississippi deserves much of its hyperbolic praise: showcasing Benson's indisputable songwriting prowess, it's packed with tight melodies, feisty guitar jabs, and some inescapably catchy harmonies, a pop/rock treasure chest that's both impossibly listenable and surprisingly complex; Benson's addictive hooks tend to conceal rich, oddly understated arrangements, and his guitar work can be both Townshend-abrasive and bubblegum easy. For folks who've already managed to wrap their hands around an original copy of One Mississippi, there are enough extras here to justify the investment and satiate completists. The Falkner-produced versions (""Crosseyed"", ""Me Just Purely"", ""Cherries"", ""I'm Blessed"", and ""Sittin' Pretty"" are all present in duplicate) of One Mississippi's final cuts tend to be more stubbornly lo-fi and generally richer, while ""Christy"", which didn't make it onto the James-produced edition, is a gratifyingly aggressive addition. Still, Brendan Benson's epic tale of major label wreckage is oddly inconclusive: he may have been waylaid and wearied by unsympathetic suits, but-- as if this story could get any more prototypically indie!-- Benson's earliest stuff still stands up as his best.","Brendan Benson's songs are almost exclusively about girls: nearly every harmony-heavy track buried deep inside Benson's discography contains ...

Orchards & Caravans,Birdtree,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43c13d1975652138c80/1:1/w_160/39d7fd72.gif,2003-10-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1088-orchards-caravans/,Last Visible Dog,"The field recordings that map The Birdtree's recent pilgrimage into Audubon territory chart a deep-woods atmosphere illuminated solely by the fleeting pulses and fades of filtered sunlight that drift across a sandy forest floor. Originally released as a Jewelled Antler Collective CD-R and now reissued as a CD proper by Last Visible Dog, Orchards & Caravans corrals fourteen of Glenn Donaldson's ethereal acid-folk compositions; it's the San Francisco shaman's strongest concoction to date, ranking with classic releases by such disparate but aesthetically connected groups as Ghost, Flying Saucer Attack, and International Harvester. Much like his more droning work with Loren Chasse as The Blithe Sons, Orchards & Caravans takes flight around delicate guitar melodies and pensive vocalizations, incorporating bowed oud, bells, toy accordion, Wurlitzer, harmonium, bouzouki, banjo, keyboards, and occasional drumming. Packaged in a highly saturated collage of birds and butterflies, a gaping Venus flytrap, distant trees, prehistoric flora, and the half-human birds found often in Egyptian mythology, the album combines experimental instrumentals, magisterial folk, and lengthy drones. Evoking the delicate dance of pine needles when they catch a breeze and disappear over a horizon line, ""White Sundials Faced the Sun"" is a segment of subdued Loren Mazzacane-esque guitar noodle: Maintaining a slow-drip tempo, the carefully spaced guitar strums are held together with fragile vocal sighs. Assuming the properties of its title, ""Pillar of Clouds"" is a shimmering Middle-Eastern drone punctured with bells and the plucks and strums of various stringed instruments. The darkest excursion on the record, ""The Marsh"" mucks Goosewind-styled noise with scuttling contusions that build to a distant drone; overlaid with birds, wind and hisses, the manmade sounds ultimately consume the silvan calls of its backdrop. Surprisingly poppy at times, Donaldson goes beyond these incidental bits, managing also to pen some solid folk hooks. In his hands (and without Bob Dylan's backup singers), the traditional ""Mary Ann"" emerges wrapped in hoarfrost, a stark ballad whittled to the high-gloss atmospherics of Galaxie 500. Hopelessly catchy, and perhaps Donaldson's most straightforwardly appealing song to date, ""Everyone of Us a New Leaf"" features rattling drums by Steven R. Smith, a minimal organ line, talk of ghosts, and a distant vocal intonation most reminiscent of Black Heart Procession. Like Ben Chasny during his most patient work as Six Organs of Admittance, Donaldson is also adept at incorporating loose structures that allow for the creation of songs within songs and asymmetrical pieces that sprout into unexpected directions. Unlike its dreary name, ""Black Rainbows, Part 1 & 2"" is the acid folk cousin of The Temptations' ""My Girl""; halfway through, the sweetness uncoils into a fractured organ rumble, a distant thunder or grayscale prism. Moving in an opposite direction, ""The Lost Sun"" emerges amid a noisy flight pattern but gives way to poignant strains of melodic guitar, half-shaken jingle bells, a lost war, and a lost sun. Here, the jangling instrumentation contrasts with the track's ingrained melancholy. I've looked for holes in the armor but Donaldson's too fastidious. Prior to this, he came closest to reaching these heights on The Blithe Sons' We Walk the Young Earth. Here, though, he manages to top that effort, distilling the best attributes of his naturalist psych and patiently building a fully realized dreaming hill, something that fellow Terrastock travelers, in even their most transcendent work, have only been able to hint at.","The field recordings that map The Birdtree's recent pilgrimage into Audubon territory chart a deep-woods atmosphere illuminated solely by ...

Honeyspot,Asteroid No. 4,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12713d1975652138571/1:1/w_160/9ab174e0.jpg,2003-10-19 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/326-honeyspot/,Turquoise Mountain,"There must be a million bands like this playing the wedding-banquet circuit in Santa Fe and Albuquerque. How Asteroid No. 4 avoided that fate is a mystery (though being from Philadelphia probably helped), for there's very little on Honeyspot, their third full-length album, that's even the least bit unique. In fact, the band exists almost entirely on the borrowed capital of the past. Departing from the 60s psychedelia and Syd Barrett-inspired folk of their underachieving EP, Apple Street, they're now recycling the sounds of George Jones, early Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, The Flying Burrito Brothers and others into an inferior, one-dimensional, revivalist pastiche-- that is to say, Son Volt Redux. All of the predictable elements are in place: banjo, steel guitar, mandolin, a harmonica that just will not shut up, female backing vocals, songs about preachers/booze/Godlessness, a Woody Guthrie re-arrangement, even blurry and luminescent band photos in the liner notes. There's nothing inherently wrong with this type of nostalgia, but when it becomes as emulative and formulaic as it does on Honeyspot, it starts to seem like parody. Boring parody. Creativity, boldness, salience; all of these things are sacrificed to Asteroid No. 4's confused longings for the music of the past. ""Runnin' Away,"" with its sun-shiny rhythm and distant piano plinks, is a nod to one of the band's many forebears, The Byrds, yet its repetitive chorus, ""Ooooo-eeeeee/ See me runnin' away,"" has all the forced, painful sentimentality of Boy scout camp sing-alongs. Sure, it's catchy alright, but give it a few listens and you'll be looking for the nearest smore-poker on which to impale yourself. ""Like Dogs"" is a blatant George Jones rip-off, complete with a weary, plodding drumbeat and mournful steel guitar. Frontman Scott Vitt even imitates Jones' voice as he sings, ""Well, some people say I'm wrong to do this to her/ But they don't know, we just don't see eye to eye.../ I prayed to the Lord to make things better/ But every night/ We bark and bite like dogs."" Simply put, Jones deserves a better homage than this. By far the best song on the album, ""It's All OK"", is a short, docile instrumental that could nearly pass for a Nashville Skyline outtake. The delicate banjo finger-picking feels genuinely inspired, providing a warm backdrop for the harmonica and steel guitar. Still, it's too indebted to its antecedents to amount to any more than a promising footnote. To be fair, that's not the only brief glimpse of promise here, but none ever stand out enough to save this album from its affected ruralism and tired, countryfied stylings. Explaining Asteroid No. 4's music, Vitt says, ""It's simple music for complicated times."" Well, let it be said that simple music doesn't have to be this boring.","There must be a million bands like this playing the wedding-banquet circuit in Santa Fe and Albuquerque. How Asteroid No ...

"Kill Bill, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fab1335d7bf1698f57/1:1/w_160/4eae69a1.gif,2003-10-19 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7887-kill-bill-vol-1/,Maverick,"The life of a hipster is arduous and complex, teeming with expensive haircuts, the obligation to buy the CDs the webzines have arbitrarily deemed cool, and those frilled skirts that you have to keep tugging at in the frigid lines to get into Chelsea's Bungalow 8. I mean, goddamn, it's like thirty degrees out there. The Hipster Handbook helped a little, but not enough. The questions linger. Is it cooler to be metrosexual, or to pretend to be metrosexual while actually being homosexual? Is it cooler to be an actual hipster, an ironic hipster, or the oft-imitated ""fool on the hill"" hipster? For those answers, only deep meditation can help; on the musical side of things, Quentin Tarantino has graciously solved many of our problems. The ramifications of this album on the young proto-hipster set will be incalculable. Simply for comparison, think about how you'd soundtrack Kill Bill. The best I can come up with is putting Genesis' ""I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"" over the climactic sword fight. Thank god, then, that the album, like the movie, was compiled by people who obviously have encyclopedic minds able to forge visual/musical puns and scorching contrasts between maddeningly obscure pop treasures. This is like a guidebook to the different genres needed to be cool. To quickly categorize: Perverse torch songs, menacing revved-up rockabilly, ancient slasher scores, Wu-Tang allegiances, blaxploitation funk, swing, 70s disco, Japanese punk-pop, spy anthems. They even put on a quick excerpt of Neu! And all the rest consists of the best spaghetti western rip-offs of all time. At my screening, people were passing out in the aisles during the opening credits alone, clutching each other, finding the speed of sound insufficient, and hence feebly grasping at the sound emanating from the speakers, slamming their empty hands into their ears, trying to get even more music into their heads. If the Pulp Fiction soundtrack birthed a million surf-rock fanatics, this album is going to reinvigorate every genre simultaneously. Whereas the Jackie Brown soundtrack occasionally felt hampered by songs that drew most of their interest from their relationship to the movie, these songs not only are able to exist independently from their cinematic representations, but, at their best, exceed even the sheer jaw-dropping coolness of the scenes they scored. The opener is Nancy Sinatra's enrapturing Hazlewood-produced gruesome breakup threnody, ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Next to a solitary guitar played by an underwater mortician, Sinatra sings the incomparable intro, ""I was five and he was six/ We rode on horses made of sticks..."" And these were written by Sonny Bono! If you're trying to make tedium, you can have John Williams; if you're trying to make a movie, you better make damn sure you have a Nancy Sinatra song in it. Sun Records pioneer Charlie Feathers' ""That Certain Female"" is all warbling lasciviousness. In the lengthy history of country/blues/rock tunes that start with a god-defying ""Wellllllllll...,"" this is in the very top tier. Whether he ever found his woman or not, his concupiscence has been fulfilled. The eight-minute epic of Santa Esmeralda's ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" is the Animals classic via Latin disco, dissolving in an astonishingly complex string arrangement (well, for disco anyway). The Arctic reed-and-bells of Meiko Kaji's ""The Flower of Carnage"" ain't Baudelaire, but it gets the job done, Will Oldham-style: ""Begrieving snow falls in the dead morning/ Stray dog's howls and the footsteps of Geta pierce the air."" The remainder, and far superior, material is instrumental music cribbed from other movies. The best piece, Luis Bacalov's ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" (which accompanies the film's well-publicized anime sequence) is all operatic poltergeist sirens and campfire acoustic guitar. It's unabashedly plagiarized Ennio Morricone and, even then, deserves to be in the same sentence with him. The Bernard Herrmann theme to Twisted Nerve (the whistling nurse one) begins with whistle-while-we-work conviviality and flourishes into a demented shock of orchestral dread. Al Hirt's version of the Green Hornet theme is what ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" always promised to be, bearing the most ridiculous trumpet line since the theme to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Once the tortuous, dizzying riff ends, a strong sturdy tone emerges that, by the end, has started battling the initial trumpet for control of the song, concluding in a bop that grows dangerously close to free jazz. There are two slight, avoidable problems. Many will probably decry the RZA's lyrics to ""Ode to Oren Ishii"". I will concede that he did indeed rhyme ""Ishii"" with ""Japaneseshi."" For a few years now, RZA has been adopting the unconvincingly out-of-control emotional delivery of Ghostface Killah with the lyrical inanity of ODB. It should be hilarious; it probably is. Secondly, a lot of music from the movie is missing, which I normally wouldn't deign to mention except that in the case of a soundtrack that is more or less dedicated to Morricone mood, it's just senseless to leave out ""Death Rides a Horse"". Perhaps even more significantly, I have no idea what depraved mind neglected to include the greatest garage-rock song of all time, The Human Beinz's ""Nobody But Me"". It would not be overreacting to murder the criminal. Still, who cares? As this review testifies, I am not qualified to critique music. However, if you dislike more than a third of these songs, you are not qualified to listen to music.","The life of a hipster is arduous and complex, teeming with expensive haircuts, the obligation to buy the CDs the ...

Modern Hits EP,Andrew Broder,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43bb1335d7bf16988e5/1:1/w_160/e0cee3be.gif,2003-10-19 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1087-modern-hits-ep/,Dinkytown,"The concept is simple: take vocals from one track and superimpose them on another. From a purely theoretical stance, remixes of this sort are the most rudimentary, since the ""mix"" itself is defined as a crude binary: there are the vocals, and there are the non-vocals. De-mixed, then simply matched, the remix's essential incongruity stands naked. There's no mediation, as, say, a body of water offers a safe view of the sun, which is too bright for our eyes to look upon directly, and for this reason, whether it shocks, disgusts, or makes us laugh momentarily, a simple, unadorned remix always has a blinding deal of potency. By its very nature, then, the Modern Hits EP, a remix project in which Andrew Broder-- aka Minneapolis-based Ninja Tune artist Fog -- robs well-known hip-hop songs of their rhymes and resituates them before his musty lo-fi backdrops, at once surprises, delights, and disgusts the listener. Broder orphans six fierce rhymesayers-- Jay-Z, Nas, MF Doom, Outkast, Edan, and Kool G. Rap-- and doordrops each into completely unfamiliar territory; willed or not, they become Marlows floating down the snaked rivers of dark indie-pop jungles, and both the invader and the invaded are equally affected. Which is all well and good, but the ultimate question is this: Is there anything beyond the novelty? Are the remixes self-sufficient and interesting independent of their source material? Put crudely, is Broder's Modern Hits EP just a joke? To a certain extent, it is. All that actually makes these tracks interesting is that they very simply exploit the tension between testosterone-fueled rap boasts and Broder's quaint indie-folk instrumentation. Like any joke, each track loses its replay luster as its cleverness is unpacked, with hardly any substance lying beyond the initial jolt. But, that said, the jokes on Modern Hits are pretty brilliant, each remix unsettlingly clever for its apparent easiness, as Broder playfully subverts hip-hop's trademark taunt and confidence. ""The Whole World"" pits Outkast's vocal jingle against a shuffle-beat of piano, held organ, and an unwieldy, Athens-like collected chorus that redeems the original's warbly melody. In the countrified ""Drop Some Smooth Lyrics"", Broder square-dances with Edan to a strummed acoustic guitar ditty, replete with cowbell spatters and an insistent on-beat bass drum. MF Doom's vitriol in ""Ain't Nothing"" is neutralized by a vaguely new age shaker-groove of auxiliary percussion, Wurlitzer reeds, and a masterfully awful trumpet. Broder detours from the straightforward, too, indulging in an extreme abstraction of Kool G. Rap's ""On the Run"", in which film samples, guitar, and bass ""interpret"" the lyrics as they spew, reacting most notably to Kool's recounting of a drive-by with sampled bullet swipes and intense choral moans. While not the most enjoyable remix, it certainly comprises the album's most interesting and innovative, as Broder adds an unusual poignancy to lyrics that just as easily could have been parodied. While the other tracks are decidedly lo-fi and, to an extent, rhythmically unadventurous, Broder's take on Jay-Z's ""The Takeover"" bursts with energy from the outset, infusing the original's cool confidence with a menacing big beat and a frequent recurrences of skittery quasi-ragtime pianos catfighting one another outside a Charlie Chaplin saloon. The duel oddly mirrors Jay-Z's lyrical spray against rapper Nas, whose own remixed track, ""One Mic"", follows to close out the album, slow and inwardly motivated like the original. Herein lies Broder's grandest conceit: not only has he humorously juxtaposed the tracks of two arch-nemeses, but, by remixing both of them with such drastically variant but equally quirky approaches, he's relegated the two and their differences to utter inconsequence-- Jay's lyric, ""I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/ You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song,"" now boils with irony. Call it hubris or just stupid; either way, it's pretty funny, and displays a sense of humor we rarely see in independent music.","The concept is simple: take vocals from one track and superimpose them on another.

Sleep/Holiday,Gorky's Zygotic Mynci,by: Scott Plagenhoef,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf7ceb335119a49ed21c/1:1/w_160/a1c20c6f.jpg,2003-10-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3531-sleepholiday/,Sanctuary,"Between billy goats and the Bambino there's been a lot of talk about curses and the cursed in recent weeks. The idea that misfortune specifically follows some isn't limited to pro sports: Theater has the Macbeth curse, Hollywood has the curse of Superman, and politics has the curse of the Kennedys. In music, Screamin' Jay Hawkins put a spell on you, Bark Psychosis produced one frequently brilliant Hex, and we've learned that incanting the alarmingly un-PC ""Ooo eee/ Ooo ah ah/ Ting tang/ Walla walla bing bang"" was the way to win a woman's heart, but the closest there's been to any sort of supposed curse is the one claimed to follow ""Helter Skelter"". One band that could qualify as, at the very least, extremely unlucky is Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, who have the misfortune of holding the record for charting the most singles in the UK without reaching the top 40 (eight through this October). Gorky's just missed the mark by a few spots on three occasions and although, yeah, crashing it at #37 and dropping out the next week didn't make bands like Northern Uproar or Geneva household names, it couldn't have hurt for Gorky's to have gained the wide exposure that comes with breaking the seal of the top 40, and therefore appearing on the UK's nationally broadcast Official Chart Show and having the possibility of performing on Top of the Pops. On the cusp of breaking through, Gorky's retreated from spotlight seeking, major labels, and the whimsical psychedelia of their past. (Highlights of the first half of the band's career was compiled earlier this year on 20). The result has reaped some of their richest works-- Spanish Dance Troupe, The Blue Trees, and How I Long to Feel That Summer-- which together make a enchanting second act in the life of one of the most quietly satisfying bands of the past decade. On Sleep/Holiday, Gorky's continue to explore delicate pastoralisms (piano and violin are increasingly pronounced and serve as the foundation of much of the band's sound), albeit with slightly more mixed results than usual. Though still often warm and tender, Sleep/Holiday lacks the surprise or the diversity of some of their better work, and their one attempt to reconcile that (the single ""Mow the Lawn"") is stunted and forced, lacking the playful brisk smiles of previous rave-ups such as ""Spanish Dance Troupe"" or ""Poodle Rockin'"". It's an anomaly, however, and not indicative of why or how this record-- too much of which drifts along making a lovely sound without really sticking its hooks in you-- falls short of the band's other recent efforts,. A couple of those moodier pieces (the reflective waltz ""Single to Fairwater"" and the droning, hymnal ""Pretty as a Bee"") work, but too often songs pass without incident or interest. When things go right, Gorky's still make a positively lovely sound, particularly the gorgeous, plaintive opening pair, ""Happiness"" and ""Waking for Winter"", each of which-- along with the jaunty ""Eyes of Green, Green, Green""-- seems to chase and cast off the ghosts that haunted Gorky's on previous albums. The former is a soul-searching song about willing good things to happen to oneself after pain. On the latter, singer Euros Childs no longer longs for summer but becomes animated by the winter cold. After the sense of tangible, deep loss of Spanish Dance Troupe and the desire for warmth and comfort on their two subsequent records, Gorky's conjures a very autumnal sound and a long-rejected willingness to accept pain, cursed luck, and changes for the worst. Childs braces for winter in his recollections of former lovers, the departed, and missed opportunities. As the title indicates, he still harbors hopes for escape-- into dreams, to the south of France, to the country-- but those desires seem, and sound, overwhelmed by feelings of exhaustion.","Between billy goats and the Bambino there's been a lot of talk about curses and the cursed in recent ...

The Sublime And.,Tim Berne,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a280c0084474cd0c0067/1:1/w_160/c67747d3.jpg,2003-10-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/664-the-sublime-and/,Thirsty Ear,"Tim Berne's concert recordings consistently beat his work in the studio. Since the mid-90s he's released almost nothing but live albums-- there are no studio recordings of his Bloodcount or Paraphrase bands-- and his success with this unpredictable medium reflects a knack for running his bands through long, knotty works where they can stretch out without derailing: there are no slow parts, no wandering through the forest, no sections where the guys ring little bells or recite poetry. Of course, many great jazz albums have taken those risks, but Berne goes for reproducible results. Some jazz musicians improvise off of chord changes, others improvise over modes; Berne sounds like he's fueled entirely by his own momentum. Melodies fly across liquid ensemble passages that break into caustic soloing-- collisions between soloists, aggressive comping, drummers who knock around like they're ripping the floorboards out from under you. Separate compositions roll into each other like merging traffic, and the musicians can shred and extrapolate without evading the incessant pulse that sent them on their way. And although not every live Berne album is so intense, The Sublime And. ranks as one of the most relentless. The Science Friction band is an electronics-heavy four-piece that merges two of his trios: Hard Cell-- with the stupendous keyboardist and Fender Rhodes specialist Craig Taborn-- and Big Satan, with French post-Frisell guitar deconstructionist Marc Ducret. Both trios included Tom Rainey on drums; known for his more standards-focused work in Fred Hersch's trio, Rainey has been Berne's drummer on call for years, as far back as Paraphrase. Berne recorded this quartet for the Science Friction album on his own Screwgun label last year, and this double-album captures a complete concert in Winterthur, Switzerland, crossing album tracks with new material. As expected, this performance is louder, longer, and way more chaotic than the studio album; where that first record was intriguingly loopy and colorful, this set just smokes, propelling the band through longer sections and more frantic solos. Berne rips off especially fluid leads on alto sax, and he's courageously linear against the fireworks from his sidemen. When he's not adding color and effects with his laptop-- playing blustery wind samples over a tense sax solo, or throwing echo on Berne's high notes on ""Mrs. Subliminal""-- Taborn plays fierce solos on his Fender Rhodes and synths, with an especially aggressive turn on ""Jalapeño Diplomacy"" that's bolstered by riveting accompaniment from Rainey, an intuitive (and disruptive) drummer who's both impeccable and propulsive, especially in his own terse, focused solo on ""The Shell Game"". On this set, the best among equals may be Marc Ducret. Ducret has long had the maturity to slather color from his effects without becoming amorphous, but I've rarely heard him solo with such sheer velocity. Distorting and fragmenting his lines without veering a degree off-course, Ducret seems to deconstruct and rearrange his instrument in mid-air like a cyborg in an especially violent Japanese anime. There are a few shortcomings. Even though the compositional material works for this band, the melodies end up sounding far more alike than usual. And the album may actually be too busy: one of the only moments to reflect comes with Taborn's solo synth feature, ""Smallfry"", which is actually too ambient-- the hanging suspense in his sustained chords evokes images of a rock show, and you can almost picture Taborn in a silver cape in front of a smoke machine as he weaves a dramatic introduction to the next piece. For these minor reasons, The Sublime And. feels less definitive than, say, Unwound (the more-than-comprehensive three-disc Bloodcount record), or Paraphrase's Please Advise. But this is the strongest record he's made yet with an electric band-- and it's one of the fiercest and importantly, most inventive performances he's captured. The Sublime And. is essential for anyone looking for exhilaratingly original jazz music.","Tim Berne's concert recordings consistently beat his work in the studio.

Cuatro Caminos,Café Tacuba,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6dcc0084474cd0c0a79/1:1/w_160/0ff2eb2a.gif,2003-10-16 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1724-cuatro-caminos/,MCA,"I'm not going to hedge or deploy a bunch of circumlocutory phrases in this review. There's not going to be any stories of how I patronized the laundromat before I listened to this album. So, here, this is what you need to know: Café Tacuba is one of the best bands in the world. When their eponymous debut saw release in 1992, there was certainly an overwhelming supposition that Café Tacuba was destined for greatness, but by 1999's double-disc Reves/Yosoy, it was incontestably clear that this band deserved accolades of the highest order. Their latest, Cuatro Caminos, is one of the best albums. (That sentence was not missing a clause or specification.) Although the band sprang to life from the same movement that spawned Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Maldita Vecindad, most of the guitar lines on Cuatro Caminos are spiraling, elegiac edges that sound like vintage Pavement and Calexico. ""Cero y Uno"" introduces this tone, but things don't heat up till the simmering hootenanny ""Eo""-- a euphoric approximation of The Clash's ""Brand New Cadillac"" if it spat up sound effects and circus music atop dense polyrhythms in a Vegas sex shop. But Café Tacuba play two minutes of it and get out, switching instead to ""Mediodía"". The song fully captures the expressive elasticity of frontman Élfego Buendía's voice, which can be abrasively mocking and tender in the same utterance, converting every punk song into a ballad and vice-versa. A sea shanty that swells to incorporate chimes and orchestration amidst the cracking and murmuring of the floorboards, ""Mediodía"" is a lamenting dirge that never begins to approach melodrama. ""Qué Pasará"" creates a sort of ska-metal that sounds far better than my term for it. I'm not going to deceive anyone; there's a lot of ska here. But even The Clash had to play a few reggae songs now and then, and this ain't your father's third-wave; ""Recuerdo Prestado"" is a menacing bounce that erodes into a catastrophe of a solo. There are two startling Indian-influenced breaks on the album (both of which, yes, employ tape loops and backwards guitars). The first is the chorus to ""Camino y Vereda""; the second is the Irish-Indian folksong ""Hola Adiós"" (the name is a clear allusion to ""Hello Goodbye""). ""Eres"" is unabashedly classic 70s rock, a sun-splattered villa with the best Spanish guitar line in a rock song since Naked Raygun's ""Vanilla Blue"". The epic centerpiece, ""Encantamiento IxFAtil"", begins with sparse, echoing piano and plaintive humming before Joselo Rangel unleashes a cuttingly frosty guitar line that, by itself, eclipses most of the last Godspeed album. Indeed, Café Tacuba is a band that fully acknowledges its debt to other musical legacies while remaining true to their own wholly unique vision. There are undoubtedly a few problems, or a potential for problems, on the album. ""Puntos Cardinales"" bends terrifyingly close to bad Björk territory, but is salvaged when the chorus turns into the strangest disco hit never to come out of 1979, and ""Soy o Estoy"" is too insignificant and cute to matter in the company of the rest of these songs. The album's not terribly coherent, either, as a result of its diversity-- there are songs on here that make little to no sense upon first listen (""Tomar el Fresco,"" ""Eo""), but rarely any moment at which this iconoclasm undermines the group's melodiousness. Yet, despite its minor flaws, Cuatro Caminos ranks among the most innovative and soulful full-lengths to see release this year, the rare albums on which a fantastically popular group with a firm grasp of their direction and sound is able to produce some of their most memorable and mesmerizing songs without sacrificing any of their experimentation and audacity.","I'm not going to hedge or deploy a bunch of circumlocutory phrases in this review.

Old,Starflyer 59,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5409d034d5c69bf326e/1:1/w_160/9f8ee055.jpg,2003-10-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7463-old/,Tooth and Nail,"This label and I have a serious history. Interested? Glad to hear it. So just sit tight while I tear a page from my riveting autobiography: (p. 147)
Summer of '95. A quorum of my closest adolescent friends travels to Orlando for a community-sponsored Youth Group excursion and summarily return home, one and all: Saved! Born Again! It was just supposed to be a quick ticket out of our one-stoplight cultural abyss, but as it turned out, I didn't know the meaning of the word ""insular."" Next thing I know, it's Saturday night and I'm getting hauled to shuddersome teen-catered fireside Bible-socials and being told to trash my entire (!) record collection. My recently recalibrated friends had already done it. ""Christian waters never run tepid."" It was all or nothing. And there, Tooth & Nail, you were: steadfast and ice cold. You held all the answers, didn't you? Yep, for every successful and visionary secular band or movement, there was a carefully manicured response from the Christian music industry. I should know: I heard every one. (And by all means, feel free to put the test to any of the following suppositions.) For My Bloody Valentine there was Morella's Forrest; for Pavement: Sal Paradise; for Operation Ivy: Squad Five-0; and the sonic equivalent to the Mighty Mighty Bosstones? Why, the skalvation offerings of The O.C. Supertones! Naturally. In truth, listening in on this stuff wasn't a total waste of time. Athens' own Summer Hymns supplanted the late, Zachary Gresham-led Joe Christmas, and I still spin each Damien Jurado record I own. Furthermore, just last month I rediscovered one of T&N;'s founding compatriots and venerable torchbearers: Jason Martin's Starflyer 59. Old, his eighth studio album is both a celebratory nod to mid-90s shoegaze pop and a successful grasp of the current fiber-optic-sparkled baton. Granted, he might not have a solitary death grip on any one industry spec, but he's definitely off and running in the right direction. While his earliest releases were loosely wound, distorted MBV-tinged guitar-pop excursions, Martin's most recent recordings are sharper, more deeply melodic, and starkly atmospheric. Each of the ten tracks on Old carry a heretic regality that counter-intuitively sharpens the vintage tones of mid-90s shoegaze rock while fabricating purebred vitality and ripened accruement within a familiar pop construct. Most of the songs-- highlighted by the simpering and mid-paced (yet stellar) ""Passenger"", and the sterile luminosity of the piano-driven title track-- will leave a Grandaddy aftertaste in your mouth. The songs are mortally aware, as evidenced both in the lyrics and epic, reaching tones, which, thankfully, never venture into postmortem deliverance territory or carry burdensome testimonial weight. Midway, the album slowly eases into a comfortable, crystalline canter, sinking off the coast of the album's earlier successes. The opener, ""Underneath"", brashly delivers campy yet self-assured guitar-rhythms and minor new-wave progressions laced with sweeping synths to great fortune. The final third of the song interfaces earlier, jostling elements into a singularly grand swing of momentum and a perfectly executed outro, lush with rolling drums and a background chorus of devilish nirvana. Martin's breathy, overcast vocals perfectly lace the song (the entire effort, really) with almost goth-like murkiness. But perhaps the highlight of the album, rather than any specific moment, is its ability to retain a congruous vision without ever growing stale within the confines of its own sonic inclinations. Each nuanced revelation has enough character to shine on its own, shuffling through spacious melodies and contracted moments of alloyed potency. The biggest departure here comes with the flawless fusion of the closing track, ""First Heart Attack"", where a grandiose 70s Pink Floyd/Moody Blues stratospheric electric digression effortlessly retreats back into a lost Grandaddy acoustic ambit, in candid surrender to fate: ""It's when I have my first heart attack/ And I can't even breathe/ You tell the truth, I know you wouldn't lie/ That I'm on my last beat."" For all its thematic resignation, though, Old is no response to any secular undertaking, past or present, or cool acceptance of systemic classification. After ten years, the band surely isn't looking to break out-- even if the notion is long overdue. If you can overlook all the potential prefabricated pitfalls of such a release, sooner or later it'll hit you like it hit me: I'll be damned if this ain't a helluva solid record.","This label and I have a serious history.

Rememberese EP,The Stills,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a643c0084474cd0c0906/1:1/w_160/7e034c58.jpg,2003-10-16 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7717-rememberese-ep/,Vice,"So there I was, circa '88, pedal to the floor of my Dad's Oldsmobile Firenza, a girl I had the heavy hots for riding shotgun, her long black hair flitting through the cracked window into the summer night. We were headed to a keg party in the parking lot of a hockey arena. Things looked promising. I forget most of what happened at the party, only that the girl, who bore a striking resemblance to the actress Jami Gertz of The Lost Boys, disappeared with some other guy. And that was the end of that. The point in mentioning this is, it's precisely the type of nostalgia-- bittersweet, foggy, mythic-- that's elicited by The Stills, a four-piece Montreal band whose slithery, sentimental rock bridges the divide between post-punk and 80s pop balladry. The story goes like this (with some embellishments for narrative effect): a few years ago, young Tim and his erstwhile pal Dave happen upon a four-track, which they decide to buy. Money is scarce, but they're auteurs, and so they make the sacrifice. Tim and Dave agree to take turns using the machine, promising to listen to one another's music with a mind towards an eventual collaborative project. Some time passes. Tim and Dave both have doubts, but they soldier on, making music as true to the spirit of their stylistic forebears, Echo & The Bunnymen, as possible. Slowly, they begin to realize that investing in the machine wasn't such a silly idea after all. To their astonishment, ""a like-minded songwriting aesthetic"" develops. After enlisting two buddies, Greg and Oliver, they form a band, play a few gigs in New York City, and before they know it, they're signed to Vice Records, home to Mancunian rapper The Streets. Fame and snorting blow off a hooker's breasts lay just around the corner. Unfortunately, The Stills have a way to go before realizing that last part of the story. While the four songs on Rememberese (one song is a remix of another) are, for the most part, subtle, unpretentious pop odes that plunge the listener into a blissful, nostalgic revelry, they're far from the ear-catching, inventive material of a truly great band. For example, the opener ""Still in Love Song"" is driven by an infectious hook and Tim Fletcher's solemn, Ian Curtis-like drone, but sounds all too familiar, simplistic, and ultimately leads nowhere. Ditto for ""Killer Bees"", which veers dangerously close to becoming an Interpol sound-alike. Same frenetic guitar, crashing cymbals and distorted vocals. There's a lesson in this which, like most things, is found in Deuteronomy: Don't worship your idols; it violates the pursuit of innovation. A recent analogy: On one side you got the people who say the Space Elevator (a 60,000 mile elevator stretching into space, made of a fantastically light but durable material called nanotubes) is impossible to build, and on the other side you got the people who say ""screw it"" and just build the motherfucker. Point being, you have to leap off the path to reason in order to achieve the remarkable. ""Talk to Me"", by far the best song on Rememberese, eschews the ornate, textbook 80s pop/rock and instead delivers an edgy, pants-around-the-ankles eulogy to a 900-number lover. Fletcher intones, ""The bored person's nightmare/ Crying crocodile tears.../ Did I blow your mind tonight/ Did I make it alright.../ Be sure to call.../ Talk all you want."" I've been there. Hey, who hasn't? Greg Paquet's strumming and Dave Hamelin's drumming add balls to the rhythm, and a synthesizer carves out a nice place for itself on the chorus. This song really grows on you. With any luck, this is the direction that The Stills are headed. Otherwise, the dream has ended before it really began.","So there I was, circa '88, pedal to the floor of my Dad's Oldsmobile Firenza, a girl I had ...

They couldn't go to their local supermarket and pick out what to eat for dinner: there weren't any pre-packaged, sterile cuts of brontosaurus ribs. Cavemen had to stalk the creatures that looked like they could be caught and eaten, and that wouldn't poison or infect them once consumed. Cavemen had to take a chance. Cavemen had to brave the little voice inside of their head, whispering: ""Throw spear at giant friend-eater? Get eaten like friend. Don't throw spear at giant friend-eater. Find easier food."" But some cavemen went out and killed that dangerous food anyway. With that said, The Austerity Program have murdered the beast that is normalcy. By taking a guitar, a bass, and a drum machine, Justin Foley and Thad Calabrese have concocted a four-track EP that seethes lyrical belligerence and scrapes by on a minimal number of elements. Recorded in a church basement-- where the elders no doubt peeked on with trepidation as the duo beat on their instruments and wailed like Jesus must have when the nails were driven in-- this music perfects repetition: Soggy basslines drip from frozen fingers as notes find refuge against the drum machine's plodding kick and snare. Feet stamp through puddles in time with the beat, canines gnashing into lips through the awkward strangling of the guitar. Breath twists into a gasping scream as air is pushed thin of sound. Each of Terra Nova's untitled tracks last upwards of eight minutes, the band relentlessly dragging their victims around frozen tundra with jagged teeth: ""Black her out and drag her down the stairs/ Drag her out into the cold/ Blood is dripping on into the streets/ She's halfway gone to god."" Each song writhes under its tormentors hands, giant crevasses of silence only procured by the slight popping of a bassline or the murmur of the guitar. On the opening track, the cymbal picks monotonously for a brief moment until guitar and bass enter the room in a tussle, each side getting in equal damage. The cymbal returns, warning the two of dire consequences, but is immediately cut off with squabbling and a quick middle finger. Finally, a conflict ensues with all parties enraged, from which the vocals emerge triumphant. Parched from the frozen pipes, the voice lunges and cries with little care for the damage ultimately caused. Wavering at the top of the exhalation, the peak is reached only to come tumbling back down in a violent display of guitar-fucking action: as the members put their backs into it, the instruments thud from the dry humps received. Each thrust from the fingers and the pelvis wrench out disdain and ire: ""But what is blood without its oxygen/ But the water of death sick on its own disease."" Gushing choruses melt from the dawdling lines of the bridges for a violent tumult of rapids the listener must ford. And it goes on like this throughout the EP: sparse snippets of guitar interplay with bluesy white boy vocals screeching like a puberty-riddled Steve Albini until they finally figure out what to do with an erection when no one's looking: start milking it to the good stuff for about twenty seconds, and once they can't take anymore: POP. Time to clean up the chorus before Dad knocks on the door to see what all the ruckus is about.","Cavemen had to hunt for their food.

While Talking EP,Ms. John Soda,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fcc0084474cd0c35be/1:1/w_160/0a4cf4f5.gif,2003-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5486-while-talking-ep/,Morr,"Emerging late last year from the Weilheim, Germany camp that gave birth to The Notwist, Lali Puna, and Tied and Tickled Trio, Ms. John Soda's debut full-length presented a more sterilized, female adaptation of The Notwist's delicate pop compositions-- all skittering clicks and cuts urgently panning from speaker to speaker, purring electric synthtones and serene cyborg vocals, courtesy of singer Stefanie Böhm (a former member of the post-rock ensemble Couch). Judging from the sound of their new EP, While Talking, they've switched gears. Which isn't necessarily a bad idea in premise-- No P. or D., at a scant eight tracks, seemed perfect in length, and another eight along the same lines could quickly grow tiring. It's their choice of direction that mystifies. The most immediately detectable difference from Ms. John Soda's debut is that Böhm rarely sings-- rather, she adopts a breathy speaking approach clearly indebted to Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon. Musically, there's not much difference; it's all in the production: the disc has shifted from luminescent neon glow into rougher-edged territory, liberally employing distortion and sharper instrumentation. Though it's an interesting experiment, it rarely pays off. Of course, it's difficult to tell whether that's due to the duo's lack of experience working with harsher sounds or to the general weakness of the tracks themselves. I might be able to see it working out if their forthcoming full-length is more focused. While Talking, however, jumps erratically from straightforward rock-and-roll, to unmotivated post-rock, to aimless mood pieces, to fleeting reprises of the duo's original sound. In a sense, Ms. John Soda have masked their two strongest traits: Böhm's delicate alto and Micha Acher's pop sensibilities. It's difficult to praise the lyrics of a non-native English-speaking songwriter-- the only recent possible exception being Norway's Sondre Lerche-- but often poor lyrical content can be redeemed by a strong voice and melody. Böhm situated herself firmly in this territory on the duo's last record, and that's all too clear on songs like the opener, ""No. One,"" which have Böhm uttering such inanities as, ""The things you say are forgotten. What did you say?"" without the support of her charming pop hooks. The music backing her-- a dynamic rock soundtrack stuffed with Weilheim organ whirls, bowed cello, moody electronics, and a percussive rattle that one might liken to the sound of a seashell necklace-- nearly makes up for it, but the juxtaposition of Böhm's vocal delivery and the gravelly rock textures is just too jarring. ""Sometimes Stop, Sometimes Go"" nominally implies disjointedness, and as such, the track sees Ms. John Soda not intertwine, but sequence, one after another, an almost Interpol-ish guitar interval riff, and the gentle, and more familiar piano and vocals of No P. or D. For better or worse, the song showcases how cosmic a difference there is between Böhm's singing and speaking voices. ""If Someone Would Know"", meanwhile, is a self-indulgent, poorly considered drone experiment that poorly utilizes the faraway piano lines and skittery whirls it introduces, and ""I Think It Could Work, Marylin"" suspends guitar chords and floating organ tones behind the fantastically awful dialogue of its characters Elvis and Marylin, both speaking roles assumed by Böhm. The piece sounds much more like the soundtrack to an art student's introductory film class project than a proper song, possibly because it is: the duo have included a mostly vapid music video for the song on the EP. While Talking's only non-original composition is ""I & #8217"", a remix medley of tracks from No P. or D. by Anticon member Subtle. The opening moments pit typewriter clicks against accordion and cello retakes and Böhm's vocal from ""Technicolor"", inviting a rumbly bass from time to time and dropping into a dark verbal spar of ""I don't want to see you techni-nothing-colored."" It traverses typical Anticon terrain, with drawn-out vocals, saxophones, and looped cut-ups atop a molasses beat and beaten accordion. The possibilities for this undertaking were enormous, and while comprising the most interesting on the disc, ""I & #8217"" is actually somewhat tame, especially considering Anticon's ear for the eerie. Though EPs are a format well-suited to trial-and-error, Ms John Soda have entirely neglected their greatest attributes here. While Talking can count a few successes-- one fairly good rock tune (""No. One""), one half-interesting remix, and one mostly entertaining music video for the one aforementioned fairly good rock tune-- but its bombs are tragic. If all things Weilheim strike your fancy, including the scene's mediocrities and failures, While Talking should find a comfortable space on your CD shelf: right next to The Notwist's debut album.","Emerging late last year from the Weilheim, Germany camp that gave birth to The Notwist, Lali Puna, and Tied\n ...

Aztec Discipline,Kingsbury Manx,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb1ea9e61561daa72ce/1:1/w_160/b88cc1e0.jpg,2003-10-15 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4453-aztec-discipline/,Overcoat,"Chapel Hill-based quartet The Kingsbury Manx start and finish their third full-length by expanding upon what critics and fans found so engaging in their out-of-leftfield successful self-titled debut. Initially seen mainly as purveyors of atmospheric psych-folk, the band has since studiously expanded its range, venturing into more conventional midtempo indie territory with a few flashes of more centralized alt-country inflections. Aztec Discipline, brimming with nascent virtuosity, retains the spacious, creeping, melody-glutted sensibilities of their previous albums, but hints that their best material may yet be unrealized-- here, they retain all of their earlier strengths (intelligent, breathy vocals, lush harmonies, a certain vintage) while branching out into more frolicsome territory. The album openers, ""Pelz Komet"" and ""Crowler in the Rumbleseat"", nearly skip off the CD with candid pop immediacy and adroit craftsmanship. Both spring forward, showcasing several distinct melodies, which gives the impression that you've just heard four songs in eight minutes. The prior glides into a steady acoustic rhythm before it spins off an angled electric guitar jam and discharges with a stuttered finale of piano driven buoyancy and recurrent utterances of, ""Time is all your own when go it alone and there's no one there to tell you when you're already home so don't wait another second/ Take a step in that direction."" The latter slides between similarly upbeat propulsion and a gorgeous sidestepped guitar progression coupled with Brian Wilson inflected layered harmonies. Think of a hepped up Radar Brothers with an engaged sense of levity. Familiar dreamy meditation and gentler affinities befall the middle third of the album. Though no songs truly falter, none equally parallel the level of excellence established by the first two. ""Grape to Grains"" finds the band wading in textured Brit-country waters, with slide and acoustic tones twinkling above placid, low-mix harmonies. The biggest departure is likewise the biggest speed bump; the aimless distortion of ""De-Da Dementia"" conspicuously finds the song playing the band, rather than the other way around. The Kingsbury Manx's most realized moments are spun when the band is fully in control, playing with a confident, structured melodic discernment and clear-cut vision. Such is the case with tenth-frame ""Fixed Bayonets"", a laidback confluence of sleepy harmony, banjo and guitar. This, along with a few other flares of effortless excellence, showcase the band's true potential. Curiously, The Kingsbury Manx released a separate five-song effort, Afternoon Owls, a mere month before Aztec Discipline's release, comprised of sturdy, well-seasoned and multi-textured efforts, with a near perfect pitch. Though a commonly propagated conviction, if narrowed down to an EP's worth of material and collated with the best of Afternoon Owls, a near perfect album is quietly tucked away. As is, the mirth we're left to soak in is as high a yield as most efforts in this sonic realm: smooth, relaxed, and rustic music put together with tender lovin' care.","Chapel Hill-based quartet The Kingsbury Manx start and finish their third full-length by expanding upon what critics and fans found ...

Hymns for the Hopeless,William Elliott Whitmore,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa875e6ef959693215db/1:1/w_160/a36967cf.jpg,2003-10-15 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8762-hymns-for-the-hopeless/,Southern,"When Iron & Wine's Sam Beam was inadvertently outed as an affable film professor from a Miami university, quizzical glances began whizzing across record store floors almost immediately, as packs of perplexed fans attempted to reconcile Beam's gritty, unpretentious four-track folk to his thong-friendly, neon pink surroundings. Luckily, neo-blues banjo-crooner William Elliott Whitmore's hometown address checks out alright: Whitmore was raised in a small Iowa locale dug deep into the banks of the mighty, cred-bestowing Mississippi, thereby making it forever safe to presume his banjo theatrics and whiskey-drenched mumble have been, um, authentically rendered. Breathe easy. Hymns for the Hopeless is Whitmore's proper debut, but his relaxed, porch-singer poses suggest he'd been playing the bedroom-poet game long before these compositions were being officially documented: Hymns pairs Whitmore's deep, throaty vocals with scratchy banjo and skittering harmonica, and the subsequent songs seem both intensely indebted (see Leadbelly, Doc Watson, and the grisly, murder-and-redemption narratives of Johnny Cash) and oddly anachronistic-- an artful, evocative fusion of bellowed country, sheepish folk, and filthy blues, as unexpected as it is familiar. Percussion (usually delivered via handclap, and provided by Lucas Tweedy or the fantastically named Michael Cornelius Lust) occasionally breaks in, as does organ, bass, and some acoustic and brass finger guitar, but for the most part, Hymns is a one-man show-- and Whitmore's thick, easier-than-Waits growl is, fortunately, dynamic enough to carry nearly all of that burden. The record opens with an a capella lament to lifeless hearts (""Cold and Dead"") that might fare better had it been buried a little deeper in; Whitmore's concentrated voice takes time to acclimate to, and ""Cold and Dead"", with a little over three minutes of pure, uninterrupted warble, can be a sort of overwhelming introduction. ""Sometimes Our Dreams Float Like Anchors"" is a lilting, bang-and-whimper parable (check Whitmore's prophesizing: ""I'll be free when I'm dead"") told by way of slinging hammers and completed by feisty drum rolls, well-timed bings, and Whitmore's persuasively sweet strumming. ""From the Cell Door to the Gallows"" is Whitmore at his best: spare banjo plucks and a meandering vocal melody showcase his soulful, honest intentions and proclivity for wearied sighs. Authenticity, regardless of its relative worth, is bound to be a big issue for Whitmore, mostly because Hymns borrows so heavily from its Delta predecessors, and does so in a way that's not particularly apologetic. He tackles the proper poetic terrain-- slow, sad songs about drinking, loving, losing, devils, and shotguns-- letting his voice quiver, bend, and purr just like his backyard river, rushing in all the right spots. So even if Hymns occasionally seems like paint-by-numbers blues, it's also an astoundingly well-rendered likeness, teeming with unmistakably genuine hollers and cries.","When Iron & Wine's Sam Beam was inadvertently outed as an affable film professor from a Miami university, quizzical glances ...

Merge,Ken Ikeda,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9979d034d5c69bf5268/1:1/w_160/1e531aea.jpg,2003-10-15 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4148-merge/,Touch,"Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that I would spend so much of my time alone in a room listening to sine waves. The sine wave is the cleanest, simplest tone possible-- just a pitch, no harmonics, no timbre. It's the stuff of physics classes and test records, but for most of my life, it was not the stuff of music. All that's changed. I've spent many hours in the last couple years with at least a half-dozen records built primarily from sine waves. Some of these I've listened to by choice (Ryoji Ikeda's +/-) some out of review obligation (So Takahashi's 30/30); regardless, I've put in my time with the pure cycle. I can't help but notice that most of the sine wave-based music I've heard comes from Japan. I'm sure it has something to do with the essentialism of the culture. I've seen Zen line drawings and I've read haiku, so I'm not surprised that Japanese musicians have an interest in the sine wave. For Merge, his second full-length album, Tokyo's Ken Ikeda claims to have constructed the record from a ""sound diary"" he's kept since 1990. This stockpile of tapes consists of ""fragmental pieces of sound reflecting my everyday life over these years."" Only a Japanese musician would have a 12-year sound diary consisting primarily of sine wave tones. ""Merge"" and ""Lightdark"", the first two tracks on the album, are the cleanest; both are essentially simple drones with just a faint hint of pitch and textural movement. They're nice enough if you go for this sort of thing, but they ultimately serve as a prelude to better material. With ""Cityscape"", Ikeda delves into more interesting territory. Like the first two tracks, sine wave drones are the primary focus, but here they serve as what I can only describe as a sheer ""curtain"" that hangs in front of the primary melody. The pitch-perfect sounds draw your attention, but if you listen more deeply you can hear what is really the guts of the track taking shape in the background. This obscuring effect is even more pronounced on ""No Beginning Nor End"". I doubt Ikeda designed this track with my physiology in mind, but ""No Beginning Nor End"" has a drone somewhere in the 1.5k range, which happens to establish a perfect standing wave in my ear canal. The air in my ear resonates loudly at this pitch no matter what volume I select, which artfully obscures a music-box melody and light drumming happening somewhere in the murky corners of the track. I'm reminded of Luis Buñuel's observation about film that every object in the frame obscures an object behind it. Arranging material in space is the art of deciding what to obscure and how. Ikeda uses his sine wave tones to arrange sound in a three-dimensional space, so that it lies behind (not just underneath) the primary tone in front. As Merge progresses the character of the album shifts and sound become more complex. The cluster of tones that tumble about randomly in ""Gate"" have the chime of bells, and ""Usual Path"" inverts the special relationship of ""No Beginning Nor End"", putting the metallic percussion in the foreground and burying the drone. The changes are subtle, but after 11 tracks and 55 minutes, you do feel like you've been on a journey, even if you haven't traveled terribly far. Twenty feet is a long way if you're a snail. (Who said that? Basho?) In any event, listen to Merge a few times and I'm sure you'll find a koan in there somewhere. It's that kind of music.","Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that I would spend so much of my time alone in ...

Sweetheart of the Rodeo [Legacy Edition],The Byrds,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41b9d034d5c69bf2faf/1:1/w_160/3467ca9a.gif,2003-10-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1059-sweetheart-of-the-rodeo-legacy-edition/,ColumbiaColumbia,"A confession: I have totally fallen for this Gram Parsons mythology. Indoctrinated by years of biased textbooks, hippies' hyperbolic eulogies, and Entertainment Weekly features (a Johnny Knoxville/Christina Applegate biopic currently entitled Grand Theft Parsons is due next year), I have venerated Parsons to the point where, back in '91, my Parsons figurine necklace saved my life when I should have been shot in the neck. I know he was a narcissistic, condescending, uncontrollable malcontent, probably undeserving of most of my praise. I don't care. Every martyr has his cross. Jesus' was made of wood; Parsons' was made of morphine, booze, and Cosmic Morphoid Crazydust (or some such opiate). A Harvard drop-out, Parsons met Byrds bassist Chris Hillman at an unromantic Hollywood bank, coerced him into joining the Crosby-less band in Nashville, and, amidst quiet feuding with Roger McGuinn, made what is deniably one of the Top 20 country records of all time. Today, no noteworthy reviewer is naïve enough to claim Sweetheart of the Rodeo was the first country-rock album. Instead they'll tell you it was Parsons' International Submarine Band's 1968 album Safe at Home, and maybe that they even have the receipts to prove it. But, while Parsons was more of a heroin addict than a pedagogue, if he's taught me anything, it's that there was no ""first"" country-rock record. Country has always rocked. When Hank Williams sang, ""I'll never get out of this world alive,"" he paved the way for Sid Vicious. If anything, Sweetheart is vastly less rocking than Merle Haggard's late-60s albums-- Parsons was simply the first to disseminate the rock to North Hollywood and Keith Richards' mansion. The actual album is a blindingly rusty gait through parched weariness and dusted reverie. It's not the natural sound of Death Valley or Utah, but rather, a false portrait by people who wished it was, which makes it even more melancholy and charismatic. Between the shuffling and galloping are the astonishingly doomed harmonies, McGuinn and Parson's hypnotic and enthusiastic vocals, and countless miles of Lloyd Green's pedal steel. The songs, mostly covers, are equally saturated in sincerity and dedication. McGuinn had originally conceived the album as a panorama of American genres from the turn of the century through the synthesizer era until Parsons and Hillman convinced him to focus solely on country. Still, the diversity is there: a plucking Woody Guthrie, a craggy, grisly Haggard, post-motorcycle Dylan, Stax/Volt genius William Bell. But The Byrds have so totally captured a particular sound that the transitions are seamless. The righteousness of ""The Christian Life"" is perfectly at home on an album with a song about murdering your wife. The crucial aspects of this particular release, however, are the extras-- especially since an expanded edition already came out in 1997 highlighting some unreleased master tapes. This new double-disc version is about double the price, and somehow managed to miss a few tracks from the '97 version. It also claims everything's been remastered without sounding at all distinguishable from the last edition. To be fair, the second disc offers six International Submarine Band songs (three of which have never been available on CD), but even these are valuable mainly for historians and best heard in the context of the entire Safe at Home album. Suffice to say, it's an underdeveloped band that can occasionally stun you into submission (the steaming ""Luxury Liner"", or the waltzing tribute to monogamy and masculinity, ""Strong Boy"") and other times sound like a disorderly, if endearing, garage-rock band with way too much emphasis on tambourine. Due to contractual obligations, Lee Hazlewood, founder of the LHI label, took all but three Parsons tracks off the original album-- although, by all accounts, he was the auteur of the entire recording. Parsons has come back here with a vengeance: For starters, 19 of the 28 supplementary tracks feature Parsons on lead vocal. Whether you think this package is worthwhile is entirely dependent on whether you think Parsons deserves this much credit. On the album itself, McGuinn's belabored, satirical vocal on ""The Christian Life"" is adequate, even beautiful, performed like a pop star who sings odes to woe while showering in hundred-dollar bills. Conversely, Parsons sounds like he's had a bloody nose for a week on the bonus track presented here, giving the song a more sincere read than McGuinn's obvious pisstake. He's also drunk and has the stuttered, cracking delivery of someone who was self-schooled in a sand dune (which is strange considering he was a spoilt egoist). Of course, this begs the question of who exactly needs four relatively-similar sounding versions of ""The Christian Life"" or ""One Hundred Years from Now"". Well, I do. I've been listening to those songs on repeat for years now. Finally, I can mix things up a bit. While there are significant, if not epiphanic, variations in the second disc's working demos and rehearsals, the causal Parsons fan will certainly be satiated by the '97 single disc. If you're a Gram man, on the other hand, listening to the gradual development of the plaintiveness on ""One Hundred Years from Now"" or the original sluggishness on ""Life in Prison"" is equivalent to bowing at Parsons' altar. Only die-hards will find the second disc worthwhile. But then, everyone should be a die-hard.",,9.7,
Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn,Do Make Say Think,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e4ea9e61561daa70cf/1:1/w_160/57d859e9.jpg,2003-10-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2400-winter-hymn-country-hymn-secret-hymn/,Constellation,"The great director Sidney Lumet wrote in his autobiography that the optimal way to divide any film is into thirds, each with its own distinct mood, thrust and pace. It's a concept that works wonderfully in his own films, and the one I've seen that makes the best use of it is Dog Day Afternoon, in which Al Pacino and an associate botch a bank robbery and wind up presiding over a hostage situation that grows gradually more intense as the film progresses. You may not notice the way the film is broken down until reading about how Lumet used everything from lighting and lens filters to the pace of the action and the timing of plot twists in a very deliberate way to alter the way the scenario makes you feel. This aesthetic can naturally be transposed onto other art forms, but until the late 1980s, recorded music by and large wasn't one of them. Albums were split in half, divided into side A and side B-- and indeed, a lot of albums try to emulate that breakdown even in the CD age. But if there's one thing CDs gave artists as a medium, it's greater flexibility in sequencing and flow, and every once in a while, I notice that same thirds phenomenon (though it stands to reason that most bands aren't quite as calculating about it as Lumet was). A favorite example of mine is Blur's 13, which I've always heard as three ""movements,"" for lack of a better term: the first third is boisterous and direct, the middle third is weird and obscure, and the final third is something of a meeting of the two, a sort of reconciliation of extremes. Toronto collective Do Make Say Think (or as I enjoy calling them, The Action Verbs) have hit on this rather directly on their newly released fourth album, Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn. The title and sequencing imply a series of three suites, each with its own prevailing mood and feel, and each third is subsequently subdivided into thirds again, with long, developed pieces flanking ambient interludes. It works perfectly, too, as it allows the band to corral the growing diversity of their sound into a format that makes a lot of sense. Since the release of their dub-influenced self-titled debut, Do Make Say Think have dramatically varied their sound, increasingly utilizing deeper layers and more complex development with each subsequent release, and Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn's first third is immediately more volatile than anything they've done yet: it unfurls chiming guitars over a strange, melting bass figure before bursting into a nearly joyful groove built on scattered drumming and elastic bass. The track straightens out slowly, as horns and distortion build to a head and finally grind themselves to a halt, leaving space for a slow build back into dissonant mayhem, and ultimately turning full circle back to the chiming guitars that began things so calmly nearly ten minutes earlier. ""War on Want"" serves as the pivot into ""Auberge le Mouton Noir"", a bed of quivering strings that the latter song buries under brilliant bursts of repetitive guitar before unexpectedly lurching forward into driving rhythms and whirling fragments of melody. The middle of the album expands on the formula established in the first third, to very different effect. Rising from a freezer blast of icy texture on a pulsing bass, ""Outer & Inner Secret"" is at first hushed and unhurried, but the band's collective swells can only be contained for so long, and at the five-minute mark, they slip into a morass of arguing guitars over a punk march drumbeat. Unearthly slide guitars rise at the end to forecast ""107 Reasons Why"", a brief, velvety horn and guitar segue into ""Ontario Plates"", a staggering instrumental that sags under sax and horns, dragging along guitar parts that sound like some sort of post-rock Christmas carol. But the final third is the most crushing. ""Horns of a Rabbit"" rises over cymbal, a looped guitar part, electronic squiggles, hymnal organ and a massive drum beat, and just when it feels like it's rising to another loud climax, it retreats to a quiet heartbeat and strummed guitar. From there, the track builds in rhythm and volume, dragging along sharply distorted guitars blaring and violins until it glitches out, channels cutting, instruments bailing, and impassive noise overtaking everything. The noise is called ""It's Gonna Rain"", and it from the sound and title of it, I'm guessing it was composed mostly of the processed sound of rain hitting a tin roof. Finale ""Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"" organizes slowly, finally coalescing into a pretty acoustic guitar and horn serenade brushed by distorted slide guitar and wavering synth. The acoustic instruments beautify the noise that surrounds them, and the music is almost triumphant by the time it hits its closing decrescendo. In Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn, Do Make Say Think have presented us with their best work yet, a varied and unpredictable album capable of imparting the chill of the winter and the warmth of celebratory joy to you without ever presenting you with a human voice. The way the band breaks up the action makes the album equally digestible as a whole or in three discreet parts taken separately, which is especially nice when you're short on time to just sit and listen to the whole thing. Here, Do Make Say Think have nearly perfected themselves, and made a fantastic album in the process.","The great director Sidney Lumet wrote in his autobiography that the optimal way to divide any film is into thirds ...

Pressure,The Bug,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43a5e6ef9596932080d/1:1/w_160/aa3e891f.jpg,2003-10-14 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1086-pressure/,Tigerbeat6,"One of the more common criticisms of Jamaica's music from those who don't typically listen to it is that it's monolithic. That it all. Sounds. The. Same. I can't remotely agree with the sentiment, but those who have this idea in their head don't often care to reconcile with the possibility that they may be mistaken. There's no such problem on Pressure, as The Bug skulks around the dancehall underground working with a variety of sounds and vocalists. He takes a distinctly outsider's view to the genre and scene, blending it with elements of his own dubby ambient work and other white-boy dancehall crossovers-- German Basic Channel-esque minimalism, hard-edged beats, and ruff-in-the-jungle ragga. Calling The Bug a Jamaican artist is, naturally, a fallacy in the first place. It's one of many pseudonyms for Kevin Martin, who also worked in Sonic Boom's space-rock collective EAR and who, with Justin K. Broadrick, creates ambient techno as Techno Animal and hip-hop as Ice, among other projects. Despite his restless genre-hopping, Martin has enjoyed his greatest successes working with elements of dub sounds and processes, most notably his first album as The Bug (1997's Tapping the Conversation-- yes, named for the Coppola film) and his work as the curator of the landmark Macro Dub Infection compilations. On Pressure, Martin's exploration of the wildly creative and vital sounds of contemporary dancehall works best when he's at his most abrasive and least distant from its Jamaican progenitors. Tracks with ragamuffin hip-hop pioneer Daddy Freddy (""Run the Place Red"" and ""Politicians and Pedophiles""), longtime Martin collaborator Toastie Tailor (""Beats, Bass, Bombs, and Weapons""), and the Rootsman and He-Man (""Killer"") are the record's highlights, gruff and tumbling shards of sound system greatness. When straying further from dancehall's frenetic, digital snap/crackle/pop, The Bug is less successful. Providing variety-- but with less interesting results-- are a handful of collaborations with London poet Roger Robinson, who offers spoken-word sentiments over sly ambient waves and rolling basslines, and former Rhythm & Sound mate Paul St. Hilare, who chips in with some Horace Andy-like falsettos. Pressure is another blow to what I thought was an irreversible dislike of Tigerbeat6 Records and the juvenile, prankster-like approach to music that seemed to be the only feather in its creative cap. Then, after years of churning out sonic sludge-- often slathered over the works of far more creative artists-- dj/Rupture came along and had me at hello. Pressure (released on Rephlex in the UK) is another winner from the label. The more kinetic and abrasive the record gets the more it appeals to me, but its melange of elastic bass, distorted beats, and spacious pools of electronic dub offers a bit of something for everyone.","One of the more common criticisms of Jamaica's music from those who don't typically listen to it is ...

Purple on Time.,U.S. Maple,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f8ea9e61561daa594c/1:1/w_160/c267c48d.jpg,2003-10-14 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8374-purple-on-time/,Drag City,"I used to know what to expect from U.S. Maple. Like a lot of wholly original bands, they'd become ironically predictable: each album had the lurching start/stops, the grim ashen-throat vocals, and the jittery guitars that needled your ears like pipe cleaners. In a world of stagey, contrived avant- and anti-rock, U.S. Maple were one of the few bands that didn't wink at you, and one of even fewer that could fairly claim to ""deconstruct"" rock music. They'd honed a syntax that fused the obnoxiousness of no-wave and the methodical style of post-rock: the songs were willfully obtuse-- anytime you could make out the lyrics, the words made no sense-- and the pace was so uneven that they constantly threatened to lose all momentum and grind to a halt. So there's a big surprise when Purple on Time. starts spinning: ""My L'il Shocker"" kicks off with a melody. And there's a steady guitar line. And the drums play a beat! And then Al Johnson's singing verses!! What?! You're hearing it right: U.S. Maple are actually rocking. It's odd, sure, but U.S. Maple's fifth disc is indeed their most conventional since their first: the one attribute it shares with Talker or Acre Thrills is its sparseness; otherwise, it's ridiculously straightforward, each track landing pretty much where you'd expect any rock song to, and each noisy break and anti-solo getting stuck in a bridge or an intro. You know, where they ""belong."" It's hard to guess why the band made this change. You could point to new drummer Adam Vida, who's here on loan from run-of-the-mill alt-country act Central Falls-- he plays the way you'd want, say, some dude in Wilco to play, a solid timekeeper that can handle occasional disruptions, awkward silences, and abrupt returns-- but he could just as easily have come on board after the decision to switch things up (or down, as the case may be) was made. Likewise, Mark Shippy and Todd Rittman's guitars still jerk and lurch, but they're less anxious; at times you even hear traces of slow, Zeppelin-like blues-- and what's with the ""Bron-Yr-Aur""-like acoustic interlude near the end? The most obvious difference is a newfound sincerity, which you can hear in Johnson's singing. He remains indecipherable, twisting, choking and curdling his lyrics, but there's more sentiment leaking out around the edges: sometimes hostile or cussed, he also sounds vulnerable, pleading on ""Oh Below"", or moaning through ""Touch Me Judge"" like he's crying at his ex-girlfriend's boarding house window. That tone is even clearer on the band's cover of ""Lay Lady Lay"": instead of ripping it apart, U.S. Maple give Dylan's classic rock radio staple a shockingly straight reading. The guitars are erratic, but rather than playing games with the song, U.S. Maple struggle like they're pushing a boulder, as if trying to figure out what to say with every note. I swear Johnson's drawl sounds heartfelt, even when he's gibbering. This is a U.S. Maple that's clearly changed their emphasis-- using their damaged syntax to sound honest, sad, and vaguely unreliable-- you know, the stuff you'd look for in ballads. It's not all grim. There's ""Tan Loves Blue"", after all, which trampolines ecstatically before wheezing down to the chorus.

Saddle Creek 50,Various Artists,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80ab1335d7bf16991af/1:1/w_160/c7ac5b17.jpg,2003-10-14 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2025-saddle-creek-50/,Saddle Creek,"We pop gobblers are allowing a dark harvest to be reaped. We gaze from our corduroy futons as a strange breed-- the photogenic-- entrench themselves around us. Numbed by our prioritization of hottie-dom, we fail to imagine the entertainment dawn ahead, when no ugly (or even homely or everyperson-looking) talents are left in the spotlight. Who among the current crop of shellacked chesthairs will inherit Christopher Walken's seat at the hall of goons? Will news anchors finally be replaced by seductobots, completing their ""evolution"" from those crusty-old-whitey beginnings? Will our children ask us to explain how Joey Ramone's visage ever escaped mandatory veiling? (The female version of this look-sharp arc is even more distressing...) The acts on Saddle Creek Records are effervescently photogenic. Pictures of them are taken, and published, accordingly, to provide a record of how far inland the epidermal epidemic has spread. Before that strapping Conor Oberst belted his woes around the world, Omaha was considered by many outsiders as one of those zones in which no one could hear you scream. Now, just as several eminent indie labels have done (Merge, Matador, etc), the Creek is celebrating itself and thanking its fans with a budget-priced, two-disc roster-showcase that balances the previously available with the unreleased, a self-consciously calmer election than the sometimes redundant or crass ""classics""/""rarities"" dichotomy. The compilation also reinforces the cultural significance of ten when it is multiplied by five. Like the Drag City inbred buddy system, but cuter, Saddle Creek is rife with acts which are side-projects or recombinations of the label's key players: Now It's Overhead, whose two tracks showcase their shuffly R.E.Mism, contains Azure Ray, whose two tracks convey their evolution from gorgeous violin naifery to confident 4AD-caliber atmospherics. Desaparecidos is, of course, Bright Eyes with distortion; they include their album's most heartbreaking divorce anthem and a new song that actually benefits from the crap-scrapey production bonding its nuke-propaganda reels (""This explosion is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man""), its Tostito-crisp guitarvalanche (the chips are even featured backstage on one of this disc's 45 tedious/harmless film clips), and Oberst's panic-attack stylings (""I don't want to fight in a war/ I don't want to fight in a war/ I don't want to fight in a war""). The lyrics don't offer anything newer than, say, that decade-old team-up between Slayer and Ice-T, but ""war sucks"" appears to have attained profound-banality status, and we are thusly obliged to favor its reiterations. About the Bright Eyes song: Yes, it perpetuates Oberst's long ride atop a champion thoroughbred named Contradiction Shitstorm, as he auditions for the lead in The Strange Case of Dr. Cobain and Mr. Sting. The song's lyrics teeter from fascinatingly perceptive to idiotically obvious, from piercing to quaint (aww, who still says ""made love""?), from immediate to warmed-over. An ambitious screed about war-culture, ennui, eclipsed optimism, moodswings, and the weight of sex, the song flirts with its brilliant pop instincts but gets all complicated by the Saddle Creek soundalike syndrome, that tincture of Counting Crows-iness that is self-loving, but masochistically, reveling in the construction of altars to one's problems. At his best, Oberst is a conscientious and uninhibited examiner of manic yesterdays and corporate tomorrows; at his worst, he seems to be oversqueezing his teats to spray his audience with his precious soul-milk. Elsewhere: The Good Life remains a darker and often deliberately poppier reservoir for Cursive's emoid frontman-- the former's new song is an insidiously catchy Cure-homaging moper, and the latter's ""Nonsense"" suffers from the risk it takes blending Bachmann-skronk with Smurf-scat. Mayday, whom you might know as Lullaby for the Working Class, don't outshine their hymnic already-available ""Captain"". Rilo Kiley includes her concert-closing chant-along ""With Arms Outstretched"", and an urgent femme-Pavement nugget either about depression or anorexia, or at least menstruation. Son, Ambulance won't escape ""mini-Bright-Eyes"" dismissal, which is unfortunate because his arty-cruise-ship arrangements are so strong, and he's able to write and sing (though in a voice very similar to Oberst's) about a wider range of subjects. Sorry About Dresden prove that they deserve better than being considered the label's Cracker or Spin Doctors; see their Rousing Critique of the Superficiality of Hanging Out #345 entitled ""People Have Parties"". (Interestingly, The Faint side project Broken Spindles and Desaparecidos side project Statistics found homes on other labels.) But my secret obsession, The Faint, own this comp's finest moments with their practice-space jam, ""Take Me to the Hospital"". The Faint are much-reviled for being unnecessary arbiters of hump-me dystopia, but mang, they pretty much rule. Their debut is embarrassing (ahem, see Fork-praised fadboys The Rapture's trajectory, cough, ahem), yet the synth overhaul of The Faint's 1999 sophomore effort beat a lot of the current keyboard/dance voguers to the punch. ""Hospital"", for all its cheerleader nothingness (""Want you to take me the H/ Take me to the O/ want you take me to the S..."") is a booming, spiraling, handclapping, screeching, futro masterwork of a Various Artists toss-off. Perhaps The Faint's next full-length will tone down their concept-album inclinations as they embrace the fun of being frontrunners of a wave of, uh, re-runners, making the years between !!! and Sexual Harassment, or Ladytron and Romeo Void, seem like an instant. Let's hope former skateboarder and frontman Todd Baechle doesn't end up singing to Muppets in Labyrinth Reloaded. When I set out to follow The Faint for four days, bringing some brusque friends to annoy them and offset their borderline vapidity and nauseating photogenicness, I sent the band this fallacious letter, angry about The Faint's most recent ""anti-corporate"" album: ""Why the fan-rape, you culture-juh-huh-hammers? I just bought some tickets for The Faint, and was also forced to fuel an SUV for a Ticketmaster exec. WHAT THE FUCK? Why are you Total Jobbers with Ticketmaster? In case you don't know: THE FEES COST MORE THAN TWO TICKETS. For four tickets I paid 12 + 12 + 10 + 10 = 44. For the FUCKING ""convenience and processing"" fees I paid 4.25 + 4.25 +4.25 + 4.25 (convenience, to lubricate me) + 4.25 + 4.25 (processing, the actual ream) = 26 DOLLARS. FUCK YOU. I watched non-mall-punks have to shrug and go home, unable to buy tickets. I recommended they start swooning for Dischord bands. Rich kids, however, will be there for every subversive throb and squeal. Eddie Vedder's your outcredder. This seems cynical of you folks. Am I supposed to feel bad about the prospect of copying CDs for others from a fave label anymore? Am I supposed to get the same econo-critique rush from yer lyrics? Am I supposed to not chuck Saddle Creek 50 into a landfill?"" Etc. The Faint wrote back, noting with accuracy that I was a ""rude person,"" and that they'd try to make other arrangements in the future (some of their gear was stolen days later). Anyway: My eternally drunken sidekick condemned Saddle Creek 50 as ""the longest song I've ever heard,"" and I'll admit to being traumatized by a self-important soundman's mocking my status as the only person old enough to vote at a recent Cursive show. But The Faint's lovable fashion-dreck saves the Nebraska label's crew from sounding like children of the corn. I don't regret a minute of those consecutive days of being a pathetic Fainthead, even though I got so poisoned that I spray-painted my Mazda hot pink and ended up passed out on a faraway beach holding a hammer instead of my glasses. Police woke me to ask if I knew the naked woman in the water on PCP. My friends and I watched as the officers hauled her away. The scene would have made a perfect Faint video.","We pop gobblers are allowing a dark harvest to be reaped. We gaze from our corduroy futons as a strange ...

Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers,The National,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a9ea9e61561daa7f8d/1:1/w_160/54f04c65.gif,2003-10-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5718-sad-songs-for-dirty-lovers/,Brassland,"In a town where folks avoid wearing anything on their sleeves that might offer even the slightest peek at their frailties, frontman Matt Berninger staggers down side streets transcribing the language of his failed relationships. What separates him from the throngs of sadsack superstars and raises his personal pity party to a less solipsistic melancholy isn't necessarily his lyrics, his image, or even that he's not actually a superstar, but rather, his ability to implicate himself in the fray. Since The National's excellent self-titled debut in 2001, the Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati quintet has continued developing its hard-knock aesthetic, and lucky for the listener, Berninger's relationships don't appear to be getting any better. Bearing similarities to Revolutionary Road, Richard Yates' classic critique of dreamless suburban emptiness, Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers lives up to its blunt title-- Berninger's moribund tales are shot through with the rich beauty of a rotten sky glanced on the way home from an argument, his self-effacing barbs matched by the band's equally potent hooks. On the debut, Berninger was obsessed with nightingales, crows and rivers, and the vagaries of love's beauty. Here he whispers more bird metaphors (cardinals, doves, and hawks) and intones about the vast loneliness of being stuck inside your head. Though it sometimes lacks the soft intimacy and hidden corners of the debut song cycle, the addition of viola, violin, piano, keyboards, french horn, and Wilco-styled electronics creates a bed of complex undertones that opens up the overall sound. Mining a newfound raucous vein, ""Available"" and ""Slipping Husband"" rock heavier than anything the band's released yet. ""Available"", in particular, sounds more like something from the Interpol oeuvre than The National's barroom Americana. Barking questions like ""Did you clean yourself for me last night,"" ""Do you feel alone when I'm in my head?"" and ""Do you still feel clean when the only dirt is the dirt I left?"" beneath a wall of darkly jagged guitar incisions, the song climaxes with Berninger losing his grip, screaming himself hoarse. He wonders repeatedly, ""Why did you dress me down and liquor me up?"" as his perfect pace and phrasing explodes into the caustic shouts and coughs of a man losing his shit in public. The most beguiling tracks, though, remain the hazy ballads. ""Cardinal Song"" cradles Berninger's advice to ""Never tell the one you want that you do/ Save it for the deathbed/ When you know you kept her wanting you"" in a bed of echoed arpeggios, twangy chords, hushed backup vocals, cymbal washes, and brushed drums. During a jarring tempo shift played-out over a growling bass rumble and beautiful violin part he finishes off, ""Jesus Christ you have confused me/ Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me/ Forgive me, girls, I am confused/ Stiff and pissed and lost and loose."" Similarly paced, ""Patterns of Fairytales"" introduces electronics and drum machines as the soundtrack for a character obsessing over the mixtapes he gave his old girlfriends: ""I'm turning on the stereo/ And I'm lining up the names/ On the mixes I made before you/ And I'm turning into fairytales/ With glitter and some glue/ Everything we ever planned to ever do."" The added bleeps, buzzes and quavering background sighs make it seem as though Berninger's doing karaoke, adding his vocal swagger to these remnants of his failed seductions, trying to transpose himself into the love songs he wishes he'd written. Each of the dozen laments on Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers balance catchy choruses, exquisite instrumental interludes, and the complex words of a man's grieving. By the time you reach the final punch line of ""Lucky You"" you feel you know Berninger, want to offer him a coat, a smile, and some warmth to make it through another sleepless night. But on second thought, with that added comfort maybe he'd stop singing these beautiful songs: so you hold off, sit back down, and continue listening to this gorgeous train wreck.","In a town where folks avoid wearing anything on their sleeves that might offer even the slightest peek at their ...

The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions,Miles Davis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8beb1335d7bf1699357/1:1/w_160/2be09d1c.jpg,2003-10-14 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2200-the-complete-jack-johnson-sessions/,Columbia Legacy,"In the spring of 1970, Miles Davis was fresh off his trailblazing, artistic watermarks In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, and focusing on the development of his live show. His band included some of the greatest session musicians in jazz at the time: bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, and drummer Jack DeJohnette, and all were helping Miles to push the musical ideas he'd introduced on his records into uncharted territory in concert. But he was also very much inspired by the concept of using recording studios as compositional instruments, and when he set out to create the soundtrack to an obscure documentary on boxing icon Jack Johnson, it turned out he had many more ideas than could possibly find their way onto two sides of a single LP. Following in the vein of Miles' recently issued Complete Sessions box sets for In a Silent Way or Bitches Brew (and featuring more raw material than either), this new five-disc collection shows a man consumed with evaluating the arsenal at his disposal. That meant recording countless takes on a theme, and, with assistance from producer Teo Macero, splicing those takes together into one coherent 40-minute release: 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson. But now, this compilation documents the sessions in their virtual entirety (there are a couple of missing takes, but nothing too essential), offering an incredible six hours of largely unheard material. As with the previous boxes from this era, fans will delight in hearing just about everything the musicians put to tape, as well as paging through the invaluable session info, extensive liner notes, and unseen photos included in the extensive and beautiful packaging. Obviously, though, anyone who hasn't heard and loved the original Jack Johnson album should check that out before dropping $60 on this exhaustive collection. Disc one opens with several takes from a February 1970 session of the misleadingly titled ""Willie Nelson"" (it is, in fact, a Miles Davis original)-- much of which was incorporated into the original LP's largely ambient piece ""Yesternow"". The band, which here features Miles, Corea, Holland, DeJohnette, bass clarinetist Bernie Maupin, and guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, set up a downbeat-heavy groove that reminds me of Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", if much less drugged-out. Davis enters about 40 seconds into ""Willie Nelson (Take 2)"" with a typically elongated phrase before settling into his ""jab"" motif with Maupin. Each take of the song offered here center around melodies similar to this one-- the real differences lie in Sharrock's, Miles' and Maupin's solos. It's a great way to kick off the set, if not quite as fiery a start as the original LP's ""Right Off"". Later that month, Miles reconvened with a smaller band, keeping his rhythm section fully intact, but trading in Sharrock, Corea and Maupin for 19-year-old saxophonist Steve Grossman. They recorded a couple of speedier takes of ""Willie Nelson"" that boast more colorful McLaughlin lines and Grossman's pleasantly spooky soprano. Miles also gives some great solos, even sporting some of his bebop chops at times-- sax player Gary Bartz, a member of Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop and soloist on Miles' Live/Evil, said that some of the most exciting moments during the shows that eventually comprised the 1974 live offering Dark Magus were when Miles would reach back into history to pull out some of his old runs, and they certainly shine here. This band also tries out three versions of a tune called ""Johnny Bratton"" (previously unreleased, and starting the run of songs titled after boxers), a very rock-centric piece that sounds a bit like they were unsure of how to really nail this style. ""Johnny Bratton (Insert 1)"" is basically straight-ahead rock pounding (something like a fusion approximation of ""Louie, Louie"") with McLauglin doing his best to ensure that any tonal center is wiped out, and Holland entering with some admirable fuzz-wah bass playing. In early March, Miles again headed into the studio with this same band to cut ""Archie Moore"" and several versions of ""Go Ahead John"". The former tune is a hard blues number with some very potent lines from McLaughlin-- in fact, Miles and Grossman sit this one out entirely, allowing the trio to bring it home like a seasoned rock band. Five takes of ""Go Ahead John"" pop up on disc two, showcasing Miles' midnight cool melody. The first part is a sparse, somber exercise in minimal blues, and features McLaughlin reeling off short, staccato statements similar to the ones played by Sharrock on the first disc. The second part of the tune is an odd combination of jittery funk and acid-rock, with DeJohnette playing a prehistoric drum-n-bass pattern and Holland holding a single bass note while McLaughlin shreds on the right. All five performances were later edited into a version released on 1974's Big Fun. Mid-March saw Miles lay down two takes of the previously unissued ""Duran"" with McLaughlin, Holland, Maupin, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Billy Cobham. Miles' band was certainly getting a better idea of how to construct ""simple"" funk, as the basic, syncopated groove here could have been played (though never written) by any number of funk bands at the time. However, the robo-tight interplay of Cobham and Holland, along with McLaughlin's ever-edgy solos, make it much more interesting than just any ordinary breakdown. Miles reports, ""that's some raunchy shit, y'all,"" and he's right. These guys (exit Cobham, enter future Return to Forever drummer Lenny White) also did the stop-time, angular funk tune ""Sugar Ray"", which Bill Mulkowski's liner notes curiously describe as ""Devoesque"" and ""proto-punk."" It sounds more like The Meters playing head games to me. As April came around, Miles re-entered the studio with McLaughlin, Cobham, Grossman and Mike Henderson, a teenage bassist from Aretha Franklin's band, to record ""Right Off"" and the first half of ""Yesternow"". These two songs, of course, ended up serving as the tracklist on the original Jack Johnson LP, and anyone familiar with that record can attest to just how beautifully they pulled off ""Right Off""'s uptempo shuffle, with McLaughlin's aggressive outcomping transforming the track from a merely interesting jazz experiment to full-on streetwise fusion. Herbie Hancock dropped by the studio as well (from the grocery store!) and got talked into laying down a fuzz-fried solo on Farfisa, a kind of organ he'd never played before. The track ended up purely celebratory, and the four takes on disc three provide just about every solo angle you could want. The two lengthy takes of ""Yesternow"" offered here are masterful runs into electric ambience, but inevitably not quite as interesting as Macero's final album edit. In May, Miles added Keith Jarrett and percussionist Airto Moreira to the mix, cutting versions of ""Honky Tonk"" and ""Ali"". A short excerpt of ""Honky Tonk"" ended up on Live/Evil, but until now, the track has never been released in its entirety. Shame, too, because it's an excellent slice of blues-rock: Miles plays with confidence using an octave pedal while McLaughlin peals out still more spiky color for Jarrett to run rampant over. Considering that Jack Johnson would be Miles' last studio recording until On the Corner over two years later, it's hard to believe this song wasn't issued somewhere along the line. ""Ali"", leading off disc four, sees the same band (here including longtime Elvin Jones collaborator Gene Perla, who nicks a riff from Hendrix's ""Who Knows"") following a groove similar to that of ""Willie Nelson"", but with a much better idea of how to flesh it out. And then there's ""Konda"", which the guys recorded without a bassist at all, and which didn't see release until 1981's Directions compilation. Jarrett's opening solo on electric piano perfectly sets up Miles' eerie, beautiful melody, and McLaughlin's harmonic work is practically unearthly, helping to make this track one of the box set's coolest pieces. Miles followed this muse a few days later for takes on Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal's ""Nem Um Talvez"". Neither of the versions here are the one from Live/Evil, though the second is remarkably close. Miles wrapped recording in June, but not before taking most of the band from May's sessions (adding old friends Hancock and bassist Ron Carter) back into the studio for one last go at ""Nem Um Talvez"", three other Pascoal pieces (""Little High People"", ""Selim"", ""Little Church""), and another Davis original titled ""The Mask"". All of Pascoal's ballads seem to advance the side of Miles' music best heard on In a Silent Way, and serve notice to anyone who thought he'd abandoned that style for good at the turn of the decade. Unfortunately, ""Little High People"" is almost distractingly straightforward, at least in principal: The uptempo pop/rock groove brings Hancock's organ transmissions down to earth, and keeps Miles' wah-wah solos a bit too in check. Meanwhile, ""Selim"" (really just ""Nem Um Talvez"" with a different title) ended up on Live/Evil, along with the two versions of ""Little Church"" found on this set's fifth disc. Dave Holland came back to the fold to record both parts of the previously unreleased ""The Mask"": the first is a very out, keyboard-heavy free-jam with little assistance from Miles or McLaughlin, while the second-- hardly easy listening-- closes the sessions with an exhausted, punchdrunk swagger, finally collapsing after nearly 16 minutes. The box, however, ends on a high note, with the original LP versions of ""Right Off"" and ""Yesternow"". I hesitate to go through them blow by blow because anyone investing in this box will almost certainly have already heard them many times over. Which, ultimately, is my only real caveat to The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions: there's more of interest here to fans; for a casual listener to tackle all five discs would be commendably ambitious, but an arduous challenge nonetheless. This set ranks behind both the Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way boxes in terms of the amount of music I'd want to just let play, uninterrupted. However, Miles Davis is one of those rare musicians who rarely failed to let a take pass without trying out something cool. As usual, the deeper you dig, the more you find.","In the spring of 1970, Miles Davis was fresh off his trailblazing, artistic watermarks In a Silent Way and Bitches ...

"Ancient & Modern: Cassette Memories, Vol. 1",Aki Onda,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba375e6ef95969322b48/1:1/w_160/6fbf7113.gif,2003-10-13 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6090-ancient-modern-cassette-memories-vol-1/,Phenomena,"It's a sound that seems so familiar to me as I walk through Alphabet City: discarded Duane Reade bags and fountain drink caps with straws still jabbed in them all rattling together in New York's rancid winds, fragments of trash and continuous street din, all mashed together as odors and noises both noxious and intoxicating. It's the sound of years' worth of journal-like tapes made by Japanese improviser and current New York denizen Aki Onda. Although his long history involves working with Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye, Nick Cave collaborator Blixa Bargeld, Mego Records' pop deconstructionist Tujiko Noriko, and glitch pioneer Nobukazu Takemura, as well as releasing music under the name of Audio Sports, this is a highly personal work dealing with Onda's own memories, or rather, a trace of memories captured by a handheld tape recorder. Through re-examining these lost moments of time spent wandering the labyrinthine cityscape, Onda has processed and tweaked aspects of the captured fragments and played them back in real time. Certain sounds rise out of the consommé, but they all get fed back into the mix, conjuring landscapes lost yet re-contextualized in the swirl of noise and wind. For the uninitiated, I'd compare a piece like the opening ""One Day"" to the sort of psychedelia practiced by Austrian guitarist Christian Fennesz (circa Instrument), in that he takes the mundane sounds of a guitar and crafts something far greater as it loops and extends itself beyond its original shape. Onda spins a similar vortex from a forgotten lobe in the tapehead, taking in mechanistic clicks and sax honks from the street, along with an undertow of playground chatter, and twisting it together with a warped clatter of tinny percussion. ""Eclipse"" jumps around a bit more-- all ice cream trucks, cafe orders, and noisy jams cutting in and out-- before settling into a drony, indeterminate haze of sounds that flicker past like subway car windows under the street. The visual quality of French composer Luc Ferrari is a touchstone for these sounds, too. The opening burst of Tompkins Square Park percussion and bum hollers on ""Dream"" echoes the bongo fury that opens his Danses Organiques. Cinema plays a great role in organizing the clamor. Onda openly acknowledges his debt to visionaries of the medium such as Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas. To that list I would add Chris Marker (an influence on Fennesz as well), as throughout this disc of ""cassette memories,"" he blends and blurs the audio fact with the subtle manipulations of the fictional and fanciful until it's impossible to separate the two extremes. ""Last"" has all the buzzy breath of prime Dead C stench, with tapes chirping backwards and gas pipes pinging about. The racket pushes and pulls with delirious speed, frames held for a second before blurring again. Even built from such cast-off garbage sounds, grimy and lo-fi, the residue of these hand-held tapes has a hypnotic and fascinating effect. It's bits of fiery loft-jazz breath, yellow taxi traffic, rat death, Puerto Rican children in the streets, drunks yelling, pigeon shit, and the subway scrapes of raw brakes screaming in unified chorus.

Goa!,Goa,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf47eb335119a49ed1d3/1:1/w_160/bc8bab3d.gif,2003-10-13 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3482-goa/,Robosapien,"From the get-go, Montreal's Goa remind me of a certain infamous Japanese band known for hardcore yelps and krautrock raves. This Canadian band, fronted by Monstre (also known as ""(o)"", sometimes even known by his real name Phillipe Lambert) plays music admittedly influenced by Boredoms (and Can and Sun Ra, among others); right down to the colorful magic-marker sleeve design, it's obvious they aren't messing around with homage. Their sound takes elements of recent Boredoms, Beastie Boys-style rare-grooves funk, and what appears to be a love of Muppet-voices (I'm thinking Elmo), all in the name of an out-of-focus hodgepodge of beats and drone. For the most part, I try not to get too hung up on similarities between bands, but in this case, it's something of a distraction. ""Ah"" wastes no time in referencing sounds that Boredoms have recently made famous, as its primal, techno thud drums and filtered, major-chord synthoid arrangement reveal more than a passing fancy with Japan's finest punks turned hippies. After the short introduction, hardcore drums crash through and the space-age cut-up strains of ""Biyah"" get their due. Where this might have been garage trash in another era, here it's almost like an alien's idea of hip hop, with Monstre's ""vocals"" scratched and looped to the point where they cease being syllables and become percussive accents. ""Chika"" slows the beat down, but keeps the turntable vox (which sound eerily close to Mike Patton's chik-chik exclamations on the last Bungle LP). It also adds a church organ drone, and if you ever questioned Goa's will to pogo into trance, this tune will be happy to thrash you into submission. The final track ""Ih"" stands to garner the most comparisons to Boredoms, as its tropical-themed ambience-- courtesy of beach sounds and noises from distant island fetes-- is coupled with German-imported communal trance; a chorus of shakers and bongos rage on like the younger, goofier cousin to Super Ae. The extended outro sounds almost directly lifted from Vision Creation Newsun, with plenty of electro-filter to blur the edges of their jungle bounce. Monstre's ever-present squeaks aren't quite the celebratory war cries that Eye used on his records, but then Goa isn't exactly on the same transcendent tip either. Goa was named after a grotto in Bali (Goa Gajah), and it seems like there should be a way to make exotic, hypnotic music that doesn't necessarily have to make obvious connections to bands like Can or Boredoms. Monstre speaks of the amazing Gamelan music he heard there, and I wonder if Goa wouldn't be more interesting taking an approach similar to another lauded tribal trance band, Vibracathedral Orchestra, and chase down their jams with a tad less emphasis on outright ""groove"", instead opting for less predictable terrain. Surely, there's more than one way to get high.","From the get-go, Montreal's Goa remind me of a certain infamous Japanese band known for hardcore yelps and krautrock ...

Greatest Hits,Ice Cube,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c213d1975652138477/1:1/w_160/4cacc29c.jpg,2003-10-13 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4147-greatest-hits/,PriorityPriority,"There are two ways to sequence a greatest hits album: chronologically or by degrees of popularity. Ice Cube's new compilation ignores these methods entirely. Gasp in wonderment: the album begins with a rambling pandemonium of tracks (brand new stuff, songs from the War and Peace fiasco, a couple of his classic early 90s songs, ""Bow Down"") and then, somewhere around the eleventh song, the album decides this was a bad idea and heads in reverse chronological order-- from 1993's Lethal Injection to his 1990 solo debut, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted. The actual experience is like reading an anthology of unrelated essays and then watching them suddenly turn into a novel told backwards. It's either brilliant or idiotic, but I admit I doubt anyone thought Ice Cube would be the one to link gangsta rap and French avant-garde literature. I came into the CD just wanting to hear a few tales about some bitches, maybe some senseless claims of braggadocio, and I came out thinking about mobius strip sequences and reincarnation. I only offer this flagrantly satirical critique of the album's arrangement because I know, from innumerable reviews, that there are apparently those who base their purchases on some minutiae like whether the most belligerent songs are saved for the middle of a collection like this or whether the War and Peace songs only occur at the end. I hate people like that. Go back to memorizing your index cards at that Vital Sounds store on Wilshire. Do you really think there's going to be some point where you sit on your chaise longue reading your New Yorker and sipping some cognac, considering the narrative arc and gradual characterization of a hits package? It's so much more likely you'll be rolling on dubs, selling zooties out the trunk, driving your kid sister's twittering friends to a soccer meet, having never even heard the last half of the album because you were listening to ""We Be Clubbin'"" for the seventh time in an hour. Besides, I sincerely doubt Greatest Hits will in any way disappoint your expectations. Every facet of Cube's career is at least partially represented: the ""Golden Age"" Bomb Squad-produced angry black man with an AK, a libido, a social conscience, and a penury of chivalry; the 70s funk-blasting lackadaisical stoner; the unconvincing Chronic-ripoff poseur; and the bizarre 21st-century white noise-and-bells godfather of gangsta, rhyming for image's sake and little else. There are, to be sure, modifications and breaches of these images, but, as a reviewer, I need to unfairly classify artists even if it detracts from their impact. The actual songs obviously didn't require much forethought on the part of the compilers; the most casual MTV viewer should know most of these by heart: stripper-anthem ""Check Yo Self"", the g-funk All in the Family scenarios of ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects"", the deceitfully cynical strut ""It Was a Good Day"" (a good day because ""I didn't even have to use my A.K.""), and the emasculating shadowed thump of ""My Summer Vacation"". Overall, it's pretty difficult to find fault with their selections. While it's possible to wish Priority Records hadn't devoted about a third of the disc to Cube's post-Hollywood output, the singles from those admittedly mediocre albums are fairly resilient, even in the context of his best work. There are some inspired, if not entirely revolutionary, choices here as well. I don't know how they were able to attenuate the original 10-minute Funkadelic homage ""Bop Gun (One Nation)"" down to a tight four minutes, but it's pretty successful at conveying this tribute amidst some of Cube's hardest-hitting lines. The rarely heard ""Jackin' for Beats"" off 1990's Kill at Will EP is what The Doors' ""The Changeling"" would sound like if mixed by Santa Claus, L.A. riots, and copious and blatant references to ""Welcome to the Terrordome"". There's also Westside Connection's ""Bow Down"", but this seems more like an acknowledgement of licensing limitations than a plea for the track to enter Ice Cube's canon. It's fairly irreconcilable to call this Greatest Hits while vaunting Westside Connection over the Dr. Dre collaboration ""Natural Born Killaz"" or most of the songs from Cube's first two albums. There are also two new tracks which are far from ""great hits,"" and may not even make it to the Miserable B-Sides album: ""$100 Dollar Bill Y'All"" might contain the indestructible chorus, ""I'm in this bitch/ I've got a hundred dollar bill, y'all,"" but it offers very little else in its tepid delivery and hand-clap counterpoint, while ""Late Night Hour"" supplies overly melodramatic and creepily simple synths over unremarkable beats. There isn't much else to say. Ice Cube deserves a best-of. This album contains most of the best of Ice Cube. Of course, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted or The Predator are probably, in their entirety, better than this, but that's more a testament to the greatness of those albums; they're so good they're paradoxically better than Ice Cube's own greatest hits. To gather Cube's sound on his later releases, this is at least better than renting The Player's Club again, and acts as a certainly satisfactory introduction to one of the greatest American satirists since Mark Twain.","There are two ways to sequence a greatest hits album: chronologically or by degrees of popularity.

Hope,Non-Prophets,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95e13d197565213ae31/1:1/w_160/759eddd4.jpg,2003-10-13 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5883-hope/,Lex,"No one likes Sage Francis. At least that's how it seems sometimes. After winning a Scribble Jam championship and releasing a series of incredible tour-only CDs, he was given the dubious honor of being recognized as an ""Internet superstar."" 2002 saw the release of his Personal Journals on Anticon's eponymous imprint, and while its emotional poignancy tapped a new vein in the hip-hop canon, valuing vulnerability over machismo façades, its detractors were brutal in their dismissal of its lyrics and style. Now he's teamed up with longtime producer Joe Beats to develop Hope, and if the album isn't a direct response to anyone who ever dubbed him ""emo,"" it's proof he can play as hard in either arena. Hope shows a new Francis altogether, employing bouncy cadences, explosive deliveries and complex rhyme schemes. The vast majority of the album references older hip-hop, including that of OC, Black Sheep, Beastie Boys, Audio Two, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, among others. He even drops his own crit with lines like ""faker than Raekwon's stutter"" and ""Das EFX rocked that band-aid ten years before Nelly did!"" His writing focuses on lighter subjects here, from his disdain for rambunctious children (""Disasters"") to his views on commercial music (""Mainstream 307"") to his eccentric nature regarding different facets of existence (""Spaceman""), which all makes for a solid record that, in terms of both diversity and delivery, puts Personal Journals to shame. The biggest testament to the looser nature of this album compared to his last is the inclusion of a fully developed song by his most popular alter ego. Riding a bass-heavy doorknocker with a foreign vocal sample, ""Xaul Zan's Heart"" is one of Sage's funniest performances to date, as he plays the role of a misogynist pseudo-pimp that claims to be ""deeper than Sage Francis,"" ""the life of the search party,"" and a ""fairy godmotherfucker,"" closing the song with the rousing line, ""I am womanizer, hear me whore."" If you've doubted Francis could be capable of diversifying, this track should change your mind. Of course, Sage is still fully capable of the emotional style he built his name on. Rapping over a swaying ambient track with lone trumpet salvos and subtle synths, ""The Cure"" closes the album with a tour-de-force, placing him in line as one of the best writers in hip-hop today: ""You're not the travelling type?/ Then hide your baggage better,"" he tells a significant other, while the repetition of, ""When a boy writes off the world, it's done with sloppy, misspelled words/ If a girl writes off the world, it's done in cursive,"" stands as a powerful reminder to the inherent beauty of womankind. Paired with a sharp rhyme scheme (""Now I look for air pockets to pick, walk with a stick/ Start picking locks with it, opening up heart-shaped lockets with little arguments/ Tawdry trinkets start to split and contradict/ Those who say one thing but think the opposite"") and a ridiculously tight flow, it stands as one of the year's most delicately and intricately written songs. For a producer with such a low profile, Joe Beats makes an explosive splash in his first full-length effort. His chemistry with Sage Francis is apparent throughout the album, as their interplay is something many producer/emcee teams could benefit from further exploring. Beats' use of beautifully raw drum programming hits like a more accessible Jel, and his mid-90s sampling style hearkens back to Pete Rock and Prince Paul, or the low-end proficiency of a young Ali Shaheed Mohammed. From the floating, atmospheric keyboard of ""Spaceman"" to the triumphant horn-led acoustic guitar crisscross ""Tolerance Level"", Joe Beats easily manages to bridge the gap between forward thinking and traditionalism. With Hope, Sage Francis and Joe Beats set out with an ambitious and impressive goal-- to create the ultimate 1994 record in 2003-- and they've succeeded admirably, paying tribute to the past while updating it for the future. A highly valued reminder of the need for traditionalism in modern music, this album stands strong as one of the year's finest.","No one likes Sage Francis. At least that's how it seems sometimes.

The Civil War,Matmos,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e0ea9e61561daa800c/1:1/w_160/12a19d06.jpg,2003-10-13 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5152-the-civil-war/,Matador,"Not since their self-titled 1997 debut have M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel simply assembled a bunch of tracks and called it an album. Since then, the duo has placed concepts first, even while their execution has remained elastic: sometimes their overriding intent dominates a single track; sometimes the connection between a song and the whole is threadlike at best. I'm partial to their last full-length, 2001's A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure, but for some Matmos fans, their masterpiece remains 1999's The West, their least conceptually unified album since that first outing. The West contains guitar and other stringed instruments that, in places, evoke the Sergio Leone ""big sky"" of the Western landscape, but it also has a fair amount of abstract electronic noise without any particular association. Matmos had something in particular in mind for The West as a whole, but they weren't afraid to follow the tracks where they wanted to go. The Civil War, Matmos' latest, is cut from a similar cloth as The West, but with a more overt and unified concept. The through line this time is the martial music of war-- specifically the civil wars of America's north and south, and the British civil war of the 17th century. Banjos, tubas, penny whistles, rolling snares, bagpipes-- sounds and textures from these conflicts are embedded in the folk music of the English-speaking world, and on The Civil War, Matmos create from them through sampling, processing, editing and arranging. As a technical achievement and as a piece of pure sound, The Civil War is inarguably Matmos' best record. Past Matmos albums have tried to create music from stranger sources and the results, while frequently brilliant and often amusing, sometimes lacked the sonic punch to put them over the top. The raw materials here are things like piano, electric guitar, drums, and hurdy gurdy, so naturally this is far and the away the most musical Matmos we've heard. The instrumental palette was beautifully designed, the layering and detail is amazing, and the computer often goes completely undetected-- in places, it really does sound like a credible string band arranged by someone from the 21st Century. Another parallel between this album and The West lies in its lack of dancefloor accessibility: the loose-limbed funk that wormed its way through A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure is nowhere to be found here. This is, of course, entirely appropriate considering The Civil War's overriding theme. Instead, we get tracks like ""Y.T.T.E."", whose drums and bass swing hard, forming a groove that sounds something like a combination of ""Bo Diddley"" and ""You Can't Hurry Love"". At nine minutes, it's one of the record's two centerpieces (the other being the equally long ""Reconstruction""), featuring Acetone frontman Mark Lightcap's guitar dancing nimbly above the beat. As the percussion splinters and then fades, Lightcap codas with an effective bit of internal Maggot Brain-style soloing. ""For the Trees"" slows things down with the kind of behind-the-beat shuffle that's become something of a Matmos trademark, and it works just right against the piano and violin, evoking a sepia-toned portrait of a lazy afternoon in the deep south. The track's closing reprise strips away any trace of electronics and coasts into the horizon on an acoustic cloud. The send-up of ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", meanwhile, is a sharp statement, skewering the pomposity of John Philip Sousa with dinky sounds and unsteady rhythms while secretly celebrating the spectacle of it all. I have a feeling that Matmos' concepts serve mostly to constrict the limitless possibilities of sampling and sequencing-- deciding to use a fixed set of sounds necessarily limits choice, which has to feel good when you've mastered the computer and the world is your orchestra. But sound and production aside, something isn't quite there. ""Reconstruction"", for example, follows a brilliant arc from a messy beginning of electronic squelches, reaches a jaunty middle with marching drums and a snappy guitar riff, then dissolves into a Reichian tremble of dense repeating keyboards before finally coming out the other side with a delicate banjo/steel guitar refrain. The construction of the thing is fantastic, the pacing just right, and yet, when that mournful banjo does its Bud Cort walk into the sunset, I just can't escape the feeling that there's less of an emotional core here than on previous offerings-- that the concept has perhaps taken too much precedence over the visceral delivery. As such, The Civil War, while impossible not to like, is difficult to love.","Not since their self-titled 1997 debut have M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel simply assembled a bunch of tracks and ...

Fire Theft,The Fire Theft,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7ac0084474cd0c2ec2/1:1/w_160/1d1fc59f.jpg,2003-10-12 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3276-fire-theft/,Ryko,"This could get ugly: here I am, faced with the crucial task of criticizing a set of musicians whose work, for all intents and purposes, comprised ""indie rock"" as I first came to know it. The name Sunny Day Real Estate still triggers all sorts of fantastic images: I studied Latin every morning on the bus while listening to Diary; LP2 was the first album I would buy at Philly's Spaceboy Records (which thereafter had a monopoly on my time and earnings until I moved out of the city); the review of How It Feels to Be Something On, for better or worse, was my first encounter with Pitchfork. And though I'd be unlikely to count any of that band's albums among my all-time favorites, I can't help but feel like Jeremy Enigk has a lot to do with my degree in Classics, my current writing projects, and the bulk of my record collection. After Sunny Day's second (and final) demise in 2000, I assumed Enigk would release another pleasant solo album, or maybe regroup with a new cast entirely. But in fact, Sunny Day simply regrouped again, as The Fire Theft, sans guitarist Dan Hoerner. Fair enough! This was good news, so far as I could tell, and I was positively thrilled to see what developments the sound of the band, now reunited with original bassist Nate Mendel, had undergone. Maybe they'd even shake off their prog phase! Unfortunately, The Fire Theft actually sees the band indulging in ersatz approximations of Yes and Genesis' epic odysseys much more deeply. The problem isn't so much in the band's decision to branch out-- that, I respect-- but that their moody, foreboding ambient segues fail to translate into much of interest for the listener. I can dig ambient preludes on rock records if they have a sense of direction, lend weight to album's overall mood, or merge nicely with the tracks they're sandwiched between, but these sorely lack originality-- all are nearly identical in mood and scope-- and seem to have little to do with the songs into which they inevitably segue. The record opens on two of these: the first sounds ripped from one of the quieter moments of Moby's Play; the second (tellingly titled ""Waste Time Segue"") is a standard drone squeezed from a heavily reverbed piano. The overuse of this ambient gimmick is also indicative of a larger problem, which is that the band seems terrified of personal conviction. Even when The Fire Theft are purportedly kicking out the jams, the songs feel half-hearted and vaporous. (To give you an idea, there are more songs in waltz-time here than I can ever remember hearing on any album, cross-genre.) On tracks like ""Waste Time"", the band carefully regurgitates all the 80s rock tropes taught by local music store teachers, sporting all the traits of a wedding band ""stylizing"" a Police song. ""Rubber Bands"" sounds most calculatedly young/hip, featuring a Braid-like b-section with diminished chords and pasty funk lines devoid of the rhythmic cleveries and emotional investment. And it only gets worse. The guitar solos-- of which there are more than a few-- are laden with the ostentatious bombast of any hair metal band you never liked, replacing sincerity with slick chops and bloodless effects. The drumming, whose consistency is both a virtue and a vice, is at all times precise but never inventive, content to stay predictably on the beat and bang a few toms for extra anthem power when necessary. Going after Enigk's lyrics, meanwhile, is like playing an armless man in golf, but let it suffice that the following lyrics are wailed melodramatically: ""Lift back the veil that hides you from me""; ""How can you change your mind after all the dreams that we once shared?""; and my personal favorite, ""It's the simple things that are hard to grasp."" The Fire Theft is ultimately saved from total mediocrity by two songs. One of them is ""Summertime"", a (surprise!) waltz which could draw comparison to Neutral Milk Hotel with a budget. Here, Enigk gives one of the album's only convincing vocal performances over acoustic guitar, delicate string arrangements and an occasional breath of fresh electronic air. And the closing ""Sinatra"" is The Fire Theft's most realized offering, showcasing the extent of Enigk's vocal range, tasteful dynamic changes, and the most integrated string arrangements on the album. Sadly, the album fails to convince beyond these too-brief moments; worse, it never tries to, lazily substituting age-old gimmicks for actual, palpable spirit. Ironically, a desperate attempt to escape such listless vanity is what drove me to Sunny Day Real Estate in the first place.","This could get ugly: here I am, faced with the crucial task of criticizing a set of musicians whose work ...

Jessica EP,Adam Green,by: John O'Connor,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe55e6ef9596932348f/1:1/w_160/742a6a76.jpg,2003-10-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3626-jessica-ep/,Sanctuary,"Adam Green's prolific output-- three solo albums since The Moldy Peaches' self-titled debut in 2001-- partly derives from the brevity, and partly from the unevenness of his material, much of which sounds as like it was recorded on a four-track in the back of a U-Haul. He's been called an ""anti-folk torchbearer"" along the lines of Jonathan Richman and Townes Van Zandt, but says he's ""medium-serious"" about his music (pick one, kiddo-- either you are or you aren't), an attitude that often breeds complacency. With songs averaging around two minutes, replete with gratuitous pop-culture references and illusory in-jokes, and devolving occasionally into inscrutable ramblings, Green seems to fit the mold of college-quadrangle-musician jamming ironic Bob Dylan covers for the Birkenstock literati. His best work, though, is self-indulgent, redundant, and exasperating, and therein lay its charms. Jessica, a five-song EP of old and new material, contains dashes of 60s folk, country, lo-fi pop, and a recording of a child singing an anti-smoking commercial. Two songs are from Green's recent full-length album, Friends of Mine, and one is a cover of The Beach Boys' ""Kokomo"", with Ben Kweller. The title song, ""Jessica"", is about pop icon/mammary-spectacle Jessica Simpson, whose nonsensical musings have been on painful display recently on MTV's Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica. Here, a resounding string arrangement (cello and violin, I think) lends a bigger-than-usual sound to the guitar, bass and drums trotting behind Green's mordant lyrics. ""Jessica Simpson/ You've got it all wrong/ Your fraudulent smile/ The way that you faked it the day that you died.../ My body's in a shambles/ Encrusted with brambles."" A similar string arrangement frames ""Friends of Mine"" where Green flutters a ""Whoa-oh-oh-oh"" through the chorus in Sinatra-like fashion. ""What a Waster"" is vintage Green, strumming guitar and lamenting about the dysfunctional sad-sacks that somehow weasel their way into his life. But my partiality to ""Kokomo"", the last song, is probably owed more to an awkward and deeply uncomfortable infatuation with the song itself than to Green and Kweller's version. I'm not a fan of Kweller, but Green couldn't have dreamed of pulling this song off without Kweller there to hit the high notes. These are simple-- and sometimes inspired-- songs. But the lo-fi charm occasionally wears thin on Jessica, especially on the aforementioned child's ditty ""Don't Smoke/The Bronx Zoo 1989"", which brings me around to my biggest complaint about Green: he needs editing. Being only ""medium-serious"" about your music allows you freedom to experiment, to stumble clumsily into new territory, and to shirk accountability when you fail. It's also an impediment to greatness-- Talking Heads, Wire, and The Pixies couldn't have reached such heights without risking potentially looking like jackasses-- but with Green's greatness still in development, it remains to be seen what, if anything, all of this is leading to.","Adam Green's prolific output-- three solo albums since The Moldy Peaches' self-titled debut in 2001-- partly derives from the ...

Lead Us Not into Temptation,David Byrne,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41f13d1975652138c3d/1:1/w_160/92088ab9.jpg,2003-10-12 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1062-lead-us-not-into-temptation/,Thrill Jockey,"There are several reasons not to underestimate David Byrne. Though best known for his eccentric, anxious vocals and tangential lyrics with Talking Heads, his body of work is one of the most diverse in rock, ranging from his groundbreaking projects with Brian Eno, to his music for stage and theater, to his compilations which made 60s tropicalia a universally recognized genre, to his screenwriting, directing and scoring for film and video projects, Byrne has pushed himself to invent and innovate in every possible medium. But even as he's constantly evolved as an artist, he's held true to one consistent element, and that's rhythm. Nearly all of his music-- and particularly his last solo work, Look Into the Eyeball-- has held some connection to the motion of what most writers generically refer to as ""world music;"" in Byrne's case it's specifically the music of West Africa and Latin America. Though rhythm is hardly absent from his latest work, Lead Us Not into Temptation, it's by no means a dominant force in the music-- for this and several other reasons, this album represents an entirely new chapter in Byrne's book (it's also the first in years not to sport his Luaka Bop label's logo). The primary reason that this album is so different from anything he's done so far is probably that it's a soundtrack, and the mood of the film has to dictate the mood of the music. Byrne has scored several films in the past-- he even won an Academy Award for his collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Cong Su on the score for The Last Emperor in 1988-- but the post-noir drama of Scottish filmmaker David MacKenzie's Young Adam presents a very different challenge for a composer than Byrne has faced in the past. To say Byrne is up to the task doesn't do him justice; Temptation is strong enough to stand with any of Byrne's other solo work, that rare film score that works beautifully as an entirely separate record. With the exception of the Twin Peaks jazz-noir of ""Seaside Smokes"" and the fantastic, sax-heavy arrangement of Mingus' ""Haitian Fight Song"", the album is stuffed with glassy, stately, almost static music that feels closer to Rachel's or recent Friends of Dean Martinez than Talking Heads or Feelings. Most of the film is set on a Scottish river barge, and the music captures the damp chill of the Scottish air and the fog rolling off the moors and lochs of the Highland countryside in the morning. Byrne reportedly employed Cage-ian techniques-- such as dictating which notes could be played, but not when-- to develop the majority of these pieces. The approach keeps things moving at a sharp clip, ensuring that virtually none of the disc's tracks become predictable or tired. ""Sex on the Docks"" is decidedly unerotic, but it still has a sense of tension and climax that befits its title, as rushing piano figures and harshly strummed acoustic guitar chase heaving cellos and violas. The mix of hurdy gurdy and accordion provided by John Somerville and Appendix Out's Alasdair Roberts in the middle of the song also make for an unsettling texture. Several of the string-dominated pieces are just flat-out pretty, each nudged subtly by percussion and drum programming, and none of them sound overtly similar to each other, despite that some of them even share recurring melodic themes. Byrne's guitar playing throughout the album is masterfully restrained, and it's enough to make you wonder why more people don't praise him for his playing. His lap steel on ""The Lodger"" is ghostly an ephemeral, another layer in the fog of a work that at first might be mistaken for one of Stars of the Lid's ambient drones, but is soon joined by swelling strings and a voluptuous cello motif. There are two vocal songs placed at the very end of the album, and each fits beautifully with the candor of the album. The first, ""Speechless"", is centered around a strange moan-- Byrne using his voice more like a violin than traditional vocals. ""The Great Western Road"" is more straightforward, a precisely metered slow song with Byrne in top form vocally and lyrically. The opening lines, ""A man sticks his fingers inside of his mouth/ The words are stuck in there/ He fishes them out,"" are the best glimpse of the Byrne we've known and loved. It's a fair bet that the concept of using Scottish musicians to score a film set in the Scottish heartland (the record features contributions from members of Belle & Sebastian, Mogwai, Snow Patrol, The Reindeer Section, Future Pilot AKA, and others) appealed to Byrne because of his own heritage-- he spent the first seven years of his life in Dumbarton before his family relocated to Baltimore. The final result is nearly an hour of arresting music that we might not have exactly expected from him, but that nonetheless functions as a fitting tribute to his homeland, as well as an effective mood piece. It seems a safe bet that this is more a detour for Byrne than a new direction, but it shouldn't be overlooked for that. Lead Us Not into Temptation is a powerful recording, and yet another engrossing chapter in an inestimably great career.","There are several reasons not to underestimate David Byrne.

Lineage Situation,Neil Perry,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95dc0084474cd0c25c5/1:1/w_160/b7685d0c.jpg,2003-10-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5882-lineage-situation/,Level Plane,"Formed way back in 1998 by ex-members of You & I and Red All Over, Central New Jersey's screamo kings Neil Perry bobbed and swayed in basements everywhere to a cathartic strain of dark guitar chops, wisely calling it quits after four years while still at the top of their post-hardcore game. Lineage Situation is the child birthed from the band's tenure. Daunting in its inclusiveness, the retrospective graciously collects forty tracks as well as a 35-minute video hinting at exuberant sing-alongs and shoutouts to the kids and the crew. Though 40 tracks and a rocker video may seem both Biblical and over-indulgent, the strongest pieces are four previously unreleased bits (that the scraps are this solid connotes an endless vault of hidden gems somewhere in the Garden State). In its four minutes ""Nine Minute of Non-Fiction"" features enough emotional guitar shifts for an entire short story; the instrumental ""Kicked"" tweaks the lush interiors of pretty head space with repetitious guitar lines that give the feel of an unresolved introduction; and ""What is in the Making"" is diligent in its melodramatic battle of soft/quiet, clean/distorted. As is often the case with late-stage hardcore, lyrics are secondary: the vocal lines exist as a layer of pestilence, something else to knock about in your ear while enact a beautifully parsed robotic conniption across the dancefloor. Syllables do play a part, of course. Loud guys with chips on their shoulders often opt to distinguish themselves through the use of lengthy ""clever"" song titles. Not above this practice, Neil Perry totter behind smarmy bits like ""Igor, My Girlfriend Dumped Me... Let's Write Sad Songs"" and ""I Bought This Southern Rap Compilation and All I Got Was This Lousy Hi-Hat."" (Yeah, The Locust do it too, but because they eviscerate their compositions, the added fat makes sense structurally.) Forget the sophomoric college-boy humor; Lineage Situation is best experienced as a strand of raucous and anonymous minimalism. Taken as a vaguely frantic tapestry, the comp succeeds as some truly toe-tapping background music; song titles in place, I'm reminded of one too many phony phone calls and a pair of fart jokes. Beneath the grunts and growls, Neil Perry are comfort food, a sonic security blanket. And though this set ends with the almost heartbreaking screaming whisper of the truncated ""I'm Sad for You"", with the band's participants playing now in Hot Cross, Welcome the Plague Year, and A Life Once Lost, it feels, really, like Neil Perry hasn't gone anywhere. I like retrospectives and contextualization, and yes, Neil Perry were definitely among a 90s hardcore elite, but the super cozy familiarity of this borrowed aesthetic makes even the topmost guns feel ultimately expendable.

Stellastarr,stellastarr*,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6415e6ef95969320cbe/1:1/w_160/7cbe76cf.jpg,2003-10-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7715-stellastarr/,RCA,"When a rosy-faced tot tumbles off a seesaw, whacking his precious head on the playground turf, each subsequent moment is heavy with the threat of total apocalypse: his face will start to crumple, tiny pink mouth stretching open, eyes fluttering and nostrils rearing, sticky fingers clamping down on blades of grass. Onlookers will pause in thick silence, uneasy, leaning forward just a bit, waiting to see if what follows is a spit-riddled giggle or a belly-flipping scream. Stellastarr frontman Shawn Christensen's voice has come to exist in that exact same purgatory, his deep, gut-borne howl flitting effortlessly from cautious whisper to full-on bellow, sometimes sinister, sometimes loving, always pulsing with the threat of complete breakdown. The unpredictability of the situation is what makes it impossible; the prickly volatility is what makes it riveting. Stellastarr is the Brooklyn-born band's first full-length (duly preceded by 2002's three-song Somewhere Across Forever EP) and, with a dressed-in-black swagger reminiscent of fellow New York based art-punks Television and vocals reminiscent of 70s David Byrne, it's an apt portrait of what New York City has always been stupidly good at generating: thorny post-punk guitars, wild, undulating vocals, and plenty of cigarette-enhanced Lou Reed sneers. Boston enters the picture as well: The Pixies serve as one of Stellastarr's more obvious parent figures; the hollow boy/girl vocal exchanges on ""Jenny"" are classic Francis/Deal. Add this to the fact that this record was produced by Boston-based producer Tim O'Heir, who manned the decks for so many of the city's alterna-rock icons (Morphine, Juliana Hatfield, Dinosaur Jr.), and it's not too difficult to see how that early 90s college-rock aura could have seeped into these songs. The band is young, though, and this being their debut album, they have some growing to do. Their most noticeable weakness is the blatancy of their influences-- an easily acquitted misgiving, considering the disc's strengths. In backing up Christensen's caterwauling, bassist Amanda Tannen, guitarist Michael Jurin, and drummer/keyboardist Arthur Kremer nobly transcend most art-school clichés (admirable, with three Pratt alumni present), pushing out dark, danceable new-wave that wiggles-in-neon like it's 1985. Opener ""In the Walls"" opens harmlessly enough, teaming pulsing video-game synths with Christensen's blank, creepy chanting; seconds later, the band kicks up and Christensen releases his open-mouthed howl, soaking the room with huge, dramatic screams. The breathless, guitar-driven ""Jenny"" is the perfect opportunity to holler ""Jenny!"" as much as you ever wanted, a sinister homage to being screwed and screwed-up that showcases Christensen's peaceable-one-second, crackers-the-next vocal stylings (dude says ""motherfucker"" like he really means it!). The bouncing, elastic ""My Coco"" is tough to follow, and Stellastarr starts to sag a bit in the middle before winding down, unceremoniously, with ""Pulp Song"", a track that-- cleverly?-- sounds kinda like a Pulp song. Stellastarr's bold, cinematic sprawl demands a certain kind of tolerance, and might require a few listens before you're able to fully adjust to its dramatics, but Christensen is, in the end, an oddly convincing leader, and, if nothing else, you'll at least be stuck to your headphones trying to guess his next move.","When a rosy-faced tot tumbles off a seesaw, whacking his precious head on the playground turf, each\n\ subsequent moment ...

1972,Josh Rouse,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b3c0084474cd0c00d8/1:1/w_160/f3e4ea63.jpg,2003-10-09 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6842-1972/,Ryko,"1972, the latest outing from Nebraskan-gone-Nashvillian singer/songwriter Josh Rouse, actually signals a jump forward in time for him, despite its retrofitting. His last effort, 2002's Under Cold Blue Stars, made a flailing attempt to paste together the story of a Midwestern couple's liaisons, circa 1950s, within the context of his straightforward, warm-blooded pop and permissive sensibilities. His latest is twice as cohesive and markedly easier on the intake. Despite a few aberrant wince-worthy moments, which I'll generously chalk up as acceptable losses given that he's chosen throwback 70s strains as this album's vehicle of assault, 1972 finds Rouse winding a tight ball of earnest, insouciant pop balladry. It just may be the most obvious-- even contemporarily fatuous-- listen I've encountered all year. But you know what: It works. Rouse starts off in his lowest key with the title track. Most akin to his early, late-90s material, the song tosses off a dreamy narrative of utopian imperfection about life in its titular year: marooned, unemployed, getting high, and shooting pool. Comfortably sprinkled with subtle percussion and light strings, it's the most acoustic-based track on the record-- and though it might be aimed at a generation three or four removed from his own, it speaks in timeless divulgence. The rest of the album is more exploratory, but also more compartmentalized within each of its sonic domains. The single, ""Love Vibration"", bounces a nostalgic eight-track beat with some synth work and light horn arrangements before giving way to a sax solo (!). Which speaks to one of the record's best traits; In each song, 70s-tinged red flags (flute solos, vibraphones, background singers, disco string loops, etc) find a place to settle in, but Rouse minimizes any potential damage by using them sparingly, squeezing highly effective hints of earnestness and atmosphere from them before sending them hurtling back into whatever vintage hellhole spat them out. ""Slaveship"" might be vintage Jackson Browne on his birthday, with sparkling piano and handclaps; the shoreline tango ""Flight Attendant"" fits somewhere between Summerteeth's ""How to Fight Loneliness"" and something from former Rouse collaborators Lambchop; and ""Sparrows Over Birmingham"" employs a gospel choir to fill out its period soft soul swing. ""James"", meanwhile, is a veritable lost 70s soft-rock relic, and one of the only tracks to showcase Rouse's mercurial falsetto. Although not utilized to its fullest here, his voice transforms to fill the needs of the song, showing that, while sometimes the least compelling aspect of his songs, it can be made the centerpiece when necessary. Lyrically, Rouse takes it easy throughout the album, finding fortune mostly in his simple reel-to-reel personal sketches, though he does occasionally cause facial contortions when traversing groovier territory and crooning gory, anachronistic lyrics like, ""I wanna be your baby daddy."" He ends the album on a fine note, though, with the symphonic ""Rise"", calling to mind early Damien Jurado (if he could sing) and some of the Pernice Brothers' more lightly conceptualized moments. All told, it may be the best set of songs Rouse has yet to offer; I'd be curious to hear his take on my 1980s.","1972, the latest outing from Nebraskan-gone-Nashvillian singer/songwriter Josh Rouse, actually signals a jump forward in time for him, despite ...

Cup of Sand,Superchunk,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d8b1335d7bf1698ccb/1:1/w_160/61d211ee.jpg,2003-10-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7620-cup-of-sand/,Merge,"By official act of Congress, upon its release in 1990, ""Slack Motherfucker"" became the anthem of empowerment for all those who ever found themselves earning enough for one, but working for two-- sick of leaving at eight, returning at six, and finding the leech still asleep on the couch, sick of watching that bastard roommate smoke your paycheck away, sick of managers who only manage to sit on their asses; a host is only as good as his or her parasites, but the day will always come when it's time to serve notice. All the bitterness, sadness, sweetness and righteous wrath engendered by those confrontations is given voice in Mac McCaughan's call-to-arms, unifying every good-natured, put-upon innocent who's ever been torn by love and hate and made to feel like dirt for having no choice but to turn out a friend, co-worker, or loved one. To anyone who can sympathize, the cathartic indignation of ""Slack Motherfucker"" is awe-inspiring. That's what Superchunk have always done best; all the way back to their self-titled debut, these Chapel Hill overlords have crafted anthems for the ages by anyone's definition, fist-pumping scream-alongs of the highest order. Conventional wisdom cheekily held that every 'Chunk song sounded the same, mostly due to their constant barrage of inhumanly massive power riffs and McCaughan's nasal, forever-thirteen conviction, but as often as not, sheer enthusiasm covered for any perceived lack of musical invention. Since those early days, they've gradually mellowed, trading anthemic peaks for pretty, sprawling pop landscapes. And from fans who just wanted to jump up and down some more (myself included), it's caused endless brow-furrowing and grumbling about concepts like ""maturation"" and ""developing as artists."" I fell in love with Superchunk because of their seemingly inexhaustible adolescence, I guess, or maybe just McCaughan's ability to sing lines like, ""I saw a robin's egg/ And it was blue,"" like they're the keys to world peace (if we would only listen, don't you see?!). With that in mind, though, being the nearly one-dimensional, if extremely devout, fan that I am, I expected this two-disc, decade-spanning collection of B-sides and various rarities to be a somewhat hit-or-miss affair, and mostly miss. Sometimes it's great to be wrong; the bunch of homeless tracks sheltered here hold up as well as many of their best albums and actually thrives on the diversity that I'd once been inclined to frown upon in Superchunk's canon. The dramatic grind of ""The Mine Has Been Returned to Its Original Owner"" segues into the heart-tugging ""A Small Definition"", in turn sulking face-first into the towering ""Dance Lessons"", and it all sails through a storm of emotions so easily, you don't even have time to know if you ought to be happy, sad or angry at the mine's former owner. ""Never Too Young to Smoke"" is a grim procession starkly at odds with the hopeful longing of the acoustic version of ""Detroit Has a Skyline"" off the Hyper Enough single. McCaughan is momentarily stunned on the quiet ""shuffle"" (band's words, according to some hilarious liner commentary from the members) of ""Sexy Ankles"", and when he sings, ""You swing the truth around, and somebody gets hurt,"" the person wounded is him. But it's not too bad-- ""White Noise"" is back to work the next day, rocking as happily and easily as a 'Chunk anthem on a casual Friday. I hesitate to say that there isn't a downside to this collection, but even the few would-be clunkers included here (""With Bells On"", ""Reg"") are elevated by the carnival-esque tilt-a-whirl of moods on these discs. Arguably, the consistency and simplicity of Superchunk's assembly line formula, even at its worst, produces songs that are individually fine, just too easily overshadowed by similar but improved sound and structure in their better work. The theory is readily supported by Cup of Sand, where no track sounds out of place or unexpected because of the chaotic balance struck out of necessity, by sheer virtue of the dozens of releases and almost as many years from which these songs are culled. Covers of Adam Ant's ""Beat My Guest"" and Bowie's classic ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)"" forcibly crammed into Superchunk's one-size-fits-all style just add to the gleeful confusion. Despite it all, two discs' worth of jangly pop and McCaughan's exuberant tenor can defeat even the most steadfast listener (it really is a lot to take in at once), and as mentioned, not all of these tracks bear out the same level of quality. Never let it be said that Superchunk ever turned in a poor excuse for a castoff, though-- the least that can be said of any one of these tracks is that it's formulaic, and that means reliable, folks. It's hard to say if the brilliantly random shifts in mood and tempo that work so well here could even have been preserved had Cup of Sand been pared-down further. Also, while I'm complaining about getting too much in this collection, I'd like to bitch about pretty girls, the sun, and free money. Okay, here's to shutting up.","By official act of Congress, upon its release in 1990, ""Slack Motherfucker"" became the anthem of empowerment for all those ...

Everdom,Anders Ilar,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1b3ea9e61561daa7e17/1:1/w_160/0a646c16.gif,2003-10-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4071-everdom/,Shitkatapult,"There was a certain moment circa 1991 when, immersed and blissfully lost in The KLF Chill Out for the first time, a train outside my window suddenly began to barrel and cry as it passed through. As if in sympathy, so did my stereo, as the disc began to echo this outside sound with its own glissando of trains pulling through washes of keyboards and pedal steel, while somewhere in the miasma Elvis mumbled through the floorboards. It was then I realized not only the power of ambient music, but what it meant to make a music that could adapt to any and all sounds outside itself, something amoebic that could also swallow everything else. So when the coughs of my living room guest started to synch up with the fifth track of the first full-length from Swede Anders Ilar, I knew he must have been down with that early nineties school of thought, making his heavily-delayed electronics into something like a clear, deep golden broth that could hold all sorts of other sounds in suspension. A track like ""Rare Islands"" shows this connection to the decade previous, as Ilar lifts some of Aphex Twin's early wind chimes, and you can hear them mellifluously clang as he steals away ever so slowly. ""Coastline"" crackles to life with symphonic swells of bass, the crisp drums disappearing in rolling waves before coming back up to the surface. A lone strand of piano sustains throughout, vibrating beneath the radio static that surrounds it, keeping it afloat. ""Make Believe"" builds slowly, using a simple repeating pattern that scatters dubby debris about each step. Three minutes in, we happen upon a standard house beat, an odd discovery amid this snowy nowhere. In the distance, picturesque, grandiose melodies ring out, far enough away to be almost imagined, yet drawing your attention from the yawning thumps that stretch before you. The mistitled ""Illusion of a Summerbreeze"" instead conjures up winter and stuffy heads, combining a soft-palate tickle with post-nasal drip percussion as an odd wheezing hack darts through the mix. It's slightly annoying, but as the cold medicine goes to work over its ten minutes, its codeine sway makes operating heavy machinery (like CD players) inadvisable, better left to run themselves. It collides with the similarly medicated ""December Haze"", downshifting soundforms to the point of pure, forelobe-fogging bass rumbles. Closer ""Everlast"" moves into the present, drawing from modern purveyors of electronic dreams like Ekkehard Ehlers or Christian Fennesz. ""Everlast"" makes a non-specific acoustic sound source shimmer on repeat, as each bit is elongated past the point of recognition, every pop and digital tear kept intact as it loops and melts. Everdom isn't exceptionally personalized, but Anders Ilar has obviously studied some of the masters, and will hopefully come with a more distinctly chilled ambient vision in the near future.","There was a certain moment circa 1991 when, immersed and blissfully lost in The KLF Chill Out for the first ...

Permission to Land,The Darkness,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5513d197565213b07d/1:1/w_160/0be1a0f2.jpg,2003-10-09 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2524-permission-to-land/,Atlantic,"If I'd gone to journalism school rather than just gaining pre-employment experience arseing around the Michigan Daily offices reading copies of Melody Maker, I'd have learned that one rule in writing is that I should ""know my audience."" And I'm pretty sure that, in this case, a large portion of my audience has already decided that they just might hate The Darkness. I hope not, because making snap judgments-- especially ones based on anything except, y'know, what's coming out of your speakers and whether or not it engages you-- seems like a bit of a foolish thing to do. If you're that convinced that The Darkness are a bad post-po-mo joke unfairly unleashed on the world, turn back now, listen to the new Books album, and feel safe in the knowledge that most of the Pitchfork staff probably thinks I'm nuts. The Darkness are from England and they wear things like open-chested catsuits and tight trousers. Sometimes these outfits are made of leather; sometimes they have animal prints. The band members sport long hair and look like they stepped off the stage at Castle Donington circa 1980. To a lot of people, this means The Darkness couldn't possibly be any good. I wrote a one-act, one-man play about this idea titled Proper Rock Fan: Pot Kettle Black. Take a look: SCENE: Virgin Megastore, Chicago. A Proper Rock Fan scans the Top 40 albums wall. Proper Rock Fan: People are stupid for falling for music like The Darkness. It looks phony, manufactured, and seems to take its image more seriously than its songs. All music like that is shit. [curtain] Too often, music fans fall for marketing without realizing it. For instance, by refusing to engage with a band like The Darkness on any level solely because of a preconceived notion of what they appear to be ""about,"" you'd actually be more swayed by marketing and image than the kids checking the disc out on the listening station. Besides, looking silly-- or at least risking looking silly-- can only be good for a band like The Darkness. Big Guitar Rock, after all, used to be silly. It used to be pretty good, too. AC/DC, Queen, Black Sabbath, KISS, and Led Zeppelin (have you seen The Song Remains the Same?) were all absurd. Claiming any allegiance with the devil and buying Aleister Crowley's house are ridiculous prospects. Smashing your instruments and lighting your guitar on fire are both pretty stupid-looking, too, when you get right down to it. But that's the whole problem with rock right now: It doesn't do those things anymore. There's nothing heroic about it, nothing demonstrative, nothing to capture the imagination. So, then, what do The Darkness sound like? Well, they're a blend of 70s pomp-rock, early 80s metal, and bombastic, shiny arena rock. What they do well might be best exemplified by ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"", which most effectively pairs their sense of theatricality and grandiosity with their penchant for great pop hooks. Meanwhile, ""Black Shuck"" channels AC/DC (there really ought to be a lightning bolt key), ""Growing on Me"" throws back to David Lee Roth-era Van Halen, and ""Love Is a Only a Feeling"" invokes 70s rock ballad extravagance. Elsewhere, ""Stuck in a Rut"", ""Get Your Hands Off of My Woman"" and ""Holding My Own"" demonstrate the range of singer Justin Hawkins' voice as it flits between all the classic rock modes: flamboyant, delicate, gravely. They also have a delightful glam track called ""Friday Night"" that very nicely highlights his posh vowel sounds. Granted, that's a lot of ""improper"" touchstones on the face of it, but American rock in recent years has included a clutch of updates on classic and arena rock-- from The White Stripes to Foo Fighters to Queens of the Stone Age to Smashing Pumpkins. And truth told, The Darkness aren't even that different from these bands. The Stripes' ""Black Math"" or ""There's No Home for You Here"", with their histrionic vocals and high-octane guitar solos, fit The Darkness' aesthetic to a tee. (And ""Ball and Biscuit"" is winking conceit. Who's supposed to be the novelty act again?) The difference is that The Darkness drop the tortured-artist shtick and write paeans to the unbridled joy of love where Jack White would be more inclined to grumble about the death of the sweetheart and chide a world that cares ""about nothing that is long term"" in the liner notes of a record he made with his ex-wife. Tellingly, America's No. 1 movie at the moment, School of Rock, is built on the premise that rock is a relic relegated to history books as something kids need to be taught (after all, they're not learning about it in the streets). It lovingly regurgitates classic 70s guitar-god clichés for examples. When it comes down to it, the best youth culture is dangerous and offbeat and audacious, and currently, rock is none of those things. It's no wonder that this week, for the first time, the Top 10 singles on the Billboard charts are all hip-hop and R&B.; By comparison, rock is middle-aged. It has lost its youthful swagger and instead acquired the sheepish vanity that comes with expanding waistlines and thinning hair. Perhaps it was inevitable, but if a mid-life crisis is in the cards, I can't think of a more entertaining one than The Darkness.","If I'd gone to journalism school rather than just gaining pre-employment experience arseing around the\n\ Michigan Daily offices ...

"Tell Balgeary, Balgury is Dead EP",Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdcabf31b7dc7155e02/1:1/w_160/1f48f33d.jpg,2003-10-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4740-tell-balgeary-balgury-is-dead-ep/,Lookout!,"Often during my tenure with this fine webmag, I seem to have had a certain ""difficulty"" getting ""facts"" ""straight."" My review for Ted Leo's fine Hearts of Oak was a telling example of this, as a number of people wrote in to dispute some of my claims regarding their man and his music, despite my unbridled enthusiasm for the LP. Fortunately for my journo-cred, Leo just dropped this brief EP, conveniently timed to remind all us crits to remember Hearts of Oak for our year-end lists. In similar piggybacking style, I'll go ahead and retract my previous erroneous statements here, so that the pristine fact-checking reputation of Pitchforkmedia.com can be restored to its previous bowling-lane luster. Retraction #1: Ted Leo is not an incredibly short person. Readers took issue with this characterization, though I distinctly remember all my close-up interactions with the man being shoulder-height affairs. Regardless, how could a scribe pass up the irresistible image of the Little Man with the Big Voice? It would, after all, come in handy for discussing Tell Balgeary, Balgury is Dead, Leo's new take-home souvenir of his current solo tour. Leo's recent one-man shows have revealed him as the rare mod-punk that doesn't turn into a sensitive coffee-shop plucker when gotten alone. Resolutely plugged-in with blurred-hand strumming away and WD40 vocals blaring, his sans-Pharmacists performances showed only a slight decrement in energy from the four-piece setup he usually tours with. For easy comparison, feast on the version of ""The High Party"" included here, wherein Leo somehow manages to navigate all the tempo complexities of the album version by himself, flying convincingly without a rhythm section. Retraction #2: Ted Leo no longer lives in Washington, D.C. I'll admit that I hadn't kept up on Leo's shifts in mailing address, and was unaware that he'd made the move to New Jersey before the release of Hearts of Oak. But can you blame me for wanting to claim him as a District hero, given the slim pickings left in the wake of The Dismemberment Plan's dissolution? For god's sake, that leaves us with nothing but El Guapo! On recent tours, Leo's been celebrating his return to Garden State residency with a version of ""Dancing in the Dark"" more spunky than The Boss ever imagined, but sadly, Tell Balgeary's budget apparently couldn't handle the royalties. Instead, Leo presents reverent, accelerated takes on tunes by The Jam, Split Enz, and Ewan McColl, whose ""Dirty Old Town"" suits Leo's Irish tendencies like syrup on bacon. Ted even tries to recreate McColl's pastoral reminiscences with his own ""Bleeding Powers"", which namedrops South Bend (though not his ex-schoolpal Brent DiCrescenzo) alongside the pint-swinging sentiment ""the road leads me somewhere/ But it's not yet to your door."" ""Bleeding Powers"" also features a tidbit of war commentary, a topic Leo explores further (if not much more deeply) on ""Loyal to My Sorrowful Country"". You can take the boy out of the District, but you can't take the politics out of the boy. Top it off with ""The Sword in the Stone"", a strong-popper in the traditional Leo style, and forecasts begin to look pretty promising for LP #4. Retraction #3: The Pharmacists are not a transitory, revolving-door backing band. Yeah, so apparently, The Pharmacists, which started out as a fictional entity for Leo's bedroom tape experiments, have a lineup that's pretty locked in place now-- bassist David Lerner and Richard Manuel-impersonating drummer Chris Wilson have provided the proverbial rock-solid rhythm for years now. I didn't realize how important they'd become on record until Tell Balgeary, though, because it turns out that a faithful representation of Leo's superb solo live shows doesn't translate so well to an ideal home listening experience. Sure, this disc reflects the passion of Ted on stage, but it also often sounds dashed-off, and not a little bit like listening to your roommate practice his punk band's set in the next room. The new songs offered on Balgeary, while promising, nevertheless appear in dehydrated form, demos waiting for full-band arrangements that will hopefully capitalize on Leo's newfound grasp of keys and dense percussion. The covers are agreeable, but somewhat predictable, never revealing new angles on his music like his live renditions of Curtis Mayfield's ""Keep on Pushin'"" do. Two tracks of woah-dude sound experimentation, hearkening back to the confused-dub of his immediate post-Chisel ""Tej"" days, further decrease the EP's validity. But Tell Balgeary, Balgury is Dead has that short-player mentality, serving not just as tour merch, but also as reassurance that Leo's vocal cords all back in order after the near-disastrous larynx cave-in he suffered on tour last spring. That Balgeary isn't as indispensable a thin-slice as 2000's Treble in Trouble is a shame, but as a taste of solo Leo for places his van never reaches, it's slightly more than a mere gap-stopper.

Instant 0 in the Universe EP,Stereolab,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a567c0084474cd0c06ee/1:1/w_160/c5d5ff44.gif,2003-10-08 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7501-instant-0-in-the-universe-ep/,Elektra,"Alright, before we get started, I need you to check this. Brent D gets his cheers and jeers from the leering public, but for my money, he contributed one of the best reviews this site's ever seen. It's not just that he found a way to out-pomo Stereolab and Jim O'Rourke, but that he did it in such a way that didn't necessarily insult anyone involved-- including fans of the record. How should I know? Because I was one of the few who actually liked Cobra & Phases, despite its flat, obviously derivative easy-listening sounds, krautrock medleys and horns cribbed from ""Playboy After Dark"". DiCrescenzo hit on all that stuff, but not below the belt. I loved the Groop, but also recognized how completely relevant his points were. Result: conundrum. The thing about latter-day 'Lab that many detractors fail to realize is that this period, rather than everything they did prior to Emperor Tomato Ketchup, is ""their sound."" Look at the progression of records from Peng! through ETK, and then notice the trend ever since. As the band worked through their infatuations with smooth-yet-experimental sounds, awkward cool, and turning French into an actual rock 'n' roll tongue, it only seems right that they would settle down with a uniform approach. Cobra & Phases, the First of the Microbe Hunters mini-LP, and 2001's underrated Sound-Dust might not have been the bloated, lazy lounge malingerers everyone makes them out to be. Well, okay, Microbe Hunters wasn't that great and Cobra could've benefited from trimming 20 minutes of fat-- BUT: I still contend these are not nadirs, but apexes of Stereolab's development. Brent called it ""stultifying""; of course, there's no accounting for taste. So it's all the more dreadful to face the facts that have sprung up over the course of their past few albums, the most obvious of which is: even if you corner the market on cocktail space jazz, it doesn't necessarily mean anyone's going to give a shit for more than a couple of records. Granted, Stereolab have a knack for making their extremely minimal song components feel greater than the sum of their parts, but that also means that they're always running the risk of crossing over into the indistinct. Until now, they've generally avoided that, but Instant 0 in the Universe (Acid Mothers, they snagged your stash!) manages to ignore the essential art-rock flourishes of Sound-Dust, and in fact, has done away with anything even remotely interesting or new: these songs sound plucked straight from cutting room floor. Which still doesn't make it terrible-- Stereolab, at this point in their career, hardly seem capable of producing any truly, offensively awful material-- but in a way, it's worse: Instant 0 leaves about as much of an impression as its title indicates. ""...Sudden Stars"" begins with a quaint Farfisa/guitar counterpoint and Laetitia Sadier's ever-distinct alto. Her vocals have always been one of my favorite sounds in new rock, and it's sad to think that Mary Hansen's won't be there to add another layer of sophistication and complexity. Nevertheless, the band's vision has survived: this is Stereolab to a tee. Unfortunately, the familiar overwhelms-- right down to the propulsive drumming at the front of the mix and yet another chord progression descended from Yes' ""Starship Trooper"" (don't fight it)-- and even the most sympathetic ears may not be able to maintain interest for the song's whole duration. ""Jaunty Monty and the Bubbles of Silence"", meanwhile, is a sprightly piece of... well, hell, I don't really need to say anything about it, do I? You know what it sounds like! All of this said, it isn't the similarities between these songs and so many others that disappoints, but that these seem so uninspired. I love the idea of splicing motorik and Gainsbourg in ""Microclimate"", but Sadier's lilting vocal melody in the waltz section sounds maybe a bit too lilting, like she meant to just go back to bed. Even their backing tracks, generally some of the most reliable in the biz, suffer from such a lack of color and energy that they could easily pass for demos. Some might take that to mean Instant 0 is a ""stripped down"" affair, that the band has simply returned to their roots. Sadly, it really does just seem flat to me. The worst part about this is that I'm wasting my chance to pump up the maligned Stereolab records on a not-necessarily-thrilling EP. I don't know if the band will ever release a great record again, and truthfully, I don't much care. They've given the indie kids and the record collector geeks theirs, and still put on a pretty tight live show; nothing much to prove these days. Still, one can always hope for another retro-futuristic hurrah. Instant 0 is not that last exultation, but I'll assume it isn't final in any respect.","Alright, before we get started, I need you to check this. Brent D gets his cheers and jeers from the ...

Ladybug Transistor,The Ladybug Transistor,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6aabf31b7dc7155cf9/1:1/w_160/28a722d4.jpg,2003-10-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4629-ladybug-transistor/,Merge,"It's easy to dismiss the Ladybug Transistor as just another prototypically sweet-faced, baroque-inclined indie pop ensemble-- or, if you're feeling charitable, an indie pop ensemble with unusually delicate arrangements and impressive longevity. But the band's careful mastery of pop precision and 60s bubblegum swells demands a far more thorough assessment (even if it winds up leading to an inevitable Neil-Diamond-by-way-of-Crooked-Fingers comparison). Since their 1996 debut, Marlborough Farms, The Ladybug Transistor have wed lush, rolling melodies to oddly somber lyrics, folding in a barnyard full of sounds (baritone harmonica, keyboards, flute, organs, flitting chamber-pop strings, horns, 12-string guitar, and the soft, sliding background vocals of keyboardist Sasha Bell) and crafting a perfectly orchestrated whole. Frontman Gary Olsen's voice-- a deep, steady warble as smooth as wet, worn pebbles, and just as cold and gray-- is so expertly controlled that it often borders on unnerving. But he'll switch gears unexpectedly, too, as easily forcing out a jolly, disembodied coo, taunting and sinister, the perfect, chuckling counterpoint to whatever shit in your universe is currently falling apart. Like the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt, Olsen's lauded for his songwriting prowess more often than his creepy pipes, but the remnants of both are guaranteed to stick around long after the record has been shelved. It might seem odd that The Ladybug Transistor waited until their unceremonious fifth studio album to go all eponymous, but it's an appropriate concession given the circumstances: The Ladybug Transistor, recorded in Tucson last spring with producer Craig Schumacher (Calexico, Neko Case), is the band's first album not recorded at Olsen's Brooklyn-based Malborough Farms studio. The relocation, however, hasn't had much of an impact on their sound: their influences (see: The Left Banke, The Smiths) and their collaborative spirit remain at the fore, with noteworthy contributions from Calexico's Paul Niehaus (on pedal steel) and Lambchop's Dennis Cronin (trumpet). Opener ""These Days in Flames"" pits a textured, upbeat piano and guitar melody against some unpredictably explicit laments: ""Every time it rains/ I'm running to my window/ To stare out at the same thing/ And cry."" ""3 = Wild"" is a bit more forthcoming with its melancholy-- its slow, meandering vocal melody (""Joked about the burns on your neck/ Laughed, our bodies in smoke"") drift in and out of pedal steel whines and shivering tambourines. Much like Olsen's vocals, the instrumentation here is always impeccably rendered, each shift meticulously planned, every component expertly placed, each note purred in pitch-perfect harmony. Consequently, The Ladybug Transistor might initially seem disarmingly untouchable here, their unfaltering movements too tweaked and controlled to ever be entirely accessible to folks in plain clothes. But there's an undercurrent of darkness on this record-- particularly in Olsen's on-the-verge voice and lyrics-- that ultimately prevents the band from ever wheeling too far out of reach.","It's easy to dismiss the Ladybug Transistor as just another prototypically sweet-faced, baroque-inclined indie pop ensemble-- or, if you ...

Ravipops (The Substance),C-Rayz Walz,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa6b1335d7bf16996e1/1:1/w_160/dfdfb96a.gif,2003-10-08 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8788-ravipops-the-substance/,Definitive Jux,"Though already known for his work with the Stronghold crew, as well as appearances on Aesop Rock's Labor Days and Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein, Def Jux's C-Rayz Walz is, with his second release, only now entering the development stages of becoming an independent persona. Far from your average punchline pugilist, he connects his slurry, erratic delivery with a voice like Pharoahe Monch meeting RZA in a darkened alley, and bases his song structures on metaphors, idioms and elaboration on his lifestyle. All of this creates a sound that seems curiously out of place on Def Jux, but could easily be confused with the traditional New York influences C-Rayz grew up listening to. Despite Walz's technically proficiency, though, one issue you'll realize early on is the lack of variety inherent on this record. When C-Rayz isn't simply hitting the listener with a barrage of clever insults, he's either reminiscing about hip-hop's golden age, talking about his family, or discussing his distaste for the current state of commercial hip-hop. Granted, he tackles these concepts quite handedly, but his lack of concern with a diverse array of topics is less than intriguing for the potential listener. And regardless of his anti-platinum rhyme campaign, Ravipops still seems to come off like a well-written commercial hustler album without the production values. Which brings us to the other major problem with Ravipops: Walz's choice of instrumental backdrops. The production is so incredibly fractured across the album that, if these tracks weren't all one disc, you might never realize they were intended as pieces of a greater whole. There's a couple DJ Premier knockoffs, some guitar melodies, and some RZA-esque cuts, all of which work pretty well with C-Rayz's style; unfortunately, ""Battle Me"" sounds like a walk through a synthetic renaissance fair and ""The Essence"" is a weak faux-jiggy organ waltz. Worst of all, though, is ""Guns and Butter"" which rides an absolutely fucking pointless bassline that shifts north and south randomly, seemingly fighting the drumkit in a manner that makes it sound completely unsuitable for rapping, let alone listening. Luckily, the album does have its highlights, most notably the aptly titled ""The Lineup"", which ropes in a mindblowing collection of underground artists. Incorporating Wordsworth, J-Treds and Vast Aire, among others, the rappers ride a light piano roll, clean bass and repeated female vocal samples with tales of childhood adventures. The standouts are the distinctive Breezly Bruin, who states that ""all crazed, I'm all day, get all A's in Ho's Economics,"" and the untouchable MF Doom, who secures a job as a school custodian and makes it known that he's ""not your man or your home team mascot."" Of course, for as many problems as I have with Ravipops, Walz shows incredible promise. If he can press himself to branch out topically and get some solid production to back him (Rjd2, where the fuck?), C-Rayz could easily spring to the fore of Def Jux's second wave. But as long as he's pushing these mediocre beats, weak hooks, and repeatedly rehashing the same shit lyrically, he remains just another young up-and-comer on a label that, despite its unparalleled success, still boils over with unrealized potential.","Though already known for his work with the Stronghold crew, as well as appearances on Aesop Rock's Labor Days ...

The Lemon of Pink,The Books,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34313d1975652138a4e/1:1/w_160/7427c5b4.jpg,2003-10-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/,Tomlab,"Has it really been fifteen months since I came across The Books? I remember clearly the first time I listened to Thought for Food. I was sitting on the sidewalk in front of my local laundromat, two loads in the washers, enjoying the shade underneath the green awning that hangs over the glass façade. Tucked into my shoulder bag I had a clutch of promo CDs that I dug out of my mailbox on the way over. My usual routine is to click through a track or two of each to get a sense of which records I want to listen to completely. After breezing through and discarding several records I've now forgotten, I snapped Thought for Food into the discman and listened straight through. It was different-- that was clear right away-- but it was an easy listen. I put down whatever I was reading, settled into my plastic patio chair, and squinted through the sunlight at the Greek restaurant across the street, concentrating on what was coming through my headphones: the familiar sound of guitar and violin cut up and mixed with vocal samples. Thought for Food was easy to love but I realized that I'd have trouble describing what made it interesting. It was too simple, too subtle; there was too much space. Now comes The Lemon of Pink. Having listened to The Books' debut god knows how many times since last summer and thoroughly absorbed its sound, the element of surprise has gone. In fact, the first time I heard the six-minute title suite that opens this album it seemed eerily familiar. In the first minute there's a repeating two-chord piano riff sourced from scratchy vinyl, a banjo, a collage of violin fragments, and a sample of a heavily accented woman intoning the nonsense phrase that gives the record its name. But then comes a surprise: naked, unprocessed vocals by a woman named Anne Doerner, far too modern sounding to be pulled from an old record. Indeed, the most apparent difference between The Lemon of Pink and Thought for Food is this record's greater use of original vocals. The Books obviously have a lot of old records lying around, so it makes sense to insert a bit of structure into their finely wrought collages. Some of the vocals find their way into tracks that are essentially proper songs, others are cut and pasted into glitched-up melodic configurations. Doerner's contribution to the title track is one of the best examples of the former. Her cracked, bluesy purr fits well with The Books' solid American roots core, and the melody is spare and understated, wisely remaining one of many elements rather than becoming the prime focus of the song. There's so much breathing room here, and her voice fills it perfectly. Books co-founder Nick Zammuto sings on several of the other tracks that play with song structure. ""Don't Even Sing About It"" is unusually dark and downcast, almost like an old Will Oldham dirge given The Books treatment, with unpredictable vocal samples cutting through the marching guitar plucking. ""Get used to hanging if you hang long enough"" is the sum total of the original lyrics, but it's the sort of cryptic splinter that suits this essentially fragmented music. ""The Future, Wouldn't That Be Nice?"" begins in typical Books fashion, with quick surges of crowd noise, vibraphone, guitar and bits of violin, but then the voice comes in, a flat sing-speak intoning Isaac Brockisms like ""the mind has a mind of its own."" I'm a little iffy on these two; where Thought for Food's ""All Our Base Are Belong to Them"" was weird and otherworldly, these vocal tracks fit neatly into the experimental indie rock landscape. Both are solid, but somehow the presence of this voice makes The Books sound just a little less special. Contrast these more song-oriented bits with the sampled voice (I think it's Doerner's again) run through the shredder on ""There Is No There"". The various instruments and samples fold in and then start to swirl into an aural kaleidoscope, and then the vocals flutter past, too quick and broken for rational comprehension but emotionally clear as glass. You don't know what they're saying, but the feeling is immediate and intense. The power of ""There Is No There"" makes me think that at this point The Books still work best as collage artists, assembling odds and ends into new and affecting compositions. The Lemon of Pink makes for an interesting contrast with Thought for Food, in part because the two records have so much in common. Several of this record's tracks that closely follow the Thought for Food template are even better than their forbears, with more dynamic range and a greater sense of development. The way the sample of a flight attendant from a Japanese airline forms the centerpiece of ""Tokyo"" is absolutely perfect, matching the editing brilliance of Thought for Food's ""Aleatoric"", and ""Take Time"" is one of the more epic 3\xBD-minute instrumentals you'll come across, building from quiet, simple samples into a joyous cluster of words and acoustic sound. The Lemon of Pink may sound a bit like this duo's debut, but it also sounds like nobody else. The Books remain more or less a genre of one.","Has it really been fifteen months since I came across The Books? I remember clearly the first time I\n ...

Like Hearts Swelling,Polmo Polpo,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d6ea9e61561daa465e/1:1/w_160/21d347ed.jpg,2003-10-07 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6388-like-hearts-swelling/,Constellation,"Sandro Perri must be both flattered and frustrated by the repeated comparisons he receives to Wolfgang Voigt. It at once legitimizes him an electronic artist-- as Voigt's Gas project is a hyper-subtle, quasi-ambient territory hardly traversed, let alone traversed well-- yet also relegates him to second fiddle: perhaps he's mentioned as a contributor to the genre, but possibly never without the connection to his predecessor. Of course, there's no mistaking the similarity: both work within the context of slowly unraveling drone compositions with liberal flourishes of natural sound, conflating mid-range white-noise hiss with a heavy rhythmic pulse. Both prefer drawn-out pieces, rarely settling for less than five minutes of (to over-generalize) a single looped figure, though each commands attention, be it with suddenly emergent melodies or the sheer hypnotic trance that skips past pop entirely. For lack of an NME-supplied genre categorization, Gas and Polmo Polpo share stock in ""orchestral noise."" Like Hearts Swelling shows Polmo Polpo in evolution from his 2002 Alien 8/Subtractif-released debut, The Science of Breathing; its updated modus operandi fits nicely with his switch to Montreal's Constellation label, where Perri shares poster space with similarly grandiose acts Do Make Say Think and A Silver Mt. Zion. Here, delving barely nil into The Science of Breathing's darker four-to-the-floor dominance (a progression in style that ironically draws him even closer to Gas), Perri now breaks through his loops with moody slide guitar. The instrument's necessarily rustic attitude dramatically differentiates the album: the blankets of distrust and melancholy that beautifully asphyxiated his previous offering are all but completely absent; what remains is hope, unspoken at each track's silent beginning, burgeoning and empowering by each track's end. ""Romeo Heart"" evokes an airplane on the runway, its cold engines spinning humbly but enough to manifest the cozy harmonics nestled inside the song's single-tone whirl. Then Perri's siren-like slide guitar takes over controls, guiding the track through stratums after stratums of atmospheric noise. As the track closes, it expertly mimics the Doppler effect's drop in apparent pitch, bestowing the drone track-- composed vertically-- with an unusually compelling forward motion. The eleven-minute ""Requiem for a Fox"" finds Perri at his most versatile, indulging everything from typical drone exercises to more slide guitar overlays to, at its end, a Manitoba-like electro-acoustic psychedelia. There's less technical forward motion to the track, but the metamorphosis that takes place at its conclusion is among the album's most compelling: the echoed train-like pulse slowly gives way to a focused rhythmic punch as Perri treats his guitar to a delicious vibrato. As the bass and pulse lock up for a tight driving finale, they cast the track in bronze as the album's clear standout. ""Farewell"" carries over the acoustic infatuation heard at the end of ""Requiem"", but Perri slowly and deliberately undermines its bucolic hee-haw, subsuming its ashes into a drone of increasingly sputtering vibrato and the slide guitar's nightingale song. It's only fitting that, having ended each drone so masterfully and completely, Perri ends the album with its title track, which summarizes the album's scope in instrumentation and approach, successfully incorporating accordion and proper stringed instruments into the album's established aesthetic as though they'd been there all along. And so, what could have come off as Like Heart Swelling's novelty track becomes instead its most properly integrated creation, a final memento of what Polmo Polpo has so carefully accomplished here: perfectly unstructured, structured sound.","Sandro Perri must be both flattered and frustrated by the repeated comparisons he receives to Wolfgang Voigt.

I sometimes worry that I'll get an inrection. REESE: Being here shouldn't unnerve you any more than I'm freaked out by Foot Locker, or Colonel Rapehawk's Burrito Sports Satellite Steakhouse. ASH: These places brim with so many contradictions. The clientele range from pragmatic activists to tarot-addled goons, so the merchandise fittingly runs the gamut from useful political analyses to superstitious hokum. And why are Gillian Welch CDs always playing? REESE: Be charitable, patriarch. Welch fascinatingly embodies modern feminism's slipperiness. She should be a cliché within a cliché wrapped in a cliché with a side of clichéradish sauce, especially under the weight of those ""Southern,"" range-roaming, country-road tropes. But her albums are weirdly fresh and weirdly, er, cool. ASH: Especially this new album with its occasional-- and radical, for Welch-- ""full band"" approach (featuring contributors to albums by rural postureminders such as Beck and Son Volt). REESE: Did you just speak in a parenthetical? Or am I inside your mind? ASH: Alls I'm saying is that points on this album have much more to do with the sparse, dolorous pop of Aimee Mann than they do with countresses like Emmylou Harris. REESE: Hey wait, Emmylou Harris covered Gillian Welch. ASH: Exactly my point. Harris is known as an expert arranger, while Mann and Welch are songwriters, even though-- ahem-- they compose with male partners. Besides, Harris covered Welch's most popular tune, ""Orphan Girl"", which every self-dramatizing spaghetti-strapper over-lip-syncs in her Honda Civic. REESE: I love that song. ASH: The song is, like, the hokey pokey of familial absentia. ""I have no mother, no father, no sister, no brother/ I am an orphan girl""? I'm gonna write one called ""Multiple Amputee"" that goes ""I have no arms, no legs..."" REESE: Metallica already did that. If you weren't stupid, you'd see that ""Orphan Girl"" is a formal eschewing of the matriarchal burdens associated with rural womanhood, just as the speaker on this album's ""Wrecking Ball"" appropriates the ""rolling stone"" stance usually romanticized by men. You know, I can't help but notice that your own Southern-tropist swoon-tune gets covered here: wasn't ""I Had a Real Good Mother and Father"" popularized by Bonnie ""Prince"" Oldham back in his days as a Palace sibling? ASH: What a tune. [ASH blushes and fingers his lip.] While we're dishing out penis-points, let's give some credit to the sweetly rendered song associated with Mississippi John Hurt, ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"". Also note that the arrangement owes a dollar or two to the first disc of Dylan's ""bootleg"" threefer. Meanwhile, your precious ""Wrecking Ball"" is just an outtake from Jason Molina's Magnolia Electric Co. with fiddle overdubs. REESE: Hmph. I see what you mean about the crossroads of seriousness and blarney, though. How can an album so reticent and measured bear a moniker as new-agey as Soul Journey? That reeks of Shirley MacLaine and that star-chart-fondling crystal-culture. ASH: A shame, because the songs are so no-nonsense, trafficking in classic idioms (riding with the ""top down"" is libertine, etc) and landscape metaphors (""lowlands"" and ""black highways"" mean trouble, etc). Except for ""One Monkey""? What the hell? ""One monkey don't stop the show""? REESE: Is it about not being distracted from the big picture by an insulting fad, such as a Nashville whorelet or a dopey politico? Is its punishing repetition purposeful, or a cave-in to Tracy Chapmanship? Maybe it's borrowing the language of pre-Civil Rights-era America, saying something about one uppity Negro not being a threat to the status quo? That explanation would offset some of the cultural baggage that this ""throwback"" music totes around. ASH: I don't know. This album's most ""bluegrass"" song (""No One Knows My Name"") is just a refashioning of ""She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes"". Seems pretty harmless. REESE: Hey, look, this store sells those bumper stickers that say THE BANJO IS AN AFRICAN INSTRUMENT! Maybe I could include Welch in my doctoral thesis on Anglosimilitude. It would fit with my bachelor's thesis, King Kut: Castration Metaphors in Old-School Rap and my master's thesis I Am the Eighteenth Pale Descendant: Steven Patrick Morrissey and Whiteness as an Othering Force. ASH: I wish I were a turntablist. ""One Monkey"" would make a mean mash-up with Whodini's ""The Freaks Come Out at Night"". REESE: Ugh. That kind of futurism, which debases art's factory-sealedness, is why I want to take refuge in pastoral works such as Soul Journey. Lightning Bolt makes me feel seventy years old and addicted to painkillers and marathons of Diagnosis: Murder. ASH: Fair enough. Welch is definitely the most relevant of the O Brother Pluck Art Thou gang of neo-yodelers. And I reckon that if you find the bleats-n-beats of The Rapture soulless, then you might love this soft, warm, but still interestingly distant work. Then again, Soul Journey remains a tad raptureless.","\n\ A Corky Linklater Film\n\

The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse / Blueprint 2.1,JAY-Z,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d6c0084474cd0c26d7/1:1/w_160/074f89b0.jpg,2003-10-07 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11764-the-blueprint-2-the-gift-and-the-curse-blueprint-21/,Roc-A-Fella,"The double album can mean a number of things for an artist. For the Wu-Tang Clan and Michael Jackson, it led to exponential career declines. For Biggie and Tupac, it led to grisly deaths. Jay-Z has chosen his own route: The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse lobbies for a position on top of the commercial hip-hop market. On his mid-to-late 90s Volume trilogy, Jay had steadily lost track of his confident street corner philosophy, but a series of battles led him to re-evaluate his career, resulting in the landmark album of his career: the prequel to this two-disc blowout was an inarguable masterwork of beautiful soul-struck production and serrated bling 'n' sting street rhymes sharp enough to eclipse even the heralded, barbs on 1996's world-memorized classic Reasonable Doubt. There's no deep concept or surrounding purpose behind this record: it's just pure confidence. Jay weaves his way through every imaginable style and flavor with unyielding expertise-- from the natural repetition of ""A Dream"" to the extreme assonance of ""The Bounce"" to the classic cocky confidence of ""2 Many Hoes""-- driving home clear evidence that his top-tier emcee ranking is deserved, and that few could be as entitled. He's straight showing off on ""Hovi Baby"": somehow flowing effortlessly over Just Blaze's ridiculous 5/4 future-cop production, Jay's lyrics sound as if they were made on the will of God, with himself as the conduit and his voice as the fluid, talking about ""chasin' the hi-hat all over the track"" to the point that ""the snare is scared of the air in here."" Equally thrilling is the varied subject matter Hova touches on. Whether he's engaged in lucid conversation with Biggie (""A Dream""), contemplating the nature of his maturation in regards to relationships (""Excuse Me Miss"", ""Fuck All Nite""), his ever-present public issues (""I Did It My Way"", ""Diamond is Forever"") or discussing the nature of his upbringing (""Some How Some Way""), even Jay's most exhausted subjects sound invigoratingly fresh. A powerful testament to Shawn Carter's underrated storytelling abilities, ""Meet the Parents"" unveils a delicate tapestry of modern black archetypes and the flaws with the African-American family structure. He begins with the family that created a thug and slowly shifts into the life that thug creates for himself as a result of his fractured upbringing. It's a tale of death, parental absence and drug dealing that spirals into a face-off between father and son, spun into a metaphor for the intense need for a solid patriarchal bond. As a premier rapper in the commercial spotlight, Carter's got a way of leveling his albums out with a wide variety of beats. Ranging from the Cake-sampling guitar strum of ""Guns and Roses"" (produced by Heavy D?!!) to the Hugo Williams connection's dark, squirt-bass stomper ""Nigga Please"" to Kanye West's anthemic chopped EWF sampling firestorm ""As One"", Jay attempts to please everyone and very nearly succeeds. Although the Tupac-flavored ambient keyboard beats aren't quite as sharp as they could be, and the uncharacteristically pedestrian Timbaland collaborations disappoint, they do offer a solid pace to the album to that virtually all other doubles lack. And pace is one of many places that Blueprint 2.1 fails. Released six months after The Gift and the Curse as a sampling of some of the album's more seemingly intriguing tracks and chart hits, it was a transparent ploy to bank on increased record sales and create the illusion of cost-effectivity, when, in fact, Blueprint 2.1 ran about the same price as the original, and offered roughly half the tracks. It's bad enough that its two bonus tracks aren't even worth talking about, but it omits nearly half the standouts from the original, leaving as many as eight stronger tracks out in lieu of lesser collaborations with dollar-winning names. 2.1 doesn't even include the song ""Blueprint 2"", effectively contradicting its purpose. So, for the classic bloated double-album prototype, the filler helps more than it hinders, as evidenced by the spectacular failure of the condensed version. Truly, Carter's vision of the streets had to stretch out over two discs, if only to handle the spectrum of influence he's drawn from and continues to create. With his final set, The Black Album, due next month under the tutelage of The Neptunes, Rick Rubin, Timbaland, Kanye, Lil' Jon and seven others, all eyes are on Hov, hoping for-- and rightfully expecting-- a classic last salvo to bookend his perfect debut. The Blueprint 2 may be less than filler-free, but it stands regardless as a testament to Jay-Z's mastery of the written and spoken word: the fortifying teaser to a pay-per-view-worthy finale.","

??(new drummer-- Jason McGerr-- Not the same energy, but DCFC more Gibbard's melodies and Walla's knobs anyway) II. The songs:
An exercise in scope: Transatlanticism dulls the edges of their usually acute divinations. A towering mass of sound: it leans (mostly lyrically) more toward Postal Service inclinations than it does previous groundwork. Case in point:
-- sunny jingle jangle of ""Title and Registration"", a Gibbard-patented melody accompanied by clear, understated guitar work replete with a stop/start drum kit and ringing tones. Will leave you singing about glove compartments. Elsewhere: anthems and super-produced moments of glory.
""The New Year"": pure arena rock. Direct and pandering. No distance between sound and receptor: play like they're running out of time, even sing about it, ""I wish the world was flat like the old days/ and I could travel just by folding the map/ no more airplanes or speed trains or freeways/ there'd be no distance that could hold us back."" Used to be Something About Airplanes and coasting down the 405-- the journey was the reward. Now it's the destination.
""We Looked Like Giants""-- fully realized anthem, true rocker- 'bout sexual discovery (old-hat subject matter --again: makes me feel experienced) a claustrophobic's nightmare.
""Expo '86"": a mini anthem that tests the waters, pulls away and then dives in headfirst before finally drying off to Gibbard's lonely plea.
""Tiny Vessels"": what could be the best moment of the album is tossed off due to lack of restraint, final third is mesmerizing. Broken by an Uluru sized wall of distortion and thrashing. Worst moment- 8 min. of ""Transatlanticism"", akin to witnessing the reunion of high school sweethearts away for a field trip weekend across a 10 acre wheat field, -- builds and builds to no avail. too romanticized. too far-sighted. Then, the old Death Cab:
""Lightness"", an updated ""Coney Island"".
""The Sound of Settling"", old mixed with new, middle Photo Album pop-sensibilities tuned in to the waning needs of maturation. But no hidden agenda (hand claps and ""bah baa/ this is the sound of settling"") talks about wanting to go grey-- it shows.
finest moments: ""Passenger Seat"", bare, spacious understated beauty w/echoes of ""Lowell, MA"".
""Death of an Interior Decorator"", vintage stuff-- overlapping guitar tones folding in on each other and beautifully realized bridge. Showcases his ability to scriptwrite.
--all together: a complete vision. A destination. CONCLUSION: (III),
Ends the album where the Stability EP left off, w/ ""A Lack of Color""-- a low-key ziplock on the freshest meal. Record IS a meal, with all courses well thought out. Ingredients may be obvious-- final taste and chef's vision remain a family secret. Just have to taste for yourself. Same cook-- bigger batch of sound.

Vincebus Eruptum / Outsideinside,Blue Cheer,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4365e6ef95969320806/1:1/w_160/5a93a7e7.jpg,2003-10-07 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11691-vincebus-eruptum-outsideinside/,PhilipsPhilips,"A lot of people will frustratingly inform you that the genius of Vincebus Eruptum lies in its overlapping of blues riffs and heavy metal guitars. A lot of people are also wrong. First, let's define the term: Vincebus Eruptum (v.): to completely dispense with traditionally composed blues song by frantically bending every string on a guitar, strumming without playing any actual notes, ramming your head against the speakers, and generally inducing a psychotic thunderstorm of sound and fury signifying nothing. There's only one reason anyone has ever been interested in Eruptuming: Leigh Stephens. In the summer of 1967, Stephens heard the accumulations of blues and rock inside his head, and formed Blue Cheer, situating himself between Cream's rhythmic tightness and Hendrix's flamboyant excess. Fortunately for us, Stephens was resolutely less experienced than either, and in the process of developing this incompetence, he inadvertently birthed punk, heavy metal, and the most primal version of the inexorable and inept guitar freak-out. Vincebus essentially acts as the juncture of the lethally lethargic, basement-murder morass of Sabbath and the vomit-spewing anxiety of early punk rock. There may be occasional blues passages, but trust me, there's no overlap. When Stephens solos, there is nothing but wind-howling terror. Blue Cheer's signature song, ""Summertime Blues"", is a prime example of this bludgeoning. The band makes several attempts to get their instruments to sound like they're playing together, but whenever singer/bassist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley accidentally forget that they're in the same band, Stephens rushes into the mix with a mind-expanding psychedelic gundown. Eddie Cochran's version actually sounded like summer; this sounds like whatever kind of season they have in a coal mine with skeleton scaffolds. The production is so lo-fi, it's practically transcendent. Whereas psychedelic used to be all about the Grateful Dead and Strawberry Alarm Clock (maybe ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" on a good day), Stephens was one of the progenitors of those gloriously nauseating spaz-outs we now know was to be the future of rock. On ""Doctor Please"", a sort of less subtle ""Doctor Robert"", Peterson yelps, ""I need your pain killers!"" while Stephens unleashes undulations of deafening wreckage and turbulent reverb. The rhythm section is barely audible, and when it is, it can barely stay ahead of Stephens. This is the kind of music Lester Bangs must have loved and Spinal Tap and Tenacious D must have mocked: musicians who, like the bands on Nuggets, live not to perfect their technique, but to simply rock. And while Blue Cheer, at this early stage, have yet to work out their kinks, their songs are already stunning: ""Out of Focus"" croaks tales of ""the magic madness"" and ""mystic dream,"" a prepubescent version of Zeppelin's bombast, while ""Second Time Around"" is a grimier and more explosive predecessor to Yes' ""Heart of the Sunrise"". Only eight months later, on Outsideinside, the songs not only contained Stephens' paroxysms, but proved some of the best the 60s ever produced. The opening track, ""Feathers from Your Tree"", begins with a drowsy hush before escalating to a strikingly driving pop song, complete with tortured teenage vocals and backup singers. When I first listened to it, I had no idea Blue Cheer had written it. Then I realized the entire middle third is a direct duplication of ""Pinball Wizard""-- or at least that's what I thought before I found out Tommy didn't come out till the next year. The Who ripped these guys off! Of course, once these acid queens get soloing, it's more like ""Speedball Wizard"" anyway: ""Sun Cycle"" is a slow rotating blues that reigns in fuzzed and tangled guitars. The version of Booker T.'s ""The Hunter"" begins as a bluesy hobble until strains of piercing guitar raze through the dinginess. ""Just a Little Bit"" and ""Come and Get It"" slow down the tempo and create the tense interaction between players that was sorely absent on Vincebus. The result is vastly more atmospheric and fulfilling, if not quite as stunningly anarchic. The one exception is the cover of ""Satisfaction"", perhaps the most exemplary version ever recorded, focused less on the music than the energy. It's as if Stephens is torturing the original. I didn't notice any remastering on any of the tracks on this two-for-one reissue, and if you already have both, there's no reason to seek this out. Putting both albums side by side, however, does contrast the two sides of the band. Vincebus is all catharsis and psychedelic mayhem; Outsideinside converts their stylistic enthusiasm and leathery attitude into structured song. If it doesn't sound as influential as Vincebus's cataclysmic insanity, it's because it defines ""classic"" rock. Everyone else was just shooting for this.","

A People's History of The Dismemberment Plan,The Dismemberment Plan,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a4c0084474cd0c2668/1:1/w_160/c918e5b8.jpg,2003-10-06 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2340-a-peoples-history-of-the-dismemberment-plan/,DeSoto,"Love them or hate them-- for there are few who find themselves between these extremes-- The Dismemberment Plan were an undeniably forward-thinking band, innovative without sacrificing accessibility, and always looking to forge new ground. It's possible that their tendency to continually transform themselves hastened their breakup, which, if you haven't been following the indie rock newswires, has been in progress for nearly a year now. The band realized there was no point in repeating themselves, and once they reached the point where they might be in danger of it, they closed up shop, though they kept touring on their existing material for months after officially calling it quits last month. As their final creative stroke, the Plan have left us with this: an album of remixes created by their fans (and a few by better-known colleagues). Around this time last year, the band posted separate tracks for each of their songs on their official website so that anybody anywhere would be able to conveniently download and refashion them as they saw fit. The band then sifted through the results and chose twelve of them for this final send-off, the appropriately titled A People's History of The Dismemberment Plan. It's an opportunity I think more bands should offer to their fans, as it has potential not just to yield interesting results, but to expose talent within their fanbases. The only question that remains, then, is how much of this has the Plan's own remix project accomplished? There's not a simple answer to that, but I can say this: some of these remixes are truly excellent, and some of them are disastrous. Certainly, it was inevitable that this project would yield mixed results, given the lack of guidelines for those involved, but it's a shame that the quality couldn't have been more uniformly high. The disc, unfortunately, gets off on the wrong foot, with a strange remix of ""Face of the Earth"" by a guy calling himself Parae, who, according to the disc's liner notes, had never even heard the band before completing the track. It's an interesting vocal cutup, but folks expecting finished results anywhere even remotely close to the original material will be immediately let down, and more importantly, Parae's rhythmic sequencing of Travis Morrison's breathing patterns and snatches of syllables wander for too long before he introduces his climax, a blast of frozen, sampled guitar and percussion. That this was chosen for inclusion-- let alone to lead the record-- is a classic case of concept trumping execution. There are a few fantastic reimaginings here, though. Drop Dynasty's ""What Do You Want Me to Say?"" is squirmy, electro-damaged hip-hop that keeps the original's verses intact but steers way left of the anthemic chorus, approximating the effect instead with a backward sample of Morrison and dropping in choice vocal bits for rhythmic effect. Cynyc takes one of the Plan's most openly poppy songs, ""Following Through"", and lays the vocals over a pumping breakbeat, shifting the vocals rhythmically so that the emphasis falls on different beats, completely recontextualizing the old melody. Grandmaster Incongruous, meanwhile, executes a pretty brilliant mashup of ""Pay for the Piano"" and Elvis Costello's ""Pump It Up"", playing with tension by altering the intensity of his breakbeat and also wiring in samples of horn hits and synthesized basslines from songs I couldn't quite place. ""Superpowers"" gets the mashup treatment as well, from Erik Gundel, who layers Morrison's voice and the song's quivering synth over the acoustic guitar from ""Ooh La La"" by The Faces (best known as the song that closes out Rushmore). It's an oddly affecting juxtaposition, and a fitting wrap-up. But the best track on this whole deal has to be Quruli and Noise McCartney's tribal/aquatic take on ""A Life of Possibilities"", a hypnotic, beautiful drift that leaves the song's verses intact, but casts it in a whole new light. There are, of course, as many misfires among the songs that finally made the cut-- most notably Cex's spastic IDM take on ""Academy Award"" (though he deserves credit for most interesting song choice). Virtually every other artist here takes a crack at something from either Emergency & I or Change, and while there's plenty that's ripe for the picking on those two albums, it would have been fun to hear more interpretations of earlier material-- The Dismemberment Plan is Terrified! is such a wildly unique and rambunctious album it's almost inconceivable that more people wouldn't have tried their hand at building something new out of it. Despite its flaws, A People's History of The Dismemberment Plan remains an interesting listen, borne of a great concept. People who weren't interested in the Plan in the first place pretty obviously won't find much to love here, but it's safe to say that fans will probably be divided into two camps: those who'll think every last one of these remixes violates the corpse of one of their favorite bands, and those who'll find enough of interest in these reevaluations of the band's catalog to give it a few listens before filing it forever away on the record shelf.","Love them or hate them-- for there are few who find themselves between these extremes-- The Dismemberment Plan were an ...

Blush Music,Wovenhand,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa859d034d5c69bf3e78/1:1/w_160/5188d0ed.jpg,2003-10-06 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8760-blush-music/,Sounds Familyre,"Since Woven Hand's eponymous 2001 debut (reissued earlier this year by the Danielson Famile's Sounds Familyre label), David Eugene Edwards has refined his revelatory vision, cramming inky atmospherics into the rusted-out gears of an apocalyptic music box. On Blush Music, this blue-eyed grandson of a Nazarene priest goes it alone again, serving up a meticulous fire-and-brimstone sermon that surpasses the work of the better known Denver-based trio he fronts, 16 Horsepower. Released initially as Blush in May 2003 on the German label Glitterhouse (who also release the debut before it found an American label), the album's ten tracks were composed by Edwards to accompany a modern dance performance choreographed by Wim Vandekeybus for his Belgian troupe, Ultima Vez. More interestingly, though, in addition to a handful of previously unreleased tracks, Blush Music revamps and expands upon a number of backwoods dirges from the debut: the last record's brief cover of Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" emerges monumentally as the fourteen-minute ""Animalitos (Ain't No Sunshine)"", sounding like a moment from Current 93's All the Pretty Little Horses, and including extended nonvocal passages, creepy children's voices, nocturnal bird sounds, bass drones, and the sharp rumble of burning wood. Likewise, ""My Russia (Standing on Hands)"" and ""Your Russia (Without Hands)""-- based on the significantly briefer ""My Russia""-- build momentum with shakers, simple percussion, organ wheezes, large doses of quivering feedback from a Gypsy caravan, and Edwards' deep bellow, a combination of Nick Cave shouts and Will Oldham's windswept bays. ""My Russia (Without Hands)"" is grounded by a heavy bassline and repeated high-pitched guitar note, and at times he sounds like a more literary, less soporific Black Heart Procession. A denser take on ""Story and Pictures"" skips like a creaking pin-box coffin until the mess drips away for the clear sounds of a piano and Edwards' less gravely vocal track: ""As a boy I drew too near/ To the love of dust."" The result of his patience and the compositional layering is a painful, almost unbelievably gorgeous madrigal: the incidental drone of Young Goodman Brown's midnight trek slowed to a crawl, the occult vapors seep in time-lapse to the most unfamiliar corners of a frightening forest. Blush Music's new material is equally tangled in the rich soil and briar patches of the deep underbrush. With fiddles, mandolins, insects, accordions, whispers, nettles, walnut pews, and splattered green flies, ""Snake Bite"" and ""Another White Bird"" are epic Rain Dogs instrumentals tortured 'til they scream. Perhaps the creepiest bit on the record, ""Aeolian Harp (Under the World)"" begins with whispers and creaking dock sounds that multiply until Edwards intones with a Bill Callahan lugubriousness: ""Now is the end of the gentile/ Pluck aeolian harp, my child/ beyond the lust of this moment/ Thin as a pine slat/ It does no good to call you mine."" His three-part prophecy-- a weird godless dream-quest-- ends when language evaporates into the sounds of a southern chain gang of ghosts. Though an avowed Christian, Edwards whittles a brutal seance, one-stepping to the pulpit with a Faulknerian soul-sickness that burrows beyond even Nick Cave's more recent Old Testament pontificating. Temporarily illuminating the opaque portions of a burnt-out interior, Blush Music is a transcendent call-and-response between a man and the variegated joy he's unearthed within the layers of his faith.","Since Woven Hand's eponymous 2001 debut (reissued earlier this year by the Danielson Famile's Sounds Familyre label), David ...

First Demo Tape,Minor Threat,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43d13d197565213bef1/1:1/w_160/124959cc.jpg,2003-10-06 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5554-first-demo-tape/,Dischord,"I tried. I did. I wanted to be excited for the release of Minor Threat's first demo, recently unearthed after being buried alive in the dank recesses of Dischord's vault. I listened to it at volume levels that made my brain beg my volume-hand for mercy. I threw myself against the walls, broke my furniture, and got into fistfights with cops that I called over myself. I got drunk and tried being ashamed to the tune of ""Straight Edge"", to no avail. ""Golly, it's really hard to be excited over this semi-historic EP,"" I discovered. First, before anybody gets their suspenders in a knot, I'm not implying that hardcore fans are self-destructive louts (just me) and I'm not demeaning a straight-edge lifestyle-- I generally prefer to stay sober so I can know when I'm having a good time rather than relying on the recollective ability of my associates. By taking the time to explain this, do I secretly think that a lot of hardcore fans take themselves too seriously? Uh... No comment. But let me be serious about one thing, and do not let this album's silly numbers overhead fool you for even a second: Minor Threat may be the single most important band in the history of hardcore. Although they lacked a fraction of the Bad Brains' soul-core musicianship, their riff-heavy attack was sharper, leaner, and at least as meaningful to the D.C. hardcore sound they helped forge; innovative enough to separate themselves from the heavier SoCal sound made famous, coincidentally, by their good friend Henry Rollins' Black Flag and scores of imitators. And after claiming a sizeable plot of music history for their band before they were even old enough to drink (not that they wanted to), MacKaye and Nelson's Dischord label continued on to virtually pioneer D.I.Y. ethics and aesthetics raising a torch to light the way, in case anyone was brave enough to follow. Again: they're maybe the most important band in hardcore-dom, and maybe it's not even a ""maybe."" They took themselves seriously, too, and for good reason, but to many, Minor Threat is still shallowly criticized for the too-grim public demeanor sometimes cultivated by MacKaye and his old bandmates. So those ""jokes"" earlier? I was just trying to break the ice; apparently, the estimable Mr. MacKaye has the same thing in mind, including some priceless photos from the recording sessions held in the playroom in Don Zientara's basement (aka Inner Ear Studios) along with the as-yet-undiscussed demo tape. As Fugazi's Instrument documentary pointed out, a band that champions meaningful ideals ought to treat them publicly with the gravity they deserve, but behind closed doors, they're occasionally known to almost smile for seconds at a time. That, at least, hasn't changed, as these ancient photos of an eighteen-year old Ian MacKaye giving a trollish scowl while wearing plastic ears and Bozo the Clown's hairpiece or Henry Rollins bashfully modeling a makeshift adult diaper will readily document. Whether due to simply romanticizing the past, or because of the obvious conviction behind Minor Threat's socio-political diatribes, it's awfully easy to forget that Minor Threat was also a group of teenagers having fun trying to (maybe not even naively) make a difference by doing something that mattered to them, and that's as awesome now as it was 22 years ago. A few photos really help put that into perspective. But those photos are the best thing about this demo. Not that the songs are at fault-- every last jagged burst of outrage against alcoholism, racism, and thoughtless violence just for the sake of proving nothing at all in ""Straight Edge"", ""Guilty of Being White"", and ""Small Man, Big Mouth"" rings with as much immediacy as it ever has. These are the very same songs that have meant so much to impressionable, dissatisfied young people, inspiring them to look for more in the world, maybe emblazon the tell-tale X's on the backs of their hands, not just in 1981, but every year since. Unfortunately, anything included here can be found on the much better and, as the name implies, more complete Complete Discography, almost to the note, which means even completists have little to gain.","I tried.

Käärmelautakunta,Alamaailman Vasarat,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03ac0084474cd0bfb00/1:1/w_160/39b4f626.gif,2003-10-06 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/95-kaarmelautakunta/,Silence,"Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but pick up and move to Finland. In the summer, it's almost unbearably hot where I live, my rent's too high, and no offense family, but you're just not cutting it. Furthermore, the Fins have the best music: in the last year I've been fortunate enough to jam to new records by Circle, Luomo, Varttina, Gjallarhorn, Pharaoh Overlord, Uzva and now Alamaailman Vasarat. They say it's cold there. They say people drink profusely and go for weeks without talking. Never mind all that, I'll just stake out a Helsinki street corner somewhere, slip a Sibelius disc in the Walkman, and witness the magic. I'm going to do that right now. However, my love of all that Finnish music is only eclipsed by my tendency for procrastination: bringing you the details on AV's Käärmelautakunta will have to do. This band (translated as ""The Hammers of the Underworld"") is an offshoot of the defunct avant-prog ensemble Höyry-Kone, who were as likely to break into Iron Maiden as they were to launch epic King Crimson-style rave-ups. Drummer Teemu Hanninen and bassist-come-saxophone player Jarno Sarkula began AV as way to integrate more of an acoustic texture into their music, and the result is something of kick in the gut to traditional Finnish folk. Chiefly, where their country's odd-meter dances and tart, minor-chord hymns seem like the music of a lost mythology, AV injects a forceful, metallic dread into the forms. In addition to drums and sax, they feature pump organ and two cellos. This instrumentation might lead you to believe they play chamber music-- and on occasion they do, though when the cellos hit the distortion pedal, things get heavy, heads bang and all Valhalla breaks out. Käärmelautakunta is AV's second record, and makes a great case for them being the pre-eminent proponents of the supposed ""ethnic brass punk"" tag they give themselves. As far as I know, they're the only band actually playing this stuff, though in spirit at least, I can see valid comparisons to other European tricksters like Uz Jsme Doma or in their heavier moments, Scandinavian Black Metal. Still, the somber beauty in tracks like ""Vanha Iapsuudenystäva"" makes clear these guys are no mere metal mongers. Piano and cellos begin the slow waltz with lilted, moaning figures that might pass as straight gypsy funeral music. One cello rises unto its upper register to take the melody, and when the percussion and saxophone enters, the tune's tragic, circus-orchestra melancholy is almost too much to take. AV has done a little soundtrack work, and I can very easily see this tune during the closing credits to a movie about the death of a shoemaker who moonlit as a mime for the czar. A subtle Klezmer influence works through some of the songs, such as the breakneck oompah of ""Lentävä Mato"" (or ""Flying Wyrm""), to which I dare anyone to attempt to dance. The middle section is again reminiscent of some threepenny Eastern European melodrama best suited for sad clowns, but is quickly disintegrated by manic cymbal flares and the furious sax-led melody. ""Vasaraaasialainen"" (""Vasar-Asian"") is at once elegant and raw, with its buoyant pump organ and razor-sharp cello bassline. Sarkula's fanfare should sound familiar to anyone digging John Zorn's Masada, but rather than Semitic free jazz, the vibe here is pure Finnish ominous joy. The band drops away in the middle for a surprisingly gentle soliloquy of organ and cello, and returns with a bang right back to the dance. It's as celebratory, irresistible a moment of music as I've heard this year. The harsher passages on Käärmelautakunta, such as the sludging menace of ""Kivitetty Saatana"" or relatively straightforward metal of ""Astiatehdas"" (""Dish Factory"") are actually the least engaging, if only because AV doesn't get to investigate their more subtle strengths. That said, just so you know, the closer ""Jää, Hyva Mieli"" will physically rip your neck from its shoulders if you get to close. I still want to check out Finland at some point, if only to soak in some of the culture that produces this stuff. Until then, AV comes very recommended.","Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but pick up and move to Finland. In the summer, it ...

Bamp-bam-bam, dobba-dobba-dat-da. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dah. Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there. I was just trying to reach my word count as I write a review dooby-doo doot-doo of the new Erykah Badu disc. Being a fan of nu-soul involves a superhuman amount of patience-- D'Angelo and Badu both routinely take 3+ years to drop new records-- and despite its fifty-minute length, Worldwide Underground is listed as an EP as a means of discerning it from a proper follow-up to 2000's Mama Gun. Here, Badu scribbles-- in a nattering Fiona Apple style, no less-- ""Freakquency is born and neo-soul is dead."" Given that it's taken three years to drop on EP of purported idiom, does it mean even longer waits? This disc contains more filler and fluff than her fresh-picked fro can symbolize on the cover. ""Bump It"" delineates the problem with time. The first half of its nine minutes is relaxed, comfy soul cushion, firmed by a hip-hop click and intonation of the title command. That focus soon starts to slump in the seat, though, devolving into another five minutes of congas and croaked adlibs of boo-pee-doopy-doo's, some courtesy of Zap Mama's Marie Daulne. Building slowly on a descending keyboard vamp and Badu's panned rhythmic coos, ""I Want You"" blossoms into percolating and passionate, high on smoldering lust. But chugging holy water, picking up paperbacks, or toting yoga mats, nothing can quite touch that initial tingle. Burning out like joints and crushes are wont to do, the vamp goes limp, lackadaisically slowing tape before punching in a... um, Lenny Kravitz guitar solo, which makes it easy to forget the earlier power of its eleven minutes. Tighter tracks like ""The Grind"" and ""Love of My Life Worldwide"" ride the beats with soulful, vocal fringe looped ad infinitum, perfect as instrumental flips for hip-hop night at the Black Betty. Choruses of ""keep the glock on lock"" or ""ring-ding-dong"" and folks like Dead Prez, Queen Latifah, Angie Stone, and Bahamadia stepping to the mic carry that informal, if not consistently inspired, level of interplay. Where scarcely sketched-out words and ideas have a tendency to fall into that painful American Idol vat of melismas, Badu keeps the proceedings here buoyant and relaxed with that supple-lipped scat of hers, stretching out scant syllables at her lounging, loopy leisure. It's nonsensical (lacking Baduizms or pleas to kiss her neck), conveying instead that small, spacy joy of puffing in the back of the ride. Opening the music up and just letting the tape unfurl catches moments unattained otherwise, but as it stands, Worldwide Underground could use some tightening up.","Boo-da-da-da-doo.

After piecing together a magnificent patchwork tent of bark, calico fabric, twisted vines, and fallen stars, the duo-- featuring ex-members of experimental folk troupe Iditarod-- sets up an austere camp in the enchanted psych-folk glen also inhabited by Ghost, Charalambides, Six Organs of Admittance, Fursaxa, and the Jewelled Antler Collective. In addition to Jeffrey Alexander's guitar (finger-picked and bowed) and Miriam Goldberg's cello (pitch-shifted and ring modulated), Black Forest/Black Sea incorporate hissing short-wave radio, omnichord, haunting vocal melodies, saxophone, rusty percussion, 8-rpm phonograph, reel-to-reel noise, drone, feedback, fireside crackles, and some general knob turning. Catchier, darker, and less composed than their Iditarod forebears, Black Forest/Black Seas's diminutive freak-outs are surprisingly addictive. ""Sevastopol"", which reverences the Ukranian Black Sea fishing port, is an autumnal patch of creepy chamber-music woven with repetitious arpeggios, sturdy cello, backward loops, and the scent of a woodsy bacchanalia. The heavily-plucked ""Blackbird on Gray Sky"" employs female vocals and swirling instrumentation to lock into its groove, a straightforward troubadour piece until the vocals double and crunchy percussion begins to accompany what sounds like a warped singing saw, bird calls, spectral voices, and shimmering electronics. ""Beautiful Here"", meanwhile, is more trebly and compressed, a muffled sonic effect like the strains of Medieval bards leaking to your eardrum from someone else's headphones. The lyrics capture the deceptively simple remembrance of a forestal epiphany: the song ends with a field recording of birds, breezes, trees. Here and elsewhere, Black Forest/Black Sea tweak a silvan melancholy; even when the players are happy, it's depressing. Though each song is successful in its own small way, on ""Sunday Market"", the acid-folk finally explodes outward with a jangling astronomy. Locating the bedroom version of Magic Hour's transcendent density, a quick Casio beat and snowballing of layered sounds-- alto sax, jarring spring reverb, and caterwauling feedback pretending to be a pack of crows-- catapult the listener into quaking treetops. If every track reached these heights, this record would be required listening; triple the length of ""Sunday Market"" and godhead is not simple hyperbole. The finale, ""Lump in Throat"", neatly brings the vibe back down to earth; its organ drones and synthesized drum beat lay a foundation for end-time stargazing, intuitively capturing the fragile rhythms of cracked branches: place a pillow over your head, grab your water-damaged copy of The House of The Seven Gables, and await your next personal witch hunt. Regardless of the modest earlier tracks and the brevity of the whole affair, there's plenty of beauty shot through this old-world sleepwalk. Especially impressive as a debut, at this point Black Forest/Black Sea offers a gorgeous snapshot of the free psych underground, one of the purest spaces of otherworldly terrain in the current musical landscape. I look forward to future incantations.","On their debut, Providence-based Black Forest/Black Sea offer seven chilly field recordings placed within a half-improvised framework of guitar ...

Dear Catastrophe Waitress,Belle and Sebastian,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25ec0084474cd0c0018/1:1/w_160/9597783c.jpg,2003-10-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/633-dear-catastrophe-waitress/,Rough Trade,"One of the most beloved, bewitching, misunderstood, and eventually disappointing bands in recent history, Belle & Sebastian did the near-impossible in the Internet era: They seemed to appear out of nowhere. Admittedly, there was also a time (recently, in fact) when I'd wished they'd have mysteriously vanished as well, exorcising the dark spots of their post-1998 output in order to keep their reputation-- or at least Stuart Murdoch's-- in respectable shape. From their inauspicious beginnings in 1995, the collective emerged from Scotland with wistful, nostalgia-laden indie pop that examined sexual frustration, shiftlessness, loneliness, and isolation. Murdoch's songs-- often punctuated by proper and place names-- painted expressionist, detail-oriented worlds that, when they connected with a listener, often left an indelible, deep impression. What went wrong is typically chalked up to a split in songwriting duties, a practice that made their third and fourth albums, The Boy With the Arab Strap and Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant, disjointed, frustrating listens. The band's choice to democratize, allowing a fair number of songs from each band member, negated the singularity of Murdoch's vision, often at the cost of his wit and charm. This all-inclusive measure also resulted in the band drifting toward a pastiche of too-familiar touchstones: 60s baroque pop, Northern Soul/Motown, and folk-rock. On their fifth proper album, Dear Catastrophe Waitress, Belle & Sebastian continue their exploration of pastiche, diversifying their sonic palate to include 70s soft-rock, the irreverent pop of 10cc and Squeeze, and bubblegum. Here, the band's once-misguided ambition is tailored and cut by famed producer (and founder of notorious 1980s art-pop groups The Buggles and The Art of Noise), Trevor Horn, who aids the band in making a complete 180-degree turn from wry, wistful folk-pop to sophisticated, tight, sometimes-complex arrangements with a keen attention to detail. Horn's touch is most effective on ""Stay Loose"" and ""I'm a Cuckoo"", two ambitious classic AM pop gems that-- like the best of his past production work-- threaten to spill over into the absurd but instead remain delightfully audacious. Ironically, with a new-found ability to rectify their once at-odds musical interests, Belle & Sebastian have emerged as shiny happy people, becoming that of which they were always falsely accused: t*ee. That label was always more appropriate to the infantilism-obsessed, Sanrio-loving element in their fanbase, while the band itself traded in innuendo, sinisterism, anxiety, and sketches of unfulfilled childhoods. But here, songs such as ""Roy Walker"", ""You Don't Send Me"", and the semi-creepy Godspellian ""If You Find Yourself Caught in Love"" are so bubblegum they could have been staples of any number of early 70s TV families, from the Bradys to the Osmonds to the Partridges. That may sound dreadful but Belle & Sebastian manage to do a lot of things right-- including ""You Don't Send Me"", whose strength lies in its effective application of aesthetic. ""Piazza, New York Catcher"" manages to come off like a woozy, drunken version of the Murdoch demo ""Rhoda"", and it's his most lyrically complex work here, reminiscent of highlights from the past couple of albums such as ""Sleep the Clock Around"", ""The Boy With the Arab Strap"", ""The Model"", and ""There's Too Much Love"". Certain tracks do flirt with reminders of Belle & Sebastian Mk I-- namely ""Lord Anthony"", finally given a proper release years after it was written, and ""Wrapped Up in Books""-- but these throwbacks are temporary, bones tossed to diehards unable to cope with the band's decision to trade their bedsit infamy for bouncy, pogo-pop. On one hand, Dear Catastrophe Waitress ranks as one of the most delightful surprises of the year, although that's primarily because I'd completely given up on them. On the other hand, it's a very flawed record that at its quirky worst features harmonies so brow-furringly cheery they'd be comfortable amidst a cruise-ship revue or one of Up With People's halftime routines. It's not at all what one might call a ""return to form""; rather, it's a large step toward a new, more appealing direction than the band had otherwise been heading. At present, they're almost a new entity entirely, which makes this the Belle & Sebastian album for people who never really liked Belle & Sebastian. I realize that for a large portion of Belle & Sebastian fans-- most of them young and American-- lots of elements of the band's past matter little. The myth, the shambolic performances, the radio sessions, the dubbed cassettes of Tigermilk, the band's refusal to talk to the press, releasing only non-LP tracks as singles, not featuring the band on its sleeves, Murdoch's place in a songwriting lineage that includes early Orange Juice, The Smiths, and Felt-- it's now all ancient history. If that's indicative to you of what's become problematic with the band, you may want to approach this album with caution. If, however, ""Legal Man"" is among your favorite Belle & Sebastian songs, buy this immediately.","One of the most beloved, bewitching, misunderstood, and eventually disappointing bands in recent history, Belle & Sebastian did the near-impossible in ...

God's Got It: The Legendary Booker and Jackson Singles,Reverend Charlie Jackson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2edb1335d7bf16985dc/1:1/w_160/bc48be1e.jpg,2003-10-05 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6899-gods-got-it-the-legendary-booker-and-jackson-singles/,CaseQuarterAUM Fidelity,"After wading through the shallow molasses of Spiritualized's agnostic gospel slop, I was in need of a true church catharsis. And here I will give praises to the usually jazz-specific AUM Fidelity label (home to many William Parker projects), Lynn Abbott, Kevin Nutt, and 50 Miles of Elbow Room writer/editor Adam Lore for their efforts to bring to light these privately pressed singles of Southern gospel done by Fender Mustang-slinging preacher, The Reverend Charlie Jackson, from 1970 to 1978. Picking up the guitar at age ten, and learning a few blues tunes, Jackson was given an ultimatum by his mother which turned him away from secular music and towards a career of preaching and playing for his church. Using donations collected from parishioners on Sunday, as well as some of his personal funds, Charlie Jackson performed and preached a 15-minute radio show, which in turn led him to recording sides for the tiny New Orleans label, Booker. This collection's title track is true testament, formed from the simple sound of strummed strings and handclaps. The good Reverend belts over the din about the mighty benevolence that can never be depleted, and the three parishioners that clap along sound far more infinite than their ranks would hint. ""God's Got It""'s guitar tone lands somewhere between Sterling Morrison's late-period VU chug and the irresistible thrust of stomping and clapping that-- with a bit of open listening-- could easily mix into T.Rex's Electric Warrior, any sort of jangly garage thump, or even some Kompakt shuffle-step. All share a persuasive, percussive force that gets the body moving with ecstatic fervor, believer or no. Like all earthly pleasures, though, its three minute run is a bit too short. The remaining sides follow that same raw sound pattern, of floorboard stomp, powerful yet gentle vocal testimony, and that ether-shimmying guitar. The sanctified, low key numbers like ""My Eternal Home"" and ""Lord You're So Good"" even show a glimmer of that cast-out blues. A bit of preacher hollering pushes and pulls the fine rural metaphor of ""Wrapped Up and Tangled Up in Jesus"". Starting out with the seemingly nondescript talk of fishing, every simple action of that relaxing sport turns to motions of overwhelming spiritual import, the preaching portion turning into a motivational musical stomp. ""Testimony of Rev. Charlie Jackson"" is a tour de force, along the lines of Rev. Gary Davis' ""There Was a Time That I Went Blind"" in terms of debilitation as redemption. Detailing his first stroke (his second, in 2002, has left him unable to speak, although he still performs), the track goes into harrowing detail about how he could not speak, frequently interjecting-- along with his congregation-- a frightening wordless cry to the Lord that rattles the rafters. As he mentions his loss of speech, he turns to the guitar as an instrument of speech, voicing a vibrato-laced solo that's so intimate and spiritually satisfied as to be a bedside prayer by ""Pops"" Staples (or even Loren Mazzacane-Connors), an aural nimbus all about it. A real hit in the soul.","After wading through the shallow molasses of Spiritualized's agnostic gospel slop, I was in need of a true church ...

Let's Make This Precious: The Best of Dexys Midnight Runners,Dexys Midnight Runners,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5313d197565213b07a/1:1/w_160/34363102.jpg,2003-10-05 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2522-lets-make-this-precious-the-best-of-dexys-midnight-runners/,InterscopeEMI,"England and the United States aren't only separated by a common language, but by a common pop landscape as well. In the UK, Dexys Midnight Runners had eight top 20 hits and, to some, their leader Kevin Rowland is a beloved icon. In the U.S., Dexys are essentially remembered as one-hit wonders. If you're going to be remembered for a single track, you could do a lot worse than ""Come on Eileen"". From the instantly recognizable strings and thump tha-thump of its bassline through its manic finale, it's an infectious gem-- possibly the only song I've loved continuously for the past 20 years. And hidden in plain view beneath that familiar shell is one of the most brilliant odes to the invincibility of youth in rock history. Buoyed by his sexual awakening, Rowland announces an allegiance with each of his parent's youth culture and insists that he's ""far too young and clever"" to grow up and turn into those he sees in his town ""with their tired eyes sunk in smoke-dried faces/ Resigned to what their fate is."" As wonderful as ""Come on Eileen"" is, to say that's only part of the Dexys story is a gross understatement. Let's Make This Precious, an 18-track compilation released to coincide with Rowland's reformation of the band for a UK tour and to record two new tracks (both of which are included) makes a succinct argument for Dexys through the UK looking glass. Over the course of the band's first lifetime, Dexys ran through a series of incarnations and looks. They started playing horn-driven soul and dressing first in proto-New Romantic lamé and then Mean Streets-inspired street gear, made Celtic- and fiddle-inflected music in dungarees and facial hair, and followed that with heartfelt, honest, piano-filled ballads and a Brooks Brothers/Ivy League motif. Through it all, Rowland retained a professional approach, an insistence on high standards that was coupled with a restless pursuit of individualism, a hunger for passion, elements of beauty, wit, and style, and a disdain for safe mediocrity and careerism. Right from the Stax-like start it was a winning formula, best evidenced early on by the Northern Soul homage ""Geno"" and ""There, There My Dear"", an acerbic open letter to hipsterdom on which Rowland's vitriol overwhelms his ability to enunciate. Following the success of debut album Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, Rowland formed a muscular new version of Dexys and toured as the Project Passion Revue. That group never recorded a studio album but are thankfully represented here by a pair of scorching BBC performances (""Until I Believe in My Soul"" and ""Let's Make It Precious""), as well as the singles ""Plan B"" and ""Show Me"" (both of which were later re-recorded in drastically different versions). Over the course of Dexys final two albums-- the worldwide hit Too-Rye-Ay and the jarring, career-sinking Don't Stand Me Down-- Rowland engaged in courageous and sometimes painful self-examination with increasing lucidity and beauty. On Don't Stand Me Down, Rowland shifts between personal monologues and his expressive singing voice in an attempt to reconcile memories and articulate his identity. Perhaps aware of the disarming nature of honesty, Rowland repeatedly asks permission to speak his mind and heart (""May I be clear on this point?"" ""Can I reminisce?"" ""Let me put it another way""). Rowland's lack of confidence was even evidenced in his waffling on his choice of song titles. Two of the three Don't Stand Me Down tracks included here underwent name changes in the time since their original release. The tribute to his Irish heritage once known as ""Knowledge of Beauty"" is now ""My National Pride"". What was once ""Listen to This"" is now ""I Love You (Listen to This)"". Rowland's failure to give that second song its intended title is particularly revealing because it's about the consequences of his inability to admit admiration for a woman. That's also a theme explored on the 12-minute opus ""This is What She's Like"", in which Rowland struggles to articulate the sensation and mystery of love and attraction. In the end, the best he can muster is letting the music do the talking. With their two new tracks, Dexys manages the rare trick of picking up largely where they left off. ""My Life in England"" is a characteristic stroll through Rowland's childhood memories. Far better is ""Manhood"", so perfect and graceful a comeback that it at once threatens to make any other new songs superfluous and gives rise to the hope that there are yet more gems from Rowland to come. It's a confessional track on which Rowland admits his insecurities and dread, recounts his emotional failures, and even includes a call-and-response reminiscent of much of Don't Stand Me Down. ""Manhood"" is all the more heartbreaking as it's followed here by the holding out for hope of ""Tell Me When My Light Turns Green"", an early Dexys soul track that illustrates Rowland's failings and fears as a young man and the belief that he'd grow out of disappointment and pain. ""I've seen quite a bit in my 23 years/ I've been manic depressive/ And I've spat a few tears,"" he says, determined that he'd eventually get the go-ahead to find happiness. The tracklist for Let's Make This Precious-- selected by Rowland himself-- isn't perfect, but it's a strong introduction. The band's covers of ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and ""Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache"" and the self-penned hit ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" are all fine but are included at the expense of more unique, rewarding gems. (Most notably: ""Liars A to E"", ""Reminisce (Part 2)"", ""I'm Just Looking"", ""Keep It"", ""The Occasional Flicker"", and ""Dance Stance/Burn It Down""). It's a minor issue in the grand scheme of both the return of Dexys and the opportunity to redress their relegation to the margins of pop's history books. That's fitting because Rowland has spent his career redressing his own past and voicing and airing his fears, yet his often confessional music doesn't typically afford him reconciliation with the details of his life. He rarely draws conclusions in his narratives and stories, demonstrating wisdom and strength often only in hindsight. Instead of clarity, he often bumps against continued confusion as he attempts to redraw the map of his life. Hopefully, this return will go a long way to redrawing the legacy of Dexys, giving people an opportunity to follow Rowland's lead and gain wisdom of his strength and beauty with the benefit of hindsight. He deserves to sing more than one song forever.","England and the United States aren't only separated by a common language, but by a common pop landscape as ...

Year of the Rabbit,Year of the Rabbit,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab17ea9e61561daa5cd7/1:1/w_160/66a5203b.jpg,2003-10-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8896-year-of-the-rabbit/,Elektra,"Only in L.A. The city's influence on these four indie rock expats is almost palpable: Here they are, a brand new band and their self-titled debut, and they've already got a logo. See it there, on the chain-- the shiny, streamlined Volkswagen Bug silhouette of a rabbit. Cool, huh? It's all over everything, including the band's dot-net website, where you might even be able to order that smart little rabbit's foot trinket. (I didn't check.) It's odd that this posturing group of Hoobastank-esque Becoming-the-Band dropouts would be led by Ken Andrews (late of Failure) and count Jeff Garber (Castor, National Skyline) among its members. While those bands never struck as particularly humble, they did have an innate sense of indie ethics and pride. And even if you can't fault them for aiming for the commercial limelight after years of (undoubtedly) struggling to make rent, you'd think you could at least expect them not to autopilot through a full album's worth of incessant one-note whining. Suffice to say, any Garber fans seeking more of the expansive, exploratory, unpretentious rock associated with Hum, the heralded 90s rock band from which he's but twice removed, will be sadly disappointed. The band wastes no time showcasing their uninspired, formulaic, and oft-recycled sonic and lyrical propensities. The opener, ""Rabbit Hole"", sets the tone for the record; radio-friendly power guitar with attitude and sturdy drumming molded into tight little rock songs with luminous production and machinelike craftsmanship. But, technical proficiency aside, it's little more than a desperate Foo Fighters song. The verisimilitude is actually striking, given Andrews' similarly angstful but disenchanted delivery of, ""Cause we can get high again/ We can get high, yeah/ We can just fly."" And since Andrews himself has engineered for folks like B.R.M.C., Sense Field, and Pete Yorn, he's got that punchy corporate gloss down pat: his production is as vapid and sparkling as his music. Which brings us to the lyrics, which are platitudinally freighted in from a Los Angeles high school freshman's algebra notebook, replete with bourgeois drug references and fashionable apathetic musings. Who needs the third person? Never YOTR. ""I can't break out/ From this blanket of doubt/ Got me trapped in a maze of shadows."" ""If I'm trying to be hidden/ You still see me.../ If my whole world is crashing it won't matter/ I can keep it together when you are here."" The latter lines are from ""Hold Me Up"", the record's requisite acoustic-with-strings moment, and break from open discourse on feeling down, getting picked up, not giving a fuck, and keeping it together amidst so much estrangement. (I hope I didn't just inadvertently plagiarize anything from them.) I'm still not sure which bear more of a striking resemblance to each other-- the songs or the band members. Now, if you turn your brain off-- and I mean absolute suspension of conscious thought-- you might be fooled into thinking a few moments here genuinely rock. Unfortunately, as soon as your attention is secured (which admittedly may be never), the moment is summarily lost. After all, a gourmand in the Orient might salivate at the smell of roasted Dachshund, but it won't leave him any more prone to tolerance when realization hits home. If you're hungry for this sort of thing, I know a great town for you.","Only in L.A. The city's influence on these four indie rock expats is almost palpable: Here they are ...

Big Star Story,Big Star,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a431b1335d7bf16988d2/1:1/w_160/2537433a.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1078-big-star-story/,Ryko,"The best of intentions sometimes go astray, and good people sometimes do bad things. That's the best way I can think to sum up Big Star Story, a retrospective compilation so riddled with problems it's difficult to decide where to start talking about them. It seems pretty obvious that the folks at Ryko were trying to come up with a set that could serve both as an introduction to the band's work and as a sort of capsule overview of a band whose status in the rock canon is nothing short of mythical. The result, unfortunately, does the group's legacy a tremendous disservice. Perhaps the single greatest sin of this collection is that it's patently unnecessary. Anyone who wants an introduction to Big Star should just pick up their first two albums, #1 Record and Radio City, which are still available as a two-for-one on a single disc from Ardent Records and usually list for around $13.99. If you want more, track down Ryko's own reissue of the band's swansong, Third/Sister Lovers, a release that gathers virtually every song cut during the chaotic sessions that birthed that album. Congratulations, you now own every piece of Big Star's essential output. If you really want to go crazy, you can even shell out for Big Star Live, which catches the band near their peak in concert, and Nobody Can Dance, a compilation of some outtakes and sundry live performances (for the hardcore only). After that, there's nothing left but the solo albums. Big Star Story's superfluousness established, there's also the fact that it doesn't even live up to its name. This is not the ""Big Star Story"" it claims to be-- the tracks aren't even in chronological order, and two of the selections, ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You & Your Sister"", aren't Big Star songs at all. These last two are actually the A- and B-sides of a solo single Chris Bell single released on Chris Stamey's Car Records after Bell had left the band. Suffice to say, you'll get a few scenes from Big Star's career here, but you'll never be able to glean the plot from the haphazard tracklist. And about that tracklist: it is theoretically possible to compile a satisfying ""best of Big Star"" release, but this doesn't even come close. First, considering the formidable songwriting talents of Alex Chilton and Chris Bell (and even Andy Hummel), why on earth are there two covers on here? Loudon Wainwright III's ""Motel Blues"" is a great song, and Chilton handles it well, but T.Rex's ""Baby Strange"" just sounds creepy when Chilton warbles, ""I just wanna ball ya,"" and aside from the quality of the performances, they're just not Big Star songs-- nor are they essential enough pieces of the band's oeuvre to justify wasting the space on them. They're not integral to the story, you might say. Each album is fairly well-represented, with five tracks from Third and four each from #1 Record and Radio City, but the sequencing is jarring, highlighting just how drastically different Third is from its predecessors. Further injustice is served by the fact that ""Mod Lang"", ""You Get What You Deserve"" (from Radio City) and ""Don't Lie to Me"", (from #1 Record) are each presented in inferior alternate versions culled from Nobody Can Dance instead of their definitive versions, while ""Thirteen"" (from #1 Record) is snatched from Big Star Live (an admittedly strong performance, but not as rending as the original). The moment where the disc's inherent clumsiness comes into sharpest focus is the one where the crystalline, majestic harmonies of #1 Record's ""Ballad of El Goodo"" give way to Third's crumpled centerpiece, the haunting death whisper ""Holocaust"". Though both are excellent songs, they don't share a state of mind, nor do they sit well next to each other. The reason Big Star's first two albums work so well on a single disc together is that they're fundamentally similar-- each captures the sound of some anglophile kids from the American heartland perfecting a ragged brand of power-pop fit for the ages. Those albums feel like the band knows they're destined to be huge-- the strumming is confident, the hooks are punchy, the awkward, everyman vocals somehow swagger, and there's exuberance in even the most subdued songs. That the feeling persists on Radio City is somewhat remarkable considering the public indifference that met #1 Record at the time, and the fact that Bell departed during the sessions, despondent at the band's lack of success. Two years later, the band still hadn't made it, and you can hear it all over Third. It's a recorded document of a band disintegrating while simultaneously trying to grow. The expansive production and experimentation of that record are wholesale left turns from their earlier material, and the final result is a brilliant, timeless shambles. Removed from their natural surroundings, ""Nightime"", ""Holocaust"", ""Thank You Friends"", ""Jesus Christ"", and ""O, Dana"" are all still good songs, but they carried more power as parts of a logical whole. And, as mentioned before, Ryko's reissue of that album is everything a reissue should be-- informative, comprehensive, and brilliantly mastered. Of course, I still haven't mentioned the most heinous aspect of this compilation: the bait track. Yes, there's a song on this disc that has never been released before, called ""Hot Thing"". Completists, beware: this is unquestionably the worst track to have ever been branded with the Big Star name-- worse, even, than the rotten Third-era outtake ""Downs"". Recorded by the reunion lineup in the 90s, it's a lifeless, amelodic song that should have been better considering that Alex Chilton, Jody Stephens and Posies co-frontmen Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow all share its songwriting credit. Even the horn part sucks. And the worst part is that it's included in lieu of any of a dozen other fantastic songs. If this compilation is truly trying to tell the Big Star story, where are important chapters like ""Watch the Sunrise"", ""Stroke It, Noel"", ""Way Out West"", ""You Can't Have Me"", ""I'm in Love with a Girl"", ""Kizza Me"", ""Kangaroo"", ""When My Baby's Beside Me"", ""What's Going Ahn"", and-- you get the point. Seriously, even if you've never heard Big Star and have no idea where to start, you should still head straight to the albums. They're available on a grand total of two discs, and both of those discs belong in the collection of anyone who ever loved the sound of pop songs played on guitars. If you want to keep going from there, it's up to you, but for God's sake, don't trust this thing to start you off on the right foot.","The best of intentions sometimes go astray, and good people sometimes do bad things.

Gallowsbird's Bark,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7513d197565213b72e/1:1/w_160/d77bdcdb.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3271-gallowsbirds-bark/,Rough Trade,"In a grand move to restore liner notes to their informative zenith, the inky little paper accompanying Gallowsbird's Bark offers a handful of (supposedly) autobiographical clues to The Fiery Furnaces' raucous brother/sister gambol: ""Matthew encouraged Eleanor to come down in the basement to make their first Fiery Furnaces music together. Maybe he should have hit and stabbed and smashed her. But he just swore."" Despite some implied tongue-in-cheekiness (and the obvious fact that relentless sibling posturing is an awfully exhausted conceit right now, even if these kids really are related), it's a surprisingly apt and insightful peep into the bright blue heart of The Fiery Furnaces' blaze: violence, dark rooms, boy/girl handholding, and big selfless compromises all vie for attention on this debut, a feisty blues-rock barn-dance with enough pings and yelps to keep everyone's little hands curled tightly into fists. The Furnaces' electric guitar, drums, sparingly applied bass, and freewheeling piano riffs recollect everything from Muddy Waters to the Rolling Stones, and Gallowsbird's Bark plays like a big, half-drunken romp through golden-era rock 'n' roll-- airy and thrilling and shifty as hell. Lyrics mostly consist of quasi-rambling witticisms that somehow come together in the delivery; Eleanor Friedberger's brash, oddly assured warble (the evenly hollered ""I pierced my ears with a three-hole punch/ I ate three dozen donuts for lunch"") is lovingly reminiscent of the kinds of semi-absurdist snickers that Dylan got away with in the late 60s (check the baffling-but-somehow-not credo, ""The sun isn't yellow/ It's chicken,"" from ""Tombstone Blues""). Likewise, the duo's spare, confrontational guitar riffing is grating only insofar as it jars; blues-driven, feral, and scribbling all over the page, Bark's sixteen tracks house a mess of weird, undulating musical bits that are hugely intriguing despite not always making a whole shitload of sense. ""South Is Only a Home"" opens the record in a sloppy downhill tumble. It's a solid, foot-stomping burst, with honkytonk piano plonking out a declining scale and a wrestled guitar making a mess that's as thrilling as it is damaging. Both ""Leaky Tunnel"" and ""Inca Rag/Name Game"" channel Lennon/McCartney melody-gone-weird (""Inca Rag"" has a piano opening that's awfully close to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"") while ""I'm Gonna Run"" sees Eleanor's Jack White/Chrissie Hynde growl/coo suggestively noting, ""Saw my brother coming up the hill/ I tied a beach towel around my wrist."" It's all muted violence and esoteric observations skidding across wily guitar foundations, bouncy piano hits, and puttering percussion. Despite just now cutting their proper debut, the Furnaces have already burned through a pile of drummers (Ryan Sawyer bravely grips the sticks here), and the duo's brother/sister throwdown seems volatile enough to ignite just about anything seated directly in its blazing path. They spew the best kinds of sparks, though: accessible, but skewed and peculiar enough to keep you peeking nervously over your shoulder every couple of minutes.

Spring,Cyann & Ben,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d99d034d5c69bf3643/1:1/w_160/0991fba9.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1721-spring/,Gooom,"Cyann & Ben, a four-piece based out of Charleville-Mézières in the French Ardennes and co-fronted by their namesake duo, might be likened to an unplugged version of their Gooom Records labelmates M83: both groups share an affinity for arpeggios, sweeping orchestration, and deep, resonant atmospherics, but where M83 drench their synth-centric shoegaze in bright electronic tones, Cyann & Ben prefer a live approach, resting their hushed vocals against darker, more organic instrumentation. The compositions on Spring, Cyann & Ben's debut full-length, are tastefully restrained, yet often achieve epic heights through their cinematic, open-air production and full arrangements that sometimes recall the spacier efforts of Sigur Rós or the haunted, autumnal folk that lay beneath the layered feedback din on mid-period Flying Saucer Attack albums like Further and Chorus. Opener ""Buick to the Moon"" pulses deliberately amidst garbled, crackling audio samples from David Lynch's Wild at Heart, fluctuating madly between speakers. Two clean-toned electric guitars, floating on pillowy reverb, give shade to a ghostly melody. Atop this mesmeric mist hovers a soft male tenor with a female partner wading in and out of accompaniment. After a foreboding first few minutes, the song reaches its first climax on a surprisingly comforting melody spun out by a xylophone, guitar, and vocal trio. It's breathtaking, but just over the horizon, a darkness advances once again: Soon, drums enter the fray and renew the eerie conviction of the other instruments, which, now rhythmically unshackled, are free to challenge the tonal limitations of the song's first half. It's an incredibly promising track with which to open a debut record, and incredibly, Spring only gets better. ""I Can't Pretend Anymore"", perhaps the track that most inspired my earlier M83 comparison, launches into an intense 5/4 waltz after a beautiful female vocal solo noodles throughout an arpeggiated synthstring progression. A guitar carries on the arpeggio, offering still more internal energy to an already overwhelming backbeat that threatens to topple over itself at any moment. ""Siren Song"" drapes dangerously enchanting vocals over a whirlpool of cymbals, spelled-out guitar chords, and gorgeous synth tones, a guitar occasionally breaking free from the song's mysterious emotional vice grip. Accordions haunt ""A Dance with the Devil"" as a female vocal desperately struggles to keep her focus, distracted by her whispering lothario. Spring is an immediately accessible sonic feat, which is particularly striking given its extreme self-restraint. But its sweetest fruits are reaped only after repeated consideration, upon which one realizes the depth of complexity behind such initial immediacy. It's a rare strain of ""epic"" music, where bravado does not exceed the composition, but remains at all times within it. Cyann & Ben are masters of this subtlety, and, along with similar efforts this year from England's George and the upcoming Books' release, put forth once again the notion that the most convincing art is of a noble simplicity and a quiet grandeur.","Cyann & Ben, a four-piece based out of Charleville-M\xE9zi\xE8res in the French Ardennes and co-fronted by their\n\ namesake ...

Straight Outta Compton / Efil4zaggin,N.W.A.,by: Ray Suzuki,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95913d197565213ae27/1:1/w_160/0523818d.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11791-straight-outta-compton-efil4zaggin/,PriorityPriority,"Last week I was buying some detergent at a local laundromat in rural Nebraska. This is what was occupying my mind: ""See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem/ I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him."" Now, based on my limited experience with law enforcement, I've found most cops to be cordial, beneficent protectors of the law. Yet, at that moment, I didn't just want to fuck tha police, both physically and figuratively; I wanted them lynched, drenched in gasoline, and burnt alive. It's one thing to get a catchy couplet stuck in teenagers' heads; it's another to convert half the nation into murderous psychopaths hell-bent on riot and rape. N.W.A. accomplished the latter. Straight Outta Compton was not the first gangsta-rap album, nor was it the first album to use such disconcerting and scabrous blasts of sound, but the music was revolutionary for two reasons. First, Dre and Yella took the vitriolic, cacophonous rampage of Public Enemy and discarded all the motivation and history behind the anger; second, they sampled laid-back jazz, psychoastral-lovetron p-funk, sweetly romantic soul, naïve doo-wop, Martha Reeves, Charles Wright and Marvin Gaye, and proceeded to lay it under the most gruesome narratives imaginable, dead ho's and cop killers. This is tantamount to using a ""Happy B-Day, Grandma"" Hallmark card to inform a family you just slaughtered their grandmother. It's cruel, duplicitous, perverse, horrifying, hilarious. In some ways, Straight Outta Compton is the archetypal rap album, the one you would send into space if you wanted to ignite a stellar holocaust. It unites the paranoia of It Takes a Nation of Millions with the chill of The Chronic, while still retaining an old-school, Run-DMC-style playfulness. The opening squall of ""Straight Outta Compton"", ""Fuck tha Police"", and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" is still as confrontational and decimating as it was at the dawn of the 1990s. The bass throttles, the funk combusts, and the sirens deafen as Eazy-E dispenses with tired romantic clichés: ""So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!/ You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't no sucker!"" And this is the least misogynistic of N.W.A.'s albums. In the remaining ten tracks, the group depicts a paranoid, conspiratorial wasteland where cops ""think every nigga is sellin' narcotics,"" where they often are selling narcotics to buy gats to kill cops, where bitches have two functions in life-- to suck dick and get shot when they stop-- and where there are two only professions: bein' a punk and shootin' punks. The mind itself is a ghetto, and the ghetto is universal. A lot of people, for whatever reason, take offense to such ideas. William S. Burroughs writes the same thing and gets hailed as the greatest writer of the twentieth century. There is no hope, no messages, no politics, rarely an explicit suggestion of irony. The only respite is ""Express Yourself"", the sweetest anti-drug song to ever take place in a correctional facility. Musically, the rhythm pummels and the scratches are strong but sparse; lyrically, Dre says it best: ""It gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate."" For all the genius, there are some tracks that simply can't compare to the classics. ""If It Ain't Ruff"", ""8 Ball"", and ""Dopeman"" are triumphant rap songs, but they consist of minimalist beats and the silly battle raps that N.W.A. helped eliminate. Efil4Zaggin, meanwhile, is about as close as you can come to a death metal/hip-hop hybrid. People will get hurt here. The group, sans-Cube, is simply trying to further their status as icons of shock-rap. Unlike someone like Alice Cooper or Marilyn Manson, though, N.W.A. sound like they've actually gone insane: The song titles alone (""To Kill a Hooker"", ""One Less Bitch"", ""Find 'Em, Fuck 'Em and Flee"") are enough to send some people into seizures. I have no idea what Eazy-E was doing between albums, but it clearly involved a lot of sadomasochism and PCP-- his lyrics are revoltingly unlistenable: ""Yo, I tied her to the bed/ I had to let my niggaz fuck her first/ Loaded up the 44, yo/ Then I straight smoked the ho/ 'Cause I'm a real nigga."" The main musical motif is the Psycho theme. The songs here sound like the Bomb Squad in the graveyard Superfly got buried in. ""Approach to Danger"" is essentially rapping over a Halloween FX record. It's complexly debauched, fantastically jagged terror-hop that at its best challenges anything on Fear of a Black Planet and at its worst challenges anything off Dre's 2001. It's also much funnier than Straight Outta Compton. Eazy-E's Ten Commandments on ""Appetite for Destruction"" set the bar so high on his first command that he can barely think of enough vices to finish it. In the skit ""Protest"", an N.W.A. concert turns into a scene from Platoon. Eazy also sings on two tracks, one of which (""Automobile"") may as well be titled ""With a Little Help from Your Pussy"". Ten seconds can barely pass before someone is murdered or raped. It's the sound of an expletive anger at its breaking point. The reissues sound pretty tight, but high-quality audio was never really the point. The supplementary tracks are a more interesting point of discussion. Straight Outta Compton adds extended mixes of ""Express Yourself"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"". The former may be a better song, but only because it uses more of the Wright sample, whereas the latter regrettably decides to disturb the propulsion of the original by inserting spoken dialogue. The B-side, ""A Bitch Iz a Bitch"", however, is one of Cube's finest moments, beginning as a specification of what he means when he curses, and ending with a tirade against a ""contact-wearin' bitch."" Efil4Zaggin just adds the 100 Miles and Runnin' EP, which is fairly superfluous. The title track, though, is easily one of the best rap songs of all time-- N.W.A. if commissioned to write a James Bond theme. Listening to these discs again just remind me how ludicrous the whole Eminem controversy was. More than a decade ago, N.W.A. was instructing suburbia to smash bitches' brains in with a cock in one hand and a glock in the other. In comparison, Eminem's harshest lyric ends up sounding like, ""I may slightly disagree with certain tenets of popular ideologies."" When Eminem rapes and kills his mom, it's because of a long-standing psychological disorder that relies on a complicated relationship with his family. When Eazy-E does it, it's because nothing good was on TV that night. These are the most nihilistic, apolitical recordings since the Nixon tapes.",,9.7,
The Decline of British Sea Power,British Sea Power,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a432b1335d7bf16988d5/1:1/w_160/e192055c.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1079-the-decline-of-british-sea-power/,Rough Trade,"Rock and roll has always offered its harbingers an array of delivery methods. Brighton's British Sea Power consistently opt for prickly juxtapositions: they like their club stages littered with stuffed birds and bits of foliage, and their rock songs peppered with obtuse allusions and highbrow polemics. And the tension doesn't end there: BSP might sport World War I military uniforms for their notoriously weird live sets, but The Decline of British Sea Power, the band's proper full-length debut, is deliberately contemporary, a confident synthesis of punk, post-punk, and new-wave, the perfect fusion of contrived aesthetics (if you're not convinced, check the band members' curt, one-word names-- Yan, Hamilton, Noble, Wood-- or the fact that they periodically pipe in pre-recorded woodland sounds during their shows) and gut-borne energy. Much like countrymen Clinic, the onstage gimmicks aren't intended to transcend the songs; rather, they comprise an equally compelling sideshow that seems, somehow, entirely appropriate to the music. The Decline boasts lyrical references that range from semi-accessible (""Something Wicked"" pulls expectedly from Macbeth) to the near-arcane (obscured nods to Russian literature, the British Empire, and imperialist ethics). Majestic and blustery, Decline's vaguely psychedelic goth-pop can, occasionally, also sway a bit little glam: Yan's cheeky self-comparisons to Liberace (""Just like Liberace/ I will return to haunt you with peculiar piano riffs"") and Casio name-dropping (""I'll drink all day and play all night/ On my Casio electric piano"") are purposefully campy, and his whisper-gone-yowl can be fiercely sexual, even predatory. BSP repeatedly get swatted with overwrought comparisons to both Joy Division and the Pixies, but The Decline has a lot more ""Stardust""-era Bowie buried in it than anyone seems ready to admit. The sinister and lusty ""Apologies to Insect Life"" sees Yan layering his brash, punkish wheezes (check the hiccuped, barely pronounced shouts of ""Yeah!"") over Noble's harried guitar riffing, hollering an introductory, ""Oh Fyodor, you are the most attractive man/ Oh Fyodor, you are the most attractive man I know."" Presumably, it's all one big, freaky homage to Dostoyevsky (and no less ambiguous than one of the man's novels); what makes ""Apologies"" so intensely interesting is that it pits its super-cerebral strutting against straightforward, power-to-the-people punk beats. Album opener ""Men Together Today"" is a sustained choral swell that lasts about a minute and a half-- hauntingly resonant, ""Men"" is also almost painfully misplaced, essentially irrelevant to what follows, a freestanding climax denied a proper build. Alternately, the sprawling epic ""Lately"" (which rolls on for nearly 14 minutes) packs in a few too many rises and collapses, shimmering on and on, a series of spectacular movements that never properly assemble into a cohesive (or coherent) whole. The album's true apex is ""Fear of Drowning"", which begins, appropriately, with the muted whoosh of water crashing into shore. Don't get too serene, though: what comes next is Yan cooing ""Jesus fucking Christ/ Oh, God, no"" over a whole mess of thick, wailing guitar. Wood's drums are the only thing staying consistent; vocals and guitars roll in and out, turbulent and jarring, a thrilling spin. Some people are already gearing up to dismiss British Sea Power as uselessly derivative, prematurely rejecting the band as (yet another) batch of self-obsessed, post-post-punk wannabes wearing stupid outfits, a troop of hyper Echo & The Bunnymen fans who spend far too much time prancing about, and not nearly enough time defining a sound of their own. But BSP's performance art antics and throwback posturing come with a distinct set of innovations and surprises, and The Decline of British Sea Power proves that BSP have the song-power to back up their bullshit. More than just a cheeky album title or bizarre live spectacle, British Sea Power can also stir up a perfectly chilling wave.","Rock and roll has always offered its harbingers an array of delivery methods.

War Prayers,Young People,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae39d034d5c69bf3f1b/1:1/w_160/7c57d786.jpg,2003-10-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8846-war-prayers/,Dim Mak,"Drippy, rhapsodic and flaky, the second outing from former 5 Rue Christine art-rockers Young People sways seismically through spacious art-pop, patiently allowing bursts of pine-tar noise to emerge unannounced. Perhaps as the cookie-cutter hodgepodge of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs rightfully falls off the radar, more weary travelers will start tripping and shouting to the beautiful post-folk urban sprawl of War Prayers. Potentially excellent tour buddies for the equally ramshackle Baptist Generals, this coed trio (including ex-Pink & Brown skins-crasher Jeff Rosenberg) has an admirable unwillingness to tidy their songscapes. The ad hoc pace allows their chilled, alt-country Bow Wow Wow to time-lapse bloom into a John Cale in-house experiment redirected by anonymous cowboy junkies obsessing over The Raincoats. Loose-hewn fragments like pitted stars, ""Rhumba"" and ""The Valley"" masticate into homegrown improvisations during doped-up power outages; the stuttering movement between the roundtable Susanne Vega folkie singalong ""Tammy Faye"" and the reverb in spring of ""Ne're Do Well"" are a cloudburst of black-magic pick scratching, Sabbath guitar accents, and vocalist Katie Eastburn's powerful lullaby of a sing/shout, shout/sing. Stylistically, Eastburn acts-out as a less-fancy Björk on the wonderful ""Stagecoach"" where she manages to tread the line between on and off key while the factory-worker sounds her bandmates concoct rumble and hiss along the production line. She's also Chan Marshall's Wiccan sister moping through a slipshod buzz on ""El Paso"". Elsewhere, imagine an anonymous small-town jazz favorite awkwardly humming a meandering spiritual in a dive bar with ex-members of Pere Ubu and a drunken, bemused Richard Hell providing a strategic, sick-kid choir of burnouts and ill-sent bastards. ""The Lord"" is a military/religious benchmark, exactly 60 seconds of bombastic celebratory pop riddled within horns, humming bees, and enough joyous cymbal splashes to loosen up even the most jaded of hipsters. It's one of many parade stoppers, a climactic grand finale in Cat Power: The Musical-- performed by nascent SpinArt stars Suddenly Tammy!-- when the young Amish woman playing a Dickensionian Chan Marshall unearths ultimate happiness in the self-mythologizing of her sadness during a crazed rollercoaster ride at nearby Hershey Park. She decides, in sotto vocco, at that very moment, to first buy some cotton candy and then take part in a vaguely understood, largely abstract music project she saw mentioned twenty years ago in a romantic pamphlet written by David Wojnarowicz. As a whole, the eleven sprawling ragas on the War Prayers evoke high-school poetry, cool-ass soothsaying, dirty squats, Velvet Underground shadow puppets, and the hunger of John Fante. What's more important is that these really are prayers. The band's grubby tribal spirit may or may not supplant the sparkly succubus eyeliner dross regurgitated as porn-star-pabulum by the menagerie of Luxx regulars spoiling my local nightlife, but regardless the final results, Young People's contagious slow-core vibrancy and unwillingness to settle for an obvious post-punk narrative explodes their humble DIY into a wonderfully zealous act.","Drippy, rhapsodic and flaky, the second outing from former 5 Rue Christine art-rockers Young People sways\n\ seismically through spacious ...

"Brothers, Sisters",North of America,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42dea9e61561daa80b9/1:1/w_160/4d05bf27.jpg,2003-10-01 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5840-brothers-sisters/,Level Plane,"A person who shall remain nameless informed me that this album was pretty danceable before I heard it. Which struck me as pretty odd, as it should anyone who's heard North of America before. And of course, it's not really danceable, but I'll give this person the benefit of the doubt and assume they were just using ""danceable"" in place of the more accurate ""rhythmic."" You can kind of bob your head along awkwardly (mind those odd meters, though), but you'd likely wind up with contusions if you actually tried to move your body to the stuff. Perhaps it's just the musical phase we're all going through that has folks crying ""dancepunk!"" every time a shouty band with a competent bassist comes along-- even when that band predates this new footloose phase rock is going through right now-- but on their third full-length, North of America, as ever, remain pretty firmly entrenched in Dischord-inspired post-hardcore. The Nova Scotian quartet has always just barely managed to avoid that tag by reining in the vocals, but anyone who ever worshipped at the altar of the D.C. scene will wax nostalgic when they hear the interweaving guitars, stop/stop dynamics, sorta-melodic shouted choruses, and brow-beating rhythms that make up Brothers, Sisters. The band has cleaned up some of the excess tempo changes that impeded last year's The Sepultura EP, but they still Drive Like Jehu from start to finish, and the relative sameness of their approach means that, despite their continued evolution, the new album still sounds mostly like a collection of variations on a single song, with little exception. One of those little exceptions is unfortunately a formless noise swamp called ""You Want to Join My Cult"", but the other makes up for it. ""All Actors Are Liars"" is stunningly poppy and melodic for these guys, replete with female backing vocals to smooth the band's own rough edges. The song's spastic/melodic bipolar disorder makes it the first thing you'll remember when the laser sits idle in the stereo. They almost repeat this success on ""Oh My God, Oh My God, Everybody, Oh My God"" (my vote for best song title), a song that begins slowly, with the band slipping into a vocal call-and-response round of ""thank you""s and ""you're welcome""s that builds beautifully, but the payoff is a little disjointed, leaving you wanting more. The band keeps the mix drier than the Atacama throughout, and leans toward the high-end to a degree that could make Albini himself blush. What I'm saying is, your subwoofer won't get much work here. Yet, as dirty as things sound sometimes, the band never fully distorts their guitars, aiming more for skin-prickling semi-clean tones that sound good playing dissonant patterns. ""Voting 'No' on the Warming of Antarctica"" barrels along with so much activity that the cymbals overtake everything at points, drowning the grinding guitars and metallic bassline in a flooding wash. The vocals (handled by several band members; each goes only by his last name and none are credited with specific duties) fall about halfway between the bark of Ian MacKaye and the slack of Stephen Malkmus-- forceful enough to get away with overtly avoiding melody, but not so frenzied that it sounds like your dad. Would that North of America could squeeze a few more colors from their sound, I could give them a better, broader recommendation; as it is, folks who haven't quite had their fill of complexly layered riffage and heavy rhythm just yet will have a field day with Brothers, Sisters.","A person who shall remain nameless informed me that this album was pretty danceable before I heard it.

Eyes Closed EP,Alias,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1765e6ef959693201b7/1:1/w_160/0aaca932.jpg,2003-10-01 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/408-eyes-closed-ep/,Anticon,"Last year, when Alias personally released a highly limited edition, self-manufactured black-CDR instrumental version of his true debut, The Other Side of the Looking Glass, it became exceedingly clear where his interests were heading-- and where his potential was greatest. Though by no means an anemic MC, those instrumental tracks revealed Alias' inspired production and germinal compositional skill to be his leading endowment and most intriguing contemplative outlet. Eyes Closed is his first, full-fledged instrumental-only release, and though a testament to why every member of his Anticon crew (in addition to other visionaries such as Atmosphere mastermind Slug, Sage Francis, and Markus Acher of, yep, The Notwist) has collaborated with him, it also fails to meet its own standards of compulsion for the entirety of its brief twenty minute junket, and rarely breaks form. The album's recipe is familiar: drones, synths, skittish and contrasting percussion rhythms (typically intensified throughout the track or cascaded down after a calculated lull), and some TV or radio vocal overdubs all cooked into a spacious, moody concoction. The first three songs file in dutifully after one another, each producing the same temperate effect and utilizing media snippets of vanilla anti-consumer flavoring. Unfortunately, there's no real bite to the message, musically or philosophically. ""Must Consume"", in fact, sounds deceptively akin to the Dust Brothers' work on the Fight Club soundtrack, both in tone and anti-capitalist propagation, detracting from the piece's relevancy. ""Eyes Closed"" is a little more sparsely produced, but the immediate ferrying in of the anti-Bush rider suffocates the track. The finest work is done on ""Dec. 26th, 2002"", and while never fully stepping out of the (DJ) Shadow to shine on its own right, it does employ excellent mood manipulation and a fine release of tension, and winds up the only track that says something-- without, uh, saying anything. It's nervous and suspecting, reserved and taut, and manages to escape the fetters of parody. Like each track, the production itself is sterling, retaining a gritty laptop personal touch without forfeiting sonic acuity. None of the songs excavate new ground, and with each track clocking at under five minutes no single moment is able to breathe free long enough to truly sink in. Perhaps with vocal textures these cuts would suffice, but on their own they're too naked to stand straight. Previous Anticon releases such as Why's Oaklandazulasylum, or even Alias' early work in Deep Puddle Dynamics succeeded primarily on two counts: vision and balls. Eyes Closed has one, but distinctly lacks the other.","Last year, when Alias personally released a highly limited edition, self-manufactured black-CDR instrumental version of his true debut, The Other ...

Immediate False Relief,Pierre Crube,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d8ea9e61561daa5463/1:1/w_160/966da2cb.gif,2003-10-01 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1720-immediate-false-relief/,Angelika Koehlermann,"On Immediate False Relief, Simon-Pierre Weiskopf pitter-patters a broken-hearted court jester through a idiosyncratic and often daringly cheesy collection of minimal Casio pickup lines akin to a laser light show scored by The Cure and Orange Cake Mix. One half of Montreal-based provocateurs Ro, Weiskopf forgoes the hamfisted Situationist jokes; instead, he tenderly enacts twenty-six bathetic scene changes in a wiry forty-nine minute pantomime. Bravely drawing the curtains to the precious ""Chariots of Fire"" swells of ""Typecast as You Wish"", the saccharine tearjerker dares the listener to place these cloying theatrics within an ethereal soap opera landscape inhabited by sock monkeys blindly pirouetting with die-cast shadow puppets. The brief ""I Like It"" follows up the introduction with a hard drum machine, twisted cable connections, manufactured cricket chirps, and a distended conveyor belt issuing varying shots of fiddling feedback that bleed into the next bit, ""Rimming"", which seemingly extols the rectal-tonguing capabilities of a lover. Here, Weiskopf whispers and pines growlingly beneath constant machine gun fire, piano arpeggios, and-- believe you me-- a Six Cents & Natalie bass part. Our master of ceremony's sense of dynamics continues throughout the entire collection, highlighted on the movement between the Lesser spaz attack of ""Isolation at Transport"" and the too-poignant-for-words ""Getting All Emo"". Following his patterns closely is an exercise in manic depression and any number of sight gags-- songs pause and skip, back beats turn into oddball, upfront solos that create sonic puns. Adept at pastiche, Weiskopf cogently directs a cast of abstract computer sounds, punk-rock answering machines, computerized vegetable chopping, The Goldberg Variations played by elves, low-tech dance tracks, splatter paint, and stately marches for malfunctioning robots at a luau. Now wrap it all in red velvet and pink champagne and ask it for a kiss. Appended to Immediate False Relief's twenty-one gun salute are five vocal tracks from the Ohym EP, which shift the tempo via a broke-ass Trent Reznor mooning through the Pet Shop Boys. Besides ""Skin Off"", a horny malfunctioning NIN bit about tight asses (the backing grind and sitar-styled breakdown are nice touches) and the really sweet closer, ""He Sells Music"", a music box rejoinder to The Magnetic Fields' ""Take Ecstasy with Me"", these bits lack the unspoken verve of the mostly instrumental works preceding them. Weiskopf really hits his stride when he keeps quiet: playing the nail-biting Pierre Crube, a ghostly blue-boy swathed in a yellow glow, he's able to swivel mutely outside standard song structures, levitating in a precious space between Hooked on Bach, The Charm of the Highway Strip, and a taciturn Rod McKuen's airbrushed seductions.","On Immediate False Relief, Simon-Pierre Weiskopf pitter-patters a broken-hearted court jester through a idiosyncratic and often daringly cheesy collection of ...

Lost in Translation,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a640ea9e61561daa5314/1:1/w_160/26bd2485.jpg,2003-10-01 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7714-lost-in-translation/,Emperor Norton,"Kevin Shields did a live online interview on AOL in February 1997. The obvious question was asked first: When can we hear some new material? Shields responded, ""Definitely sometime this year or I'm dead,"" and then later, ""I really am dead if I don't get my record out this year."" Six and a half years after that interview there's still no follow-up to the landmark Loveless, but Shields is very much alive, working with Primal Scream and doing the occasional remix. He recently admitted that the pressure of following what many consider to be a perfect record is what did him in. He couldn't bear to put the My Bloody Valentine name on something inferior to Loveless, and so he kept his tapes in the vault. There was no next chapter and probably never will be; life continues. Perhaps the enormous weight Kevin Shields has been living under has been lifted. My Bloody Valentine exists only as history and now, on the soundtrack to Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation, Shields gives his own name a try. Lost in Translation contains four new Shields tracks, his first original work in more than a decade, and though there are eleven other songs here, the Shields material is the drawing card. He first appears on the second track, ""City Girl"", his lone new vocal song. On first listen it sounds like a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era. It's mid-tempo, with an unusual repeating melody and a two-note chorus. The guitar is simple and rough, a bit garage-rock, bouncing over characteristically buried drums that seem an afterthought. This is Kevin Shields the pop songwriter, the guy with a collection of rare Beatles bootlegs who puts on ""Strawberry Fields"" when he's feeling down. The sound of the thing could be anybody-- no exploration on that front-- but the melody and voice are familiar and welcome. The next two Shields tracks are pretty instrumentals that feel more like film cues (which they are) than proper songs. ""Goodbye"" has a wispy synth texture and a vaguely Celtic bent, and sounds somewhat Eno-esque but more emotionally manipulative, like it must play in a scene geared to leave a lump in your throat. The faint glide guitar textures gently snaking through the drone offer evidence of its maker, but the signature is subtle. Then there's the 98-second ""Ikebana"", which consists of lightly plucked electric guitar over gentle synth washes. It's not boring, exactly, just nondescript. If you Invisible Jukeboxed me, I might guess I might guess Mark Knopfler's soundtrack to The Princess Bride. Finally, there's the odd ""Are You Awake?"" The most sonically interesting of Shields' tracks, ""Are You Awake?"" combines the steady pulse of a cheap Casio drum machine with some echoing, dubby guitar effects. It reminds a little of pre-Autobahn Kraftwerk and the surprising motorik rhythm combines wonderfully with his gauzy guitar texture, but it's painfully short at a minute and a half. I get the sense that Shields is on the verge of tapping into something deeper here, some combination of his guitar depth and cheap instrumental overlays, but ""Are You Awake?"" doesn't give much to go on. As to the rest of the soundtrack, Shields' presence extends beyond his new songs. Maybe I'm just filling in blanks, but aspects of the sound he perfected can be felt throughout. There's a My Bloody Valentine track (""Sometimes""), a My Bloody Valentine forbear (Jesus and Mary Chain's ""Just Like Honey"" closes), and an unexpectedly great My Bloody Valentine impression (Death in Vegas' ethereal ""Girls""). Squarepusher's short ambient ditty ""Tommib"" even seems vaguely connected somehow. Other highlights include Air's mostly acoustic (guitar and piano) ""Alone in Kyoto"", which echoes the competent mood music of their recent collaboration with Italian author Alessandro Baricco (sans the narration), and Kaze Wo Atsumete's ""Happy End"", which sounds like a fine Aluminum Group AM radio tribute sung in Japanese. There are odd selections (Phoenix's ""Too Young"" sounds like an 80s power-pop track that might have soundtracked a Michael J. Fox flick), but for the most part, the tracks hang together and flow relatively well, orbiting the shimmering dreampop mass that serves as the record's unstated inspiration. The man at the center of that universe sounds unsteady, but a tentative first step back into the songwriting world is better than nothing. Here's hoping he makes it a bit further next time.","Kevin Shields did a live online interview on AOL in February 1997. The obvious question was asked first: When can ...

Dream Dentistry,LoDeck,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbe13d197565213b5e8/1:1/w_160/9f823449.jpg,2003-09-30 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4952-dream-dentistry/,Johnny23,"One of the defining features of underground hip-hop is how the two most contentious factors to success are so opposite. The artists with the largest fanbases are either deeply rooted in tradition or defined by their eccentricity. The ones with the most important impact, however, have a certain way of combining both portions into a single, equal serving. Falling upon this ambiguous sub-region is Johnny23 Records CEO and artist LoDeck, with his debut LP, Dream Dentistry. A concise arrangement of philosophical pondering and bass-heavy beats, the album is driven by Deck's rhyming style. He writes like Aesop Rock mixed with Redman, but his hung-over, rusty, cracking New Yorker vocals and devil-may-care charisma call for comparison to rappers like Sticky Fingaz and MF Doom. In short: LoDeck raps like the Ivy League freshman that went to Daytona Beach for Spring Break and never came back to school. A natural New York-dirty punchline master, LoDeck attempts to power you into his fanclub with subtle jabs and crosses. Not only is he ""too ill/ Like Eazy-E at 'Tha Crossroads',"" but if he's ""too predictable,"" he'll ""twist up like Blanka."" Even when he spits out ""The Russian ain't playin'/ My real name is Boris,"" his delivery redeems the randomness of the line. His concepts include the negatives of the idiot box on ""Inside the TV"", the misunderstandings surrounding the societal standing of underground emcees on ""Applause"" (""You want a satellite dish? All us rappers are rich!""), and the nature of affection on the aptly titled ""Love"". LoDeck's major issue is that his meandering stream-of-consciousness flow often sacrifices coherency, topical restraint and consistency for a tighter flow, which, by the end of most of his tracks, tends lose any of the concepts he began with. It does make for an enjoyably raw listening experience but a level of sustained conceptual depth could help him to cross the bridge into Classic County. ""Word is Virus"" is a highlight, regardless of the lame freezing glitch-hop beat and corny vocal sample, featuring Paramount and sub-underground superhero Mac Lethal. After LoDeck proclaims his ""loopy crew acts like soccer thugs with one goal"" and that he's ""blessed with the same charm that freezes cobras,"" Paramount sleepwalks through a flow-oriented verse, leaving room for Lethal to steal the show. Opening by pantomiming Beanie Sigel, Mac twists and contorts his delivery around his Midwest battle style, offering a loose, bouncy alternative to the stark ambiguity of Deck and Paramount: ""Your crew's about as thuggy as the Shriners/ Rocking turbans made out of trash can liners."" Flanked by producers FredONE, Chum Chopz, Big DeEP and perennial Aesop Rock beatmaker Blockhead, the beats on Dream Dentistry definitely disappoint when paired with LoDeck's vocal assault. The Blockhead compositions rise above the others with the aura of professionalism that made LoDeck's Bash It! EP such a stark triumph-- unfortunately, nothing on this record touches ""Stethoscope Alley"" or ""I Pollute"" in the realm of production. Chum Chopz, in particular, is hit/miss. ""Watchtower"" runs romper stomper with hard drums and a spiral staircase bassline that works well, but ""Love"" is rendered almost unlistenable by tinny guitar licks and a sloppy choral vocal sample. Of course, even if his lack of song structure and freeform rhyming throws some people off, LoDeck has clearly evolved his lyrical status since the ridiculously dope Bash It! EP; it's just that, here, he's lost the beats, and still yet to gain songwriting focus. His next project could hold a deeper listening experience; in the meantime, Dream Dentistry remains a powerful testament to his novel rap style.","One of the defining features of underground hip-hop is how the two most contentious factors to success are so opposite ...

Love and Affliction,Consonant,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64f13d197565213915f/1:1/w_160/a6614648.jpg,2003-09-30 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1588-love-and-affliction/,Fenway,"Even as he returned to the stage for high-profile reunion gigs with Mission of Burma, the most pleasant surprise from Clint Conley has been the debut of his own band Consonant, which slipped into Boston last summer and has played a comparative handful of gigs-- almost as few as the Burma reunion, but in more intimate clubs. A favorite on many end of the year lists (including mine), Consonant's self-titled first record was nevertheless so unassuming, such a straight-up indie rock guitar record, that you could spin it again and again and completely overlook how special it was. Not much has changed on the band's second release: in fact, as satisfying as it is, it's hard not to judge it side-by-side with their debut. Conley has kept the band together-- Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine) on the other guitar, Winston Braman (Fuzzy) on bass, and Matt Kadane (Bedhead, The New Year) on drums fill out what amounts to an indie rock all-star quartet, with none of the showcasing that could imply. The most obvious difference is that Love and Affliction starts with a mood instead of a hook. The first disc demanded your attention with those perfect first few notes of ""Blissful"", and Consonant only took a more sprawling route on a couple of songs, like ""What a Body Could Do"". This album cuts right to the building and cresting volume of ""Little Murders"", as Conley's and Brokaw's guitars roar like guys tuning their Mustangs in adjacent driveways. And then there's Conley's voice, lacking the machismo of his earlier band, sounding even more fragile here than on Consonant's debut. Conley can sound open and damaged, not unlike Robert Wyatt, but on ""Cry"" I could picture him emulating the fierce resistance of Kristin Hersh; the lyrics, mostly written by Holly Anderson, bring in an even more feminine tone. The cussedness of their earlier lyrics has gotten stern and lonely, the ""hey, I'm in a band again!"" ebullience turning into something darker. The raw underproduction helps each track blend into the next, riding a constant flow of distorted guitars. But it also obscures the details. Harmonies are buried in a chorus, guitars fade away in the middle of a ballad: any time the band gets too quiet, they risk disappearing completely. That recording style makes them sound even more like a ""guitar band,"" and it's perfect for anyone who sentimentally prefers a band that sounds like they're playing in your basement-- while you're upstairs. The only real criticism is that the moodiness takes a toll on the songwriting: while there ain't a weak track, you won't find the obvious pinnacles or ecstatic Kinks-like guitar pop. The album's catchiest track, ""Mysteries of the Holiday Camp"", propels Conley's funny tour-in-England anecdotes, but the graceful hook on ""She's Driving Fast"" just cribs from ""(There Is a Rose In) Spanish Harlem"". For the rest of the album, the strongest tracks are the ones that bear monster power riffs-- like ""Blue Story"", with its incongruous, ""We are the priests of the temple of Syrinx""-like imagery, or ""Dumb Joy"", which ebbs and flows, angry and wistful, as Conley bares himself through break-ups. Where Consonant's first record was so unexpectedly rewarding, this one's ""just"" a strong follow-up. But there's also no doubt the band has grown, and that Conley has made a fair exchange of accessibility for honest, emotional power. After you've heard the debut, Love and Affliction comes strongly recommended: it would, after all, be a mistake to take these guys for granted.","Even as he returned to the stage for high-profile reunion gigs with Mission of Burma, the most pleasant surprise from ...

On the Beach / American Stars 'n' Bars / Hawks & Doves / Re-ac-tor,Neil Young,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae7ea9e61561daa5c6f/1:1/w_160/5df8ddec.jpg,2003-09-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11868-on-the-beach-american-stars-n-bars-hawks-doves-re-ac-tor/,RepriseReprise,"There are few musical artists who need the old canonization speech less than Neil Young. With his reputation preserved amongst us youngsters as the Godfather of Grunge (apparently based on little more than a predilection towards flannel), he's already known by all as the hip great-uncle amidst the Woodstock era's senile grandparents. Still, attention must be paid to the most impressive feat of Young's career: an all-but-perfect streak of very good-to-excellent albums that spanned an incredible, and unparalleled, eleven years. To put it another way, from 1969-1979, Neil Young was rock's Joe Dimaggio. Which makes it especially cruel that, for years afterward, Neil's eccentric skepticism about the auditory worth of the compact disc format kept many of those albums out-of-print. So it's somewhat ironic that now, in the dying days of the digital disc, Reprise Records has finally convinced their stubborn client to allow for patching up most of these holes, rescuing four albums from obscurity and bootleggers. Fancy remastering, fancy packaging: who cares? I can finally retire four crackly vinyls to wall-decoration duty. The most criminal omission by a long shot was On the Beach, the 1974 disc that represented Young's last ramp-up before his masterpiece, Tonight's the Night. Recorded with help from The Band's crack rhythm section and colorful multi-instrumentalist hick Rusty Kershaw, On the Beach is one of the few from Young's catalog that doesn't land easily on either his country or hard-rock piles. Three song titles with the word ""blues"" give you an idea of the mood, but hardly prepare you for the bleak anger of ""Revolution Blues"" or ""For the Turnstiles"", post-apocalyptic visions as eerie as any of 28 Days Later's scenic pans. The real engine of the album's brilliance, though, is the trio of slow, long, lonely hotel room folk songs that closes out the album, peaking with Neil's ""Desolation Row"", ""Ambulance Blues."" To hear them is to know that Jason Molina goes to bed each night caressing a copy of this record. The stark tone of On the Beach was only carried over to one track from 1977's American Stars 'n' Bars, the creepily lo-fi ""Will to Love"". What fills the remainder of the album is a sort of buffet-style Neil Young, offering up choice leftovers from various failed projects of the era. The peak, of course, is ""Like a Hurricane"", perhaps one of the finest examples of Neil's willfully untechnical guit-hartic playing style, a chord progression that induces string-popping frenzy in his live shows to this day. But also making appearances are Skynyrd Neil, slashing country-rock lines through ""Bite the Bullet"" and Farm Aid favorite ""Homegrown"", and Sensitive Poet Neil, revisiting Harvest seasoning with ""Hey Babe"" and ""Star of Bethlehem"". Unfortunately, reclaiming that Harvest mood is what chokes the majority of Hawks & Doves, notable for being the dashed-off post-Rust Never Sleeps album that breaks his streak of excellence, and not much more. Other than faux-traditionals ""The Old Homestead"" and ""Captain Kennedy"", this 1980 release captures an uncharacteristically tentative Neil, clearly unsure of whether to develop quirky singalongs like ""Lost in Space"" or plastic soul like ""Staying Power"" (an early harbinger of his recent unbecoming Motown romanticism). Young can't even seem to stay on task thematically here, sequencing the patronizing ""Union Man"" before ""Comin' Apart at Every Nail""'s fanfare for the working man. Consider that the title track is brimful of pro-American nationalism from the Canadian-born songwriter, and you've got a good idea of just how confusing an effort Hawks & Doves can be. But confusion was to be the name of the game for Young in the 1980s, a period celebrated for his principled resistance to record company pigeon-holing, but very, very rarely actually listened to. The fourth reissue in this batch, Re-ac-tor, doesn't quite fall into the gimmick trap that so much of his second full decade's work did, but the effort is still held back by an unhealthy fascination with using guitars as sound effect generators: machine guns in ""Shots"", backfiring cars in ""Motor City"", train engines in ""Southern Pacific"". Quality of songwriting and fierce playing by Crazy Horse manage to redeem the album, however: ""Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze"" and ""Shots"" rank as two of his most underrated barnstormers. To own all four reissues, then, is to witness a couple snapshots of the man mid-streak, and a couple from the immediate aftermath, as he began to slouch towards genre experimentation and respectably above-mediocre twilight. However, all but the most devout Neilologists should forgo the latter two; it'd leave enough money to track down a bootleg copy of Time Fades Away, now the only neglected step-child of Young's peak period (and despite what you may have heard from Neil himself, one of his best). Although we'd love to see that record in print, too, us superior folk would no longer have anything to lord over the peons. Sorry, Col. Molina, your secret recipe is out.","

The Omaha Record,Bottom of the Hudson,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42fb1335d7bf16988cc/1:1/w_160/159920bd.jpg,2003-09-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1076-the-omaha-record/,Absolutely Kosher,"Be post-human!

The next 14 typists get a copy of R.E.M.'s homewreckin' Monster! I got my third Tascam Portastudio today from an eBayer (sorry, dude, I don't do feedback, because ANARCHY) and on the toilet I was reading the hilarious manual The Fast Track to Multi-Track, with stuff about how Sgt. Pepper was made on a four-track. Whoo doggie. Inspiring. If Phil Elvrum made this album, one would barely be able to approach it for the moat of critical spooge. Jack Logan's Bulk should be the last album to be culled from a bunch of homemade demos. Because critics just call subsequent collages Bulk-like. Is the album title a shout-out to the clackity classic The Arizona Record by Silver Jews? Does it have Nebraska's nascent scenelords in mind? In his fascinating essay entitled ""The 'Feminization' of Rock"", Tony Grajeda argues that lo-fi represents a girling of genre, using both Pavement and Sebadoh's terrified response to the spectacle of roid-rage that is Henry Rollins. (Grajeda also examines the masculine ad-culture around hi-fi equipment.) Which is funny, because The Omaha Record, an example of 2003 lo-fi, is pretty durn asexual. What are these songs about? One senses that Hudson's resident genius Eli Simon's only passion is to make more songs. Many of these cuts are klezmer-core. Muszikas meets power-pop. Indie-march. Grit-polka. Damn if the bedroom vanguard didn't succumb to overproduction (see Liz Phair's Matrix abomination, see Pavement and Beck's work with Radiohead's knob-polisher). For those who love blasts: ""The Chilling Sorcerer"" and ""Tokyo"" build to sharp, tremendous, glammy blasts. (This wily, scattershot disc has served as relief pitcher on many a mix CD this summer.) Hey, speaking of Sgt. Pepper, these soggy Bottom boys love that Beatle solo-tone, which they bring to The Beach Boys on ""Eagle Eye"" and to the countrified work of the Rolling Stones on ""Omaha Ray"" (which owes its soul to ""Factory Girl""). Can you say 1960s? Waiter, this gravy is wavy! But wait! Simon often earns the title of Bedroom Bowie, especially on the excellent ""Motorcade""! But wait! Simon often sounds like a Virginian ambassador for New Zealand's Tall Dwarfs and Peter Jeffries. Who doesn't love when patriots cop redcoat accents? Hi, Liars! Hi, Mr. Pollard (did you serve as a consultant on ""Pockets"", with its you-esque lyric, ""The fact of the matter is, my friend, they sold you to the wind king""?)! The intro to the babyfat ""Shoop"" crosses the line of Barlow-homage by looping its ""behind-the-scenes"" self-deprecatus. Meanwhile, ""Red Election"", despite Polara-caliber lyrics and vox, explodes into skree worthy of Rollerskate Skinny and the late, great Jellyfish Kiss. Even devotees of pawn-shop drum machines must admit that this act is a chunk of studio time away from shedding its everyband veneer. Pity their versatility for being cast into a world in which an ""album"" is burdened with being considered a coherent statement rather than an audio diary of the last few years' divergent strains.","Be post-human!

At Crystal Palace,Erase Errata,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc95abf31b7dc7155d5d/1:1/w_160/86b3fe84.jpg,2003-09-29 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2820-at-crystal-palace/,Mute,"From the Fandango and the Mashed Potato to the Roger Rabbit and the Cabbage Patch, dances always get lost to the fickle and fashionable sands of time. While Alfonso Robero infomercials and Thriller videos defined dancefloor moves for the 1980s, 90s kids ground on glowsticks and made ""energy balls"" while flopping about in size 50 Dickies. Which is to say that what's considered danceable now was not necessarily so scant years back. While wallflowering remains the dance of choice for New York's cooler-than cognoscenti, there seems to be a bit more fidgeting out in San Francisco. Gal quartet Erase Errata are often mentioned in the same breath as easily-clumped ""dancepunk"" acts like The Rapture, Liars, and !!!, and for good reason: wiry, spastic, and elastic around their stripped-down culminations of the last twenty years of underground punk and all its permutations, Erase Errata is, at their very core, exuberant. Even a recent set of remixes by Kid606, Matmos, Adult., and Kevin Blechdom failed to significantly alter the group's sound or make it any more danceable. The same goes for the band itself, though, as the follow-up to 2001's Other Animals, At Crystal Palace, simply keeps the course. ""Driving Test"" is the best commuter-meditation-as-portrait-of-suffering-humanity since Nilsson's ""Driving Along"", as singer Jenny Hoyston watches the spectrum of faces blur past. The rest of Erase Errata revs and taps the brakes before settling into a jaunty, stripped-clean groove buoyed by bassist Ellie Erickson and the piston-clicking precision of drummer Bianca Sparta, whose rhythms come and go for scant instants at best before skittering apart and re-forming. For the most part, the sonic surprises are scattered to the corners of songs-- there are little touches here and there: like the trembling trumpet that tremors along with the guitar at the end of ""Ca. Viewing"", taps of piano, or the tape reversal on the second half of the bounding but otherwise too-brief ""Surprize It's Easter"". For the opening moments of the almost anthemic ""Let's Be Active c/o Club Hott"", Sara Jaffe's spiky guitar leads are strident and irregularly melodic. The brain-scratching strings that bob with the eye-thudding bass and clamming hi-hat of ""Owls"", jerk with a tempered ferocity that frees up sharp elbows and wobbly knees for the most spastic of dances. Simple rebounding pull-offs set the rollicking base for ""Retreat! The Most Familiar"", which remains the most tightly wound and effective rock number of the set. Were it not already a Kid606 remix, it would cry out for the treatment. The past, for the most part, is evoked, but the album escapes being too heavily indebted to it. There's plenty of Minutemen twitch, Dog Faced Herman tick, Bikini Kill bossiness, and a cleverly wrapped polemic that even recalls the Desperate Bicycles' delicious DIY rhetoric. While sophomore efforts can fall either to heightened expectations, shorter gestation period, or overreaching goals, the girls have instead kept the machine largely intact and untinkered with, even stripping it all down to a lean twenty-seven minutes. At a future point, the jitters Erase Errata elicit on the dancefloor may be recalled merely as some generation's cringe-worthy fad, but with their grasp of time's out-bursted brevity, they have their moves down pat for the moment.","From the Fandango and the Mashed Potato to the Roger Rabbit and the Cabbage Patch, dances always get lost to ...

Biotop,Asmus Tietchens,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a863b1335d7bf169928a/1:1/w_160/92a3e331.gif,2003-09-29 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8238-biotop/,SkySky,"Lopsided robots with unhinged plates and bits of wire dangling from their joints; malfunctioning machinery whose friendly, yet damaged hum provides the faintest clue its computerized emissions might have originated from a human mind: these scenes from the lab of German electronic music composer Asmus Tietchens are just a few skewed demonstrations of his distant mastery of highbrow composition guised in synth-pop's veneer. In the early 1980s, before he set out on a full-time mission of modern musique concrete and a goal of ""absolute music"" (that which doesn't necessarily paint a picture or tell a story, and most certainly makes no concessions to the accessible), Tietchens followed a detour into short, immediately distinctive electro-snap jingles for vintage German electronica label Sky Records (Moebius/Plank/Neumeier, Conrad Schnitzler). 1981's Biotop was only his second LP after 15 years of perfecting his craft, and should be right on time for folks down with futuristic pop like Cluster or Kraftwerk. Perhaps you're wondering, ""If this guy is so great, why haven't I heard of him?"" My guess is that since albums such as Biotop, and others like Spat Europa and In Die Nacht scheduled for reissue on Die Stadt, have never been available on CD until now. Also, Tietchens (born 1947 in Hamburg) has done a pretty good job of hiding from anyone who might dig strange, tuneful synthesizer ditties by concentrating on more ""serious,"" formalistic electronic works, and releasing albums on such notable experimental labels as Ritornell and Staalplaat. Klangkrieg's Felix Kubin has been an outspoken champion and collaborator of Tietchens, but for the most part, I'd say he hadn't exactly received much due outside of uber-hipster electronic music circles. With that in mind, Biotop is a delight, and with any luck, it will make Tietchens a household name-- at least in houses that already hold modern-day groups like Mouse on Mars, Kammerflimmer Kollektief and even The Notwist in high esteem. This reissue begins with two previously unreleased tracks that fit in very well with the rest of the album, and in fact serve as a nice summarization of the loopy, compact etudes contained therein. ""Futurum Drei"" gallops along with classic Moog lines reminiscent of ones made famous by Wendy Carlos in the early 1970s, though Tietchens isn't here to space you out. In fact, despite the odd layer of reverb and persistent, pinging bassline, the music doesn't seem so much an exercise in electronic composition, but the incidental music to a retro-futuristic movie about a trek through the desert. ""Fast Food"" is much more rhythmically forceful, featuring a goofy, pogo-bounce Latin beat that somehow makes Casio seem like the keyboard of choice for the discriminating listener. Better yet, Tietchens' melody is superb; fans of Yellow Magic Orchestra or early Human League (you know who you are, Plagenhoef) should get a major kick out of this. ""Modern Arroganz"" is synth-pop taken to its logical endpoint: uptempo robo-funk and staccato snare over which minimal Moog hits pitter-patter to no end alongside a computerized vocal proclaiming who knows what scarifying mantra. ""Trümmerköpfe"" eases in with considerably less frantic precision, employing faux-exotica sound effects (Tietchens could have given Esquivel a run for his money) and a cha-cha 4/4 beat. In a bizarro universe (or the one in A Clockwork Orange), maybe this stuff is used as super-strength advertisement music, offering homemakers of the future everything they could possibly need. Other pieces, like the title track, are more obviously experimental. ""Biotop"" begins on a single, piercing note and expands to include overtones from a whole range of synthesizer technology most musicians probably haven't even explored now, much less in 1981. As layer upon layer of bright, somehow comforting fuzz-ambience subsumes the original tone, it suddenly recedes like a supernova into a shadow of its former brilliance. Like most accomplished composers, Tietchens' had a way of making simple elements work wonders. Die Stadt is presently in the process of releasing all of Tietchens' early material in a series of 18 CDs, of which Biotop is the second. It's my favorite of his, and if you're interested in the development of IDM in any way, it's practically required listening. Of all the archival electronic recordings awaiting reissue, Tietchens' work on Sky is some of the most necessary, and consistently enjoyable. Highly recommended.","Lopsided robots with unhinged plates and bits of wire dangling from their\n\ joints; malfunctioning machinery whose friendly, yet damaged ...

Katonah,Apollo Sunshine,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17013d1975652138628/1:1/w_160/64b74ea6.jpg,2003-09-29 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/403-katonah/,spinART,"In the twelve years since R.E.M. unleashed their drool-pop classic ""Shiny Happy People"", loads of kids have seen their gag reflexes honed, suddenly trained to fire full-force at the slightest mention of a self-consciously ""happy"" rock song. Now, eschewing angst and moody poetics for exuberant gushing, the Boston trio Apollo Sunshine (in addition to agreeing to a gush-gush name) are fighting hard to get good-feeling indie-jams back into the ""acceptable"" realm with their debut record, Katonah. Like Ben Folds without the sarcasm, or The Flaming Lips without the psychedelic twist, Apollo Sunshine hock their giggles-and-grins untempered by even the slightest twinge of a dark, foreboding undercurrent. Even the record's sleeve glows bright, sporting well-developed pictures of cheery kids and green grass, golden retrievers, blazing bonfires, and quaint wooden country-porches. But Apollo Sunshine have still managed to transcend the off-putting goofiness that so often accompanies these types of endeavors (see Fountains of Wayne and the getting-more-unbearable-by-the-second ""Stacy's Mom""), releasing a record that, for all its feel-good leanings, isn't mind-numbingly upbeat, or even especially radio-ready. That subversion of expectation is what keeps things interesting; along with their bright-eyed optimism, the band offers up some surprisingly innovative songs and lots of quirky, Sgt. Peppers-ish instrumental flip-flops. Katonah opens with its title song-- a meandering keyboard melody sputters and squeals, dancing around a charging bassline, the entire song popping open like a burst of multi-colored confetti before folding into itself, drifting down into drone and finally bleeding into the next track, the frizzy alt-rocker ""Fear of Heights"". For the most part, vocalist/guitarist Sam Cohen covers the usual lyric terrain (""I Was on the Moon"" recounts the birth of his little brother; ""The Egg"" examines the cycle of life/confusion that accompanies coming of age), but his earnestness is endearing, never wincingly gooey, and always well offset by the kicks and hops going on around him. The key to the this album's appeal is that almost nothing, save Cohen's fairly straightforward vocals, is doing exactly what you think it should be doing at the appointed time: pretty, harmonized endings twitch into jarring, distorted openings, by-the-book guitar strumming unexpectedly somersaults into weird, unbound wailing. It's not that Katonah is anything less than a collection of melodic, hook-riddled cuts, it's that Apollo Sunshine refuse to stop moving, harnessing all their collective, happy-go-lucky energy into a curiously frenetic album, resulting in a debut record that shifts and wiggles like a pile of newborn puppies.","In the twelve years since R.E.M. unleashed their drool-pop classic ""Shiny Happy People"", loads of kids have seen ...

Pasted Lakes,Nick Forté,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6a5e6ef95969323250/1:1/w_160/22a1cfb1.gif,2003-09-29 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3258-pasted-lakes/,Schematic,"Unlike the attic that stores away those forgotten, tuneless chord changes you tentatively composed back in the seventh grade, computers unforgivingly archive even the most tangential, half-remembered experiments. Taken as a whole, the digitized narrative's abortive starts and eventual triumphs transform a lifeless hard drive into a fractured bildungsroman that traces the lopsided development of its anonymous archivist. On Pasted Lakes, unwilling to click and drag his nascent apprenticeship into the trash, Brooklyn-based Nick Forté remixes and recontextualizes the slapdash scraps and cutouts of his first forays into computer music, creating a mixed bag of jaggedly lurching electro experiments initially intended to fit together as a different album entirely. Draping this recycled project in a futuristic atomic-era floor plan, Forté levitates stylistically between muted Lesser and highly caffeinated Nobukaza Takemura; though he mentions utilizing the rhythmic pacing of Wire and The Minutemen as a guide for his work, that particular swing isn't apparent beyond the theoretical nod. Assuming he had found a way to harness the spirit of Double Nickels on the Dime or a fraction of the energy from his work as a guitarist in early 90s hardcore mainstays Rorschach or his later staccato slicing in NYC post-punks Computer Cougar, this stuff would absolutely sizzle with crunchy dynamics, a microwave stuffed with pastel paint samples. Instead, like Christmas Decorations-- his pretty but vacant Kranky-released ambient project with Steve Silverstein-- Pasted Lakes is largely a patch of disjointed background music suffering from snippet sizing and thin Yars' Revenge formations. The first track on the album, ""Green Language"", provides the exception. Here, on the longest and most dynamically sustained piece on the album, Forté creates a richly detailed floatation device suggesting a tide pool in its tiny waves of asymmetrical percussion, shimmering loops, tonal refraction, and a mooning guitar's hum like a digitized gull escaping into the rocky brush. Another strong track, ""Blender Dance"" works along two strands: gentle percussion powered by shiny star reflections torn apart with a ratty tonal loop. More reminiscent of poor-man dadaist Phil Milstein than the high-modernist gloss of Mouse on Mars or Oval, the other works flit and flutter as brief sound-effect montages; some heave and hurl and fold inward, others stagger over sine waves or burrow through logarithms, but none take off or swagger into different dimensions. ""Sugar Lemoned"" is slowcore Gamelan played with digitized kazoos; ""Did You Feel That?"" falls into Space Invaders territory. Likewise, ""Swallowing Gel"" is a flatulent Atari attack from congested locusts. Bits like ""Crack and Crevice"" and ""Kill Your Carpet"" coast at a slower pace, without managing to shift the tonal quality of the work. But all isn't lost. While Forté's leftovers do lack the depth and textured spaciousness of more experienced progenitors of CPU riffage, the rugged punk-rock heart beating behind his often beautiful collages produces a sense of gleeful discovery absent on more dryly established productions. And that's a small good thing.","Unlike the attic that stores away those forgotten, tuneless chord changes you tentatively composed back in\n\ the seventh grade ...

The Meadowlands,The Wrens,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa74ea9e61561daa5bce/1:1/w_160/f3d05a45.jpg,2003-09-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8742-the-meadowlands/,Absolutely Kosher,"Let me come out of the gate stating the obvious: The summer of 1996 was a fucking long time ago. I was fresh out of high school then, living with my parents in the outlying suburbs of Minneapolis, trying to craft an embryonic Pitchfork into something respectable without any prior writing experience. In the throes of that disgustingly humid, buggy summer in which it seemed I would one day die as I'd lived-- navigating the road construction obstacle course on Hwy 5 and despising an oppressive day job, yet forever hopeful of some distant, supernatural delivery-- Secaucus was sunwarmed bliss, the infinite pleasure zone I couldn't stop hitting. Bursting immediately at its seams with the serrated dual guitar blast of ""Yellow Number Three"" and ""Built in Girls""' steam-engine roar, Secaucus welcomes with a warm immediacy rare in even the most revered pop treasures, and a density whose every layer hides another secret synth melody, jagged hook or vocal harmony. The depth of realization in this record is unparalleled: every angle is perfected. Its surplus of pristine pop hooks and energetic discharge rivals the best of Built to Spill, Guided by Voices, Pavement, or any other heralded indie rock band, and tracks like the anthemic, accelerating ""I've Made Enough Friends"", the wistful malaise of ""Won't Get Too Far"", the hurtling ""Surprise, Honeycomb"", and the emotive high-school slowdance number ""Jane Fakes a Hug"" reveal proof in spades: Beyond their euphoric harmonies, melodic rapture, and marblemouthed vocals lie some of the greatest lyrics the genre's seen yet. Respectively, these songs contain tales of a nationwide murder rampage (""Being good made me burst/ The killing got worse/ It almost got fun""), a lovestruck abandonment of social lives (""A rush of wonder/ This charm we're under might last/ Are we too hoping/ Our years are showing and fast""), a hopeless high school graduate who fears he won't live up to his father's achievements (""I can't believe I'm grown/ None of my friends live at home/ Not since fall""), and the harrowing play-by-play of a brutal divorce (""Our oaths, our realty, a good job, a husband/ A husband or what/ Christ, Jane, I'm not/ I never was""). But as long ago as all of that was for me, for The Wrens, it's been an eternity. The band always made themselves accessible via Internet, and as the years passed, I would frequently email to wonder when a follow-up was due-- and even as I knew they had respectable careers and families, I didn't expect it would take seven years to see release. I also hadn't known that, at the height of their 1996 U.S. tour, all promotion for Secaucus was, allegedly, pulled in a huff by Grass Records labelhead Alan Melzter when the band dared question a million-dollar contract he'd tried to strongarm them into signing. It was just another in a long string of sloppy breakups that would eventually sour the band on the music industry. After endless reassurances that their third album would be out ""in a few months, we promise,"" hope began to fade that the record would ever see light of day at all. Then came word that they had actually finished the record, and-- to celebrate and prevent them from further second-guessing-- were holding a party to destroy the master tapes. The package finally arrived from the band themselves: an advance, unmastered CD-R labeled The Meadowlands with makeshift artwork and tentative song titles. Excitedly, I threw it into the car stereo, and waited. Waiting. Waiting. What the fuck happened to these guys? It had been seven years, sure-- no one was expecting anything as powerful as Secaucus from middle-agers, but to say The Wrens had mellowed would almost be a joke: There was little trace of the youthful, resonant joy or ecstatic intensity of Secaucus. This was a completely different band. These Wrens were defeated, miserable, hopeless, and-- in their own words-- exhausted. Disappointed, I shelved the disc and stubbornly refused to listen to the final pressing, even after it arrived at the Pitchfork P.O. box loving wrapped in Tiffany-blue ribbon and paper. Which was about when everyone I knew began raving. People were stunned at my reaction: Surely we'd just heard different albums? And we had, but upon finally listening to the finished version after heavy persuasion from friends, it began to make more sense. This was a completely different band, defeated, miserable, and exhausted, absolutely, but not hopeless. Defying the unwritten rule that any band breaking a five-plus year hiatus must return lethargic and sapped of inspiration before retreating again to obscurity, here The Wrens prove themselves even more shockingly relevant than before-- they have survived extinction, and, fully inspired, they are telling the tale: The Meadowlands is a crushing confessional, documenting every disappointment of the past seven years, every difficult breakup, every bad gig. If The Wrens were lyrically powerful when writing from third-person perspectives about trivial fantasies on Secaucus, they're devastating delivering their own personal failures, hardships and resignations. The breakup tracks are the least of it, and even those are masochistically autobiographical with recurring characters and story arcs bridging songs. ""She Sends Kisses"" opens on an acoustic strum and reflective accordion, increasingly piling on layers of instrumentation (electric guitar, drums, piano, vocal harmonies) while Charles Bissell reflectively croons, ""A sophomore at Brown/ She worked lost and found/ I put your face on her all year."" ""Ex-Girl Collection"" is upbeat on the surface and conflict beneath: ""Ann slams in/ Another lightning round begins.../ 'Charles, I found out/ Wipe that smile off your mouth/ I think it's tell-me time.'"" ""13 Months in 6 Minutes"" is somber and damp-eyed, dewy guitars drenched in wet reverb and whispered vocals at the end of a relationship: ""I'm a footnote at best/ I envy who comes next."" But the first-hand accounts of the band's own struggles are what really hit hard, particularly for listeners who've waited the full seven years or who have intimate familiarity with similar situations. ""Everyone Choose Sides""-- backed by crusty guitar fighting determinedly through tape falloff, electric piano, and Jerry MacDonnell's insistent, urgent drumming-- is a notable album peak: ""Bored and rural-poor at 35/ I'm the best 17-year-old ever.../ We're losing sand/ A Wrens' ditch battle plan.../ Everyone choose sides/ The whole to-do of what to do for money/ Poorer or not this year and hell's the difference."" And then there's ""This Boy Is Exhausted"", which blends the record's brightest hooks with its bleakest lines: Over two layers of blaring guitars (one pulsing, the other jangling), more of MacDonnell's colossal drumwork, and resolute background vocals, Bissell's hardened vocal buzzes: ""I can't write what I know/ It's not worth writing/ I can't tell a hit from hell from one sing-along.../ But then once a while/ We'll play a show that makes it worthwhile."" The Wrens are now old enough to be considered indie rock's elder statesmen (their ages range from 33 to 40), and in trading the adolescent kick of Secaucus for ripened resignation, meticulous refinement for crippling maturation, they have realized their magnum opus-- the only album to eclipse Broken Social Scene's staggering You Forgot It in People on my year-end list. The Meadowlands exemplifies what every fan hopes for when a band announces a reunion or returns from more than a half-decade of silence: that they might have somehow improved exponentially each year they hid from the limelight, resulting in a payoff so cultivated it could be called their defining achievement by consensus. It's the reason we continue to harbor mixed feelings about a Pixies comeback: odds are, it ends in disappointment-- it always does-- but The Meadowlands is that one example left standing to offer a glimmer of hope. Black Francis, tomorrow this could be you.","Let me come out of the gate stating the obvious: The summer of 1996 was a fucking long time ago ...

Scattered Ashes: A Decade of Emperial Wrath,Emperor,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdfeb335119a49ecd71/1:1/w_160/346e8cf3.gif,2003-09-25 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2889-scattered-ashes-a-decade-of-emperial-wrath/,Candlelight,"Do you really wanna know about black metal? Take your time. Don't make a hasty decision, because it's not really one of those kinds of music where you can dip your toe in to decide if it's lukewarm enough. Norway's Emperor are where I started a couple of years ago, and thus far, where I'm stuck. It's not that their stuff isn't so unfuckingbelievably great that I can hardly keep from breaking your windows, but-- where to go after this? Every piece of music they played seemed like a final statement, something to bookend the miserable/triumphant human experience. From 1991 until 2001, Emperor enjoyed top black billing and, although Mayhem predated them by several years, are often referred to as the kings of the genre. Because of their various legal troubles over the years (just the average church burning, homosexual partner slaying shenanigans most of us went through during our sensitive years-- oh, and some light Satanism), they've gotten some press that may have inadvertently hoisted them into a larger spotlight than they asked for. The morality police will have my head for this, but I think the writers who focus on that stuff are probably the same ones thinking Emperor would be a lot better if they didn't scream all the time. The band formed in 1991 as a trio featuring guitarist/keyboardist/lead-singer Isaahn, drummer Samoth and voluntarily freaked elf-guy Mortiis on bass. They recorded an extra lo-fi, hi-black demo titled Wrath of the Tyrant, which got them signed to UK metalmongers Candlelight Records. After a split with fellow Norwegians Enslaved, adding drummer Bard Faust (watch the blade), and subtracting insane-clown-gnome Mortiis, Emperor produced their undisputedly classic full-length debut, In the Nightside Eclipse. This was an album that retained all the gothic, ragged edge of Wrath, but upped the compositional ante and musical diversity with operatic vocals in between the tried-and-true Isaahn growl/shriek, and their best-yet use of symphonic grandeur via synths and extended tunes. When drummer Trym Torson (formerly of Enslaved) joined, the band altered their sound slightly, going with a more overtly technical style-- some people called it prog-metal, some extreme metal, others call it that noise Mike Patton was doing with Dillinger Escape Plan. In any case, 1997's Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk and 1999's IX Equilibrium did nothing but expand their worldwide profile, though especially after the latter, perhaps alienated a few fans thinking they'd gone all Dream Theater. Emperor's swan song, 2001's fairly amazing Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire and Demise, is arguably their most technically and compositionally complex album. Scattered Ashes: A Decade of Emperial Wrath is the VH1-style special-length specimen those of you curious about Emperor should seek out: one disc of choice album cuts from throughout their career, another disc of rarities and covers. Everything great about the band is on display here, and if you're left wanting more, you can always head for the albums and EPs. IX Equilibrium's ""Curse You All Men"" opens the first disc, and if you didn't request a pummeling-- well, fuck it. DIGGADIGGADIGGADIGGA goes the double bass, as Isaahn's silo of riffs suck my head in. His humble musings on the nature of things (""My word is your defeat, and thou shalt not be able to hide anymore!"") hardly take away from power of the song. Say what you want about Emperor's wanky later days, they knew how to produce an album. Even better is Prometheus' ""The Tongue of Fire"", which features one of the great, cyclical-depressive guitar riffs. It's as if Faith No More decided grew a pair (no, a real pair), hired a serious drummer and realized that, yes, you can fill up a metal song with synths and not get labeled alt-something. Later, Nightside's ""I Am the Black Wizards"", probably their best-known song, makes its entrance. At this point, Emperor were still slightly ""amateur"" in their execution, but much closer to the darkness I would attribute to prototypical black metal. In truth, the feel of their early music isn't that far removed from straight thrash, but Isaahn's hawk-cry vocals and the band's ultra-compressed, top-heavy mix injected a claustrophobic, disturbing tenor to their stuff. To me, ""Wizards"" is black metal. ""Inno a Santana"" (also from Nightside) foreshadows their later work using the orchestral majesty of Isaahn's vocal harmonies and angelic keyboard lines, but still packs a wallop from via Faust's skull-pound thrash drumming and a swirling, echo chamber ambience. As usual, the first disc is for the press, and the rest is for the fans. Their cover of influential ""Viking metal"" masters Bathory's ""A Fine Day to Die"" actually plays up Emperor's more traditionally, straight-up metal roots. It's not as fast as a typical Emperor track, but is almost as furious due to the blunt thud of drums and out-of-character acoustic guitar interludes. Thorns' ""\xC6rie Descent"" (from an Emperor/Thorns split) gets the extra-badass treatment, and is especially impressive when you consider that this kind of vaguely Sabbath-inspired haze-metal seemed well beyond Emperor's reach by 1998. Bonus points for the 19th century pump organ, though some detracted for the ""Sworn"" remix that might sound okay during the slower Matrix scenes, but not here. I don't want to mislead you: Emperor are squarely metal, and if you have a problem with that, Scattered Ashes will probably be too much to take at once. But that's fine-- break her in, listen to her soft, peek at your CD player when you think it's not looking. At some point you're going to have to face them head on. Anyone already into the band will want this compilation for its second disc (and probably skipped this review entirely), so for the others, I'm reaching out. Sometimes you have to have a little faith, and if you can't trust the kings of black metal, then who?","Do you really wanna know about black metal? Take your time.

Singles 93-03,The Chemical Brothers,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5939d034d5c69bf3322/1:1/w_160/fee94cc3.jpg,2003-09-25 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1413-singles-93-03/,Astralwerks,"Few artists have suffered as much guilt-by-association in the past decade as the Chemical Brothers; they've been derided as simpletons for spawning the now-mostly-unloved big beat genre, recording with Noel Gallagher, and unwittingly earning a spot among the U.S. media's leading faces for 90s ""electronica."" Some dance purists sneer at their lack of a traditional floor-filling build and release (they more often opt for a highlight-reel approach instead) and their tendency to exalt their collaborators at the expense of the crowd. But, while it's true the duo's key to success was their tendency to borrow heavily from rock's immediacy and penchant for noise, their rock/dance interface did seem a fresh and natural progression of dance music's mid-90s evolution. From their roots in Manchester's Acid House days, the duo's clear talent lied in the combination of hip-hop's urgency with the crowd-pleasing peaks of house and techno. Innovation never seemed as much a priority for them as repeatedly striking a listener's pleasure zone-- though, to be fair, there is a more of a sense of narrative and conscious dynamic in their records than can be found in those of big beat contemporaries like Fatboy Slim, Propellerheads and Apollo 440. It's unfortunate that Astralwerks has chosen this moment to compile the first decade of the duo's career (mid-90s electronica seems to be in the deepest valley of cultural relevance that it may experience in the next twenty years), but it's a solid collection nonetheless, rounded out with two new tracks: one collaboration with Canadian rapper K-OS, and another with The Flaming Lips. Presented chronologically, the disc opens with two songs from the Exit Planet Dust LP. ""Song to the Siren"" and ""Chemical Beats"", originally credited to The Dust Brothers (the moniker was later ceded to the American production team), sounded something like a hybrid of Public Enemy (mostly due to their pillaging of Bomb Squad riffs and breakbeats) and less effete shoegaze groups, albeit with heavy influence from the Balearic melting-pot. ""Leave Home"" follows, offering more pummeling sub-bass and homage to old-school hip-hop-- it even contained the prominent B-boy vocal snippet ""brothers gonna work it out,"" doubling as a statement of intent and a reference to their bandname litigation. ""Block Rockin' Beats"", the first of a handful of selections from the band's U.S. breakthrough, Dig Your Own Hole, is also peppered with sirens and bass, and while it may have been their most direct hardcore techno/hip-hop crossover, its reliance on repetition and a near-pop song structure made it feel slightly overlong. The buzzing, psych-informed Noel Gallagher collaboration ""Setting Sun"" borrowed liberally from The Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" and featured screeching guitar and a brilliant mid-frequency breakdown before throwing the listener back into the deep end of sub-bass and breakbeats. Another Beatles-quoting track, ""The Private Psychedelic Reel"", demonstrates the band's eclecticism, belying its techno roots. So far, so good. Despite its attempts to move away from pervious sound, the duo's third album, Surrender, was hamstrung by too much recycling: the same guests or types of guests, the same moods, and the same use of soundbyte and dynamics. Here, the Brothers made concessions to their rock stardom and continued to engage with that world in the few ways they knew how-- more textured, atmospheric guitars and drowsy, morning-after vocals. The pedestrian ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" lacked their usual big drums and obvious hooks, which would be fine were its vocal sample stronger. Compared to some of Surrender's more house-oriented and delicately textured tracks-- such as ""Music: Response"", the delightfully minimal ""Got Glint?"", and ""Under the Influence""-- ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" was an electro-house snore. The Balearic, almost filter-disco feel and Bernard Sumner vocals of ""Out of Control"", however, are a welcome addition here, as is ""Let Forever Be"", which, despite the duo's decision to fly in the drum track from ""Setting Sun"" and to feature another over-stretched vocal from Noel Gallagher, was ultimately a more sophisticated offering than its predecessor. 2002's Come with Us was coldly received by the public and critics, and the songs featured here fail to make a solid case for reconsideration. ""Star Guitar"", the collection's most rave-oriented track, doesn't leave much of an impression, but may as well be Beethoven's 9th next to the Richard Ashcroft collaboration ""The Test"". Opening with a bit of ""Papua New Guinea""-like tribalism, the song is ground to a halt by Ashcroft's flaccid shaman act and ponderous drug lyrics. The song is simple hippie bullshit, a deserved companion for Fatboy Slim's equally wretched Jim Morrison-quoting ""Sunset (Bird of Prey)"". The duo's new collaboration with K-OS raises the question as to why, when hip-hop has so obviously informed their music, they'd never before teamed with an emcee, even while K-OS' lyrics and delivery are somewhat wanting. The Flaming Lips collaboration ""The Golden Path"", meanwhile, features a bouncy Pet Shop Boys beat over which Wayne Coyne employs what is essentially his natural voice for most of the track before drifting into his more recognizable affected falsetto. Unfortunately, like Ashcroft, Coyne seems to prefer play-acting to making a positive contribution, and his stream-of-consciousness good-vs-evil dialog is detrimental to the track's staying power. Though one could easily be misled by its title, this compilation doesn't purport to be a complete collection of The Chemical Brothers' singles, Among the missing are ""Loops of Fury"", inexplicably relegated to being the highlight of the album's limited-edition bonus disc, which offers eleven B-sides, mixes, and rarities as extras. Additionally, the disc features a live version of the also regrettably omitted ""Elektrobank"", as well as the ""original version"" of Come With Us highlight ""Galaxy Bounce"", and B-sides such as ""Morning Lemon"" and ""If You Kling to Me I'll Klong to You"". So like many career-spanning collaborations, Singles 93-03 sacrifices quality control for a democratic approach that lends nearly equal weight to all four of the band's albums, and avoids the opportunity to re-examine and highlight lesser-known tracks. For more than ten years, the Chemical Brothers have been one of the most vibrant post-acid house artists in the UK, but the only clear reason for their fans to plump for this disc are mostly located on the now-requisite limited-edition bonus disc. Were the record's second half to have been filled with the best bits of the Chemical Brothers' last two albums, rather than offering a handful of limp new tracks and minor hits, these two discs would have been the best possible 1-2 punch for Chemical Brothers newbies. As it stands, those two discs are still called Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole.","Few artists have suffered as much guilt-by-association in the past decade as the Chemical Brothers; they've been derided as ...

Soup,Bola,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a429c0084474cd0c0426/1:1/w_160/328c081d.jpg,2003-09-25 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1071-soup/,SkamSkam,"I really feel my age when records happened upon in a label-fueled spree of whimsy in college (usually tethered to those first credit card apps) begin to exchange sweaty hands for absurd sums and get reissued again under the tag of ""classic."" The early Skam catalog still goes for exorbitantly high prices, and while I snatched up the soft blue cardboard sleeve of Darrell Fitton's first full-length as part-investment, part-listening pleasure, it never sunk in as an out-and-out classic. Before I even realize it, though, here I am looking back nostalgically for those idyll days of IDM, when the programming and exponential mutations were secondary to how the emotive melodicism of the lines played out. Not much has changed on this reissue, really, save that Mr. Fitton's face has been replaced with a doodling by Skam's resident draw-rer, Mr. England. Spotters may feel gypped by the reasonable pricing, but Pitchfork's blind readership will be chuffed to know that Skam's telltale Braille strip remains intact on the jewel case. Opening with a grandeur that recalls Aphex Twin's sweeping remix of Gavin Bryar's ""The Sinking of the Titanic"", ""Glink"" is an epic opener of alien gurgles, expansive strings, and slowly ventilating beats. Bola's pedigree extends back to Warp's Rosetta Stone of Artificial Intelligence (he actually appeared on Vol. 2) and that similar sort of synth classicism pervades the tracks. ""Versivo"" and ""Amnion."" offer a middle ground between the ""golden"" sound of Autechre circa Amber (pre-algorithmic number crunch) and the hazier hues of one-time labelmates Boards of Canada. Climbing between these two pillars, the vistas attained are still gorgeous, if not vaguely Kitaro-esque, untouched by either time lapse or technological leaps. ""Forcasa"", separated into three sections, sweeps with grandeur through the middle of the album. The rhythms puncture the docile, near-""meditational"" hillside sounds like resonant aluminum rabbit fences. The consequent shine of the beat has a touch of rust, though, which keeps ""Forcasa 1"" rooted and earthy, the swells and sprung gusts of synth blowing across the structured metallic lattices in a glorious way. The second section reveals those pastures to be almost ""jungle,"" as the steel drums and cymbal hits patter like rain in denser keyboard layers. It ain't Metalheadz; in fact, it's closer to Vangelis' gestures and analogue ideals of space gas and ether than anyone could've suspected-- especially when compared to the more awkward Tricky bloke-hop of releases like the Mauver EP, or in brief lapses on the otherwise gorgeous Fyuti. ""Aguilla"", meanwhile, is a lost Skam classic from the ridiculously arcane pressings in the seven-inch format, fully saved and realized in album form soon after. Bobbing on an overcast drum hit with just enough staticky crunch left at the center of its haze, Fitton effectively dribbles in choral curlicues and telltale flautist airs as intimate as anything the Boards do. Going back to Soup reveals its true properties: it's much more low-key and subtle than his geographical peers near Manchester, yet mines a similar mid-to-late 90s aesthetic. Comforting and as innately familiar as Mom's homemade Split Pea, the melodic base is better clarified on this reissue, an alien lightness and separation in its soundtrack broth that stays buoyant and warm. A Miso perhaps?","I really feel my age when records happened upon in a label-fueled spree of whimsy in college (usually tethered to ...

Twinkle Echo,Casiotone for the Painfully Alone,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5429d034d5c69bf3275/1:1/w_160/99428e9e.jpg,2003-09-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1336-twinkle-echo/,Tomlab,"Though decisively not the most enterprising of recent Tomlab releases, Twinkle Echo, the third full-length from lonely songsmith Owen Ashworth (aka Casiotone for the Painfully Alone) reveals endless nuance and wit within a seemingly exhaustible medium: two-minute Casio keyboard-spun pop songs. It'd be all too easy to file his now static formula under ""harmless gimmick,"" but what Ashworth lacks in breadth and depth he gains in sonic fluency and ease of digestion. And while he has essentially tapped this act for all it's worth (Twinkle Echo being his master's thesis in battery-powered home recording), I still can't quite bring myself to elevate him into a new stratospheric peer-bracket. In application, his true classmates (and, in truth, professors) run the gamut from Stephin Merritt and John Darnielle, as evidenced through his piecemeal song structures and earnest delivery, down to sonic colleagues All-Time Quarterback and Atom & His Package. Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart, with whom Ashworth will soon embark upon a Japanese tour, guests on this album to aid with the mixing and once-augment Ashworth's Casio SK-1 and keyboard army with a few smears of guitar. He even plays shows with The Rapture, so all told, circumstance doesn't exactly paint a painfully lonely picture. However, most of his music does. Although Casiotone's music is fundamentally digitally based-- comprised of stock percussion tracks, a few protracted waves of flimsy keyboard rhythms, and one-shot narrative verse-laden melodies-- it feels wholly organic. The sound is full of lo-fi hiss and obfuscation, as if maybe Ashworth left his equipment out in the rain overnight, or needs to change the AA's. Man and machine limp arm-over-shoulder through many of these fourteen threadbare snapshots, never playing chicken with the hard-and-fast limitations bearing down on them. Each song is emotionally laid bare, giving the impression that the fourteen inclusions here were written for no more than an audience of maybe fourteen people, though Ashworth claims not to air out his personal (mis)fortunes in his songs. He continually references locales (""I wish we could've talked all night/ We had to be in Illinois by daylight"" from ""Jeane, If You're Ever in Portland"") and time (""Six more weeks and it's back to school/ It's perfect weather/ The moon is full/ We'll ride all night under the streetlights"") as if encoding moments from a personal timeline that flows through his keyboard. In the latter track, ""Casiotone for the Painfully Alone in a Yellow T-Shirt"", Ashworth fittingly delivers the line, ""Don't borrow the car/ It's what we've got bicycles for,"" in an excellent metaphor for his pragmatic approach to storytelling. He takes the simplest route from A to B, and though the sketches do come off as personally affecting, they gain universal appeal through their artlessness. ""Toby, Take a Bow"" employs nearly the exact same high-end percussion pattern as Death Cab for Cutie's ""Photobooth"", but instead of counter-punctually launching into a warm pop lick, he meets the beat below the water line and wades in the foamy, under-produced wake. Occasionally he turns up the tempo, as on ""It Wasn't the Same Somehow"" and ""Students for the Scarves & Charms"", but never abandons the stark, conversational delivery of his slower moments. For such a literate and levelheaded lonely talent, Ashworth exploits the medium for all its worth without ever venturing into pretension, and this is precisely what ensures him success and makes this album such an effortless listen. Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to seem him take a swing at something bigger. After all, the twice-mentioned Ben Gibbard (ATQ's ""Why I Cry"") as well as Atom & His Package have already covered Stephin Merritt songs in recent albums, which tells me something: The well for this sort of thing has nearly run dry, and though CFTPA has managed to escape dehydration, Ashworth could conceivably better quench his thirst in deeper waters.","Though decisively not the most enterprising of recent Tomlab releases, Twinkle Echo, the third full-length from lonely songsmith Owen Ashworth ...

Amazing Grace,Spiritualized,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5159d034d5c69bf31fb/1:1/w_160/093b10e4.jpg,2003-09-24 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7422-amazing-grace/,Sanctuary,"In the 1980s, Jason Pierce distilled Dylan's methadone strumming, Roky Erickson's psychedelic circular breathing and LaMonte Young's numbing minimalism, and sold the delirious result to us as Spacemen 3. In the 1990s, he continued his tasteful pilfering as the figurehead of Spiritualized-- on Pure Phase, he defined blissed-out noise-pop; on Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space, he lifted murky hedonism from Jim Dickinson and voodoo rites from Dr. John (who even guested on the record), building towers of song on a 50-piece orchestral foundation. At its peak stood a full gospel choir, bellowing heartache and redemption. This decade hasn't been quite as kind. 2001's Let It Come Down, the ridiculously anticipated follow-up to Ladies and Gentlemen which Pierce spent four years crafting, was at times musically and lyrically powerful, but rarely both at once. And Pierce's decision to double the size of the Spiritualized Philharmonic failed to up the impact of his by-then-familiar post-breakup moaning, religious conviction, and continuing struggles with drug addiction. Now, in 2003, it seems clear-- even to Pierce-- that a change is necessary, and with Amazing Grace, he heads back to that motherly womb of rock 'n' roll: the garage. Unfortunately, there are problems from the beginning: As Pierce's voice bleats through blaring feedback on the opening track, ""This Little Life of Mine"", there's an unfillable void in his recklessly delivered lyrics where the song's emotional core should lie. His reconstituted band blazes, led by the bonfire-leads of guitarist Doggen (on loan from Brain Donor), but they also lurch in an almost sluggish manner that, push and pull as they might, never actually gets the lead out. There are highlights: ""She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)"" (it owes to the similarly titled Spector-produced Crystals song in name only) is cut from the same patch of denim and black leather as ""This Little Life of Mine"", but more convincingly evokes the sneering garage aesthetic of The Troggs and early Kinks; ""Cheapster"", burning through a variation on ""Bob Dylan's 115th Dream"", brandishes switchblade-sharp chops; and ""Never Goin' Back"" proves Spiritualized can nail The Stooges shtick as well as any of the usurping mainstream garage rockers-- but no better. Here, he replicates the bottled, melting scowl of Iggy circa the primordial Funhouse, but his imitation, like the kids he schools, is stripped of the necessary blood/cum combo needed to carry the shot through to the heart. Of course, rock was never what Pierce did best: it's the strung-out ballads and slow, unfurling of studio sounds that's always carried his wasted messages to beatific, almost narcotic effect-- as such, ""Hold On"" and ""Lord Let It Rain on Me"" serve as the linchpins of this record. For its entire opening flourish, the former tames itself into a soft strum as Pierce implores you to ""hold on to those you hold dear."" It's yet another demonstration of his ability to transcend limp Hallmark maxims through sheer will and conviction: he emotes no irony or bitterness, transforming simple truisms and cliches into heartbreaking revelations, much like Wayne Coyne observing that ""the sun don't go down"" in ""Do You Realize??"" And despite that the new has worn off this technique somewhat in the 20+ years Pierce has relied on it, in this moment it proves as effective as ever. Amazing Grace also manages some mildly interesting jazz flourishes. ""Rated X"" does about a minute's worth of Miles Davis' ""He Loved Him Madly"" before Pierce's weightless astronaut murmuring sends the song into the beckoning orchestral stratosphere, and ""The Power and the Glory"" features the record's most forward-looking moment, as it builds to a massive, cacophonous swell, aided by a horn section that puts British improv legends Kenny Wheeler and Evan Parker in front of their largest audience yet. After that intriguing instrumental fury, however, Pierce marches his poor, abused gospel choir back into place with the solemn tom thuds and plaintive guitar strum of ""Lord Let It Rain on Me."" Pieced together from at least four other Spiritualized songs, Pierce doles out more of his redemptive raindrops while ""looking down the barrel of a gun,"" before finally unleashing another predictably bombastic endorphin downpour. Here, as with tracks like the banal ""The Ballad of Richie Lee"" and the repetitive, melodramatic closing lullaby ""Lay It Down Easy"", Pierce finally wears out his welcome, having utterly exhausted the possibilities of what can be accomplished within the limited constraints he's set for himself. Pierce's ability to convey pain-- much like the recovering addict's ability to feel pleasure-- is all but lost among clusters of burnt-out receptors. Even in its most inspired moments, Amazing Grace lacks the fiery intensity of any of Pierce's previous outings (including Let It Come Down). Now, fervently praying to channel the uplift of true gospel and the Gnostic moments of the Nuggets era, J Spacemen is left, for the first time, sobbing at the pearly gates.","In the 1980s, Jason Pierce distilled Dylan's methadone strumming, Roky Erickson's psychedelic circular breathing and LaMonte Young's ...

Kitsch Concrete,Fritz Ostermayer,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba34eb335119a49ec983/1:1/w_160/3bb5e02c.jpg,2003-09-24 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6087-kitsch-concrete/,Mego,"For a time, my main cultural connections to Austria were the tersely misanthropic novelist and playwright Thomas Bernhard, the shit-and-swan-obsessed Vienna Actionists, and the super cloying yet oddly affecting The Sound of Music, which, as a kid, I unwittingly turned into transgression worthy of Otto Muehl by shifting the melancholic refrain of ""Edelweiss"" into the more violently intrusive ""Anal Vice"". On Kitsch Concrete, Vienna-based broadcaster, author, DJ and musician Fritz Ostermayer coaxes these disparate points of departure into a waft of garish prettiness that exudes the desolate joy of a tinsel-strewn pub swathed in red felt wallpaper and sporting a jukebox dedicated to both the desiccated whirls of Musique Concrete and the martini-fueled torch-songs of Mel Torme and Roxy Music. Sublimely evoking an Austrian Johnny Cash shooting for high notes, Ostermayer applies the tenants of Pierre Henry to trumpet, clarinet, choir, boy/girl duets, electronics, tinny samples, drums, and drum machines, and dislocated bits of Procol Harum, Austrian multi-instrumental didgeridooist Hermann Delago and the German trance band Emou. From the soft-focused lightbulb heart overlooking a 120 Days of Sodom orgy and a quote from 19th century naturalist-novel courtesan Josephine Mutzenbacher to a yodeling shout-out to Bertolt Brecht and a promotional photo of Ostermayer with a gun in his mouth, the old sod exhibits a facility for intelligent juxtapositions and imagistic layering. The 47-year-old self-described ""romantic anarchist"" locates the sentimental aura surrounding a projected fuck-fest and sets it within a low-bit remake of ""Pale Blue Eyes"" by Bony M. For the less triumphant, more downcast swells, Ostermayer is a brokenhearted, tear-in-his-Heineken Kurt Schwitters teaming with Burt Bacharach to commemorate a failed seduction (while reams of unclaimed dadaist love songs flit namelessly around town on flyers composed with half-eaten typography and gin-flavored bubblegum). His tenderly scatological originals, ethnic-sounding standards, Eastern European techno, and blissfully sodden versions of John Cale's ""Big White Cloud"" and Sparks' ""Angst in My Pants"" and ""Fun Bunch of Guys"" are the gaudiest of melodies sung over caustic, droning, growling backdrops. Ostermayer's most successful remake is a heartfelt croon on the text of Nick Cave's version of ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"". Ostermayer turns the gospel ballad into electronic Kraftwerk drama kept together with a nob-twisting pitch-shifter center. Really, the oddball Russian Gypsy dance groove implanted on Sparks and the drama-queen Cale aren't too shabby either. Otherwise, ""Ave Little Maria"" is as rousing a broken-angel drinking hymn as just about anything I've heard by The Pogues or on Tom Waits' Closing Time; Ostermayer's ability to wrap a tiny love song in such a garish coating of paint is something special. He lifts my pastel-hued spirits to the heavens while allowing my soiled mind to remain in the shit-caked gutter.

Living in America,Sounds,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a632ea9e61561daa52f8/1:1/w_160/64a7d6a9.jpg,2003-09-24 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7701-living-in-america/,New Line,"The word on the streets (and by this I mean the spieled sophistry coursing through press releases and talk shows) is that The Sounds are a perky, lovable bunch of Swedes that meld punk and new wave. In actuality, they're more a conjoining of less irritating pop of the 80s (The Ramones, Blondie) with the more irritating pop of the 80s (Loverboy, Pat Benatar). Now, 80s pop might mean a lot of things to a lot of people, infused with an ambiguity beyond description, but whatever we mutter about it under our breaths, the word ""punk"" seldom comes up in relation. Dashing all expectations, however, The Sounds have a song called ""Riot"". Now I may not have passed Punk 101; I admit I still don't really know what Crass was. But my general intuition is that if you have a song called ""Riot"" anything, you are probably punk. Also, a vast majority of these songs are what we might have considered to be punk in middle school. There's probably not a great distance between The Sounds' titular song and your typical intentionally unrealistic adolescent Offspring song. It's a lot of ""We don't care about the world today/ We're not living in America and we're not sorry"" and tales of ""teenage porn stars."" (Never mind that the average American probably sees an indissoluble link between Sweden and porn.) This is about the gist of most of the songs that aren't about ""getting up and dancing."" And hey, I ain't complaining. It's a pretty simple political philosophy (yes to porn stars and dancing, no to America) that even the most jaded of today's younglings might clamor to embrace. It would be a grave disservice to all involved, however, to call this boisterous, jubilant, sleepover-at-Casey's disco-punk rampage ""political music."" In fact, it's ironi-feminism. On the perversely appealing ""Hit Me"", Maja Ivarsson enjoins us (or me, anyway), to ""hit me hard, hit me right between the eyes."" I admit, the offer intrigued me; it took a strong recollection of my spiritual training to refuse to comply. But this brutal temptation to deck an innocent girl was merely my willingness to participate in a faux-jazz, hyper-propulsive grime accented by a keyboardist (Jesper Anderberg) who clearly doesn't even know where his volume control is, let alone how notes played together might constitute a chord. But permit me to make amends for my long and tedious-- and perhaps unfair-- grievances. The ensuing song, ""Mine for Life"", is a faithful duplication of Garbagesque camp that attaches a maleficent beat to some quivering synths. We can make fun of Ivarsson's lyrics all we want. The fact of the matter is that the line, ""If this is called living, well don't count me in,"" is at least worthy of a Ramones song; I'm pretty sure I heard it somewhere on ""Tombstone Blues"". ""Rock 'n' Roll"" musters just the right amount of capriciousness and martyrdom in the name of rock. It would make many cringe, but deflects any criticism. The song is fully aware that it is, at best, a two-note bass riff with an angular chorus straight out of the ""Hawaii 5-0"" theme. More often than not, Living in America trades melody and choruses for jumping octaves and rapid-fire synthesizer scales. Of course, sometimes that's exactly what the alcohol doctor prescribed. This music, like most of Sweden, is entirely dedicated to senseless and irresponsible fun. It was designed to be listened to and forgotten on the radio, not to be compiled as an album. Fully understanding the triteness of the following, I'm still compelled by Pitchfork's Hippocratic oath: While every song might not sound exactly the same, a good three-fifths do. I think the general arbitrary consensus is that if you're at that age where you just discovered pop music, go for it; this is exactly the type of album you should be constantly enjoying; if you're not going to Cub Scouts this summer, you really should have found something a little more sophisticated by now.","The word on the streets (and by this I mean the spieled sophistry coursing through press releases and talk shows ...

Make Out,The Rosebuds,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e69d034d5c69bf2cd4/1:1/w_160/5a55dbfb.jpg,2003-09-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6889-make-out/,Merge,"Following in the bold footsteps of Merge Records pioneer Mac McCaughan, The Rosebuds, Merge's latest riled-up, power-pop endeavor, are pounding out the same sort of elastic, hooky guitar rock that McCaughan himself once used to kick out with Superchunk. Culled directly from the Merge backyard (Raleigh, NC), The Rosebuds are an energetic three-piece (guitar, keyboards, drums) harboring a bold, arm-flailing rhythmic tendency that should earn them piles of favorable comparisons to contemporary dance-punks Hot Hot Heat and Radio 4. But it's The Rosebuds' full-on embrace of pop formula-- big, rousing choruses, twitchy keyboard bits, insistently bouncing drums-- that ultimately makes them such an addictive outfit. The Rosebuds' unquestioning approval of all things sweet and melodic is also what makes them bend, occasionally, a little bit twee: you won't find the slightest indication of a disdain-soaked smirk lurking beneath their canny synths and grinning vocals, and while that earnestness might seem unbearable on paper, it can be enormously engaging in action. Their debut, Make Out, incites the same kind of giggly, brainless exhilaration that goes along with actually making out-- and appropriately, it's only thirty-five minutes long. ""Kicks in the Schoolyard"" is an exuberant, Kinks-ish bash (at barely 2\xBD minutes, it also cuts out before anyone can ask too many questions) that sees Kelly Crisp's keyboards and Ivan Howard's guitar taking equal swipes at the melody, ably backing up Howard's full, sloping vocals. ""My Downtown Friends"" (aside from hosting the inarguable city-kid mantra ""we're going downtown/ Trying to get in for free"") offers more of the same feel-good, 50s-inspired pop, complete with a wailed ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" refrain. ""Drunkard's Worst Nightmare"" is a bit darker (although still far from nightmarish), with some distorted guitar soloing slipping in and out of a high, howled chorus. Overall, Make Out tends to skew slightly retro, but lovingly so-- the record's clean, straightforward keyboards and vigorous beats invoke the late 80s without making any grand, iconoclastic statements about what that nod might or might not mean. The band's at their best when they stick to glowing, enthusiastically up-tempo, guitar-led tracks. Some of the ballads here can seem unnecessarily gooey or unbearably repetitive (see ""Big Heartbreak"", ""The Make Out Song"")-- enough so that they may test the tolerance of even the most patient power-poppers. Mostly, though, Make Out is a quick, breathless somersault, all kicking feet and nodding heads, mouths wide open in dumb, singalong bliss.","Following in the bold footsteps of Merge Records pioneer Mac McCaughan, The Rosebuds, Merge's latest\n\ riled-up, power-pop endeavor ...

"Old World Underground, Where Are You Now",Metric,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43869fc7814a47cd820/1:1/w_160/809fa328.jpg,2003-09-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5547-old-world-underground-where-are-you-now/,Last GangEnjoy,"When your band is best known for sharing an apartment with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, there's clearly a lot of room for the development of a slightly more personal hype. Such is the case with Metric. Reportedly starting their band based on a mutual distaste for white Toronto funk bands, Metric melds together the usual suspects (The Cure, XTC, The Velvet Underground, New Order) for a new wave-tinged exploration of off-kilter indie rock. You may remember frontwoman Emily Haines from her work with Broken Social Scene and Stars. Here, she seldom attempts the kind of mesmerizing, super-hushed whispers of BSS's ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl"", instead showing off a nicely breathy sing/talk and a clear affinity for vocal fluctuations and cadence changes. The subject matter is even more varied than her vocal range: spanning topics as diverse as a friend's altered clothing aesthetic (""On a Slow Night""), to the importance of social status (""The List""), to the inquiry of whether it's ""wrong to want more than a folk song"" (""Wet Blanket""), Haines has an array of lyrical targets on display and she, more or less, handles the shooting range. One of the most stunning successes on Old World Underground, ""Succexy"" takes issue with the political agenda of the U.S. government from a more creative stance than the indie world's typical anti-Bush rhetoric and generalizations. Instead of placing the blame purely on the government, Haines claims, ""All we do is talk, sit, switch screens/ As the homeland plans enemies."" Slipping between power chords and her own serpentine synth lines, Haines juxtaposes sex and war without sounding lost in her own thoughts. Metric aren't overly adept from a technical standpoint, and their melodies sometimes feel a bit too simplistic, but, in attempting a mix between accessible dance-punk and new wave, they do deliver where it counts: their rhythm section is incredibly tight, and drummer Joules Scott-Key's delightfully funky meter is particularly notable. Still, the band rarely attempts anything out of the ordinary, and their lack of innovative arrangements often translates to a tendency for existing ideas to overstay their welcome. With Emily Haines' previous work as a frame of reference, you'd be right to assume that Metric does maintain an aura of talent, with the band serving as a hard melodic edge to her serene, plaintive vocal. Though still searching for their place in the ever-evolving world of indie rock, Metric, in their current incarnation, promise great things sooner rather than later.","When your band is best known for sharing an apartment with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, there's clearly a lot ...

5,Town and Country,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08db1335d7bf1698046/1:1/w_160/dd1a66b2.jpg,2003-09-23 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8123-5/,Thrill Jockey,"Few bands make music that attracts more indifference than this post-rock instrumental quartet, who five albums in (check the title) have yet to make the dramatic change in their style that would pull in new listeners. They aren't inept, amateurish or even exactly boring, but their parlor music takes a slow and emotionally neutral path that almost fights against engagement. The typical Town and Country piece moves as painfully as old people crossing the street. If you can't settle into it, you get frustrated thinking of all the things they don't do: they don't have the apocalyptic drama of the Constellation Records bands (e.g., Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, Set Fire to Flames), and they also steer clear of the sentimental heartstring-tugs and old-sepia-toned filmstrips of, say, Rachel's. Their long tones lack the primitive clarity of deep-listening music, and the arrangements pick up the subtlety and repetition of the minimalist composition, but they skip the rigor-- and rigidity-- of the academy for something more natural and less satisfying. To say they evoke Feldman, Reich or Messiaen is like saying the long-haired kid down the hall ""sounds like"" Jimi Hendrix. If nothing else, the album is beautiful. The arrangements may sound like staid chamber music, but the fact that it's the same four people swapping off between these instruments-- horns here, strings there, harmonium, guitar and some unrecognizable whistles or percussion-- gives the album some vigor. And you'll get plenty of time to contemplate the timbres of every instrument they use, because the pace is mostly laborious. ""Aubergine"" and ""Old Fashioned"" follow an introduction/tension/resolution arc, but the melodies roll out so, damn, slowly that the tracks feel too long even at five or ten minutes (respectively). When ""Lifestyled"" bursts in with a rattling, whistling flurry of action, it might finally grab your attention, but only for about half a minute, after which it settles into a shallow, meandering arrangement. But some of the album's other moments offer a more engaging approach. The opening track, ""Sleeping in the Midday Sun"", opens with sustained tones on strings and a horn, intense enough to leave a dent in your forehead before it segue to trance-like percussion led by a triangle. On ""Nonstop Dancer"", what could have been another rote stretch of ambling, by-numbers post-rock finds a center of gravity in long, droning sounds. And pulsing rhythms drive ""Shirtless"" into shifting patterns of percussion, sparking the record's most spontaneous playing. Though Town and Country are far from the first band to take this path, the drones and hypnotic percussion fit their mission: they're naturalistic, evenly paced, and not distractingly complicated. Instead of lulling you into simplicity, they excite you with it, focusing you into the buzzing center of their music. While there are plenty of bands doing better work with the same materials, Town and Country sound so committed in these moments-- so elated by what they're doing-- that you actually forget to want more from them.","Few bands make music that attracts more indifference than this post-rock instrumental quartet, who five albums in (check the title ...

Show Me Your Tears,Frank Black & the Catholics,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f15e6ef9596932052d/1:1/w_160/96daf7b6.jpg,2003-09-23 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/777-show-me-your-tears/,spinART,"Pixies! Do not reunite! Please! Think of all that you have to stay dead for: four legendary albums, ever-strong legions of adoring hero-worshippers, and maybe the single most firmly entrenched reputation in the history of alternative music! Just consider it... it doesn't need to end this way... But maybe it's no use; without even knowing for certain if the rumors of a supposed reunion will become a reality (the band and label have neither confirmed nor denied our inquiries), it's almost a truism in rock that matters of a band's sterling reputation inexorably descend to the lowest depths of the lowest common denominator. The worst part is that, with his latest misstep in the company of The Catholics, Show Me Your Tears, it's hard to think that lowest common denominator isn't Black Francis himself, sitting at the bottom of the barrel, waiting for the rest of the Pixies to finally arrive (Joey, as a member of The Catholics, would seem to be a shoo-in). It's bad enough that Frank Black can't seem to work hard enough these days to encourage what little confidence his name still instills in the hearts and minds of his few resolute followers; the Pixies shouldn't have to gently follow him into that good night, too. But there's no need to even bring the Pixies into the picture; the scene presented by reality-as-we-know-it is grim enough. Good ol' fashioned Catholic guilt ought to have set in on Black by now for coasting on the fumes of his reputation in the baffling quest to reach some bland ideal of jangly, Midwestern shit-rock, but no such luck. He's still belting out bar-ballads for the type of bars he and his peer group are old enough to frequent. And there's no end in sight, either; any songwriter of Black's caliber could churn out homogenized roots-riffs and schmaltzy sentiment to last call and beyond. Heed the keen insight he offers on ""Horrible Day"": ""It's a good day/ No, it's a horrible day/ And for the first time in my life I just don't care."" In the battle of Frank versus the bar, my money's on the bar, and Frank's is, too, evidently; the next round's on him. Now, it might be fair to suspect that I'm holding Frank to artistic standards that he never held for himself. First of all, even if that's true, why shouldn't we expect artists (in general) to perform to their demonstrated ability rather than sincerely offering up pieces of the comfortable little rut that they've been apathetically carving out over the past few years? If it was just a question of failing to live up to the Pixies, no one would need a review to predict the obvious, but it's so much worse than that; paling in comparison to the Pixies is expected (and it would be unrealistic to expect otherwise), but Tears isn't even a good Catholics album. The excellent first half of Pistolero-- particularly the dazzling crescendo of ""Western Star""-- is everything that the Catholics can and ought to be: rock as large, expansive, and over-romanticized (like right now) as the western skies hanging over the rural-route honky-tonk dives whose atmosphere they so readily evoke. Considering how little has changed in their dusty, trail-worn aesthetic between then and now, the listless songs on this album don't indicate maturation, or evolution of the band's sound, just lack of interest. Only ""Everything Is New"" offers any sort of highlight by (not without some irony) most readily harkening back to some of the pent-up energy and easy melody of earlier Catholics material. It's comparatively slight next to the blustery faux-rockers on Tears, and flatter than the cloying sentiment of the more somber tunes, but that's because it may be the only track that doesn't need to compensate for the simple desire that, in all other cases, just isn't there. The elegance of the melody is superbly understated; it doesn't seem like much at the time, but it does its work like any good pop song, and you may well be humming it long after the final coda. Even if there's little more to recommend, it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness. Still, it's the single, tiny bright spot on all of Show Me Your Tears, almost insignificant in the long twilight of Frank Black & The Catholics, and it's getting pretty dark down at the bottom of the barrel.

Talkin' Honky Blues,Buck 65,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42513d1975652138c49/1:1/w_160/051d0a25.jpg,2003-09-23 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1067-talkin-honky-blues/,Warner Bros.,"Buck 65 must like to make things difficult for himself. After developing a cult following in the underground with his Language Arts album series, some people may consider his second official record on Warner an attempt to discard his number and trade his U for an E. While Buck has somewhat forsaken his hip-hop roots for a more introspective, folk-rock approach, he still stands as the very same watcher, the jagged nomad with stories, lessons and morals to bestow. Once known for unfortunate album structure and ridiculously esoteric subject matter, Buck treats both cornerstones as old hat in the wake of a traditional 18-track-long observation of the facets of human nature. From a piercing portrayal of the aftermath of infidelity with his girlfriend (""Tired Out"") to a look at similarities to his father (""Roses and Bluejays"") to a tutorial on the classic art of shoe-shining (""Craftsmanship""), Buck 65 brings life out of all of his concepts, however simple. One of the better examples of Buck's newfound propensity for more personal written works is ""Sore"", whose every verse serves as a testimonial to the problems in Rich Terfry's existence: he smashes his unreliable car, masturbates in a hotel room, and struggles with loneliness. Though it strikes as an uncomfortable, off-kilter rhyme session, Buck's excellently descriptive writing style makes the track not only listenable but statements like ""phone don't work and God's at a staff meeting"" and ""I look at my photo albums and all I see is strangers"" also make it completely relatable. The most important facet of Buck's first truly commercial endeavor is the inclusion of a continual thematic series of songs revolving around a single river. Treating each track as a conceptual goldmine, Buck describes the setting, stops attempted suicides, drowns by accident, falls in love with a girl with aquatic qualities, and experiences the power of a gun in a riverside town. But the mind-blowing ""Riverbed 3"" creates a bevy of vivid characters, including ""the one-eyed cyclist who never wears any socks,"" a guy who ""wears two watches at one time"" and is ""not the best ventriloquist, but he wants to be,"" and ""Big fat Nigel who works as a florist,"" who is ""openly gay and he looks like a tourist."" Which all shines a light on Buck's greatest strength: character development. Much like he's moved away from the more common rap topical states, Buck 65 has stopped producing, in the most basic manner of speaking. Instead of simply mining for samples like he once did, he now works with a band called the Savant Guard (taking samples from their instruments) and a production team called The Entity. The style isn't far from what most Buck fans will be used to, but it does lend the overall sound of the project a more personal, organic touch. From the murkily reverbed space-bass puddle stomp of ""Leftfielder"", to the upright bass-backed dub bounce of ""Sore"", to the gorgeously folky acoustic guitar crisscross of ""Tired Out"", Buck 65 has left his sloppy underground production for a more mature, refined look at the art of beatmaking. The only downside to this vastly different project is the forced nature of his new persona. For an artist who started his career creating characters to rhyme under, he seems to have trouble adapting to his position of rappin' woodsman, even if it is closest to his real life. ""50 Gallon Drum"" comes off like Buck 65's overt self-portrait as the most eccentric emcee in the world, even if he told us this through his previous work without such a flamboyant representation. Saying that ""I like art made of garbage, a little pain is good for you"" and ""it's a shiny day and the dog shit smells like strawberries"" doesn't make me think ""what an interesting and weird recording artist""; It makes me think, ""How can you sound pretentious when trying to sound as earnest as possible?"" A few boring beats and some failed concepts crop up at points, but on the whole, Terfry has discovered a happy medium between folk and rap, turning his initial disdain for the lack of innovation in hip-hop into a more diverse sound. You won't find the Sketch Artist or The Centaur here, but this is the same Buck 65, just slightly more grounded in reality.","Buck 65 must like to make things difficult for himself.

Sure, convoluted meters, intricately layered guitar noise, and vintage synthesizers made of only fishing wire and toothpaste are nothing to scoff at. But the essence of spaz has little to do with the aesthetic goodies that so often adorn it. And at the core ""spazcore"" lies a mixture of energy and humor that, when done right, can be just ridiculously infectious. While countless forgotten bands have turned out generic garbage in hopes of hitting the big time and getting chicks, artists like Gary Wilson and Brainiac's Timmy Taylor seemed driven by an uncontrollable impulse to not look cool, tempered by a profound understanding of their own ridiculousness. When Need New Body dropped their insane, fractured and brilliant debut in 2001, it was abundantly clear that they deserved a place in this esteemed tradition. That album's centerpiece, the epic ""Gamble On/Banji"" was not only one of my favorite songs of 2001, but one of maybe ten songs ever that invariably inspires me to jump around like a total jackass, regardless of social setting. UFO, Need New Body's much anticipated sophomore effort, offers up both more variety and more focus than its predecessor, as the band plows through under-a-minute goofs and involved jams with equal conviction and care. As with their debut record, Need New Body hardly decided to put their most accessible foot forward with UFO, opting instead to open with the distorted drums and seemingly random noise patterns of ""Giggle Bush Meets CompUSA"". Just as the song disintegrates into hard-panned video game noises, in comes ""Hot Shot"", a standout track and a pretty good template for the more accessible side of the album. At their most basic level, these songs consist of the band playing a ""My Sharona"" bassline and banging on things, but what makes them so spectacular is the unchecked energy with which the band approaches them, fueled in no small part by Chris Powell's frenzied drumming. UFO is a remarkably dense record, but even more remarkable is the fact that every single sound is integrated so masterfully into the framework of Powell's insistent 4/4 beats. Need New Body achieve some of their greatest moments when the aforementioned beats are transformed into something loosely resembling a pop song. ""Show Me Your Heart"" is equal parts video game soundtrack, spy theme, and banjo-driven klezmer jam. Banjoist/emcee/""singer"" Jeff Bradbury may not be the most traditionally skilled vocalist, but he has a knack for rhythmic sing-speaking that perfectly complements the rest of the band. Bradbury's contribution to live favorite ""Pen"", with its unforgettable chorus of ""Pen pen pen/ Where's my pen,"" is not only hilarious, but lends the song yet another layer of rhythmic intensity. There will always be artists who go through the motions of ""freaking out"" in the hopes of soliciting a few extra cheers at shows, or injecting some energy into an otherwise painfully dull record. But Need New Body's enthusiasm, coupled with their adeptness at creating music both substantive and brilliantly eccentric, proves legitimate. Make no mistake, friends, this is the real thing.","When it comes to spazzing out, it pays to be mindful of the basics. Sure, convoluted meters, intricately layered guitar ...

Bicycles & Tricycles,The Orb,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f5eb335119a49ec8fa/1:1/w_160/8f5d500b.jpg,2003-09-22 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6027-bicycles-tricycles/,V2,"The human mind doesn't quite know what to do with The Orb anymore. Back in the early 90s, I think most of us expected The Orb to reign victorious in all the wars it would ever fight against or amongst electronic music's endless subgenres. Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and U.F. Orb were, after all, masterpieces suggestive of classic Pink Floyd and Eno. But, as with all great battles (Catholics and Protestants, North and South, Betamax and Sony), the Squares won out. Rather than ushering in a perpetually expanding and pulsating sphere of psycho-dub vacillations, time gave way to Plaid freeform, Autechrean architecture, and Squarepushing. So, upon first listen, Bicycles & Tricycles seemed instantly seductive with its harrowingly anachronistic synth washes, four-on-the-floor dub, quotes from those BBC Fairy Tale Hour shows, and the interstellar mind-freezes. However, on the third or fourth listen, I realized I didn't exactly like the songs as much as I liked the idea of someone making them. My relationship to The Orb is a lot like my relationship to Beyoncé or Willie Nelson. I don't know that I particularly like what they're doing, but I'm glad someone is doing it. The Orb seems to understand this. The first moments of ""From a Distance"" consist of the rooster from ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" struggling to avoid getting buried under distortion and destruction. A voice screams, ""A new morning!"" and proceeds to vitriolically spit out one of the most spellbindingly silly ragga teen-pop tunes to ever be so throttled with foghorns. It's a damn effective tactic, as startling as when De La Soul killed themselves or, hell, as Dylan going electric. Of course, it also borders on novelty, turning into one of those things you hear on British pop charts (Fast Food Rockers, anyone?) that makes you wonder, ""How is this place still a country?"" Whether it's actually any good or not, there's nothing else remotely like it on the album-- which we can be thankful for, because if the music of ""From a Distance"" was sustained for an hour, migraines would be as prevalent as original sin. The following track, ""The Land of Green Ginger"", is traditional Orb, rushing waves and audio excerpts from books-on-tape. Between tape loops and whittling, the drum machine sounds as if it's been buried in gravel. It's 80s techno to the point of self-delusion. ""Hell's Kitchen"" and ""Gee Strings"" are stunning Orb epics (basically what you would buy any Orb album for), flaunting vaguely Indian percussion that drips bongwater. If you've ever enjoyed an Orb song, there's no possible way you could be entirely disappointed by this album. It's resolutely affixed to the past, and while it's not nearly as liberal in its portions of psychedelic ambiance as their greatest works, it's at least par with Cydonia. I had a blast listening to it. I'll probably even listen to it after I finish writing this-- something I can hardly say about a lot of my favorite albums. But even when it's making raves out of paranoia, it feels like The Orb are trapped in a fading genre that gains its adherents through nostalgia rather than innovation. Long and painful deaths have never been this much fun.","The human mind doesn't quite know what to do with The Orb anymore. Back in the early 90s, I ...

Bravo,Sascha Funke,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7413d197565213b72b/1:1/w_160/5be53006.jpg,2003-09-22 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3270-bravo/,Bpitch Control,"When the recent wave of German electronic music gets its proper big-time compilation treatment, it will take a couple of Nuggets-style box sets to do it justice. From Mouse and Mars and Oval through today, German artists and German labels such as Basic Channel, Tresor, Force Tracks, Mille Plateaux, Morr Music, Studio !K7, Kompakt, Bpitch Control, Perlon, Shitkatapult, Poker Flat Recordings, and Playhouse, among many others, have produced an uncanny amount of excellent electronic music. On this fictional compilation, Sascha Funke would be well represented by his lovely, plangent ""Drei Auf Drei"", his cover of Bros' ""When Will I Be Famous"", and ""Now You Know"", the opening track on his debut album, Bravo. ""Now You Know"" is an almost improbably gorgeous track, a brittle, bittersweet tech-house beauty that sounds soul-enriching even as its enveloping layers of analog synth, arpeggiated guitar, and staccato beats are whittled down, peeled away like an onion until Funke's plangent, fragile voice is exposed. Previously released on the Funkt 12-inch, it's not only thankfully included here but-- along with the record's other previously released track, ""Forms and Shapes""-- sets its tone and works as its sonic blueprint. Much of the rest of the largely cohesive Bravo uses those two tracks as a jumping-off point. It splits the difference between Funke's two labels (Cologne's Kompakt and Berlin's Bpitch Control), taking the warmth of the former and the crisp, sharp beats of the latter, and oddly adding a large splash of borderline MOR sentimentality. Within this seemingly confining set of templates, Funke squeezes a surprising range of sounds, from the digital disco of vocal track ""Forms and Shapes"", to the almost Underworld-esque progressive house of the title track, to the quivering clicks of ""Soso"", a Notwist-like track that just begs for a Markus Acher vocal. When Funke veers into ambient pop-- as he does in much of the record's final third, starting with the self-explanatory ""Quiet Please""-- Bravo sometimes slides into more murky, less interesting territory, rescued only by the odd, minimalist charm of ""3 zu 1 fur die Liebe"" and percolating closer ""Hallo and Hurra"". But despite the occasional middling, soggy production, Bravo shows Funke deftly combining his yin and yang, creating an almost autumnal album full of brisk, soft numbers. How do you say ""sweater weather"" in German?","When the recent wave of German electronic music gets its proper big-time compilation treatment, it will take a couple of ...

NYC 1978,Ramones,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a208ea9e61561daa4936/1:1/w_160/31152a58.gif,2003-09-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6681-nyc-1978/,King Biscuit,"The Ramones' legacy tends to shift. Depending on whom you ask, they can be desperate Warhol-wannabes, punk rock heroes, meatheaded geniuses, fey performance artists, and the greatest American band of all time. But no matter where you finally land on the relative worth of the Ramones (or of New York punk in general) it's hard to argue that NYC 1978, the band's newly released, ""straight from the archives"" live recording, does anything less than showcase what the Ramones were truly great at: marrying the melodies and harmonies of early 60s power-pop with exuberant, metalhead ferocity, pounding out fast, lovable punk songs and making black leather jackets forever badass. NYC 1978 is the Ramones properly recalled, long before the half-hearted Lollapalooza tour and lifeless Adios Amigos, back when they were still teeming with wild, youth-at-play adrenaline. Because even though twenty-five years have passed since the Ramones recorded NYC 1978, they're still the best worst band ever. 2003: The dirty, shame-faced admission that seems to float, unspoken, between contemporary punkers is that all of the Ramones' songs sound (whisper now) pretty much the same. But while it's hard to wholeheartedly welcome the legions of blank-faced, black-jeaned followers who have since embraced the band's, um, pithy songwriting philosophy, there's still something awfully charming about the Ramones' particular brand of redundancy-- mostly because the Ramones themselves don't seem so in on the joke. NYC 1978 crams 27 three-chord songs into 52 minutes (no freewheeling guitar solos, no guest players, and not a whole lot of witty rambling), the band all the while remaining seemingly unaware of a pacing that sounds, at least to 21st century ears, entirely absurd. To amplify the inherent preposterousness of NYC 1978, check what they don't tell you on the cover: It was recorded on January 7th, 1978, exactly seven days after the 1977-78 New Years' Eve show in London that later became the Ramones' other seminal live release, It's Alive. The real kick in the pants is that the tracklists for the two records are almost identical, save the one additional cut which sneaked onto It's Alive (the probable ""Judy Is a Punk""-- which, incidentally, is not so thematically different from ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"" or ""Suzy Is a Headbanger""). Both albums plow through what are arguably the Ramones' greatest hits (showcasing some of their last work with Tommy on drums), culled from their first three history-booked records, 1976's Ramones and 1977's Leave Home and Rocket to Russia. You know what to expect: the fist-pumping twist of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"", the dumb, sing-along fun of ""Rockaway Beach"", loads of simple, thrilling guitar crushes, and Dee Dee hollering as many 1-2-3-4 countdowns as he can choke out. If you already own It's Alive (and you should), know that NYC 1978 is exactly the same songs, played in the same way, in the same order, by the same four people. Completists could point out some quibbles (Johnny's guitar seems to wander out of tune far more often on NYC than it did on It's Alive, and It's Alive was mixed by Tommy Ramone himself, whereas the comparably anonymous Glen Robinson mans the boards here), but the Ramones weren't exactly renowned for unforeseen live explosions, and for the most part, the only palpable difference between these two shows are their respective locales. But when the location in question is the pre-gentrification east side (the Palladium on 14th Street), and the band is the Ramones, setting suddenly becomes a lot more relevant than you'd think. The effects are subtle, and mostly peripheral-- the deepness of the hollers, the frenzy of the applause, the slightly nervous, beginning-of-the-end toe-tapping. So even if NYC 1978 ends up being one of the least essential Ramones releases of recent years, it still deserves credit for placing the band back in the belly of the only city that could have ever spawned them.","The Ramones' legacy tends to shift.

Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,OutKast,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba339d034d5c69bf53e9/1:1/w_160/0b1d39d8.jpeg,2003-09-22 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/,Arista,"The twelve-lane Connector plows through Atlanta like the Nile of pavement. Along its fenced banks lie the majority of the city's attractions. Turner buildings, blossoming with neon network logos, lure Yellowjacket grads from the adjacent campus cluster with the sweet nectar of Powerpuff Girls money. Across the way, The Varsity serves grease between buns, communicating with an enigmatic fast food lexicon that rivals rhyming Cockneys. Tourists walk the overpass to the ghostly Olympic park, built on the graveyard of Techwood projects, in the shadows of Vick's pastel dome. Hipsters and reluctant yuppies settle in the gentrified Five Points and Cabbagetown, giving their quaint subdivisions more verdant ""___________ Park"" monikers. And finally, there's Turner Field, reverberating collective October sighs, before the highway splits back into its tributaries in East Point, the cultural fountainhead. The hip-hop id to New York's ego: the home of Outkast. Lauded retroactively in 2000, upon the release of Stankonia, for a formula that had been perfected by teenagers on 1994's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Outkast charged up the public with silly amounts of reserved anticipation for this double-disc marathon. Since dropping that debut nearly ten years ago, Outkast's singles have charted a steady incline of genre-defiance and pop virtuosity. But now, in the wake of the commercial and critical smash that yielded such classic tracks as ""Ms. Jackson"", ""B.O.B."", and ""So Fresh, So Clean"", Big Boi and Andre 3000 have, for the first time, chosen to work in separate corners, like Beatles after India. Here, on the resulting Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, the two wander down the blacktop from East Point, each plotting their own distinct course: Andre, like I-85, shoots off to the airport and sky-high trips before dipping into the Mardi Gras marshes of New Orleans, while Big Boi rolls deep down I-75 into south Florida, home of booty bass and baby blue. The consensus in rock circles had unfairly anticipated that The Love Below would reign supreme over Big Boi's Speakerboxxx, since Andre was the one with the guitar in the fuzzy boots. As it turns out, his Prince-mimicking fusion looks a lot better on paper than it sounds in your ears. On too many songs, Andre repeats space-playboy choruses over repetitious, unfinished digifunk. As the brief orchestrated outro to ""Pink and Blue"" suggests, each track feels like it's missing something-- strings, guitars, harmonies, organic instruments, and, oh right: Big Boi. Andre does have his moment, though: ""Hey Ya!"" glitters and towers like the silver Westin hotel over an 80s Atlanta skyline, blending Flaming Lips-like synth-bass and ebullient acoustic guitar with the rebellious joy of ""Little Red Corvette""-- and like all classic songs, it introduces new vernacular with a genius that transcends product placement. Even indymedia.org feeders will shout ""Polaroid!"" while miming spanking at this fall's Not-Dog cookouts. Of the few other tracks on The Love Below that come close to reaching ""Hey Ya!""'s apex, the one that most succeeds is ""Spread"", which showcases trumpets and piano weaving through a rubber bassline and scattering rimshots. Its chorus has Andre putting on his Camille voice, while the verses contain some of the only moments on the album in which he actually flows. When he does, he's tight enough to pose the question of why he decided to cut back on rapping at all-- particularly since, frankly, he ranks just above Pharrell Williams on the ""brilliant but mosquito-throated crooner"" list. Elsewhere, the quite literal ""Dracula's Wedding"" boasts guest vocalist Kelis over whistling squelches, while Norah Jones' lovely turn on the acoustic ""Take Off Your Cool"" hints at the true stylistic breadth Andre is capable of achieving. ""Baby, take off your cool/ I want to get to know you,"" they both sing over plucks and strums. Heed your lyrics, Andre. (Except for that ""become the master of your own bastion"" nonsense.) Big Boi's Speakerboxxx coolly upstages its counterpart: Although it, too, provides the world with one earthshaking single, it differs from The Love Below in that it also manages to maintain a consistent level of brilliance and emotional complexity. Here, Big Boi effectively asserts himself as man who wants both a stripper pole in his home and his nostalgic place saved on the pew-- ""Unhappy"" conveys that in its beat alone! Comparing the selection of Speakerboxxx to Andre's limper Love Below, it's clear who won this bet: Machine-heavy, horn-driven funk stomps behind ""Bowtie"" and ""The Rooster""; reverberating woodblocks (a trademark Outkast signifier since ""Elevators"") starkly soundtrack pondering rhymes on ""Knowing""; ""Church"" takes gospel into the 21st Century, accelerating aluminum Stevie Wonder disco-pop into Teutonic techno; propulsive kickdrums pump under drunken guitars, scratches, and a Jay-Z hook on the standout ""Flip Flop Rock""; and ""Ghettomusick"", the aforementioned earthshaking single, is, emotionally, a celebration and a lament, braggadocio and beatitudes. Musically, the record shifts from punk-cadenced, cellulite-quivering woofer booms to three-wheeled slow-jams and back before snake-charming with George Clinton keyboards. Of course, there's one department in which neither disc succeeds: Despite how forward-looking these albums can be, both members have failed to envision a future without skits and intros, which make up no less than ten of the 39 tracks here. It's one reason why Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, like no albums before, beg to be ripped, sieved and re-sequenced. Cutting out the dialog, along with The Love Below's silicon-smooth, Rainbow Children-esque jazz and lulling middle-section, and Big Boi's guest-laden, been-there street tracks, leaves one genius full-length that fits on a single disc.","The twelve-lane Connector plows through Atlanta like the Nile of pavement.

The Magic Lantern,George,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfdf13d197565213b960/1:1/w_160/d2a55285.gif,2003-09-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3620-the-magic-lantern/,Pickled Egg,"I don't know if it happened recently or if it's been a gradual slide, but ambience and mood in music mean something different today than they once did. Think of singers like Nina Simone, Roberta Flack or Joni Mitchell; their music had a way of seducing you, of lulling you into a world that would not otherwise be accessible. And though it's no more difficult to locate soothing, evocative music today, musicians willing to approach that kind of nurturing grace are few and far between. I guess it's not a coincidence that I chose three female artists as examples, though this rather maternal attribute in music isn't exclusively feminine-- Brian Wilson, particularly in ballads like ""In My Room"" or ""(Don't Talk) Put Your Head on My Shoulder"", had an incredible ability to tap into this realm, as did Nick Drake. But there's a very thin line between a mature approach to this virtue and a twee one-- just ask Björk, Belle & Sebastian, or Múm. And when you're done with them, prepare a few questions for Manchester duo George, as they'll surely have something to say on the subject as well. In the mid-90s, Suzy Mangion and Michael Varity were high school friends looking for a way to capitalize on their shared music collections and various instruments; their first release as George was a 1998 seven-inch titled ""The Summer of Stars"". These days, the pair specialize in nocturnal folk that isn't far from the rustic eccentricities of Richard Youngs, though it possesses a much sweeter sense of melody (i.e., this isn't drone). Mangion has a tender, expressive voice that reminds me of a young Joni Mitchell, though also of a calmer, older Kate Bush. She lent her voice to Piano Magic's ""It's the Same Dream That Lasts All Night"" from 2001's Writers Without Homes, an album that almost perfectly exposed the difficulty in making mood music that didn't drift away upon the second listen. Where many new folk groups are content to let spacy atmospherics do most of their work for them, George's songs come from a sturdier place, as if they'd missed out on the last 20 years and instead took all their lessons from Leonard Cohen and the slow songs from White Album Beatles. The Magic Lantern is George's debut full-length, and should appeal to most people down with the references already made. It's lo-fi in places, and modestly experimental with plenty of interesting textures (the duo prefer an array of homemade electronics, analog synthesizers and archaic drum machines to software and laptops), but remains consistently, comfortably warm. Mangion sings like the soloist in a country church: clear and optimistic, without any obviously borrowed nuance, and her quivering vibrato fills up the mix when doubled or tripled in harmony. Multi-instrumentalist Varity also sings, but usually only in harmony, and employs a much less distinctive baritone when he does take the lead, as on the slightly off ""The Song the Lonely Heart Remembers"". Opening with the brief ""Title Song"", featuring Mangion's deep harmony vocals over an old upright piano, and leading into the porch-lit shuffle of ""Sacramento"", The Magic Lantern wastes little time establishing George's way with a mood. Mangion's lilting phrases in ""Sacramento"" sound like they should be coming from a particularly wistful Southern belle, embracing newfound fortune in the West while waving goodbye to an innocence already left behind. ""Alone in the Country Heart"" uses the huff and puff of a train engine as its rhythmic base, kept low behind the murmur of Mangion's vocal. As she laments the protagonist ""standing on the motorway, painting small clouds, counting all the cities,"" the song moves from minor to major and her melody hovers on one note, the engine underneath pressing onward. When a small string ensemble enters later, what should be a jarring juxtaposition reveals itself as a remarkably poignant moment. Distant, pagan impressions color much of The Magic Lantern, largely assisted by George's preference for acoustic arrangements and balladry that might well have been performed 100 years ago, unchanged. ""The Track Through the Woods"" is a brooding, insistent torch song, also taking full advantage of the major/minor shifts in tone. The plodding, muffled percussion provides what little support Mangion and Varity need to read through one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've heard in a while. ""Bandstand"" drones on via antiquated church organ pedals and synth patches that haven't been heard outside of Wümme, Germany in 30 years. Varity's harmony vocals might as well be another layer of synthesizers, such is the thick, surreal orchestra of reverb. ""Slow Wave Sleep"" takes this idea further, blurring out any details you might have noticed had you been conscious at the time. Mangion's vocals (""all is fine, all is well, and all can stay there for all I care, for all I care for is you"") sound piped in from another world entirely, as a Pet Sounds-esque hymnal organ creeps up behind. The Magic Lantern isn't the kind of record you drop on someone in the afternoon out of the blue. Truthfully, it drags in spots, and will certainly be ignored by anyone not in for some of that old graceful, nurturing spirit. Still, it's hard to imagine many people hard enough that at least some of this wouldn't sink in under their armor. In a time when music, downloads and the half-life of the average folk-pop group are short as a matter of practice, George are a pleasant, optimistic reminder of home.

Ode to Joy,The Deadly Snakes,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb50ea9e61561daa71ec/1:1/w_160/accc06a6.jpg,2003-09-21 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2519-ode-to-joy/,In the Red,"Threading together occasionally disparate bits of 60s rock, garage, early punk, roots/bluegrass, Stax soul, and Southern gospel, Toronto's Deadly Snakes have obviously spent the last few years scrounging around for more than just a ballsy album title. The band's classics-bin pinching has led to some magnificent ends: on Ode to Joy, the Snakes' third release, they've broken down and reassembled a century's worth of musical output, and miraculously, emerged with something that sounds entirely, heartbreakingly relevant. With all its wailing horns, weed-tinged organs, slammed guitars and throwdown vocals, Ode to Joy is, in a lot of ways, exactly what makes the 21st century such a potentially great time for rock music. It's a record that confirms, without getting excessively contemplative or buzzkill-cerebral, that synthesizing all the tunes and styles contemporary artists have at their disposal can actually be an inspired endeavor-- especially when you incorporate a hearty shot of ingenuity and some kicky Canuck spunk. Still, influence/inspiration theories aside, it would be unfair not to acknowledge that there's a little bit of love buried in here, too. Because ultimately, it's the Snakes' earnest (and somehow palpable) appreciation for the work of their forefathers that makes Ode to Joy's overstated lineage so tolerable. Just imagine six kids getting so sincerely riled up about their respective record collections that they were left with no choice but to join forces and actually follow through on the wild, heart-in-throat urges we've all had to just squish every record worth loving into one big, satisfying ball of sound. And then to run around as fast as possible, clutching that craggy conglomeration tightly to our chests, breathing hard. And then to name that thing Ode to Joy. But before you get too misty-eyed, remember that Ode to Joy is also an explosive, knee-bending kick in the pants, and that the record comes with its fair share of fiendish snickering and behind-your-back finger-pointing. The Snakes' wide-ranging influences might make Ode to Joy stylistically unpredictable, but it's far from disjointed; rather, the record follows its own kind of in-joke logic, and, expectedly, the Snakes' private schematic includes a healthy dose of impish rollick. Happily, Ode to Joy has the sort of mischievous swagger that, unlike some of the band's ""garage rock revival"" peers, is a little bit off-balance, far more playful than patronizing. And it's that roguish spirit that unites these tracks into a glorious whole. Appropriately, there's no awkward throat clearing-- Ode to Joy blows right open on ""Closed Casket"", a loud, freewheeling assault that sees vocalist Andre Ethier bravely slamming down words and grunts with a seething, bang-it-out syntax that captures, almost perfectly, Dylan's thick ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" ramble. It's a curious choice for an opener, because Ethier sounds so stupidly similar to Dylan that, inevitably, some people are just gonna snicker, roll their eyes and walk away-- unless, of course, they've already been sold by the boisterous bluster of his five able bandmates, who crank out rowdy, foot-stomping drum beats (the impressive Andrew Gunn behind the kit), jangly piano lines, and rough, garage-punk guitar riffs. Another highlight, ""Oh My Bride"" sees that same spirit applied to an otherwise traditional gospel cut, with only guitar, handclaps, and some soulful, listen-up hollering, while ""Burn Down the Valley"" uses the Snakes' fervor to harness the creepier side of an organ, mixing dark, rolling lines with back and forth vocals, spreading it all out over a bass-heavy, nightmarish stew. The Deadly Snakes are that rarest of bands whose approach to rock 'n' roll is not only fierce and dynamic, but also fueled by an insatiable passion, and yet Ode to Joy has been criminally overlooked for most of the spring and summer-- mostly for lack of a solid publicity team. But records like Ode to Joy can't be held back, and lately, there's been a rumble underground. Right now, it's seeming increasingly unlikely that it could go unnoticed any longer-- it's just that good.","Threading together occasionally disparate bits of 60s rock, garage, early punk, roots/bluegrass, Stax soul, and Southern gospel, Toronto's ...

The singular consumption of a mouthful sized arrangement of food composed exclusively of each distinct, fundamental ingredient of a select recipe. As in, mid-meal (directly after each curious female at my table abruptly loses interest in her own selection), from my Cobb Salad; a leaf each of iceberg and romaine lettuce, a piece each of bacon and chicken, a diced tomato cube, a bit off egg, a single scallion, a crumb of Roquefort cheese, and just a touch of dressing. Now, I don't want to incite a debate on gender scripting, but it's been my experience that girls happen to love the perfect bite. My sister loves the perfect bite. Swears by it. I hate the perfect bite. It obviates randomness and strangles variety. Also, it ruins my meal. This three-song offering is Azure Ray's perfect bite, the shortest and most accurate response to the question: What do they sound like? Omaha-by-way-of-Athens duo Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor again hit the studio with Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers, Archers of Loaf) as producer, in efforts towards their upcoming full-length Hold on Love, which promises a slightly new recipe for their sound. For the EP, however, we're treated to more of the intimate, downtempo, serene moments the ladies have wrought since inception. ""The Drinks We Drank Last Night"" is pulled directly from the new album, and could certainly find a home on last year's Burn & Shiver. The formula remains true to the original blueprint of the duo's sound. Slowly undulating and understated ambience coupled with signature gentle acoustic picking set in before quietly retreating below the effortless hush of the duo's vocals. With the flawless production at hand the vocals take on an even more tranquil quality than previous offerings, just begging to grace a pair of headphones. In fact, the subtle variations in vocal renderings between the three songs are the only true variants within the album, which follows logically given no-one has any misconceptions about where Azure Ray's bread is buttered. ""The Love of Two"", the only non-album track, is the most atmospheric, as well as most memorable. An incessant vinyl scratch murmurs beneath a subtle vocal tonality reminiscent of Mazzy Star, which, distant and haunted, provides an excellent equipoise to the visceral production. A ""Bleed Version"" of the album-inclusive ""We Are Mice"" rounds out the disc with sparse piano backing and choral vocals that I swear could only be described as uncannily Sarah McLachlan-esque. There are no true departures to be found, merely minor tweaking. Unfortunately, the lyrics still read a bit much like Felicity's diary, but such a regrettable lyrical acumen can easily be overlooked; this music is tactile at heart. If the duo can simply up the cerebral factor and maybe add a little spice to the mix, a real statement could be served up.","the perfect bite. n. 1.

With the Tides,South,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e813d1975652138e12/1:1/w_160/1d8d3990.jpg,2003-09-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7380-with-the-tides/,Kinetic,"Britpop and I go way back. I remember the summer our love first bloomed, when a gaggle of UK melody slingers and guitar tinkerers saved me from the drooping cul de sac of my classic rock phase. I'd been ensconced in false notions of the categorical inferiority of new music for years, but just before I sank low enough to actually purchase a Black Oak Arkansas album, I unexpectedly became exposed to Pulp, Radiohead, and The Stone Roses, and I emerged changed, open to just about anything new. For a few years, the filters were off-- anything that had even the faintest ring of Britpop to it was devoured regardless of its quality, until Britpop became a cul de sac itself. Looking back, I'm not sure how a band like Menswe@r didn't send the hazard lights blinking, but needless to say, distance provides objectivity, and I'm to the point where an album's mere Britishness is hardly enough for it to win me over. I mention all this because With the Tides, the sophomore offering from UK trio South, is exactly the kind of album I would have blindly adored just a few years ago. Not that I've necessarily wizened with age, but I'm certainly more cynical, and it's about time we got around to admitting that it's every music fan's right to be jaded. South make what you could probably get away with labeling ""post-Britpop."" The elements are pretty much the same-- strong, tenor-sung melodies, ringing guitars, and concise songwriting-- but they're also tossed with a salad of keyboard-based textures and electronic flourishes befitting a post-IDM world. Mo'Wax labelhead James Lavelle produced this band's 2001 debut, From Here on In, but that album was unfortunately a bit of a blur, with only a song or two that could be counted as highlights. This time out, the band hooks up with Dave Eringa, generally a Rock Guy responsible for the boardwork for such notables as Manic Street Preachers, Idlewild, and Ash (not to mention Kylie Minogue), and it shows immediately. The textural elements that defined their debut, while still omnipresent, are toned back a bit to let Jamie McDonald's sturdy vocals have the spotlight, and the drums are punchy as hell. But is it enough? Sort of. When South bring their best songs to the table, it bangs, but there are still a few lines of featureless grout in between the colorful tiles. They hit biggest out of the gate, as opener ""Motiveless Crime"" is a rush of are-they-strings-or-keyboards atmospherics, driving rhythm and well-baited hooks. The heart of the album's sequencing is productive, too, with its three most diverse tracks coming in quick succession. ""Fragile Day"" opens as a bobbing hymn, soaked in drifting ambience, slowly building on a skeletal beat, finally climaxing with a harmony-soaked chorus and a pummeling epilogue that nicely sets up ""Nine Lives"", a quiet song from a darkened room supported almost solely by cello and harp (and lots of reverb). ""Same Old Story"" rebounds with an insistent bassline, spry drumming and the same ascendant guitars that put the glow in Doves' Lost Souls. At its height, Britpop produced an enormous crop of great sprinters, but only a couple of true long-distance runners, and South certainly fall into the former camp, able to drop a great song seemingly at will, but struggling to maintain variety and consistency. About the boldest thing that South could do at this point to help diversify their albums would be to step out from behind the blanket of texture they've wrapped themselves in, and simply let their craft work for itself. While that seems unlikely, what South has now is slowly coming into sharper focus, and though it's no masterpiece, With the Tides is certainly a good record. At the very least it should ease your Britpop jones better than Menswe@r.","Britpop and I go way back. I remember the summer our love first bloomed, when a gaggle of UK melody ...

Yoko,Beulah,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28eb1335d7bf16984fc/1:1/w_160/bd9fb123.jpg,2003-09-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/677-yoko/,Velocette,"You try to be a good person, you really do. You have a vision. You're not like everyone else, no; you always follow through, you go the extra mile, you tip the extra dollar. You have goals. You have pride. You analyze, plan, and apply. You have faith. You stick to your guns and never let words hurt you. You're an excellent listener and you can always keep a secret. Nothing can touch you. Hell, you've pretty much got it all figured out. And then one day, out of the blue, a switch is flipped; life hands you your ass and you discover you're just as vulnerable and incompetent as the guy who used to live above you who ate cigarettes at every meal and twice trapped and tried to ransom a neighborhood dog for rent money. Why? Because even if you live in a bubble reciting Bible verses, wearing a Kevlar vest and an oxygen mask inside a bomb shelter beneath the Pentagon, there's still something to which you'll never be immune: man's inherent fallibility. The moment Eve handed Adam that apple we were screwed. Now all it takes is a little push and we're on our way, no matter how straight a line we walk. We're all born into paradise (some of us stay longer than others), and whether the process is gradual or instantaneous, change is imminent. Nothing lasts forever. With Yoko, change has come, and come swiftly, for better and for worse. Thus, with final product in hand and half an apple missing, the question presents itself: So what's her name? Perhaps I'd be better served asking the question again in the plural, as nearly every member of Beulah is said to have parted ways with wives or long-time girlfriends since the recording of their last album (including the third of the group involved in a lineup change), but the query is nonetheless justified. Since 1997, over the course of three albums, Beulah have unabashedly offered up a congruous library of sunny, debonair guitar-pop. Employing trademark sanguine arrangements of horns, strings and woodwinds, the tone was at best ironic, sometimes paradoxically sentimental, but always uplifting, impulsive and fresh-faced. No more. Yoko is a wash of sentiment, desire, and emotional fragility, and it's the first determined step outside of the band's garden of lush, fertile pop-craftsmanship. Look no further than to the barren, minimalist cover work, where previously there existed nods to serene, natural elements. Check the album title. Acronym for the third track (""You're Only King Once"") or not, gender relations are suspect. To be fair, I'd be remiss not to admit a share of artistic reinvention into the mix, but Yoko represents a shift in consciousness that so enticingly mirrors post-Lapsarian change, it's impossible to resist. To begin, the songs exude a newly developed arresting self-consciousness. Everything is tentative and intricately wrought, perhaps in an overly accommodating response to fears of linearity. This fashionable awareness lends an almost palpable weight to the sound. It succeeds in adding depth and texture to the album, but sometimes overshoots the mark. With a clichéd garage-rock dynamic at its heart, ""My Side of the City"" caters directly to the Spoon-fed rock chic, while ""Landslide Baby"" exhibits a lack of restraint with its misplaced bridge delivery of ""'Cause you're scared and you're weak and you don't give a fuck about me/ And I do believe that you hate yourself."" Essentially, Beulah just try too hard and lack moderation in their extremes. Nearly every song feels like the band is carefully exercising a right of indulgence. Lyrically, Yoko is permeated with cynicism, a telltale sign of mortality. Emotionally, currents of romantic melancholy and cynical disenchantment run throughout. Lead singer Miles Kurosky yearns and languishes, implores and informs. ""Standing alone at the gate/ She's late/ She's miles above,"" from ""Hovering"", and similar revelations, pepper the album with a pleading despondency-- but one that's executed without any sense of spontaneity. ""Fooled with the Wrong Guy"" draws the connection between maudlin and mandolin, but misses the mark by turns too Travis and is bogged down with excess lethargy. It's one of several moments where Beulah actually mope. Some songs, however, run the gauntlet and emerge with more character and confidence. ""A Man Like Me"", the opening cut, initially sounds like a sullen, purebred Spoon/Beulah alloy, as do a teeming handful of moments here, with Kurosky taking on a more moody, jaded vocal approach before choppy guitar cuts in over spacious keys and indie-thrift bass. From there, the song jumps up and down, restless and unwieldy, showcasing one of the album's finest melodies and succeeding despite such a calculated dynamic. A hefty portion of Yoko's fortunes could rightfully be attributed to the flawless production. Without horns and hoards of background melody, a few songs are given room to wander within the sonic landscape. Intro and outro arrangements a la Yankee Hotel Foxtrot permeate the record, adding texture. Especially representative of this is the closing track, ""Wipe Those Prints and Run"", which teases, taunts, and stands its ground where previous Beulah tracks would officiously cater to the listener. The new textures serve the band's sound accordingly, and enable them to explore new compositional directions while retaining a degree of continuity earlier albums missed. The band navigates a maze of intent amidst this freedom of motion, and for at least a moment in each song, they stumble onto something enlightening-- something familiar, something classifiably Beulah. Mortally self-conscious, repentant and quixotic, Yoko has a vision. Instead of a full-out rollicking, springy affair, they offer a sinusoidal ride through sentiment-- their first. At its heart, this record is a statement of regret with a bleak view of redemption, but its grand tone hints at something more universal, and opens up an endless landscape of possibility. Sometimes change is good-- that is, so long as it's still open to change.","You try to be a good person, you really do. You have a vision. You're not like everyone else ...

Alcachofa,Villalobos,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98013d1975652139894/1:1/w_160/88fd8265.jpg,2003-09-18 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8506-alcachofa/,Playhouse,"For most of the first 45 seconds of Chilean producer Ricardo Villalobos' debut album Alcachofa the only sound is provided by a vocodered voice. But rather than using that device to turn man into the sheen of a playful disco machine, Villalobos' treated vocal on opener ""Easy Lee"" is murky, weighted down by reverb and doubt. It frequently trails off at the end of words and sentences. It's exhausted. And when the thump and snap of light 4/4 rhythms accompany it, it sounds even more submerged, as if it's trying to keep its head above water. Villalobos approaches the admittedly wide and increasingly nebulous net of tech-house as if 2002 never happened-- no The Present Lover, no All That Glitters, no Digital Disco, no Total 4. That's certainly not bad, it's just another tangent for this ever-pulsating sound. The odd thing is that even without getting in touch with his inner pop child, Villalobos has landed in the same general area as the Tied to the 80s retro futurists: a delicate mix of nuance and melody. It's sort of the morning-after-- or possibly the walk home from the club, the how soon is now?-- to all of those of shiny, hands-aloft nights out. And Villalobos isn't the only producer taking this route. It's also one traveled by Luciano and the suddenly prolific Matthew Dear, whose Ghostly International releases-- EP1 and EP2, and his upcoming Leave Luck to Heaven album-- all demonstrate a similar approach to tech-house. The roots of the Villalobos' music-- which can also be found on his own outstanding mix albums Love Family Trax and Taka Take, Perlon's Superlongevity compilation, and a series of 12-inch releases under his own name and as half of Ric y Martin-- lie in the Kompakt label's ambient beginnings and Basic Channel and the rest of the minimalist Berlin crowd. Like the Berliners, he wades through gurgling, delicate pools of dubby bliss. His mix of groove and nuance seems somehow warm and cold at the same time, a very human expression of somber emotions. Its bittersweet tone is compounded by a blend of the familiar (the self-deprecating vocals almost direct house of ""What You Say is More Than I Can Say"", the late-night speedway of ""Y.G.H."") and the unexpected (""Waiworinao""'s chugging guitar, the polyrhythmic ""Fools Garden (Black Conga)""). One setback is that the set misses perhaps his most beloved track, ""808 the Bassqueen"", although that may not have matched the record's tone. What is recycled from previous releases includes ""Dexter"", lifted from Taka Taka, and the aforementioned ""What You Say is More Than I Can Say"", which appears here as an edited version of the track, originally released on the Halma 12-inch. One of the few vocal tracks, the me-against-the-world of ""I Try to Live (Can I Live)"", perhaps best illustrates the hesitancy, doubt, and weariness that drifts through Alcachofa. There and elsewhere throughout the record, Villalobos seems to be seeking comfort and finding it in small moments, in the nooks and crannies of the sound rather the more traditional heart-pumping moments explored by many tech-house producers over the past year or so. Instead, at Alcachofa's heart beats a more steady rhythm, pumping out fragile melodies painted with small yet precise brushstrokes.","For most of the first 45 seconds of Chilean producer Ricardo Villalobos' debut album Alcachofa the only sound is provided ...

A Lil' Light,Dudley Perkins,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a166b1335d7bf169824f/1:1/w_160/6ce23e8c.jpg,2003-09-18 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6525-a-lil-light/,Stones Throw,"With all due respect to both parties, Dudley Perkins is a poor man's Wesley Willis. The latter-- God bless his soul-- achieved cult status in the rock world with his sometimes disturbing, always ridiculous lyrics over the strict musical formula of three verses, a chorus, and a painfully long pre-programmed Casio keyboard loop ""solo"" before the third verse. One only imagines how many freshmen dorm rooms in America have been sent into late-night hysterics when twenty or thirty Pabst-nursing Napster newbies crowded around a buddy's Pentium II to hear Willis' glorious tales about the Hell City bus and a llama's whooped ass. As anyone will report, for about two weeks-- the average time most people willingly subject themselves to Willis' music-- it's just glorious, shit-in-pants excitement. Dudley Perkins, when not casting himself as ho-hum mid-90s rapper Declaime, is quickly becoming the 300-hundred-pound black schizophrenic rambling novelty of the rhythm-and-blues world. Perkins has his own formula: generally speaking, a two-chord jazzy vamp fronted by poorly sung two-line epigrams, repeated ad nauseam. It's a formula that first manifested itself in the form of the heavily blunted ""Flowers"", which came out of some studio tinkering between Perkins and the increasingly prominent producer Madlib. ""Flowers"" caught the ear of Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf, who quickly released it as its own seven-inch, and then included the track on his Jukebox 45s compilation. ""Flowers"" was cute and inconsequential, and Perkins' lazy delivery-- to the point that he had only a few phrases he'd repeat-- merited its small release. After one track, though, Perkins' formula wears out its welcome. Here, Wesley Willis proves superior: he had a formula, but at the very least his lyrics were different with each verse, and, because he isolated his keyboard solo, one could always skip over it and get to his final verse. Perkins' voice, on the other hand, is the irritating keyboard solo of his own songs, and, because he sings throughout, one can't skip over them-- as if there were anything interesting to get to in the first place. Perkins' lyrics are painfully insipid, and given the tone of his delivery, curiously more self-important than they ought to be. It's pointless to discuss these tracks individually-- with the words changed, they're practically the same: Perkins trying to be sincere about the most hackneyed R&B; stock. The project itself is undoubtedly tongue-in-cheek, but that doesn't stop the majority of these tracks from being outright atrocious. ""Momma"" has Perkins praising his mother with vomit-worthy repetitions of ""it was you who gave me life""; ""The Light"" has Perkins explaining that he ""knows why [his] soul burns-- and yearns-- for knowledge""; Perkins tell us in ""Yo' Soul"" that ""you can feel it in yo' body, you can feel it in yo' soul"", but never actually says what ""it"" is. If Perkins' debut had simply failed at an honest attempt to create something worthwhile, it would be one thing. But A Lil' Light actually ruins otherwise solid tracks all but intentionally. In a sense, A Lil' Light could be seen as two competing albums: Perkins' vapid mockery of the genre, and Madlib's breathtaking instrumentals. Occasionally Madlib's beats are enough to propel the tracks out of Perkins' vacuity: beyond the short but engaging Yesterday's New Quintet breaks, ""Money"", the album's single, sports an addictive, rubbery bassline; ""Just Think"" proves how masterfully Madlib can baste mid-90s style rhythms with a subtle 60s jazz flavor; ""Falling"", perhaps not the song most indicative of the album's sound but by far its standout track, boasts brilliant string and bell samplings behind Perkins' inane spoken word outing. Although Madlib's work here isn't necessarily as quirky as his instrumentals for Quasimoto's The Unseen and the tracks that are floating around from his upcoming Madvillain collaboration with MF Doom, he does save the record from being a total disaster-- sometimes overcoming zero gravity. As for Dudley Perkins, it might behoove him to know that McDonalds is the place to rock. It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.","With all due respect to both parties, Dudley Perkins is a poor man's Wesley Willis. The latter-- God bless ...

Beard of Lightning / Mist King Urth,Phantom TollboothLifeguards,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ce9d034d5c69bf27ea/1:1/w_160/c28459d9.jpg,2003-09-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11805-beard-of-lightning-mist-king-urth/,Off,"Who among us is the info-glutton spacy enough to have forgotten June 24, 2002, when Pitchfork's Matt LeMay wrote, in a review of Universal Truths and Cycles: ""So, Robert Pollard has grown up. The question now is whether his newfound maturity will be able to replace the ambition and vivacity that came with his perpetual youth. Whatever hopes he might have had of bringing his sweet rock and roll to the masses have been crushed, trampled, and stomped into the ground."" That line struck America's rock-conscious multitudes as a redundancy constructed under the influence of hero-skewering giddiness (aww, did he have to say ""crushed,"" ""trampled"" and ""stomped""?), but upon rumination, the quip revealed itself as a brilliant-if-tasteless reference to the eleven casualties of Pollard's own heroes The Who (crushed, trampled, and stomped in Cincinnati, 1979-- you may remember the Very Special episode of WKRP). Dearly beloved, let us filibust: Earthquake Glue may boast a few hits, but it's still clackity art-rock, suggesting a more militaristic Pere Ubu, and for my money, it wilts beside its immediate predecessor, which I see as the best GBV release of the Doug Gillard era. Like many a minion, I have stood readier to champion The Bob than a fratboy is to defend freedom by donning a ""Fuque France"" wifebeater. ""Hey, there, friends,"" I would say to whichever Blandinistas tried to diss Pollard's (torrential) post-Sprout output, ""he named his catch-all releases the 'The Fading Captain Series,' which kind of protects him from the harsh critique, much like that one show's being named Jackass kind of protects"" etc. My dear LeMay missed Universal Truths and Cycles' most novel implement: Christianity. Eleven of its nineteen tracks overtly summon the religion's crucial narratives or Proper Nouns, with at least two more obliquely appropriating its mythology/ideology. Did the drunken onetime Spin-pet (conspicuously when writer Jim Greer was a quasi-member) find him some 'Hovah, or was he only dabbling in order to generate songs, a la Dylan's flirtation with Messiah McThorncrown? And except for some pausey, over-plucked cants, UT&CM boasted what we want from Pollard: tunes. (Okay, Gillard is too rigid a chopsman to produce tunes, so let's say ""anthems."") Except for ""Game of Pricks"", GBV lyrics, which we knew were yanked from Ohio's butt, were never the collecting point. Which brings us to the part about how Pollard has meandered beyond must-ownership with the faux team-ups (Soft Rock Renegades), faux soundtracks (Tropic of Nipples, Motel of Fools), phone-ins (Go Back Snowball, Airport 5), cash-ins (the eighty-six dollar Suitcase box), and several sleep-ins and confuse-ins (including Nightwalker, Circus Devils, Hazzard Hotrods, Howling Wolf Orchestra, Acid Ranch, Lexo & The Leapers, Kuda LaBranche, New Creatures, etc). Maybe I'm still mad about Selective Service only having one new song on it, but no one could deny that Pollard creates as many orphans as the International Monetary Fund. And here, half-dressed and filth-kneed, stand two more of his soul children, eating their fingers like they're just another meal. The real, Pollard-less Phantom Tollbooth was a too-talented, wanky fusion-psych thing in the 1980s; some of its members later did notable string-bending with Kramer and several of his Shimmy-Disc imps. Like a Dennis Quaid movie gone nutty, this disc features Pollard phoning his vocals back into the past, replacing the originals like a soap opera castmember-swap gone nutty. The result is a strained epic, with a wounded-nerd Daltrey recounting dystopian proceedings over some punk-Satriani proficientscapes. This is hyperactivity distilled. Imagine Pollard competing with a clean Gillard solo that goes on forever. Then yank Gillard, and thus Gillard's restraint, and crank the noodle-factor to the pulsating roof. What can I say about this largely uninteresting labor of love? That the sci-fi ""Janus Pan"" sports an excellently hemorraghing bassline? Does Pollard really prefer this troupe's flublessness to his old gang's punchy Beatle-detritus? The Lifeguards project, meanwhile, is the second release (but the first under this name) by Robert Pollard and Doug Gillard as a duo, and this set of songs shifts pretty wistfully from arena-prog (but with a pinch of Journey/Foreigner) to Buzzcocks flurry (but with a pinch of Guided by Voices). One of the instrumentals is a Marty McFly amp-test, and even the unstodgy ""Society Dome"" falls from its fresh lyrical beginnings to words worthy of screamo advice-core: ""I'm going home/ Focus on a dream/ Try to find a way out/ Try to find a way out."" The classic complaints could all be lodged: one song will be repetitive and overlong, so you know the next will be inspired and ruefully breif. ""Then We Agree"", though, is sweet space-pop, and the bouncy piano of the eight-minute ""Red Whips and Miracles"" nominates it to be the first Pollard song to close an episode of Seventh Heaven (stay tuned for the last-minute axe-work worthy of An Officer and a Gentleman, which is, while we're at it, is a good way to view the pairing of Pollard and Gillard). During two back-to-back live nights in Atlanta last year, these guys still had the magic. (Plus comedy, when Bob bonked a kid with his mid-twirl mic, then explained over the P.A. how the kid should sue Matador Records.) And at the Magnet 10th Anniversary show this year, they still had the magic. (Plus comedy, when Bob invited some middle-aged untrendy associates on stage to dance and admit that they didn't like him.) So I'll stop way short of claiming that the emperor has no discretion. He's still challenging himself, rather than hanging with a bunch of crass yes-men. Who among us is the info-glutton spacy enough to have forgotten July 1st, 2003, when I compared Eef Barzelay to Bob Seger? Then-Senior Editor Chris Ott pulled me into his office by my Ice-T medallion, closed the blinds, and asked me where the fuck was Eef Barzelay's ""Night Moves""? Robert Pollard's night moves would stretch from here to the liquor store, and back, and back in the afternoon, and then what's a sundown without booze, and...

Team Boo,Mates of State,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d769fc7814a47cd742/1:1/w_160/3205eed1.jpg,2003-09-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5145-team-boo/,Polyvinyl,"In the interest of giving the marriage-band Mates of State a different review for once, the following things will not be discussed: love, the love-gaze, relationships as metaphors for music, music as metaphor for relationships, and so on. This restriction is not to deny that Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel aren't adorable (stomach-crampingly so, actually), or that they don't consciously play off their gimmick-- excuse me-- unique situation, for all it's worth. It's just to consider their music in a different way than a million other muso-hacks who pounce on the easy angle. Umm, don't check the archives. Instead, this thinkpiece will celebrate a duo who even money said would flare out after an excellent debut and a sagging follow-up, but who fought the odds to scrape back with a third album that remembers what they did right in the first place, while simultastically evolving their sound in surprising ways. 2002's Our Constant Concern threatened to point the band towards weepy Hallmark piano balladeering, conforming to the criticsphere's pretty portrait of the Mates as Cupid in Indie Clothes. But now Team Boo brings back the carefree raucousness that marked My Solo Project: giant calliope organ! Crooked waltz drumming! Joyous holleration harmonies! Not everywhere, unfortunately, as sluggard songs like ""Parachutes (Funeral Song)"" and ""The Kissaway"" still hang around to drag down the third quarter. But don't be lured to the skip button by the slow tempo opening of ""Open Book"", as the song blooms to a size more epic than anything in their catalog, complete with mini-choir. Cracker-Jack surprises like that lift Team Boo above tired retread status, with the duo allowing outside players in on the action for the first time (and now you can see how the relationship metaphor would've gotten kinda, well, gross). Change is applied most convincingly to ""Whiner's Bio"", in which a squint-bright trumpet pops up to underscore the pair's vocal cross-stitch. Later, a brassy gloss is applied to the finale of ""An Experiment"", a lengthy-for-them track that might've otherwise succumbed to dreariness. While the Mates never had any problem avoiding a thin sound, what with Gardner's meaty organ and Hammel's cephalopod drumming, things were starting to skew in a predictable direction, and producer/Spooninite Jim Eno's tasteful appliqué of the horn (and elegantly unobtrusive amount of overdubbing) suggests the group isn't quite up against a dead end yet. Elsewhere, as advertised, are a handful of reminders why My Solo Project was able to chase away the easy Quasi comparisons. ""Ha Ha"" revisits the patchwork structure of their early material, compressing a good three or four distinct segments into a rollicking three minutes. ""I Got This Feelin'"" allows the industrial hum of organ bass to slide contentedly while the husband and wife harmonize on one of their most incongruous lyrics ever: ""This couldn't be more GHETTO!"" ""Sound It Off"" and ""Fluke"" also provide moments of distorted-organ goodness and polyrhythmic jarring, answering my prayers for a music that combines the fun of baseball stadium P.A. music and math-rock. So Team Boo turns out to be a surprisingly respectable junior-year effort-- one that puts Mates of State in the small minority of indie-pop bands that don't fall under the one-album-and-out rule. Whether they can push the limits of their sound much further remains to be seen (Fridmann and his pocket orchestra need not apply), but their first shaky steps towards outside collaboration work well here. Hell, maybe it'll even be enough to fool people into writing about something other than how damn cute they are! Maybe.","In the interest of giving the marriage-band Mates of State a different review for once, the following\n\ things will ...

"This is Our Punk Rock, Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing",The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-la-la Band with Choir,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4085e6ef95969320796/1:1/w_160/77ff5109.gif,2003-09-18 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7164-this-is-our-punk-rock-thee-rusted-satellites-gather-sing/,Constellation,"It's been over thirty years since Bowie got glittery, and since, rock and roll gimmickry has just about exhausted itself: we've still got boys in suits, faux-brother/sister duos, and men with split tongues sporting full makeup, but the public's fickle interest wanes far faster these days, and it takes more than silver boots to raise a collective eyebrow. Post-rock, on the other hand, is barely post-pubescent, so there's still lots of time for snarking around-- and no one seems to have a better grasp of this than the Canadian post-rock collectives, who consistently release records under completely ridiculous names. Enter Silver Mt. Zion, who, guest players and fancy accoutrements aside, are essentially a Montreal-based sextet fronted by Godspeed You! Black Emperor's brooding brainchild, Efrim Menuck. Both of Efrim's gigs boast spacious, classical-meets-post-rock sounds (not to mention a proclivity for fiendishly irrelevant identity crises), but there are no shifting exclamation points here-- this one's gimmick is the bandname that expands with each release. Debuting as the relatively modest A Silver Mt. Zion, 2001's Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward had them billed as the more epic-sounding The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band. And this time out they've been generous enough to grace us ""With Choir,"" too. The contrivances, of course, goes a little deeper than that, and while This is Our Punk Rock, Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing may not be quite as concept-heavy as something like Ziggy Stardust, it nonetheless comes with a pointed, non-musical agenda. Silver Mt. Zion's brand of ""punk rock"" is, in a sense, just that: ideologically driven protest music designed to raise a big fat finger at established social and cultural norms. But don't go getting all pogo-primed-- this is cerebral shit, less concerned with getting you to strap on black boots than encouraging you to boycott Wal-Mart and locate alternative news sources. The underlying concept of the record is heady, but not too different from what (the comparably lucid) Conor Oberst was hollering about on Desaparacidos' Read Music/Speak Spanish: lashing out against the impending threat of unregulated urban landscapes, sprawling bigbox superstores, and governmental mismanagement. Unlike Oberst, though, Silver Mt. Zion think globally, and this album also contains jabs at western imperialism, piggish entitlement, and ethically questionable military occupations. For the most part, the band employs more subtle means of communicating their message than plain old lyrics: This is Our Punk Rock mainly consists of swooping strings, hollowed chanting, and found sounds arranged into big orchestral and choral sequences. Opener ""Sow Some Lonesome Corner So Many Flowers Bloom"" features a swoon-and-break structure that resurfaces on the album again and again: these songs are far from formulaic, but they occasionally mimic each other's movements-- multi-layered vocals bleed into orchestral recesses, which shift into silence and then into noise. One very notable difference between this and other Silver Mt. Zion records is that it sees Efrim's quivering pipes just as active as his guitar-screwdrivering hands. And he's not the only one treating us to high-pitched, deliberately off-key warbling; this is where the questionable stylings of that ""full amateur choir"" come into play. All these unnecessary (and aggressively shrill) vocal contributions can quickly become grating, especially when they interfere with the impressive instrumentation. In a way, this contrast makes sense: Silver Mt. Zion seem to intend these songs to be heard and perceived as angry or defiant, but it's difficult to get around their inherent beauty. The tension between the delicacy and the outrage (or between the strings and the vocals) has potential to be unbelievably compelling-- it's just that its implementation here is usually far more distracting than enlightening. Consequently, the relative success of This is Our Punk Rock is hard to quantify in any unilateral way; it relies heavily on user participation, and the quality of that exchange is inextricably linked to how much time and patience a given listener has available on the day they pick up this record and drag it back home. Making thematically (and aurally) challenging music that's not particularly ""easy"" to summarize or decipher is obviously not something to rally against; nobody wants Silver Mt. Zion to drop their agenda, embrace facility, and dumb that shit down. But self-indulgence (coupled with a healthy smattering of righteousness) is still a viable problem, even if it's wrapped up in a thick blanket of noble intentions. When you've opted to go full-on ""difficult,"" you've got to be extra careful to validate the concessions you're demanding of your audience-- the fact that it takes a good minute to even type out the name of this band and the title of their record means, then, that folks should also have the automatic right to ask the hard questions (just as A Silver Mt. Zion have the right to record four fifteen-minute, heavily principled opuses), and to actively challenge the bits that seem overwrought, irritating, or wincingly pretentious. Which circles back to listener dedication: if you're willing to filter out (or learn to appreciate) Menuck's maddening vocal cartwheeling, and let yourself be led around by the head for a bit, This is Our Punk Rock will reward you with a few sizable payoffs. But if your tolerance for self-importance is dipping low, look elsewhere for edification. Fast.",,7.4,
It Still Moves,My Morning Jacket,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42869fc7814a47cd7fb/1:1/w_160/51becc57.jpg,2003-09-17 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5531-it-still-moves/,BMGATO,"It's that moment every indie kid irrationally fears: your favorite band gets the call-up to the majors. Now that they've come to prominence via the California-based indie Darla Records, it's My Morning Jacket's turn to risk their careers and financial stability for a shot at recording a real statement album backed by a serious budget. But something's not right here, or maybe something's too right: Jim James' high, lonesome croon is still recorded in a grain silo, and the band's sound is still a cathedral of reverb, but where you might expect grandiose 40-piece orchestras, bombastic gospel choirs and glossy, state-of-the-art digital effects, you will find only the vast, empty space that has always accompanied the band's instrumentation, allowing each note to resonate indefinitely, unhampered by unnecessary density. Rest assured, the faithful will have no problem kneeling here. Last year's exploratory Chocolate & Ice EP left quite a few open questions about the band's future direction, many signals of which could be found in the 24-minute electro-funk centerpiece ""Cobra"". But It Still Moves almost immediately confirms that the spacy Southern psych that My Morning Jacket built their name on remains their bread and butter. ""Mahgeetah"" is full of the long, drawn-out vocals that made ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" such an affecting and seemingly meaningful question; it also carries over the texture of that song, building a small epic out of the same elements. The band reacts to each verse differently-- once with explosions of glimmering arpeggios, later with Johnny Quaid's beautiful, understated guitar solo-- before bringing the whole thing to one of those thunderous conclusions that makes classic rock live albums such a guilty pleasure. ""Golden"" trots through a glowing haze of reverb on Patrick Hallahan's steadily brushed beat, its lilting finger-picking and ghostly harmonies falling somewhere between The Band's stately Canadicana and The Byrds' ""Ballad of Easy Rider"". ""One Big Holiday"" doesn't look like much from the lyrics in the liners, but when James grabs hold of the opening line, ""Wakin' up feeling good and limber,"" and draws it out in his singular way, it feels about a million times more weighty than it probably should. Near the album's midpoint, the reverb reaches such titanic proportions that James' drifting vocals begin to rival Sigur Rós' Jon Thor Birgisson for shear ethereality, particularly on a track like ""I Will Sing You Songs"". It's like listening in the throes of a lucid dream. ""Easy Morning Rebel"" puts your feet back on the ground with its swinging arrangement and Memphis horns (actually played by veteran Stax session men-- one of the rare frills here made available by major label dollars). And then, finally, the band leaves James alone in his silo to close the album with the searching, desperate ""One in the Same"", a song that finds him seemingly trying to sort fragmented memories into coherent thoughts. When he hits the lines, ""It wasn't till I woke up/ That I could hold down a joke or a job or a dream/ But then all three are one in the same,"" it should put a lump in your throat. And with that, It Still Moves strums to a close, an album by turns beautiful and possessed, by others raucous and fiery. If you're standing by the record racks trying to choose between this and the band's other major achievement, At Dawn, flip a coin; either way, you win. My Morning Jacket have made the move to the bigs in tremendous style, and as far as I can tell they haven't compromised a thing to be there. If there's one major flaw I could point to here, it'd be the album's length-- 74 minutes is a long runtime for any record, and as a result, the album is usually better off listened to in chunks-- but that's a small concern considering the riches that await inside.","It's that moment every indie kid irrationally fears: your favorite band gets the call-up to the majors.\n\ Now ...

Music to Climb the Apple Tree By,Beat Happening,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42b13d1975652138c5b/1:1/w_160/4fa1936e.jpg,2003-09-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1073-music-to-climb-the-apple-tree-by/,K,"A decade ago, I loudly expounded upon Beat Happening's Spartan beauty to a pack of rabid, cynical post-hardcore friends of mine who, try as they might, could only see childish amateurism in Bret Lunsford, Calvin Johnson, and Heather Lewis's rustic childhood sing-alongs. I was a teenage devotee. When naysayers complained that Dreamy was hollow, I explained that Beat Happening didn't need a bassist because Calvin's voice was deep enough to supply endless roots. When Mel Bay graduates groaned about the primitive rock drumming and simple guitar strums, I wrote essays in the school paper about why the trio's minimalism eloquently flew in the face of cheesy rock star excess; and besides, the Olympians perfected a dark, perverse sweetness I only ever really saw in my favorite books. In the sparest of tunes about hot chocolate boys, holding hands after sex, or eating wild cherries and french toast at cemeteries, Beat Happening's songs were dumpster-diving romantic. Live, Calvin's oddball dances and wide-eyed charisma created a dose of creepy punk-confrontation-cum-childhood-trauma and was more unnerving than the faceless dudes next door wallowing in a generic sea of uninspired tough-guy Sam Ash tropes. Subsequently, these darker, headier aspects of Beat Happening's poetry were lost to twee-pop groups like Cub, Bunnygrunt, and dozens of pixie-stix-sucking copycat dorks who misinterpreted the trio's outer-id lyricism as a call for lunchbox-toting kindergarten cuddlecore. Though I'm no fan of Bret, Calvin, or Heather's later work, as Beat Happening they epitomized a Blake-as-teenage-punk philosophy. Their aesthetic was so pared down that it barely allowed room for a misfire from their formative bare-bones autism in the early 80s to 1992's fleshed-out grand finale, You Turn Me On. Second maybe only to Fugazi in my formative musical worldview, and ripe for a reconsideration by youngsters who perhaps only know the autumnal anthem ""Indian Summer"" through Luna's soporific cover, the band's entire output was collected on last year's Crashing Through-- titled after a track from 1988's Jamboree-- a retrospective seven-disc box set complete with an extensive 96-page booklet authored by fellow salad-day traveller Lois Maffeo. Music to Climb the Apple Tree By, which was included with that box set, compiles fifteen songs recorded between 1984 and 2000, including the original version of ""Nancy Sin"" and the four dense, acrobatic tracks that comprised the band's 1988's split EP with Screaming Trees. Other highlights include Beat Happening's newest, but equally spare compositions: ""Angel Gone"" and ""Zombie Limbo Time"" from 2000's Angel Gone seven-inch, and the still-great ""Foggy Eyes"", which was first included on their self-titled 1985 debut and later covered on the 1991 Beat Happening tribute Fortune Cookie Prize by Seaweed in a version predictably raucous enough for even the most macho of naysayers. Fifteen tracks, of course, is but a tiny blip in a lengthy oeuvre, and despite my high opinion of Beat Happening, Music to Climb the Apple Tree By, like most hodgepodge singles collections, not only ends in a preposition, but lacks narrative cohesion as though waiting for the rest of the sentence to show up and complete the thought. I'm a stalwart fan of original album sequences, especially the way songs play off one another after years of close proximity; the new placement of these tracks doesn't feel correct somehow-- it's more like the ahistorical, catch-all desktop of an MP3 fanatic than those fully realized rainy-day adventure stories for which I enjoyed Beat Happening the most. Most kindly put, Music to Climb the Apple Tree By works as a reminder of a particularly great band, and it had me cycling obsessively through the lost corners of my record collection for my copy of Dreamy. If this is your first listen, use these tiny pop moments as the impetus for a more complete investigation of a band you should already know by heart.","A decade ago, I loudly expounded upon Beat Happening's Spartan beauty to a pack of rabid, cynical post-hardcore friends ...

Nymphomatriarch,Nymphomatriarch,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b956c0084474cd0c25b0/1:1/w_160/1f7a1794.gif,2003-09-17 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5878-nymphomatriarch/,Hymen,"Many questions arise when you hear that Venetian Snares and Hecate literally made an album out of sex. Am I in a dream? Wait, isn't that what this year's Winter in the Belly of a Snake was made of? When did these two become IDM's J-Lo and Ben? Most pressing of all, why has no one ever thought of recording sex sounds until now? Oh wait, they did: it's called pornography. I think we can all agree that sex records are always a good idea, in any environs, under any guidance, with anyone. It does, however, introduce a bit of a problem: the distinction between art and pornography. Although I have a cursory acquaintance with the decisions of the Warren Court in the 1950s, it's an important thing to consider before dissecting this album. Am I supposed to be hearing it carnally as sex with a sort of narrative (including, pant, the climax!)? Is it just influenced by sex? Is it sex? Like all rhetorical questions, the answer to all is no. The dilemma inherent in a gimmick like this is that it's only possible to derive enjoyment from it if you know it has to do with an orgiastic camorra of naked, shivering techno-bodies rubbing all over one another. The album is composed entirely out of the recording of ""anal and oral sex, straightforward copulation, and 'microphone insertion.'"" But, perhaps unfortunately, this is pretty close to the standard recording of most pop songs in the last century. You think Elvis was big because of his music? Anyone seen Amadeus? In a year where Madonna and Britney Spears are luring ointment into the holiest of each other's crevices in Pepsi commercials, I don't need some experimental glitch/IDM freak telling me how you can make music out of moaning. Most of those popular songs are actually about sex. Nymphomatriarch is about melancholy sparseness and irony. Sexy? Whatever happened to Isaac Hayes? The intro, ""Input"", is the Mormon Tabernacle put on life support, and I guess about putting a microphone in, how to say, Hecate's ""subwoofer."" It does indeed sound like shrill moaning and expanding orifices, but it would be unrecognizable if you didn't get the press release ahead of time. Basically, it just sounds like some inept ambience with some silly melodic synths. But things do heat up rather quickly. The percussion of ""Blood on the Rope"" seems to be almost entirely composed of the revelatory sound of ass-smacking, though without any sort of visual accompaniment, it sounds more like someone masochistically slapping some girl's face at 30 miles per hour than the unleashing of raging lust (unless that's your definition of raging lust). Whether it's successful or not probably depends more on your sexual preferences than your musical ones. Put it like this: it gives a whole new meaning to the term ""drill-n-bass."" Like the rest of the album, it might be more seductive if they got rid of the sex sounds. As it is, it doesn't sound extraordinarily different from playing Venetian Snares over a Hecate song. Nevertheless, between ""Blood on the Rope"" and the pummeled bruises of ""Pervs"", there's some pretty perfervidly maniacal rhythm on this album. ""Pervs"" may sound more like unzipping your skin than lecherous intrigue, but whatever, it's definitely got a bite. ""Amaurophilia"" also really doesn't have much to do with what the common man might call intercourse, or a commoner man might call ""boning hos."" The noises are all gravelly crunching, running faucets, abandoned swing sets in Death Park. It's probably about as sexual as any other Venetian Snares album. I don't know what it does for other people; it made me cough a lot. These tracks are adequately creative, with or without the sex, but you wish it hadn't been wasted on a gimmick album. Unfortunately, about half of the half-hour album is dedicated to ""Hymen Tramp Choir"", which is basically the intro times fifteen minutes of your life. It's an incredibly slow, metallic sheen, about as sexual and exciting as cleaning a sink with Brillo pads. Of course, for many, this may be more like sex than sex. But, even then, Brillo pads are less expensive than CDs right now. It goes through some gushingly lascivious whispers, but rapidly transports itself to new age catalogues of waterfalls and phantasmagoric forests before finally crumbling as a phlegmatic yawn. Without this unnecessary tedium, the album might even reach into the 7's. There are clear antecedents here that I'm obligated to refer to: Matmos' A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure and Herbert's Bodily Functions, and probably some of that intellectual porn-lit IDM kids are into, like de Sade or Sacher-Masoch. In a Rolling Stone interview producer RZA once testified that on a track off ODB's Nigga Please, the extremely irrational and arrhythmic percussion is actually the sound of Dirt McGirt banging some girl on top of a bass drum while he's rapping. This is and should be the sound of sex. Piling some fierce and propulsive beats over an echo chamber is not sexy (not even ironically); it's irrelevant at worst and frightening at best.","Many questions arise when you hear that Venetian Snares and Hecate literally made an album out of sex.

Puckett's Versus the Country Boy EP,Matt Sharp,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6395e6ef95969320caa/1:1/w_160/78f61c30.jpg,2003-09-17 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7707-pucketts-versus-the-country-boy-ep/,In Music We Trust,"On paper this reads like a personal revolution: Matt Sharp, founding member of Weezer and lead proprietor of the Moog-flushed New Wave-revivalist project The Rentals, escapes to rural Tennessee, loses the coke-bottle rims, and re-colors his musical complexion by recording a catalogue of contemplative acoustic-based lamentations. Coming from my speakers, though, it sounds something more akin to a lunch-break sit-in than an emphatic compositional dethronement. Even so, it would be easy to indulge one's self with such a storyline if one (read: overly fascinated Weezer fan) was so inclined, given the facts. Of the four primary records Sharp recorded in the 90s, three (Weezer, Pinkerton, Return of The Rentals) were nearly unqualified successes. His fourth, 1999's Seven More Minutes, was a hedonistic, uber-polished glamfest recorded in Europe with such indie royalty as Damon Albarn. The scene would certainly seem to be set for a dramatic introversion and grand stylistic makeover replete with a shirking of success. The resulting material reveals more of a half-truth. Then again, perhaps I over calibrated, but when I read about ""haunting,"" ""sparse"" and ""spiritual"" strains written with the intent of disestablishing the barriers between the performer and the listener, this is not at all what I envision. ""Goodbye West Coast"", the opener, is essentially a slow-drip Rentals melody carried by a little acoustic strumming and the requisite picking. The lullaby chorus is delicately anthemic and carried by another Sharp signature: multi-layered vocal tracking. Stir in the textured and glossy finish, and what results is a grayscale rendering of a Rentals color snapshot. Or maybe it's a B-side acoustic cover. With an acoustic guitar, some sublevel ambience, and lap steel that functions as visceral persuasion in the same capacity a Moog would have, ""Some Come Running Through"" might suffer the same appraisal were it not for the marked attempt at achieving a countrified feel, most notably projected by Sharp's nasal Dylan-meets-Petty syllabic protractions. The final two songs operate within a similar framework with a few notable distractions, all three surpassing the five-minute mark, yet none providing justification for having done so. ""Visions of Anna"", with a lazy piano lead, dissolves into excess as Sharp dryly breathes out the line, ""Visions of Anna make me cry,"" in such a way that makes it impossible for my mind not to conjure up the mental image of miss Norma Jean serenading our 35th President. ""Hey, What You Gonna Do?"" unfortunately uses a little bit of the sing-then-talk method to obviously irksome effect, and essentially obviates what might have been the most vital statement on the album. Thematically, each of the four tracks deals with modest personal narratives of loss and regret. ""Goodbye West Coast"" explores the emotional weight of returning to a best friend's funeral, while the others relate a sort of can't-git-no-lower romantic portentousness. Such a disposition is probably most indicative of the motivation for the stylistic shift and change of climate. These humble songs, in the end, are chiefly innocuous, and perhaps the experience was even cathartic and therapeutic for Sharp, though most of this jury is too disinterested to return for a more thorough rendering when a full album of evidence is released in the future.","On paper this reads like a personal revolution: Matt Sharp, founding member of Weezer and lead proprietor of the Moog-flushed ...

We Were Born in a Flame,Sam Roberts,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a287c0084474cd0c0076/1:1/w_160/f62b34d9.jpg,2003-09-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6802-we-were-born-in-a-flame/,Interscope,"Sam Roberts grew up harboring the awesomely Canadian ambition of becoming a professional hockey player; apparently, he was already pretty far down the icy path to mangled teeth and sweaty mullets when he got the shit kicked out of him on the not-so-hockey-friendly streets of Hawaii. Roberts, then fourteen, was competing in an off-season triathlon, and (cue bad lighting) inadvertently wandered into the wrong neighborhood at a clearly inopportune time. Roberts later said that the last thing he heard before blacking out was, ""Pound him, Vince."" Permanently injured and subsequently inspired, Roberts started writing songs from his hospital bed (the first of which was titled, lovingly, ""Keep Your Stick on the Ice"") and quietly abandoned hockey for a slightly gentler pursuit. We Were Born in a Flame is Roberts' bouncy full-length debut, and it's a perfectly listenable follow-up to 2002's The Inhuman Condition EP-- any Shaq-inspired fear of the-athlete-gone-recording-artist should prove itself unfounded. With We Were Born, a now twenty-six year old Roberts shows off an impressive sonic range, flitting from scrappy punk throwdowns to billowing power-pop, and his thick, rocker warble is always infused with lots of bleeding-kid-in-the-gutter mettle. The only problem is that Roberts' record ultimately fails to transcend the standard, been-there, guitar-based rock formula that ties each of his booming experiments together-- We Were Born in a Flame is often painfully straightforward. But if bone-tingling innovation isn't your bag, there's plenty of stuff to dig here: ""Don't Walk Away, Eileen"" is a belligerent electric punch, sorta reminiscent of the early, super-tense Who records, and ""Brother Down"" is a vaguely-retro acoustic stomp, with indulgently cheesy sing-along lyrics (always feels good to shout ""I think my life is passing me by!"") and pithy, foot-tapping percussion. ""Where Have All The Good People Gone?"" is an equally energetic, giggly cut (""The modern world is a cold, cold world/ And all I meet are cold, cold girls"") with ample opportunity for head-bobbing and dopey grinning. Roberts brazenly hollers shit like, ""Yeah I bleed rock and roll/ And I would die for rock and roll,"" but it seems pretty unlikely that anyone will ever actually buy into his yelped assertions. We Were Born in a Flame is just a little too benign to really wave the badass flag with pride. But Roberts does thank Ted ""hide-your-cat-and-girlfriend"" Nugent in his liner notes, which, really, has gotta be worth something.

From Me to U,Juelz Santana,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63e5e6ef95969320cb6/1:1/w_160/bd8c3329.jpg,2003-09-16 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7712-from-me-to-u/,Def JamDiplomat,"Looking at this youthfully exuberant New York emcee, you may think of him as your average street corner confidant. Your buddy ""Boo-Boo"" that you send to the store for blunt wraps. Your chum ""Chomper"" that you'd ask to hold onto your unlicensed handgun. Or, in this case, your pal, ""Juelz."" He's the young gun with too much headgear and not nearly enough lyrical prowess to carry his debut album From Me to U. He has the right people around him: a protégé of the pink fuhrer of rap (Cam'ron), flanked by one of the quickest rising production teams (The Heatmakerz) and distributed through a subsidiary of Def Jam (Diplomat Records); there's no reason for him to fail in the wildly flamboyant matter that he does. If you're not familiar with Juelz Santana, you may remember him from the news for delivering the line ""I worship the late prophet Mohammed Atta/ For his courage behind the wheel of the plane/ Reminds me of dealing the 'caine."" People consider his style an amalgam of the unofficial collaborating team of Jay-Z, Scarface and Beanie Sigel: emotional, charismatic, streetwise, and, in the case of Sigel, constantly repeating the last word of his rhymes. In this respect, Santana comes off like Cam'ron without the talent. His rhymes usually start off relatively strong, taking an introspective view into various tired street subjects, from the police (""Squalie"") to blowjobs (""Down"") to his dead homies (""This is for My Homies""). And then, his rhymes end up looking something like what I'll write for you here: ""I'm not a commie, Bobby/ Mr. Miyagi, Bobby/ I'm hardly a slob-by, Bobby/ I'm fucking godly, Bobby."" Basically, he falls apart halfway through each of his verses, descending into an awkward yelling spree that fails to move him past the point he started to make with the first eight lines. The best example is, surprisingly, the first single. ""Dipset (Santana's Town)"" is-- and this is no exaggeration-- the worst song of the year. A stuttering abomination, the beat by Self sounds like what might happen if ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" got mixed with the theme from Psycho and random female utterances. The lyrics don't help, with Santana screaming, ""The whole bird gang's in here/ Like Kurt Cobain was here, YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!"", subsequently setting off the nonsensical rhyme of, ""They the paparazzi, they the livest posse/ Kamikaze, nazi, nazi, copy, papi?"" and ending it with, ""I'm a baller baller/ You're not at all a baller/ That's why I squashed your daughter/ Left her home, call her, call her."" The song ends and you just sit. You think. You wonder. The song has a place in your heart now. Your arteries close. Your heart explodes. The song has taken another life. Fin. Hearing their previous work, you might expect me to say how The Heatmakerz have salvaged this record. And while they do help, I can't quite give them pure adoration. Some songs utilize their powerful accelerated soul sample style well (""Okay Okay"", ""Squalie"", ""My Love [Remix]"") while others are questionable, regarding their choice of sample. They manage to sample Mary J. Blige, a group of Jodeci rip-offs (D.R.S.) and most heinously, Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On"". Supported by embarrassing pieces by Self, Chad Hamilton, Jazze Pha and Charlemagne, this album falls apart where everyone thought it would succeed--and the complete absence of Just Blaze is the final blow. Pointlessly misogynistic (blowjob skits were done as soon as Biggie did one), lyrically weak and relatively hit/miss with production, Santana's first album is a pretty difficult listen. There are maybe a million emcees out there doing the exact same thing that he is-- only they aren't functionally retarded. Unfortunately for Juelz, he's stuck continuously square-pegging in Circle Junction. Surrounded with a low budget G-Unit and stuck in a genre with deeper, more talented peers, Juelz can't offer an interesting alternative to the common land of commercial rap.","Looking at this youthfully exuberant New York emcee, you may think of him as your average street corner\n\ confidant ...

Ghetto Pop Life,Danger MouseJemini,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4deb335119a49ec9e6/1:1/w_160/dcc79af2.gif,2003-09-16 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2517-ghetto-pop-life/,Lex,"I'm not sure there's a duller discussion to be had about music than the one about hip-hop's mainstream/underground divide. It's unnecessary and a slight bit juvenile because it's one-sided and too often an exercise in the have-nots simply praising themselves for their not having rather than, y'know, going out and developing their own style, and that's not a very productive way of going about things. DM + Jemini apparently couldn't give a toss about any of these hip-hop politics, either, because they've managed the too-rare trick of bridging the gap. Ghetto Pop Life is a leftfield album built with an emcee more interested in offering wordplay than storytelling or charisma, and a DJ who isn't afraid to underscore the lyrics with playful beats. DM + Jemini-- a self-contained crew, something of a rarity these days-- are also an odd couple. Danger Mouse is based in the far-more-pop-than-ghetto Athens, GA, wears animal costumes, and has crafted beats for limp British R&B; artists, while Jemini (formerly The Gifted One) is a mid-90s Brooklyn B-boy who recorded the Brooklyn Kids' solid Funk Soul Sensation EP. Jemini's nasal, sing-song voice and tendency to raise his tone as he delivers his lines contain echoes of Freeway and Sadat X, although he's not nearly as distinctive or engaging as the former or as high-pitched and offbeat as the latter; his poker-faced rhymes show a bit of dexterity but too often lack personality. Danger Mouse, meanwhile, seems stubbornly determined to make a party record, and acts a welcome counterweight. His soundscapes borrow heavily from hip-hop's history, but rarely drift into the back-patting regressiveness of Jurassic 5 and other old-school loyalists. Ghetto Pop Life's best tracks balance cinematic tones with a touch of funk and Prince Paul's penchant for quirk. It's fairly direct and hardly experimental-- DM's version of pop seems to cut off before the digital era (the only contemporary whose influence is noticeable is Just Blaze)-- but to compensate, it features some of the catchiest hooks the underground has produced this year. ""Born-a-MC""-- a regal opener in the spirit of Jay-Z's ""The Ruler's Back"" and The Streets' ""Turn the Page""-- bleeds into the swirling, trebly, and quite glorious title track. ""I got a bullet in the clip/ I got a lyric I could spit,"" Jemini proclaims, illustrating the record's denial of a hip-hop dichotomy. The top-heavy disc peaks early with its sixth track, the infectious, horn-driven ""The Only One"", which replicates a guilt-free block party vibe without pandering to nostalgia (unlike most of the record's guests, which include The Pharcyde, The Liks, and J-Zone). Other thrills come courtesy of the guitar-picking ""Omega Supreme (Who?!)"", the restless march of ""Copy Cats"", and ""That Brooklyn Shit"", a baroque, Wu-Tangish blend of bewilderment and braggadocio. Unfortunately, the record slumps to a close, weighted down by shaky attempts at topical rap: The calypso-esque ""Don't Do Drugs"" is a bit precious, oscillating between catchy and grating, while ""Bush Boys"" is a bit too simplistic, an exercise in preaching to the choir. Other missteps include the flat-out weak Pharcyde collaboration ""Medieval"", the love letter ""I'm a Doomee"", and ""Here We Go Again"", which seems to be purposefully arrhythmic in order to keep focus off its weighty topic, and goes down like medicine (or at least Black-Eyed Peas). It's even peppered with some oddly dated observations, like a mention of the OJ trial (?!) and the line, ""Republican/ Democrats/ One and the same,"" which, even as a former Nader voter, strikes me as a questionable observation. Jemini's comeback is heartwarming and welcome, but it's when Danger Mouse offers a delicate application of his influences that the album truly works. On the whole, the record's another winner from Warp subsidiary Lex Records, which also delivered Tes' x2 earlier in the year and will release the debut from Non Prophets next month. (They're providing some lovely packaging for their records, as well.) Although it's weighted down in spots, Ghetto Pop Life is, at its best, a true surprise from a seemingly mismatched pair working well together to produce a universal, populist sound.","I'm not sure there's a duller discussion to be had about music than the one about hip-hop's ...

Loud New Shit,Stars as Eyes,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54ac0084474cd0c06b2/1:1/w_160/9b954d0b.jpg,2003-09-16 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7473-loud-new-shit/,Tigerbeat6,"On Loud New Shit, a shift to lightweight ponderousness sucks the faint breeze out of Rhode Island-born, Delaware-based electro-rock duo Stars as Eyes. It's to be expected: remix albums of limpid semi-electric music have a tendency to highlight both the weakest non-rock and non-electronic aspects of a group's work, often through the illusionary notion that, by stretching something longer and increasing the thread-count, the overall composition can be magically reborn as ""experimental."" Yet what usually remains after such a reifying hack job is an electronic pop song that rocks faintly or a faint rock song that has a couple computer burps here and there to remind you it was recorded in the so-called digital age. More electro than past efforts, Loud New Shit includes eight remixes of tracks from last year's Enemy of Fun originals. In their purest (i.e. non-remixed) state, Stars as Eyes could be compared to Manitoba with a bland fixation on Stereolab, New Order, and OMD rather than the shoegaze of My Bloody Valentine or Ride. Add to this an ADD need for obvious rock dynamics, Stars as Eyes opt for up and down overdrive, rarely allowing for spaciousness to emerge in their overcrowded and unsuccessful approach to This Heat-style experiments. In this sense, however weak, Main's ""Time Dilation"" remix of ""Our Light"" is the strongest track on Loud New Shit, largely because its residual teeming of K.K. Null insect buzz doesn't even remotely resemble the anthemic original, tastefully avoiding the obvious laptop-guys-who-wanna-rock final payoff. In the grand scheme, Stars as Eyes would benefit best not from remixing, but from an entire structural reconstitution. Integrating rock and electronic music is an old enough concept-- check out early Cul de Sac or the aforementioned This Heat's Deceit or Repeat, or use your imagination and go back further-- but when yoking the lazier, platitudinal aspects of each, the result is the sonic equivalent of the failed Amphicar. While computers have opened up massive potential in music that's just starting to be plumbed in earnest, much of it is stapled to a click-track with a 120 BPM default, which makes it all sound a little like my wobbly, taped-together military march-time tin-can robot, the Sleeptron 2003. Despite what many offerings suggest, the merge takes more than a downloaded copy of ProTools and an extended Moogerfooger solo over My Bloody Valentine's ""When You Sleep"" slowed to a river of ones and zeros. It's a long way to go before this stuff will sound a tenth as fresh as, say, 1940s jazz, but if the expressive capability of your medium has expanded, why keep drawing stick-figure flipbook animations?","On Loud New Shit, a shift to lightweight ponderousness sucks the faint breeze out of Rhode Island-born, Delaware-based electro-rock duo ...

Reality,David Bowie,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35d9d034d5c69bf2de2/1:1/w_160/546aa4bf.jpg,2003-09-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/,Sony,"""There is a reason the present begrudges the past,"" writes Harlan Ellison; I won't pretend to be wise enough to know what that reason is, but I believe that statement to be true, regardless. The evidence is plain in just about anyone beyond a certain age, the all-consuming, epic oldness where a person can say ""when I was your age"" without a trace of irony. It hits some people as early as twenty or so, when they suddenly find themselves on the downhill side of life, confronted with a bleak realization that things were a whole lot greener back when they were still climbing (or before they knew any better, at least). Some people, they just never stop climbing; it's rare, but it happens. A great many of David Bowie's fans, with each successive year, slowly but surely creep into the former category even as Bowie himself manages to still act like a card-carrying member of the latter. ""I'm never never gonna get old,"" he proclaims on the Toys 'R' Us-inspired ""Never Get Old"", and to his credit, he makes yet another convincing argument. With one exception (the hokey, one-foot-in-the-grave Hours), Bowie-- even in his advanced age (by fresh-faced rock standards), even after almost a trillion records-- has never dwelled unduly on his past. If anything, while people will always hold him up to his past accomplishments, his career has floundered more than once out of his desire for self-conscious avant-gardism and an almost schizophrenic need to reinvent his persona. What last year's Heathen implied, and what Reality seems to prove, is that those days are over; never looking back, and no longer focusing ahead, Bowie has finally joined us all in the present, mind-young as ever but old enough not to make a show of it. And then, if you'll grant this indulgence, there's me, the one who's supposed to be writing about him: ""Plain Ol' 'Dave'"" baffles me. Bowie's work is traditionally seen in a terrifically damaging binary-- common law states that if his work isn't brilliant, it's terrible; that's obviously wrong, since there're plenty of gray areas to be found in Bowie's oeuvre, but it's easy as hell to fall into the trap. Not much can stack up to Hunky Dory or Scary Monsters, after all. But then he goes and releases, consecutively, the two most earnest, unpretentious albums he's ever dreamed up, and the Pocket Dichotomy that had been used so frequently to dismiss Outside, Earthling, and others, is now terminally, irrevocably broken. Heathen looked like it might've been a holding pattern on the way to greater heights, but only for rising from the ashes of Hours; Reality shows that instead, Bowie is not aiming for an unattainable Ziggy-caliber alien classic, but is simply going to rock like any other human, in a pleasantly mild, non-conformist manner. This is as close as Bowie has ever come to simply ""pretty good"" in his storied career. A zealous few will say that he's just further ahead of the curve than anyone can see, but if that's so, then what lies ahead is MOR rock and roll, with producer Tony Visconti's unobtrusive, light-handed electronic flourishes as gloss; no way-- he's too talented to be overtly influenced or obviously faddish, but that doesn't mean he's breaking ground. That's not an insult. I feel the biggest strength of this album is how relaxed it is, how well this anti-pose suits Bowie. It's freed him to craft some of the finest original material he's done in quite a while; Heathen best expressed his singular vision through the compositions of others, but Reality's original material easily overshadows its covers. In particular, the George Harrison-penned ""Try Some, Buy Some"", though a kind tribute to Bowie's recently deceased contemporary, might be the album's only real mistake. Sappy, vacant lyrics and plodding, waltz-timed orchestration give a feel similar to a more fleshed-out version of the Morrissey cover ""I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday"", but without any the self-referential poignancy invested in the latter. The deep-space broadcast of ""Pablo Picasso"" is a substantial improvement, in terms of covers, with its echoing trills and white-funk syncopation and the intense surrealism of hearing the words ""Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole/ Not like you,"" come from Bowie's mouth, but David promised that Reality would ""rock"", and he proceeds to do so even more effectively elsewhere. Hard-edged dynamics are supplied to direct, aggressive rhythms on numerous tracks like the supremely nervous, desperate ""Looking for Water"" and less obviously on the epic jazz kick ""Bring Me the Disco King"", but only ""New Killer Star"" feels like more than an exercise with slightly dusty rock standbys. It opens the album with a bassline etched indelibly within our genetic make-up, instantly recognizable and irresistible, and once the hook is set, a deluge of static-hazed background singers, weird robo-choruses, and a shaky treble riff that easily marks the album's finest moment simply spew forth from the speakers, overwhelming all but the most cynical of Bowie's detractors. At least, that's what I predict. Also worthy of mention is the stark contrast provided by ""The Loneliest Guy"". It sounds like the title to a forgotten Dudley Moore flick, and may sound somewhat like disingenuous fame lament coming from Bowie, but the song itself will dispel those thoughts. Nearly a cappella, with bare hints of strings and stray piano chords fading in from other rooms, Bowie instead offers that he's ""the luckiest guy/ Not the loneliest guy/ In the world/ Not me,"" but does so with such mournful uncertainty that no easy reading of the song is possible; it seems surprisingly human, bittersweet, and altogether far more real than its name implies. It's startlingly out of place, sandwiched between ""Never Get Old"" and ""Looking for Water"", so much so that it almost implies sarcasm, but that's fitting, as this is as eclectic and puzzling album as Bowie's ever made. He's not always at the top of his game, but Bowie's musical ideas, not filtered through any sort of trend-grab, are unfailingly unique, and that alone should cement his continued role as vibrant, modern artist for years to come.","""There is a reason the present begrudges the past,"" writes Harlan Ellison; I won't pretend to be wise enough ...

Triumphant,Thor,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a860b1335d7bf1699282/1:1/w_160/e613be2a.jpg,2003-09-16 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8235-triumphant/,Scratch,"Some gender theorists consider all exaggerated performances of sexual identity as drag. What fun, to see everyone from the most gussied, stilettoed hoochie to the most macho, nut-kneading hoss as participants in a global burlesque, playing dress-up to confirm, with cartoonish or even monstrous enthusiasm, a notion of ""hot,"" ""raw,"" ""extreme"" masculinity or femininity. (Pardon my blog: I can't speak for you Dakotans, but here in Florida, our faux-public spaces-- like say, our malls-- can seem like porn sets.) (Pardon my blog two: As the middle child between a bodybuilder and a beauty queen, I was subject to so many unsettling weekends of oil-n-bikini pageantry that I should have been driven by either allergy or addiction into becoming a monk or a prostitute.) Some of this hetero-drag costumery generates cross-gender-role feedback; consult stout/thuggy gurrls, or remember Arnold's chesty, hairless, braceleted, tiara-maned Conan. Jon Mikl Thor has spent thirty years as a drag king, the manniest man ever to manhandle outmanned mankind. This horror-film actor, star of his own comic (The Rock Warrior) and former Mr. Canada and Mr. USA (as well as former merchant of baking pans) has re-released the latest of his dozen-or-so albums with remastered sound, a few redone songs, five new songs, and two videos. The rating above represents the average score of the 0.0 that Triumphant earns for whatever Pitchfork attempts to assess (originality, artistry, musicianship, credigree?) and the 10.0 that Triumphant earns as a novelty-metal classic putting its genre's satirists to shame. (Why did Spinal Tap and Satanicide bother, when this stuff's already self-consciously a caricature to the point of being spoofproof?) What a crack-up the packaging is. The band logo is metallic, ""held on"" by Phillips-head screws. The front and back cover art feature an axe-, sword-, and shield-wielding whitey in a skull-belt and bat-helmet chopping up dark-skinned, apelike savages in order to protect his pale women, intimidatingly proportioned cowerers ""in"" ill-advised (transparent) thongs. Unfortunately, Nordic lore has long served as a ""white power"" myth, if more subtly than the Scottish rites usurped by the KKK. The Medieval Times-caliber accents in the skits are hilarious. The first two songs borrow from rap's brand-building tactic of saying the rapper's name over and over; Thor skillfully celebrates his Thorness (""I Am Thor"" is self-explanatory, while ""March to Glory"" chants, ""Thor is war, and war is Thor,"" though ""glory"" and ""whore"" might be in there somewhere). Thor's three favorite words are ""steel,"" ""thunder,"" and ""tundra,"" though he's always searching for priapic ""sceptres"" and ""hammers."" He says that ""anger is my middle name"" on ""Anger III"", which is confusing, since we know his middle name to be Mikl, unless we are to accept him as his one-word stage-name. Meanwhile, ""Thunderhawk"", seriously about being a thunderhawk, is fall-down funny. The majority of the music is standard-issue mega-drum deathcore, but that doesn't mean that the guitars don't charmingly grind like Panzer treads, or that the solos don't impressively veer from operatic to Tasmanian. Thor's electronically enhanced vocal range can be disorienting, as he approximates metal bandleaders from various decades, squealing then grunting then crooning and so forth and so on and stuff. ""Viking's Funeral"" constitutes an amazing mix-CD kickoff: with its Europe-ish keyboards, Iron Maiden-ish vox, campy skit, and Elfman-ish knells, this mother is ready for Broadway. The boogie organ of ""GraveYard (From the Film GraveYard)"" is another mean surprise. The album's major misstep is the bar-band quality ""Back for Blood"", which trots out a stinkbug of a riff, and begins, ""Well, you're so stupid, you're so dumb/ You're so foolish, you're a dirty rotten scum."" I could swear the next line was going to be about how The Fat Boys were back and could never be wack. But all the harm is rectified by the album's stupefying musical and lyrical peak: ""Throwing Cars at People on Coke with Thor"". Such a blitz, such a swarm, hasn't been heard by these ears since way before the Ipecac revivalists, around Suicidal Tendencies' first tape, and this is as terrifying a drug song as any Butthole Surfers binge-ditty. A resolute elitist in the room with me kept saying, ""This is the work of trailer-park anarchists,"" and, ""I bet their studio's in a strip mall,"" and, ""This sounds like a sport utility vehicle,"" but I don't mind Thor. The guy's latex tongue is shooting lightning bolts into his cheek, a la Gwar, making his comic-book mythos the white-warlock antidote to Danzig's snuff-Porsche oeuvre. Certain valorbrains might fall for the Bruckheimer ""war is great"" shit, but anyone who's seen Saving Private Ryan knows that Belle & Sebastian's ""Get Me Away from Here, I'm Dying"" is a more accurate combat anthem.

Another,Suntanama,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c79d034d5c69bf3392/1:1/w_160/15ab48a1.jpg,2003-09-15 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7595-another/,Drag City,"If it's not from the South and it doesn't rock, can you still call it Southern Rock? This isn't the kind of question one might usually ask, but it's one that's been rudely thrust upon me by The Suntanama, a platoon of New Yorkers who fancy themselves the second coming of the Allman Brothers. The Allmans were always the best of the Southern Rockers-- the way they mixed in jazz and a good degree of strong, concise songwriting easily set them apart from their peers-- but The Suntanama don't have any of the sense of craft or impact that their predecessors did. The title of this album should tell you all you need to know: Another. That's all it is, really; another Suntanama album, nearly as formless and muddled as the self-titled trainwreck they released last year. There are improvements to be found on the band's sophomore disc, certainly-- vocalist Darren Zoltowski is only inhumanely irritating on a couple of songs, for instance-- but by and large, it's the same old dreck. Guitars that should be delivering incisive solos wander aimlessly, searching for melodic contour (this time with more delay!), and a competent rhythm section wastes itself backing a band that forgets to write a melody every time. Zoltowski has mellowed considerably in the year since The Suntanama debuted on an unsuspecting world-- last year's model was an entirely unintelligible, gravel-throated bleat; this year, he's settled down to the point where he's almost gotten around to singing real melodies, and even reaches for a Bob Dylan bark at times, usually even pronouncing the words he's singing. The band also works itself into enough of a focused frenzy at the end of ""The 3 of 3's"" that his multitracked shouting sounds kind of good for a few seconds. The more I listen to these guys, the harder it gets to tell if their ineptitude is unintentional or calculated-- they seem almost afraid of riffs and hooks, and the way they run away from anything interesting that starts to arise from their listless jamming makes it feel like some post-ironic joke only the band is in on. While Another isn't quite as horrific as their first album, it's only marginally better, and just as forgettable.","If it's not from the South and it doesn't rock, can you still call it Southern Rock?

Halve Maen,Double Leopards,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb48ea9e61561daa71dd/1:1/w_160/127d5c3d.gif,2003-09-15 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2513-halve-maen/,EclipseEclipse,"Nigh on a decade, I have been trying to figure out what the fuck I took that fateful night. Cloyingly labeled as a ""pharmaceutical hallucinogen,"" a handful of pills opened portals to the most intense, frighteningly realistic phantasms I've ever experienced. One symptom of overdose, as the Pharmaceutical Handbook explained so succinctly the morning after, was that every electrical appliance malfunctioned in my presence: the LCD displays on my watch and alarm clock were helpless brambles of blinking bars of broken time. The carpet breathed and rippled its fibers. The walls sweated. I continually had the physical sensation of having something clenched in my grip, yet looking down, my hands were always empty. I bring this trip up because I think the Double Leopards (Mike, Maya, Marcia, and Chris) might have ingested the same shit. At the very least, they show similar symptoms on their second album for Eclipse. Housed in a dark and heavy sleeve, replete with an Indian skull and foreboding forest branches, it opens into a gatefold that evokes a satellite dish-addicted Bridget Riley illusion. Halve Maen is sprawled across two heavy discs, the only format through which the finest, most oblique musical messages can properly be conveyed. I am tempted to shove this in alongside such shadowy double albums as Wickham & Young's Lake, The Dead C's Harsh 70s Reality, Charalambides' Market Square, and Twenty-Six's This Skin Is Rust, but even those gave you a little breathing room now and then; Halve Maen smothers all light from the get-go as it burrows into the bowels of the earth below. Very tactile from the first needle-drop, the everyday objects at the old loft space move of their own volition, at the edges of the feverish eyes. Household items like chord organs, plastic toys, and wind chimes suddenly lurch to the fore during ""The Fatal Affront"", before all the room's paraphernalia disintegrates into the more solemn and murky affair, ""Druid Spectre"". Here appears a drum more akin to the undead pounding at a cardboard door, somehow thudding along from beyond the grave with an elongated guitar. Side B gets swallowed by ""A Hemisphere in Your Hair"", which is time enough for a perm or other long scalp treatment. On this track, time is stretched and lulled until finally being rendered meaningless, and the listening brain is melted in slow undulations of sinewaves, primitive swirls of effects, bowed strings, prayer bowls, Melodica, and otherworldly drones. Small shivers of cricket-like feedback rise and fall with the slow, labored breathing of the beast, as if the inhaled pink goo from The Abyss were replaced with Graffix bong scrapings. The rattles that arise nearer the center of the spindle give the proceedings the woozy feel of an ancient ceremony coming to an end. Turns out we're only halfway there, though, and from this point forth, the travail gets veritably muddy, the group dynamic verging on unconsciousness. Discombobulation and a heavy, pervasive dread of being very lost permeates this record. ""The Forest Outlaws"" spins the tape, mid-séance, into a paralyzing bout of self-inflicted ether damage. A blustery white-noise wind blows through the bundled layers of guitar and organ, freezing up the gears on the Leopards' zamboni right at the inner-circle of the inferno, where it's always most frigid and frightening. The last side is given over to ""The Secret Correspondence 1 & 2"", plopping us into the vertiginous tides of the Dead Sea, where the silty, unseen bottom is stirred up something fierce. Cymbals are struck but quickly sink below the briny waters. Tremors of ghostly orchestras are constantly conjured by the guitars, a mass grave of vindicative strings that howl and die only to be resurrected for the finale. The instruments and processed moans of the group commune with a far more surly and slurred spiritual world than previously glimpsed, heavily sedated and hovering with a menacing glint just at the threshold of sanity. As it all slips away at record's end, I'm left questioning the mental stability and half-life of this trip. What I believed to be firmly in my grasp slithered away, a disquieting residue left behind on my hands and in my eyes and ears. Overwhelming in its morose synesthesia and downright bleary at times, Halve Maen is like those little yellow pills I popped so long ago: Ingestion will definitely fuck you up.","To celebrate its overdue CD reissue, we revisit our 2003 review of the drone rock gem Halve Maen.

Only With Laughter Can You Win,Rosie Thomas,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7879d034d5c69bf3806/1:1/w_160/b207c1df.jpg,2003-09-15 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8021-only-with-laughter-can-you-win/,Sub Pop,"All Yankee Hotel Foxtrot squealing aside, it's never a particularly promising sign when the peripheral circumstances surrounding a record begin to supercede the actual songs, and crooner Rosie Thomas has enough well-documented, extraneous quirks to distract just about anyone from the song-to-song content of her sophomore album. It started in 2002, when Thomas' debut, When We Were Small, inadvertently introduced the world to her adjacent career as a stand-up comic with a Kaufman-esque alter ego named Shelia; Shelia takes the form of a seriously bespectacled and neck-braced pizza delivery woman, self-consciously dorky and entirely outside the scope of typical singer/songwriter shenanigans (Shelia even has her very own cover band, Strawberry Jam). Presumably, the idiosyncratic pretension of Thomas' ""Shelia"" is perplexing enough to balance out her internal artistic palette-- because the other, singer/songwriter half of Thomas' creative repertoire is almost painfully straightforward and, incidentally, not the slightest bit funny. Check the underwhelming realization that once you tear the external oddities away from Thomas' career, you will also watch all the intrigue slowly seeping out. Conversely, Only With Laughter actually becomes sorta interesting, simply because it's so intensely benign within the context of Rosie Thomas, Performer. It's not that the album isn't a solidly crafted, fully realized work: Only With Laughter Can You Win is delicately assembled and impeccably sung, all sweet, earnest folk and peaceably strummed acoustic guitar. It's just that the record is pure Joni Mitchell-but-not, a heartbreakingly predictable singer/songwriter collection with every requisite part in place, and not a single surprise: shine some Lilith Fair folk-rock through an indie lens, add some overtly sentimental verses and a rose-littered cover, record it inside a historic church in Detroit (St. John's, which, like, of course dates back to 1860), and see Rosie Thomas emerge, understated and introspective, singing lots of sad and pretty songs. The formula here is pretty clear-cut: tinkling piano, barely-there drums, strummy guitar, and Thomas' expressive, padded whispers relaying all her earnestly held secrets, fears, and dreams. ""I Play Music"" sees Thomas' mother, father, sister, and brothers harmonizing along with her (the subsequent chorus is full, pleasant, and lilting, but also just precious enough to make some folks cough on their chamomile tea), while ""Crazy"", Thomas' swan song to confusion (""Crazy/ Crazy is what they've all said/ Craziness lives in my head/ Craziness lies in my bed"") sees her solo vocals at their expressive best. Enjoyment of Only With Laughter seems inextricably hinged on how high your threshold is for this kind of thing-- despite being a nice showcase for Thomas' clear, pitch-perfect coo and soft-songwriting knack, the record is exhaustively familiar, offering up all the gentle greatness of folkies past, but refusing to impose its own reinterpretations.","All Yankee Hotel Foxtrot squealing aside, it's never a particularly promising sign when the peripheral circumstances surrounding a record ...

"Revolutionary, Vol. 2",Immortal Technique,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b996eb335119a49ec801/1:1/w_160/bcde5b22.jpg,2003-09-15 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4146-revolutionary-vol-2/,Viper,"Rising from the Public Enemy phoenix that bore Mr. Lif, Dead Prez and The Coup, Immortal Technique borrows elements of the previously mentioned artists, along with rhyming capabilities reminiscent of Ras Kass and Canibus. Now, with the release of his second politically charged mission statement, Revolutionary Vol. 2, his gruff Latin baritone and powerful delivery have thrust him into the fortunate position of being a potential ""next big thing."" Born in a military hospital in South America and sent to jail for more than a year for an altercation with a white man, IT's hoodlum mentality seems slightly more authentic than most anyone else in the underground (baring Bumpy Knuckles). Referencing biblical passages with the emotion of someone who reads and believes them (unlike Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks), IT is somehow believable in his radical position. Whether rapping about the dark atmosphere of his adopted hometown (""Harlem Streets""), questioning the true nature of the artist's voice (""Freedom of Speech""), airing his issues with the media (""The 4th Branch"") or simply claiming to be ""the best of both worlds/ Without the hidden camera and the 12-year-old girl"" (""Obnoxious""), Immortal Technique's magnetic delivery makes every song a joy to listen to. Criticizing critics, coffee shop revolutionaries, Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, John Ashcroft and George W. Bush, Technique delivers his message with a more commercially palatable hip-hop approach than Mr. Lif, if with less tact and subtlety. A standout track is the mic-passing drug narrative ""Peruvian Cocaine"". Featuring Pumpkinhead, Diabolic and Poison Pen, among others, each rapper takes the place of someone different in the drug trafficking industry. From field worker to drug dealer to government official, each character expounds upon a common topic in one of the most excellent collaborations this side of the hip-hop world. The best verses come from the greatest flow in underground hip-hop, Tonedeff (""Come on, our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats/ The hungry stolen of their souls, of course this country's running coke""), and the newest Def Jukie, C-Rayz Walz (""So enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread/ Soon, you'll be in the cell with me like Jenny Lopez""). The only downside to Immortal's myriad song styles is the lack of charisma contained in his battle incarnation. On a song like ""Obnoxious"", meant to break the ice and display an IT track that you (yes, you) can put on at a party without being dragged behind a truck, he sounds ridiculously awkward. With a lame ""We keepin' it live!"" refrain, a relatively boring saloon boom-bap beat and an uninteresting ""Wanksta""-parodying third verse, his obvious crossover cut (dope lyrics withstanding) fails at its purpose. Unfortunately for Mr. Technique, the beats (Beat Bandits, Domingo, Omen, Southpaw) are hit-and-miss, running the gamut from the subtle, watery acoustic guitar and disturbingly common drums of ""The 4th Branch"" to the addictive, bouncy Beatnuts-styled romp of ""Freedom of Speech"" to the unpleasant electronic chimes and hues of ""The Cause of Death"". More often than not, the drums end up sounding out of place on the chosen sample or the samples themselves sound cheap. Most of the time, the backdrops are simply overpowered by Technique's voice. Suffice to say, this Public Enemy clearly does not have a Bomb Squad behind him. Still, with Roc Raida, Jean Grae, Akir, and political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal (!) aiding their voices (and scratches) to this album, and his own worthwhile vocal presence adding another soldier to the political emcee barracks, Immortal Technique's second album is a testament to the power of the independent voice in music. Although he tends to go overboard with the violent braggadocio (""Fuck you/ I hope someone you love dies""), could cut back on the skits and random shit-talking, and tighten up the production, his message still breaks through the issues to prove him one of the most promising new emcees in underground hip-hop.","Rising from the Public Enemy phoenix that bore Mr. Lif, Dead Prez and The Coup, Immortal Technique borrows elements of ...

Vaudeville Villain,Viktor Vaughn,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98aea9e61561daa5a56/1:1/w_160/90593473.jpg,2003-09-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8514-vaudeville-villain/,Sound Ink,"MF Doom is an ever-evolving oddity. Since starting his career spouting bouncy, Brand Nubian-esque black power verses with his late brother Subroc and rapper Onyx in the collective KMD, Daniel Dumile has gained weight, smoked hallucinogens, drank libations, and developed a new style to match his rapidly deteriorating voice. Now, in a new arena of arrhythmia and soft beats, MF Doom staggers into a telephone booth somewhere underground and falls out as Viktor Vaughn. A joint project between Doom and Sound-Ink, Vaudeville Villain's storyline follows the everyday life of super-villain/beat scientist/drug dealer/stick-up kid Vik Vaughn. Not surprisingly, it plays out much like any other Metal Face project: Doom's sick flow is tied to a fractured cadence, a slurry, guttural delivery, obscure pop culture references (""Unfrozen caveman, look over the contracts"") and beautifully simple idioms and metaphors. Although best known for his more whimsical material, this album has Doom frequently coming off like Wu without the pretension, branching out into more evolved song structures (choruses!) and unusually focused topical and narrative tracks. The pieces here run a larger gamut of topics than the shit-talking he mastered on Operation: Doomsday. Situations faced by our favorite masked rhymer this side of '93 Ghostface include the courtship of an underage girl (""Let Me Watch"" with Apani B. Fly Emcee), a drug deal gone horribly awry (""Lactose and Lecithin""), an argument with a Chinese restaurant owner (""Raedawn"") and the hilarious gunning down of a lame open mic night. While most underground emcees are content to rhyme about their intelligence, the evils of commercialism, and the general populace's lack of cognizance, Vik finds the perfect balance between complex songs and simple delivery, never hitting you with guilt trips or preaching to the choir. There's no exaggeration made when you hear someone referring to Metal Face as one of the best writers in rap: ""Modern Day Mugging"" has Doom turning a tired theme like, well, robbing people from a ghetto cliché into a comedic spectacle, delivering a how-to for all aspiring thugs and thugettes: He only carries a .45 with ""no bullets, no clip"" that has ""black electrical tape over the hole in the handle"" but still manages to cause a fellow citizen to ""run his chain like an errand."" After detailing clever break-in methods, he plays the fall guy, getting shot by one of his elderly victims and claiming that he ""woulda let her have it if he had the ammo."" In another example of Dumile's pen prowess, he teams up with former Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesayer M. Saayid for a cartoonish recollection of their education (""Never Dead""). Doom claims, ""If I don't study, I'ma cheat off Peter Parker,"" and then teams up with schoolmate Saayid to run and gun on a search for Doom's stolen Donkey Kong game. Throughout the course of the song, they buy fireworks and indulge in Guyanese strippers in Chinatown, and Doom finds a guru who teaches him ""that the roach is never dead,"" hypothetically cultivating the future super scientist on which this album is based. Songwriting doesn't often come this lush, detail-minded or captivating in hip-hop these days, but it's no surprise that the best songs in the genre are coming from an 80s transplant that claims to be ""a really big fan of Dan Aykroyd."" As expected on an album from one of the current greats, the soundscapes on Vaudeville Villain fail to keep pace with the classic lines being dropped left and right. This is Doom's first album consisting entirely of guest productions, and it quickly becomes apparent that he sounds better over his own work. Relatively unknown producers King Honey, Max Bill, and Heat Sensor offer a cohesive sound, but fail to really hit on a mood that suits Doom's drunken master assault. But there are moments where it all comes together brilliantly: Heat Sensor's ""Raedawn"" is an electronic burner that writhes and lurches like a malfunctioning robot, stuttering out from of a pit of molten drums and sinister bells. King Honey's ""Let Me Watch"" is a pier-walking rock-skip across the ocean, equipped with a lumbering, Prince Paul-ish jazz loop and bassline. Rjd2 also drops by with the album's showstopper: ""Saliva"" delivers a triumphant string section, jubilant vocal sample, and bombastic horns across a subtle breakbeat backdrop. Despite its admittedly slight flaws, Vaudeville Villain goes head-to-head with Doom's other 2003 project, King Geedorah's Take Me to Your Leader, for what stands as the hip-hop album of the year thus far. Unless his collaboration with Madlib (MadVillain) or his official MF Doom LP on Rhymesayers prove to be flawless ventures, this album will come out not just among the year's greatest, but also among the best in his catalog.","MF Doom is an ever-evolving oddity.

21st Century Toy,Electronicat,by: Bob O.

Sure, the Parisian electronica scene had its moment in the late 90s, with Daft Punk, Air, Cassius, et al, producing worthy, if not groundbreaking, material, but who from those long-gone days of healthy Franco-American relations has released anything in years truly worth scuffing your retro Jordans over? And while I'm at it, why does every critic with a guilty American conscience feel it necessary to play Lucky Pierre to any couple of Parisian (ahem) assholes with a 606 emulator? Wake the fuck up, dudes. Mirwais and Black Strobe haven't released any material much more substantial than your average coke-nosed electroclasher. So here comes this Electronicat character, sauntering in to impress we Yanks with another set of guitar-rocking electro. Thing is, the deafening hype accompanying virtually every single goddam dance-rock record released is starting to chafe, y'all-- it's time to charge ahead and accept that the looks-like-it-might-be-here-to-stay genre is already starting to excrete its share of sewage. The steamer in front of me, 21st Century Toy, comes courtesy of one Fred Bigot, a proud Frenchman with a predictably tired nom de punk that all but explains why he couldn't come up with a better recording alias than ""Electronicat."" Much of the frustration here derives from the album's asinine simplicity. I'm not saying all electronica needs to be complex-- see Casiotone for the Painfully Alone as an example of wrenching the most out of minimal gear and production, but it's, what, 2003, and hammering endlessly at the same distorted synth tone for an hour isn't gonna win anybody new friends. Channeling the glam era on opener ""Tonight"", Bigot's vocals come off like a second-rate J Spacemen, fresh off the gear and just not fucking handling his shit. ""Tonight"" introduces a shrill, off-key synth midway through that mixes things up a bit, but for the most part, the track's Bolanist stance is about as good as things get. ""Frisco Bay"" sets sub-Casio-preset backing to Digifuckery101 knob-twiddling, irritating female backing vocals, and some of the worst lyrics I've heard this year. (I'd quote them but I seriously can't put myself through it.) The ""best"" track here, ""Hoo Woo Woo"", evokes only the empty sentiment of its title; the worst, ""Till I Die"", is a mindless three-fingers-on-a-keyboard ditty notable only for the outrageous gall it had to lift its title from one of Brian Wilson's final masterpieces. Electronicat would probably appreciate if 21st Century Toy was noticed by the hungry masses for its disco-cum-Nuggets hero worship. But while champions of the record (may you all burn in hell) might endorse its 60s-revivalist rock influence as a welcome change from the early 80s-leaning post-punk most commonly associated with rock-dance unions, the fact is, there's a reason the latter period synchronizes so well with modern electronic production-- most of the post-punk bands invoked in the rock element of the equation already had more than a trace of funk injected into their icy artsiness. Compared to the Rapture or !!!, this stuff just doesn't cut the filthy-smelling cheese Bigot surely enjoys after a grueling two hours' work in the studio. I'm sure plenty of folks will congratulate themselves for being so fucking cool while listening to this record, but I must admonish you, young hipster: When it comes to getting your dance-punk freak on, buy American.","I sure as shit don't jibe with King George II's hardline on Euro pacifism, but what's the ...

Black Lava,A Trillion Barnacle Lapse,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17313d1975652138631/1:1/w_160/3ad60a7d.gif,2003-09-14 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/405-black-lava/,Sound Virus,"A Trillion Barnacle Lapse has gotten so much right on their second album that I'd like to first get some of my more pressing concerns about its few faults out in the open. First, the name: ""A Trillion Barnacle Lapse"" sounds like it was on special from Cedric Bixler's catalog of meaningless non-sequitur bullshit, and is the sort of name likely to get your record laughed at and then not bought. In fact, I'll go on record as saying that any bandname with ""barnacle"" in it is practically pleading to be ignored; I don't care if you're from Rhode Island (where there are at least two barnacles for every man, woman, and child, I'm told by reliable sources, but certainly not a trillion). Second, no matter how good it sounds, any American who tries to sound British when singing is subconsciously asking to be beaten up. Even Bob Pollard; that he managed to build a career on this is still one of the most enduring enigmas in rock. But I digress-- having purged the, like, negative energy from my aura, I can get back to the business at hand: giving this Rhode Island five-piece a fraction of the praise they deserve. It's a testament to the solidity of Black Lava that the biggest complaints I can muster concern silly, superficial vagaries; ATBL have the rare skill to nakedly assimilate their direct sonic ancestors, succumb to a little bit of posing excess, and still come out way ahead. It might sound needlessly dismissive to say that ATBL is barely more than The Faint as fronted by Mark E. Smith, but while the combination may be structurally facile, it's also entirely ingenious, and the description is apt. The Faint's synth-heavy electro melodrama is tempered perfectly by a monotonous, droning sneer worthy of the acclaimed Fall frontman, creating a truly schizophrenic album. The vocals struggle constantly with bipolar backing arrangements of vintage blips and bleeps and hollowed-out piano rolls, guitars that fall in sheets in time with pulsing, breakneck rhythms, always too subdued for the periods of turmoil, too accusatory, too coldly commanding for the moments of docility. The songs should suffer for this incongruity, but the effect is entirely the opposite; the music/vocal interweaving is almost humbling. It's the distinct sensation of feeling alone in a crowd; keeping pace, moving in sync, but never quite blending in. Ultra-minimal, Joy Division-esque bass steers ""Binary Roulette"" through countless tempo shifts and melodies as the rest of the instrumentation pulls in all directions simultaneously with irresistible, restless force. The steady, spitspoken vocals could offer an anchor, but instead stand apart from the chaos, watching the spiraling descent with measured indifference. The music is entirely tangential; when it becomes too loud, it's simply shouted down. The lyrics themselves are graphic to the point of dehumanization-- ""Little girls should/ Grow up to be/ Feminine-heterosexual/ With babies""-- and clinical to the point of sterility in a strangely personal tale of gender ambiguity. ""With the heat of his hand/ He erased/ One leg of one 'X.'"" The abstract is later broadened, reduced to the purely literal, forever holding the listener at arm's length with one hand while beckoning with the other. As long as the vocal/music interplay is in effect, Black Lava is nothing short of amazing, but against the advice of counsel, they occasionally try to pretend that this dynamic isn't the core of the band and coast on instrumentals. ""Beowulf... King of the Anglosaxons"" and ""Iron Lung"" could stand to make bigger impressions; without a combative vocal melody to wrestle with, the musical backing is relatively impotent. These are fortunately brief, though; the fact is, solo vocals would fall just as flat. It's the conflict that drives ATBL; all the odd affectations they adopt threaten to push the drama to emo-ish heights at times, but they always overcome. If they can beat that name, nothing will stand in their way.","A Trillion Barnacle Lapse has gotten so much right on their second album that I'd like to first get ...

Scorpio Rising,Death in Vegas,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e013d197565213976c/1:1/w_160/c586b355.jpg,2003-09-14 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2235-scorpio-rising/,Sanctuary,"Much ado is being made lately about rock bands masquerading as electronic acts. From Radiohead's voyages into squiggly experimentation and beatmongering, to the current Rapture school of hiring producers to apply a timely lacquer of club sauce, such acts are celebrated for their admirable attempts at forward-thinking. But what of the inverse-- the electronic acts giving rock music a whirl? Is this equally inspired genre hopscotch, or musical devolution? Well, I'm sure it could qualify as either, depending on what the artists achieve, but for Death in Vegas, it's the latter. Adhering to what must be formal guidelines set by the electronic music industry, Death in Vegas exist as a duo, and have ever since the height of the electronic boom in the mid-to-late 1990s. The band made their American name with the Woodstock-sampling, K-Tel Lost Hits of the Alternative Era candidate ""Dirt"" back in 1997 (the video was much more interesting than the song), but from there, they attempted a more hybridized sound-- 1999's The Contino Sessions took aim at territory mapped by Primal Scream earlier in the decade. Scorpio Rising continues along that asymptote towards a supposed ""organic"" sound, going light on the laptop and heavy on the relics of yesteryear: drums, basses, and guitars. In fact, if not for Death in Vegas' faceless DJ anonymity and a couple of characteristic electronic facets (the implementation of a few choice samples; a roster of Brit-centric celebrity guest vocalists including Paul Weller, Hope Sandoval, and Liam Gallagher), one might assume that the outfit responsible for this album was just a band with a hefty case of NME-approved 60s psych nostalgia. Which makes sense: If psychedelic rock begat the trance/dance of the 90s rave scene, it's not much of a stretch to figure that Death in Vegas would naturally come out sounding pretty Summer of Love if given the Altered States treatment. Brother Liam's appearance on the title track might as well be subtitled ""Setting Sun Pt. 2"", placing Gallagher in a comfortable zone of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" drum loops and backwards guitar. It's familiar, right down to the awful lyrics (""I wanna go to heaven, never been there before""), but refreshingly direct-- closer to Definitely Maybe form than the pretentious bloat of recent Oasis. Elsewhere, Paul Weller gets a paisley backdrop of his own, lending a chesty vocal to ""If You Say You Lost Your Baby"" that does well to approximate a roided-up Forever Changes, while slower material engages in grandiose displays of Indian-inflected orchestration, conducted by the mysteriously Bond-villain-sounding Dr. Subramaniam. Two of these (the banjo-and-mandolin-contrasted ""Killing Suite"" and the droning ""Help Yourself"") feature former Mazzy Star crooner Hope Sandoval, and your appreciation of such is probably directly proportional to your nostalgia for ""Fade Into You""-type atmospheric noir. It's telling, of course, that the most appealing track on Scorpio Rising is what appears to be the token handout to the dance world: a slice of straight electro called ""Hands Around My Throat"" that samples Tortoise and also, somehow, ""Rock Around the Clock"". With much of the rock arrangements ill-suited to Death in Vegas' club-honed compositional sensibilities, tracks like ""Leather"" and ""Girls"" striking a groove but never fully cresting, the stiff rhythms and deadpan delivery (from Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus) of ""Hands Around My Throat"" are well supported, rather than overwhelmed, by some additive live drumming and clanging guitar. So while the two hearts of Death in Vegas are firmly in the right place, given that some of the biggest electronic hits have been from DJs hewing their sound to a rock standard, the execution is ultimately flawed. Perhaps the duo is just second-tier to begin with, or perhaps they just let the needle swing too far towards the rock side of the dial, but the peak moments on Scorpio Rising offer little more than enjoyable nostalgia for overhead-projector light shows. It may be no more embarrassing than any of the rock-band-in-electronic-clothes attempts sure to be thrust upon us in the coming months, but it's clear Death in Vegas don't have the recipe to the magic rock/electronic stew we've all been told to save our dancefloor moves for.","Much ado is being made lately about rock bands masquerading as electronic acts.

The Sea and The Rhythm EP,Iron & Wine,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b983c0084474cd0c2619/1:1/w_160/0b483939.jpg,2003-09-14 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4125-the-sea-and-the-rhythm-ep/,Sub Pop,"It struck everyone as a little weird that Sub Pop would be the one to issue Sam Beam's hushed folk debut. From a distance, Beam's lo-fi compositions sounded like a Harry Smith field recording plucked away by Nick Drake with Crosby, Stills & Nash on backup. But close up it was all about the poetry: concrete, ambiguous, and laced with tender irony. Since Beam compares himself to J.J. Cale, and I'd even compare his lyrical style to Beck's Apollinaire-grade symbolism on Mutations, maybe it's not so weird that he's on Nirvana's label after all. ""I think I work with the visual a lot when I write,"" the part-time musician and full-time Miami film teacher once said. And The Creek Drank the Cradle was unabashedly concrete, studded with disarming pick-up lines like, ""The water's there to warm you/ And the earth is warmer/ When you laugh,"" and, ""Needlework and seedlings/ In the way you're walking."" Its songs also sank into little moments still warm with loss-- small enough to get inside you, but general enough to fill you with an after-the-fact numbness recognizable as love. Mothers lost sons, daughters lost fathers, lovers lost love, and each song somehow contained a bit of each. Strikingly, the singers on The Creek Drank the Cradle keep losing their religion, too: outgrowing the bonds of belief, losing their fear of the Lord, letting their mothers' bibles burn. One of them even looks back to see a long-extinct love as a kind of unrecoverable faith: ""Found your rosary broken to pieces/ Every night by the bed you'd kiss the beads."" Still, the crucifixion is the greatest myth of loss we have, and it's no shock that a lyricist soaked in southern allegory should adapt it for his own purposes. There's even a defiantly un-Christian ring to resurrection one-liners like, ""Frozen, the ground refused to die/ And the guitar rose again."" But while the textures, tempos, and diction of the five short songs on The Sea & The Rhythm EP are consistent with what Iron & Wine has been-- and probably will always be-- the theme of loss has itself gone. In its place, Beam pushes trembling expectation, ecstatic abandon, and plain-faced repentance. Now, not one of these faded songs screams old-time religion, but it seems fair to wonder if there is a little revival going on here. ""Beneath the Balcony"" is a loping folk ballad telling the grim story of a warrior reduced to begging while some kids wait out a storm and ""make sure the king won't grant the dead man one more day."" At this point, it's an ambiguous parable with a crypto-Christian vibe worthy of C.S. Lewis. But when the Mother Mary appears begging with Christ on her lap, there's no question we're dealing with a gospel story. The song ends with a kid crouched behind a garbage can ""who waits for the king to come/ And holds his sweating hand."" Salvation, anyone? The super-sweet title track, a hymn to sensual connection, is driven by its rare present-tense setting, but still sags. It draws its force from an ambiguity (is the ""we"" here lover/lover or mother/infant?) all a little too cheaply bought by come-ons like, ""The milk from your breast is on my lips."" Maybe the singer gets off by playing baby Jesus with grown women. Or maybe I just had to get a Jesus reference in for every song. At least I won't have to try for the last two. The next track is a parable of sin and redemption masquerading as a nursery rhyme. Some Mexican kid-- called, you guessed it, Jesus-- was born in a truck on the fourth of July. A mobile manger for an American nativity scene. With fireworks blooming above like a star in the East, this selfless little immigrant gives the singer the best playing card in his grubby little deck. Such a pure act opens a space for Beam's trademark muffled irony, the kind of brutal understatement common on the LP but up to now absent on this EP: ""He never wanted nothing I remember/ Maybe a broken bottle if I had two."" Jesus covers for the singer, lets him break a five-dollar bet, and generally assumes his sins. Then, in an oddly specific twist, when the singer succumbs to temptation by secretly eloping to Vegas with Jesus' sister, the beatific child-god is there to greet them: ""Naked, the Judas in me/ Fell by the tracks but he lifted me high/ Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why."" Unmistakably salvific. The last track goes down easy but is extremely hard to digest. ""Someday the Waves"" opens with a man waking at dawn to look down on his lover's face in wonder. The chorus seems like a sober display of faithfulness (""You pick a place that's where I'll be"") until some cryptic and perverse forbearance slips in, Matthew-style: ""Time, like your cheek, has turned for me."" This could mean a number of things: the singer is marking time by his sleeping lover's tossing and turning; the lover's pallid complexion means the singer is running out of time; or, as the lover has patiently taken a beating, the singer has simply gotten older. The next verse promises a pie-in-the-sky day of redemption when ""every aching old machine will feel no pain,"" but neglects to follow through with a credible image of relief. It's the last verse that adds an oddly appropriate twist: ""Waking before you I'm like the Lord/ Who sees his love though we don't know."" Sure, it's a simile, but if you think about it, Sam Beam would make a great Holy Spirit. With a full-length album out by next Easter, he's got this Jew's vote for American Jesus in 2004.","It struck everyone as a little weird that Sub Pop would be the one to issue Sam Beam's hushed ...

These Are the Vistas,The Bad Plus,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42c9d034d5c69bf2fd6/1:1/w_160/e45548fe.jpg,2003-09-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1074-these-are-the-vistas/,Columbia,"The problem with jazz is... well, I'm not exactly sure. I can tell you that I'm getting tired of opening jazz reviews with a survey of the genre's problems. In the end, it's probably no worse off than any other music predating rock and roll, and that it at least still has a Grammy category should be encouraging. Perhaps the only real problem is that big labels have a tough time marketing it (see if you can name any one of Billboard's current Top 40 jazz albums). However, unlike, say, contemporary polka (also a tough sell, especially in our war-torn economy), people are still making interesting, creative statements in jazz. For experimental music listeners, jazz is probably as vibrant now as it ever was. You just have to live with a dimmer spotlight, if that matters. And so, along comes The Bad Plus, from the heart of the Midwest, and with big Columbia dollars paying for their hotels and, presumably, Blender blurbs. They have the shiny blue CD cover, have snagged Sheryl Crow and Tom Waits' producer, get in-store promotion at Tower and Borders, and press releases that-- wouldn't you know it-- herald them as jazz's saviors! Of course, none of this really covers the various musical contributions that pianist Ethan Iverson, bassist Reid Anderson, and drummer David King (a member of the Minneapolis jazz combo Happy Apple, and replacement drummer for the legendary Christopher McGuire in 12 Rods) may have made to their own record. As you probably shouldn't be surprised to know, their press hasn't really done them too many favors except to garner them raves from the NPR and Good Morning America crowd. The three members of The Bad Plus, hailing from Minnesota and Wisconsin, have been playing together off and on since the early 1990s. They released their self-titled debut in 2001 independently, and had a follow-up available last year (now out of print), recorded live at the Village Vanguard. They've steadily built a following of fervent jazz fans and alert critics, though are likely as surprised at their exposure this year as anyone. These Are the Vistas, beyond the production and fanfare, is pretty squarely along the lines of much new, young straight-ahead jazz: integrated use of new beats and electronic music touches, covers of various Gen-X hits, and the will to sporadically launch brief, free improv blowing sessions. Naturally, those sessions are much fewer and farther between than your average Tim Berne disc, but then again, Columbia doesn't invest in 20-minute Bloodcount tunes for a reason. First, the covers: supposedly pianist Iverson had never heard the song previously (only in Wisconsin, folks), but the trio's rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is, er, spirited. Iverson favors broad, dramatic chord clusters and liberal use of his sustain pedal, so instead of ragged rock glory, we get faux-cinematic\ grandeur. Anderson does a nice Ron Carter impression underneath, linking the performance to what must have been a big inspiration for them: Miles Davis' mid-60s similarly eccentric quintet. They hit Aphex Twin's ""Flim"" with kid gloves, almost too delicately. Producer Tchad Blake incorporates a few filters to make King's drums sound computerized, but it's my feeling that you can't really hide a jazz band. Their version of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" is probably the most ambitious song on the entire record, if only because they try out about three completely different moods before arriving at the song proper. I'm not so sure they're as convincing way out there as they are straight up, but points for giving it a go. The Bad Plus is at their best when they step out of the jazz chair entirely, as on the marvelously kinetic ""Big Eater"", which opens the album. King is an amazing drummer, certainly a treat for anyone loving modern jazz percussionists like Ben Perowsky, Kenny Wollesen or Jim Black, and his performance on Anderson's piece is fantastically, aggressively precise. Likewise, Iverson's block chords, serving as melody, are straight out of the great-lost post-rock riff book, and would undoubtedly make Tom Jenkinson mighty jealous. If only they could keep up that intensity throughout, as other tunes seem either flat homages to the avant-garde (""Boo-Wah""), or small-group MOR jazz balladry (""Silence is the Question"")-- though there is a download-only ballad titled ""What Love is This"" that's a lot more engaging than most of the ones here. Marketing aside, I wouldn't be surprised to see The Bad Plus become pretty successful. They have a knack for hitting the melody where some more experimental outfits might opt for a diverse array of craziness. The three performers are also very good musicians (particularly King and Anderson), and I imagine they put on a good show. It's not their fault some record company guy thought they could be the new face of jazz, so I'd urge hipsters to keep an open ear, and everyone else not to expect fireworks. Hey, it could be worse-- you know Elvis Costello is giving Diana Krall Mitchell Froom's number.","The problem with jazz is... well, I'm not exactly sure. I can tell you that I'm getting tired ...

I don't envy them this task, attempting to keep the MTV generation from mentally wandering afield while they build their dense, slowly shifting textures from the ground up, relying only on slowly morphing dynamics to provide interest without any of the instant gratification provided by, say, melodies or riffs. Music like this is an old story by now-- it's the same formula Mogwai used to make your blood rush on Young Team, and the one King Crimson used to make your blood curdle on Starless & Bible Black. And while the San Francisco foursome never approach the heights those bands have ascended, they've played the law of averages for seven albums now to see if they one day might. At this juncture, it seems that's a losing proposition, but you'd never know it from Also Rising's portentous opening moments. ""The Harsh Facts of Life"" lopes in on a percolating bassline and live drumbeat that might make a great hip-hop sample while spewing forth huge clouds of droning, e-bowed laser guitar and whipping up an ominous buzz that appears to come from all directions at once. Where things go wrong from there is that there's no drama, no true climax to quicken your pulse-- rather, the beat gradually becomes choppier and the whole song downshifts in rhythmic intensity, dissolving into a fuzz-addled mudbath that doesn't fully wash off until a couple of tracks later. This is where it first becomes clear that this music is mostly improvised-- you can hear the band trying to feel each other and anticipate the next move, but winding up following one another instead of shifting as a collective whole. The texture that's laid out on that first song remains essentially static throughout the album's duration-- e-bows rule the skies while Chris Van Huffel's drums blast out dry, punishing rhythm below. Changes are mostly in the details: a little phaser on the guitars, or more ride cymbal in the drums, and the only way you're going to truly hear all of the subtleties is to crank the volume to neighbor-baiting levels and listen closely. The only song that breaks the mold is ""Angel Food"", a drifting ambient wash bereft of percussion, all ethereal guitars processed beyond easy recognition-- it's not a coincidence that it's the best track on the album, as it's the only one fully suited by the drifting nature of the playing. In all honesty, Also Rising is bound to put all but the most patient, attentive listeners out faster than a keg of Nyquil. Improvised music, even music improvised within a strict framework, usually falls at some extreme of transcendence or listlessness, and this lies toward the second pole, a few notches better than listening to the neighborhood band jam in their practice space. The end result is all one color, and ultimately just another instrumental rock album littering the landscape.","Subarachnoid Space make long-attention-span rock for a short-attention-span world.

Captured Anthems for an Empty Bathtub,K.C.

My grandfather frequently threatened to rescind the myriad generous bestowals my sister and I were to receive upon his passing if he ever heard we'd cast a Democratic vote. Not a single female constituent in my family, from eight to eighty, dares miss Sunday's Service, and every bite on every plate is blessed before it's fit to ingest. And despite medical evidence to the contrary, my Naval Academy-bred stepfather insists that a postprandial workday glass of Merlot rather ""puts the edge on."" Not that I'm complaining; but at times I can't help but yearn for greener pastures. Maybe even just of a different shade. Enter K.C. Accidental, brother-in-law to Broken Social Scene, and first and second cousin to such venerable assemblies as Do Make Say Think and A Silver Mt. Zion. Alternating stints at the head of the table are Kevin Drew (of Do Make Say Think) and symphonious confederate Charles Spearin. But at this sonic banquet everyone has a voice (even though no one opts to use theirs to actually sing on this record), as fellow You Forgot It in People alum Evan Cranely, James Shaw, and Emily Haines have contributed to the band. As exhibited by the triumphant yet distinctive releases of this reputable sect, lineage doesn't necessitate a unilateral vision. While Captured Anthems for an Empty Bathtub retains several of the elements accountable for the ascendancy of You Forgot It in People, it's the nuanced digressions from this work that are worth noting. ""Nancy and the Girdle Boy"" storms out of the gate with fierce kit work and churning guitar, both of an immediacy much greater than anything on Broken Social Scene's latest. It's the most compact track on the album, but loosens in the end; like a chainsaw spinning down and shaking off the shavings. The rest of the album is several degrees less demonstrative. The post-rock homage ""We Wish We Lived in Chicago"" feels like an embryonic, if not slightly unwieldy, druggy jazz venture, and ""Anorexic He-Man"" harkens back to early Björk, employing a club-adaptive beat with almost trance-inducing persistence. The dogged bass feels like it's resonating in from a neighborhood dance party down the street, or from your little brother's speakers next door. At nine and twelve minutes respectively, ""Save the Last Breath"" and ""Tired Hands"" are truly accomplished utilizations of space and texture. The former casts out soft, light touches of piano, percussion, and guitar, almost as if the band is languidly waking up to the instruments they are themselves playing. The song takes a breath and exhales, releasing all the dreamy tension it unconsciously harbored. The latter number is a stark and stunning heart-on-sleeve realization with slowly constructed underpinnings of nervous energy that never escape, but merely claw and scratch and are finally stretched taut. There are small missteps along the way; by turns too obdurate to be deferential to the whole and too adherent to convention to be as sonically adventurous as the potential here warrants. The stock use of an answering machine on ""Kev's Message for Charlie"", though executed innovatively, disrupts the astral flow of the latter half of the album with unfortunate swiftness. These, however, are mere paltry dissatisfactions. With such a patient and often subtle offering, K.C. Accidental dance around the point a lot, but the glances in are glorious. Not utopian, but at least fraternal to a thoughtful, egalitarian degree, I might be looking to see if any of them are looking to adopt.","My nuclear family is gravely conservative; always has been.

After attending art school in New York, he spent five years in the 1980s playing with no-wave progressive Rhys Chatham and performing on most of the experimental legend's large-scale works, including 1987's Die Donnergotter. Brovold's own music takes an approach of massed guitars and blunt ambience that's similar to Chatham's, but over the course of four albums with Larval appears to be rooted in something much more straightforward: rock. Unlike virtually all the post-rock bands springing up three years in debt to Neu!, Brian Eno, and Miles Davis' In a Silent Way, Larval and Brovold opt for volumes suited for actual guitar players and beats Crazy Horse could love. It's not that their music is simple, but it's hardly as intimidating as their pedigree (avant-icon John Zorn is one of Larval's biggest fans, and released their first album as well as Brovold's 2001 solo album) might lead you to believe. ""Something Terrible is About to Happen"" wheezes by like a hobbled steamboat in brown, filmy water. Brovold has a knack for sickly textures, even when his band nudges the rock pedal-- and while I wouldn't say any of the tracks on Obedience are necessarily ugly, most of them revel in an earthy homeliness. Here, Kurt Zimmerman's violin repeats a simple, rhythmic figure that wouldn't sound out of place opening one of Godspeed's signature epics-- and indeed, the muffled drone of cello and guitar are very reminiscent of those Canadian radicals. ""Her Last Good Day"" also trades muscle for grace, but does away with dread. Chiming, major-chord guitar fills out most of the mix with sunny, sentimental shimmer while Marko Smith's slightly off-kilter drumming paints a different, almost tragicomic picture. Here more than anywhere else on the record, it's plainly evident that Larval would rather lend a more human presence to experimental rock than dazzle with electronic textures and virtuosic playing. Where Larval differ from a band like Tortoise (to whom they could be thought of as a distant, haggard uncle) is in their adherence to symphonic dynamics that predate most 90s-originated post-rock. Even though ""Something Terrible"" emphasizes the more hypnotic and repetitive aspects of their sound, Larval are more closely related to the post-apocalyptic impressionism of King Crimson (see ""The Talking Drum"") than the krautrock and minimalism strategies of newer bands. The good news for anyone who isn't quite ready to leap into the prog realm is that this band completely eschew solos, or any other flashy display of instrumental might. Like Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca, Larval are only too willing to sacrifice the glory of the individual for a tightly wound whole. My gripe with Obedience isn't really as much the music as it is the production, which doesn't always give these guys a fighting chance in an increasingly electronic realm. For people used to the relatively explosive (or alternately, pristine) sound of new avant-rock, Larval could sound on the quaint side-- or worse, flat. Nevertheless, perhaps through the power of persistence (the climax of ""One Day I Just Kept on Walking"" is fairly earth-shaking), they come out well. Here's hoping they're on the radar for folks looking for ambience with a spikier approach.","Bill Brovold formed Larval in Detroit in 1996, just as the post-rock boom was hitting its stride, and he actually ...

On the surface, Vol. II is very much of a piece with its predecessor, characterized by its by vast, quiet spaces, unhurried compositions, and an overall sense of dread and despair. The instrumental makeup is pretty much identical-- Connors is credited with guitars, tapes and sounds-- and Volume II seems very much like a continuation. But the details and proportions here have been shuffled, and if you get down and listen closely enough, this a different kind of record. The first thing you'll notice is that Connors spends a bit more time here on the ""tapes"" and ""sounds"" and a bit less on the guitar. Field recordings form the essential character of many tracks. The third track (no titles) has only a strum or two of guitar and mostly consists of what sounds like a recording of an abandoned field along the side of a busy highway. You can hear the wind through the long grass and the hum of traffic a little ways away, and can almost see the decade-old rusted cans and yellow newspaper scraps tangled in the scrubby underbrush. It's quite an evocative piece considering it was probably recorded on a random afternoon on a Walkman. The sixth track was recorded a bit further into the wilderness, across the woods and into the forest, and this time, at dawn, complete with a cooing mourning dove. The first track has a similarly rich ambient layer with a more industrial bent, but quiet and in the distance. And over the noise Connors layers his plucked, sustained, carefully laid notes. On the tracks without field recordings Departing of a Dream feels familiar. A melody tumbles from Connors' hands with hints of processing and wah-wah to make a tone that bubbles up from some waterlogged dream. Once again, Connors is a master of slow instrumental heartbreak, and if you're in the wrong mood, this record can actually be painful to listen to. The seventh track, for example, is a slow pan across a bombed-out landscape of emotional devastation, all gurgly tone, bent notes, and shapeless melody. The shorter eighth track, which closes this brief (31-minute) album, has a warmer, sunnier cast, which somehow makes things even worse. The suggestion of hope and renewal seems like a prelude to another shattering reality somewhere in the blurry future. If you're sad and anxious you have a friend in Loren Connors.

The New Romance,Pretty Girls Make Graves,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a125c0084474cd0bfd3c/1:1/w_160/df4f17f7.jpg,2003-09-11 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6464-the-new-romance/,Matador,"How is that terrible musicians are able to write incredible songs? And why can't technically competent musicians write songs as well as they can play their instruments? There are bands like The Kinks who-- let's face it-- were far from the most technically adept in their field, yet have somehow left behind some of the most timelessly enjoyable and imminently relevant rock music artifacts. Then there's a guy like Yngwie Malmsteen, whose technical proficiency exceeds that of every rock musician ever to exist-- maybe combined. And how many Alcatrazz records do you own? All too often, it seems technically proficient artists are their own worst enemies. Titillated by their own prowess, they compose music that showcases their chops but masks their humanity. It's a schtick that impresses but rarely inspires. There is a point, though, when some mathematically complex set of chords stops being impressed with itself and becomes a truly inspiring song, when a bushel of mind-numbing guitar riffs transcends its sonic masturbation and reaches an emotionally satisfying stratosphere. No one knows exactly where that point is, but we know when it's reached, and more importantly, we feel it when it's crossed. Pretty Girls Make Graves' latest, The New Romance, crosses that point. The album exists in that scarcely inhabited rock-and-roll world where technical prowess coexists peacefully with clear and simple songcraft, the former never forgoing the latter. Contrasting with Good Health's cut-to-the-chase opener ""Speakers Push the Air"", ""Something Bigger, Something Brighter"" opens deliberately and confidently. Nick DeWitt taps away at his snare rim, haunting its vague militancy with the cannon-like blast of his bass drum. Twin guitars trade high-strung lilts, panning from left to right with each call and response. For the sake of its title, the heretofore dark and subtle song does deliver something bigger and brighter: After an ominous dynamic increase, the band piles layers upon layers of beautiful, serpentine riffs. For all its tonal and rhythmic complexity, The New Romance breathes with healthy lungs and a muscular diaphragm. ""The Grandmother Wolf"" follows, a relentless parade of charged guitar lines that climax when DeWitt's drums go out with a whimper and vocalist Andrea Zollo sings an utterly breathtaking melody over sparse guitar punches. ""Mr. Club"" is a short transitional organ-and-drum piece that takes on immense significance with the entrance of a dark piano line that hints vaguely at what comes next. And what does come next is quite possibly the best rock song I've heard this year: ""All Medicated Geniuses"" is the pinnacle of Pretty Girls Make Graves' technical abilities and songwriting. Built upon a very subtle ring structure, each segment quadruples the intensity of the one before it. The guitars just scream here, trading lines back and forth across the pan. DeWitt proves well beyond doubt that he's one of indie rock's most talented drummers, and certainly one of only a handful these days who plays his kit as an instrument and not merely as a timepiece. ""Blue Lights"" adopts a post-rock approach, the band infusing more immediacy as the song builds to its climax. While it would be unfair to expect the lyrical charm of Dan Bejar or the clever wordplay of Colin Meloy from a band more interested in the aesthetics of rock than those of lyrics, it should be noted that ""Blue Lights"" sports unfortunately atrocious lyrics. Fortunately, ""Chemical Chemical"" quickly redeems the misstep, rivaling ""All Medicated Geniuses"" in intensity and structure, and maintaining the latter's visceral pull (if, perhaps, with less tonal depth). ""Holy Names"" is the closest of the album's songs that come to being classified a ballad. But while slower in tempo, there's certainly no lapse in intensity. The song builds for one part to a short-lived guitar scream reminiscent of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nic Zinner, and boasts one of album's most stunning moments. Soon after, the band jumps into the album's title track, prominently featuring a few fantastic organ lines and a killer B-part break, replete with Zollo's catchy vocal hook. The New Romance is immediately impressive and gratifying, each subsequent listen unearthing an increasing number of underlying subtleties. Each of Pretty Girls Make Graves' members have contributed 110% here, and their ambitious zeal, coupled with their remarkable technical depth, has made for a utterly breathtaking full-length. One could almost analyze The New Romance's many layers to the death, if the desire to air-guitar wasn't so damn distracting.","How is that terrible musicians are able to write incredible songs?

Crydamoure Presents Waves II,Archigram,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1745e6ef959693201b4/1:1/w_160/c67724c7.gif,2003-09-10 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/406-crydamoure-presents-waves-ii/,Astralwerks,"In his review of The Rapture's marvelous Echoes yesterday, Ryan Schreiber took to task rock's no-fun wing, arguing that indieland is experiencing a slow loosening of its staunch restrictions on enjoying music that engages any of the parts of one's body located below the neck. His point isn't simply about whether it's okay to dance at shows, but the recognition of a noticeable shift away from attitudes that automatically regard rhythm as subordinate to other quantitative musical values. In recent years, such attitudes pushed the beliefs that it was frivolous and fleeting for rock to engage with current technology or digital production, or that you can't have a good time listening to music unless your enjoyment is soaked in a million layers of irony. Even most of the big-name stars of leftfield rock such as Wayne Coyne, Björk, The Beta Band, or Radiohead sorted out that not much of that was true years ago, of course, but a lot of people in indieland are slow learners. For those riveted by Schreiber's stump who like the good old-fashioned dancing-- the clubbing kind-- comes the second compilation of underground house from the Crydamoure label, co-founded in 1996 by Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and fellow Parisian producer Eric Chédeville. Like 2000's Waves, this compiles the label's recent 12-inches, this time arranged by up-and-comers Archigram (Parisian duo Jean Morris and Nicolas Archyp). This may be French house, but don't expect either the more pop-structured works from Daft Punk or crossover disco-house such as semi-recent European hits from Modjo, Spiller, Tomcraft, or Jean-Jacques Smoothie. Not that it strays into Afro-Brazilian territory, either-- Waves II is an exuberant, mesmerizing set of classic French house and filter disco, built expressly for the clubs. It's therefore potentially exhausting for those who tend to find listening to this sort of thing a monolithic chore. The record's hypnotic rhythmic bliss is accented by some well-timed inclusions of guitars, strings, and horns. Vocals are kept to a minimum, highlighted by the breezy ooh-ooh's that float along Le Knight Club's delicate, high-pitched ""Nymphae Song"", Archigram's electro-house cover of The Stooges' ""I Wanna be Your Dog"" (""Doggystyle""), and Crydajam's ""If You Give Me the Love That I Want"", the set's one full-throated work. Every track was recorded within the past three years, many of them provided by the label boss' themselves: One or both them helped construct nine of the 15 songs. Archigram paces the set very well, mixing and dropping in all of their releases to date and showing up the label heads in the process. Archigram's contributions are highlighted by ""Carnaval"", which-- nestled at the heart of the set next to Le Knight Club's ""Soul Bells""-- is where the mix reaches toward greatness. A soaring, layered filter disco track, it blends delicate changes of pitch and washes of fuzzbox guitar over a thumping 4/4 beat. Waves II starts with nods to early more traditional, Salsoul-inspired house before segueing into tracks with more contemporary identifiers such as the liberal nods to nu-electro and even the use of electric guitar. On the whole, it's a stark contrast and a solid re-imagination of the genre, one that includes everything except the breezy, blissed-out Super Discount/Air model that in the U.S. was once synonymous with French house (the roots of which are on glorious display on Motorbass' recently reissued Pansoul). Waves II doesn't come close to matching the genre-stretching heights of de Homem-Christo's Daft Punk-- and, besides, it's a different approach to the sound altogether-- but it does provide a handy collection of the work of one of underground house's most vital labels.","In his review of The Rapture's marvelous Echoes yesterday, Ryan Schreiber took to task rock's no-fun\n\ wing ...

Lichter EP,The Notwist,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c434ea9e61561daa80cb/1:1/w_160/03d99ffb.gif,2003-09-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5846-lichter-ep/,Alien Transistor,"Hans-Christian Schmid's Lichter, which at the moment is enjoying the same massive underground media buzz that's always awarded to the young director's efforts, officially concerns ""two countries, two cities, one river: The Oder River not only separates the German city of Frankfurt from Slubice in Poland, it separates two different worlds from each other. Whether rich or poor, people try to seek their fortune there-- but often only find their limits."" The sound of broken dreams and misplaced hopes is nothing new to The Notwist, and Schmid presumably courted them as soundtrack artists for this very reason. The Lichter twelve-inch, the inaugural release of The Notwist's own Alien Transistor label (despite that its catalog number misleadingly reads ""NO3"") consists of three ultra-minimal instrumental compositions built on the haunts of piano and cello lines, interspersed with electronic fuzz and clicks, and the rhythmic augments of a zarb (a type of Eastern drum capable of differentiated tone, ergo melody as well). It also includes a modest remix of these sounds by the band's own Martin Gretschmann-- also known as heralded electropop artist Console. For the project, the Acher brothers were asked to compose a brief instrumental soundtrack-- not a full-length Notwist release. The music is necessarily secondary to the film itself, and to this end must never upstage the dramatics or disagree with them thematically. Despite the implications of that, instrumental soundtracks don't always equal ""boring."" One need only recall Clint Mansell's similar effort with the soundtrack for Requiem for a Dream: a film about the fragility of the American Dream and its hopeless victims. Mansell did an expert job of mirroring the film's downward spiral, keeping more or less to the film's opening string theme throughout, but progressively imbuing it with an insistent melancholy. Each track has its own internal momentum, and taken as a whole, the Requiem soundtrack amounted to a horrifically draining experience, even when separated from the film itself. In contrast, the Lichter soundtrack is frustratingly stagnant. The overall tenor and intensity of each of the three ""Lichter"" pieces is virtually the same, and moreover, so are the roles of each instrument, which drastically reduces the possibilities for sonic variation within the soundtrack's theme (if there was even intended to be one at all). On a micro-level, the compositions (save the predictable addition and subtraction of instruments that occurs in ""Lichter 1"") never pursue any dynamic buildup or collapse-- nor is there enough melody present in the lines to justify the mindnumbingly high number of repetitions. Given how other-worldly this specific combination of instruments is, the soundtrack seems unusually content as background music. What results is a clumsy, self-parodying breed of made-for-TV murder mystery music, where The Young and the Restless meets X-Files. Naturally, the chances of winding up with a vaguely Martian chill and a whodunit suspense are in your favor when you've got a cello, piano and zarb interacting; I'm just surprised that these compositions never amount to anything but Martian and suspenseful, which undermines the notion of suspense entirely. Die-hard Notwist fans might justify their purchase of Lichter for its inclusion of the Console remix, which serves as the record's obvious standout. Console's rendition avoids all the criticisms that could be made of the other ""Lichter"" variations. Starting off quietly with the piano and cello as would the other tracks, the remix ebbs in momentum as Console inserts echoing synth lines and a jittery backbeat to drive the track home. The remix's electronic pulse over long instrumental lines might be likened as some dark counterpart to moments on Mouse on Mars' Glam-- another autonomously fantastic instrumental soundtrack that, the Console track reminds us, Notwist's Lichter will never be. What we're left with, then, is one singular, brief revelation of genuine interest. The rest of Lichter is an impotent ghost, looking the part of terror, but emasculated by its tragic indecisiveness.","Hans-Christian Schmid's Lichter, which at the moment is enjoying the same massive underground media buzz that's always awarded ...

Love You Just the Same,Centro-matic,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56eb1335d7bf1698bcb/1:1/w_160/f7a0aa51.jpg,2003-09-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1377-love-you-just-the-same/,Misra,"Gentlemen-- and you few precious femullets-- welcome to what will sadly be the final meeting of the SUCKERMCs: Socialists United to Control or Kill Everyone Resistant to the Marxist Conspiracy. As you know, our efforts to inspire, provoke, or mandate revolution via the audio manipulists lumped under the label ""Americana"" have failed. I'm just as flummoxed about it as you all are; I mean, isn't ""folk"" a reference to ""the people,"" like with Hitler's Ford-assisted, Jew-designed wagens? Surely some of these performers, we'd guesstimated, would hanker to wield a radical version of the ideological cannon that something called ""country music"" regularly exploits in the interests of defense contractors and capital. We thought we had Wilco where we wanted them when they hooked up with SUCKERMC Billy Bragg to record honorary SUCKERMC Woody Guthrie's work, and even their later ""assassin down the avenue"" line sounded like our mode of subversion, but alas, they've careened off into lovesongism and dilettantish wordplay. Centro-Matic has not responded to our commissioning a rebuttal to John Cougar's ""Ain't That America"" entitled ""That Ain't America"". One would think that a group whose press materials tout their ""working class hero"" status would long for some realism. Our enemies in SWASS (Subtle Workforce of American Sentimentality and Superstition), obviously got through to this quartet, because their approach and lyrics have fallen sway to emoting and obliquery. I was willing to give the album a chance based on the democratic/humanistic principles espoused in its title, and because of the stompy and marchy, prole-rousing percussion work, but this band has become prey to mainstream America's sappy What-Would-Seabiscuit-Do ethos. Songs emerge about midshipmen, cables, and corrals, but their industrial plights are (sigh) all fictional. Singing about false struggles smacks of a poseurdom on par with the rappers who fabricate criminal fantasias set in unsurvivably savage burgs. And the music press are continuing to misprioritize album-shopping over uprising. Peer at what a ""William Bowers"" blurted at Pitchforkmedia.com on the second anniversary of the September 11th attacks, perpetuating the website's info-dumping, band-reffing aesthetic: ""Ever-prolific Texan, frontman of South San Gabriel, and solo artist Will Johnson leads Centro-Matic to their best set yet. Johnson's lyrics shed their iffily free-associative Pollardism and come into their irascible own. These resonant fables of half-loved underdogs, essentially preposterous scenarios reported with apocalyptic seriousness, call to mind the last two Flaming Lips discs, and let's just say that the manifest similarity between the bleatings of Will Johnson and Wayne Coyne are serendipitous, not calculated. A few of the Wilconic tones are derivative (but that's not a complaint), and the band hugely rawks here in an unprecedented approximation of their live show, often summoning the moldy hearts of Mould and Hart (though someone down the hall from me mistook their professionalism and competence for Night Rangerdom). Hell, a harnessed Cobain twang even surfaces, semi-reclaiming his legacy from the radio-dreck borne from third-generation grunge's typhoid womb."" Bowers continues, seemingly oblivious to how he's unqualified to describe his ferret's saliva: ""The best Lips-like tune is the violin exploder 'Stephan Has Corralled the Freaks', while 'Spiraling Sideways' could have been a Britpop hit, as its hook theatrically outgarages a host of statelocked pretenders. The album's most upbeat moments ('Biology Tricks' is an insanely catchy example) hold their own with Carl Newman's Zumpano zest, and the most downbeat intervals suggest a Mark Kozelek persevering after being punched in the stomach by a foreman. Ears accustomed to mid-fi dance-noise might find this record a pinch Buffalo Tom-ish or middle-of-the-road, but listeners counterculture enough to value patience and intelligence will find the hungover eye-wiping bewilderment of Love You Just the Same rich and rewarding, free from the hot air emitted by self-consciously 'big' bands. Please help Centro-Matic deservedly outsell Ryan Adams."" Ugh. How could such a promising band succumb to comparisons with those orchestral-dub anime-casualties The Flaming Lips? When will the leisure class discover that political ugliness is as magnetic as Will Johnson's purported beauty? How will we turn this mother out? Exactly who is zooming who? My friends: screw Americana. Let's try to spread our propaganda through dance music. When next we meet, we are MAGNUM:PI, the Marxist Alliance to Galvanize New Urban Music: Project Idioteque.","Gentlemen-- and you few precious femullets-- welcome to what will sadly be the final meeting of the SUCKERMCs: Socialists United ...

Pulse Demon / Animal Magnetism,Merzbow,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c443c0084474cd0c3653/1:1/w_160/ce7d426b.jpg,2003-09-10 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11778-pulse-demon-animal-magnetism/,Release,"OH CHRIST! SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD! THIS IS THE MOST EXCRUCIATINGLY TREMENDOUSLY CLANGROUS DISASTER PSYCHO-INFERNO SINCE THE GULF WAR AND A YOUNG NIC CAGE! This is what a Merzbow review circa the early 90s would have looked like. I remember briskly walking down the streets in the crisp air, seeing the idle Merzbow-listeners in the cafes. There was an ineffable apprehension in the air. New Merzbow reviews go like this: ""We heard this all a hundred times back in the 90s. It's tedious boringcore, alternating between trivial and insufferable."" I saw a show where Merzbow played between Madlib and Sleater-Kinney sets, and kids were sitting on the floor chatting, patiently waiting, painting their nails. I sympathize with the position, but I can't adopt it. Trey Parker once said the end of reality TV would only come when they started airing baby-fucking shows. Once that show starts production, it will be viewers' fault, not the baby-fucker's. Merzbow is the aural baby-fucker. Wherever your ideology lies on the experimental scale, and whatever your religious affiliation, music cannot get much more extreme than this. Maybe John Cage's 4'33"", and that's so far to the limit, it's probably cheating. This is the edge of music, of sound in general. And now, here we are, confronted by the junction of a new album and the re-release of an incomparable classic. It's a moment for reflection and memorialization, and respect for the battleaxes that have been ensconced in our brains. In a lot of circles, 1996's Pulse Demon was one of the verifiable foundations of noise, the final proof that the pythonic wall of sound was scalable. This is a gross overstatement, of course, as journals from the Sixth Century also indicate the presence of noise, but it's not an entirely deceitful one. It came after a string of near-apocalyptic releases that were far more severe and atrophic, but also entertaining, heterogeneous, energizing, malleable. Pulse Demon is simply pure sound, viciously unadulterated static. The earlier releases stimulated the imagination; Pulse Demon decimates it. It also has a bit of a beat that would be further dismantled in the succeeding years. Pulse Demon is Meet the Beatles, where you start to understand Masami Akita's appeal before the relentless experimentalism period. And, in this sense, the record is probably one of the most archetypal Merzbow albums, the one most resolutely and incorrigibly reluctant to dilute itself with free jazz, industrial, world, or musique concrete. ""Woodpecker No.1"" is a static abscess that at first overtakes some pathetic techno, and rises to a steaming squalor that subsumes the rest of the track. ""Spiral Blast"" performs exactly what the title promises, although the ""blast"" part seems to be the focus, instigating one of the most demented howls on record, like the squeal from the JBs' ""The Grunt"" maximized to its most trembling, terrifying, cumbersome capacity. The second half is even better. The last half of the half-hour-long ""Worms Plastic Earthbound"" is a brutally drunken subterranean gunfight. All in all, seventy minutes that feel like driving an 18-wheeler made out of concrete into a remedial course on nuclear winter. And there aren't even overdubs! Essential. Unimpeachable. And the packaging by itself is already more valuable than some people's lives. In these leadenly gray days, everything from Black Dice to Fennesz is being played on the campus radio and it's easy to lose sight of what was truly revolutionary. And yet, even compared to the most recent Merzbow releases, Pulse Demon will still slaughter innocent orphans in a fraction of a second. Case in point: Animal Magnetism, one of the more approachable recent Merzbow releases. I can easily imagine someone enjoying this album who doesn't even feign to enjoy masochism. On the titular track, the mix is muddled, there are tinny beats in the surroundings, and the slow rise of a pseudo-melody. There are still static, androids, and bondage, of course, but this is definitely a step closer to getting signed to Astralwerks. ""Quiet Men"" is a light, vivacious cartoon, making the sound Warner Bros. animals make when they spin around. The first half of the album feels rather fluid. Whereas startling jaggedness is to be expected on a Merzbow album, on Animal Magnetism, there's a continuity that observes evolution and decay. Unfortunately, it's also less distinctive. ""Super Sheep"" tries to get some propulsion going, but the bassline is so immediately familiar to the causal Alec Empire fan, it makes the distortion feel like a deleterious contrivance Akita felt compelled to include at the last minute. ""A Ptarmigan"" is the most interesting track, if not particularly exemplary. In twenty minutes, it's a parade in one section, a turgid dirge in the next. ""Pier 39"" is an ambient, scraping anomaly that wouldn't be too out of place on a Boards of Canada album. While it's perhaps the best recent Merzbow CD for newcomers, it's not a keystone in his canon. Still, it's not nearly worthy of the horrendous dullness ascribed to it in the media in its first days of release. And, even if it's not his best, it'll still be hilarious when all our dads get it thinking it's that old album by The Scorpions. Maybe then Merzbow will finally be able to piss someone off.","

Echoes,The Rapture,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2145e6ef9596932032c/1:1/w_160/0b808232.jpg,2003-09-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6693-echoes/,InterscopeStrummer,"Change has been boiling under ever since the decade clicked to double zeros. We've wanted more of something, and slowly we've realized what. What you're increasingly witnessing at every club, at every show, with every passing night, is the death of the horrible, awkward, uncomfortable tension of devoted music fans pretending not to enjoy music they have paid to see. Finally, we are shaking off the coma of the stillborn slacker 90s and now there is movement. Arms uncross, faces snap to attention, and clarity hits like religion. We have buried irony and pissed on its grave and for the first time we are realizing what rock music, rock shows are all about. Fuck, was that a dream? Pavement playing the Showbox in Seattle to throngs of unwashed hippie revivalists acting as if they'd been imprisoned there by a cruel master of ceremonies, their peer and equal Stephen Malkmus? Eddie Vedder iconically scrawling PRO-CHOICE up his left arm like he bore the weight of the entire fucking world and was the only living person with this Great Important Answer to all the world's problems? That the Dismemberment Plan-- among the first to envision this future at which we've now arrived-- called us out to our faces with ""Doing the Standing Still"" and we actually still just stood there? It's almost impossible to believe in light of music like this, music that finally places as much emphasis on real, true, palpable fun as it does on art. As brilliant as this music sounds on paper and CD, nothing compares to experiencing it live. I saw it taking shape (""but I was there!"") at the beginning of this summer in Chicago: The Rapture unleashing their primal digifunk on Chicago's stuffy Metro. As the band took the stage, two kids behind me absolutely lost their shit. Whatever it was they were doing, they were doing it alone-- at first. I've never seen anything like that: You could see it visibly sweeping the whole room. And these kids didn't have a clue ""how to dance,"" which was part of the brilliance of it: For one, it complemented the overcompensating freaks onstage not knowing how to play, but beyond that, it was the very spirit of punk. The revelation that you didn't need formal training to start a band in 1977 and the realization that you don't need to be Merce Cunningham to dance are one and the same. Fucking nobody knows how to dance at these shows-- in fact, you'd look like a jackass if you did. This perceived, grand-scheme ""Importance"" of Echoes, however, is irrelevant: What matters is that it wants you to get off your ass and work it, and that you'll be thrilled to oblige. Its trance-noir opener, ""Olio"" (here revised from a rougher take on the Mirror LP) sets synthetic programmed 808 beats, handclaps and ride cymbals against vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tortured wails mash Robert and Patti into one solitary Smith. Jenner is almost impressively tuneless, and what's more, it even seems unintentional-- as though he's really trying to hit that high C and settling for a half-step down after 30+ takes. Good thing it works for him stylistically, striking as totally unhinged and wildeyed, as if he can't sit still at a mike with all that rhythm whizzing past him. ""I Need Your Love"" sends needling synths and a growling, discordant sax subtly buzzing around Jenner's nervous vocal while a punched-up house beat smacks against a minimalist bassline and sampled guitar. ""House of Jealous Lovers""-- the unparalleled champion of 2002's summer anthem sweepstakes-- appears at a slightly more album-friendly length (five instead of almost seven), showcasing bassist Matt Safer's most convincing shrieks over the slapping guitar chords that won the band their first comparisons to Gang of Four. One of the greatest things about the way this record sounds is how the DFA production team has coated it in their trademark style, pitting a gritty lo-fi aesthetic against the most state-of-the-art equipment the 1980s had to offer-- which is where it differs from the dancefloor stereotype, whose overt glossiness has remained the industry standard for decades. The album's title track is one of the better examples of what I'm talking about: Misleadingly opening like something off The Strokes' first record, it quickly bursts into one of Echoes' hottest tracks, with a sloppy, tumbling bassline, those dirty conga breakdowns, tinny guitar hits (an updated relative to the outmoded orchestra hit), and the deafening, careening carwreck ending, punctuated by Safer repeatedly screeching ""WHHAAAAAT!!!!"" at the moment of greatest impact. This is anti-gloss, but it mixes as cleanly into any DJ set as it does into indie rock mixtapes. Virtually every track is a highlight: I feel like I'd be doing a disservice to this record by not giving a more in-depth read on the Duran Duran guitar stabs and 80s cokehead atmosphere of ""Sister Savior"", the Neptunes-esque beat of ""Killing"", or any of the three non-dance-oriented tracks (""Open Up Your Heart"", the truly beautiful ""Love Is All"" and the somber, almost Talk Talk-ish closer, ""Infatuation"") that sound entirely out of place yet somehow manage not to disturb the flow of the album. But then I'd be covering every single track on Echoes, and they can't all be that great, right? The Rapture are only one of about 10,000 bands ushering in this thing that's gotten labeled ""dancepunk,"" but it's important to note that they were among the first. Echoes was cut and complete over a year ago-- their ""House of Jealous Lovers"" single was intended as a teaser, but delays too numerous and boring to list deterred its release. As the record was continually pushed back, the cacophonous buzz that surrounded the single faded. People had been so excited: Here were the dance and rock undergrounds finally uniting, indie rock cultivating a new loathing and defiance for tired hipster poses and demanding the chaos of which safety and careerism had stripped it. Yesterday, after having been available on file-trading networks since June, Echoes finally saw official release in the UK (the U.S. is being made to wait until the end of next month), and it's no exaggeration to say it's been met with about 20% of the anticipation it would have, and should have, garnered-- if only it had come out on time. That's another rant altogether, but it's true that the timing seems all wrong on this release, particularly since we've been inundated with a million Rapture knockoffs who've already released their own sad imitations. Liars' They Threw Us All in a Trench and Out Hud's S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. aside, dancepunk hasn't even offered tangible evidence of actual potential. The fact is, paradigm shifts don't happen overnight, and if the release schedules for the next few months are accurate (!!!, Out Hud, Liars, and Erase Errata all have new albums coming out), the lull in publicity this genre's seeing right now is the calm before the storm. Meanwhile, people aren't wasting time: over the course of the past few months, I've seen them going nuts at shows you'd expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Out Hud, !!!, Radio 4, Liars, The Postal Service, Rjd2), shows you'd never expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Comets on Fire, Black Dice, Broken Social Scene), and shows by bands that don't deserve to be danced to in any climate (Hint Hint, Dance Disaster Movement). Bands like The Rapture have sent their message: The rock show was not meant to be a collegiate study. We have all stopped caring what snotty academics find acceptable, because now there is real, true, palpable fun, and it is the greatest liberation. You people at shows who don't dance, who don't know a good time, who can't have fun, who sneer and scoff at the supposed inferior-- it's you this music strikes a blow against. We hope you die bored.","Change has been boiling under ever since the decade clicked to double zeros. We've wanted more of something, and ...

I Get Along EP,The Libertines,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf9abf31b7dc7155e3f/1:1/w_160/7ee0de0e.jpg,2003-09-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4770-i-get-along-ep/,Sanctuary,"If there's one thing that the ever-shortening attention span of music's Major Leagues has taught the current crop of crossover sensations making their way towards some measure of commercial success, it's that time is short. Like knocking over a convenience store, the m.o. is slash-and-grab, get in, get out, and don't let anyone come to their senses or put things into perspective. The three R's of rock and roll are now Release, Release, Release; anything, doesn't matter, just make sure your name never leaves the new release rack, even if you have to tag something as banal as a Saves the Day CD to do it. Perhaps it's just a passing trend, but for the moment, in the wake of some ridonkulous market over-reaching by Interpol, the YYYeahs, and now this pants-load from The Libertines, it certainly seems like quality is on summer holiday. Now that they're starting to get the press they so richly deserved for last year's remarkable Up the Bracket, The Libertines, like their riches-to-more-riches counterparts in NYC, have to start pooping out half-baked EPs in between albums. I Get Along is one such EP; hell, there's even a bare ass on the back cover. And below that? The tracklist. Only stink-lines and flies buzzing the titles could make the implication (it's inadvertent, but you don't care about that) any more obvious. Out of five tracks, four are new, three sound like hastily recorded demos, two are even worth a damn, and one sounds like the nightmare soundtrack to a world where The Clash went mall-punk. It's like a countdown to irrelevance. The best thing that can be said about ""Mayday"" or ""Skag & Bone Man"" is that they're over before anything really awful to say about them can leap to mind. Tipsy, British pub-punk, complete with a stylishly disheveled (drunken?) round of backing vocals on ""S&B; Man"" is burned through with properly half-assed enthusiasm, where energy subs in for real aptitude for the material. It's formulaic, without any of the attention to detail or deft stylistic shifts that marked the tunes on their debut, but it's under three minutes for the lot. At least The Libertines know better than to waste too much time on obvious filler. The first three tracks are the backbone of this skeletal EP, and they fare only marginally better at producing something worthwhile, despite some high points. ""I Get Along"" isn't even among the best moments on Up the Bracket, but its thrashing, trainwreck guitars and Carl Barat's sleepy-eyed cockney/Casablancas hybrid vocals are pure, gleeful abandon. ""The Delaney"" is sharp, Clash-informed pop with some of the sharpest songwriting The Libertines have put together; from the jangling, trebly riffs to an insanely memorable vocal line, it's got hooks to spare. But as good as they are, together they only begin to counteract the vapid brain damage inflicted by ""Don't Look Back into the Sun"", their new single, a song just catchy and empty-headed enough to surely be a fair-sized hit for them. It's like ""The Delaney""'s evil counterpart, infectious as syphilis and for all the wrong reasons, with dumbly cutesy vocals and a food-court-sized guitar line. If it wasn't for the enduring, beery charm, or character, or whatever in even the sappiest of Barat's vocals, if he was just a tad whinier with a hint of pre-pubescence thrown in, this would pass for any other band that still wears wallet chains and Vans (""for skating""). It's possible you think that's a good thing; if so, congratulations. As I see it, the tragedy here is that for one reason or another, this has been keyed in as a single; it's not hard to imagine why, either, but it doesn't bode well. In typical single fashion, it may sound nothing or everything like the next album; just in case, enjoy the sound of Up the Bracket while you can, and while you're at it, pass on this.","If there's one thing that the ever-shortening attention span of music's Major Leagues has taught the current crop ...

The Edge of Heaven,Gary Lucas,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb6abf31b7dc7155fe8/1:1/w_160/f5032bb2.jpg,2003-09-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4943-the-edge-of-heaven/,IndigoLabel Bleu,"It all comes back to a good melody, doesn't it? I don't want to come off like a bitter traditionalist, but I can hardly blame anyone who thinks the highest goal of the avant-garde composer is to disguise or avoid melody. Dismiss it if you will, but avoiding melody isn't actually very easy to do for long. Harmonies and rhythms will come and go, and differ between scenes, eras and cultures with no greater significance than the color of your car versus your neighbor's. The one part of music everyone's supposed to be able to understand is the melody, and indeed, it's the part that usually gets the most attention in ""general interest"" circles. Even your grandmother could be fooled into liking your music if you only let her in on the melodies (mine was convinced OOIOO's ""Mountain Book"" was an ""ancient Chinese lullaby""). Consequently, melody is often given a bad rap. Part of this is due to a few bad apples proclaiming that it's the only aspect of music worth anything (see ""rap is not music"" morons, and even then only as an example of melody equaling ""happy fun tunes"" to some people). Additionally, it's often tough to separate melody from its context, so sometimes, bad ones get all the props-- anyone for the fairly unsingable ""Star Spangled Banner""? Guitarist Gary Lucas (Jeff Buckley, Captain Beefheart) must buy into the universal appeal of melody to a considerable extent because his album of Chinese popular songs from the 1930s-1950s shouldn't otherwise have much going for Westerners. The Edge of Heaven makes a solid case that what little musical ground separates us is effortlessly erased by a good song. As Lucas details in his distractingly funny-despite-being-totally-serious liner notes (""the next step was to place a couple of these tunes on my solo acoustic album Evangeline, which the critics here and abroad raved over""), the songs on The Edge of Heaven were selected from ones performed by legendary singers/actresses Bai Kwong and Chow Hsuan during the golden age of Shanghai and Hong Kong cinema. The guitarist had spent a few years in Taiwan during the 70s, and quickly became enamored of their self-described Betty-Boop-meets-Billie-Holiday charm. There is a bit of antiquated, grandmotherly grace to these songs, but just as much a gentle, warm sentimentality that shouldn't fail to infiltrate even the most hardcore hipster's stone innards. About half of the record is instrumental (solo guitar, and occasional rhythm accompaniment), and the vocals on the other half are provided by Singaporean television star Celeste Chong and German (!) female vocalist Gisburg. Chong's voice is a soft, bright soprano that's probably the more traditionally oriented (i.e., the style of classic Chinese pop) of the two-- though anyone expecting tortured cats needn't be worried. ""Night in Shanghai"" might pass for a children's song, with bouncy, folk guitar accompaniment under Chong's girly refrains. Typical for the selections on The Edge of Heaven, melodic sweetness obscures a darker message (""we see her welcome us with a smile, who knows that her heart is bitter""), though again, melody will have its way with anyone not following along with the lyric sheet. Gisburg's deeper, more sensual phrasings on ""The Wall"" may initially make a better fit if you're unaccustomed to Chong's nuances. The song laments the missing bond between a married couple, and Gisburg performs the fairly rigid, rhythmically complex melody with an admirably human touch. Lucas' instrumental performances are generally ace, and anyone familiar with his work on Jeff Buckley's Grace (or last year's Songs for No One) should immediately recognize his signature, twang-chiming sound on pieces like ""Old Dreams"" and ""Where is My Home"". In particular, his work on ""Pretense"" sells the innate beauty of the song. Where you might think this record would be a great excuse for dull, NPR-hyped drollery, Lucas actually manages to make this song sound like it could have come from Appalachian villages, where hammer dulcimer fills the air with a homey ambience almost completely lost in more ""cultured"" areas. Okay, that was straight out of a PBS telethon, but all I'm saying is that you don't have to be all up in Chinese music to dig this stuff. Ultimately, I guess you just need to be into good melodies, and really, aren't we all?","It all comes back to a good melody, doesn't it? I don't want to come off like a ...

4 Parabolic Mixes,Philip JeckMainOvalHenri Pousseur,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1649d034d5c69bf2950/1:1/w_160/ed286553.gif,2003-09-08 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6523-4-parabolic-mixes/,Sub Rosa,"That nearly all music is electronic is a banal truism. But during the 40s and 50s, a generation of experimentally oriented composers began to imagine music sourced from purely electronic means. Among the early pioneers was a Belgian named Henri Pousseur, who experimented with Karlheinz Stockhausen in a radio studio in Cologne. In 1972, Pousseur released an eight-sided series of pieces on four vinyl records as 8 Études Paraboliques (in English, 8 Parabolic Studies). The relentlessly theory-oriented label Sub Rosa re-released 8 Études Paraboliques as a four-disc set in 2001. Around the time of this release, and as part of the label's interest in forging connections between movements in electronic music through time, Sub Rosa's founders organized an event in which four composers (including Pousseur himself) presented reworkings of Pousseur's music. My exploration of electronic music has been in reverse chronological order. In the last couple of years I've just started combing through the music of the 50s, 60s and 70s to see what composers were able to manage with their crude, room-sized circuit boards. Because of my method of inquiry, I've developed certain prejudices, including the tendency to see electronically created music basically as a process of evolution. That is, it's been a pretty steady march of music that has increased in quality over time. I wouldn't dare make such a claim about pop, jazz, what have you, but in terms of timbrel complexity, emotional power and overall interest level, the experimental electronic music of today is light years beyond what could be accomplished in the old days. All this is a way for me to say that I find Posseur's re-working of his own material to be the least interesting thing here. That's not to say that the thin, ghostly synthetic tones of yesteryear don't have a certain appeal, just that Pousseur's track is to me the stuff of nostalgia, the blips and hums of the black-and-white Lost in Space flight deck. I have not heard the original 8 Études Paraboliques, so I can't say how much of the material makes it into these remixes. But Pousseur's pink noise sounds like the sound design for the ""blast off"" portion of an early-70s NASA commemorative record. God bless him, we wouldn't be where we are now without his contributions, but I doubt I will ever listen to his 28-minute piece once this review is over. Main's Robert Hampson does just a bit better. The liner notes present him as awed by the presence of Pousseur (he apparently performed directly after at the event recorded for this set), and he does follow much of the master's textural lead. Spare, dry tones dominate, but this time they're immersed in a groaning, cavernous space befitting Main's dark ambient style. Voices intrude, the mix becomes more complex and varied, but Main's contribution is never quite immersive enough. The second disc of this double-CD set contains the gems. Philip Jeck, presumably working with some of the original recordings and then making plenty of room for the dusty vinyl oddities that are his instruments, expertly draws lines between the possibilities inherent in electricity and the nagging limitations of the physical world. His multiple layers of synth drones put forth rich harmonics never imagined by the original machines, and his addition of the \xBC speed ""voice from hell"" (an effective trademark) and bits of percussion humanizes the cold music. The surface noise is kept to a minimum and he never quite hits a moment of grand catharsis, but Jeck's piece is deeply satisfying. Oval's Markus Popp, who has based much of his career on processing the music of others, provides the grand finale. Popp has gone from using a magic marker on the Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume 2 to essentially putting the source material into an atom smasher to map the music's subatomic terrain. His piece is a miracle of dynamics and impossibly rich texture. Here, Popp's sounds, so distinctly his despite their complexity, are used in the service of an expertly composed track. After long, ominous drones that are obviously building to something, the piece explodes in a fountain of melodic feedback, spitting shimmering flecks of musical energy into the air. It's like a bottomless roman candle in machinegun mode. The CD skips are here, too, but as on Commers, they're so deeply buried in the noise that they serve as a violent rhythmic device quite apart from the old ambient days. It's a fitting end to this curious transhistorical experiment that makes the future look bright indeed.",,7.3,
Band Red,Kaito,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc19ea9e61561daa73c8/1:1/w_160/af83ed48.jpg,2003-09-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4554-band-red/,spinART,"The interplay between Kaito U.K. vocalist Nikki Colk and her three bandmates-- who collectively tease out hyper, occasionally erratic backbeats and loads of weird, crashing melodies-- is always playfully confrontational. Colk's nonsensical lyrics are more about their visceral, phonetic sounds than any potential narratives, and that kind of terse, internal tension can be both frustrating and exhilarating all at once. To amp up the semantic agitation, Colk's mumbled delivery is also been padded by a mess of extraneous yelps and growls that, while adding texture to her band's art-punk noisescapes, usually have little-to-no affiliation with the words she's hollering. The result is Kaito U.K.'s sophomore effort, Band Red, a record full of disorientating (but mostly thrilling) bursts: Colk barks and warbles, each of her high-strung, shrieky proclamations practically indiscernible from Dave Lake's pinched guitar zaps. It's perpetually unclear as to whether the proper reaction is to patent a new, kicky dance move or to twitch and grimace, but that question's inherent to Kaito's game, and it's a big part of what makes this record so much fun to yap along with. Opener ""Enemyline"" is full of energetic guitar jabbing and unintelligible vocals, Colt and Lake's joint poking augmented by what sounds like a layer of mixed-down screams; the song flip-flops between quiet and loud (as post-Pixies bands are prone to do), but even ""Enemyline""'s sparser bits are heavy with the threat of total implosion. When Kaito U.K. slip away from their blustery noisemaking, like on the excellent, organ-filled ""Nothin' New"", they prove themselves capable of rolling out the kinds of foggy, wide-eyed laments that can sit perfectly alongside big punk blasts. Still, the band is at its best when indulging adrenaline: ""A.S.A. to Accuracy"" is the record's most aggressive track, with two vague, fuzzy guitar lines fighting for supremacy, blood splattering the amps. What ultimately saves Band Red from been-there tedium (check the ground already covered by Liliput, Erase Errata, even Deerhoof) is Kaito U.K.'s instinctual bend toward sticky melodies-- their tendency to temper their noise with surprisingly sugary pop hooks and wormy choruses is what keeps these songs from becoming pretentious or tiresome. So even if jumpy, fitful art-punk isn't particularly groundbreaking right now, Kaito U.K. are still playing the shiny pop card with previously unseen flair-- no matter how delightfully splintered Band Red can seem, there are always solid tunes lurking beneath the spits and flutters.","The interplay between Kaito U.K. vocalist Nikki Colk and her three bandmates-- who collectively tease out hyper, occasionally erratic ...

Chimeras,John Zorn,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab30c0084474cd0c1315/1:1/w_160/c79861c8.gif,2003-09-08 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8929-chimeras/,Tzadik,"There can really be no question at this point: John Zorn is the intellectual renaissance man of our age, the East Village Thomas Jefferson. One can easily venture that by simply researching the panoply of allusions that dot Zorn's liner notes, it's possible to be familiar with more cultural phenomena than you would gather in a lifetime at a university. Ennio Morricone, the avant-Jewish Masada, soundtracks to Maya Deren, Tonic concerts with jazz's Derek Bailey, minimalism's Phill Niblock, no-wave's Arto Lindsay and Cremaster composer Jonathan Bepler. His name is a special feature on the Branded to Kill DVD! I, and people like me, would probably obsessively idolize him, if only he wasn't, you know, a weird, bespectacled 50-year-old saxophonist. And now Chimeras, with liner notes that will effectively triple the number of allusions already out there. Get your notebook out. The cover is a Hieronymous Bosch painting. The actual composition is vaguely influenced by Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire (currently best known in the Pierre Boulez version). Inside, we learn the unification of the composition was achieved through a musical adaptation of the self-imposed barriers of the lipogram as best exemplified by the great French author, Georges Perec, and his Sixth Century predecessor, Fabius Planciades Fulgentius. All this means that each of the twelve compositions of Chimeras avoids one specific pitch which, when accumulated, form ""the first tone row Schoenberg ever utilized."" The music almost doesn't matter. If you like spending your Saturday nights in the darker corridors of MoMA, you've probably already given this a 9.5, which, unfortunately, is not far from the truth. Pierrot Lunaire is a strange choice for Zorn, and since this is Zorn we're talking about, is actually relatively typical. It was Schoenberg's return to traditional tonality after his earlier atonal works, and (with different instruments on each section) achieves the intimacy of a small chamber group. It's also absolute anarchy, the attempts of the orchestration to match Pierrot's psychological turmoil leading the piece through tortuous paths and frantic ascensions. The only two features really carried over to Chimeras are the different variations of instrumentation and the persistent schizophrenia of vocalist Ilana Davidson and her accompaniment. The first piece lifts a staccato clarinet and scaling violin over lethargic flute and percussion, until, in its culmination, the two trajectories combust in one of Zorn's signature freak-outs, courtesy of a chamber orchestra. Culmination is the main theme here, each piece building and building until the eleventh piece's convergence of every instrument at the climax of the vocalist's story (whatever that may be, I know it involves a lot of ""tick-a-tick""ing). The voice is truly revelatory here. At first, Ilana Davidson is indistinguishable from a violin in a higher register-- and then you realize, thirty seconds later, that that's a human being mourning and moaning away. She assiduously cripples the ""speech-singing"" on Pierrot Lumaire, and adds some philosophical tension to the entire piece. While in Schoenberg's version, it seems clear the orchestration is intended to convey Pierrot's psyche, in Chimeras, it's difficult to say if the orchestration is a reflection of the vocalist's tantrum or its catalyst. As a result, the two sides mimic each other (ahh, right, the chimera), a disconcertion compounded by the addition of Elizabeth Farnum's echoing voice and William Winant's percussive chiseling. All this absent-pitch-lipogram stuff is entirely irrelevant if you haven't been taking two hours of music theory every day for the last three years. But the piece itself is thrillingly diverse, suddenly going from luminous to lugubrious and from classical to chaotic. It's a bold, unexpected new chapter in Zorn's corpus, or it would be if we didn't expect that from him.","There can really be no question at this point: John Zorn is the intellectual renaissance man of our age, the ...

Hocus Pocus,Enon,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc905e6ef95969322e89/1:1/w_160/abb222f7.jpg,2003-09-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2814-hocus-pocus/,Touch and Go,"After Brainiac's untimely demise, few in the indie realm were expecting much of a comeback from any of its members-- particularly a latecomer like replacement guitarist John Schmersal. And initially, suspicions seemed confirmed by a record he issued on the short-lived SeeThru Broadcasting label under the alias John Stuart Mill, an uneven folk record that couldn't decide whether it wanted to win over the masses or languish forever in used-bin obscurity. But as most music fans agree, it takes more than one talent to make a truly transcendent band, and with the release of Enon's 2000 debut, Believo!, John Schmersal proved himself that missing link. Believo! proved an incredibly solid, diverse, and most notably, original offering, with its punchdrunk serpentine melodies and Skeleton Key percussionists Steve Calhoon and Rick Lee's junkyard assemblage providing the record's sturdy core. With critical acclaim and moderate indie sales on their side, things were looking up for Enon. That's when Schmersal hit another unexpected roadblock: his entire rhythmic section returned to their former band to record a second full-length-- no less than five years after their first tanked for Capitol Records. Worst decision they ever made? Probably, because John Schmersal was determined. After having death come between him and success, it had to seem like only a minor setback. Enon quickly bounced back. Picking up singer/bassist/keyboardist Toko Yasuda (late of Blonde Redhead and The Lapse) and drummer Matt Schulz, the band re-emerged fully formed as an outfit more interested in bumping nasties than creeping out audiences with cyborg-rock dirges. Amidst fan concerns that losing half its members would irrevocably derail Enon's plotted course, High Society again surprised everyone. Here, they patented-- and maybe perfected-- their beat-happy dance-pop/rock hybrid, and immediately took their rightful seats at the head table of the rocker class of 2002. How do you follow that up? No, seriously, Schmersal needs an answer, like, now. Too late: he decided without you. The choice? An odd one: milking the stylistically varied but thematically consistent formula of High Society, quite possibly on autopilot. Bafflingly sequenced, Hocus Pocus opens rather flatly with the downtempo trip-pop of the Toko-led ""Shave"", but then revs up with ""The Power of Yawning"", a Kinksian guitar-pop romp which collapses into a bizarro, almost Bowie-esque bridge spotlighting a stately Schmersal warble. What's more, the record confounds like this all the way through, with many of its most compelling tracks dumped off near the end. A shame, since several of these-- including the moody desperation of the serrated art-punk number ""Starcastic"" (also the record's first single) and the supremely rarefied strut of ""Monsoon""-- would stand out beautifully even amongst High Society's strongest tracks, but may never be discovered by some impatient listeners. Credit is due for the album's centerpiece and most innovative cut, ""Daughter in the House of Fools"". A stutter-step Jeep anthem blasting Toko's sing-songy vox and bass-quaking beats, the track belches forth an array of blurts, beeps, and bells, with rhythmic bobs and weaves that indicate that Rick Lee's junkyard percussion-- recreated here via MIDI triggering-- remains at least a psychic influence. The album's most immediate highlights, though, are those that feature Schmersal and Yasuda's dueling male/female vocals (""Starcastic"", ""Murder Sounds"", and the surprisingly sweet lilt of ""Candy""), an underused technique in any genre, let alone Enon's budget-futurist danceclub pop. If you can make it past the album's frustrating layout (I've found liberal use of the 'skip' button to come in handy for this), Hocus Pocus proves a fine collection of songs by pretty much anyone's standards. Not so much a step backwards as a failure to leap fully ahead, this may not be exactly what fans were expecting, but if we're going by Schmersal's track record, it's not nearly the last straw.","After Brainiac's untimely demise, few in the indie realm were expecting much of a comeback from any of its ...

Salt Marie Celeste / She and Me Fall Together in Free Death / The Musty Odour of Pierced Rectums,Nurse With Wound,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44913d197565213bf09/1:1/w_160/de38e323.jpg,2003-09-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11790-salt-marie-celeste-she-and-me-fall-together-in-free-death-the-musty-odour-of-pierced-rectums/,United Dairies,"""I slide all the way up and down my slit."" Sorry, I'm trying to get as many quotes from ""Gusset Typing"" in here as possible. There are two ""super-genres"" the music review industry has conspired to cover up: barnyard sounds and porn star moans. From The Beatles and The Buzzcocks to The Orb and Datach'i, the induction of pastoral and lecherous sounds is to pop music what pastoral and lecherous people were to world history. Thankfully, they kept their distance from each other. Until now. Mark this god-forsaken, genre-splicing year down, because some entity has summoned the nihilistic gall to combine these two super-genres once and for all. I would like to invoke Nurse With Wound's Steven Stapleton here, but I'm a firm believer in respecting a demigod's name. ""I rest a fingertip on my clit."" And yet, for the glorious, sun-speckled twenty minutes that are the unfathomable sequence of ""Chicken Concrete (For Missy E.)"" and the bastion of a billion epigrams, ""Gusset Typing"" (both from She and Me Fall Together in Free Death), Stapleton has supplied this very combination. ""I feel so hot inside in a wet, sticky way."" But first, a quote not involving a ribald appendage in a ribald crevice. From Stapleton: ""I don't get reviewed, I don't get anyone writing to say what they thought about the music... it's weird, you put all this creativity into something and it just disappears..."" This is the very definition of a brave and ambitious Sisyphus (yeah, I said it). Unfortunately, it also defines a lack of quality control. The barrage of albums that compose the NWW discography is something no mortal could hope to tread upon. When placed in the appropriate context of a creativity that should by all accounts be entirely bankrupt, these three albums irrevocably prove that Stapleton is basically releasing every sound he's ever produced. ""My gussets bulge with fingers."" I want to talk about Nurse With Wound's 1979 debut, A Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella or 1982's landmark Homotopy to Marie in this part of the review, but, my god, I can already feel Stapleton unleashing even more albums. I'm falling behind. No time for organization or grammar. Keep your chin up. Stay afloat. We'll get through this. Okay. Salt Marie Celeste. One of the more minimalist pieces of NWW's ceaseless reign, this disc consists of a single 60-minute-long track which is based a similar track Stapleton released last year on Sounds from the Horse Hospital. Its music, for the most part, is driven by cinematic, undulating waves of synths. I'm told that people like to use different music for different events. This is the music you'll listen to when shining a woefully inadequate flashlight in a strange cellar and finding a dead man with a harmonica. Oh, this situation doesn't happen that often? Yeah, and you won't listen to this album that often, either. ""Manipulating one finger into my wet groove."" For the middle forty minutes of the piece, one of the most irritating noises ever committed to record-- maybe supposed to be a dead soul, but sounds like Rain Man's impression of sex. This would be interesting if it was one of those process works, and it may be one, but I don't know what the process is. Finally, in the last few minutes, Stapleton silences that MIND-ENERVATING RAIN MAN noise and hits the ""bubbling lava"" button. This is supposed to be innovative, ideology-challenging aestheticism, but it's also boring, even for minimalist music. It ends with a fade! Real experimental-- if you're The Beach Boys. Only two EPs have been released since you read that paragraph, and one was just a concert promo. She and Me Fall Together. Nine tracks, five songs. How is this possible? Solution: Stapleton is releasing music with such rapidity that some of it has been converted into energy. The titular song here is, I think, one of those postmodern, self-reflexive ironic jokes that are still sincere, like Devendra Banhart and pre-war blues, or the Coen brothers and film noir. It's the mesmerizing Can percussion with an escalating guitar crunch, and superimposed on enough ambience to fill an art history student's portfolio. I feel inauthentic listening to it, like when I listen to 90s glam. It approaches true trounce when it dispenses with its frivolous beat and melody and starts eroding the chainsaw noise. The aforementioned barnyard and porn tracks follow. It's as if they injected some hens and pigs into an old radio, ducks turning into screeching doors, pigs into Morse code. Then the moaning, sex with bugs and injured dogs. Robot reading porn. ""My Red Hot Car"" without that lamentable ""music"" aspect. It's earnestly, pitiably, profoundly, bewilderingly a gimmick. The Musty Odour of Pierced Rectums. The only one that sounds exactly how NWW is supposed to sound: badgering, stinging metal, tempered with tape works. First track is the least rhythmic piece I've ever heard. I don't even possess an analogy, because I couldn't hold the squirming creature long enough to criticize it. Second track. Submarine, air and water bawling into the corridors, indistinguishable commands being barked, sirens, bouncing valves and spigots. Same motif as She and Me. Stapleton has gone inter-album on us again, manufacturing networks we're supposed to catalog on our NWW discography atlases. Track Seven is a malefic and abrasive din, but its main virtue consists of its length of fifteen seconds. Track Nine: eating an apple, then it rains, then he burps. I know this isn't criticism, but there's nothing on this track for me to consider. I just liked how it had its own track so it's easily accessible if I ever need it. Ladies love it. I can barely move my head now. There have been so many NWW albums released now that there's no room in my apartment for all of them. I've had to amputate both my legs and construct prosthetics out of the NWW packaging. Currently, half my body is NWW albums, and they're weighing me down. Please send this review to Steven Stapleton so he knows someone is listening and that only he can stall this flood. ""The sucking recess of my cunt to the nut of muscle that is my asshole.""","

3,Slumber Party,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f55e6ef9596932009e/1:1/w_160/cccb029f.jpg,2003-09-07 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7255-3/,Kill Rock Stars,"Last August, while kids with cars sped past my claustrophobic apartment blasting a bass-heavy ""Hot in Herre"", I was zoned on caffeine and couldn't stop listening to Darklands. Somehow, during an otherwise cheerful humidity, the Jesus & Mary Chain's rain-soaked, starry nightshade emerged as my summer jam; its timeless songwriting, vintage atmospherics, anthropomorphic feedback, and shut-eye-dreamy pace melded ten echoing heartbreakers into an endlessly churning blue-black backdrop easing the transition into Fall. A year later, embodying the Jesus & Mary Chain's offhanded, emotionally resonant cool, are the four women in Detroit's Slumber Party, whose latest album opts to strum within a swirl of paper lamps, coffee-breath yawns, and the slip-and-slide chill of 1 a.m. dew on bare feet. 3's ten tracks come and go like blurred horizon lines. When they hit their stride, endings blend into beginnings like frost-bitten hands imperceptibly retreat into wool sweaters and each chord burrows the listener further into the orange-drenched sock-hop of an otherwise forgotten backyard party as scored with smashed fireflies by Galaxie 500, rollicking Mazzy Star, or a young Velvet Underground, sans Warhol's smarmy machinations. (Though the band did manage to get heavily German Romantic liner notes written by Cary Loren of the decadently fatalistic 70s anti-rock band Destroy All Monsters, who created droning film-noir psychedelia hacked apart and reanimated by Nico and The Silver Apples. If that doesn't offer at least a tab of credibility...) Elaborately 60s downtown without the retro posturing, the Slumber Party wrap authentic know-how around simple human longings. The inner sleeve depicts the smiling band with cocked pistols aimed at a giant black heart, but otherwise the smiles are pretty rare. Not as mopey as icy Codeine and avoiding the pained, hyper-aesthete wallow of Red House Painters, a triumphantly defiant track like ""Your Friends"" pairs simple guitar parts and a syrupy vocal line to create a gauzy improvisation using ""Here Comes the Sun"" as a launching point and Opal's dark magic as a landing pad. The album's opener, ""Electric Boots"", is similarly soporific, but with quicker drumming-- like Mo Tucker breaking out a primitive ""And Then He Kissed Me""-- and a noodly guitar picking and sliding like damp leaves falling from an October elm. Here the vocals are insulated with reverb, doused with enough distance to become another instrument breathing without a specific verbal meaning. When they're audible, the lyrics are an overheard conversation: ""To see you treat her so kind, it should turn my eyesight blind."" True to its title, ""Air"" flies the vocals higher, introducing more feedback than elsewhere, and allowing the band's multi-part harmonizing to rest upon slide guitar, beautiful lens-flair reverberations, Shaggs stutter-stop harmonizing, and ever-precipitate drum parts. ""Why?"" spins itself around piano, uncurling pedal steel, pulsating background analog distortion, and what sounds like a distant violin held in check by a removal of all high-end; as the song progresses, the violin speaks up, the vocals drift to the distance, and the lap steel twists against sighed piano notes like northern lights in Kendra Smith's dusted constellations. A few slip-ups crack the spell. ""New Trouble"" falls apart when it goes for slinky instead of soporific, turning into a busy, chirping spy theme unhinged through extended distortion breaks, a telephone ringer, and a ha-ha band discussion. ""Drunk"" has too-upfront percussion and thin vocals reminiscent of a weaker Damon & Naomi track. And then there's ""Black Hearted Rode"", which plods along for four uninspired minutes with anomalous harmonica exclamation points and a tepid vocal line; fortunately, with nary a minute remaining, it shakes off the mid-afternoon ho-hum and resurfaces with jingle bells, Pet Sounds-esque instrumental sighing, gentle percussion, and a wash of pink and gray AM-radio reverb-- it's quite the dramatic save. Though Slumber Party could branch out into any number of livelier directions, for the most they wisely keep to the hazy nocturnal vibe. 3 isn't as powerful or tightly conceived as Darklands, but it does offer quite a few hazy gems. And sometimes, as is the case here, imperfection is quite enough-- the constant threat of an unwanted sunrise or a noisy misstep adding to the important beauty temporary shadows cast upon the prosaic parts of your day.","Last August, while kids with cars sped past my claustrophobic apartment blasting a bass-heavy ""Hot in Herre"", I was zoned ...

Her Majesty The Decemberists,The Decemberists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e49d034d5c69bf3b5e/1:1/w_160/c4186920.jpg,2003-09-07 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2239-her-majesty-the-decemberists/,Kill Rock Stars,"There's a crash and a scream, and the groaning sound of a warship come to rape the harbor: That's right, The Decemberists have another song about pirates. ""Tell your daughters do not walk the streets alone tonight!"" cries Colin Meloy with nasal urgency, and the band gives it more drama than ever before, lunging into an aesthetic that's half Dickens, half 1950s adventure comic book. You can almost smell the mothballs on their costumes. They don't care that some listeners won't even make it past this song, or that some people don't want to hear a pirate story no matter how well it's told. The Decemberists may never escape the label ""quirky,"" which is a crime: Whatever the style, Colin Meloy's songwriting makes this band one of the strongest working today. His melodies are so perfect and his words so substantial that it reminds you how much slack you cut most other bands. Too many singers mumble or screech as if they didn't trust or care about their words: Meloy declares his lyrics, lets his work live or die by them, and sets them deep in masterful pop surroundings. The band's confidence actually makes Her Majesty The Decemberists less accessible than their other releases. Their earliest material, on the 5 Songs EP, didn't stray far from acoustic alt-country, but their first full-length, Castaways and Cutouts-- which many people discovered only a few months ago, thanks to its reissue on Kill Rock Stars-- was a revelation, sometimes brilliant and sometimes a beautiful accident. Its dreamy tone erred on the side of melancholy; by contrast, Her Majesty veers toward the theatrical as Meloy steps up the role-playing and tells more intricate stories. On ""Shanty for the Arethusa"" and ""The Chimbley Sweep"", the band marches aggressively past the just-skilled-enough playing of their other albums, sounding like a version of The Coral that's twice as smart (and half as loud). The horns, strings and keys they've brought in this time sweeten the production, and they nail the upbeat Britpop arrangement on ""Billy Liar"", a song about a dull summer break that has what sounds like a lovestruck chorus. There's also romance in ""A Soldiering Life"", a homoerotic ode to the military. It's winningly clever, and even if it's not the deepest song in their repertoire, you have to credit Meloy's enthusiasm when he practically drools the word ""stevedore."" It's just one display of the surgical precision of Meloy's lyrics, along with the taut ballad ""Red Right Ankle"", or the rich imagery of ""Bachelor and the Bride"". But what's most intriguing about Meloy's style isn't his erudition or kitsch; it's the strange tension he creates by mashing both qualities together. ""Los Angeles I'm Yours"" sounds odd not just because he matches the disgusted lyrics with a breezy tune, but because he throws old-fashioned, florid language-- references to ""orphans and oligarchs"" and taunts like ""I can see your undies""-- against post-modern Los Angeles. And in ""Red Right Ankle"", he alternates between a metaphorical and anatomical use of the word ""heart."" Describing a girl's suitors, he sings, ""Some had crawled their way into your heart/ To rend your ventricles apart."" We know Meloy can slop through pirate gore in one song and write poetry in the next, but it's more interesting to hear how easily he can do both-- and how willfully he'll do either. As they've become bolder, The Decemberists have lost some of the uncertain dreaminess of the best songs on Castaways-- say, ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"" or ""Grace Cathedral Hill"". But Castaways' near-transcendent finale, ""California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade"", is matched here by ""I Was Meant for the Stage"", where Meloy doesn't just state his ambitions, but stands at the front of the crowd and waits for the tomatoes to fly. Maybe from here they'll become an esoteric cult band, or maybe they'll just keep getting better: Either way, The Decemberists have already established themselves so thoroughly that I was able to make it through an entire review without comparing them to Neutral Milk Hotel or namechecking Edward Gorey. They're an unclassifiable American original, and they could turn out to be one of our best.","There's a crash and a scream, and the groaning sound of a warship come to rape the harbor: That ...

Hot Shit,Quasi,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c45e6ef95969320277/1:1/w_160/33a316a9.jpg,2003-09-07 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6616-hot-shit/,Touch and Go,"There's been a wide spectrum of response to certain contentious actions of our current presidential administration: retirement into cynical apathy, zealous support of insurgent candidates, public disobedience/intricate placard design, sexual dysfunction induced by mention of the slang term ""bush."" Protest energy is especially apparent in the artistic world, the denizens of which are able to channel their anger through their chosen medium. Music is particularly under the gun, so to speak, in troubled times; with the oft-quoted (but rather weakly supported) claim that republican presidents lead to fertile underground scenes, the pressure is on those in the independent sphere. Sam Coomes, conductor of the duo Quasi, has apparently taken this challenge to heart as he navigates his band through a mid-career change-of-direction. Frustrated with the present and worried about the future, Coomes has taken solace in the music of the past, allowing the blues influences that drove his recent solo project, The Blues Goblins, to seep into Quasi's sound as well. Trading in his demented organ sound for more slide riffs than the ""Layla"" coda, Coomes makes an interesting attempt to address global issues through one of the most personal of genres. Of course, he's also taken the curious step of starting to look like a NASCAR fan on the run in an episode of Cops-- not to mention saddling his new album with what might be the worst title and cover art imaginable. Such dissonance between goofy aesthetic packaging and serious-minded content throws a dash of doubt upon Coomes' motives in adopting Southern musical style, branding it with that air of condescension that's so hard to avoid for a modern, white artist trying to avoid coming off like Dan Aykroyd. Musically, however, Hot Shit is a furlong beyond the hollow Depression-era recreation of The Blues Goblins, merging Delta tricks into recognizable remnants of the Quasi sound. ""Good Times"" starts off with a wailing gospel choir and trashcan percussion alongside cracked harmonies with drummer Janet Weiss, the sole appearance by the good old fuzzy Rocksichord, and a touch of the orchestral sound flirted with on 2001's The Sword of God. ""Good Time Rock N' Roll"" and ""White Devil's Dream"" offset rockabilly riffs and harmonica blows with a strange cacophony and Weiss' thick beatings, while Coomes lets his voice (now with less monotone!) fly on the usual dark-tinted lyrics. Whether these changes are an improvement, however, is another matter entirely. Stricken by the same backward-looking guitar worship disease that seems to have struck many in the indie community, the relentless string-bending and beer-bottle slides can't help but sound like stale recidivism. Songs that find Coomes back in front of keys sound better: the piano-driven clamor-jazz tune ""Drunken Tears"" is a symphonic adaptation of the duo at their most effective, circa Featuring ""Birds"", and ""No One"" is a pretty moan scored by gloomy fake strings. Yet, the one slice of blues-inflected tuneship that works, ""Master & Dog"", also serves as the thematic high point of the album: a simple political cartoon as potent a venomous animal metaphor as their classic ""The Happy Prole"". Coomes' sloganeering elsewhere lays it a bit heavy with the hand, though-- most notably on the bridge to ""White Devil's Dream"", where administration members are listed by name and given a cursory ""fuck you."" Not exactly ""Masters of War"", champ. Still, one can't deny Coomes' passion on the topic, nor would I want to suggest censure of his political views. But it's nevertheless unfortunate that Quasi have chosen an archaic sound with limited relevance in today's world (bring on the electro anti-war anthems!), not to mention one that doesn't exactly play to the band's strengths. So as spottily effective as their contribution to the political frustration derby may seem, the Quasi Blues Odyssey-- not quite the wax museum of Coomes' Blues Goblins side project-- is even less so. Though I've got to commend Coomes for attempting to branch out, I can't help but feel like there must have been a more intriguing direction.","There's been a wide spectrum of response to certain contentious actions of our current presidential administration: retirement into cynical ...

Sonic Terror Tour 2003,Enduser,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6a13d197565213b301/1:1/w_160/e667daf5.gif,2003-09-07 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2782-sonic-terror-tour-2003/,Sonic Terror,"Schadenfreude: the inexplicable act of taking pleasure in another's pain. Why we stare at car crashes, why we laugh when an old man unsuspectingly slips on a banana peel, why most of us will be in hysterics when the Hell's Angels draw and quarter the bassist from Phish. If this feature of human nature doesn't disgust you, great. Welcome to Enduser. You're going to love this guy. An apparent staunch believer in Schadenfreude, Enduser enjoys the idea of otherwise unscathed melodies put to the rack, terrorized by the onslaught of a relentless drum-n-bass furor. The whole process is a microcosm of the listening experience: the work destroys us as well. Here's an artist staring at us as we're thrown headlong out our car windshields. For some reason, I really get a kick out of this. An unenjoyable ""bad-sounding"" album is an easy feat; what's more difficult is to produce an enjoyable ""bad-sounding"" album. There's a certain charisma to pleasant unpleasantness, and the desire to understand this quality is, to me, what drives artists (and their patrons) to take part in aural assault in the first place. 15 Tracks, Enduser's earlier 2003 release, was so engaging because he was able to bring out a natural violence in the most beautiful melodies. Within the vocal melody of ""Björk Was Hiding Under My Bed"", Enduser isolated the song's own natural percussive destruction. The beats never completely undermined their source material, though; melody always triumphed. 15 Tracks put Enduser and his audience on the same side of Schadenfreude, since both seemed to be observing together the natural violent tendencies of the album's melodies. Sonic Terror Tour 2003 is where Enduser's Schadenfreude becomes what may only be described as some blissful auto-sadism for the listener: we know we're being terrorized, and we kind of like it. In contrast to 15 Tracks, Enduser doesn't redeem the melody from its beat subsumation; here, destruction takes primacy. The samples are gruesome, and even the piano lines from which the beats grow are drastically less melodic. The paradigm has shifted; Sonic Terror Tour 2003 is infinitely darker, more violent, less enjoyable, but perhaps all the more engaging. I reiterate how well Enduser gleans the drum loops from the melodies, how unforced it sounds, how naturally the latter gives birth to the former-- it's just really stunning here. In an easily impressed music world where artists can make enormous names for themselves by just haphazardly looping drums over scarce Jamaican rasta lines, it's so refreshing, for instance, how on Track 2 (the tracks are unnamed) Enduser carefully matches the intensity of his breaks to the vocal rhythms and a whispery flatted-seventh-to-root synth line. Similarly, on Track 3, as soon as the piano and guitar haunts trip over themselves, the song falls into a maelstrom of bass and snare. Then, a vocal cut-up drives off the storm-- looped in the same rhythm of how the piano and guitar fell apart in the first place. Or take Track 9, which starts with a tongue-in-cheek late 80s club anthem melody mixed with low-level breaks and indiscernible lyrics, and after countless octave modulations and appropriate compensations in rhythmic intensity, ends completely unwound-- our club anthem is left to a pathetic loop of ""ass ass, titties titties, ass and titties."" Needless to say, Enduser is extremely meticulous, and his diligence serves only to make this album that much more gripping. Enduser seems to attract the thick-skinned, but even this writer-- who counts himself among them-- was sickened at times by Sonic Terror's downright foul audio samples. ""Some girls like men to take a dump on them,"" Enduser's closing remark, barely speaks to the extent of Sonic Terror's lyrical brutality. Presumably, this was the intended effect, and Enduser is, as much as anyone can be, artfully violent. ""What's it like knowing you're about to die?"" introduces Track 7, after which Enduser launches into all-out guerrilla beat warfare, stopping the madness only to taunt further: ""I would like to rise and piss on your brain."" Track 10, with its Fisher Price bell keyboard riff and less intrusive breaks, is the closest to what one might consider a ""beautiful song."" After nine tracks of unapologetic eye-pulling, Enduser gives his audience a break, so to speak. It's a welcome one, and to reiterate, its higher frequency in 15 Tracks made that album more accessible. 15 Tracks still may be the place to start with Enduser, but when breakbeat suicide strikes your fancy, Sonic Terror Tour 2003 is a worthy wormwood.","Schadenfreude: the inexplicable act of taking pleasure in another's pain.

"X-Factor, Vol. 1",Richard X,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ecb1335d7bf16985d7/1:1/w_160/5c650cf7.jpg,2003-09-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6897-x-factor-vol-1/,Astralwerks,"""We're the Human League and we're pleased to be playing in the carpark of a 7-11."" And I thought Philip Oakey was dry and droll on record. It seemed a bit pathetic when he said it this summer at a Chicago street fair. At the end of the night, when people were literally dancing in the streets, it made sense. Oakey, his bandmates, and the communal spirit of communicative music were giving the people what they want: an irresistible, good time. The sound of the crowd singing along to ""Love Action"" and ""Don't You Want Me"" is the sort of party that mashup producer Richard X might have enjoyed-- and not just because the Human League are a well from which he frequently draws. The producer, who came to prominence as Girls on Top with a trio of electro/female-vocalized mashups (including ""I Wanna Dance with Numbers"", which transformed Whitney Houston from Dionne Warwick to Grace Jones), is obviously a child of the 1980s and a believer in the power of pop. ""Let's take it back to the 1980s,"" exclaims a sample on ""Rock Jacket"", from Richard X's debut album, Presents His X-Factor Volume One. ""Eighties music/ Rock it/ Lose it,"" it chimes-- often in almost indecipherable vocoder-- over a sea of synths (some Heaven 17, some Jan Hammer), the white-funk bass from Spandau Ballet's ""Chant No. 1"", and a schizophrenic drum machine. It's like taking a wondrous spin through the Vice City radio dial. Except neither it, nor the rest of the album, is really nostalgia per se. Unlike much of the regressive rock it's not reclamation, a reach back into the past to reject the present. Unlike most of kitsch-rock, it's not even postmodernist, because the appropriation and combination of eras isn't done with a wink. Richard X is more lamenting the loss of some ideas from the 80s-- most obviously the lack of New Pop sensibilities in the charts. But he's breaking boundaries instead of turning back the clock, celebrating a life loving music and making it the only untraditional way he knows how or is able to. Richard X's outsider approach is almost reminiscent of The Shaggs' heartbreaking cover of ""Yesterday Once More"", on which you can almost hear them huddled under the covers with their transistor, desperate to make music. Fortunately for Richard, technology has bridged the gulf between will/ideas and traditional compositional skill. Like 2 Many DJs, Richard is using his cunning, ear, and a lifetime of fandom to celebrate music's elasticity, and he's using the relative ease and speed of digital production to lay waste to eras: past, present, future. X-Factor features the first official U.S. release of the Sugababes' cover of a Girls on Top single: The Tubeway Army/Adina Howard bootleg, ""Freak Like Me"", which shot to No. 1 in the UK. Also included is another of his official releases, Liberty X's ""Being Nobody"" (Human League vs. Rufus and Chaka Khan). The Sugababes track still sounds as fresh and unstoppable as ever; the Liberty X is more of a grower, at best. Among X-Factor's other guests is Kelis, whose low profile in the U.S. needed to be rectified about four years ago. (If her new record, now delayed until 2004, ends up the victim of long-predicted Neptunes shark-jumping, she'll be the unluckiest woman in pop.) The electro-soul of Kelis' solo records is a template also followed by Richard X on collaborations with former Soul II Soul vocalist Caron Wheeler (reconstructing Lil' Louis' early house track, ""Club Lonely"") and Javine. Ex-Flying Lizards singer Deborah Evans-Strickland-- sounding like a Miss Kittin prototype-- appears on a pair of tracks, including an almost shuffle-tech version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's ""Walk on By."" Tiga's ""You (Better Let Me Love You x4) Tonight"" proves he's best at straight-ahead electro-pop than comedy covers. But the most interesting collaborator is Pulp vocalist Jarvis Cocker (wow, are those ever painful words to type), who closes the proceedings with an electronic cheek-to-cheek with Hope Sandoval, mixing his own professions of love and lust with Mazzy Star's ""Fade Into You."" So how is this not all nostalgia again? Because Richard X is the perfect contemporary artist, a deconstructionist who reaches through the past and celebrates both the near-elimination of the Then and Now in our file-sharing/reissue era and the democratization of music making of this new digital era. That you can purchase this in a shop instead of gawk at it on Artofthemix.com is a testimony to Richard X's PDA Rolodex, innovation, and intuition. That you'll want to buy it-- that it sounds so fresh and joyous-- is a testimony to not only Richard X, but also Paul Morley and New Pop, electro and club culture, U.S. R&B; producers such as Rodney Jerkins or The Neptunes, and anyone else over the past 20 years who argued for the timelessness of sounds that too many people claim are mere ephemera.","""We're the Human League and we're pleased to be playing in the carpark of a 7-11.""

Banned in D.C.: Bad Brains Greatest Riffs,Bad Brains,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1efc0084474cd0bff26/1:1/w_160/2780118a.gif,2003-09-04 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/519-banned-in-dc-bad-brains-greatest-riffs/,Caroline,"Bands that thrive on innovation, pushing boundaries, and continually updating their sound-- these are the ones that become legendary. For each of these bands, though, there will always be several lesser bands who catch the whiff greatness as it passes them by, and they will follow. If enough bands catch on and begin mimicking, someone will invariably call it a ""movement,"" validate the lot of them, and move onto the next wave. That's the preamble to one of the oldest clichés in the book, and if I may, I'd like to paraphrase the well-worn slogan itself for you now: ""The Bad Brains were more than just a hardcore band."" It's been said countless times about countless less worthy candidates, but where the Brains are concerned, that doesn't make it any less truthful. As one of the single most important pillars of American hardcore, and the keystone of D.C.'s particularly sharp-tongued variation on the theme, listening to the Brains at their legendary peak makes me want to lapse into all sorts of glib pronouncements about the failing rut of the current scene they helped to pioneer back in the early 80s. But I won't-- it's a disservice to the band, and if ever such a tired cliché was so apt, it's here; by the time they released their artistic milestone, I Against I, and reggae influences had spread deeper and deeper into their sound, the Bad Brains had already forgotten more about hardcore than most of their successors would ever learn. They've been compiled several times before, but the crucial evolution of their classic rasta-punk hybridization over three magnificent albums was more than any one disc could bear. Banned in D.C. is the first to finally get it right; Anthony Countey, the group's manager, has compiled what truly amounts to the definitive single-disc statement on the scope and the fury of the Bad Brains' revolutionary hardcore. From the unforgettable opening riff of ""Pay to Cum"", their famously anthemic, idealistic tirade against systems of control and the prevention of free expression, to the darkly relaxed reggae of ""Love Prophets"", the full range of their development probably couldn't have been managed more succinctly. H.R.'s alternately soul-deep or bile-encrusted wailing, spitting, and sneering, Dr. Know's lacerating speed-metal riffs, and the kaleidoscopic shifting of Earl Hudson's and Daryl Jenifer's lightning-quick punk-dub rhythms are flawlessly represented on every track. There's brilliance in Countey's track sequencing; forsaking chronology is almost always retarded (and that's being kind about it), and for a band that grew so steadily as musicians, it ought to be fatal, but he escapes his certain fate. Instead, tracks are pulled mainly from the creative zenith of the Brains' earliest, most relevant material, with only enough later work included to represent the band's later development, seamlessly progressing from the anarchic, rage-fueled blitz exemplified on the now-legendary Bad Brains cassette into the relatively calmer waters of later recordings (but mercifully not much further than 1989's Quickness). The focus is on providing smooth passage across their history, and by concentrating on flow over time, this becomes a truly great whole-album experience-- something the Brains were only able to achieve on I Against I. There are issues to be taken with this comp, too, however slight: I'm a little miffed that I Against I is almost criminally under-represented. Quickness gets far more than an equitable amount of time for my liking (on paper, anyway). Two previously vinyl-only versions of album tracks and a totally forgettable unreleased instrumental (""Riot Squad"") offer little beyond that warm feeling that strange, anal-retentive completists must feel deep-down knowing that they have every everything released by their pet artists (though in all fairness, the included live video of ""I Against I"" is incredible-- it made me wish I was forty so I could've been there). Of course, anyone with a deep fondness for the Bad Brains can put together a list of personal omissions, but in the end, the amazing cohesion of Banned in D.C. will probably put to rest any real objection. If most comps can only offer snapshots of a band's history, this is a movie, and a great one at that.","Bands that thrive on innovation, pushing boundaries, and continually updating their sound-- these are the\n\ ones that become legendary ...

Ghetto Blaster,Push Button Objects,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20913d1975652138790/1:1/w_160/13aeacf6.jpg,2003-09-04 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6522-ghetto-blaster/,Chocolate Ind.,"Kick. Snare. Kick. Snare. Hi-hat. Although producers have moved past the classic boom-bap drum pattern, it's still pivotal for artists to know the past before creating the future. Surrounded by the highly polished sample fests of RJD2 and the ridiculously technical chop-a-thons of Prefuse 73, Push Button Objects is lost in the fold, regardless of his clear production prowess. Sounding like a more basic mix of Jel and Prefuse 73, Edgar Farinas' sound is effectively simple sample chops and deep atmospherics. Not bad by any means, but nothing that will change the way you think about instrumental hip-hop. His pieces range from perfectly accessible funk (""Fly"") to ambient lo-fi thriller (""3 Doctors"") and while variety is essential to any good beat disc, the instrumental tracks aren't all clinics at Beatmaking 101. The purely wordless tracks are less than outstanding, sounding like uninspired concepts that never got fleshed out. Farinas seems content to leave loops without any expansion, other than basic sample displacement. The only impressive piece is the opener ""Hustlin'"", consisting of hard mechanical drums, a sinister bassline, the Oompa Loompa sample made famous by Prince Paul, and a Shadow-esque sequence of battle scratches that makes for an interesting, varied listening experience-- something the rest of the instrumentals might have enjoyed. Indeed, the best songs on the collection are the ones with lyrical accompaniment. Guests run the gamut of the underground, with Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Mr. Lif, Akrobatik and Maintain, among others, bringing life to Edgar's beats. It soon becomes clear that his best component is his ability to make beats that suit the artist. Standouts include Aesop Rock dropping an intelligent hoodlum on the easy listening acoustic guitar melody of ""Shut Down"" (""Hopped up on Clonopin, kicking it to college girls/ I'll fuck you blind but I need to borrow a dollar first/ For stogies, guitar and pussy, like all I've got to look forward to""), and Vast Aire blows the summer-y cymbal-driven rhythm of ""Fly"" (""You could play my verse backwards and hear a flower growing/ Play it forward and all y'all snoring""). While some songs fall flat (""Air"" with Dose One sounds like a cLOUDDEAD outtake without the mindblowing Odd Nosdam beat to keep it afloat), Push Button Objects shows serious promise for future projects.

Holding His Breath EP,Damien Jurado,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba47c0084474cd0c27e1/1:1/w_160/16be65e2.jpg,2003-09-04 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4327-holding-his-breath-ep/,Acuarela,"Damien Jurado has a serious commitment problem. Now, I do believe Mr. Jurado has a Mrs. Jurado at home, and though the last thing I aspire to be is a homewrecker, I cannot shirk what I see as a journalistic duty. Since the release of 1999's gratifying Rehearsals for Departure some four years ago, five labels (Sub Pop, Made in Mexico, Burnt Toast Vinyl, Secretly Canadian, Acuarela) have been graced with a Damien Jurado recording. Five labels in four years? He must be very popular. Someone had better keep an eye on him before he forgets how to get home and Jade Tree offers him a ride. His latest release, a five-track EP edited and released by Acuarela Discos out of Spain, marks the first time Jurado has lent his talents to another continent. As is the case with many EPs, the album is less a cohesive statement than a collection of somewhat unrelated and distinct material. Here, Damien partly cuts the songs from the cloth he wore for his last full-length (which is less than four months in the grave), employing the same haunting balance of sparse, lo-fi acoustic architecture to frame quick, bleak, personal narratives. ""I Am the Greatest of All Liars"" unconvincingly delivers a first-person laundry list of iniquities such as, ""I'm the blood upon your sheets/ I'm the air you cannot breathe,"" over a stale piano and simple drum for less than two minutes-- and to no effect. It's as if I've heard him sing these lyrics already, only before he was kind enough to also subtlety kick out a lovely melody and nimbly kiss my ears with his golden pipes. Here it feels like an act. ""Oh Death Art with Me"" and ""Big Let Down"" are vintage Jurado (really vintage-- like Waters Ave. S.-era) , if not the sort that fail to truly cater to his strengths, but they also play it too safe to stumble. And the closer, ""Butcher's Boy"", is an innocuous acoustic blues number with textbook mortality issues. ""Now You're Swimming"", however, is the reason you put on a Jurado record. Stark, and delirious with portent, he begins, ""Now you're swimming/ It don't even feel right."" The sound is layered but reserved, and it seems as if the song is intransigently grounded. Then, an inspired Jurado sings with unaffected solemnity a sanguine yet shrewd chorus that sneaks in from left field before falling again to the dirt. It's the sort of effortless moment he should always be able to conjure. Without the inclusion of this track, the disc feels nearly stultifying, but with it, altogether pleasant.","Damien Jurado has a serious commitment problem.

Neu,Polysics,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e0ea9e61561daa4672/1:1/w_160/fbab2cff.jpg,2003-09-04 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6396-neu/,Asian Man,"Hard to believe it's been two years since Polysics unleashed their Stateside debut, Hey! Bob! My Friend!, but their triumphant return couldn't have come at a better time. Released to critical fanfare (particularly from your pals at Pitchfork) but criminally overlooked by the indie masses, Hey! Bob! hit just ahead of the cusp of the 80s resurgence-- roughly a year before the genres the band holds so dear (new-wave, no-wave, electro) were embraced by every hipster with a gaggle of Contortions records and a jones for hot-pink. A shame, too, as that record's brilliantly unhinged Devo-via-Japanoise deconstructionist ditties are still head and shoulders above most of the art-punk flotsam that's been released since. Intent to stay one full step ahead of the rest of the world-- or more likely just too hyper to sit still-- Polysics have forged ahead with Neu, now rocking a style one might describe as ""abrasive electronic post-punk."" The influence of the record's namesake is conspicuously absent this time around (it was only mildly detectable on the last record, with the exception of some distinctly motorik drumming); the band has instead opted to expose more of its no-wave roots: Neu hiccups and jerks in a manner more consistent with Polysics' U.S. contemporaries than any of avant-prog/psych-rock shredders more commonly associated with their homeland. In fact, tracks like the dizzying ""MS-17"" and the completely ballistic guitar frenzy of ""Urge On!"" place them in the same ballpark as Williamsburg's current cream-of-the-crop. More than any other current act, Polysics display not just the desire, but also the deranged nervous energy and raw talent, to inherit the spaz-rock throne left vacant by 90s Moog-core heroes (and fellow Devo enthusiasts) Brainiac. ""Xct""'s bizarre synth squiggles, vocoder interjections, and delirious vocalizations conjure the ghost of the dearly departed Timmy Taylor, while ""X-Rays (This is My Life)"" absolutely nails that familiar Brainiac hip-shake groove. But Polysics aren't leaving without turning their own unique signatures into trademarks. ""Making Sense"", all preening vocals and ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)""-style synths, is Neu's poppiest highlight: with radioactive blurts and choppy digibeat accents taking its pummeling drum fills and overdriven guitar riffs hostage, it updates and reinvents the brightest moments of the New Romantic era with more charisma and creativity than any club full of electroclashing fashionista goons could ever hope to. And ""What"", the album's sole downtempo track, sits on a laid-back groove encrusted with familiar vocodered vocals, providing a brief abeyance from the rest of the album's raving-mad paroxysms. Despite this record's spazcore conviction-- the antithesis of traditional, hipster-defined ""cool""-- Neu rages and rants in total style. Today's musical climate is far more hospitable toward this kind of rampant, maniacal depravity, and with the album's beefed-up, more varied, and generally more rock nature updating Hey! Bob!'s nerdy new-wavisms, Polysics are destined for the top of the neo-no-wave heap. Here's hoping Neu won't go unnoticed.","Hard to believe it's been two years since Polysics unleashed their Stateside debut, Hey! Bob! My Friend!, but their ...

Total 5,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8009d034d5c69bf3934/1:1/w_160/7f185a8c.jpg,2003-09-04 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2019-total-5/,Kompakt,"August comes to yet another end, and with it, the final dregs of summer. As the leaves clear out their inventory for Fall's savings at JCPenney and school-crossing lights blink back into bloom, so, too-- with the metronomic precision and watch-setting punctuality that informs all the fruits of their labor-- does Kompakt's harvest of previous seasons' twelve-inches materialize in the form of the latest Total comp. Now in its fifth year, the benevolent yet undeniable power of the German-based minimal techno label comes to the fore. Whether it's dealing with microhouse styles and fey indie styling on Tobias Thomas' Smallville mix, or the hammering house glam-slam of Michael Mayer's Speicher set, all free radicals can find covalent binding, be it in the encompassing spell of gentle electronic soundscapes (see the label's Pop Ambient series), or in the trickier shuffle-step (their Schaffelfieber is another comp thread altogether). The label's mild embracing of pop, which was made obvious in recent releases (see T. Raumschmiere's Komeit, or Superpitcher's recent remixes of Dntel, Quarks, and Eno), is immediately detectable here, as the comp opens with recent Force Inc signee SCSI-9 having a go at Duran Duran's ""All She Wants Is"". As Anton Kubinov washes out Stephen Duffy's insipid vocal line with dubby bubbles, soaring synth vapors, and crisp digital creaks, singer Phong Sui's limp vocalise of ""You wasted every summer, you wasted every day"" fades into the slapping beat of Burger/Voigt's contribution, ""Wintermute"". M. Mayer, one of the pillars of the label, brings a basketball sample to dribble out a beat on his deadpan personification of ""Speaker"". It's eventually joined by a clapping hi-hat and smaller percolating elements that wiggle in amongst the Kompakt cogs, their hooks worming in effortlessly. Justus Köhncke's ""Homogen"" conjures up a hazy conga pattern and pill-fried guitar lick that Arif Mardin or the Salsoul Orchestra could have cooked up, which mixes with echoing percussion to create a puddle of beatless mind-melt on the disco-floor before phasing back into crystalline focus for the fantastic finale, in which a billowing, arpeggiated cloud swallows every last bit of sound. Superpitcher steps up again with the spore-ific stomp of ""Mushroom"", all fat, slippery fungoid bass squishes with a Gas-eous and, dare I say, haunting, melody rising behind it. Rattling ratchet turns and mechanic scissor-snips orbit the slow, syrupy bass of Mikkel Metal's track, an echoing guitar plucked and vocoded suggestion injected for melodic good measure. And finally, Jonas Bering brings the hour-plus of new music to a close with the slow reshuffling of Basic Channel and classic krautrock elements on ""Normandie 2"". Some cogs get replaced, but the elements remain the same, be they gaseous, liquid, or solid, and even as the seasons change, Kompakt slightly changes up their approach while remaining as comfortable and dependable as ever.","August comes to yet another end, and with it, the final dregs of summer.

Amigo Row,Matt Suggs,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59e13d1975652138fcb/1:1/w_160/a4cd8cf7.jpg,2003-09-03 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7556-amigo-row/,Merge,"Oh God, hang on to your tar pits, because leaping out from behind the Krispy Kreme pay phone comes a selection of FUN FACTS ABOUT THIS CD! Read on! AMOUNT MERGE APPARENTLY SPENT ON THE PACKAGING: Thirty-five cents. POP ICON WHOM SUGGS MOST RESEMBLES: Matt is, fascinatingly, the lycanthropine doppelganger of the big brother from The Goonies. ARTIST THIS ALBUM MOST TRUMPS: Frank Black-- not to be confused with Black Francis or Charles Thompson. Amigo Row is the mature-but-not-boring, laid-way-back singer/songwriter album that Black's been struggling to half-make for years. Suggs' embodiment of the Pixie-cum-pooper is uncanny, down to the lisp, spaciness, and the nervous, breathy falsetto. Intimations of Black Francis' girl-name-dropping Bossanova do bubble up, though, as Suggs croons him some Clementines, Janies, and Hannahs. ARTIST MOST HAUNTING THIS ALBUM: Stephen Malkmus. Suggs' old band Butterglory (who themselves most haunt the hyper tease ""Calm Down"") couldn't escape Pavement Junior labels, despite their growth from a college-radio-rock-by-numbers lo-fi concern into the guiteurs of Are You Building a Temple in Heaven? and the standoffish New Zealandry of Rat-Tat-Tat. The Wedding Present even covered both bands (Pavement's ""Box Elder"" and Butterglory's ""Waiting on the Guns""). Suggs' two solo discs have weirdly paralleled the permanent-afternoon trip-pop of Malkmus' two self-helmed excursions. This album's ""Jonathan Montgomery"" chugs along on a mean, Frosty-thick, mid-70s riff similar in sasstiness to SM's ""Black Book"", even if Suggs' track pauses for piano-bar buildups. EXTRATEXTUAL REASONS TO SAMPLE THIS DISC'S MELLOW GOLD: Contrary to Digital Underground's hardsell, no one ever invented sex packets. The department store Dillard's features a ""punk"" clothing section. People are using ""oxycontin"" as a verb, like ""rollin"" or ""ballin."" Plastic surgeons are working to get small breasts considered a medical condition (""micromastia""). FILM THIS ALBUM MOST EVOKES: Jesus' Son. Some stumbly, tragicomic, Arizonian quality in this record fits Alison Maclean's debut adaptation of Denis Johnson's overbeloved drug stories. If Maclean was male, she would have been heralded as a gawk-plex messiah. BUT YOU KNOW: All these border-town lyrics about ""Tehachapi girls"" have got me thinking Suggs favors an anoxeric Benicio del Torso. WORST SONG: ""New Year"". They's even a reference to that song that rhymes with ""Mold Fang Whine"". They's even a reference to resolutions. This pianode is unfortunately the closest Suggs comes to sentimentality, though his speaker is still all intoxicated and trapped and alienated. I just don't get these Gregorian-significance poses. An indie Elton Joel, anyone? Mom? Mulchpile? ALTERNATE TITLES THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED: Albuquerque Nosebleeds. Painting Ranchy Patterns in the Cojones Hotel Lobby. ACTUAL NEU-HIPPIE NAME OF BACKING BAND: Thee Higher Burning Fire. Consider an Anomoanon being dry-gulched by The Band in a world where The Band formed after The Velvet Underground had busted up. MOST MYSTERIOUS SONG: ""Father"". Yes! Where could a fella order a whole set of tracks like this one, which cops a Taps-tone and might be about some kind of assassination? The speaker is being tracked down by horsemen, and his father is as impotent as the dad in J.M.Coetzee's Disgrace. The lack of explanation adds so much to the song's passionate creeps. Thee Higher Burning Fire plinks and plods with such coherent grace that I must scream to you the virtues of how excellently Brian ""Sure, I'll Produce It"" Paulson captured the crispness of the four November days when this record became data. BEST OPENING LINES: This honor goes to ""Darling Hannah"", which begins, ""You were rapping on and on about some hocus pocus virtue/ That carried you away to the downtown fuck scene."" Wow. I told you this thing was Malkmus-haunted. The song accretes to constitute an excellent wedge of Suggs' strident saloonism, eventually abandoning the predictable plane of breakup songs and vaulting itself into the slutmosphere, or maybe the regretmosphere.","Oh God, hang on to your tar pits, because leaping out from behind the Krispy Kreme pay phone comes a ...

Inside the Skate Scandal,Twin Atlas,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84aea9e61561daa57a9/1:1/w_160/1822c48d.gif,2003-09-03 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8214-inside-the-skate-scandal/,Twilight FurnitureNorth of January,"Whether it's underage Oksana Baiul tanking up on Long Island iced teas and taking her car for a spin, Tonya Harding sending the goon squad after Nancy Kerrigan, or those nice Canadians getting bilked by a bribed judge, there's always scandal to be had somewhere in professional skating. I guess. I don't really follow skating that closely (really!), but it's a sport that exposes a great many very young individuals to a great deal of fame, and that's just a recipe for disaster right there. Putting that much pressure on little kids is just begging for a crop of one-gloved nose-jobbers and triple divorcees. Failing to shed any light on this debate are the guys in The Twin Atlas, in spite of an album title promising in-depth coverage. Even ""The Game Is Fixed"", the one song that seems on the surface primed to address the theme at hand, contains more references to baseball than triple axels. Of course, the way Sean Byrne and Luke Zaleski make music together, it hardly matters what they're singing about-- the lyrics are secondary to the floating ambience they strive so hard to create. Byrne, you may know, was a central member of Jersey psychedelphians Lenola, a band that split this summer, and The Twin Atlas has for four years served as the outlet for his more pastoral side-- this is actually the Atlas' sixth full-length this millennium. The band's sound hasn't change much in that time, but it's a great sound, and the duo has gradually refined what they do, each time turning out a more concise, more consistent album. Their last one, Bring Along the Weather only came out like six months ago, and it brought their rustic glow to full shine. But if that album was a hazy weekend in Pennsylvania Dutch country, Inside the Skate Scandal is a day trip to Cape May: breezy, bright and close enough to Atlantic City that you can catch the occasional glimpse of neon. One criticism that's easy to level at The Twin Atlas is that their sound is inherently monochromatic. Those iridescent harmonies, like a choir of sedated Doug Martsches, sound great, but they never really change from song to song. To make up for this, they hint at other genres, which works to a degree. ""Sound in Town"" is a little bit country, while ""Walk Right Up"" is-- no shit-- a little bit rock 'n' roll. But in each case, it truly is just a little bit. The country of the former lies mostly with its rhythmic sway, while the latter breaks through its pop façade with a guitar buzz that could easily have come off a Lenola record. The boys slip some weird folk flourishes into the mix on ""Washing You Away"", a strange, pensive song full of little ponging noises that sound like they wandered out of a 1968 Pink Floyd session. ""Plan to Erase"" is a gently strummed acoustic number thrown off course by a drunken banjo, sleigh bell percussion, and a Melodica that nods to some sort of medieval Beach Boys. The instrumental finale, though, titled ""It Will Pass"", is a nice touch, a throbbing confection of soaring slide guitar, organ harpsichord and soft-toned synth. It's the best parting shot The Twin Atlas have worked up yet, a fitting way to end their strongest album to date. They seem to be consciously crafting their albums now, as opposed to simply throwing a bundle of songs in varying stages of development together and calling it a record. Maybe this has something to do with bringing the project out from Lenola's shadow and trying to make it more presentable in the process. But whatever the reason, The Twin Atlas are moving in the right direction.","Whether it's underage Oksana Baiul tanking up on Long Island iced teas and taking her car for a spin ...

Magic Magicians,Magic Magicians,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c367eb335119a49ed6d5/1:1/w_160/fd14810d.jpg,2003-09-03 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5035-magic-magicians/,Suicide Squeeze,"Everyone loves rock and roll. I mean everyone. Do you play guitar? Drums, sing, scat? Seriously, just try not to rock. Skibbety bop-bop-don't believe me? I don't care if you're an avant-garde underground dance-jazz pianist; you're gonna rock. And you're gonna like it. All you have to do is round up your friends and petition your label for support. Everyone's doing it. It's a tenuous case history, but check it out: Saddle Creek has Desaparecidos, Matador has The New Pornographers, Barsuk has The Long Winters, and Suicide Squeeze offers us The Magic Magicians; a place where artists can shed their individual reservations and primary aspirations and just plain rock. It's a safe haven, in this case for 764-HERO's John Atkins and Joe Plummer of Black Heart Procession, where everything is warm and fuzzy and no one cares how you spend your working hours. Atkins does it all, singing and strumming and plucking, while Plummer takes a seat behind the drums. A few other willing-to-rockers join the mix, including Quasi's Janet Weiss and Justin Trosper of Unwound, to name a few. I told you everyone wants to rock. And rock they do. For about thirty minutes, The Magic Magicians do nothing else, as they canter their way through eleven unaffected, unadorned one-take sounding garage pop numbers. It's no wonder this sort of project is so alluring; if they bought an hour of studio time they probably used half of it to play a quick game of Jenga and down a few Mr. Pibbs. There's no fighting over post-recording knob tweaking in the studio, and it's this palpable levity that frames the entire effort. Sometimes crisp, never clean: the sound is rough but catchy, and all the while carefree. Whereas both primary players have a proclivity for musical histrionics, there's no home for sentimentalist camp here. Rhythmic guitars trade time in the spotlight with confident drumming. ""Cascade Express"" pairs the two in a tight verse that perfectly serves an impossibly catchy chorus. The song is gone before you knew it was there, and much like the successful formula predicated by Spoon's A Series of Sneaks, the album's best moments are its least indulgent. Similarly, ""Action"" utilizes some tight drum and guitar alignments to fabricate a slick groove, but doesn't press the issue, leaving and returning to the formula with ease and wily-veteran respect for inertia. Predictably, the two slower numbers are pushed to the end. The closer, ""8 Hours Go"", being the more accomplished of the two, as the chorus of ""All Sewn Up"" could easily be a discarded 764-HERO moment. For the most part, though, Atkins and Plummer manage to shirk old penchants, something at which they were considerably less adept on their debut, Girls. Yes, it's all fairly predictable. If the song is plodding then it's resting up to sprint, if it's digressing then it's about to focus, and if it's rocking and tight then it's gonna loosen up. But they waste little time in the process and should be rewarded for such a streamlined effort. And even considering the limited palette, the album never drags. Admittedly, it's missing something, but given the limitations of this sort of lo-fi pop, nothing I'm overly fond of. It's rock, see. No excuses.","Everyone loves rock and roll. I mean everyone.

The title is a perfect description of the band's aims: to write sweet yet polite songs about crushes that are reciprocated, comfortable shoulders on which to lean, and valuing understated, tender moments. The lyric, however-- ""I could never understand you/ Hating music to hold hands to/ Sometimes something you can dance to is the last thing that you need""-- hint at a different reality, one of heartache, disappointment, and poor timing. In The Lucksmiths' world, the results never seem to match expectations-- and it's often for a lack of trying. These charming young chaps have made a career relishing unemployment, idle conversations at the pub, and lazy, sunny days. On their sixth album, Naturaliste, many of the band's hallmarks-- clever turns of phrases, a gift for sweet melodies, an odd obsession with the weather-- are present, but their once mostly jaunty, jangly pop is now often swapped for wistful, plaintive melodies. The band seems to be grappling with the perils of advancing age (all three of vocalist/drummer Tali White, guitarist Marty Donald, and bassist Mark Monnone write songs). Where they once sung about awkward first meetings and nervous beginnings, they're now lamenting lost loves and uncomfortable endings. Some of the record's best tracks have tinges of regret or painful self-awareness: the vanity of opener ""Camera-Shy"", the pensive, long-distance love of ""The Sandringham Line"", and the misplaced familiarity of lover's spats in ""The Perfect Crime"". Former single ""Midweek Midmorning"", a punchy, irresistible ode to savoring the moment while it lasts, is another highlight. Best of all perhaps is ""Stayaway Stars"", which features melancholy tongue-twisters such as: ""What sorry sights we sometimes are/ These sameshit nights under stayaway stars/ These sameshit nights in the saddest bars/ The city lights and the stayaway stars."" So here are The Lucksmiths: Drifting away from lovers, cocooned by loneliness, a bit paralyzed by both the encroachment of age and having to put juvenilia in the rearview. And they blame no one but themselves. ""I'm trying hard not to be so antisocial/ Truth be told, I'm not entirely hopeful,"" White sings on ""The Boy That Goes Out"". ""Look back on brighter days/ A microscope on how the simple things are done/ But don't look too long to the sun/ 'Cause you'll see faults/ As there are faults in everyone,"" he warns on ""Sleep Well"". This is the sound of the loneliness of the aging indie pop star. The Lucksmiths still possess an eye for detail, ornate harmonies, bewitching melodies, and sharp wit, but each is in less supply these days. Those who have grown old with the band will find comfort in Naturaliste's autumnal tones; if there's still a fair bit of spring in your step, it's probably best to keep a Happy Secret.","The lead track on Melbourne indie pop trio The Lucksmiths' 2001 album Why Doesn't That Surprise Me\n\ is ...

"Take Them On, On Your Own",Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ecea9e61561daa4b76/1:1/w_160/da5ca003.jpg,2003-09-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/771-take-them-on-on-your-own/,Virgin,"So, if the three members of the BRMC are any indication, it looks like being in a so-called Black Rebel Motorcycle Club means embracing the vacant, apathetic stare that goes hand-in-hand with just being cool, twenty-four hours a day. The problem is, this kind of Creation-catalog-worshipping mod posing can be both distancing and incredibly tiring. Sure, sneering and flipping up the collar on your leather jacket are perfectly badass gestures, but they're also achingly familiar ones-- particularly for the BRMC, which is nuts, given that this is only their second album. As the image suggests, though, BRMC don't fuck around: their sophomore disc, Take Them On, On Your Own, is packed end-to-end with tight, clenched-fist rock cockiness; its twelve impenetrable songs bulldoze with fuck-off lyrics, mercilessly effects-heavy guitar, huge, throbbing drum beats, and avalanche basslines. But there are recognizable affections, too, and when they pop up, they're either intensely alienating (the record opens with the fitting admission, ""We don't like you/ We just want to try you"") or devastatingly boring (the predictably aggressive refrain of ""Generation""). Fortunately, there are a handful of transcendent moments to be found, provided you're willing to invest the time it takes to sniff them out-- which you should, since this is one of those records that matures with subsequent spins. Check the face-flattening power of Peter Hayes' prickly guitar cuts on ""Rise or Fall"", Robert Turner's woozy, tender howls sliding all over the unexpectedly acoustic ""And I'm Aching"", Nick Jago's pounding drum fervor on closer ""Heart and Soul"", and the punkish, bouncing choruses of ""Six Barrel Shotgun"" and ""In Like the Rose"". There are also some political agendas being pushed here, as BRMC tackle national identity and brazen superpower ideology with their now-trademark contempt. In style and sound, BRMC have always swayed a little bit Brit (even if their Californian-to-Anglo ratio remains a strict 2:1), and ""US Government"", the band's pissy homeland diatribe, could, if stripped of its title, be just as easily applied to the dealings of Tony Blair. Spitting vitriolic quips like ""We are the ones that keep you down/ We are the ones that warm the ground while our arms surround,"" and, ""You know they were never, never yours to kill/ Oh no, they were never, never yours to kill,"" Turner obliquely takes on (on his own?) all of Washington's shady affairs without ever getting specific enough to actually wander into true, sharp-toothed dissidence. Consequently, ""US Government"" fails to strike as anything more than a vague and boyish suggestion of distrust-- less cumbersome than Eddie Vedder tearing up a rubber Bush mask onstage, but not as coyly subversive as it could have been. Still, it's a rush of a rock song: opening with a series of high-pitched, distorted pings and descending into a murky, clawing guitar mess, Turner's slow, mangled delivery (each word struggles, nobly, to eek out of his presumably pursed lips) sees every syllable dipped in a syrupy coat of disdain, and by the time the warped and echoed vocals-and-guitar breakdown arrives at the end, ""US Government"" has become a genuinely chilling lament. With the exception of a few notable highlights, Take Them On, On Your Own plays like a more consistent version of BRMC's eponymous debut. Tonally, the record doesn't differ much from its predecessor-- or from itself. But regardless of whether this self-duplication is intentional or not, the repetition, coupled with the album's dense, reverberating volume, can become awfully grating. Unfortunately, BRMC's signature garage-gone-psychedelic-gone-shoegazer aesthetic, which has always bordered on bloated, is inherently opposed to overexposure; tracks like the ultimately negligible ""Ha Ha High Babe"" call unwanted attention to the gobs of heavy, distorted riffing and opaque vocals that BRMC consistently employ. To aggravate the issue, Take Them On also suffers from an alarmingly poor, end-heavy track sequencing (although making you wait for the good shit seems like an appropriately snarky move). BRMC aren't the first band to mine and mimic the dark, sweaty annals of sneer-rock, nor are they alone in cultivating an off-album swagger that serves as a useful accompaniment to their in-studio bluster. But even though Take Them On, On Your Own chugs along like a glacier-- massive, cold, and flattening-- the chance of it really changing our landscape seems pretty small.","So, if the three members of the BRMC are any indication, it looks like being in a so-called Black Rebel ...

Take ""India India"": the melody unfurls with a steady, sun-stroked ease, like a travelogue theme song, but underneath, the electronic percussion sparks and pulses impatiently, too wired to take in the sights. Or ""If I Could Sing"", which is soaked with gin and dust so as to echo a historical jazz club recording: Dosh stumbles over himself hitting the drums, yet he doesn't obstruct the piano from playing its simple, wistful melody. He consistently tempers these conflicts in the careful mix and nervously balanced arrangements. Given that Dosh is a drummer, it's no surprise that the beats and percussion lead most of the tracks. But even if he hadn't included synths and keyboards, he varies the arrangement with a toychest of instruments, and all this gear gives him a giddy pre-school edge. You've got the regular drumkit and live electronic percussion, with drumstrikes that have analog fuzziness but can cut off with digital precision. The beats flurry past and then drop out the second he's done with them; and they range from pyrotechnic thwacks to the nursery school sounds of a tiny xylophone or twinkling toy percussion sets, real or synthesized. By contrast, the compositions are all of a piece: they're upbeat and charming, with playful, almost sentimental melodies mostly rendered on synth (but check the piano-led ""If I Could Sing"" for the most sweetly nostalgic and hummable tune). Two-thirds of the way through you sense the repetition, and some tracks like ""Song for Zelbert Moore"" almost have a void at their center. The drawn-out organ chords and disrupted female vocals on ""Forgot Myself"" close the record with some drama, but end-to-end the tone should be more varied. From all the distraction and noise on the record, you could get the idea that most of the pleasure of listening to it lies in the sheer stimulation-- that there's a lot of fascinating activity with nothing to support it. But the album's excitement actually comes from the tension between its surface and structure. Each track sounds careful but chaotic, simple but extreme, as Dosh shines the spotlight on himself and then dissolves into a dozen layers of movement. More than a drum recital or a set of nice tunes, Dosh's debut is a showcase where he can craft meticulous tracks and then blitz them with spontaneous joy.","Martin Dosh's solo debut is so personal that I feel like I know the guy from just one listen ...

Scrypt,Lithops,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2813d197565213b4a3/1:1/w_160/847b429d.jpeg,2003-09-02 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4814-scrypt/,Thrill JockeySonig,"You probably know Jan St. Werner as one-half of Mouse on Mars (with Andi Toma) and one-half of Microstoria (with Markus Popp of Oval). If you're a hardcore fan, you might even know him as one-half of Dü (with FX Randomiz), or through his production work (he paired with Toma to produce tracks on Stereolab's Dots and Loops, and also Kraftwerk drummer Wolfgang Flur's solo album as Yamo), or maybe one of his many cameos (Pluramon, just for starters). Sometimes, though, a guy wants to be alone. On top of all these projects, St. Werner records solo as Lithops. It's been approximately five years since we've seen a full album of Lithops material. Uni Umit was issued in North America on Jim O'Rourke's Moikai label in 1999, but was a collection of tracks recorded during the previous few years (and itself was originally issued on Sonig in 1998). In 1998, Lithops also debuted with the hard-to-find Didot, which was vinyl-only aside from an expensive CD release in Japan. Outside a trickle of Lithops singles and an occasional compilation track, Lithops seemed dead in the water. Now comes the 2003 release of Scrypt. Every Lithops release has something to recommend, but St. Werner never quite delivers on the promise of his various collaborations; as a Mouse on Mars and Microstoria freak, I always expect to like Lithops just a bit more than I actually do. Didot was raw, choppy, and rhythmically complex, but had a tendency to stray too far into noise that seemed to have little purpose. Uni Umit was better, definitely more refined and structured, even if some tracks seemed like half-hearted Mouse on Mars. Scrypt is more sophisticated than either, and also has a very different feel. This is definitely the most abstract Lithops record, with a number of tracks that seem inspired by the dense assault Oval presented on Commers. There's very little of the bouncy playfulness for which St. Werner usually makes room. You might even call ""distortion"" the record's lead instrument. Fortunately, St. Werner plays the hell out of the various shades of noise. The first track on Scrypt is called ""Generator"" and it basically picks up from the loudest, most obnoxious point on Idiology, leaves the drums and vocals behind, and adds some random explosions. ""Self-Stencil"", on the other hand, is a dissection of the subtleties of redzone harmonics, showing St. Werner's brilliant feel for distortion's luminous edge. He keeps the sheet of feedback in check just enough for the track to qualify as ambient, so that a sloppy mess of sound coalesces into shimmering, immaculate sculpture. ""Thrash Application"" bends and stretches the attack of a jagged metal riff, which occasionally breaks loose and pounds away on its own. The other significant development on Scrypt is that St. Werner collaborates with other musicians, a Lithops first. Most interesting are the addition of Sam More's woodwinds. More's work on ""T O"" and ""Insections"" forms an odd complement to the computer-generated sound, as the electronics are pulled toward the acoustic and vice-versa. The reeds add a layer of drama and pathos, particularly on the neo-classical ""Insections"", giving focus to the boundless texture. Pete Meinwald contributes horns to two tracks, but his instrument is more difficult to place, becoming another element for St. Werner to manipulate. ""Playthrough"" is the latest wrinkle in St. Werner's long fascination with off-kilter, broken down funk, and it gets its pulse in part from drummer Jeffrey Bouck. This is the first Lithops full-length to feel truly like a considered album, yet conversely it's also the most challenging listen. Perhaps in collaboration St. Werner is forced to triangulate and find more accessible solutions to sound problems. Scrypt is St. Werner uncut, experimenting on the edge of his own imagination. Something interesting bubbles up more often than not.","You probably know Jan St. Werner as one-half of Mouse on Mars (with Andi Toma) and one-half of Microstoria\n ...

"Songs of Pain: The Early Recordings, Vol. 1",Daniel Johnston,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba14eb335119a49ec946/1:1/w_160/20763888.gif,2003-09-02 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4280-songs-of-pain-the-early-recordings-vol-1/,Stress,"If you're able to appreciate the finer points of Daniel Johnston's music without entangling yourself in the sordid details of his life and circumstance, more power to you. To maintain this aura of blissful ignorance, I'd recommend keeping the liner notes to this collection tucked inside the front of the CD case-- that way, all you'll see when you open the case is Paul Leary's well-intentioned mashnote to Johnston's legacy. ""I thought my band [the Butthole Surfers] was out there,"" Leary muses, ""but Daniel Johnston was way out there."" However, inside the insert is a less simplistic essay by Austin Chronicle writer Louis Black, detailing his history with Daniel Johnston-- how he received this tape of remarkable songs from a gawky 24-year-old in 1985, how musicians and media outlets both locally and nationally took notice of this kid that saw the Beatles as inspiration and equals, how Johnston was ""a pain in the ass... manipulative and naïve."" Black writes about the time he drove down to the University of Texas campus to find Daniel standing in the middle of a creek. ""His eyes had gone mad white,"" Black notes. ""He was singing, he was testifying, he was demanding our baptism... He talked of God and the devil. Of being lost and being saved."" And of course, the notion of the inexorable link between ""genius"" and ""madness"" is brought up. After sharing all this with the reader, Black then tries to backtrack, writing, ""Okay, erase every word above,"" much in the same way a trial attorney would withdraw an objectionable comment knowing full well that those words will stick in the mind of the jurors. It's hard to look past Johnston's story when listening to any of this music. When he offers a lyric from ""A Little Story"" (""And they beat him/ And they robbed him/ And they hung him for being good/ And they laughed and make jokes/ While they stood in his blood"") and punctuates the line with a loud piano chord and five seconds of silence, it's a chilling moment. It also goes a long way in souring the happy-go-lucky air of other pro-Christian polemics like ""Wicked World"" and ""Premarital Sex"". And then there's something like ""Hate Song"", where Johnston offers yet another jaunty barrel-rolling tune on his piano. And he's singing about a girl that's waiting for a call (from him) that won't come, painting the picture with unapologetic strokes like, ""The clock will tick and it will make you sick/ As every moment of your life passes by/ You'll contemplate suicide with a knife one night/ It won't be nice."" Perhaps the one track that epitomizes what a Song of Pain can be is ""My Baby Cares for the Dead"": just Daniel and some microphone buzz, singing about a girl he loves that spurned him for an undertaker-- in fact, according to Black's notes, most of the songs in this collection are about that girl. It's awful enough that Johnston sings about the birth of a baby being the death of their love, but when he goes further to say, without hesitation, ""I know someday my baby/ Will care for meee-eeee,"" and goes into detail about being embalmed and buried in a coffin while intoning that line again and again in his detached and damning sing-songy fashion, it's hard to not wince or cringe. It would be too easy to credit Johnston's supposed lack of guile for infecting this song with such a sense of overbearing dread, since it's safe to say there are numerous songwriters continually striving for the high level of conversational verisimilitude Johnston casually exhibits throughout most of these songs. Of course, such matter-of-fact plainspeak is more appreciable in the lighter songs. Witness ""I Save Cigarette Butts"", which begins with a great line (""I save cigarette butts for a poor girl across town"") and then details the story of Daniel losing his girl to a guy that took her to a wrestling match while Johnston's Rocket 88 barrels through. After distracting the listener with mentions of Frankenstein and a dream where angels spill beer on Jesus, it turns out that the ""wrestling match"" isn't exactly Greco-Roman. There's another moment in the rollicking ""More Dead Than Alive"" where Daniel talks to a ""psychological man"" about ""this problem about this coffin"" and ends up getting prescribed cough drops. Says Daniel, ""I said, 'Please don't make such dumb jokes.'"" Better yet is ""Wicked Will"", a pithy tale about the title character and Easy Sue that takes a cue from The Kinks' ""Lola"". And better than that is ""Never Relaxed"", where Johnston takes a Job-like boy with perpetual nervousness through puberty and death. In these moments, it's easier to forget the baggage and simply appreciate the music. After all, that's what Louis Black wants when he asks us to push aside the stories and tragedy and sadness of Johnston's life. He wants listeners to appreciate Daniel's candor and emotion, his way with a melody, his awkward, nasal voice, his haphazard, yet spirited, musicianship. He wants us to treat this supposed ""outsider"" music as we would our favorite songs. Like I said, it's nearly impossible to admire Daniel Johnston the Songwriter without thinking about Daniel Johnston the Person, and I'm not sure that it's the best thing to do. Even with such knowledge, it's not hard to see what fans admire in his music. However, I did manage to have one of those moments while listening to this collection, and for that brief moment all the genius rhetoric blithely tossed about by folks like Kurt Cobain and David Bowie made all the sense in the world. Make of that what you will.","If you're able to appreciate the finer points of Daniel Johnston's music without entangling yourself in the\n ...

Unite Tonight,Those Peabodys,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78f9d034d5c69bf3816/1:1/w_160/185104ed.jpg,2003-09-02 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8029-unite-tonight/,Tiger Style,"In woeful celebration of Reviews Editor Chris Ott stepping down to mere scribe, I decided to treat him to a night on the town, partying old school South Texas-style just so he knows where I'm coming from and why I have so few brain cells left. I picked him up in my Oldsmobile Cutlass and handed over a lukewarm Lone Star tallboy as we cruised through the east side of Austin. I already polished off two, hence I was driving, while simultaneously rolling up the finest in migraine-inducing Mexican dirt weed to help Ott ""feel the noize."" I popped in the new Those Peabodys eight-track and cranked it up on my system. Ott: Christ, you might want to replace the tissue paper on your speakers you got in here. The low end is swampy like Town Lake. And uh, what is this wretched classic rock rip-off you're buzzkilling me with? Beta: Dude, new Those Peabodys, Unite Tonight. You should've seen their hair when they opened for Trail of Dead. Well, they didn't send me a cover on this one, but trust me, they rock live and their hair looks good. Here, hit this-- pffffffffft. Ott: Can they do anything other than step on the wah pedal and do pedestrianly pull-offs and hammer-ons on their Les Pauls? I mean, there are Iommi-like structures to the insipidly titled ""All My Friends Are Good""-- but the riffs keep leading down dead ends. Where's the payoff? Beta: What about the cowbells and Thin Lizzy licks of ""What's Up Turbo?"" It's cool cuz it's like a car with turbo. Vrrooom. Heh heh. Ott: Jesus, Beta, you can't lace up a pair of ironic cowboy boots without stepping on a dollar copy of Jailbreak down here. What's the point of taking on the chop-attack of classic Rick Nielsen, or fuck, Leslie West of fatso hair-farmers Mountain, if you can't write a tune to go with it? The twin guitars are competent, but the songs fall on false posturing and buzz-bin words after the riffs bog down. Look at ""Denim and Diamonds Forever"" or better yet, ""Komputer Musik"", technophobically spelled with a ""k."" Beta: Yeah, rock will never die. Bands will always rule over technology. Ott: And when that won't work, the solos flip through the classic rock stations until they hit on a particular effect that works for the moment. The chunky riff that starts ""Makin' Magik"" veers toward Foghat's ""Slow Ride"" before getting lost in the piled-up riffage and aborted choruses, uncertain if they want to be all-chops or all-pop. Beta: Dude, they're tight, like Tight Bro's From Way Back When. Hear how they all hit the drum and main barre chord at the same time in the build-up to ""Bleed Blue""? And with the feedback, you could kinda tell where like Bon Scott would be saying like ""I'm going dooown..."" right there. I mean he's dead and stuff, but... Ott: But while it throws off every indicator of ""rocking,"" replete with thrusting fists, horned hands, and high fives from That 70s Show, it just doesn't rock. It's like those Frank Marino, Budgie, and Moxy records that sell for $30 down here, but are worthless in any other part of the country. Licks and tight tricks abound, but it doesn't lock in. Beta: I kinda like the Kentucky Fried Chicken picking they nail just right to open ""Bustin' Up Yo Complex"" with them dudes hooting along at a kegger. It reminds me of those days of partying in Austin on a Saturday night. Empty promises but it feels all right for the doped-up moment. And their take on ""River Deep, Mountain High"" is totally Jim O'Rourke's boogie rock from Insignificance, but like doing Ike and Tina instead. Ott: At least there's none of that crappy Drag City irony riddling the thing. Maybe they just got rushed in the studio and didn't have any solid songs ready. Beta: Yeah, they should just get high next time. It always helps with that writing stuff.","In woeful celebration of Reviews Editor Chris Ott stepping down to mere scribe, I decided to treat him to a ...

Varieties of Religious Experience,Old Time Relijun,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b95e6ef95969322a25/1:1/w_160/be39fafc.jpg,2003-09-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5969-varieties-of-religious-experience/,K,"Old Time Relijun's heat-poisoned hillbilly calisthenics are an intriguingly cracked-out, shaggy-tail reconstruction of Captain Beefheart-- except that this band's version of the legendary acid-soaked California cornball would be decked out in a Black Candy t-shirt and smoking up on the leas of Olympia's Evergreen College. But to call these guys a mere knockoff would be plainly inaccurate: Old Time Relijun's longtime frontman Arrington de Dionyso (billed apart from the rest of the band here, for reasons which will become clear later) also shares some of the more rambling compositional leanings of sometime Relijun drummer Phil Elvrum's Microphones project, albeit stripped of its nature-boy preciousness and less successful in tossing disparate sunspots together into one unified, fuzzed-out menagerie. Of course, Dionyso seems more interested in investigating animal languages, tongues of fire, and Walt Whitman hoboism than imparting any narrative epiphany to the listener. And despite his own purposeful eccentricities, he admirably transcribes his corncob dreams as though they're concrete maps to opaque surfaces; and not even half as pretentious as he could be, he seamlessly works Where the Wild Things Are into the refrains of his manifesto, A Kabbalist Exegesis of Old Time Relijun. Sporting a John-the-Baptist-cum-Abraham-Lincoln beard and sounding at times like Yoko Ono conjoining with Tom Waits and Jad Fair to painstakingly rewrite the Jesus Lizard back catalog as countrified scrawl, Dionyso launches from Tiny Tim whimpers to high-pitched inhuman squeals, throaty bullfrog scat, and dewy mountain-top bellows in a matter of seconds. His gusto is impressive, but oft times lacking a clear-sighted cosmology for his discursive, shambling worldview-- his consistently twisted enunciations lose power, previously novel cadences blend into overdone sameness, and his rickety rollercoaster backing band becomes a predictable merry-go-round. Varieties of Religious Experience, a collection of twenty-one unreleased sermons or unheard alternate versions of previously released material, is the band's first full-length since 2001's more successfully honed Witchcraft Rebellion. Twenty minutes longer than its predecessor, this longwinded retrospective contains a multitude of versions of certain bits of songs, often moving from Dionyso's one-man four-track work to the more fleshed-out approach of he and his rotating crew of back-up players. These are interesting as studies in composition, but the repetition slows the passion down, stalling the bombast into a tired holding pattern of indulgently predicated aftertastes. Admittedly, though, one of the strongest tracks is one of these repeats. The first of two versions of ""Telephone Call"" showcases Prince's ""Kiss"" blended with a serving of Doolittle-era Black Francis-style preachin' man vocalizations: Imagine ""Wave of Mutilation"" as a soulful come-on, broken into staccato, and physically, freakishly dismembered. Another keeper, the organ-driven ""Black Cat"" introduces a nice shift to the standard foaming-at-the-mouth approach. Reminiscent of the Bad Livers or a jive-talking Daniel Johnston, it blends spoken gibberish, Ono-esque machine gun stutters, and a faintly audible sermon treading beneath increasingly vocal organ sustain into a finely catchy pop excursion. There's much to like about Old Time Relijun, and Dionyso's previous dreamquests have yielded a robust stab at busted-plank outsider hiss, but on this unfocused retrospective, the randomly placed stylistic tweaks and vaguely useful repetitions can't raise the hue and cry beyond a mishmash of Trout Mask Replica envy. At the end of the spaz attack, it's the smartly plotted cohesion of Dionyso's proper recordings that creates a forward-moving juggernaut; here, amid the schizophrenic haberdashery, the autistic Hugo Ball schtick runs thin too soon.","Old Time Relijun's heat-poisoned hillbilly calisthenics are an intriguingly cracked-out, shaggy-tail reconstruction of Captain Beefheart-- except that this band ...

All Your Faded Things,Anna Oxygen,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2f9d034d5c69bf53dc/1:1/w_160/089432f3.jpg,2003-09-01 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6081-all-your-faded-things/,Cold Crush,"At a sweaty, smoky loft-party in Williamsburg recently, amid frequent costume changes and disengaged dance moves, a coed troupe of new-wavers droned about aliens over pre-programmed beats. About halfway through the charade, a friend turned to me and said they reminded him of N*Sync. ""Maybe, but not as sincere,"" I replied. All Your Faded Things shares topical aesthetic similarities to this Brooklyn nightmare, but Anna Oxygen escapes all that empty, pop-art falsity. She's also got a knack for solid songwriting, infusing her lyrics with thrift-store-romantic touches and constructing emotionally resonant quote/unquote electroclash. Though surviving mainly on a diet of low-impact, easily consumed paint-by-number moves, Oxygen has a great voice and an eccentric sense of melody, picking odd syllabic pairings and juxtapositions, gruffly sweet intonations, and complex vocal patterning. Placing her operatic gestures atop pom-pom drum machine blips and busy keytar, her timbre is topically similar to Wynne Greenwood of Tracy + The Plastics, but she indulges in fewer Galas octave sweeps; instead, like Siouxsie raised on Freddy Mercury, she ooh's and ahh's finely layered Queen-styled vocal choruses intermixed with a few creepy Nina Hagen chirps. (Showing range, her contributions to The Microphones are more Mirah-subdued.) This sounds okay, but then, alas, enter the gimmicks. Much like Greenwood or Miranda July, Oxygen twists her work around an interactive live show including thrift-store DIY theater and visual projections. Content-wise, she says the majority of her songs are about a story involving a space scientist who captures girls' universes and puts them in petri dishes where he can listen to them and vicariously experience their lives: ""Each new imaginary girl-world I came up with became a motivation for me to make up a new soundtrack to go along with it."" This is fairly similar to Greenwood's reason for creating Tracy + The Plastics in 1999: ""It started as the soundtrack/characters of this choose-yr-own-adventure-murder-mystery movie I was writing about these girls who called themselves The Plastics and ran a pawn shop in this dreary little town at the foot of these mountains. They replaced parts of themselves with hypercolorful pieces of plastic that fell from the towns on top of the mountains, above the cloud cover."" Recycled tropes and pop music go hand-in-hand, but when similarly paced Pacific Northwest one-woman bands offer a common framework, the incestuousness of this sort of music is lamely apparent. (Oxygen has a brief tune, ""Primary Colors"", which reenacts the transformation from black-and-white to color that Greenwood describes in her band's cosmology.) Oxygen's work would be more substantial sans the clap-along aerobics and art-school posturing, especially since the strongest tracks on All Your Faded Things hinge on actual hooks-- a rarity in a genre often considered to be more consumed by its fashion than its songs. The heartbreaker, ""Red Horse Cafe"", offers one of the better backwards glances of this past year, and by dramatically situating the protagonists in the cafe of the song's title to work on a reconciliation, it moves into Johnny Cash Tallyho Tavern territory. Pumped with the storytelling of The Human League or Pulp (think ""Disco 2000""), the chorus is smoke-addled, faded scoop-neck sweater, rusted safety-pin pretty. Doubling the vocal tracks, Oxygen heightens and extends her voice, as if resolutely stepping forward for a last dance with arm extended: ""I like you so much, I don't want to lose you/ I think I could kiss you but I don't want to hurt you."" Like the best punk, the line mixes desire, a threat, and something to make you want to pogo. A few other tracks-- the one-plus-one School House Rock of ""Spectacle"", the New Order loveliness of ""Baby Blue"", and the spooky choral darkness of ""Nerve Angels Three"" and ""Aviva""-- offer equally solid, if transitory moments. But while Oxygen certainly has a knack for re-inscribing 80s drama into the fabric of 2003, even her best pop is marred by second-rate instrumentation-- lackluster drum tracks, bland keytar lines, and the like. Without taking things further than a flimsy electro zeitgeist, her potentially successful project becomes regrettably tedious.","At a sweaty, smoky loft-party in Williamsburg recently, amid frequent costume changes and disengaged dance moves, a coed troupe of ...

Land of Lurches,Kevin Drumm,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba28ea9e61561daa716b/1:1/w_160/d769c99d.gif,2003-09-01 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2466-land-of-lurches/,Hanson,"I have no interest in dissembling my authority to review this album, so let me present a brief admonition: I've been at it, and I can't think of a reasonable way to review this ""power electronics"" stuff-- few artists divide music fans like Whitehouse, Maurizio Bianchi, and Kevin Drumm. So I'm in a predicament, then. If I write that I think a few of the microtones on Kevin Drumm's new album unintentionally support superfluous pitches that merely slow down the piece's progress, most people would probably either note that the album ""sounds like a dishwasher"" or, for the kids that dig it, ""sounds like some alien, fuckin' PCP on crack, vitriolic, madcap lunacy minimalism-metal."" And both of those are valid arguments. There's really not a lot of room for specific criticisms in this sort of music. I'll do my best. If last year's Sheer Hellish Miasma was an entrance into finality, a pummeling to death, the gateway to the burdened grave, Land of Lurches is traveling music. Sheer Hellish Miasma was the Bergman film; this is the road-trip one. The first piece begins with some ominous jackhammer, the inevitable foundation of all verifiable noise, but then expands to the very atmospheric conditions of the record. Those reverberations aren't from some loud machinery, but the very texture of the air. Some clear, almost serene, tones emerge under it, cutting through the mechanistic terra firma, and ascending beyond it. While Kevin Drumm typically plunders straight to the earth's core, this is more astral stuff. The antecedents aren't Norwegian death and/or improvisation, but classical composition. It's one of those epic incursions into otherness, reminiscent of Ligeti or Stockhausen. The whole time I was thinking of Ligeti's ""Lux Aeterna"", which, in Kubrick's 2001, soundtracks the arrival of the monolith. This may be a ""land of lurches,"" but it's inevitably progressing towards something; it's the echoing of the creaks of the shuttle, the apprehension of knowing we're going to unknown zones at an awe-inspiring velocity. The track's second ""movement"" apparently takes place after the initial dread of the launch. It sounds like clown laughs if clowns had gear changes on a manual transmission. It's threatening, but also vastly lighter (frolicsome, nearly) than anything on Sheer Hellish Miasma. In the final movement, the initial jackhammer returns, as well as the clear tones, noise with a refrain, with composition and balance. The second piece is comedic. It's got a hell of a 4/4 beat, some circus music, a sort of chorus, and distorted static squeals, and it ends with the saturnine stomp and brassy trunks of elephants. And then comes the final track on this 30-minute LP, the most musique concrete of the bunch. It's a quieter affair-- airplane engines and the like-- but it turns, rather unexpectedly, into the best Martin Denny song never written, the Jungle Cruise intersplicefoliatecrossed with those spectral haunted forests from fairy tales. Rabid parrots are going off all over the place and the concentrated sap of the maple trees is TINGED WITH BLOOD. I'm ambivalent towards the end, though. I thought it was overly sentimental when I considered it as four minutes of rain, and I thought it was revolutionary when I considered it as four minutes of static. To quote the back of an LP sleeve popular in Greenwich Village, ""the choice, dear listener, is up to you."" There wasn't really any reason to read this review. (I should have told you earlier, I know, but it's too late for such qualms now.) You people are smart, enterprising arbiters of taste and you could probably tell straight away if you'd like or hate this after you got to the ""dishwasher"" and ""minimalism-metal"" lines. All I can guarantee is that this will further ruin your hearing, expand your options, and generally disrupt the populace.","I have no interest in dissembling my authority to review this album, so let me present a brief admonition: I ...

Song in the Air,Elliott,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4b13d197565213b2b5/1:1/w_160/879d946c.jpg,2003-09-01 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2753-song-in-the-air/,Revelation,"After nearly eight years of meandering, Elliott have finally settled on a defining principle that suits them-- this time, their muse is the grandiose abstraction, and Song in the Air, the band's third full-length since forming in Louisville in 1995, is packed full of half-truths and fuzzy sensations. Here, frontman Chris Higdon spouts mouthfuls of brow-furrowing lyrics (""Sold your broken wings for land and water/ Across the air and over waves/ You are the world/ You are the world repeating"") over vague, omnipresent guitar washes and bulging strings, constantly building things and tugging them apart, keeping shit stubbornly inconclusive. Indefiniteness is its own kind of answer, and Elliott seem to have just now arrived at the proper end of their math equation. Higdon is the only founding member of the band who has stuck around since the beginning, and each of Elliott's subsequent lineup changes might be partially accountable for their patchy discography, which ranges, inexplicably, from gratingly aggressive emo (1998's U.S. Songs) to dark, Cure-heavy noodling (2000's glossy False Cathedrals.) Song in the Air is Elliott's first record with new members Benny Clark on lead guitar and Jason Skaggs on bass, and it's considerably more celestial and defined than anything Higdon has spearheaded before: distorted guitar waves, wads of e-bow, violins, viola, splashes of piano, and thick, resonant percussion lead Song through lots of atmospheric swells and recesses. It's perfectly possible that Higdon's just now gotten around to unwrapping those Sigur Rós records he got for his birthday, or that Elliott's finally settled on a dominant aesthetic to accompany its new, steady lineup, but either way Song in the Air is a far more dynamic and internally cohesive record than any of the band's previous efforts. Higdon's voice is always intensely engaging, even when it's been pushed back in the mix and coated with a layer of shimmering guitar: high, soaring, and perpetually unresolved, his coos are both human and oddly ethereal, possessed but hollow, sweet and sinister all at once. These sorts of weird, intimate contradictions are always captivating-- both on and off-record-- and Higdon's floaty howls, which seem capable of bending from comforting to wholly terrifying within a single note, lend Elliott's songs a kind of tingly intrigue. Which is good, because the record's instrumentation is sorta old news by now: Elliott have taken some pretty obvious cues from post-post-rock bands like Elbow (and even hometown heroes and genre-definers Slint), and their heady stew is not exactly groundbreaking. Still, there are some effective moments: ""Drag Like Pull"", one of Song's two instrumental cuts, sees some jarring guitar detonations and eye-opening crashes; opener ""Land and Water"" has a big, echoing guitar riff that, despite waning quickly, can be sort of monumental in the right context. A recent note on the band's website seems to suggest, albeit obliquely, that this might be Elliott's swan song (""To be true to what the band and its members have stood by.it's time for Elliott to come to an end"") and Song in the Air seems like an awfully appropriate conclusion to a career based, seemingly, on a desperate search for self-definition.","After nearly eight years of meandering, Elliott have finally settled on a defining principle that suits\n\ them-- this time ...

Two Conversations,The Appleseed Cast,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e2c0084474cd0bfca2/1:1/w_160/720daf3d.jpg,2003-09-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/259-two-conversations/,Tiger Style,"There's a certain mindset amongst the critical masses that thinks certain bands should stay within the parameters of their defined sound, never to make a puerile attempt at the pretensions of experimentation. Bands circumstantially branded with the Emo tag most often fall under this strict genre border patrol-- scan our own archives for vicious cock-punches at The Promise Ring and Milemarker when they discovered keyboards and overdubbing. Yet somehow The Appleseed Cast, hailing from the much-mocked burg of Lawrence, Kansas, avoided a thorough Pitchfork-skewering when they released the sprawling, hyper-ambitious Low Level Owl duology two years ago. With islands of melancholy guitar-spiral songs breaking up an ocean of backward loops and intro-to-ambient instrumentals, Low Level Owl managed to be an occasionally fruitful evolution of emo's noodly side, too long by double, but digestible one disc at a time. Still, naysayers sought to whip them back into place, criticizing a presumed case of the old Radioheaditis sweeping across the world's wannabe Roger Waterses. Unfortunately, it appears The Appleseed Cast couldn't help but take that admonishment to heart, as Two Conversations presents a band cowed and reticent, regressing to shorter songs and swearing off interlude addiction. Rather than merely dieting off the excesses and repetitions of Low Level Owl to a more manageable size, Two Conversations is a full retreat to homebase, where Mike Kinsella's American Football project looms large in influence and lyrics follow a safe diary-page path. Even stripped largely of album-length concept (the group can't resist a couple lyric reprisals), the songs struggle to stand alone, bleeding over into each other in a way that's hypnotic at best, and soporific at worst. Slow-paced engravings of entwined guitars and atmospheric keys bookend the album, but ""Hello Dearest Love"" and ""A Dream for Us"" don't so much patiently unfold as crawl into place. Toybox reminders of the Low Level Owl sessions pop up here and there, but glockenspiels and synth strings can't hide the flimsiness of the material revealed on skeletal tracks like ""The Page"". ? The problem seems to be one of dynamics: whereas Low Level Owl constructed a curious alternation of pop/not-pop, Two Conversations can't get by simply on the contrast between slow/quiet and slightly-faster/loud. The more effusive tracks, like ""Ice Heavy Branches"" and ""Innocent Vigilant Ordinary"", are welcome respites from somnambulant surroundings, and they pivot well on the sporadically inventive drumming of Josh Baruth, but impassioned line readings like ""we can all be naked now, and innocent"" can't help but make the group sound like it's trapped on Polyvinyl Records circa 1996. Which, not coincidentally, is the space-time location of American Football, a shadow The Appleseed Cast just can't seem to get out from under-- unless you count ""The Sinking"", which may well have been written right after the band attended a Pedro the Lion show. It's disheartening to see a band that was just starting to show promising signs of independent development trip back into the endless spiral of easy ""sounds-like"" comparisons, but that's the sad outcome when a group listens too seriously to us tuneless jackasses spinning laptop censure from our couches. Ignore all those other critics, guys, and just listen to me: an ambitious failure is better than a boring water-tread any day of the week.","There's a certain mindset amongst the critical masses that thinks certain bands should stay within the parameters of their ...

Aaron: Hold up. Most of the tracks on both EPs have funny titles, also. ""Ho's in the House""? ""Post-Ivy League Depression""?

This is a little more typical indie-rock kinda stuff. Those Pitchfork wieners will dig this. Aaron: Sounds like he's been hitting the pipe with that Modest Mouse dude. Travis: It's a different version of a track off their first album, Hold Your Horse Is. I think it works better without the vocals. [CD changer skips to next disc] Aaron:Uh-oh. I think they're using electronics on this Total Bugs Bunny thing. Travis: Aaron, wtf dude, chill the fuck out, man. It's not the total kiss of death. Aaron: Look what it did to Axl. Travis: You got a point. [pause] The drummer's still doing those whacked-out polyrhythms on ""Your DJ Children"". It's a little dancey for my taste. Bummer. Aaron: ""Post-Ivy League Depression"" sounds kinda like gay electronic jazz. This is dangerously close to pissing me off. Travis: ""Koko B. Ware""... wasn't he the faux-Caribbean wrestler with the parrot? This shit's tite, for sure, tho-- the guitar sounds like a Nintendo game. I heard dude's got a side project called The Advantage that only plays tunes from old 8-bit games. Aaron: Killer. I bet Vince Vaughn would suck these guys' dicks. I saw that kid at Daddy's and I think he's railing the Rainer Maria chick. Dude gets mad vag. Travis: I'm gonna pass this Hella shit onto Gary Gersh.

Decoration Day,Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen Haag,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb42eb335119a49ec9c9/1:1/w_160/afbed249.jpg,2003-08-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2508-decoration-day/,New West,"With the deserved accolades accompanying their 2001 double-disc magnum opus, Southern Rock Opera, newcomers the Drive-By Truckers have the unenviable task of following up one of the more ambitious records of the (very) early 21st century with a critical spotlight shining directly into their eyes. Despite the pressure, they've managed to avoid repeating themselves-- or worse, buying into the hype that made them a flagship band of the newly re-energized southern rock scene. Decoration Day is possessed by an entirely different kind of energy: one that appears to be the result of a complete emotional U-turn. Lead Trucker Patterson Hood and cohorts (guitarists/vocalists Mike Cooley and Jason Isbell, bassist Earl Hicks and drummer Brad Morgan) are still channeling that old Van Zandt spirit to come to grips with their ""Southern-ness,"" but where Southern Rock Opera focused its attention on big Men-- capital-M Men like longtime Alabama governor George Wallace, whose iconic personas have strongly informed the Southern culture for the better part of the last quarter-century-- Decoration Day casts a much smaller net, grappling with more personal struggles. The title and cover art, which depicts a decorated grave, give a hint of insight into the album's somber, mood-- several of its tracks draw sketches of down-on-luck Southerners facing some of life's biggest decisions and deepest losses. Opener ""The Deeper In"", the story of two siblings serving time for their incestuous relationship, is remarkably sparse, with Hood leading the song in a cappella before being joined by skeletal guitars and Brad Morgan's slow, martial drums. The thunderous ""Sink Hole"", loosely based on filmmaker Ray McKinnon's short film The Accountant (a 2002 Oscar winner), finds the narrator wishing death on the unctuous banker foreclosing on his struggling family farm. Even the songs that a New England-raised, East Coast liberal-college-attending snark (er, not me, really) might find ""rednecky"" are propped up by the unwavering dignity of their narrators. Sure, new guitarist Jason Isbell's contribution, ""Outfit"", has its more than its share of bastard children, blue-collar housepainters and cars pawned for wedding rings, but there's also fatherly advice like, ""Don't worry about losin' your accent/ Southern men tell better jokes,"" and, ""Call home on your sister's birthday."" But it's not until we reach the two full-fledged epics-- Hood's nearly seven-minute ""Your Daddy Hates Me"" and the Isbell-penned title track-- which lead the charge on the album's second half that the Truckers' vision for the album fully crystallizes. The former follows a hard-drinking, self-loathing narrator (""I'd probably hate me, too"") as he finds redemption in his faithfulness to women, backed by a slow-cooking dirge that mimics the beating he's taken in his lifetime. The roiling title track, meanwhile, recounts a son's relationship with his dead father, both of whom were involved in a generation-spanning blood feud. The confusion surrounding the origin of the decades-old battle boils over in a roaring coda that easily stands as the album's emotional core. Which is when it becomes clear: this album is about pride-- regional and personal-- and honor. Some may insist that Decoration Day's cohesiveness suffers from Hood, Cooley and Isbell continually trading off lead vocals, but I find it adds an essential component of plausibility. That each of the record's protagonists is given his own unique voice only lends conviction to this record's examination of life in the South-- one of the best since, well, Southern Rock Opera, actually. And while its peaks fall just a whit short of those on its predecessor, Decoration Day's inward journeys nicely balance out Southern Rock Opera's bombastic expansiveness, and further confirm the Drive-By Truckers' status as the most poetic and insightful Southern rockers in existence today.","With the deserved accolades accompanying their 2001 double-disc magnum opus, Southern Rock Opera, newcomers the Drive-By Truckers have the unenviable ...

Gekkyukekkaichi,Tsurubami,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85d5e6ef959693211c0/1:1/w_160/67f66193.jpg,2003-08-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8232-gekkyukekkaichi/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Kawabata Makoto makes the electric guitar sound like it's been around for a thousand years. When you combine his frantic drone riffing with whatever processing he places in the signal path, the distinctive tone that emerges stretches back before Hendrix, before Les Paul, before electricity-- back to a time when people worshipped the sun and lived according to the rhythms of the earth. I hear baroque organs, clanging percussion and primitive stringed instruments churning inside his tone. To listen to Makoto's guitar is to understand psychedelic music's ultimate goal of timelessness. Makoto formed Tsurubami in 1994 with bassist Higashi Hiroshi (who would later join him in Acid Mothers Temple) and drummer Emi Nobuko, who were fellow members of his in the pre-Acid Mothers band Tenkyo No To. Recently, the trio reunited to record as a band again-- and now, following a string of CD-R releases, comes Gekkyukekkaichi, their highest profile album to date. Though billed as a partnership of equals, there's no questioning that Tsurubami Makoto's show. On these two very long tracks, his massive guitar sound swells to fill all available space. Hiroshi's bass is essentially inaudible, and Nobuko's drumming provides minimal tone color, rising and falling according to the dictates of Makoto's guitar flights. Gekkyukekkaichi is a drone record completely; each track hinges on variations in space, volume and timbre, with little melody or rhythm. During the long passages of balls-out energy riffing (which can easily last five or more minutes), it's easy to forget that you're even listening to a guitar/bass/drums trio at all-- the music quickly takes on the character of unnamable abstract noise. ""Gekkyukekkaichi"", the first of the record's two tracks, runs about 24 minutes, and has the structure and predictability of an erupting volcano: A calm and lyrical introduction by Makoto, dense with his characteristic sense of harmony, is the calm wisp of smoke snaking upward from the mountaintop. Makoto's guitar soon settles into a throbbing drone, but around the 10-minute mark, the track explodes with wall-to-wall guitar texture that occasionally breaks back down into moments of tranquility. ""Seiitenrinengi"" (which, at 37 minutes, makes ""Gekkyukekkaichi"" seem like a pop single) follows a similar structure, interspersing extended passages of subtle spaciousness with heavy metal-on-metal guitar abuse. Here, Nobuko's drums become an extension of the otherworldly guitar, with exploding cymbals and chaotic fills mirroring Makoto's movements. Makoto's instrument emits a wide spectrum of color throughout the entire record, but at the length of ""Seiitenrinengi"" I can feel the absence of the variety that Acid Mothers brings. Some of these breakdowns would sound better with the addition of other instruments. Both of Gekkyukekkaichi's tracks are completely improvised, and you get the very real sensation while listening that the band is embarking on an epic journey that we're free to join. Despite the extreme length and constraints of the three-piece setup, these tracks rarely get boring. It can be difficult to make room in life for heroic \xBE hour guitar excursions, but when you get the time, Kawabata Makoto is your man.","Kawabata Makoto makes the electric guitar sound like it's been around for\n\ a thousand years.

Extinguished: Outtakes,Prefuse 73,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11613d1975652138543/1:1/w_160/b344f03d.jpg,2003-08-27 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6450-extinguished-outtakes/,Warp,"Cultural orgasm. Whisper in my ear and tell me you hate me. Vikings invade the Mediterranean and don't leave. Diarrhea takes over your life. These are all titles from Scott Herren's latest EP, a relentless megamix of material that didn't make it into his latest album. And no, I couldn't resist spouting them all up front. Let's just move on. Last time on Prefuse: The One Word Extinguisher LP documented a loss to be cherished. The raw material was putrid and abrasive, but it was smoothed a thousand times over in the obsessive preening of the mourning process. Prefuse tried to crush and explode himself, to revile and revel in and revise the emptiness. Nothing seemed to work. Then, somewhere near the last third of the album, it sank in: She was gone, even her impression was gone, and the beats were still dropping. Music had healed itself again. Extinguished: Outtakes doesn't look back into that mess. There's no secret suffering or swollen self-denial, just a truckload of DATs full of sick-ass beats. The mix is verbal, hyped, rich, impatient, and constantly pushing forward. With a lot of the music on Herren's Eastern Developments label, the hard part of my job is to find purchase on the smooth surface of a non-verbal document. With Prefuse, and especially this EP, the music is so monstrously verbal that I'm worried it will review me. Here are the trademark vocal scraps and battle rhymes, yes, but also an array of dirty samples and relentless sequences that barrel through your Broca's brain with big balls and no brakes. There are literally dozens of fragments here, for the most part ranging in length between five and ninety seconds. Each captures Herren's riddled attention long enough to get dropped in, flipped, then scrapped for the next. It's a dizzying and crowded ride, not always pleasant, and not one that can be navigated actively. What did you do during the Blackout of 2003? Rush home, search for candles and batteries, call loved ones? You should have set up a lawn chair in the middle of the Manhattan bridge and let the exodus wash over you with a daiquiri in one hand and a discman spinning Prefuse in the other. This album is like crowdgazing: If you don't tense up under the strain, it starts to wash over you in a way you can breathe through. It's a labyrinth, but check your watch: Less than forty minutes have elapsed. The madness begins with a custom collage of rodeo Rhodes, mambo brass, curses, interview with an old-timer from the last days of the jazz age, and, inevitably, the rapture of a brisk, sample-driven limp. This alternates with a dirty-south feel built on the same samples, until the whole thing is swept aside for a thick, janky live feel. There's some chanting and the usual layered dirtwash, and then a vital, effluvial spray of mud and guts. Pase Rock gives an unremarkable shoutout, and we're ready to push this sucker up to the precipice so it can drop for real. A harsh, cramped vamp: sick, rich clav scurrying all over the sawtooth basement. Skittish drill punctures little holes in a boom-bip clench already riddled with ligaments. A minute of strict, reckless, glorious invention in this vein, then the same beat is exposed in a stream of pre-sweetened sinewaves. Ripples forming around it push into a leisurely grind with some faded vocal hyping and a contagious snap-habit. Whining, malfunctioning synths do their abrupt flitters, squalls and death laughs. Then a dirty one-two with faded guitars and rotted flute. Muted backspun whispers wire-tripping you into the snare every single time. Dribbled out into a froth of beatlets, pressured into giving note on the sixteenths, a soprano rebels. Nasty-ass retarded old school cereal box top decoder ring jam. Clav-busters with a glut of cutthroat mugs, and all to kill the garage punk interlude. Overheard at a local wedding reception, a stuffed shirt muttering: ""Fuck you if you think that's bold. I couldn't feel your shit if my hands were stuck inside your asshole."" Such sublime humor, all but buried in the beat salad. Caulked-up fuzz bass riding a slaw of creaks and cracks. Alloys that strain the caustic slats. Muscular and doubled, chime delights a cadence uncontested: clap to the tick, tick to the trip, stiff with a tensile tip, let it rip. Whistle-dropped one to the punch of something fibrous, well-wrought with a grime delight. No effects, no intricacies, just a man and his sampler. Fives and threes stutter, wrong and bloodied like Mahler slotted into a Pharoahe Monch parody, and after all this, six whole minutes of cello and a headwrap, a Delarosa and Asora-worthy splay of velvet benevolence to lock in the freshness. Then, finally, abruptly, it skids to a halt with the blink-fast deceleration of stopped vinyl.","Cultural orgasm. Whisper in my ear and tell me you hate me.

Fanfare in the Garden: An Essential Logic Collection,Essential Logic,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce25e6ef95969322f3d/1:1/w_160/6033ea8b.gif,2003-08-27 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2892-fanfare-in-the-garden-an-essential-logic-collection/,Kill Rock Stars,"""Punk promised that you could become a new person,"" according to Greil Marcus' praise-laden liner notes to this collection. Sure, why not? Saxophonist Susan Whitby did. Following in the steps of pseudonymous punks like Rat Scabies and Iggy Pop, Whitby joined Poly Styrene's X-Ray Spex and transformed into Lora Logic. And when she was ousted from the group just before the 1978 release of the band's classic debut Germ-Free Adolescents, she took full advantage of punk's promise and began making her own noises-- sounds that echoed the influx of influences that infected the British post-punk scene. But where many of her contemporaries found their music continually celebrated in critical and fanatical circles 25 years after the fact, Logic's music was left to wallow in dusty records bins with only a few scattered admirers, like Marcus, willing to champion her contributions. It would be nice to say that this new collection of Lora's music gives her work the fanfare it deserves. Unfortunately, there are two critical problems with this compilation. Marcus takes note of the first: after mentioning an ""overwhelming version"" of ""Wake Up"" from the EP of the same name, he reveals that this particular version isn't included here. In fact, that entire EP (originally released by Virgin Records) is conspicuously absent. Granted, this could be attributed to the inability of Virgin and Kill Rock Stars to come to an agreement regarding the rights to those tracks, which would be all fair and good, if disappointing. But it doesn't help explain why six other tracks from recordings ably represented on these discs (four Essential Logic songs, and two of Lora's solo efforts) are also MIA. In the interest of those of you fond of downloading or hitting the local record fair, here are the names and locations of those 10 missing tracks: ""Wake Up"", ""Eagle Bird"", ""Quality Crayon Wax OK"", ""Bod's Message"" (from Essential Logic's Wake Up EP) ""Flora Force"" (from Essential Logic's ""Popcorn Boy"" 7-inch) ""Eugene"" (from the Essential Logic 12-inch) ""Alkaline Loaf in the Area"" (from Essential Logic's Beat Rhythm News LP) ""The Captain"" (from the Fanfare in the Garden single) ""Rather Than Repeat"" (from Lora Logic's Wonderful Offer 12"") ""Stop Halt"" (from Lora Logic's Pedigree Charm LP) This brings to light Fanfare in the Garden's second problem. Instead of offering listeners a complete set of recordings from Logic's short-lived reign as one of post-punk's most notable atypical girls, Kill Rock Stars have given space to some of Lora's output following her heyday. There are 12 of these tracks in all-- eight from two Internet-only EPs (issued in 1997 and 1998), and four unreleased from 1983, 1985 and 1991. As Marcus mentions in the liner notes, Lora Logic ""joined the world of Hare Krishna"" sometime in the early 1980s, and unfortunately, it shows. The synth-laden music for ""Stay High"" twinkles and hovers like rank patchouli smoke in a new-wave head shop, while Lora softly whimpers, ""Time is kicking like a mule/ Time doesn't care if you're a woman or a man/ Time will engage you on the surface/ You should be alarmed now; she has a plan."" The lone track from 1985 (""Do You Believe in Christmas?"") has Lora and the Krishna Kids Choir lending their voices to a Band Aid knock-off. In 1991, she copped moves from A Certain Ratio (the post-good A Certain Ratio, even) in penning a song about her former band. By 1997, Lora sounds anesthetized, regardless of her accompaniment striking a trip-hop pose (""Under the Great City"") or balancing piano scales (""Marika""). The next year finds Lora cutting sub-par tracks about the Internet and Barbie that are as bland and stiff as anything offered by a barely functional punk rock outfit. All you need to know: ""On the Internet"" actually features the sound of a dialing modem. And then there's the re-recording of ""Martian Man"", here renamed ""No More Fiction"". ""No More Fiction"" is slow and steady, and unmistakably leaden. The version recorded 16 years earlier flies free atop tribal drumming and Lora's fluttering saxophone. Where Lora's voice in 1998 is clipped and hushed, 1982 finds her gleefully trilling and cooing about these made-up superheroes. All over Disc 1, Lora careens joyously between spastic screeching (""Aerosol Burns"", ""Collecting Dust"") and considered crooning (""Wonderful Offer"") as her bandmates splice together ska, disco, various world musics, and that good old fashioned DIY what-have-you. Such an amalgam could be just another reiteration of the sound of many of Lora's musical peers (cf. Gang of Four, This Heat, The Slits) were it not for her indomitable presence. It's her unfettered sax, and her unfettered voice, that make the recordings on this collection's first disc essential. Unfortunately, this set attempts to smoothly connect the dots between those fantastic skronk-happy aerosol bur-oins and Non-Essential Enya, going so far as to sandwich the post-1982 work between tracks from her solo record and her collaboration with the Red Crayola. Perhaps the compilers were hoping some goodness from the superlative tracks would rub off on the superfluous ones. As presented, there's a lot left to be desired regarding the stuff stuck between ""Horrible Party"" (Disc 2, Track 3) and ""Stereo"" (Disc 2, Track 14), and then to follow the irreverent Red Crayola track (""Born in Flames"") with both the Hare Krishna Christmas song and the sacrilegious ""Essential Logic"" does no one any favors. Were this collection culled to include only the work worth a damn, it would be 88 minutes long, which is just long enough to not fit on one CD. Given the exclusion of certain tracks from this double-disc set (as noted earlier), perhaps more editing would have been beneficial to limit this collection to one firm and fully-packed disc. As is, the collection does a fine job telling the story of the former Susan Whitby, but it comes at the expense of her music.","""Punk promised that you could become a new person,"" according to Greil Marcus' praise-laden liner notes to this collection.

Metarie EP,Brendan Benson and the Wellfed Boys,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2749d034d5c69bf2bd8/1:1/w_160/a836686f.jpg,2003-08-27 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/654-metarie-ep/,StarTime,"Woe to power-pop, and to any pop that treads the golden-glittery road paved by mythical British archetypes and downright ancient American high society types. Of all the various strains of would-be rock and roll music, truly it is most often damned from the start: Badfinger knew it, The Raspberries knew it, Curt Boettcher found out, XTC stood alone in the corner as Cheap Trick went to the bank, The dB's broke up as The Rembrandts showed us just how to pigeonhole an entire genre in ten days. Why does this happen? Is it because power-pop is ultimately an exercise of men (and Aimee Mann) trying to be boys? Is it because the world can only handle so much falsetto? Is it because the notion of compact, tightly constructed pop songs performed by people with guitars doesn't make it past the 10 a.m. meeting in a world expecting today's deliverables yesterday? I've never figured out why rock bands playing in the mold of The Beatles, Beach Boys and, well, Cole Porter haven't been more popular. Aren't those guys supposed to be the greatest ever? Perhaps part of the problem is that the general public can't really be bothered with the next generation when they think they've already seen the best episodes. In any case, California-sunned singer/songwriter (ouch, that label has to be at least half the problem) Brendan Benson is pressing on.

Okay, now you can diss it) you'd think he'd at least have some kind of cult following. His tunes should be right on time for fans of Faulkner, Mann and 90s next-spilt-thing Jellyfish. Metarie is an EP (that for all intents and purposes is really an extended single) featuring new versions of two songs from Lapalco, one new tune and a cover of Paul McCartney's ""Let Me Roll It"". Like most good power-pop, the band (a new one for Benson, featuring mainly members of fellow nice guys The Atomic Numbers) sounds good and the background vocals even better. Consequently, Benson's leads are semi-exposed as being a tad thin to carry his songs, which isn't unprecedented (Ben Folds, please stand up) but is disappointing for anyone wanting a little more power in their pop. ""Alternative to Love"" is almost straight Friends fare disguised in Rubber Souls. ""Maybe I'm just damaged goods.../ Me, I'm just a little lost lamb,"" are Benson's admissions, and that places him squarely in the realm of cute li'l underdog. Again, anyone paying even marginal attention to power-pop over the years shouldn't be surprised, though playing that same face through the otherwise faithful version of ""Let Me Roll It"" (one of McCartney's grittier Wings-era outings) drastically undersells its charm. Metarie is probably a stopgap release, and one that probably shouldn't be given microscopic focus by fans. Still, I keep rooting for those damn underdogs, and it would be nice to see one show a little muscle now and then.

Secret Weapon Revealed at Last,Country Teasers,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d79d034d5c69bf363e/1:1/w_160/74e2576b.jpg,2003-08-27 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1719-secret-weapon-revealed-at-last/,In the Red,"Good music doesn't always need to teem with willfully aesthetic and venerable ambition. For every Jim Morrison and prog-rock band, bound on one side by megalomania and on the other by ineptitude, there's a flagrantly idiotic band like The Stooges or The Sex Pistols, more concerned with having a guitarist who uses his instrument as a rowdy projectile than with having liner notes based on a Mabuse triptych and Das Kapital. Pussy Galore were a good band not because they were satirical, but because none of them knew how to play their instruments. And that is hilarious. Not many people can relate to the classical sublimity of guitarist Christopher Parkening, but everyone can relate to the thought that guitars sound crazy when you hit them on things. That was my pre-Secret Weapon Revealed at Last philosophy. Now I'm starting to wonder: Is dumb, improvisational noise-rock an essential component of modern music, or is it merely the remarkably infantile and incomprehensible product of some kids who taught themselves make-believe chords between episodes of Punk Planet USA? When this conflict hits the courts, let the noise-rockers pray that The Country Teasers have not been subpoenaed. The Scottish band had some quirky records back in the late 90s, the sort of music that easily offended patrons believe is cutely offensive, but difficultly offended ones find vapid and tiresome. While 1999's Destroy All Human Life had a penury of memorable songs, it did at least have a Tammy Wynette cover and some vaguely political satire to obscure the ineffectiveness of the band. The new album offers no such reprieve. The first song, ""Success"", like most of the album, belongs to the Dr. Demento school of disaster; these are either terrible songs or terrible parodies of terrible songs. This iteration may make interesting conceptual art, but it isn't very good music. (The song is so bad it made a Pitchfork reviewer invoke Dr. Demento.) It's a bedraggled, clumsy piece that tries to conglomerate noise, garage, and pop, and essentially fails at all of them. Sample lyric (if I heard correctly): ""Anna Kournikova was thirteen years old when she entered the world of sex/ I mean, success."" After interrogating that line for some time, it's unclear whether it's supposed to be entertaining. If so, is it intended to be entertaining on its own, or making fun of people/bands that think that line is entertaining? If you're anything like me, you probably didn't finish reading the preceding paragraph because you didn't care anymore. It's true that their former albums were comic rejoinders to the sort of people that don't recognize them as humorous, but this album, when it's tolerable, simply did not amuse me. If I couldn't possibly fathom the uproarious comedy because it's making fun of people like me, well then, I guess I despise it even more. Some songs, like ""Harry Wine 2"", are at least familiar as poor façades of better rock. The guitar riffs are rarely sustainable for more than five seconds, though some do make it to eight. I'm fairly certain ""Todtill"" involves only one chord. This may sound like a clamorously ideal melding of Scottish country with Japanese noise, but it's delivered more like one-third of the chorus of a Rancid song. After I heard it for the first time, I thought to myself, ""Why isn't my stereo working?"" Then I realized I was so bored that I'd started to mentally efface my faculty for listening. The most complimentary sentiment I can muster is that this album has horrific production. Even then, however, many albums have worse. I realize this was a particularly ostentatious review, written by some haughty upstart who thinks he knows about music, but I honestly think I could make a better album than this, even though I currently suffer from poor eyesight, bronchitis, and a sizeable gash that precludes the use of my right hand.","Good music doesn't always need to teem with willfully aesthetic and venerable ambition.

The Marionette and the Music Box,Unwed Sailor,by: Bill Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8fbb1335d7bf16993ef/1:1/w_160/87a93089.jpg,2003-08-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8377-the-marionette-and-the-music-box/,Burnt Toast Vinyl,"Before I, as a candid and loyal servant of the musically insatiate, etch in stone my clumsy wisdom, the Patron Saint of Objectivity prays I first make a confession: I don't generally get along with concept albums. My first reaction is typically one of disappointment filtered through indignity: Hey, don't tell me what to make of your music. F.Y.I., I happen to enjoy the tabula rasa privilege of formulating my own basis for analysis and drawing up my own, personal associations for your music. I want to be the judge of this, and I certainly don't want you to be the judge of how it is I should render my judgment. Then I grow up. Some. The Marionette and the Music Box is, yes, a concept album about a damned marionette and a music box. How do I know this? Because I was cold-cocked in the face with it. Unwed Sailor created the album as a companion piece to Jamie Hunt's 17-plate illustrated children's book which spins the tale of our two protagonists and is included in the liner notes. The song titles double as captions to the plates, and feature such narrative-driven handles as ""Meeting of the Marionette and the Music Box"", ""The Separation. A Hopeless Pursuit"", and ""The Return to Open Arms"". You get the picture: all 17 of them. Which, truth be told, are a small accomplishment on their own right. The music itself is a truncated version of previous Unwed Sailor material, which in turn was a truncated version of bassist Jonathan Ford's Roadside Monument material. Whereas earlier Unwed Sailor releases were dynamic, weaving mathy elements of guitar, bass, and drums into the sort of instrumental rock that's correctly served without lyrical accompaniment, The Marionette's formula isn't as replete. The band chose to forgo, for the first sixteen tracks, actual drumming in lieu of subtler, more softly textured percussion. Delicate guitar interplay, by turns warily ambitious and content in tone, is augmented by creaking doors, rhythmic tapping, sparse bells, organs, and chirping birds. The entire album, lacking a skeletal grounding, is light and wistful, and though it never soars it likewise never sinks. None of the songs, save for the return-to-form closer ""Jubilee"", boldly stand out either in construction or accomplishment. It has its moments, but, as a testament to its cohesiveness, could veritably have been divided into one or two tracks-- and I get the feeling Jonathan and company might take umbrage to the idea of using any one cut for the purposes of, say, a mixtape. Singling out the gentle acoustics and perfect timbre of ""At Peace in the Forest"" is tantamount to removing your favorite minute from any Godspeed song. I suppose the heart of my concern is this: what the band could once construct emotionally in one song is spread thin over the coarse of 38 minutes, and inextricably reliant on the extra-musical elements for succeeding in its aims-- aims that, need I remind you, I did not dictate or unjustifiably fabricate. Ultimately, I see the album as a moving away from one strength in favor of developing another. The stark, minimalist guitar work and overall atmosphere is simply a delight as background fare. While Unwed Sailor probably felt as if they were doing just the opposite, they chose to find a cure for a benign affliction, and in doing so temporarily abandoned the qualified (yet equally promising) success of earlier aspirations. Those of you reading this review in the distant future can feel free to subtract a few points from the rating for careless meddling if this turns out to have just been a pit stop, but if Unwed Sailor can break free from the fetters of accountability and move forward, all sins are forgiven. And that's where honesty will get you.","Before I, as a candid and loyal servant of the musically insatiate, etch in stone my clumsy wisdom, the Patron ...

Ambulance Ltd EP,Ambulance LTD,by: Nicholas B.

These bands attempt to meticulously emulate that which they cannot themselves imagine, and always to middling results. Others mimic certain elements of multiple bands and combine them into one incongruous whole. Still others snatch bits of existing songs, employing artist license to add heft to their own work by nabbing someone else's. These techniques are rarely effective in any other respect than making these bands look like total dipshits. But there's one technique that consistently produces interesting results: when a band simply touches the influences that inspire them, acknowledging their force but also challenging them. Music as an artform evolves when talented bands touch and are touched-- when, if you will, they abide by Newton's Third Law of Motion. Ambulance Ltd. is a young, talented Brooklyn quintet that violates that law. Their self-titled EP is a collection of five vastly different songs, each an expert forgery of the work of some 90s indie rock muse. But considering the band's malleability and wide-ranging rock sensibility, it's particularly frustrating that these songs are only isolated forgeries and not the riveting atom-splitters that could have resulted. ""Stay Where You Are"" is Ambulance's Elliott Smith song. Like all Smith compositions, it's melodically very pretty-- singer Marcus Congleton even pulls off a confident imitation of Smith's vocals. Guitars are subdued, only coming to prominence every two bars to announce a change in chord, but providing a distinct internal drive. The drumming is masterfully subtle: the bass drum puts four to the floor, accompanied by a steady ride and some occasional tom work. It takes two minutes, however, for a snare to enter the mix at all, finally breaking up the bass drum's steady pound and setting the rest of the instrumentation free. It's slightly gimmicky, sure, but the effect is nicely dramatic, and has much to do with this track being the EP's standout. After the ho-hum, honky-tonk regurgitation ""Primitive (The Way I Treat You)"", Ambulance launch into ""Heavy Lifting,"" a song composed of three very distinct parts. First comes the My Bloody Valentine shoegazing portion, followed by an early Beatles interlude, and then, perhaps ironically, a climax unlaudably ripped from the piano solo in Guns N' Roses' ""November Rain"". Elsewhere, ""Helmsman"" learned everything it knows from Washing Machine-era Sonic Youth, while ""Young Urban Professional"" is a fun lilt that one very well could have found on Yo La Tengo's most recent effort, Summer Sun. There have been several other bands mentioned as reference points for Ambulance Ltd.-- more than anyone could reasonably be expected to tolerate-- but it serves to reiterate that Ambulance is truly a very malleable band with tons of energy and much occupation with detail. Here, they've very meticulously (though perhaps unwittingly) isolated their influences. With any luck, they'll grow more adventurous on future releases, recontextualize those influences, and arrive at their own unique sound-- a blueprint for future Ambulance Ltd.'s to emulate in their embryonic stages.","Sometimes it astounds me how many bands are content to callously rip off the sounds of other artists.

Haha Sound,Broadcast,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a6b1335d7bf1698792/1:1/w_160/537af7cd.jpg,2003-08-26 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/947-haha-sound/,Warp,"The little-known 1970 Czech vampire film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders is a gorgeous blend of fairytale and horror show, a mix of surrealism, magical realism, and poetic visuals that explores the fears, desires, and sexual awakening of a young girl. That film-- which lends part of its title to Broadcast's ""Valerie""-- is also a fitting inspiration for the Birmingham, England band's second full-length album, Haha Sound, which walks a rope between awe and dread, human longing and sonic unrest. Haha Sound is a sharp turn from Broadcast's debut full-length, The Noise Made by People, and their early singles (collected on 1997's Work and Non-Work). As their album titles indicate, Broadcast are steeped in the exploration of the detail and nuance of ""noise"" and ""sounds."" On The Noise Made by People, the band created seamless, languid, soothing dreamscapes; here they've opted for a more cluttered, percussive rattle. As she has in the past, vocalist Trish Keenan still seems as if she's singing lullabies, though the rest of the group is more intent on inflicting nightmares. Keenan's opening confession and request, ""I am gray/ Still on the page/ Colour me in,"" is heeded over the course of the record by her bandmates as her detached vocals and fragile melodies are accompanied by a carnival of vintage electronics and sometimes-cacophonous sheets of polyrhythms. Broadcast again retain their affection for charity shop sounds here, but the past they now explore is the mythical ideal of our millennial future as popularized in the 1950s by post-war consumerism-- a wide-eyed vision that found province in science fiction films, mid-century modern furniture, and the spectral pop produced by outer-space abstractionists like Joe Meek and Phil Spector. The ghost of Meek, in particular, is echoed most clearly on ""Man Is Not a Bird"", ""Minim"", and a trio of short instrumentals, which may be slightly off-putting to long-time listeners accustomed to Broadcast's sultry, soothing sounds. Fortunately, however, Haha Sound is compelling right from the word go, thanks to the leftfield Big Top melody of ""Colour Me In""-- perhaps the band's most overt homage to their unofficial patron saints, 60s psych-pop group The United States of America-- and the propulsive ""Pendulum"". A pop/rock band that has been affiliated with Drag City, Tommy Boy, and Warp, Broadcast seem comfortable as outsiders searching for their own unique aesthetic. On ""The Little Bell"", Keenan claims: ""Deep inside my wooden clock, there is a tick but not a tock/ Although into a room it chimes/ It only tells me half the time."" She could have easily been talking about Broadcast's approach to creating off-kilter beauty. On Haha Sound, Broadcast take the infectious tick of pop and add it to the head-music tock of often non-pop genres (European art house soundtracks, exotica, incidental music, Ohm-style electronic pioneers). The result is an enveloping, mysterious record that marries the idealism of ""the future of tomorrow today"" to the stark reality of the post-millennial present and finds beauty and fascination in the tussle between melody and rhythm.","The little-known 1970 Czech vampire film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders is a gorgeous blend of fairytale and horror ...

Hendrix with Ko EP,Manitoba,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39313d197565213bd6f/1:1/w_160/2367751a.jpg,2003-08-26 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5080-hendrix-with-ko-ep/,Leaf,"Perhaps it's because it was the first of the album's songs I heard, but ""Hendrix with Ko"" was for me the standout track of Manitoba's Up in Flames. Besides its layer upon layer of warm, gushing sound, it also held claim to the album's most grandiose beat, featured the delicate croon of Koushik Ghosh (who puts the ""Ko"" in this song's title), and boasted a fittingly high number of bah-bahs-bah's and handclaps. But ""Hendrix with Ko"" had something deeper to it: though its surface was purely beautiful, its intricate structures and nuances encapsulated Dan Snaith's effort with the album itself-- particularly in light of his earlier IDM work. This song, more than any other on Up in Flames, preserved Manitoba's mild penchant for the four-to-the-floor electronic pulse that surfaced on Start Breaking My Heart (in such tracks as ""Mammals Vs. Reptiles"" and ""Tits and Ass: The Great Canadian Weekend""), without sacrificing his giant new psych-pop sound. ""Hendrix with Ko"" seemed to be the truest to Snaith's role as IDM pastor: though it maintained a highly analog feel like the others on Up in Flames, its proclivity to beat seemed more informed by his previous electronic ethos. If ""the beat is the thing"" in ""Hendrix with Ko"", then it makes some kind of sense that Snaith includes with this EP two very beat-oriented, if very un-Up in Flames, B-sides. Unlike in the Jacknuggeted EP, whose bonus cuts seemed to share the same psychedelic tenor of its title track, it's hard to believe that ""Cherrybomb"" and ""Silver Splinters"" were even culled from the same studio sessions. The two tracks, as if stuck in the no-man's-land of the Snaith catalog, seem to function more or less as a missing link between Manitoba's two dissimilar releases: each presents common ground in Snaith's beat-happiness and his oft-dramatic vertical composition. ""Cherrybomb"" immediately cuts to a simple driving pulse, painted in the subtle pinks and blues of the Boards of Canada sound palette. An alarm clock rings on occasion, and the bell and organ sounds that we would hear throughout Up in Flames provide a deeper texture. ""Silver Splinters"", meanwhile, sports a big beat reminiscent of Gus Gus' Polydistortion, wavering in atmospheric intensity, replete with flute, handclaps, and even a Prefuse-style vocal scratch-up. A trumpet pushes the song into its next section when it flips its octave a la jazz standard ""Gingerbread Man"", all while a simple IDM lullaby persists amidst the madness. The Hendrix with Ko EP also includes, curiously, the ""Jacknuggeted"" video. Why this didn't have its place on that song's EP can probably be chalked up to a matter of timing (i.e. it may not have been completed when that single was released). It's a treat nonetheless, serving up a trippy frolic in the woods that perfectly complements the song. Revealing Manitoba B-sides and Quicktime movies hardly appeal to more than an already convinced contingent of Snaith worshippers, but if you count yourself among them (and you ought to), this is well worth picking up.","Perhaps it's because it was the first of the album's songs I heard, but ""Hendrix with Ko"" was ...

I'd really like to see them all collected in one place someday, because often, the Oval remix was the best thing the disc in question had to offer. Markus Popp's technique was not to pick out the catchiest bit and loop it as per custom, but to smash the track to pieces and see what could be assembled from the fragments. We would listen: ""Ah, yes, it's an Oval track, let's see what he left of the original. Hmm, not much, but there's something. Wow, this thing is gorgeous."" That's how it went. Among my favorite of the many Oval remixes was his processing of ""International Velvet"" on Takako Minekawa's Ximer EP. Popp took a light, airy J-pop tune and ran it through his digital wood chipper, and each little piece that came out the other end sparkled like a gold coin. ""International Velvet (Oval Remix)"" made it on to many mixtapes over the next couple years, and I've been waiting for Oval to do something as immediately accessible and striking ever since. Patience has been rewarded. Popp's new project, So, a collaboration with songwriter Eriko Toyoda from Japan, reminds me of what I loved about ""International Velvet"". Toyoda recorded a series of voice and guitar songs in her home in Mito-City, and then she and Popp went about deconstructing them. As with the last few Oval records, one sonic inspiration for the dense treatments seems to be the sound of decelerated explosions. The music is a series of volatile energy surges expanding outward, gradually swallowing the musical devices setting them in motion. For the first time since Dok, the skipped CD is seldom heard, but elements from Commers and Ovalprocess-- modem whines, organ fuzz, guitar feedback-- are intact. I should point out that the parameters of the collaboration are not clear and there is no record of who did what (the brilliant cover illustration by Katsumi Yokota leaves little room for detail about the music), but suffice to say, whoever had their hand on the mouse sounds a lot like Oval. Markus Popp has always had disdain for the title of ""composer."" His preferred term for his sound-making method is formally ""file management,"" but with So, he terms his contribution ""art direction."" This is a significant shift, I think-- one appropriate to the project at hand. From what I can guess about the nature of this collaboration, Toyoda provides the emotional script, Popp figures out how to light it, and they work together on the editing. Toyoda's loose, drifting vocals and instrumental melodies are twisted, accentuated, buried, chopped, or surrounded in a halo of harmonics, but they are the reference point. This arrangement plays to Popp's strengths as a sound manipulator. Judging from the uniformly high quality of his remixes over the years, he's a fantastic listener and understands intuitively what is most interesting about a particular sound or phrase. Each track is a unique, unpredictable swirl of voice, guitar, organ and god knows what else. These ten unnamed tracks vary considerably in terms of which of the original elements remains. The naked sound is most prevalent at the record's bookends. The first track begins with delicately plucked electric guitar, humming vocals, and something like a pennywhistle approximating a bird song. But within the first minute, the folk is picked apart and coated with a thick sheen of noise. The track breaks periodically and returns to Toyoda's guitar strumming, grounding again the flights of noise. The final number has a slow see-saw chord progression that could almost be a cover of Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"", and it remains a traditional ballad throughout, with slight intrusions of organ feedback that threaten to overwhelm but ultimately remain subjugated to Toyoda's lovely tune. It's a positively sublime closing track that perfectly illustrates the genius of the So collaboration, the finest record Popp has been involved with since 94diskont.","It seemed that, from '95 to '99, every remix collection had an Oval remix on it.

Visions of Gandhi,Jedi Mind Tricks,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1caeb335119a49ed60e/1:1/w_160/ebc14455.jpg,2003-08-26 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4337-visions-of-gandhi/,Babygrande,"Various songs on Visions of Gandhi contain quotations by Mike Tyson. The intention was probably to show how crazy the two-man producer/emcee team of Stoupe (The Enemy of Mankind) and Vinnie Paz is, but what ends up developing is a clear parallel: though Jedi Mind Tricks were once masterful rookies with a bright future, it could only have been a matter of time before they'd be dethroned; I don't know that they'll sink to the point of being convicted rapists with facial tattoos, but they've definitely been downed by Buster Douglas. After Jus Allah left the group, Jedi Mind Tricks slowly but surely moved away from the Wu-Tang/Jeru-influenced intelligent hoodlum rap they started out with to an awkward mix of murder rap and the shiniest boom-bap money can buy. Glimmers of discontent began showing on 2000's Violent by Design, and now, with Jus gone and no balance to the artist formerly known as Ikon the Verbal Hologram's intense desire for commercial success, Jedi Mind Tricks have become too commercial for the underground, but not commercial enough to make any money. Stoupe's production style is the most noticeable change. Swiftly, he's gone from being heralded as the second coming of the RZA to a half-and-half mix of The Beatnuts and Necro. At least five of the rhythm tracks here are mysteriously upbeat with an alarming Spanish flavor that does anything but compliment Vinnie Paz's style. Hearing ex-Ikon tell the listener, ""I like blood, I like tasting your flesh/ I like slugs, I'm like David Koresh,"" over a pleasant beat that wouldn't sound out of place on a detergent commercial is really awkward. The rest is a mish-mash of strangely plain orchestration, dark electronic and acoustic guitar beats. Just as Wu-Tang was once dirty with an aura of tightness, Stoupe's production now seems the epitome of unpolished commercial rap. Vinnie Paz is Visions of Gandhi's biggest problem. His downfall, too, mirrors his idols in Wu-Tang: his initial style was rugged and intelligent, but here he's grown too comfortable, wasting one of the strongest deliveries in hip-hop on violent anti-gay rhetoric (""you like to hold hands with faggots/ You like the smell of males on your mattress""), shock rap (""I'll stab you in the bladder with a dagger and watch you die in piss"") and how much he hates everyone (""I fucking hate you/ I hate your mother and father because they made you/ I hate the universe because it create you/ I hate anyone and anything that embrace you""). It's a poor man's Eminem vying for Top 40 approval. The album's guest verses, fortunately, go a long way toward saving this record from being a complete disaster: showing an excellent break from Vinnie Paz. Ras Kass (one of the best rappers of all-time-- also currently incarcerated) drops a gem on ""Rise of the Machines"" (""Each rhyme's a minority report, fuck Tom Cruise""); Percee-P kills on ""Walk with Me"" (""I'm the poet who's rhyme was quoted, mind's unloaded/ Shine decoded the water flow in showing signs I wrote it""), while Non-Phixion, Kool G Rap and Tragedy Khadafi steal the show simply by holding their own. And then there's Canibus, the Internet's greatest has-been, who drops two verses of absolute nonsense. It's completely staggering, hearing him threaten to ""discombobulate [confuse?!] prostates"" and claim that his ""metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born."" His lack of knowledge shakes me on a personal level. It should be noted that the best songs are hidden tracks. Stoupe's greatest achievement, ""I Against I"", from Violent by Design makes an appearance, with a subtly chopped piano that shows the difference in technical proficiency between the new and old tracks. It also highlights another serious problem with Visions of Gandhi: a complete lack of concern for subtlety. Rather than pairing the darker tracks with lighter subject matter, the album is just a mix of angry lyrics over upbeat and downtempo production. The last time I saw Mike Tyson, he was co-hosting The Jimmy Kimmel Show. He made some reference to the movie Gremlins and everybody laughed-- at him, not with him. Could be how Jedi Mind Tricks feel right now.","Various songs on Visions of Gandhi contain quotations by Mike Tyson. The intention was probably to show how crazy the ...

Clones,The Neptunes,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c451c0084474cd0c3674/1:1/w_160/2e89114c.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5876-clones/,AristaStar Trak,"The curse of the compilation lies in its very premise: compile a staggering array of artists and create a cash-raking style war, a soundclash to bump in your truck. Unfortunately, like with most CDs filed under Various Artists, The Neptunes' newest woofer-friendly venture, Clones, is an exercise in failing to be everything to everyone. The hottest production team in music today, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams have crafted a million dollar organization out of their deceptively simple beatmaking style. They've worked with everyone from Daft Punk to Beenie Man, and this disc is the proverbial victory lap at the peak of their success. So, as expected, they've drafted the very biggest stars out of their two-way pager address books to develop a venerable who's-who in hip-hop today. Ironically, the biggest names fare the worst. The most established artists realize that with their level of notoriety, they no longer need to impress. Snoop Dogg, Ludacris and Nelly each sleepwalk through their performances, with beats that complement their lack of interest and lack of concern with diversifying their portfolios. Busta Rhymes is laced with a crisp jungle funk backdrop that samples Kraftwerk, but he also fails to live up to the task at hand, settling on saying the word ""ass"" about a hundred times. Even the Star Trak artists disappoint. Rosco P. Coldchain's collaboration with Pusha T and Boo Bonic, ""Hot"", falls on its face, based on the incorporation of a lame barebones interpolation of the Beastie Boys' ""Paul Revere"" and lackluster verses from all involved. Arguably the worst song on the album, Fam-Lay comes off like Eazy-E on morphine on ""Rock N' Roll"", claiming he has ""so much coke, got coke in jail."" Surprising to see a majority of the eighth planet populace's affiliates don't share the same agenda for innovation. On the other hand, when the Neptunes step out of their accepted hip-hop box, they find their greatest success. The highly anticipated new N.E.R.D track naturally isn't very interesting, lyrically (""We will not be the losers"" is this generation's ""We Are the Champions""), but is stunning, beatwise. A laser-guided funk missile collides with handclaps and a pulsing bassdrum backbeat, on a spiraling trajectory towards surprisingly inspirational lyrics from the Clipse. Speaking of the Clipse, they drop the best song on the album through their clever attempt to reinvent the success of last year's ""Grindin'"". The 'Tunes assemble the twins with Ab-Liva over a hard drum loop that's accented by rumbling bass, handclaps, an infrequent cellphone alert and what can only be described as a layer of Batman theme-esque horns. It stands to succeed in its purpose, primarily due to the Clipse's ""pastors of the church of Jay-Hova"" approach. Pusha T, in particular, impresses, claiming he ""hurries the 'cane like Miami U"". Like ""Grindin'"" refined, pitch shifted and swallowed by the Bomb Squad, ""Blaze of Glory"" forecasts the upcoming Clipse record as a definite must-hear. Production is the strongest facet of this album, with The Neptunes handling all tracks with their trademark of being exceedingly technical in their simplicity. From the fuzz-bass and stuttering organ stabs of Kelis' ""Popular Thug"" to the bowling alley imperial march through nuclear winter on ""Blaze of Glory"", The Neptunes move all around the style map. With other excellent appearances from Nas, Supercat, Jadakiss and Dirt McGirt, Clones manages to succeed in delivering a worthwhile listening experience without fully realizing the goal of an innovative star mash. The Neptunes may be at their creative, commercial and financial peak, but if this album is any indication, they should expect a long tenure at the top of the musical ladder.","The curse of the compilation lies in its very premise: compile a staggering array of artists and create a cash-raking ...

Dodeka,Arne Nordheim,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b95713d197565213ae24/1:1/w_160/623655ac.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5879-dodeka/,Rune Grammofon,"Before it's analyzed or ""appreciated,"" Arne Nordheim's Dodeka has to be enjoyed: listening to this record is a tactile experience. Like drops of water caught by a strobe light or slivers of ice ready to melt to water, these electronic sounds are tensing on the edge of tangibility: you can almost feel them as they pour through your fingers. Nordheim once based a work around the image of a solitaire diamond, and here, too, his compositions shimmer like stones of unmeasured preciousness. The arch clarity and profound body of the sounds give no sign that these works are over thirty years old. Dodeka is the third Rune Grammofon release to champion and resurrect the works of Arne Nordheim. For a man who's often praised as Norway's greatest living composer, Nordheim started his career by pushing his country to keep up with him. He first discovered electronic music in Paris in the mid-50s, but back home, musicians were refusing to play new music; reportedly, Oslo's Trinity Church actually forbid the organ works of György Ligeti. Over the next decade, as a composer and critic, Nordheim challenged his country's conservative establishment to accept new music. That's a battle he won a long time ago. He's earned renown in Norway and abroad, not only for innovative electronic music, but for acoustic works like the striking ""Aftonland"", for soprano and chamber ensemble, and ""Greening"", commissioned in 1973 by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra. (Serious Nordheim explorers can run through the full range of his work on the staggering seven-disc box set Listen: The Art of Arne Nordheim, on Aurora.) And as much as he rebelled against demands to write more ""folklorist"" music, he doesn't shy away from local attachments: he's written for the Oslo City Hall Carillon, and ""OHM"" features the valley-sweeping bellows of a Norwegian mountain horn. Rune Grammofon has focused on reviving his electronic works, and 1998's Electric dug up major works like ""Solitaire"" and ""Colorazione"" that were barely available for the past thirty years. By contrast, the twelve pieces on Dodeka have never been released. Nordheim's brief liner notes talk about them more than anything in sentimental terms, describing them as ""too resonant to forget."" The album documents a key part of his career, but Dodeka is also deeply engrossing for its obsessive refinement, and its subtle emotional depth. Even if I could detail the working methods and technologies that went into these pieces, it would just distract from how free of context they sound: from the tinkling high notes that evade tempo like a hand-cranked music box, to the pensive echo and boom of the deep lower tones, none of the sounds betray their origin or hint at any source at all. They also defy narrative: each piece runs around three minutes, but in this set of miniatures certain sounds and motifs repeat from piece to piece, leading up to ""Summa"", where Nordheim runs them all together to get a sound like a city of alien clocks ringing different hours. But although they're abstract, these works are far from dry. A halting emotional tone-- I can't call it ""warmth,"" though its coolness makes it stronger-- suffuses these pieces, fractionally expressed in tense pauses and isolated murmurs. Nordheim has characterized it as a ""yearning,"" and in these works he distills that feeling, without object or nostalgia, into an incredible purity. And while there's much to enjoy and study in his technique, it's that engagement which makes the music vital-- even after so many years in the vault.","Before it's analyzed or ""appreciated,"" Arne Nordheim's Dodeka has to be enjoyed: listening to this\n\ record is ...

Forms and Follies,Lonesome Organist,by: Bill Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd445e6ef9596932300b/1:1/w_160/8f2c9777.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4838-forms-and-follies/,Thrill Jockey,"Writing up an original review for any Lonesome Organist release might be best described as playing a solitary game of critical Taboo: it's instantly apparent that there exists a specific set of unavoidable descriptive clichés and overly pitched idiosyncrasies chaperoning all previous and current press for this band-- often due to an inability to creatively parallel the level of the phenomenon: the more unique the spectacle, the less inventive the appraisal. So, in honor of the tenth anniversary of the Milton Bradley game of terminological no-no, I've drawn up a shortlist of words and terms to sidestep for the rest of this review. I will be given five words and phrases, along with ninety seconds on the timer. Start the clock... now. My buzzwords are (as determined by highest journalistic prevalence): multi-instrumentalist, novelty (act), vaudevillian, simultaneous (ly), and one-man. Forms and Follies is the third full-length player recorded by Chicagoan Jeremy Jacobsen (better known as The Lonesome Organist) as well as his first release since the turn of the century. Though it's not at all uncommon for a solo artist to release material under a distinct bandname or even play all of the instruments on an album, it is slightly more atypical for the artist to play them all simul- er, all at the same time, as does Mr. Jacobsen. For his latest release, he had as many as eight tracks available to him, which is considerably more than he had at his disposal for previous albums, but only rarely did he utilize more than a few. For several songs he played drums, guitar, keys and sang; all jointly. The formula alone is cause enough for concern and admittedly makes me a touch anxious. It's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt. The result is an eclectic, curious, seething mass of sound, sometimes delicate, often garbled and rough, and frequently meandering to the point of disenfranchisement. That he's a singular musical talent with a unique vision isn't debatable. The payoff, however, is. A large portion of the disc, though interesting and tastefully unconventional, is devoid of any real compulsion or atmospheric engagement, and is rendered a mere curiosity with multiple listens. Songs like ""The Multiplier"", a two-minute, frenetic organ-driven track, feel like thirty second interludes gone a minute-and-a-half too long. In fact, much of the material on the disc feels a bit too much like filler. The album's more structurally cognizant moments, such as the jazzy, upbeat ""The Moped"", reminiscent of his earlier, more (comparatively) inhibited work with 5ive Style and Euphone, provide the strongest material. The above track is marked by a compelling series of track-long drum rolls and fills and a frugal bassline, and is abetted by digressive but nifty keys and fulgent chimes. A few tracks have vocals, and two are actually sans-instrumentation altogether; Doo-wop tributes that hearken back to a time more suited to our anachronistic Lonesome Organist. Just as Les Miserables is far better served by the stage then as a cinematic vehicle for Claire Danes, The Lonesome Organist can be most appreciated in a live setting where his physical urgency and arresting compositions are best underscored. His one-m, his, uh... his unaccompanied live performances have received widespread encomium and are said to be the best judge of his musical merit. Unfortunately, you can't burn visceral engrossment or artistic perspiration on to a compact disc, and for this, Forms and Follies suffers.","Writing up an original review for any Lonesome Organist release might be best described as playing a\n\ solitary game ...

Keep It Together,Guster,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfd3ea9e61561daa7b09/1:1/w_160/af6892f3.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3609-keep-it-together/,Reprise,"It's gotta be hard being a band with a schtick. Well, let me clarify that a bit-- it's easy being a band with an image schtick, like Manowar in their leather underwear and fantasy battle gear, but not to be a band with a musical one: after all, staying within the set parameters of one distinct sound tends to result in artists either making the same album over and over again, or limiting their creativity to the point that the quality of their music suffers. Morphine had that problem to a degree, but they compensated with little deviations like ""In Spite of Me"", and ultimately even abandoned their stripped bass/drums/sax approach on their overlooked swansong, The Night. The fact is, Morphine had to change on that last album to avoid becoming totally lost in the cul de sac they found themselves in on their previous release, 1997's Like Swimming. God only knows what they'd sound like today if Mark Sandman was still with us. Traveling further up the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority's Red Line, we find another Boston-area band discovering that a distinctive sound can quickly become a well-worn rut, and subsequently branching out. Guster originally emerged from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts in the mid-90s with a pair of self-released albums that brought their two-guitars-and-bongos busker act to the studio and earned them a bucketload of worshipful praise from the Boston music press. There was a charming simplicity to their portable music, but-- as my esteemed colleague Mark Richardson once remarked about them on this very site-- when you're doing the stripped-down acoustic thing, every song has to hit hard or your album won't hold up. Guster actually realized this in time for their third album, 1998's Lost & Gone Forever, an album I still give a spin from time to time. That record could have easily been trounced by Steve Lillywhite's spit-shine production, but the songs were so intricately layered and expertly crafted that I didn't really mind. Still, that album's liner notes crowed about the fact that all the drumming was done sans-sticks, and the band's overall dynamic and intensity hadn't changed at all-- they'd just elevated their craft and got a bigger budget. A whole five years later, the band has given up all pretense of preserving their original setup, purchased a drumkit. generously endowed each of their songs with basslines, and even gone so far as to bring aboard Yo La Tengo producer Roger Moutenot. The trio certainly has no shortage of catchy melodies on hand here, and they open with a three-song volley that'll stick straight to the roof of your mouth. ""Diane"" is brisk, polite pop spattered with sparingly applied harmonies, while ""Careful"" takes that formula and squares it, ratcheting up the harmonies the band does so well and taking the time for details like a brief tempo change and some burbling guitar jangle. But it's ""Amsterdam"" you'll never get out of your head-- this song is so insidiously catchy it could be the theme to a fucking sitcom. It's not as cloylingly sentimental as, say, The Rembrandts, but it's got the requisite squeaky-clean jangle and buoyant harmonies for any number of Jason Alexander vehicles currently in development. The highlight award is stolen by ""Homecoming King"", which gives a nod to the hand percussion they built their name on, but makes full use of a rubberband bassline and some harp-like, almost African guitar parts. What Keep it Together has in highs, though, it also has in ho-hum middles-- indeed, it never approaches the track-to-track mastery that Lost & Gone Forever did, painting the corners with midtempo filler like ""Backyard"" and ""Ramona"", which are by no means bad, but won't likely grab you at all, either. The band are naturally right at home with the front porch banjo folk of ""Jesus on the Radio"", but when they try a detour into stuttering prog-pop on the cheekily titled ""Red Oyster Cult"" (you forgot the umlaut, guys-- get on the ball!), they wind up wasting some good melodies on a distracting arrangement that thinks it's ""Achilles' Last Stand"". The thing that really bothers me the most about this album is how conventional it sounds. Guster are undeniably accomplished tunesmiths, but the quirks that show up here in the form of, say, the background whistling on ""Long Way Down"" or the strange schoolkid choir and fluffy strings of the hidden track used to be more prominent, and it made them a band you could embrace for their artfulness as much as you could listen to them. There's still plenty of chicken soup for your pop soul here, but this time the broth is from concentrate.","It's gotta be hard being a band with a schtick. Well, let me clarify that a bit-- it's ...

Secondary Protocol,Wildchild,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa83b1335d7bf169969d/1:1/w_160/88b20522.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8758-secondary-protocol/,Stones Throw,"After years of playing second-fiddle to the mainstream, underground hip-hop is finally making serious waves. Due in no small part to the ghetto-tech innovations of The Neptunes/Timbaland axis, even the hardest-to-please music fans have, over the past few years, been flocking to the mainstream for their hip-hop fixes-- but now, with Def Jux running underground shit and endless collectives (the Anticon, Rhymesayers, and Stones Throw crews, to name just a few) thriving, some of the illest stuff going these days is flying well below the MTV radar. Stones Throw, in particular, has had one hell of a productive year, with MC/producer/ringleader Madlib's seemingly endless stream of records (Madvillain, Jaylib, Yesterday's New Quintet, Shades of Blue) and recent releases by Dudley Perkins and Stark Reality responsible for much of the label's recent acclaim. Strange, then, that the anticipated solo release by Madlib's Lootpack cohort Wildchild is so very pedestrian. Produced by Madlib and fellow Stones Throw-er Oh No, Secondary Protocol should, by all accounts, be one of the year's hip-hop highlights. Instead, it's a merely passable record marked by a handful of solid singles. There are certainly plenty of interesting ideas at work here, and sometimes they come together: The first of the aforementioned singles, ""Code Red"", won't settle the ongoing debate over Wildchild's lyrical skills, but the banging, clickety-clack percussion track will surely keep heads nodding. The other, ""Party Up"", rides on a funk bassline and scratchy, distant bell percussion, with female vocals providing the song's hook-- both tracks, recently featured on a single 12-inch, will likely make lots of hipster mixtape-hitlists this year. Likewise, ""Wonder Years"" shows Wildchild's flow at its best, albeit with at least one head-scratching line: ""Child ponders, 'Why is it okay to drink when marijuana is still illegal?/ Though I don't smoke I wish I knew how to change it for my people."" Coming from such a close associate of Madlib (by his own admission, motherfucker smokes enough herb that he should've turned into a bush by now), such a declaration of personal innocence seems downright odd. Lyrical enigmas notwithstanding, Secondary Protocol has trouble creating an aesthetic identity. ""The Movement"" shapes up as a routine ""respect for hip-hop"" number, with Wildchild dropping overwrought lines about his loyalty to the hip-hop tradition (""Making 'em pack deep/ Like the movie Wild Style did it""). And while ""Bounce"" and ""Secondary Protocol"" show promise, they quickly wind up encumbered by too many ideas crammed into tiny sonic spaces. ""Bounce"" is especially reprehensible: it begins interestingly enough, with flatulent synth burbling, but by the time the vocals kick in, the track reveals itself as a decent production idea burdened by its clumsy execution. Tuneless, defiantly funkless, and packed full of weak rhymes, it's the absolute nadir of both this record and Wildchild's career to date. ""Code Red"" ends with a mock Q&A; session between Wildchild and a probing journalist. Responding to a question about the album's personal nature, Wildchild goes off on a tangent to explain that Secondary Protocol is for ""the mainstream heads, the worldwide heads, universal."" And therein lies the problem: he seems to want this record to be all things to all people. There's not a lot obviously wrong here, but coming from a member of the Lootpack (whose 1999 LP Soundpieces: Da Antidote was a milestone for underground hip-hop), Secondary Protocol is just too damn homely to make a lasting impression in these heady days of consistently intense one-upmanship throughout the underground scene.","After years of playing second-fiddle to the mainstream, underground hip-hop is finally making serious waves.

The New Millennium,Holger CzukayU-She,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d09d034d5c69bf3628/1:1/w_160/a552ed08.jpg,2003-08-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1711-the-new-millennium/,Funfundvierzig,"Holger Czukay was born in 1938 and studied music from a very young age. He had initially entertained dreams of being a classical composer and conductor, but when his ideas brushed up against an academy who hadn't come to grips with musique concrete (much less rock and roll), his plans changed, and soon he found himself under one of the few sympathetic souls in new music, Karlheinz Stockhausen. That's an understatement, of course, as Stockhausen was arguably the highest figure in modern classical music beginning from the 1950s and to now, and his work looms large over any experimental music being made during the time young Czukay would have been with him-- be it classical, rock or otherwise. During the mid-60s, Czukay also taught composition; one of his students was an even younger Michael Karoli, and through him, Czukay was introduced to the world of rock via The Beatles and The Velvet Underground. He then teamed up with fellow Stockhausen associate Irmin Schmidt, a jazz drummer called Jaki and an American street poet of some esteem. The rest is history. Oh, but then there was the part about how Czukay was one of the first people to sample, and about how his solo music of the late 60s is among is some of the most groundbreaking in all of electronic music. And by the way, he's still pushing forward in his own music, turning out better beats and more interesting textures than most DJs half (or even a third) his age. If this sounds like an infomercial, it's only to set up the intimidating backlog of history one might consider when approaching a new Czukay record. There, now it's your turn to carry the baggage. Luckily, Czukay's music is fresh enough that you don't have to remember the good old days to appreciate it. Unlike all but the most tirelessly devoted classical alchemists (sorry Kraftwerk), this man at 65 is pressing on like someone without the slightest care for pacing or an idea of how people his age are supposed to drift away. The New Millennium (despite library fines on the title) is his latest collaboration with the enigmatic, tone-be-damned seductress U-She-- or as Czukay's website about her says, ""under construction."" It's a record that pulls out many of the composer's familiar ideas, but is also admirably modern-- almost effortlessly so. Ultimately, he hasn't slowed down, and that's good news. Since The New Millennium begins with a piece called ""Le Secondaire"" (a remix of an older Czukay tune called ""La Premiere"") built out of bits of Can's ""Chain Reaction"", you'd be forgiven for thinking he was attempting to pillage his back catalog for ideas. In a way, maybe he was, but since he's been putting samples to good use for decades, no one should be shocked that he's able to make some pretty captivating house out of that stuff now. U-She's French vocals fight off a whole cast of other voices spouting things in varied speeds, and out-of-time drum machine breaks punctuate the beat where most dance producers would patch in a cymbal swell. Likewise, on ""Rosebud"", the holy house bass drum drafts no snare to back it up and only a chorus of U-She and Sinai fanfares to give it color. Czukay's version of dance music is just as tribal as it ever was, but these days his flair for pristine production and immaculately placed, ever-changing samples that make up the real heart of his music are the marks of a master. Not every tune is there for the grinding: ""Cinderella"" begins with a frantic flurry of triangle and church bells with accented bass notes in the piano. Before long, the ensemble gives way to cavernous echo and fidgety tic-tac percussion, and just as suddenly, the ""beat"" comes back with electro congas and art-house horror asides from U-She. In truth, her contributions may not be everyone's idea of interesting, but in the context of these pieces she actually manages to tie otherwise unconnected sections together, forging an unlikely ""pop"" out of ""avant-garde."" Oddly enough, the only time this doesn't really work is on the de facto pop song of the bunch, ""Millennium"". It isn't so much that U-She wavers ever so slightly with the tune so much as Czukay's arrangement of oboes and New Age synth never manage to crash the party of big fat 80s drums. This is a shame, too, because ""Millennium"" is exactly the kind of song Can made work-- think ""Moonshake"" with more than one good chord change. ""Supernova"" features Czukay's own spoken-word vocals over still more restless, precision jitter-house. I hear samples of strange Eastern stringed instruments, what sounds like a chamber ensemble of saws and cellos, several thousand percussion instruments that go ""ping,"" and oddly timed handclaps and one-measure organ solos. ""Metropolis"" begins with a loop of flute, succeeding to bassoon and then onto spooky reverb and atonal guitar mutterings. Throughout The New Millennium, the details impress and their integration into an interesting whole seals the deal-- and despite all of this, it's still U-She's relatively untouched vocals that seem most out of place. The first time I listened to this album, I was a little disappointed that Czukay's drum sounds seemed a tad dated, as if from the not-so-distant past. However, those kinds of worries could take a backseat the more I concentrated on the number of other things happening in his pieces. Obviously, if you're looking for something to spin during a mix, The New Millennium might not be the best choice-- at least at first. Still, Czukay's been called ""subversive"" before, and under the right circumstances, I could see him infiltrating a whole new academy.",,7.6,
Cool Rock,Chris Lee,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc15e6ef95969322ef3/1:1/w_160/d63cf77f.jpg,2003-08-24 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4714-cool-rock/,Misra,"The cheeky, borrowed falsetto has been cracking up the U.S. pop charts this summer, giving proud citizens all across America a perfectly valid excuse to indulge their normally repressed, squeaky and lustful whines: somehow, howling along with the cab radio has never sounded as sexy as it does right now. Appropriately, singer/songwriter Chris Lee's third record, Cool Rock, sees Lee maintaining the same high, heady croon that instantly earmarked his work back in 2000. But Lee's meandering easy-listening vocals don't come with the same kind of lemme-borrow-this-for-a-sec homage that Pharrell's or Justin's have so neatly built inside. Mostly, his warbling coos just feel disembodied and awkwardly appropriated, like a trucker hat that hasn't been properly tweaked; whereas Lee's pop contemporaries openly own and toy with the results of their stealthy pilfering, it's like Lee just pretends that Stevie never even happened! The result is karaoke-Buckley, a record full of vaguely self-indulgent vocal noodling without the grinning nuance required to make anybody want to roll down the windows, crinkle their nose, and yowl along. Clocking in at a little over thirty minutes, Cool Rock plays like a smoothed-out, perpetually swooning exercise in pseudo-soulfulness. It's not so much that Lee himself seems especially disingenuous or affected (although he occasionally does), it's that his songwriting has somehow disintegrated into shapelessness-- which, in turn, exponentially amps up the inherent sappiness of gooey soul-singing. Lee's self-titled debut was comparably sharp and capable, with a sort of quasi-Southern, bashful charm; Cool Rock is mushy and benign, with most of the record's eight tracks lost in a haze of overwrought vocal cartwheeling, vague backbeats, and garrulous guitars. Lee has gone elevator-polite, laying down the smarmy sentiments and boring instrumentation without the slightest bit of self-awareness. Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley mans the drumkit for Lee (Shelley released Lee's second record, Plays and Sings Torch'd Songs, Charivari Rhythms, and Oriki Blue-Marches on his own label, Smells Like Records, back when Lee was still earning a shitload of half-hearted Buckley comparisons), but his musical influence seems pretty negligible, as Lee lumbers from adult contemporary ballads to poppy swan songs. There are a handful of redeeming moments: the overdubbed horns on ""(I Was a Teenage) Symphony to God"" are so unselfconsciously predictable and retro-lounge that they're almost charming. Perhaps more notably, the somewhat ironically titled and buried-at-the-back ""Say It Ain't Soul"" is an unquestionably solid, standout track-- thankfully spare instrumentation (on Cool Rock, less is almost always more) showcases Lee's undeniable vocal prowess and range, and his wails are finally pretty convincing. Then, a few minutes later, the record ends.","The cheeky, borrowed falsetto has been cracking up the U.S. pop charts this summer, giving proud citizens all across ...

Earthquake Glue,Guided by Voices,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc413d197565213b92f/1:1/w_160/39245ee2.jpg,2003-08-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3595-earthquake-glue/,Matador,"What spectral force, illusion, or trick of light has fooled so many erstwhile critics into apologizing for Robert Pollard over these long years since the broadly accepted twilight of Guided by Voices' reign over the (very nearly) barren kingdom of indie rock as we now know it? The sum of all the criticism heaped on GBV for years (excepting Do the Collapse-- universally agreed upon as the absolute nadir of the band's catalog), all the way back to Mag Earwhig!, has amounted to barely more than a weak-kneed ""wait 'til next year."" And we waited, and some of us are still waiting, while others have simply given up; critics have been crying wolf for years, so who can really blame folks for finally losing faith? So how did he do it? Critics, notoriously, are jackals, trying, always trying, to thin the herd, to cull the sick and dying at the first sign of weakness; Pollard, it would seem, has been staggering around on his last legs for three or four not-so-hot-to-lukewarm albums (if that sounds like revisionist history, it's only 'cause history was wrong in the first place). And yet he still lives! How? His only defense, I now submit to you: pure enthusiasm, a forever-young charm; I can see no other explanation. There have been plenty of unlikely rock heroes, but after fifteen (!) albums, only Robert Pollard still sounds, for all the highs and lows, like an ex-schoolteacher trying to live the dreams of his idols, still trying to grow into Pete Townshend's arena-sized shoes. Deep down, I firmly believe, even Pollard's critics want him to succeed, or at least would rather forget him than be forced to say he failed. By now, you've seen the rating (go on, look) and if even the expectation of the phrase ""better than the last few GBV albums"" stirs only cynicism within your jaded insides, it might just be the case that you're in healthy working order. As a reformed Robert Pollard apologist, I will not ask you to see the promise of better things to come from here or wait 'til next year; I'll go one better: Earthquake Glue meets any GBV album that isn't named Bee Thousand or Alien Lanes. It sounds improbable, but all I'm asking you to believe is that Bob's year to finally make good on any incubating potential he's shown since the halcyon days of Tobin Sprout has finally arrived. A ""Guided by Voices album"" has meant too much, for too long, to too many (and if you need reasons, I just mentioned both of them), but this isn't a normal GBV album. This is Bob Pollard at his most direct, most natural, and finally ready to shake the stadiums down to their very foundations. It's no secret that Bob Pollard's Who-caliber aspirations have been leaking into his work way back since he had a devil between his toes-- you can hear Roger Daltrey turning green with every swelling power chord of ""Wished I Was a Giant"" and earlier. He's masked it for a long time with whimsically beautiful lyrics, lo-fi production, and generally keeping the guitar windmilling to a minimum on soft-spoken classics like ""Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"", but it's been fully silenced. It hardly needs to be said, but when folks describe you in terms like ""whimsical,"" like a Dr.Seuss character-cum-pop superstar (the main character in Robert Hears The Who), filling Madison Square Garden ain't gonna be easy, probably impossible. But steadily, Bob's realized this and begun shedding the belovedly quirky trappings of his past; what's felt like ""falling off"" for so long was really gradual metamorphosis into a different beast entirely. Earthquake Glue differs from any past incarnation of GBV; the anthems here are realized to the fullest height of their earthly majesty, with no real pretense of the muddy indie aesthetic GBV helped to usher in out of sheer fiscal necessity more than a decade ago. This is not the shiny, breezy pop rock and crunch of Isolation Drills; ""I'll Replace You with Machines"", ""Beat Your Wings"", ""Apology in Advance""-- these are smoke machines, strobe lights, and pyrotechnics. And Bob, with his vaguely raspy, vaguely British lilt, sits center stage, twirling his microphone, pumping his fist with the practiced air of a rock star who truly has ""been around the block,"" and in a nod to his various ups and downs, ""even threw up one street over."" He ""keeps searching, turning on, equally frustrated,"" but without any hint of self-conscious indie antics, maybe no longer; whether brooding on the shiftless, railcar blues of ""Dirty Water"" or transcendent on ""Dead Cloud"", Pollard never struggles to find powerful vocal hooks. It finally seems effortless. Even more surprisingly, it doesn't sound like it's just Bob's show anymore; GBV is no longer a euphemism for ""Robert Pollard and his faceless, rotating cast of backing musicians""-- these guys actually sound like an honest-to-god-swear-on-some-bibles band. There's actual, intangible chemistry between Doug Gillard and Nate Farley's explosive chords and Kevin March's cymbal washes. Most importantly, Tim Tobias gives Pollard something he's lacked since Alien Lanes: a memorable bass melody that isn't devoured by jangling guitars. Think back to ""Echoes Myron"" or ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" and it's easy to recognize how necessary those basslines are; for exactly one track, Tim Tobias almost single-handedly revives the old magic. ""The Best of Jill Hives"" is a GBV classic by any measure, new or old, and, like the best of Pollard's lyrical work, is made even more meaningful by avoiding his effective, but impenetrable, stream-of-consciousness. ""I know where you get your nerve/ I know how you choose your word,"" he calls out, and like the wounded beauty of ""Game of Pricks"", it doesn't sound like a clever fiction, but like something that happened between real people. It's a single, brilliant, bittersweet concession; contrast that ""old"" sound with the sheen of ""Useless Inventions"". Some may mourn the change, but I contend that in its own way, ""Inventions"" is equally classic. Endlessly catchy, as tight and triumphant as anything Pollard has ever done, this song epitomizes the unfettered, imaginative re-invention of GBV, immersed in the hard rock tropes Pollard has until now only toyed with. Side by side (nearly), it's clear that GBV has subtly crossed over into truly uncharted (though nearby) territory; after playing into the same well-worn channels they've run for years, there's no more fuzz, no more elf-kicking to conceal Pollard's hard-rock dreams; as such, Earthquake Glue never languishes in the awkward lows that seem to plague almost everything else he's done. In the end, it's fitting that the idea of soldiers and warriors recurs throughout the skewed landscape; GBV has been dumbcharging at the music industry for fifteen years, and Pollard and all his various lineups have the battle scars to prove it. In some ways, it's a shame that in order to revitalize the idea of GBV as a band it seems to have meant abandoning the very facets that made GBV a household name around only the hippest households so long ago, and that could be the deepest wound of all. But Pollard's perseverance has shown him to be a hell of a soldier, and if that cut still stings, he's not letting on. In fact, closer to the end of the battle now than the beginning, he and Guided by Voices still might be a long way from filling stadiums, but they're not going down without a fight.","What spectral force, illusion, or trick of light has fooled so many erstwhile critics into apologizing for Robert Pollard over ...

Empty the Bones of You,Chris Clark,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e19d034d5c69bf33da/1:1/w_160/7c44952f.jpg,2003-08-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1484-empty-the-bones-of-you/,Warp,"The cover of Chris Clark's last album, 2001's celebrated Clarence Park, depicted a crystalline winterland, populated by a young boy in a knit hood. In contrast, the cover of this year's Empty the Bones of You is a pale figure thrust into a nightmarish spiral of skulls, spears, and oblivion. I'm wagering that Chris has been to a couple of funerals in the last two years. While, contrary to what my first paragraph might suggest, I did actually listen to this album, the distinction is instructive. Clark's last album, while not a bad album by any means, struck many as standard-fare Warp, the type of guy you hear on a comp and then attribute to some better known artist. And while the songs were better Aphex/Squarepusher tracks than the ones on either Drukqs and Go Plastic, they were still just Aphex/Squarepusher songs. The sole innovation was Clark's segregation of moods; with a few exceptions, there were happy songs and sad songs, with very little in between. It was classic Warp without the ambiguity, a technically virtuoso performance channeling mediocrity. On the new album, however, Clark gains some unique ground. ""Indigo Optimos"" opens with a minimal Detroit techno beat, then gets trounced by some jarring cuts. Rather than tediously layering one audio track on another and then peeling them off slowly at the end, he'll simultaneously put on three or four tracks for a bar, then get rid of them all at once, only to sample the same passage later in the song. The result is haunting, and leagues more accomplished than anything on his debut. On ""Early Mass,"" a music box gets stuck on a groove, grows increasingly metallic, and then gradually fades away until only a shell of the initial sound remains-- the erosive gives way to the evocative. The sound is literally haunted. Later, the apparition circumnavigates the original music box sample and, until ""Tyre"" comes along and drops the instrument into the street, the sound perfectly balances infantile calm and sophisticated mourning. Most songs seem on the brink of collapsing completely. Each struggles to get its melody out, but is threatened by static, loops, and that form of antagonistic buzzing that can only be described as Basic Channel. ""Holiday as Brutality"" features a jazzy synth absorbed by distortion until the song starts over again on a lighter frequency. The melody here is weathered, but intact. The phenomenal ""Gravel (Obliterated)"" seems to rest on a dilapidated suspension bridge-- eventually the ropes fray, the planks fall, and the entire song just sort of drops into a static that continues into ""Gob Coitus"", which restructures the white noise and melody into a more subterranean atmosphere. The album's second half flounders a bit with well-executed, but not particularly memorable pieces (""Farewell Track"", ""Betty""). What must have been intended as the centerpiece, the six-minute ""Wolf"", is a surprisingly traditional ""epic hip-hop"" instrumental (think DJ Shadow) and not nearly as impressive as the next shorter track, ""Slow Spines"", a potpourri of harp, grated cheese, robot handclaps, and whistling. While Chris Clark has found his voice on this album and will, in all likelihood, become a household name on par with the Warp flagships, he hasn't yet recorded his masterpiece. Still, there's an ambition in this stuff that was absent in Clarence Park-- one that will surely make this Best Promising Sophomore Album sometime in the near future.","The cover of Chris Clark's last album, 2001's celebrated Clarence Park, depicted a crystalline winterland, populated by a ...

Microminiature Love,Michael Yonkers,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf613d1975652139b1b/1:1/w_160/f1b4636f.jpg,2003-08-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8863-microminiature-love/,SireSire,"Recorded in Minneapolis 35 years ago and shelved by Sire Records shortly thereafter, Microminiature Love had been a ridiculously obscure find-- assuming anyone was looking for it at all-- until its vinyl reissue last year on Destijl. Now the album is experiencing its biggest push ever, thanks to Seattle powerhouse Sub Pop who've just given it its first-ever CD pressing. Michael Yonkers' backstory is, frankly, intense: When he committed Microminiature Love's seven tracks to tape in the fall of 1968, he was a four-eyed technophile in his late teens who'd just graduated from surf-rock to the more sinister sounds of the Stones, et al. Only two years later, his career and livelihood would suffer a devastating blow: While working at an electronics warehouse in 1971, he was crushed by 2,000 pounds of computer components, severely injuring his back. Subsequently, the dye used in the invasive x-ray procedures led to a degenerative condition of the inner lining of his spinal cord. He managed to self-release four other Jandek-styled folk records on his own eponymous imprint in the 70s, but soon after shifted much of his attention to dance therapy as a means of easing his pain. His condition reached an apex in the mid-90s, forcing him out of the live circuit entirely, but due to the attention brought his way by the reissuing of his music, and with the help of a homemade back brace and stand for his guitar, he's recently played some live dates with Wolf Eyes, Six Organs of Admittance, and Low. It makes sense that he's shared bills with these black-as-night DIY noisemakers, washed-out acid-folkies, and blissed-out dream-poppers. A consummate techie, Yonkers built and modified all of his equipment: he created two effects pedals, made one guitar out of two, constructed synths from childrens' toys, and chopped his Fender Telecaster down to a small rectangular plank to facilitate his psychedelic experiments. (He still uses the scaled-down Tele, which these days is held together by duct tape.) Microminiature Love put Yonkers' homemade equipment to good use: the album is characterized by its droning open-tunings, choppy distortion, twangy folk ministrations, outer-world speaker pans, and bevy of crazed fretwork. But there's a point at which this record shifts from wacky historical curiosity to full-on psych-rock excellence: the clanging fireworks that launch the final vibrato of ""Boy in the Sandbox"" from gloomy minor to stratospheric noise triumph. The song spins anti-war slogans into a narrative about an everyday kid who passes time with toy soldiers until outgrowing his ""sandbox days,"" when he discovers girls, love, an actual war, and finally, a ""tomb of sand."" The song's narrative leaves an open ending as the song breaks into the extended, atonal epiphany. Elsewhere, ""Scat Jam"" is a deconstructed space-out that recalls Comets on Fire, featuring strangely out-of-left-field drum breaks, entropic wooden percussion, Yonkers' gleeful shouts, and Wayne Rogers' guitar-blast tectonics. The more staid, midtempo garage of ""Kill the Enemy"" (another grapple with the suffocation of Vietnam) is buttressed by the shimmering, soft white-noise of sandy-beach radio waves; targeting religious self-righteousness in the face of military action, it fades along a plateau of pulses after Yonkers lets out a final blistering fuck-off! scream (despite his youth in these recordings, he sounds something like a throatier Roky Erickson howling discord through an acid-fried Roy Orbison). Though some of Microminiature Love's six bonus tracks drag, and not all of it is as moving as the more powerful moments I've pointed out, there are more than enough quavering wah-wah nuggets to make it a heady audio experience-- especially for fans of The Troggs, The Zombies, more blistery Animals, Red Crayola, Thirteenth Floor Elevators, and that Twisted Village stargazing vibe. For those of us who do most of our shopping in thrift stores, it's these forgotten bits of a visionary history that make our continual searching worthwhile.","Recorded in Minneapolis 35 years ago and shelved by Sire Records shortly thereafter, Microminiature Love had been a ridiculously obscure ...

Beautiful Blood,Daniel Menche,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43aea9e61561daa80d8/1:1/w_160/4f183732.jpg,2003-08-21 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5549-beautiful-blood/,Alien8,"There's a feeling you get when you put in a CD you know nothing about by an artist you haven't heard of and the display reads: On my discman that means two tracks that total 65 minutes. In the instant when I see that display and crunch those numbers, certain questions inevitably come to mind: How is this person going to keep me interested for 30-minutes at a stretch? What are they going to be doing with all that space? How many times in my life am I going to hear the final five minutes of those 30-minute pieces? Well, on Beautiful Blood, Daniel Menche (who has released a lot of albums I haven't heard) does a wonderful job keeping me engaged over pair of his half-hour tracks. Menche's music is built around drones that stand tall and stretch deep and wide-- drones like that need a lot of time to develop. Shrinking these things down to pop song lengths (or even 10-minute slabs) would be like trying to condense a season of The Sopranos down to a two-hour feature film. Menche is working the long form. As you might guess from the album title and cover that borrows its sinister ""red forest at night"" motif from Gas' Zauberberg, Menche's drones tend toward darkness. The first track is a messy braid of artificially held piano chords, sampled strings, bass pedals, and whirring noise machines, and his patient sense of timing as he introduces new textures ensures continued engagement. Though it seems quite static on one level, the first track actually changes almost constantly, so that any one 10-second segment is noticeably different from the ones that surround it. It builds an impressive head of steam, becoming noisier and harsher until it eventually leads to a single banged piano chord-- the same place the track began. The second track shuffles the deck a bit, using some of the same elements (with the interesting addition of the endlessly stretched human vocals favored by Popol Vuh on In Den Garten Pharaos) while adopting a more minimal vibe focusing on held tones. The build happens even slower and the tone is less foreboding and more reflective. It still works, but if I were to get bored of one of these tracks eventually it would definitely be the second one. It requires a level of concentration and involvement that I rarely have. But this afternoon in the park I was able to give Beautiful Blood my full attention as I laid on the grass. It was an hour well spent.","There's a feeling you get when you put in a CD you know nothing about by an artist you ...

The first, ""Never Alone"", is a put-on-- a 30-second slow jam that points directly to a Boyz II Men poster that may lie hidden behind an old pile of Ranger Rick magazines in Rob's closet, while the second (which follows the sublime ""Beyond Him"", a sample of the type of stuff the rest of the record will contain) is simply a thick slice of cold uncool: its title (""Jedi Outcast"") speaks volumes, and lyrical tidbits like ""Jedi will crush the Sith"" might be a bit much to swallow, but it's important to note that this bit of sci-fi fandom is offered in the form of a heavy metal dirge-- double-time bridge included. Obviously, if Rob gave a rat's ass about looking cool for all the kiddies, he'd shelve such excursions and offer more of the low-key acoustic four-track chicanery that fills the rest of this disc. But then, why stop there? Why not cut that song about being a fucking robot (""Kill All the Humans"") or that dreamy, reverb-happy track about the helicopter (""Helicopter"")? What next-- drop the song with the Foo Fighter drumbeat about hating your job (""Overtime"")? Introduce the cutting room floor to ""Catching the Trap"", a stop-and-go track that slaps together frantic strumming and leisurely picking? The way I see it, liking Rob Crow means taking the good with the bad-- if you're going to groove along to the typewritten pop of ""Some Things"" and the somber meditations of ""Finger"" and especially the contagious beat of ""A Subtle Kiss"", you'll have to accept that Rob's an unabashed Star Wars fan and that he wants to share his 80s boy-band homage with you. Crow's ideas come fast and furious, and it's better to give them voice and let them hit the air than squelch them for fear of them sucking. Yeah, it's a mess, but it's a glorious, expansive one. Folks that want a more concise and less willfully idiosyncratic Rob Crow can listen to Pinback; the rest of us willing to dig for diamonds will do just fine getting dirty with this.","Two of the first three songs in this mess are certain to test the mettle of anyone unwilling to cut ...

Never Too Late But Always Too Early,Peter BrötzmannWilliam ParkerHamid Drake,by: Alexander Lloyd Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b9c0084474cd0c0326/1:1/w_160/78152867.gif,2003-08-21 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/966-never-too-late-but-always-too-early/,Eremite,"Of all the exemplary rituals Europe has senselessly invented, one is too often forgotten: the great predilection for ruining upstanding elements of American culture. For many, the great icon of this quasi-imperialist dominion over the United States' vast cultural reserves is Peter Brötzmann. Ah, yes: we see lil' Peter in Remscheid, Germany, wicker hat over his brow, a little red wagon precociously tugging at his hand and his heart. The radio switches on: Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon. Brötzmann meets jazz. As theories have it, after a few seconds, either the radio lost all reception at the most clangorous volume imaginable or Brötzmann suffered a severe injury to his nervous system. No one can say. However, in hindsight, it is irrevocably clear that when Brötzmann thought he was still partaking in classic jazz, he was now actually listening to ten fifty-foot chainsaws attached to flaming rotor blades in the middle of a railroad destruction derby. And thus was born European free jazz. Through the 60s and 70s, Brötzmann and a legion of similarly minded outcasts, clad in the skin ripped from Ayler's cadaver, rode into ever-expanding rings of demonic noise. Now a paterfamilias for the free jazz vanguard, the sixty-year-old portrayed on this concert album recorded in Montreal on April 10th, 2001 is even more iconoclastic, griseous, and steel-lunged. The trio (three-fourths of the Die Like a Dog Quartet) dedicated the album to Peter Kowald, who passed away a few months after this concert. Coincidence? This is a pernicious, pummeling disarray, like all of Brötzmann's albums, and he still makes time for some significant innovations. For a woodwind who began his era of infamy with a music that had no precedents, this particular lineup cavalierly aligns Brötzmann with a rich American tradition of frenetic and dense hard bop (courtesy of Parker and Drake), although that doesn't nearly classify this style of playing-- concrete bop, perhaps, or black-hole-singularity bop. The instruments are still gloriously combusting all over this show, but there's a more melancholy lyricism affixed to them. This is the first Brötzmann album-- hell, first European improv album-- that got stuck in my head hours after it had ended. From the first ten seconds of the first four-part opus, ""Never Run But Go"", it's evident that this ain't your father's avant-garde. Brötzmann's shriek of a wraith of a blow bifurcates his clarinet LIKE THE SERPENT'S TONGUE IN EDEN. Parker starts walking up and down, occasionally allowing some tones to break asunder and reinvigorate the clarinetist. Drake is playing the most fervent fills ever conceived, with rolls occurring about every ten seconds. The 45-minute piece is probably one of the most accessible avant-garde jazz moments of the last few years. This is some mad, foaming audacity, but it does have a rhythm (one not recommended for small children or pregnant women). On ""The Heart and the Bones"", an initially catastrophic lunacy suddenly goes from Parker sawing his bass in half with the bow into a meditative and elegiac line that sounds like a vacation in Polynesia, except instead of birds in the trees, there are amped-up coffee machines. It's perversely soothing, although I still can't decide if Parker's riff is closer to Reich's Music for 18 Musicians or the Crash Bandicoot soundtrack. Either way, the respite is greatly appreciated. (And I use ""respite"" cautiously here; Brötzmann is still playing at frequencies that make dogs shatter.) The second disc, while nearly as essential, is a more traditional Brötzmann: less fills, less funk, and more carnage. The titular piece starts with some light brushing and leads into a more ""intimate"" version of his great band works of the 70s. The final track, ""Halfhearted Beast"", is unlike anything I've ever heard in free jazz, a blues bounce that seems to intentionally regiment Brötzmann's sax, and I still don't know whether to take it seriously or not. Brötzmann's style is one of those wondrous achievements that we hope employs digital effects, if only so we can sleep soundly at night knowing no one has that much organic power. He typically pulverizes the horn, blowing straight through it and consciousness. Thus, any two-disc set of his work is a little like going to the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot twice in two hours.

Undead in NYC,Gossip,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf7d5e6ef959693233de/1:1/w_160/8d4a2690.gif,2003-08-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3532-undead-in-nyc/,Dim Mak,"The Gossip's Undead in NYC is the documentation of ten trashy roots-punk tracks that the Olympia-via-Arkansas trio churned out at a sweaty Knitting Factory gig in July of last year. Originally released by the band as a cassette-only edition of 50 titled Non-Dead In NYC, the 27-minute set is a boomy swath of analog noise that compliments the band's sloppy-ass, faux-naive approach to the blues. The band races through material from each of their recent full-lengths, but the most immediately noteworthy track is the one they didn't write: a perfunctory cover of The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"". Over the years, the song has been covered (to varying degrees of shittiness) by Hüsker Dü, Uncle Tupelo, The Meat Puppets, Elf Power, GG Allin, Sonic Youth, Swans, The Birthday Party, and Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, so it's impossible to know for sure exactly which version The Gossip are botching here. The trio is joined here by GSL punks The Chromatics for one blathering five-minute jam, replete with what sounds like some Good Charlotte instrument-smashing to round out the punk-as-fire festivities. It lacks nuance, though, and charisma-- a re-tooling of Bessie Smith or The Ramones would have made more sense contextually. But before this half-ass finale gets underway, there's some valuable stuff to learn. Initiating the set with a muddy strum, some tuning and banter, a splice, and finally a grindingly ho-hum ""Got All This Waiting"" from their 2001 debut That's Not What I Heard, Undead in NYC doesn't really get going until the second track, ""Non, Non, Non"" (originally released on this year's Movement as ""No, No, No""). My big bitch about The Gossip's studio outings has always been the guitar's incongruent cleanliness and Ditto's too-upfront pop-diva vocals, so it's nice to hear the band indulging my aesthetic pipe dream: ""Non, Non, Non"" is an evened-out miasma of Southern-styled Tower Recordings boom. As a bonus, the shrieking crowd forms ad hoc high-end percussion to the otherwise dense super-bass sound. Damn nice: this is how they should've sounded always. ""Don't (Make Waves)"" is similarly, gloriously buried in a pile of dirt: when Ditto's voice falls farther back in the mix, she stretches and ducks more powerfully around the fractured feedback, hummingbird drumsticks, and other concrete obstacles. Ditto remains the band's singularly unique talent, and listening to her notes bounce off the Knitting Factory's walls is a treat. In fact, all the material from Movement shines, sounding more complex and intriguing than ever. On the other hand, the stuff from 2001's Arkansas Heat EP slides by like a sigh, lacking detail and succumbing to boring garage-rock tropes (even if the band would rather be pigeonholed as ""punk""). Also worthwhile as a downtown field archive, Undead in NYC captures the crowd's gleeful response to Beth Ditto's every word. Though she doesn't actually say anything very interesting, her snotty delivery and joyous attitude are fun enough. Formally, a peculiar but totally interesting aspect of Undead is the gaggle of sloppily edited between-song breaks, cutting Ditto off mid-sentence or syllable and creating some strange juxtapositions, and the beginning of a new from-beyond-the-grave William Gaddis novel: ""So I'm looking for somebody named--""
""--This songs is for all the f--""

""...proud of your fucking selves."" These odd splices and cuts continue throughout, creating a bizarre Jackson Mac Low vibe: now if only they'd start chopping the songs in half and attacking obvious compositional structures. Despite its boring cover choice and the less-than exciting Arkansas Heat material, Undead in NYC offers a few energetic, beautifully contained environmental recordings. As a whole, I'm not sure it has much use for anyone besides hardcore fans, oddball technophiles, or the folks who attended this particular performance, but The Gossip should use it as a blueprint, hire Neil Hagerty or Henry Flynt, and record in the future with a similarly integrated, basement hiss aesthetic.","The Gossip's Undead in NYC is the documentation of ten trashy roots-punk tracks\n\ that the Olympia-via-Arkansas trio churned ...

Deliverance,You Am I,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaefc0084474cd0c12a6/1:1/w_160/1e7dbeaa.jpg,2003-08-20 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8857-deliverance/,spinART,"You Am I are beloved in their native Australia, and, without being too glib about it, it seems fair to posit that they actually sound exactly like that kind of band: polished, palatable, and boasting the quasi-confident swagger that comes from nabbing three number- one records in your homeland but enjoying relative anonymity almost everywhere else-- especially the market-saturated States. Because despite some fairly rousing recommendations from members of Sonic Youth (Lee Renaldo helped produce their 1993 debut, Sound As Ever, which, curiously, was recorded in Canon Falls, Minnesota) and smiley kudos from the kids in Soundgarden and the Strokes, You Am I have suffered a Robbie Williams-style, collective ""Eh?"" from insular American listeners since the band's inception over a decade ago. It's weird, because on Deliverance, their fifth full-length, You Am I seem so blatantly influenced by elements of classic, early 70s Americana-rock and moody, southeastern alt-country that it's hard to imagine their songs being more instantly applicable to any other landscape. You Am I's questionable band name is fairly funny in the proper context (it was plucked from the well-wet mouth of a rambling fan who was caught spouting broad philosophical treatises at a YAI show), but that's not especially helpful to anyone without a press kit or band biography. Instead, You Am I bank on the songwriting proficiency of frontman Tim Rogers, who consistently crafts catchy rock songs with big, singalong choruses and easily air-guitarable riffs. For the most part, You Am I are a noodle-heavy outfit willing to take the occasional detour toward catchy pop hooks or porch-country bellows. Deliverance evidences all of the band's sonic tendencies, from acoustic ballads to modern rock singles to wild electric romps, brought to fruition-- the record is a varied, occasionally scattered bit of tight-pants guitar rock in the grand tradition of albums by the Black Crowes, or, in the band's better moments, the Allman Brothers. You Am I don't break much new ground here, but Deliverance is still a solid showcase for Rogers' innate songwriting knack, and a carefully crafted, well-realized rock record. ""One Trick Tony"" sees Rogers' high, straining vocals and ample wah-wah swinging back and forth, boisterous and bluesy; ""The Wrong Side Now"" is a gentle acoustic lament, subdued and sweet (check the acoustic breakdowns and shimmery chimes!) ""Nifty 'Lil Number Like You"" is all country twang, dynamic vocal teasing, and foot-tapping prances. Mostly, You Am I just seem oddly well-suited for a Cameron Crowe soundtrack (seriously, think Jason Lee and Almost Famous' Stillwater) or for filling an amphitheater on a late and lazy summer afternoon. The world might not be in desperate need of more proficiently played, bluesy rock and roll, but, you know, here it is.","You Am I are beloved in their native Australia, and, without being too glib about it, it seems fair to ...

Man With a Movie Camera,The Cinematic Orchestra,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cf13d1975652139045/1:1/w_160/0904352c.jpg,2003-08-20 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1468-man-with-a-movie-camera/,Ninja TuneNinja Tune,"Recommending soundtracks is tricky, because I almost feel like I'm not giving the music its fair shake unless I hear it behind the film at the same time. Certainly there are some great scores out there: Nina Rota's work for Fellini, Bernard Herrmann's amazing music for Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick's survey of modern classical music for his own pictures are a few of my favorites. However, generally I think soundtracks are written as supporting roles rather than feature attractions, and taken on their own, that doesn't always equate to a gripping performance for listeners. Jason Swinscoe, leader of the UK post-fusion, part-time IDM outfit Cinematic Orchestra, certainly knows how to enhance a mood (witness his moonlighting as a DJ and remixer), but on this set of vignettes-- all recorded in 1999-- he usually settles for pleasant nothings. Unlike last year's surprisingly lively Every Day, wherein Swinscoe passed up noir-jazz tastefulness for edgy expressionist, post-Ayler extroversions, Man With a Movie Camera catches his project in a much more conservative mode. Swinscoe's soundtrack for director Dziga Vertov's 1929 silent documentary of the same name plays it smooth for the most part, using muted James Brown funk beats and the occasional dash of electronic sheen as the spice in an otherwise minimal, contemplative brew. Not having seen the film (also recently released on DVD with this accompanying soundtrack), I can't really say how well his pieces complemented scenes of the young Russian workers only 12 years into an unprecedented way of life. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he was able to make acid-jazz work, though you have to wonder how old Vertov would have felt. As with many soundtracks, I often get the sense here that things are kept at an even, not-terribly-intrusive keel in order to support whatever might be happening onscreen-- and as a result, they don't necessarily work very well as stand-alone listening experiences. Sure, I'm free to let the theater of the mind have its way with this music, but as sparse, ""evocative"" music goes, these guys have little on, say, Stereolab (or a Martin Denny record for that matter). When the Orchestra plays it ""cool,"" as on the reprise of their cover of the Art Ensemble of Chicago's ""Theme de Yoyo"", they come perilously close to playing background music that might even go unnoticed by the guys in the band. Drummer Luke Flowers and reedist Tom Chant do an admirable job of keeping things afloat on the slow, cocktail funk simmer, as electric piano and Phil France's bass make sure everything stays in its right place-- yet, without a climax, or any obvious direction, the tune meanders. Likewise, on pieces like ""Postlude"", where Flowers' expert 2-step beat and the spooky pluck of strings give straight cop-show melodrama a hip edge, the blunt club of repetition and lack of dynamic arc suck the life out of it. Swinscoe again injects subtle electronics, and even vinyl scratching into the mix for color, but I'd argue those elements are actually too subtle and that in general, the album could have benefited from a punchier production. As such, the titles that work best are the ones forgoing upbeat energetics entirely for atmospherics. ""Russian Record"" uses marimbas and a rainy-day string arrangement, perhaps as perfect accompaniment to the dour, never-changing routine of the average Russian worker. The simple, but effectively wry chorus of violins on ""Reel Life"" does wonders for its clumpy, mid-tempo funk shuffle-- Cinematic Orchestra play ""sophisticated"" well. Since these pieces were recorded in several years ago, anyone curious about the further development of Swinscoe and company will have to wait. It's clear that their adventures in support of the big screen have gotten more engaging over the years, though melodically and texturally, Man With a Movie Camera is pretty consistent with the rest of the band's catalog. Still, I would recommend anyone start with Every Day and work backwards as far as hitting their best stuff first.

Observing Systems,Tied & Tickled Trio,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85f13d197565213962c/1:1/w_160/1d02f0e2.jpg,2003-08-20 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8234-observing-systems/,Morr,"There aren't too many albums out there that can simultaneously evoke the chandeliered, satin-curtained ballrooms of 1940s Hollywood and the sparking mechanization of an automobile factory, but Weilheim, Germany's Tied & Tickled Trio have managed to make one. On Observing Systems, Duke Ellington travels back to the future, electric Miles discovers the glitch, and Gil Evans collides head-on with Lee Perry. Don't let the goofy bandname throw you, by the way-- this is heady music by accomplished musicians (most of which are either members or associates of The Notwist). Also, they're not really a trio, typically arranging their music for twice that many musicians. Tied & Tickled Trio is officially a side project for all involved, but it honestly holds up against recent offerings from The Notwist and Lali Puna quite well, lending a keen focus to the jazz leanings explored by the former band on 1998's Shrink. This is actually the Trio's fourth full-length of slippery electronic jazz, and they've gotten successively better as time has passed, this time choosing to augment organic performances with dub and mechanical flourishes. The album opens with a deep, dark blend of horns and sax, tinged with just a hint of device-generated incandescence. It's remarkably similar in mood to some of Duke Ellington's humid extended compositions, though it's fair to say that these northern Europeans don't have quite as much swing as your average Ellington band. ""The Long Tomorrow"" is well-placed at the start of the record, as it's probably the band's most stunning moment to date. From that dark horn intro, simple drum rhythms carry intricate horn counterpoint forward to a dramatic climax, when the drums add a double-time pulse and the horn builds to a frenzied, dissonant wail. Ultimately, the band breaks into solos, gradually playing more freely and out of the pocket while an ominous bass rhythm creeps in from the back. It's got Mingus written all over it-- a great tribute not only to the man's music, but also to his fiery personality. The most notable instrumental standout is Johannes Enders, who lets rip with his tenor on ""Bungalow"", playing the sax for its full range and breathing in a way that emphasizes the acoustic properties of the instrument's interior-- you can feel the air moving through the brass tube. The record is filled with dense, vibrant horn textures throughout, and it's a treat to hear how these textures blend with harsh programmed snares and hi-hats, as well as the deep dub echo that swallows some cuts. There are moments when the band allows the mix of live and programmed percussion take the spotlight, such as the comparatively sparse ""Like Armstrong & Laika"", a tribute to the first man on the moon and the first dog in space (though it could as easily be read as an homage to a jazz legend and a contemporary trip-hop group), or the locked beat of ""Motorik"", which features a buried, but rather frenzied solo from Enders, processed to sound almost like a violin. Closer ""Henry and the Ghosts"" slips between flute-led horn arrangements and a haunted, creaking piano interlude where brief classical figures cry out from an abyss of echo. Despite its ambitious blurring of genres, Observing Systems feels utterly natural, which is probably due in part to the fact that the band is really a no-pressure situation for its members. The only reason this band exists is because its members are too creatively restless to sit still between albums by their other bands. How fortunate that we should benefit from that restlessness.","There aren't too many albums out there that can simultaneously evoke the chandeliered, satin-curtained ballrooms of 1940s Hollywood and ...

Too Crazy Cowboys,Thick Pigeon,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8619d034d5c69bf3a23/1:1/w_160/26f96eee.gif,2003-08-20 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8236-too-crazy-cowboys/,FactoryFactory,"Lord, thank you for shielding my miscarried children from the 1980s cultural bleedback sullying so much of this new millenium. The new book ""Spectres of Inheritance"" (by Chrisott McAcademic; Gerd University Press; $22) points out with zesty dread that the eighties were a bad prequel for now, a phantom menace in tapered britches: we are re-fraught with eighties fads, toys, celebrities, design, and fashion. We're also cylically dolloping attention on things that never left, the profiles of which seemed to zenith under Reagan and Elderbush: empires, evil, AIDS, Africa, cocaine, and turning outer space into either a minefield or an Ultimate Laser Tag. And of course, Ferris Bueller's Decade Off haunts music in ways wonderful (turn on the Lite Brites again, please, Interpol) and ways heinous (that payola-punk band the Colecos covering Glenn Frey). Orwell deserves to win another golden Prescie from the Hindsight/Foresight Institute: whether or not calling his war-peace surveillance-conformity epic 1984 was his idea, he even nailed the year during which so many subtly totalitarian seeds got sown. He didnt predict pop's culpability, though, in helping us ignore global crises. Surely CNN will soon announce which sweet primetime slot will be held by Huey Lewis and The Evening News. Surely the Department of Homeland Security will soon announce that it is training an elite unit of Ghostbusters. Anyway, dont buy this Thick Pigeon reissue unless you love post-Warhol sub-glam absurdist-meets-infantile eighties-underground New York-ness, or if you're not a feigned-erection-via-Jello-Pudding-Pops-splint (remember Cosby? you named your goldfish Theo? AWESOME) completist of a] New Order (two members play here) b] Sonic Youth (that's a young Kim Gordon's former bandmate singing, and Thurston Moore guests on ""Pope"") c] atrocious-Tony-Wilson hair-era Factory (this was Fact85 and Factus16, with a seven-inch and compilation track added), d] filmscore genius (the music here is by the man who soul-blowingly soundtracked the snowy car approach that begins Fargo). More a project than a band, Thick Pigeon was Stanton Miranda (Durutti Column guest vocalist, Jonathan Demme actress, and blasphemer of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" on the awful Virgin anti-tribute A Means To An End-- her version sounds like Belly on herbal ritalin) and Carter Burwell (composer for almost every Coen Brothers film, as well as Psycho 3, to which Miranda also contributed). Their music is minimalist but spacious, and though the ingredients for dance tracks are in the house, the songs are wallflowers teeming with art-faggy whimdulgence. After the first three tracks, Thick Pigeon loses the listener's hope. I know theyre not suposed to be fettered to logic, but even as free-range confections, Miranda's lyrics make as much sense as a dumbwaiter on a pontoon. Burwell clearly cares more about atmosphere than rhythm: his moody keys suggest a sci-fi Satie, but the handclappy beats are rote-- were Ciccone Youth spoofing this album? With the exception of the Ladytron-like jam ""Fred + Andy"", on which Miranda softens her warble-burp-chant, the original Too Crazy Cowboys sounds fronted by a prematurely aged Punky Brewster (though ""Jeff + Bart"" would work without an album around it, as an oddity, as it mixes Miranda's unsinging and unlyrics captivatingly, with tingly anthemic synths and quaintly outdated robot voices). The three bonus tracks are the re-release's keepers: clubbier, they take David Byrne's limp white funk and Factory-ize it (echoes, drum machines) to rock any contemporary warehouse after-binge. Miranda could have benefited from studying Byrne, a fellow art-worlder with unconventional pipes. Only at its end is this eighties revisitation not flukily miserable or befuddlingly lurchy. To quote eighties icon Lloyd Bentsen (the first line of Donnie Darko, you'll remember, is about voting for Dukakis) : ""I knew Yaz. Yaz was a friend of mine.

Youth and Young Manhood,Kings of Leon,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1eabf31b7dc7155c46/1:1/w_160/cd26355b.jpg,2003-08-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4558-youth-and-young-manhood/,RCA,"The Kings of Leon have some sort of mythical backstory that I'm contractually obligated to relate: they're all brothers (except for the one that's a cousin), raised by a Pentecostal preacher who traveled the South feeding them roots-rock and the Lord's word in equal measure. It's the sort of tale that many in the music press lap up because it plays into rock's need for a linear history, and because it has roots in the history of rock, blues, country and many of America's established musical legends. So next to Jack White's anti-technology screeds, Kings of Leon have the rock press' most beloved non-image image. They so come across like a fictionalized version of What Rock Is Supposed To Be circa 1973 that they could pass for Stillwater. Kings of Leon can't be faulted for their reviews, nor should they be judged by their appearance. Hell, rock needs more characters and personalities. It needs more people who aren't afraid to look foolish or to reach for greatness and potentially fail. The willingness to take chances and to do something truly different has been slowly bled out of rock by safe careerism. Most bands get one shot in the studio every two years to maintain or grow their fanbase, and too often seem reluctant to confound expectations. It's frustrating, then, that Kings of Leon's debut, Youth and Young Manhood, seems to be about removing any possibility that the band could put a wrong foot forward. Their bar band approach sounds as if they've taken a book of rock history and, dutifully following along, bookmarked some of the most unremarkable passages. Their music is often referred to as Southern Rock, although it doesn't rock at all-- it lacks force, velocity, and power. It also has little in common with a lot of what of the best Southern Rock had; it doesn't display the craftsmanship and technical proficiency of the Allman Brothers, the anthemism and storytelling of Lynyrd Skynyrd, nor the eccentricity of Little Feet. More accurately, Kings of Leon sound as if they're aiming more to ape the blues-inflected Rolling Stones, The Faces, or early Bob Seger. Unfortunately, without the dexterity or ferocity of any of them, they end up closer to the likes of Foghat, Black Oak Arkansas, or The Doobie Brothers. It's all very disappointing, because blues-rock can still be powerful when its purveyors demonstrate charisma, quirk, muscle, and a penchant for hooks. Youth and Young Manhood's opener, ""Red Morning Light"", with its gritty, minimalist stomp, could pass for the White Stripes, but elsewhere, Kings of Leon stagger from CBGB junkie blues (""Trani"") to Led Zeppelin-lite (""Joe's Head"") to a muddy, sluggish take on AC/DC (""Spiral Staircase""). ""Happy Alone"" is the album's strongest track and-- thanks to the clipped guitar and singer Calen Followill's garbled, slow drawl and indecipherable lyrics-- the one that most justifies all of the ""Southern Strokes"" tags. Followill's voice has an element of gravely confidence, yet it off-puttingly carries the ugly sense of entitlement of young machismo. Like Fountains of Wayne or The Stereophonics, Kings of Leon aim to meet your every expectation to a T, and nothing more, making music that's seemingly bulletproof simply because it's built on the foundation of the way things were done in the good ol' days. Which is much of this band's problem: Kings of Leon attempt to substitute their supposed possession of ""honesty,"" ""purity,"" ""realism,"" ""history"" and ""authenticity"" for ideas, hooks and songs. And like so many bands touted as bearing these intangible, inaudible sensations, they simply aim for pantomime, careful not to reach for anything other than the tried-and-true simply because that's perceived as the ""right"" way to do things.","The Kings of Leon have some sort of mythical backstory that I'm contractually obligated to relate: they're all ...

Farewell Sorrow,Alasdair Roberts,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28613d19756521388c0/1:1/w_160/62d405c6.jpg,2003-08-19 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6800-farewell-sorrow/,Drag City,"These days, it seems like everybody wants to be folk. Some people have argued that punk rock, with its easily reproduced songs and grassroots support system, represents a modern equivalent of the genre; others insist that hip-hop, with its origins in the street parties of the South Bronx, is the rightful heir to the loaded term. Even Soul Asylum and the Red Hot Chili Peppers have claimed to be folk acts at one point or another. Yes, the seemingly egalitarian political connotations of the word ""folk"" are a pretty hot property these days. But the same certainly can't be said about the word's aesthetic connotations. As progressive as music that proclaims itself to be ""folk"" gets, the music that the rest of us call folk has remained pretty much the same-- acoustic, unadorned, melodic, and often making use of antiquated words and phrasings. Even these purely musical qualities seem ideologically charged, though-- folk music has been, and still is, often construed as anti-modern, which in no small part explains why the genre has rarely ever been permeated by electronic instruments. Still, not everyone is afraid to take folk music in new directions. Will Oldham added more elaborate instrumentation, his own unique songwriting sensibility, and the word ""fuck"" to the folk music paradigm-- with classic results. Appendix Out frontman Alasdair Roberts shares Oldham's sensibilities in that regard, not so much dressing up the hundred-year-old corpses of folk songs as channeling their spirits into something very much his own. On this, his second solo album, Roberts allows himself more room to stray from the traditional folk songs he so obviously adores, making a record that's ultimately less constrained and more convincing. Farewell Sorrow opens with its remarkably strong title track, which sounds like one of the finest classic folk songs never written. Haunting and beautiful, ""Farewell Sorrow"" is impossible to place in time, as Roberts manages to deliver archaically worded sentences without sounding like a budget Yoda impersonator. ""Join Our Lusty Chorus"" fares less well, borrowing bits of a traditional hunting song without really integrating them into the greater framework of the song. Indeed, the most interesting thing about Farewell Sorrow is the fact that the entirely Roberts-penned songs often better convey an air of somber, musty beauty than those that are built upon traditional folk melodies. As with Roberts' debut full-length, The Crook of My Arm, Farewell Sorrow's greatest weakness lies in its dynamic and textural homogeneity. Though an endlessly pleasant album, it's rarely transcendent. ""When a Man's in Love He Feels No Cold"" is a charming song, but as shallow as its title suggests. The more expanded bass, drums, and organ arrangements Roberts utilizes here keeps the album from dragging too much, but also draws attention away from Roberts' voice, which can be remarkably powerful when placed right at the front of the mix. Weaknesses aside, Farewell Sorrow succeeds both in conveying Roberts' love of traditional folk music and demonstrating his ability to tinker with and expand upon it. Increasingly, Roberts seems to be coming into his own sound-- one reverent towards the past without gratuitously shunning the present. In other words, he's found his voice, and all that remains now is for him to figure out what it is he wants to say.","These days, it seems like everybody wants to be folk.

The sloppy-but-beautiful result of all this mashing is sorta impossible to define with any degree of authority or clarity (really, watch VH1 for five minutes and see) but rock's intangible, ass-kicking essence still rambles on in the eternally damned souls and pointed index/pinky fingers of contemporary outfits like NYC's blaring, 70s-inspired Darediablo. Even if you've been shamelessly devil-horning to How the West Was Won all summer, Feeding Frenzy, Darediablo's oozing Southern Records debut, is a thick enough slab of instrumental rock to earn some vigorous head-thrashing and volume-topping of its own. Darediablo have distilled rock and roll to an alarmingly pure state (never fretting over peripheral shit like lyrics, vocalists, or a fourth member) and they deliver their throbbing, gimmick-free sprawl without a single weepy apology or power-ballad-for-the-ladies. Hammond and Rhodes organs, guitars, and drums kick out the jams trio-style (keyboards at the front), and their muscular output sounds about as authentically rockist as possible in 2003-- although, like any group of honest rockers, Darediablo owe a few nods to their blues/jazz/funk brethren (especially groove-heavy outfits like The Meters). And much like label-and-city mates Ui, Darediablo have nailed down blunt New York jabbing. Feeding Frenzy's thrusts are unrelenting: Jake Garcia's thick, angular riffing may evoke lots of fond (if repressed) Deep Purple memories, and all three have chops-y tendencies that could be considered sorta prog. But Feeding Frenzy is more of a beer-in-plastic-cups party than a studied meditation, and the music is jumpy enough to get anyone dancing-- even if all your moves are preemptively restricted to fist-pumping and head-bobbing. ""The Hornet"" shows off the band's raw, throwback power: mercilessly self-assured, the track opens with some heavy, distorted guitar play, until organs pulse in and stake claim of the melody. Chad Royce's drums push hard, Garcia solos nimbly, and keyboardist Matt Holford dutifully keeps shit in check; everywhere, kids in black t-shirts and ill-fitting jeans bite their lips and grimace happily. The big, crunchy guitar opening (and subsequent recession) happens a lot on Feeding Frenzy-- ""Dark Horse"" sees Garcia's pounds fall away to some comparably benign organ jamming, while ""Slide Rule"" comfortably intertwines guitar and keyboard. Darediablo can be a little trickier than they seem on paper, though: the instrumentation here is clever enough to satiate those who regularly storm through Guitar magazine, and their approach is varied enough (from heavy to relaxed to curiously harmonious) to keep casual listeners poised and curious. They've got kind of a ridiculous name, a semi-hilarious album title, and a photograph of a silvery fish popsicle on the red-checked cover of their record, but Darediablo still nobly transcend every other meatheaded hard rock cliché by consistently pushing out thick, unadorned, intellectual rock and roll-- complete with compelling grooves, unremitting force, and lots of opportunities for bookshelf-shaking blasts.","In some ways, the generational disfiguration of rock and roll was inevitable-- since its murky birth, rock\n\ has borrowed ...

Goodbye Swingtime,The Matthew Herbert Big Band,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0bcea9e61561daa7c82/1:1/w_160/2695d219.gif,2003-08-19 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3833-goodbye-swingtime/,Accidental,"Matthew Herbert's last proper full-length, 2001's exceptional Bodily Functions, mixed squishy vocal house music with acoustic jazz instrumentals. The occasionally jarring transitions between the house tracks and the jazz bits bothered some people, but I thought they worked despite the vastly different production. In addition to just sounding good mashed up against each other, I enjoyed listening for threads that ran through the tracks in an attempt to understand Herbert's base-level preoccupations regardless of genre. Herbert is a house producer but also a fine pianist, having studied since he was a kid, and he has a serious affection for elegance. Oh yeah, and Bodily Functions was built in part from sampled sounds of the human body. Mustn't forget that, with Herbert, there is always a concept. That his records still sound great even if you don't know what's happening or why (the Radio Boy release The Mechanics of Deconstruction might be the exception here) is a testament to his vast talent. Your average music listener isn't going to log on to magicandaccident.com to read a 3,000-word screed on Herbert's methods. They want something that sounds good when they're cleaning the apartment. And Herbert is careful to deliver on that level-- at least with music he expects you to pay money for. The overlapping layers of concept and commentary are an additional benefit, something to pry apart and analyze after the music has stopped. Herbert's latest project ups the stakes in every imaginable way. Goodbye Swingtime (which has yet to find U.S. distribution) finds him broadening the aspects of his music that already set him apart from the electronic music community. Where on Bodily Functions he wrote music for a small jazz combo, the Matthew Herbert Big Band is a unit with four trumpets, four trombones, and four saxes, along with Herbert's piano, bass and drums. The Big Band developed out of an invitation to assemble a group for performance at the Montreaux Jazz Festival. Ultimately, Herbert wrote the tunes, worked with arranger Pete Wraight to realize the harmonic structure, recorded the band live, and then mixed and manipulated the results on computer. Of course, the ""big band in a digital mood"" idea isn't enough, and Herbert has his theoretical preoccupations. He indicates in his notes that ""The conceptual back bone of the album is political literature."" Books by Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore and others are rustled, tapped and otherwise made to sound without benefit of the actual words within. Sounds of a printing press, Herbert's own inkjet printer, and a rally against the war with Iraq make appearances elsewhere. Herbert also invited listeners to send him recordings of their local telephone books being dropped to the floor, in an attempt to build a collective howl from the noise made by literally millions of individual names (I wonder if I'm in there somewhere?). A heavily layered concept, even by Herbert's standards. Truthfully, though I've read some of his suggested reading and have an interest in Herbert's politics, I haven't been able to integrate his concept into my reception of the music on this record. And it doesn't really matter. What I hear on Goodbye Swingtime is a well-written, creatively arranged big band album that becomes breathtaking when the acoustic elements break down and reassemble themselves, which doesn't happen quite enough for my liking. Far more interesting than the subliminal far-left rhetoric are the subtle and surprising manipulations Herbert manages to integrate into the sound of the band. With Herbert it's all of a piece; every gesture is politicized but the music itself never preaches. The listener decides which content to absorb, and I'm most impressed by how the song ""Fiction"" slowly transforms \xBE of the way through from a punchy, brassy pop arrangement worthy Doc Severinson into funk a la The Dirty Dozen Brass Band and then finally into a short section of completely cut and programmed beats that retain the same rhythmic thrust. The way all this goes down in approximately 90 seconds is astounding. Picking up the ball, ""The Three W's"" uses a looped section of the aforementioned printing press' metallic grind as a perfect percussion motif, like this is what Gil Evans would be doing now if he'd held on a little longer. The drama in ""The Battle"", which feels like several separate but related tunes warring for thematic dominance, is heightened further when the meticulously voiced harmonies dissolve from something arranged to something played by a lone man with his hand on a mouse. Not all the interesting breaks involve digital manipulations. ""Chromoshop"" pauses halfway through for Herbert to insert a few bars of solo piano dripping with the lyricism of Vince Guaraldi. But for all of Herbert's production and editing brilliance, sometimes the vocal end of things on Goodbye Swingtime is a bit less successful. ""The Three W's"" and the slinky ""The Simple Mind"" both feature his frequent collaborator Dani Siciliano in her usual torch song mode, which I can't get enough of. I'm less enamored with Super_Collider's Jamie Lidell, though, with his heavily mannered, faux-Al Jarreau yelps. Both ""Everything's Changed"" and ""The Many and the Few"" are less than they could be because of his presence. A few dull moments aside, Goodbye Swingtime is a highly original and engaging record that's also one of the last things one would expect for a producer who made his name with house music. It has a way of confounding expectations even after multiple listens because of its unusual production approach. The way Herbert combines the sound of a big band with his studied deconstruction, the invisible mental border we draw between a record as document of a live event and a record as a product of studio technology is unusually and unpredictably porous. Herbert always has a way of making confusion an attribute.",,7.6,
Smashy Trashy,S.A. Smash,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63db1335d7bf1698da8/1:1/w_160/f199793b.jpg,2003-08-19 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7711-smashy-trashy/,Definitive Jux,"Def Jux shares more than just a near-homophonic similarity with Def Jam. If Cannibal Ox is a new-age EPMD and El-P is a one-man Public Enemy, S.A. Smash is the black Beastie Boys. Def Jux has been pushing S.A. Smash as the underground's answer to the city walkers, the music we (and we alone!) could get jiggy to, waving our Aesop Rock wristbands in the air with reckless abandon. But there's a problem with this theory: the underground's purpose was to be the other side of the balance beam, the hip-hop with a message. S.A. Smash's message seems tailor-made for New York radio, except for the fact that they are fucking terrible at rapping. Similar gruff voice, bouncy cadence and narrow subject matter bind them together as the Smash Brothers. These two emcees are the sound of 106 & Park ambition. It's no surprise that they're from the same crew as Copywrite, as the lyrics are all about how dope they are, how much they love vagina and how much they could kick your ass. It's boring, derivative and lacking of the main factor that makes commercial rap enjoyable: the rainbow of emotions and situations touched on. These guys are all good times and no backlash. The reason this album doesn't work is because they don't have the emotional severity and nonchalant allure of commercial artists, they don't have the intelligence and song structure of underground artists, and they can't write a chorus to save their lives. Choruses range from painful (""You're a Robot, where's my people?/ You're a systematic format and you're lethal!"") to bizarre (off-key crooning in the tradition of Cappadonna and ODB: ""Man, I know this seems weird to you/ We're the only niggaz in the room!"") to song-destroying (horribly failed faux-Parliament ""ooh's"" and ""ahh's""). All the songs could just be condensed into one single sentient song. The main thing you'll notice off the bat is that S.A. Smash have a penchant for getting monstrously overshadowed. Cage, the dope rapper that no one will admit to liking, rapes the opener ""Smash TV"" (""Turn on the TV, smash the S.A., with an I-N-S-A-N-E/ heaters smoke until his lungs empty""), Vast Aire beats the home team at their own game on ""Slide On 'Em"" (""Computer nerds, life is bigger than iMac/ That's why, backstage, with your girl, I mack!"") and Aesop ""The Drawing Point"" Rock brings out a brilliant road sex narrative on ""Love to Fuck"" (""She's grabbing at the car keys, I pull over to the shoulder, stop sudden/ A second later, we're both riding shotgun""). This is the sound of a show being stolen. ""Ain't shit worse than a waste of talent,"" the chorus on ""Illy"" exclaims. Ironic that this song boasts the only El-P beat. But maybe I'm being too hard. Camu Tao is a rapper with a massive amount of potential, as evidenced on his solo 12-inch banger ""Move the Crowd"". I mean, seriously, it's not like they sampled Led Zeppelin or something. OH WAIT, THEY FUCKING DID. ""Last Night"" steals ""The Ocean"" in a manner slightly more heinous than Puffy ripping off ""Kashmir"". See, Puffy doesn't have any common sense. Stealing is expected from someone like him. But as an artist that has clearly been staring at the industry for ages, Camu should know better than to jack a rock standard. Regardless, the beats are a bright spot on the toilet in this instance. Tao has a level of production talent where he can shoot out moderately chopped club bangers like Ecstasy pills to inebriated girls. Their composition is still somewhat sloppy, forgettable and uninspired, but they still get the job done. Overall, the best drops are by El-Producto (the mindblowing, multi-layered guitar assault ""Illy""), Blockhead (the smooth funk on ""Love to Fuck"") and Przm (the slow-motion saloon bass funk of ""I Know What You're Thinking""). An interesting point can be made that Camu uses the same sample on ""Spot Tonight"" that Kanye West blessed Freeway with on ""Hear the Song"" earlier this year. Comparing the two beats shows the huge valley of talent within and the fact that the commercial world has already made this album with a higher level of quality and polish. Hopefully they can make like the Beastie Boys, leave Russ-El and join a label where they can expand into the environment that they so obviously feel they belong.","Def Jux shares more than just a near-homophonic similarity with Def Jam.

Songs for Dustmites,Steve Burns,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4229d034d5c69bf2fba/1:1/w_160/8ba62003.jpg,2003-08-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1065-songs-for-dustmites/,PIAS,"Let's go ahead and get this part over with: Yes, this is the debut album by the guy who, along with the titular blue dog, used to host Blue's Clues, the insanely popular children's show on Nickelodeon. And yes, Steve Drozd of The Flaming Lips backs him on this album, with the bulk of production duties held down by Lips producer Dave Fridmann. The indie A-list backing hasn't made much of a dent in the guy's street cred, though-- it seems everyone's been gunning for the guy to fall flat on his face. Nobody wants to acknowledge this album. I can't blame them-- the guy's impossible to watch. I had some trouble, myself, swallowing that this character with doofus hair (guy should pay Moe Howard's estate royalties for that shit) had gained affiliation with one of the best bands going today, in indie rock or otherwise. But doubts about Burns' talents are dashed instantly, with the phenomenal opener ""Mighty Little Man"", a colossal wallop of orchestral guitar-pop that's leagues beyond most of Fridmann's recent production work. It's perhaps the best example of Burns' lyrical style, relaying the tale of a television addict who transforms (under mysterious circumstances) into a superhero. Recent Lips material aside, space-rocking epics of this sort aren't the most original thing going these days, but you'd have to be a hardened cynic to deny the track's ebullience-- over a year since I first heard it, I'm still surprised at its grandeur. Burns falters slightly on ""Maintain"", which, for all its catchiness, dives into dreadful Jack Johnson-ish plucked acoustic territory at its outset. The song's mindless hippie jauntiness is thankfully ameliorated by Drozd's trademark drumming and a sparkling chorus, but even these assets can't save the unfortunate lyrics, which go so far as to steal a line from obvious influence They Might Be Giants: ""And I'm standing on the corner/ Gonna jump out of my skin/ Gonna float above the buildings/ See which one you're in."" Fortunately, Burns regains his composure with the symphonic, sweeping cello and trumpet of the tentatively optimistic ""Stick Around"" and the loose, airy guitar workout of ""Super Strings"". Elsewhere, an upbeat, likeable slice of indie-pop called ""What I Do on Saturday"" ambles along in definitie Lips-like fashion, while "">1"" stands out as a plaintive downtempo number. Featuring standard-issue Fridmann backing effects-- subtly whirring synthesizers and gauzy strings-- the song works a surprisingly swampy guitar solo into the song's intimate environs. Many will surely grouse that Songs for Dustmites succeeds only thanks to Burns' star collaborators. But while Drozd and Fridmann's influence is undeniable from the start (they're clearly responsible for a good deal of the album's sparkle), Burns' lyrical insight and gift for writing and arranging endlessly listenable pop songs consistently manages to steal the show. Given the Flaming Lips' penchant for animal costumes and general childlike weirdness, it's no shock that these guys chose to record with Burns-- the surprise here is that, rather than the update of Fred Rogers' ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" many indie snobs might have been expecting, Songs for Dustmites manages to remain true to Burns' legacy as a nice-guy kid's show host despite having made an unabashedly adult record that deals with familiar themes of love and loss.","Let's go ahead and get this part over with: Yes, this is the debut album by the guy who ...

Cyborgs Revisited,Simply Saucer,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63513d1975652139123/1:1/w_160/e7e6a2a9.jpg,2003-08-18 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7704-cyborgs-revisited/,Sonic UnyonMole SoundSonic UnyonMole Sound,"Let's say you're skeptical when you flip through the liner notes and read quote after quote, all from reputable rock publications, praising Cyborgs Revisited as nothing less than ""the greatest Canadian rock album ever."" And sure, they overreacted, but you understand, because this is everything a cult album should be: the only trace of a lost band that was so exciting, but so obscure it's a wonder there's anything to remember them by at all. This album first came out in 1989, a full decade after Simply Saucer had broken up. Flipping through the small booklet, you can read countless anecdotes of rock band purgatory: gigs that almost sparked riots, others that did nothing at all, rough demos, stolen gear, and of course, continuous line-up changes. In spite of it all, the band kept experimenting-- like the time they cranked up the feedback in their Hamilton, Ontario rehearsal space, and went outside to see if they could hear it (they could), locking themselves out in the process. The local firemen who had to let the band back inside described it as ""the loudest sound heard in these parts since World War II."" Here's a band that could splice the DNA of Syd Barrett and Soft Machine with Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground, that could bridge post-psychedelic mind-altering electronics with a buzzed proto-punk urgency: the ultimate garage band, rehearsing constantly and trying everything and doing it all at top fucking volume. And right after they finally got around to issuing their debut release, a well-received seven-inch, in 1978, the band split and became history. The saga, however, was just getting underway. Longtime Saucer fan Bruce ""Mole"" Mowat uncovered enough of the band's material in the late 1980s to assemble an actual posthumous full-length album. A one-single cult band that could have been consigned to Nuggets III: Original Artyfacts from the Northern Territories and Beyond instead captured their own spotlight. Mowat culled nine songs from a forgotten studio session and a free afternoon show at a shopping center, and crazily, they're all so fantastic that you can properly call them a legacy. The studio cuts come from a 1974 session recorded by Bob Lanois in his and brother Daniel's basement studio (the live set was recorded a year later). We'll never know what the band's original epic setpieces sounded like, but apparently, by this point, frontman and main songwriter Edgar Breau was cutting the material down into more concise songs (if jarring and very eccentric ones)-- it's all the fury of the band's live sprawl crammed into the most condensed possible space. These sessions are explosive, with Breau playing the space-rock guitar hero while Ping Romany works out on Moog synth and some other analog electronics. The three live tracks, meanwhile, see the band stretching out: drums and bass gallop through on ""Illegal Bodies"", setting up a noisy busy-circuit solo from Romany that sets the stage for Breau's most precise, shrieking guitar attack. Even at a free show on a Saturday afternoon you can tell these guys were an absolutely crushing entity in the flesh. But jams and noise-rock don't always ossify well onto vinyl. Which brings us back to the songs: a whole set of garage rock classics that are both ecstatic and bluntly riff-bound. Breau wrote lyrics that were strikingly direct-- from ""Instant Pleasure""'s demand for carnal reward, to ""Nazi Apocalypse""'s crass punk humor, to ""Bullet Proof Nothing"", which just keeps demanding, ""Treat me like dirt."" And though Breau's voice, while strong and clear, has no actual remarkable qualities (I'm saying he'd never stand out in a garage-rocker line-up), it's the perfect counterbalance to the music, grounding Simply Saucer's instrumental flights and Romany's ""third ear"" electronics. Sonic Unyon's reissue collects the 1989 album, and also tacks on a half hour of rehearsal and live tapes. The later material (dating from '77 and '78) has the band arcing away from psychedelia and closer to proto-punk; Ping Romany has quit and Steve Parks has joined the band on second guitar. The bonus tracks sound rough but they include some gems, like the bluesy ""Low Profile"" demo or the album's only ballad, the affecting ""Yes I Do"". Sonic Unyon also included the first CD issue of the band's single, ""I Can Change My Mind"", along with its flipside, ""She's a Dog"". The single deservedly made waves in its day, landing them a touring slot with Pere Ubu, but the band sounds diminished on it: the songs are jagged, semi-chaotic shards of sneer-punk with lyrics that snarl but that never hinge off the groin like the band's earlier work. It shouldn't have ended there-- the band were slated to record an official full-length before they disbanded-- though it is hard to imagine how this band could have improved on Cyborgs Revisited; ""I Can Change My Mind"" and ""She's a Dog"", in particular, seem like formal grade school portraits after all the candid craziness that came before them. With all their ideas and influences it's unbelievable that we could catch them at a point of such balance, but that might have been because they didn't freeze up to perfect it. Simply Saucer made their defining statement without even knowing it. How can you beat that?","Let's say you're skeptical when you flip through the liner notes and read quote after quote, all from ...

Lowlights,Lowlights,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb9eb335119a49ecf29/1:1/w_160/8f2ecfb6.jpg,2003-08-18 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4946-lowlights/,Darla,"As I understand it, in space, no one can hear you scream. Slide guitars, on the other hand, sound great. Earthbound as they usually are, country and blues lend themselves remarkably well to the atmosphere, set amongst the reverb and stars; witness Pink Floyd's ""A Pillow of Winds"" or Beechwood Sparks' ""Sweet Julie Ann"". These are just two of the bands that quickly spring to mind when Lowlights' self-titled debut drifts out of the speakers like a transmission from a drifting satellite. Another name-- one that flashes even brighter-- is Spiritualized, those masters of interstellar heartache who've lately given over to indigestible orchestral bloat, leaving behind a perfect vacancy for California's Lowlights to fill with their synthesis of Gram Parsons folk and regal, ionospheric psych. The album opens with a sweep of pure phase space-rock called ""In the Distance"", a slow descent overflowing with huge harmonies jerked earthward by dense clusters of distorted guitar. ""Wave Goodbye"" puts the brushes to the drumkit and the steel to the strings, but never comes down completely, floating a few miles up as bandleader Dameon Lee admonishes, ""Don't turn around/ Just wave goodbye."" Generally, Lee sticks to narrating human emotion in his songs-- there's none of the drug damage of Spiritualized or bedsit philosophy of The Verve to distract from the heartache and desperation in his songs. Lowlights definitely have a sound/bandname synergy going on-- the gentle repetition of ""Brown Eyes"", with its lonely, echoing trumpet and weeping pedal steel is a great way to come down from a physically active day of mowing the lawn and assembling Swedish furniture. The band squeezes a lot of variation from a fairly limited sound palette, constantly shifting tempos and making little changes, like subtly subbing in a harpsichord for an acoustic guitar, while keeping the overarching sound full of cavernous echo and open space. Lee's voice has gravel enough to sound weighty even when cast in the album's zero-gravity atmosphere, and he's well complemented by the silk-smooth backing harmonies of Angela Brown. On the whisper-quiet ""Wheelbarrow"", which features guest vocalist Brisa Roche backed only by a wandering Rhodes and a quivering Farfisa, Lowlights conjure some of Yo La Tengo's sparsest Georgia Hubley ballads, yet things close at a majestic crawl with ""How Does It Feel?"", a languid drift through the solar system topped by pining steel and lush, homespun folk harmonies. Thick electric guitar cuts in on the refrain, a false start that teases at a closing firestorm, but shuts down instead, bowing to the pastoral glow of the verses. It's an impressive debut, and Lowlights seem to have all the pieces in place to churn out at least a few more in the near future. They have a mastery of the texture that a record like this requires to pass as more than just an ambling experiment, and they've proven they have the ability to write more than one kind of song, which is something a lot of their peers simply can't do. They may not be doing anything terribly new, but their execution is beautiful, and sometimes that's more than enough.","As I understand it, in space, no one can hear you scream.

O,Damien Rice,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20fb1335d7bf16983de/1:1/w_160/fbec8674.jpg,2003-08-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6898-o/,Vector,"The endurance of the bare-boned singer/songwriter archetype is befuddling, considering that in 2003, the genre seems almost terminally idle. But sweet-faced, shaggy-haired poet-players have always seeped up an inordinate amount of hyperbolic, next-big-thing gushing from critics and fans; it's usually the kind of unchecked flattery that stems from recognizing what massive balls it takes to be unabashedly earnest, accepting that it's actually kinda brave to indulge the precious sentimentality that goes hand-in-hand with maudlin emoting. Come the fuck on. This shit doesn't earn anyone a free pass. It's still possible to-- without repressing romanticism entirely-- take your broken heart and make its artistic likeness more interesting and dynamic than the overwrought, acoustic sap perpetuated every day in coffeehouses and Hallmark stores across America. Because on its own, even a really convincing Sincere Face is never enough to make anyone's gut flip. Yes, the soft, tortured acoustic ballad is a valid and occasionally transcendental form of creative expression (see Dylan, Buckley, Nick Drake et. al.) but over the last fifty years, it's also become mind-numbingly formulaic. Irish troubadour Damien Rice's steadfast refusal to revise and redeploy means that his ten-track debut, for all its quiet confessions, is ultimately far more stagnant and sonically predictable than anybody wants to admit: O's musical path is so painfully well-tread that the record seems at times almost self-mocking, and Rice himself singer/songwrites like he's playing that shit on TV. Bravely calling on all renowned acoustic slingers from Joan Baez to Elliott Smith, Rice synthesizes the defining characteristics of folk-rock's quirky forefathers without coughing up a single noteworthy contribution of his own-- not only is Rice failing to augment the contemporary folk-rock paradigm, he's just doing an awkward imitation. The big, inescapable problem with O is that, aside from being derivative, Rice's songwriting is also unbearably repetitive-- he stubbornly relies upon time-tested singer/songwriter formulas (quiet acoustic strumming and sober, wavering vocals), and repeats them almost exactly the same way, every time. Even his noble attempts at creating distinction, including an expectedly swelling string section whose rises and falls are, yes, cartoonishly familiar, seem knee-jerk and contrived. The whisper/scream trick, the dim acoustic intro, the painfully restrained percussion, the lilting chorus-- a hidden, a cappella version of ""Silent Night""? Really? And yet Rice makes it difficult to pull the bullshit card, because O is so unrelentingly affable. It's thoughtfully rendered, and if only superficially, all the proper parts are in place. His breathy vocals-- curiously pitched and slightly broguish-- are compelling, and when mixed with the airy coos of the impeccable Lisa Hannigan, these songs can surpass their mundane, by-the-book casings, at least momentarily; likewise, Rice is a capable guitar player, although his Dave Matthews-via-David Gray pluck-and-strum can be awfully exhausting. Still, irksome familiarity will always eclipse niceness, and this record's got no surprises. Single ""Volcano"" is O's highlight. A rich, meandering cello line slides in between jerky acoustic strums, light drums and curt cymbal tapping pushing up against Rice's sufficiently vague lyrics (""What I am to you/ Is not real/ What I am to you/ Is not what you mean to me""). There's a spectral creepiness implied in the uncomfortable sparseness of the track, which sorta falls apart in the crooned bridge, but comes back in the haunting, many-tracked vocal breakdown with Hannigan, and its sinister suggestion is welcome-- when ""The Blower's Daughter"" interrupts, with its dramatic ""I can't take my eyes off of you!"" hollers, the memory of ""Volcano""'s baleful, Nastasia-y threat becomes infinitely more appealing. Things get worse: even the leather bound adult-alternative handbook advises against publicly airing sentiments like ""Cannonball""'s ""Love/ Taught me to cry."" O has a thick canvas cover and impressive art-book packaging; its liner notes are crammed with drawings, paintings, and curiously superimposed poems. It seems instantly unfair that the record housed inside doesn't get the same kind of boundary-breaking treatment, but relies instead on all the whiny, sad-eyed clichés of a genre in desperate need of a fresh approach.","The endurance of the bare-boned singer/songwriter archetype is befuddling, considering that in 2003, the\n\ genre seems almost terminally ...

This Book is About Words,Ahmad Szabo,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62dea9e61561daa52f4/1:1/w_160/9e7949b0.gif,2003-08-18 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7697-this-book-is-about-words/,East Dev,"A friend of mine gave me a copy of this album some months ago; I listened to it once, and discarded it as unreviewable. I had read the backstory from the liner notes: an Atlanta bike messenger with an acute sensitivity to air takes a roadtrip one fall, brings along some guitars and a borrowed laptop. \x93You have roots and wings,\x94 he says, \x93but now is the time for roots.\x94 Just another guy using Scott Herrex92s name to issue a private experiment on Eastern Developments, I thought. Twenty long minutes of abstract snooze-out. Accessible, but inscrutable. Unreviewable. From the dry perch of reviewery, the non-verbal cuts a slim profile. Sometimes it just vanishes. This is no great loss for literature, but music is a different story: often the more wordy (like most rap) or wordish (like Prefuse 73) an album is, the easier it is to describe and evoke in words. Music writers regularly dodge this problem by talking about people, or scenes, instead of the music itself, but that's not a solution. Oddly, This Book is About Words is the least verbal music I've heard in a long time. Only after a month-long train trip through India, a week-long silence at my computer, and a day-long blackout did I start to wander away from the thought of talking about this music. I saw something there, and I want to tell you about it. Each track unfolds in a meandering line, like a bike messenger who's forgotten his destination but not the urgency of the message; or, as the liner notes suggest, an \x93unmanned vehicle.\x94 The feel of acoustic guitar sets up a lot of the figures, kind of like Villa Lobos meets Nick Drake as seen through a variety of prisms and filters. The textures that result are alternately fuzzy and airy, open and clean-- undemanding, and sincere. Music that's almost richer when you forget to listen. \x93Para Eva\x94 abandons a driving tick-track early on for some aimless noodling, but the harmonic logic starts to drop back in, slowly, as the track becomes its own autopilot, pushing into a simple vamp that hides a little system of twangs and skips. The basis of a real beat-- fashioned from sampled taps and cracks-- even drops for a few seconds in \x93Tobacco Path\x94 before the guitar licks pan out in a ticcish fit of self-interruption. \x93Goodbye Beautifuls\x94 stutter-sprays its opening sallies, then voids itself in diphthongs and cracklings, but \x93Cadaques\x94 proves a real song, with the kind of aimless inertia that few but Evan Mast have mastered. The only track whose unplugged version might stand on its own is \x9385 Into Night\x94; muffled plucks and greasy squeaks confirm that this music is digital after all: music for fingers. Perusing its own flat domain, barrelling down a road leading to more road, This Book is About Words is scattering in a fit of skips and purrs. And panning out.","A friend of mine gave me a copy of this album some months ago; I listened to it once, and ...

Tiger Thrush,Ami Yoshida,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf4b1335d7bf169976b/1:1/w_160/a56b5514.gif,2003-08-18 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8862-tiger-thrush/,Improvised Music from Japan,"""The human voice is the original instrument."" If that seems like a cliché, it's probably due to an overabundance of PC sloganeering that-- while perhaps well-intentioned in its goal of inclusiveness-- has turned a shred of wisdom into an excuse to ignore. Which is to say, if our voices are instruments, it might stand to reason we're all musicians and that any one person's definition of music is as valid as the next. Of course, this is where subjectivism, inclusiveness and improvisation get tangled up into an intimidating knot that no one person is able to unravel or pass on to their friend for a second opinion. Every sound is art, or maybe nothing is art and we're all tooting our own horns. And for Cage's sake, please don't bring up the post-modern. So let's just say for the moment that every sound we make is ""music."" Other than de-emphasizing the preciousness of artistic expression (by way of supply and demand), it should also make each of us an expert on composition and improvisation, even if we can only comment on our own. The intimate relationship artists have with their material-- and its connection to the social, political and natural world-- would in turn become a mundane experience, worthy of not much more consideration than our choice of socks in the morning, or the last word in this sentence. Ultimately, ""anyone can do it,"" and despite my suspicion that this has never actually been true, it's still a comforting thought. Japan's Ami Yoshida exposes these conditions on her solo CD Tiger Thrush, and in the process perhaps raises more questions than anyone without a grant and six months sabbatical could hope to tackle. Yet, in a basic sense, she amazes: if we are all allowed in the same artistic space, how is it that her music seems so unprecedented and consistently surprising? Yoshida was born in 1976 and performs improvised music with only her voice. She specializes in a self-described ""howling voice"" wherein her vocalizations often take the form of barely audible shrieks-- sometimes similar to frequent collaborator Sachiko M's supersonic sine-wave tones. Other times, Yoshida produces sounds that don't seem to have been originated from a person at all: distorted ""electronic"" feedback, erratic clicks, metallic scrapes and grating scratches. On Tiger Thrush she often uses loops to further obscure her ""instrument"" to the point that the end result has something in common with the experimental ambience of Farben or Sutekh. I'm hard-pressed to call her music ""vocal"" or ""improvised,"" as the generally very short sound fragments could be linked to any number of scenes, but I have no reservation in recommending this fascinating listen. Since all 99 tracks are untitled, and many are shorter than 30 seconds, it's a little pointless to recommend highlights: Tiger Thrush works best when you have the time to invest some serious ""deep listening"" (headphones are even better). Many of the selections seem like the result of fanatically obsessessive editing, even though I know they're merely short excerpts of Yoshida recorded at her Tokyo home. Track 82 is a loop of her witchy growl; 83 a straight take of what sounds like a baby drowning in her own saliva; the opening 23-second cut sounds like something gone very wrong with your CD drive, as if it was suddenly unable to play the album and began melting the lens instead. I could go through the whole thing like this, but I doubt it would give you a good idea of the experience. Technically speaking, Yoshida (along with fellow improviser Toshimaru Nakamura, who mastered the disc) shares much with the Japanese onkyo performers, in her use of silence and natural sound. Some of the tracks use the ambience of her home (and the various sounds outside her window) as counterpoint to her own emissions. Track 85 features a loop of her voice singing a straight tone, but is colored by what was probably accidental feedback from her microphone; this leads directly to a track where her growl is transformed into a warning siren. In both cases, minimal compositional elements are used to magical effect and though short in duration, should delight anyone who thinks they've got a handle on the capabilities of the human voice. More than that, it is hypnotic music; casting as potent a spell as any ambient recording I can think of. Even though it's difficult to classify this music as straight improvisation, some folks averse to that may very well have the same reaction. Tiger Thrush is hardly the room-clearing storm that some of her peers in Japan's improvised music scene have been known to release (see Otomo Yoshihide's stereo-destroying The Night Before the Death of the Sampling Virus as both a prime suspect, and prelude to all of onkyo), but if you aren't prepared to accept the ""pictorial dictionary"" of all the sounds Yoshida is able to produce, it could be a long, maddening trip. As I see it, this music is not only mesmerizing because of her voice and subtle electronic manipulations, but because it manages to appeal to me on the same level as any other ""traditionally"" beautiful recording. No matter from what angle you approach the record, I figure everyone could use another one of those.","""The human voice is the original instrument.""

Fly Below the Radar,Minibar,by: Stephen Haag,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43169fc7814a47cd809/1:1/w_160/2ca0fce0.jpg,2003-08-17 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5540-fly-below-the-radar/,Foodchain,"Don't let the title of British alt-country quartet Minibar's sophomore disc, Fly Below the Radar fool you: they're not aiming so low that you won't miss them if they fail. They're too sharp to fail. After all, Minibar-- guitarist/singer Simon Petty, bassist Sid Jordan, guitarist Tim Walker and drummer Malcolm Cross-- are quite content doing their own thing, whether anyone takes notice or not, especially since their debut (2001's Road Movies) received no backing from then-label Universal. As Petty recounted in the July/August issue of No Depression, life after Universal ""forced [Minibar] to become a much tighter unit not just musically, but as a band in the broadest sense of the word."" Petty is true to his word, though his band is hardly the type to start any us-against-them fistfights. Like their fellow countryman Peter Bruntnell, Minibar have a knack for cranking out beautiful, simple, dusty alt-country descriptions of their adopted homeland (the Southwestern United States). But they're more Jay Farrar-- he with the voice like a January desert sky-- than say, Calexico. It's worth making a comparison to the slightly-better-known Bruntnell, himself a Farrar disciple and employer of former Son Volters Dave Boquist and Eric Heywood, to boot. Where Bruntnell offsets his quiet moments with willful weirdness (Normal for Bridgewater's ""By the Time My Head Gets to Phoenix"" or ""Tabloid Reporter"" from Ends of the Earth), Minibar stick to the plaintive steel pedal lament. Album opener ""It Is What It Is"" sets the desert-vibe template that runs through all of Fly Below the Radar. With an air of Zen peace (""It is what it is/ There's no need for argument at all"") and the autumnal chill of the guitar and keyboards, the song's pounding bridge comes as a surprise. Minibar may not wander too far from the trail, but they can find a hook in even the simplest song. Which is a good thing, otherwise Fly Below the Radar would trigger a rash of suicides. ""Unstoppable"" finds Petty noting that ""I've been alone for so long/ Sometimes I don't know what to say."" An album full of lyrics like that and you'll find yourself hoping for some Bruntnellian kookiness. Fortunately, the middle of the album is brightened by the funky ""Somebody Down Here Loves You""; delivered with a knowing wink by Petty (the son of a vicar, as is Jordan), this tune of earthly delights is the alt-country equivalent to Matthew Sweet's ""Evangeline"". But then it's back to the lonesome trail, and by now Fly Below the Radar is either thematically cohesive or thematically oppressive. I'm opting for the former, as there's an unmistakable quiet charm informing even the lesser songs. ""Martha"" approximates a dustier Willard Grant Conspiracy, loosed from their chamber (WGC themselves a band that exudes quiet charm). The tune is inspired by Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; in the words of fellow alt-countryman Jeff Tweedy: ""He takes all his words from the books that you don't read anyway."" It was a play Jeff, but we won't nitpick. The title track boasts the album's fist-pumpingest chorus, and proves these guys can rock out when they need to, but they also excel at tunes like the acoustic ""Badlands"", which is haunted by ghostly violins and images of the Joshua ""field of crucifixion trees."" Taken as a whole, Minibar is not tears-in-your-beer music; it's more pull-over-on-a-deserted-stretch-of-Texas-highway-sit-on-the-hood-of-your-car-and-count-the-stars-on-a-cool-clear-evening music. Surely there's a pithier description of their niche, but why settle for one word when 25 will do nicely. Minibar are content to let the experience and idea of the Southwestern U.S. wash over them, not actively seek out the heart of the region...which is also the best way to ""get"" Fly Below the Radar. ""Fragile""-- every bit the road song with its spacey keyboards-- recalls the Zen air of ""It Is What It Is"": ""There nothing we can do anyway/ So just smile and tell yourself it'll be okay,' and coming out of Petty's mouth, it's not so much sad as it is true (and it might just double as the band's mantra given their dealings with major labels). While it's asking a lot to rely on four transplanted Brits to approach alt-country's mid-90s heyday, Fly Below the Radar is the kind of record many alt-country fans have been waiting for since Son Volt's Trace; lord knows Farrar, last seen flying past Saturn with the ""Space Junk"" of Terroir Blues is not the man for the job.","Don't let the title of British alt-country quartet Minibar's sophomore disc, Fly Below the Radar fool you: they ...

Square,Buck 65,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a426c0084474cd0c0420/1:1/w_160/bdce8c16.gif,2003-08-17 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1068-square/,Warner Bros.,"Buck 65's focus shifts from album to album. He started out creating personas on Language Arts, moved onto developing a distinct style (Vertex) and was last heard experimenting with drum 'n' bass rhythms-- and weird song structures-- on Man Overboard. Now the self-proclaimed ""Ratfish"" has shifted to a major label, and into a new, slightly contradictory focus: accessibility through the esoteric. Buck (government name Rich Terfry) is best known for three elements: his terrible voice (best described as chain-smoking 10 year old), his rigid flow and, most importantly, his diverse subject matter. Although nothing on this album is on the level of obscurity as his sub-famous ""Centaur"" narrative, Stinkin' Rich still manages to rip through a myriad of issues. He goes from discussing intergender politics (""Square 2"") to the tribulations of childhood friendship (later on the same cut), to the social ramifications of science (""Square 4""). He even has a narrative about a local girl's degeneration at the hands of incest rumors regarding her family (""Square 3""). The trouble doesn't come with his rhymes either, as Bucky comes relatively fresh throughout the album. When confronting his past, he claims that he'd ""go down by the river to watch the way the devil dances/ I never took his hand, even though I did have several chances."" When describing his gripes with industry asskissers, he explains that they ""can't dance but do dance anyway"" and have ""vampire fangs and see-through hearts."" Lyrically, he tones down the bravado and persona switching, settling instead on distant narratives and detached commentary, slowly showing contempt for traditional hip-hop barriers. Although he lacks vocal dexterity, and may bug out every now and then-- threatening to ""ovulate on your pillowcase""-- Buck 65 still stands tall as one of the best writers in underground rap. His production borrows heavily from early 90s masters like Prince Paul (De La Soul), Digable Planets and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (A Tribe Called Quest) and it definitely shows on Square. From down-tempo tone experiments on ""Square 3"" to the labored piano loops of ""Square 2"" and some elegantly flipped video game sampling, Buck knows that being saddled with such a rough voice, he lives and dies on his production. Separated into four tracks that range from 13 to 17 minutes apiece, Square is a concept album clearly developed with the ideas of consistent play and analysis in mind, but, in actuality, Buck's intentions make the album disjointed: it's a chore to fast forward past a four-minute instrumental breakdown to get to some rapping. In fact, over the 60 minutes of Square, there are only about 13 rap songs, typically three minutes each. This leaves roughly a third of the album to less-than-progressive instrumentals, hit and miss vocal samples and above-average scratching. These techniques are welcome on the album, but come with the added expense of a bloated listening experience. ""Square 4"" is where Rich cuts corners and develops the deadly circle that envelops all the worst elements of the album: a lack of focus, concepts meant to show versatility that end up flawed in execution and overlong), and pointless instrumental breakdowns that wreck the consistency of the movement.

Still, keep in mind that everything that led up to this final Cube-sized serving was a melodic mix of folk rock sensibility, smooth early 90s style production, clever lyrical observations and a relatively enjoyable train ride into the mental station of Halifax's best-known emcee. Although unable to touch his 1999 masterpiece Vertex, Buck shows his plans for progress in his home-brewed rap subgenre.","Buck 65's focus shifts from album to album.

The Black EP,Interpol,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97beb335119a49ec7b0/1:1/w_160/d2d0b911.jpg,2003-08-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4115-the-black-ep/,Labels,"Black cover. Grim title. Not a single new song. What we have on our hands is a perfect posthumous release, with the sole disadvantage that Paul Banks & Co. are still walking this Earth. Owing less to inspiration than to a multi-pronged strategy for breaking the band in every possible market, Interpol's Black EP arrives to European stores and Stateside hard drives today loaded with some dubious booty. I've kept my backlash impulse in check all through the band's ascent, but that urge (to horribly paraphrase) is out of the icebox. Opening the disc is ""Say Hello to the Angels"", arguably one of the weakest numbers on the band's 2002 debut, Turn on the Bright Lights; it's the only one that sounds something like The Strokes, and thus makes for the record's most predictable single. Since the version included here is the same one found on the LP, it makes little sense to discuss it in the context of this EP, although I can't help but note that it does feature the all-time widest gamut of Banks's lyrical skills: going from the genuinely great line, ""This isn't you yet/ What you thought was such a conquest,"" to the lazy, automatic scripture, ""You're hair is so pretty and red/ Baby, baby you're really the best,"" is one of the most painful juxtapositions in quality in the band's entire catalog (though ""Obstacle 1""'s ""Her stories are boring and stuff/ She's always calling my bluff"" still marks the nadir). Next comes the demo version of ""NYC"" already available on the Yes New York compilation. Lacking the album's caviar-rich production and Greg Calbi's always impeccable mastering, the song loses most of its whooshing sweep; in fact, it begins to sound suspiciously like something by Luna circa Penthouse. One could argue that isn't a problem, since Interpol will in all likelihood tone down their insecure, overeager fashion sense and tidily fall into that chic, detached role at some point, but the rest of the EP is pure ballast. The remaining four cuts are culled from the band's August 27, 2002 appearance on The Black Sessions, a popular in-studio concert broadcast on France's Inter radio, aired during Bernard Lenoir's C'est Lenoir program. By now a widely available bootleg (with several additional tracks not included on this EP), their Maison de la Radio Black Session evidences a frequent complaint leveled against these Royal Tenenbaum goths: the sound of their songs in a live setting varies little from how they appear on record. To boot, this was clearly not the band's most ""on"" performance: the Turn on the Bright Lights tracks (""PDA"", ""Leif Erikson"" and ""Obstacle 1"") are sober and flat, and impossibly, ""Specialist""-- an excellent track they've strategically made something of a ""rarity""-- sounds even more exhausted than its dub-like indie jangle. It's difficult to imagine a reason a label would issue this disc, other than to pacify completists, but the rabid fans will no doubt already have the entire Black Session on MP3. You can throw a bone in a variety of ways, but Black chooses the most insulting one, bouncing widely traded material off our begging noses. The best EPs out there feel like genuine spasms of generosity, even if they're overt placeholders while a band cautiously probes new turf or clears house before a big departure; Radiohead's Airbag/How Am I Driving?, the ne plus ultra of the latter, packed seven songs, ten pages of artwork and Noam Chomsky's biggest paycheck. Whether or not Interpol have had much of hand in the decision-making behind Turn on the Bright Lights' satellite releases, it is having an affect on their image. That their debut album was priced under $8 until it began to take off was a windfall in cool and credibility, but as their singles discography continues to grow and the level of substance decreases, fans might not be remiss in wondering if the band had planned all along to recoup by selling the same album twice.","Black cover.

The River Bed,Small Brown Bike,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6345e6ef95969320c9c/1:1/w_160/00c9476e.gif,2003-08-17 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7703-the-river-bed/,Lookout!,"Despite a mid-career slump, Marshall, Michigan's Small Brown Bike emerge on their third full-length with a chunk of dense, melodic post-hardcore. Tackling myriad frozen forms-- a cold, steel van or dark room, cold hearts and complicated breakups-- with the smokey vocals of a Midwestern Jawbreaker, the anomalous four-piece is too heavy and unsentimental to fit the current emo framework, too Cometbus romantic for the majority of today's floor punchers, and way too pop punk for the indie set. Regardless of categorization, The River Bed is a wise warming-up to the band's early, most cathartic form. Less self-consciously clean than Our Own Wars (1999) and rawer than the often hollow Dead Reckoning (2001), a number of The River Bed's tracks are a satisfying blend the band's nascent sound: catchy bass playing, three-part harmonies (one melodic singer, one distant screamer, one burly shouter), and tender teen lyrics package in a blue-collar aesthetic. Despite what the record snobs tell you, emotion doesn't have to turn into a caricature, and punk with hooks isn't necessarily embarrassing. I'm not generally a fan of this sort of music, but Small Brown Bike have a certain je ne sais quoi that keeps me returning to their rust-belt sermon. The album opens with ""Deconstruct/Rebuilt"", a claustrophobic scribble on citywide alienation; like the best Small Brown Bike, its tone remains triumphant despite the dour positioning of lyrics like, ""So I stare outside the window and I wish I was alive,"" which could only be a late-summer battle cry for unshaven urban hermits. ""Safe in Sound"" and ""A Declaration of Sorts"" are both midtempo lovesongs that build to a final shout-a-long, the kind of thing Jawbreaker did well for so long, but emo (and Jets To Brazil) in the 90s just hasn't. In ""Safe in Sound"" Mike Reed shouts staccato, ""I can see it/ A picture of one cold, dark cloud/ A mist around you to choke the painful words out of your crooked mouth."" It's no ""Chesterfield King"", but it's effective in its own way, especially the final group shout of "" I will be there to resuscitate you."" ""What's Missing Is Dead"" is an epic, sprawling chanter about emptiness full of odd percussive shaker rattles and thinly sliced feedback: ""I brought home a fake badge to wear around the house and show my loved ones how much I try/ I've killed what's missing."" Perhaps because the band includes brothers Ben and Mike Reed, family and a sense of place are regular thematic watering holes. Outside of the brief romantic tableaus, this is the band's strongest lyric path. Through eight songs, The River Bed doesn't miss too many beats; unfortunately, the track list goes to ten, and its final two compositions cave-in on their own ambitions. ""The Outline of Your Hand Still Remains On My Hands"" is-- in title at least-- the sappiest Small Brown Bike to date. A twangy, tumbleweed-etched ballad, it describes the unraveling of a relationship in a darkly ponderous Spiderland tone. It's not horrible, but its frozen molasses pace is meandering at best. Things only get less dynamic on a ""A Lesson To Remember"" the plodder that follows in its wake. The album's longest track, ""A Lesson To Remember"" formally links to Dead Reckoning's equally lengthy and dramatic closer, ""I Will Bury You in Me"" (that album's strongest track, and a manic finis). In lieu of kick-ass, roof-top fireworks, ""A Lesson To Remember"" can only pass-off ghostly slide guitar, sharp arpeggios, and cheesy group harmonizing. Thanks to their shaky ponderousness, Small Brown Bike have never topped the lo-fi caterwauling of 1999's Collection, a thirteen-song compilation of 7-inch singles, compilation tracks, and the band's demo tape. Owing to inexpensive recording techniques, the band fell into Guided By Voices' poppy collage aesthetics, applying a cut and splice overload to hardcore dynamics: ""Crossing Guard"" and ""Cold"", for example, were stitched with feedback and a slow motion, insanely sludgy drum beat, plus guitarist Travis Dropp's super dense background bellow. While the band projected this tough-ass sound, a gentle homesick heartbeat thumped in the center. Often so-called progression brings with it a tendency to add strings, electronic bleeps, or the aim for an anomalous genre bending mishmash of outsider influences. With bands like Small Brown Bike who excel at contrasts, pummeling their instruments and finding a path towards melody through splintering volume and sludgy hiss, such arty detours ineluctably sabotage their strengths.","Despite a mid-career slump, Marshall, Michigan's Small Brown Bike emerge on their third full-length with a chunk of dense ...

This Needs to Be Your Style,Donna Summer,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4c13d197565213b066/1:1/w_160/7b76c2f7.gif,2003-08-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2516-this-needs-to-be-your-style/,Irritant,"As a descriptive signifier, the term IDM never made much sense to me. Playing-up the reclusive-genius schtick to such an extent that some of these cats look like Unabombers-in-training, its major artists have catered to one primary fanbase-- reclusive shut-ins and undersexed college kids-- by maximizing the I and M whilst largely ignoring the D (all respect to Ludacris, yo). The brooding dourness of the scene hasn't just disregarded dancing, though, as many of the major players in the game focus on abstraction to the extent that visceral reaction of any sort is out of the question. In shot, this record did not make me dance. His music might not encourage conventional dancing, but Donna Summer (obviously not the diva) doesn't suffer idle head-bobbing lightly. A balding, slightly overweight journalist and WFMU DJ named Jason Forrest, Summer works in a manner encompassing every IDM-trend to come along in the past decade-- drill-n-bass, gabba, tigerbeat6-esque laptop trickery, plunderphonics-- all are fair game for Summer to destroy and recontextualize. Part of a loose collective of sample-fiends, including Giorgio Marauder (AKA END) and Duran Duran Duran, all working under the nom de electronique ""cock-rock disco,"" Summer and crew are proponents of what Forrest refers to in a recent Vice Magazine piece as ""the new computer music."" Musically speaking, these acts have little to do with traditional disco, and while computers surely factor in heavily, things never get too tech-geeky. Performance-wise, however, the banner starts to make sense-- playing out all over Europe to sold-out audiences, they (and Summer in particular) have become renowned as much for their flamboyant, confrontational shows as for their challengingly appealing music. Listening to This Needs to Be Your Style, Summer's second release (following the To All Methods Which Calculate Power EP), is disorienting at first: imagine your favorite DJ scratching and crossfading between your local best-of-the-80s radio station and a Hrvastki record, and you're getting close. Summer assembles tracks almost solely from samples, albeit with a heavy DSP coating. Like John Oswald's Plunderphonics approach (Summer is an admitted Oswald fiend), his tracks blatantly taunt copyright laws, though his sample choices surprisingly avoid the esoteric in favor of more obvious pop-based sources. As a result, and despite the avant-garde construction, a pop feel permeates many of the tracks-- ""What You Truly Need"" is loaded with fragmented call-and-response vocal cuts, horn stabs, and radio-funk palm-muted guitar chugging, while ""We Call It 'The Box'"" flays hip-hop conventions, coasting on 808 hits and what sounds like a sample from Planet Patrol's rollerskating-rink classic ""Play At your Own Risk"". Things get even more pop on ""Heels Over Head"", during which Summer inverts the classic Go-Go's single. Intercut by a sample of the organ-buildup from J. Geils' ""Freeze Frame"", Summer rips ""Head Over Heels"" apart at the seams, leaving the signature melodic hook intact as a basis over which to splatter drill-n-bass heroics. The ""rock"" part of the ""cock-rock disco"" equation does shine through on two of the album's most technically impressive cuts. The album's structural masterwork, ""Prog's Not Dead"" lives up to its title, as 13/8 time signatures fly by at a disarming pace. Unfortunately, the track also succumbs to the traps of the genre at which it slyly winks-- this is surely digital-virtuosity of the highest-order, but like even the best prog-rock, the musical-masturbation tires quickly. Summer fares better on ""Accept the Cheap"", where elaborate polyrythms and video games plinks clash with metal guitar riffing, truly fulfilling the promise of his vision of this ""cock-rock disco."" Full of enough copyright-abusing fellatio to choke Kid 606's pussycat, This Needs to Be Your Style shreds through familiar hooks with such blinding pace that their origin can only be discerned after repeated listens. Like Max Tundra's Mastered By Guy At the Exchange, this is a pop record at heart, loaded with familiar blips of melody and rhythm, but filtered through the perspective of something truly rare: a hyperactive IDM'er who really just wants to RAWK.","As a descriptive signifier, the term IDM never made much sense to me.

Heart,Stars,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a548b1335d7bf1698b6c/1:1/w_160/f3a80d21.jpg,2003-08-14 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7471-heart/,Paper Bag,"When an album starts off with each member of the band announcing ""I am ____, and this is my heart,"" you should probably know straight off what you're getting into. The key word here would be ""heart"" (not coincidentally the name of the album), as in ""wears on his sleeve"" or ""in her mouth"" or ""-shaped candies with cute little phrases on them."" Stars have come to rock the master of your cardiovascular system, and if you're not prepared to accommodate a healthy serving of lyrical earnestness, you should probably just Remove All from your Winamp and go play some street hockey, you manly man you. Fortunately for whoever remains, that leadoff track (""What the Snowman Learned About Love""-- see what I'm saying?) then supernovas into a synthy planetarium soundtrack worthy of M83 before scaling back to a delicate sing-song in the vein of Broken Social Scene's ""Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"". It's a fitting overture to a strong pop album that effortlessly shifts from bombastic chamber to plink-plink twee over eleven songs, blissfully unburdened by the ambition to sound particularly new or different. In fact, I doubt the band would even mind much being referred to as a Canadian Belle & Sebastian, albeit a B&S; with more 80s synth-- which, come to think of it, might just be what the new Trevor Horn-mentored Belles will sound like. But one song form Belle & Sebastian were never real strong with was the boy/girl conversational duet (think ""Don't You Want Me?""), and Stars are happy to fill the void. ""Elevator Love Letter"" puts a jangly frame around urban shyness-- she's a rich girl, he's hot for the rich girl, both have spent too much time under florescent lights. ""Romantic Comedy"" is a domestic disintegration dialogue set to perky acoustic guitar runs and accordion. If the subject matter sounds a bit Hallmark, well, it is, but it's so persistently romantic that it should just about reach the level of excusably cornball for emotion-arbiters, like the video for Air's ""All I Need"" or the final scene from Field of Dreams. Meanwhile, the group coasts on a good amount of orchestral carpets: ""Time Can Never Kill the True Heart"" juxtaposes the quartet with very-very-lite techno programming; ""Look Up"" is plausible Delgados forgery, thanks to smoky Amy Millan vocals. But even when stripped of symphonic accouterments the act doesn't wilt; the polite high range of part-time actor Torquil Campbell works wonders in ""The Woods"" with just a french horn and an answering machine message for company. Only when the group tries to develop some sort of awkward dark edge (the uncomfortably dreary lyrics of ""Death to Death"") or the sound gets nudged off the MOR cliff (greasy-slick ""The Life Effect"") does Heart skip a beat, become clogged, or experience any other negative heart pun of your choice. Chalk it up perhaps to another case of Pitchfork Canuckophilia, but Stars comes as yet another Montreal act to keep the indie pop dream alive in '03. Less all over the map than the Voltron-like Broken Social Scene, and without the fetishist spice that off-kilters the otherwise straight-shooting pop of The Hidden Cameras, Stars could very easily be overlooked, or avoided like a couple prone to PDA. But as of yet we don't have immigration quotas on music from the Great White North, and Heart is a valuable pop record for those of us whose cardiac muscle hasn't stained completely black like that of, I dunno, Chris Ott.","When an album starts off with each member of the band announcing ""I am ____, and this is my heart ...

Leather Wings,Japanther,by: Brad Hurst,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1c9abf31b7dc715668a/1:1/w_160/a7973ee7.gif,2003-08-14 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4336-leather-wings/,Menlo Park,"The death of a scene. I remember the first time I watched it happen. As an overeager adolescent grunge fan and aspiring Seattlite, I was thrilled to find that Nirvana was part of a scene stretching back as far as the Sonics and including then-still-underground bands like Mudhoney and Tad. My appetite for all things punk, and especially Northwestern, was voracious, and I devoured every C/Z comp and Young Fresh Fellows single I could get my hands on. And life was good, until those final months of 1992, when I watched the Seattle bacchanal crumble before my eyes-- for every Fastbacks or U-Men record I unearthed, there was a Candlebox album lying in wait, looking to cash in on the moment and encouraging a dozen new A&R; shitweasels to add an ""edge"" to their AOR Zep knockoffs by moving them to Seattle and dressing them up as fucking lumberjacks. Out with Green River, in with Green Apple Quick Step. And so I find myself eleven years older and probably not much wiser (thanks, college-era chemical recreation!), bemoaning the end of another scene. Since the electroclash, underground hip-hop, and post-post-punk (or is it new-new-wave?) scenes arrived in the early noughties, Brooklyn-- and in particular Williamsburg-- has achieved nonpareil status amongst the hipster cognoscenti, with snooty art galleries, clothing boutiques, and posh eateries moving in by the assload. Gentrification, of course, usually portends a dim future, as the cutting-edge makes way for the full-on middle-American cheese. Now, as Liars make room for The Watchers, Interpol begets The Stills, and Fischerspooner breeds Tobell von Cartier (didn't Larry Tee already try this once with RuPaul?), truly inspiring new Brooklyn bands are a real commodity. Sweaty punk dudes Ian Vanek and Matt Reilly of Japanther make a glorious racket out of vocals, live drums, an Akai MPC, and a fuzzed-beyond-belief bass guitar. Vanek and Reilly may have played their early shows opening for noise-rock stalwarts Lightning Bolt and Pink & Brown, with whom they certainly share an affinity for volume and density, but they also employ hip-hop informed beats and samples, and tend to rely on the tempo and pacing of hardcore punk. Bits of pop melody and structure are carried almost solely by the ever-present fuzz-bass, as Vanek and Reilly bark, scream, and shout unison chorus lines over the lo-fi din. Opening the album with a sampled voice intoning, ""Love is like a battle of the bands... crank up your amps, man,"" the band proceeds to do just that, tearing through the punk-metal assault of the title track. This minute-long barrage anticipates much of the madness that follows: ""South of Northport"" and ""TV Nightmare"" suggest drum-machine-fueled hardcore, but ""Blood of the Panther"" recalls the late-90s heyday of so-called digital hardcore more than Minor Threat. Far from being an Atari Teenage Riot knockoff, though, Japanther never let the beatboxes and samples overpower their organic, in-the-red production. While their use of samples to open nearly all of the tracks lends a decidedly hip-hop flavor, the relatively sedate new-wave moments on Leather Wings are comparatively light on electronics. ""Pleased to Meet You"" owes the new-wave contingent more for its carnivalesque organ line and buoyant bassline than for any 80s-fetishist synth tones. ""16 Stories High"" and ""...Of Dogs"" may employ synthesizers, but so sparingly that they sound like thrift-store organs anyway. If there's a question that Japanther's amalgamation of styles might be accidental, ""Super Loser"" shows the band's influences so seamlessly integrated that it can't be pure happenstance. Pop hooks, is-it-live-or-is-it-Roland drumming, electronic sprinklings, and a repeated, vocodered drop of the word ""noise"" make ""Super Loser"" the record's most forward-thinking track, hinting at what the band might be capable of. There's also a nod to my once-cherished Northwestern scene in the opening sample, the disembodied voice of some moral-majoritarian glibly pronouncing that ""'He's Waiting' is one of the evilest of the Sonics' songs... who's waiting? Why Satan, of course."" Such a stew of influences may sound complicated on paper, but the album is surprisingly straightforward in execution-- even the most subdued tracks are short, fast, and intense. This can be a drawback: For all Japanther's propulsiveness, the most hardcore-leaning tracks are the least memorable. Despite a degree sameness, Leather Wings is the best (only?) noise-rock-new-wave-hardcore-hip-hop you're likely to hear this year. With another album already in the can (the soon-to-be-released Dump the Body in Rikki Lake) and an upcoming split with Brooklyn's Panthers (get it?), Japanther shows that tres chic Brooklyn still has a crusty, spastic underbelly.","The death of a scene.

Radio Blackout,T. Raumschmiere,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a216b1335d7bf16983f5/1:1/w_160/9af6166d.jpg,2003-08-14 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6694-radio-blackout/,Mute,"Bang bang buzz buzz gob gob growl: this is going to be one of those reviews where we just damn the cynical torpedoes and talk about how cool someone is. Someone whose music is all bang-buzz gob-growl happy-go-lucky tech-punk bounce, slathered with burned-chunky motor oil from evil cartoon dumptrucks and yet in very little need of any prettying-up. This particular someone: Marco Haas, recording as T. Raumschmiere. And this particular album: a pretty good one. Raumschmiere's notable skill is this: he rocks out. Not in a mean way, or anything-- there's a friendly, invitingly deranged quality to his jumparound brutalism-- but the guy certainly likes to make four-on-the-floor a snarly, happy, fist-raising experience, and it's said that his live shows are energetic enough for audiences to fear for the safety of his equipment. Here on Radio Blackout, we come across what just might be the crown to his line-so-far of joybanging singles and especially remixes (of Goldfrapp, Komëit, 2raumwohnung): ""Monstertruckdriver"", the track one imagines led the New York Times itself to compare his music to ""a monster truck rolling through a rave."" (And this was even after they resumed double-checking to make sure their stories were, like, true: you can't argue with that.) ""Monstertruckdriver"" is the Raumschmierian tech single in its pure form-- it kicks in with the shuffling glam beat that's infected plenty of folks on his own Shitkatapult label; it brings in steady blurts of the grotty bass speedbump he clearly loves; the lead comes in buzzy, but bounces melodically like he got the idea from Sesame Street. You know those heavy metal devil-chick-on-muscle-car animations? It's like that, only without the bad metal. The thing about Radio Blackout: more than the sterile, precision-molded minimal techno of last year's Anti, and more than the clunkier brute scraping of the previous year's The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle, this is Raumschmiere as the ready-for-prime-time singles artist. It opens fairly dirty and streamlined, but in a preparatory way; ""Monstertruckdriver"" revs up in the second slot. ""Someday"" wanders rather prettily around a slow-creeping beat, taking its tech-tweaking and IDM-type rhythm variations at a casual pace; ""The Game Is Not Over"" sort of reprises ""Monstertruckdriver"" at four, only now with the usually flat-voiced Miss Kittin pouncing and sneering over it in a way that's scarily reminiscent of Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus. (""Highway rock and roll disaster!"") The back and forth that leads through the first half of the album-- dancefloor exciter, subtler moodpiece, and repeat-- is so simple it just does work: I think Raumschmiere's got my attention span matched near-exactly. Not that there's anything wrong with the mood pieces-- the title track, just floating ambience and ghostly radio static, is a great lull, and ""Drown in the Sea While Watching the Stars"" pulls off a nice combination of sultry vibe and metallic scraping. It all just hangs together surprisingly well, full of interesting diversions: ""Rabaukendisco"" pairs a great big rock grind with screaming saxophones; ""Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Strom"" and ""Querstromzerspaner"" offer some terrifically assembled mid-pace techno for a return to the dancefloor-appropriate; ""A Million Brothers (Blah Blah Blah)"" even takes a curiously okay shot at hip-hop, though the ""blah blah blah"" might as well apply to guest MC Soom T's heard-it-before criticisms of government. (She's from Glasgow, and this track is a bit too much like Tricky once the paranoia started slowing down the creativity.) At its most interesting, Radio Blackout lets Raumschmiere do exactly what an album should let him do: work around whichever edges of his terrific singles sound aren't entirely appropriate for a club floor. I'm sure the folks at Mute are damned happy with that, and I am too-- it's nice to hear a full-length that captures what the man's known for quite so efficiently.","Bang bang buzz buzz gob gob growl: this is going to be one of those reviews where we just damn ...

Shadows on the Sun,Brother Ali,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4245e6ef959693207dc/1:1/w_160/3acf72b8.jpg,2003-08-14 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1066-shadows-on-the-sun/,Rhymesayers,"Fist. Skin. Blood. Cheers. This would prove to be a common sequence of events for the greatest boxer in history, Muhammad Ali. While sports historians never forget to mention his ability as a fighter, most will recall that he partially made his name by talking shit. From one Ali to another, the tradition continues. This time in the visage of a young Brother with two red eyes, pale white skin, a black soul and what I believe can safely be called one of the year's best albums. A Molotov cocktail of Nas' chipped-toothed storyteller, Slug's introspective emo-thug, and Common Sense's wordplay aficionado, Brother Ali has clearly studied the album structures of mid-90s masters. From the urine-soaked authenticity of his portrayal of inner city Minneapolis life (""Room with a View"") to the staggering detail of a conflict with his wife-beating neighbor (""Dorian"") to a bass monster spiritual alloy of The Legion's ""Jingle Jangle"" and Atmosphere's ""Flesh"", where he claims to be ""a cross between John Gotti and Mahatma Gandhi"" (""Bitchslap""), Ali focuses his powerful delivery equally on reality-based depth charges and classic rap braggadocio. In this regard, Brother Ali truly is the bad motherfucker his nom de plume ancestor was. On ""When the Beat Comes In"", he claims to be, ""A big teddy bear/ Until they scream 'stop slamming the car door, that's my fucking head in there!'"" and, subsequently, tells an invisible adversary that he'll ""serve your family and write about it in my journal like I'm Mr. Belvedere."" Brother Ali made a name for himself through freestyle competitions and mind-blowing live shows, and this energy translates well to the compact disc format. His greatest power lies within his sedimentary flow. His rhyme schemes skit and scat across instrumentals like pebbles breaking waves on the beach, while his sheer force-of-will cadence drags this album into the upper echelon. When Ali tells you that he's ""walking tall enough to make your half-moon whole,"" he says it with the confidence of a man that just stuffed the ballot box. Although the focus is consistently directed to Mr. Ali's magnetic delivery, props must be given to Atmosphere's Ant for his most consistent production to date. While his work with Slug has typically been hit (""Flesh"", ""Guns and Cigarettes"") or miss (""Tears for the Sheep""), this album is more or less flawless instrumentally. Clearly influenced by the RZA, and more recently, Rocafella associates Kanye West and Just Blaze, Ant has finally surrounded his single drumkit with samples that distract from his trademark headphone-destroying snare. The cheery church organ flourish of ""Forest Whitaker"" and the ridiculously smooth flute-guitar battle of ""Star Quality"" both exemplify Ant's sudden willingness to diversify his portfolio. Granted, not every beat is completely rock solid, and some of the most interesting tracks end far too quickly (""Forest Whitaker"" was a verse away from being the best song about living with Albinism ever, while Ali's collab with Slug, ""Missing Teeth"", sports one of the best beats on the album, but only lasts for less than two minutes), but when these kinds of minor issues are an album's only shortcomings, you tend to look past them. Shadows on the Sun one-ups Ali's already sick debut, and proves him one of the first great voices to emerge from the underground so far this century.","Fist. Skin. Blood. Cheers.

The scoop: Ads were placed in magazines throughout the 1960s and 70s for ""songs"" and ""poems"" that were ""needed"" for recording. And the salt of our exclusively God-blessed nation stood horny to (pay to) volunteer their inane scribblings for semi-cynical one-take sessioneers. I hate to whip out Greil's grail, but this CD teems with the ""old, weird America"" that still survives on public access TV and in the Culkin-fucking AOL chatrooms. Type up www.aspma.com for the full story of how the musicians used self-protecting pseudonyms and committed suicides; I can barely sober up enough to summarize certain of its 28 dumbfounding cuts, almost all of which are characterized by awkward phrasing and excellent musicianship: ""Rat a Tat Tat, America"": A bicentennial march about the dignity of birds that somehow builds to a machine-gun salute to our freest of lands that sold guns to Indonesian rapists, etc. Imagine an ""I Like Ike""-era Disney response to Bowling for Columbine. ""I Like Yellow Things"": Plagiarizes at least three standards to constitute an easy-boogie, canary-themed list, a la The Sound of Music. A ""Pomp and Circumstance"" for the short bus set. ""I'm Just the Other Woman"": Sung by a trilling male, from a lovestung Lazarus' point of view. John Waters needs this bad. ""Human Breakdown of Absurdity"": David Koresh gets a thesaurus. Something wonderful about Israel and the occult and the government and the undead and massacres and whores. ""Richard Nixon"": Stunning slice of civil religion, circa 'Nambat. I promise it ain't just a novelty; you'll recue the chorus, ""God in his infinite wisdom put Richard Nixon on this Earth/ To bring to us his heritage, one of priceless worth."" This ode to a ""blessed man, surely in God's plan"" will warm your heart as you give thanks for how Condolences Rice has hit up TVangelist Jack Van Impe for an ""outline"" of Revelation/Armageddon. Nixon is a ""genius,"" a ""miracle,"" ""the rapture of music and melody/ of culture and of love."" And curse those damned Jews! ""Jimmy Carter Says Yes"": Isaac Hayes does The Nation. Superfly does Plains, Georgia. The referendum gets skull-pimped. ""How Long Are You Staying"": Every line rhymes ""disco"" (Frisco, Crisco), but I can't tell if it's about unemployment or blueballs. ""I Lost My Girl to an Argentinean Cowboy"": Either the most suave slice of mannuendo ever, or the funniest slice of unintentional homoeroticism ever. Thrill to the saga of a ""cooing"" ""gayboy"" ""hip-shooting"" ""cavalier"" ""whip-cracking"" ""great-romancing"" ""tenor."" Watch out for the ""bunkhouse gang."" ""Ecstasy to Frenzy"": Fits seamlessly between ""Crimson and Clover"" and Forever Changes. The disc's best ""straight"" song, even if it's quaazonked. ""All You Need Is a Fertile Mind"": A touching (tee-hee) indictment of pornography, espousing a healthier masturbatory ethic of pretending. Why feed a ""woman like Venus"" when you could just ""unwind"" to the fantasy that your hand is a dream-cootch? When the backup singers kick in, decrying ""material waste of photography,"" you'll know in your rank heart that the smut-kings are but brainwashers. ""Gretchen's New Dish"": Wow. Wow. Oh man. Whew. Wow. Possibly the catchiest celebration of pedophile incest scat-crimes yet, beating out even Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love of All"". A six-year-old ""full of doodoo""`gets a present that a ""liquid swish"" lights up, just like ""Pa does his mustache cup."" I can't stop singing it. The children really are the future, I decided long ago. ""Blind Man's Penis"": I hope my mom isn't reading this review. These lyrics aren't honest; they're by someone who sent them in to see how far the song-poem orchestras would go for a vanity-buck. This anthem is about warts and nipples and zebras and Nazis and erections and gelatin-fingers. Recommended for white weddings.","I stand disarmed.

"A Picturesque View, Ignored",ScannerDavid ToopI/03,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e013d1975652139511/1:1/w_160/7b8f9e3d.gif,2003-08-13 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8109-a-picturesque-view-ignored/,Room40,"This album is a total fetish property. Regardless of what's even on it, it just looks like something you'd want to have sitting on your shelf: a carefully considered gatefold package, all duochrome design, featuring mathematical grid patterns on the outside, and cards inside sporting washed out photos of, well, picturesque views-- though it's safe to say that anyone picking this thing up will find them hard to ignore. Even the sans serif type seems carefully considered and laid out, in spite of all its utilitarian exposition about the music contained on the CD. Indeed, upstart Australian label Room40 appears to be making this packaging strategy a central tenet of its image, as all of their releases are similarly lavish. All this elaborate housing would still be neat, but nonetheless inconsequential, if it didn't match the music it housed, though, and on that score, it succeeds again. A Picturesque View, Ignored consists of a half-hour edit from a live performance at the Powerhouse in Brisbane, Australia that brings together three distinguished electronic performers, the UK's David Toop and Scanner (born Robin Rimbaud), and the Australian trio I/03. The performance is improvised, but it's not entirely knob-twiddling and gradually morphing sawtooth waves, as flutes, lap steel, guitar and keyboards all work their way into the consuming texture of the music. For those unfamiliar, David Toop (currently a contributing editor to the Wire), has been at this stuff since the 70s, and he's worked with an enormous number of experimental musical personalities over the years, from Brian Eno and Luke Vibert to John Zorn and even Grandmaster Flash. He's not a huge name, but it's hardly his own fault, as he's been involved in all kinds of fascinating music in his time. On the other end of the spectrum, I/03 are relative newcomers to the game, while Scanner is most famous-- or infamous, depending on where you stand-- for his recordings featuring scanned cell phone conversations between unwitting collaborators. The five musicians make some rather fascinating sounds together, and thankfully avoid the glitch aesthetic that's come to dominate modern electronic music, instead working meticulously to craft glowing, almost tactile soundscapes and fluid, chiming rhythm. Opener ""Arius Graeffei"" drifts languidly from sharp dissonance to pastel consonance, tethered always by omnipresent field recordings, Heinz Riegler's meditative, minimalist guitar, and strange noises that sound like someone moving small stones against each other in the palm of their hand. For improvised music, it's almost impossibly detailed, drawing in samples of Southeast Asian music and inscrutable conversations, and supplying rhythm so subtly in the background that at times the undulations are noticed more subconsciously than overtly. ""Smelt"" brings the rhythm to the fore, smoothing off the edges and immersing it in a bubblebath of processed guitar, digital noise and distant, wordless voices. Really what makes this music so successful is that it follows the laws of physics-- for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Noise never rises without giving way to calm, but at the same time, the noise never rises or recedes the same way twice, remaining unpredictable and liquid. Elements aren't always introduced in ways you'd expect either-- witness the way Toop utilizes the flute on ""Callixene"", accenting the sound of air passing into the flute moreso than the notes created by that air. Ultimately, A Picturesque View, Ignored demands your attention for its full duration, daring you to try and discern the guitar from the programmed sound, the field recording from the live noise. And, of course, as a whole package, it's just too perfect a unit to be denied. As a label, Room40 is carving out what appears to be a fairly distinctive niche, which, these days, is getting harder and harder to do, and as long as their releases remain as consistently engrossing as this one, their singular little gatefolds will always be welcome on my shelf.",,8.0,
Helio,Flim,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc613d197565213b5fd/1:1/w_160/34b78a8f.jpg,2003-08-13 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3100-helio/,Tomlab,"Flim's debut album, Given You Nothing, was an unusual release for Tomlab. Most of Enrico Wuttke's tracks (for he is Flim) were built around minimal piano melodies, with hints of synthesis added here and there. The Brian Eno/Harold Budd release The Plateaux of Mirror was one reference point, with a bit more processing and the occasional addition of beats. It was a fine record that stood apart from the bedroom IDM world it was lumped with-- it just didn't sound like anything else. Guitar-based laptop folktronica is everywhere at the moment; Wuttke is one of the few artists applying these same ideas (deconstructing and rearranging the deep associations bound up inside the tone of a familiar instrument) to the ancient, cumbersome piano. The follow-up album, Helio, is considerably more varied and ultimately more in line with Tomlab's catalog with its computer-based sound, but there remains a unique edge to Flim. Synthetic sounds now dominate and the piano becomes a baseline reference sound that comes and goes. ""How I Trashed My Knees"" beings the album, oddly enough, with a droning harmonium melody, but before the track disappears down a dark Grubbs-ian hole of endlessly held tones, a pop bassline and shakers come in, reminders that Flim works in the realm of instrumental pop. The piano doesn't even make an appearance until three minutes in, at which point Wuttke taps away on a tension-building cluster of notes, and then the drones recede and Wuttke finds solace in a pattern only slightly more complicated than ""Chopsticks"". ""How I Trashed My Knees"" introduces the more dynamic and layered version of Flim. The most arresting moments on Helio come when the sound of the piano is tweaked and rendered as imperfect and malleable as the surrounding electronics. The keyboard is recorded so high on ""Conversation"" that a mist of red distortion surrounds each note, bringing the sound of wood soundboards and steel wires completely into the electrical realm. ""Snow Behind My Chair"" achieves a similar effect. Both of these tracks go for an innocent music-box melody vibe, but ""New Livingin"" shows another side of Flim, with booming, distorted drums and a punchy keyboard riff that dissolves into a swirl of delicate feedback for its coda. Occasionally, Helio veers even further into abrasive territory. The midrange drone of ""For Fred"" almost seems designed to irritate the ear, although at low volume you'd never know it-- and the fact that it serves as a counterpoint to a minimal piano bit along with more huge percussion makes it more tolerable. No question, Helio is all over the place, a serious departure from Flim's debut. It's inevitably less consistent, but the range of material here points to many potentially intriguing future records.","Flim's debut album, Given You Nothing, was an unusual release for Tomlab.

quebec,Ween,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9e85e6ef959693214c7/1:1/w_160/07bc7b58.jpg,2003-08-13 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8605-quebec/,Sanctuary,"""'...So I kinda mope around all day, dropping hints, thinking everybody forgot my birthday, then just when I get home to tell everyone to go fuck themselves-- ""Surprise!"" And wouldn't you know, my mom has gone and arranged a surprise party. It's as lame as it's ever been on any other sitcom, but at least there's cake. Mom hands me a plate and says, 'Dig in, tubby.' So I get a piece of cake, take a bite, and all I can taste is the white-hot sting of metal piercing the roof of my mouth, and the metallic (like pennies, actually) taste of my own blood. I start screaming, spitting blood everywhere in giant, viscous globs, shouting, 'Why the hell are there razor blades in my birthday cake?' which pretty much sounds like 'blurbblurbblurbcake!' And my mom just says, 'Now you've gotten blood all over your birthday cake,' takes off her mask, and it's Dean and Gene Ween. I feel like I'm on Candid Camera; boy, am I ever embarrassed.' That's what I have so far."" ""Are you actually going to open a review like that? That's revolting! And boring! It doesn't even make any sense."" ""Neither does Ween. It's about Ween; besides, quebec is a boring album-- 'Guess what! It's Ween! We're insane for the entire first half! Surprised? No?' The biggest surprise is that halfway through, they turn into a poor man's Floyd. Whee. Plus, they once said that one of their fantasies as a band was to spray their audience down with diarrhea while playing 'Poop Ship Destroyer.' That's just as revolting."" ""Whatever, you're alienating your audience. No one wants to read about you gushing blood, or any of this nonsense. They want to read about Ween's new album."" ""C'mon, half the people who really like Ween live in psycho wards; I just gave them all a helpful suggestion."" ""You need to smoke this right now."" [Excerpted from ""quebec: Journey to the center of Ween""] Methcathinone (""Speed"" derivative, in common parlance): Total inability to relax or concentrate for any length of time. ""It's Gonna Be a Long Night"" takes on elevated significance; listened compulsively on repeat for fifty-one hours (1,080 repetitions). Throbbing rockabilly-by-way-of-cheese-metal riffs carried over from Moistboyz side project opened the album almost as well as the fondly remembered ""You Fucked Up"" opened GodWeenSatan. Made me want to set my room on fire; instead I repainted it twice, both times blue, as Gene sang directly to me, ""Don't call your mother/ Don't call a priest/ Don't call the doctor/ Call the police/ You bring the razor blade/ I'll bring the speed/ It's gonna be a long night."" Other songs not listened to. Oxycontin (Painkiller): ""Zoloft"" is nice. Sat motionless three inches above the couch, vaguely nauseated, while ""Zoloft""'s loopy, wavy percussion, harp-like flutterings, and lounge keyboards kept me floating sedately. Almost laughed when Dean sang about sucking down Zoloft, but then didn't feel like it. Almost thought it sounded forced, like a gratuitous inclusion for people who expected another quirky track like ""The HIV Song"", but then didn't feel like it. Total tropical hammock-style, piña colada relaxation. The weird pixie voices in the background almost scared me, but then I didn't feel like it. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): Mixed effect. The total randomness of the album's first half-- from metal-blade racket, to classic rock nostalgia, to full-on whacked-out Ween-ness-- is all hilariously near-perfect Ween. Even the name makes me giggle. Ween. Heh. The Vaudevillian theatrics of ""Hey There Fancypants"" made me wet myself with laughter, but it stopped there. Even on nitrous, the tired, prog-influenced back end of quebec isn't very funny. Cannibis (Marijuana): I totally get it. It all makes sense now, man... On ""Captain"", they're not just, like, ripping off Floyd's massive orchestral swells and psychedelic haze; they're channeling it, you know? Ween, like, goofs on that wacky shit like the creepy vibes of ""Happy Colored Marbles"", but they left their hearts back in the 60s; the overblown classic rock sweep is the true Ween. The apocalyptic build of ""If You Could Save Yourself (You'd Save Us All)"" is vintage, Ziggy-caliber Bowie, ""The Argus"", and it's still, like... but the most boring track of all, ""Alcan Road"", in which there's nothing but hollowed-out, windy drone for, like, ever is cool, on pot. Even the indecipherable, thrashing noise at the tempestuous center of ""So Many People in My Neighborhood"" is brilliant as a break from the way serious psychedelic guitar washes, sitars, and underwater vocals of tracks like the aptly named ""Tried and True"". It's a total bummer, too, 'cause when I'm sober I like ""crazy Ween"" a whole lot more than ""sincere-ish Ween,"" and there's a whole lot more of the latter on this album. I'm gonna need more pot. Diacetylmorphine (Heroin): No effect. Passed out; threw up in my own mouth. [Excerpted from my soon-to-be-published biography, Nancy Reagan: Wolf in a Sheep's Hairdo] And lo! she approached the podium, and thus spake to the doe-eyed graduating class of Winnemack University, 1982: ""Graduating class of 1982, hear me! Just say 'No' to drugs! I never took drugs, and I'm First Lady of the most powerful nation in the world! I had sex with the President! The hippies lost! No one listens to that freaky, burnout ""progressive rock"" anymore! Really, no one even cares about Pink Floyd or Jethro Tull!"" She didn't talk about the graduation, or the future, or anything; most heard her message, but some did not. Were Gene and Dean Ween in the audience that day? Did they even go to college? I don't know, but I do know this: By the time they finally burned through whatever stash they had and got around to making quebec, they learned a few lessons, and did some growing up along the way. They can still sell crazy with the best of 'em, and they do, for a while; when they calm down a little, though, suddenly lines like, ""I'm makin' time/ Breakin' ground/ Greyhound Bus to chocolate town,"" are still good for a chuckle, but there's a disturbingly genuine honesty underlying it all, and the beautiful echoes of the cascading solo to conclude ""I Don't Want It"" will kill any hint of cynicism in even the blackest heart. But back to Nancy... [Excerpted from the review most people probably wished I had written] I don't think anyone who already has some notion of wanting quebec could possibly be disappointed-- it's the genre-defying psych of The Mollusk and the incongruous irreverence of 12 Golden Country Greats, and some of the madness that is GodWeenSatan, and it's a lot better than the go-nowhere White Pepper, but nothing I say makes any difference. It's Ween. Their fans adore them, and the rest of you don't care.","""'...So I kinda mope around all day, dropping hints, thinking everybody forgot my birthday, then just\n\ when I get ...

Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane,Cobra High,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d6ea9e61561daa545f/1:1/w_160/f1d565b6.jpg,2003-08-13 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1718-sunset-in-the-eye-of-the-hurricane/,Cold Crush,"To catch the various, knobs, keys, and gauges lightly imprinted on the stark white cover of Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane, tilt it around a bit, locate a bright enough angle in the room-- perhaps changing locations-- and let each ghostly marking catch the sun. On their first full length, Cobra High's willingness to insert such detail and to mesh equally subtle sonic layers into compositions pushes them beyond the faux-dark edginess of such overdressed lightweights as the Faint. Avoding the pompous caricatures of their paper-thin brethren, Cobra High's aesthetic know-how deepens upon repeated listens, their understated hooks lodging themselves into your frontal lobe through their integral placement. Featuring eight tracks roaming in and around analog synth and drum machine, all spun through guitar, bass, and actual drums, this two-year-old Seattle four piece channels New Order, Roxy Music, Cabaret Voltaire, Pere Ubu, and some less vaunted 1980s Midwestern scavengers. The album begins with three solid tracks that don't stutter anywhere in their pronunciation of that decade's more interesting half. ""Paper Gods"" inaugurates the underkill with a flashback sounding much like The Damned's ""Smash It Up"". Beyond this ringing synth introduction, the track shifts focus to a rave-up akin to the vastly forgotten Naked Raygun. In fact, Naked Raygun vocalist Jeff Pezzati is one of the better comparisons for Justin Schwartz's resonantly dusted baritone. The second track, ""White Diamond"", is a lyrically psychedelic dream-quest about a river; here Schwartz's smokey delivery brings to mind the stand-off cool of early Urge Overkill. Blend this with the rhythmically sublime Mission of Burma rocking along to New Order's stark ministrations and you'll get a sense of the track's overall arc. Rounding out the triad, the ridiculously titled prog instrumental, ""Awesomology"" packs a Wire meets King Crimson wallop, though, admittedly, post Trans Am's agonizingly ironic posturing, I can muster no love for the vocorder. Still, with two strikes against it, the track is a sloppily pretty whirling dervish that would've been better served if named after the evocative album title. But Cobra High set the bar too high, and much of the remainder of Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane falters. ""Black Boomerang"", for example, errs noticeably on the side of that particular Luxx brand of new wave. Here, the rock resonances of ""Paper Gods"" and ""White Diamond"" are ditched in favor of mewling Faint-styled ponderousness; like much of that abyssmal genre, it sounds like incidental music to low-budget film noir. ""El Fang Dorado"", on the other hand, does bring the rock, but by fixating on naval-gazing math dynamics and not the outward-looking old-school charisma of the stronger work, it turns into anonymous Breadwinner aping by guys with too much time on their hands to practice their scales. Worst of all, the album peters out sourly with ""A Leaded Trace"", a maudlin dear-mom-and-dad bit centered around piano, distant ""angelic"" vocals, and a half-assed sing-a-long. The wimpiest XTC was more explosive. Not that it's all shit after the handshake: ""A Cut of the Money"" smartly manages the band's varied ingredients, treading a rich liminal space between each layer, carving-out five minutes of hooky artiness honing-in on and honoring the furious noisemaking of Pere Ubu's Pennsylvania. Moments like this confirm suspicions that the stronger tracks weren't a fluke. Despite the missteps, Cobra High make it plainly obvious that too many over-determined contemporary pretenders are pillaging the wrong paths through borrowed '80s record collections. For those who've always like more rock and less hairspray, you'd do yourself some historical good if you searched out Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane along with the band's self-titled EP on Grand Mal. While you're at it, why not absorb a bit of the band's smartly evoked influences?","To catch the various, knobs, keys, and gauges lightly imprinted on the stark white cover of Sunset in the Eye ...

Vulnerable,Tricky,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80a5e6ef95969321104/1:1/w_160/a0136127.jpg,2003-08-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8152-vulnerable/,Sanctuary,"Earlier this month, I paused for a moment while noticing that Tricky's debut album, Maxinquaye, was released in 1995. The date didn't seem right. One reason was because Tricky's work with Massive Attack and his groundbreaking early singles predated the LP's release by two or three years; another is because it's still difficult to believe that he's been considered irrelevant for only about a mere four or five years. It's been an unfair fall, in some ways. That's not to say that paranoid ramblings about your record label or a trio of disappointing to disastrous albums (Angels with Dirty Faces, Juxtapose, and Blowback) aren't grounds for turning your back on an artist. But as one of the architects of a much-maligned former ""now"" sound, the pressure on Tricky to stay ahead of the curve was perhaps always going to be an impossible burden, and so it seems that with every subsequent release, the shadow of Maxinquaye has loomed. The recent release of the Island-issued best-of comp, A Ruff Guide, is a reminder that at least the first two of Tricky's missteps have something worth salvaging. Yet with the release of Tricky's seventh album, Vulnerable, the Maxinquaye comparisons are perhaps apt. Tricky's latest record seems to celebrate his new label and locale, and his seemingly healthier outlook on life: Instead of wading in a swamp of paranoia and dread, he's stepping into the light with sunnier tones, brighter hues, lilting strings, and even some soothing melodies. Unfortunately, this figurative new start is also literally reminiscent of his stunning debut, even going as far as drafting in a female vocalist (Costanza) who can't help but remind listeners of Tricky's original muse, Martina Topley-Bird. So after years of running into creative dead ends, Tricky seems as if he's retraced his steps. The retreat to his career starting line is more than a bit distracting. Vulnerable does begin by hitting a few promising notes. ""Stay"" has a galloping rhythm, dub undertones, and playful melody, and its boy/girl lyric makes effective use of the dual vocals. (Unfortunately, Tricky's rasp is featured on every track, sometimes to superfluous effect.) The second and third tracks, ""Antimatter"" and ""Ice Pick"", are even more encouraging. Each is a restrained nod to everyone's new favorite decade (that's the 80s)-- the former has both a curiously bubbly vocal hook and melody that wouldn't be out of place on a Sugababes or Girls Aloud record, and the latter has a propulsive hook. Another keeper, ""Car Crash"", is delicate, atmospheric, and the best showcase for Costanza's graceful voice, although it's just a Zero 7 remix away from lapsing into chillout compilation territory. From there, things go downhill quickly. The new-wave tangents are continued on Tricky's requisite covers, this time of XTC's ""Dear God"" and The Cure's ""The Love Cats"" [sic], neither of which is worth a second listen. Tricky's own compositions on the remainder of the record are even more problematic. A trio of stabs at high-octane guitar tracks-- ""How High"", ""Where I'm From"", and ""Moody""-- are clumsy and canned, a common result when riffs and power chords are shunted off to the side of a track rather than supplying the meat of a song. (And, unfortunately, those who merely dabble in guitars for those reasons seem to universally make them sound ham-fisted and bury them in the mix.) By the end of the album, Tricky returns to acting on his worst impulses, stumbling through hackneyed sonics and wincing lyrics. ""Wait for God"" is a dull and simplistic anti-Christian commentary with lines like ""I wait for God and it's very hard."" Album closer ""Search, Search, Survive"" poorly nicks Duran Duran's ""Save a Prayer"" and passes off ""You're lucky alive/ You could be Aaliyah"" as sentiment. At one point in that track, Costanza reads an Italian translation of the song's lyric. If this is supposed to be a new beginning for Tricky, at least that implies an acknowledgment of past sins. A full exorcism of his defensive inclinations and the Maxinquaye blueprint would be a welcome next step but less than a decade after his startling debut, it's hard to imagine that this once-bulletproof talent has the goods to offer more than the ghosts of his own past.","Earlier this month, I paused for a moment while noticing that Tricky's debut album, Maxinquaye, was released in 1995 ...

Shades of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note,Madlib,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4325e6ef959693239dc/1:1/w_160/2b1d824e.gif,2003-08-12 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5541-shades-of-blue-madlib-invades-blue-note/,Blue Note,"Listening to Madlib's music, I'm reminded of the Black radical maestros responsible for some of the outermost-limits music-making of the past half-century: Sun Ra, George Clinton, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry-- it's an elite club, but by no means an exclusive one. What sets these artists apart from their contemporaries and/or imitators is the fact that their effortless, genuine material occupyies the fringes of acceptable musicality without ever sounding pretentious; they translate their visions direct to tape and send them out into the world to fend for themselves. By definition, such prophets are prolific, and usually to a fault: who has time to edit existing ideas when there are already a dozen more waiting to be made musical flesh? It's a curse/blessing that makes for horribly inconsistent discographies with two or three full-out flops for every single flash of brilliance. In less than ten years, Madlib has proven himself a logical heir to this peculiar tradition. He's already got more projects under his belt than Sun Ra had hats. Beginning with his role as emcee and producer with the Oxnard, CA-based Lootpack, Madlib has gone on to infiltrate the musical consciousness with an entire backpack worth of aliases: the helium-blunted rapper Quasimoto, the one-man nu-jazz band Yesterday's New Quintet, and collaborations under his more common name with Jaydee (Jaylib) and MF Doom (Madvillian). Like the aforementioned auteurs, Madlib's projects have their share of hits and misses, but the creativity and lack of stultifying concern for critical assessment clearly shows there's a lot more coming down the line. It's a bit of a surprise, then, that an artist as multi-faceted as Madlib was invited into the dank catacombs of the original Blue Note master tapes for a ""remix"" project. Though he's certainly not the first to gain access to the house that Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff built, his predecessors-- Pete Rock, Biz Markie, Us3-- were cut from a considerably safer cloth; which presumably explains the decision to package the results as Madlib ""invading"" the Blue Note catalog, just in case his unpredictability happened to get the best of him. But, gentle executives, your gamble pays off two-fold: Madlib gets a shot at a significantly wider audience and the label has an opportunity to redeem itself for all those Kurt Elling and Joe Lovano records they've been haplessly peddling since the early 90s. Appropriately enough, Madlib's multiple personality disorder creates the ""shades of blue"" the title refers to. On one hand, he stars as himself, semi-dutifully remixing Blue Note classics by Gene Harris & The Three Sounds, Donald Byrd, Ronnie Foster and Bobby Hutcherson into outsider works of downtempo and instrumental hip-hop art. With the exception of Bobbi Humphrey's ""Please Set Me At Ease""-- which Madlib and guest emcee Medaphoar transform into Slum Village hip-hop-- there's nothing overtly radical about the remixes, but closer listening reveals strange happenings in their murky depths, as the role reversal of foregrounded breakbeat and buried melody on the disc's centerpiece ""Stepping Into Tomorrow"" illustrate exquisitely. The rest of the tracks are ""new interpretations of Blue Note classics"" by Yesterday's New Quintet and its offshoot ensembles Morgan Adams Quartet Plus Two, Sound Direction and the Joe McDuphrey Experience. Don't be fooled: this is entirely the work of Madlib and his uncanny ability to play a disorienting number of instruments, and his equally clever habit of inventing names for each member of the fictional band(s). As a result, these pieces are slightly more linear in construction, relying more on harmony and tempo dynamics than the loops upon which the remixes are largely built, but are similarly genius in terms of both concept and execution. Madlib even goes so far as to fake a live recording for the Joe McDuphrey Experience's medley of Horace Silver's ""Peace"" and Herbie Hancock's ""Dolphin Dance"", only to give himself away by chopping up the mix beyond recognition in the middle of the piece. Judging from the results of this encounter, I'd like to see Madlib let loose upon the Saturn catalog, or crafting a Yesterday's New Quintet record of Parliament-Funkadelic tunes like the one he concocted in tribute to Stevie Wonder last year. But if his creative impulse moves along at anything remotely attuned to the speed it has so far, I'm sure there'll be five or six more Madlib-helmed records to sort through every year from here to Armageddon as he hits and misses his way to defining his own Black radical cosmology.","Listening to Madlib's music, I'm reminded of the Black radical maestros responsible for some of the outermost-limits music-making ...

Playing it Cool and Playing it Right,Keith Hudson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1495e6ef9596932369b/1:1/w_160/42559cab.gif,2003-08-12 05:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3966-playing-it-cool-and-playing-it-right/,Joint InternationalJoint International,"Is it mere coincidence that, the week I undergo the horrific pain of a root canal and a complimentary bottle of vicodin, the Basic Channel-- the solid German techno imprint that's dabbled in roots-reggae sounds of late-- showcases their new Basic Replay branch by releasing a confounding dub showcase set from a producer that also doubled as a dentist? Taken together, even in normal dosages, the combined effect of pharmaceutical painkiller and the dusted early-eighties dub of Keith Hudson is woozy and disorienting in all the right ways. It would be hard to tell anything just from the cover reproduction. My prescription bottle's got ten times the info. A faded, slightly stained, plain card sleeve has only Hudson's name and ""Playing It Cool"" stamped across the front; nary a sliver of information is found as to who took part. Research ties it to the Wackie's crew, which does make a modicum of sense, as Basic Channel spearheaded the Lloyd ""Bullwackie"" Barnes set of reissues that documented his peculiar Bronx seepage from the turn of the decade. Even in light of the high work so far, this is one messed-up set. In what would fatally be his penultimate release, Hudson recapitulates six old rhythms, but with his intimate knowledge of them, he cuts the heads up from the start, each element destabilized. By the time of ""California""/ ""By Night Dub"", Playing it Cool and Playing it Right takes a dark turn, much like the drive croaked about within the grooves. Over the distant humming of two girls singers (the Love Joys, perhaps?), Hudson croons about the ""darkest night on the wet-looking road"" that envelopes both his head and road trip, and the vox-rippled guitars and murky drum hits stir up a dense dub mud that clouds all signposts. A drum crumbles over the damaged voices, and even at a slurred speed, the landscape is blurry. Even this couldn't prepare you for the showcase of ""Not Good for Us""/ ""Formula Dub"": double- and triple-tracking painfully out-of-tune ramblings and crazed crooning, Hudson ends up knee-deep in the frontal lobe goop that Ol' Dirty Bast-- uh, Dirt McGirt slops about in. Shouting ""too much formula ain't good for my head, ain't good for the dread,"" with about as much heed paid for its own warning as Melle Mel's ""White Lines"" or a Sly Stone anti-drug PSA, every voice of Hudson's is sucked down the drain. The banged piano stumbles behind as sped-out guitars threaten to pull free of the tape, the beat flickering in and out of consciousness. With scarce regard for rhythm or levels, Hudson flashes infinitely-ripp(l)ed congas and guitars immediately into ""Be What You Want to Be""/ ""Be Good Dub"" which makes every other instrument shake in its wake. Most soulful is the last set, ""I Can't Do Without You"", which confirms how much American soul, funk, and rock went into Hudson's productions by this time. It only clocks in at a half-hour, but with a tangibly tainted vibe that tastes as much like drug-addled rock classics like Dr. John's Gris Gris or Funkadelic's Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow as it does Lee Perry's Super Ape, it's a long, strange trip.","Is it mere coincidence that, the week I undergo the horrific pain of a root canal and a complimentary bottle ...

The Golden River,Frog Eyes,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17913d197565213863e/1:1/w_160/739ab031.jpg,2003-08-12 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3265-the-golden-river/,Animal World,"It's unfortunate that imagination is so frequently seen as antithetical to sincerity. We expect personal truths and broad revelations from musicians, but we often expect these insights should be delivered through a mundane, relatable form of honesty. Sure, singers often borrow words, ideas and emotions from the experiences of others, ranging from friends and family to long-dead or non-existent cultural and historical figures. But these identities are almost always kept somehow separate from that of the singer, who in turn manipulates these secondary personas into acceptable personal statements and observations. Though Carey Mercer's voice is heard throughout The Golden River, the identity of the album's narrator always seems to be shifting and slipping. The album is less a work of cognizant storytelling than a fever dream. Personal and cultural memory bleed together, as Mercer spins fractured images lifted straight from the pages of Grimm Brothers fairy tales and Homeric Epics. And yet, nothing about The Golden River seems contrived or gratuitously literary: its otherworldly sonic and lyric richness is matched at every turn by the striking immediacy of Mercer's wide-eyed delivery. The result is a record every bit as stunning and imaginative as it is memorable and affecting, and one of the most unique and interesting I've heard in ages. ""One in Six Children Will Flee in Boats"" opens the album with a flimsy, strummed guitar figure that's immediately, strikingly overshadowed by Mercer's breathy gasp. Suddenly, a rich swell of guitar, drums, and keyboards evokes a grandiosity bringing to mind glam-era Bowie; Mercer captures the Thin White Duke's anthemic and melodic delivery, but couples it with a frenzied, grizzled intensity and the gruff, world-weary sensibility of Tom Waits. Mercer matches this intensity lyrically, singing ""Over that ridge, a hunter lives/ Stake him out with broken gifts/ By the light, by the merry men/ Who gave his lives when he gave knives to children/ Raise him up, stake him up/ Grab the sun and drink his blood in cups!"" Out of context, it may seem nonsensical, but the conviction with which Mercer sings renders it an unnervingly powerful image. After an ethereal instrumental break, ""Time Reveals Its Plan at Poisoned Falls"" plays up the operatic nature of Mercer's voice, as he rattles off funhouse mirror images of a royal court and hissed accusations of jealousy. Rather than simply sounding crazy, he conveys the doomed frenzy of a prophet. About halfway through the song, he sings as if possessed by the spirit of the monarch whose death he has forseen: ""I'm the head of the queen/ I float around the night unseen/ And I know when to scream 'oh baby wake up!'"" At a mere 1:29, ""Time Reveals Its Plan at Poisoned Falls"" is both a vivid fantasy and a desperate plea to return to consciousness and reality, a potent juxtaposition that Mercer hints at throughout the record. A procession of similarly strong songs follows, each one sonically rich and brimming with melody and imagination. Only ""Orbis Magnus"" temporarily shifts the tone of the record to one of unadulterated, introspective sadness. In a subdued mumble, Mercer intones: ""You can have boyfriends, but not men/ You want your words to be penned/ There's women on the barge, on the waters that bend."" Here, Mercer seems to embody the timeless trope of the lonely monster, his previous outbursts reduced to a barely-contained air of self-loathing. The Golden River closes with two of its strongest tracks. ""World's Greatest Concertos"" is a fit of gleeful self-destruction, as if Mercer has finally been driven mad by the images he has seen, shouting ""Encapsulate the body and emasculate the body/ And hold the burning waters, the tubs of burning waters/ Holiday!/ The trees are bones and dipped in wazing burning cones and call a celebration/ The master's burnt in his burning station."" Mercer's shrieking falsetto it segues into the sublime ""Picture Framing the Gigantic Men Who Fought on Steam Boats"", the most beautiful song on The Golden River and also quite possibly the most unsettling. The vocals are slightly more subdued here, cushioned by breathy backup singing provided by Carolyn Mark. Right before it ends, ""Picture Framing"" takes on a somber and ominous tone, as Mercer repeats, ""I'll keep on sailing on/ Until the rosy-pink dawn,"" cleverly citing a Homeric epithet to suggest that his voyage will, in fact, never really end. It's a stunning moment of resignation, as the narrator accepts his place in this terrifyingly vivid fantasy world. This album seems to exist in a world apart from our own. From Melanie Campbell's insistent, simple, and often strangely cartoonish drumming to Carey Mercer's fantastical lyrics and overwrought delivery, The Golden River taps directly into your imagination, short-circuiting any traditional notions of what should constitute ""sincere"" and ""emotional"" music. These songs are the lost soundtracks to those frantic, epic dreams that you can never remember in their entirety, but stay with you for the rest of your life.","It's unfortunate that imagination is so frequently seen as antithetical to sincerity.

Parallelograms,Linda Perhacs,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a162c0084474cd0bfdca/1:1/w_160/46486b35.jpg,2003-08-12 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6521-parallelograms/,KappKapp,"As can be gleaned from the cover of her one and only record, Linda Perhacs was a stunning, beautiful love child. Anyone who spent the $200-400 necessary to obtain copies of the original vinyl could attest that the music she made was comparably stunning and beautiful, infused with all the trappings of being a late-sixties love child (in the best possible way). Ace of Discs reissued her album after unsuccessful attempts to track her down, mastering from a poorly pressed vinyl copy. For whatever reason, the first issue on CD was completely unlistenable on headphones, although delightful in the open air. Since that first go-round, Perhacs has come out of her obscure Pacific Northwest woods with quarter-inch reels of the sessions, and now that Ace of Discs comes round again with a vindicating, expanded reissue, the tray card photo reveals: she's still a babe. Anyway you eye it, this is a magical, sublimely singular piece of gentle folk-psych that belongs with those lone album classics by folks like Skip Spence or Vashti Bunyan (or the countless other souls that only released one record before disappearing into history's communal farms or funny-farm madness, like Elyse). It is a sound so personal and intimate that I can only hear it in the privacy of my own room. Although it's been near-impossible to gain biographical information about her, the experience of hearing her music reveals so much about her soul and mindset at the time that I really don't think I could share it with anyone else. As mentioned above, she's a love child in every sense, a young woman blossoming into her sensual world. Of the elements, every song culls its images from her forest environment, permeating down into her own physical core. ""Chimacum Rain"" is not only the forest's silence and that sound of rain washing over her, but the palpable sexual presence of her lover, too. In almost every evocation of a tactile natural image, there is a mysterious man who physically embodies these characteristics, a tension courses through her body as she sings about these near-deities. And as she reaches the bridge with lines such as ""I'm spacing out/ I'm seeing silences between leaves...I'm seeing silences that are his,"" her voice begins to echo within itself, and her sung notes assuage open the aural synesthesia of the words. The diaphanous taste of lysergic acid creeps to the fore, and what was once a moderately played acoustic song about the forest expands into a hallucinatory clearing as her multi-tracked held tones meld with the infinite. As her voice dilates, so does the background, now all electrically-processed source sounds like xylophones and wind chimes, and all is enveloped by a low, distorted drone that would one day sound like Phill Niblock, created by-- as the liner notes so baldly state it-- ""amplified shower hose for horn effects."" It's nothing compared to the album's peak, ""Parallelograms"". Perhaps you fantasize that Joni Mitchell teaches painting and pottery at your high school, or that Chan Marshall mumbles about the Apocalypse poets during English class, but Perhacs teaching geometry is tantrically hot for teacher. To just read the lyrics of ""Quadrehederal/ Tetrahedral/ mono-cyclo-cyber-cilia"" is to miss how she and producer Leonard Rosenman assuredly layer her heavenly-sung rounds in concentric circles over a cycling guitar-picked figure, a cumulative effect that reveals a dimension scarcely achieved anywhere else in the world of music. Closer to the Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria or Tim Buckley's cellular self-choir ""Starsailor"" than Melanie or Linda Ronstadt, Perhacs drops us into drifting clouds of reverberating bells, echoing flute, and ghostly effluence, her throat outside of time. That a dental assistant in Northern California could more effectively convey the psychedelic experience through the use of the technology of experimental effects, be it early Pink Floyd, Fifty-Foot Hose, or Buffy Saint-Marie's electroacoustic Illuminations, is, in every clichéd use of the word, mind-blowing. Other songs deal with girly things like brawny mountain men, dolphins, moonbeams and cattails, the pastel colors of dawn, and the recently-unearthed ""If You Were My Man"" reveals that she could've gone pop with a Karen Carpenter wispiness. Listening to her home demos and studio notes to Roseman though show that she was cognizant of the sound and vibration she wanted. The tape collage lobbed from ""Hey Who Really Cares?"" is competent-- if in hindsight, passé-- all disembodied, television voices and a telltale heart beat leading into its pastoral prettiness. Her most folky tunes stand up to the times too, but it's the fact that Linda Perhacs' entire cosmos (and whatever those times entailed) could inexplicably fit inside the confines of Parallelograms that remains the true testament to her beauty.","As can be gleaned from the cover of her one and only record, Linda Perhacs was a stunning, beautiful love ...

II,Bride of No No,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e39d034d5c69bf281b/1:1/w_160/fc8920d8.gif,2003-08-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/932-ii/,Atavistic,"Bride of No No's first album, B.O.N.N. Appetit!, was the first post-Scissor Girls offering from AZ (also known as Azita Youssefi), and offered a restrained and refined take on the jagged and frayed chaos the Girls were best known for. This current offering, the second and final Bride of No No record, comes on the heels of Azita's newest record, Enantiodromia, and offers even more refinement, owing more to the laidback acerbic cool of Steely Dan than the scatological indignation of The Fall. Knowing that II was actually produced between B.O.N.N. Appetit! and Azita's newest album, it's not surprising to learn that it serves as a bridge between the Bride's loose interpretation of rock and Azita's Bowie-esque balladry. My first impressions of the record made me think this was a bridge best left burned. The music sounded stiff and inept. Azita's singing, already something of an acquired taste, sounded particularly wretched, her atonal cawing and yawping more affected than affecting. And the addition of a piano to certain tracks brought to mind unflattering, cacophonous thoughts of B.O.N.N. Appetit! and Enantiodromia playing simultaneously at unbearable volumes. A track like ""Slugville"" was a prime offender in this regard-- it starts with some distorted guitar, and then begins to shamble along, with some piano along for the halting ride. After two minutes of stumbling, the song switches gears, grinding against itself before going for a brief jaunt, and then concluding with a reprisal of the introductory shamble. And, of course, there's Azita, mewling about the best show on earth being free or some such nonsense. It sounded awful, chaotic in the worst possible way, ill-formed and misbegotten. But then I gave it another listen. I noticed how the instrumentation, for all its shoddiness and seeming ineptitude, stayed steady, established a pattern, propelled this sluggish song. In fact, all the elements of the song-- the lazy leaden guitar soloing, the drunken piano, the stumblebum drums-- act like things you'd hear in an ordinary blues lament. In this light, the piano I heard as superfluous and distracting actually lends this thudding track some necessary buoyancy, and also anchors the tempo changes. If you can listen past some cosmetic ugliness, there's plenty of other rewards to be found on this album. ""Proven Formula"" doesn't actually offer one, but instead gives you three songs within its five minute frame. ""Wait a Min"" is the closest this record comes to conventionally rocking out, though it's still not all that conventional. The ten minutes of ""Piano One"" switch between tortured piano-led ruminations and the Bride's particular brand of rock (discordant, haphazard, abrasive) in the service of telling a not-so-simple story-- ""It's all right that you go/ I would follow... Watch as the film runs slo-mo/ To catch a bigger man than you or I/ To be the bigger man than you'd like."" And, in case you're hankering for something that's readily accessible, the 3\xBD minutes of ""Piano Intro"" are without a doubt the most beautiful moments this record has to offer. For the folks out there willing to work and give this record a chance, it's a just reward.","Bride of No No's first album, B.O.N.N. Appetit!, was the first post-Scissor Girls offering from AZ ...

Test Three MULTIPLE CHOICE. Read the following questions and select the best answer from the options listed below. 01. Given the following description of a track from Bardo Pond's recent ATP release On the Ellipse, indicate the song title and emotional hue in which the work metaphorically bathes you. ""Beginning with a melody laid out sparingly by a somber acoustic guitar-- so intimately close you can hear nimble fingers sliding on the greased frets-- the song builds on its base with calculated, yet never forced harmonies, in part courtesy of the ethereal and omnipresent wind. After an appropriately soothing lull, the droning crash manifests as the rhythm section propels itself into the spotlight, lasting until the song's lumbering end. (a) ""Killing All The Flies"", no...Happy Songs For Happy People + Green.
(b) ""Every Man"" + Black.
(c) That song with the paper-thin allegory + Grey.
(d) All of the above.
(e) None of the above. 02. You're at a concert. A hot Earth Mother-looking woman is playing Sabbath riffs on a flute set against a wavering guitar line. Drum and bass work together to draw out overarching stomps of pure noise and energy that eventually form a blistering, dense wall. What is the name of the band you are watching, what song are they playing, and what is the concordant sexual position to accompany intimate listening to said song? (a) Fleetwood Mac + ""Say You Love Me"" + The Butterfly
(b) Bardo Pond + ""Dom's Lament"" + Missionary
(c) Slint + (the song the group would have made had they contracted a female band-member as advertised in the liner notes of Spiderland) + Gemini
(d) I don't know. Personally, I only take note of clarinet players, what with their tighter embouchure and greater tongue control.
(e) None of the above. MATCHING. Match the following artist with their band role. 1. Isobelle Sollenberger
2. Michael Gibbons
3. Clint Takeda
4. John Gibbons
5. Joe Culver (a) Guitar 1
(b) Guitar 2
(c) Vocalist/Flautist
(d) Drummer
(e) Bassist PASSAGE INTERPRETATION. Answer the following questions based upon analysis of the given excerpt. ""...similar to Janis Joplin fronting Acid Mothers Temple buried underneath a fog of dense instrumentation. A tumultuous guitar chimes in to wonderful effect, as Isobelle's voice fluctuates from meek humility to forceful gusto, building toward a plump bass line that slides ""Test"" into silent acquiescence. ""JD"" and ""Walking Clouds"" both make use of the dry ambience of their recording atmosphere, the former eventually laying on thick electric reverb in lieu of its introductory acoustic sound, the latter content to muddle on the six-string like a less complex John Fahey. To this mixture ""Clouds"" also adds a faint human sighing/humming, acting as the constant, lesser companion to a flourishing flute melody, a tune that constantly has to fight for fresh air over the entire second half of the track. The heavy hitter comes last: ""Night Of Frogs"" ends the album on a deservedly high note. After a guitar- and effects-laden false intro, the song eventually begins with the light plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar, laying the foundation for a melody that will eventually be eaten alive by song's end. Atop a full load of odd percussion, Isobelle expounds on the uneasy topic of mortality and the speed with which one's time passes on Earth, slowly leading the listener into the belly of the beast as bongos usher in the inevitable and desirable crash and crescendo of the fully orchestrated band. The frontal assault is slowly deflated until the song's relatively peaceful end, leaving one nearly as grateful for the conclusion as the experience itself. 01. What is the reviewer's general attitude of the work in question? (a) Overall distaste with strong leanings toward hatred.
(b) Ambivalence-- why should such a small wrinkle in the fabric of music cause a stir one way or the other?
(c) Strong regard for the composition-- album of the year material.
(d) Lukewarm acceptance of an on par work, produced by a decidedly enjoyable band. 02. Based upon the above critique, would you: (a) Agree with the reviewer. Though the fusion of jam band mentality does fortuitously jell with the ebb and flow of post-rock instrumental techniques, at times this mixture can highlight the more undesirable characteristics of both musical genres.
(b) Disagree with the reviewer. This is stoner-rock at its epitome; the reviewer needs to toke up or get out.
(c) Strongly disagree with the reviewer. Expect a flurry of emails attempting to ridicule the haphazard opining of said miscreant.
(d) Neither agree or disagree.","Music Criticism 225:

Out of Reach,Can,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fc13d1975652138e3f/1:1/w_160/8920d6e6.jpg,2003-08-11 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1270-out-of-reach/,EFA MedienMarginal Talent,"When Can reissued their catalog on CD in the late '90s, one album was quietly left behind. Out of Reach, from 1978, failed to make the cut. For 25 years, whenever this record has been reissued, it's been as a questionable semi-bootleg mastered from vinyl, and never endorsed by the band. Apparently, Can want to keep this one under rug swept. How bad can it be? It's not a total loss. In fact, from one perspective, Out of Reach is an inspiration. Knowing that the godlike musical force that recorded the Tago Mago --> Ege Bamyasi --> Future Days troika could, only a few short years later, sink to this level of awfulness makes anything seem possible. Perhaps our lives are in a constant state of flux and any one of us might turn out a hero or a murderer, an exciting prospect, if you think about it. If Karoli, Liebezit and Schmidt can one day decide to transform their pristine artrock rhythm machine into a beered-up and sloppy Pablo Cruise in a jammy mood, maybe we can move equally far in the other direction. You'll notice I made no mention of Holger Czukay-- that's 'cos he chose to be completely the fuck out of reach when the boys went into the studio to record. He came back for Inner Space the following year, but wasn't a member of Can at this point. Rosko Gee, who joined in 1977 for Saw Delight (along with percussionist and fellow Traffic alum Rebop Kwaku Baah) handles the bass duties. His parts aren't bad, actually, and Baah's percussion is sometimes the most interesting thing going, so there's no way to pin the blame on the Traffic guys. At this point in their career, Can just had no idea what kind of band they wanted to be. They'd dabbled with dance rhythms for a little while by 1978, but Out of Reach finds them going deep into Latin disco rock territory. Now, understand something here: if someone described a band as ""Can doing Latin disco rock,"" I'd normally be all over it. The fact that these masters of space and precision decided to explore genres known for thick layers and elasticity is a beautiful thing. It just turns out that Can are not very good at Latin disco rock. At all. Actually, when it comes to the songwriting part of the equation, they're downright terrible. The attempt at a dance hit ""Pauper's Daughter and I"" has a tune so completely flat and lifeless, Rosko Gee's comically off-key vocals become a moot point. Honestly, it sounds like a song written by Eddy Grant's slow brother. Weak vocals also kill the otherwise-OK lite-rock fluff ""Give Me No Roses"", whose chorus contains Out of Reach's only successful hook. If ""Pauper's Daughter"" is inept, ""Like INOBE GOD"" is just weird, a kind of Latinized Calypso groove with the addition of an Abba-like studio sheen, all set underneath what sounds like drunken, improvised chanting. If you can forget for a moment that this is actually Can, ""Like INOBE GOD"" could be enjoyably imagined as a curious a private-press recording of a late-70s wedding band from San Diego. When they're not doing disco, Can displays what can only be described as overt Santana worship, and it's significant that Out of Reach is actually at its most satisfying when the band is in what Mark Prindle described as their ""Cantana"" mode. The high-energy ""Serpentine"" has some pretty cool percussion interplay between Liebezeit and Baah (on the disco cuts the mighty Jaki just sounds bored) and Karoli's wailing guitar in ""November"" has a sense of epic, widescreen drama. ""Seven Days Awake"" and ""One More Day"" are just bad 70s prog, ""experimental"" without any sense of playfulness or invention. The label claims that this reissue of Out of Reach has been remastered, but at points it sounds suspiciously like a vinyl transfer. Certainly, in addition to being Can's nadir it's also a career low for engineer Conny Plank. The mix just sounds off in so many places, like pieces recorded at different times just don't match up. Still, the difficutly in finding Out of Reach-- up to this point-- proves Can are trustworthy: they knew what they were doing holding this back.","When Can reissued their catalog on CD in the late '90s, one album was quietly left behind.

Stains on a Decade,Felt,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6e13d197565213b724/1:1/w_160/6626783f.jpg,2003-08-11 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3261-stains-on-a-decade/,Cherry Red,"Vic Godard was the leader of the Subway Sect, one of the earliest and most vibrant UK punk bands. He adhered to the idea of a musician doing what he or she wants, regardless of talent or precision and, along with Johnny Rotten, was the most strident believer in the idea that punk could, should, and would kill rock 'n' roll. Tom Verlaine was the leader of Television, one of the earliest and most vibrant U.S. punk bands. He was an ornate guitarist and expressive vocalist with a fondness for French symbolist poetry, complex arrangements, and lengthy solos. These two iconic, eccentric, and disparate performers were the unlikely catalysts for Felt, one of the most enduring and oft-overlooked bands of the 1980s. Over the course of 10 years, Felt released 10 singles and 10 albums, as planned by the band's offbeat leader Lawrence (née Hayward). Over the course of their lifetime, Felt were nearly always out of step with UK pop. When Felt started, they made glistening, reverb-heavy intricate pop while the rest of the underground was making either rhythmic and/or dark post-punk and the charts were full of clean, crisp New Pop. When shambolic, jangly, bedist indie became popular in the mid-80s, Felt was making Hammond organ-heavy pop/rock. Post-Acid House, Felt released a selection of cocktail jazz instrumentals á la Godard's own embrace of lounge music (Train Above the City) and a record of autumnal, organic beauty (Me and a Monkey on the Moon). Of course, they never reached a large audience. Between their shifting sounds and Lawrence's oblique lyrics, they often had a difficult time retaining even their core fans. In the years since, Felt hasn't been explored with the same ferocity as many of their contemporaries because they never had a single album that was settled on as their classic, as proof of their genius and a succinct argument for their legend. Yet between Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch placing multiple Felt references in his lyrics and liner notes and the band's sound apparent in artists such as the Sea and Cake and the Clientele, the group has, increasingly, become a chic name to drop. Felt's legacy was also heightened in recent years by the unavailability of many of their key records. This year, Cherry Red-- along with Creation, one of the two label's the band recorded for during its lifetime-- is redressing the situation with a full reissue campaign, re-releasing all 10 of Felt's albums, including the long out-of-print ones. To date, Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty and The Splendour of Fear have been released. Next week, Felt's Cherry Red classic The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories and Ignite the Seven Cannons will be issued, with the rest of the band's catalog to follow later in the year. The reissue campaign was kicked off with a collection of their best singles, b-sides, and EP tracks, Stains on a Decade, a rare compilation that serves both as the best introduction to a band's career and a vital addition to any fans' collection. Of the songs included-- all selected by Lawrence-- only two (""Primitive Painters"" and ""Dismantled King is Off the Throne"") are also featured on the band's albums. In all, Stains on a Decade includes 11 tracks that won't appear in any other form throughout Cherry Red's reissue campaign, and single versions of another two-- ""Fortune"" and ""Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow""-- that are slightly different (and an improvement over) their more well-known album renditions. In defense of the potentially superfluous tracks, no Felt singles collection would have been complete without ""Primitive Painters"", which features the Cocteau Twins' Elisabeth Fraser sharing vocals with Lawrence and fellow Twin Robin Guthrie as producer. It's an ambitious, shimmering, dramatic gem and is probably the band's best-known recording. ""Dismantled King Is Off the Throne"" is one of Lawrence's keenest balances of self-deprecating lyrics-- often expressions of hopelessness or fatalism colored by sheer boredom-- and original guitarist Maruice Deebank's sinewy work. ""Fortune"" is a relatively minimalist for the band's Deebank-era work, but it's haunting nonetheless. In their earliest days, Felt was characterized by Deebank's decorative playing and a near total lack of bass. Lawrence's flat, affected vocals and cultivated, fey, witty lyrics gave the band both a sense of feminity/androgyny and an air of sophistication, like the Smiths if they were informed by the fine arts rather than Shelagh Delaney plays and 60s rock. Instead of Marresque riffs, the classically trained Deebank was a virtuoso with virtually no knowledge of or concern for modern rock-- an ironic compression of Lawrence's twin musical fascinations (Godard and Verlaine). The seven tracks included here from that era are all near-perfect slices of delicate, multi-layered, cerebral pop. ""Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow"", the aforementioned ""Primitive Painters"" and ""Dismantled King Is Off the Throne"", and the dark, despairing ""Penelope Tree"" are lamented lost classics. Deebank eventually departed the band-- one of many lineup changes for what was essentially Lawrence's project-- in 1986. Stains' first post-Deebank track ""Ballad of the Band"" is an intriguing confession of the frustration and a curious revelation of the group's internal squabbles. Written as a reaction to Deebank's departure, Lawrence admits that ""I feel like giving in"" as he recounts the band's failed attempts at connecting with a wide audience and sarcastically blames himself for the group's lack of fame or money. After admonishing Deebank for his lack of commitment to the group and his hanging out with ""Jesus freaks,"" Lawrence airs he and Deebank's artistic differences by claiming: ""There's a place for abstract and there's a place for noise/ There's a place for every kind of sound."" To add further insult, the song is dominated by the Hammond of then-new member Martin Duffy (Primal Scream), whose musical contributions replaced Deebank's just prior to arguably the band's strongest LP, 1986's Forever Breathes the Lonely Word. Despite that album's success, the Creation selections on Stains of a Decade aren't as strong as the Cherry Red/Deebank ones. Still they're a welcome unearthing of some long largely unavailable tracks. The vibrant, Hammond-led ""I Will Die With My Head in My Hands"", bittersweet, acoustic ""There's No Such Thing As Victory"", and burbling synth-pop of ""Space Blues"" highlight the post-Deebank material. Despite Felt's internal struggles, the constant was Lawrence's lyrics and his search for a balance between reality and perception in the hope of discovering a life worth living. ""I hold out but there's no way of being what I want to be,"" he sighs on ""Primitive Painters"". ""You're trying much too hard to make your world seem like a dream"" Lawrence scolds on ""Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow"", but he's more often resigned to seeking a dream-like escape from his life and himself: ""I was lonely until I found the reason/ The reason was me."" With that sense of crippling self-deprecation-- sometimes delivered with a wink, other times with his head in his hands-- Lawrence's pop world wasn't always as inviting as his band's melodies suggested, but it remains captivating. More than a decade after splitting, Felt remains vital part of the UK's music history and an indie pop benchmark, and the vital Stains on a Decade, is the first Felt collection to include all of the group's unique twists and sounds. As the compilation's title suggests, Lawrence is still dabbling in irony and self-loathing in equal measure. Thankfully, though, some stains are permanent.","Vic Godard was the leader of the Subway Sect, one of the earliest and most vibrant UK punk bands. He ...

Tour de France Soundtracks,Kraftwerk,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1cea9e61561daa73cd/1:1/w_160/ab86f952.jpg,2003-08-11 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4556-tour-de-france-soundtracks/,Astralwerks,"After 1981's Computer World, Kraftwerk were anxious to begin work on their next LP. Perhaps spurred on by the warm reception (after a short of period of inactivity), Ralf Hutter, Florian Schneider, Karl Bartos and Wolfgang Flur set out working on a forthcoming album, to be titled Technopop. Technopop was to feature songs including its title track and ""Sex Object"", which would later surface on 1986's Electric Café. Its first single was to have been ""Tour de France"", and that track was in fact released in 1983. However, Technopop was not to be: due to a series of circumstances-- not least of which, Hutter's bicycle accident, which kept him out of serious action for the better part of a year-- the band decided to stretch their deadline, incorporate a few more state-of-1986 recording techniques (including, gasp, sampling) and concentrate their full length ideas on Electric Café. ""Tour de France""-- not a particularly classic entry in their singles catalog in the first place-- was left to drift into nothingness, and all was tidily swept under the mouse pad. But you know Kraftwerk have never been ones to let perfectly customizable data lay unaltered. From the time Hutter and Schneider hooked up in Düsseldorf in the late 60s to their heyday of the late 70s/early 80s and on through their complete catalog reworking (1991's The Mix), Kraftwerk have been a model of efficiently planned obsolescence. Taking a page from fellow tech-freak George Lucas (and Bill Gates for that matter), they don't even want to make their earliest releases available, making sure all client-side installations have been successfully updated to the most recent Kraftwerk sound. To their credit, Kraftwerk have a knack for emphasizing their best ideas, as almost all of their records from Autobahn until Computer World are dazzling specimens of the single-minded desire to progress, and the synergy of four pretty distinct individuals. What's more, they're pop. Unlike virtually any other band from the first wave of Krautrock, Kraftwerk produced music that worked as both experimental museum piece and a dancefloor (or living room) beacon. They are like the Beatles of electronic music: inspirations to NPR coffee talkers, crusty academic types and regular folks who just want to get robotic every now and again. So what a disappointment it must seem to witness the band rework ""Tour de France"" and slap a few new tracks down for their ""new"" LP, a soundtrack to the annual cycling event. I mean, in this fertile era for electronic music, when so many sounds seem ripe for the next revolution, you would think the godfathers of the genre would be serving up more than leftovers for our digital consumption. In fact, when the three-part ""Tour de France"" single was released earlier this year, many fans were disappointed: it would take more than modern tweaking to turn its thin melody and almost non-existent lyrical concerns (even for Kraftwerk) into something interesting. Bet step back-- perhaps surprisingly, Kraftwerk still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Their latest LP may not pack the same fortune-telling punch of their classic records, but it is nevertheless a distinctly engaging, sophisticated experience. And I think ""sophisticated"" is ultimately the perfect word for Kraftwerk, able to forge beautiful, instinctively appealing sounds out of mercilessly mechanical processes. After the short synth-driven ""Prologue"", the album begins with the title track, divided into three parts. ""Tour de France Etape 1"" starts as a fairly quick, light splash of microhouse featuring patented vocoder vocalizations stating the title, and various stages of the actual race. There really isn't a melody per se, except for a recurring synth line sounding not unlike one of the perky jingles used as the soundtrack for your computer booting up. ""Etape 2"" modifies the texture slightly, with flanged effects panning across the mix and subtle harmony vocals, but otherwise proceeds unchanged; ""Etape 3"" drops a glittery, arpeggiated synth figure to start, but soon returns to the main theme of the first section. All three pieces are clearly part of one large ""Tour de France"" mega-mix, and probably work best when you opt to appreciate the small details instead of looking for epiphanies in the beats or hooks. Things get a lot more active on the second half of the record, as tunes like ""Vitamin"" and ""Aero Dynamik""/""Titanium"" sparkle from the ever-pristine Kraftwerk polish. The latter tunes are practically perfect realizations of the power of a minimal, uncluttered mix of activity when you know how to highlight a beat (hint: they do). The calculated resonance of each percussive ping probably deserves its own article in a journal for electronic music, but we're free to just let them go by and by and by. ""Vitamin"" begins with an extroverted, constantly modulated synth line and fluttery, reverb-drenched chord cluster over which a patented Kraftwerk bot-beat runs its course. Similar to the title suite, the song works its magic via a repetitive power of persuasion, and also similarly features an optimistic, recurring melody. Perhaps the only really disappointing aspect of Tour de France-- beyond the still-not-that-great version of the title song (which ends the album)-- is that it emits a muted, comfortable aura rather than the immediately striking tone of their classic releases. In the end, that probably won't make much difference in your enjoyment of this music, but if first impressions are very important, it could be a potential turn-off for those expecting a return to Kraftwerk's trailblazing status. Sure, they might not ever be heads of the class again, but when you own the school, smart students will probably listen to what you have to say anyway.

Twice,The Tyde,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85b13d1975652139625/1:1/w_160/a7688d86.jpg,2003-08-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8230-twice/,Rough Trade,"Maybe it isn't entirely fair to handcuff records to weather patterns and seasons. Anyone who's ever synched up a Beach Boys track to a spitting blizzard gets that those kinds of temporal assignments can be awfully limiting, but there's something intensely beach-blanket/windows-down about Twice-- the Tyde's snarkily-titled follow-up to their 2001 debut Once-- that seems to make pigeonholing inevitable. Boasting all the smooth, amber glow of a Beachwood Sparks record (evidence three overlapping members), but hardly any of Beachwood's salty, shaking twang, Twice evokes only the clearest of deep, California skies, all crickets and moonlight, warm beer and bonfires, sticky fingers and splintering boardwalks. Pack it in a bag with your sandy beach towels and cracked goggles, surf wax and weed; dewy, power-popped, and properly hooked, Twice is culled from glossy picture postcards and cheap hotel rooms. It's forty minutes of straight summer soundtrack. Thematically, Twice marries the 60s psych-pop of Once with late-70s/early-80s cult jams, incorporating big nods to Felt and Television Personalities, relying less heavily on blatant homage to the Flying Burrito Brothers and Buffalo Springfield, and finding room for a single, victorious holler to the Velvets: ""Henry VIII"" finds frontman Darren Rademaker twisting his mouth into his best Lou Reed glower, shouting about the impossibility of life with/without drugs (""We just won't stop/ We don't stop/ Sometimes everybody needs a friend"") and layering thick, jangly guitars over spare, jumpy percussion. Rademaker's carefully effects-laden vocals occasionally sputter like a less pouty Julian Casablancas', deliberately retro but still intensely likeable, all lazy nuance and mellow sighs. There's not too much here to knock the sprinkles off your ice cream cone, but Twice is an impressively consistent and well- crafted collection: ""Best Intentions"" is five minutes of slow, artful meandering, languid and peaceably anchored by lilting guitar while ""Blood Brothers"" (despite the fairly wince-inducing lyric ""Do you want to know what it feels like to be a man?/ Try spending twenty-five years in a band"") is a rousing, organ-riddled salute to old- fashioned, back-slapping brotherhood. The Tyde have effectively shifted British post-punk from the dim, rainy streets of England to the broad, sunny avenues of California, trading vague melancholy for relaxed grins. Rhodes, piano, lap steel and synths add some interesting textures, but Twice still suffers from the predictability inherent in direct transplantation-- nearly every track can be quickly linked back to the artist or year that inspired it, and while the Tyde's contemporary re-interpretations are perfectly pleasant, they're not always compelling enough to let the shameless co-opting pass unnoticed. Like summer itself, Twice is peripheral, contingent upon the other eight months of the year for its bold existence, destined to be remembered, come autumn, as a fleeting, sweet, and delightfully innocuous burst of light.","Maybe it isn't entirely fair to handcuff records to weather patterns and seasons.

Beat Beat Heartbeat,The Natural History,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45213d197565213bf1b/1:1/w_160/23f427ed.jpg,2003-08-10 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5877-beat-beat-heartbeat/,StarTime,"The history of rock bands is littered with fossils of many that look just like this one: a bassist, a drummer, and a singing guitarist. Nothing more, nothing less. From the time when it was fashionable to call bands like Cream and the Hendrix Experience ""power trios"" through the 80s and 90s, when bands like Husker Du and Nirvana would have puked if you'd called them that, this efficient setup has bounced back and forth between the underground and the mainstream, trends permitting. These days, with the internet, file sharing, and instant word of mouth, there's hardly anything like an underground anymore, and just about everything is floating in some main stream or another, but the basic rock trio continues to prove that it's still possible to make a new recipe with the same exact ingredients people have been using for decades. The Natural History seem quite comfortable with their three-piece setup, easing through a lightning-quick batch of snappy American Britpop tunes on their debut album like they've been doing it for years. The threesome is currently reaping a whirlwind of positive association with the nebulous Yes New York thing, which isn't really a movement, but kind of feels like one anyway. They had a track on the flagship Yes New York compilation-- ""The Right Hand"", included here-- and they've turned up on Star Time International, one of several tastemaker labels to spring up near the mouth of the Hudson in recent years. Seems as though the table is set for the Natural History, and when folks get their ears on Beat Beat Heartbeat, chances are they'll dig right in. Really, there's almost nothing not to like here: punchy, semi-distorted guitars, memorable basslines, crisp drumming and vocals that sound a lot like Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys. Though the vocals are mixed too far down, and the production lacks the necessary pop to complement the band, this doesn't make the music any less invigorating. Guitarist/vocalist Max Tepper can't seem to get Wales and Southern England out of his larynx-- he's just the latest in a long, long line of Americans who just can't help singing in an accent that doesn't belong to them-- but it fits the bouncy songs he's singing so well, it feels almost natural. Four of these songs aren't even two minutes long, but I have to say I'm glad the album only clocks in a shade under 28 minutes, because the recording makes it too monochromatic to endure for much longer. Tepper's brother Julian anchors his stuttering guitar chords and wiry riffs with tastefully melodic basslines that occasionally make the difference between a boring song and a great one. ""Run de Run"" is a perfect example, Julian's line ricocheting off of Derek Vockens' strictly rhythmic drums for a feel that's a little bit Philly Soul, a little bit Disco Not Disco. ""Watch This House"" packs a ton of information into its minute and 43 seconds, with the guitar and bass moving in and out of step with each other while the drums stay utterly focused on the pocket. Max's falsetto may be the band's secret weapon, as his range helps make the melodies that much more memorable despite being hidden in the mix. ""Do What You Should"" and ""Hours of My Life"" are the best back-to-back illustration of the Natural History's range, the former droning on a nervous guitar and bubbling, tense bass line, while the latter swings full on into a swaggering guitar riff and blaring choruses packed with mad strumming and big drums fills. It's that range that will make the Natural History a great band in the future if they learn to explore it (and make a recording that's more sympathetic to it). Beat Beat Heartbeat is a fun, guileless debut from a band with obvious reference points that nonetheless sounds pretty distinct. Something tells me their next move will amaze us.","The history of rock bands is littered with fossils of many that look just like this one: a bassist, a ...

Kaospilot,Kaospilot,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1a13d197565213b240/1:1/w_160/0d15d559.jpg,2003-08-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4555-kaospilot/,Level Plane,"Despite the obvious aesthetic and musical differences between Kaospilot and their fellow black metal countrymen, I imagine an essentialized assortment of comparisons are made between this Norwegian hardcore quintet and those ghoulish guys with the corpsepaint and angelic sky-shattering guitar licks. Ask anyone from Seattle, Chapel Hill, or Olympia: regional associations are nearly impossible to shake once the international media pigeonholes you, oversimplifying and repackaging your otherwise multivalent scene. Of course there're more to Norway than black metal, ice and low crime rates, but outside of the internationally recognized Mayhem-and-Burzum-influenced genre, Norway's biggest commercial musical exports are A-Ha and the insipid Kings of Convenience. Neither is very loud, even if the latter want us to believe dull emotional folk passes as having some sort of resonant volume. Other international hitmakers Röyksopp and Secret Garden offer moments of ethereal prettiness that could theoretically bloom-- lopsided-- in late-period Emperor, but that's pushing things a bit. So who's a critic gonna namedrop if not Immortal, et al? More in the realm of Kaospilot's corpus is JR Ewing, a rattling post-hardcore band who released the excellent, sonically deconstructed Ride Paranoia on GSL a few months ago, but judging from Kaospilot's self-titled debut for Level-Plane, the band would rather consume American screamo's raw-throat yowling, quivering, utopian anarchy-lite lyrical animosity and cathartic slam-dance swizzle-stick breakdowns than take a nod from JR Ewing's inventive re-tooling of classic hardcore. Arming their fists with smashed bottles, Kaospilot sweats Orchid-styled rasp, lacking the seminal pre-Panthers band's ability to construct cogent political sound-bytes while cracking jokes about the Frankfurt School. Like far too many of their less interesting American hardcore counterparts, Kaospilot offer an unfocused agenda, spouting cliches about commodification, sexism, and oppressive governments without offering any possible solutions besides yelling and turning up the amps. Plowing through tortured scribbles buried in a consistent haze of distorted guitars, most of the eleven tracks are indistinguishable. One of the more interestingly unsuccessful song (""Akathisia"") raises an issue prevalent in black metal: ""What happened to our culture?"" Posing it as a larger, more universal query, the posit loses any specificity that could've otherwise turned it into an interesting diatribe. It jumps through so many cliched Crimethinc hoops, a cogent argument hasn't the space to breath a life of its own without getting restless leg syndrome and running out the door. ""Akathisia"" is the longest piece on the album, plodding for a seemingly interminable 4 whole minutes. When a dreamier moment introduces a break in the onslaught, with whispered female spoken word coupled with sporadic, echoey guitar strumming, the sonic room is appreciable, but unlike their black metal neighbors, when Kaospilot aren't going full-throttle (i.e. loud/soft/louder/soft/loudest/Jawbreaker coda), their musical attack is too one-dimensional and unnuanced to keep things interesting. With an approach this thin, it's all-all-all or just about nothing. To be fair, Kaospilot offers a tight and soaringly adequate battle cry for newly agitated punks who kick it suburban-style at the Warped Tour, but the band's arguments and approach are so overplayed I can't muster a reason to bother listening otherwise. Perhaps if they'd swallowed some of the previously mentioned Norwegian color and incorporated battles-of-the-north bombast and/or multi-note precision into their tedious second-hand approach, Kaospilot wouldn't sound like every boring American hardcore band recycling an already anesthetic past. It doesn't matter where you're from-- screaming white guys with unkempt hair and black pocket tees don't cut it anymore.","Despite the obvious aesthetic and musical differences between Kaospilot and their fellow black metal countrymen, I imagine an essentialized assortment ...

Mass Destruction,Curse of the Golden Vampire,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d5c0084474cd0c0a61/1:1/w_160/82acb0e7.gif,2003-08-10 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1717-mass-destruction/,Ipecac,"""Hi, friend, welcome to the neighborhood. As you may have noticed, these walls, ceilings and floors are very thin: when you drag your chair, play music early in the morning and late at night, you're waking up the neighbors. Please be considerate and limit these activities as much as possible. Thank you very much. --Neighbors."" At one point in time, this courteous yet curt note reminding me of my communal responsibilities would have sent me off the handle, provoking an immature retaliation of Modest Mouse's ""Paper Thin Walls"" followed by Björk's ""Army Of Me"" blared from ceiling to floor at the maximum volume my sleek, wood-grained speakers could muster. After all, why should I turn down the soothing 6am sound of the Buzzcocks and Pylon when the people below have a baby that screams and hollers at all hours, day and night? Oh sure, they can ask me to make concessions regarding the passions in my life, but if I were to go downstairs and tell the crying little bundle of joy to shutup, all of the sudden I'm the bad guy. Suppressing my urge for eviction, I eventually complied, and switched to low volume listening, saving up enough money for a decent set of headphones. But the notice came at a bad time, as sitting atop my stack of albums to be reviewed was the most recent Kevin Martin (Techno Animal, The Bug) and Justin Broadrick (Godflesh, Napalm Death) collaboration, under the working guise Curse of the Golden Vampire. Mass Destruction. Billed as an electronic melee of hardcore vocals adn hip-hop beats-- with refreshing genre names like ""Death Jungle"" and ""Scum 'n' Bass"" thoughtfully offered for my consideration-- I worried whether I would eventually have to critique the album from the point-of-view of my cramped and acoustically dry car in order to hear it properly. Fortunately, the Honda-experience wasn't necessary, as the muted apartment revealed a level of Mass Destruction I hadn't originally expected-- a low-key, rhythm-driven album with more to it than meets the ear. Though it's hidden beneath a layer of deceptively sloppy beats, the record displays a surprising amount of complex and-- for lack of a better description-- pleasant melodies intertwined between the hardcore vocals and fuzzed out bass. Dismissing off-hand the soon-to-be ebarrassingly dated political stabs-- including the coquettish ""The Myth of Democracy"" and ""United Snakes of America"", the Rogue State-influenced ""Oil Money"", ""State Rape"", and ""Manslaughter""-- the album stands atop a strong base of amalgamated genre-mashing, oft-times providing windows of inquisitive and novel exploration into the respective worlds of hardcore, jungle, and drum 'n' bass. ""Total Annihilation of Self"" begins the album on an incredibly strong foot, as repeated static notes give way to the hard drums and strong bass stomp of this techno meets hardcore track. Beneath a harrowing stream of vocal lacerations, the duo expertly control the breakdown of faux-horns and industrial racket, as moments of relative silence creep up occasionally, adding a sense of dynamic mood and tension. ""Parasite"" follows suit, initially relying on a straightforward guitar intro, but ultimately succumbing to a cyclical backbeat consistently augmented by whining high register noise and mobile electronic tones. If the latter pair of tracks derive their influence from the heavy hand of metal and hardcore, then ""Iron Ghetto"" is the direct product of the visceral beat and lyrical delivery of Ipecac label-mates and hip-hop revolutionaries Dälek. Over a dirty beat, the track focuses on the disintegration of structure nearly as much as it does the genesis, leaking break-beats and distorted vocals over the distorted canvas as if the pair of Martin and Broadrick was more concerned with the medium of their message than the context. ""Murderer"" continues this electronically-born leitmotif of anger and political respite with more ambient industrial noise high in the mix, as the influence of a less reflective SPK is detectable along with the buried musical authority of Alec Empire's former presence. Unfortunately, the multitude of ideas on Mass Destruction don't come to fruition in all regards, as a good portion of the disc slips into homogeneous sounds strongly influenced by the likes of Japanese noise artist Merzbow and/or depressingly obvious, disjointed genre collisions. While ""Mind Vs Body"", ""End Civilization"", and ""Insecticide"" all make strong use of a wide variety of influences-- from the dance-music of UK ""gare-redge"" to the free-jazz of Brötzmann's Machine Gun-- none of the tracks do so with any type of veiled seam, the stitches in their britches producing a glaring and uncomfortable break in the tracks, akin to watching your grandparents dance the Electric Slide at your cousin's wedding reception. Even with the benefit of musical interludes segueing the path in between such strongly disparate tracks, the schizophrenic nature of the album ultimately leaves a strong sense of awe and wonder as to why the creators couldn't endow the work with a greater sense of flow and unanimity. Despite this, Mass Destruction still comes across as a solid addition to the catalogue of both artists, a composition to be enjoyed on many levels, whether as adroit and patient background music or the confrontational, antagonistic screams of political mantra set to the hellish noise of the underground.","""Hi, friend, welcome to the neighborhood.

Steam Kodok: 26 A Go-Go Ultrarities from the Sixties Singapore and South-East Asia Underground,Various Artists,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8085e6ef959693210ff/1:1/w_160/17ef9fcd.gif,2003-08-10 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2023-steam-kodok-26-a-go-go-ultrarities-from-the-sixties-singapore-and-south-east-asia-underground/,Grey Past,"For the Grey Past imprint, ""a-go-go"" seems to encompass everything from beat to 50s soul to surf rock to psychedelia, and for this reason-- whether it's intentional or not-- Steam Kodok thankfully avoids a major pitfall many ethnic samplers plunge headlong into: all too often, the songs are so similar, it makes for a bloated and tedious compilation. Anyone aroused at the mere mention of 60s beat probably already owns Steam Kodok, but beyond its topical value, this compilation is a remarkable historical document of the effect rock music had on the rest of the world, particularly the East. Up until 1961, the South-East Asian scene was almost entirely instrumental; music was situational: culturally significant, but otherwise insignificant per se. As the Western influence crept in via the increasingly popular Beatles and, says Grey Past, a late 1961 concert by Cliff Richard and The Shadows, South-East Asia eschewed the musical collective and embraced the concept of the ""band""-- steady members, writing songs for their own entertainment. Beyond ""significance,"" though, these songs are utterly enjoyable. South-East Asian musicians were hardly big-budget pop stars, nor did they taut extensive rock pedigrees, and therein lies the charm of Steam Kodok: singers' voices are incongruous but delightfully honest, and the actual compositions-- though necessarily somewhat derivative-- have such a passion that even track 21's note-for-note aping of a Carlos Santana solo is forgiven. The positive energy of each song is just staggering-- Steam Kodok is the sound of a culture thrilled by the prospect of rock-and-roll, overjoyed and unable to stop smiling. ""Ali San"" starts things off appropriately, a lounge-y instrumental with an aching country-western melody traded back and forth between guitar and keyboard, haunted every so often by a bird-like flute trill. Steam Kodok aims to present a broad survey of the 60s a-go-go scene, and instrumental groups were the first among it; the Eastern flair of the song is immediately apparent, and perfectly encapsulates the worlds-collide motif to which Grey Past most certainly aspires. As the Singapore beat scene progressed, the singer became more than just an afterthought. Lyrically, there was a predicament: Malay and Chinese were national languages, but English was more popular, and its facility with metaphor certainly made it more conducive to rock-and-roll's quasi-poetry. Steam Kodok presents songs from these three very different traditions, each equally rewarding to English-speaking listeners. Regarding the Malay and Chinese lyrics, it is a rare chance to experience vocal melody without the distraction of semiotics (outside of scat singing, of course, whose spontaneity keeps it from achieving the same thoughtfulness of melody). We have no idea what the vocalist is singing in ""Ikan Todak"", for instance, but the very tenor of his voice conveys a level of playfulness so profound, words would have been entirely irrelevant anyway (""Ikan Todak"", incidentally, means ""swordfish""). What stands out most in the English-language cuts is their remarkable simplicity. We tend to think of 60s British and American beat lyrics as utterly quaint and simple-- how much simpler can you get than ""I want to hold your hand"" or ""You got me so I don't know what I'm doing""?-- but emotionally these are pretty complex. Wanting to hold someone's hand carries metaphorical baggage. A commitment is at hand, so to speak, and paradoxically, a larger physical gesture of love, like a kiss, does not mean nearly as much as a simple hand-hold. When Singapore's the Quests sing, ""You walk with me, you talk with me, and you dance with me,"" ""you'll be my bride,"" and ""I'll be your man,"" they intend no more than just what they say. There is no deeper significance, no implications-- the words are intended prima facie, and the honesty is hugely endearing. As I mentioned earlier, some melodies on Steam Kodok are taken directly from previous English renditions, with only the lyrics replaced or perhaps translated to the native language. These minor recontextualizations redeem their outplayed originals: anyone who has spent three seconds in a car with a radio has heard the Temptations' ""Get Ready"", and it's a good song, but many of us have tired of its reincarnations as family vacation sing-alongs. Over time, it seems songs like ""Get Ready"" function more as part of a social fabric than they do as songs themselves-- the thought of coming back from work and listening to some old Temptations records doesn't appeal to me at any rate. ""Bersedia""-- the Malaysian version of ""Get Ready"" by Ismail Haron & The Guys-- differs from the original only in choice of language, but the variation avails an opportunity to appreciate the song's fantastic melody and snare-on-one backbeat, the elements that made ""Get Ready"" an immediate classic in the first place. Steam Kodok is doubly redemptive, in this sense: on one hand, it rescues otherwise forgotten moments in a rich 60s South-East underground culture; on the other, it makes relevant again our own rich musical history, which we rarely consider on a strictly aesthetic level. Beyond the thought that informed this carefully considered compilation, what fascinates me even more is how powerful of an artform rock-and-roll had become, especially so early in its lifetime. Freedome, fame, fun...it was immediately relevant to so many different cultures. The genre, as Steam Kodok's very existence would suggest, was instantly politicized, and theretofore has brought together otherwise completely dissimilar cultures, each enchanted by the possibility of creating something that might transcend petty but very real social differences that keep us apart.

Fried My Little Brains EP,The Kills,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb97abf31b7dc7155b12/1:1/w_160/2fa72174.jpg,2003-08-07 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4425-fried-my-little-brains-ep/,Rough Trade,"Remember when forming a band meant tacking up a badly-xeroxed ""Bass Player Wanted!"" flier next to the cash box at your local record store, complete with a repeatedly revised list of ""pivotal"" influences and some superfluous exclamation points at the bottom? Turns out there are new, fancy ways to get a group together: garage-blues duo the Kills are the unlikely result of a heated cross- Atlantic cassette correspondence between British instrumentalist Hotel and American vocalist VV, and all the head-scratching quirks of their bizarre formative circumstances (Hotel? VV? Florida to London?) are perfectly communicated in the quasi-desperate nuance of their smarmy guitar-and-drums tunes. The Fried My Little Brains EP-- a three-song companion piece to the Kills' full-length debut Keep On Your Mean Side-- is as reckless and unexpected as the Kills themselves, with all the lonely, awkward distance of a tape-by- tape, multi-national, air-mail band rehearsal. VV might have eventually relocated to London to facilitate their songwriting process, but the cold, sleeping-alone separation of their start still lingers here. Clocking in at a twitch over two minutes and featuring a single sinister, foot-pounding blues riff, ""Fried My Little Brains"" can be a semi-befuddling single/EP choice, considering that Keep On Your Mean Side also houses some significantly more dynamic (and longer) cuts-- but it's still a reeling, addictively cocky stomp, with full boy-girl harmonies and steady, minimalist percussion. VV and Hotel's repetitive hollers (""Won't move over/ Won't get gone/ Won't move over/ Fried my little brains"") play like disinterested whines, childish despite their illicit connotations-- their half-hearted yelps capture, expertly, the bored, numbing part of being young and druggy. B-side ""Jewel Thief"" hollers back to the spirit of the band's Black Rooster EP, with its churning, lo-fi blurriness, frenzied acoustic strumming, and typewriter-tap drumming. Less blatantly Delta-loving, ""Jewel Thief"" is a welcome counterpoint to the determinably garage-based blues noodlerisms that make Keep On occasionally sag; sexy and playful, ""Jewel Thief"" is mischievous and surprisingly light. Closer ""Sugar Baby"" is a shifty, fuzz-heavy Dock Boggs cover-- although Boggs' Kentucky-coal-miner-gone-Lonesome-Ace-barn- dancer twang is conspicuously absent, as is his beloved banjo strum-- thick with the kind of contemporary ambivalence that would, presumably, effectively exclude it from any future American Folk Music anthologies. Overall, something about VV's disembodied howl can be unnervingly empty, and her perpetually blank-faced detachment is what keeps the Kills' sound distinctly theirs, despite a bunch of otherwise apt comparisons to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O. Appropriate or not, it's still an interesting parallel: as a vocalist, O. is an intensely palpable performer, a raw, busted-up, writhing mess that, for all her predetermined posturing, feels extraordinarily actual to an audience. No matter how far back you're crouching at a Yeah Yeah Yeahs show, you're gonna get hit with the thick, sour smell of intentionally dribbled beer, feel O.'s half-drunk kicks and punches, hear her frantic gasps for air-- inevitably, fans are assailed, sometimes mercilessly, by all the peripheral quirks of a woman who's occupying her voice. With the Kills, what kills is how remote and distracted VV sounds, and how tense her absence is in the context of Hotel's fiery guitar slamming. But the conflict works-- the pair make oddly compelling partners, and Fried My Little Brains is, at less than ten minutes long, a nicely jarring burst.","Remember when forming a band meant tacking up a badly-xeroxed ""Bass Player Wanted!"" flier next to the cash box at ...

In the Jungle Groove,James Brown,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c0b1335d7bf16987ca/1:1/w_160/b619bff6.jpg,2003-08-07 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/974-in-the-jungle-groove/,Polydor,"James Brown turned 70 this year, and while most great-grandparents are settling down on their lake house patio, or complaining about the nursing home food, last I heard, James was busy scaring the shit out of solicitors at his South Carolina home. With that in mind, it's good to know his legacy and legend are in safe keeping via his music, and the myriad compilations detailing the facets of his genius. In the Jungle Groove was originally issued in 1986, just as interest in Brown's backbeats reawakened via the power of sampling in hip-hop, and cut for cut, it's in the highest category of Brown compilations, standing tall alongside any of his greatest hits sets (and even the Star Time box). It's not that it necessarily covers a lot of ground, or even gives a good overall view of Brown's career-- because it really only spans a short period from late 1969 until mid 1971, with a bonus track from 1972 added for this reissue-- but those years were particularly fertile, and this set nails them. The early 70s is generally viewed as Brown's last really great period, but it's not without problems. For starters, his band underwent two complete overhauls: after working with the same basic core since about 1964 (with minor fluctuations as during Maceo and Melvin Parker's military stints), mutiny reared its ugly head in the spring of 1970. With trombonist Fred Wesley checking out to L.A., Maceo took his ball and the rest of the band and went on the road his own damn self. Without anyone to back him, Brown was in dire straights-- that is until right hand man Bobby Byrd called long-distance to the Cincinnati residence of William (""Bootsy"") and Phelps Collins. Along with longtime associate Sir Clyde Stubblefield, the new groove was formed, and dubbed the JB's. That is, until Bootsy started having horrific acid experiences onstage, and fell out with Brown in the process. When Wesley returned, and regulars like St. Clair Pinckney and John ""Jabo"" Starks climbed back onboard, the JB's were officially retooled and managed to stick it out until the mid-70s. Hardest working men in show business, indeed. In the Jungle Groove runs through all of that via ten pretty amazing tracks that manage to sound like one huge break despite the clamor behind the scenes. ""It's A New Day"" leads things off on a particularly upbeat note, even for these guys. Brown makes his case for letting ""the girls know what they can do for us"" before Jimmy Nolen drops a very funky Stax-esque guitar lick and the horns hit their thing. When the drums come in and the handclaps slap, I do believe the portion of cosmos located right above my house is aligned. We're one song in, and the fucking cosmos is aligned. ""Can I get a witness?"" By all means, and then serve up ""Funky Drummer"". Of all the songs here, ""Funky Drummer"" is easily the most heard, even if only for Stubblefield's still-unholy-after-all-these-years break. What's not so known is the understated, but cutting solo by Maceo and Brown's own wildly unhinged organ touches. The Bootsy years are represented by a very hot remix of ""Give It Up or Turn It Loose"", ""I Got to Move"", ""Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing"", ""Get Up, Get Into It and Get Involved"" and ""Soul Power"". ""Give It Up"" in particular stands out, thanks to the whiplash sound of Stubblefield's drums and Bootsy's restless, but tight bass lines. There's a break in the middle where the band drops out and only Brown's orders to ""clap your hands, stomp your feet"" and Johnny Griggs' congas are keeping the beat alive. When Brown gives the signal (""Clyde!""), and the drums re-enter, dollars to donuts you're out the window with funky joy (or calling for the Neptunes' heads for their complete rip of this trick-- ""drums!""-- for Justin Timberlake, of all people). ""Talkin' Loud"" also gets a new shine via the remix treatment, as the golden tag team of Stubblefield, Collins and Nolen get their rocks off and then some. James Brown isn't really the kind of artist who needs his stuff beefed up, but here it only serves to make a very good thing harder and hotter. The final track is the previously unreleased, extended version of ""Blind Man Can See It"", originally a part of Brown's soundtrack to the blaxploitation flick Black Caesar. Jabo Starks keeps everything very much in the pocket here, as Brown is content to run amok off-mic around the studio. The mostly-instrumental jam keeps fairly calm (and the Rhodes asides are key), and if not for Nolen's rampantly sampled guitar line and Brown's ending soliloquy lamenting the lack of gigs around, this could probably pass for straight ahead acid-jazz funkateering. It's perhaps not in the same stratospheric pantheon as other cuts on the set, but like pretty much everything Brown did during this time, it gets the job done easily. There are a few very good compilations available covering Brown's pure funk period: besides this one, be sure to check out the James Brown's Funky People series, Funk Power 1970, Make It Funky: The Big Payback and the two-disc JB's anthology. All of them are incredible, and emphasize slightly different aspects of his (and his band's) music from the late 60s and early 70s. However, times are tight, and if you only have room for one on your shelf, you couldn't do much better than this CD. Cliff White had it right 17 years ago, and he has it right now: this ain't for the faint hearted. This is the jungle groove.","James Brown turned 70 this year, and while most great-grandparents are settling down on their lake house patio, or complaining ...

Lovers,The Sleepy Jackson,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62e5e6ef95969320c8f/1:1/w_160/777a8c26.jpg,2003-08-07 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7698-lovers/,Astralwerks,"I don't know if this is Beck's fault or just a result of the overall dearth of any original ideas in rock, but too many artists are getting not only free passes but jubilant praise for merely doing lots of different things pretty well. Beck's heir apparent in the eclecticism-masking-as-bursting-with-creative-energy lineage was Badly Drawn Boy, but the charm that burst from the stocking-capped one's early EPs-- and occasionally raised its head on The Hour of the Bewliderbeast-- quickly settled into a stench of MOR tunes framed by tired honest, busker ethics. Other FM dial-skimmers are worse: The Dandy Warhols are practically a bar cover band; Ryan Adams has even gone so far as to appropriate all of the obnoxious trappings of how a Rock Star is supposed to act; the Vines sound like a condensation of the contents of a typical issue of Q magazine. Are these guys any more interesting than specific necrophiliacs like the Thrills or Kings of Leon or Black Rebel Motorcycle Club? Not really, but their failing to be succeed in multiple different ways creates the illusion that they're actually offering something interesting. More to the point: are Australia's the Sleepy Jackson any different? Well, almost. With a capacity to write winning choruses and graceful sinewy guitar lines, the Sleepy Jackson's Luke Steele is a more than capable tunesmith, but one too often pleased with compounding his rustic pop core with restless, offputting eccentricity (including lamentable stabs at the offbeat such as a single child-like voice over plink-plonk piano on ""Morning Bird"" and the gothic spoken-word bore ""Fill Me With Apples""). I'm not the least bit surprised this is getting good reviews from the British press. For the past, say, five years or so, the NME and the monthlies seem to make time for anything that fits the romantic notion of America as an expansive sometimes untamed land, any record that embodies California's slow sun-kissed pace, the grandiosity of Big Sky country and its endless horizon, or the twang of the open trail. In the hands of Mercury Rev, Lambchop, or the Flaming Lips that's frequently been a good thing, but many of their contemporaries (Grandaddy, the Polyphonic Spree, Giant Sand, Beachwood Sparks, most of the Americana bands that get fellated in Uncut) don't do much to inspire. These are the sorts of styles between which Sleepy Jackson's Luke Steele flits, but the more stereotypically American he seems, the worse the result. Outsiders borrowing elements of a specific sound can result in some charming mis-readings or clever interpretations/spins on classic formulas, but where the Sleepy Jackson try to swing open the saloon doors they merely end up walking on steakhouse-floor peanut shells. It's a shame, because the brooding ""Don't You Know""-- with a ""Rock On""-style electro-gurgle stalking the tune's perimeter while a generally restrained choral voice and string lines fills its baroque center-- demonstrates a tasteful balance between what Steele does best: Deceptively direct tunes delicately layered with ornate production and instrumentation. The best results of that formula are a pair of leftovers from a series of EPs the band recorded over the past couple of years, ""Good Dancers""-- a deadringer for John Lennon's ""#9 Dream""-- and ""This Day"", which is proof that Steele is as familiar with fellow Aussie Grant McLennan (the Go-Betweens) he is with George Harrison (who is surely the record's patron saint). In other spots the results are a bit more mixed, but there are still a handful of things worth savoring; new single ""Vampire Racecourse"" is a decent faux-glam stomper, and ""Rain Falls For Wind"" is a great summer night track, but it's one you won't remember in the morning. The jangly ""Come to This"" is only a reminder that Tom Petty actually wrote a decent tune or two before becoming a fulltime curmudgeon spouting insightful ""rap is crap""-style witticisms on VH1 and in Rolling Stone. If his eccentricity was tamed and the pained attempts to hop genres were avoided, Luke Steele could just produce something close to sublime. As it stands, Lovers is a fairly pleasant application of some charming reference points, but please, let's stop pretending that that's good enough.","I don't know if this is Beck's fault or just a result of the overall dearth of any ...

Reconstruction Site,The Weakerthans,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9dc9d034d5c69bf3d1f/1:1/w_160/e199ad79.jpg,2003-08-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8593-reconstruction-site/,Epitaph,"It's not the music that's the most notable aspect of Reconstruction Site, the third full length from sensitive Canadian rockers The Weakerthans: it's the album art, by fellow Winnipegian Marcel Dzama. His absurdist root-beer watercolors connect the quartet to an idiosyncratic landscape inhabited by reclining bears, drably dressed doppelgangers, and people in red without torsos; across the tan expanse, two inscrutable nurses and a guy in a bear suit observe this nap time-cum-mass suicide. Since the mid 90s, this punk-rock Joseph Cornell's tiny drawings of dancing trees, angry deer, fatuous alligators, bloody frogs, worrisome amputees, violent elves, and other damaged, often armed characters have accumulated like snow, forming an obsessive cosmology built upon dusty bookstore ephemera. Unfortunately, The Weakerthans' by-the-books music isn't nearly as captivating. Known mostly as a gentler post-Propagandhi project, The Weakerthans are fronted by John K. Samson, who during his five years with the left-wing jokesters contributed the bratty pop filler to the band's enjoyably cartoonish agenda. If you were to expand those bits about preteen McCarthyism and Southern Manitoba into an entire pop album, make 'em a bit alt-country, and add a a few more literary references-- say, an icy dinner with a Derrida-toting Michel Foucault, and a song named after a Martin Amis novel in which time plays out backwards-- you'd have a good idea what Reconstruction Site is all about. Though their critical framework is stuck in the 80s (come on, Scritti Politti did ""Jacques Derrida"" in '82!) the intellectual smarminess is good for a shiny poetic moment here and there. ""(Manifest)"" sports one of my favorite album-opening lines in recent memory; though the song itself implodes along the fault lines of its own cleverness, the distance and intimacy is admirable: ""I want to call requests through heating-vents/ And hear them answered with a whisper, 'No.'"" Aside from a couple other fine one-liners and the soaring trumpet by guest player Rusty Matys, the song's pretty tired. The chords and vocal line show up twice more, with slight variations, as ""(Hospital Vespers)"" and ""(Past-Due)"", the latter drenched in John Berger's Ways Of Seeing: ""February always finds you folding local papers open to the faces 'passed away'/ To wonder what they're holding in those hands we're never shown/ The places formal photographs refuse to mention."" The venerable Greek Chorus, notions of difference/repetition, and communication theory are noted, but if one track is unremarkable the first time around, it just grows irksome thrice! Word? And there are lower points than that triad: the title track sounds like Smash Mouth, ""Time's Arrow""-- the Amis song-- is reminiscent of lightweight All About Chad or some other adolescent twee crud from the mid 90s, and the last third of the album sounds like absolutely nothing at all (which is remarkable in and of itself). On the plus side, Samson pens lyrics from the point-of-view of a cynical cat-- ""Plea From A Cat Named Virtue""-- and both ""The Reasons"" and the French-inflected ""Our Retired Explorer (Dines With Michel Foucault In Paris, 1961)"" would make finely catchy radio singles for fans of faux-Weezer geek rock. It's also fun discovering well-wrought nuggets amid the dross: lines like ""tune the FM in to static, and pretend that it's the sea""-- from the James-Agree referential ""The Prescience of Dawn""-- are fine flourishes for aesthetes and pop romantics alike. Throughout it's fourteen tracks, there's no doubting The Weakerthans are smart guys who keep up with literature and politics, but over the course of an entire album the band's ambitious literary posturing drowns in the bland songwriting and lack of captivating hooks. Perhaps best consumed as a single between Built to Spill and Dismemberment Plan on some smarmy Ivy League college radio show, The Weakerthans need less talk and a lot more pop in their formula. With their soundtrack, I'd much rather read the book.","It's not the music that's the most notable aspect of Reconstruction Site, the third full length from sensitive ...

Solid Guild,The Joggers,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1c7eb335119a49ed60c/1:1/w_160/00853697.jpg,2003-08-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4335-solid-guild/,StarTime,"Four-man harmony used to be the exclusive terrain of barbershop quartets and pimply junior high choral practices-- until it transformed into a secret weapon of sorts for contemporary bands trying their pitch-pipe best to channel some kind of Brian Wilson, surf-rock thing. Either way, it's an ambitious, if inherently plucky proposition; outside of elementary schools and churches, misused four-part harmony can be deeply embarrassing in a gruesome, tingly way, all awkward, straining notes and graceless synchronization, missed beats and screechy climaxes. Given the context, it's possible that the Joggers have just four-handedly manned a vocal revolution. On Solid Guild, the former members of Stateside see their round, puppy-dog warbles coalescing into quirky, unexpected four-part harmonies inspired, supposedly, by the shape-note (or sacred harp) traditions of the late eighteenth-century, an inclusive vocal system devised to make group hymn singing possible for folks who couldn't otherwise read music (written notes are assigned one of four different shapes; participating singers arrange themselves in a circle or square, facing inward, and perform a capella.) For Solid Guild, the four Joggers airlift the shape-note process from the deep and dirty American south, setting it down on the comparably tidy streets of Portland, Oregon, and transplanting their resulting harmonies into perfectly contemporary punk rock songs. The idea of deliberately co-opting a semi-obscure, southern hymn-howling convention might seem unbearably pretentious on paper, but it's an entirely different monster in practice-- dynamic and heavily textured, there's a bare-boned, unfiltered honesty to the Joggers' yelps that should dissuade ill-willed naysayers and gospel purists. Truthful and energized, the Joggers' anachronistic harmonies offer an airy counterpoint to their prickly, arrow-slinging guitars and sharp, every-man-for-himself riffing-- rather than bogging these songs down, they somehow open them up. ""Back To The Future"" leads with mischievous guitar interplay, axmen Murphy Kasiewicz and Ben Whitesides antagonizing each other via an echo-and-build exchange before drums curl in and all four voices pipe up enthusiastically, pointing in different directions-- eventually, they lose the instruments all together, their broad, scrappy wails going unaccompanied, lyrics unintelligible, trills popping up and down, attacking from all angles. It's an engaging moment, and the Joggers periodically employ this type of clearinghouse trick, pushing their punchy instrumentation aside in favor of sharp vocal breakdowns. ""Neon Undercarriage,"" an otherwise Strokes-ish garage romp, sees its perky guitar hook interrupted by a stand-alone slap of harmony, this one abstract and convoluted enough to function, successfully, as its own kind of four-man instrument. Keep in mind that vocals aren't the only shots being fired: most of Solid Guild plays like a big, well-choreographed skirmish, with Kasiewicz's and Whitesides' guitars darting and tumbling, wrestling and pinning each other down, Jake Morris' punchy drums piping up, slotting in raucous fills where you'd least expect them, and Darrell Bourque's persistent bass stringing all the disparate parts back together, sort of. It's a huge, exhilarated mess, a clash of sounds, starts, and stops that's nearly impossible to chart; traditional notions of synchronicity aren't relevant, and nobody's doing the same thing at the same time. They might be necessarily complex, but the Joggers' compositions aren't sloppy, impenetrable, or gratuitously harried-- it's just rich, purposefully disjointed fun, entirely cringe-less and consistently surprising. All without the matching vests.","Four-man harmony used to be the exclusive terrain of barbershop quartets and pimply junior high choral practices-- until it transformed ...

It's Not Up to Us,Byard Lancaster,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb7abf31b7dc7155feb/1:1/w_160/22e0fcca.jpg,2003-08-06 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4944-its-not-up-to-us/,WaterVortex,"When John Coltrane succumbed to cancer in 1967, free jazz/fire music was sucked into a giant vacuum along with him. A patron of music and patron saint to so many of its players, there was a crossroads left in his wake. Electric instrumentation was slowly seeping in from one side, and with it, its rockist and studio-manipulated pleasures. Miles Davis employed electric keyboards, punched in solos and seamlessly edited tracks in this era, and is an obvious example, as are folks like Eddie Harris and Charles Lloyd, who were similarly amplifying and opening for rock groups at the Fillmore West. The other route was to take the music even further out into the cosmos, as Albert Ayler did with his inner-being blues holler or the Art Ensemble of Chicago, with their Pan-African extrapolations into the primal unknown. Few attempts were made fto find a middle ground though, that could mingle jazz with rock, or free-playing in a more palatable pop manner without falling victim to the later Fusion craze. Or at least so I thought, until coming across this Byard Lancaster reissue of his debut recording as band leader. What strikes me first is the overall melodic sensibility of each of the players. Lancaster, on alto sax and flute, would go on to play with outsider luminaries like Sun Ra, Bill Dixon, and Fred Hopkins. Sharrock's violently strummed strings on Black Woman and Monkey Pockie-Boo led to the vortices of Sonic Youth, Fugazi, and pretty much all future physical guitarists. Eric Gravatt would soon join an early version of Weather Report, yet everyone defers their skronkier, unrestrained abilities to the overall structure of each tune. This gives the Anglo folk base of some of Lancaster's compositions plenty room to be heard and hummed. Even moodier pieces like ""Last Summer"" move smoothly as panther haunches, Sharrock's playing clean and lissome over the slowly bowed, bassy sinews of Jerome Hunter as the band tenses and glides about the flute line. ""John's Children""-- an overt reference to their own state as post-Coltrane players-- has the undulating modal walk of a Jimmy Garrison bassline, incessantly prying open the infinite portal as Byard cries down into the void. The horn's palpable ""space"" is coated by producer Joel Dorn with enough reverb as to make his alto sound as if its emitted from the recesses of a cave, the guitar, congas, and cymbals a dizzying whirlwind of bats about him. Lancaster trills along with Sonny's humming bumblebee blurs and stinging single-string tones in their homage to Ayler, ""Mr. A.A."" The chord progressions are the most rock-sounding I've cmoe across from this era of jazz, and the pan-pipe flits that the flute elicits echo not only Henry ""Ragtime"" Thomas but the contemporary Canned Heat update ""Goin' Up Country"". The flute that tweets over the stomp of ""Dogtown"" recollects those weird Herbie Mann records that had Sharrock on them and its conga-clapped coda is a real sign of the studio's presence, as the tape speeds the hits into a blur, dropping us into the stunning rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"". Lancaster's take would be noteworthy enough, but it's the way certain notes are bandied about, held in space by Dorn over the deep bass gurgle, that creates dozens of little whirls within the song, the melody expanded but the fabric never shredded. After such a poignant solo turn, it seems the nine-minute closer has him there in presence only, and it's just the guitar-bass-drum trio that fully imbibes this dynamic, heavily breathing dark music, heaving like tides in the deepest night. Not surprisingly, it's entitled ""Satan"", an unsettling way to end this singular jazz session.","When John Coltrane succumbed to cancer in 1967, free jazz/fire music was sucked into a giant vacuum along with ...

Just as rock of the independent variety had fans, writers, and PR employees shoving twee-ness like East River Pipe into the same overfilled nook with rabid madmen like the Jesus Lizard, so would the E word attempt to cover more musical ground than one might consider reasonable. A quick check of fourfa.com (a noble attempt to make sense of this madness) would have visitors believe that just about anything from Rites Of Spring to Cap'n Jazz to even The Strokes qualifies as-- OK, I'll say it-- emo. That's a lot of area to lay claim to, and it does little more than turn that E word into a mutt-like descriptor-- the term refers to so many things, it ends up referring to nothing. That doesn't do a group like the Jealous Sound any favors. In its current configuration, The Jealous Sound features former members of Knapsack, Sunday's Best, Jawbox and Shudder to Think (those last 2 groups are part of the litany thanks to drummer Adam Wade, but Wade didn't even drum on this record). In this instance, the key precedent to take note of is Knapsack-- that's the voice of former backpacker Blair Shehan singing lines like ""There was a guy/ Making a plan/ Find a girl/ And she'd understand."" Yeah, yeah, you think you know the drill-- MORE silly love songs?-- but then Shehan offers less obvious lines like, ""Did you manage to forget / Did you tie the tourniquet?/ Forgive me for gushing."" This is a cloyingly clever sample, but Shehan's decision to err on this side rather than on the clichéd and plainspoken ""he said moon/ she said June\x94 side does the record a world of good. Where these words might once have found themselves attached to a voice prone to tortured yelping and pre-pubescent cracking, they're now delivered by a raspy croak not too dissimilar from something off a Replacements record. Haters might want to point to the Goo Goo Dolls instead-- it's all about the indie cred with some folks-- but both comparisons would be equally appropriate. There's enough of a down-to-earth rock vibe on this record to keep the more mawkish moments from becoming overbearing. Besides, if you're already fond of the Superchunky basslines and synth blubbery on Kill Them With Kindness, it's doubtful that a little thing like who the singer sounds like will keep you from enjoying it. And this actually is an enjoyable record-- a solid set of rock songs that hovers somewhere between the professionalism of Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American and your favorite slice of homegrown emotion. This assumes, of course, that you have an affinity for this stuff. If the thought of a band performing this heartfelt guitar-centric safety dance for a bunch of Doc Marteneers makes you want to shave your head and talk to yourself in mirrors, then please leave the Jealous Sound be and let me introduce you to a group of earnest young men calling themselves Dashboard Confessional.","Nowhere is the futility of kitchen magnet pigeonholing more apparent than in that lovable subsection of popular music commonly referred ...

Love and Easy Living,Central Falls,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56cb1335d7bf1698bc6/1:1/w_160/a5b544d1.jpg,2003-08-06 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1375-love-and-easy-living/,Truckstop,"Call me crazy, but I'm fairly certain that this album title's two constituent parts are mutually exclusive. In my own experience anyway, love-- even relatively simple love-- always complicates things. Easy living really requires a lack of commitments, not to mention a lack of consequences for taking it easy all the time (i.e. no asking why the garbage didn't go out or why the phone remained silent even as the clock ticked past 1:00 am). Being in love isn't bad, of course, it's just not easy. But then again, I guess Love or Easy Living doesn't quite have the same ring to it. Central Falls turn the Easy Living half of the title into an outright Gershwin reference just as the record kicks off. The clean, wispy guitars take a quick pass at the opening progression and melody to old George's classic ""Summertime"" before wandering off into the haze where they spend the rest of the album. The song is even called ""Springtime""-- get it? Of course you do, but don't expect any more music dork humor ahead, because the Chicago boys in Central Falls play it pretty straight from there on out-- Love and Easy Living's overarching vibe is one of a sad, sultry summer, and its tone keeps making me slip and call it Love and Easy Listening. The two major players in this whole Central Falls conspiracy are brothers Ben and Adam Vida, who all good scenesters know from their respective other bands, Town & Country and U.S. Maple. A word of caution: don't go looking for any traces of U.S. Maple in Central Falls, because there aren't any-- Adam Vida spends his time behind the kit in U.S. Maple banging out anti-rhythms while his mates explode and melt around him, offering answers to the question ""what happens when rock collapses?"" Here, he hands the sticks over to Jason Adasiewicz, a skilled skinsman who's made the rounds in the Windy City post-rock scene, and who sticks rather politely to steadfast, simple rhythm and the occasional Nick Mason fill. Adasiewicz is mixed too low on ""Springtime""-- so low, in fact, that you can't hear him until you turn it up quite loud, which is a problem, because the meditative guitar parts need his guiding push in order to sound like anything other than soup. When you boost the volume though, the song's lilt and bounce work pretty nicely-- the larynx of a Vida is typically given to a smooth tenor croon that blends nicely with a crisp electric guitar and a Hammond-- and the brothers harmonize well, though they don't exactly bring to mind anyone named Wilson. As is frequently the case with albums that have more to offer in texture than melody, though, things bleed together like watercolors, and longer songs like ""The Fights Are Staged"" are inevitably marooned in the ""Is this still the same song?"" maze that so many albums get lost in. Still, ""Weekenders"" rises above with a fine horn arrangement and a rather affecting refrain of ""Weekenders, you fuck off/ I am here forever,"" which could be an anthemic sentiment for any number of folks, from resort town natives to kids manning registers on a Saturday evening. If nothing else, Central Falls have improved appreciably on their even more diffuse debut, and crafted a fine album for folks whose seasonal affective disorders kick in halfway through July (perhaps Red Sox and Cubs fans?). There's more dynamic tension here, exemplified in the shifting rhythms and jazzbo guitar of ""Covered Below"" and the toothy horn part to ""Morning Sky"". Really, tighter melodies are all Central Falls need to put a record in your face, instead of on the periphery, but as wallpaper goes, Love and Easy Living is good stuff, well mounted.","Call me crazy, but I'm fairly certain that this album title's two constituent parts are mutually exclusive.

So Stylistic,Fannypack,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6babf31b7dc7156145/1:1/w_160/c0805b2b.jpg,2003-08-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3259-so-stylistic/,Tommy BoyFamous Celebrity,"Assuming your schedule isn't overfilled with important stuff like laundry, oil changes, and overtime, chances are you've heard-- or more likely heard about-- Fannypack's ""Cameltoe"". It's half-smash, half-novelty; its tight cartoon booty-beat leaps out of car speakers like a G-rated ""Me So Horny"", but its radio play has more to do with the two teenage girls dropping lines like ""Is your crotch hungry, girl?/ Cause it's eating your pants."" But we are not going to talk about ""Cameltoe"", which turns out to be one of the less interesting tracks on the full-length So Stylistic (most interesting: ""Hey Mami"", which we'll get to in a second). Instead, we will review the story-so-far of Fannypack, and then I will explain why I might be mining this little collection for mix-tape fodder pretty heavily over the coming weeks. The Fannypack concept comes from a couple of DJs-- Matt Goias and ""Fancy""-- who got frustrated with the big beats-per-minute gulf between danceable house and slow-loping hip-hop hits, which please crowds but aren't as good for working up a sweat. Their go-getting solution to this problem is an intuitive mash-up of a few things: rumpshaker club hip-hop of the booty-bouncing, system-rattling kind (it doesn't get made much anymore); the clean-lined robotic twitching of old-school electro breakdance tracks, and the straighter rush and careful production of house and techno. All of which makes it sound a million times more complicated than it really is, but the fact that this stuff can be so straightforward and yet naggingly unique is its biggest gift: critics have hemmed and hawed about it and mostly just agreed that it reminds them of L'Trimm's memorable one-hit ""Cars with the Boom"". Which brings us up to the next part. L'Trimm's Bunny and Tigra were two very young girls in snappy outfits who didn't rhyme so much as talk and preen and be awesome; Goias and Fancy, after enlisting red-headed indie-chick Cat for the tracks they were working up, hit on something similar. Goias claims he just happened to hear 18-year-old Jessibel Suthiwong screaming across a Brooklyn street one day and figured she was exactly what they needed; she and her even younger friend Belinda are here for lifesize bratty cool much more than award-winning mic-handling. Soon enough, they were decked out in fab accessories-- Belinda's shoes versus Cat's scarf!-- and posing for the cover of this record. For the electro girl-group W.I.T., producer Larry Tee found three micro-dressed prettygirls to pose, giggle, and flirt; Fannypack has the same New York fashion-plate fun-time vibe, only these kids are far more earnest than they are camp. And no, of course it's not a good record by the high-modernist rock-boy standards of seriousness and emotional outpouring and whatnot. But neither, ""Cameltoe"" notwithstanding, is it just a bit of brainless fun. Between Goias and Fancy's remarkable drop-rolling bass science and the girls' bratty-Brooklynite rhyming, the better singles on here wind up sounding like something unprecedented: a booty-bass record for small children. There's just no other way to describe it: the guys' clever boings and beeps tend to be as cute as they are ass-twitching, making the whole thing feel like the would-be soundtrack for a Saturday-morning Salt 'n' Pepa cartoon. So between sampling both the Legendary Cold Crush Brothers and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and between a bunch of talky tracks in which Jessibel makes fun of Fancy's shirt and Cat gets called a hippopotamus-ass, here are the bits I'd be leaving on mix-tapes left and right if I weren't too lazy to make them: ""Hey Mami"". The obligatory buzz-off to scrubby guys turns out to be the best track on the record. It's the best beat, some deconstructed Latin piano tinkling over a super-jumpy beat and some of that pervasive big, boingy bass rolling; it's also the best microphone tag-team, the moment where you suddenly suspect the girls' rhyming really is meant to be a focus. When a big crisp break and a load of scratching come in at the end, the Pavlovian response is to start it all over again, just for this: ""Hootin and hollerin/ Ring around the collar and/ This ain't Scores, and you ain't waving a dollar."" ""So Stylistic"". The big old-school breaking track, like if Grandmaster Flash got early access to mid-90s sub-bass; the slinky darkness of the ""Push It""-style electro lead and the vocordered chorus hook are a perfect backdrop for this Friday-night glamour-girl proclamation. Belinda's nails are done. So is her homework. ""Boom Boom"" and ""Do It To It"". Like the names indicate: here's where you get the stiff tickle and the robotic ""make that booty jerk"" commands. The former has the album's queasiest bass drops and most insistent chopped-up dance instructions-- ""Booty up, booty down/ Work that booty all around"", yet it's somehow totally kid-friendly. The latter pairs some actual singing with Cat trying out the electro monotone voice Miss Kittin usually gets calls for. ""Things"". Not because it's really good, though it's a nice mid-album diversion: just thought you might want to know that this is the one where they sample the Yeah Yeah Yeah's ""Art Star"". For the purpose of an 8-year-old's singalong about their likes and dislikes: yes to parties, candy, shopping and boys, no to school and bad weather. Between this and the preceding discussion of bunnies, the ""cute"" reaches a mildly discomforting peak. Not exactly a great victory in the album-oriented terms of solidity or consistency, though the other tracks aren't nearly ""bad."" On the other hand, thank God for that: So Stylistic holds at least two of the most interesting tracks I've heard this year, and Fannypack have built a decent enough album around them.","Assuming your schedule isn't overfilled with important stuff like laundry, oil changes, and overtime, chances are you've heard-- ...

2,All Girl Summer Fun Band,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a081ea9e61561daa45a4/1:1/w_160/f84b0249.jpg,2003-08-05 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/114-2/,K,"All Girl Summer Fun Band's second outing is the kind of thing most critics-- read: grouches with slouches-- love to sink our coffee-stained fangs into. Producing the kind of unassuming cheery pop their moniker would indicate, 2 offers up a plethora of armor chinks for a hardened soul to exploit; in fact, if it didn't sound so unpleasantly racial, I'd almost describe it as all chink. But even stolid mopers have to admit that 2 stays remarkably on-message in its delivery, and without the protective shell of irony one might expect from the shield with a K in it. Providing fifteen distortion-flavored bubblegum songs in twenty-nine minutes, 2 is something like The Ramones without that pesky Y chromosome and all the macho behavior that comes with it. Topics span from marrying boys to dancing with boys to stealing boys from other girls, the vocals are chipper than chip, and the music is the sort that provokes wanton tired comparisons to sugary foods. It's a combination that could easily provoke toothaches (oof, sorry), but generally, they pull it off, endearing enough to earn a solid place as open-window fare. Musical stalker-valentine ""Jason Lee"" is particularly over-winning, despite its content resemblance to that fifteen-minute novelty ""David Duchovny"" song, and maybe because I too have a bit of a crush on Mr. Lee myself. Songs fortified with keyboards, never mind how obvious (""Video Game Heart"" features joystick laser noises, ""Samantha Secret Agent"" 60s spy-movie organ) stand out above the go-go surf-drum fray of perky mantras like ""Becky"" and ""Million Things"". If there's a criticism to be made-- other than the dead horse of one-dimensionality-- it's one that would require a lot more women's studies textbooks than I happen to own, not to mention one that we already sorta covered in our review of their debut. Perhaps I'm suffering from pseudo-liberal oversensitivity, but it's a bit worrisome that an all-girl summer fun band would necessarily have to sound like a quartet of 12 year-olds in the subject matter of their music. Since ""Jason Lee"" drops the knowledge that at least one member is 33, it seems a bit regressive for another vocalist to be yearning to ""run around like a puppy dog"" elsewhere on the album, as nice as that sounds against a three-chord fuzz backdrop. Couldn't they aspire to more mature lyrics in a pop setting, like Neko Case's bold statement (to my ears) of ""I don't need eventual dance halls/Just a bill from a restaurant?"" Okay, I don't know what the fuck that means either. And come to think of it, Fountains of Wayne are currently on M2 talking about how Stacy's mom has got it goin' on, so maybe it isn't a gender problem at all, but an issue for the whole power-pop-ulation. But here's a wish going out to the women of the All Girl Summer Fun Band, a wish for 3, 4, and so on to feature more mature subject matter while preserving the spry slices of two-minute July they've perfected. Because last I checked, us old people can still have some summer fun on occasion too.","All Girl Summer Fun Band's second outing is the kind of thing most critics-- read: grouches with slouches-- love ...

"Cone Toaster 12""",Black Dice,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d45e6ef959693204ee/1:1/w_160/0e1d1cae.gif,2003-08-05 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/746-cone-toaster-12/,DFA,"They say people are starting to dance again; NYC punks are starting art-funk bands, and suburban white kids are listening to hip-hop sincerely, rather than as shock ammunition. Beats are back? Looking back, I can't recall them leaving: we had the same revelation about ten years ago when the Beasties picked up their instruments (again), Cypress Hill met Lollapalooza, and Beck decided to quit fucking around in his bedroom and fuck around in the top 40 instead. And of course that whole Madchester thing a few years earlier, when Shaun Ryder's Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses decided it was easier to be wasted in the pocket than out; before that, Blondie and Talking Heads shook their left feet as PIL and Gang of Four dangled their right lobes. When people say that dance is back, they probably mean ""dance is not currently a guilty pleasure for some people who might otherwise be sulking in the corner pointing out how the other people dancing aren't as happy as they look-- and even then only during the times the sulkers aren't dancing as well."" So it should come as no surprise when formerly true-blue noisemakers Black Dice engage in whole album sides of four-on-the-floor rumble. Arriving only a year after their sudden interest in Boredoms-fueled sun-worship and laptop enhancement, and a mere three years after their remorselessly abrasive debut, Cone Toaster makes the case that, if there had ever been a rift between the 24 hour party people and the nighthawks at the diner, it was purely for show. As if it took this release to spell it out, the lines between rock blast and disco panache (or a ""metal-disco fusion"" as longtime Pitchfork booster Chuck Eddy once called it) are often blurry to the point of being confused for one another. At this point, why bother? Side-A features the title track: a new, semi-lengthy excursion into the nether regions of ugly escapism. Beginning with cut-up cymbals on the left, warped guitar samples on the right and a big messy whump in the middle, you'd be forgiven for thinking the band had gone Fennesz on us. And then she hits: bump-bump-bump-bump goes the bass drum, and just to show you they're still hard, they substitute scraping, metallic pogo for house hi-hat. The occasional shimmer of guitar hints at the electric ocean music of Beaches & Canyons, but when the drums come in, it's clear that Black Dice want to be considered, first and foremost, a dance band with a noise fetish, rather than the other way around. Because of the various noises (drastically erratic, pitch-shifted synth and occasional generator hum), I'm not sure how well this would go over at your party, but rest assured no one will have trouble finding the beat. They end the piece by speeding up to a tribal, tom-laden race into space. A voice-sample is sliced into small fragments, cycled repeatedly, while the reverb all around soaks up residual clamor; the end result is spacey, but alluring, and almost psychedelic. Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye remixes ""Endless Happiness"" from Beaches & Canyons on the second side. If ""Cone Toaster"" represented the breaking point of a noise band coming to terms with groove, ""Endless Happiness"" revels in carefree celebration of it. The song should be a warning siren to anyone in doubt about either the roots of Black Dice's change of heart, or the future of this music, to which the opening alarm clang clatter attests. However, soon afterwards, jazz bass and light bells paint a much subtler picture. When the soft beat comes in, the tune takes on a light, tropical ambience perfectly suited to an oceanfront sunset. Eye brings it down a little more before introducing a thick, howling sample and pumping up the festival drums full bore. At that point, it sounds fairly similar to some of recent Boredoms adventures (particularly from the Shock City Shockers projects), and anyone enamored with that sound should be feeling pretty good. Eye has a nice way of introducing fairly noisy elements into the mix with considerable grace, subtracting them just as well, so that, even though there's always a lot happening, it never seems too busy. Nice track. Normally, the question might now be, ""what's next?"" We know Black Dice are in the midst of making music for their upcoming full-length, and one can only assume it will be along the lines set forth on this primer. So far, they appear to be following a clear path to something pretty interesting, and if someone wants to label them a dance band now, so be it: I'll take whatever they've got when the results are as consistently engaging...hell, when they jam as much as this.","They say people are starting to dance again; NYC punks are starting art-funk bands, and suburban white kids are listening ...

Invent Modest Fires,Ghost Cauldron,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe3eb335119a49ed2d3/1:1/w_160/05204543.jpg,2003-08-05 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3624-invent-modest-fires/,!K7,"Deciphering Artists and their Promotional Department: The Consumer's Guide To Bland Music Chapter 11: Projects Purporting to be ""Diverse"": How to Proceed I. When a recording artist or their promotional team/record label describes his or her latest record, and the word ""diverse"" gurgles its way out of their ambitious throats, your mind should immediately expect one of two definitive reactions to the music and album in question: 1. Said album will exhibit a lack of interest in being ""diverse""; artists in question will be mixing styles and sounds purely for the experience of taking on new challenges and incorporating favored styles. Interest in exposure on multiple radio formats and the maximum number of British magazine covers rates low on the fulfillment scale. See The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin and Super Furry Animals' Guerilla for detailed examples. Note the confidence in the composition and the resulting pleasurable listening experience. 2. Said album will present an unsure and uneven collection of oddly juxtaposed compositions, some embellishing a familiar genre with elements of a presently lucrative or otherwise commercially validated sound. Songs will cover no less than three areas of music, and shall name no less than 6 on their promotional materials. Furthermore, the artists in question will no doubt stack the weights in their favor, inviting an otherwise respectable musician to join in on the ""diverse"" project. Possibility Number 2 is our primary concern, as it represents nearly 2/3rds of ""genre-hopping"" projects available for consumption. The following is a case study of a weak and forgettable album being marketed as ""diverse,"" including tips for the music consumer on how to avoid albums and artists seeking to sell their aimless recordings with similar tactics. You will find a copy of the case study enclosed with the Manual's supplemental materials. II. Case Study: Invent Modest Fires by the group Ghost Cauldron Released in 2003, said album was brought to the market by the !K7 label, a known purveyor of electronics-based recordings. Said album was distributed in its promotional form with a sticker extolling the virtues of the Ghost Cauldron project and its founder, the former member of a German group called Terranova. Said sticker claimed that contained on the enclosed compact disc were ""not only...breakbeats and techno vibes but also folk and rock elements as well."" This should immediately alert your suspicion. The vagueness of the terminology (""techno,"" in particular, is one you would do well to remember) and the dangerous sentence fragment that follows should send up red flags for the conscientious consumer. ""This album is diverse as ever..."" If we have the benefit of a CD player and a free copy of the album Invent Modest Fires, an intense inspection of the recorded material is our best evidence in exposing this music, parading as ""diverse,"" as lackluster and stale. Step 1. Play Track 1, ""Fire Walk With Me"", now. As the reference to David Lynch suggests, this track and the cut that follows are preoccupied with cinematics, composed with a soundtrack artist's ear for musical cues and movements. This is montage music with no montage, a mixture of interesting string arrangements backed by fairly stale and uninspired drum programming, no doubt evidence of the ""techno"" element and its failings. Track 2 ups the ante by featuring Priest of Anti-pop Consortium, whose horror-core delivery nearly saves the song from drowning in its own ominous melodrama. Consumer beware: the inclusion of a familiar face is a clever ruse, a way to slip past your defenses and set up shop. Tread carefully. Note: At this point it may be useful to reference Track 5, ""Fear"", which features the entire Anti Pop crew. While listening, try to determine if an increase in guest talent correlates to a decrease in the blandness of the song itself. Step 2. Play Track 3, ""See What I've Become"" and Track 8, ""Right Now"", consecutively. The inclusion of solemn acoustic ballads and brit-pop genre-mixing projects is a standard approach in these cases; see DJ Muggs' Dust for prototypical examples of this technique. Ghost Cauldron employ the nasally warble of Nick Taylor on these tracks, somber affairs that cover predictable rock territory, perhaps leaning towards the brit-pop side of things, but remaining moody. Beyond appearing to be mere calculations-- attempts to blanket a more broad target audience-- said tracks contain insipid lyrics, rigid drum-machine accompaniment, and an overall lack of inspiration. Be careful, as many participants easily forget these songs, and repeat Step 2 multiple times. Step 3. Play Track 11, ""Death Before Disco"", now. Often times, one or two compositions on a ""genre-hopping"" project such as Invent Modest Fires will expose the musician's true calling, interest, or talent. The result is a feeling of angst in the listener, an uncertainty of how to judge the project in question. As a fine slice of electro-inspired, Legowelt-ish electronica, the track in question sounds fresh and interesting, suggesting an obvious love of the referenced genres and, in effect, imbuing the song with authenticity, unquestionable by even the most jaded music consumer. Although we are almost finished proving the worthlessness of this ""diverse"" project, it is important to note that every failure can be expected to contain some percentage of success, no matter how minimal. Step 4 and Conclusion. Please read the ""File Under"" copy included with the compact disc. As !K7 would have you see it, Ghost Cauldron is all things to all music-loving people, encompassing ""breaks, trip-hop, post-rock, electro, rap, techno"" in an effortless, fluid mix. As a music consumer, compound words used as descriptors should give us pause. Note also the broad categories mentioned, how they leave plenty of room for interpretation, in many ways akin to legal jargon and legislation: !K7 cannot be held responsible if their definition of post-rock and trip-hop do not emulate your own, and Ghost cauldron can't be libeled in the event of such a discrepancy. Trust your instincts: if a project purports to draw influence from all corners of the musical realm, it's your duty to be suspicious, your right to be incredulous. In far too many situations, the compact disc you hold in your hand is a half-baked conglomerate of industry buzzwords not intended to shake your ass, but to lick your ear and remove the contents of your wallet.","Deciphering Artists and their Promotional Department: The Consumer's Guide To Bland Music

Left Handed EP,Lali Puna,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7dabf31b7dc7155d23/1:1/w_160/b19051eb.gif,2003-08-05 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4647-left-handed-ep/,Morr,"The first time I heard the Notwist's Neon Golden, I was on an Air France flight en route to America from Paris. As soon as I slipped the disc into my Walkman, hit play, and heard indie glitch-pop, I was crestfallen. At the time, I was only familiar with the German group as the architects of ""Scoop"", a sublime click-infused slice of ambient techno, one of the highlights of Morr Music's 2000 compilation, Putting the Morr Back in Morrissey. The record had just been released in Germany, and the only pre-album press I had seen for Neon Golden was a prominently placed review in French music mag Les Inrockuptibles, which I had thumbed through at a newsstand but alas couldn't read. My hopes dashed, it took a few weeks for me to embrace, and eventually love, the album. The change in direction and sound of this newest release by Notwist leader Markus Acher's other, arguably more established group Lali Puna isn't anywhere near as jarring as the difference between ""Scoop"" and Neon Golden, but it's certainly a left turn. After two rewarding albums of melodic, warm digital melodies, Lali Puna's Left Handed EP prominently features (gasp!) guitar. The title track of this slender three-song, 13-minute EP begins with a frantic pulsating synth, but it's soon overpowered by Acher's familiar, churning six-string. More forceful than in any of his recent Notwist work-- although still far from the band's punk roots-- the track briefly gives center stage to Valerie Trebeljahr's melancholy voice and pensive lyrics, before building into a thrashing climax. Blurring the lines between Acher's two most high-profile bands, ""Left Handed"" sounds like a seamless, self-made mashup from this ambidextrous artist. This EP-- Lali Puna's first new release since a 2002 split single with Isan-- is either a teaser to acclimate listeners to a new sound or a curious one-off flavored by the contribution of Notwist touring guitarist Max Punktezahl, who earns a co-songwriter credit on the title track. I'm hoping for the former: as entrancing as the band's previous efforts are, after two albums of virtually identical moods and sounds, change is welcome. ""Left Handed"" was recorded almost 18 months ago-- around the same time as Neon Golden-- so, if this was an anomaly rather than a taste of what is to come, it would make little sense to sit so long on its release. The EP's second track, ""Left Handed Dub"", is equally wonderful. A remix of the title track, it's at first built on dub's recognizable explorations of space and use of echo, but quickly speeds its pace and slides into an engrossing mélange of spongy phrases and rhythms. Delicately layered, it moves from gurgling beats to spy-film paranoia to engrossing warmth without any neck snapping. Filling out the EP is the band's cover of Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's ""Together in Electric Dreams"", first released on the 2000 tribute album Reproductions: The Songs of the Human League. Oakey and Moroder's track is more notable for the collaboration itself than the result, which is a surprisingly limp ballad. Lali Puna's cover is an improvement, retreating into introspection and infusing the song with passive-aggressive resignation. The inclusion here of ""Together in Electric Dreams"" does cheekily nod to what is striking about the title track. If Lali Puna plan to retain the guitar as a fixture in their sound, the song's key sentiment-- a fleeting love that will ""always be...in electric dreams""-- seems an appropriate, sweet farewell to the band's all-synth days.","The first time I heard the Notwist's Neon Golden, I was on an Air France flight en route to ...

The Ugly American,Mark Eitzel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc155e6ef95969322d75/1:1/w_160/6cdc8b3c.jpg,2003-08-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2701-the-ugly-american/,Thirsty Ear,"Oh, Mark, you sly devil. I see that double entendre in your new album title. Anyone with a passing familiarity with your work could guess it's just another morbidly humorous jab at yourself, like the title of your last full-length of new material, The Invisible Man. Ah, but further research reveals the true back story here-- The Ugly American was recorded in Greece, with a band of local musicians playing mostly traditional instruments. You're still poking fun at yourself, but this time it's more specifically aimed at your temporary expatriation. Mark, I don't wanna accuse you of being in a holding pattern or anything, because I hear you're writing stuff for a new album, but two albums with no new original material in two years is mighty suspicious. I'm just saying. Last year's Music for Courage & Confidence was a diverting foray into the oft dodgy realm of covers by our man Eitzel, but it wasn't terribly essential listening, largely because it found him putting aside his primary strength-- songwriting-- in favor of a spin through a weirdly chosen repertoire of other people's songs. I guess you could see it as something of a vacation for him, and The Ugly American, following almost exactly a year later, feels like an extension of that vacation, revisiting nine songs from his past (both solo and with the venerable American Music Club), and recasting them through the lens of Greek folk music. It's not as singer/songwriter-goes-all-World-Music-on-our-asses as it sounds, though. The mournful character of the Greek modes and the gorgeous timbres of the traditional instruments build quite a house for Eitzel's dejected muse to live large in. The atmosphere is a huge departure from the ProTools ambience that unexpectedly marked 2001's The Invisible Man, and Eitzel sounds unusually comfortable-- his singing here may be the best he's ever done. Half of the album consists of songs from his days with American Music Club, and the reinventions they get complement the original versions nicely, for the most part. ""Western Sky"" and ""Last Harbor""-- both from AMC's California-- rank among Eitzel's most haunting compositions, and the treatment the Greek band gives them lends them an effervescence even the original versions didn't quite possess. Manos Ahalinotopoulos crafts a gorgeous melody on pipes for ""Nightwatchman"", and the buoyant drumming of Panos Tolios gives it a confident bounce; this version has a sweep and grace to it that are hard to deny, even if you swear by the original. ""Take Courage""-- originally from the Eitzel solo set Songs of Love: Live a the Borderline-- is beautified by Manos Pirovolakis' Cretan lyra countermelodies, and is one of several songs that makes the case that there needs to be more mandolin on rock albums. Thoughtful violin orchestration, pensive clarinet and sympathetic drumming turn ""Will You Find Me?"" (from AMC's excellent Mercury) into a rich meditation where it was once stark and unrelentingly bleak. The biggest shock, and the biggest misstep, on the album is the version of ""Here They Roll Down"", originally the opening track from AMC's first truly great album, United Kingdom. Where the definitive version blends with a field recording of a highway underpass and ends with an odd false crescendo, this version is full of squealing cacophony, mostly from wind instruments, while Eitzel sings the lyrics about directionless motorists almost without regard to the weirdness flailing around him. It's...strange, and while it's certainly a bold track, it doesn't fit. The Ugly American closes with a cover of a song by producer Manolis Famellos, which, with its hook of ""She crucified my ruined heart so sweetly,"" is perhaps a tad more melodramatic than most of Eitzel's work, but nonetheless fits the mood of the album well. For Eitzel's loyal core of fans, this is obviously required purchasing, if only for the versions of such difficult-to-find gems as ""What Good Is Love?"" (from a tour-only disc) and the two Songs of Love tracks (""Jenny"" and ""Take Courage""). The Ugly American stands well on its own, though, and certainly proves Eitzel to be a more versatile performer than he sometimes seems. For a loop in the holding pattern, it delivers much more than expected.","Oh, Mark, you sly devil. I see that double entendre in your new album title. Anyone with a passing familiarity ...

Music critics jump at the opportunity to prove the name of an album is indicative of the band itself, or the songs contained within, or some radical turn the band has taken. It's like overzealous comparative lit majors who forge half-baked relationships between two entirely incongruous pieces of work: ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was clearly informed by 12th century cave paintings of vegetarian mating rituals in South India."" Ah, the Liberal Arts. We've endured a the Strokes jabs-- ""No, seriously, is this it? I mean it, like, is it really?""-- or my personal favorite Microphones catcall-- ""It was hot, we stayed in the water...and sucked!"" Sometimes the album title is relevant to content, but all too often, these analogies are wrenched beyond reason for the sake of some pithy introduction. So humor me for second. If there were any pop band out there today ""built on squares,"" the Starlight Mints would probably be the last you'd suspect. A square is simple, unchallenging, and utterly honest; this quirky Oklahoma ensemble, with its bizarre lyrics to its unconventional pop instrumentation, is the furthest thing from equal sides and right angles. Pop music in a strict sense, however, is very square and very simple. Ultimately, it breaks down to verse and chorus. Our reaction to it is not intelligent or analytical but visceral: we like the way it sounds, and we often judge pop based on how we feel when we listen to it, not how cleverly we see the chords fitting together or why the composer chose to follow one particular note with another. What drives pop music thex96 and what makes it so intriguing as an artform-- is the challenge of crafting (e.g. intellectualizing) a truly visceral experience. In the most timeless pop music-- and perhaps timeless music in general-- there is a symbiotic relationship between the song's visceral immediacy and the depth of its inner workings. The latter preserves the former, while the former makes the latter relevant. Immediacy is no hard thing to come by in pop music these days-- saccharine hooks are a dime a dozen. The task in front of today's pop musicians is to maintain immediacy, but to make that physical immediacy ""interesting"" too, which is purely on an intellectual level. The most rudimentary elements of pop-- its squares-- must be rearranged for the sake of the genre itself. Not to bill them as the saviors of pop, but the Starlight Mints-- in a vein similar to the Decemberists or the mid-90s Cardigans-- are doing just that. Built on Squares finds the band writing enjoyable and refreshingly interesting pop songs: all eleven tracks are fun, catchy and well-conceived, making this very much the logical progression from 2001's The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of. The Mints avoid the pitfall of using variety of instruments as a gimmicky substitute for carefully considered song writing, and what results is an album that comes off natural and effortless, rooted firmly in the squares of pop, where even its orchestro-pop embellishments from violin to trombone to bowling pins at the beginning of ""Irene"" seem uncontrived. After the opener ""Black Cat"", peppered with quirky string arrangements at its beginning and throughout, the catchy quasi-country romp ""Brass Digger"" bops around, replete with a Cake-like mariachi trumpet, blues harmonica and Alan Vest's oddball lyrics. ""From the Brooklyn train to the other everglades, have you ever met a rat named the Brass Digger?"" As if rats weren't bizarre enough subject matter, the spacey rocker that follows (""Goldstar"") has Vest detailing a run-in with a woman ""kinky like a girl from Mars"" who tries to shoot him with the mysterious ""goldstar gun."" ""Irene"" is perhaps most indicative of the band's ability to conflate a wide range of seemingly incongruous influences and instrumentations, and from these elements to produce something entirely graceful and original. Fuzz bass, horn lines reminiscent of The Price Is Right, skittering Casiotone twitches, and balls-out AC/DC guitar riffs coexist harmoniously as the kitschy female voice floats atop the mix, singing the 50s bubblegum-ish ""You make my world spin 'round."" For its remarkable depth and business, ""Irene"" never chokes on its own complexity. It is a testament to the meticulous production of Built on Squares, which undoubtedly aspired to instruments not dominating each other in the mix. It is at once easy and difficult to speak of the Starlight Mints' influences, easy because they are immediately recognizable, difficult because there are so many of them. The album's latter half alone, for instance, features the Weezer-like lilt of ""Zillion Eyes"", a blatant aping of the Kinks' riff from ""All Day and All of the Night"" in ""Jack In The Squares"", and Vest's Bowie-like tremolo in ""Jimmy Cricket"". The Starlight Mints in this sense walk the fine line between sounding like no other band and like every other band before them. Such concerns, however, are neither here nor there when the album is within an earshot; Built on Squares is the fun and catchy work of talented pop musicians, writing terribly interesting songs without compromising pop's essential, visceral lure.","Album titles can become goldmines of unintended significance.

Comets on Fire,Comets On Fire,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6349d034d5c69bf349f/1:1/w_160/c7df15d0.jpg,2003-08-04 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1562-comets-on-fire/,Alternative Tentacles,"When a band's name fits its sound almost perfectly, further critical unpacking seems painfully superfluous. Perhaps comparable to an early '90s Blackjack cut-out, a gas-huffing Acid Mothers Temple, Monoshock-- especially the 1996 opus Walk To The Fire-- or an amphetamine-dosed Blue Cheer, the Santa Cruz quartet Comets on Fire creates sonic defibrillation through burning patch cords, distended Echoplex and endless reserves of frenetic rock-n-roll zeal; at their best, the jams are so all-encompassing and tightly suffocating, they let off a visionary flair, lighting up the nighttime sky of modern garage rock dreck, akin to the time you stumbled across the off-kilter pawnshop halo surrounding 13th Floor Elevators, or the freeform hippie stargazing of Angus Maclise's Brain Damage in Oklahoma City. The band certainly deserves this reissue of its out-of-print 2001, vinyl-only debut, and the venerable Alternative Tentacles does one better, generously including six additional, sprawling songs recorded during a howling, raw concert in 2000 (and pre-dating last year's more eclectically tweaked Field Recordings From the Sun [Ba Da Bing!]). Here, the sprawl doesn't dig paths into Ben Chasny's No Six Organs of Admittance psych prettiness; instead, the band fixates on an endless dose of desperate, over-amplified histrionics, fronted by a distorted martyr with rocks in his mouth. Blustering through more 4-channel explosions than most can probably handle in a single sitting, Comets on Fire avoids slowing down the action or turning down the ear-fracturing skree for over an hour: gilt feedback connects, extends, and exudes, dangling from the ceiling as shiny, fractured stalactites. Starting the proper album off a-squealin', ""All I Need"" is an acid-rock, noise version of tuning, until some seconds into the track, when the various threads of feedback stitch together and bang forward into a washed-out, garbled rock anthem. Ethan Miller's voice-- as outer-limits as his guitar-- treads the waves beyond all the distortion, only allowing brief glances at a few stranded words about grave robbers in love, cosmic ghosts, and miasmatic plagues. Really, though, actual verbal comprehension is secondary to the full-on atmosphere the band constructs: they focus on patterning, momentary pauses, dynamics, and you're left waiting for the roof to cave in under the barometric pressure. The great thing about the echoplex is the way it spreads over any potential blank spaces during the course of the album, like the splatter painting of Pollock spun askew through some centrifugal fuck-up. After the opener, the brief hand-clapped raga ""Rimbaud Blues"" is the only sustained breakdown until the album's end. The live show begins following a two-minute pause at the end of ""Days of Vapors"", the final, gloriously decomposed track from the original self-titled LP. Like a lot of low-fidelity music recorded in boomy rooms, this concert material is high on the high-end and shrill. Miller's vocals, unfortunately, have too much presence here, losing the denser growl of the album, sometimes congealing enough to make sense. All in all, the live material lacks the fullness of the other recordings (the drums sound super tinny) and perhaps offers some glances at cracks in the astronauts' armor. As with Modest Mouse's Interstate 8 EP, also featuring a demo set appended, after a couple listens I forgot to wait for the fuzzier, less interesting material and just edited the bad parts out. While Comets on Fire does lack those ponderous Opeth-textured moments of Field Recordings From the Sun, its unrelenting snarled beastliness is one hell of a sonic whoop-ass, outclassing-- by a solar system-- most of the over-the-top rock music I've heard thus far in 2003. Skip the live stuff, and you'll never come down.","When a band's name fits its sound almost perfectly, further critical unpacking seems painfully superfluous. Perhaps comparable to an ...

It's the New Thing! - The Step Forward Years,The Fall,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3713d197565213b4c7/1:1/w_160/5a23c7f2.gif,2003-08-04 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2971-its-the-new-thing-the-step-forward-years/,SanctuaryCastle,"The saying goes that if it's Mark E. Smith and your grandma, it's still The Fall. My granny has more teeth these days, but The Fall have proven more durable than anyone could have fathomed. From their inception in the wake of a 1976 Sex Pistols show in Manchester, line-up shifts have partially disguised how rigorously stripped-down The Fall's sound has always been, and how enervating the noise is. Of course, the accommodating, slight sugary pop brought on board by wife Brix made the bitter musings of M.E.S. popularly palatable for a decade, but it still comes down to the singular, caterwauling caustics of that ex-dock worker, and the relentless drums thudding behind him. Smith is cantankerous enough to combine the wit of Peter Hammill with the purely physical, fricative qualities of the human mouth, a là Henri Chopin, all with an equal affinity for adenoidal rockabilly acetates and crackling Big Youth dub plates. Such a simple formula delivers variations on these lingual themes in thick rap-speak and hiccupping hollers to make Smith a singular creature in pop music, carrying forth unabated throughout his existence. But The Fall plop out at least two discs a year. It's always been hard to keep up; in fact, a new BBC collection and box set of 2001 bootlegs have surfaced just as of this writing. Even the most devout fans I know gave up after The Frenz Experiment, though a few diehards stuck it out until Brix's return (she left Mark in the late 80s) on Light User Syndrome (1996). Even the stalwarts have surely been overwhelmed by the deluge of scrap material released since. To that end, these two reissues straddle the band's career. It's the New Thing! compiles the burgeoning croaks of the group, when they were signed with Step Forward, who released four Fall singles and two albums. The ground plans are laid bare on this set in the sneering manifestos that would inform each and every step Smith took thereafter. Soundbites such as ""We are the Fall; Northern white crap that talks back"" couldn't hit the nail any harder or more precisely on the head, were it not for the even earlier a-side ""Repetition"", which shows his hand and their MO from that instance forth. Calling out for ""white noise"" at the start, Mark E. details the three R's of his music: ""Repetition, repetition, repetition...Repetition's in our music and we're never gonna lose it."" Can't say he didn't warn us. ""Frightened""-- the first cut off of Live at the Witch Trials (1977)-- reveals a tune as overtly anthemic as anything else the Fall would attempt for the next twenty-five years, the beats and chords reveling in a freedom that Smith would soon nip in the bud, snipping the melodic elements out of the group altogether. ""Rebellious Jukebox"" is a jangly pop slice that shows a side to the band that wouldn't be resurrected --and ridden to its artistic peak-- until Brix hitched up with the old man in '83. ""Rowche Rumble"" is weird, wiry springs of gut-string guitars quivering as tympanicky thuds jerks about like jacked-up jokers, Smith jeering at valium addicts and their ""suppliers,"" a sound joyous and addictive. Dragnet (1979) is by far the roughest and most assiduously lo-fi of Fall albums (not counting live albums like Totale's Turns), but still hides great flashes in its murk. ""Psykick Dancehall"" is close to a Fall standard, the verbiage a skull chock-full of paranoia, hipster-pricks, record collections, and other hobgoblins of the mind. ""Spectre Vs Rector"" is as much a minimal rock tape composition as it is an eight-minute epic of New Zealand scene-spawning, as cheap-speaker fibrillations, iniquitous riff-noise, and wobbly cassette wheels push about, loutish and callous, even as the beat of the band clanks to life amongst the distorted live tape backing. Castle Music cannot decide if its trying to compile all of the Fall's singles from this time period or re-release the first two albums (Live at the Witch Trials and Dragnet), so instead, It's the New Thing! does neither. Early Fall sides like ""Bingo-Masters Break-Out"", ""Various Times"", ""In My Area"", and ""Psykick Dancehall 2"" are dropped. Four tracks are left off of Dragnet and the middle of Live is gutted. It's not one-stop shopping, but the crucial stuff is all jammed in here. For all the highlights of that one disc, the three CD set Time Enough at Last culls together the head-scratching discs that followed in the wake of the ho-hum Light Syndrome User from 1996. Oxymoron, Cheetham Hill, and 15 Ways to Leave Your Man appeared on each other's heels with nary a personnel description or explanation as to their point. 15 Ways is a somewhat tepid live show from London's Astoria in 1996, but both accompanying records have live tracks thrown in to confound matters further. Such is the story of Receiver records' pillaging of The Fall's back catalog: shameless, excessive, inexplicable. Unutterable Oxymoron is an album package of lips and assholes (literally), with shitloads of vocal processing on Mark E.'s sneer, an unrepentant setting for the clap tracks, and painfully dated drum programming. It somehow works with the Peter Gunn-guitar riffs on the title track and the dateless bounce that the Fall does so effortlessly on ""Powder Keg"". Even with a near hip-hop pattern that simultaneously loads some New Order synth patches in, ""White Lines"" is tolerable, and it has nary a whine or word in sight. But who could withstand the limpid rap Brix does on ""Glam Racket"", which positively reeks of her time spent in the widow Love's shadow, auditioning as a replacement for Hole's overdosed bassist. Another instro shows up as an ""Italiano"" roadster, pumping cheap acid F/X as it whizzes past. This reveals the repackaging problems that originally plagued this stretch of the Fall discography: not even twenty minutes have passed, and already ""Oxymoron"" is rechristened ""He Pep!"" and given the run-through once again. ""Interlude/Chilinism"" turns up on Cheetham Hill as ""The Chisellers"", and again in a live form as, uh, ""Chilinist"". ""E.S.P. Disco"" = ""Psykick Dancehall"" live. Cheetham Hill suffers similarly as the first disc, as a scrap heap with a few gleanable keepers like the mellowed ""Time Enough at Last"". The track listing is cluttered with castaways from such indistinguishable Fall albums like Code: Selfish, Cerebral Caustic and The Light User Syndrome. While it's handy to have all the dubious titles that Receiver first foisted on the public in one box, there's so many titles vying for attention that all but the heartiest of Fall-ophiles will already have passed the saturation point into nausea well before you have time enough to go through all of these.","The saying goes that if it's Mark E.

Pole,Pole,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c3c0084474cd0bfc53/1:1/w_160/65851403.jpg,2003-08-04 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6370-pole/,Mute,"Like anyone else who followed Stefan Betke's Pole through the twists and turns of his glitchy laptop dub sound only to arrive at the charming cul de sac of 2000's Pole 3, I've wondered where Pole would (or could) go next. Betke had seemingly squeezed everything he could from a broken Waldorf filter, hiss, crackles and room-shaking bass (and all things considered he extracted some very good music); his next full-length record, it seemed, would involve a new direction out of necessity. And so it does. As previewed on two EPs (45/45 and 90/90, the latter being more of a DJ tool with its multiple versions of a single track), Pole has scrubbed up his sound considerably, fleshed out his beats with upfront drums, and opened himself to collaboration. The noise that previously filled the chasms of space-- all the sonic byproduct that used to all but define him as a producer-- are essentially gone. In fact, you may not hear a cleaner record this year. As for the collaborators, the most notable addition is backpack rapper Fat Jon, who lends his lyrics and his dispassionate diction to four of the record's nine tracks. Other tracks include acoustic bassist August Engkilde and saxophonist Thomas Haas. Taken together, these changes completely shuffle the deck for Pole. Unfortunately, it doesn't come up aces. Pole has some worrying problems, starting with the tracks featuring Fat Jon. On the one hand, given the sparking minimalism of Pole's new musical direction, Fat Jon seems a logical choice for vocals. His style is equally clear and precise, and he can rap with speed and skillfully navigate complex phrases without losing the rhythm. His lyrical interests tend toward the phenomenological, probing the nature of the way we experience time, love, and struggle, among other concerns, and they are not without insight. But Fat Jon's style is so removed, so focused on the word at the expense of quirkiness or hooks (each of his choruses is just a phrase repeated ad nauseum), his raps just hang there like another element on the Cubase grid. Even allowing for lack of interest and knowledge in underground rap, Fat Jon still strikes me as a rather dull stylist. There is no tension when his voice is set against Pole's beats, and the pairing ends up being too complimentary. Generous collaborator that he is, Betke's backing tracks for Fat Jon are just that, background loops used to support vocalist's ideas in the words. Betke stretches a bit more on Pole's five instrumentals, and in a few of these are seeds for a potentially interesting album. The honking saxophone that Haas adds fills the stainless steel dub of ""Bushes (There is a Secret Behind)"" provides just the sort of tonal contrast that the track needs (it's also the only track with a hint of a crackle). ""Green is Not Green (Yellow)"" also has some of Hass' riffing, this time with Engkile adding some loping upright bass. It's one of the loosest and funkiest Pole tracks extant, and, with its melodica accents, is the most dub selection on Pole by far. I already raved about ""Back Home"" when I talked about the 45/45 EP; suffice to say that it's a glowing surge of joy more nakedly emotional than you imagined a Pole track could be. Pole goes out on a limb on ""Back Home"" and it works; elsewhere, he goes out on a limb and it doesn't. In lieu of a green-sleeved Pole 4, we take what we can get.","Like anyone else who followed Stefan Betke's Pole through the twists and turns of his glitchy laptop dub sound ...

Spirit in Stone,Lifesavas,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb8abf31b7dc7155fed/1:1/w_160/5eb1c870.jpg,2003-08-04 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4945-spirit-in-stone/,Oebase,"Solesides used to be a crew of smart-ass college-educated rappers from the Bay Area. Now they're Quannum Projects, talent incubator for the West Coast underground. Their latest project is the Lifesavas, two kids from Portland who rap but didn't start out as MCs: Jumbo the Garbageman is a sample-monger at heart, and Vursatyl is really a streetwise vocalist. This works, as Jumbo's punchy vamps only get expanded by veteran producer Chief Xcel (of Blackalicious fame), and Vursatyl's subdued hooks are broken up by a whole guesthouse full of mercenary rappers (including Gift of Gab, Latyrx, and J-Live). Still, while there's no lack of variety in structure, style, and content, after a few listens one starts pining for the instrumentals. Opener ""Soldierfied"" is a janky, thorax-blunting session, typical of the clean kicks and filthy snares to follow. The battle rhymes, impelled more by villainous vamps than any heartfelt hostility, bleed over into ""It's Over"": ""Who cares if you can rhyme in Arabic with a Portuguese accent [and] recorded your demo 30 below zero in the basement of a Buddhist shrine?"" Vursatyl first breaks out his street-smoothed singing voice in ""What If It's True?"", a catchy, vacant jam on the level of, say, the Black-Eyed Peas. It's great that Quannum isn't afraid to hire the occasional session musician, and the rhythm tracks stay compulsively spare and unpretentious; the only real musical letdowns on the album come a good forty minutes later, with the rushed and unrappable ""Emerge"" and a flat rehearing of ""Blackbird"". In ""Hellohihey"", Vursatyl plays the ghosts of his own egos past, present and future, in a trite but well-executed parable about ego trips, whose punchline draws a nice distinction between raw egotism and healthy self-hype. The rest of the morals on Spirit in Stone, however, are less predictable and more controversial: one song manages to come out against abortion, cloning, sodomy, pornography and war almost in the same breath. So when Lifesavas say, ""Careful what you rep of the new left, only a few left,"" it's an open question whether they're counting themselves. Like good liberals, they distance themselves from oil politics, corporate scandals, and terror profiling. So what do they want? First, reparations for slavery. Then ""revenge for the engineered virus, slit they eyelids, carve a image in they iris."" Are you listening, Howard Dean? It just gets weirder as a Last Judgment vibe takes over the album's farthest reaches. ""5th Horseman"" is a mix of undead camp and apocalyptic politics. ""Inventing proverbs in the hot tub-- famine, pestilence: here come the fifth horseman in a b-boy stance!"" This is not your pastor's Book of Revelations. Then ""Skeleton"" wins the Most Unlikely Sample prize for 2003, dunking a folk ghost song into a nasty, swaggering clav pocket (""Have you seen the ghost of John?/ Long white bones and the rest all gone/ Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?""). Here Lifesavas take a break from abrasive self-righteousness to make room for some real, if stale, theological speculation: ""The world's worst death was in the kiss,"" they muse. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he didn't exist."" There's no danger of that for these rappers, who must either see a lot of movies, or a world of men teeming with Satan's work. Everyone else will have to get by on faith that the instrumental album exists.","Solesides used to be a crew of smart-ass college-educated rappers from the Bay Area.

Though the record's liner notes claim it was recorded intermittently between September 2001 and May 2002, Charlene seem oddly synched up to the early August ethos of right now, suggesting (with boyish, hands-in-pockets smugness) that we're all about to ram, unknowingly, into the beginning of the end-- that something stricter is poised to infringe upon loopy summertime bliss in big, dramatic ways. Conceptually, it's sorta old news: the incorrigible melding of melody and noise, of disintegration, of static and gnashing feedback interrupting otherwise charming, palatable hooks. But Charlene's screechy intrusions are soothingly organic and deeply foreboding at the same time, thick with inevitability; reverb-heavy drums (and lots of drum machines), white noise, keyboards, guitars, and smooth, plaintive vocals build persistently repetitive verse/chorus tracks that never properly climax or transition, but keep worming around, making suggestions, promising things. Muscular and sometimes heaving, Charlene's overarching sound might be vaguely reminiscent of the heady spin of bands like Catherine Wheel or the Jesus & Mary Chain, but Charlene's take on noise-pop is an oddly evasive one, and it's almost impossible to figure out which of the sounds here are real and which have been coyly synthesized-- each track unfolds like a spacey, fuzz-heavy jostle through a closet full of noisemakers, where everything is perfectly fine until, groping around in the dark, you knock something over and can't get it to shut the hell off. Opener ""Ripoff"" is steady and controlled, featuring dull, pounding beats and consistently reeling guitars that (while not exactly rousing) are pretty far from complacent-- their intermittently squealing bursts break scene well. The track finally culminates in a maddening drum machine hammer that doesn't age brilliantly from listen to listen, but still makes its point about the songs that follow: pretty doesn't always last very long. ""Shot Down"" is a lit-up electronic rain, a simple, clean keyboard melody loping along over shaky beats and disembodied guitar whine, while ""Sugarblocker"" is a blurry soundscape of trilling beats and earnestly breathed vocals. The half-acoustic ""Ender"" shows that Charlene aren't necessarily wedded to their formula: a soft, subdued dirge, its lush keyboard and docile guitar melody prove Charlene have the songwriting prowess to exist without tricks, that they can pull off slow-burning, sleepy sincerity in a way that's both tender and unexpected. The band deserves credit for infusing a familiar formula with weight and tension, and for brewing a lingering unease. It's not exactly a seasonal record, but Charlene is suffused with the kind of awkward, transitory disorientation that marks our calendar year. Autumn inches closer.","Charlene released their self-titled debut way back in November, its ten tracks set up as a vigorous chaser to the ...

Sinking Hearts EP,The Organ,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba30eb335119a49ec976/1:1/w_160/384d5a71.jpg,2003-08-03 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6082-sinking-hearts-ep/,Mint,"Is this female five-piece-- fresh off a tour with The New Pornographers, and having played with fellow Canadians as luminous as Hot Hot Heat and Jerk with a Bomb-- the sound of a baritone Kristin Hersh fronting an analog Ladytron with more heart? Not entirely; The Organ is more like Interpol meets The Shaggs. For example, the first song's only lyrics (""Oh goodness me/ We've got to meet/ I need someone to have fun"") are superficial cousins of 'Pol's ""I will surprise you sometime/ I'll come around/ When you're down."" Another kinship between the two is that their extry-catchy, ridiculously replayable CDs ooze misery-guts. This here typist would pay top dollar to borrow Guy Pearce's time machine (that he used to salvage savages like a good whitey) and fly to the September 2002 night that The Organ opened for Matador's Fashed Four. The Organ's execution might be unsophisticated, but pulling off the refrain ""I can see the hearts sinking"" (barked like a priority item on an Ian Curtis wishlist) can't be beginner's luck. Readers with cats named Steven Patrick who mark May 22 by killing uncles and using southpaw grammar, take note: Katie Sketch is Miss Moz, croon-floating through the proceedings like a burnished fop-sage. And before you knock the simplistic lyrics mostly about how the speaker has become desire's jalopy, remember that an amazing box set could be made just of versions of ""Baby Please Don't Go"" (start with Big Joe Williams, then AC/DC, then Them, etc). Savvy does surface, as ""It's Time to Go"" cleverly bemoans a beat scene's ""la da da"" songs with a ""la da da"" chorus (less chili-fistedly than Smog's ""Where is the beauty that I once had? I hate songs with questions in them""). Befuddlingly, though, this six-songs-in-fourteen-minutes disc is difficult to dissociate from the 1978 zombie film Dawn of the Dead (which is no slam of the film's score by The Goblins and Dario Argento): Maybe the bandname (which is supposed to refer to a Hammond X123 that Jenny Smyth plays like a beach-carnival spook-house soundtrack) invokes the film's barrage of disembowelin' courtesy of Vietnam-combat-photographer-turned-makeup-effects-ace Tom Savini. Maybe the liner photograph of the band on a mall stairwell invokes the film's zombie-flecked mall setting. Maybe the band's Canadian-ness is a contributing factor, as Dawn's central characters were trying to get to Canada, and the new remake was filmed there. Dawn was dark pop, with its weird mix of audience-ingratiation and resulotionless nihilism, and as it lingered in theatres throughout 1979, two similarly dual-toned albums would surface whose cavernous minimalism is emulated by the buried, angular wedgework of The Organ's guitarist Deborah Cohen: Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and The Cure's Three Imaginary Boys (echoes of Siouxsie's Banshees, who dropped their first two during the 78/79 stretch, can also be detected). (And: The Smiths, major touchstones for The Organ, would peak just as Dawn's sequel, Day of the Dead, emerged in the mid-80s). Dawn even offers insight into why we get excited about new revisitations of these old, comfortable worlds: the film's few living hypothesize that the zombies come back to the mall because they mechanically recall its importance/centrality. In addition to being moany and monosyllabic (like... zombies), The Organ's lyrics are about a woman being left too alone, just as Dawn was primarily about a woman (Gaylen Ross as the unforgettable Fran) resigned to being abandoned in a crapscape (though in accordance with the strangely conservative rules of supposedly chaotic apocalypse films, she must be pregnant or otherwise Maryfied/matriarchified-- true of even the recent 28 Days Later, the zombies of which pick up where the fast-moving undead of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video left off.) (And damn if Chris Eccleston isn't in both Later and that movie about Joy Division dying and coming back as zombies called The Happy Mondays.) The Organ's Katie Sketch sings of being emotionally torn and rent, just as human skin in zombie hands pulls apart like fig newtons or salt water taffy (""There Is Nothing I Can Do"" deals with either gore or innocence: the speaker is either cutting paper or herself). The admittedly novice rhythm section plods like those hobbly old-school zombies, which can make the band sound like it's decomposing or about to crumble apart. Perhaps a producer will tighten and polish them for their full-length Mint debut, but, like with B-horror, their amateurishness doesn't eclipse their fabulousness. The final song is the slow jam all zombies should woo and coo to: ""No One Has Ever Looked So Dead"". How could the 25th anniversary version of Dawn neglect this track which so inimitably befits how both of the film's couples break up because one participant blossoms into a lurching blue-green cannibal corpse?

Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid,Elefant,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce0eb335119a49ecd73/1:1/w_160/504772a7.jpg,2003-08-03 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2890-sunlight-makes-me-paranoid/,Kemado,"At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing. I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy English moaners like Morrissey and the Psychedelic Furs and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who understood both the charm of romantic, British new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared bashful soft spots for the Sisters of Mercy and the Ocean Blue. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would be My Time. Right? Yeah, well, I was fourteen: dim as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing, no matter how lovable. The best, New York's Interpol-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't because of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds. It's a stretch to expect another. More common are bands like Longwave, whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant Average Guitar Bands. They know their Pixies riffs back to front. They've studied the driving jangle and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides of the Atlantic. They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on M2 and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice. Elefant are okay, if disappointingly just okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a more-British Longwave?), though their inspirations are probably the most Anglophilic of the bunch: frontman and songwriter Diego Garcia has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no matter how much it attempts to showcase a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like David Bowie croons, despite frequent attempts to growl them up a little. If Interpol-- apart from Carlos-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a Pet Shop Boys record, well, I'll bet Diego did. ""Suburbia"", at least. But that's all subtext: for the bulk of Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid's ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential is audible in the first track, ""Make Up"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; Garcia wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all suave before eventually rolling, repeating, and chewing up the phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of superfast arpeggios, and a moment later, it's back to atmospheric plucks; guitar-handler Mod's remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths. ""Bokkie"" starts with a boxing-bass strut that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between Garcia's lines. These guys have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""Tonight Let's Dance"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes they've picked out of it: it's the rhythm-led pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism. The problem is that Garcia isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of Interpol's, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit recreationists My Favorite (note to Diego: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). If Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues. Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over. Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny American indie bands with their unforced and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere. A lot has happened since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have. Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through the looking glass is hardly magical.","At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing.

The Stix,Jaga Jazzist,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bd13d197565213af13/1:1/w_160/b4e362d7.jpg,2003-08-03 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4194-the-stix/,Ninja Tune,"As a flock of aunts, cousins and grandparents struggled to rouse me from my supine position on the altar steps, I contemplated how strange it was that my initial thoughts turned not to how I had just ruined my uncle's wedding ceremony-- knees buckled due to both physical fatigue and uninvited intoxication, the result of the previous evening's bachelor celebration-- but instead to the role of the ever-patient queue that is American society. Head spinning like a locomotion, the only salient wisp of cognition I had at my disposal was the realization that for all intents and purposes my most time-consuming ""hobby"" was neither music or sports as I had previously considered, but instead the act of waiting blindly in anticipation for the series of events that daily forced their way into my path. Of course, the national fervor with which our culture stands behind demarcated velvet ropes is not without intent or reward: the goal of all this condoned loitering is obviously the inevitable attainment of some worthwhile prize. Thus, the cycle fatefully continues: structured quiescence leading to-- hopefully-- unbridled enjoyment, be it the stagnant vegetation of waiting for the next big-thing's debut, or the lip-biting standstill of witnessed betrothal resulting in either drunken bliss at some tented reception or some hard-earned wedding night play. Trends are not so easily contained by international borders, though: somehow, the American tense-and-ease style of life-- and specifically music-- has imbedded itself directly in the unlikely bosom of Oslo, Norway, deep within the ranks of the Norwegian musical collective Jaga Jazzist, in their latest full-length The Stix. Fronted by the brothers Horntveth, multi-instrumentalist Lars and drum-programmer Martin, the troupe offers an ebb and flow of tight musical compositions derived from such varied influences as free jazz, Squarepusher-drum 'n bass, and Duke Ellington's original big band. ""Kitty Wú"" begins the album with a low, breathy sigh, as a heavy reed mimics a high register tune before evolving into a fully orchestrated and electronically manipulated pulse of breakdown and return. From this, a modal progression ascends through the wind and finally collapses into a treated vibraphone, as the skittering sound of drum 'n bass breaks play constantly in the background, only occasionally rising to the forefront of the track. Eventually, the lazy coda of the composition is picked up anew by the harder-through-comparison ""Day"" and ""Another Day"" suite, the two songs accenting an informal beat, the host to the breezy synth-driven melody. Sounding like a mid-80s Stereolab soundtrack to a black and white Audrey Hepburn film, the tracks highlight the album's peak with a generous tension supplied between instrumental give and take, enjoyable in the same manner as early Tortoise or the most recent Cinematic Orchestra full-length. With the exception of a few minor flourishes of awe and surprise littered throughout the remainder of the album-- for example, the high-end fuzz of the previous Animal Chin EP track ""Toxic Dart"", the nursery rhyme skitter of ""Doppelganger"", and the slow salsa beat of ""I Could Have Killed Him In The Sauna""-- The Stix is unfortunately plagued by the merit of its own complexity and taut instrumentation. This blandness of production and composition often results in leaving the listener with compulsory feelings of neglect between the rare moments when the group actually loosens up enough for the music to sound pleasurable as opposed to forced. Allowing for the inclusion of what appears to be found sound recordings of a distant panting animal and some industrial clatter, ""Reminders"" prompts a promising introduction that initially seems to excuse the above rejoinder, but ultimately falls into a homogeneous and glossy pattern of dense muzak that is nearly as compelling as a trip to the local dry-goods store. Following this outline of polish and glean is ""Suomi Finland"", a gushing mesh of instruments of both acoustic and electronic origin that regrettably succumbs to the group's prominent love of 60s-era spy soundtracks and cheesy synth-programs. ""Aerial Bright Dark Round"" and ""The Stix"" make noble attempts at dredging the rather forgettable second half of the album from its musical muck-- the former yielding its structure to sinister atonal swarms, the latter staggering its melody with a series of sharp electronic pulses-- but, for the sake of the album, it is a case of too little too late. Perhaps it's my overall impatience, but The Stix could benefit from a lessening of the stick in favor of the carrot; an occasional jolt of humanity would endear Jaga Jazzist's songs to heart, rather than pushing us away with the pretensions of this particularly objective slab of instrumental music. Though there's more than enough undisputed talent in this group to produce a series of wonderful albums in the future-- balanced in terms of likeability and technical skill-- for the moment The Stix is the line in the sand I'll wait for Jaga Jazzist to cross.","As a flock of aunts, cousins and grandparents struggled to rouse me from my supine position on the altar steps ...

Tranquil Isolation,Nicolai Dunger,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3513d197565213b01c/1:1/w_160/e08b211b.jpg,2003-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2479-tranquil-isolation/,Overcoat,"Nicolai Dunger's greatest asset is his voice. He's a wholly original singer-- comparisons to Tim Buckley and Van Morrison describe his range, but not his timbre. You can't tell if it's birth, booze or smoking that gave his voice that strained, rough sound, with its patterns of uneven wear; or maybe talent and practice put that craggy edge onto his smooth moans and tuneful wails, insinuating around a lyric and then hitting a note hard, as if he thinks it might hit back. Even his Swedish accent could just be something else that's wrong with his vocal cords. What's most appealing about his new album, Tranquil Isolation, is its stripped-down acoustic setting: more than his past albums, this one is carried mostly by his singing. Even though at heart he's a singer/songwriter, Dunger's music is hard to pin down. He's wandered through many styles, from the lush pop arrangements of his last release (2001's Soul Rush) to the quizzical instrumentals and jazzbo sidemen on The Vinyl Trilogy, three experimental records that sold in the hundreds. Dunger has doggedly veered far enough off-course to evade commercial success; yet the depth of his vocals and the unshakable melodies of his songs stay constant. I've also noticed that my wife has kept this latest record propped on her desk so she can keep an eye on the cover photo, which shows Dunger, standing in a wintery field in a sweater and scarf, pretending not to show off his scruffy blond hair and blue eyes. The guy's got fan appeal, no matter how hard he dodges the spotlight. That may be why the rough edges of this album suit him so well. Dunger made the album with the help of Will and Paul Oldham, the alt-country greats who don't need much introduction in these pages. The Oldhams caught Dunger performing with Mercury Rev and were impressed enough to invite him to their home studio in Shelbyville, Kentucky, where they cut this album in less than a week. Like the title suggests, the record just shifts between three speeds-- easy-going, bluesy, and regular old ""mellow."" But that doesn't detract from the spontaneous sound that the band brings to the music, or how easily they learned how to push their frontman. The blues jam that opens the disc, ""Last Night I Dreamt of Mississippi"", introduces the earthy sound of Oldham and Dunger's guitars ringing alongside each other, while Jessica Bailey's raw-toned violin-- the strongest addition to the record-- buzzes right into Dunger's range. Will Oldham also harmonizes beautifully as he sets his clear voice behind Dunger's gnarled lead. Dunger wrote all the songs (aside from a traditional Swedish folk song), and every one is winningly tuneful. The ballad ""Tribute to Tim Hardin"" glows over a piano that's recorded with a watery nostalgia; that's the only studio trick they deploy on this album, but it's a good one, and that ""sounds of memories past"" effect also works on well on ""Going Home for Christmas"". Dunger doesn't shy away from sentimentality, but he also goes for sadly resigned (the bleak family scenes of ""1st Runaway""). When he lightens up he's tough and witty-- resigning himself to carrying a torch for the girl on ""Hundred Songs""-- and then he breaks out of the mood with the rollicking ""Me, Ray and JR"" (which namechecks Jonathan Richman, though Dunger pronounces it ""Yonathan""). Dunger only falters on the lyrics. The ""go with the flow"" tone of the sessions make the words seem like an afterthought-- like he figured that the band was playing so well that he didn't want to stop them to plan out the words. But with a few exceptions the lyrics seem simplistic, cliched (""Heeeyyyyy mama""), or even bizarre, as on ""Me, Ray and JR"": ""We take the stairs/ With all those layers/ You call it betrayal/ So much for the nailing of dungeons."" Yeah, it sort of rhymes, but a voice like this should get more resonant lyrics. Aside from that, Tranquil Isolation just gets richer with every listen. It's strange enough to throw off many listeners: alt-country fans would expect something starker, while anyone looking for a straightforward adult-alternative singer might've expected him to use something more than a single fiddle to sweeten the album. But that randomness is part of the appeal: that Dunger could play so casually with total strangers and use a thrown-together band in a foreign studio to make a warm and memorable album.","Nicolai Dunger's greatest asset is his voice.

Corrugated Sibilants EP,Cold Sides,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d4b1335d7bf1698efd/1:1/w_160/e7b6daa5.gif,2003-07-28 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1716-corrugated-sibilants-ep/,Cold Sides,"The following is an excerpt from the 2033 novel Super Chunks and Maudlin Beats: The Chapel Hill Story, a narrative chronicling the rise and fall of arguably one of the most productive underground music scenes of the early 21st Century. The chapter in question deals specifically with one of the major catalysts of the college town's re-emergence into the national/international eye-- Cold Sides' self-produced EP, Corrugated Sibilants. CHAPTER 3.: WARM HEARTS AND COLD SIDES Long before the group reached the Rush or Journey level of excess that would plague them in their years of highest fiscal-- yet lowest artistic-- success, Cold Sides was simply a rhythm-driven four piece, the phoenix from the ashes of a previous Polvo-influenced three man incarnation. The two remaining members of that original lineup, Zeke Graves (ex-Three Stigmata) and Robert Biggers (ex-White Octave), would prove to be the backbone of this fleshed out Cold Sides, set to movement by the sheer muscle of newcomers Neill Prewitt on bass guitar and Dave Cantwell on drums. Though it's difficult to separate fact from fiction-- referring to the group's Zeppelin-esque tour story involving a pound of peanut butter, one light-bulb, and an Asian-masseuse-- one thing that can certainly be confirmed upon listening to Corrugated Sibilants is how aware the group was of their contemporaries, and conversely how eager they were to surpass them. It would be easy to find fault with the group if they had simply copied a progression of chords from obvious influences like Television, Mission of Burma or The Fall to name a few, but this would be an unfair and ill informed judgment to level at a band who chose to follow in the spirit of those greats, and not in the footsteps. ""Stretched"" begins with a deceptively upbeat guitar surge that's quickly bent over the knee of No Wave into the angular and detuned melody that follows the song until its finale. A constant and prominent bass line successfully nurtures a call and response between geminating guitars throughout the track, a sound that alternately engages both overpowering hubris and fragile timidity. The dueling sounds ultimately fall prey to the remark of the other though, leaving the sturdy rhythm to force the song forward into a quiet electric diminuendo. Perhaps bolstered by southern-pride, and the paradoxically anti-foppish attitude of post-punk, ""Field Recorder"" was a warm gun pointed directly at nearby east-coast neighbors Fugazi, and the entirety of the Dischord family. Singing that he's ""just an instrument,"" Zeke makes more than a simple lyrical reference to the above seminal band, outfitting a Red Medicine beat over the din of industrial drones, before a skronking James Chance sax takes the mantle with disabling atonal swarms of noise. An example of how painfully aware the quartet was of their time in aural history, the song is actually the sound of a glorious meta-music, the type that only bored ex-record clerks-- who've absorbed countless hours of good music-- can produce well if at all. Finding meaning in the space between notes, ""No Recognition"" is an exercise in extended and often homemade instrumental techniques as well as the mathy-art of the stop/start. Jading a normal pop-tune with brandished guitars, the track exhibits a jangling chorus that eventually subsides into a sparse bridge, the most vacant moment to be found on the mini-album. Eventually this empty space is taken up by humbled tones that signal the return of the dark and repetitive bass line, the portent to the track's inevitable and regrettable end. The final track ""Interiors"" endows its content with just that, as reverberating crashes and pulses establish a vast room-tone that is reinforced exponentially by the across-the-room-and-phoned-in vocals of the chorus, the catchy ""ca-ca-cal-calculate interiors."" From this, a foreign guitar line evolves becoming mated with a simple up-down beat that slowly growls its way through to one last percussive thrust signaling the song's end. A drop in the commercial and creative bucket of Cold Sides body of work, Corrugated Sibilants forebode the talent of what is now acknowledged to be one of the best bands to arise from the 00s Chapel Hill music-scene-- with, of course, the exception being the 2009 Research Triangle Park-sponsored genetic reformation of the original-Beatles line-up circa 1967. That said, it's important to understand that interest in this EP is not founded on the notion that it captures deified brilliance or even unheralded genius, but on how well it archives the sound of a band on the brink of all of that. Though utterly enjoyable in its own right, Corrugated Sibilants banks on those unappreciated and valid enjoyments that antedate the true prize-- such as the anticipation involved in cooking one's own food, or the feeling one gets watching a girlfriend or boyfriend get undressed before imminent coitus. Stated in this manner, it's hopefully not difficult to understand the baited breath with which people waited for the release of Cold Sides' following full-length, and the uproar that it fatefully incited.","The following is an excerpt from the 2033 novel Super Chunks and Maudlin Beats: The Chapel Hill Story, a narrative ...

Even Further Behind,Dave Derby,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb41c0084474cd0c27f8/1:1/w_160/010c6ab7.jpg,2003-07-28 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2507-even-further-behind/,Bad Man,"Even Further Behind-- Dave Derby's solo, post-Dambuilders, non-Brilliantine debut-- is a quasi-desperate explanation of man-to- country incompatibility and perpetual misplacement. As a home, Dave Derby's America consistently fails: it's a place rife with internal conflict, wide, faltering landscapes and fiery east/west oppositions; its myths don't deliver and yield startling anti-climaxes. It's American optimism gone awry, a pulsing mess of searing concrete, fickle girls, empty rooms in Manhattan, Brooklyn moons, and nervous breakdowns in California. Sometimes explicit (see Derby repeatedly cooing ""I'm just bored/ With the U.S.A,"") and oddly evasive, Even Further Behind is Derby's big, throbbing shot at catharsis, a vehicle for lamenting the impossibility of making his America work, of channeling slow, awkward detachment into a collection of soft, round pop songs. With loads of acoustic strumming and tender backing vocals (fold in the occasional lap or pedal steel, keyboard, cello, and violin, contributed by one of Derby's many collaborators), Even Further Behind is based-- at least musically-- on straightforward, time- tested folk-pop principles: opener ""Middle Class Hero"" is a jumpy, half-whispered guitar platform punctuated by tangled vocal melodies, while ""Still Bored"" is a subdued, defeated meditation on apathy, Derby muttering ""If I seem removed/ Does that make it OK?"" over a craggy layer of scraping guitar strings and steady, gentle percussion. There are waves and lulls, verses and choruses, rises and falls-- all the pleasant chords and perfectly keyed singing you'd expect from an earnest, confessional, guy-with-guitar venture. Derby doesn't break this formula often, but when he does creep away from singer-songwriter weeping, it's a compelling and surprisingly convincing leap: ""You're My Plus One"" is a loud, two-minute distorted mess, with Derby's usually temperate vocals becoming lecherous and squeaky, his previously solemn guitar-stroking going brazen and wild. For the most part, each track on Even Further Behind reflects Derby's itchy discord with time and place, flitting from tired to sad to temporarily pissed off-- ""You're My Plus One"", with its fleeting in-your-face growl is the perfect embodiment of a momentary strike back, an adrenaline- fueled, over-before-it-started jab at the air right in front of you. There are some trying quirks. Derby's relentless sentimentality can become tedious (overwrought admissions, unless interrupted by a few bursts of perspective or some compelling skirmishes, inevitably wane), and certain lyrics could use rethinking (""The Dream Is Over"" offers the redundant ""Once I was in love with my one true love,"" while ""You're My Plus One"" has the inexplicable ""UV lights/ Hydroponic entity/ Got a sonic alchemy""). Likewise, Derby's penchant for fading everything out starts to feel lazy by midway through, a gooey cop-out, a quick fix for some otherwise hard-to-write endings; it's a statement of indifference, a songwriting tic that starts to reflect, perhaps unintentionally, the lethargic lyrical content of his songs. Thom Monahan's production is evident. Even Further Behind has the same lulling consistency of other Monahan-produced records-- see recent work by the Pernice Brothers and Lilys-- and the record is infused with an airiness that immediately convinces you of its buoyancy, lets you think it would float in water. Still, there's a darkness skulking here, the often unspoken pressure of being mislaid and disproportioned, a not-quite-definable sense of disparity that messes with things, disabling any chance at complete comfort. Derby doesn't exactly find the perfect way to isolate and translate that tension, but, somehow, it still lurks in the room, wispy and disembodied, long after this record ends.","Even Further Behind-- Dave Derby's solo, post-Dambuilders, non-Brilliantine debut-- is a quasi-desperate explanation of man-to- country incompatibility and perpetual ...

In 2002, Saloon's ""Girls Are the New Boys"" finished as the Festive 50's No. 1, seeing off admittedly light competition from the UK's scmindie bands, the U.S.'s garage rock revivalists, and poll perennials the Fall. That track is the highlight of the Reading, England five-piece's debut album, (This Is) What We Call Progress, on which Moogs and other vintage synthesizers are used to create pulsating pop sounds and invite innumerable Stereolab comparisons. On their debut, Saloon's brand of moody Krautrock is closer to Broadcast, another band oft-compared to Stereolab. Like the Birmingham quartet, there are hints of Teutonic sound, but very little drone and few metronomic rhythms (the key ingredients to Stereolab's pre-Chicago work). On their second album, Saloon are slowly heading for the autobahn exit ramp-- or at least riding toward France-- combining analogue synth and chugging, Neu! guitars on one track, album opener ""Vesuvias"". After that inauspicious start, it seems as if they're digging out of those comparisons for much of the rest of the record, finally hitting their stride with gorgeous centerpieces ""Kaspian"" and ""Dreams Mean Nothing"". Instead of motorik and mechanical beats, it's now delicate melodies, the drowsy yet mellifluous vocals of Amanda Gomez, and the occasional accents of melodica, glockenspiel, and strings that characterize Saloon's strongest efforts. Throughout their lifetime, Saloon have always been rooted in Reading's musical Now, heading the city's ""Happy Robots"" night and serving as curators of a weekend festival of the same name (a moniker also lent to one's of If We Meet in the Future's weaker tracks). In some ways, Saloon is also now embracing Reading's shoegaze past. The circular guitar lines on ""The Sound of Thinking"" or the bubbly instrumental passage in ""The Good Life"" wouldn't be confused with the washes of effect-laden guitar of the early 90s, but they display the textural qualities of the best dream pop. It makes for a more approachable sound, offering embraceable melodies and languid sonics, but ones not sullied by an absence of personality or overemphasis on virtuosity. Happily, the concessions to the band's limited past-- ""Happy Robots,"" a Spanish-language track, the jumble-sale electronics-- are disappearing in favor of more atmospheric mid-tempo tracks, often with Gomez's feathery, Harriet Wheeler-like voice dancing over low tones and shuffling drums. The further away from the 'Lab and into a more organic sound the band goes, the more satisfying their music is becoming. That's not just a matter of freeing themselves from the restraints of their influences, but of honing their own strengths as well.","Venerable BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel's annual Festive 50 listener's poll has been topped by such legends ...

In a Wilderness,Resplendent,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e9b1335d7bf16985cc/1:1/w_160/877edded.gif,2003-07-28 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6892-in-a-wilderness/,Mixx Tape,"Buried in liner notes enclosed in the tin container housing In a Wilderness is a brief exhortation, Princely in its syntax: ""Cling 2 change!"" Right there, you have a summation of the career of Michael Lenzi, the Chicago auteur behind Resplendent, late of the Fire Show and (in the more distant past) Number One Cup. Lenzi adopted the pseudonym M. Resplendent for his time in the Fire Show, a band whose output was limited, but whose creativity seemed boundless. In fact, it seems obvious now that they pushed their music too far too fast-- last year's Saint the Fire Show was a formidable, almost impenetrable sprawl of icy experimentalism and collapsing structure, but it was hard to imagine where they could go afterward, and they splintered rather than enter a cul de sac. Now out on his own, Lenzi continues to change his music, aggressively, and this time pulls back from the brink of total abstraction, dropping a disc of...trip hop? Well, it's not actually trip hop, but it operates on a similar principle, using beats and effects as a launchpad for unorthodox, but fundamentally melodic songs. Several of the tracks he comes up with are really just oddball interludes, like the voices calling through a foggy electronic briar patch in the title track or the just plain jarring juxtaposition of a softly whispering voice and out of synch singing and piano in opener ""Wolf Chorus"". ""Semi Hellbent Tip"" comes on like an evil Beck, with a hip hop chassis and sloppy rhyming that comes in backward and quickly reverses itself to reveal Lenzi quasi-rapping, inexplicably slipping into an almost British accent at times. There's some room for debate as to whether lines like ""Mister mister/ Sister sister/ Cerebral friction givin' be a blister"" and ""who's to say I'm right, honky?"" are supposed to be ironic or not, but at any rate it's a truly unexpected song. It benefits immensely from the screwy horn parts arranged by former Fire Show cohort ES Roth, who also scores a small coup with his trombone chart for ""Lone Vox"", a slow crawl that rumbles along on a deep, fuzzy bass part and some clockwork drumming. There's a George Martin quality to the trombone bit, and it's surprising how well it fits in with the bass and cymbal sludge it's floating in. Lenzi's vocals run quite the gamut, from the freaked out harmonies on ""Pitch & Yaw""-- which closely resemble his histrionic spasms with the Fire Show-- to his low-key, gentle singing on ""Out on the Slicks,"" the aforementioned no-flow rapping, and the sing-speak he adopts for ""Lone Vox"", which true to its title, is the only track where he doesn't double himself. ""Pitch & Yaw"" feels the most like a logical extension of the Fire Show, swinging between a saturated drum and sax duel, a haunting a capella passage and some chime-like electronics imported from ""Kid A"". I said it when I reviewed the Fire Show's last album, and I'll mention it again here: one of the most remarkable things about this music is how dense it feels while employing only a few instruments at a time-- ""Pitch & Yaw"" feels like it's constantly bearing down on you, even when it's just drums and vocals or vocals alone, calling out from inky black silence. Resplendent ultimately can't help being less satisfying than the Fire Show-- there's less tension and a less palpable urgency to the material-- but it's also more approachable, a relatively accessible introduction to the aesthetic that made the Fire Show so fascinating. In a Wilderness covers an astounding array of ground in its half-hour running time, yet still holds together as a piece of work that once again moves Lenzi's creative boundaries in new directions. You have to wonder what he's got in store next.","Buried in liner notes enclosed in the tin container housing In a Wilderness is a brief exhortation, Princely in its ...

Insound Tour Support EP,The Jim Yoshii Pile-UpXiu Xiu,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aacbb1335d7bf1699724/1:1/w_160/848cf928.gif,2003-07-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8822-insound-tour-support-ep/,Insound,"Those who'll tell you that nothing's shocking are, generally speaking, full of shit. Sure, it's tempting to cop a jaded wince and react to everything with calculated disinterest, but in a world where the quiet, seemingly emotionless among us often wind up hanging from the rafters of dank apartments, one has to wonder how many reactions of shock and trauma are silently repressed and denied. We're often taught not to register our emotions, but when those unexpressed feelings finally boil over, the results are virtually always shocking, and it's that simmering combination of rage and terror that often fucks things up in the most horrific ways. Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart is often accused of overblown and dramatic bursts of emotion too intense and terrifying to be considered even remotely sincere. But as anybody who's ever experienced (or witnessed) a full-blown emotional freakout can attest to, it's sometimes the most ridiculous and indulgent moments that are the most wrenching and unbearable. At their best, Xiu Xiu manage to tap directly into this kind of unbearable tension, discomfort, and eventual catharsis, making music that's not always easy to listen to, but that often elicits a reaction much more powerful and disturbing than almost anything else around. On this EP, some of Stewart's best songs to date are pitted against the more conventional melancholia of their Absolutely Kosher labelmates The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up. The EP alternates between songs by the two artists, a strategy that seriously disrupts the flow of each artists' work; compared to Xiu Xiu's unique and confrontational contributions, The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's songs seem tame and inconsequential. If one gets acclimated to the understated moodiness of the Pile-Up, Xiu Xiu's tracks tend to come across as subtle as a punch in the face. Taken separately, though, both groups contribute entirely worthwhile songs. Xiu Xiu's four tracks-- all slated for inclusion on their next full-length-- are some of the most melodic Stewart has ever written. ""Fabulous Muscles"", the standout track and one of the band's best to date, features Stewart singing over acoustic guitar, sparse percussion and plucked strings, offering a chorus of ""Cremate me after you come on my lips."" It's bound to strike some as gratuitously shocking, but the song itself is in fact remarkably subtle; the percussion, though slight, is violent, musically echoing unsettling lyrics like ""Break my face in/ Was the kindest touch you ever gave."" Stewart's vocal performance is powerfully nuanced as he veers from a soft, uncomfortably high croon to a barely contained wail by song's end. ""Little Panda McElroy"" and ""Bunny Gamer"" both make sophisticated use of electronic noises and drum machine beats in juxtaposed order and entropy; the former is a beautiful drone piece with powerfully disturbing undercurrents, mimicking Stewart's lyrics of self-effacing salvation. ""Nieces Pieces"", which appeared in a similar version on Fag Patrol, benefits from the cleaner sonic treatment it receives here, as it builds to a chilling, violent-yet-skeletal finale. The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's contributions to this EP are wrenching in a much more traditional sense, employing repetitious piano figures, whispered vocals, and simple, insistent percussion. Over the course of two albums, the Pile-Up have proven themselves quite adept at creating dark-yet-dynamic songs that benefit greatly from subtle instrumental interplay and well-conceived melodies, and these four songs are no exceptions. ""Seattle"" is the most understated and minimal of the four Pile-Up tracks, making use of a memorable piano part, but the vocal melody seems intrinsically secondary. Chris Walla produced The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's contributions to this EP, and their ""Conversation Stalls"" bears a striking resemblance to his full-time band, Death Cab for Cutie. It's their best offering here, benefiting from gorgeous, clean guitar lines and a ridiculously strong, slinky vocal melody. ""Birthday Cake"", however, falls into pure emo cliché, mentioning mixtapes and Nick Drake before closing with the whimpered lyric, ""I dreamt that I kissed you."" Shortcomings aside, The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's four tracks will be a welcome addition to the collection of any self-respecting lover of sad bastard music. It just seems unfortunate that they have to share the bill with a band that continually manages to lay bare the overdetermined emptiness of ""sad bastard music"" as a whole. Both bands delve into the darker side of human emotion, but where The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up are content to deftly tell of their feelings, Xiu Xiu lay it all out right in front of you, no matter how awkward or uncomfortable it makes you feel.",,8.4,
58:34,Ova Looven,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba329d034d5c69bf53e5/1:1/w_160/f5f93b59.gif,2003-07-27 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6084-5834/,Artikal,"If one were inclined to travel from Boston to Philadelphia-- and every so often one should be- the most economical way is through New York's Chinatown. There are two buses: one from Boston to New York, the other from New York to Philadelphia. On a good day, the layover between shuttle buses only takes about an hour, just about the length of Ova Looven's debut album. Those familiar with the artsy-fartsy album titles of dream-pop past might recall Antarctica's 1997 EP 23:03 or perhaps the band's equally numerical LP from 1999, 81:03-- New York's Ova Looven is Antarctica members Chris Donohue, Glenn Maryanksy, and live-show soundman Steve Depalo. National Skyline's James Minor provides guitar lines for these self-proclaimed \x93electronic-shoegaze alchemists.\x94 And now together, like a comically ersatz Voltron sidelined by its underdeveloped ego, these men have combined their forces to craft 58:34, the slickly produced, affected and emotionally retarded soundtrack for my recent Chinatown layover. Here are some memories: Minute 7:01
Various trinket vendors monopolize precious sidewalk space on Canal Street, selling everything from umbrella hats to flipping elephants to remote control umbrella hats. At one stand is a young boy playing with what appears to be a gold-plated Buddha statue-- it shoots a flame out of its virile member. Intrigued, I pick up another from the table and try to evoke the same flame, but alas, my Buddha is broken and impotent. So, too, are Ova Looven: \x93Invisible Triangle\x94, the song of the minute, is laced with more seemingly emotional lyrics and 80s synth lines than a full season of Miami Vice sound clips. All lines are happening at once, all the time, with nary any build up or collapse in complexity. The effect, as can be expected, is incredibly overwhelming-- kind of like seeing something shoot fire out its plastic crotch. But upon closer inspection, the cheap gold paint gild of synth can no longer hide the boring song structure, and within about a half-minute, the song is out of gas. Like our friend Buddha, the song has blown its load prematurely. Minute 17:37
Chinatown's side streets are home to thousands of video bootleggers; as I made a turn onto one, Ova Looven took a coincidental detour. A respite from the album's otherwise baroque synth overkill, \x93All Gates Opex94 (invoking Can in name, not melody) is in a sense the only song on 58:34 where song writing seems to have come before electronic embellishment. Perhaps because of my surroundings at the time, but the song seemed reminiscent of background music played behind any number of late 80s Tom Cruise love scenes, most especially the one in racecar movie Days of Thunder, a film I bought that very day. Keep in mind that this is the highest compliment I can pay this album. Minute 58:00
As I walk by Popeye's Chicken, a truly incongruous fit in a town of dumplings and hunan steak, the vaguely feminine robot voice from the first track starts talking-- in German. Sweet. We are reminded about \x93das Gedaechtnis,\x94 \x93die Höhle,\x94 and \x93der Cape,\x94 all meaningless hodge-podge which any mediocre German student can tell you is shitty electronica's equivalent to, say, prog rock's fruitless musings on dungeons, dragons, labyrinths, and epic adventures. The rest of the 58:34's lyrics were in English, of course, making this the most pointless use of a German robot voice ever. It's also an unfortunate paradigm for the composition of this album: Ova Looven's musical decisions seem to defer almost entirely to superficial gimmicks akin to any mediocre \x93sophisti-pop\x94 synth band from twenty years ago. Aside from the incredibly slick production which allowed for a clownish number of loops to run at all times, there is nothing that differentiates Ova Looven from its New Order-aping predecessors, who similarly tried to distance themselves from their source by stuffing their songs with synth. Even New Order itself tried to build upon its own foundation with Republic and Get Ready-- not by embracing more electronics, but by concentrating on the song structure itself. Maybe Ova Looven, in a fit of über-irony, is parodying itself, and this is all part of some elaborate Andy Kaufmann-style joke. Whatever their intentions, I know this: it would be a goddamn ironic masterpiece if I ate at Popeye's, the only non-Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Some things are just plain wrong, though. Minute 58:34
As the album fades out, I pass through an alleyway going towards East Broadway. On the roof of one building, there are about twenty or so people drinking brews and watching a movie being projected onto a whitewashed wall of the building directly across from it. What a brilliant thing to do; whoever came up with that idea for a party must be the coolest, best-dressed hipster on the planet. He was on Friendster seven years ago, knew about the Strokes before Fab Moretti was even born, and bought his first camouflage mesh hat way before you did. What a guy. The second thing I thought was this: not even he could possibly garner enough ironic energy to enjoy this perfectly unoriginal effort.","If one were inclined to travel from Boston to Philadelphia-- and every so often one should be\x96 the most ...

Befriended,The Innocence Mission,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96f13d197565213ae5f/1:1/w_160/3a85457d.jpg,2003-07-27 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4104-befriended/,Badman,"The Innocence Mission possess enough precious quirks to effectively repel even the most charitable of corduroy- heavy, cat-owning bookstore clerks: the players met during their Catholic high school's production of Godspell, the band's singer/guitarist and singer/songwriter married not long after, and Karen Peris still consistently employs phrases like ""purity of heart"" to describe the Mission's soft, dulcet sound. But Befriended, the band's seventh full-length since forming in 1986, is pretty far from the unabashedly maudlin whining and sentimental gushes their circumstances suggest. Floating on the crushing strength of Peris' breathy, pitch-perfect coo, Befriended is a bucolic, nuanced bit of Sunday morning coffee-and-wistfulness, lovingly strummed acoustic guitars (augmented by the occasional organ line, sparingly applied upright bass, and light, flickering drums), rolling out time-tested chords with unwavering earnestness, revisiting the sweet, confessional early-70s folk of Joni Mitchell and the late-80s lilt of the Sundays and Cocteau Twins. There's an inordinate amount of walking on this record, even for the acoustic neo-folk circuit: ""Walking around New Orleans/ Looking for a birthday cake,"" ""Now I walk for miles/ Into dark forests of piano songs,"" ""Walking through the world/ Walking under trees,"" ""We walk the whole two miles to Holly,"" or, on the purposefully-titled ""Walking Around"", ""Walking around/ You know I've had enough of this trouble."" And the verb isn't being evoked, exclusively, via lyric nods: musically, Befriended tugs along gently, contemplative and casual, sauntering purposefully but never building to a full-on sprint or, even, anxious trot. Rather than wearying, Befriended's consistent tempo allows for the formulation of a strikingly cohesive record, an extended stroll through an impressionistically- rendered New England autumn, pastoral and occasionally inspired. ""Tomorrow on the Runway"" sees Peris' sometimes childlike chirrup flitting easily from half-obscured whisper to confident bellow, while thick layers of scraped guitar and organ pile up; the slightly less melancholic ""When Mac Was Swimming"" is a sparse, airy piano-and-electric-guitar piece featuring a gently tapped tambourine as the sole percussive. ""Beautiful Change"" is the record's most dynamic cut, with Peris' vocals (here, echoing the Delgados' Emma Pollock) rising and falling dramatically over now- familiar guitar strums. There are certainly distinctions (both thematic and tonal) between each of the record's ten tracks, but Befriended plays best as an extended rumination, a thirty-six minute, singular experience. The Innocence Mission's defining characteristic is their control, and if you can get past any secret desires to tear howling through the studio, knocking down drums and unplugging perfectly-positioned microphones, their restraint can be oddly engaging. Befriended might be comforting and invitingly docile, but it's also a rich, subtly textured record, executed with impressive grace.","The Innocence Mission possess enough precious quirks to effectively repel even the most charitable of corduroy- heavy, cat-owning bookstore clerks ...

Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lakes State,Sufjan Stevens,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57113d1975652138f5d/1:1/w_160/5a4b4307.jpg,2003-07-27 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7510-greetings-from-michigan-the-great-lakes-state/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The first thing to know about Greetings from Michigan, the third album from Brooklyn-based singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens, is that its creator was born there. Few albums more clearly evoke their namesake: Towering pines, highways paved through granite walls, great lakes and deep valleys resonate in its gentle piano, muted trumpets, and close-mic'd production-- which is particularly odd, given that Stevens' home city is Detroit. It leads you to wonder how one could craft an album so delicate from an inspiration its author calls a ""monstrous concrete prison"" which has been ""destroyed by its infidelity."" Certainly, the album is run through with a wistful melancholia, with lyrics that reference the city's dead machinery and empty warehouses. But there's a reason the album's title greets its listeners from the state and not the city: The record is a beautiful, sprawling homage to the self-described pleasant peninsula. Fittingly, Stevens opens the record on a pensive note: ""Flint (For the Unemployed and Underpaid)"" is a lulling, depressive hymn comprised of dew-drop piano and a shimmering backgrounded trumpet. Like Roger & Me, the song focuses on the titular city's impaired economy and empty rust-belt factories, albeit with a more bathetic and singular approach than the everyman journalism of Michael Moore: Stevens softly sings, ""Since the first of June/ Lost my job and lost my room/ I pretend to try/ Even if I try alone."" ""All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace!"" follows, offering the first of only a handful of upbeat tunes. Here, the pace shifts to a sound more informed by the metropolis at the opposite corner of Lake Michigan, echoing the tight, sophisticated arrangements of Chicago's post-rock scene. The lengthier ""Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!)"" follows suit, also invoking a vaguely Sea and Cake-inspired background over which Stevens layers an extensive list of shoutouts to Michigan cities, as well as a warped guitar solo and nice tempo implosions. ""For the Widows in Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti"" is a banjo-led boy/girl bluegrass spiritual, dour but uplifted by the kind of sighing instrumentation Jim O'Rourke made his name on, while the strumming of ""Romulus"" evokes the fragile folk of Eric's Trip and Nick Drake. Here, Stevens' pen most achingly depicts the everyday sadness of muted familial disruptions. The song's narrator remembers his mother distantly: ""Our grandpa died in a hospital gown/ She didn't seem to care/ She smoked in her room and colored her hair/ I was ashamed of her."" Equally beautiful are the sporadically placed instrumentals. If Philip Glass wrote pop songs, they might sound something like these, as Stevens often uses Glass-like patterns as the foundation for his lushly produced, moody indie pop. ""Tahquamenon Falls"" is what I took to be a glockenspiel clocked with a number of mallets and buried within a diaphanous echo of reverb; it varies and shifts slightly for over two minutes before trailing off upward. ""Alanson, Crooked River"" is similar in tone, perhaps using ice cubes or the rims of wine glasses as instrumentation. The mostly instrumental ""Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)"" is a gently repetitious piano piece with whispered notes at the end: The human voices that resound here do so as isolated elements of a winter breeze, not as fully articulated words or thoughts. If Stevens can be at all faulted on Michigan, it's for erring on the side of indulgence, with the occasional track running too long. ""Oh God, Where Are You Now? (In Pickeral Lake? Pigeon? Marquette? Mackinaw?)"" drags somewhat over its nine-minute runtime, though to be fair, it does bloom icily towards the end. Its sleety water crystal feel reminded me of the almost anonymous hoarfrost of mid-period, pre-Kinks-fixated Lilys and the vastly underrated work of the 90s D.C. indie pop band Eggs. On the ebullient eight-minute ""Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head!"", the repetition works: Nowhere else on the album is the Philip Glass influence quite so notable, as its note patterns occur and recur, adding layers and resonance through chance sonic meetings. On ""The Upper Peninsula"", Stevens harmonizes with The Danielson Famile's Megan and Elin Smith: ""I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes.../ I've seen my wife at the K-mart/ In strange ideas, we live apart."" It's this kind of sad observation of the lives of the working class that repeatedly moved me on this album, as Stevens offers both realism and idealization in his portrait. The record is stacked with impressive space for Stevens' shimmering geography, and it manages a melancholy beauty; Michigan is a frost-bound tone poem in which average people live out their victories and defeats with a shadowy, dignified grace.","The first thing to know about Greetings from Michigan, the third album from Brooklyn-based singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens, is that ...

The Unknown Masada,John Zorn,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab2a9d034d5c69bf3f96/1:1/w_160/59cf973f.jpg,2003-07-27 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8923-the-unknown-masada/,Tzadik,"In the early 90s, John Zorn surprised a lot of people, and considering that he was a composer known for sudden, drastic stylistic shifts and pummeling noise-improv, it was a notable accomplishment. However, rather than shock his audience with sonic terror, Zorn took an alternate route: he grew up. His original Masada quartet was a markedly different project than he had ever been involved with before: although he'd recorded straight jazz sessions (News for Lulu, parts of The Big Gundown and Spillane), and investigated the possibilities of Ornette Coleman's classic small group methods in a modern setting (Spy Vs. Spy), he'd yet to really make his mark in jazz. Furthermore, prior to a curious 1992 Naked City track on the Radio LP, he'd never really hinted at any relationship with Jewish music or heritage. Masada was his mature statement in jazz, and his own spiritual signature-- rather than introduce complex, pre-determined compositional and improvisational structures, his new band simply played. The heads were short, often elegant; the solos cutting and fresh; the band performed as if they'd been together for decades, yet always on the edge of chaos. And like all the great jazz units, they were even better live than on record. Arguably, Masada was (and is) Zorn's crowning achievement as a musician. So, here we are, ten years later, and not much has changed. Zorn has released a number of accomplished modern classical pieces, as well as revisiting many of the areas (thrash, exotica) he'd been involved with prior to Masada, but nevertheless, since the quartet's inception, Masada has been his dominant voice. In addition to ten studio records by the band (on Japanese label DIW), his label (Tzadik, Hebrew for a ""righteous one""-- and oddly enough, also having the double meaning of ""chaos"") has presented live recordings, larger ensemble performances of the Masada material, as well as housing a considerable collection of music from a ""Radical Jewish Culture"" of modern composers. Obviously, you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this stuff, though it's clear that if you've grown weary of Zorn's MO over the last decade, you'd best sit tight: it isn't going anywhere. To the composer's credit, he has allowed the Masada repertoire room to breathe. As excellent as the band (also featuring Dave Douglas, Greg Cohen and Joey Baron) was, sets like Bar Kokhba and The Circle Maker did wonders to keep their concept fresh. Those releases introduced new players and arrangements of songs that sounded familiar even if you'd never heard them (one criticism I have of Masada is that due to the immediately recognizable Hebrew harmonic modes Zorn uses, sometimes the music can suffer from a little sameness). To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the band, he's following up on that idea with the Masada Guitars and Voices in the Wilderness CDs from earlier this year. The Unknown Masada is the third in this anniversary series, and features twelve different ensembles performing Zorn's pieces (all previously unreleased) in their own arrangements. Like the previous two, and indeed pretty much all the other Masada-related albums, the performances make all the difference. The funny thing about this CD is that, despite its appeal to anyone who might be curious to hear different takes on the Masada sound, the bands that invariably turn in the most interesting tracks are the ones that already have a lengthy back-history playing the stuff. Most obvious is the fantastic ""Vehuel"", arranged by trumpeter Douglas, and featuring Zorn and Cohen from the original Masada, in addition to Greg Tardy (tenor sax) and powerhouse drummer Ben Perowsky. This group performs the exotica-laden jungle-boat shuffle with force and zeal, sounding like a mini-big band. Tardy and Douglas in particular knock out fantastic, high-energy solos, and the piece points to a possible new avenue for this music with larger jazz groups. Likewise, cellist Erik Friedlander (featured on several Masada releases) leads his Topaz project in a sharp, concise reading of ""Kinyan"". The quartet cuts the odd-meter, angular head to shreds, and Friedlander's graceful, but kinetic solo betrays his mastery of this music. Other performances, like Jamie Saft's raga-trance reading of ""Zarach"", or Fantomas' ""Zemaraim"" sound nothing at all like any Masada tune heretofore. Saft's arrangement in particular seems almost from another scene altogether: despite making his name as one of the pre-eminent jazz organ players in downtown New York, Saft's arrangement is heavy on metal guitar and sludgy, repetitive drums. It's almost as if The Melvins dropped vocals and became a communal trance-rock band, though Saft could have trimmed the length on this tune in order to sustain its impact. UK outfit Koby Israelite offers up ""Herem"", very reminiscent of the ethnic adventures on Mr. Bungle's California, and though the trumpet solo doesn't quite work over thrash guitar it's certainly an interesting idea-- as is Tatsuya Yoshida's (Ruins) noble attempt at making one-man brutal prog out of ""Shofetim"". Julian Kytasty's solo bandura (a traditional Russian plucked-string instrument) performance of ""Kadmut"" lends the somber piece an epic, regal aura that suits its ancient, folkloric feel nicely. Likewise, female vocalist Zahava Seewald leads a small chamber ensemble through the gorgeous, practically romantic ""Shagal""-- far from an avant-garde perspective, her performance sounds of pure Sephardic folk. Not every piece on The Unknown Masada will go down as a classic: violinist Eyvind Kang's ""Belimah"" starts promisingly with a chorus of majestic strings, but dissolves into flat, Beatles-esque background music. Likewise, free-jazz legend Wadada Leo Smith and percussionist Ikue Mori look like a great pair on paper, but ""Demai"" comes out all electro-acoustic atmospherics and precious little to hang onto. Nevertheless, for the most part Zorn's music has yet again proved to withstand the test of time and interpretation. If Masada does indeed go down as his greatest moment, it will be in part because other musicians have run with his ideas and been able to make their own artistic marks with his music. In that sense, The Unknown Masada and the other anniversary series albums are as significant as any release in his canon.","In the early 90s, John Zorn surprised a lot of people, and considering that he was a composer known for ...

Young Liars EP,TV on the Radio,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a838ea9e61561daa577f/1:1/w_160/f086eb25.jpg,2003-07-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8196-young-liars-ep/,Touch and Go,"I'm not a spiritual person, nor am I easily moved by musical sentiment; a sort of innately critical shell forces me to appreciate sincere artistic outpourings from a distance in order to more fully examine them. Critics have to understand and express with seemingly imagined words like ""luminous"" what listeners will often simply feel in terms more like ""awesome."" We're not immune to the ""awesome"" bug, though, and we still discover certain records that not only disarm our battery of well-honed defenses, but raze them to the ground. For TV on the Radio, all it took was Tunde Adebimpe's sterling, gospel-blues croon, a solitary voice multi-tracked into a gorgeous three-part harmony containing multitudes: ""Hear me hailing from inside and realize/ I am the conscience clear."" A rapid, mechanized pulse of clicks lend insistence to his suggestion that time is short: ""We were all weaned, my dear/ Upon the same fatigue."" A massive confluence of factors-- masterful levels, nearly too-crisp production, and David Andrew and Jason Sitek's beautifully translucent arrangements-- conspire to allow Adebimpe's vocals to shine, diffuse and radiant, as the stunning centerpiece of every track on Young Liars. Bands have played up singers in the past, but here, the single-minded focus of every musical element seems designed purely to elevate the vocal melodies out of the realm of the merely ""real"" and into the hyper-real. It's the spirituality and soul of the blues filtered through barbershop harmonies, but accompanied in counterpoint by dehumanized pulses and drones. Without hyperbole, the effect is electrifyingly direct, nearly mesmerizing, and nothing quite like anything else I can recall. Adebimpe and the Siteks are currently only playing AAA ball in the New York PR farm system, but in preparation for their call-up to the Big Show, it doesn't hurt that they've befriended the three-, four- and five-hitters in the Brooklyn All-Stars line-up: Aaron Hemphill (Liars), Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), and Brian Chase (also Yeahs). The guests make their presence known in subtle but unmistakable ways. Zinner's trademark, tremulant surf-waves are the vital undercurrent of ""Staring at the Sun"", while his low-register distortions lay the foundation of ""Blind"" in drugged-out slow motion-- atop Chase's loping mechanics, he creates a grim, plodding backdrop in stark contrast to the chorus' heavenly reprises, compellingly tarnishing the optimism of the gorgeous vocals with just a hint of uncertainty. Adebimpe is plaintive and almost impossibly haunting here, but the jagged tears of Hemphill's guitar, distant enough to sound two studios away, sends the song blissfully over the edge. On this disc, in which every song bears the weighty finality to close, TV on the Radio provide a surreal bonus track: an a cappella cover of the Pixies' ""Mr. Grieves"". Like a streetcorner serenade, it's got all the oooh's, aaah's, handclaps and snaps of classic doo-wop, and yet it somehow remains brilliantly, unwaveringly faithful to the original. As the song spins out its last few seconds, Young Liars ends just as it starts, with such an immediately affecting resonance for which words seem almost unfair, if only because the time needed to consciously process them seems a frustrating juxtaposition to the spontaneity of the connection to something so unique. With this kind of sound, it's telling that TV on the Radio finish by covering one of the most idolized bands in independent music; it's a bold calling card for their upcoming full-length.","I'm not a spiritual person, nor am I easily moved by musical sentiment; a sort of innately critical shell ...

Counterfeit 2,Martin Gore,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe4c0084474cd0c30e7/1:1/w_160/ad3593f2.jpg,2003-07-24 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3625-counterfeit-2/,Mute,"Not unlike his Stateside namesake Al, Martin Gore knows all about being number two. Having served as Depeche Mode's sole songwriter for two full decades (I know-- weird), he appears more or less content with his role as the band's introverted mastermind; Dave Gahan, for his part of the bargain, gets the fame and the occasional overdose. Gore's modesty, as it turns out, extends to his solo outings. It just so happens that his and Gahan's albums came out a mere month apart, which would normally trigger reams of tedious comparison-and-contrast between the band's ""brain"" and its ""voice."" Luckily, Counterfeit 2 pre-empts any such discussion. It's a covers album. That's right, the man decided to maneuver around his one universally acknowledged talent (songwriting), instead lending his thin and dull voice to eleven compositions by the likes of Nick Cave, Iggy Pop and even Kurt Weill. Moreover, he's not even doing it for the first time. That ""2"" in the title is not there for oddity's sake-- it denotes a sequel: the first Counterfeit, an EP, came out back in 1989. This conceit is pretty disarming, you have to admit. For one thing, we can't accuse Gore of trying to sell records. For another, Martin's got a decent taste in other people's music. I can imagine a worse way to spend an hour than listening to intelligently arranged, if antiseptic, versions of ""Oh My Love"" and ""Candy Says"". Overall, from its (genuinely?) self-deprecating title on down, Counterfeit 2 correctly presents itself as a box of hobbyish bric-a-brac for friends and completists. It is on that scale that we should judge it. The one big surprise here: a version of David Essex's ""Stardust"". Less a cover than a rescue operation, Gore's take imbues a piece of glam nonsense with sadness and gravitas. Brian Eno's ""By This River"" sounds most like a Depeche Mode song-- circa Black Celebration no less-- albeit with the obligatory 2K glitchy-twitchy production. This should shock no one, since Eno at his poppiest and DM at their most experimental are almost rubbing elbows (plus, he produced them. Duh). Those searching for the inevitable big blunder, look no further than a pastiche of Nick Cave's crude epic ""Loverman"". Clearly infatuated with the original, Gore forsakes reinvention for impersonation. Picture Cave's trademark bombast (""There's a devil crawling on your floor...Give him more/ Give him more"") and then imagine it issuing forth from Gore's genteel larynx. Bad idea. Needless to say, this is the longest song on the record, clocking in at 7:02. Elsewhere, a Nico cover (""Das Lied Vom Einsamen Mddchen"") and a detour into Kurt Weill fakebook fare better than you would imagine: there was always a vague whiff of the cabaret about Depeche Mode. Now is probably the time to confess that one of my recurring adolescent fantasies was ""DM Unplugged"", with candles, a string quartet, a Johnny Cash cameo on ""Personal Jesus"", Gahan firmly seated in a Gothic chair, and a grinning Gore behind a baby grand. I still think it's a great idea.","Not unlike his Stateside namesake Al, Martin Gore knows all about being number two. Having served as Depeche Mode's ...

Live in Japan,Fennesz,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1689d034d5c69bf295c/1:1/w_160/7b46d198.gif,2003-07-24 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3032-live-in-japan/,Headz,"David Berman tosses off an image in his poem ""The New Idea"" that's been stuck in my head: ""Beauty blew a fuse."" Pulled from the context of the poem, this line gets me thinking about things like Icarus flying too close to the sun or steel-driving man John Henry pounding his way through that mountain to his death. It's a line about power, reach, and limitation. I read Berman's words and imagine an aesthetic experience as an electrical impulse carrying so much energy that somewhere, a breaker is tripped, natural limits are exceeded, destruction ensues, and the resulting jumble shows the opposing forces of, well, life. If I had to describe the music Christian Fennesz is making now with a single line, I could do worse than ""the sound of beauty blowing a fuse."" He started off with other goals. Early Fennesz wound a path through electronic abstraction and then rounded a curve around the time of the Plays single that led to his 2001 release Endless Summer. That record was a breakthrough that pointed the way toward a new fusion of guitar melody processed with the limitless textured noise made available via computer. Listening on the bus home from work today, Endless Summer sounded even more pop than I remember; once again I was humming the title track, which is actually based on some pretty effective changes. I'm told that, on his hard drive, Fennesz has a version of his recording of ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"" with Brian Wilson's vocals added on top; someone should write a vocal song to lay over ""Endless Summer"". Live in Japan documents a single show recorded in February, and it contains several chopped and processed segments of Endless Summer, but Fennesz does a lot more here than just cue tracks. Bits of Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56' 37"" Minus Sixteen Degrees 51' 08"" stream past, there's a remix in there along with some scattered Endless Summer quotes, but Live in Japan is Fennesz in freeform mode, floating from one idea the next and finding the common core of energy in his varied approaches. You really could chart the emotional pitch of this set on a graph, as it begins in the middle, climbs to an early, intense peak, and slopes down for some quiet contemplation before starting for another crest. The word ""symphonic"" comes to mind. Japanese label Headz is billing this particular performance as one of the greatest laptop shows of all time. I am not qualified to address that hyperbole, but I can say that Live in Japan is a very good Fennesz album regardless of how and where it was recorded. Though the prettier aspects of Fennesz's sound appear with some regularity, Live in Japan generally leans toward noisier territory. It's a thick, heavy mix, and there always seem to be spikes of static bouncing against the floating organ chords and acoustic guitar picking. Fennesz has a way of teasing out unexpected sounds from his gear and creating unusual emotional effects. About 2/3 of the way through his set, he constructs a mountain of drone that sounds like the orchestral sweep of Sigur Rós fused with Merzbow, and then, in the shadow of this monolith, he inserts a plucked guitar processed to sound like a harpsichord, imparting an odd medieval quality that feels completely unplugged from time. That this towering and heroic mass slowly decays into the comparatively stark and desolate ""Codeine"", his remix of a track by Ekkehard Ehlers and Stephen Mathieu, is a testament to Fennesz's emotional reach. He wisely concludes his set on this high note and breaks for a moment before plugging back in and working noisier bits of Endless Summer back into an encore. Fennesz's approach with previous records has been to explore a small number of discrete sound ideas in each track and then assemble the varied results into an album. A lot of the fun of Live in Japan comes from hearing how he moves from one sequence into something completely different (surely, time spent improvising as part of FennO'Berg was an influence here). Live in Japan is mastered as one 45-minute track, and though I've never been crazy about this kind of listener coercion (first foisted upon the world with Prince's Lovesexy), it has forced me to consider Fennesz's set as a whole. This record is a finely rendered laptop suite by a master of dynamics and pacing. There are many people making similar music on their laptops at this moment, but very few are as accomplished as Christian Fennesz.","David Berman tosses off an image in his poem ""The New Idea"" that's been stuck in my head: ""Beauty ...

Paper Monsters,Dave Gahan,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe2abf31b7dc7156398/1:1/w_160/15d2453a.gif,2003-07-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3623-paper-monsters/,Mute,"I just had the weirdest revelation: Dave Gahan is Jewish. I've been listening to Depeche Mode for about 13 years now, alternating between fandom and bemusement, and the thought had never occured to me. But one look at Gahan's debut solo alubm (with its unmistakable, Viradon-toned Anton Corbijn cover photo), and I suddenly recognized a fellow son of Israel. It's a good photograph. One of the premier prettyboys of the 80s, Gahan looks defiantly middle-aged here-- the jowls sag a bit, the corners of the mouth took a mournful turn downward. He looks like he should at this point: a man with 22 years' celebrity and six minutes of clinical death behind him. He also looks like a rather prototypical Jew. Why the hell am I making a point of this? Well, it's quite indicative of the album's contents. Like many solo outings by career frontmen, Paper Monsters is autotherapeutic: Gahan wants to share something about himself. It's just another level of self-mythologizing, sure, but it does yield interesting information-- sometimes not in the ways intended. The first thing we learn is that Dave doesn't really like synthesizers all that much. The most prominently featured instrument on Paper Monsters is, oddly enough, slide guitar. Its presence here nears Bonnie Raitt levels, coating most solos and even providing ambient beds. The songs themselves, meanwhile, are two-thirds smoothly crooned ballads over one-third lacquered rock shuffles-- all closer to the digi-soul of *Songs of Faith and Devotion than the IDM aspirations of * Exciter. Fair enough: much like the Eurythmics, Depeche Mode were never a true electropop outfit. They were, and are, a gospel-tinged classic rock band that happened to favor au courant arrangements (as the legend goes, the boys switched to synths so as not to disturb neighbors during early rehearsals). Gahan opens Monstersin full masochistic mode. ""Dirty Sticky Floors"" is both the album's designated hit single and its most humble moment: by the end of the first verse, the protagonist is already on the titular floor ""praying over the porcelain throne."" After two timid ballads in a row-- ""Hold On"" and ""A Little Piece""-- Gahan is seized by another bout of picturesque wallowing. ""Bottle Living"" is a classic blues shuffle, not even transposed into a more British minor key (which ""Personal Jesus"" was). Over earnest guitars and low-moaning harmonica, Gahan roars ""He's living for the bottle,"" evidently recalling his own adventures in alcoholism from the safe remove of the third person. By the next song, ""Black and Blue Again"", Dave's confessions take on a tinge of a master-and-servant game: Gahan might, just might, get off on self-flagellation, with the audience as the unwitting dominator. Regardless, there's a great middle section that finds him belting, simply, ""I'm not very nice"" over a string crescendo. Gahan's vocal can still elevate the dumbest lyric to the level of a cathartic mantra, a skill that comes handy in the absence of Martin Gore. ""Stay"" and ""I Need You"" are unfortunately not a two-part Lisa Loeb cover. The former is another simple, pretty ballad that brings the album's average BPM to about 90. Its chorus, once again, flirts with the pathetic: ""Stay/ You can leave tomorrow"" paints the singer as the whinier half of a fling. The latter toys with an inversion of that sentiment-- ""you'll always need me much more than I need you,"" goes the lyric-- but the song still ends on a note of puppy-eyed yearning. Paper Monsters succeeds in revealing the ""new"" Dave Gahan, and that's what makes it a faintly embarrassing listen. Whatever the motives, it reduces a Don Juan to begging for a pity fuck.","I just had the weirdest revelation: Dave Gahan is Jewish. I've been listening to Depeche Mode for about 13 ...

Phantom Power,Super Furry Animals,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21cc0084474cd0bff84/1:1/w_160/2c7e9940.jpg,2003-07-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7600-phantom-power/,XL,"Six albums deep into their career, Super Furry Animals have world-built an entire mythology of Welsh mysticism, Beach Boys homages, and Pete Fowler's bubbly cartoons to such a point that slipping into Phantom Power comes as a comfortable, pleasant exercise. To some, comfortable may counted as a weakness-- for those who wear their bands like fashion, balling up inside Super Furry Animals' farmer-spun wool sweater won't compare to the Issey Miyake-esque bands peacocking down the runway in a loose web of spangles, layers of veneer, and sprigs of feathers. SFA are past forcing outwardly cool, past design and into craft. This is a warm album you'll want to hang in your closet for a damp day. The third interior panel inside Phantom Power's liner notes shows a Fowler image of a tired, collapsing horse in burnt oranges and blues. It's a striking tribute to the cover of the Beach Boys' overlooked masterpiece Surf's Up; instead of the slumping Geronimo, a spectral wisp winds around the mare. Though Phantom Power takes its title from the Bush-trimming chrome-plated stomper ""Out of Control""-- in reference to both a stormy zeitgeist and the U.S. leader's simultaneously world-threatening and vaporous personality-- it could just as easily reflect the spirits of American legends The Byrds and the Beach Boys which charge the album. This dichotomy is what makes the album so fascinating-- Super Furry Animals rail against the ""gulf of misery"" created by America (snowballing seas ""painted red by bleeding army""), yet more than ever invest their efforts in honey-dipped California harmonies, Mississippi mud slide-guitars, and snapping Stax drumming. The record is living testament that our nation's greatest contribution to the world will be our music. Super Furry Animals never settle into one mood here, and Phantom Power sees the down-to-earth Welsh band moving away from genre-hopping and rough juxtapositions, and beginning to blend their influences into an evenly spread melange that simply sounds like a highly evolved pop band. The final third recalls their wildest forays into world and electronic music, without sounding apart from the whole. ""Valet Parking"" runs bossa nova down an open autobahn. ""The Undefeated"" steals enough ketamine to finish off that Surf's Up horse, melts down, and gets crunk with hillbillies in the lost Black Ark studio before bursting with horns and, literally, machine guns. Before long, bouncing globes of synth have sprung into sweeping strings on the stunning closer, ""Slow Life"", before segueing into swirling technopop and back again. But back to the beginning: ""Liberty Belle"" sees Gruff Rhys topping himself in pure songwriting with a simply lovely, brilliant song about, well, everything that's happening right now. The lyrics work so wonderfully in repeating geographic and avian themes, as Rhys sees birds' fight-or-flight defense mechanisms in cities around the world-- like seagulls suddenly taking to the sky in Abu Dabai-- as a warning cry to mounting global trouble. After repeatedly telling us we're ""drowning in [our] oil wells,"" Rhys relates that imagery of birds fleeing trees in danger to ashes rising in New York City, past ""the grimy clouds above New Jersey, past the kids who smoke like chimneys, to the sea."" It's the most colorful, tragic, witty, and beautiful passage written about 9/11. In typical SFA fashion the next song is called, rather jokingly, ""Sex, War, and Robots"". Upon first listen, ""Venus & Serena"" sounded like a ballad drawn from the resentment of two sisters forced by a conniving father from a young age to enter competitive tennis. After reading the liner notes, it turns out to be about a boy raised by wolves whose two closest friends were pet turtles. Go figure. But this is what makes Super Furry Animals so enjoyable-- you never get what you expect, and even then the results are layered musically, emotionally, and lyrically. This is the most richly melodic, inviting album they've recorded. Gruff Rhys' voice doesn't have that to-the-back-of-the-arena power that so many angstful singers seem to rely on, which pushes him into more rewarding harmonies and melody, much like Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, who were never going to be confused with Sam Cooke, but still managed to write ""Artificial Energy"" and ""Get to You"". Like the Beach Boys, The Byrds were an ideal collective. And with other members singing on ""Sex, War, and Robots"" and the b-side ""Blue Fruit"", Super Furry Animals sound that way more than ever. In case you still doubt the connection, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, to which Phantom Power best compares, also features a horse on the cover. The mythos of the American West remains a potent signifier for nostalgia, hardship, and bloodshed. Forty years ago this was best exhumed with cowboy iconography. These days it can be done musically through the two ultimate American West pop bands, and it's what Super Furry Animals are after. If Phantom Power sounds like a tame record to your ears in comparison to the Furries' past extroverted wackiness, dig between the mesas to find the bones, blood, and booze.","Six albums deep into their career, Super Furry Animals have world-built an entire mythology of Welsh mysticism, Beach Boys homages ...

What the Day Was Dreaming,Maquiladora,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a8ea9e61561daa7f8a/1:1/w_160/e19b4e2f.jpg,2003-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5100-what-the-day-was-dreaming/,Darla,"The great comedian Louis Black once theorized-- in a characteristic fit of high blood pressured rage-- that being a weatherman in San Diego is the easiest job in the world: ""It's gonna be...nice,"" is about all you'd ever have to say, he commented, and every time I check San Diego on Weather.com, he appears to be right. Maybe I'm just checking on the good days, but it always seems to be about 70 degrees and sunny there. As I type, it's 69 and partly cloudy. My college friends from San Diego even suffered like crazy in the Boston winter. Given the situation on the ground, I'm not sure what's got the three guys in Maquiladora so down. Maquiladora refer to what they do as ""desert rock,"" which only really makes sense in that San Diego isn't too far from the desert. Let me tell you, desert rock is a friend of mine, and this ain't him. Friends of Dean Martinez, Calexico, Rainer Ptacek-- that's desert rock; I'm getting no inkling of thousand-year-old sagebrush, burrowing gerbils or wind-rippled dunes from What the Day Was Dreaming. 'Course, these guys are free to call their music whatever they want, and though it may sound like 100% lo-fi dirge to me, I guess the image of a deserted town is a fairly appropriate one. The slowly shifting background textures (including some fascinating guitarwork by Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata) in ""Heartbroken"" could be the wind creaking through some untrodden alley, just as easily as the crippled steel guitars, xylophones and pianos that litter the album could signify rusting cars and rotting fences. What the Day Was Dreaming (the band's fourth overall, but only the second widely available in the States) is frequently evocative-- the melodic bass and gently sung da-da-da's of ""Dr. Said No"" are inviting, the way humid night air feels when you leave an overly air-conditioned building. Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins (who also ran the boards on this recording) contributes some spooky saw to closer ""Liam"", a song that spends nearly its full duration retreating from standard forms, but that still feels haunted and empty. Evocative's great, of course, and it's wonderful when a band really draws you into the mood of their album, but a record that's all mood can wear off pretty quickly. None of these songs present their melodies distinctly enough for them to make a lasting impression, which is a shame, really, because by the time minute #60 rolls around, they've likely lost you completely, despite any number of striking moments along the way. ""Drunk & Lighting Fires (A Waltz)"" feels brilliant when it's playing, an elegantly wasted guitar grind of funereal indie rock topped with discordant horns, but when it's over, it's really over-- the next song, yet another with a hanging sense of sameness and anonymous malaise, easily wipes it from memory. Even when Maquiladora come close to developing a really good hook, like with the guitar part to ""Kiss Over"", it could always be sharper, and that's Maquiladora's ultimate failing. What the Day Was Dreaming is full of arresting moments that release you just when they're about to get a confession from you, and at a full hour, you're almost guaranteed to take a break from it somewhere along the line. 2002's Ritual of Hearts actually did a better job of insinuating itself with the listener, and remains the album to go to first if you're interested. But while Maquiladora prove themsleves able crafters of atmosphere here, it's going to take some more developed songs to make them anything more.","The great comedian Louis Black once theorized-- in a characteristic fit of high blood pressured rage-- that being a weatherman ...

Bilious Paths,µ-Ziq,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c6b1335d7bf169936e/1:1/w_160/da730277.gif,2003-07-23 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8326-bilious-paths/,Planet µ,"It's always a joy to find out the music I'm jamming to was reported dead months ago. You know how it goes: you pick up a record, give it a few spins, run out to tell all your friends about it, and BAM! ""Dude, wake up, nobody listens to that anymore."" Apparently the only crime worse than listening to out-of-date shit is not realizing it's out of date. For non-hipsters, it can be pretty confusing, especially in fields of music (like electronica) that tend to move through ""periods"" quickly; it's often hard to tell when an artist or genre has truly passed their peak, or is merely the scapegoat for the newest sound, made to appear passé, when in fact they may not have even broken through to many people in the first place. Needless to say, very little of this has to do with the quality of the actual music-- you've probably been the recipient of more than one misleading recommendation wherein the criteria seemed to be based on little more than the sparkling shine of new product. In IDM, over the past couple of years, some people might argue the opposite is happening: good music is being trampled upon for no better reason than the changing of the seasons. This phenomena is hardly unique to music, or even art, but does make it harder to spread the word about cool tunes. London's \xB5-Ziq (Mike Paradinas) has done his share to advance the cause of electronic dance (or otherwise) music since his 1993 debut Tango N' Vectif and astounding follow-up Bluff Limbo, both released on Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James (aka Aphex Twin)'s Rephlex label. As one of the first of a group of musicians (also including Aphex, Seefeel and later, Squarepusher) incorporating experimental touches into straight-up jungle and techno, Paradinas has never been afraid to step out of the box. He further proved this on 1994's remix project with The Auteurs, wherein his results bore little resemblance to the English indie-poppers' originals. Lunatic Harness (1997) is usually brought up as his best release, and is arguably his first to really nail the synthesis of straight drum n' bass, experimental ambient and a kind of future-pop that relied as much on deft, tricky synth lines as it did samples. Bilious Paths expands on this formula, even if it doesn't drop anything drastically new. If you're looking for a fresh start on Bilious Paths, by all means skip the first couple of tracks. ""Johnny Mastricht"" is hyperactive, completely saturated jungle: the template hasn't really changed much in almost a decade, but as \xB5-Ziq is one of the people who pushed it into more adventurous realms than mere breakbeats, he's entitled to dwell. ""Johnny Mastricht"" has a lot more going on (check those telephone samples and the myriad of synth lines) than Paradinas' earliest stuff, and if you're just needing a noisy jam fix, it has you covered. ""Meinheld"" cuts to the chase: imagine drum 'n bass translated as ""drum solo with ornamental coloring."" There are some nifty, faux-Apocalypse Now synth textures here, but the real show is clearly the artist's way with a break. He puts on an impressive display, but if you're wanting him to reinvent the wheel, you may want to look elsewhere. For me, the highlights are the points where Paradinas either steps away from his table of 1000 breaks, or manages to obscure his moves well enough that it's more fun to let it blast than dissect the drum tracks. ""Siege of Antioch"" begins as a chirpy computer crash, but soon explodes into a cyclical lightning strike synth line, under which his bass drum does considerable damage. Shards of jagged metal bounce from one side of my stereo to the other, and for a moment I'm distracted enough not to notice he's injected a solemn chord cluster in the background. For a time, the song goes by in two keys at once-- disorientating, but of a pretty fascinating position to be caught in the middle. ""AEC Merlin"" keeps the off-center effect, but this time it's closer to nausea: the BPM is still up there, but \xB5-Ziq does a nice job of keeping things calm (if queasy) with a masterful, gray-toned synth line-- the kind that Autechre gave up on a few years ago (and BoC took to the bank). It's just able to tie together the otherwise jittery, chaotic beats. Of course, he has those covered as well on ""Grape Nut Beats, pt. 1"", going out to all the epileptics he's loved before. And yes, there are some downers here (especially the entirely goofy, nerd-hop of ""On/Off""); Bilious Paths is probably not a record that's going to hold off a movement against IDM, but it is certainly not without its merits. It's nothing shocking for \xB5-Ziq fans I guess, and it would be hard to argue he hasn't beefed up his sound over the years. The best parts of the record are as cool as anything else going on in my listening room recently, and in the end, that's probably as good a recommendation as I could give you.","It's always a joy to find out the music I'm jamming to was reported dead months ago.

From Tokyo to Naiagara,Tujiko Noriko,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c427eb335119a49ed8a3/1:1/w_160/5eb2a02e.jpg,2003-07-23 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5835-from-tokyo-to-naiagara/,Tomlab,"Thus far, there's no catchy genre name for music like Styrofoam, Solvent's indie-pop cut-ups, Ulrich Schnauss's less techy work, Pulse Programming vocal tracks, or Schneider TM's cover of ""There is a Light that Never Goes Out"": chilled-out bedroom types working in the idiom of abstract electronics (i.e., patching and processing beats and samples on their computers), but writing songs like sappy indie kids (i.e., with shy vocals, sleepy melodies, and ""real"" instruments). The closest thing to a nametag, ""laptop folk,"" seems left over from the critical orgy around Mum, and it's far more evocative than accurate. The fact that no one's pushed to define this stuff as a coherent genre doesn't surprise me. For the most part, the trend feels too natural to turn into an event; it's been bound to happen since the first day IDM albums started sharing CD-changer space with indie bands-- or even earlier, when post-rave and ""post-rock"" came thinkily together with bands like Seefeel and Disco Inferno. It's also too broad: the artists may be connected by the processes they employ or the labels they record on-- Germany's Morr Music chief among them-- but their backgrounds, intentions, and the range of their results seem wildly varied, bordering on rock, pop, dance music, and abstract electronica on so many fronts that it seems silly deciding who ""counts."" Writing studious pop songs with computers? That needs a name? Add to that the big secret-- that a lot of this stuff has just been too obvious, or too boring, to deserve a tag. A lot of it, in fact, sounds suspiciously like the same old indie songs with some timid IDM sequencing running behind them. Styrofoam's decentish I'm What's There to Show that Something's Missing, for instance, sounds like a bunch of Ida songs done over all click-and-pingy: not nearly a bad idea-- fans of the Postal Service will like it-- but not exactly a surprise, either. If the standard name-drops in this field were anything like Tujiko Noriko, it'd feel a lot more like a notable development-- only we'd never start dreaming of a genre, because they'd all be far too idiosyncratic. Noriko, you see, is near-religiously fascinating and spell-casting, even when she's treading the line on boring; compared to a lot of those studious-looking Europeans, Noriko's work is remarkably disconnected from the usual approaches to laptop software and pop songwriting. Where people like Styrofoam make music that's pretty exactly the sum of its parts, Noriko mostly sounds like she's using different parts altogether, and the result feels like something Björk might hear in one of her druggier dreams. It's a strange image she draws forth, even more so on From Tokyo to Naiagara than on her first full-length, Make Me Hard, released by Mego, a label mercilessly dedicated to the glitchiest of glitch experimentalism. This record has her moving to the pop-friendlier Tomlab, and doing some deglitching in the process. The mental picture isn't of a bald-headed guy leaning intently over his laptop; Noriko's sine-wave musicality feels more like someone sitting down at a piano to let loose a starry-eyed sob of a song (and she does, indeed, seem to be playing a lot of organ around her squelchy sine-wave bumps and whirs). From Tokyo to Naiagara is all about that type of real-life real-room hush and stillness, the same feeling as paying careful attention to your breathing: the songs unfold slowly from the most abstracted of places, taking shape serenely around Noriko's heavy sighs. It's that voice, and its inextricable relationship with the songwriting, that are the keys here. Noriko's remarkably clear, unprocessed singing-- its soul croons and brief pronouncements, and the almost discordantly close harmonies she wraps them into-- seems, at first, almost aimless, the melodies winding around too subtly and complexly for a single melody to stick in your head after it's passed. Sometimes this is actually the bad thing it sounds like-- ""Tokyo Tower"" doesn't move any more than the real thing-- but more often it's just an amazing drifting preface to liftoff: not unlike Thom Yorke's wandering moans for Radiohead, the lines all eventually rise and converge into a big oceanic exhalation. It'd take a lot of these runs over the climax of ""Pyramid Song"" any day. See ""Rocket Hanabi"", where a bursting drum loop, superlow bass booms, and dream-state organ fizz all gather up into one of the record's many sky-sized swoons; it's what I imagine it would sound like if Boards of Canada teamed up with Nivea, or at least Miho Hatori. See ""Tokyo"", where an almost rhythmless abstraction of mismatched hissess and clunks arranges itself into a dubby slink (what I imagine it would sound like if... Autechre teamed up with Tweet? Nevermind). See ""Kiminotameni"", then, the most traditionally-constructed of the bunch, which takes a simple bass pulse and airy hums to wash out and watercolor a sleepy-dream echo of synth-pop; see the big swoon on ""Zipper"", which trips out like a de-growled Bjork before unleashing a total shivering killer of a ""la-la-la"" backup. It's all very heavy-lidded-- your head bobbing in aquatically-slow motion-- and it offers little in the way of things like chord progressions and melodic developments, opting instead for the grammar of floaty tones and buzzy tweaks assembling themselves and cresting upward. It's easy to get lost, disoriented, and yes, for many, possibly bored, but all this is just gorgeous, and not in any cute-and-pretty way: Noriko just might be sobbing and wailing. I would say it's worth the trouble of working your way inside this little world and finding your way around, but getting inside isn't trouble at all: it's lovely.","Thus far, there's no catchy genre name for music like Styrofoam, Solvent's indie-pop cut-ups, Ulrich Schnauss's less ...

Killball,Friends Forever,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be70c0084474cd0c2eb0/1:1/w_160/42bf3fa9.jpg,2003-07-23 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3264-killball/,Load,"Reveling in their attempt to reanimate the lost soul of rock-n-roll, the colorfully named and elaborately dressed scamps in Denver's Friends Forever collaborate fitfully on the splattered Fluxus games of chance they've disguised as deconstructed western sludge. Already the subject of feature-length documentary bearing the band's name, the trio's substantial conceptual baggage could be a plus or a minus, depending on how many guffaws you enjoy with your guitar solos. To be fair, some of their exercises are interesting. For one, Rudy Bloody, Wizard 333, and Cunt avoid playing shows in clubs; instead, they break down the touring system and kick-it sweaty and suffocated through multi-hued stoner rock in parking lots, crammed into a smokey Volkswagen van. And in 2001-- cribbing from the Oulipo Compendium-- they attempted to record 300 non-repetitive LPs of at least 30-minutes over one year; they shot themselves in the foot when deciding to disallow jamming and only managed to spit out 137 full-lengths, one of which includes the twelve-tone-friendly ""Schoenberg Study in Metal"". Following this trajectory, Killball-- the band's first full-length for Load-- is another concept piece and quite lovingly dedicated to the Denver Broncos: ""Killball details an ultra-violent future where games are played to the death. Killball is similar to American football circa 1920-2016, except the players wear no pads and are given PCP to ensure a grizzly game. Each player is equipped with a switchblade and a machete. To be tackled is to be destroyed."" More Beavis than Baldessari, more Butthead than Beuys, the twelve screeching tidbits on Killball act out just such a game, and the resultant 27 minutes and 55 seconds sound akin to American Gladiators cast members caressing the asses of the very confused Melvins, who find themselves acting as beguiling heavy-metal cheerleaders. Dealing in husky noise similar to that of Harry Pussy or Crank Sturgeon, but with the ha-ha gag reflex of Happy Flowers and GodWeenSatan-era Ween, the tone's set from the opener, ""Carnisaur Vs. Unicorn"". In its 1 minute and 11 seconds the Carnisaur is hyped-up as being like steel, while the Unicorn receive props through brassy shouts of ""unicorn power."" The track itself is basically a low fidelity take on the obnoxious ""Are You Ready For Some Football?"" warm-up you half-watch prior to televised NFL games. And then the games begin: The second track, ""Win"" has repetitious bass, synth, drums, and lots of cymbals: The Fucking Champs playing along to Dire Straits' ""Walk of Life"" video with swirls of Devo chucked throughout. ""Linebacker Blitz"" opens with shouts of ""go go go go"" and is less like a blitz, more like a drum circle of zombies referees whistle and loud spectators popping and locking with an ""ooh"" and an ""ah."" Perhaps they're doing squat thrusts? Regardless, it reminded me of the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. There's a shift at the end, too, which brings about more shouting and something that sounds like a group of people tackling a microphone. A stronger track, ""3 Peat (March to the Locker Room)"" has lots of fast drums that stop quickly like, wince, Anal Cunt, until guitars feedback and take themselves apart. Here, bass and drums creep along like robots while guitars act as descending fireworks or adrenaline leakage. The big tonal switch on Killball comes with ""Halftime Band""; here the crowd goes crazy for the wacky band's out-of-tune horns and whistle. It's glue-sniffing goodness, a sodden march reminiscent of off-kilter appropriation of popular songs by King Frog and Weird Al. That's just a portion of the first half. The second brings us what sounds like King Diamond leading a wave, a song for John Elway, crippled Monster Magnet, people shouting about yardage, a Clinic-like two minute warning complete with vocal feedback and missile launchers, and the approximation of sonic PCP. The last track, ""Winners"" features fans pealing-out ""yeah, yeah, woo, woo, yeah"" between speakers, making the stereo peak-out. So, yeah, the narrative's not much; though it for real made me want to go check out a young and suave Burt Reynolds in The Longest Yard. Adept at twisting interesting layers of sound and choking out some fervid polyrhythms, Friends Forever could perhaps one day exist nicely outside of the silliness, but for now the band seems pretty unrepentant about affixing a punch line to just about every saturated moment. Unfortunately this particular theme got a bit grating before the work turned into anything substantial.","Reveling in their attempt to reanimate the lost soul of rock-n-roll, the colorfully named and elaborately dressed scamps in Denver ...

La Musica Negra,Verbena,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a942c0084474cd0c0fde/1:1/w_160/80a744dd.jpg,2003-07-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8446-la-musica-negra/,Capitol,"There's a recent online interview with Verbena front-man Scott Bondy where he bemoans the constant use of the word ""grunge"" to describe his band's sound, and a quick Google of the phrase ""Verbena grunge"" does yield 450 results (make that 451). But that's bound to happen when you record an album with Dave Grohl, and every Foo Fighters interview circa Verbena's last album (In the Pink) proved Dave all too willing to invoke the mystique and grandeur of a Mr. Cobain in describing Bondy's particular musical talents. Verbena doesn't do themselves any favors by leading off this album with a referential riff-fest that mimics the current grunge torchbearers, Queen of the Stone Age. Over a confluence of sturm and drang highly reminiscent of Songs For the Deaf's opening salvo, Bondy drawls and preens through a minefield of klutzy nods to various bands (""Let the good times roll/ Down in my rabbit hole/ I've got my Mexican radio/ Me and my rubber soul""-- see also the 2nd verse's mention of a ""19th nervous breakdown""). Even the title (""Way Out West"") offers a not-so-sly wink towards the rock canon-- it happens to also be the title to a Big Star song. Despite the dubious and derivative nature of this track, it manages to make itself enjoyable enough: if you're able to listen to it with virgin ears, untainted by a priori musical knowledge, all the better. If only the rest of the album were this eager to please. Instead, the majority of La Musica Negra would have listeners believe Verbena is forgoing the flannel, flange, and pop-friendly self-flagellation of the 1990s for a dive into the gloriously murky and muddied waters that birthed the stuff of Seattle's musical infamy-- Jimi Hendrix in the red house, CCR sailing the green river on the Proud Mary, Black Sabbath's snowblind paranoia. Yeah, I know I forgot to include the garage rock & punk rock influences as part of what made the Melvins and Mudhoney and the better-known Washington State exports worth remembering. Thing is, Verbena forgot, too. Starting with ""Killing Floor (Get Down On It)"", and continuing on until the next to last track (""Rememberer""), Verbena plod down an irredeemable path that finds the group doing their best to bore the pants off us with super-produced, blues-infected sprawl (and by ""blues"" I mean the cream of the crap that contemporaries and disciples of Stevie Ray Vaughn have foisted onto the listening public-- a little stiff shuffle, a little staggered swagger, a lot of mousy mewling). Bondy's particular mewling vaguely recalls the shredded pipes of hard rock stickmen like the Black Crowes' Chris Robinson (AKA He Who Would Be Otis Redding) and Buckcherry's Josh Todd (AKA He Who Would Be Chris Robinson), albeit without the power and propensity to shriek. However, in trying to sound tough and dangerous and drunker than drunk (like any hard rockin' singer dood should, duh), he comes off as bored and listless. In one instance (""I, Pistol""), Bondy's threat ""never mess with me"" brings to mind the lackadaisical mumbling of Oasis' Liam Gallagher. Sometimes they're fast (""It's Alright, It's Okay""), sometimes they're slow (""Camellia"", ""Ether""), but without a doubt, they're consistently interminable. As if this half-ass bastardization isn't enough, the lyrics kick it to another level of absurdity by dropping Jesus, his pop and the bad guy often enough that one might think the Catholic church are shilling a nice chunk of change Verbena's way for all this free press. It's as if the group thinks that giving lip to the man upstairs might grab them some face time with Mr. Satan at the crossroads for a chance to get some of the stuff Robert Johnson got. Sprinkled on top of this crusty confection are song titles that crib from porn flicks (""Devil in Miss Jones""), indie flicks (""It's Allright, It's Okay (Jesus Told Me So)""-- a line prominently featured in American Movie: The Making of Northwestern-- and good old punk zines (""Me and Yr Sister"", ""White Grrls"") to add a little unearned counter-culture flavor to these bland proceedings. Verbena even includes a bit of Kurt Cobain vocal idolatry in ""Rememberer"", just so folks can remember the very thing Verbena wants them to forget. Producer Rob Schnapf (renowned knob-twiddler on bright & shiny albums from Elliot Smith, Guided By Voices and Beck) does a fine job of giving this slop a modern rock sheen-- check out the fierce introduction to ""It's Alright, It's Okay""-- but tying a pretty bow on a pig doesn't keep the damn thing out of the mud. To make themselves look even worse, Verbena closes the album with ""Dirty Goodbyes"", a gentle ballad featuring brushed drums, piano, and Bondy singing in an unaffected, casual fashion. The addition of doubled vocals and theremin are an obtrusive reminder of the album's ""professional"" production values, but this track still outshines everything else on this record by a wide margin. It offers tantalizing hints of what could have been were the band not dead set on coughing up a collection of brittle, craggy debris and passing it off as ""rock music.""","There's a recent online interview with Verbena front-man Scott Bondy where he bemoans the constant use of the word ...

You Are Dignified EP,Silkworm,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fe13d1975652138beb/1:1/w_160/74336718.gif,2003-07-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7156-you-are-dignified-ep/,Touch and Go,"The acoustic guitar is due a reinvention, if only to stave us music-typists off of lazily referring to plinked projects as ""porchy."" Yes, it sucks that anyone strumming on their stoop is fair game to be mocked by some a-hole in a Talon (""Dude! 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn'! Thass tight!'), but even You Are Dignified, the new tone-frisbee from one of the most enduring loud jumble-rock bands, reeks of, you know, screen doors and skeeter carcasses. The acoustic-equals-porchiness stigma is, reckon, a result of the weird arc fabricated by the prominence of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, an arc that runs through Guthrie's populist sloganry, through Dylan's self-consciously throwbackian Basement Tapes, and through the work of sundry ensembles with either ""Brothers"" or ""Family"" in their name (Palace, Pernice, Radar, Danielson, Handsome, etc.). Rather than cover a bunch of traditionals, or garnish modern classics as Crooked Fingers did on Reservoir Songs, Silkworm's divaless trio descended into Tim Midgett's basement and belted out five tracks by their pals (two by their Touch and Go labelmates, the canny synergists; students of balneology will find a whole lot of backside-washing going on). Given the tiki treatment, Shellac's ""Prayer to God"", that almost inhumane chestnut about double homicide (""Just kill him/ Fucking kill him/ Kill him already, kill him"") fits perfectly into the lineage of country death songs rooted in that Smithsonian thing (especially volume four, on Revenant Records), leaving a bloodtrail through Johnny Cash's catalog, through the Violent Femmes' overt ""Country Death Song"", through Will Oldham's eerie (Albini-recorded) ""A Sucker's Evening (""I'll hold his arms, you fuck him/ Fuck him with something/ The fuck... he deserves it""). Fans of these murder ballads should consult Robert Browning's chilling (and ahem, Monsieur Farrar, songworthy) poem ""Porphyria's Lover"", in which the killer holds his strangled woman in his lap, marveling at how ""God has not said a word."" Wait, Farrar already did the old standby ""Lilli Schull"" (""She begged me not to kill her,"" ""The fire where I burned her""). ""And Then"" was a prototype B-side version of Pavement's ""The Hexx"", from their swan miscarriage Terror Twilight (Silkworm's cover was previously released on the Pave tribute Everything Is Ending Here). The 'Worm deserves kudos for lending a rugged staidness to the song that even sincere-mode Malkmus can't muster. This track wanders as close to GnR's ""Patience"" as this EP dares; dig Andy Cohen's accomplished, plangent mandolin stylings (though he plays it much more Malkmusly at the end of this disc). Your enjoyment of the Bedhead reworking (of the Albini-recorded ""Lepidoptera"") might teeter on your appraisal of Bedhead (Mine? They're overrated and their best recording is their cover of Cher's ""Believe""). Interestingly, Silkworm force the original's buried vox to the forefront, over an arrangement that at times almost falls silent (remember, this is a band whose electric solos often sound like by-products of dares). Shame the lyrics are hit-and-miss-and-miss, but the mandolin breakdown will soothe those still mourning Lullaby for the Working Class's metamorphosis into Mayday, of Emomaha's Saddle Creek imprint. Albini client Robbie Fulks' ""Let's Kill Saturday Night"" is a catchy down-and-out rabble-rouser that transcends all John Bon Cougar Jovi-Mellencamp wannabes, and Silkworm was wise to strip the ""rock"" version to its tuneful, flannel-flag-waving essentials, but come on, these ""lousy job"" anthems could be generated by a computer program (call it Cracker). Cohen's mandolin rules this EP's rendition of Nina Nastasia's (yup, Albini-recorded) ""That's All There Is"", seducing the song out of its stolid sparsity and onto a rickety, candle-stained (I'm sorry) porch. This EP succeeds as an insidery, and even loving, toss-off, but leaves one half-wishing for a new song, or a bare-assed treatment of a Silkworm classic, or at least some drums. Completists should pursue their cover of The Faces' ""Ooh La La"" on Lifestyle and the rocked ""The Chain"" on the singles comp Even a Blind Chicken Finds a Kernel of Corn Now and Then. Bless this band's hearts for never falling into a leadership vacuum.","The acoustic guitar is due a reinvention, if only to stave us music-typists off of lazily referring to plinked projects ...

Back to the Front,The Magic Band,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c366ea9e61561daa7eea/1:1/w_160/8eae82ab.jpg,2003-07-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5032-back-to-the-front/,ATP,"One of the many profound revelations stemming from the commemorative Grow Fins set that Revenant released at the end of the twentieth century is how crucial Captain Beefheart's Magic Band was to the compositional process behind their askew, beautiful music. For years the emphasis was on the enigmatic Captain himself, and at the heart of his rock legend lay Trout Mask Replica, whose 28 songs-- as the story goes-- Captain Beefheart (né Don Van Vliet) spurted out in 8 1/2 hours, fully-formed, then laid down in the studio with the Magic Band in a half that time. A revealing book penned by drummer John French, and an all instrumental practice tape from that time that accompanied the box and nixed such instant creation myths. The Band worked assiduously with scant food or money in a cult-like situation to make random notes and patterns-- bare scraps of madman thought-- cohere, winding through wildly varied trains of musical thought and figuring how to converge and crash into some alien semblance of sound sense. While I was crestfallen to have the human hands behind the god-like apparatus of Trout Mask Replica revealed, my dismay was quickly replaced by respect for how luminous the band actually was, seeing the intricate, impossible moving parts glimpsed without the iconoclastic bellows and musings of Don Van Vliet overwhelming them. Even without Van Vliet (who retired from music in the early eighties), the reconvening of this league of gentlemen for the last All Tomorrow's Parties in Camber Sands was something special. That it took over thirty years for a portion of this anomalous music to finally be appreciated by the populace was an incredible breakthrough, and the chance for these hard-working musicians to get any bit of delayed recognition is deserved. To commemorate the event, the band headed into the studio to tape their rehearsals for the comeback concert. They slashed their way through the strongest points of the Beefheart catalog, focusing on early tracks such as ""Abba Zabba"" and ""Dropout Boogie"" to warm up before heading into the serrated edges of several Trout Mask tunes like ""Steal Softly Through Snow"", ""Moonlight on Vermont"" and ""Hair Pie"". This version of The Magic Band serves as strata for the various phases of the group. None of the members ever played together-- as this lineup-- before, an intriguing match-up in and of its own right. From their nascent beginnings comes John ""Drumbo"" French, whose musical transcriptions of Van Vliet's of-the-moment blurts helped lay out most of Trout Mask Replicas. It's his multi-dimensional tom rhythms and snapping cymbals that ""tied together"" the numerous Beefheart records, according to the Captain himself. Bassist Mark ""Rockette Morton"" Boston came into the Trout Mask commune and played through Clear Spot. Even with all the extensive research that went into the Grow Fins project, they failed to unearth him, and he only recently resurfaced, still powered by ""laser beans."" Denny ""Feelers Reebo"" Walley was a latter-day guitarist on the original Shiny Beast while Gary ""Mantis"" Lucas was the Captain's manager near the end of his career, actualizing the near-impossible guitar compositions like ""Flavor Bud Living"" and ""Evening Bell"". It's a shame that Bill ""Zoot Horn Rollo"" Harkleroad could not join in the proceedings. The compositional oddness of differing meters and the clashing keys of jarring note crashes will always be the touchstones of the Magic Band in most folks' minds, but it's the more straight-forward blues palpitations of ""Click Clack"", ""I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby"", ""Floppy Boot Stomp"", ""Circumstances"" and ""Nowadays a Woman's Got to Hit a Man"" that I return to most often these days (curiously, there's nothing after '72-- perhaps because Boston never knew any compositions after this period?) Built up from the relentless bottom end of a Hooker-like endless boogie, the drum rhythms also draw from more mechanical sources like train engines and windshield wiper patterns (Beefheart was a Lakers fan as well, loving the beats that the basketball would make), creating a lower-body pulse and chug. From these deep grooves, the two guitars would then slide and splatter like dueling paint brushes, freely coalescing colorful lines around Van Vliet, giving his voice ample space to growl and blow harp on. Of course, Don's not here, and as admirably as the Band lays out the tracks, there's ultimately no steam engine train to smoke over them. French does his best Beefheart impersonation, hitting those weird coyote cackles and guttural blues lines, huffing some competent harmonica too; but his voice on ten of the seventeen selections is a bit much though, and I wish for more moments like that of the Trout Mask practice sessions, where you could finally glean the irregular cogs of the compositions interlocking. The best example of this is on an instrumental take of the only song resuscitated from Lick My Decals Off, Baby, ""I Wanna Find Me a Woman That'll Hold My Big Toe Till I Have To Go"". Freed from Van Vliet's genius, cheeky poetry, we can hear the gentle yet intricate flexing and relaxing of the band for the first time. More of these moments would have made this more crucial, perhaps even as a good single disc intro to the man, but while John French does the growl'n groan admirably, he's no Captain, and that man's presence is still sorely missed.","One of the many profound revelations stemming from the commemorative Grow Fins set that Revenant released at the end of ...

I Know You Know,Guther,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfd5eb335119a49ed2b4/1:1/w_160/db911777.gif,2003-07-22 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3611-i-know-you-know/,Morr,"I've never quite understood exactly what ""twee"" music was; it seemed like just another arbitrary genre subdivider in the record bin of music journalism, probably not deserving of too much contemplation. But now I'm holding a copy of a CD by Guther, slick and shiny and waiting for the trash can, and I think I might just understand. And I'm hoping that I Know You Know is just one end of the no doubt vast spectrum of ""twee"" music-- the half-assed-attempt-to-sound-like-Belle-and-Sebastian-without- actually-being-very-good end. Aside from constructing a vapid time trap, languishing in the blue-tinged world of The Virgin Suicides, where cute teen actors are replaced by sour-faced indie kids with moptops and sweatbanded wrists, Guther seem to have spent their time perfecting just one song. And instead of filling up their notebooks with extra material-- just in case that one perfect tune isn't really as perfect as they'd hoped-- they decide to mix 9 variations on it and call it an album. If their intent is for I Know You Know to function as the shopping soundtrack for The Gap or Buckle, or that flagship of trust-fund suburban style Abercrombie and Fitch, then I can't talk shit, because that mission has been accomplished. You could browse the sale racks for pre-ripped cargo shorts and stressed AE t-shirts till your knees gave out and think you were listening to track one, ""The Other Day"" the entire time. There is so little variation in mood and tempo from song to song, you wonder why masterer Stefan Betke inserted the 2 seconds of silence between ""Taglieben"" and the equally wispy ""Trouble You Cause"". Coy and passive, with some jangly electric acoustic guitar and a smattering of G4 drums, I suppose this fits in simultaneously with the ""twee"" tag and the Morr Music ethos, but it's just fucking boring. The song titles contain more pronouns than you can possibly imagine (""You"", ""What She Felt"", ""We Walk""-- get the picture?), and the subject matter-- girls and boys in love/hate admiration-- has passed through the digestive system of so many like-minded (and much better) bands that the familiar taste is really starting to overpower the packaging. Maybe for the comatose or half-conscious this isn't really a problem; when you're in the mood for your music to just maintain that mood, and the components aren't of great importance, an album like I Know You Know might not be so offensive. Julia Guther's voice does slip nicely into the haut couture of the music, so whatever Guther is trying to pull off, they've done some homework. But what Morr Music would have us call a ""summer record"" would be better described as beige wallpaper: nondescript, and easily ignored. And this from the people who brought you Lali Puna and Mum. Julia Guther and Berend Intelmann think they've stumbled on a frequency that vibrates your heartstrings, and they ain't turning the dial anytime soon. Their timid vulnerability and doe-eyed sensitivity positively beg for a Louisville Slugger to the jaw: I Know You Know is less a collection of indie-vidual folktronica tunes than one long, self-absorbed sulk-fest on a big pink canopy bed, cigarettes stashed behind the dresser, vintage jeans strewn across the carpet, locked in the baroque mansion of The Royal Tenenbaums.","I've never quite understood exactly what ""twee"" music was; it seemed like just another arbitrary genre subdivider in the ...

Strays,Jane's Addiction,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c75e6ef95969322a45/1:1/w_160/3b20b4e4.jpg,2003-07-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4203-strays/,Capitol,"Perry Farrell started out as the most engaging guy who ever hit you up for change. It wasn't just his wiry, damaged looks and a voice that sounded like rent tissue; this guy had stories to tell, about what he saw on the streets, the drugs and hookers, the sound of gunshots and polyglot arguments. Then he'd get in his own head, and spill his wild theories-- sex is violence! Jesus enjoyed a good menage-a-trois every now and again! You can piss in the shower! On yourself!-- and fantasies about the mountains and deserts he'd probably never seen. If you drove in from the 'burbs and met this guy, he'd tell you things you'd never imagined-- but the whole time, he just wanted your money. The three albums that Jane's Addiction cut, from their commercial breakthrough in '88 to their sudden breakup in '91, placed them solidly as one of the great bands of their time. Farrell partnered with star lead guitarist Dave Navarro-- a fellow metal drama queen-- and the stellar rhythm section of Stephen Perkins on drums and bassist Eric Avery: you could send them out on reconnaissance and know they'd come back. Not only did the band help start the ""alternative rock"" era and revive great hard rock on the major labels, but their fusion of metal, goth, punk-funk-grooves and art-rock showed a breadth and power close to none other than Led Zeppelin-- a band whose greatness they scraped with their artistic and commercial pinnacle, Ritual de lo Habitual. And then it was over. Without dwelling on every solo project and spinoff band, you can argue that each new album was safer and duller than the one before. Farrell's Porno for Pyros made him tame and serviceable, as the one-time street threat became the professional concert promoter behind Lollapalooza. With his exotic electronica record Songs Yet to Be Sung, he'd finally made it out to the desert, even if he was too straight and cleaned-up to make anything of it. The others didn't fare much better, but aside from a one-off reunion tour (with Flea on bass), the band had been inactive for over a decade when they got back together-- with Chris Chaney replacing Avery-- to record Strays and revive Lollapalooza, which they're currently headlining. Again. If you're an old fan you might stop cold when you hear the band's new sound. I'll just be direct here: Jane's Addiction have embraced the stainless steel of nu-metal. That said, the old band is recognizable-- Farrell even shouts ""HERE WE GO!"" to kick it off-- but now they're tight, clean and less dynamic; some tracks sound slick enough to fit in a movie about street-racing sports cars. And who thought Farrell's voice would fit the bold, basic hard rock of the single ""Just Because""? But let's assume none of that bugs you. They went modern, and sometimes they sound like the music your little brother listens to because he's still scared of your records-- but they still knock aside pretty much anything else on commercial rock radio today. The performances are ferocious. Farrell sounds completely committed, pushing more out of his voice than you'd think it could give him. Navarro's leads fly by so often he barely pauses to point them out. Producer Bob Ezrin (Kiss, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd) deserves credit for catching (or generating) all the excitement in this date, even if the perfection is unnatural: the finishing touches are immaculate, from the light use of keyboards to the occasional choir and horn section, all layered barely above the surface. ""Hypersonic"" is a dizzyingly tight piece of metalcraft that screeches to a giddy finish; ""True Nature"" and ""Wrong Girl"" echo the segues and moody sections of past Jane's tunes, while ""Superhero"", the most cussing (and probably my favorite) song, acts as traditional mid-album sass-swagger, with its catchiest hooks. They sequenced the most creative songs around the clichéd hard rock of ""Price I Pay"" and ""To Match The Sun"", but unfortunately, the album's strengths stop at its construction. Strays lacks what what made the band great in the first place: believable songs and lyrics. According to interviews, the band wrote this material in the studio, so it's not surprising that none of the songs sound like they were burning to be written-- or remembered. The chorus of ""Superhero"" and the Zep-riffs of ""Wrong Girl"" don't excuse the forgettable hooks and by-the-numbers hard rock that fill most of the record. The problem isn't that they didn't write a new ""Jane Says"", it's that none of these songs can touch any of the material from the first three records. The dynamics-- the bass-led segues and sudden avalanches of sound, the hooks and stylistic extremes-- are simply absent. Strays boasts the band's career-worst dog, the ballad ""Everybody's Friend"", with an acoustic guitar part that won't be played in dorm rooms across America, and groaner lines like: ""Men of peace/ Men of war/ Tell me, who knows more?"" And that's more colorful than the kitchen magnet verse on the other songs. Still, as if knowing this, Farrell whizzes through and preferentially emphasizes the timbre of his voice over what he's saying: the lyrics have gotten wordier, yet none of them sound like they matter. It's hard to go from the songs on Ritual that seemed torn from Farrell's guts to this one-dimensional writing, but to be fair, those comparisons ignore that twelve years have passed. Farrell's not the man he was-- and nobody wants to hear a fortysomething sing about living clean and studying the Torah. He's in a different life: he's done letting us live vicariously through his mania. Judging from Strays, he and the band aren't out to add to the significance of their earlier work; they take the momentous quality of their reunion momentum and aim for the ages. At least they want to rock. For a reunion cash-in, that's saying a lot.","Perry Farrell started out as the most engaging guy who ever hit you up for change. It wasn't just ...

Wrapped Islands,FenneszPolwechsel,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0da9d034d5c69bf2808/1:1/w_160/d1b5e672.gif,2003-07-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6392-wrapped-islands/,Erstwhile,"The actual definition of the word ""experiment"" suggests focus and planning. In science, one controls variables and conducts an experiment in order to test a hypothesis. Most experimental music doesn't really fit the bill. Experimental music is usually not an attempt to discover whether a specific idea holds true under a given set of conditions; what we call ""experiment"" in music might better be described as ""tinkering."" Tinkering is a meandering stream of connected thoughts and movements that might lead to invention: ""Okay now, what happens if I put this here, yes, I see, then I tighten this screw and wait, that doesn't work, I need to put the screw underneath this fold, okay, that ought to do it. Now I make a cut here..."" Tinkering is what Thomas Edison was doing when he first sat at his workbench and wrapped tin around a cylinder to see if he might make cuts into the metal analogous to sounds in the air. Tinkering is the perfect word to describe this collaboration between Christian Fennesz and Vienna-based improv group Polwechsel. Polwechsel's MO is to create texture and reveal the inner-workings of sound itself. Accordingly, there is virtually no melody on Wrapped Islands and instruments throughout are not used in the traditional manner. Instead we get a series of drones, scrapes, brushes, taps, rustles. There is the sound of John Butcher's saxophone, but usually he blows a single note for 30 seconds and then repeats, transforming his Western instrument into a Fourth World didgeridoo. The guitars, including some of Fennesz' trademark processed strums, drift through a seemingly unrelated series of notes chosen for their geometry, with the occasional jazzy upstroke to keep a foot in the world of conventional music. A cello might be sawed or plucked or tapped or just banged around a bit to hear what happens. The members of Polwechsel play established instruments but two of the members (and Fennesz) are also credited with ""computer,"" and other with ""electronics,"" so you know anything goes as far as sound. Still, the feel of Wrapped Islands is very live and in-the-moment. It's an album of quiet, subtle, low-key improv, music that rumbles and creaks like a building settling into place after a tremor, with just a hint of tense soundtrack music providing atmosphere in the background. There is space in most of these tracks, a thousand holes of silence poked into the chattering web of sound, but my favorites have more density. Wrapped Islands is at its best when the drones gather some momentum. On ""Framing 3"" (the tracks are titled Framing 1 through Framing 8), a bony spine of drone, something like the gurgle of an outboard boat engine, snakes through the track giving the typically random sounds something to bounce off of. When Butcher's tenor enters for a three-note phrase, the most typically jazz-sounding bit on the entire album, the contrast in the tension is palpable. ""Framing 5"" is also thick and heavy, with gurgling keyboards and deep bass plucks suggesting some kind of threat. A distant, vague sense that something is wrong prevais on Wrapped Islands, and the tone varies little from track to track. There are moments when something lighter pops out, as on ""Framing 4"" begins with one of the few concessions to beauty, with a graceful low-end flutter, sterile but mechanically lovely, but these vanish rather quickly into the dark, serious atmosphere of the group improvisation. This devotion to a small handful of moods suggests that Polwechsel and Fennesz had something specific in mind when they sat down together to tinker, but my sense is that they never quite found what they were looking for. Wrapped Islands seems a bit like scribbled notes in pursuit of a potentially great invention.",,6.8,
Dengue Fever,Dengue Fever,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3e5e6ef95969322b80/1:1/w_160/51e8cf1b.jpg,2003-07-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2505-dengue-fever/,Web of Mimicry,"Ten chubby digits clapped midline in positive affirmation, as a rare toothless grin beamed up at me in the midst of plush toys and pink linens. The fussiest critic I had available to me, my barely two-month old cousin Caitlyn, would soon unwittingly answer a recent musical query-- whether the enjoyment of sound was hinged upon recognizable cultural structures like language and tonality, or whether there was something inherently deeper present in all music, from which pleasure could be equally derived independent of age, sex, or ethnicity. To establish a baseline of response, I previously exposed Caitlyn to countless hours of the Nuggets compilation, which she particularly enjoyed. I was now ready to present her with the ""experimental"" recording-- Dengue Fever's self-titled debut, released on Trey Spruance's (Mr. Bungle) Web of Mimicry label. ""Alright Caitlyn,"" I said, with babbling affectations sprinkled throughout, ""I need you to listen to this album, and give me your honest response regarding every note you hear."" I prompted her to squeeze my index finger in acknowledgement before continuing to supply her with some background information on the group. ""The band consists of some real top-notch musicians: the brothers Holtzman, Zac on guitar and Ethan on farfisa organ-- the former of Dieselhed pedigree-- saxophonist and Beck-collaborator David Ralicke, drummer Paul Smith, and bassist Senon Williams of the Radar Brothers. The story on the female lead-vocalist, Chhom Nimol, is pretty incredible as well, the singer getting her start as a Cambodian pop star who frequently entertained requests from the royal palace for private concerts with the king and queen."" I checked all corroborating factors-- food, diaper, and temperature-- once more before signaling to the babe that I was ready to begin when she was. With the drop of her arms I pressed play, prompting the sultry melody of ""Lost In Laos"" to begin, my eyes trained intensely upon the glib expressions the child would soon issue. Observation #1: Initially little response, but after a minute and a half, head shaking was exhibited. Though the sax-infused opening tune left her a bit cold, the swelling tones and tinny-warm guitar line soon made Caitlyn swing in her crib, while Nimol's high-pitched and wavering voice fit in harmoniously with the perforated rhythm section. This excitement continued through to ""I'm Sixteen"" and ""22 Nights"", songs equally influenced by Khmer heritage and the surf guitar of Dick Dale. The tracks focus on the vertical aspect of the music also had a pleasing effect on Caitlyn, causing her to spit up in excitement over a sound so rich in harmonic engorging. Observation #2: Subject covers her eyes while concurrently moving legs up and down in a rhythmic manner. A brass skeleton, ""Hold My Hips"" is a decidedly meaner track focusing on the darker aspects of dance music that is only occasionally punched through by island flourishes of bright instrumentation. ""Flowers"" continues this theme with a droll dialogue established between the saxophone and organ, creating a melody not completely unlike something spawned by The Hollies or The Byrds ca. Younger Than Yesterday. The many stops and starts juxtapose nicely with the near fugal progression of ""Thanks-A-Lot"", which develops over the period of its brief life from a sparse fuzz-guitar driven tune into a liquid cool melody complete with male-female harmonizing vocals. ""New Year's Eve"" rounds out this relatively sinister portion of the album with a creeping bass line that increases in tempo exponentially until finally progressing into a high-register dance song with psychedelic underpinnings, ultimately plummeting back toward its roots in the quagmire of languid silence. Observation #3: After a brief episode of crying, subject returns to happy state, with erratic movement of all appendages. I had an inkling of the notion prior to viewing her expressions of glee, but by the song's end it was confirmed that funk is part-in-part the universal language. ""Ethanopium"", an instrumental take on one of the Ethiopiques series' jewels, begins with a thumping rhythm bound high in the mix, but the true worth of the song lies in the continuous and-- I have to say it-- sexy bass, that draws a straight line directly to the soul-funk of early-60s James Brown. ""Glass of Wine"" sharpens up the mood a bit with a more traditionally foreign sound that provides a pleasantly flush backdrop for Nimol's ensuing conversation with a wavering guitar and a simple organ melody. Creeping psychedelica inevitably returns to the surface of the album though, on both the chromatically playful ""Shave Your Beard"" and the sax-lullaby ""Pow Pow"". The groove ultimately finds its resting place among the South Pacific dreams of ""Connect Four"", an original Dengue Fever-tune that glides along like a percolating Stereolab on beach vacation. Not content to merely providing glorious pop-tunes in easily digested song-wrapped packets, Dengue Fever choose the high road of cultural exposure, forcing the hand of the listener in a bid to fully comprehend their art. Though the lyrics are readily available online for those that choose to follow the stories along with the music-- and I recommend it-- one does not have to understand the content to appreciate what it means to have a good time. As Caitlyn and I discovered, as long as it's of a quality design, novel experiences such as Dengue Fever can prove to be just as-- if not more-- exciting than that which you may readily call comfortable or normal, though it may require the unexpected help of a humble and uninformed perspective.","Ten chubby digits clapped midline in positive affirmation, as a rare toothless grin beamed up at me in the midst ...

Duos for Doris,Keith Rowe,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b8c0084474cd0c00e3/1:1/w_160/13760a53.gif,2003-07-21 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6848-duos-for-doris/,Erstwhile,"For years, it was impossible for me to enjoy much of the Erstwhile catalog. Not for lack of trying, I just couldn't physically hear the subtleties within the collaborative work of the world's foremost ""sound""-- for lack of a more concrete descriptor-- improvisers the label thrives on, due to cacophonic street noise right outside my window (it drowned out all but the most strident noises). The digitized percussion duo of L\xEA Quan Ninh and Günter Müller dissolved in the Brooklyn street din while the dog whistle sinewaves and razors of Toshimaru Nakamura and Sachiko M's do were unrecoverable underneath the truck brakes, street chatter, and ""dink-dink-dink"" music blasting past the window at all hours. Now that I'm in the back room, away from the street, I can discern more of what's happening between one of Erstwhile's most stalwart artists, English tabletop guitarist Keith Rowe and an AMM bandmate of his going back to the start of the eighties, pianist John Tilbury. It's funny that, while Rowe's duo work has come into prominence over the past few years-- performing and recording prolifically with Nakamura, Müller, Australian guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and others-- this double CD marks the first occasion he has ever performed with Tilbury exclusively. Those familiar with the instant sound universes created by hardy perennials AMM will not detect any straying from that singular and difficult path. Instead, their sounds are distilled further and reconsidered yet again, the two gents disappearing into the spaces of the recording room, reticent to disrupt the silences that abound about them. Rowe rustles at a low volume, the guitar pick-ups and shortwave radio picking up what sounds to be the very air itself, charged with a constant crackle. Tilbury remains resolute until he hears what needs to be released. Thirty minutes into the seventy-minute first disc, ""Cathnor"", he carefully extracts the tiny percussive sounds of John Cage's prepared piano (something Tilbury has interpreted before). Faint and melodic, his lines evoke distant buoys in the bay, swaying with the unseen ocean that Rowe provides. At forty minutes, Tilbury further gleans the melody, carving out sustained chords in an elongated ascension that draws more on his exquisite interpretations of New York composer Morton Feldman. These chords soon gain gravity, clanging with a pained-- almost brittle-- sound commingled with thunderous low stabs on the piano, as Keith Rowe gathers metallic storm clouds in louder scrapes, reaching a catharsis that is the exact opposite to the eye of this hurricane, the center being the densest point in the music. Given the recording note that Tilbury's mother passed away two days before the session, it's not surprising to feel that emotional release with him here. ""Olaf"" is another long exploration, this time at forty-five minutes, featuring Tilbury's percussive taps on the piano wood and Rowe's rather peculiar version of the ether, with a bit more radio captured. I wonder what a car trip with Keith would be like, as he modulates the knobs and ratio between reception/static constantly, coming in and out of perception. The piano recalls its previous prepared sounds, achieving music box tones as Rowe blows about like wind into a field-recording mic. The final piece, ""Oxleay"", has Tilbury exacting ineffable filaments from the space, sometimes just the clack of a high key against the wire, while Rowe respires and hums at near-indiscernible volumes, often drowning in the outside sounds of ceiling fan hum and air conditioning, occasionally reminding you of his gentle presence. It's as there or not there as you want it to be, which is something to think about when people are-- physically, at least-- no longer with you.","For years, it was impossible for me to enjoy much of the Erstwhile catalog.

Fuzzy Warbles Volumes 3 & 4,Andy Partridge,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0019d034d5c69bf25f3/1:1/w_160/c22b1f8a.gif,2003-07-21 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6182-fuzzy-warbles-volumes-3-4/,Ape,"Here we go again, just like we did last summer. Just like we did all those years ago. Step aboard, and be shown a grand old time amongst all this lived-in luxury and second-hand splendor. Astro-boys and girls, it's time for a hit parade of Andy Partridge's old junk-- and you can't get this stuff just anywhere (or so the old marketing slogan goes). Each piece of secret fruit, bursting with stale hope and forgotten promise, is a specimen of unique gem-craft lovingly assembled by your favorite lonely toy soldier enthusiast behind the curtain. Where in dog's green girth could you plunder such willing treasures? Sit back and be swept up and under the buzzing thunder, up inside your mum's weeping underskirt: Ba pa pa pa pa p-- no. This must end now. XTC's bitter half has reeled in this cold fish four times. I admit it: after years of compulsive Partridge purchasing, all the smart money was on me buying his latest collection of demos and throwaways, despite being a little underwhelmed by last year's inaugural volumes. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now. Still, it's hard to root against guys like him making a pound or two at my expense-- in the back of mind, maybe I'm thinking he'll put some of the surplus towards, oh I don't know, making a new record one day. And speaking of marketing slogans, any good merchant knows that a bad customer will spill their fury for every one lucky friend of the Swindon-4-Life Disciple. In other words, I'll keep buying your stuff, Andy, but I'm gonna tell everyone about it. Just to show that my thinly-veiled agenda hasn't completely ruined my ability to think critically, I'll point out all the stuff that totally sucks first-- I figure it's only fair. Exhibit 1(a)(i): Partridge demonstrates his penchant for lamer-than-thou, wink-wink, ain't-I-the-Dickens, ""Holy Partidge, it's a genre sendup!"" with the yellow sub-That Thing You Do Brit-Invaded tripe that is ""My Train is Coming"". Goofy 7th chords? Check. Harmonica and cowbell? 30-love. Textbook middle eight? Advantage hyuck. And for all of the tune's obvious moves, it's actually Partidge's inability to muster any kind of raucous, early Lennon (or McCartney for that matter) larynx tearing soul that made all those pre-Rubber Soul hits so great. In short, our man at Ape is just no good at rock. It turns out he's no good at Chinese disco either, as the bedroom Casio adventures of ""You Like Me?"" reveal. It starts innocently enough with bells and fake Asian strings, like those you might hear in a car commercial aimed at yuppies that still think you have to be multiculturally aware to hide your inherently nerdy tendencies. Then he gets PBS on your ass. When the beat drops-- I guess it's supposed to be a dance beat of some kind-- it feels more like it's out to support visuals of fluorescent kites and pre-schoolers running after butterflies, all computer animated circa 1987. At least Newton's Apple had Kraftwerk! Still, nothing compares to the devastating horror of his stab at hip-hop on Volume 4's ""Zonked Right Out on Life"". Partridge's thoughts on this particular song-styling expedition: ""As in most rap, the 'c' is silent."" Don't believe the hype, A. Actually, in this case, believe the shit out of it. I haven't even gotten to the actual throwaways: ""Tunes"" and ""I'm Playing My Fano"" manage to avoid the lowest depths of indifference merely by beating the clock. That's more than I can say for the handful of XTC demos included on these volumes. Last year's Coat of Many Cupboards presented the band's ugly underneath in a fashion humble and more than a tad endearing. However, I'd also argue it should have been the final word on demos of previously released stuff from them-- by this point, Partridge is running out of decent versions of his tunes to release, and I'm running out of patience with his faith in my compulsive buying habits. No sir, I simply don't need flat, out of tune renditions of ""Great Fire"" or ""That's Really Super, Supergirl"". The worst part-- just as with the first two volumes in this series-- is there are a few good songs buried in the mix. On Volume 3, Partridge wisely follows up ""My Train is Coming"" with the entirely fresh ""Lightheaded"", sounding every bit the sprightly, digital age piece of psychedelic candy he should be blessing us with full-time. Likewise, the hazy, almost off-kilter, poppy seedling ""Blue Beret"" is a slap in the face to anyone who thought XTC's Oranges & Lemons was too adult-contemporary. Here, Partridge makes a case that he does the White Album better than a Magical Mystery Tour, as he further proves on the dense, chugging ""This is the End"". That tune was originally meant to close Oranges & Lemons, but was scrapped when our hero realized Cookie Monster beat him to the chord progression. That might've stopped some people from releasing it entirely, but such is the persistence of the P. These multi-volume demo collections are made for fans only, and dear fan, you must be very, very serious in order to get enthused about most of the music contained here. Truthfully, I doubt I could make a decent half-hour mix out of listenable tunes from this pair. If they'd come from anyone else, I wouldn't think twice about selling them back instantly. Fellow Partridge disciples, don't give up the fight-- surely, he'll return to save us from a world where the soundtrack from Punch Drunk Love is the best thing going for eccentric anglophiles. Surely he will. Right?","Here we go again, just like we did last summer. Just like we did all those years ago. Step aboard ...

Olden,Sixteen Horsepower,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a436b1335d7bf16988df/1:1/w_160/c4dfb489.gif,2003-07-21 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7210-olden/,Jetset,"I'll admit that I have an automatic soft-spot for odd instrumentation. Back when I first started to buy CDs-- at a bank-busting clip-- I liked looking through used bins and finding bands with oddball setups; chances are if it was less than eight bucks and had a sackbut or a nyckelharpa in the credits, it got bought. Of course this led to a lot of bum purchases (I suppose it was better than working from song lengths, like I did in my prog phase), but I never would have dug into the catalogues of Lullaby for the Working Class, Calexico or Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung-- a Dutch four-piece whose name translates to the Anarchistic Evening Entertainment-- otherwise, so I like to chalk it up as a reasonably successful buying habit. Thanks to the increased financial burdens of adulthood, I'm well out of that phase now, but I can't help getting a bit giddy when a disc leads off as Olden does, with the twanging jew's harp and trembling bandoneon (similar to an accordion) of ""American Wheeze"". These two instruments slowly coalesce into a blisteringly dark groove before David Eugene Edwards (grandson of a traveling Nazarene preacher) opens his mouth, exhaling a scorching breath of fire and brimstone. This is the world Sixteen Horsepower have meticulously created over the last decade, one where everybody's days are numbered, all sinners get their due, and you could be next. Olden chronicles their crucial early phase, before they had even released an album, scooping together two electrifying six-song demos and a hellraising live performance. As baby steps go, these are about as confident and destructive as they come. The band's initial creative burst was truly amazing. These recordings date from 1993 and 1994 (five were reprised on the late-90s LP Low Estate); knowing the band allowed them to incubate for so long is an indication of just how mature their craft was early on. ""American Wheeze"" was one of those songs, and you can hear its evolution here, as it's included in two very different forms: the aforementioned version and a later one that more closely anticipates the frantic final album take. The rawness of these recordings suits the band perfectly, capturing the slide guitar in particular in its gutbucket glory. ""South Pennsylvania Waltz"" is manic and violent, while the live version of ""Pure Clob Road"" feels like the circus with the tent collapsing, Edwards acting the part of panicked ringmaster, squeezing his bandoneon in singing in a frenzied half-shout. If Sixteen Horsepower ever had a problem on their albums, it's that a couple of tracks always sag in the face of their potential, but that doesn't happen here. In fact, the only thing disturbing the disc's flow is the genuinely odd placement of two inconsequential interview snippets at the end of the two demo sessions. As interviews, they shed light on nothing, and serve only to gum up the transitions between sections of the compilation. These days, you wonder why-- provided the funds existed-- the folks at Jetset didn't add an enhanced video portion with a full, video interview. It would have been more generous to the fans likely to buy this, and it would have helped the overall product feel more unified. As it stands, their inclusion is a real poser. Still, when ""Slow Guilt Trot"" rages in to start the live set after the second interview bit, it's hard to deny the onslaught. The disc ends on a breakneck live rendition of Low Estate's ""Dead Run"", which features some of Edwards' most emphatically dire exhortations with lines like ""One by one, we croak like the raven"" and ""The undertaker knows/ He lays the headstones in endless rows."" The band's brutal blues-punk attack must have been exhilarating for anyone lucky enough to be at the show. Recently, Sixteen Horsepower have become more measured in their approach, refining their sound into a more Appalachian mold-- their fifth album, last year's Folklore, contains multiple covers of traditional songs-- and they've taken on a different power as a unit as a result. Despite its archival nature, Olden captures the band at their fiery peak and sans the filler that slowed their early records; it's an excellent starting point for the uninitiated.","I'll admit that I have an automatic soft-spot for odd instrumentation.

So Much for the City,The Thrills,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a797ea9e61561daa560a/1:1/w_160/e2628f39.jpg,2003-07-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8037-so-much-for-the-city/,EMI,"If 2002 was a supposed resurrection of Velvet Underground-encouraged NYC garage rock, 2003 might be the year of the Beach Boys: check The Thrills, a troop of shaggy-haired Dubliners who, after camping out in San Diego for four months, have successfully adopted the breezy, sun-seeking saunter of California's much-mythologized coastal heroes. On the band's glossy debut, So Much for the City, vocalist Conor Deasy casually drops references to Big Sur and the massive, gleaming beaches of Santa Cruz, name-checking Hollywood kids, Las Vegas, and gently creeping tides while beautifully channeling the Boys' sweet coo-- and without the slightest hint of thick Irish brogue. Lifting styles and sounds is a ballsy proposition, but it's not a particularly shocking one. While agitated classic rock fans might be tempted to drag issues of purity and authenticity into their early morning, PBR-tainted cock fights, co-opting and barefaced mugging have been indisputable parts of the rock equation ever since Presley started gyrating on TV. Even the biggest late-60s UK acts like the Stones and Led Zeppelin nicked their sweets from the Americana store, channeling coarse delta blues into something louder, rounder, and a little bit whiter. Therefore, The Thrills' perplexing geographic origins should ideally remain entirely irrelevant to the stuff of their record: a competent, satisfying pop spread, packed with impeccable vocal harmonies, happy keyboards, jangly guitar, and plenty of fades. That The Thrills' hometown seems so stupidly anachronistic in the context of their music is-- surprise!-- a perfectly valid quibble: their decision to metaphorically (and, temporarily, physically) transplant themselves might be the only compelling creative choice they made. So Much for the City's sticky, pop-pleasant aesthetic has been straightforwardly pilfered from the last forty-something years of pop tradition (The Byrds to the Beach Boys to Ben Folds to Grandaddy) without nearly enough alterations to justify its brazen nods; even their bandname has been sported by a whole mess of artists already. I'm not saying every Irish act has to (or even should) sound like The Pogues, but The Thrills' external, sometime vaccuous pinching is clearly self-conscious, a carefully premeditated breach of expectation that causes more of a wince than a flash of pleasant surprise. Still, there are some great summer-songs here: ""Santa Cruz (You're Not That Far)"" has a rolling rise-and-fall melody, sliding from a high, lazy piano-and-vocals intro into a full-band crest, punched up by spotless harmonies, bursts of harmonica and consistently bright percussion. Majestic and equally ocean-inspired, ""Don't Steal Our Sun"" features cut-time piano and drums, nicely timed shifts, and convincingly aggressive vocals, while ""Big Sur"" proves that The Thrills are capable of more than blind regurgitation: searing open with a zap of synth, the track's bouncy guitar, scratchy banjo and inescapable hooks are promising, and even the ""baby, baby, please don't go"" lyrics become kinda charming by halfway through. Bands are always inadvertently shoveled into scenes and movements, often based on little other than their hometown addresses; it's that kind of arbitrary pigeonholing that allows for buzzwords and media-centric ""hot spots,"" marketing tricks and random cash-ins. The idea of preemptively eschewing all that shit is understandably appealing-- but The Thrills could have thought a bit harder about finding a bright new sound to go with their suddenly sunny locale. This one's taken.","If 2002 was a supposed resurrection of Velvet Underground-encouraged NYC garage rock, 2003 might be the year of the Beach ...

39 Minutes of Bliss (In An Otherwise Meaningless World),Caesars,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d2c0084474cd0c0a59/1:1/w_160/b5b502b0.jpg,2003-07-20 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1713-39-minutes-of-bliss-in-an-otherwise-meaningless-world/,Astralwerks,"The image of the cocky, sneering Swede-rocker first entered the American lexicon sometime in early 2002, as Sahara Hotnights and the soon-to-be-ubiquitous Hives pranced their xFC-garage pastiche onto the pop stage, squirming into the hearts and minds of anyone with M2 and a Vines record freshly wedged in their stereo. High-pitched, fevered chirping about garage rock revivals and Jack White's pants ensued; bands started casually citing the MC5 and the Electric Prunes as super-super-influential. We talked about Sweden; we whispered about Detroit. We dreamt about the second coming of Paul Revere. Mid-2003: revival hyperbole has settled down, Swede-mania has long collapsed. But Caesars (also known as Caesars Palace-- or to Scandinavians as the Twelve Caesars, a previous tag) are poised for their very own eye-opening stateside permeation, as Astralwerks perplexingly releases 39 Minutes of Bliss (In An Otherwise Meaningless World), a pieced-together singles package masquerading as an album (tracks were culled from Caesars' 1998 debut and a handful of subsequently released EPs); it functions for the most part as the thumping ""garage rock"" soundtrack to a bunch of goofy beer commercials. Curiously, a forty-five second advertisement featuring a troop of lovely twenty-somethings provocatively sashaying through a flooded, soapy laundry room seems like the appropriate venue for Caesars' entirely artificial, smooth- but-empty product. It's just as believable. With their rousing mod riffs and ample percussion, Caesars' Kinks-ish (circa Village Green) retro-jams are palatable enough (and certainly catchy enough) for modern rock radio, but they're also studio-polished to the point of becoming impenetrable; the tunes themselves are a predictable blend of spent Brit pop (half these tracks play like flimsy Oasis B-sides) and gooey American lite rock. Opener ""Sort It Out"" boasts wildly meaningless lyrics (""I wanna smoke crack/ Cause you're never coming back/ I wanna sniff glue/ Cause I can't get over you""); they have the potential to be sorta...charmingly asinine, until the relentlessly thick electric guitar and simpering pseudo-Doors organ lines suck all the fun out, coating everything in Smashmouth goo. The possibility of squeezing a good snicker from 39 Minutes' brazen anti-poetics wanes fast: ""(I'm Gonna) Kick You Out"" nobly offers, ""I'm a man with a fork/ In a world of soup,"" but it's already too late to hope for prize-winning lyrics from the vacant, mechanical instrumentation (relentless guitar, plodding bass) that makes up the song. Frontman Cesar Vidal has perfected the smug, nasal moan and polished posturing of his white-belted countrymen, but his snotty yelp is so flat and hollow that it barely qualifies as a credible whine-- by the time 39 Minutes reaches the droned-out ""Suzy Creamcheese"", it's hard to even dig up a half-assed grin for the title. Caesars have managed only to co-opt the self-satisfied smirk of rock 'n' roll. Their promise of bliss is about as viable as the beer commercials this record is presently being used to sell, but not nearly as fun or mercifully fleeting.","The image of the cocky, sneering Swede-rocker first entered the American lexicon sometime in early 2002, as Sahara Hotnights and ...

Ripple,Fonica,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6feb335119a49ed071/1:1/w_160/1e61a273.jpg,2003-07-20 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3262-ripple/,Tomlab,"As someone who spends a lot of a time listening to music, and trying to somehow assess its value, it's important to acknowledge that I have certain auditory sweet spots that exist independent of logic and reason. Maybe it has something to do with an odd brain geography that's resulted in some quadrant being unusually receptive to certain kind of stimuli. Perhaps repressed childhood memories, or forgotten dreams, or some bender-induced chemical rearrangement from before I knew better are to blame. All I'm sure of is that some combinations of sounds do it for me every time and it becomes difficult (and not very much fun) to decide whether this music I'm drooling over is ""good"" or not. Listening to Ripple, the debut album from Fonica (Japanese boy/girl duo Keiich Sugimoto and Cheason) I realize I'm mad for the sound of pretty, repeating guitars mixed with warm, glitchy electronics. Simply put, when the electro-acoustic guitar/DSP combo is done in a certain way, it can make me cry. I think I'm enjoying this album so damn much because Keiich & Cheason are skilled at mixing the acoustic and electric guitar patterns with the beeping, static-laden drone underneath, but I'm allowing for the possibility that I'm just a sucker for this sound. Honestly, I'm enjoying Ripple too much to care. The track titles on this alubm are appropriately simple markers of a single idea or impression, titles like ""Soar"" and ""Perch"" and ""Fluid"". Most cuts are a bustle of activity, small taps and clicks and keyboard squiggles that mesh into a buzzing sonic tapestry; foregrounded is a simple guitar melody that accentuates the pale, blurred color of the mood. Though the laptop processing pioneered by Markus Popp and referenced here suggest the beauty of a purely mathematical world, Fonica have completely humanized and softened their glitches, so that their prime references are sensation and memory. These tracks make you remember things like the tingle that climbs up your arms as you wade into a lake. It's interesting to hear Sogar's Jürgen Heckel crop up on ""Whirr"" (he's credited with ""sound materials""), as his recent album Apikal.blend on 12k definitely marks him as a kindred spirit. Heckel also makes laptop music using a guitar, though I would describe his work as organic but not necessarily human. The microscopic detail of Heckel's thin, shifting drones obscures their guitar origins. On ""Whirr"" it's easy to hear his signature trebly sound, which reminds me of the summer buzz of a cicada, but then Fonica blend this digital insect chorus with an evocative guitar melody and a bubbly layer of bass. The simple string elements bring the drone much closer to pop, though it could also be argued that it evokes post-rock of the Mice Parade variety. Either way, ""Whirr"" is absolutely gorgeous. Elsewhere Fonica evoke a Childisc-like simplicity. ""Fluid"" is just a wispy music-box melody that sounds like a feather being dragged along a toy keyboard. ""Coda"" takes a few acoustic guitar strums and harmonics, chops them up, and layers in some subtle electronic accents. This track and the closing ""Zephyr"" remind me a lot of Greg Davis' Arbor, where the laptop can be switched off at any moment to showcase the rich and complex sonic properties of plucked steel strings. Ripple is a wonderfully satisfying and succinct little record, a beautiful synthesis of guitar and electronics.","As someone who spends a lot of a time listening to music, and trying to somehow assess its value, it ...

Sure, it might sound like a bland concept, what with the whining guitar lead and vocals not unlike Mr. Cuomo's, but then the chorus comes crashing in, and it does the things one expects a pop chorus to do: 1) it gets all the harmonies and magical stuff you can't be bothered with while in the moment stuck in your head; 2) it invokes its title, ""Blueside"", ensuring that gets stuck in your head, too. And consequently, it becomes 3) the one truly memorable part of the song-- the bit you'll find yourself singing hours later-- and, 4) the moment that embarrasses the other parts of the tune so soundly that the listener is left waiting for the chorus to come around again, like a caffeine addict waiting in line at the Dunkin Donuts for something tall, dark, and sugary. It's a style that never goes out of style. But before you go gaga, join their street team and pledge allegiance to the cute little brown bear featured on the band's propaganda, note that this particular song ends up being the highest high Rooney's record hits. It's not that the other ten tracks pale in comparison-- actually, ""Stay Away"" is right up there, jonesing on a naïve Cheap Trick vibe-- but all of these songs are the same damn color. ""Blueside"" gets the benefit of the doubt simply by being the first track. In light of what follows, it's no more or less spectacular a song than any of their others, which is a shame. The color I referred to in the last paragraph, by the way, is blue. It's the pastel blue you might recall serving as the backdrop of the photograph of those four nondescript fellows on the cover of that record with the song about Mary Tyler Moore on it. But instead of meting the lovey dovey crap with helpings of gunky sweaters and 20-sided dice (or, as all Pinkerton lovers remember, wanton and desperate vulnerability), Rooney offer up detached professional tales of girl-wanting, girl-lusting, girl-having and other male adolescent hormonal endeavors-- the same type of endeavors, by the way, that these immaculately produced pop stars refer to (""You've hit me again one more time"", ""Bye bye bye bye bye bye goodbye"") as ""the killers of rock and roll"" in ""Popstars"". As Bart Simpson once said, the ironing is delicious. Another wrinkle worth noting: as great and clean as this record sounds-- thanks in large part to those ""unsophisticated money machines""-- its cleanliness saps the songs of any personality or charm, qualities that could rescue them their boring, almost admirable compositional merits. All the accoutrements are meticulously placed in the proper spots. When the drums start sounding mechanical (see ""Terrible Person"") or the guitars are turned up to 11 (see ""Daisy Duke""-- 80s pop cult ref ahoy!), or the synthesizers are set on Fun-Filled Spooky (see the intro to ""Kristen""), it works; when the band starts mimicking the recognizable big bang boom that Rivers & Co. trademarked and copyrighted nine years ago, it doesn't: ""Daisy Duke"" is ""Buddy Holly"" rewritten as an anti-ballad. ""If It Were Up to Me"" is shamelessly mimics ""Holiday"", and the introduction to ""Losing Control"" sounds suspiciously like REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling""-- a punishable offense in most countries. Rooney is an acceptably underwhelming, state of the art, guitar-centric pop record. This would be a fine thing except for the hubris on display, best exemplified by ""Popstars""-- which, contrary to what Rooney might want to believe, is what they are trying to become. Given Rooney's current label affiliation (that's Geffen, as in Interscope, as in a big honkin' cog in that money machine) and the amount of label-generated buzz these five chaps are currently benefiting from, calling out Britney and Justin for raking in crazy money isn't a brilliant move to bust on your first album. As a wise man once asked, ""Why do they gotta front?""","Putting your best foot forward is no excuse if you can't walk the walk. ""Blueside"", the lead track on ...

Songs for Psychotic Children,The Vanishing,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a983b1335d7bf16994e2/1:1/w_160/0c21a104.jpg,2003-07-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8509-songs-for-psychotic-children/,GSL,"Fronted by darkly-styled, ex-Subtonix singer-bassist-saxophonist Jesse Eva (aka photographer Jesse Trashed), San Francisco's The Vanishing is a guitar-less trio whose blend of Goth-inflected horror-film synthesizers, new-wave rat-a-tat drumming, murkily driving bass, and Mike Kelley-esque Children of the Night imagery wades rather predictably within the pools of dark-edged 80s dance music. The three raven-haired demigods have the Look and the Sound, but their obsessive conceptual pose-- based on stale leftovers of the Sisters of Mercy's semi-apocalyptic trope= - falters whenever someone opens their mouth to shout about ""scary"" stuff. On their first full-length Songs For Psychotic Children, Eva's mostly nonsensical tales of the macabre are redundant and overwrought, her vocal tracks approaching darkness with the subtlety of a full-body ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" tattoo. Stylistically, her densely trebled vocals initially bring to mind the beloved warble of early-period Siouxsie, but instead of mixing restraint with the full-throttle howl, she chants through the album's five vocal tracks with relatively unchanged cadences. Despite the overtly gothic ministrations, Songs For Psychotic Children strikes like a treatise on memory and trauma via allegories of girls with barbed wire teeth, Dorian Gray mirrors, and that old Victorian standard: ballrooms of rotting fruit. Damn! Toned down a bit, these sentiments would be less cartoonish and all the more frightening; I prefer the moments between vocals, the portions less tightly connected to a psycho-ward cliché. On ""White Walls"" there's much obnoxiously vehement screaming about the lost traces of history buried within whitewashing, but ironically, the ten seconds of fascistic white noise at the end of the track are its most interesting moment, finally burying all that whining in a grave of foreboding feedback. ""Lost in Pictures"" continues the focus on forgotten shadows and the spaces that memories haunt: \x93Children scream through cellophane, a thin layer of hell/ They suffocate trapped in the last position they fell/ 'We live in the shadows on the floor where we will fall / No one will ever hear our voice because we are so small.'"" So, basically, my grandfather's hard candies come wrapped in a 'thin layer of hell'? That's fucked up. The instrumentals make more sense, or at least hold together better. For listeners who've grown up with a television and access to Stephen King books, the language of horror is firmly ingrained in our psyches and well-enough understood, even on the most corporeal, non-thinking level; we don't need a cheat sheet. On the band's first instrumental (which is untitled), a synthesizer approximates pulsating wind from outside a window while another sprays atmospherics, humming with horror film obviousness. This track aims to evoke a particular setting; for example, an old dark house on a cold rainy night? ""Sighs on Pyres"" is reminiscent of a slow-as-molasses ""You Belong To The City"", but as a Gothic reinvention with choirs of Casio keyboards pre-set to the ""spooky"" sounds. The fast-paced ""Obituary""-- the album's strongest track-- is a Vampiric dance party bringing to mind both OMD and Psychic TV. The final piece on the album (also an untitled instrumental) swivels upon the same windy, sawing synthesizer as the opener, but sounds more spacious, interiority replaced with a sense of notes resting in the air, ungrounded, ready to fly o'er the horizon, the silent ghosts that come to terrorize you softly each night. One of the more interesting aspects of the less-extreme forms of ""evil"" music and the culture that follows are the slippages between the humdrum surroundings of daily existence and the escape into temporary transcendence, to clove-and-absinthe-scented dance clubs. When too many dark buttons are pushed, self-parody becomes a difficult thing to avoid: it's so much harder to fear something that makes you laugh, unless you're laughing nervously. All in all, for this sort of over-determined, laughable evil, I'd rather listen to Cradle of Filth; though their approach is equally schlock-y, they actually make me nervous.","Fronted by darkly-styled, ex-Subtonix singer-bassist-saxophonist Jesse Eva (aka photographer Jesse Trashed), San Francisco's The Vanishing is a \n\ guitar-less ...

Whats Come Inside of You,Freescha,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6fabf31b7dc715614d/1:1/w_160/c5c02b7f.gif,2003-07-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3263-whats-come-inside-of-you/,Attacknine,"If the more indie-centric styles of electronic music-- chin-stroking head music or evocative slices of arrested development-- seem to mirror a couple of the primary strains of indie guitar-based music, it's probably no accident. After all, they're generally after the same type of music listeners, all seeking the same core emotions, albeit from different sounds. Freescha, the California-based duo of Nick Huntington and Michael McGroarty, make that second kind of indie electronic pop: the sort of warm, melodic, almost twee sound that sells well at Darla.com, and is favored by the majority of the Morr and City Centre Offices rosters. Whats Come Inside of You (sic) is Freescha's third full-length (following 2000's Kids Fill the Floor and 2002's Slower Than Church Music), available from their self-run Attacknine label. Perhaps less distinctive than many of their peers, Freescha is taking slight steps away from the organic, clean sounds perfected by Boards of Canada and, more recently, Carpark Records' Casino Versus Japan, with whom the California duo recently shared a spot on that label's Wanna Buy a Crapark? compilation. Freescha is still primarily making fluid, mid-tempo, synthesizer-based sounds, but their latest effort is boosted by primarily 4/4 beats, a further emphasis on overt hooks, and more compact and digestible song structures. The album's provocative, retrograde art suggests a more decadent direction, citing 70s porn, Ming the Merciless, roller-skating, and boom boxes as suggested inspirations. For the most part, however, that seems like a bit of red herring. Despite the near-electro throb of opener ""Rinky Dink""-- which starts off like a bouncy filter-disco version of ""Crocodile Rock""-- the record quickly settles into more traditionally ambient glitch-pop patterns. Like BoC, Freescha dress their sounds in a lot of delay and echo, using dub as a production inspiration more than aiming directly for its spatial qualities. Freescha retains the waterlogged, reverb-heavy feel of electronic dub, but their BoC-style analogue toy box nostalgia suggests they are clouding time and memory rather than simply drum and bass. Vocals are used scarcely and, when employed, are buried under echo or treated with a vocoder, making any words essentially indistinguishable. The sensation of communication is more important here than the message. The most distinctive of the vocal passages are snippets of heavy breathing and erotic moaning. They're more overtly sexual than sensual as the cover art - as well as song titles such as ""Come Good"" and ""Lover Function""-- suggests. It's the tracks that most tactfully toe those lines between the seedy and sentimental that are the most rewarding, mostly notably the understated, slowly unfolding ""Baby Maker"" or ""Come Good,"" which-- like much of the second-half of the album-- is a dead-ringer for Air. And therein lies part of the problem. With simplistic rhythms and uncomplicated melodies, Freeshca are certainly crafting easygoing, inviting sounds, but are trying to tempt us down very familiar paths.","If the more indie-centric styles of electronic music-- chin-stroking head music or evocative slices of arrested development-- seem to mirror ...

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark / Organisation / Architecture & Morality,Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9cdeb335119a49ec888/1:1/w_160/7306f82b.jpg,2003-07-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11793-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-darkorganisationarchitecture-morality/,DinDiscDinDisc,"Most American music fans don't seem to know it, but Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were around long before Andie and Ducky worked up the self-esteem to show up stag to the prom. The band's U.S. crossover success didn't come until their sixth album, by which time its more creative juices had stopped flowing. So like Adam and the Ants, the Human League, and Dexy's Midnight Runners, among others, their homeland success and spirit of experimentation has been erased from U.S. music discourse in favor of hegemonic assumptions and lazy potshots. With that in mind, I was almost as much surprised as I was pleased to learn that Virgin bothered to release reissues of OMD's first three albums in America. But with the indie calendar turned back 20 years, it almost makes sense, and who knows: maybe once the embers of post-punk are fully explored and its rigid dance moves are all perfected, a synth-pop revival is next. The Human League got their well-deserved due earlier in the year with reissues of their three most vital records-- augmented by bonus tracks-- and now OMD's peak years get the same treatment. In its earliest guises, the Liverpudlian group's only connection to American hits such as ""If You Leave"" and ""So In Love"" were the dramatic vocals of co-founder Andy McCluskey. He, along with fellow multi-instrumentalist Paul Humphreys, wrote and recorded songs throughout the late 70s, the best of which were compiled for their 1980 self-titled debut. Because it's a series of tracks written both over a long period of time and before they'd hit upon an original voice, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark does at some points seem like an artful pastiche of overground electronic influences. If you're more of the cup-is-half-full type, however, you might consider it their most varied effort, but either way, OMD's adventurous blend of drama and pathos-- and its nods toward the more rhythmic end of Krautrock-- elevated them above the Eno/Kraftwerk template clung to by many of their peers. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's original release was highlighted by the exquisite ""Electricity"" (here also joined by the slightly inferior yet eye-catching Martin Hannett mix) and the brooding ""The Messerschmit Twins"", but the reissue's coup is the single mix of ""Messages"". The band's commercial breakthrough, the elegant ""Messages"" stands out next to the record's often sparse, minimalist soundscapes. OMD's second LP Organisation was hastily released six months later, and it sure sounds like it. Typically, a sophomore rush job means a band is cowardly-- quickly rolling out more of the same-- or taking a wide-eyed bid at chart stardom. For OMD, it meant recoiling from the spotlight, regrouping to make a willfully dark album. If that was the goal, pre-album single ""Enola Gay"" did little to keep fame at arm's length. Despite the song's dreary subject matter (it's named for the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima), its infectious, gurgling bounce and McCluskey's theatrical vocals make it one of synth-pop's peaks. The remainder of the album is primarily hit-or-miss synth noir, an embrace of the Northern miserablism of fellow Liverpudlians Echo and Bunnymen and a homage to OMD's brief Factory Records roots. The addition of drummer Malcolm Holmes made this record more muscular than its predecessor, but its psuedo-Joy Division gothic leanings quickly wear thin. The bonus tracks are less valuable, too: b-side ""Annex"" is welcome, but the addition of a four-song instrumental EP is more a curio than a necessity. OMD made a quick return to form, however, on their third album, 1981's Architecture & Morality. Shaking off the dread of their music engaging with the public while simultaneously weathering critical scrutiny, OMD shows a greater facility for pop melody, crafting songs of aching fragility rather than off-putting gloom. Along with the Human League's Dare-- also initially released in 1981-- Architecture & Morality is a bridge between synth-pop's more bleak, industrial beginnings and the shimmer and shine of ambitious New Pop. Lush ballads such as ""The Beginning and the End"" and ""Souvenir"" effortlessly cast aside OMD's final notions of Gary Numan-esque faux-robotics. After all, as ""Enola Gay"" hinted, technology sometimes had a devastating price. Instead, here they explore the mechanics of the soul, again reaching into the past for inspiration, this time with four (yes, four) songs ""about"" Joan of Arc. OK, that seems a bit precious, but the teenage heroine trapped between duty and common sense, faith and delusion, and reality and virtual reality made for a poignant central metaphor for a band exploring the fragility and warmth of the heart with what is a stereotypically cold, even pragmatic sound. Even with the reissue's addition of some frequently bewitching B-sides, Architecture & Morality retains a fairly even mood, one which is either a bore or something to cherish depending on one's willingness to be charmed by electronic lullabies of longing and poignancy. So while OMD's self-titled debut perhaps offers more to like, Architecture & Morality is more frequently beloved and the closest the band ever came to making an essential record.","Most American music fans don't seem to know it, but Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were around long before ...

After the Last,The Red Thread,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23ab1335d7bf1698444/1:1/w_160/1008103a.jpg,2003-07-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6729-after-the-last/,Badman,"The romantic edge to After the Last comes off as cool and dry as a desert night, like drinking a beer outside after the day's heat rolls off, with next to nothing going on. Languidly moving from one mid-tempo tune to the next, it's an album that has no surprises and better yet, no indulgences-- just a remarkably consistent debut showcasing tuneful alt.country. Jason Lakis (ex-Half Film) fronts this Oakland-based act, contributing vocals and guitar; he formed the quartet with members of San Francisco's The Inspectors. They clicked right away, with rough guitar riffs and an impeccable rhythm section. Lakis' languorous pedal steel dominates every track it appears on, especially the opener ""Spread Thin"", but never detracts from how beautifully it blends with Daryle Goldbar's guitar and Wurlitzer, nor how smoothly it rides the crisp rhythm section. Lakis also writes all the songs, which are as tasteful as the band's sound: the easy melody of ""Spread Thin"", the riffs of ""Subject to Change"" and the series of great choruses all get better with every listen. The only cover song-- Bad Brains' ""Sailin' On""-- could have been just a ""punk meets country"" novelty track, but the Red Thread perform it as naturally as if they'd written it themselves; Lakis pairs it with the album's only other rocker ""All In"" before reverting to mid-tempo ballads. These guys are lovers, not fighters. As might be expected, the record's steady pace reveals its shortcomings. Even the engrossing ballads are steady and distant; ""Borrow and Spend"" digs the deepest, even though it seems to need more-- more gutbucket vocals, or another wrap-up verse. Song after song, Lakis plays it cool, and it wouldn't even be a problem if it didn't highlight what's wrong with Lakis as a singer: we don't get enough of him. Lakis has a smooth, masculine croon with a languid delivery and a touch of husk, the sound of a guy the men can drink with, and the women can giggle over. A random survey of nine out of ten female listeners would like to hear more of him, and maybe check out his butt, yet Lakis sits in the middle of the band rather than wearing his appeal like a pair of jeans. His vocals hang back-- he keeps his delivery consistent, and his voice mixed too low. That may explain why this is a solid but not striking debut. The band hits its stride right away, and the songwriting is above average-- even the instrumental coda ""Details"", which could easily have sounded half-baked, flows perfectly to close out the record. Lakis and company hit the mark again and again, but it seems all too easy. By album's end you're already hoping they push into riskier territory the next time out.","The romantic edge to After the Last comes off as cool and dry as a desert night, like drinking a ...

Children of God,Swans,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f25e6ef95969320c07/1:1/w_160/1b60b267.jpg,2003-07-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7646-children-of-god/,CarolineCaroline,"As a college radio DJ in the mid-90s, I once played ""God Damn the Sun""-- the coda from 1988's The Burning World-- for over an hour on repeat. Every time the song faded, I placed the needle back in the starting groove and waited for the tentative drones to begin again. The Swans' bleak eulogizing mixed perfectly with the snow outside the station window, and I imagined passers-by who could hear were realizing we'd found the proper soundtrack to wait out the winter, literally and figuratively: ""When, when we were young/ We had no history/ So nothing to lose/ Meant we could choose/ Choose what we wanted then/ Without any fear/ Or thought of revenge/ But then you grew old/ And I lost my ambition."" In actuality it's a more temperate song, set to the dusty alcoholism of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, and the snow...I was just being dramatic. But Swans-- for all their bombast-- avoided succumbing to the same high-school theatrics during their band's fifteen year existence, contrary to what you might have been told. Formed in 1982 and fronted by vocalist and guitarist Michael Gira (currently busying himself with Angels of Light and Young God Records), Swans included a revolving cast of unrelentingly deft and like-minded downtown players, most significantly vocalist/keyboardist Jarboe, who's pitch-clear voice contrasted diabolically with Gira's deeper-than-hell bellow. Perhaps because of his fire and brimstone intonation-- which makes Ian Curtis sound like a pistol-whipped soprano-- Swans were often pigeonholed as a too-dark, almost laughable gothic experiment. The assessment is reductive and tone-deaf: at their best, Swans seamlessly layered no-wave and heavyweight industrial pounding with streams of erudite Middle-Eastern drones, drop tuning, monolithic sheets of noise, harrowing, force-fed dynamics, and gorgeously lilting strings and acoustic guitars. Add to this adventurousness Gira's dark tales of warped love, lusty damnation, torturous addiction, and soul-sickened existentialism and you've got yourself one of the more interesting musical takes on the underbelly of human nature to crop up in the last two decades. Most of the band's work went rapidly out of print, but Gira has graciously remastered and reissued much of it on Young God. The blistering Children of God, for example, was originally released in 1987 and reissued ten years later as a double CD with World of Skin, a compilation of tracks from Skin, a Gira/Jarboe collaboration focused more on Jarboe's ethereality. World of Skin compiles Blood, Women, Roses (1987) and Shame, Humility, Revenge (1988), albums from the same time period as Children of God (1987). Children of God, one of the band's strongest releases, established Gira as an Old Testament tyrant obsessed with the nature of love, human frailty, and the midnight beauty of black orchids. Much of Swans' earliest work on Filth and Young God found the band fixating on single beats in a brutally sweeping, industrial cacophony, in many ways the realization of the theories of the Futurists. Later, with the addition of Jarboe, Gira brought more varied sounds into the mix, melding hooks and spatial variation to the unwavering rhythms. Children of God stands as a solid example of this transition: the maniacally heavy drone of the album's opener, ""New Mind"" gives way to the fragility of Jarboe's ""In My Garden"". This is one of a dozen wonderful juxtapositions here; in its expansiveness, Children of God brings to mind disparate touchstones: Joy Division's factory-worker melancholy, more elaborately atmospheric Black Metal bands like Emperor who deal in swirling beauty and intensity, Big Black for pure aggression, and old-time softness of traditional folk. On Children of God, Gira's brief lyrical declarations have also begun to evolve into a larger sense of storytelling (he in fact published a hypnotic collection of Gothic short tales, The Consumer, on Henry Rollins' imprint 2.13.61 in 1996). On later recordings like The Burning World (1988), the details of the prose equaled the atmosphere evoked within the music. World of Skin is less accomplished, its quiet introspection lacks the maniacal propulsiveness of Swans. On the plus side, tracks like ""Breathing Water"" and ""One Small Sacrifice"" anticipate Gira's later work with Angels of Light, albeit in a more skeletal, funereal form. Here, though, Jarboe's vocalizing often errs on the side of the new age: her interpretation of ""Cry Me a River"" is static (to be fair, Gira's remake of ""I Want To Be Your Dog"" is equally ho-hum) and ""We'll Fall Apart"" sounds like the precursor to some hopelessly lightweight Sarah McLaughlin's malaise. On the other hand, ""Blood on Your Hands"" is a lovely dark-night spiritual harmonized by Jarboe and other singers. This track also shows up on The Swans Are Dead, a mind-blowing documentation of their final world tours of 1995 and 1997. Live, it grows into a sinister solo alto with a slight drone humming and other ambient noise in the background. Despite the misfires on World of Skin, to experience these carefully paired documents as a singularity is an intense study in contrasts and linkages as well as a compelling look at a particularly fruitful moment in the development of one of America's more ecstatically uncompromising, idiosyncratic, and sadly overlooked composers.","As a college radio DJ in the mid-90s, I once played ""God Damn the Sun""-- the coda from 1988's ...

You care deeply about the underprivileged; you are aware. You went to Vassar, or Wesleyan, or Wellesley. You know your Plath and Angelou, your Naomis (Wolf and Klein), perhaps even Laura Mulvey. The right's brazen usurpation of power and their subsequent crusades send you into paroxysms of anger. The time has come to share your compassion, your outrage, your unique insight. Too bad you lack even a modicum of the talent required to put your musings into any form other than a weblog. Ahh, but you can make them rhyme. Sort of. ""I'm a vegetarian/ Humanitarian/ Imaginarian [sic]/ I'm a Libertarian/ The country's getting ugly and there's more in store/ But don't blame me 'cause I voted for Gore."" Holy shit, it finally happened. Welcome to hip-hop as a vessel for smug, middlebrow liberal condescension. Meet Northern State: a merry troika of young Long Islanders who rap about Bush and Fast Food Nation on their debut mini-album, Dying in Stereo. But first-- since I'm going to be tackling the doubly touchy subject of white female artists working in a black male milieu-- I'll need to lay down some ground rules. First: for the purposes of this review, there is no such thing as ""white"" or ""black"" hip-hop. We'll use class definitions instead. Second: For the sake of my inbox, let's dispense with the girl factor-- the crew's gender matters only because it triggers 99% of the praise that's heaped on them (and I swear, people, somewhere out there is a group of girls even more talented than underground hip-hop's current leading lady, Jean Grae), and allows wanting critics an opportunity to finally champion somebody as the antidote to rap's misogyny, as if a group of haughty correctives from suburbia could somehow trump-- or even start a meaningful dialogue with-- the inner city. Armed with the weakest flow in town, squeaky Amy Fisher accents, and a stultifying, wrongheaded sense of entitlement, Hesta Prynn and pals have created what must be the most heinous hip-hop release since MC Skat Kat went solo. Clearly children of privilege, Northern State commit the terrible fallacy of co-opting street argot-- something that grad-school rappers like MC Paul Barman and Princess Superstar, whatever their shortcomings, wisely avoid. Dying in Stereo is peppered with yo's and aight's delivered in a giddy yet suspiciously ironic fashion; the falseness is soul-rending. Northern State sound like suburban brats playing with Ghetto Barbies. It's even more worrying, then, that Dying in Stereo displays no knowledge of hip-hop history whatsoever. Judging from the evidence presented, Northern State base their understanding of the genre entirely on the Beastie Boys. Their collective sound mimics the Beasties' dynamic (the high-voiced one, the low-voiced one and the raspy too-many-Marlboro-Lights one), down to their tendency to rap in the familiar cadences that overstress the last syllable (you know: ""I'll rock this party like a de-bu-TANTE!""). It's rare that an album is rendered fully unsalvageable halfway through the first verse of the opening track, but that is precisely what happens on ""A Thousand Words"", when one of these Long Island lolitas utters, ""I'm lean/ I'm mean/ I'm clean/ I'm not 17."" (There goes a good excuse; the crew are in their 20s.) Disturbingly, Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, exhibiting distinctly lecherous tendencies in his old age, hailed the track's money line (that one about voting for Gore) as a gem. It ought to be said that most of the glowing critical ink lavished on Northern State squirts from Christgau's pen: Voice coverage aside, it was he who gave the trio's home demo a four-star review in Rolling Stone, setting them firmly on track to a recent deal with Columbia. Beatwise, the album is bland and fey, with no low-end or hooks to speak of. The third track, ""At the Party"", distinguishes itself by trying on a sort of Fisher-Price metal riff, then abruptly abandoning it. The lyrical nadir, however, has yet to be reached: Save your projectile vomit for the penultimate song, ""All the Same"", in which Northern State deign to explain their mission: ""All we can do is try/ To speak for the people who haven't any voices/ And feel for the women who haven't any choices."" The group's bravery is duly noted-- all that pro-life hip-hop's gotta go!-- but the fact that Northern State believe themselves to be in the business of empowerment is unconscionable. Juvenile, simpering, weak, preachy, pointless and accidentally snooty, Dying in Stereo is about as empowering as Legally Blonde 2, and half as clever.","You're a good person, you really are.

IN LONDON AT THE LYCEUM IN MARCH, THEY PLAY BOTTOM BILLED SUPPORT ON THE BUZZCOCKS TOUR - THEIR SET ENDS UNDER A HAIL OF FLYING GLASSES (PLASTIC) AFTER FOUR NUMBERS..."" I really hope the folks tossing plastic at Cabaret Voltaire weren't Buzzcocks fans. While a Buzzcocks song like ""Noise Annoys"" (in retrospect) merely talked the talk, Cabaret Voltaire's ""Nag Nag Nag"" actually brought the noise, sounding like a group of technologically poisoned construction workers banging out ""Louie Louie"" on bulldozers and PVC tubes. Times have changed, of course: after the Warp and Hanson imprints-- and even Add N to (X)'s namby-pamby electroshock therapy-- a passionless voice intoning ""Nag, nag, nag"" over what amounts to some ambient noise, two notes on a keyboard, and a drum machine isn't much to throw overpriced beer at. Neither is this collection. These 3 CDs compile sounds created by the CV collective prior to laying down, as Richard Kirk (Guitar/ Synthesizer/Voice) words it in the nearly inscrutable liner notes (printed in silver ink on top of black & white pictures-- striking, design-wise, but it isn't easy on the eyes): ""the tracks that first brought us to public attention."" According to Kirk, the first 2 discs (featuring work from 1974 through 1976) contain the components that would eventually coalesce into the familiar work featured on the third disc: the aforementioned ""Nag Nag Nag"", ""Baader Meinhof"", and ""Do the Mussolini (Headkick)"". Not surprisingly, these little bits of familiarity are the dullest portion of this entire package; as the title of the box set suggests, the purpose of this collection is to detail the process by which Cabaret Voltaire found their way. In this light, the journey's destination doesn't amount to much. Over the course of listening to these tracks, it might strike you that Cabaret Voltaire discovered themselves the way many an artist gains their sea legs: by fucking around. Try something different, fall flat on your face, try something else, repeat ad infinitum. In the liner notes, Kirk notes (rightly) that the presence of punk rock makes itself known in these demos through the use of guitar. It's this overt attempt to ""rock"" in any fashion, the capitulation to pop songwriting, that makes the known tracks dull. Even their respectfully disrespectful cover of the Velvet Underground's ""Here She Comes Now"" sounds too obvious, though CV do their best, approximating the rhythm of the original, strumming some chords that might be right, and stabbing the keyboard ""96 Tears"" style while laying down sepulchral vocals to lend a watered-down Joy Division air. They do manage to get their VU adulation right in some respects, one-upping the spoken-word shtick of ""The Gift"" and ""Murder Mystery"" with the ominous narration of ""Data Processing Instructions"" and ""Bedtime Stories"". The best of these tracks eschew punk rock trappings (e.g. the type of guitar-based stuff the Buzzcocks et. al. are known for) in favor of embracing the idyllic punk rock ideology of doing your own damn thing. For the Cabaret Voltaire recording in that attic in the mid-70s, that meant making noises like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, best known for the Dr. Who theme. ""Synthi Aks Piece Two"" and ""Henderson Reversed Piece Two"" certainly recall the haunting moods offered by Brian Eno's ambient material, if not the actual sounds. Elsewhere, excursions into musique concrete collide with formal experiments. The ""Treated Guitar"" sounds like an overweight bass; the ""Treated Clarinet"" resembles a harmonica; the ""Treated Drum Machine"", a metallic cuckoo clock. ""Jive"" turns out to be a fair approximation of some sort of dubby funk (as essayed by wooden spoon beats and something that sounds like a electric Jew's Harp). And, of course, befitting the punk rock spirit of all this work, ""The Single"" is doo-wop (accompanied by suitably hokey lyrics and a few synth shocks, just so you know where it's coming from). Naysayers will gladly pounce on the first track of Disc 3 as the epithet for this collection: ""It's Not Music"". Of course, even Pizzicato Five fans know that music is organized sound-- it's just a matter of what level of organization you're willing to recognize. The band as represented in Methodology seem to recognize patterns that many of the great unwashed were unwilling, or incapable, of discerning. In many ways, the many moods offered in these demos surpasses the comparatively heavy-handed paranoid rebellious slop they doled out via Rough Trade and other record companies. Perhaps those fans in 1978 were right to throw things at the group when they opened for the Buzzcocks-- after hearing these attic tapes, who the hell would willfully put up with more nagging?","Nth verse, same as the first (this time, featuring Jon Savage, circa 1978, as narrator):

Clemency,Summer Hymns,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a713d1975652138fdd/1:1/w_160/d97441c3.jpg,2003-07-16 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7564-clemency/,Misra,"There's a fine line between cliché and brilliance. Hackneyed, overdone musical signifiers are easily and endlessly exploited, but it's often the most engaging and memorable music that reminds us why these clichés exist in the first place, recreating them with spontaneity and sincerity. When Summer Hymns released their debut Voice Brother and Sister in 2000, there was no dearth of reasons to suspect contrived kitsch-- here was a band with the word ""Summer"" in their name, releasing an album overrun with lazily-plucked banjos, transplanted back porch ambience, and hazy, ethereal vocals. Voice Brother and Sister seemed so thematically and musically whole that it was destined to be either a masterpiece or a bit of insubstantial fluff. Thankfully, it fit quite comfortably into the first category, and still stands as one of the most gorgeous, instantly accessible and compelling albums of the last several years. With the release of their third album Clemency, Summer Hymns once again find themselves skirting dangerous territory, as many of the musicians whose contributions helped make 2001's A Celebratory Arm Gesture such a rewarding follow-up have moved on, the hole created by their absence filled largely by oft-misused lap steel guitar and the odd sample and drum machine beat. Frontman Zachary Gresham once again proves remarkably adept at playing music that sounds perfectly suited for itself, crafting a loose, country-tinged rock album that avoids both bar band mediocrity and shallow, overdetermined rootsiness. Clemency wastes no time establishing its sonic difference from the last two Summer Hymns records. Gresham's voice is right at the front of the mix, its wavering, awkward qualities now embraced rather than reverbed to oblivion. Opener ""Be Anywhere"" places Gresham's voice atop a relatively skeletal arrangement of guitar, drums, and glockenspiel, slowly building to a melancholy crescendo of slide guitar and harmony vocals. Gresham's claim that ""I could be anyone with you"" oozes with concurrent sweetness and sadness-- a moment of perfectly captured emotional complexity conveyed brilliantly through the newfound sonic lucidity of his voice. ""Upon Your Face"" works similarly, injecting the more upbeat songcraft of A Celebratory Arm Gesture with an oddly unsettling brand of melancholy. Throughout Clemency, Gresham spikes mundane storytelling with moments of profound reflection, and his music follows suit; ""Upon Your Face"" alternates between a casual, relaxed groove and a chorus so fluid and gripping it sounds like it's melting. ""Cold Hamster"" rattles off child-like observations about life, death, and pets amidst a subtle harmonic interplay of guitar, bass, piano, and electronics. The brief ""I Erase"" is a dusty western ballad whose hero rides into town with the drum machine clapping of a digital horse, but it comes across as anything but a gratuitous piece of genre-mashing. Though without a doubt a strong record, Clemency does have a few notable moments of weakness that render it less consistently gripping than its predecessors. ""Pete Rose Affinity"" is the ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" of the album, awkwardly telling a story in a way that comes across as relatively charming the first time, but fails to hold up. The barely-discernable vocal sample towards the middle of ""Wet Mess"" is a mere distraction-- a shame considering that the song builds to one of the most forceful, rocking crescendos to be found on the album. ""This Hip Hop"" takes the whole of its length to get anywhere close to convincing, even on repeated listens. A few missteps aside, Clemency is generally a consistent record-- if anything, a bit too consistent, as some of the shockingly successful experimentation of the last two Summer Hymns records is sacrificed in favor of a more homogenous collection of songs. Perhaps the addition of two full-time members who don't have to split time with other bands is responsible for the more live band-like execution of Clemency. And though it may not be quite as stunning as the previous Summer Hymns albums, you can't help but be drawn in: like the albums that came before it, Clemency is a deep, rich, and profoundly engrossing listen, proving once again that, if used properly, the most familiar sounds can also be the most affecting.","There's a fine line between clich\xE9 and brilliance.

From Death To Passwords Where You're A Paper Aeroplane,Metamatics,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44b69fc7814a47cd855/1:1/w_160/514517ec.gif,2003-07-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5251-from-death-to-passwords-where-youre-a-paper-aeroplane/,Neo Ouija,"Somewhere is Lee Norris' closet, a pair of dancing shoes is collecting a shitload of dust. Norris is probably out for a stroll, right around 7:30 in the PM, breathing deeply and keeping the pace relaxed. He's stocking up on pillows and Swedish furniture, and sleeping in late. Taking it easy. And rightfully so. Despite scores of brilliant records, from his 12"" releases on Clear to seminal albums like Spook Tinsel Shoal and the flawless diamond that is the Neo Ouija LP, Norris has remained just this side of the spotlight, IDM's best kept secret or beautiful albino in guarded seclusion. In that time he's harvested a crop of like-minded knob-twiddlers for his Neo Ouija label roster, and kept his sound evolving. Although he thinks of some of that early Metamatics catalog as dated (Lee, believe me, it ain't so), a surprising number of elements from previous Norris records still crop up on 2002's From Death to Passwords Where You're A Paper Aeroplane, a subdued album that finds the heavy dance DNA of Dope for the Robot and Neo Ouija turned down to a whisper. The beats are still there, mind you: Norris pretty much defines the mid-to-late 90s IDM sound, layering skittering loops over skittering loops till the whole thing crackles like the most beautiful sandpaper, and From Death To Passwords cuts like ""Machine Wool"" and ""Colmic Zeus"" are rife with them. ""Remip Ear"" even sneaks a little booty bounce into the bass track, but the sunlit atmosphere that rolls over top of it eskews the funk. What you'll find on the new album is that the Metamatics sound has expanded to include more forays into ambient territory, a rich sense of ghost melody that permeated the best tracks on Neo Ouija (and if you're asking me, those would be ""So Many Ways"" and the title track in particular), and is fleshed out even more so on Passwords. ""Giant Sunflowers Swaying In The Breeze"" has a thick synth hook, with beat textures inspired by his ""Man-Q-Neons"" single on Dot Recordings, best described as house music filtered through the European countryside, preferably populated by healthy, blissed-out sheep. The IDM spirit is in full force on ""Byeway (Clan)"", but it's the chiming synth and extended musix box harmonies that make the track work, not the clicks and cuts snipping away behind them. ""A New End"", in every way, is the culmination of this new curve in the Metamatics sinewave. Opening with translucent ambient washes and a spiraling laptop chirp, the song ebbs and crests in an easy rhythm, evoking a calm and meditative void at once melancholy and crystalline, the quiet doldrums of a day spent inside; computer clicks try to put the movements into context, but it's those first four minutes of digital mist that move you. It swipes the blueprint for lovely from ""How I Missed You"" and takes it on a long sea cruise. It's one of the most indelible soundscapes Norris has ever recorded, and solid evidence of musical growth. Norris' Metamatics material has always had heart, but on From Death To Passwords, the beats stay quiet long enough for you to hear it with more than your ears. The rhythm tracks are still a thing of beauty, but they've graciously lowered their profile for a spell, and the countryside that lies beyond is worth a thousand ""Organic Healthy Robot""s-- maybe more. Neo Ouija is still the pinnacle, but you can see this record from the summit. In less purple words: this isn't his best, but it's the next best thing.","Somewhere is Lee Norris' closet, a pair of dancing shoes is collecting a shitload of dust. Norris is probably out ...

II,Pharaoh Overlord,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e2ea9e61561daa4677/1:1/w_160/ae7aa6cc.jpg,2003-07-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6260-ii/,No Quarter,"The vast, blurry landscape of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times they're enhanced. Sometimes, letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun. Get it? Unless you're completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the only one who knows that you're right. Maybe that's why music made under these circumstances is usually so out there. It probably made sense at the time for Tim Leary and Manuel Gottsching to make all those strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether. This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high. Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer space. The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force. Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition, Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler effortlessly afloat. Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea. If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that guitar squealing nonsense. For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the next best thing to warm milk before bed. ""Komaron Runner"" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in. A gauze of distant, howling breeze covers the minimal guitar-bass-drums vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke. The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft noise build, giving the tune an ominous, hazy depth. The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely minor variations on the same basic riff played continuously, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous ""psychedelic"" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction). Likewise, ""Dark Temper"" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and surprisingly subtle guitar figures. The end result is like a younger cousin to Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" crossed with Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", but with no vocals, you're free to follow your own narrative. Slightly less engaging is ""Skyline"", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via mind-numbing repetition. There's a good chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to play it again depends on your affinity for pre-school blues riffery (and general level of patience). ""August"" and ""Love Unfiltered"" opt for acoustic textures, though not at the expense of the already well-stated preference for sludgy garage rock grooves. The former tune is almost folky, with a dual finger picked guitar attack, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening. The latter is more overtly spacey, though in truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for ""something"" to happen is probably beside the point. II won't change the face of rock, or even psyche-rock. There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like greasy collector scum, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a valuable service at a fraction of the price. Like any decent trip, this music will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the bizarre corridors of your mind. Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again! Anyway...you know what I'm talkin' about, man.","The vast, blurry landscape of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times ...

Pin EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab0c5e6ef959693216b8/1:1/w_160/9adb348d.gif,2003-07-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8886-pin-ep/,Polydor,"For all the faults and imperfections that continue to show up in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' body of work (repetitive arrangements in Nick Zinner's less-inspired moments, Karen's play-acting testing the limits of endurance), the results are staggering when they bring the full weight of their collective abilities to bear. Between Zinner's cutting drones, Chase's lurking rhythms, and Karen's (like it or not) ability to grab a listener's, uh, attention, the YYY's at their best sound less like a sleazy three-piece and more like a relentless troop battling from trenches. ""Rich"", ""Y Control"", and most of all the flawless mixture of vitriol and vulnerability in ""Maps"" are their crowning achievements, and they can release singles until the wheel of fashion finally turns and strands them at the Salvation Army, but if they don't single out any of these songs, they're missing the point. We should all be thankful for small favors, though, as ""Pin"" at least manages to convey a fraction of the overwhelming force they have at their disposal. What it lacks in the drag-strip dynamics and pacing of ""Date with the Night"" it compensates for with a brooding ebb and flow; stilted treble chords give way to a thunderous crash distortion, but that tidal rush is back to sea before the next verse, only to repeat the cycle one more time. The lyrics imply gritty urbanity, but only in shadowy terms: ""Things are feeling thin,"" sings Karen over the tense, skeletal accompaniment, giving ""Pin"" an appropriately half-hearted, world-weary sound. It's not a frequent pose, but it's every bit as attractive as the bedroom antics Karen typically adopts, and more impressive for its relative rarity. ""I like to sleep with them/ I know, I know."" Yeah, Karen, so do we. Even if ""Pin"" doesn't quite encapsulate the sheer power the band has at their disposal, there's also a video for it, so that's something, right? Who wouldn't want to see that? I sure as shit wouldn't not want to, but my computer choked to death on what's allegedly a ""creepy"", ""Quay Brothers-inspired"" piece of rock action, and despite all my protestations to the contrary, this pile of circuits (that's charitably one step removed from an Etch-a-Sketch) just wasn't having it. All I got were occasional still-frames as Karen O ""goes back in"" to a door, turns into an action figure of some sort, gets pins stuck in her (clever); the slide-show presentation I got made it into the worst stop-motion video ever, though, so I can't comment. It's just a video, it shouldn't take much firepower to dazzle my senses with Karen's trip through the looking glass, should it? Maybe if this machine was actually a multi-million dollar supercomputer that was just pretending to be obsolete, it would've run properly... Wiat what? Was that a dig at the Yeah Yeah Yeahs? Just a little, but hell, my temporary case of techno-envy makes me want to tear up my trucker's cap in bitter defeat. What can I say? So no in-depth symbolism analysis, no talk of Christ-analogs or phallic portrayals, folks; I'm as disappointed as you are, but just remember that whatever I say here about the music (the meat of any album), the disc also includes a video (the gristle). I hear it's good. It'd better be, too, because when you come right down to it, the meat of this thing is only fair. ""Pin""'s qualified strengths aside, the unmistakable failing of this EP remains that the YYY's seemingly have yet to realize where their strengths lie as a band-- and for a group with so much potential, it's infuriating to witness yet another wrong turn. Yet, somehow, the YYY's continue to surprise me; they steer into the skid and end up in totally foreign territory. The last time they tried to navigate the sticky terrain of ""experimental"" mixes (with a fuzzy, indistinct rendering of ""Pin"", no less) on the disastrous Machine EP, they seemed hopelessly lost; it's a wonder they made it back in time to record their album. If the B-sides of this single shows anything, though, it's that they learned from their mistakes. The ""Pandaworksforthecops"" remix of ""Rich"" crosses the haunting harmonic backing of the original with ""Jingle Bells"" and a drummers convention; while Nick and Karen overdose on valium, Brian pulls out all the percussive stops-- bells that are singularly disconcerting in their monotony, an overpowering drum loop, and ghostly stick clattering in the background-- running roughshod over mumbled lyrics and faintly plucked strings. Only hypnotic whole tones reminiscent of the original keep it recognizable as anything other than a totally new composition, but its brilliant bleakness only serves to clear the set for baffling, if weirdly impressive, finale: a cover of Liars' ""Mr. You're on Fire, Mr."" I'll concede this: in simple, broad strokes, the YYY's have managed to cover Liars in a way that band would surely be proud of; everything outside of the most explicit defining characteristics of the original, the rawest of the raw essentials, is hollowed out and discarded. Zinner's guitar is distorted to lifeless tones, Chase provides nothing beyond a lone snare hit in terrifying rhythm to pace the track, and the lyrics are beyond indecipherable, Karen's voice barely more than a distorted, lazy shriek through the course of the song. It's utterly pulseless: a draining, yawning void in place of Liars' tightly wound dance-punk mania, and in some ways, it's incredibly smart. Nothing could be closer in spirit to the Liars' ever-present desire to stay one step ahead of expectations, even if it's not an easy thing to take in and of itself. Just when it seemed like the YYY's could still be nothing but a talented one-trick pony (and luckily for all involved), they demonstrate some unexpected depth beyond even the beauty of ""Maps"". The B-sides of this single carry the day, actually building on the off-kilter rock of ""Pin"", turning the jittery, brittle nerves to some good use after all. Now the real is question is not whether they can learn from past errors, but current successes, and that remains to be seen; after all, even a one trick pony can get lucky.","For all the faults and imperfections that continue to show up in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' body of work (repetitive ...

Welcome To The Monkey House,The Dandy Warhols,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89a9d034d5c69bf3ab1/1:1/w_160/6f82c0cb.jpg,2003-07-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2162-welcome-to-the-monkey-house/,Capitol,"""My favorite part of the show was when he took off his shirt...dreamy."" As if to accent the comment, she made a sweeping motion across her brow with one hand-- wiping away invisible sweat-- while the other deftly locked itself around the steering wheel. Agitated-- she knew I was being forced to see a band I had no true interest in-- there was surprisingly little hesitation in her voice when she asked, ""Didn't you enjoy it?"" Its not as if The Dandy Warhols and I have any bad blood between us, but my previous exposures to the band have been sordid to say the very least. True, I met my significant other and eternal concert partner while absentmindedly reviewing Thirteen Tales of Urban Bohemia for my college radio station-- her noticing the empty jewel-case beside my bag and inquisitively approaching me as I listened-- but those tunes have waned appreciably over the years, turning balanced neutrality into mild disparity at the mere mention of Courtney Taylor's troupe. Add to this sentimental nostalgia my recent concert attendance, and my initially lukewarm feelings of distaste mutate into venomous and irascible abhorrence. Petty as it may be, I fully admit that I am not above disliking a band based solely on the fact that they cater to my fears of inadequacy as a male and mate. Of course, the only reason I mention this is to caution the patient reader against lambasting my opinion of Welcome To The Monkey House based solely upon the above numerical rating and any personal adherence one may have to Dandy-ism. While it's true that I hold damning grudges against some musicians for no other reason than misdirected machismo (guilty feelings? mere jealousy?), I would never pan the actual music if it fairly displayed some amount of talented songwriting and quality. To wit, I would sooner punch every member of the Saddle Creek family in the nose-- barring The Faint and Now It's Overhead-- than shake their hands or say hello, yet I continue to surreptitiously purchase and endorse every recent Bright Eyes release. Thus, believe the heart of this kindred music-lover when I state that Monkey House is comparable to and nearly as enjoyable as a pelvic exam with chilled instruments-- seemingly fun, but shaky and ill-advised. Beginning on a warble-- the sound of Courtney Taylor's tongue drilling directly through his cheek-- the title track is a short and typical Warhols' sound that pokes fun at the fabric of pop-culture while simultaneously unraveling it. Flippantly spouting off lines such as ""When Michael Jackson dies/ We're covering Blackbird"" would be laughable and forgiveable if delivered over any accompaniment other than the dry and clipping electric guitar line that the group pounds out for the song's brief temporal existence. Partly redeeming is the transition into ""We Used To Be Friends"", a track that fully exhibits the aided production by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame. On it, one can hear the warm synthesizers-- otherwise known as Dandy's flavor-of-the-month-- replacing nearly all traces of the guitar in the group's sound, as Taylor pinches his prostrate in some unsettling, yet strangely alluring falsetto vocalizations. A comfortable furniture-filled-room production leaks into ""Plan A"", a track that sports another D2-member, Simon Le Bon, on back-up vocals. Musical influences and heart vying for equal space on the band's sleeve, the song is catchy enough with a unique sonic layering of acoustic and electronically derived sounds, but suffers for its inability to let go-- the chorus of ""all of us, sing about it"" suffering well past its time of captivation or interest. Similar tracks-- ""Insincere Because I"", ""Heavenly"", and the morose ""You Came In Burned""-- suffer the same fate, drawing out tunes that couldn't hold anyone's attention for thirty seconds, much less beyond the five minute mark. Not content with their own lackluster tune, ""I Am A Scientist"" drags one of Robert Pollard's best songs through the mud, the band hijakcing the experience of Chic guitarist/producer Nile Rodgers in the process. Preaching atop an empty pulpit, Courtney drops ironic faux-pedagogic phobias such as ""I try to live on science alone"" and ""I tell you what, mathematically I'm happening,"" before plunging into another hard-beat/fuzzy-bass loop that ends on a whimper of instrumental ornamentation. Equally predictable: the slight-guitar return of ""I Am Over It"", the Tony Visconti-produced and T. Rex/Bowie aped ""Hit Rock Bottom"" and ""The Dope"", and the slower jangle-pop genesis of ""I Am Sound"". A bright spot amongst the tarnish is the Evan Dando co-write ""You Were The Last High"", the song that undoubtedly gets the group another quarter of a million records sold-- the A-Ha influenced composition that will cause phone company executives' ears to perk up in advertisement bliss. Alternately sounding like the mix-tape song of choice for your average sixteen year-old girl in the throes of first-luv or a Jarvis Cocker solo release, ""The Dandy Warhols Love Everyone"" rounds us out as best as can be expected-- doo-doo's and wah-ooo-oooh's augmented by electronic beats and a twice-bitten fuzzy bass line. Unfortunately, these songs highlight the poseur mentality and insincerity that paradoxically plagues and blesses The Dandy Warhols-- one side of the coin endowing them with innocent condescension of their musical roots, the other holding them accountable for their acoustic laziness in the face of so much potential. The decision rests solely with the band now as to whether future releases will make good on this latent talent, or whether they will continue to rely upon breathy sighs, the crowd-pleasing rush of hedonistic pleasure, and the infidelity of exposed nipples.","""My favorite part of the show was when he took off his shirt...dreamy.""

It's like the instrument has lice, and he's coaxing them out, unafraid to venture from the antiseptic glory of the post-rock shimmer-tone, flirting with ""world"" and ""metal"" interludes. Word is Villareal can't even keep track of his tunings. That stench? The absent mind of G-E-N-I-U-S. Good old Rapsys is a one-man rhythm-section all over the globe. His Ulrich-y doublations must be why the first track got called ""Puppet Of Masters""; my desktop Bose were producing air like warehouse turbines. The vocal track ""News Scatters"" showcases more tinny funk-dub talent (from a duo, recall) in its two minutes than many pedal-stockpiling four-pieces muster throughout whole albums. Rapsys matches and accents Vic's every pullback-and-release on ""This Is The Bad 1"". Wait until ""So Long, Long Songtitles"" (another possible Kinsella reference?) when Villareal relaxes with his most repetitive and mundane pinch-riff, because Rapsys brings the bottom-end noise as well the cyborgy keys and Mick Turner-style atmospherics. So Ott, I gotta get outta here. Just warn people who find all ""post-"" stuff a tad manila that they might find these prodigy-steeds and virtuosi-bums...a tad manila. And get the phrase ""soul music that requires a scientific calculator"" in there somewhere. Maybe a line about kitchen appliances slow-dancing. Man, that was effed-up how in Gremlins, they were cooking and dicing those Gremlins (which obviously represented teenagers) and then Spielberg would make Schindler's List. I mean, Gremlins was like Teenage Holocuast.

The Mechanical Forces of Love,Medicine,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c414eb335119a49ed878/1:1/w_160/19e1513d.jpg,2003-07-15 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5202-the-mechanical-forces-of-love/,Astralwerks,"This album kicks off aiming to stun, and you can't help but let it: ""As You Do"" bursts in with some psychedelic short-circuit funk that sounds like Sly Stone taking over Manitoba's laptop-processed pop, pressing every button on the console to make sure you hear something that trips you up and out. Sliced-in guitar scratches blip all jerky behind Shannon Lee's gospel belting. And when that tack's exhausted its tweakability, a sunny west-coast pop blur sweeps in underneath and carries the rest of the way through. You'd have to be awfully jaded not to drop your jaw, however metaphorically, during that first wow-inducing rush. HELLO, it says: this is the first time Brad Laner has dragged out and dusted off the Medicine name in around eight years, and he's clearly hoping to make an occasion of it. Not that the sound is a complete surprise-- if anything, it feels like the obvious culmination of the noises Laner's spent his long career making. (He's one of those Los Angeles music-biz lifers; his drumming brother even makes him a family lifer, like the Waronkers or the Hadens; he was in Savage Republic when I still had a flat-top; you will never stop this guy making records.) Medicine itself started off as a full band, and one of America's more interesting shoegazer troupes-- partly because Laner's guitar noise had more to do with ear-bleeding buzz than the tripped-out swooning of My Bloody Valentine, and partly because he was one of few to take note of MBV's tentative attraction to tech beats. But Medicine-- after collaborating with both Cocteau Twins and contributing a popular track to The Crow's soundtrack that painted them as gothy dreamers-- fizzled and stalled and shortly split. Since then, Laner's released a record nearly every year as The Electric Company, gravitating toward samplers and computers and a dozen breeds of guitar drone, electronica, Krautrock homage, and IDM tweakery. While this may have struck Medicine's rock fans as some sort of static purgatory, Laner's currently rising star says otherwise: he eventually linked up with Kid606's attention-grabbing Tigerbeat6 label (the Kid programs some drums here), lending him a visibility one imagines helped buoy him back up to the point of reviving Medicine. That, and\x97even though Laner sings quite a bit here\x97the re-addition of a female vocalist: Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce, which brings the whole Crow thing full circle. That's the back-story. The Mechanical Forces of Love, as it turns out, is less a synergy of old-Medicine and Laner's Electric Company excursions and more just a fine-tuned pile-up of them. Both impulses are there, constantly jostling for space, and it's the unpredictable victories of each that make the record a surprising listen: just when you've locked onto a guitar-noise groove, the bottom drops out, revealing a pit of queasily acidic squelches; just when you think you've figured out which recognizable blend of pop and technology Laner's working with, the whole thing turns disorientingly on its head and leaves you hanging. There are times when this makes the record impressive and times when it seems like Laner's too interested in pulling out the rug to ever get the furniture set up. This makes for some gorgeous movements, whose occasionally fleeting appearances in the sifted jumble are half the fun. \x93Best Future\x94 spangles out acoustic guitars and arranges soaring choral harmonies like the airy and crystalline earnestness of His Name Is Alive; \x93I M Yrs\x94 kicks off with a dubby tech groove that's both sort of shocking and just chewily perfect. \x93Astral Gravy,\x94 which follows, is the big resurrection of old-Medicine circa The Buried Life, when Laner realized how great it sounds to filter rootsy guitar-boogie through the dream-pop sound. And above and beyond all of those solid moments, there are countless gorgeous half-minute stretches of meandering dub turns, of psychedelic crescendos, of enveloping atmospheres and out-of-nowhere guitar groans: tech-assisted as it may be, this is a psychedelic record at heart, and those are the bits that count. But even before the rush of the sonics wears off, the flip-side of that is obvious: the flip-side has, in fact, been obvious since Medicine's 1992 debut. Then, as now, there are the odd Medicine tracks that feel disturbingly empty, and not in the good way: the trebly drone or languid low end might be right to get lost in, but they meander less than thrillingly, as if Laner's response to a lack of concrete ideas is to disorient you and then croon druggily as if there's something there. Sometimes there isn't: it's a curious quality, particular to Medicine records, of extended murk with no way inside. With The Mechanical Forces of Love, that's a small caveat: whatever falls through the sieve is worth shrugging off in favor of the nuggets that stay inside. It's a striking return for Laner-as-Medicine\x97a psychedelic record with a robot inside, seriously woozy and surprisingly soul-touched trippiness of the lights-out, headphones-on, I-am-sinking-into-a-bottomless-fog variety. For some it might burn off quickly, but for just as many it'll sit just fine.","This album kicks off aiming to stun, and you can't help but let it: ""As You Do"" bursts in ...

These Are the New Good Times,Pale Horse and Rider,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3beb335119a49ec9b7/1:1/w_160/9f306100.jpg,2003-07-15 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6126-these-are-the-new-good-times/,Darla,"Many tens of years from now, when I'm finally buried at sea, my Styrofoam tombstone will drift forever, stirred only by the occasional tidal swell or passing whale. The epitaph will read, ""Everything was just too damn 'quaint'."" Even now, with Bed, Bath, & Beyonds, Pier One Imports, and Martha Stewart boxing up quaintness and delivering it our doorsteps, only Wal-Mart stands as a bulwark, a final line of cheap, tacky crap to hold back the flood. Of course, it's not enough, and soon we'll all be drowning in a raging torrent of only marginally less tacky, cloyingly ""charming"" crap, and every last handcrafted, authenticity-guaranteed, cried-on-by-an-Amish-kid nugget will have a country-fresh scent. Right now, acoustic folk music is a disturbing mirror of our culture's commodification of all things endearing. Everyone has a tuneful, sappy song to sing. Jon DeRosa, the musical psychologist-cum-supervillain behind the lush, atmospheric recordings of Aarktica, has repeatedly shown a remarkable ability for walking a very fine line: his work as Aarktica is inviting without becoming pandering, warm without becoming stifling, and at times, he has even manages the difficult trick of making his ambient electronic compositions seem both distant and intimate all at once. Seemingly genuine emotion is the key to his successes in that icy genre, and more than anything else, he knows how to express it with even the most impersonal drones. So what happens when that same talent for evoking powerful responses is applied to a genre in which the heartfelt yearning of a Sensitive Singer-Songwriter, the lost loves, the spiritual revelations, has all become just a little...cliché, too expectedly earnest even for the most hackneyed acoustic guitar slinger? Well, if you're as skilled as DeRosa, two things occur. First, you find a refuge in minimal, subtly nuanced arrangements: a sparsely plucked banjo, some stray guitar chords or a piano, and understated, mournful vocals. You find beauty in the soft spaces between notes as well as the notes themselves, and you never once substitute emotional bluster when careful simplicity will suffice. Second, as long as you're singing about God and The One That Got Away, you still kinda fall in that murky goo that all singer-songwriters slog through. Jon DeRosa's work is often truly charming and often deeply affecting, but by choosing to approach folk in such a conventional manner, he blends in with too many also-rans in the languid race for a grand acoustic ballad. DeRosa's gentle voice could be his ace in that pursuit, but why bother? It dominates the Alan Sparhawk (Low) mix so heavily that even when he overcomes the instrumental limitations of the form, it's still consumed by a big-hearted voice too unremarkable to bear the full weight of a melody . It's an interesting choice to hide the music, since it tends to retain a slightly stale genericness and the silences are often the most compelling aspect of the songs, and on top of that, it further sets apart the truly affecting moments of These Are the New Good Times. DeRosa covers his own work (as Aarktica) in a gorgeous, string-heavy rendition of ""Aura Lee"", where replacing the thrumming background gauze of the original with crystalline violins and shedding the thick vocal distortions exposes the melody in it's rawest form. ""Metropolitan Love Song"" and ""Sunday Matinee"" also stand apart from the rest on the strength of the piano and strings, respectively, although at that point it's moot because they're still encumbered by the weight of the genre's (very, very heavy) traditions. De Rosa was better off bringing warmth to the arctic than trying to sell heart to a genre that always has too much to spare.","Many tens of years from now, when I'm finally buried at sea, my Styrofoam tombstone will drift forever, stirred ...

Welcome Crummy Mystics,Frankie Sparo,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5005e6ef959693209d0/1:1/w_160/086aa4b9.jpg,2003-07-15 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7401-welcome-crummy-mystics/,Constellation,"When listening to a downcast, boozy, rough-voiced troubadour, we wait for the moments of vulnerable beauty to shine through. Hearing one of Tom Waits' love songs in a cover version by a traditionally ""good"" singer, for example, can be enjoyable, but it's no match for the real thing. The extra emotional kick in a song like ""I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You"" comes from hearing his mournful croak coughing up the words. During these ballads a voice so raw and everyman becomes a powerful tool for exploring tenderness. Montreal's Frankie Sparo definitely has the rough-voiced part down. That his unschooled wail can make it to record is a testament to the lasting influence of ""anyone can do it"" punk. He could be any drunk perched on a barstool warbling along to the juke. On his debut record My Red Scare, though, Sparo wasn't able to get tunes to take him where his voice wanted to go. There were no melodic gems buried in the old rags and crumpled newspapers. The record sounded nice and had an effective atmosphere, but it only had a couple good songs. Sitting here now I can only remember one actual melody, and I listened to My Red Scare plenty. The good news with Welcome Crummy Mystics, Sparo's second full-length, is that he's improving. He's fleshed out the instrumentation (he toured with A Sliver Mt. Zion and recorded a radio-shot EP with the band called Arena Hostile, and many of the usual Montreal post-rock suspects are here) but more important, he's crafted more memorable songs. The opening \x93Hospitalville\x94 sets the tone: sweeping strings provide sonic lushness while plinking piano and standup bass evoke the lush life of Strayhorx92s dives. And you can hum it. Rubbery acoustic bass and piano also decorate ""My Sister\x94, which is like tuneful music handed down from Tin Pan Alley blended with a dollop of melancholy Weill/Brecht expressionism. When he's not writing grayscale piano ballads, Sparo experiments a bit but this time tosses in the occasional hook. ""Back on Speed"" is dominated by off-key screaming (I mean, he's not even close to the tune) that verges on annoying when the song takes a surprise turn. A stern male chorus in the lengthy outro transforms ""Back on Speed"" into what could be an Eastern European anthem of workers' solidarity. ""Caméra"" has a wonderful Badalamenti thing happening, with a gorgeous tremelo guitar, Sparo's, doubled voice (lyrics here in French) and subtle processed drones elevating a simple song into a kaleidoscopic whirlpool of gauzy nostalgia. There are a few dead spots. ""City As Might Have Been"" in particular seems a throwback to his debut. It opens with a nice string arrangement & throbbing tables, but the melody is nowhere and cax92t be redeemed by the tiny orchestra sawing away. Still, because of its production, even the dead spots are fair. Welcome Crummy Mystics at its worst is so-so orchestral rock from the players that have perfected the form, but those moments when Sparo's songwriting rise to the same level make the record worthwhile.","When listening to a downcast, boozy, rough-voiced troubadour, we wait for the moments of vulnerable beauty to shine through.

Quick-witted, melodic, popular in high school thanks to long hair and witticisms, patient exhibited negligible signs of neurotic disorder until his mid-twenties. Unable to ascertain from babbling what caused the acute case of Roky Barrettius Wilsomnia that's riddled his mind. Motor functions are normal, he responds well to social input from friends; patient's cunctation causes him to slur each utterance of simplistic and pseudo-spiritual rhymes like ""I saw a glimmer...in the eye of any one that...tried...to shine...with...the light from inside...it's unbeatable I find "" at a painful pace. Imitation of George Harrison, bending note for note on ""All Right"" a possibility. Echopraxia and palipraxia continue throughout. Dr. Mitchum has previously reported on the frightening possibility of future patients as irrationally obsessed with Jeff Lynne's career, hair (and moustache/beard) care products, and the seventies studio effects he conjured. Deduce that songs like ""So the Blood"" and ""The Fear"" reveal more the tendency for delusional emulation of white-suited softy Wayne Coyne. Promises of an innocent ear for melody are present in the above examples, but perceptions have been distorted in Bobby B.'s mind.

Subdued harmonizing as the guitar, air organ, and tambourine reach a mild state; satisfactory, but observers are unable to determine whom the patient is singing with. Most distressing: patient's inability to organize speech into patterns that express the more complex thoughts usually associated with severe acid damage. Insipid rhymes like ""I Said 'Oh,' the Wind Said 'No!'"" are but one example. Further investigation has yet to unearth any womb/tomb, breath/death, life/strife simplistic word games on more abstract themes, but song titles like ""I Hope/ I Grow"" and ""The Flood/ The Blood"" reveal more grave indications of stoned semantic infatuation. The patient's day work, which he calls Born Free Forever, as an overall realization fails, instead documenting a maddening non-distinct tedium. Suspect oculoglyria and inability to focus.

Come Here When You Sleepwalk,Clue to Kalo,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a607b1335d7bf1698d2f/1:1/w_160/9d876e73.jpg,2003-07-14 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1520-come-here-when-you-sleepwalk/,Mush,"""Dreamy""-- that hackneyed descriptor of quiet, bedroom IDM/electronica-- carries heavy metaphoric baggage. Many still believe dreams come from rapid batting of our eyelids, sometimes at a rate of up to one hundred or one-hundred and twenty times per minute. Our sight sphere sheaths flutter energetically-- albeit, nearly undetectably-- and because of them, an otherwise motionless body moves about freely at night in a world to which only the mind is privy: the land of dreams, the land of make-believe. Without such kinetic energy, that very same body remains betwixt its sheets, and the mind nary leaves the pillow. Put simply, there's a fine line between the greatest revelatory dream and the most inconsequential night of sleep. On Come Here When You Sleepwalk, Clue To Kalo-- aka Australia's Mark Mitchell-- walks that line, as have Dntel, Boards of Canada, Ulrich Schnauss, and occasionally Schneider TM before him. Mitchell even seems to acknowledge his tenuous position: both sides of the disc are unmarked and reflective, the division between content and coaster frustratingly blurred. The album is beautiful enough: it has the lush washes of sound, the simple, sparingly-used voice blended in, the nostalgic, lovelorn lyrics replete with a tinge of cynicism, all essential nocturnal vocabulary. When these sounds seek to transcend into dreams, though, it ultimately comes down to those subtle, nearly undetectable flutters of energy; intangibles transform pretty but otherwise stagnant sound, building, collapsing and coming to a logical conclusion. Come Here When You Sleepwalk contains a few such inspired, dream-inducing interludes, but overall, constitutes an array of well-crafted sonic images that frustratingly go nowhere. As if to performatize our foray into his dream world, Clue to Kalo spends the first forty-five seconds of ""The First Song of the Rest of Your Life""-- nearly half the track-- easing up the volume level until we're adequately enveloped in its waves, vocal echoes, and martian beats. He lets it fester, only to cut off the track suddenly and begin the only close-to-perfect song on the album, and one of the best I've heard this year: ""Empty Save The Oxygen"" A processed guitar fumbles initially, then finds itself as a subtle, driving pulse; it churns throughout as electronic ticks and whisps dance in the background. Mitchell emerges quietly, but confidently on vocals: "" I'd like to love you, but I'd like a lot of things."" It's a song that, if we ever had the choice, our fed-up lovers would sing to us on the eve of our breakups, sparing the equivocation of ""I still want us to be friends."" ""Empty Save The Oxygen"" is no new take on Humanity's Bout With Inevitable Personal Disappointment, but unlike songs with similar emotional content, it refuses to wallow. Indeed, as Mitchell retires on vocals, it's invigorated by a profound optimism-- everything is clearer, the ticks become more precise and concentrated, the beat more present. Everything sucks, but everything is going to be okay. After this truly exhilarating opening, the rest of the album makes for poor man's imitation-- especially since Clue to Kalo's palette is more or less fixed. The songs are frustratingly stagnant-- albeit beautiful-- exercises in lap-pop textures. This would be fine-- wonderful even-- would that the same level of inner energy present in ""Empty Save the Oxygen"" came through, but unfortunately, with the exception of the deftly executed ""This Dies Over Distance"" and the 11-minute sonic rollercoaster ""Still We Felt Bulletproof"", shapes hardly shift. The listener is left with pretty loops, but hardly the carefully considered songs Clue to Kalo has already shown he can compose. Had Come Here When You Sleepwalk been released three or four years ago, it would have been highly regarded if only by merit of its sound. But as the lap-pop genre has grown leaps and bounds, both musically and technologically, it's become formulaic: simple ear candy isn't impressive anymore. Song structure-- the ""pop"" element of ""lap-pop""-- is playing catch-up to electronica's sonic triumphs. At his best, Clue to Kalo shows he has a unique sensibility, capable of advancing the genre's subtle electronic shoegazing. Here's hoping his next release delivers; it should be fantastic.","""Dreamy""-- that hackneyed descriptor of quiet, bedroom IDM/electronica-- carries heavy metaphoric baggage.

New York Noise,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e313d1975652139519/1:1/w_160/80dbed78.jpg,2003-07-14 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1989-new-york-noise/,Soul Jazz,"It's not a political stance per se, but I'm enamored with the idea of music being made by non-musicians. I fantasize what the music of meek secretaries, overweight bus drivers and Puerto Rican produce stockers might sound like, as opposed to what I hear being made every day by bored college kids, whiny singer-songwriters, and people with good bad-hair. Always a hotbed for artistic fecundity, the East Village and Lower East Side have stumbled a bit these last two decades, and I lose hope that the accountants, legal consultants, and human resources co-coordinators that now inhabit the area will be coming with the shit-hot sounds anytime soon. While a select few characters documented on Soul Jazz's latest, earnest compilation have gone onto careers playing music (Ikue Mori, Arto Lindsey, Glenn Branca, Bill Laswell), at the time contained within--1978 to 1982-- many of them were occupied with other disciplines: film, drama, painting, photography, performance art, design, fashion, audio production, etc., and would stay within these professions, the music a mere component in life's other pursuits. ""Optimo"", Liquid Liquid's A side to their more-often celebrated flip ""Cavern"" (sampled by Grandmaster Melle Mel for ""White Lines""), opens the set with a cowbell-driven blast of snares, clavé, booty-throbbing bass kicks, roto-toms, and elastic bass that blows past the produced percussion stomps by the likes of A Certain Ratio and !!!. Mars' ""Helen Forsdale""-- the sole escapee of No New York's black hole-- remains as vital and dark as ever, the two and a half minutes exhilerates like a leap off of the Manhattan Bridge. DNA's track from the American Clavé single similarly excites in this one-minute context. Glenn Branca, Pitchfork's last recipient of the 10.0, represents the avant-garde that also took roots in the LES with his first composition for two electric guitars. Chiming and grinding as chimeras, ""Lesson No.1"" predicts entire band career trajectories with the eight-minute piece. His previous band's only single, the Theoretical Girls' ""You Got Me"", grafts amplified anvil hits to the chord progression from ""Trans-Europe Express"" and a bludgeoning guitar attack that will in ten years' time be called Helmet. If ""Rapper's Delight"" is the Odyssey of hip-hop, is ""Beat Bop"" its Ulysses? This epic by Rammelzee and K. Rob (along with painter Jean Michel Basquiat in the studio producing) contains so many mutant strains of the genre's DNA that each time through reveals whole new levels of meaning. My first time hearing it on Ego Trip's compilation a few years ago disclosed the wellspring of countless songs, samples, and careers of some of hip-hop's finest, like the Beastie Boys (I count at least five songs) and (in every aspect) Cypress Hill. Contained within the duo's constant flow of back and forth rhymes at once funky, randomly off the dome, street observational, laid-back, complicated, alien-tweaked, and socially conscious are layouts for other adventurous types like De La Soul, Slick Rick, the Pharcyde, Kool Keith, Quasimoto, Old Dirty Bastard, and Outkast. The sounds of late 70's funk radio is obvious throughout; from the mocked hi-hat chatter, disco choruses, canned handclaps, and bright horn bursts to the naïf-Nile Rodgers sleek slap bass bottom and chopped guitar comping of so many Philly Soul joints are attempted in both the awkward playing and bare-bones production, mostly to endearing effect. When slide guitars are stirred in, as on the Contortions' ""Contort Yourself"" and Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Wawa"", it makes for the funky correlation of the arrhythmic and atonal guitar jags of Captain Beefheart and his, uh, Dazz Band. ""Reduction"", an early Material track, before Bill Laswell went on to weave radio staples like Whitney Houston (then-unknown), Nona Hendryx, and Bootsy Collins into the mix, even shows a fondness for early musique concrète and Cage's imaginary landscapes, dropping snippets of religious broadcasts into their studious funk and paving the way to future sound collaging, from the Butthole Surfers to DJ Shadow. Arthur Russell, the criminally forgotten cellist, Allen Ginsburg accompanist, minimalist composer, narrowly-averted Talking Head, and creator of exquisite Paradise Garage staples and proto-house sides like ""Go Bang #5"", ""Kiss Me Again"", and ""Tell You Today"" has another piece rescued from the unissued catalog: ""Clean On Your Bean"". While there are jumping off points from ""Go Bang #5"", Russell stirs echoing group chatter as lyrics, rippling guitar, fusiony organ stabs, congos, cello strokes, and trombones to delirious effect, letting Francois Kevorkian sort it out in the mix. It's long-winded at seventy-one minutes, as most Soul Jazz overviews tend to stay concise (their post-punk counterpart from the UK, In the Beginning was Rhythm, was a half-hour shorter), but trying to assimilate all the important foundations that arose out of this particular lot of ground is near impossible. Lydia Lunch and James ""Blood"" Ulmer are left out, unfortunately, but there are many vying for its cramped space, and inclusion of The Dance and The Blood surprises. From hip-hop to no-wave, jazz-punk disco to house music to electroclash, sleek funk to crusty noise, there's a lot to cover, and Soul Jazz does the job admirably, touring the biggest landmarks and some of the interesting diversions not on the map, but nonetheless co-existing side-by-side.","It's not a political stance per se, but I'm enamored with the idea of music being made by ...

The Man on the Burning Tightrope,Firewater,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda5eb335119a49ecf03/1:1/w_160/292cd06a.jpg,2003-07-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3069-the-man-on-the-burning-tightrope/,Jetset,"Never liked the circus. I wasn't a curmudgeonly kid, but the notion of the Big Top always filled me with dull dread. Some entertainments are simply meant to die, replaced by snazzier, safer and/or more sophisticated forms of leisure. And that's good-- that's progress. The mystery play, bangsawan and blackface burlesque are all happily retired diversions, subject to occasional, ironic revisitation or ill-informed nostalgia. But the circus somehow perseveres with its cruelty to animals, displays of aimless skill, terrible sex politics and-- last but not least-- abominable music. Which is where Tod Ashley-- frontman of Firewater-- and I part ways. He loves the circus. This much can be confirmed by a quick glance at the Firewater's record covers, but any track off The Man on the Burning Tightrope-- even more so than the band's three previous records-- reveals a wealth of swirly organs, squawking accordions, crunchy snares and carny-barker vocals. Before I start talking about the songs, let's make a pact. If you happen to like this sort of sensibility, if you need something to tie you over between Tiger Lilies records, and finally, if you thought the Zoot Suit Riots of '97 were the best thing since Tom Waits...then by all means disregard my sour tone, take everything that follows as praise, and multiply the record's rating by the factor of 1.5. Oh, and know that I hate Cirque du Soleil, too. The opening instrumental ""Fanfare"" sets the tone with a horn section breathing fire over exaggerated, dramatic rolls (the album was produced by the band's Israeli-born drummer, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, mixed to showcase the rhythm section). ""Anything at All"" follows, with Ashley croaking come-ons like ""If I were a memory I'd creep into your head."" It bears mentioning that Firewater's lyrics are a bit on the eye-rolling side, with a preponderance of weak verb rhymes (""Everybody lies/ Loves/ Lives/ Cries/ Tries/ Dies,"" this sort of thing). By the third track-- the boringly-titled ""Too Much (Is Never Enough)""-- Ashley's vocal affectations suddenly bring to mind Smash Mouth. Considering that we're talking about the former frontman of Cop Shoot Cop, that is a sad, sad sentence to write. ""Too Many Angels"" is the first to fully make good on the circus theme, and culminates in a fantastic, squeaky solo that may blow your left speaker. From here on, the band settles firmly into the antic-roadshow act that doesn't let up for the rest of the record. The title song even devolves into a Sgt. Pepper skit: ""Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the one-- the only-- the Man on the Burning Tightrope!"" In its second half, Ashley's concept-heavy contraption begins to run out of steam. ""Secret"" stoops to set answering-machine messages to music and ""Ponzi's Revenge"" is an instrumental allusion to Firewater's second album, The Ponzi Scheme. The album winds up with not one but two-- two!-- reprises of earlier tracks: ""Dark Days Revisited"", a faux-Slavic stomp with a gypsy choir, and a superfluous return of ""Fanfare"".

Wired for Sound,Soundmurderer,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e3ea9e61561daa4ff9/1:1/w_160/25da1c65.jpg,2003-07-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7375-wired-for-sound/,Violent Turd,"Another year, another revival, and this time it's jungle being resurrected and re-evaluated. In the hands of Soundmurderer, dj/Rupture (aka Nettle) and the rest of the Broklyn Beats series contributors, and a new wave of Brazilian producers, jungle's resurgence focuses primarily on the more gruff, harsh ragga crossover, an oddly non-dancefloor-oriented revisionism that negates most connections to anything light or feminine or-- oddly-- the communal sensibility rooted in rave. Wired for Sound collects three mixes of jungle-ragga mashups. In total, there are 60 tracks here-- most of which were first released on vinyl-only in the mid-1990s-- spread over 70 minutes, although it's not necessary for one to have a sense of the song's or genre's history to enjoy it. The mix combines the moments of release-- the peaks of each track-- so there are no breakdowns and a total absence of any sort of ebb-and-flow dynamic. Instead, it's an exquisitely blended scrum, an exhausting high-speed compact consolidation of harsh rhythm and sonic sludge best listened to one mix at a time than in one 70-minute setting. Unlike many of the releases on the purposefully low-key Violent Turd (Kid606's bastard-pop label), Wired for Sound isn't a smothering of pop sensibilities in splatter beats and sonic goo. Instead, it's a flat-out denial of some of the more pop elements of jungle-- omissions that will irk some, but no doubt be welcome to others. So while Detroit-based Soundmurderer (Todd Osborn, with help from Tadd Mullinix) resurrects jungle, it does so with a very selective memory. There is certainly a bit of self-serving revisionist history on display here as Osborn is celebrating the template in which his own ragga-jungle music-- to date only available on 12-inch singles-- is rooted, but he's not passing the mixes off as a definitive compilation or even an accurate representation of the time or scene, so no bother. The three mixes focus on the infancy of jungle: the explicit influence of high-speed, sometimes Caribbean rhythms and ragga rude bwoys on hardcore rave. Like dj/Rupture's Minesweeper Suite-- also released on Violent Turd-- they draw connections between the rhythms of the ghettoized people of different cultures, placing the fruits of Jamaican soundclashes next to Nation of Islam-inspired jungle such as Kement Crew's ""Truth Over Falsehood"". Leaving room for ragga artists such as Barrington Levy, Cutty Ranks, Ninjaman, and Dennis Brown, Soundmurderer is mostly interested in interpretations of their rhythms and postures, a reimagination of jungle as the dark music of swaggering almost gangsta individuals rather than the domain of communality. Even though it was artists like Shy FX-- included here-- who first broke jungle in the UK charts, this bass- and dancehall-heavy style soon dissipated, replaced by the often jazz-oriented, whitewashed ""intelligent"" drum and bass that hastened jungle's mostly ignominious ending. So although Osborn clearly suffers tunnel vision, his focus on the paranoia and dread of darkcore is as welcome a narrow focal point as he could have chosen. And with ragga written out of too much of the unofficial history of jungle, it's a potentially crucial one as well. Yet while Soundmurderer rescues the thrill of jungle from the head music boredom of its offshoots, the velocity, ferocity, and monolithic force of his mashups makes also negates any possibility that he is making dance music. Because we're without a community or social structure with which to engage with others through jungle-- there are almost no jungle club nights in the U.S.-- that oddly makes a bit of sense. However if jungle did undergo a true renaissance, it would be a shame were it to do so through this haughty, IDM lens. On Wired for Sound, we're offered the rhythmic innovation of early jungle and ragga, but matched with the chin-stroking and quasi-art home music of ambient drum and bass. It's a wonderful, crucial reminder of why jungle was one of the 90s true high points, but-- like the work of Squarepusher or a lot of Kid606's other sonic prankster cohorts-- shows a curious unwillingness to value or even acknowledge its body-first roots. It may be a straw man's history of jungle, but it's also a solid, succinct argument for why it's so beloved; sort of a greatest breaks collection that, although you can't dance to it, has a revolutionary beat.","Another year, another revival, and this time it's jungle being resurrected and re-evaluated.

Electric Turn to Me,Electric Turn to Me,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3a13d197565213b28b/1:1/w_160/274bb4ff.gif,2003-07-13 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2737-electric-turn-to-me/,No Quarter,"New York's Electric Turn to Me should be a lesson to us all. Counting two former members of the excellent but defunct Laddio Bolocko, and fronted by a German woman called Silke-- clearly unafraid of bringing the drama like Siouxsie used to do-- the band should add up to a fairly sizeable fish in the tiny, usually refreshing pond of neo art-rock. However, some funny things happened on the way to the next big thing: sinister theatrics became campy cabaret, digital age psychedelia lapsed into flat, by-the-numbers post-rock, and a modern take on the otherworldly grandeur of The Doors became a lightweight, impotent Jane's Addiction run-through. The lesson-- especially for Laddio Bolocko fans-- might be that you can't always get what you want. For anyone else, maybe something like ""steer clear of falling stars."" Electric Turn to Me was formed last summer, apparently inspired by eccentric 60s psyche-pop acts like Love and Pretty Things, though to my ears not even in the same universe. Where the Pretty Things were scruffy mod rockers with hearts of art, sounding as convincing on the folk-laced ""Private Sorrow"" as they did on all-out jams like ""Walking Through My Dreams"", ETTM seem a tad forced. It doesn't help that their bassless lineup often fails to really bring the power during frequent ""climactic"" moments, though they do pump up the tympanis on occasion-- yeah! Still, none of that compares to vocalist Silke, who is polarization personified. Her voice is, shall we say, distinctive. Her vibrato is...positively traumatic. For better or for worse, she dominates this music with a thick, wavering tone and Teutonic dread that gives me sore throat just thinking about it. It's not going to take most folks long to determine if they can handle her. The best moment on Electric Turn to Me is its first 30 seconds, as the band blasts out of the gate on ""First Crimes"" playing hyperspeed, electro-fied rocket rock very reminiscent of Laddio Bolocko. And then, she happens. ""FIRRRRST CRIIIIMES, EVERYDAYNIGHTWHENTHEMOONTHOUGHTSOFYERSIDE."" Well, I can't really tell what she's singing, but her message is loud and clear: bow down before my black terror, o subjects of despair! The vampire movie organ that accompanies her does a nice job of transforming the vibe from threepenny operatic tension into is-this-supposed-to-be-funny rocky horror. A minute later, Silke manages to unleash the full power of her sonic arsenal, and all I can think of is that scene in Lord of the Rings when Cate Blanchett freaks out and turns silver and blue. ""Watch Out for the Witch"" is slightly less over the top, though clearly the band missed an opportunity here when they titled the record. Drummer Blake Fleming's ultra-tight pulse, alongside the clipped, distorted keyboard figure make for a decent (and mercifully straightforward-- never thought I'd be so grateful for that) backdrop over which Silke plays it cool for a little bit. Of course, she lets loose in the chorus, but the song itself isn't a bad update on 60s rock opera a la S.F. Sorrow. ""Nightvision"", on the other hand, is pretty dreadful: Silke visits the other extreme of her vocal repertoire, opting for moaning, wavering strains while the band is relegated to the unenviable role of trying to keep the ballad moving lest it dissolve into art-show melodrama. They manage to do this best during the more intense sections, as Fleming hacks at his cymbal and guitarist James Wilk offers a few arpeggios that wouldn't sound out of place on Simple Minds song. Remember, these are the good parts. Despite my various reservations with Electric Turn to Me, I'm not without hope. There is a faint connection between the devastating bombast of Silke and the eccentric (but expressive) work of Dagmar Krause (formerly of Slapp Happy and the Art Bears). Perhaps, like Krause and her bands, Silke and ETTM will develop a sound that makes better use of their various strengths, as I'm certain there must be away to make this mix work. Until then, tread carefully.","New York's Electric Turn to Me should be a lesson to us all. Counting two former members of the ...

Goldcard,Goldcard,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf5a13d197565213b895/1:1/w_160/bf1f8598.jpg,2003-07-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3500-goldcard/,Off,"Her forehead floating a mere two inches above her desk, she barely noticed the end of young Mr. Lytle's show and tell presentation, for his latest musical project ""Sumday"". This particular afternoon of Rock 'N Roll Grade School had been especially boring, even for the positive and fresh-out-of-college Mrs. Mimms: she had optimistically chosen a Friday to allow everyone in her class a chance to share with their peers what they'd been working on recently. Thus far, her expectations had been met with tired, subdued results, but she was hopeful yet that some special student would rise above the rest, and offer some delight on an otherwise dreary afternoon. ""Thank you Jason for that...interesting performance,"" she said, barely forcing a smile. ""And now could Charlie Campbell please come up front and share with us his,"" Mimms rifled through some papers before cautiously continuing, ""Goldcard project?"" A small box in the corner with a narrow horizontal slit in one of its sides began to make its way clumsily to the head of the classroom, bumping into desks, chairs and students along the way. The box approached Mrs. Mimms, whispered something quietly in her direction and situated itself to the left of her desk. With a bewildered look on her face, she addressed the class, ""It seems that Mr. Campbell has made a deal with Off Records' president Chris Slusarenko regarding his public appearances: (1) he is not to be seen or touched while the album is playing, and (2) he will communicate with us via only the slit in his box."" She sighed and added, ""So without further delay, Charlie."" ""Thank you very much, Mrs. Mimms. I would like to start by saying that none of this would be happening if it was not for the efforts of Chris and my friends in Grandaddy and Quasi, because without their constant badgering I would have never compiled all of the Goldcard tapes into the album you are about to hear. I would also like to thank my former bandmates in Pond, Chris Brady and Dave Triebwasser, for their help in the following recordings."" There was a rustling noise from inside the box, then slowly, music began to seep forth from its tape-covered edges, organic and fragile with a sliding glissando quickly leading to what sounded like a metallic-tinged series of arpeggios. ""This is the first track, and it is untitled, as are many of the songs on Goldcard. That sound you hear is what I refer to throughout the project as 'the gimmick'; basically it is a guitar technique that approximates the sound of an electric string orchestra, and it is the basis of what inspired me to keep producing music after Pond's fallout with Sony in 1998. I recorded most of these tracks utilizing the gimmick, but then I lost sight of what the technique was-- though I guess I could have asked Ronald Jones, of the Flaming Lips, or Duane Denison, of Jesus Lizard, to remind me of it-- and with it the confidence in my ability to compose excellent pop songs."" Charlie continued, ""The next composition is 'We Only Doubt Which Theory We Will Be Proving First'. This recording includes Sam Coomes and Rebecca Gates, who were present for the one and only true Goldcard practice. The metallic jangle you hear in the acoustic guitar is achieved through the use of a quarter as a pick. The gimmick is used liberally in this track, the bass line acting as a lower register mirror to its skittering brightness. This same idea is carried through to 'Destroy and Recreate', which uses warm guitar effects and my own quivering falsetto to deliver abstract lines alluding to the alluring embrace of anonymity such as, 'From a dancing bear/ Subtract a waltz/ We slowly stop counting/ When long division keeps us apart.' It's similar to Coomes' Quasi-technique of deceptively accompanying even the most somber and challenging lyrical content with a dazzling and poppy beat!"" ""'Didn't Feel A Thing', 'Picture Of A Horse', and track twelve all utilize the talents of my former bandmates Chris and Dave, augmenting the regular, sort of lilting Goldcard sound with a heavier hand. It alternates between a backwoods plucking steel guitar to the sound of golden-age Alterna-Rock like Archers of Loaf, Grifters, or Superchunk. But 'Rabbit', 'If I Could Help It', and track sixteen are my return to basic indie-pop roots, all displaying the talents of either Grandaddy's old-fashioned guitar-crunches and subtle melodies, Janet Weiss' methodical drumming, or gimmick-less harmonizing courtesy of Beach Boys-aficionado Sam Coomes."" ""You may have noticed that tracks seven through nine seem slightly incoherent. Though number seven-- originally 'Outside Suite' from the Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel concept album-- is pretty saccharine compared to the drum and bass on number eight and the Vietnamese disco song that follows, they serve their purpose, fanning the range of my concept and building on multiple musical ideas. Disjointed as they are, this all comes to fruition in 'Birthday', which is an experiment in tempo that I believe to be the world's most ambient hardcore track, a gospel delivery recorded at 200 beats per minute. The composition is meant to provide an interesting counterpoint for the slowly evolving pulse that arises from the backdrop of sonic trickery."" ""'It Had A Dream' and 'A Fascinated Eye Production' both allude to what eventually eclipsed my fascination with the gimmick and led to my final fallout with music in general-- 'It.' 'It' is either the idea of Universal Love/GOD, or an inside joke between myself and Robert Pollard regarding the alcohol content of Nyquil-- you be the judge. Either way, the extremely long coda rounding out 'Fascinated Eye..."" is meant to allow the listener time to contemplate what 'It' is to you. Even though I still haven't resolved 'It', I hope that through this album you will gain some small insight into my personage, and more importantly your own. After all, that is part-in-part the intent of music, and more broadly, art."" The box grew silent, and Mrs. Mimms could not hold back the swelling in her heart brought about by the sincere exposure Charlie had just shown the class and inevitably the world at large. This was the type of work she had been waiting on for quite some time now, wading through countless poseurs and pretenders to the crown just to find that such a rare and unassuming gem as Goldcard was beneath her very nose. In terms of both talent and originality, Campbell had proven himself the best of his class, though it was a bittersweet victory in that this would probably be the last release to bare his privileged mark. Somehow that only added to the romantic nature of such a work though, as it suddenly struck her as poetic that Charlie had ended his career on such a high note. As far as she was concerned his legacy was now cemented, her gratefulness in his courage to finally release Goldcard far outweighing any anger at never having another taste of his undeniable talent.","Her forehead floating a mere two inches above her desk, she barely noticed the end of young Mr. Lytle's ...

The Blues Is a Minefield,V-Twin,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a907c0084474cd0c0f6c/1:1/w_160/4e1278ce.gif,2003-07-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8388-the-blues-is-a-minefield/,Domino,"Sometimes a song is so good, it just forces you to notice a band and acknowledge their brilliance, no matter what the rest of their stuff sounds like. V-Twin have one of those songs, a tricky little electro-blues-punk freakout called ""Delinquency"" that's so great they've used it four times and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The band's first long-player-- the singles compilation Free the Twin-- contained three different versions, including remixes by Royal Trux and Jagz Kooner, each of which was so unstintingly brilliant, I was convinced nothing but great things lay ahead for them. It didn't hurt that the rest of the disc was pretty good, too. Well, three years later, they're still riding ""Delinquency"", this time with a denser, less dubbed-out version that simply proves that all the tampering in the world couldn't ruin this song. From the signature divebombing drum fills to singer Jason McPhail's declaration ""I reckon rock 'n' roll's from outer space,"" there are so many perfect elements in place that it's impossible to kill this tune's two-chord genius. But while the song's fourth incarnation is the undeniable high point of the album, the Glaswegian foursome is so full of ideas and Northern swagger that they couldn't help but pull together an interesting album. If the Beta Band are the Linus of British eclecticism, clinging to a blanket of tape-speed effects and UK electronica, then V-Twin are certainly the Pigpen, swimming in a constant swirl of studio dirt and rock and roll dust. ""Get Your Wings"" is video game music you can drink cocktails to, topped with fake mellotron and McPhail's White Album-era Lennon croon; ""V-Twin City Rockers"" has those bleepy Trio synths flopping all over its fuzzy bass line and winds up sounding like Primal Scream simultaneously remixing Kraftwerk and Kylie Minogue. And then there's ""the Emperor Is Dead"", a slow dirge that ropes in the horn section from King Crimson's Lizard and pastes them uncomfortably amidst McPhail's unintelligible pontificating and drunken programmed drums. Of course, it's possible to be so full of ideas that they start turning into bullshit, and they do in small patches, particularly on closer ""Across the Lanes"", which loses all focus as a direct result of its overabundant use of echo and effects. Likewise, the band apparently spent so much time fine-tuning all the flittering whirligigs and sputtering doodads on ""Despot Blues"" that they forgot to write a real melody for it. But this ceases to be important when you're taking in the splendid mayhem of opener ""Call a Meeting"", a Jasper Johns collage of a song, pasting Albert Ayler horns, Stones bluster and garage sludge into a Pro-Tweaked barrage that bursts every so often into absolutely ecstatic guitar riffs. It's a mess, but what a glorious mess it is. The blues hits every mine in the field here, and the explosions are almost uniformly cool. Rock and roll is a great genre precisely because of its malleability, and though I'd never say these four Scots who named themselves for a Harley Davidson engine type are here to save rock, they do a damn fine job of exploiting its possibilities. If nothing else, you have to love a band that knows what they're doing is fraught with danger, yet refuses to tread lightly.","Sometimes a song is so good, it just forces you to notice a band and acknowledge their brilliance, no matter ...

The Ownerz,Gang Starr,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee9eb335119a49ed12b/1:1/w_160/201f7edb.jpg,2003-07-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3391-the-ownerz/,Virgin,"Some bands embrace consistency, others shy away, possibly fearing the alure of comfortability and the possible stagnation it might eventually result in. For established artists, there's no more sleep-depriving quandry than whether to stick with a successful, proven formula or throw it all out the window in favor of a radical change. But even for a few of those lucky superstars, it just comes naturally, without any deep contemplation. Critically speaking, bands who gravitate toward change get high marks for their willingness to continually invent and to challenge convention; the water-treaders simply get fans. It's unfair on any number of levels, I suppose, but it's with that understanding that I declare Gang Starr among the most consistent acts in hip-hop. Ever since Step in the Arena and Daily Operation laid down the law for East Coast hip-hop back in '91 and '92, Gang Starr have slowed their pace with an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" aesthetic, releasing albums every four or five years between Guru and DJ Premier's increasingly busy extracurricular schedules. And while they haven't broken any new ground since those early 90s classics, their records have been astoundingly solid in bearing the standards set by those canonical discs. In the five years since Moment of Truth, Guru and Primo have watched as the face of mainstream hip-hop hardened into a countenance chiseled out with bling-bling braggadocio and self-hating diatribes. Fortunately, for a duo that's been hard from day one-- don't let that No More Mr. Nice Guy cover fool you-- there's a distinct possibility their credibility could translate into commercial success, almost as if the rap world has finally caught up with a group that was ten years ahead of its time. The combination of Guru's tough, streetwise lyrics and delivery and Premier's highly polished production fits in perfectly as an honest alternative to today's heavy rotation; it's a situation Gang Starr are well aware of, judging from several lyrical and interlude reminders that pop up throughout The Ownerz. The record's first single, ""Skills"", is a prime example of its overall potential to launch Gang Starr into the mainstream with the respect they've enjoyed in the underground intact. Carried by the kind of popping bassline and sucka-challenging bravado that's powered all of their classic cuts, it's incredibly catchy without being overtly commercial. Throw in a couple of high-profile cameos-- most notably Jadakiss' firespitting verse on ""Rite Where U Stand"" and Snoop Dogg's right-at-home drawling over Premier's ""In This Life..."" beat (returning the favor of some beats Primo cooked up for his Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$ LP)-- and The Ownerz could accomplish that rarest of feats: commercial success that doesn't require a sacrifice of integrity. Naturally, not all of the guest spots are wildly triumphant-- back-to-back appearances by Fat Joe, M.O.P., Big Shug and Freddie Foxx on ""Who Got Gunz"" and ""Capture (Militia Pt. 3)"" make for a thuggish lag right in the middle of the record, but the flow gets right back in line with the pair of cameo-free tracks that follow. As has been customary on Gang Starr records since Daily Operation, Guru steps aside for some young emcees to prove their worth on the mic: NYG'z and H. Stax contribute solid verses to ""Same Team, No Games"" and Smiley the Ghetto Child absolutely tears shit up-- like a young Nas or Jeru the Damaja-- on the brief ""Werdz From The Ghetto Child"". Still, even though the guest spots cover a wide range of hip-hop status levels, they all work to enforce Guru and Premier's aesthetic of consistency-- whether it's Jadakiss or NYG'z, the emcee has to make his style work with Gang Starr, not the other way around. But all this talk of cameos distracts from all the unassisted cuts that prove Guru and Premier haven't lost an ounce of chemistry in their 14 years together. Primo's jazzy horn breaks underscore Guru's eloquent manifestos with assured refinement on every single track they turn on their own (which, impressively for a major-label hip-hop release, is over half the record), even redeeming what would've been the record's weakest cut with a bit of imagination: a reposession of Curtis Mayfield's ""Kung Fu"" that makes Guru's mack move narrative on ""Nice Girl, Wrong Place"" a little easier to stomach. For the record, Guru's candor and lack of romanticism are rather refreshing in this context-- just like hot pants, what you see is what you get. The Ownerz will have to hold Gang Starr fans over while Premier contracts out beats for usually the only good cuts on otherwise sub-par rap records, and Guru releases another tepid Jazzmatazz or (God forbid) Baldhead Slick & da Click LP. We can't expect a new Gang Starr record until 2007 or 2008, but in the meantime, there's plenty here to celebrate for consistency's sake-- because for what they've lacked in evolution, Guru and Premier have more than repaid in reliability. And while it's probably too late in their career for a breakout hit record, more people are definitely going to know who they are, which will hopefully translate into the same veneration from the establishment they've enjoyed from their fans since back in the day.","Some bands embrace consistency, others shy away, possibly fearing the alure of comfortability and the possible stagnation it might eventually ...

Cardia,Cardia,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5205e6ef95969320a20/1:1/w_160/1632f708.jpg,2003-07-10 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1302-cardia/,Silverthree,"After nearly fifteen minutes, our group still could not decide on a reasonably cool name to bestow upon the limp pink flesh laid out beneath the hovering and sharpened blade. The leading candidates were Sir Porks-A-Lot and Lord Piggington. The reason for our prolonged contemplation? Aside from this being the first cadaver any of us had ever analyzed, this particular fetal pig had something going for it that even Charlotte couldn't have spun a web about. While everyone else had a run-of-the-mill wee-hog, ours was delivered straight from the bucket with a full-on goatee and a wrap-around mark across its back. He was wearing a black leather biker's jacket. It was incredible-- our own Hell's Angel Hog-- and we couldn't have such a cool pig sporting anything but an appropriately hip and regal name. For the sake of time, the group eventually compromised and decided on Elvis Pigsley before cutting into his lower abdomen. Upon dissection we unfortunately discovered another unsettling surprise about The King: though he looked relatively normal on the outside, his insides were incomplete and nonfunctional. Underdeveloped lungs, esophagus, and intestines, the pig didn't even have a functioning heart. DOA. He was lucky to have never seen the outside world; it saved him the pain and harm exposure would have inevitably brought in tow. A similar battle between style and substance-- function sacrificed at the altar of maintaining a dim facade of cool-- played out as I listened to Cardia's self-titled debut, released by Mike Harbin's (Burning Airlines) new label, Silverthree Sound. Choosing not to rely upon any epidermal or follicular peculiarities to forge their reputations, Cardia instead use the wonderful power of press release hype, which points their sound squarely toward the vicinity of Radiohead, U2, and Jeff Buckley. The origin of this comparison is more than likely linked to the admittedly beautiful voice of Ian Love (formerly of Rival Schools), outfitted in part by the large guitar sound of St. John Scott IV (Shudder To Think) and the loping rhythm section comprised of percussionist Andy Action (2 Skinnee J's) and bassist/MENSA candidate Brad Vanderark (The Verve Pipe). Constituents in place, the group doesn't suffer from lack of technical proficiency or musical experience, instead only coming short in the area that one could argue matters the most in pop music: the hook. While it's not antagonistically bothersome that ""Crash"" bears more than a passing resemblance to Bends-era Radiohead-- Love's Yorke-ian coos and sways atop a deeply syncopated rhythm and spacey guitar effects-- it is a nagging nuisance that Cardia seems to have taken the wonderful elements of that familiar sound and shunted them into a song bereft of any meaty or gratifying catch. In the same way, ""Stars"" hints at a mellower ""Airbag"" before diving into a neutered guitar line, effectively debasing a tune I could have proudly whistled to my grave. Further shrouding themselves in some semblance of seminal UK rock, the band's subject matter tends toward an interpersonal politic that makes wide use of isolationist metaphors and relationship analogies. Once again-- though their heart is in the right place-- Cardia seems to miss the lyrical point: the draw of such themes is the allusion to content, not the dogmatic force-feeding of lines like, ""When the feelings come back to me/ I want them gone"" (""Never Feel""). ""Our Love Is Real"" doesn't redeem the sentiment either in its pithiness-- ""And sometimes I feel like/ It's alright to be in love""-- made further unpalatable by the Geddy Lee by-way-of Axl Rose vocal delivery, Love stretching the falsetto beyond the measure of good taste. The remainder of the album is an experience in relatively unmemorable, guitar-driven tunes, alternately swinging from the back porch bachelor music of ""Sweet Return"" to the Vangelis-trapped-in-a-burning-synthesizer sound of ""Fire!"" before finally ending with the digitized music-box lullaby of ""Don't Let Me Down"". Off-Road isn't disagreeable or even bad, but it's absolutely forgettable. Though they may move on to greater things, for the moment Cardia represent little more than an admonition to future bands, a warning against premature presentation, two-dimensional flashiness, and songwriting bereft of blood and guts.","After nearly fifteen minutes, our group still could not decide on a reasonably cool name to bestow upon the limp ...

No Cities Left,The Dears,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d513d1975652139754/1:1/w_160/1ef92ae7.jpg,2003-07-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2224-no-cities-left/,Maple,"Holy crap: it's a time-traveling Britpop record from 1995! It took me a while to even work out whether this was any good or not because my giggling kept drowning out the music, but by the time ""Lost in the Plot"" came around, I'd fallen out of my armchair over such a sub-par Suede track (as sung by a Canadian who sounds disturbingly like Blur's Damon Albarn circa Parklife). If you catch the irony there-- that The Dears have made some awfully good incidental music for shots of Justine Frischmann sorting through ex-boyfriend photos-- you'll grasp my bafflement. If you don't, it turns out you've got a fighting chance at enjoying this. Because contrary to expectations, The Dears aren't bad at this stuff: in hooks, in atmosphere, and in songwriting, Murray Lightburn-- credited with writing, producing, and ""directing"" No Cities Left-- fares pretty well. I'm honor-bound to inform you that this record's entertained enough people to receive some rave reviews, and even best-of-year speculation, which is fair enough. As someone with a Gene ""Sleep Well Tonight"" promotional pillowcase somewhere in my closet, I'm not about to blame anyone for enjoying a decent-ish retro-Brit record. It's just that when bands run around with derivations quite as heavy as these, you expect them to sound sharp and knowing, effortless and graceful, packing some brio. The Dears, by and large, make tracks that would slide without much distinction onto any number of mid-90s albums, neither gumming up the works nor sounding particularly special. Like...if you don't remember Gene, they were the ones who wore neatly-pressed shirts and did sort of wan, effete reflections of the Smiths, like ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" with more dramatic arm-waving: jazzy guitar arpeggios, suave crooning about dirty motel rooms, occasional bouts of prancing. Only at their most innocuous do The Dears sound much like Gene, although the lyric sheets are indistinguishable-- more often, Lightburn's off on the semi-orchestral cabaret-pop trip that would appear to be his big agenda. You'd think that would be a new thing, but no luck: when he does it pretty, it sounds like a less moppety version of the swoony tracks from Blur's Parklife-- say, ""To the End"", or sometimes ""End of a Century""-- and when he makes it dark and ominous, it sounds a whole lot like the cabaret-noir detour Pulp took with This is Hardcore. That Suede-effect comes mostly when they rock, which they shouldn't, and, wisely, don't. If all of those Britpop references mean nothing to you, good: you won't have to distract yourself from your own giggling to appreciate things like the gorgeous saxophone turns on ""The Second Part"", the sneaky musette on the title track, or the subtly twisting melodies, often-keen orchestrations and melancholy pop jangle that are all over this record. You won't have funny little fits of recognition when Lightburn tries on the signature vocal tics of Morrissey and Albarn both within the space of a line, or notice that those ""subtly twisting melodies"" are basically just Parklife gone depressive, because you'll be too busy appreciating the fact that someone made the kind of big, varied, and likeably pretentious pop record no one really makes anymore. You won't have to notice that the lyric sheet and the Side One / Side Two conceit of the track listing seem a lot like the work of someone who spent some serious time with a cassette copy of Kill Uncle-- hi, Murray, me too!-- because you'll be noticing that side two is better. S'not good enough to make this record seem like anything more than an okay album released eight years after the fact, but whatever: you can save the same reaction for 2012 bands that sound like the Hives or the French Kicks. Admittedly, I've never liked the people who take such joy in telling you you're not allowed to like a perfectly pleasant record unless you've long-appreciated similar-sounding records someone else made a decade ago. If the Dears got as big Interpol, I'd actually be pleased to know so many kids were reliving both ends of my teenage years, not to mention creating a market for me to sell off some old records. I'd offer to help them come up with drinking games for the campy lyrics, like you could when Suede got ridiculous: for them it was a sip every time Brett said ""animal,"" ""poison,"" or ""fire""-- for Lightburn it'd be a sip every time he sings something Gene-ish like ""What we want most is nowhere to be found,"" ""I promise not to cry anymore,"" or ""All I want is to feel better."" You'll die of alcohol poisoning, not depression: in true post-Smiths fashion, he leavens all this with teenage-bedroom optimism like ""You're not alone,"" ""Don't you lose the faith,"" and ""I know we can last."" Gene, for the record, did not throw Bends-era Radiohead guitar squalls into the midsections of selected songs. So that's what you're up against: the peculiar sort of dramatic, flower-throwing, cheekily campy pop record British people were making between the day Morrissey went solo and the day Oasis hit U.S. radio, only without loads of references to London neighborhoods whose symbolism you can't parse-- suave crooning, rainy-day pop strumming, cabaret orchestration, melodic guitar solos, lyrics like ""Somewhere someone says they've got it all/ But that's not even what we want/ Not even close."" Made by Canadians. In the twenty-first century. Passably well. If that's the sort of thing you'd like to listen to, you're welcome in my apartment any time. But we will not talk about the Dears. We will listen to Pulp and watch old Smiths videos and throw flowers at one another. Like common people.","Holy crap: it's a time-traveling Britpop record from 1995!

Off-Road,David GrubbsMats Gustafsson,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfb0c0084474cd0c309c/1:1/w_160/de754c56.gif,2003-07-10 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3583-off-road/,Blue Chopsticks,"The day Grubbs and Gustafsson spent recording this album must have been like watching kids at a fancy imports-only toy store, playing with high-concept Legos and fragile Scandinavian toys, their heads bowed over the colorful pieces as they studiously assemble warships and dream homes. There's so much concentration on this record, because the musicians don't stop to smile: the six improvised pieces are impressively inventive, yet distractedly serious. This partnership started in the late nineties, when Chicagoan Grubbs met Gustafsson at a Gastr del Sol show. A high-power reedsman from Sweden's AALY Trio, Gustafsson runs with a pack of heavy European players who make regular trips to the Midwest's mecca; as opposed to his rigorously-trained partner, Grubbs is known for playing post-rock, avant-folk and other off-shoots of ""rock."" The two men recorded an album together in 1999, called Apertura; it was a spontaneous, enraptured hour-long session of slow droning music, and they went on to play gigs that proved haphazard dissections of both resumes. To quote their record label, the shows ""wandered from song to free-jazz freakout to tunnel of drone to digital collage to mouthless saxophone and brainless, bruising guitar."" You can characterize Off-Road simply as an effort to capture all the facets of the duo's performances, from drawn-out to curious to explosive, every instrument at their disposal thoroughly studied and reinvented. The album starts with its only pure virtuoso moment, Gustafsson putting his tenor through a post-Ayler duck-raping workout. He doesn't so much play as experiment with instruments, using contact mikes to get a stethescope-like view inside his horns. The best example of this closeness is ""Dystopian Turboprop"", with its elephantine breaths followed by sampled clicking and fluttering-- the clacking of the keys?-- assembled into a sound that, going with the title, resembles a flapping balsa airplane powered by a rubber band. Working on laptop in addition to guitar, Grubbs dominates the samples and processing. Even when they bring in turntablist Henry Moore Selder, he only adds moaning tonearm rumbles; his best work here may be the maracas he plays on ""Pumpkin Creek"", a simple, tuneful piece built around a folky guitar line. The noises, voices and found sounds that litter the rest of the album come to a head in ""Back Off"", a dryly humorous freak-out during which a meowing cat and an opera singer face off, as Grubbs and Gustafsson run it across downed power-lines, interjecting tinny drum machines and feedback samples. Still, most of the random sounds on Off-Road are balanced by structure, Grubbs often setting up moods or simple figures they can build on. Off-Road is short, and other improvisers would probably spend three times as long covering the same ground; this probably represents ""the best bits"" of their work on that one day in the studio, and even though each piece is improvised, they're well defined and separated. On the other hand, without the development that led up to these discoveries, we're missing some important context; the tone falls somewhere between the rigorous studies of a Keith Rowe and the bring-your-flak-jacket playfulness of a Han Bennick. Stuck in the middle, it lacks mood; even as you dig through its nuances, you may appreciate it more than enjoy it, but fans of either performer could find it rewarding. Off-Road isn't a defining statement, but it's a great index to the encyclopedic sound-world of Grubbs and Gustafsson.",,6.8,
Sting Sting Sting,Sick Lipstick,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a637c0084474cd0c08e7/1:1/w_160/fe8c229a.jpg,2003-07-10 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7705-sting-sting-sting/,Tiger Style,"For those of you in a hurry, some quick things of note about this record: the lead vocalist sounds a lot like Bis' Manda Rin (the words ""adenoidal"" and ""bratty"" spring to mind). Most of the discernable lyrics offer themselves up as a more risqué interpretation of Karen O's Sheena-is-a-bitch-in-heat shtick-- a High Society to play off the YYY's Playboy. Note the following instructions from ""Pretend I'm Sleeping"": ""I want your baby/ So you'll have to come inside me."" If you've ever heard Weasel Walter's guitar work on the Lake of Dracula album-- chunky, thick, dissonant, frantic-- you might think Sick Lipstick's guitarist owes a tithe or indulgence to Skin Graft for such sincere flattery. But the perpetual nerves that permeate this disc owe their frazzled state to the supposed Now Wave scene of the mid-90s (cf. the Scissor Girls, US Maple, Arab-on-Radar, that group of film-school drop outs opening for Blonde Redhead in 1995 wearing Q-Bert masks and tie-died hospital smocks while playing detuned E chords on guitars strung up with fishing line-- no, wait, that last group sucked ass, nevermind). As much as the supposed Now Wavers owe their MO and livelihood (relatively speaking) to No New York and Screamers bootlegs, Sick Lipstick brush against an equally well defined preexisting pedigree. This might be a good album for those of you in a hurry, though: no song on Sting Sting Sting wears out its welcome, with each of the twelve tracks working itself out in 3 minutes or less. But the best track just so happens to be the longest: ""Thigh-Master I'm Your Master"" manages to make a racket that, in epileptic circles, would qualify as ""danceable"", then builds on the racket to end the song with a convincing head of steam. The other tracks follow a similar path with little variation (though the intro to ""10-4 Can You Read Me?"" sounds more like something from Dirty than something from Here Is the Is-Not). This isn't a condemnation, though-- Sick Lipstick know what their strengths are, and they ably play to them. The lack of variation in their attack lends the proceedings a strange consistency; ""strange"" because I don't expect a band taking their cues from the sort of chaos described earlier to qualify as ""consistent."" Of course, one's fix for spastic, herky-jerky caterwauling punctuated by vocal catchphrasing might be ably sated by offerings from any of the Sick Lipstick's recent antecedents (Yummy Fur, God Is My Co-Pilot) and contemporaries (Erase Errata & related groups, The Ssion, even the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), or even the Canadian group that gave birth to this particular brand of makeup, the much more spastic and abrasive Black Cat #13, half of which comprises Sick Lipstick. If you're thirsting for this sort of aural abuse, Sting Sting Sting is a fine place to get your fix, but there's a lot of good shit in town right now; you better shop around.","For those of you in a hurry, some quick things of note about this record: the lead vocalist sounds a ...

Arcanum Moderne,Jim BlackEllery EskelinAndrea Parkins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca3abf31b7dc7155d84/1:1/w_160/22223be4.gif,2003-07-09 05:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2832-arcanum-moderne/,Hatology,"Saxophonist Ellery Eskelin isn't too sure about all this explanation. His trio, featuring keyboardist Andrea Parkins and drummer Jim Black, have released as steady stream of records for Swiss avant-garde imprint Hat Hut since 1996, and have just as steadily gained a lofty rep as one of the most interesting and creative jazz units. Taking cues from the classic Ornette Coleman quartet of the early 60s, up through the structured improv adventures of John Zorn in the 80s and on to any number of sounds and beats from today, his group has made the virtually miraculous discovery of playing new jazz that isn't 1) hopelessly traditional or 2) hopelessly experimental. In some ways, his music is always contradicting itself-- a tune here with a melody nicked from the schoolyard is almost uncomfortably straightforward; a piece there threatens to veer off into areas that have no context at all. Eskelin pens all his own liner notes, and his hesitancy to ""explain"" what is happening is probably warranted. Arcanum Moderne is the eighth release by this trio, and, like its predecessors, is an excellent example of how vibrant jazz can be in a world where rock, hip-hop and electronic music are the dominant forms of artistic music expression. Still, I can't help but wonder if Eskelin might have helped us out by providing some background. Unlike last year's incredible 12(+1) Imaginary Views or 1998's Kulak 29+30, Arcanum seemingly emphasizes the abstract-- or at least on Eskelin's more expressive tendencies. Especially on the final two tracks, ""Half A Chance"" and the title piece, I'd almost go so far as to say this was as close to free-jazz as the trio had come on record. Yet, Eskelin foils me in his notes when he talks about realizing most people weren't used to thinking of sounds in an improvised setting as being ""specific"" or ""intentional."" Knowing there are structures at work on his prior albums, I wonder if he's trying to tell me something about this record. At the very least, it's most rewarding when you have the opportunity to give it repeated listens, with time to really consider what's happening. That said, the record begins in typically lighthearted and eclectic fashion with ""It's A Samba"". What is it? It's a samba, and also typical of Eskelin, the melody is simple yet perfectly memorable. His long tones glide over accordion and Black's deft, busy groove, and the trio once again finds a way to make sounds in a jazz setting that aren't obviously jazz. In between verses of melody, Black takes short solos without ever really coming out of the beat, though on the last statement, Parkins and Eskelin begin their double chorus. Parkins subtly modulates completely out of the original key while the saxophone makes various low-key comments in and around the beat. Midway through, despite Black's persistent pulse, it's hard to believe this thing started so quaintly. The band veers almost completely off track just before the climax, when the trio joins Eskelin in a 4-note repeated pattern, nailing each note with increasingly intense force. Black attacks his kit for a joyously wild solo chorus, and then the trio are right back to the beginning. It might sound scattered, but in the context of the record, ""It's A Samba"" is easily the most traditionally structured. ""43 RPM"" starts with a bang, with a wail from Eskelin and high-speed rock beat from Black. Again, the melody is simple, almost minimal, but the solo breaks are the real blood of the piece. Black's pulse morphs into manic drum-n-bass and Eskelin plays like a man possessed by both Albert Ayler and Maceo Parker. And what do you call this music? Instrumentation notwithstanding, I'd be hard pressed to say jazz, as hardcore noise-rock freaks would have just as substantial a claim on it. Likewise, ""For No Good Reason"" begins with a jittery funk pulse, features extended solo forays by Eskelin without any hint of being connected to the rest of the tune, and then proceeds to ride out some strange form of torch song led by Parkins' piano figure owing more to ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" than any jazz standard. ""Half A Chance"" begins on breathy utterances from Eskelin's instrument, unaccompanied by his band mates. His figures are staunchly anti-melodic, winding through registers like water running down the side of a very tall building. He is joined by ambient sounds, possibly emanating from Black's cymbals, though likely the result of some synth magic. This queasy atmosphere is maintained until Black crashes in with a few jabs to his toms, and Parkins whips out her accordion again. Their interaction is almost violently intense, though just as ""For No Good Reason"" resolved into soft strokes, here they hit the rock-tinged processional. The title track seems to go about its way in the same way, beginning with very airy statements from Eskelin-- in fact, the tune ends very enigmatically with Eskelin ""playing"" nothing more than his own breath through the sax. Over the course of almost 15-minutes, the trio investigates multiple textures (assisted largely by the Parkins' array of keyboard sounds and Black's love of handheld percussion), though with no clear point of reference, it's sometimes tough to know where they're going. Arcanum Moderne is not an easy record to recommend to folks unaccustomed to stuff without many obvious formal signposts. There is a moment in the title track, near the end, when the band converges on a single chord and everything seems resolved-- but if you were waiting for fireworks for its first ten minutes, you might have been disappointed. Eskelin notes that his audience doesn't really seem to be your typical jazz crowd, and one can only hope they come out in droves for this. I'd probably hip beginners to 12+1 Imaginary Views first, but ultimately Arcanum's rewards may very well be just as sweet.",,8.0,
A Thousand Songs,Jim Guthrie,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfd6eb335119a49ed2b8/1:1/w_160/d5811e42.gif,2003-07-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3612-a-thousand-songs/,Three GutThree Gut,"A Thousand Songs' ""Introduction"" finds Jim Guthrie humbly warbling ""I think I'll write/ A thousand songs today"" over a handful of thick, grainy strums; six seconds in, Guthrie tumbles off the edge of his kitchen chair, dragging his entire patchy, four-track setup down with him in a dissonant crunch. Introduction complete. Unsurprisingly, Royal City's Jim Guthrie doesn't exactly fulfill his bombastic (if ill-fated) prophecy, but his solo Three Gut debut does boast twenty-four tracks of scrappy, lo-fi maneuvering, littered with all the bells, whistles, and pings expected of an artist who records his music in an apartment crammed with unnamed noisemakers. A Thousand Songs is seventy-four minutes of artfully pieced together song collages; to the uninitiated, the prospect of wading through it may sound roll-your-eyes exhausting, but, happily, the compilation makes a charming, melodically competent record, peppered with bizarre moments of cut and paste genius. Guthrie's sparse, handmade works are lucid enough to save themselves from tedium-- the time-tested pitfall of recording shit without a band, producer, or studio-- and he shows an impressive sense of balance and structure, toying with the tension of pairing raw, un-tempered sounds with proficient songwriting. Sometimes blissfully short (could anyone realistically endure more than twenty-five seconds of Guthrie and friends hollering ""Rama-lama-ding dong!"" and giggling, or placidly tolerate additional samples of someone cawing ""Pots and pans!"" over-- hey, brilliant match-up here-- the crashing of cookware?), Guthrie's samples are usually perfectly timed for listener appreciation, and coalesce like a poppier, less DJ-minded Fog. Remarkably, A Thousand Songs requires far less patience than might be (rightfully) anticipated from an artist who currently employs a Playstation as a band member/co- songwriter: Guthrie's compositions may be full of noises and unidentifiable hiss, but they're still solidly written songs. Snippets of found sound and cuts from old records (a quick clip from the Statler Brothers' ""Flowers on the Wall,"" a broke-down cover of Tortoise's ""Gamera"") mingle peaceably with guitar, drums, keyboards, Playstation-synths, and Guthrie's unadorned vocals. ""The Fantabulous"" opens with rich, acoustic plucks, Guthrie's modest guitar melody stumbling into a light drum and cymbal crash and then crawling out, rolling through twitchy beats and cycling back through again, building, breaking down, and evening out. ""Who Needs What"" is a sweet, strikingly sincere acoustic plea, with Guthrie quietly imploring ""Don't back down on me now/ I need this/ Go get drunk on me now/ You need this."" It's a welcome bit of quiet sentimentality before ""Who Needs What"" sees Guthrie toss his heart back down, return to form, and holler, ""Shit yeah, I can dance!"" Despite being originally released by Three Gut in 1999-- making Guthrie a semi-celebrity with resourceful Canadian critics in 2000-- and earning a re-release by the label in 2002, A Thousand Songs is terrifically hard to track down stateside, unless you frequent Three Gut's website (the label is hoping for U.S. distribution this fall). Guthrie's scrap-heap gig has already been brazenly co-opted by hundreds of crafty, resourceful kids with acoustic guitars and shitty microphones (who probably learned their tricks from a well-worn, heavily-stickered tape of Stereopathetic Soul Manure) and unfortunately, much of what's so unique about this release will, in all likelihood, seem pretty tired by the time it finds its way into the listening booth of your local indie retailer. But Guthrie's work is more honest and artful than much of the over-posed gimmickry-as-music of his peers, and even now, nearly four years after its initial release, A Thousand Songs deserves some attention.","A Thousand Songs' ""Introduction"" finds Jim Guthrie humbly warbling ""I think I'll write/ A thousand songs today"" over a ...

Politik Braucht Neinen Feind,Ekkehard Ehlers,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0beb335119a49ecb93/1:1/w_160/8339d6c9.gif,2003-07-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2690-politik-braucht-neinen-feind/,Staubgold,"I don't get easily offended. No matter how El Presidente (not the Domincan BUSCH, mind you) tried and tires to spin it, I refuse to allow my besieged heartstrings to be jerked into turgid stands for vengeance, self-righteousness, or freedom forking-over. While someone will undoubtedly see the cover of German Powerbook composer Ekkehard Ehlers' newest and get all Bill O'Reilly-ed up and go running to their gun rack to grab their Toby Keith double-barreled ""Foot in yer Ass/ Head up Mine"" Equalizer, I am trying to keep a cool head. But the new studio compositions of Ekkehard Ehlers really irk me. While America xenophobically crawls up its own ass, back-pedaling from treaties, wary of any and all intruders and work visas (back to Kraut-town with you, Damo Suzuki), a similar sense of conservativism and movement towards more traditionally classical sounds is at work in experimental music as well. The most glaring examples so far this year have been long-incubating new works by premiere electronics composers like Japan's Ryoji Ikeda and Germany's Ekkehard Ehlers that forego technology: the former decided that the sound of a rosined bow on strings was so amazing, he tried to make a whole record out of it, and now Ehlers is similarly infatuated, adding the sounds of spittled lips on a bass clarinet reed. A three piece composition for bass clarinet based on the floor plan of the Kunsthalle Schim Frankfurt, ""Mäander"" begins in an eerie, droning rasp, the breath of Burkhard Kunkel billowing through the wooden instrument like so many ghosts. Last year's astute observers will remember a portion of Ehlers' Plays dedicated to Albert Ayler by way of cut-up cellos, and it's a formula that Ehlers sticks with here. There's a wavering, wispy sustenance Ehlers grasps at, and sometimes keeps aloft, barely revealing the wires he employs to pull off such levitation. At times it reminds me of the similarly focused clarinet explorations that Jimmy Giuffre respired so resplendently on his solo flights of fancy in Free Fall. Eric Dolphy's angelic fluttering on ""God Bless the Child"" stirred up in my head as well, as it too moves from melody to \\ melody, humming through the appartus itself and back in a flicker. Where these were all about exploration and infinite possibilities in the exquisite, fleeting melodicism of hallowed sound, Ehlers stays stubbornly single-minded, focusing on mere textures and extended techniques, layering one breath upon the other until the supposed chamber sound of a woodwind ensemble is achieved. Even the collaborative duos of Evan Parker and Lawrence Casserley found a way to take a similar concept of instrument and instant manipulation-- and do it in real time. Even with infinite time to process, Ehlers' take can't compare, settling unevenly in places, neither the notes nor their arrangements ultimately cohesive. ""Blind"" is as troublesome and unimpressive. Also built from cello, the compositional technique employed on the first piece is unchanged, as the bowed strings sputter and squeak over one another, bumping into the other 'players' (one player is turned into a quintet) and glitching out. A similar inability to gain momentum or sustain an ambiance of any duration leads to its shaky structure and temporality. Yet all is saved, with twenty-one minutes of yet another artistic homage, ""Woolf Phrase"". Originally scored for William Forsythe and his dance company Ballett Frankfurt, ""Woolf Phrase"" revisits the ideas put forth in the Plays series, this time focusing on the ethereal grandeur from side one of John Cassavetes, looping a curl of strings and pulling it to a sad, sagging state of deliberate decay, allowing it to swirl at a slow, languid pace, making for a grave whirlpool of grandiose sounds as immersive and emotionally consumptive as the best of his works. Released in a limited edition on his own gallery label Whatness, it makes a greater impact here, vindicating the early meandering. All three pieces are dated from 2001, which makes me wonder what Ehlers might actually have been up to the last two years. He doesn't foresake his electronics, but he remains elementary in his investigations, leaving the deeper compositional problems unresolved. Hopefully it's just a slight pullback before new directions and syntheses of both the technological and classical; if anyone, Ekkehard Ehlers is capable of that.","I don't get easily offended.

Speicher CD 1,Michael Mayer,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43b69fc7814a47cd82b/1:1/w_160/ee86e948.gif,2003-07-09 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5550-speicher-cd-1/,Kompakt,"There was a day when loyalty to labels was more common sense than stubborn naivete. Most of the big indies-- Creation, Warp, 4AD, Sarah, Tommy Boy, Touch and Go, Drag City, Matador, Mute, and Rough Trade, among others-- had identifiable sounds, common sensibilities, and fairly consistent strike rate. Today I can count the number of labels I somewhat consistently embrace on just two fingers: Soul Jazz (a London-based, mostly reissue label) and Kompakt. Based in Cologne, Germany, Kompakt was founded by Wolfgang Voigt, and is co-run by Michael Mayer. It cultivates a style of microhouse characterized by a minimalist, textural, and spacious brand of German techno that embraces elements of dub and clicks-and-cuts in equal measure. In the past year or so, the label hasn't shied away from vocals or more overtly pop song structures...yet almost none of their hallmarks are on Speicher. The Speicher mix-- primarily drawn from the label's twelve-inch series of the same name-- is considerably more dancefloor-friendly and rooted in traditional house rhythms than anything the label has released previously. Bass-driven, direct and muscular, and completely grounded in 4/4 time, much of the mix belies German techno's recent embrace of electro. Although it's nowhere near as overtly shiny as Kompakt's recent Total 4 and virtually free of vocals, Speicher still sounds-- in some spots-- as much like the Hacker or Zombie Nation as it does the Perlon label. Mayer architects this 70-minute mix, but it's difficult to toss garlands at his feet: he's arranging tracks from a small pool of records. That's not a knock on his efforts as a DJ-- displayed on both the near-flawless Immer and a recent Peel Session-- but it should be a point of pride for his work, as a co-label head and ear for talent. Many of the tracks here are a couple of years old: the mix features a host of Kompakt's more recognizable, longstanding producers. Superpitcher and Reinhard Voigt each supply two tracks; Voigt also collaborates with both his brother Wolfgang (on the sultry album closer ""Vision 03"") and Mayer (on the melodic ""Unter Null""). Our DJ even tosses in one of his own tracks for good measure. Mayer selects worthy conspirators: T. Raumschmiere's ""Musick"" has a playful, mechanic skip which dances between typical Cologne robotics and the shuffletech sound, and Guentner-- who almost single-handedly rendered the Pop Ambient series unnecessary with his debut album In Moll-- offers the chime-infused ""Regensburg (Wasserman mix)"". Superpitcher shines brightest here, which is to be expected if you're familiar with Kompakt's output. The unofficial word on die Stra\xDFe is that he'll finally release a full album later this year, but until then, this mix drags a couple more of his tracks onto CD (ten of the 12 tracks first appeared on Kompakt's twelve-inch series, and are available on disc for the first time). Superpitcher's ""Irre"" kicks off the set, with a throbbing bass and crisp, lockstep rhythm not unlike the more restrained sections of Vitalic's Poney EP. Like much of the record's first half, ""Irre"" only layers a few basic sounds on top of one another, but uses them to combine an anthemic drone and the dirty bristle. On ""Fieber"", Superpitcher kicks off the record's more sun-kissed half-- also highlighted by the rolling rhythms of Reinhard Voigt's ""Supertiel""-- with a slice of elastic digital disco that comes closest to echoing the label's famed dub-house beat. Fittingly, Mayer himself provides the only vocals on the mix, a monotone delivery of Sade's ""Love Is Stronger Than Pride"". Almost unrecognizable when compared to the original, the song's frail sentiment and bottom-heavy throb was first aired on Miss Kittin's cover-mounted mix for the soon-to-be-defunct Musik magazine, an implicit declaration of the track's tangential relationship to electroclash. It's no wonder she embraced it: Mayer is practically doing a Kittin impersonation on vocals. With so many producers out of their typical elements, there's the worry that many tracks could sound like mimicry. That's not the case, but there's too much of a fish-out-of-water quality to this disc for it to be considered either a topnotch Kompakt release, or a guaranteed floor filler. Trapped between embracing the dancefloor and showing loyalty to the label's typically more sophisticated, layered sounds, Speicher isn't the best introduction to the label-- Total 3 and Immer co-own that claim-- but it's a fascinating addition to the still-bulletproof Kompakt roster.","There was a day when loyalty to labels was more common sense than stubborn naivete.

Waiting for the Moon,Tindersticks,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7baea9e61561daa565a/1:1/w_160/41b36579.jpg,2003-07-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8071-waiting-for-the-moon/,Beggars Banquet,"""My hands 'round your throat/ If I kill you now, well, they'll never know."" Dickon Hinchliffe may be talking to a character he created, but he may as well be addressing you directly: that's the effect Tindersticks have. Even their gentlest moments can grab and startle you, and their fiercest always overwhelm. These six sad Englishmen have always been beyond classification; you've never heard anything like them, and the things you could compare them with-- Scott Walker, Serge Gainsbourg, spy film scores, Leonard Cohen, an apocalyptic bar band-- don't make for an easy description. Their last two albums settled back a bit from their sharply confrontational, uniquely miserable trio of early works, albums whose sheer brilliance and distinctiveness the band are unlikely ever to match again. A readily identifiable R&B influence unexpectedly came to the fore in recent years, and though it suited them nicely, I was admittedly a bit worried about Waiting for the Moon, which could have very easily seen them losing the plot and slipping into formula. Instead, it resynthesizes everything they've done before, and emerges as a cohesive work mirroring the straightforward format of Simple Pleasure and Can Our Love..., all the while pushing the music in bolder directions than either of those albums. The fact that Dickon Hinchliffe (the band's violinist and orchestrator) sings the first song comes as a bit of a surprise, though not an unpleasant one. He sounds kind of like Witness' Gerard Starkie, and his tenor is a good foil to the more familiar, foggy baritone croon of Stuart Staples. Opener ""Until the Morning Comes"" is a subtle lullaby, riding David Boulter's tinkling keyboards and a sweeping string arrangement and never rising much above a whisper despite the violence that crops up in the lyrics. Staples takes the lead back on ""Say Goodbye to the City"", which is a tense, brooding grind of violin, syncopated drums, droning bass and minimalist guitar that explodes into gales of dissonant strings and frantic trumpet-- it's their most harrowing song since 1997, and it feels great to hear them back in this territory. Staples turns to a deadpan spoken narrative on ""4.48 Psychosis"", as the band builds a steadily boiling drone around him, letting drummer Alasdair MacCauley splatter jazz over his rock beat while Hinchliffe's violin coats everything. Tindersticks are still pretty heavily set in their soul phase elsewhere, as on ""Trying to Find a Home"" and Hinchliffe's gorgeous ""Sweet Memory""; the way the songs sit on the album, you can just feel the group constructing them, letting the pieces fall together naturally. The title track is a pensive music box of strings that gives Staples a perfect bed to shine on-- his vocals are probably one thing most likely to drive someone away from Tindersticks, but once you've acquired a taste for it, his deeply soulful gutter croon becomes a salve for all the worst emotions. Waiting for the Moon is just what I needed from Tindersticks: an album that doesn't abandon their recent direction, but breathes new life into it by drawing breath from their noisier past. They may operate below the radar of hype and trends-- especially in recent years-- but for whatever public ignorace, Tindersticks are one of the best bands going today. I'm more than happy to have their hands 'round my throat. ","""My hands 'round your throat/ If I kill you now, well, they'll never know."" Dickon Hinchliffe may be talking ...

Holding Patterns EP,+/-,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b49d034d5c69bf27b0/1:1/w_160/40c5030b.jpg,2003-07-08 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6355-holding-patterns-ep/,Teenbeat,"With the success of albums like the Notwist's Neon Golden, lap-pop has fast become one of the most conceptually appealing micro-genres available to today's jetsetting youth. And though its combination of breezy melodies and subtle electronic textures often yields gorgeous results, it has doubtless left a few people asking, ""Where's my fucking lap-rock?"" On their second release, +/- may be on their way to providing a resounding answer to that very question. Though it relies largely on the laid-back charm of its predecessor (the excellent Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album), Holding Patterns frequently finds the band taking their sound in new, more forceful, kinetic directions. As a result, Holding Patterns is a less consistently enticing listen than its full-length predecessor, but it's still a lovely EP in its own right and, hopefully, a glimpse at what could turn out to be one of the most interesting permutations of the pop-electronic-rock continuum to emerge so far. ""I've Been Lost"" opens with a burst of barely-contained energy before a foundation of crystal-clear acoustic guitar and fuzzy electronic drums gives way to blasts of overdriven electric guitar and hyperactive drumming. Percussion is a big part of +/-'s sound, and the contrast between natural and synthetic drumming is played up in ""I've Been Lost"" as well as it has been in any song since the Dismemberment Plan's ""You Are Invited"". James Baluyut's markedly unspectacular vocals work strikingly well here, as the simple, charming melodies he intones hold together the tremendous dynamics that make it so interesting. ""Trapped Under Ice Floes"" is a more straightforward rock song that recalls the dark, glistening tones of the Moles. Working almost entirely from the interplay between layered clean electric guitars, bass, and Baluyut's voice, it occasionally brings to mind the intense emotional deliberateness of Interpol, minus the perfectly manifest combination of dread and optimism. Indeed, the most frustrating thing about Holding Patterns is that it often hints at what it never fully delivers. Baluyut's songs are generally pretty straightforward in structure, and have a tendency to return to a familiar chorus right when something incredible seems to be in the works. ""Trapped Under Ice Floes"" is certainly a fantastic song, but it ends awfully close to where it begins, failing to fully capitalize on the momentum of an gorgeously tense, subtle midsection. The remaining three tracks on Holding Pattern offer rock takes on the lovely, electronic-inflected pop songs that made Self-titled Long-playing Debut Album so great. While that album was largely Baluyut's own work, Holding Patterns sounds much more like the work of a band in the traditional sense: gone are many of the tricked-out lo-fi production quirks of Self-titled, their absence compensated for by more assured songwriting. ""You've Just Got It All"" is the most successful of these tracks, pairing lovely organ and bell sounds with a drumbeat so effective it can only be described as ""catchy."" As always, Baluyut isn't afraid to incorporate massive changes in instrumentation and general tone into a song, and the subdued, electronics-heavy section in the middle of ""You've Just Got It All"" is quite possibly the most beautiful thing on this EP. Holding Patterns is a beautiful record, it simply finds beauty in different places than its predecessor. While Self-titled... worked around gorgeous, drawn-out sonic vistas, Holding Patterns shows Baluyut and company are just as adept at finding beauty in motion and interaction. Though the focus is largely on texture and melody, this is far from lap-pop-- it's fully realized rock with enough sonic variety to keep things fresh and interesting.","With the success of albums like the Notwist's Neon Golden, lap-pop has fast become one of the most conceptually ...

Kind Kind,Sack und Blumm,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32e13d1975652138a23/1:1/w_160/411bf62b.gif,2003-07-08 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6960-kind-kind/,Staubgold,"I really can't stand these Windows Media Players that pop every time I slide a disc into my work computer. This shitty Microsoft accessory tries to sync up every CD shoved up in it with some early 90s rave FX. Right, the perfect visual to go with Slayer's Reign in Blood is slowly undulating blue waves, just as the ""bars and waves"" setting does so much to enhance listening to Solomon Burke. In a curious accident that is the exception, I have this minimal green-line circle that bristles and wiggles its circumference along to the fourth album of the ongoing postal collaborations between Germany's Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler and Frank Schültge Blumm, and it looks about right, even echoing the little line-drawn red flowers that are sprinkled around the cover. Simple and quite aware of its shape, the duo are about cute and barely digitized movements, the natural rhythms that arise out of their acoustic materials being the foundation for each and every song. Things haven't changed too much from their first release, Shy Noon (on the Gefriem label). And it definitely continues the naïf explorations carried out by FS Blumm on his solo release from earlier this year. A varying palette of folk instrument curios, ranging from kalimba, tabla, toy piano, mbira, melodica, knitting needles, sheet metal, etc. are stroked for simple melodies or fragmented rhythms and then stitched back together digitally into little vignettes. ""Cassius Carrera"" surprisingly recalls fellow countryman and acoustic instrument alchemist Hans Reichel. The weird near-vocalized gurgles here, as well as on ""Baby Bass Box"", recall Reichel's most bizarre creation, the daxophone, a bowed or tapped sliver of resonant wood that produces ""talking"" qualities that scarcely resemble processed vocals, yet retain that nearly human aspect. ""Maria Mbira"" is constructed from the thumb plucks of that instrument, mixed with just a dash of early Residents horn burp for a mildly discombobulating three minutes of childlike pop. That wobbly walking melody on ""Shop Beats"" dreamily recalls the innocent structures graced Nobukazu Takemura's Child's View recordings, but with an instrumental array that twinkles like his clear and clement ""perfume"" recordings for Issey Miyake. Sack und Blumm even bring out some of that thin rubberband funk that Mouse on Mars have played with for ""Bass Car"", before winding down with some tin frog throats croaking over a bit of dream organ for naptime. With near wordage, ""To Go To"" is a lullaby with the awkward grace that only a father can hum through his nose when it's beddy-bye time. Toy motors rev, little red cars grasped at with new hands, and the overall purr of playing attains a tender level that bodes well for baby sleep snuggled in soft blankies, with mildly critical thoughts about primitive dreamtime drifting past in such a way as to seem like child's play to these pops.","I really can't stand these Windows Media Players that pop every time I slide a disc into my work ...

Promise of Love,American Analog Set,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07913d19756521383c2/1:1/w_160/2d1db935.jpg,2003-07-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/156-promise-of-love/,Tiger Style,"Dear Chuck: saying toodles to one's first long-term boyfriend is difficult, but this letter marks the end of your tight psychological grip on me. Your worst egregious abuse of my sheltered palate was to make me sign that Purchase Obscure Really New Music Only Manifesto (or, PORNMOM). The declaration had its good points: I didn't mind offloading Tortoise's oeuvre, and I admit that I bought Dean Wareham products out of a strange, sentimental notion of an alternate Boston renaissance. But demanding that we limit ourselves to debuts or upstarts was getting ridiculous. Sure, Guitar Romantic is fun, but what exactly about The Exploding Hearts is new? I remain angriest, though, that you pressured me to dump my American Analog Set archives. How I bristled, pathetically silent, when you called them ""late-90s drone-turds,"" and said that their album titles connoted either children's books or romance novels, building (of course) to your gauche ""riff"" on ""American Anal Log Sex."" How painfully I recollect your cackle when I asked if I could at least keep their branch-out material, Know by Heart and the remix EP Updates, never expecting you to be such a cropduster about it. Whose sticker-clogged clipboard recorded the cool points you scored for noting how one of the remixes sounded like a track from Gary Wilson's You Think You Really Know Me? That you will miss out on the lilting keeper Promise of Love inspires only pity. I grant you, through the album's first half, your theory-- that AAS doesn't release albums so much as sequels-- applies. Just as ""Punk as Fuck"" kicked off Know by Heart with an elliptical, almost instrumental, ironic nod to genre straightjacketism, ""Continuous Hit Music"" offers a self-circumnavigating wedge of cuddle-core that appropriates and transcends its titular cliché. (Face it, Chuck, wherever you are, mid-scramble for Datsuns tickets: in the era of Colin Powell's huddled-masses-hating scion running the Federal Communication Commission, the phrase ""continuous hit music"" is terrifying to approach. This band rebaptizes top-down ""programming"" logic beautifully, especially in an acoustic hidden-track reprise.) I'm not complaining, but ""Hard to Find"" and ""Come Home Baby Julie, Come Home"" also play like Know by Heart revamps, their coy keyboards and clean drums seasoning the warm, warm guitar swirl. ""You Own Me"" is a daggum culmination of the previous album's make-out succor. This Chet-Baker-does-indie-pop jam could prod the urban-legendary beakless chickens of KFC to liplock, but it also made me think of your tyranny, Chuck, since it asserts during its breakdown, ""You own me/ Control me."" Then: look out world, because AAS drops into a mid-tempo trilogy! Begone, all who'd demean this troupe as Low & The Family Stone, or as traffickers in Yo La tingle. No shisre, Chuck-- the title track, ""The Hatist"", and ""Fool Around"" rank among the year's finest tight-rock salvos from a band nailing itself giddily to the cross of its choice, comfortable with its singular personality/idiom; even your precious find, Broken Social Scene, suggests a shape-shifting, promethean collision between The Sea & Cake and The Multiple Cat. These tracks float, but scoot, like a jetski with a mute setting. So go lick a legacy-scab, Chuck. This band of membrane-rangers makes my cuticles throb. The whispered vox mirror the guitars' inhaling and exhaling, and the slow-drift song structures are downright platetectonic. Yes, the last song's a meandering letdown, and yes, the tone is mannered, like that film you forgot, The Deep End-- both works are almost ostentatiously understated. You might call Promise of Love soft and unnecessary, the musical equivalent of foreskin, but as our country inches closer to becoming one big cop bar, these forty not-so-new minutes offer overdue comfort.

Run to Ruin,Nina Nastasia,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a369fc7814a47cd6c0/1:1/w_160/fde0e27b.jpg,2003-07-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5712-run-to-ruin/,Touch and Go,"When Nina Nastasia's latest record groans into view, it sets you up to expect the gloomiest entry in an already dark catalog: the mourning strings and her opening line00 ""We never talk about the things we witnessed""-- suggest an album detailing the rural nightmare so many (urban) art-folk songwriters dwell in, where the men are monsters, the women are widows and the graveyards are above average. But just when the album's ready to fall prey to clichés, it turns into something far more intimate and complex-- moodier, yet more subtle than her previous outings. On last year's excellent The Blackened Air, Nastasia-- an acclaimed New York singer/songwriter in a world that thought it had too many-- wrote songs that were cool and dusty. Her lyrics confined her as a spectator, or at best, the victim of longings; the action kept happening to other people-- her dad chased a man down the highway, her dog was the one dying violently, and it was always someone else buried in that graveyard. But on Run to Ruin, the distance dissolves: Nastasia inhabits these songs and slowly surrenders to the material, as the graceful arrangements of her last album become messy and passionate. As before, Nastasia matches her acoustic guitar with a striking chamber string section and odd folk instruments like dulcimer, accordion, and no more than twenty notes twinkled on a piano. The strings grind and weave through ""We Never Talked"" and angrily swell across ""I Say That I Will Do"", while Jim White of Dirty Three-- a perfect drummer for this group-- intuitively balances timekeeping with colors that sputter like rain on soil. The emotions flare and subside, and so do the styles that Nastasia switches between: this is far more exotic than the straighter folk and country stylings of her earlier work, and she's writing longer songs with more room to breathe and swell. The meaty, gypsy melody of ""On Teasing"", the accordion weaving around the swarthy strings, is as unexpected as the tiny singing and almost too-precious arpeggios on ""The Body"". But the most striking improvement is her singing. She's a stronger vocalist, her almost-plain tone rising into higher registers, and her usual range has grown more earthily gorgeous. But more than anything, she demonstrates a new expressiveness: her singing at an even keel, but around the edges you can hear her start to let go. Like an anti-diva, Nastasia inches through her feelings instead of flaunting them. She can sound cutting and ironic, like the dry hatred in ""You Her And Me"", a song whose flat lyrics come to life in a delivery that resembles the smartest loner from high school. And she's gripping at her most vulnerable: the album's strongest track, ""Superstar"", at first sounds like a reasonable Cowboy Junkies-like ballad, until she draws us in with how lost and helpless she sounds. She sings the key line ""I'm a superstar"" in a voice that's almost delirious with fatigue, repeating it again and again in weakly ecstatic surrender. As with her two other records, Nastasia recorded Run to Ruin with Steve Albini. Once again he claims he ""documented"" the record instead of producing it, and although it's expectedly close-miked and sonically flawless, Albini gets credit for capturing what happened, then backing off. It would be too easy, say, to shine up the handful of perfectly sentimental piano notes on ""The Body"", but Albini lets them speak for themselves. He leaves Nastasia's beautifully arranged ensemble to make its own mood: the dynamic extremes aren't smoothed over, and nobody polishes the mood or smudges this into a genre. More importantly, nobody tries to be Nastasia's drama coach-- nobody dictated how she should open up on these songs. While her voice was just a part of the tapestry on her last albums, she has finally become the emotional core, and half the attraction of this record is hearing her stretch out and make these discoveries while we listen.","When Nina Nastasia's latest record groans into view, it sets you up to expect the gloomiest entry in an ...

The Violet Hour,The Clientele,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f7ea9e61561daa526e/1:1/w_160/8ff28f4c.jpg,2003-07-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1504-the-violet-hour/,Merge,"Half-formed thoughts, departed lovers, music on the gramophone, the sun's last rays. These images from the ""The Fire Sermon"" section of T.S. Eliot's examination of spiritual isolation, The Waste Land, could easily have been lifted from the expressive lyrics of The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean. It's no wonder the English band have taken the title of their long-awaited debut album from Eliot's masterpiece. In Eliot's tome, the violet hour is ""When the eyes and back turn upward from the desk/ When the human engine waits/ Like a taxi throbbing waiting."" It's a time of transition from the shackles of the day to the potential vibrancy of the early evening, when-- after the drain of work, desperate for rewarding social connections-- we are able to seek emotional nourishment. Much of The Violet Hour is concerned with this quest, and seems haunted by the spirits of lost opportunities to experience rich, honest humanity. The album is also haunted by the sound of the band's string of evocative singles and EPs-- most of which were previously collected on Suburban Light and the U.S.-only A Fading Summer-- and many of the band's familiar traits thankfully return here: Alasdair MacLean's languid, almost resigned whisper, his eloquent lyrics, a slightly out-of-tune guitar, and all of that reverb. But The Clientele add some new instrumentation as well-- steel and Spanish guitar, field recordings, violin, chimes-- to create a lush tapestry of hazy pop, like Felt at their most impressionistic. The band is given the opportunity to explore the scope and expanse of the album format for the first time here, and it embraces it, erecting vivid song cycles and mood pieces. Just as surrealist Joseph Cornell (a Clientele favorite) frequently updated his boxes of found objects by adding items, so does the band, adding layers to the ephemeral template established by its earlier work. Out of character for the Clientele, ""Lamplight"" and ""The House Alw [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/<script type=]|||||| js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""> ays Wins"" even stretch to upwards of six-and-a-half and eight minutes respectively, drifting beyond the band's typical hazy psych-folk and unfolding tighter arrangements and heavier guitar work than ever before. Also like Cornell, The Clientele dabble in a sort of light surrealism, the arrangement and cherishing of mismatched images and scattered snapshots. Their songs are sentimental collections of memories and moments, some treasured and some lamented, frequently filtered through odd shades of light and the often-unreliable hazes of memory and nostalgia. MacLean's delicate, sometimes poignant, sometimes mordant words of loss and love unfold like a soft-focus slideshow over the band's swirling, reverb-drenched tones. A sense of time has always been indicative in much of The Clientele's work, and it continues here. Check the titles of songs past and present: ""An Hour Before the Light"", ""As Night Is Falling"", ""Lamplight"", and, of course, each of their long-playing titles: Suburban Light and now The Violet Hour. Stepping into the unreal light of The Clientele's violet hour is like looking at faded photos or grainy film stock, emerging into the daylight following a matinee, trying to peer through the London fog, or walking into dusk after a day inside artificial light. It almost sounds the way different shades of light alter otherwise familiar objects, or the way the experiences of the past, which always seem extraordinary in hindsight, loom over the present, at which they almost always seem trite. As a result, there's a lot of longing here: ""Missing"", ""Everybody's Gone"", ""When You and I Were Young"". Just as Eliot's The Waste Land is credited with helping to define modernism, The Clientele are marking slight shifts in time, mood and atmosphere. In combination with their faraway, almost Francophile sound, it's a poignant noise. They're capturing moments of transition, loss, or ones that magnify the banality of the everyday: ""So that summer came and went as I became cold."" ""I picked her up at half past four and felt the evening come in her tired eyes."" ""The first time I saw you, I couldn't say a thing."" ""I took one step back, and I returned to evening."" ""The southbound train through Battersea in glowing rain I ride."" ""I see your face each time I close my eyes."" So does this record demonstrate growth? Maybe not. The Clientele aren't necessarily expanding their sound, just perfecting it. Like Cornell, they're collating their collective past, arranging experiences into tight little boxes to cherish their memories and make sense of them. They're drifting through the London streets collecting ephemera, flutters of the heart, and snapshots of dying days. Like the modernists, they aren't building a linear timeline but seeking to grapple with more universal conditions. Is that hopelessly retrofit? Some might say so. Me? I'm not sure that combating spiritual isolation or seeking emotional nourishment will ever go out of style.","Half-formed thoughts, departed lovers, music on the gramophone, the sun's last rays.

A Is For Accident,The Dresden Dolls,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba17c0084474cd0c2773/1:1/w_160/3045af2d.gif,2003-07-07 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2451-a-is-for-accident/,Important,"""Cabaret-punk"" is one of the most misapplied coinages floating around. You've seen dozens of musicians tagged with it, from Gavin Friday to Gogol Bordello-- all more or less in error. If the term meant delivering three-chord anthems in pancake makeup, or simply amping the theatricality, then the best current cabaret-punk act would be KISS. Boston's Dresden Dolls supply the genre's true definition: they take Weimar chords and Tin Pan Alley wordplay (the latter thematically and linguistically updated to include skateboarders and sodomy), and present them with the wide-eyed, fuck-all urgency of vintage CBGB's. Head Doll Amanda Palmer's voice can slide from shipwreck bullhorn to girly twitter and back within the same line. To gauge the confused awe she inspires in the listener, you have to think back to the first time you've heard air through the vocal cords of Polly Jean Harvey. Palmer's huge sound appears to come almost infuriatingly easy: a natural on stage, she carelessly whispers, sniffles, scat-sings, murmurs asides, and frequently cracks up at her own lyrics, all the while playing respectable piano. Mime-faced drummer Brian Viglione supplies tactful brushwork for her verses, and sets mighty tom rolls for grand finales. This is the first time I'm writing a review knowing that the act will be huge. I'm not exactly famous for clairvoyance (having shrugged off Interpol in 1999 with five lines in the Village Voice), so by no means take my word for it. But the signs are all there-- the hypnotically effective live show, the celebrity fans (among them Beck and Perry Farrell), and the long line for crappy homemade demos after each gig. For now, the fame is mostly confined to Massachusetts, where the Dresden Dolls won a battle of the bands and scored admirers at the Boston Phoenix. They have also developed an odd entourage of teenage goths who do ballroom-dancing routines at their concerts (and appear to follow the band around the Northeast). A Is For Accident is not the Dolls' proper debut: it's a shrewd feature-length trailer for it, a collection of live recordings from the last two years, a handicap to give you a general idea of what you've missed so far. This transitional status-- most songs, I'm guessing, are soon to reappear in studio versions-- is the only factor that keeps it from a higher rating here. The songs were recorded all over the Northeast, and the quality varies accordingly-- from clean soundboard mixes to what sounds like the work of a drunken groupie careening through the crowd with a MiniDisc recorder. The immediate standout is ""Mrs. O"", an anthem of denial in 3/4 that recalls ""Hey Jupiter"" (one of Tori Amos's strongest songs) in its main melody but outdoes Amos on absolutely every other level. The oblique horror of the verses (""April trains may bring strange showers"") gives way to the tragic swell of the chorus (""The truth can't save you now/ The sky is falling down""). It is haunting, campy and, beyond all else, smart. ""Christopher Lydon"" is by all appearances a gag, and a clumsy one at that-- a lovelorn paean to the crusty NPR broadcaster who once ran for mayor of Boston. Miraculously, it manages to break your heart. ""Will"" is a sole studio cut-- an outtake from the upcoming album, recorded in New York with great producer Martin Bisi, who, having worked with the likes of Sonic Youth and Swans, knows better than to obscure Palmer's voice or to dilute the simplicity of the setup: the big-studio version of the Dolls' sound involves a bare minimum of trickery. Bisi adds wisps of harmony vocal, an ambient bed and a couple of vintage effect touches to Palmer's slowest and prettiest song. ""Will"" is clearly not a castoff but a strategic early unveiling: the pre-single single off a tentative album, by a band whose greatness is currently in previews.","""Cabaret-punk"" is one of the most misapplied coinages floating around.

Take Me to Your Leader,King Geedorah,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba9c0084474cd0c28eb/1:1/w_160/9df0f225.jpg,2003-07-07 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4443-take-me-to-your-leader/,Big Dada,"Alright, this is how it is. You don't know it yet, but this is your favorite album of the summer. Shit, of this whole foul, corporate-owned, Republican-approved year of our lord, two thousand and three. What MF Doom can do is on par with anyone you can name off the top of your clever, underground noggin', and he most likely does it better. Never mind that his re-entry into the game, Operation: Doomsday, was a masterstroke of genre-shaming samples and virgin-tight beats that stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Kool Keith's otherworldly approach to hip-hop (while keeping in touch with the asphalt, and digging a little deeper, one finger on the trigger and the other checking the TV Guide for B-movies on cable). Heads will be discovering that album for the next ten years, and it'll still sound fresh. So: What to do when you've dropped a classic and carved your name in granite after returning to the scene? First step is to smoke trees, and catch up on your monster movies. Using the same lo-fi, direct-from-the-VCR dubbing he used to narrate the rise and fall of the iron-faced ruler of Latveria on Doomsday, MF lies out the mythos of King Geedorah over the course of Take Me to Your Leader, drafting an outline of the rubbery behemoth's exploits (it doesn't quite qualify as a concept album), then uses it as a guide to piece together some of the most jaw-droppingly, neck-twistingly, brain-meltingly inspired cuts this side of Q-Bert's Wave Twisters. ""Monster Zero"" is the epicenter of that approach, a cut-n-paste narration of Geedorah's arrival on planet Earth via visitors from the future, backed by a languid soul loop and distorted, bizarrely syncopated snares; the monster in question-- a mutated, irradiated, three-headed fucker who once terrorized the inhabitants of Planet X-- is namechecked and invoked throughout Take Me to Your Leader, and a few of the guest emcees hide behind the monikers of other Godzilla friends and foes to cement the theme. The King Geedorah project, unlike Doom's recent outing as Viktor Vaughn, finds MF almost exclusively behind the boards, comfortable with rocking the SP1200 and letting others turn out the mic. Only two tracks feature Doom rhyming, but at least one of them is an album highlight: Along with Mr. Fantastik's GZA-by-way-of Humpty Hump delivery and a sleazy, greasy blues guitar, Doom pushes ""Anti-Matter"" straight to the top of the heap. Even without Doom's verbal skills, the roster here lives up to Metal Fingers standards, with nary a wack emcee in sight (compare that to a record like Peanut Butter Wolf's My Vinyl Weighs a Ton, which featured a few lightweights in the pack). Kurious (billed here as Biolante) sets the bar high on ""Fastlane"" with an unflappable and confident delivery that fits in amazingly well with the squealing guitar riff that forms the track's hook. In a rare moment of introspection, Hassan Chop does some ruminating on past mistakes and lost friends in ""I Wonder"", and it's to his credit that the song is affecting without tripping headlong into melodramatic cliché. ""Next Level"" throws another curveball, eschewing Doom's taste in bizarre source material with a sultry, piano-laced jazz groove that hearkens back to early 90s fixtures A Tribe Called Quest and The Pharcyde, complimented by lyrics from Lil Sci (""I got a gift called/ Hip-hop prophecy/ 2003/ The year of the jiggy emcee""), Stahhr and ID 4 Winds that bring a smooth Black Star flavor to the proceedings. Gigan takes the prize for delivery, though. ""Krazy World"" finds him delivering couplets at a cross-country runner's pace like Jack Kerouac with a dutchie in his back pocket: ""Check it, playin' em/ Bungle them chumps till I abolish 'em/ Been doin' it since double-oh-one with five dollars/ We be sparklin' in a Siegfried shirt/ With wide collars."" Just as Prince Paul pulled quite a crew together for A Prince Among Thieves, MF has enlisted some strong soldiers here, heads that don't find his expansive vinyl universe intimidating. Kutmasta Kurt and Madlib aside, I haven't heard anyone lace a track like Doom. Take one listen to the Quincy Jones soul loops on ""Krazy World"" or the indelible Motown strings backing Hassan Chop on ""I Wonder"" and I think you'll agree. The sharp spacescape of ""Lockjaw"" is straight out of Fantastic Planet, right down to the hokey 70s science fiction flourishes and theremin frequencies. And most of the album cuts do double duty, breaking ground in the disjointed rhythm department (""No Snakes Alive""), while bridging the gap between the sci-fi themes of King Geedorah and Doom's established jazz tastes (""Fazers"", ""Next Level""). The beatboxing on ""The Fine Print""? Don't get me started. And when an emcee just won't do, Doom enlists the aid of his crates and the wheels of steel to get his message across. Besides ""Monster Zero""-- which is more a silly-as-shit audio collage anyway-- Doom applies his cut/paste technique to ""One Smart Nigger"", exploring racism and linguistic symbolism by letting his wax do the talking. The effect should have emcees checking their notebooks before they attempt another ""socially conscious"" verse. Take Me to Your Leader will excite you in a way most hip-hop projects just aren't able: It's not straining for credibility nor putting effort into being revelatory; it just is. Everyone involved got their kicks making this record, and the enthusiasm drips off the jewel case. Like Bobbitto Garcia says: ""Create and share with the world."" In the album's press release over at Big Dada, MF says: ""You should listen to the album for what it is and not expect it to be like the average 'rap' stuff you're probably used to... a blend of ill lyrics and instrumentals. To me, it's way iller than any of the wack shit out now."" And not like you'd expect a chef to say his dishes taste like shit, but this time the horse's mouth speaks the absolute truth.","Alright, this is how it is.

When I'm Falling,Terminal 4,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75713d19756521393bb/1:1/w_160/0a8db64f.jpg,2003-07-07 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7974-when-im-falling/,Truckstop,"Simple pleasures can be the greatest pleasures. My cat knows simple pleasure-- some days it's a cold wood floor to lie on, other times it's lying like a baggy, inert carpet scrap in the middle of the landing while people are trying to traverse the stairs. She doesn't really know what it's like to prepare for recreation like we do-- packing stuff in a bag before heading to the beach, or buying tickets to a baseball game and driving forty miles to see it-- and I'm sure she has a lot less stress because of it. Of course, Abby is a cat, and they're somewhat easier to please than we are, but I think the analogy translates quite well to all aspects of human life, including music. For instance, I can glean a lot of pleasure from something like a Bartok string quartet or a bombastically orchestrated Divine Comedy song, but there are times when all the meticulous planning that goes into music like that just isn't doing it for me, and that's when a disc like this Terminal 4 album comes in. When I'm Falling is the second release from avant-garde cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm's Terminal 4 project, easily his most easily accessible outlet. Anyone who knows Chicago music knows Lonberg-Holm's name from the litany of projects he involved himself in the last decade, from Michael Krassner's Boxhead Ensemble, Ken Vandermark's bands, the Peter Brotzman Tentet, Lightbox Orchestra, Lofty Pillars, and just about anything that ever came out on Truckstop, but go back even further, and you'll find him in New York, studying composition with Anthony Braxton and Morton Feldman and drawing fire from his fingerboard in John Zorn's band. Suffice it to say his Out music pedigree is about as good as they come, but everybody needs to retreat from that kind of thing now and then, and Terminal 4 is Lonberg-Holm's escape hatch. A four piece band features Lonberg-Holm's cello and occasionally piano, Jeb Bishop's wandering trombone, Jason Roebke's demure bass and the spatial guitar of Ben Vida (Town and Country). The density of Brotzman's tentet is just about the North Pole to Terminal 4's south, as When I'm Falling rarely rises above a simple murmur of two or three instruments. Bishop's trombone usually leads the way, playing melodies that sound almost stream-of consciousness while the other three musicians whirl slowly behind, coalescing into drones and even hitting the occasional rhythmic stride, such as on ""This Must Be the End"", where Lonberg-Holm's cello kicks up a creaky rhythm before breaking into a searching, plaintive solo. There are moments when Lonberg-Holm is playing at the top of his instrument's range and Vida strums in swaying rhythms that it sounds almost like Reinhardt and Grapelli conducting a lazy midnight jam in a living room. Dissonance creeps to the fore in short, controlled crescendos, but always gives way quickly to hazy, but consonant melody. Naturally, the constant instrumentation and mood make for a somewhat monotone recording, and it definitely serves better for atmosphere than close listening, but When I'm Falling proves that, while sometimes it's nice to bust out the orchestra and interlocking sixteenth-note patterns, there are also times when four instruments, honestly played, can say even more.","Simple pleasures can be the greatest pleasures.

Boy in Da Corner,Dizzee Rascal,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a95e6ef95969322a00/1:1/w_160/1a8491fa.jpg,2003-07-06 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2345-boy-in-da-corner/,XL,"Hip-hop, one of America's last bastions of regionalism, is threatening to exalt itself out of its local roots. Authenticity issues still insist the genre is tied to the street, but where a hip-hop province used to be as compressed as the South Bronx, it's now as sprawling as the Dirty South. Even during the dichotomy of the pre-Chronic days, when East almost never met West, entire coasts counted as local wards. Ten years later, hip-hop is pop music in America, and its global reach is arguably greater than rock's has ever been. From Missy and Timbaland's tabla to Jay-Z's bhangra beats, The Neptunes' Eastern flavor to dj/Rupture's ragga/Nubian/chart-hop mashups and the Diwali-led rise of Jamaican dancehall, U.S. hip-hop is finally engaged in a two-way dialogue with the rest of the world. On his debut album, Boy in Da Corner, 18 year-old Dizzee Rascal instantly stakes a claim that East London is hip-hop's next great international outpost. East London: Rascal's world is precisely that small, and it returns a sense of rueful perspective to hip-hop lost among the soundtrack tie-ins, Godzilla-aping Bone Crusher videos, and 50 Cent-style mixtape mythmaking. In basic ways, Rascal echoes the wish fulfillment of much of American hip-hop, but he's hardly mimicking their act. Rascal is at ground level, eyes trained on his immediate surroundings. His rhymes, and especially his beats, reflect his area's desperate social, economic and political landscape. Often, this desolation hardens an emcee's psyche (Styles gets high every day to combat his mental strain) or delivery: This summer's post-ecstasy swing toward punishing sounds and pugnacious looks threatens to bleed the personality, humor, and adventure out of hip-hop. But to wunderkind Rascal, the accelerated disintegration of his immediate world pains him-- absolutely wounds him-- and it's the Tupac-esque mix of brio and vulnerability, along with his dexterous cadence and gutter beats, that separates his rhymes from the typical money/cash/hoes triptych. On the opening track, ""Sittin' Here"", Rascal concludes, ""I think I'm getting weak 'cause my thoughts are too strong."" Over ambient sounds of sirens and guns, he laments, ""It was only yesterday/ Life was a touch more sweet."" Most people Rascal's age crave arrested development, but Dizzee already longs for the innocence of childhood. And yet, the boy in da corner's emergence from adolescence isn't the start of a self-imposed purgatory-- life on the dole, or at university-- it's spent cowering, crouching and ready to pounce, and most of all, watching. Little of what he sees is pleasant: a cycle of teenage pregnancy, police brutality, and friends lost to the lure of crime and cash (if they're still alive at all). What's perhaps worse: For all of his concern and meditation, Dizzee himself offers few suggestions and little hope. He can dish bravado with the best emcees, but despite the eloquent boasts, he remains fragile, apprehensive, and consumed by the possibility of failure. ""I'll probably be doing this, probably forever"" is as convincing a career boast as Dizzee can make. The hesitation and anxiety in that claim could also double as a question: whether Rascal will dabble in hostility forever. On ""Brand New Day"", he touchingly wonders if estate violence is youthful folly that he and his mates will outgrow. Over a bittersweet melody that sounds like a blend of an Asian music box and a Lali Puna lullaby, Dizzee asks, ""When we ain't kids no more/ Will it still be about what it is right now?"" For someone with enough of a big-picture grasp to announce that he's ""a problem for Antony Blair,"" there's something tragic and poignant about Rascal wondering aloud if settling scores with organized violence is a mere child's game. Rascal's curiosity about adulthood and responsibility doesn't, however, extend to fatherhood. Although he has girls on his mind, they're approached with suspicion. ""Love talks to everyone/ Money talks more,"" a female emcee insists on ""Wot U On""; ""Jezebel"" laments the cycle of teen pregnancy, blaming a promiscuous girl for bringing other future Jezebels into the estate. And on ""Round We Go"", a ringing ""hey"" (borrowed, Just Blaze-style, from The More Fire Crew) echoes the repetition and similitude of a series of loveless romantic entanglements sexlessly listed by Dizzee. Most strikingly, his debut single ""I Luv U""-- recorded at the age of 16-- is a he-said/she-said snipe between an unmoved could-be father and a friend of the girl that could be ""juiced up."" It's a harsh amalgam of atonal bleeps and blips, washes of gabba sound, and low, harsh bass, fitting for the track's ultimately selfish approach to the impending consequences (""Pregnant/ Whatya talkin' about?/ 15?/ She's underage/ That's raw/ And against the law/ Five years or more""). It's among the record's most captivating, visceral moments. It's on ""I Luv U"" that Rascal's sound most nods to the hollow shell of UK garage's end days, just before the champagne went dry and the world economy's bubble burst. UKG's move from feminized, R&B; club music to breakbeats and emcee bravado created a thrilling light/dark duality into which So Solid Crew stepped, and it seemed as if they'd be the ones to put South London on the international hip-hop map. When the press and record buyers began to ignore UKG in droves in 2001, SSC's strength in numbers (their crew has upwards of 20 members) seemed like an urgent plea for attention. They got it: ""21 Seconds"" shot to #1 on the UK charts, which secured for the collective a memorable Top of the Pops appearance, during which almost all of their members were crammed onto the BBC studio's bulging stage. Of course, they were aware that the sheer size of their group had benefits as well as limitations: The title ""21 Seconds"" referred to the maximum amount of time any one member could spend at the mic on any given track. This faceless, monolithic look and sound provided their music with a rare and unique power, but was eventually their undoing as well. With UKG seemingly left in tatters, Rascal and pirate radio cohorts crawled into the wreckage, reconstructing its grimiest bits and blending them with RZA's paranoid minor chords, some off-kilter electro-glitch, the low-rent nihilism of Cash Money and No Limit, and the ghosts of ragga-jungle. Sparse and ugly, Rascal's record is an icy orchestra of scavenger sounds, owing as much to video games and ringtones as it does to anything more overtly musical. The despairing beats make the lyrical push and pull that much more severe: When Dizzee is venomous, they sharpen his bite; when he gamely searches for the light at the end of the tunnel, admits his failures, laments his unraveling psyche, and battles with depression, they seem like obstacles. Despite Boy in Da Corner's garage roots, it couldn't rightly be called ""dance music."" There are still traces of those long-gone days when hyping the crowd or extolling the virtues of the drugs or the music were about all a British emcee would provide, but they're nods at best. On ""2 Far"", a helium-voiced claim (""I'm the fitness instructor"") tips its hat to a rave emcee leading a crowd through its all-night workout, but now such calls are relegated to the periphery. Instead, the language-- which had often remained subservient to the beat in the UK's previous attempts to grapple with hip-hop (trip-hop, jungle, garage-rap circa 2000)-- is the focus. The point isn't to disconnect from the body, but to train the mind to match the speed of thought with the deceptively high BPMs. After a cycle of cynicism, dark humor and despair, Rascal closes the album with ""Do It"", Boy in Da Corner's answer to The Streets' album-closer ""Stay Positive"". Simultaneously, it's an apology for his antisocial behavior, a rallying cry, a confession, and a lucid realization that, despite his age, he's already reached the crossroads. His resistance worn, he admits that he wishes he could sleep forever: for days, for years, then ""for good,"" confessing that ""if I had the guts to end it all, I would."" Like he often does throughout the record, Dizzee sounds as if the only thing nearly as bad as dying is having been born. Dizzee's despairing wail, focused anger, and cutting sonics place him on the front lines in the battle against a stultifying Britain, just as Johnny Rotten, Pete Townshend, and Morrissey have been in the past. The difference between the four (and their claims that ""There's no future,"" ""I hope I die before I get old,"" ""I don't want to wake up on my own anymore,"" and ""I wish I could sleep forever"") isn't as different as it might appear on the surface: If Rascal grows at a similar rate, it's not out of the question that he could leave a comparable legacy.","Hip-hop, one of America's last bastions of regionalism, is threatening to exalt itself out of its local roots.

Lambent Material,Eluvium,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc58c0084474cd0c2a84/1:1/w_160/74afe811.jpg,2003-07-06 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2764-lambent-material/,Temporary Residence,"Life never felt so good as when I was wrist and ankle deep in freezing cold parking lot snow mounds. We were called the Alabaster Pummelers-- APs for short-- and we represented the last line of defense between the dying pangs of winter and the beautiful uprising of spring. Nicknamed the Snow-Kickers by the local press, our mission was to seek out the remaining stragglers of sporadic blizzards and destroy them in a manner befitting seasonal stowaways-- through hard and fast attacks using our feet and hands. Given an hour, we could lay an entire mountain of powdery whiteness into a mere trickle of its former self, a shivering babe where once there stood a proud Old Man Winter. Self-appointed and slightly delusional, our job was to deal with the after affects of the storm-- those dirty and unattractive areas where normal people feared to tread-- to discover beauty in violence and power in the monotonous and repetitive exercise of destruction and subsequent conception. Though I dox92t know him personally, I doubt that Matthew Cooper-- under the working guise of Eluvium-- would have passed up an opportunity to join my friends and I in one of our fierce and inspired outings. Similar to our oft misunderstood melee, Cooper attests to a brethren musical doctrine of creation over the course of his latest album Lambent Material, utilizing bare and broken shards of noise others are so quick to either throw away or gloss over as putrid waste. Simple and elegant, the music glides on the strength of progression and volume in the same manner as a poor max92s Philip Jeck-- or Mogwai at their zenith-- providing a cover of any composition from Brian Eno's Ambient series. ""Zerthis Was A Shivering Human Image"" is the exemplar track by which all others are judged on the album, as it is to best effect what one would expect from the above analogy: a minimal and lulling drone that's easy enough on the ears to be ignored as background music, yet simultaneously capable of closer and constant inspection of its subtle complexity, sound layering and instrumentation. Over a steady wash of sonic feedback that modulates slowly between piercingly loud and simply deafening, a two-chord motif is left to its own devices, phasing in and out of time with the swells of white noise. At over fifteen minutes the work comprises nearly half of the album, creating not only a wall of sound but also the rich ornamental tapestries that will adorn it, eventually collapsing into a naturally eclipsing hiss and fade. Given such a track, it's mind-boggling to wonder why Cooper didn't allot more than a normal pop song's length to the development of his other, neglected compositions. ""Under The Water It Glowed"" sputters like a fountain as a straightforward and beautiful melody adopts control, ultimately relinquishing its grip to allow a full force siren to rise high in the mix before being cut short of full expansion by ""There Wasx92t Anything"". Developed from a series of clichéd found sounds-- keys falling, coughing, laughing, etc.-- a piano eventually picks up on a three-note repetitive pattern, overtaken quickly by a dark and reedy clarinet. Though lusciously steeped in room tone and various low-key effects, the track again ends just as it is getting interesting, as if Cooper's intent isn't to provide a complete melodic notion, but simply introduce many curtailed ideas for future reference. Producing music in such an unforgivable style as Atmospheric Rock must inevitably lead both Matthew and the listener to the observance that short immature compositions-- the aptly titled ""The Unfinished"" and the dark ""I Am So Much More Me That You Are Perfectly You""-- yield an emptiness of expectation that neither rewarding nor forgiving. Displaying an intense possibility for growth, Eluvium is for the moment nothing more than a catalogue of potential and anticipation, one that will hopefully grow in confidence as well as execution as it ushers in the rebirth of its own stolid fabrication-- a redemptive springtime to combat the detached winter of Lambent Material.","Life never felt so good as when I was wrist and ankle deep in freezing cold parking lot snow mounds ...

Slicer,Wolf Eyes,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa66b1335d7bf1699670/1:1/w_160/082025e6.gif,2003-07-06 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8728-slicer/,Hanson,"A lot of what I own by Wolf Eyes is broken: Dead Hills' packaging is held together with scotch tape; Dread has no cover at all; the Slicer CD's cracked, and a couple split singles have literally fallen apart. I'm not usually such a mess with my record collection, but I figure this disrepair rests well within the spirit of the Ann Arbor trio's continually expanding, forever growling discography. Wolf Eyes has fifty-some releases since 1997, and so much music is kind of intimidating if you haven't heard them yet. Like waking up and deciding to dive into one of the hundred or so linked stories and novels comprising Honore de Balzac's La Comedie Humaine. Slicer-- a reissue of a 2001 cassette-only release of the same name-- is a good starting point for the uninitiated: the liner notes list their output up to Slicer, stylistically, it's a Wolf Eyes greatest hits, and more importantly, it's pretty damn solid. I only have a couple bones to pick, actually. At a basic aesthetic level, there are no song titles, which sucks because I always saw those tags as pictograms for or overall description and dissection of each exercise. In the past, ""Burn Your House Down"" from Dread became a call to arms for silly gas huffers and ""Dead Hills"" erupted as the earth-toned backdrop for an empty, mill-whistling middle America, because I had these brief titles as points of departure. The other downer is the first track, a two-minute vocal-splice thing redolent of The Cave, Steve Reich's overwrought Old Testament oratory. Imagining it as perversely manipulated answering machine messages made it creepier and therefore more interesting, but really, it's weak. Maybe it's a warm up for an upcoming remake of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate? On the upswing-- and what a glorious upswing!-- track two is a variation on the fuzzed-out cicada stomp I've grown to adore: six minutes of splayed horns, crackling tapes, spring-reverb, sputtering shards of salty glass door hinges and that standard high-end knob-twisting that approximates a reconstituted air-raid siren. Track three uses a bass-heavy start/stop burp/blurt that begins too tightly, but shifts to a percussive two-channel palimpsest, which grows increasingly Throbbing Gristle-sinister as the song progresses. Track four's a ten minute complication of a demonic Matmos, stalking the countryside looking for kids to rip apart while archiving the ensuing sounds with well-placed contact microphones. (And the kids who escape could break-dance to the last section of this beauty while dousing themselves with battery acid!) It's as dark and driving as Joy Division or early Swans, and as patently mute as Nurse With Wound. The penultimate track, number six, is a three-minute pop song based on the sounds of the interior of ghosts and shadows. It shifts halfway through, of course, and momentarily sputters and skips into twisted high-pitch noise land before leveling back out to an ominous whisper. The crazed horn at the end doesn't make sense compositionally, but it's a nice exclamation point. Track seven will hurt your dog's ear, I can almost guarantee that. Not much percussion for the coda, just lots and lots of singularly high-end distortion: turn your amp as high as it can go, lean your guitar against the amp, return to the room in five minutes. There you go. Besides track one, these pieces are largely without discernible human voices, which is how I prefer my Wolf Eyes: things remain more mysterious that way. Slicer's varied palette of late-night creepiness doesn't lean too much towards any stylistic trope, which makes it both a solid introduction and a fine archive to remind you why you fell so hard for these guys in the first place. Coupled with the just-released Covered in Bugs DVD-- an esoteric document offering an off-kilter look into the band's process (as well as a strangely tentative art-house moshpit comprised of giggling teenagers)-- you've got yourself a certifiable Wolf Eyes starter kit!","A lot of what I own by Wolf Eyes is broken: Dead Hills' packaging is held together with scotch tape ...

Truly She Is None Other,Holly Golightly,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf6413d197565213b89f/1:1/w_160/39569e68.jpg,2003-07-06 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3510-truly-she-is-none-other/,Damaged Goods,"Since she started making solo records in 1995, Holly Golightly's released somewhere between seven and eleven albums\x97depending on how you count the live recordings, the singles collection, the covers, and the collaborations. This might seem prolific in the modern sense, but a look at the cover art of her Singles Round-Up lays the intentions of Holly's career pretty much bare: she works something like the early rhythm and blues and country artists she'd appear to love, the sort whose record-store bins are filled with any number of releases packaging singles, standards, sessions, and cross-genre offerings. Holly's personal output of this stuff has overflowed with charming little things\x97but it still feels like her following's extended beyond the usual cultists only far enough to include record store clerks and fellow musicians, all of whom you can imagine loudly complaining about what a shame that is. People like albums these days; how far can you get working like a career singer from 1959? Well: this year has the potential to change that, though I wouldx92t hold my breath for anything huge. What happened was that Holly's cadre of fellow-musician devotees grew to include the White Stripes, who saw fit to introduce her to a Stripes-sized mainstream audience with a vocal slot on Elephant's \x93It's True That We Love One Another.\x94 The liner for Truly She is None Other even verges on the mutual backslapping of novelists by including a lengthy joke of a blurb from Jack: \x93Miss Holly Golightly comes to my house sometimes on Sunday, beautiful as the wind that blew her in. . . . Is Holly wool? If she is, then am I a bucket of water?\x94 Given her on-record persona, it's hard to imagine Holly caring much about attention, but this album does sort of sound like she's ready to come out into the light: for one thing, it runs slightly more like An Album than those in her back catalog, and for another, the recording\x97though stripped-down and naturalistic as ever\x97is a thousand times cleaner and more accessible than it's been in the past, like it's put on a nice clean dress for the company. The downside to this is that she sounds like she's on her best behavior; the songs stay awfully polite and sprightly for someone who's so good at sounding sinister. The upside is that underneath that dress, ready to impress strangers, Holly's still pretty near top form. And Holly in top form has, historically, really been something. Her approach to genre, floatily eclectic as it can be, always comes across as remarkably simple: from the girl-group garage of Thee Headcoatees, where she got her start, Holly drifted over to sounding like both sides of the segregated South. Languid juke-joint blues, department-store calico country, smoky old rhythm and blues and girl-group rock'x92roll; it's all been rendered in the echoing two-microphone style you'd guess from those retro album covers, all soft creaky drum kits and trebly guitar twang and the now-dusty feeling of brightly-covered LPs from Memphis. She doesx92t even \x93cover\x94 other people's songs so much as she sings them like standards, rich favorites for yet another dive bar: Lee Hazlewood, Willy Dixon, or a gloriously evil-sounding Ike Turner run-through (\x93Your Love is Mine\x94) that's right up there with the Shangri-La-rock of \x93Virtually Happy\x94 as one of the high points of her career. There isx92t, maybe surprisingly, a \x93Virtually Happy\x94 on this more subtle record\x97nor, what with all that damned politeness, a \x93Your Love Is Mine\x94\x97just another set of sly and twangy ramblers and standards, this set touching down twice on the Kinks. But there's her voice, which never really changes and yet must, somehow, because it seems so right in every context, from Patsy Cline to Big Maybelle and mostly something oddly in between: her interpretations of other people's songs arex92t about proving that her record collectiox92s older than yours, but about the seemingly forgotten fact that a good vocal performance rewrites everything that really matters about a song. Jack White rhapsodizes about her singing in the liner, and I'm not sure I'd be able to be much clearer: when that voice meets up with her sharpest lyrics, Holly's moods get exactly as alluring as those of her namesake. And the songs here, while they may lack the immediate killer, are about as sharp as Holly's been before: perfectly keening girl-group harmonies on \x93Without You Here,\x94 perfectly Staxy r&b; on \x93You Have Yet to Win,\x94 Texan waltz on \x93Sent,\x94 lyrics that giggle and bite. Holly's tunes tend to make the same three points as most torch, blues, and country songs: (a) you're no good, she's glad you're gone, and she might possibly be plotting some form of revenge; (b) she's no good, you'd better get going, and you'd better stay out of her way; and (c) she's no good, you're no good, and maybe that's why she cax92t live without you. You'd be surprised how those stories never get old. I dox92t know whether that White Stripes cameo will expand Holly Golightly's territory on the indie-rocker's map; I dox92t know whether she can become the Saturday-night whisky-drinking chanteuse or the Sunday-morning armchair crooner of those who arex92t about to thumb through the stacks of old LPs. But if this album really is going to be the outfit Holly's wearing when the company shows up, she should be pleased with herself: it's a little more subdued than many of us might like, but it's awfully presentable. Maybe if we all stick around and bring her enough drinks, she'll loosen back up again.","Since she started making solo records in 1995, Holly Golightly\x92s released somewhere between seven and eleven albums\x97depending on ...

Yours Mine & Ours,Pernice Brothers,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a039c0084474cd0bfaf8/1:1/w_160/3a0da71b.jpg,2003-07-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6237-yours-mine-ours/,Ashmont,"Pop music takes a lot of shit from the uninformed; for whatever reason, it's a perpetually misunderstood venture. Last week, the New Yorker opted to define the genre as a ""sweet, beguiling, never-too-challenging sound which has been a record industry staple from Bing Crosby to Doris Day to Britney Spears."" While it's smart to classify pop in terms that stretch beyond cleared capital and chart placement, doesn't it also seem myopic to handcuff pop to dopey facility? It might be bully-fun to call pop naive, but most good pop songs are complex enough to turn banal, everyday suffering into something far more palatable: properly conjured, a pop song is more than capable of translating gnarled, sloppy passions into big, swelling choruses and sticky hooks, making the otherwise intangible pings of being stupid and human not only real, but shiny and pleasant, too. Behind every successful pop song there's a solid reason to sob; that it actually makes you grin is pop's crucial creative triumph. Which is more genius than ""sweet."" So calling the Pernice Brothers a pop project isn't the same as economic prophesizing or patronizing their mission. It's fairly unlikely that Yours Mine & Ours, the Brothers' latest record (self-released on Pernice's own Ashmont label, with, presumably, a modest marketing push) will ever crack mainstream markets, however suitable its calm, soothing melodies might be to blithe summertime cruising (check the 4th of July fireworks on the cover and gnaw a leftover hot dog, Americans). It's equally unlikely that anyone would find this record ""never-too-challenging."" But Yours Mine & Ours is driven by the same kind of quirky pop sensibility you'd find in a Top 40 song-- the incessant juxtaposition of reality and fantasy, of rolling heartbreaks up in unbearably light, lush harmonies and amiably cooed bits of poetry. For the most part, the album is straightforward, guitar-driven stuff; nobody crams a fork into the mixer, vintage synthesizers don't disintegrate mid-bridge in a flurry of swooning blips, and Pernice's lyrics almost always make some sort of narrative sense, produced with an unapologetic eye toward polished melodies and clean, sweet finishes. Unlike the Pernice Brothers' previous two records, which featured loads of gushing strings and some big orchestral bombast, this is also a solid rock effort-- guitars, drums, bass, occasional piano or keyboard, and flawlessly harmonized vocals, exclusively. Taking a cue from his pitch- perfect vocals, Pernice has imbued Yours Mine & Ours with a golden glow reminiscent of classic AM radio and mid-60s Brian Wilson: it's all sunshine and broken hearts. ""Baby in Two"" could sit comfortably on any Elliott Smith album, with its rich acoustic strums and steady percussion, a honey-voiced Joe backing himself in half-whispered laments: ""I wish I knew/ A sure, simple way to reach you/ I'd be the King if I could say to you/ Cut the baby in two."" Pernice's oddly dark (and inarguably bizarre) couplet (dig your own interpretation) eventually shifts into a high, rousing chorus of ""Cut the baby in two!""; ""Baby in Two"" is probably the most pointed example of the Pernice Brothers sneaking an explicitly distressing plea into a sunny, eyes-closed acoustic sigh (this kind of age-old pop mischief is all over Yours Mine & Ours-- ""Number Two"" cheerily admits ""I hope that this letter finds you crying/ Feels so good to see you cry."") Opener ""The Weakest Shade of Blue"" is an impeccably composed, perpetually sparkling string of singalong pop hooks that clocks in at a perfect three minutes; ""Water Ban"" is lilting and strangely addictive, a pastoral rumination on summertime drought (think crispy front lawns, brown patches, and dull, hollow swimming pools: ""It's hard to understand/ The cruel, cruel summer of a water ban"") evoked via rolling guitar and twinkling keyboards. ""Sometimes I Remember"" is a Cure tribute via New Order, marked by a curious stream of backing falsettos and thick, post-punk guitar. Overall, Yours Mine & Ours is strikingly consistent: each track is fully realized, thoughtfully written, and prudently performed, rolled out with a steadiness that can become a little maddening after a handful of listens. But like any successful pop venture, the album can feel a bit formulaic (and, occasionally, laboriously nostalgic): what ultimately saves this record from redundancy is Joe Pernice's stuttering conviction that every word he sings has been dunked in some kind of big, bold truth. Even those who prefer their pop records scrappier or more aggressively innovative should be able to unearth some kind of slack-jawed, clench-your-fist glee here; instantly impressed or not, it's almost impossible not to eventually uncover something useful in Pernice's intense, earnest dirge. 2003 has already seen pop principles well showcased by commercially peripheral bands like the New Pornographers and the Lilys (incidentally, Pernice Brothers bassist Thom Monahan played bass on two Lilys records), who twist pop formula into something smart and occasionally perverse. On Yours Mine & Ours, the Pernice Brothers have done same. Pop music edges one step closer to justice.","Pop music takes a lot of shit from the uninformed; for whatever reason, it's a perpetually misunderstood venture. Last ...

Oaklandazulasylum,WHY?,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa2b13d19756521399b3/1:1/w_160/d7259d35.jpg,2003-07-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8670-oaklandazulasylum/,Anticon,"Here's a record by a hip-hop emcee who spends half the album hunched over a guitar, daring to slum it as a bedroom songwriter. As a member of Anticon-- the hip-hop collective that bleeds at will into other genres-- it's no surprise for Why? (born Jonathan Wolf) to mix in live instruments or write straight-up songs; he already matched guitar with beats on Miss Ohio's Nameless, and you could call his half of Split EP a kind of song cycle. And yet every time I throw on Oaklandazulasylum it still sounds like the damnedest thing: surprising, confusing, and so wrong it's right. Ever since Why?, Odd Nosdam and Doseone cut their cLOUDDEAD full-length-- still their biggest claim to fame outside the hip-hop world-- they've been under the gun to cut records that are not only as fucked up as their breakthrough, but as fully-realized, albums where the artists drown you in their desparately individual voices, instead of just passing by in a flash of cleverness. For Why?, Oaklandazulasylum is the first disc since cLOUDDEAD that pulls it off. Producers Odd Nosdam and Jel make guest appearances, but for most of the disc it's Why? who chops up song structure and shuffles arrangements from track to track, fine-tuning the music from every angle. And from the first song it sounds rich and original, with the guitar, simple percussion and blatting horns that start ""Ferris Wheel"" before it segues to beats and blippy electronics. Why? straddles both camps with total ease. The closest comparison I can make is to The Books' Thought for Food and its similarly organic (and gorgeously captured) mix of sample-based and acoustic music. Plenty of songwriters back their strumming with drum machines, but Why?'s not diddling with digital perfection: these are heavy, multi-layered beats, some lo-fi and crunchy and others high, bright and almost piercing. On that note, there is a very slight downer, which is that Why?'s vocals may be hard for some to take, a nasal drawl that hits somewhere between Soul Coughing's M. Doughty and They Might Be Giants' John Linnell. I'm not a big fan of Doughty or Linnell myself; fortunately, Why?'s tone isn't nearly as extreme (and certainly not as quirky) as either, and was never enough to distract me from his most impressive performances, or this record's remarkable uniqueness. Why? switches from rhythmic delivery to naked singing, sometimes on a dime. The slight nasal quality of his voice sounds so awkward that he can't help but play it up-- ""Dream on Costelyou"" sounds so unmelodic you can't even believe they let this guy sing-- but witness the brilliantly jerked-out delivery on ""Early Whitney"", where he treats the syllables like a set of steps to jog over. The almost grotesque, overdubbed harmonies at the end of ""Weak Moon"" sound so warped that they bend your eardrum, but they're perfectly on pitch, and when he turns to a genuinely tuneful voice later on, it doesn't come as a total surprise. On technical terms this may be Why?'s best-realized recording, not to mention the most startling album Anticon has dropped this year. But the biggest surprise is how engaging it is-- and how much more you connect with Why? after hearing it. All of the cut-up collages and lo-fi tapes in his prior work were incredibly scattershot, full of distractions that kept his ideas from sticking around. I can think of more classic Why? lines than full Why? songs, let alone albums. But this record fleshes out the seemingly non-sequitor lyrics, and makes them resonate. I've ribbed the Anticon artists for their habitual memoir-writing, which, coupled with their surreal left turns can become a non-stop emotional reveal-and-feint. This time, instead of just dropping clever lines about his dad, he writes ""Afterschool America"", a song so tuneful and lyrically rich it's difficult to imagine how he fit in everything in a minute and a half. Why?'s geeky personality becomes human, and when he states, ""I'm not myself without my Challenger commemorative button on my brown down vest,"" I can picture the dorky kid who would obsess about a piece of clothing-- hell, I was that dork, too. When he spits out lines like, ""Kissing me is a waste of your saliva,"" I can empathize with him for the first time ever. The last few songs grow murky, and don't introduce much that we haven't already heard, and the second side definitely lacks the locked-together flow of the first, but Oaklandazulasylum succeeds where it counts. It's as major a step as you'd expect-- really, as you'd demand-- from someone like Why?, not only for its sheer inventiveness, but the continuity that turns these lyrical snapshots into moving portraits, of urban neighborhoods, half-understood women, and most of all, Why? himself, as a kid, a misfit, and an artist.

Holy Roller Novocaine,Kings of Leon,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1fc0084474cd0c2a04/1:1/w_160/386faf63.jpg,2003-07-02 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4559-holy-roller-novocaine/,RCA,"The best thing about British rock journalists is the way they get genuinely riled up, sometimes with little consideration for longevity, reason, or next week. Then, inevitably, people complain about investing their wads of hard- earned dollars on mediocre, wackily-hyped shit that, shockingly, doesn't live up to the quote-laden poster hyperbole decorating the concrete walls of their local record store. But there's still something kinda charming about occasionally overstated fervor, an intangible giddiness that's reminiscent of pure, unmitigated, guitar-inspired glee. NME might be completely insane, but it's packed with the kind of blind, unchecked excitement that a lot of other magazines have learned to haughtily avoid in favor of (yawn) detached objectivity. England's awfully excited about the Kings of Leon this summer, and the Kings of Leon, it turns out, are just excited: hordes of gushing rock writers are stumbling around in a post-Glastonbury glow (the Kings boasted, apparently, a wild second stage set), gearing up to pronounce the Kings rock's new (cringe) royalty. Stateside, critical pants are still zipped, but the band's already garnered a fair amount of positive mumbling from a handful of journalists, and is tentatively scheduled to release a full-length on RCA in late July (which, in all likelihood, should get the Kings' U.S. publicity machine up and running). For now, there's Holy Roller Novocaine, a five-song EP; apparently, a fifteen-minute record is adequate evidence for mammoth hyping. This small offering of sincere, blues-based, anthemic Tennessee rock comes care of five guys with the same last name (three brothers-- sons of a Pentecostal preacher-- and one cousin), lots of hair, a couple of mustaches, and super-tight jeans. Prepare yourself for reading the phrase ""southern-fried"" several thousand times over the course of the summer: rawk has returned (again). For all their throwback styling, the Kings of Leon are exceptionally twenty-first century. Contemporary music has, for the most part, become about ticking off impressive, heavily-annotated lists of influences, and squeezing old sounds into vaguely novel templates; the new game is how well you can pull off the pilfering-- how dynamic you can make a record's re- contextualization. Holy Roller's five songs mix late 60s garage/psychedelia with sprawling 70s guitar rock, and while the resulting sound is new enough, its underpants are still showing. It's not hard to see the colors of Kings past here: Steppenwolf, the Kinks, Neil Young, the Band, even skimpy traces of the Velvet Underground. When the Kings deliberately channel (""Molly's Chambers"" hosts a strategically placed, howl-'till-they-holler-""Freebird!"" guitar solo), they sound more like a diluted Black Crowes than a squad of agile up-and-comers, but when they do edge into more innovative terrain: vocalist Caleb Followill has a rich, nimble rock yell, and lead guitarist Matthew spews the sort of feral wails that classic rock radio stations will shamelessly anoint. Mostly, though, however the Kings convince because they're just so obviously jazzed to be playing music. ""California Waiting"" is Holy Roller's juicy center, the poppiest of the EP's five songs and a catchy (if comparably bland) piece of summertime Petty-pop. Its good-natured guitar, clean bass, and singalong, speeding-down-the-highway chorus become, after a few listens, a gooey, static reminder of how pop formula can go a little awry in the wrong hands. The song withers with your increasing attention, despite the band's quasi-noble attempts to inject it with energy. Happily, ""Holy Roller Novocaine"" is a far more dynamic, freaked-out track, buried in a raucous, semi-sinister fog of lecherous vocals; a thick, bouncy bassline dodges in and out of jangly guitar crashes and creepy lyrics (""Darling, you look lovely/ I've come to lay you down,"" or ""You don't have much I can't take away""). Here, the Kings successfully pull off cocky posturing over bouncing rock throwdowns. ""Wasted Time"" is a quick, aggressive romp with darting guitars and mumbled vocals; ""Wicker Chair"" is a straightforward acoustic swansong, topped with careful cymbal brushes and lush strumming. As a quarter-hour buzz, it's all fine. It's easy to get twitchy about the artfully achieved resurrection of past superheroes, until the recognition of derivation hits, splatters, and gets everything wet. Kings of Leon aren't nearly as dangerous or as innovative as their influences, but they're likable enough; more importantly, though, the Kings perform their stuff with the same kind of wound-up, unbridled abandon that marks their steamy UK press. And big, blind enthusiasm has its own sort of appeal: wouldn't you take excited and referential over apathetic and reserved?","The best thing about British rock journalists is the way they get genuinely riled up, sometimes with little \n\ consideration ...

Missing Dragons EP,A Grape Dope,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf9413d197565213b8ea/1:1/w_160/d9a0c533.gif,2003-07-02 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3554-missing-dragons-ep/,Galaxia,"Here is my confession: I love Disney straight-to-VHS/DVD sequels. I can't get enough of them. The happily-ever-after shtick was frustratingly transparent even when I was prepubescent-- a few years out of the sipper-cup stage-- but now, thanks in part to a completist fanbase and incredibly lean production budgets, I no longer have to second guess with imagination the fate of Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and, more importantly, Air Bud. Certainly the storylines are even weaker than the arguably anemic plots of the originals, but just having something-- anything-- to remind me of the childhood pleasure derived from those animated highlights of my innocent years is enough to invite repeated viewing of these oft vapid explorations in cliché and concession. My predilection has taken hold: I feel the need to slightly alter the label of John Herndon's latest musical outing-- in the name of truth in advertising-- from Missing Dragons to simply Tortoise II: A Grape Dope, a contribution to be enjoyed solely by those still utterly steeped in the mystique of that seminal group. Though Herndon's A Grape Dope alias doesn't sound anything like his percussive role in Chicago's own terrapin-influenced jazz and post-rock outfit-- after all, sequels rarely stay true to the main focus of the original creation-- but nonetheless, I can assure you this collection of six uninspired tracks will appeal only to the small clique of people who haven't yet taken Standards or TNT out of their CD wallet. A predictably beat-driven affair, the EP begins with ""Action: Showered Us"", a track geminated but not complimented by the later ""Inaction: Shadowed Us"". The former begins with a sputtering deep rhythm accented by a high-end hiccup that rises to prominence, only to be interrupted occasionally by Yosemite Sam, cut-up vocals. A distant clattering is mirrored in the latter track, as a weak melody plays out in the background, rising and falling until it eventually shatters and stops. Both of the compositions emphasize the studio-experimentation vibe of Missing Dragons: each lends itself more for use as a backing track on an underground MC's lo-fi debut than a stand-alone song captivating in its own right. Bolstering my damning accusation of inadequacy is the fact that the best cut on the album, ""Red Hat Attack"", is only made listenable by the guest appearance of avant-garde hip-hop artist Doseone, who sing-songs his way through a discussion of two red cars and various abstract images. A watery beat serves as an adequate addition to the rapper's high-end nasally drawl, before all voices culminate in a spitfire finale of skipping beats and rising tones. ""When You Crash and Burn"" and ""I'll Spread It"", unfortunately, do not sport a similar musical charm despite being likewise laced with ornate vocal appending. Featuring an incredibly weak and mechanical rhythm, the tracks are both outfitted by unnecessary oral effects and manipulations, resulting in top-heavy tunes that would invoke spite if they weren't so quickly forgotten. ""Hellz Bellz"" ends Herndon's solo excursion on a less obvious and more sinister note, utilizing a dark pulse to lead the way though his electronic noodling and interestingly more organic beats, this time outfitted with a synthetic drone and some nominally fitting bells. Though a respected drummer-- one doesn't earn the nick-name ""Machine"" by chance-- John's latest creation is neither for fans searching to get clued-in on Chicago's ailing music scene, nor anyone looking for a resurgence of past glory. An unappealing release with few redeeming qualities, Missing Dragons will endure an analogous fate with the fairy-tale also-rans mentioned above; a fate that only collectors and diehard fans, biding their time until Herndon returns to his day job, could even remotely enjoy.","Here is my confession: I love Disney straight-to-VHS/DVD sequels.

Shame Fantasy II,Pink and Brown,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16513d1975652138607/1:1/w_160/49715c6c.jpg,2003-07-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6524-shame-fantasy-ii/,Load,"I was doing dishes to the sounds of Orthrelm at my girlfriend's apartment the other day; she came into the room after a hard day of designing crashpads, and asked if we could listen to something softer like, maybe, Wolf Eyes. I misheard, thought she wanted to know if I was listening to Wolf Eyes: ""No, this is Orthrelm."" She responded: ""I know, I have a headache, can we listen to something else?"" I dried my hands of it, and turned off those cloven gods of the dogged riff. This is common domestic drama and you could just as easily switch some variables in the story around. Let's say I'm removing the caked-on grease of coconut tofu cheesecake while playing Lightning Bolt, The Fuckers, or Pink and Brown. I guess Orthrelm's more metal, which fit my mood at the time. Those indie-rock superstars in Lightning Bolt are less rock, more noise. I'd like to keep things of-the-now and The Fuckers broke up ages ago (I only own one of their singles anyway) so fuck that. Of the four options-- just one of a million noisy duos-- Pink and Brown is the most straightforward Rock. Pink uses a duct-taped throat microphone and a single guitar, Brown does drums; they sound like John Spencer might if someone lowered his voice in the mix and kicked him in the stomach during any of his cribbed solos, then proceeded to shave his head. During the band's vaguely chaotic three-year existence they only managed to drop a single full length, 2001's Final Foods on Toyo Records, and a 12"" split with Death Drug on Load in 2002. This could be because they live in separate cities within the golden state: Dwyer in San Francisco and Rosenberg in Los Angeles. Maybe they couldn't deal with the different sensibilities rampant in either overdetermined geography? The tiny output could equally be attributed to their million other projects: John Dwyer's most notably a key player in the Coachwhips and Zeigenbock Kopf (wearing mustaches and acting German with Aaron Aites of Iran) and Jeff Rosenberg plays in the Young People. So what's their deal? If you mention Pink and Brown, chances are some smarmy someone will mention the band's outfits. The colors pink and brown go together nicely. It's a good aesthetic with a fine political undertone referencing Thomas Sowell's 1977 essay ""Pink and Brown People"", which dealt with the polarizing inaccuracies of language used to describe different races. If you want to fixate there, the coolest thing about the outfits is the fake beard sometimes worn by Pink. Though the two already come wrapped in vaguely creepy masks and body suits, Pink for some reason attaches a Walt Whitman looking slab of fluff to the outside of his ski-mask: the artifice is ridiculously apparent, but admirably so. What is it with these duos and uniforms? But come on: they could've only gotten so far if all they had were the tights. Whatever your take, the fairly new 22-track opus, Shame Fantasy II, is a complete discography plus five new songs recorded on New Year's Day 2003 by Dave Brokema of Numbers (There's also a Shame Fantasy II LP, which only has the new live tracks). I have never heard so much Pink and Brown in one sitting; while I admire steadfastness, the sporadic lack of differentiation made me antsy after a while, sometimes undoing the listening session. Because their attack is pretty even tempered and there are no explanatory liner notes provides, you're forced to differentiate time periods within the oeuvre by judging sound qualities and recording set-ups: I won't give these answers away, pretend this is Musician magazine and give those lazy ears of yours a test. The album opens with ""Black Pearl""-- slightly over a minute of spiraling rock-- zoning out on a Tim Green project filtered through a fan, and ends with ""The Tunnel"", a vacuum-packed two minute decomposition of guitar rock in a miasmatic sinkhole; it shoves off via a pretty little breakdown part: rat-a-tat and puffs of distorted smoke floating out to sea. The twenty tracks between mix-up these modalities, adding spaced-out portions of noise ruminations, chipped-away drum solos, upfront salivation, tuneful interludes, pitch-perfect handstands, entropic staying patterns, and layers upon layers of caustic interpolations. By and large, the shit rocks. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you'll hate it, but at least it's all available in one easy document so you can swallow the crust and decide for yourself if there's more to these two than the suave outfits. Or if you should file under ""one trick pony,"" along with any number of uninspired independent hacks. I loudly lodge a vote for the former. And I plan to spin Shame Fantasy II tonight as I scrub away those goddamn mashed potatoes.","I was doing dishes to the sounds of Orthrelm at my girlfriend's apartment the other day; she came into ...

The Present Lover,Luomo,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda45e6ef959693230cd/1:1/w_160/12d689fa.jpg,2003-07-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4928-the-present-lover/,BMG,"Identity can be a tricky quality to evaluate. Often, it's hard to tell who is the actual ""owner"" of the qualities in question. Example: if a jazz drummer with an interest in abstract, improvisational electronic music suddenly starts turning out smooth vocal house records then perhaps there's an expectation that he would be criticized. Is this an expectation of the audience? Of the artist to play down his own work? Of the ""critics""? Maybe there's a question of the artist's intent or sincerity. Maybe the identifiable relationship the record has with all of the players in question supercedes the need to find links to the tried and true critical vices. Finland's Luomo is that artist who would be the focus of an identity crisis. Luomo (aka Vladislav Delay) offers very few easy answers. Having taken an interest in jazz (particularly the sprawling eccentricity of Miles Davis) from a very early age, he began his musical career attempting to make a go as a jazz drummer. Though still in his teens, he soon realized he wasn't going to make his real statement (or a living) in jazz, and gravitated to electronics. His first recordings retain the adventurous, improvised spirit of jazz, but come out like rather dry, experimental ambient. If he was well on the way to becoming a full-fledged IDM technician, it would be another one who would de-emphasize the 'D' quotient. All the stranger, then, that he should make a startlingly adept transition to house on 2001's Vocalcity (his first release under the Luomo moniker). Stranger still that it was received with open arms from most anyone in the vicinity. Vocalcity's strange brew of clicks, cuts and ultra-suave female cooing was an impressive accomplishment for someone admittedly unfamiliar with the genre. What's more, it was the mark of someone apparently oblivious to what he was ""supposed"" to be doing, and the result is warm, (com)passionate music. The Present Lover continues the experiment, and in general improves on it. Luomo, in typically modest fashion, speaks of the ""panic"" he went through recording the vocals on Vocalcity, having never featured any on previous releases. It's a safe bet he isn't panicking now, as the singing here (both female and male) is as smooth as it comes. However, it's also reminiscent of thousands of faceless lounge and downtempo compilations featuring ""soulful divas"" and androgynous emoting-- and if that's a problem for you (you know who you are), The Present Lover might come on a tad strong. Still, it fits the cosmopolitan, deeply European tracks to a tee. Even if you've never set foot in a club, the lengthy, passive strains of tunes like ""Could Be Like This"" or the title track work just as well as pure trance (not the dance kind, er, though you could dance to it). From the beginning of the album, things don't unfold as they should. ""Visitor"" is a lush, beatless piece of pop impressionism. If I didn't know better, I'd say Luomo was doing a pretty good job of presenting the over-reported sound of Scandinavia, what with its glacial momentum and tendency to replace all the rough edges with icy consonance. The low-key chorus of female vocals proclaims, ""I doubt you wanna make me burn,"" and it is clearly more of a plea than a prediction. Throughout The Present Lover, passiveness and submission seem like attributes rather than easy targets. Likewise, on ""Cold Lately"", the female narrator (longtime Vladislav Delay collaborator AGF) inquires ""what makes you so cold at home?"" over near-glitch slow-jam and deep, percolating bass as if the mere fact that she cared to ask would make everything better. As the tune progresses, her vocal is overrun by a series of computer-generated cuts and pops, but it hardly loses its vulnerability (and notice that oozing synth cluster in the background never went away). Several tracks are clearly suited for club play, and would probably work wonders for your party as it approaches its final hour. ""Talk in Danger"" plays up its midtempo, hi-hat intensive groove while AGF continually reassures you that she isn't trying to disappoint you, and goes on a lengthy tangent about how ""talking in danger"" helps her find her ability to trust. This kind of freeform narrative doesn't seem like it would work in any music related to pop, but Luomo's perpetually engaging track makes it seem perfectly natural. The title track features male vocals (likely provided by Delay himself), and a punchier beat. Where it aligns itself more closely to straight-ahead house via repetitive hooks and bouncy four-on-the-floor, it also manages to slip in non-sequiturs like the bizarre, slinky synth solo about three minutes in. ""Shelter"" furthers the energetic feel, but again lapses into strangely formless structure as the vocal floats in and out of the mix, sometimes not seeming a part of the song at all. The by-now familiar female chorus offers something like a hook, but Delay's background in improvisation colors The Present Lover in unexpected ways. There are no resounding resolutions or triumphant cymbal swells here. There are no recapitulations of a verse or concessions to an obvious form. Just like a modern free music ensemble, Luomo makes his mark via an impact delivered over time and through the interaction (albeit self-imposed) and modification of the sounds at his disposal. There is a decent chance you'll glide right past this record if you've often found yourself at odds with house music. I certainly wasn't terribly enamored of the stuff coming into The Present Lover. But this is an easy album to recommend, largely due to it having an impact far beyond the dancefloor. Sometimes it just doesn't pay to hang onto old biases, and for now, I'm perfectly willing to leave this on repeat if you are.","Identity can be a tricky quality to evaluate.

A,Cass McCombs,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e2c0084474cd0bff00/1:1/w_160/fe27773b.gif,2003-07-01 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5178-a/,Monitor,"I have never sent out a SASE in my life, and I'm not about to start now. Whenever a reasonably well-heeled corporate entity asks me to perform the bizarre act of mailing an envelope in an envelope, the pettiness makes me shudder. Newcomer Cass McCombs has the nerve to request a self-addressed, stamped envelope from anyone who wishes to read the lyrics to his debut full-length-- and truth be told, I almost complied. Cass McCombs is an intriguing man. His songwriting abilities are undeniable but weirdly de-emphasized. His reedy voice is either awfully affected (he sounds like Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, or like a male Maria McKee) or poised to become one of our Great Acquired Tastes alongside Robert Smith's meow and Stephen Malkmus's yawn. A, while a fine album, is full of head-scratching choices; just as its harsh lyrics policy can't be explained by financial reasons (the inside of the CD booklet is wasted on a large Pollockian doodle), some of the production touches are just as odd. But it does make you suspect that we're dealing with a genius-- one that has yet to be properly framed. This music, designed to resist classification, is basically (horrors) indie rock, except with a crooning pianist at the helm. Stop before you imagine Ben Folds: everything here is solemn and slow, and glistens with analog reverb. Shoegazing, with wing-tip shoes. The lyrics appear fittingly sad and literate. The album's first track, ""The Hospital"", wastes little time before imagining the protagonist's demise: ""I may soon be gone/ To pluck on a harp/ Like those colored-pencil portraits of dogs/ We saw on a blue tarp."" Not sure about the blue tarp. Could be Plutarch. Dreamy and disturbing, ""The Hospital"" is a terrific song, and folks at Monitor are correct in focussing on it as The Single. It also sets the tone for about 80% of the disc-- literally. Over the course of the next ten numbers, there are precious few deviations in tempo, style or delivery; the same pall hovers over the entire record. ""AIDS in Africa"", meanwhile, achieved distinction by annoying me. Delivering the title line in an urbane croon just doesn't work. If McCombs is going for Situationist-style semiotic disorientation, it's way too convoluted a gag. The two relatively upbeat tracks are ""Bobby, King of Boys Town"", which sounds like Blondie's ""The Tide Is High"" on 15rpm, and ""When the Bible Was Wrote"". The latter, fast by McCombs' standards, is a shaggy piece of Western swing with a history lesson for lyrics. If not for all the reverb, it could have been the Silver Jews. But one frustrating aspect of listening to A is trying to gauge exactly how serious McCombs is. Some signs point to the possibility that he's a supremely deadpan ironist, an indie Robbie Williams come to mock the genre from the inside. But, as one of his songs defensively puts it, ""A Comedian Is Someone Who Tells Jokes"". Cass McCombs arrives in a cloak of fanciful ambiguity. It already feels a couple sizes too small for him.","I have never sent out a SASE in my life, and I'm not about to start now. Whenever a ...

Dancing Machine: Erase Errata Remix Record EP,Erase Errata,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc96ea9e61561daa74e7/1:1/w_160/caedd9bf.jpg,2003-07-01 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2821-dancing-machine-erase-errata-remix-record-ep/,Troubleman Unlimited,"The black bars covering the mouths of Erase Errata's four members on the cover of this brief new remix record seem to indicate that these four tracks might be attempting to disguise the band's raw post-punk guitar screeches and no-wave experiments. If that's the case, though, most of its artists seem to failed miserably. Fortunately, while results vary greatly in both sound and quality, they're all interesting variations on the band's well-established themes. And they'll kill on the dancefloor. Kid606 takes ""Retreat, The Most Familiar"" from the band's forthcoming second full-length, At Crystal Palace, and throws in some backwards drum loops and boinging springs that both smack of Siouxsie & The Banshees' classic ""Peek-A-Boo"". The rhythmic hisses and frontwoman Jenny Hoyston's sneered shouts of ""Spectre! Spectre!"", however, remain intact. It almost sounds like 606 layered The Fall's ""Spectre Versus Rector"" over ""My New House"", resulting in some weird new palimpsest that continually wheels back on itself into a digitized dervish. Matmos' Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt take Other Animals' title track into an area of androgynous drone jounce that reduces its lyrics into small splices of documentarian-type vocal inflections. It surprisingly snaps like latex, the cut-up voices of Lil' Lisa and J. Lesser recalling LaTour's ""People Are Still Having Sex"" bumped against some AFX-vox distortion while hundreds of little sounds-- like re-booting Windows gongs, ""Beat It"" bongs, and digitized chimp chitters-- get in on the plunderphonic orgy. Adult. proves that their electro envelope warping is as sinewy as ever, twisting arpeggiation like prime Giorgio Moroder around the Other Animals track ""Marathon"". Perhaps shockingly, it's Kevin Blechdom (late of the notoriously scatological electro-duo Blectum from Blechdom) that offers the most mutilated of entry. On ""Rat Race"", she loops voices into the wobbly moans of an off-kilter carousel, distorting the calliope pipes and haphazardly tossing in snippets of bluegrass and squelches of bass, all far afield of any distinguishable features of Errata. But no matter the pedigree of the mixers involved here, none (save Blechdom) seem capable of altering the barbed and freaky contours of the group beyond recognition, much less take them out any further than the band has already gone. Each remixer ultimately sounds like themselves, which is curious, given the band's singular features. There are no extraneous sounds here; neither side is dressing up these paper dolls needlessly, nor stripping them down to anything leaner than what they originally were. It's a tough makeover, given the abstract time signatures and unpredictability that the girls swear by. Fortunately, everyone still looks good at the end of the night, even if they are switching sides.","The black bars covering the mouths of Erase Errata's four members on the cover of this brief new remix ...

Koroshiya Ichi,Karera Musication,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6fc0084474cd0c2867/1:1/w_160/92f73479.gif,2003-07-01 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4389-koroshiya-ichi/,Monsoon,"One of the pitfalls of listening to new music is that often, expectations can inform the experience as much as the sounds themselves. Listener baggage can turn a terrible record into something much more palatable, as well as provoking utter disappointment at something that's merely different than what we expect. I would argue that 'listener baggage' is, in actuality, the dominant force when listening to music (another column for another time), but in the case of Koroshiya Ichi (or Ichi the Killer), it was positively devastating. Karera Musication is apparently a one-off project by most of the members of Japan's Boredoms. Everyone from that band, except ringleader Eye, contributes to the soundtrack of noted shock-violence director Takashi Miike's film. Guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto is the driving force here, with much help from drummer Yoshimi P-We, and while the music they've put together for the project is nice enough, it's hardly the revelatory explosion I've come to expect from its parent band. All the elements are there: future-thrill electronics, heavy-handed percussion interludes, big, dumb guitar riffing and surprisingly smooth trumpet lines-- yet, something is missing. Could it be that Eye (despite being thanked in the liner notes) is the missing spark needed for this band to be exciting? Could it be that playing 'background music' forces them to hold back their usual primal joy? Probably a bit of both. All of the tracks have Japanese titles, but that's of little consequence as the general ambience is probably more important than the names. The album begins as a series of sound effects, including backwards percussion, birds, sine waves and tropical drumming. This is very similar to recent Boredoms efforts, and I took it (prematurely) as a good sign. The short exposition leads to a straightforward groove track, with more tropical percussion, adding a repeated Yoshimi vocal sample and lots of shimmering bells. Various sound effects float in and out of focus, and the mix is fleshed out with soft guitar chords. It sounds nice, and I suppose it is pleasant in its way, but dreadfully unaffecting. Good soundtracks evoke strong images or impressions of a film, and the best ones go beyond this, working as great works unto themselves. Pleasant background music is okay, but unfortunately for Yamamoto and the gang, non-essential. The album's third track introduces a more kinetic frame, with wah-wah guitar, a mellow funk beat and a catchy horn line, but is nonetheless easy-listening for Bore heads. A few tracks up the intensity level ever so slightly with comparatively noisy walls of electric guitar and splashy percussion, while others incorporate traditional Japanese instruments and a calm, almost reverent atmosphere. For any longtime Bore-saga followers, this is where expectations might get the best of you, though a positive spin might be that it's sort of interesting to hear them experiment with unusual textures. The latest rumor is that Yamamoto and bassist Hira have left Boredoms, and Eye and company have formed a new band called Vooredoms. If this is true, Karera Musication could be the last time we ever hear of this particular group of people together on a CD. That would be a shame, because I always thought Yamamoto brought a much-needed, punky eclecticism to Boredoms' sound, and this soundtrack hardly does justice to his many talents. Collectors will be interested, but the rest of you should stay tuned for the Vooredoms release.","One of the pitfalls of listening to new music is that often, expectations can inform the experience as much as ...

"Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals",The High Llamas,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0d6c0084474cd0c3254/1:1/w_160/671160e9.jpg,2003-07-01 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3857-retrospective-rarities-and-instrumentals/,V2,"The High Llamas always seem more interesting when you're not actually listening to them. You hear the band's name and think, ""Ah, that guy Sean O'Hagan, who arranges for and plays with Stereolab, he has his own band. He worships the 67-72 Beach Boys and is dying to work with Brian Wilson. That sounds like an interesting band."" And then you actually put Hawaii or Cold and Bouncy on the hi-fi and, well... High Llamas are consistent and their records always sound nice, but they're rarely inspiring. Some vital spark is missing. Maybe it's O'Hagan's so-so voice, or that his arranging gifts outstrip his melodic skill. But High Llamas are a Consistently Slightly Better than OK Band, and not a lot more. The two-disc Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals collection gathers 16 of the High Llamas' best songs on its first disc, and 15 additional b-sides and import-only bonus tracks on its second. It's an evenly spaced summary of the band's roughly ten years of existence, omitting only 2000's Drag City Release Buzzle Bee and the seriously underrated remix disc Lollo Rosso (""Shotop Hic Hup"" is perhaps Mouse on Mars' best remix). One thing the retrospective disc does particularly well is cherry-pick O'Hagan's best melodies. He's released plenty tracks with interesting harmonic movement and smartly layered instrumentation, but he hasn't written a ton of great, hummable songs. Hawaii's ""Nomads"" and ""Literature Is Fluff"", Gideon Gaye's ""Checking In Checking Out"", and Santa Barbara's ""Apricots"" are all there, for a few moments putting O'Hagan in Andy Partridge's league as a craftsman of quirky-but-catchy tunes. The tracks not up to that songwriting standard get by on other virtues. Cold and Bouncy's ""Three Point Scrabble"" and ""Glide Time"" are from a time when the High Llamas were finding interesting ways to incorporate squishy electronics into their sound (Stereolab's similarly textured Dots and Loops came out four months earlier), and the luscious blend of the modular-synth stuff with the strings and vocal la-la-la's still sounds great. The b-sides disc is obviously spottier. Culled equally from the same span of time as the best-of tracks, the rarities and instrumentals generally offer more of the same with slightly lower quality. The instrumentals are for the most part decent, but the vocal songs are utterly forgettable. Apparently, though O'Hagan undoubtedly can piece together tasteful instrumentals until the cows come home, he's unlikely to relegate an excellent song to a b-side. Highlights here include the Snowbug-era ""Beachy Bunch"", which uses a broken steel drum as a lead instrument to great effect and features one of O'Hagan's more brilliant spare arrangements, and the sweet, swooning ""It Might as Well Be Dumbo"". The longer ""suites""-- ""Mini-Management"" and ""Cropduster""-- can't justify their runtimes (one is nine minutes, the other nearly eight), but ""Janet Jangle"" and ""Over the River"" show that O'Hagan can wring a fair amount of interest from extremely simple melodies, especially when he's using odd instrumental combinations like banjo, flute and Moog. Like Madonna's The Immaculate Collection, the best-of disc from Retrospective is the sort of overview that's almost too well done: it sums up the artist's career to this point so completely you have to ask yourself whether you need anything more. O'Hagan's interest in ""Let's Go Away for Awhile""-type interludes means that High Llamas records always have a certain amount of (admittedly relatively pleasant) filler. The first disc prunes the dull material and leaves the welcome highlights, so when you want a shot of High Llamas, Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals satisfies completely.","The High Llamas always seem more interesting when you're not actually listening to them.

Singles 80-85,Duran Duran,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3aeb335119a49ec994/1:1/w_160/2983e3d7.gif,2003-07-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2486-singles-80-85/,Capitol,"Join me as I machete through the thick, sweaty greenery of an undisclosed tropical setting. I am alone, the rest of my party having retreated at the sight of some mysterious statues we uncovered about three clicks back. I move faster unassisted. Pressing through the bush, I stumble upon a yawning blackness, the open maw of a darkened cave. The weak canopy-filtered light penetrates not more than a few feet inside. I pause to check a worn parchment map, remove my panama hat, and wipe the sweat from my brow. I am Harrison Ford, I am Brendan Fraser, I am... well, I'm Simon LeBon. Let's talk metaphors here, people. The treasure I'm looking to rescue is the street cred of Duran Duran as an influence. And the almost certainly booby-trap-filled cave possessing it: the prison of VH1 docu-nugget kitsch. Oh sure, right now Duran Duran are on the sunny side of the retro carousel, what with The Faint gothing up their sound, The Rapture channeling their spirit through ""Sister Savior,"" and !!! apprenticing at their art of the ass-shake. And yet, as the fickle gears turn, it's virtually guaranteed we'll once again find ourselves in an era of overt synthophobia, and Duran Duran will once again be relegated to punchline status. While Duran Duran is probably the first band to come to most anyone's mind when synth-pop is the topic of discussion, such an honor has both positive and (usually) negative connotations. To lump them in with the dated remnants of the Vice City crowd is a bit unfair, however; unlike the Korg-heavy environs of peers Frankie Goes to Hollywood and A Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran didn't lean so heavily on the keyboard technology of the day. Rather, they created a unique casserole of club influences, disco basslines, pop-crossover melodies, and frontman charisma that, in an ideal world, would be utterly fad-resistant. This new box set containing the group's early singles is not the most convincing evidence around for this thesis, what with the band's masterpiece Rio being about as tight a bundle of premium synth-pop as this world has ever seen. Nor is it exactly the most concise way of proving my point to a newbie, weighing in as it does at a hefty baker's dozen of discs. But with each single only comprising three or four songs, filling out the headliner with a B-side and a dance mix or two, the set is only a Bond theme over a mere three hours' length, and distilled to its key moments, it stands as a more-than-worthy companion to the band's essential first phase. In terms of A-sides, the box contains almost all the true essentials, cutting it off before the adult contemporary pandering and lineup changes. The band's more dance-derived debut LP lends the catwalk struts ""Planet Earth"" and ""Girls on Film"", but it's the early single version of Rio's ""My Own Way"" that steals the show, full of uptempo disco strings like Saturday Night Fever in fast-forward. Rio, of course, was where it all came together, and singles don't come much stronger than ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" or the album's title track. Both proudly show off how Duran Duran was a band, not just a synthesizer: ""Wolf"" threads bubbly keys around a slashing guitar riff; ""Rio"" drops a surprisingly hard funk groove behind one of the few times a saxophone solo (as confusingly ubiquitous in the 80s as Mr. T) actually worked. By the time we reach Seven and the Ragged Tiger, the Taylor trio + 2 had cooled off their hot streak a bit, with only ""The Reflex"" living up to their peak. ""The Wild Boys"" resides infamously as the only truly bad A-side of the thirteen, LeBon straining so hard to express just how wild these boys are that his voice outreaches its range. Fortunately, the finale is reserved for ""A View to a Kill"", one of the better Bond songs of the Moore years, where the group chops up the fanfare of John Barry's score in a (dare I say it?) glitch-type manner. The assorted dance mixes included are also a perk, excising the majority of the vocals and stretching out the songs to the six-to-eight-minute mark. Most accomplish this through simply slowing unfolding the instrumental elements, allowing one to appreciate the gospel choir of ""Union of the Snake"" or the hexagonal drumpads of ""Is There Something I Should Know?"" independent of their formerly busy surroundings. Not too many of the mixes turn out significantly more danceable than the originals-- in fact, some are so busy showing off the song's inner machinery that they're less likely to get the floor crowded, but in sounding a whole heck of a lot like Out Hud, they'll still be greatly appreciated by today's community of laptop jockeys. Still with me? 'Cause there are B-sides to discuss as well, though some (""Secret Oktober"", a weak cover of ""Fame"") were better off forgotten. A strange mulligan of Rio's bizarre sapphire-bullet synth closer ""The Chauffeur"" recasts the song as an unplugged Flamenco number, while a live take on UK cult hit ""Make Me Smile"" seems to be included just to show off the band's ability to attract screaming girls circa 1984. ""Like an Angel"" and ""Faith in this Colour"" are the real archeological finds, though, the first a midtempo predecessor to ""Lonely in Your Nightmare"", the second instrumental ""Rockit"" electro begging to be sampled. Halting the collection at the point when the lineup underwent its first of many changes has the unfortunate side effect of locking out ""Notorious"", but it's a tough-but-fair tradeoff for a set that ignores the group's VH1-friendly incarnation, unlike the other hits collections available. There's also no denying the thirteen discs of Singles 80-85 are, in true 80s style, a bit on the excessive side, but the intensity and depth of focus on the band's most critical years is a welcome supplement to the LPs in arguing the band's eternal relevance beyond video innovation. And if digging into these 12"" artifacts still leaves you unconvinced that Duran Duran were standard bearers for an untapped well of danceable rock, I'll just have to turn over some tables in slow motion, LeBon-style, and dance into the fire while you sit and mope.","Join me as I machete through the thick, sweaty greenery of an undisclosed tropical setting.

Get Well Soon,The Starvations,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a554ea9e61561daa50f5/1:1/w_160/45a27e63.jpg,2003-06-30 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7483-get-well-soon/,GSL,"Gabriel Hart, vocalist of L.A. five-piece The Starvations, seems to me to be an older, broken and seedy Conor Oberst supplement for kids who grew up reading used copies of The Flowers of Evil and water-damaged library books by Hubert Selby, Jr. If all the addictions Hart sings about on this record are true, he isn't the precocious poet you'd want to bring home to ma because he could drop dead any second; if he's invented this stuff then he's chosen a more detailed terrain than the oft-times preciously obtuse Oberst, more a writer of pretty words than a chronicler of any generation. On Get Well Soon, The Starvations' second full-length, instead of moralizing tales of a girl who cries when she plays violin, we have a guy realizing he just murdered someone in a drunken haze and a fuck-up leaning on a girl's doorbell for two days until he passes out in his car: ""You tripled your dosage, washed it down with some rum, you ate all your candy and refused to leave me some. Oh you are a shining star, hanging in a sky of tar."" Basically: catchy bits about boys who love girls who love drugs who love no one. The words I've read thus far about The Starvations compare Hart to Jeffrey Lee Pierce of The Gun Club, who died from a blood clot in his brain while visiting his pops in Utah. I get the comparison, but Hart has more of Oberst's built-in quavering tremolo than Pierce's cool when he shouts and wheezes like a dyspeptic drama major about houses of love built of crumbling sand. Mix in Robert Smith (Hart even has Smith's spidery hair) and John Doe's beat stuff, then back our broken troubadour with The Bad Seeds, The Pogues, or 16 Horsepower and you're getting closer to the soul of this scruffy-ass stuff. I like Hart's subject matter, his hobo appearance, and his ""Skulls"" vocal patterning, but his work isn't perfect. Succumbing at times to lyrical fluffiness, he strings together stock images of damage without giving these moments three-dimensionality. Because not all of the lyrics gel beyond general claims about being high and sad, a number of the songs are similar and the constant onslaught of rebel bard gets tiring. For example, ""An American Funeral"" begs for a less ceremonious death, telling loved ones to avoiding paying to an embalmer-- to save money for a shrink-- promising ""my body's well preserved with all the alcohol I drink."" Ho hum? Nick Cave's always been good at detailed storytelling, as are Tom Waits and, yeah, Jeffrey Lee Pierce. Nope, my generation has yet to unearth its Leonard Cohen. (I'd even say Oberst can be a better storyteller, especially in those tales of his brother drowning without a name, but the stuff still reeks of the sad singer playing tragic.) Like The Pogues, The Starvations are a bar band in the best sense of the term: semi-accurate sods kicking up a bluesy dust around loosely tight songs about the underbelly of the city. There's enough personality in the band's decaying rock arsenal to keep you glued to the crumbling stage for at least a chunk of their rag-tag set, just not enough to inspire you to leave a tear in your beer or bring their CD home to your depressing apartment.","Gabriel Hart, vocalist of L.A. five-piece The Starvations, seems to me to be an older, broken and seedy Conor ...

Soft Spot,Clem Snide,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f2ea9e61561daa5260/1:1/w_160/41132e5a.jpg,2003-06-30 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1499-soft-spot/,spinART,"Fresh from winning the PEN memoir award, the narcoleptically self-editing Rick Moody published a piece about Magnetic Fields fandom in the new and impressive McSweeney's spinoff The Believer which contained a typically lazy and hyperbolic sentence about his stint opening for the band: ""There is nothing harder than trying to bring fiction, literature, words, to the mass audience, even as refined an audience as the one that comes to a Magnetic Fields gig."" Bullshanks! I and my syphilitic manservant can think of 1.3 million things more difficult than being paid to blather one's sub-lofty scribing in the Beirutian gauntlet that is Some Metropole's rock club. Yet: a vulnerable cluster of my unplucked heartstrings can sympathize with the Moody Fucker (s'a fantastic Lambchop song, download it posthaste), for I have spent a week being all downcast about the suckiness of Clem Snide's Soft Spot, as if my no-eye-contact-making doctor had told me I'd developed lymphoma of the haircut. ""What's the matter with you?"" my chums ask as I sulk and mix vodka and gin to create godka. ""The new Clem Snide ain't no good,"" I reply more morbidly than when I read about the Iraqi family killed trying to put out fires in a wheat field that set by Amer'kin flares. O, how fake tragedies abound in our leisure federation. During the poet Walt Whitman's autopsy, a lab worker Frankensteinly dropped his brain on his floor, kersplatting it. Sometime during the birth of Clem Snide frontman Eef Barzelay's son, Eef's brain similarly slid from its post and into history's chumbucket. The once-clever-and-cleverer songwriter has somehow become a saptician on par with John Denver. Let's let ""Fontanelle"" speak for itself: ""May the sun always shine on you/ And each day feel so bright and new/ And may god hold you in the palm of his hand/ May the moon always light your way/ And love be forever here to stay/ And may God..."" and then the palm thing again. Is this kind of devolution hormonal? Can't a savvy rocker tiptoe onto the frontier of marriage and family without becoming a Mormon? Here's more syrup, from (hack) ""Every Moment"": ""Everything that lives will someday die/ But our love still grows/ Because every moment must make way for one that's new/ Before it does, remember I love you."" Please, Eef, don't hurt 'em! For a response to Mr. Barzelay's epiphany that mortals die and that time passes, I'll cite a reviewer of Albert Camus' similarly obvious novel The Fall: ""One might define stupidity as the state of needing to be told this."" Soft Spot lacks all that was adventurous/ponderous about Snide's last mega-durable outing The Ghost of Fashion. The guitar melodies severely underplink their goal of conveying moist nuggets of enlightened bliss. Jason Glasser goes gymkata with the multi-instrumentalism, frontloading this pace-challenged album with bells and strings and bloops that suggest ""subtle interplay"" but ultimately register as a kind of overcompensation for the lack of gripping songcraft. The scattershot laptop scrackle connotes a Yankee Timeshare Foxtrot. Nothing here stakes a claim on the listener's hungry memory with the fury of Ghost's domestic violence vow ""Don't Be Afraid of Your Anger"" or the ironist anthem ""No One's More Happy Than You"". Like an NBC-sitcom-theme-spewing doppelganger of John Cusack, Barzelay openly cites Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and Smog as his fave contemporary influences (Ghost's ""Curse of Great Beauty"" all but presages Oldham's ""Careless Love""), yet he over-relies on the preciousness of his sexy-Kermit vocals to carry unrigorous, sentimental lyrics. The Rembrandts drums and E Street guitar tone of ""Happy Birthday"" are atrociously cubicle-friendly, ruining the song's choice line about Eef wishing his son's girlfriends ""wear tight pants."" Does this band really plan to tour to support this Hallmark bore? When will Eef resume his old wordplay, or even his wail? I'd rather he go back to wearing his frontal lobe on his sleeve, and interchange ""officer"" and ""orifice,"" or point out how ""embargo"" backwards is ""o grab me."" On the album The Known Unsoldier: Sick of Waging War, Sage Francis raps a supreme diss about someone's album being so bad that the whole thing should have been a hidden bonus track. The slam applies to Soft Spot, which at best begs to be a fan-club download, since it offers so little to anyone not Eef's bride or offspring. ""We'll soon make memories of things to come/ Time will pass."" Tell me about it. The future is tomorrow. Peace will come when the fighting stops. Now, I have held a baby, and found it so pacifying and reprioritizing that I dreamt of a world in which an hour of baby-holding was a requirement for troubled inner-city youth, to enforce some foggy notion of life's sanctity. But then I remembered that many inner-city youths have already squirted kids into the world, and they still can't dream beyond the homicidal grudges of their 'hood. So Eef must do more than sing (on ""Close the Door"") about how God made the dust that makes his rugrat sneeze. Soft Spot is sweetly conceived, but bullyingly so, like disgusting birthday-prompted vegan cookies that one feels bound to eat. It thinks its premise is invulnerable, like those Michelin commercials with the babies sitting on the tires that beg the question, ""What? Do you hate babies, you shitassed FREAK?"" Some may praise Eef for letting down his pun-loving, pop-culture-referencing guard, but this attempt at straight-shooting is so artless that I'm filing at as reason #3968 for my lack of faith in upright mammals. ""Let's take off our shoes and dance away the blues"": Bob Seger, Jimmy Buffett, Eef Barzelay... feel the oneness.","Fresh from winning the PEN memoir award, the narcoleptically self-editing Rick Moody published a piece about Magnetic Fields fandom in ...

Trickboxes on the Pony Line,Sin Ropas,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a414c0084474cd0c0403/1:1/w_160/ecf61e4a.jpg,2003-06-30 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7176-trickboxes-on-the-pony-line/,Sad Robot,"John Berger says that the relationship between what we know and what we see is never properly settled. That disconnect can be crushing, especially when it applies to something as inherently conceptual as sound: you know it's just a guitar, but all you see are shadows. Sin Ropas is the brainchild of Tim Hurley (former Red Red Meat bassist and occasional button-pusher for Califone) and Chicago percussionist Danni Iosello. Theoretically, Trickboxes on the Pony Line, Sin Ropas' second full-length, isn't strikingly different from what the ever-splintering and coalescing Red Red Meat collective (see Califone, Loftus, Perishable Records) have been doing since the mid-to-late 1990s-- piling up gobs of drone, acoustic and electric guitars, uncredited machines, the occasional banjo, synths, noiseboxes, throbbing bass, sonorous percussion, unpredictable structures, largely conceptual lyrics, and choruses that may or may not arrive as planned. Genre transcendence suits Sin Ropas, though, and the dark internal cinema of these tracks eclipses, both texturally and atmospherically, nearly all of Hurley's previous work, including Sin Ropas' debut, the fulsome Three Cherries. Trickboxes is thick with doubt and hesitation. Topped by rough, indecipherable vocals and guided by a handful of shifting melodies and odd instrumental coups, it's hard to establish a stanch reference point for any of the album's eight cagey tracks; the perpetual puzzle is part of what makes this record so endlessly intriguing. Put it on and point yourself toward new, more dynamic modes of aural interpretation, shit that has far less to do with mechanically processing a series of notes than with establishing abstract, pre-linguistic relationships with art. Get that the process, like the music, is awkward and uneasy. Tug your stereo outside, curl up in the grass, and chew on some crushed ice. There's gonna be poetry in the grasping. And it will be devastatingly good. ""Hands Aside"" opens with a sequence of neo-natal e-bow squeaks-- each high, sinewy whine promptly gives way to aching bass and heavily distorted electric guitar. Bulky and exhausted, the track packs a limp chorus (almost irrelevantly vague, with a half-rousing faux-holler) and a strained apathy reminiscent of Nirvana or pre-splits Beck. But Sin Ropas have a near-supernatural instinct for punch-in-the-gut timing, and there are a handful of perfectly positioned notes and chords that can switch your bloodflow with a single missed beat. The band refuses to break mood by taking a deliberate roll out of the song, and ""Butter on Cane"" slides in behind ""Hands"" unknowingly, as Hurley and Iosello slip unceremoniously into a Dirty Three-ish violin melody, quietly scraping over a slow, rhythmic foundation of skittish snare drum and guitar drone-gone-madman-noodling. Inspiration works the right way for Hurley and Iosello: bits of folk and blues are thread together with a logic that synthesizes (but never imitates) historically proven rock and roll birthrights, delivering something both intensely modern and blissfully weird. ""Floorboards"" is a tragic lurch, loaded down with achy, wavering blues guitar that, in the context of the song's ""dirty Christian"" lyrics and hazy production, sounds entirely newborn; ""Buried with the Footmen"" sees Hurley's voice and guitar clawing each other for attention, pipes finally overtaking the fuzz, Hurley's voice crawling into an onerous, devastating falsetto. Trickboxes on the Pony Line's abstract song-movies rely heavily on a series of unfixed, user-provided images-- pictures replace sounds, sensations supplant rationalizations, everything goes a little blurry. Push your fists into your eyes and let the lights come up: what you see on screen is yours. The rest is just guitar.","John Berger says that the relationship between what we know and what we see is never properly settled. That disconnect ...

Welcome to Magnetic Park. We've just finished drawing the pentagram in goat's blood on the floor and we're almost ready to conjure up the seventh level. What? Just a ""door-to-door encyclopedia salesman,"" huh? Well, there'll be no need for encyclopedias where we're going, but I'm afraid you've already seen too much for us to simply let you leave... alive! OH, I'm kidding. Relax. You'll only have to stay until the ceremony is complete, at which point you'll hopefully be a true believer like the rest of us. Now please put this cloak on, say a prayer to the severed head, and prepare your body for the fluid of the infants. Let me just introduce everyone, then. Those two around the black ring of fire, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, are the originators of this sacred music and ceremony you are about to experience, Sunn O)))'s White1. The individual resting on the mystical stool of the beheaded is Rex Ritter, formerly of such cults as Fontanelle and Jessamine, and to his right is Joe Preston, of Earth and The Melvins, who prepares the accompanying drum machines to our din of sin. The one awash in his own feces is Julian Cope. He'll be regaling us with one of his famous odes this evening, and hopefully making his exit shortly thereafter. Between you, me, and the skinned bunny rabbits, he sort of gives everyone here the creeps. It has begun. Since you are new to the ceremony, I will walk you through the dark and deafening sounds your aura will soon be cleansed with. The music currently loosening your bowels is the obstinate bass feedback the group is known for in this community. It serves as the breaker upon which the guitar tremolos crash, giving the duo their distinctive and brooding sound. Julian arises now to begin his exercise in theatric word painting, ""My Wall"". It's really quite enjoyable to listen to, and even more fun to recite once one gets past the coquettish nature with which he refers to Anderson and O'Malley. The key to deciphering Cope's abstract speech can be found in the line, ""My wall, my wall, caught beneath the thrall of my wall,"" referring to both the weight of the song and his faux-epitaph-- ""here be the wall of Johnny Guitar."" Ready? Repeat after me, ""Old mother-fucker, she was a cock-sucker."" Isn't he a lyrical genius? And now begins the instrumental outpour. Be sure and pay attention to how the tonal washes of the electric strings continue to lull you into a false security while the occasional crashes harshly bring you back to the reality of your knocking knees. Don't be frightened, that's only Runhild Gammelsaeter of Thorr's Hammer fame. She marks the beginning of ""The Gates of Ballard"" portion of the rite by rising from the throne of discarded headcheese. Her chant serves as the high-end compliment to the single rising tone of instrumentation. The strong bass kicks in, stalls, and eventually progresses into a rhythm outfitted by a programmed drum, courtesy of Ritter. This atmosphere is explored off and on for the remainder of the song, until it eventually gives way to ""A Shaving of the Horn That Spared You"". This ""Shaving of the Horn"" track is meant to explore the more experimental yearnings of the dark Lord that oversees all such doom metal. It pulses at times like a Stockhausen-directed helicopter, with hissing and popping that's occasionally cut by angular guitar noises. The humming you hear is meant to provide an accented beauty to the harsh sounds and effects that O'Malley and Anderson usher forth from their instruments. The truly remarkable moment has not yet come upon us, though. Be patient, you will see. AH! THE HUMMING HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A GNARLED AND UGLY GROWL! ALL THINGS ONCE CONSIDERED STUNNING AND ATTRACTIVE ARE NOW PEPPER TO YOUR EYES UPON BEARING WITNESS TO THE POWER OF THE SATANIC DRONE! HEY! Where you going? Don't leave yet!

Young Miss America,Gold Chains,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf56eb335119a49ed1e7/1:1/w_160/1ac5e08a.jpg,2003-06-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3496-young-miss-america/,PIAS,"Topher Lafata, perhaps informed by an adolescence of Black Flag shows and slamdancing in his suburban Pennsylvania bedroom, is coming at this whole ""authenticity"" thing from a strange angle. Rather than play up his ""hardships"" or overcompensate for a lack of ghetto wisdom, he gets by on sheer geekiness and neon indie funk. That isn't to say Gold Chains should retreat back to the server room, because when in doubt, he's more likely to lapse into sub Sir Mix-A-Lot machinegun flow than drain a beat with glitchy, crystalline tomfoolery. To hear him tell it, the world revolves around only so many things, and it's probably a good thing he doesn't list race among them, as it wouldn't advance his cause very far anyway. The long and short of Gold Chains is wrapped up in insular, detail-oriented aggression and a recurring love/hate relationship with cash money. Don't look for hard cred where it doesn't exist; he's just good, clean fun. Even more than fun, Lafata gets close to home on your ass-- especially if you're a young white male with time to burn. Throughout Young Miss America, his debut long-player, he laments love lost over material and the fear of a life left empty over the pursuits of money and watching the strippers glisten in the sun. ""Citizens Nowhere, what do you want?"" he asks his constituency of desperately bored, vaguely ambitious turks. Let him be more specific: ""What do you want from me?"" He makes this inquiry in ""Let's Get It On"", in which the Gold Chains position is made perfectly clear. Never mind that he brings in an actual female to testify that it ain't all about the cold-hard, this stuff will hit you hardest if you either believe everything he says (not likely), or dig the hooks. This album has hundreds of hooks, and I think that's Lafata's way of revealing which of his own personal philosophies he holds the most stock in. Gold Chains turns out beats okay, but his tunes might grab your post-production fancy-- I counted not less than six complete backing track plan-Bs before the chorus on the album's opener, ""Code Red"". Impressively, he manages to pull these tricks out of a largely sample-free bag, though what he gains by way of a fairly unique sound he often gives right back via arcade-goof organ patches and ill-advised lapses into electro-pop when it seems he should be turning up the bass. Lafata boasts a ""record with no filler,"" and maybe he's going for the indie kids who don't buy the high BPMs, but when ""Several Times Defined"" busts of the gate with Farfisa and squeaky clean go-go beats, I get the impression I'm not supposed to be laughing at this. Similarly, ""The Game"" hits the razor-sharp jazz piano in all the right places, but lines like, ""I just felt some magic, girl, and I think I just might be your type,"" don't seem like they'd go well over pogo stick, stop-time two-step. And they don't. Things get a lot more interesting when Lafata brings out the real guns, as on the Spaghetti Western-informed, dancehall romp of ""Nada"". His voice is naturally brutish, so when his ideas and arrangements are kept in focus, the Gold Chains growl gathers no moss-- in addition to making his occasionally affected Jamaican accent much easier to take. This tune volleys from slow-burn riddim mange to pretty convincing cinematic grandeur (check those cymbal crashes, John Williams), but when ""I.O.U. becomes 'you owe me'"" it's the beats and Lafata's persistence that sell his already amply stated warnings against greed. He even manages to stay funky for more than one verse at a time on ""Revolution"", though that he's stealing chord progressions from The Art of Noise probably says more about the record than anything. Still, get this man a remix gig for Justin Timberlake, stat. Moments here suggest Gold Chains could be really dangerous should he one day choose the big picture over the instant gratification of a thousand new directions. It's not as if Young Miss America is a necessarily incoherent experience-- and it certainly sounds like something aimed for parties (as opposed to, say, music for computer programming). In fact, his most endearing moments, such as the trashcan suave ""Break or Be Broken"" (imagine Louis Prima recast as an MC in heat), point to a future as either a very entertaining DJ, or the between-girl entertainment at Big Daddy's XXX. One part Busta-lite, and the rest full-on skater bravado: Gold Chains isn't going to tear up the world of hip-hop, but he's not totally empty handed.","Topher Lafata, perhaps informed by an adolescence of Black Flag shows and slamdancing in his suburban Pennsylvania bedroom, is coming ...

20: Singles and EPs '94-'96,Gorky's Zygotic Mynci,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf7bc0084474cd0c3040/1:1/w_160/1f8091fc.jpg,2003-06-29 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3530-20-singles-and-eps-94-96/,Castle,"Whether naming songs after Soft Machine singers as a teenager or riding into the friscalating dusklight in Gene Clark's chaps in his mid-twenties, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci leader Euros Childs has always seemed older than his years. Even when he was yelping like a poodle, on 1999's Spanish Dance Troupe, his playfulness was offset by mournful songs about mortality. Having already stumbled through a period of summery should've-been hits, he's moving on to works of low-key genius, but Childs-- still only 28-- seems destined to be one of the more underappreciated artists of our time. Recent converts to Gorky's charm can catch up with the band's whimsical, wide-eyed folk-psych days with the recently released (and laboriously titled) 20: Singles and EP's '94-'96. This collection of four EPs and two singles-- first pieced together for the Brit completists-- picks up two years after the band debuted on the Welsh label Anskt, which was also the embryonic home of fellow countrymen Super Furry Animals. Presented in chronological order, it traces GZM's development from passable 70s garage rockers to mischievous alchemists with a sharp command of melody and harmony, ending just shy of their 1997 album Barafundle, the peak of their pop-pysch-prog phase. When these EPs were originally released, the British press focused on everything about Gorky's except their music: their nationality/language, youth, then-out-of-step influences (Canterbury folk, the Beach Boys, Incredible String Band), and their distinctively heinous cover art. Gorky's were painted as your little brother's band, a playful diversion for those who hadn't yet grown into Serious Music like, uh, Cast. Skipping the fetish for fogeyism shared by many of their mid-'90s contemporaries, Gorky's purveyed willful eclecticism in the years compiled here, creating playful, offbeat songs full of odd time signatures, and the occasionally unfortunate youthful indulgence. The everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to their music-- trombone, slide, Hammond, nylon guitar, and Moog are all used on occasion, but never gratuitously-- extended to Childs occasionally swapping the then-favored Welsh for English, sometimes in the course of one song. Whether courting humor on ""The Game of Eyes"" or displaying an early facility for pastoralism on ""Pentref Wrth Y Mor"", Gorky's eager early approach to genre blending makes sometimes-ponderous genres like prog, psych, and folk seem infectious and spontaneous. Although half of these songs appeared on the U.S.-only 1996 compilation Introducing Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, there are still enough reasons for anyone who owns that disc to pick up 20, and none better than ""Heart of Kentucky"", from the Ambler Gambler EP. The Western pastiche starts with comedic vocals before it inexplicably takes off on a Krautock jaunt toward the horizon, sounding like the theme to some Sauerkraut Western. Only a few years removed from making home recordings, these were still bedroom tapes-- limited releases for a limited audience-- but ideas like the self-explanatory ""12 Explanatory Soundscapes""-- which isn't nearly as drip-dry as its title suggests-- are expansive. Locked away from the public eye, working continually with the same sympathetic production and engineering team (Alan Holmes and Gorwel Owen), Gorky's formative impulses and giddy, unpredictable approach to songwriting yielded a wealth of rich material in the mid-90s, and they've selected the very best for 20.","Whether naming songs after Soft Machine singers as a teenager or riding into the friscalating dusklight in Gene Clark's ...

De-Loused in the Comatorium,The Mars Volta,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3baeb335119a49ed79f/1:1/w_160/e7970eb5.jpg,2003-06-29 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5117-de-loused-in-the-comatorium/,InterscopeStrummer,"When Mars Volta member Jeremy Ward died shortly before the release of their debut album, some heartlessly snickered about the relevance of a ""sound manipulator"" passing on. After all, it's not like the guy was playing a guitar or bass, right? But after forging numerous times through the dense De-Loused in the Comatorium, the severity of the loss screams blatantly; The Mars Volta focus most of their energy on sound manipulation. Watery vocals, phased synths, reverbed guitars, reversed bongos, and countless other dub twiddlings drench each busy, triathlon-long song. Ward is the second person close to The Mars Volta who has died. Julio Venegas, a close friend of the band's, committed suicide in 1996, and as the media has repeatedly pointed out, De-Loused in the Comatorium is supposed to be a chronicle of his life and death. This is a monumental case of the media blindly reviewing off their press kits-- there's absolutely no way of gleaning this story/idea/topic/concept/whatever in the hilariously awful, sub-Burroughs, refrigerator-magnet montage of dark PSAT words that make up this album. The song titles-- ""Drunkship of Lanterns"", ""Televators"", ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt""-- merely hint at Comatorium's purblind ""poetry."" Follow Venegas' footsteps as he makes his ""ritual contrition asphyxiation half mast commute through umbilical blisters and boxcar cadavers!""* Weep while he's ""rowing shit smells for the dead""* before the ""pinkeye fountain""* and ""three half-eaten corneas!""* At least I think that's what happened. The only sensible summation of Venegas' demise seems to be that he proclaimed, ""Now I'm lost,"" then ""searched"" for ""something"" for a ""long time,"" then cried ""Is anybody there,"" and finally ""took"" the ol' ""veil cerpin taxt."" Huh. Reprinting these lyrics in the liner notes might have helped to clarify the story, but that could as easily have ruined the experience-- dissecting the cryptic babble is half (or more) of the fun. These lyrics, like At the Drive In's before them, are pure stream-of-consciousness. Only now they're delivered in a Geddy Lee castrato, treading helplessly in a tumultuous Great Lake of unplotted neo-prog. ""Inertiatic ESP"", Comatorium's first real song, stands out as the only memorable track, probably due to its succinct, 4\xBD-minute runtime. Afterward, every song follows a pattern: roar out of the gate with the main riff, stop suddenly, float in reverby space where one can hear the smoke machines and laser shows, bring back the opening riff with added guitars noodling away, slurp up the noise in a sucking sound, hit the pachanga 'n' guitar solo movement, slowly fade in a swarm of dub effects, and, BAM, repeat step one. Think of a San Diego hardcore band. Think of ALL of the San Diego hardcore bands at once whipping through ELP's ""Karn Evil 9"" without practice. The Mars Volta mistake sonic piling for complex architecture. No melodic themes are carried. Often you'll find yourself lost in a epic passage of dripping noises (""Cicatrix ESP"") or a robotic bleepdown (""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"") where the song even forgets itself, before the opening riff and chorus blare back in an ""oh, right, this one"" kind of way. Even acoustic interludes, like the one during the opening of ""This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed"", can't pass without Amazon bird recordings and distant e-bow. Rick Rubin has produced masterfully before-- from the surging density of Slayer's Reign in Blood, to the clean funk of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to the crisp acoustics of Johnny Cash's American recordings. Here, he's been asked to mix all of the above with added jam aplomb. He must have felt like John Cage telling his disgruntled punk grandsons to ""do whatever."" Some editing and afterthought would have gone a long way. Each song sounds like if Led Zeppelin had released the 25:25 version of ""Dazed and Confused"" off How the West Was Won instead of the concise 6:26 cut on their debut. De-Loused in the Comatorium will undoubtedly rekindle prog, or at least spur a reassessment of the genre. Somewhere, kids will proclaim The Mars Volta to sound like Fugazi's End Hits mixed with The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (which it sort of does)-- the Comatorium title ""Eriatarka"" even sounds like Spanish for ""Aquatarkus""-- but few will confess to actually liking Genesis or ELP. Though The Mars Volta may be prog in the traditional sense, they're in no way ""progressive,"" just as The Hives do not record their music in a ""garage."" So it boils down to whether you're one to cherish the originals, keep up with the newbies, or forsake it all as fustian garbage. The other band often evoked in The Mars Volta press is Santana. That's just offensive. Omar and Cedric's last names are Rodriguez-Lopez and Zavala, right? They use bongos? They must sound like Santana! That's like comparing Living Colour's Stain to Love's Forever Changes. The percussive break on ""Drunkship of Lanterns"" just as shallowly traces back to the Miami Sound Machine. If any, the album constantly recalled during Comatorium listens is Mansun's 1998 sprawl, Six. The seagull-screaming guitar solos on ""Roulette Dares"" mimic Dominic Chad's playing on tracks like ""Negative"" and ""Shotgun"". The magic-trick studio transitions sound eerily similar on both records. Mansun even shared The Mars Volta's goal of fusing punk and prog. The difference: Mansun realized the entertaining bridge between the two is glam-rock. It's a preposterous fusion to begin with, since both genres were originally seen as reactions to one another (see: Johnny Rotten's t-shirts), and Mansun barely pulled it off with knowing camp; The Mars Volta just straddle the chasm on a cracking rope woven of dour attitude, showers of effects, and Latin percussion. My biggest complaint is that De-Loused in the Comatorium just isn't fun. Virtuosity-to-a-fault was the death of prog in the 70s, but The Mars Volta's aimless hammer-and-wail tactics-- whether performed with deep-seeded passion or not-- is just as regrettable. This record bursts with vim and accelerates breathtakingly. Audiophiles will sop both sides of the headphones for the additive-laden gravy of sounds. Cedric and Omar play with such intensity and soul. What they lack is any ability to convey where their passion comes from, either lyrically and musically. As such, De-Loused in the Comatorium swirls around as a galaxy of inexplicable sturm and angst. If they can find ways to deliver this music convincingly and lucidly to their listeners, The Mars Volta might be on to something.","When Mars Volta member Jeremy Ward died shortly before the release of their debut album, some heartlessly\n\ snickered about ...

Lines Are Infinitely Fine,Paradise Island,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fecb1335d7bf1697edd/1:1/w_160/06cd10de.jpg,2003-06-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6163-lines-are-infinitely-fine/,Dim Mak,"Jenny Hoyston's one-woman ""band"" Paradise Island is less angularly wound than Erase Errata, the jagged San Francisco no-wave group she otherwise fronts. This newer, non-rock free-flow nom de plume ostensibly exists for Hoyston to explore unchartered, unhinged experimentation, but considering Erase Errata's substantially jarring aesthetic, Paradise Island's unadventurous pillaging of obvious tropes is only ""experimental"" relative to her more widely known band. Much like the additive and unnecessary bleeps and buzzes on the Erase Errata remix record Dancing Machine, Lines Are Infinitely Fine's briefly considered sound nuggets feel like simple ideas augmented, rather than focused finalities. More detrimental to the project, though, is the lack of joy it evokes. A brief segue: I used to work for a minimalist violin player who was really into island music. He'd play his guitar along to it, or we'd loop a record and make feedback while folks hit steel drums behind us. It was celebratory, full of emotion. We kept our droning luau to ourselves, but tried building a bridge between the discord of the one layer and the lush green expanse of the other. With these memories in mind, I'm not sure I understand Hoyston's project. Where's paradise here? She plays these middle-of-the-road fragments in the most distanced and perfunctory manner. The record's lack of an interiority reminds me of Raymond Queneau's Exercises In Style, a book that systematically plows through conceits, tense shifts, genres, voices, and of course styles, rewriting the same two-paragraphs 99 times. In a similar way, the twelve tracks on Lines Are Infinitely Fine come off like examples of particular approaches, not real-life compositions. Despite what the overload of dorks with contact mikes might tell you, successful experimental music is more difficult to make than it sounds. If there isn't enough foresight, even the briefest of works can seem like an eternity. This happens too often here. Lines Are Infinitely Fine isn't horrible: it's aggravatingly undistinguished. I was hoping for a warped summertime glare or an odd re-take on Hawaiian standards, but instead this sounds like the bored outpourings of an underground indie-rock cynic. ""Mind Wash""-- the aural equivalent of a slip-n-slide-- sounds like the late-night outcome of someone who just purchased their first delay pedal and still finds it novel to drop words into a mixer, vaguely giddy over the echoey shadows they return. ""Sunrise A Spectacle"" has a vocal patterning redolent of Tattle Tale, minus the histrionics. I hate to pull out the tired comparison, but I'm also reminded of Kathleen Hannah's Julie Ruin talking about crochet. ""I Came 2 Party"" is the requisite, thinly produced faux dance number complete with pitch-shifted voice (the underground's fixation on popular dance music is fine and dandy, but come on, even Pink is more interesting than this). ""Try and Leave"" somehow reminds me of the haphazard distractions of Smack Dab, a quirky early 90s band fronted by a woman with an insanely twee voice. ""Float on a Flower"" is one of the more upbeat tracks, a follow-up to ""Mind Wash"" with its broken balloon CASIO orchestrations. ""Monster Boogie (Outrageous Dance)"" originally appeared on the Get Up EP released just a couple of months ago and it's the only track that feels complete with it's alluring, distant vocals. The final untitled composition is a more lethargic version of \x93Deprogram\x94-- also from the Get Up EP; strangely, the one song not included from Get Up is its title track, and it's the best thing Paradise Island's done thus far. The oddly paced ukulele twangs in that one rang out like the the Carter Family caught in a dust storm. I like the concept. I dig the lushly-penned cover art, the rainbow explosions launching from an ink drawing of Hoyston as butterfly (or dragonfly). Inside the CD is the handwritten statement: ""Paradise Island is a real place that you can go to right now,"" but beyond the artwork, I'm not sure why we'd want to chill there. Hoyston offers slight treasures-- a few worth holding towards the sun, glimmering momentarily-- but for the most her part meandering palette is too empty, creating a geographic cipher hardly worth the visit. I felt stranded.","Jenny Hoyston's one-woman ""band"" Paradise Island is less angularly wound than Erase Errata, the jagged San Francisco no-wave group ...

One Step More and You Die,Mono,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a35e6ef95969323893/1:1/w_160/55eaa823.jpg,2003-06-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5403-one-step-more-and-you-die/,Arena Rock,"Listening to One Step More and You Die by Japanese quartet Mono, I'm trying to figure out if we're on the verge of a post-rock revival or if the stuff just never went away. Everything about this record feels very 1998, a time when a thousand bands who listened to a lot of Spiderland decided to forego vocals and make variable instrumental density the primary songwriting device. Mono formed in 2000, so the timing in terms of post-rock influence seems about right. One Step More and You Die is their second album, after debuting in 2001 with Under the Pipal Tree on Tzadik. Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, we've heard it before, but at least Mono apes the best from the era, capturing the crucial drama. Mogwai, for example, completely lost me with Come On Die Young, one of the dullest albums I've ever owned. But I've always liked Young Team, and it's those sort of soft/loud, tap/crunch dichotomies that Mono plays with here. When the guitars kick in, they really kick in, with bassy clipping and heavy metal thunder. Nowhere is this more evident than on ""Com(?)"", a 15-minute track that could almost be titled ""Mono Fear Satan"". ""Com(?)"", unfortunately, never aims for near that level of poignancy, and the central riff is more a stomping power chord than Mogwai's elegant glide, but the structure with which Mono explores the hypnotic possibility of a single riff is quite close in spirit to the beloved classic. In keeping with their genre's tradition, Mono incorporate occasional strings and glockenspiel to add delicacy to the simple, minimalist melodies destined to be pounded into the ground by dueling guitars. Only the longer tracks use extreme dynamics, though. ""Mopish Morning, Halation Whisper"" sounds like an interlude off the first Godspeed album, with violin and piano wobbling at variable speed mixed with a bit of vinyl crackle. More Godspeedisms can be found on ""A Speeding Car"", which makes heavy use of the Slow Riot-era technique of having the band repeat a single progression over and over as the lead guitar is strummed on madly on upper-register chords to evoke a cry. These obvious references to other bands don't erase the fact that Mono are pretty good at what they do. The guitar melodies, though simple and repetitive, are catchy enough, and Mono have a good feel for tension and release. I feel like deep down this band wants to be louder and heavier, though, because the noisiest moments on One Step More and You Die are most convincing. There's a point in ""Com(?)"" where the track is at its peak and the tape seems completely saturated and then, from nowhere, an additional screaming sheet of feedback comes in and you think, ""Ah, so that wasn't really so loud before. This is loud!"" Whereas the quieter, twining guitar bits seem much more common. Still, the occasional dull patch aside, One Step More and You Die should scratch that '98 post-rocking itch.","Listening to One Step More and You Die by Japanese quartet Mono, I'm trying to figure out if we ...

A Slow Messe,Molasses,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38beb335119a49ed72f/1:1/w_160/13153087.jpg,2003-06-25 05:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5380-a-slow-messe/,Alien8Fancy,"""...and yer hair's li-ike the shimm'rin' starz o'tha suhn, wit' smails of sniff-sniff gas'line ohn steamin'ot tarmac...thaat I cou-ould ahl buht g't laust in'yer lush-ess bewb-ees and asz. I'mis yew, pleh-ease com'bak cough tew meh, Juhs-cuh "" I must have grown bored speaking into the tiny recorder, since on later examination the inebriated voice on the tape fades into the distance, replaced by the ambient sound of a television and the kitchen clatter of falling pans and boiling water. My syrupy Southern-drawl had been triggered that evening by a cathartic binge-drinking episode brought about by one of the relatively rare fights and subsequent separations I've had with my long-time girlfriend. Emotionally daft and musically a dork, I knew the only way I was going to win her back was not through mature discussion of our problem, but by making her the world's best mix-tape; the cherry on top of this expert selection of wistful love-and-Jessica themed tracks turned into the above drunken plea for her to come back to me. As much as I wince at my whiny, pathetic voice listening to the tape now-- having recently re-discovered it at the bottom of a storage bin in our apartment-- I can only imagine how she must have interpreted my desperate entreaty those many years ago. Scott Chernoff, the vocalist and reluctantly titled bandleader of Molasses, produces music in the same vein as my twilight analog-experiment-- complete with sleeve-worn emotions, found sound collages, and off-key, often dubious lyrics-- except, unlike myself, he has the dual advantages of 1) a modicum of musical talent and 2) the backing of the same Montreal pool of musicians that's spawned Godspeed You! Black Emperor and The Shalabi Effect. Relying on minimally driven pseudo-folk tunes and quasi-gospels, Chernoff has created in A Slow Messe a musical metaphor for the seeming paradox of starving in the land of plenty. Which is to say he had plenty of help: his stable of seven regular musicians and a huge rotating cast of musical fixtures includes Thalia Zedek (Come, Empty House), Chris Brokaw (Codeine, Come), Efrim Menuck (GY!BE, and more than likely that band you had in high school that only survived one practice-- yeah that one), Bruce Cawdron (GY!BE, Set Fire To Flames), David Michael Curry (Willard Grant Conspiracy, Boxhead Ensemble), and J.S. Truchy (Fly Pan Am, Set Fire To Flames). How one album can sport so many guest stars yet manage to hide nearly all evidence of their contributions is a feat in itself, one Chernoff should probably be commended for after he makes proper amends for producing such a glut of uninspired tracks. Not that quantity matters when discussing that which is unwanted-- after all, one bucket of shit would be just as undesirable to find at your doorstep as two-- but the fact that this double album of twenty-six tracks, divided neatly between thirteen vocals and thirteen musical interludes, could leave one with the impression that it will never end is a valid criticism against the venture. Don't get me wrong: I wouldn't disregard ""Delirium Rag"" off-hand just because it's twelve minutes of my life that I'll never get back-- thirty-six if you consider that I listen to every album I review a minimum of three times-- but it's obvious that the ragged formula of these musical collectives is wearing thin. It's no longer amusing or musically clever to follow five minutes of train-station sounds with a husky ballad containing high-pitched lines such as ""We'll all go to heaven through the hole in the floor."" And it's one of their best compositions. The remainder of Slow Messe shuttles back and forth between pretentious snippets of musical money-shots-- the drugged piano of ""Hopeless"", John Cale's European son ""Dans Une Maison Croulante"", and the postponed-bass of ""Reprieve, 15 Julliet""-- and Harry Smith-inspired white-man's blues digging on tracks like ""Silkworm"" and the appropriately titled electric guitar workout, ""White Blues"". Pardoning moments are few and far between, but among them, the high-end screeching of ""Death March (Erskine's Theme)"" does perks one's ears, and the closing track ""Slow Mass"" is pretty enough, with its church-organ dirge and lovely room tone. But these tired, typical modes can't make an album reputably ""mysterious"" anymore, and Molasses are guaranteed to suffer the same fate as that of my own Dionysian, shameful plea for love: another ten years of waiting in an abandoned box until somebody gets the masochistic urge to dig it out and hang their head in embarrassment.","""...and yer hair's li-ike the shimm'rin' starz o'tha suhn, wit' smails of sniff-sniff gas'line ohn steamin ...

In our world of effusive, odd similes, arcane accusations and contrarian revisionism, either extreme will do, yet to our chagrin, some musicians don't set out to make a quick million or push things forward. Some artists just take what other people do, and do it much better. Such, for instance, is the appeal of the New Pornographers, or Luna, or Aimee Mann. And Earlimart. There's absolutely nothing on these Californians' third proper album (they released an EP earlier this year) that you haven't heard before on a hundred indie discs. Languid strum patterns, spooky pianos, shimmery arpeggios, distant e-bows sawing away under half-whispered, heavy-lidded vocals-- it's all there. But it's better than you might think. ""We're So Happy (We Left the Piano In the Truck)"" opens as a dreamy march, carried along by gentle snare rolls and male/female cooing of the title phrase; I imagine this is what Mirah would sound like if she were sprung free from Phil Elvrum's clutches. The evident single ""We Drink On the Job"" is a faster and goofier affair, co-produced by Jason Lytle of Grandaddy (this bit of patronage will probably pay off in publicity but it feels quite unnecessary; Aaron Espinoza, who masterminded the rest of the CD, is a terrific producer-- more on that later). ""The Movies"" was the first song to leap out at me, demanding replay. It's stately and sad, beginning with a minor piano figure and featuring a slightly strangulated vocal. I'll risk a disservice to Earlimart by comparing it to the Smashing Pumpkins circa Adore-- which is not at all a criticism: j'adore Adore. ""Lost At Sea"" is a jarring segue, and rocks it like Sparklehorse-- twin funnels of guitar distortion and a barking Vocoder are yours for 1 minute 26 seconds. The ill-placed ""Untitled"" is a bit of instrumental filler that makes you suspect Earlimart are straying, but thankfully that's not the case: the catchiest song on this album, ""Burning the Cow"", is right around the corner. In case you're curious, the chorus actually does go ""Burning the cow, burning the cow"", not unlike the Judas Priest classic. With any luck, it will become the summer-barbeque sing-along of 2003. Everyone Down Here stops alternating tempos midway through, and achieves a certain sun-glazed Cali Zen. ""Hospital"" and ""Lazy Feet 23"" sway darkly in slo-mo, like seaweed underwater; by the time ""Night, Nite"" rolls around, you've been lulled into hypnotized contentment. At this point, Espinoza could be whispering assassination orders in your ear and you'd comply tomorrow morning. The reason it all works? Texture. Aaron Espinoza pays more attention to texture than just about anyone out there twiddling the proverbial knobs. I tend to fall for producers with signature tricks-- Jon Brion's glockenspiels and harmonia, Dave Fridmann's unique way with drums, Albini's ability to press the ""rec"" button-- but Espinoza's greatness is subtler. Every instrument on ""Everyone Down Here"" sounds warm, yet weird: hearing a simple tremolo on a guitar lick is, somehow, a revelation. Even the tape hiss that haunts the first and last several seconds of each song is somehow rendered pleasant, like a handful of sand oozing between your fingers. Earlimart may not allay Grandaddy's Luddite worries, but they do score a small victory over technocrats by providing the best argument for analog studio recording I've heard in a long while. The bedroom is a fine place, and you can loop your uncle's hacking cough into a most excellent percussion bit, but can your sophtware do this?","Critics hate good bands: give us genius or give us Andrew WK.

From Every Sphere,Ed Harcourt,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c05b5e6ef9596932353b/1:1/w_160/eb236c4e.jpg,2003-06-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3740-from-every-sphere/,Astralwerks,"It's beyond easy to compose long, annotated lists of musicians that Ed Harcourt sounds like: a shined-up Tom Waits, a watered down Badly Drawn Boy, a less subtle Elliott Smith, a strained Rufus Wainwright, an overwhelmed M. Ward...but we don't settle for RIYL contextualizing here at Pitchfork. The confessional male singer/songwriter path is a well-tread trail, first battered down decades ago by some strikingly capable feet, and these days maintained by a small handful of exceptional contemporaries. It's a subgenre that gets reinvented occasionally and rehashed incessantly, but even those with a strong tolerance for breathless singer/songwriter pontificating will find Ed Harcourt's airy croon tiring, derivative, or at worst unnecessary after a few listens. Like Harcourt's Mercury Prize-nominated full- length debut-- 2002's Here Be Monsters-- From Every Sphere isn't quite thick or dynamic enough to withstand such a high level of exposure. With twelve fine-but-predictable songs (fourteen on the US edition) full of unremarkable, yawning melodies, it's not especially difficult to chart the linear path of a Harcourt ballad after hearing only the first thirty seconds, which prompts the inevitable question: why keep listening? Even a bored game of finish-the-lyric poses little challenge here: ""We are joined at the hip like "" ""Siamese twins!"" To be fair, there is redemption embedded within, a few genuinely interesting bits wedged between stacks and stacks of gooey piano ballads. ""From Every Sphere"" is excessively shimmery, but its dense drone and unrelenting piano are strangely convincing partners; Harcourt ditches his high, lazy caw for some quiet, inaudible cooing, and the whole starlit mess eventually shifts into something hypnotic and strangely compelling. ""Watching The Sun Come Up"" is a notable pop achievement, wherein Harcourt lets his vocals play a bit Buckley, swinging wildly over a slathered-on skin of electric guitar and piano. ""Ghost Writer"" is the most self- consciously ""experimental"" (circa 1995?) track on the record, littered with beats, quick, abstract movements, and Harcourt's deep, devious growl. But the rest of From Every Sphere is straightforward cruising stuff; palatable, but without enough twists and knots to keep anyone fully engaged. Oddly enough, Harcourt harbors a certain amount of self-awareness about his comparably bland folk-popping and, subsequently, has been making some wild, deliberate leaps away from his benign singer/songwriter pigeonhole. Check this: at an Italian music festival, Harcourt smashed his electric piano into two pieces! And for those not as impressed by gratuitously splintering wood and spewing tangles of string, Harcourt has another trick in his poem-filled backpack: he plays a shitload of instruments. Piano, electric guitar, ""squeaky"" pump organ, drums, bass, clavinet, bells, percussion, harmonica, slide and acoustic guitar, bass, glockenspiel, korg synths, omnichord, and something called a ""fun machine"" all earn Harcourt a paragraph of liner notes. They're credits he deserves, as Harcourt's clearly a gifted musician, but his exhaustive I-can-play-it list is also a pretty telling overcompensation. Technical virtuoso has never equaled ""interesting.""","It's beyond easy to compose long, annotated lists of musicians that Ed Harcourt sounds like: a shined-up Tom Waits ...

Heroin,Ekkehard EhlersStephan Mathieu,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ddeb335119a49ed7f3/1:1/w_160/f5112f2d.gif,2003-06-25 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5149-heroin/,Orthlorng Musork,"Electronic music's movement through trends, like Moore's Law, is constantly accelerating. Advances in software and technique lead to new sounds and structures, which are then absorbed quickly by an artists' community that takes light-speed dissemination of information as a given. And then, just as quickly, the trends become tired. Or maybe it's the listeners growing weary. While ""keeping up"" with rock music has always been a matter of finding who is writing the good songs, experimental electronic music is about a search for new feelings. Most of the time, when sliding a new CD into the tray, we're looking for surprises. We're talking about hard work. Most of the time. What I love about the Stephan Mathieu and Ekkehard Ehlers collaboration Heroin is that it reminds me that IDM records don't have to sound new to sound great, and that a handful of these records, even though they're part of a zeitgeist tethered to fluctuations in CPU clock speeds, have a certain timelessness. On the surface, this record-- recorded between December 27, 2000 and January 2, 2001 in the Netherlands performance space Extrapool-- sounds very much like any one of many glitch-click-cut records released in the late 90s. All the familiar sounds are intact. And yet, Mathieu & Ehlers, during their week of recording, managed to tap into what made this trend so captivating in the first place. Noise and unpredictability can both subvert and enrich traditionally musical sound, and when you get the balance right, as they do on Heroin, the whole far outstrips the sum of its parts. Heroin was originally released in 2001 as a limited pressing on the small label Brombron. It was a seldom-heard blip until Kit Clayton rescued it from oblivion by reissuing it on Orthlorng Musork, adding an additional disc of remixes to the package. Mathieu and Ehlers have worked together since, collaborating on the second ""Plays John Cassavetes"" track on Ekkehard Ehlers' Plays collection. That stunning piece of music, which looped a section of the Beatles' ""Good Night"", demonstrated that this pair likes to toy with achingly beautiful melodies. And indeed, Heroin is quite accessible despite the loads of theory Ehlers and Mathieu bring to the table. In the early going, this record could even be described as sentimental. The opening ""New Year's Eve"" mixes the sound of distant fireworks with a sad, wistful organ tune, and it's uncanny how much this music feels like a tiny black and white film. Images explode into my head with the rockets whenever I hear it-- abandoned piers, distant crowds, hidden faces. ""New Year's Even"" fades into my favorite track here, ""Rose"", which consists of a short clip of keyboard music looped and reversed underneath a melodica melody. It's another example of what I was talking about earlier, where Mathieu and Ehlers take a device that's been around forever (reversed drums date at the very least from ""Are You Experienced?"") and make it fresh and moving. With its endlessly repeating backward keyboard pattern, ""Rose"" seems like the output of some kind of self-contained music machine, spinning out a single breathtaking melodic fragment that you could listen to forever. Then comes the heavily processed ""Turkey Song"", which takes ""Christmas Time is Here"" from Vince Guaraldi's A Charlie Brown Christmas and warps the Peanuts gang's voices until the song sounds like a broken memory struggling through the head of an Alzheimer's patient. The rest of Heroin takes a darker, dronier turn that's less emotionally direct but remains strong throughout. I like to imagine that the clanging keyboard that competes with the static in ""Supertramp"" is a half-speed sample of one of the notes from ""Goodbye Stranger"", but there's no way to know for sure. The first track named ""Rausch"" combines warmth with randomness in a way that reminds me of Microstoria, while the second ""Rausch"", which has thick curls of noise shifting slowly around a single held chord, almost sounds like Windy & Carl. Tracks on Heroin flow one into the next and all are at least very good. The remix disc is spottier. Producers take extensive liberties with the source material and fashion something completely new, which is good, but they also happen to stay on a more abstract path, lending a degree of unity. Still, the subtlety and creative use of space that makes the Heroin record special is mostly absent from these reworkings. There's a good cast (Joseph Suchy, Nobukazu Takemura, Kit Clayton, Freiband, Christian Fennesz, Oren Ambarchi, Carmen Baier & Akira Rabelais), but ultimately they manage only two killer tracks. One is Fennesz' ""Codeine"", which already appears on his excellent Field Recordings 1995-2002 compilation. The other is Cologne legend Joseph Suchy's "":quque"", which brilliantly incorporates his disorienting kaleidoscopic guitar technique. Beyond that, there's some interesting stuff, but nothing terribly special. As a bonus disc, the remix disc is just that, but the original Heroin has the goods, one of the better records of its kind to emerge in the last five years.","Electronic music's movement through trends, like Moore's Law, is constantly accelerating.

"Player, Player",kpt.michi.gan,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfb13d197565213b1f3/1:1/w_160/ba4e7674.jpg,2003-06-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4525-player-player/,Aesthetics,"Despite their increasing notoriety for doing bad things like killing people, machines can be pretty awesome. It's the summer and it's hot, and I like the fact that I have a machine in my house that keeps my brews nice and cold. For how awfully dependent we are on machines, and for how often they can screw us over, think about how incredible it is that, at any moment, we can log onto the Internet and see a free photo of a naked guy or girl, or perhaps both, together. We have machines that, when we put round discs in or on them, make pretty fantastic sounds. Player, Player is a celebration of awesome machines, of machines at their most beautiful. The album hearts the fact that the metal within, if only because it is touched and molded by our hands, maintains some level of our humanity. kpt.michi.gan (aka Michael Beckett, aka the short, bearded third of the Schneider TM touring brigade who recently earned a reputation for appearing in the middle of The Faint's set and poking the band members in the butt with a microphone stand) does not, as so many other electronic artists do, try to create beautiful music despite his electronic machinery. Rather, it's as if Beckett is exploiting the beautiful music of machinery itself, recreating what we all might imagine our CD changers, turntables and iPods might sound like if microphones could record the melodies and harmonies of the atomic level. Indeed, Beckett is ""playing the player,"" and we are privy to one man's vision of the awesome electronic concert that happens every time we turn on our stereo receivers. The very first sound we hear on ""Solong S-20"" is a sine tone, harsh and abrasive, before it's subsumed into a more deeply lush, slowly pulsating wave. The tone occasionally regains its dominance, but ultimately Beckett keeps the wave at the forefront. He moves beyond sound prima facie, and for the rest of the track we're amidst those very atomic gears that process sound. Listened to one after the other, ""Jimi"" and ""Derber Papa"" operate as ""Solong S-20"" did, but on a wider and more varied scale. ""Jimi"" is thirty-seven seconds of piston-like mechanical pounding (for the complete effect, I recommend listening to this on headphones). A romantic type might imagine the sound of a turntable, its drive belt slowly turning, the needle being dragged against a record's grooves, occasionally tripping over a speck of dust or a piece of hair. It's the least pleasant sound on the album, but its presence is perhaps most important: without the sonic nit and grit of machines, we cannot have-- let alone appreciate-- the more beautiful ones that we demand from them. The abrasiveness of ""Jimi"" is matched only by the first thirty seconds of noise that opens ""Derber Papa"". Slowly, though, Beckett motivates what is Player, Player's coarsest barrage of noise into a fast pulse over which he lies a sound that's uncannily similar to the sound of the human breath. It's a slow breath, and a pained one, but it persists, and for me, it's the paradigm of Player, Player's humanity-within-machinery motif. The album closes with ""Hey Brother"", which, with the exception of a faint electronic drumbeat, is entirely composed of Beckett singing along to acoustic guitar accompaniment. The quasi-folk song seems out of place on what is in many ways an academic electronic album, but de facto concludes a ring structure introduced by the sine tone of the first track: sound sandwiches meta-sound. On Player, Player, kpt.michi.gan pulls us into our speaker cones and through our wires, shows us how beautifully sound is processed, and brings his tour to an end as our stereos, in a breathy Beckett voice, ask us with tongues in cheek: ""Hey brother, look at me.""","Despite their increasing notoriety for doing bad things like killing people, machines can be pretty awesome.

From: Shamra Tunsa
Subject: Deftones Review Pitchdorks, Deftones sounds more like a band in the throws of a mid-life crisis than a group of musicians that could be called the 'Radiohead of Metal'. This is music on the fence-post of popular pining and dulled experimentation, an anachronistic addition to an otherwise respectable discography, and it will be remembered as such. ARE YOU FUCKIN KIDDING ME!?!? Andrew Bryant should be drowned in a capsized port-a-potty for writing bullshit like this! How did he get hired, is he someone's cousin or fuckbuddy or something? Deftones is probably the greatest album to be released this entire fuckin year! Maybe its just that Andy couldn't hear how awesome ""When Girls Telephone Boys"" and ""Battle-Axe' are with his head stuck so far up his own ass. How can anyone say these kick-ass songs are anywhere near that pussy Linkin Park shit? Also, I'd like to call his bluff regarding the lyrics to ""Moana."" These are just the kind of 9th-grade poetic flubs found in the bottom-left hand corner of my old Earth Science primer. If Andrew Bryant is so fuckin talented, how come the only songs he liked were the shitty ones? ""Lucky You"" and ""Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event""? Dude how many Cure albums does a guy have to swallow to fully appreciate the sappy filler on albums like this? Only little girls would pick the emo piano shit on a Metal album. Bryant shows his true elitist colors picking on the programmed drums in ""Lucky You"" instead of actually paying attention—he might notice how well the group interchanges the quiet-loud-quiet motif with moments of silence. I hope you fire him, he obviously has no idea what good music is. -shamra tunsa Pitchfork Review: Deftones: Deftones  Because we're all individuals, except for you. From: Connor Kiley
Subject: p4k, sold out? Ryan, Did Pitchfork strike a deal with Viacom or something? Why all the recent reviews of major label bands (Led Zeppelin, Metallica...ok I can see Liz Phair but the Deaf-tones)? I mean, ok, yeah, I liked The Cure in high school, these mallrat idiots suckered me with Minerva a few years back, but the rest of their catalog, or what I've heard of it, is crass commercial melodrama on par with Marilyn Manson. Even the tracks with hardcore roots—""Bloody Cape"" and ""Good Morning Beautiful,"" for example—reek of Moreno's guilty conscience. He's stuck playing to teenage goth metal fans while pretending he's all ""indie rock"" because he's heard MBV and The Smiths. Yeah dude, those records are wicked hard to come by! Ok, ""Hexagram"" may distinguish them from Staind and Korn with all the chugging, but only in the eyes of future generations, 'cos any praise wasted on this shit is splitting already thin hairs— and I'd rather rip a few off that pie-face's double-chin-cloaking goatee. Atkins, dude, not facial hair. For every one of Deftones' highlights (wait, is there more than one?), there are twelve cartoonish attempts at reclaiming the old-days of a fuckin outright embarrassment to begin with: metal. Ever since Tool started with their drama club metal, TSR teens have been rolling twenty-sided dice and donning black leather overcoats like it's going out of style. NEWSFLASH: Skinny kids look even scrawnier in those things, and fat kids, dude, just roll with the roll-- what, you're magically gonna drop the tire in the unlikely event a girl gets past all five buckles on that cape? Oh, but ""Needles and Pins,"" man, give me a break, is this fuckin Limp Bizkit? Listen to that fuckin' chorus and this record HAS to get a 0.0. ""Who wants to fuck with us now?"" I mean that's just fuckin' pure Iron Maiden nonsense, and you guys are actually debating this record's place in comparison to real artists like Single Frame (thanks for the tip) or even Radiohead. Oh, then that whimpering little ""serious song"", ""Deathblow."" What a fuckin title. Deathblow. Why not call it fucking ""Columbine"", dudes. Their attempt at ambient space and fuzzed out guitar would be laughable, but the irony of a line like ""It's still the same song/ It's still the same song"" only merits something equally retarded: I'm ROTFLMAO. Pitchfork is above this, and I hope you just chuck this pandering major label coverage policy out the window with Brent D's hatemail. Sincerely,

'...And Farewell to Hightide/Lighthouse in Athens' and 'Elements of Structure/Permanence',Cerberus Shoal,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a575c0084474cd0c071a/1:1/w_160/23edc0fc.gif,2003-06-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1384-and-farewell-to-hightidelighthouse-in-athens-and-elements-of-structurepermanence/,TreeTree,"Inching towards the end of their first decade together, Cerberus Shoal have survived the disruptions of a band twice their age: constant line-up changes, label moves, and erratic reissues that barely keep their catalog in print. Along the way they've grown from their self-titled debut-- a hardcore record full of unreflective howls from upset youngsters-- to a band that's impossible to categorize beyond the all-purpose term ""avant rock."" Based out of ""America's First Portland"" (Maine), Cerberus Shoal reflect some of the crunchier elements of their hometown-- their shambolic instrumentals can evoke the sound of an ancient, tribal dope-smoking ritual-- but they're far from a hippie band: even their jams avoid the aimless plod of stoner rock, and duck the smug academic fervor that taints so much experimental music. Probably the most important quality to their music, going all the way back to that first hardcore record, is simply that they're patient: they'll give an idea the time it needs to unfold, and whatever their destination, they'll just get there when they get there. Their second and possibly their best record ...and Farewell to Hightide-- newly reissued on Temporary Residence-- has a resonance that pulls its songs into an engrossing suite. The five tracks move with the force and breadth; they're captivating right from the start of ""Falling to Pieces Part One"", where a shimmering organ embeds Chriss (sic) Sutherland's voice, moaning and tuneful, while lightly-seared noises swoop in like bony crows. The song crackles with anticipation, which bursts when they cut to ""Broken Springs Spring Forth From Broken Clocks""-- an explosively loose jam that's well-paced but as ferocious as its title. More than half the pieces feature Sutherland's vocals, but he doesn't corral the music into rigid structure as much as add another layer to the stretched-out textures. Half the time he's just speaking, delivering a kind of obsessive monologue-- especially on the record's centerpiece, ""J.B.O. vs. Blin"", where he nails the sound of endless late-night self-recrimination. He harps on the word ""failure"" while Jeremy Federman's echoey trumpet circles him, hashing outs his thoughts in a glowing twelve-minute dirge. Though the shortest piece on Farewell... runs 6-plus minutes, only ""Make Winter a Driving Song"" feels too long-- and then only because it sounds so contented. The rest of the album rocks gently between tension and resolution, until it closes on an unexpectedly lovely finish: in ""Falling to Pieces Part Two"", Sutherland's musings come to a kind of peace against a backdrop of flute, violin and piano. If this album resembles late-night insomnia, this is the point where-- whether or not he's solved the world's problems-- Sutherland finally drifts off. This reissue comes with bonus material that's cordoned off to a second disc: the songs ""Lighthouse in Athens"" parts one and two, which include beautiful fragments of gray, yearning post-rock. The songs show that Sutherland-- while heartfelt and often captivating-- lacks the range or force to be a full-time lead vocalist, even in the idiosyncratic vein of a Sam Prekop. The tunes aren't as fleshed-out or visionary as the proper album, though they're enjoyable enough B-sides from the road not taken. Which brings us to Cerberus Shoal's third album, also just reissued by Temporary Residence: Elements of Structure/Permanence, their first all-instrumental disc. A local artist named Tim Fallon had asked them to record soundtracks for two half-hour silent films; the band used this as a chance to work with musicians from two other Maine groups, Tarpigh and Interstellar Policeman. The final pick-up band included nine people, who performed the pieces as group improvisations, finishing them both in a couple of takes. Right away, it's amazing how well this group coheres: the rhythm section locks together, as Sutherland uses slow, heavy bass lines while drummer Tom Rogers and percussionist Eric LaPerna goad the rest of the band to life. Tom Kovasevic's charango, and Tim Harbeson's accordion and trumpet thread color into the slow, dense pieces: even without a composition to guide them, the band expertly swells and contracts. This is a collective that knows how to work a crescendo. Unfortunately, the musicians hang together so well that they end up playing it safe. Nobody takes a risk after the first ten or so seconds, and the two pieces come out sounding almost exactly alike. The soloists are passive-- noone wanders far from the path marked out by the rhythm section-- and the band never leaves a somber, mid-tempo pace. Even after the second track slides into a faintly audible percussion interlude, it just comes back to pick up right where it left off. Still, Elements is memorable as the point where Cerberus Shoal turned away from ""songwriting."" Tarpigh merged with the band, bringing their Middle Eastern influence; while they continue to change directions-- and line-ups-- Cerberus Shoal's later work is full of clanking, exotic percussion, jagged guitars and instrumentals that can dart by like shards or stretch out like caravans. Few of their works are as long-winded as Elements of Structure/Permanence, but like ...and Farewell to Hightide, it proves they can give their ideas all the time they need to unfold: their meandering gives them the strength to scale mountains.","Inching towards the end of their first decade together, Cerberus Shoal have survived the disruptions of a band twice their ...

Giraffe,Echoboy,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbffea9e61561daa7384/1:1/w_160/0c74f8b1.jpg,2003-06-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2679-giraffe/,Mute,"There are bedroom recordings, and then there's Echoboy's Giraffe-- the DIY equivalent of the $41 burger at Manhattan's Old Homestead steakhouse. Every ingredient is classed up: you get Kobe beef, arugula instead of lowly lettuce-- they even work truffles into the equation, somehow. But in the end it's still a burger, dominated by the fundamentally proletarian pairing of meat and bread. It's not even a very good burger, and neither should it be: you pay to taste the money you just spent. Echoboy takes just about every British musical invention of the last two decades and reduces it to an indication of good taste. Over the course of the album, direct quotes from myriad Great Sources float in and out of the speakers, ushered by the infamous Flood (the producer who made Depeche Mode sound like U2 and the Smashing Pumpkins sound like Depeche Mode). But hiding below layers of dated synth noise, dinky drum machines and expensive effects is, surprise surprise, a solo bedroom recording. 50 minutes of structured wankery, as performed by a lone Brit with the questionable talent to put a chorus to a verse, employing a thin, laddish vocal and rudimentary guitar skills. ""Automatic Eyes"" is the ultimate all-things-to-all-people single, owing its prolonged-orgasm dynamic to New Order, its bass melody to Blur and its vocal line to just about anyone willing to claim it. Thankfully, some songs on Giraffe-- notably ""Don't Destroy Me"" and ""Summer Rhythm""-- aren't quite as naked in their crossover ambitions; in fact, most tend to start out fine in their minimalism, but they gradually head for the toilet as Flood's stratagems take over. Track after track, Echoboy's ideas are reshaped to approximate preexisting sounds: ""Wasted Spaces"" is U2's ""Discotheque"" sideways, and ""Fun in You"" sounds like Depeche Mode (before the song even comes on, really). I'll grant that some of these tunes put up more of a fight: ""Comfort of the Hum"" is the closest Echoboy comes to a convincing patchwork quilt, a singalong about the joys of city living; it's a piano-based piece prone to hanging on the 5th chord, before triumphantly resolving into the 1st. ""Good on TV"" initially dares to present the 'Boy's voice stripped of effects, at least until the punkish chorus: ""All that we can do is sit and wait/ For the money to accumulate/ But it's never gonna happen to me/ Cause I don't look good on TV."" Forget TV, Echoboy-- worry about how you sound on record. Only on Giraffe's closing song ""Nearly All the Time"" does Echoboy allot himself any conceptual breathing room. After the ""official"" portion of the song ends, careening strings and Mellotron extend the track in the direction of Madchester psychedelia. But almost predictably, it ends at the precise moment it gets interesting, further evidence of how the 'Boy and Flood can't figure good from bad, relying on outside standards to dictate how far they should take anything. Several critics, in the UK and here, found Echoboy's chaotic borrowings nothing less than revolutionary-- the mere application of electronic vocabulary to conventional song structure, for instance, struck my colleague at PopMatters as fresh. Personally, I find another reaction more telling: in the ultimate backhanded compliment, another thieving magpie-- Noel Gallagher-- reportedly offered Echoboy a job with Oasis.","There are bedroom recordings, and then there's Echoboy's Giraffe-- the DIY equivalent of the $41 burger at Manhattan ...

Liz Phair,Liz Phair,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04c5e6ef9596931fef8/1:1/w_160/97410789.jpg,2003-06-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6255-liz-phair/,Capitol,"It could be said that Liz Phair's greatest asset has always been her inability to write a perfect pop song. On her 1993 debut, Exile in Guyville, Phair's gruff voice wrapped awkward non-hooks around flimsy, transparent chord progressions, resulting in (to everyone's surprise) a certifiable indie roadtrip classic. It still stands as a powerfully confrontational album, skirting convention yet marked by Phair's striking awareness of her own limitations. Unfortunately, it seems that Phair has spent the better part of her post-Exile career trying to gloss over the very limitations that made her original statement so profound. Though her second album, Whip-Smart, had a few choice moments which recalled the insight and complexity of Exile, it ultimately seemed like a much more calculated affair. Things didn't start to go horribly awry, of course, until Phair's next album, Whitechocolatespaceegg. That record's attempts to radio-ize her sound only dismantled the depth of her music-- if not the awkwardness-- resulting in an odd batch of songs that perhaps encapsulated Phair's faulty view of what constitutes a radio-friendly album. Ten years on from Exile, Liz has finally managed to achieve what seems to have been her goal ever since the possibility of commercial success first presented itself to her: to release an album that could have just as easily been made by anybody else. Even the songs on Liz Phair that could be considered ""shocking"" or ""profound"" are gratuitous and overdetermined, eschewing the stark and accusatory insights of Exile in favor of pointless f-bombs, manipulative ballads, and foul-mouthed shmeminism. Liz Phair has always been known for her vulgarity, but on Exile and parts of Whip-Smart, she put that trait to good use. On ""Fuck and Run"", a standout from Exile, Phair used the word's negative connotations as a means of pointed self-deprecation and lamented, ""Whatever happened to a boyfriend/ The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it/ I want a boyfriend/ I want all that stupid old shit/ Letters and sodas."" ""Flower"", Phair's most notorious track to date, reads like a laundry list of graphic sexual desires, but rather than paint a uniformly flattering portrait of her love interest, he's immature, he's obnoxious, and despite it all, she still wants to fuck his brains out-- a simple, necessarily crude semi-contradiction that speaks volumes. ""Flower"" would seem to have a descendent in ""H.W.C."" (""Hot White Cum""), in which Phair extols the virtue of semen as a beauty aid (""...Dear Cosmo: Splooge, The New Rouge!""). But, unlike the complex, alternatingly cocky and self-effacing sexuality of ""Flower,"" ""H.W.C.""'s unqualified sperm-praise is entirely vain and degrading. Even more degrading is the constipated donkeyfuck harmonica solo towards the track's end, a hilarious sideshow that only magnifies the triteness of the song's glycerin-slick production. Though ""H.W.C."" is without question the best water-cooler conversation piece on Liz Phair, ""Rock Me"" makes for a close second. Here, Phair sings exuberantly about the benefits of an affair with a younger guy including-- I shit you not-- ""[playing] Xbox on [his] floor."" In between choruses of, ""Baby baby baby if it's alright/ Want you to rock me all night,"" Phair declares, ""I'm starting to think that young guys rule!"" without a trace of self-doubt or reflection. It's hard to imagine that the Liz Phair of ten years ago wouldn't have had something profound and devastating to say about older women who shack up with clueless college kids, but on ""Rock Me""-- as on the rest of Liz Phair-- vapid, cliché-filled rhyme couplets dominate. Take, for example, the album's first single, ""Why Can't I"", ""co""-written by Avril Lavigne songwriting team The Matrix. With a chorus of, ""Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?"" and a cookie-cutter rock/pop background, the song could easily pass for Michelle Branch. The lyric, ""We haven't fucked yet/ But my head's still spinning,"" seemingly seeks to set Phair apart from the teen-pop crowd, but the use of the word is completely gratuitous-- change it to ""kissed"" and stick a 16-year-old girl in front of the mic and no one could tell the difference. Only on ""Little Digger"" does Phair attempt to tackle subject matter unique to the circumstances of her own life as a 36-year-old single mother. The song has received positive press for addressing a difficult issue, as Phair sings to her son about his absent father and the new men she's dating. But the fact that anything positive could be said about this track speaks only to the overwhelming lack of substance on this record. From its cloying synthstring arrangements to its ballad-in-a-box drumbeat to its infuriatingly manipulative chorus of, ""My mother is mine,"" ""Little Digger"" offers up all the insight and emotion of a UPN sitcom. In recent interviews, Phair has been upfront about her hopes of mainstream success, and claims full awareness that Liz Phair is likely to alienate many of her original fans. What she doesn't seem to realize is that a collection of utterly generic rocked-out pop songs isn't likely to win her many new ones. It's sad that an artist as groundbreaking as Phair would be reduced to cheap publicity stunts and hyper-commercialized teen-pop. But then, this is ""the album she has always wanted to make""-- one in which all of her quirks and limitations are absorbed into well-tested clichés, and ultimately, one that may as well not even exist.","It could be said that Liz Phair's greatest asset has always been her inability to write a perfect pop ...

Absolutes,Sightings,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f25e6ef95969320762/1:1/w_160/3ebb1cbb.gif,2003-06-23 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7144-absolutes/,Load,"""This Jello tastes how you look."" Unfortunately, the next conscious thought I had after my slurred uttering of that phrase revolved around how my cousin's living room ceiling had too many tiles for me to count without getting sick in an adjacent fireplace. Mouth dry and stomach unsettled, my first drunken experience-- at the tender age of 14-- had left me queasy, weak, and saddled with an inability to drink anything with the word ""orange"" in it for the next five years. Happily, aside from gaining valuable self-knowledge regarding the recuperative abilities of the teenage liver, the experience succeeded in teaching me the fear and respect due to one of mankind's most blinding furies-- the homemade concoction that is ""white lightning."" Backwoods and brutish, moonshine is intended neither for the faint-of-heart nor those unwilling to engage in a modicum of experimentation, as it requires a certain amount of what my papa would call ""gumption"" in order to acclimate oneself to both the taste and effect of this pernicious beverage. Years later I would approach Sightings' album Absolutes with a similar sense of cautionary adventure, preparing myself for a beautiful assault that I would inevitably and repeatedly lose myself in, regardless of the consequences. Anchored in the Cartesian-related premise that pain is the only thought process that will not betray one's reality, Absolutes begins with the organic-by-way-of-savageness static feedback of ""White Keys"". Creating an awkward and psychotic ""twist,"" the instrumentation of guitarist Mark Morgan and bassist Richard Hoffman slowly becomes blurred as the song progresses, the only constant amid the cacophony being Morgan's buried yelps of ""woo-hoo"" and ""ah-ah"" that eventually collide in a gigantic screech signaling the conclusion of the disc's preface. ""Infinity of Stops"" picks up directly thereafter, as the static pulse is refurbished with a clipping beat courtesy of drummer John Lockie and some squealing guitar manipulations that are similarly hacked to bits by the underlying bass line. This too inescapably falls victim to the approaching fallout of the bare percussion, a reluctant follower of the chaos that recently cleared the path for its creation and release. Given the pummeling offensive the band tends to rely on, it's unexpected that Sightings outfit multiple tracks with what sounds like the sophisticated gamelan-influenced playing style of the Indonesian Isles. Perhaps as a move to admonish comments regarding the band as a second rate Boredoms or Pussy Galore-- or perhaps as sheer coincidence-- ""Bishops"" begins with a tangible and lasting beat, in itself a shock coming from the No New York-influenced band, that eventually waylays an example of such an Eastern-tinged rhythm into the high end of the mix. As Morgan continues to do his best John Lydon impression, uttering nonsensical phrases and monosyllabic sounds, the Javanese-esque melody eventually fades to echo only to reappear transformed in the following track, ""Canadian Money"". Syncopating from within the belly of a steel factory, the metal drums rule the track as a rapid-fire attack of humming and pounding fight and win the battle to keep above the current of rising guitar fallouts and steady bass-drones. Further rallying against cries of homogeneity in a field of Rock 'N Roll where such accusations are rampant and unpleasantly expected, Sightings does not rest in presenting a bevy of tracks that display their knack for subtle interplay. Possibly an inverted political message, ""Right Side of the Hall"" is a D.C.-hardcore tune at heart, with vocals channeled as an animal growl and a pop-rhythm section so simple and catchy, it would be a crime to bury it beneath all of that feedback-- if in the end it wasn't such a beautiful statement of artistic freedom to do so. ""E.E."" is further evidence of the group's pop mastery, as the track exemplifies in forty-five seconds what Man...or Astroman? have been attempting to accomplish for the past four years-- an Elvis Presley beach-song characteristically played by the heavy machinery of a high-rise construction crew. The track exists in stark contrast to the veritable jam sessions of ""Anna Mae Wong"" and ""Reduction"", both of which surpass the seven-minute mark during the unraveling of their respective sound. In the former, the group uses the moments between starts and stops to develop a suspenseful tension that eventually becomes a pattern of instrumental call-and-response bringing to mind comparisons with the early improvisation of jazz and the blues. The latter track further builds upon this, but instead of a silent backdrop for the voices to argue against ""Reduction"" provides a sobering cadence, a beat that sputters out modestly in a manner befitting a composition that is showy only in its lack of pretense. A difficult album to take in, one should not disregard Absolutes based on a single listen, or even three or four. Like the outline diagrammed on the cover for the production of sweet-corn hooch, the rewards of the disc increase exponentially with repeated listens and time. Not the sound of something new, but merely the sound of something done right, Sightings has hit upon an extraordinary groove, one they will hopefully ride out to its pure and uncomplicated end.","""This Jello tastes how you look.""

I Know Your Troubles Been Long,Mayday,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3eceb335119a49ed819/1:1/w_160/9e85953a.jpg,2003-06-23 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5162-i-know-your-troubles-been-long/,Bar/None,"If you've listened to top 40 radio in the last few years, it's no secret that the producer is everything: a Brandy single isn't really a Brandy song so much as it's a vehicle for her producer to lay down a great track that happens to feature Brandy. I wouldn't exactly say this ethos has crept into indie rock, but the importance of production is no smaller in the musical minor leagues. Some records work best if they sound like they were recorded in a tin can, but others need the finesse of a skilled recordist to get everything just right. And Mayday are a band that's better served by finesse than tin cans. Accurately described as a front for the muse of former Lullaby for the Working Class honcho/current Cursive guitar hero Ted Stevens, Mayday released a frankly brilliant debut last year: Old Blood, an expansive, ambitious swirl of Great Plains dust and sonic sophistication that blew expectations out of the water. Part of the record's success was the deft hand lent to the recording by brothers Mike & A.J. Mogis, who together are about as close as you can get to Nigel Godrich in the breadbasket. The brothers Mogis are unfortunately nowhere to be found on this new Mayday record, their first away from their old home at Saddle Creek records. The band's music is good enough to get them by without a proper treatment at the board, but it's hard to avoid imagining what a better recording could have done to make this album more dramatic and intense. As it stands, the recording is adequate to convey the band's ideas, but it frequently robs the arrangements of their distinctness by mashing the sounds together in the same frequency range and letting distortion gain too much of an upper hand. Despite a huge cast of players, I Know Your Troubles Been Long is a great deal more basic than its predecessor, a snapshot of rustbelt Americana suffused with impressionistic lyrics that occasionally veer into the political realm, though never in a pointed manner. ""Little Tremors"" takes an oblique look at the Iraq war with its imagery of a ""lonely cowboy"" and the verse ""There are tremors in the valley/ Little tremors/ Can't you feel them."" ""Virginia"" expands on this a bit, with its loosely woven tale of young lovers fleeing a town that turned on them ""in support of a warring regime."" Tentative commentary aside, Stevens trades in haunting verses like this doozy that opens ""Crawfish River"": ""Let's go down to the riverbed/ Let's go and catch some crawfish/ Mom will throw them in the kettle, break their little backs first/ Our little Townes will bite off the heads one by one/ And laughing, he'll spit out each skull piece."" The way Stevens takes nostalgic memories like this and turns them into something sinister colors the whole album, and in a sense, the murk of the sound somewhat aids his sailboat-in-a-hurricane worldview. Stevens is just about buried under the stuttering drums and ruddy guitars of ""Running Away"", but the song's arrangement builds up an incredible momentum before finally breaking into a sort of tractor-pull hoedown, mud flying right along with the fiddles and slide guitars. ""Lost Serenade"", on the other hand, is a masterful ballad, graced by lazily interwoven trumpet and violin-- this is music for an empty prairie cabaret at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday. The album is bookended by the beautiful garbage of ""Lone Star"" and ""Laundromat"", songs whose arrangements are so thoroughly broken they cohere into ramshackle beauty. It's a bit of a shame that Mayday don't quite live up to their towering start here, but the resulting album is still full of moments of bleary-eyed beauty and graceful wreckage, and it's hard to ignore a band who does that so well. If you like you albums with the crusts cut off, I'm afraid this one probably isn't for you, but nearly anyone who's ever found something to enjoy in cheap microphones and overdriven VU meters will find something to love here.","If you've listened to top 40 radio in the last few years, it's no secret that the producer ...

I'm Staying Out,Caitlin Cary,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5349d034d5c69bf3245/1:1/w_160/412c9c02.jpg,2003-06-23 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1321-im-staying-out/,Yep Roc,"Caitlin Cary deserves at least one review that doesn't doggedly refer to her former Whiskeytown bandmate-gone-Gap-commercial-- the eternally-jean jacketed, pinching Mick Jagger's ass in Rolling Stone, now-awkwardly ubiquitous Ryan Adams-- but it seems unlikely (red handed, here) that she'll ever get it. I'm Staying Out, Cary's prompt follow-up to her 2002 debut While You Weren't Looking, is full of earnest, hipster-bucking countrified pop, thick with violins, keyboards and soft, plaintively breathed lyrics about obstinate women, girlish pining, and Sunday mornings spent curled tightly in bed. Adams' musical influence on I'm Staying Out is dismissible at best, but his smirking, messy-haired ghost seems destined to forever haunt Caitlin Cary's Carolina halls, grinning toothily, bobbing his head, and snottily-- if unintentionally-- distracting everybody from what's really going on. At least stylistically, Cary's landed a fair distance away from the guy she now coyly (albeit affectionately) describes as ""some kid I used to be in a band with."" Whereas Adams has layered his post-Heartbreaker solo work with loads of dumb rock star swagger and some stupidly intentional Parsons-esque photographs of flags and pistols (and dark-haired models in bed? Cigarettes? Headphones?), Cary's is far less concerned with punk posturing, corporate sponsorship, or attracting the fickle affections of Winona Ryder. This is sweet, safely melancholic, pretty-but-benign stuff; perfectly competent, I'm Staying Out compensates for its lack of spectacular innovation by showcasing its players' technical prowess and busting out a handful of intensely sincere performances. Cary's pitch-perfect alto seems alt-country certified: part-Natalie Merchant, part-Lucinda Williams, and occasionally-- see ""Please Break My Heart""-- skewing a bit Patsy Cline. Cary's is a consistently rich and effortless croon, pushing through straightforward mid-tempo pop songs full of sub-fiddle flights for guitar solos, threaded-in keyboards and the occasional mandolin or clavinet with impressive, comforting ease. With her indisputable violin chops, Cary had already brazenly bowed her way through Whiskeytown's two-deep discography, breaking up Adams' guitar pummeling with her subtle, satisfying coos. Here, with Jayhawk Jen Gunderman lending a solid foundation of organ, piano, and backing vocals, Cary's fiddling shines. ""Cello Girl"" mixes lite-rock electric guitar stroking with violin lines and steady percussion; the excellent ""Sleepin' In On Sunday"" is a gentle and soothing lullaby, restrained percussion and lilting, lazy vocals making its name feel awfully (if predictably) apt. Title track ""I'm Staying Out"" is riddled with sad-eyed, syrupy country twang and the obligatory lost-love lyricisms (""I know you are waiting for me to come home/ I hate to think of you spending this night all alone/ But I'm not coming back, dear/ Not never or now,"") while the equally downtrodden ""In A While"" cleanly incorporates the wails of dobro, trumpet, and baritone/tenor sax. Periodically Cary's songwriting evokes the semi-confessional, intermittently caustic women songsmiths of the mid-to-late 1970s (Carly Simon, Carole King, Stevie Nicks), weaving strong vocal melodies with pleasant instrumentation, and working, for the most part, within traditional verse-chorus-verse song structures. Cary occasionally hops out of 4/4, but she's not really kicking down any new sonic paths. It's all very fine and good, it's just not especially compelling. No matter how different Cary and Adams' post-Whiskeytown outputs have been, neither has quite approached the tired, subdued beauty of alt-country landmark Pneumonia. So thank you, dismantled Whiskeytown, for stocking our shelves with plenty of perfectly capable, occasionally tiresome, bandless alt-country singer/songwriters. Now get on with that reunion, please.","Caitlin Cary deserves at least one review that doesn't doggedly refer to her former Whiskeytown bandmate-gone-Gap-commercial-- the eternally-jean jacketed ...

L'Avventura,Dean & BrittaBritta Phillips,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d3ea9e61561daa5ad8/1:1/w_160/fd16b47e.gif,2003-06-23 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8584-lavventura/,Jetset,"I have no idea what the deal is between Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips. Upstanding news source that Pitchfork is, I don't want to clog up this space with hearsay, conjecture, rumors, and gossip. But let's consider the evidence for a moment, shall we? Ever since bassist Justin Harwood was traded for Phillips and a record deal to be named later, Luna has been on a late-career roll: Romantica and its little brother Close Cover Before Striking contained some of their finest work in years. Coincidentally, much of the Wareham compositions on these albums were as full of gooey feelings as a Homecoming dance. And after all, Phillips was the voice of Jem-- didn't we all have a little thing for Jem? Whatever the wink-winks and nudge-nudges of their professional relationship, Wareham and Phillips sound awfully close getting their collab on with L'Avventura. In the valentine vein of Romantica's ""Mermaid Eyes"", many of the tracks appear in intimate duet form-- less ""Don't You Want Me?"" than ""I Fucking Want You; Get That Fine Ass Over Here"". And while the majority of the material covers artists ranging from Madonna to The Doors, they're all run through the Dean-inator: heavy on the wooze and coy, and dolloped with Fridmorchestration like Luna's last two efforts (actually provided here by VH1 trivia answer Tony Visconti). It's this string section velvet that kicks off L'Avventura, a grandiose atmosphere Wareham immediately undercuts by rhyming ""eye"" with...""eye."" It's this self-effacing panache, with Wareham fully comfortable in his more amicable Lou Reed voice, that makes the album's mushiness palatable-- his sardonic delivery turns a sex-change version of Madonna's ""I Deserve It"" into something less self-congratulatory and transmutes Buffy St. Marie's anti-NASA protest song ""Moonshot"" into a fractured fairy-tale. Britta coos fine curtains over Wareham's lower register on ""Hear the Wind Blow"", and trades Mary Tyler Moore references on ""Ginger Snaps"", a lightly danceable counterpart to The Postal Service for the demographic that hasn't yet embraced the laptop as musical instrument. Her own minutes in the spotlight, the self-penned ""Out Walking"" and ""Your Baby"", are somewhat less engaging, with Phillips taking on a torch-singer role a bit too familiar next to Wareham's Grandpa Hipster persona. ""Knives From Bavaria"", a Him song for Her vocals pays off better, with bedroom vocals and flitting drum programming. Like all Luna family projects, L'Avventura has a sneaky way of getting its claws into you-- background music that gets stuck in your forebrain. But also like most Luna product, this little vacation from the less-talked about half of the band starts to bend under its own uniformity of mood somewhere in the second half, and probably would've been slightly better acclimated to EP length. The Silver Jews cover ""Random Rules"" is a perfect fit for Wareham's style, but maybe loses half a point for being a bit too easy (and similar to the original); the obscure ""Threw It Away"" and The Doors' ""Indian Summer"" both sound slight, with little input from Phillips. Fortunately, the stronger material on L'Avventura is largely front-loaded, so you can go ahead and doodle on the outer margins of your disc with no great loss. Even with the excess, the album hits the perfect tone for that summer romance you've been planning, or conversely, for inducing ulcer pains and crying fits in the recently dumped. So while it's usually more rewarding to hear a couple going all Stevie & Lindsay through their music, Dean & Britta's Sonny & Cher act is hardly a vanity project between two rock stars that are maybe/maybe-not deep in lurve.",,7.6,
Plague Soundscapes,The Locust,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd31ea9e61561daa7664/1:1/w_160/4c87b69b.jpg,2003-06-23 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4822-plague-soundscapes/,Anti-,"Water turns to blood; prize farm animals keel over dead; darkness and disease cloak the earth; hail rains from the skies; frogs arrive with small armies of lice and flies and locusts; and just when shit seems impossibly fucked, you have to fend off that nagging death plague by splashing lamb's blood on your stoop. That notorious run of bad luck already went down once, way back in the day, but in Spring 2003, The Locust are kicking it Moses-style once again, prophetically offering an aural equal for Jehovah's Old Testament punk-slap. Those witnessing this cataclysm for first time might like to know that The Locust, a once-five-now-four-piece have been kicking around SoCal since 1995, and though this is only their second full-length, they've managed to keep busy with related projects: everyone but keyboardist Joey Karam plays in the dentally inclined Holy Molar, bassist Justin Pearson's in Some Girls, and drummer Gabe Serbian's was, until recently, a member of both the meaty, super-speedy death metal band Cattle Decapitation and Alec Empire's backing band. And then there are the members' humble beginnings in seminal hardcore (or just plain hard) bands like Swing Kids, Struggle, Crimson Curse, etc. Over the past eight years, The Locust have opted for spatial concision and elaborate packaging for their releases, and though things go out of print all the time, there are (and were) splits of many sizes with Man Is the Bastard, Melt-Banana, and Arab on Radar; a self-titled seven-inch and another self-titled twelve-inch; a five-inch picture disc split with Jenny Piccolo; a double twelve-inch with remixes of ""Well I'll Be a Monkey's Uncle"" by Kid606, I Am Spoonbender, Christoph de Babalon, and others; a reissue of 2001's Flight of the Wounded Locust EP on four seven-inches that fit together like a puzzle; and finally, this brand-new 21-track CD clocking in at under 21 minutes. And though they sport tight bug suits, rest assured: this music is no joke. Similar in a sense to the now-defunct American spazcore band Behead the Prophet No Lord Shall Live (who, incidentally, took their name from Deicide's Legion), The Locust locate themselves within a downpour of musical over-determination, attention-deficit-disorder time restraints, and a nod-nod, ha-ha twenty-something sexual irony sealed in a rapid-fire hardcore assault. And in a serious case of coincidence, Behead the Prophet's vocalist took the stage name Joshua Plague some years ago while fronting The Mukilteo Fairies. Ah, Plague! Listening to The Locust's Anti Records debut, I was thinking how nice it'd be if these 23 songs weren't referencing the good book at all, and were instead a tribute to the great, under-appreciated screamer behind two rad bands, and his smart-ass gay politics and hilarious And Now I... zine series. Alas, independent rock tosses aside history constantly. As much as I want to hold out for beautiful in-scene props, I imagine the nod wasn't intended. Whatever the theme, Plague Soundscapes is among the band's fiercest work yet, and stands as their most sinisterly melodic to date. Clearly attuned to their genre's precedents, the band produces long song titles for tiny bursts of noise: ""Halo of Pubic Hair and Earwax Manufactured for the Champion in All of Us"" is 58 seconds, and ""Late for a Double Date with a Pile of Atoms in the Water Closet"" but 45. When the band does lock into an epic jam like the minute-plus ""Twenty-Three Lubed Up Schizophrenics with Delusions of Grandeur"", they make certain the sounds remain spastically off-kilter within various densities and layers of drones and lasers and accelerated mosh parts. Elsewhere, ""Anything Jesus Does, I Can Do Better"" clocks in at 1:29, spitting up code amid crunchy headsmashing and ends with a blissful Yars' Revenge raga. Showing a bit of noisy growth, the robots-do-battle instrumental ""Can We Please Get Another Nail in the Coffin of Culture Theft?"" is Pork Queen/Trackshun pretty. Throughout Plague Soundscapes there's lots of high-end scratching, romping double-bassdrum (the opening of ""Solar Panel Ass"" is as heavy as Slayer), faux-explosions, more than a dozen non-standard noisemakers, claustrophobic keyboard blasts of bodily fluids and dislodged earwax, and vocalist/bassist Justin Pearson's incessant snarl-- all expansive while remaining aesthetically lodged within the confines of hardcore. Obviously, The Locust aren't singularly reinventing music, but it could be said that Plague Soundscapes is, along with a handful of similarly minded bands, redefining hardcore, and with a modicum of pretentiousness. Sure, the shit's a bit inaccessible-- the guys are just bashing this stuff out-- but there's never a shred of elitism. Christ, it's four dudes with no faces squeezing into tight pants and feigning murder on the dancefloor. And you hear it in every note they play: The Locust simply love what they do. With Plague Soundscapes, The Locust shot for broken bones and wound up epitomizing ""breakneck.""

Take Your Skin Off,Mindflayer,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43413d197565213beda/1:1/w_160/218561d6.gif,2003-06-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5543-take-your-skin-off/,Bulb,"It's amazing what a little raw power will do for your senses. Over the past couple of years, indie's courtship of the dancefloor has gotten so much coverage, I'd almost forgotten there was once a time when post-hardcore looked like the most interesting subtext on the underground horizon. Looking back, I guess there was a spectrum of activity along those lines, with, say, Fugazi on one end, and Neurosis on the other, their endgames resulting in almost-but-not-quite ""alt-rock"" and almost-but-not-quite ""ambient"", respectively. There were also a few hundred bands in between that could be shoved like round pegs into whatever square hole critics needed to use to prove their point. My point? If there's a common thread among bands that once played hardcore and went on to do other things, maybe it's that despite whatever changes, they rarely end up in a commercial spot. I'm not complaining, mind you. This year, when Wonderful Rainbow finishes in the top 20 of the Pazz & Jop poll, I will be among the first to offer my congrats to the Providence band. It takes some doing to turn out a record containing a brick wall of metallic oppression and still have folks clamoring for more. Still, I'd be surprised if Lightning Bolt's sound (or that of any Load act) translated into any kind of mainstream popularity. Even in the glory days of early 90s radio rock, when you might hear Helmet, Pantera and Nirvana in a row, aggression only mattered if the hooks backed up the noise. Ten years later, the hard have become harder-- but arguably even further removed from breaking through to the other side. Truthfully, I might not even bring it up were it not for records like Take Your Skin Off, because I'm sure mass popularity is the last thing on these bands' minds. However, if Lightning Bolt represents the anthemic and inclusive, Mindflayer is a small but potent ""fuck off."" Formed in 1996, and hailing from the same Providence, Rhode Island scene that produced Lightning Bolt, Arab on Radar and Black Dice, Mindflayer understand the benefits of raw power. The duo-- jack-of-all-electronics Matt Brinkman (Forcefield) and drummer/vocalist Brian Chippendale (Lightning Bolt)-- play a jagged mixture of No Wave-informed torture rock, hard beats, with an almost psychedelic command of disorientating squeals, squelches and microphone feedback. Their sound is related to LB, though without a bass, there is an obvious emphasis on crackly, grating textures. Prior to Take Your Skin Off, the band had released a few CD-Rs, decidedly unpolished but rarely lacking in intensity. On their first proper recording, they make no bones about tearing shit up, and if you can handle a little drug-induced strangeness alongside the tried and true Providence power, it's a fun ride. The coolest stuff happens when they opt for variation over oppression: ""Gold Lake Spiller"" starts on a percussive pounce, but quickly dissolves into what sounds like the death of a saxophone. Chippendale hammers out a pulse on the toms, and the massive electro-drone emitted from Brinkman's machinery transforms what might have been aimless skronk into the soundtrack of the inner workings of a jet engine. Likewise, the epic ""You're Dead at the Bottom of a Dungeon"" (possible reference to their namesake's RPG origins?) begins with the ornery hum of a generator of some kind, and random interjections from Chippendale over his trademark contact mic. This intro does little to prepare me for the violent, messy onslaught of raging drums and the sound of synthesizers being used to bludgeon via cyclical whipping noises. Then, the real hell breaks lose, as the beat is tightened, but only in service of two or three laser beam cannons and a gigantic BZZZZZZZZZ. Ah yes, and then it gets interesting: Chippendale gets fed up with the grade school shit, and drops a mad multi-meter thing over which Brinkman decides his buzz-saw computer could do some pretty good damage. When the groove becomes apocalyptic disco, the squeaky space cannons go off, and we have a symphony of noises Robert Moog never intended his creations to make. Unsurprisingly, large stretches of the record are going to sound pretty familiar to anyone paying attention to the Load, Bulb and like-minded rosters. ""Take Your Shoes Off"" takes its hip-hop meets Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" beat and wrings a little chaos out of it via moaning synth-bass and more offhanded sermonizing from Chippendale. It leads directly into ""Head of State on A Plate"", with its persistent tribal tom-tom pattern, omnipresent, distorted high-pitched ringing and bass hits. Like much of Take Your Skin Off's first half, these tunes are good examples of a sound that rocks OK, but might not necessarily call anyone to arms. Oddly enough, there does seem to be a sort of political mini-concept at work here too, to which ""Head of State on A Plate"", ""Drop Bass Not Bombs"", ""Wind War III"" and ""Everyone Dies (We Won Anyway)"" might attest. For the greater part of an hour, the band maintains a high energy level, though when the basic elements of your sound involve howling factory distortion, things can tend to get a tad monolithic. Fans of any band connected to Mindflayer will have much to rejoice over here, and if by some chance you haven't yet been introduced to the Providence sound, you could do much worse. Nevertheless, as totally uncompromising, hardcore noise rock goes, I'm sometimes left a little cold. It's one thing to bust up a party with raw power, but people only stick around for the straight jams.","It's amazing what a little raw power will do for your senses.

Cedars,Clearlake,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5edc0084474cd0c0832/1:1/w_160/0c472d70.jpg,2003-06-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1495-cedars/,Domino,"In A Few Late Chrysanthemums, poet laureate John Betjeman recalls an anonymous childhood while observing shuttles of children on the Sussex coast. During his vivid flashback, a pack of sun-thirsty bullies shove a schoolboy, wearing ""shivering shorts,"" into the asphalt. Betjeman holds the antagonists in rancorous contempt, brand-name addicts who serve as irrefutable proof that the Devil walks amongst us. Domino four-piece Clearlake call the same Sussex coast home, and sound like the sort of kids in shivering shorts whose skin thickened from playground pushes. But instead of marveling under the iron ribs of St. Pancras or hunting Cornish abbeys-- as did Betjemen, who vented through art and eventually found solace in Britain's spiritual architecture-- Clearlake construct their own echoing places of worship in Cedars, with some help from the Cocteau Twins' Simon Raymonde. With the band's arcane 2001 debut, Lido, behind him, lyricist Jason Pegg clouds his nostalgia with fear and devilry. As drums clap like pew-kneelers under buttresses of strings on ""The Mind Is Evil"", Pegg warns like a grimacing choirboy, ""it makes me do all those unspeakable things."" This veiling of coal-colored sentiment in majestic settings runs through every track. In ""Keep Smiling"", the lines ""Just nod your head accordingly and do the opposite of anything they tell you"" mirror Thom Yorke's Hail to the Thief manifesto, but Pegg's de-politicized subversion strikes harder-- as unlike Yorke's reaction against the obvious, with his willingness to point the finger inward to less-admittable wickedness. Elsewhere, processional whipcracks of percussion and paint-chipped baby grands drive him to admit ""I wouldn't hurt a fly, but I'd really like to punish you"" on ""I'd Like to Hurt You"", suggesting that any of us can snap under pressure-- whether that pressure results from government, the anxious Zeitgeist, or ex-girlfriends, Pegg doesn't say, but the universal ambiguity of his sentiments injects the music with a raw and timeless nature. The inherently uplifting alto in Pegg's lucid, lachrymose throat reverberates touches of Tin Pan Alley, layering Clearlake's sound beyond the typical moping of today's frontmen. One can almost picture him singing these songs to a starlet as he ambles across an opera-house stage. Chopped-up streaks of a flanged keyboard even whip through ""Almost the Same"" like stagehands hustling backdrops in Rodgers and Hart's Autobahn: The Musical. Throughout Cedars, Clearlake continually find beauty in melancholy and melancholy behind beauty, while raising your hairs in reverence with occasional guitar squalls. Murals of feedback, keyboards, and chanting close in around ""Come into the Darkness"". As Pegg inverts the Golden Rule into a mantra of selfish motivation on ""Treat Yourself with Kindness"", lurching chords burst up the walls like shadows springing in sudden bold bars of light through stained glass. The drama segues into the closing hymn of ""Trees in the City"", where hope is found in the resilient growth of greenery in a smoky metropolis. Betjeman too bemoaned the ""Motopolis"" that choked the charm from Oxford and the suburban sprawl of Slough with the blackest of humor. The British love to honor through a lacerating wit. It seems almost as if modernity is tolerated only with the thought that one day humanity will lose and the English countryside will expel the scars of society. Sauron will fall. Clearlake fit into this tradition as true patriots. While Lido may have been a last bastion of Britpop, Cedars towers in the tradition of the best British art.","In A Few Late Chrysanthemums, poet laureate John Betjeman recalls an anonymous childhood while observing shuttles of children on the ...

No More Wig For Ohio,Odd Nosdam,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba359d034d5c69bf53ee/1:1/w_160/77ff3be4.jpg,2003-06-22 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6088-no-more-wig-for-ohio/,Anticon,"It must have been the crackly, no-fi production that made Odd Nosdam sound so unreachably weird all those years. He had the requisite demented imagination to put those creepy backdrops into cLOUDDEAD-- like deserts swept with worn-out electrical storms-- and ""Eviction Notice"", that track he did for Sage Francis, was the scariest nightmare a kid ever had. But it was the rough crackle of vinyl and cheap reproduction that clinched it: Odd Nosdam's productions sounded like they'd been made on a tape recorder fished out of the trash; broke-ass, unreliable and stained by everything that had gone through the alley he was creeping through when he found it. It sounded like personal history, and nothing's weirder than that. So right away, his second full-length sounds suspiciously clean. These twenty-four untitled instrumentals aren't as random as the collages on his Split EP with Why?, as hostile as Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist, or as atmospheric as the cLOUDDEAD beats: for the first time, it sounds like he sat down in a good studio and carefully assembled a record. That's good, in that Odd Nosdam's production rode out the lo-fi thing for exactly long enough before moving on; but it's also a disappointment, because the new work isn't far off from where he was before-- it recycles a lot of his ideas with none of his usual edginess. The first half of the record flashes his sense of humor and kitsch-fetish. He's funny when he plays crappy Sunday School records; it's still a laugh when he drops heavy jack-boot beats on top of a silly or tacky song-- ""Fish Heads"" in one case, some goofy polka in another. Track six uses a 50s-era demonstration record for the Magnus Electric Chord Organ: a salesman is showing some rubes how to play, but the minute they touch the organ Odd Nosdam subs in thick, funky chords and beats. It's an obvious ""stomp on something square with something hip"" joke, but it still works for me-- and the fat, blatting chords are the meatiest music on the record. That's also one of the ""funkiest"" tracks on an album that leans as much on oom-pah beats and random style-jumps as ""straight"" hip-hop. Like a collage of soundtracks to old TV commercials he mixes eccentric voices and cheesy exotica, sometimes cutting abruptly but not so much as to suggest a deficient attention span. It sounds like it's building to something exciting-- but he falters. When the polka on track eleven gives way to a slow, shimmering setting of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", the record takes a turn underwater: the music moves like a submarine, lurking with just its periscope poking out to show a sign of life. The last twelve tracks meander at a plodding tempo that comes off as samey, even murky. With strings and beats here, moaning electronics there, each piece is carefully arranged but tame. Track twenty-one's hostile melody and militant beats leap out next to the other, more passive cuts, but all together the pieces are too methodical, like he's just working through the DJ Shadow Exercise Workbook. It wouldn't be constructive to criticize the record for not sounding ""weird"" enough, though that's always been part of Odd Nosdam's appeal-- the sheer inventiveness and constant development of his voice. No More Wig For Ohio takes a step forward in craftsmanship and patience, and it's a tighter and more accomplished record than the random, sometimes hard-to-digest bedroom recordings that started his carer. But it also lacks the tension: the juxtaposition of novelty vinyl with atmospheric horror, or the disorientation of his collages. Even his less successful albums were more gripping-- and more personal. No More Wig For Ohio cops out on its more tantalizing promise of something more sinister below the surface-- all this disc really tells us is that Odd Nosdam's a solid DJ who likes doofy vinyl.","It must have been the crackly, no-fi production that made Odd Nosdam sound so unreachably weird all those years.

"Of Things Too Sorrowful to be Reminded of, and Things Too Beautiful to Possess",Badgerlore,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f49d034d5c69bf2a9d/1:1/w_160/a8b741c2.gif,2003-06-22 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/524-of-things-too-sorrowful-to-be-reminded-of-and-things-too-beautiful-to-possess/,Free Porcupine Society,"Badgerlore's first full-length emits the whisper of a fragmented forest. Alternating heartrending drone and quietly affecting folk carved by taciturn hermits, Of Things Too Sorrowful to be Reminded of, and Things Too Beautiful to Possess speaks through distant symbols, inky clouds, and thin pine-needle patterns on the floor. According to the sliver of black paper attached to the scorched-leaf sleeve, Rob Fisk and Ben Chasny spent five or so years collecting the spare coal-scented sounds contained here: written in Alaska and California, they recorded each section in California on a 4-track between 1998-2003 with only a couple of overdubs, using two guitars, two amplifiers, an organ, a violin, and miscellaneous bells and sticks. Far from anonymous backwoods strummers, Fisk is a co-founder of Deerhoof and spent six years in the band. He left after Halfbird (which preceded last year's acclaimed Reveille), moving to Alaska with his wife, former Deerhoof keyboardist Kelly Goode. There, they built a log cabin. When they cozied themselves they started the art-pop band 7 Year Rabbit Cycle and got the idea for their Free Porcupine Society record label. Ben Chasny is the wonderful, acid-folk Six Organs of Admittance: he and Fisk have been friends for years, using Badgerlore recording sessions as an excuse to get together, to notch bits of beauty into their ongoing collaboration. (For you completists, they also have a split CD called Three Owls - Six Ears with A Warm Palindrome and Feverdreams, which was released on Betley Welcomes Careful Drivers a couple of years ago). The closest analogue I can pin to these largely improvised guitar duets is Sidereal Rest, a collection of muted firefly music released in 1995 by the Vancouver-based label Scratch. That compilation featured otherwise noisy bands like Noggin, Pork Queen, and Caroliner making bedtime music alongside seminal underground stalwarts like US Saucer, Paste, Loren Mazzacane, Thinking Fellers, and Bugskull. Badgerlore's work could be transplanted anywhere into Sidereal Rest and make sense sonically: a document to cozy-to when the late-night humming of rogue cloud formations keep you from getting shuteye. Their earthy commune music might also be compared to less-vocal Woven Hand, Doldrums, the Blithe Sons' apocalyptic-minded cousins, warped-out Alan Bishop, Skullflower's organic-farming neighbors up the road. ""Prayer"", the briefest of the ten tracks, layers tapping wood, ringing bells, and a male Sara Vaughan invoking wood spirits with a twisted, slow-core hillbilly raga. ""Culling The Fire Lions"" uses the ancient feedback of Nurse With Wound/Current 93 to investigate veiny lines on crumbling leaves, to call forth a purifying agent to clear the slate of good and bad. In the noisy ""A Girl's Mouth In Winter"" a stricken voice intones: ""We yell in her mouth, but nothing comes back/ Her tongue and eyes look straight past me/ And in the springtime, she asked for a glass of water/ And everyone cried."" It's a redwood falling over, weighed down with too much ice, space, and memory. On ""The Ruiner"", spare vocals commingle as a lovely duet over a crumbling bell; listening close, I could feel my beard growing cold with hoarfrost. On their signature anthem ""Folk Music For No One"", I see two guys buried beneath a blanket giving prayers to the gods of dew, raggedly dancing. ""It's Cold, it's dark/ But we plant in a month"" recalls Seattle's Climax Golden Twins, a man who fell in love with the moon, poetry painting the human spirit as charcoal; it also creates the album's biggest groove. For the most part, Badgerlore resist that sort of coalescing, and I'm always impressed by folks who avoid the tendency to resolve into a hook: by nature, it's more difficult to avoid catchiness than to succumb to it. Towards the end of the album, the delicately fucked Wiccan church music of ""Listen, Loved Ones"" commands gently, ""Loved ones, find a safe place to view this digrace/\xA0Hold each other tight through the dark night..."" In the future, I'm sure they'll gather together their blackened embers, build a happier fort, and escape to a higher vantage point; here, these pipers at the gates of dusk are holed up against the the witching hour, creating beauty within a crumbling, musky night.","Badgerlore's first full-length emits the whisper of a fragmented forest.

Shivering King and Others,Dead Meadow,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cbb1335d7bf1699380/1:1/w_160/c8bb3121.jpg,2003-06-22 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2214-shivering-king-and-others/,Matador,"""DR. STEERE!!!"" The backhoe shrugged mechanically in the student's hand as she cried out for the professor to come and see what she had forcefully unearthed. Though Steere and his group had been digging in the river basin for the past 30 days, aside from a few common artifacts, the main object of their search continued to elude them. Taking care to remove the crystallized sludge surrounding the prize, he finally saw it-- the skeletal remains of what appeared to be a musically oriented tribe, known as Dead Meadow, if one followed the stencil on the still half buried drum set, huddled around a central egg-crate of ancient vinyl albums and compact discs. Cataloguing the records to maintain provenience, the dig-team ran into the exact same stratigraphical paradox that Dr. Steere had predicted: in an era of music where fast-paced dance tracks and flashy production techniques ruled, how did it come to pass that a collection like this could have influenced this group of musicians? While it was no surprise to find Blue Cheer's Vincebus Eruptum, Jimi Hendrix's Axis: Bold As Love, and Led Zeppelin II in the cinched arms of a creature a few meters below Dead Meadow's remains, it was quite a shock that any group of their time was swallowing and potentially outputting this style of music. A great boon to his research, Dr. Steere soon discovered that atop the assortment of music was a compact disc produced by Dead Meadow themselves, the group's Brendan Canty-engineered third album, Shivering King and Others. Finding an old player he had recently salvaged from an electronics boutique, Steere was eager to hear how well-- if at all-- the group was able to integrate and build upon the work of the late 60s/early 70s, an era they appeared to hold on high. ""I Love You Too"" certainly seemed to encapsulate the musical ideals of their inspiration, building upon a heavy Sabbath riff before Jason Simon's nasal vocals threaded deep into the mix with lyrics characteristic of the fantasy-filled air about the band. ""Babbling Flower"", ""Everything's Going On"", and ""Good Moanin'"" exhibited a similar style of stomp-and-circumstance, outfitting their sound with wah-heavy guitar solos worthy of a dirty Dinosaur Jr., and a tinge of far-eastern derived psychedelic rock. Steere choked back a cry of surprise as the opening chords of ""Wayfarers All"" heralded the quiet and unexpected onslaught of an acoustic track isolated amidst the growing homogeneity of ""The Whirlings"" and the meaty drone of ""Golden Cloud"". The track put together the missing pieces of the band's problematic and massive Neil Young jones, particularly the worn grooves of Zuma. Though incredibly short, the song manages to appropriately prepare the listener for the similar acoustic leanings of ""Shivering King"", exercising some of the prettiest harmonic ornamentation found on the album. This initially light melodic line is eventually overtaken by an undulating drum pattern and fuzzy-bass that serves as an interesting counterpoint to the introduction of various high-end guitar techniques. Jaw resting on fist, Dr. Steere grew weary near the end of the composition, nodding off at least twice during the fourteen minutes that comprise the final two tracks ""Heaven"" and ""Raise the Sails"". While the sitar sounds of the former and the Sonic Boom-drone of the latter did create an interesting soundscape for the album's climax, the sameness of the music had become irritating after an hour. Steere eventually found himself questioning the group's reasons not to trim some of the excess fat, but he was won over by the consolation that such invariability only further highlighted the musical bond the group has with the virtuosic pomp of its idols. Weaned on the tenets of ""Dinosaur Rock"", Dead Meadow does put too much stock in the belief that more truly is more, resulting in drawn-out passages not unlike those that plagued nearly all of the artists they worship. But they succeed in their drive to not merely reproduce but improve, beefing up their sound with influences ranging from post-rock to black-metal, proving that one doesn't need an army of synthesizers and fashion consultants. Dead Meadow embodies the modus behind archaeology: in order to move forward, it's sometimes necessary to look back.","""DR. STEERE!!!""

Vigil,Oren AmbarchiMartin NG,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0729d034d5c69bf2702/1:1/w_160/811c177b.gif,2003-06-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/150-vigil/,Quecksilber,"You would think that a record by two Australian players-- guitarist Oren Ambarchi and turntablist Martin Ng-- would be an example of individual maximalism on par with their native country's history of easily quantified musical exports. Their pedigree involved playing in John Zorn's Cobra game few years ago, and the asinine noise of Mr. Ambarchi's early group Phlegm boasted record titles like Mr. Hoo Ha Visits the Non-Stop Pissing Circus. Ng was also half of the Mego macro-DJ duo, gcttcatt, a severe shredding and scratching of the very blocks of bit sound itself. Both men have collaborated with the likes of Phill Niblock, Keith Rowe, Otomo Yoshihide, and Phillip Jeck. You'd think Vigil would be as predictable as a bad Foster's commercial, but you couldn't be more wrong. Their second record as a duo continues with emanations along the lines of 2001's Reconnaissance, in that each player's ego and identifiable sound is instead reduced to its most base elements, that of pure sound glow, as warm and low as tube-amp heat, alternating blue and orange radiation. ""Vigil"", a three-part suite of suspension, opens as a distant storm warning alarm, reaching our positions as a small drone. The sound grows naturally as slowly kindled feedback from, either guitar or record cartridge, before it's passed to and fro in a slow game of catch with a fragile plasma ball. But is it Ambarchi with metal rubbing his amplified strings or is it Ng crab-walking on a cymbal? Their telltale gestures get lost in the nebulous nature of the moment. Whose sound is whose is beyond determination: the duo radiate as one fuzzy entity, and probing into boundaries between the two is pointless. Such heady analysis into the origin of these sounds would only affect your interaction with its gentle, though resolute ripples of sound particles. The most isolated sound event is a chime at the second part of ""Vigil"", and as it rings out, it becomes apparent that these men are complimentary Tibetan prayer bowls, assuaging the air itself with their rubbed metallic resonance and slowly walking through a cymbal wonderland, the sound clouds drifting past for twenty-one minutes. ""When Love Comes Back to Haunt You"" is more hum-mable as the closing piece, its nimbus readily discerned, a palpable form on the horizon moving ever closer. Augmenting the release are two accompanying videos from their previous record by digital artist Tina Frank (famous for her Mego cover art). Her color bars and pixilated mists twir like holy computer smoke along with the duo's flickering embers. Only when watching these frantic explosions do you realize that this is actually the work of a trio, which explains why classification of these noises-- distinction between individual contribution-- is so difficult, and ultimately moot. But Ambarchi and Ng aren't laughing at us: the serenity they create from such small bits of chaos assures me that they'd forgive any audience its apprehension.

Notwist,The Notwist,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43113d197565213bed3/1:1/w_160/6f532988.jpg,2003-06-19 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5844-notwist/,Rough TradeSubway,"Those of us marooned on the little chunk of rock known as the contiguous United States have had what can be politely described as a roundabout introduction to this group of German renaissance men. The first Notwist album to receive a proper stateside release (1995's 12) was actually their third; the US version of 12 featured a very minor radio hit-- at least in the New England area-- called ""The Incredible Change of Our Alien"" (befitting all this convolution, the track was actually a remix of a track from the Notwist's 2nd album, Nook, greedily appended to our version of 12). Soon after Shrink (1998), the Notwist found themselves without American representation when their label Zero Hour went belly up. Had Zero Hour not cashed in its chips, there's a fine chance that the hubbub that rightfully enveloped the band's 2002's Neon Golden might have come four years earlier. In yet another case of ""better late than never,"" the Notwist did finally receive their well-deserved props, which means most of their unavailable back catalog is sure to be re-released in America. I imagine the multitude of praise heaped upon Notwist-affiliated outfits such as Lali Puna, the Tied & Tickled Trio, and Console also played a part in this recent surge of interest; it's the Notwist's seamless combination of rock foundations with the IDM blips and jazzy squeals these ""side projects"" are known for that led people to take notice of the Notwist. Those with a vested interest in the group's origin have undoubtedly come across biographies that begin with some variation on, ""The Notwist began as a heavy metal/hardcore punk group..."" Anyone undeterred by this statement, still itching to get your hands on this album, hoping to find small bits-- even a hint of a hint of a hint of the casual eclecticism that embodies the excellence of the Notwist's last two albums-- might want to keep their money in the piggy bank for a little while longer. Those biographers playing fast & loose with genres weren't full of themselves: this record features a good helping of double bass drum action, consistent cymbal abuse, guitar fret squealing and wheedling, lots of chords chug-chug-chugging, and even a few spots where Markus Acher (he of the laconic Teutonic vocalizing) actually essays a few disgruntled ur-screamo barks. Suffice it to say that the kindler, gentler musical backdrops of modern-day Notwist flatter Acher's voice more than the band's headbanging material of thirteen years' past. Outside of one relatively jovial & chirpy track introduction (the first 60 seconds of Yatsura soundalike ""Seasons""), this album positions itself alongside the indie rock bastions that best approximated heavy metal via smashing the punk rock (just about anyone on Touch & Go circa 1993, a good number of now-forgotten bands on Homestead) and the current class underground bands not afraid to shove metal straight up your ass (Neurosis, Converge, and the Hydrahead roster). Once in a while, these two worlds collide-- the concluding track ""Nothing Like You"" would pass for pro-forma slack motherfucker-y were it not for the 30 seconds of bridging riffage thrown in at the 2:30 mark, and ""I've Not Forgotten You"" segues from apocalyptic anvil-banging into spry indie sprints. In some places, there's even a bit of loud fast ruling, Minneapolis style-- the soloing in ""Be Reckless"" could just as easily have come out of Bob Mould's Flying V as it could from some Aquanetted Yngwie disciple, and ""Think For Yourself"" wouldn't be out of place as an extra track on Everything Falls Apart (excepting the Dinosaur Jr. moves thrown in between fist pumps). Other tracks (""Is It Fear"", ""K. Das Devil"", ""One Wasted"") are less shameless about their affinity for rock of a harder vintage-- feel free to imagine the effect (deleterious or otherwise) Germany's biggest rock export, the Scorpions, had on these impressionable kinder. Notwist is an interesting confluence of guitar-rock influences, if the finer points might be lost on folks unable to get past the somewhat egregious presence of various metal tropes; it might prove even more difficult if one associates the fret runs and riffage with the set of Hot Topic chain wallet groups currently vying for their 2 spots on the TRL countdown, but that certainly doesn't mean it's not worth hearing. In light of what's followed, though, this album pales in comparison, and anyone dead-set on finding anything resembling recent Notwist high points like ""Pilot"" or ""Day 7"" would be better served waiting for the next Notwist album.","Those of us marooned on the little chunk of rock known as the contiguous United States have had what can ...

Nu Frequency,Seiichi Yamamoto,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab14b1335d7bf169979f/1:1/w_160/fe13cc0d.jpg,2003-06-19 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8893-nu-frequency/,Tzadik,"Too much information doesn't have to result in an overdriven feedback of static and confusion, though in music, it often does. Representing the onslaught of global culture, media and technology invite temptation to over-saturate, and though that may be one accurate portrait of the (post) modern world, I'm not sure it's the most realistic. Artists like John Oswald, John Zorn and Otomo Yoshihide have specialized in a kind of caricature of this world in their music: taking bits and pieces of information and entertainment around them, they pieced together rather intimidating documents of what would be a disorientating environment to say the least. Flashes of light, shrieks, blasts of electricity, jagged, jump-cut samples racing by before we know what hit us: if every night were New Years' Eve in Times Square, and all the while murder, childbirth and war were raging in the streets, this would be the perfect soundtrack. But every day is not like this. Former Boredoms' guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto seems to recognize the space in between the chaos. It's not for lack of activity in his world: in addition to 15-year stint with Boredoms, he has led his own bands Omoide Hatoba, Rashinban and Akabushi, and performed with Rovo, Most, Novo Tono and Ontoko. He also owns the influential Osaka club Bears where scores of hopeful young noise-addicts try to prove their dissonance on a nightly basis. Furthermore, Yamamoto has released a handful of solo guitar albums, wherein he joins the scratching-and-clawing ranks of fellow improvisers Fred Frith and Eugene Chadbourne. His musical experience is as varied as it is longstanding, and I wouldn't blame him for turning to skronk now and again. Nu Frequency, Yamamoto's fourth solo release, demonstrates that you don't need to explode into schizophrenic noise to run the gamut of lively sensations. Working with the excellent female drummer China, Yamamoto concocts a sprawling mix of free jazz-informed ensemble interaction, post-rock production (think To Rococo Rot, not Sigur Ros) and his own shimmering, restless guitar. Whenever a melody appears, it's quickly obscured by rogue percussion or a sudden bass spike. Throughout, rather than emphasize the traditional, he opts for the extreme, but instead of amounting to an hour of pummeling hysterics, Nu Frequency is a sustained journey into the unresolved and mundane. The ""frequency"" may be at times piercing, rumbling or soothing, but taken as a whole, Yamamoto's spectrum of sound is even-keeled and non-confrontational. After the short, shiny introduction of ""Convergence"", ""Acceleration"" comes on like a small orchestra of contemporary jazz spirits. China's ever-tapping cymbals propose a meter that isn't restricted by actual time, while multiple guitars noodle away in the distance. Synthesized flutes cry over deep, repetitive bass lines, both of which give way to Yamamoto's chord clusters. If it sounds like a mess, it's probably more than you think. Still, it strikes me as a perfectly natural distillation of just about everything the composer has been doing musically over the past few years, only all at once. ""Seed"" continues the off-kilter mix, but does offer a passive melody via guitars and a piano line that is somewhere between counterpoint and just being lost. Flighty, top-heavy percussion makes things seem more disorganized than they really are, and much in the same way Scott LaFaro's basslines gave Bill Evans room to stretch, Yamamoto offers himself ample canvas over which to splatter. There are moments of eclectic beauty, as on ""Yarn"", wherein the composer uses only a guitar to create a faint, calm tonality under which clicks, sputters and reverberated feedback dance like the last sparks of dying fire. In other hands, the balance of ambience and experimentalism might not hold, but here it's the model of poignancy. And of course, the album ends on a kinetic, drum-led track that wouldn't sound out of place on a Rovo disc-- I guess there's no accounting for flow. Nevertheless, for most of the album, you'll probably be able to drift off into near-trance without fear of reproach or noise explosions. Nice and uneasy.","Too much information doesn't have to result in an overdriven feedback of static and confusion, though in music, it ...

Passages Through,Landing,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc95eb335119a49eccce/1:1/w_160/24d396c8.jpg,2003-06-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4670-passages-through/,K,"In the past three years, Connecticut's Landing have released four rather different records on three labels. The band's debut Oceanless was filled with long, dreamy instrumentals that combined the Young-meets-dreampop bend of Windy & Carl with streaks of heavier stoner psychedelia. The follow-up full length Seasons saw them settling uneasily into soft, delicate slowcore territory, mixing lots of acoustic guitars with strained harmonies, verses and choruses. This year's Fade In Fade Out EP was a mixture of the two styles, with a pronounced lean toward the drones of Oceanless. Landing is prolific as hell-- several members have combined with Adam Forkner to record two Surface of Eceon records in the last two years-- but they're restless, trying to figure out how to tie their ideas together. On Passages Through, Landing is slowly finding a way to integrate their wistful, open-ended guitarscapes with proper songs. They've kept all of the melody and most of the structure of Seasons, but the singing is more accomplished if it's a bit further down in the mix. Most important, during the best moments of Passages Through, Landing have given tracks the space to wander when they need to; the album feels open, and unforced. The word ""experiment"" implies a certain amount of forethought and control-- this record that is about letting go. ""Close Your Eyes, Slowly"" is Landing perfectly realized. The drummer lays out for the first three minutes and allows two guitars-- playing overlapping scales in a repeating minimalist style-- to braid a rope to the clouds so that Adrienne Snow's voice, mixed just right to add an ethereal glow, might ascend into the mist. Adrienne's husband Aaron also sings in Landing, but the timbre of Adrienne's voice is better suited to the busier guitar songs, bonding nicely with the circular, heavily reverbed patterns the band favors. Another example is the first bit of ""Breathing"", which begins as a drifting, shapeless mass, her voice floating between the guitars without tune until the track settles into a serene drone, modulated by tremelo-bar ripples (it confidently stretches past 14 minutes). As a ""song"" it's about 80% coda, and that makes perfect sense for this style of music. The nine-minute opener ""Wings of Light"" also manages to combine hints of song with an appealing tangle of guitar drone. When constructing more disciplined pieces, Landing shows some signs of improvement. ""Hold Me Under"" shares the Low aspirations hinted at on Seasons, but comes closer to that high standard with tighter harmonies and a better melody. Still, the acoustic ballads remain Landing's sticking point. While the Adrienne-sung ""It is Shining"" is interesting enough in the way its wide-eyed folkiness harks back to early 10,000 Maniacs (an 80s sound few would touch these days), ""Wrapped Up in Flight"" and ""Tell Myself"" are pretty on the surface, but ultimately dull. When Landing sounds too relaxed and effortless, their music just seems strangely hollow, the indie guitar band equivalent of a Thomas Kincaid painting. Fortunately, such moments are rare enough on Passages Through.","In the past three years, Connecticut's Landing have released four rather different records on three labels. The band's ...

Rivers & Bridges,Steffen Basho-Junghans,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a22313d19756521387cf/1:1/w_160/39a36cec.gif,2003-06-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/575-rivers-bridges/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"It's a damn bold proposition to sit down with an instrument and some recording equipment, and just play, with the intent of making an album out of the session. That's precisely what Steffen Basho Junghans does for each of his albums, though; he just sets up and plays his acoustic guitars without so much as an overdub to hide behind nor a quick edit to cover his ass. He's so sure-fingered on the fretboard that it frequently sounds like there are two or three people picking away at the steel string, but it's always just him and his craft, which by this point (he's almost fifty years old), he's completely mastered. Junghans' solo acoustic pieces, written for both six and twelve-stringed instruments, are nothing if not deeply bound to the earth. Even his most esoteric, experimental work-- like last year's astoundingly inventive Waters in Azure-- has a deeply naturalistic feel to it; you can almost smell the forests of his native Eastern Germany in the pinpoint picking. Rivers & Bridges opens up with a twenty-two minute (!) meditation called ""The River Suite"", which while not strictly a suite, nevertheless embodies the flow of a river across miles of rolling terrain, to a tee. Rapidly cascading tremolo picking and sweeping strums burst like foam from rapids into the air, before the piece widens out , flattening for a lazy roll through less dramatic surroundings. ""The River Suite"" is complemented by another lengthy piece called ""The Takoma Bridge Incident"", an obvious reference to John Fahey's label, which nurtured the early careers of such acoustic guitar visionaries as Robbie Basho (to whom Junghans pays tribute, taking his name as a part of his own), Leo Kottke, and Fahey himself. These guitarists (and a few others like Sandy Bull, and perhaps Ry Cooder) are the most obvious point of comparison for Junghans' own work, but rather than simply walk in their footsteps, he continues their quest to push the very boundaries of the acoustic guitar. To this end, his work also frequently calls to mind the classical music of India, with its narrow harmonic scope and constant pedal points. For all its myriad permutations, ""Takoma Bridge"" remains incredibly consistent in the scales and chords it employs; the best section is a brief but breathtaking passage where he drops in brilliantly bright harmonics for color-- acoustic guitar harmonics sound so rich on a twelve-string, and he uses the instrument's resonance to his full advantage. Four shorter pieces round out the record, and each is masterfully executed in its own way. ""Rainbow Dancing"" (the other piece written for twelve-string) is very Appalachian in the way it blends a hesitant verse with rolling, dramatically articulated chord changes in the intervening sections. ""Hear the Winds Coming"" is yet another example of Junghans' facility for literal titles, as the first chords really do sound like the wind kicking up in great, dusty gusts. And ""Epilogue"" is just plain pretty, highlighting the simple pleasure of unadorned playing like little else I've heard since Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey"" sweetened the second side of Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow. I'm curious as to how Junghans will be viewed in another twenty years, because I see him as the logical inheritor of the original Takoma ethos, and he's certainly the most consistent practitioner of it since Basho and Fahey both passed on early. Rivers & Bridges, for its part, doesn't so much move the acoustic guitar forward as encapsulate much of what the instrument can do in an accessible manner. It's a beautiful album, and solo acoustic music doesn't get much better than this.","It's a damn bold proposition to sit down with an instrument and some recording equipment, and just play, with ...

The Ascension,Glenn Branca,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37cb1335d7bf169873a/1:1/w_160/708b6c39.jpg,2003-06-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/909-the-ascension/,Acute,"I was teaching the Dwight highschoolers how to drunk-drive when I first heard The Ascension. ""When the vision's getting blurry, when you can't handle yer liquor or yer speed,"" I said, ""cover one eye and your head'll stop spinning. It takes that binocular dilemma right out of there so you can see straight. Visionary or not, it's easy to steer straight with only one eye working."" Glenn Branca knows nothing about this: he was never one to limit his vision. Seeing Rock out of one side and Academic out the other, the two only blurred together in his third eye. By 1981, Branca had already played in Rhys Chatham's Guitar Trio for four years, and had disbanded his No Wave groups Theoretical Girls and The Static to focus on larger movements for amplified guitar. He had even completed compositions like ""Lesson No.1"" and ""Dissonance"", bringing to light the possibilities for multiple guitars beyond the Molly Hatchet formations of the early 70s. But the group he assembled to play a rare tour of the States around 1980 would cohere in such a way as to make his most recent work to that point, ""The Ascension"", his most fully realized. Featuring David Rosenbloom from downtown group Chinese Puzzle, as well as future Sonic Youth guitar-beating beat Lee Ranaldo, the piece was scored for four guitars, bass, and drums; his sextet was Times Square neon and the ghost-light luminance of the city at 3 a.m. focused into a laser-like intensity. It was ferocity never seen nor heard before, not even on that coast-to-coast tour, where the guitars would slash it out on stage nightly, roaring alive like the 6 train, one-eyed through dank tunnels across the country. Trying to capture that essence in the elitist Power Station studio, even Ranaldo-- in his excellent liner notes for this reissue-- admits it was hard to recreate the actual beast. Whatever Weasel Walter was able to glean digital remastering from is unbeknownst to me, but this thing is fucking huge. You can sure bet Branca knows about driving drunk: he swerves about on these city streets between two musical extremes like a pilled-n-pompadoured Popeye Doyle on his way to the French Connection set. On one hand, he seems to be in the slow lane with all the Sunday drivers moving to Brahms and Buckner on the West Side Highway, making symphonic movements with the blinker on for miles before the turn. Riding on the Neu!-like toms of Stephan Wischerth and a bassline that lunges out like Drive Like Jehu, the four guitars in ""Lesson No.2"" quickly gain on traffic, buzzing and droning about 88 miles faster than anyone else clogging the lanes. It sounds almost reckless, as he steers and swerves the guitars into the other lanes, right at the oncoming lights of punk-crushed cars, weaving in and out of traffic, and then suddenly cutting down dark Chinatown alleys of urban rot. Your knuckles turn white, clinging to the door handles-- it feels so out of control, but every movement has been precisely laid-out. ""The Spectacular Commodity"" is precision defined, the massive guitars gleaming like metal and glass towers in a grand opening movement, its bass menacing the very foundations with a low rumble. The manic speed of the piece increases to white-hot levels of crashing, cacophonous overtone; from these bloodied guitar strings and twisted metal carnage you can discern not just the euphoric guitar bliss of everyone from Sonic Youth to My Bloody Valentine, but also the mighty crescendos of Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Black Dice, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, or whomever, here executed with a plasma-like energy and melodic/harmonic structure still light-years beyond the forenamed. ""Light Field (In Consonance)"" is as majestic as its title would suggest: guitars rain down like torrents from thunderclouds, but with a savagery typical of back alley stabbings. When the guitar strikes like sheets of lightning into these ascendant runs at the apex, it's as anthemic and all-powerful as anything I've ever heard from a six-stringed electric, in rock or any experimental context. I've had the symphony of the streets do a little winking dance in a light drizzle to Monk's solo piano playing before, I've had Ellington make the lights of Broadway glimmer and dance for miles. White Light/White Heat split my skull open with the cold cruelty of the last exit to Brooklyn, while Paul's Boutique foretold the coke-smoking pleasures of the Vice lifestyle ten years before I arrived. Daydream Nation carved out the skyscraper shapes and dungeon scrapes of the sewer below in sound, but none of these quintessential New York records made every single movement of the Gotham populous move as one quivering entity in my head as does Branca's finale, ""The Ascension"". Every step pounded out on concrete, every seeping bag of dragged garbage, every rat squeal, every metal-on-metal cry of the arriving train on the third rail, every disfigured bum, and all the echoing voices seem to be notated for these detuned guitars. The nasty city these compositions were birthed in appears no longer to be with us. A ghost city, seemingly isolated to Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrera videos, still haunts us as an ineffable layer over the cleaned city of Disney, as brutal and terrifying as the city has always been. She's never left; it's nice to have her back.","I was teaching the Dwight highschoolers how to drunk-drive when I first heard The Ascension. ""When\n\ the vision's ...

Blues Goblins,Blues Goblins,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32313d1975652138a0c/1:1/w_160/8d73e8ef.jpg,2003-06-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/824-blues-goblins/,Off,"In the High School of Regional America, the South's got all the musical cred. Sure, these days the Northeast has all the Industry power and all the hype-fueled products it produces, and other regions have their occasional heyday, but you can't front on the South-- that guy originated it all. Every so often, one of the other students tries to borrow some of the South's stature by osmosis; the Midwest pulled it off pretty well back in the day, and that exchange student England was practically humping his leg in the 60s & 70s. But it's the Northwest that's cultivating the strongest crush on the South today, that shy, skinny kid over in the corner, seeing in the South everything he's not. The first sign of this infatuation was Doug Martsch, who released an eponymous solo album of acoustic beer-bottle slide ditties last year, and now the scene reports another member exhibiting symptoms of Delta flu. This time around it's Sam Coomes, better known as the angry half of Quasi, who can be found doing the Clapton with a decathlon of blues numbers under the guise of Blues Goblins. One can only imagine the further ramifications of this upper Pacific obsession: will Elliott Smith change his name to T-Bone? Is Ben Gibbard's next ultra-hit collab going to be with Kenny Wayne Shepard? Now, this situation conjures up a whole lot of racial quicksand, a topic I'd just like to tree-swing over Pitfall-stylee, thank you very much (da naaaa, na na!). But I will put forth that it's not too unreasonable a claim to label indie rock and its sometimes-rampant EMOtions as the white blues, filled as it is with woman-done-me-wrong stories punctuated by tears falling on v-necks . And there's no denying Coomes is one of the best at this game, full of sing-along-able spite, with the implicit special effect that the very woman what done him wrong just might be the one keeping time in his band. But Blues Goblins raises the question of whether Coomes is really playing to his strengths in concocting an all-blues cover project. In Quasi he tends to let the lyrics lower the pH while he flicks them out in a cruel monotone; here he's forced to fling his voice around like a Frisbee to hit all those mournful blues notes. Coomes is also best known for playing (and humping) his organ, which makes it a quizzical move for him to embrace a genre where success is so contingent on fret skills. I'm no blues purist-- I'm not even much of a blues enjoyist-- but as I understand it, great blues overcomes the limitations and predictability of its form-letter structure through a certain kind of timbre, be it vocal or instrumental, that vividly expresses the musician's unique pain. Not to question Coomes' life experience, but his tools just aren't up to this task. In such unfamiliar territory, his voice sounds awkwardly pinched on standards like ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Hellhound on My Trail"", not unlike when George Harrison turned to the blues. Meanwhile, his guitar tone is home-recorded to a studied level of grittiness, but is largely wasted on leaden noodling-- sometimes double-tracked for twice the ineffectiveness!-- over Skip James' ""Drunken Spree"" or his own ""Pedro's Boogie"". These shortcomings are all reinforced by Coomes' doggedly faithful interpretations of most of these tunes, but even when liberties are taken, they're less than wise. Does Charlie Patton's intimate ""Spoonful Blues"" benefit from BOOM-BOOM drums? Did ""Rollin and Tumblin"" really need a six-minute free-jazz saxophone break, by a Zappa no less? Only ""I've Been Treated Wrong"", with its Organ of the Apocalypse breakdowns, finds Coomes bending the blues to his talents rather than vice versa. Besides this outlier, Coomes sacrifices originality for reverence on his Blues Goblins project, treating it less as creative inspiration than as a costume-- as might be deduced by his ham-fisted choice of a pseudonym with the word ""Blues"" in it. One wonders what the dividends might've been had Sam enlisted his ex-wife's cyborg-with-a-heart-of-gold drumming rather than his own, ahem, pancake-handed style, or if he had adapted the form more than emulated it. Or maybe, like all shy, skinny kids, the Northwest, he just needs to be confident in his own strengths as a musician, and realize that imitating the effortless coolness of the South will get him nowhere.","In the High School of Regional America, the South's got all the musical cred.

Happy Songs for Happy People,Mogwai,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37eeb335119a49ed712/1:1/w_160/320881eb.jpg,2003-06-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5367-happy-songs-for-happy-people/,Matador,"When the world comes to whatever ignominious end we choose, Happy Songs for Happy People will be playing somewhere. It'll be the instrumental soundtrack to everyone's collective thoughts of anger, resentment, acceptance, and then, ultimately-- after everyone's had time to reflect and make peace with whatever the hell it is they're trying to reconcile at that particular moment-- it'll also be the soundtrack to great big letdown of, y'know, the world ending. Tidal static washes will engulf the land; thunderous guitar peals will split the sky. As the Four Horseman gallop by, blasting this album at ear-splitting levels from their totally sweet sound systems, everyone will brace themselves for the dénouement; folks will all be waiting for that final burst of insight to make sense out of everything, and then guess what? Nothing. It's all over, just like that. Get your coats and go. All that storm and stress, and for what? Bummer, dude. At least it was exciting here and then. Still, what a gyp. For the amount of energy Mogwai spend painstakingly carving out wrenching emotional turmoil, lush interludes, and haunting Slint impressions, they've had no idea where to take it since the sensory overload of 1997's Young Team. More intrinsically left-brained types might have used all that overpowering intensity of purpose to cure cancer, or debt, or Staind; Mogwai, on the other hand, have a languishing surplus of potential. On their debut, they did the only thing they knew how: buried the listener deep under cascading avalanches of sound, using immersion to distract them from anything as trivial as a lack of direction. Following the praise heaped on Young Team, though, they seem to have found an unhealthy amount of restraint; subsequent albums (Come On Die Young, Rock Action) fell into a disconcerting pattern of majestic swells and faint departures. Hell, Rock Action barely even swells. \t Some would say they ""tightened up""; I'd say ""stiffened."" No matter how it's described, tighten something enough (any old thing, really) and common sense tells you it'll break. The good news is Mogwai may have learned that lesson just in time for Happy Songs for Happy People, but don't break out the earplugs just yet: if Rock Action put you to sleep, don't rely on Happy Songs... to get you up in time for a morning meeting. In many ways, this album is even more reserved than past efforts; at no point does anything surpass even the mild-mannered blast of ""You Don't Know Jesus"". The difference is that much of the extraneous instrumentation that sandbagged Rock Action is left behind, which means the measure of the meticulous craftsmanship that was beginning to hamper Mogwai is gone as well . A lone organ or piano often carries the melody through the album's quiet stretches, and the percussion is usually barely audible; for the first time, Mogwai have the delicacy necessary to stir without resorting to violent upheaval, as well as the added power of a lighter touch. It's a subtle distinction, maybe, but with every album, Mogwai is more and more about the details: the organic rise and fall of ""Moses, I Amn't"" is a cathedral dirge simplified to an unprecedented degree (by Mogwai's standards). Sparsely layered organs, strings, and exceedingly sparse, hollowed-out drumstick hits rise in waves that never quite crest, for once in perfect harmony with Mogwai's mournful undertones. It bleeds quietly into ""Kids Will Be Skeletons"", which in turn transitions into the brief crescendo of ""Killing All Flies""; the sweep is almost effortlessly natural. The song titles should give away what the wryly ironic album title doesn't. Surprise!-- this is a pretty goddamned grim album. Every time I hear Mogwai, I'm struck by what a miserable portrait they paint of Scotland, full of skeletonized children, dead flies and such; as usual, Mogwai's Happy Music... evokes similar imagery. The problem is that, in spite of much of the album's comfortable ease, the quieter tone and brooding atmosphere are burdened with even less interest in taking these songs somewhere, anywhere. We're left lost, mired in Mogwai's omnipresent gloom. Only the closing duo of ""I Know You Are, But What Am I?"" and ""Stop Coming to My House"" mercifully (and critically) avoid this. From ""I Know You Are..."", it's a steady progression through to the gradual dissolve of the final track's epic finish, offering closure (finally) with a sample of some very happy children (its emotional weight is adequately deflated by the carefree kids). I guess that's the joke, really: these so-called ""happy people"" must like uninterrupted spans of soul-crushing gloom in between rounds of concentration camp footage. Honestly, though, it's a rare, honest-to-god conclusion from these guys, and it at least punctuates the album in a clever manner if the rest of the songs don't fare as well. Mogwai still can't seem to figure out where they're going, but that problem is only extended over these tracks, as whole songs build on one another. The Stephen Kings of menacing post-rock, it seems that in absence of Young Team's glorious cacophany their tremendous build-up often comes to nothing. And it sounds as though they've come to terms with that.","When the world comes to whatever ignominious end we choose, Happy Songs for Happy People will be playing somewhere. It ...

Movement,Gossip,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf7f5e6ef959693233e3/1:1/w_160/ef8ead7f.gif,2003-06-18 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3534-movement/,Kill Rock Stars,"I'm supposing anyone who's read even a couple lines about this Arkansas-born, Olympia-based trio must know that their not-so-secret weapon is 22-year-old front-woman Beth Ditto, whose blistering, blues-reeling yowl has established some goddamn fully realized roots for the band's punk-inflected garage rock. It's Ditto who pushes the Gossip above the majority of their genre's not-so-great, middling pretenders. You need go no further than ""Nite"", the grinding opener on their second full-length Movement, to realize these shaggy, Ramones-loving stylistics are channel surfing Etta James, Janis Joplin, Bessie Smith, and dusty country roads-- not Nina Hagen, like so much of the pack. Ozark garage rock! Queer-positive Leadbelly! My adoration isx92t unadulterated. I do indeed like dirty, swaggering music, but beyond Ditto's substantial vocal prowess, the band doesn't often push the artistic envelope. I'm not stubbornly naïve enough to think every band needs to pull out the analog tape-loop machine and KK Null back catalogue, but when these guys opt to compliment Ditto's voice by swerving left and experimenting with their relatively bare instrumentation, the off-kilter results raise the band's output to a different level of sweet-home goodness. Conversely, when they stick hard and fast to standard formations, these enfant terribles lose steam and dissolve inertly into to the white-striped background. I grew up wearing a Royal Trux t-shirt and playing drums in a shaky teenage band that covered Flipper's ""Sex Bomb"". Ever since I was that high-school chump with a confused head for taking apart instruments, I knew half the battle with my beloved genre was overcoming similarity. The essential aspect of seminal noise-fuck bands like Pussy Galore and Royal Trux was a preternatural ability to incorporate punk and art-rock into standard 1960's garage and a lifetime of cribbed rhythm and blues. Sadly, at this point, even one side of Dial M For Motherfucker or Twin Infinitives still out-punches the entire oeuvres of so many of today's well-dressed hacks. I'm blabbering about composition because the cracks in the Gossip's straightforward sheen point toward a previously unseen horizon splattered orange, pink, and dark purple. What if they upped their already substantial ante by making their work more patchwork? Ditto's vocal acrobatics tank when the music behind her doesn't progress from Olympia style bass-less guitar mush backed by primitive drums. When you rely on one guitar you should take a nod from Mecca Normal: develop a mile-high stack of riffs. As of now, I'm left picking at guitar god scraps. Movement's best moments are transitions: the slice of guitar noise at the end of the beautifully distraught ""Yesterday's News""; ""Gone"" becomes an unaccompanied hand-clap sing-a-long at its coda, transforming the track into a wonderfully anonymous punk-rock spiritual; after a pause at the end of ""Light Light Sleep"", a repetitive guitar chops it up, and Ditto's notes explode, taking flight. Though there are only a few of these shifts in recording textures and gradations, these glitches in tonal quality impart a beautiful dissymmetry to the sermon, adding a muddy Tower Recordings underbelly to the band's approach. The Gossip sound best when flowing through lo-fi constraints: when they dox92t have a hi-hat, and the down-tuned guitar is missing string. When the music's boxier, Ditto's voice soars; when the guitar and bass evoke a boom-box recording, the muck of the dank room warps into a golden treasure trove. In the spirit of shitty recordings, I look forward to their upcoming live release on Dim Mak, which was culled from Non-Dead In NYC (a cassette the band ran only 50 copies of themselves). Maybe they could use that raw tape hiss and a razor blade to create a complexly recalibrated remix album? Whatever. Even if my experimental pipe dream doesx92t come to fruition, I really like it when people make music out of junk, and the Gossip do indeed concoct boozy sun-drunk music, its rust mined from anthills, rising rivers, dirty lemonade, and the brassy patches of grass in a broken southern sidewalk. I just wish the soul was as fractured.","I'm supposing anyone who's read even a couple lines about this Arkansas-born, Olympia-based trio must know that their ...

Prospect Park,James William Hindle,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0e6ea9e61561daa7cc1/1:1/w_160/3ce79f8b.gif,2003-06-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3872-prospect-park/,Badman,"Sooner or later, every neighborhood gets a song, and it's usually the song it deserves: MacArthur Park is as every bit hideous as ""MacArthur Park"". If we're to trust ""The Park Slope Song"" and others on James William Hindle's album Prospect Park, this musician-friendly Brooklyn neighborhood (where I happen to reside) is an almost disturbingly fine place to live. Apparently, it's like the new Haight Asbury or something. In fact, judging from the number of references to sunshine, birds, and other cheerily pleasant phenomena, it's closer to Michael Chabon's mythic Summerland than to any earthly location. This thesis is supported by the album's gossamer arrangements, featuring every instrument capable of issuing a gentle chime: mandolin, glockenspiel and the rest. Hindle sells you on a dippy Park Slope mythos previously peddled in the movie Smoke, and better than any realtor could, because he appears thoroughly sold on it himself. Woozily romantic, slighly soggy and by all indications dedicated to the members of the author's immediate family, ""Prospect Park"" is the definition of innocuousness. Hindle thanks Beachwood Sparks and a couple of erstwhile Elephant Six-ers in his liner notes, but he doesn't really belong with that crowd. I would rather place him-- cruelly, perhaps-- in the granola-folk school of Dar Williams, Lucy Kaplansky and Richard Shindell: consider him the lost fourth cryer in Cry Cry Cry. ""You Will Be Safe"" opens the album on a decidedly therapeutic note, albeit contradicted by churlish guitars. After the not-quite-jazzy ""Come Down Slowly"", Hindle makes the mortal mistake of starting a song called ""Leaving Trains"" with the riff and strum from Sheryl Crow's ""Strong Enough"". That the album recovers at all is testament to Hindle's songwriting and charisma. The two highlights here are ""The Country Song""-- not an actual C&W; number but rather a Simon & Garfunkel tune garnished with banjo-- and ""The Great Woodland Summer"". Picking things up halfway through the album, the song is fast by Hindle's languid standards, as well as surprisingly R.E.M.-ish-- although it has to overcome a monumentally dorky title and a couple of mewling licks toward the end, the kind Peter Buck wouldn't be caught dead with. It's a short affair-- 35 minutes-- but enough to finish while drinking your double capuccino. If I sound unenthused about the record, it's for the most part indie snobbery. We like our folk rock haunting (Nina Nastasia, Neko Case) or haunted by Brian Wilson. Hindle, on the other hand, seems genuinely happy to be here. And if you think he's irrepairably fixated on Park Slope, take solace in a song called ""Hoboken"": perhaps his next CD-length ode to the patterns of yuppie migration is already in the works.","Sooner or later, every neighborhood gets a song, and it's usually the song it deserves: MacArthur Park is as ...

Over the past decade (yes, the band is older than your cousin in the 3rd grade), they've managed to practically redefine hardcore punk while never really breaking free from their own self-created sound universe. The staggering consistency displayed in their run of releases is unmatched, even among their more intense countrymen Boredoms and Ruins. Some people say all their songs sound the same, and while I'm hardly willing to go that far, I will say that if intense tech-punk isn't your thing, you can safely avoid all of their records. The discerning listener will recognize small deviations in the formula over the years: gradual integration of electronics and post-rock production, longer songs, occasionally slower tempos. However, Yasuko O's voice is still way up in the stratosphere, Agata's guitar is still running laps around Eddie Van Halen's worst nightmares, and Melt Banana, for better or for worse, occupy the same place in the hearts of indie and experimental listeners everywhere as they have throughout their existence. The question is, do you still want to hear them turn out another record? Seeing them live is one thing, as like clockwork, every year they blow whomever might be sharing the bill with them off the stage. However, conventional wisdom (certainly not always to be trusted) says that one only needs so many Melt Banana discs. In this case, I'd say conventional wisdom had a very good point - but it doesn't account for everything. Like Teeny Shiny and Charlie before, Cell-Scape improves on just enough to be interesting for anyone curious, and probably another must-have for fanatics. I fall somewhere in between, and thus can recommend it with only the slightest caveat that if you hated the band before, it's not likely to change your mind. That said, there is quite a bit here to preach to the converted: impossibly speedy workouts like ""Key is A Fact That A Cat Brings"" and ""Like A White Bat in A Box, Dead Matters Go On"" remind me that there is no better band on the planet at ramming a punk jam down my throat. Additionally, it should be obvious that Melt Banana possess the best song titles in the business, and along with them, some of the coolest, sprawling poetic lyrics. ""Shield For Your Eyes, A Beast in the Well on Your Hand"" busts out of the gate with an almost nu-metal sense of pounding and over-engorged mix. Agata plays a nifty, surprisingly straightforward riff over Rika Mm's perpetually motive bassline. Yes, the lightspeed acrobatics return at the mid-section, but the new wrinkles are what distinguish Cell-Scape from its immediate predecessors. The most obviously new sounds occur on the one-two jab ""If it is the Deep Sea, I Can See You There"" and ""Outro for Cell-Scape"" that ends the album. The former tune begins as pro-forma MB speed etude, but just as suddenly transforms itself into an almost poppy piece of indie rock, with Yasuko defying all odds by actually singing! It's a very interesting move on their part, and perhaps foreshadows future strategies. Then again, the extended electro-ambience of ""Outro"" suggests that they'd rather be psyching it up with Yamatsuka Eye. It's actually a little reminiscent of the last track on Charlie wherein the preceding boisterous half hour was made null and void by a thick wall of impressionistic goo. Again, an interesting move, and one of the reasons I have no problem recommending the disc. I've hoped for a while that Melt Banana would drop their masterpiece, their grand statement to consolidate their power into a tightly wound critical mass. I see a few more people show up every time they come through town, and now is as good a time as any for them to really take off beyond the realms of fringe noise bands. Alas, though hardly a misstep, Cell-Scape is not that masterpiece. Nevertheless, I'm as tuned in as I ever was to their next move.","Going on five studio records, Melt Banana are at a crossroads.

Dragyn,Surface of Eceon,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e6c0084474cd0c0821/1:1/w_160/67d6d5ce.gif,2003-06-17 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7636-dragyn/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Surface of Eceyon (that's some of Landing working with Yume Bitsu's Adam Forkner-- heretofore known simply as Surface of Eceon) has a troubling weakness for D&D; mysticism. Their debut album, The King Beneath the Mountain, laid out a band mythology of an insect kingdom called Eceon where, if I understand correctly, I am a moth person (that would explain the attraction to bright lights) in some sort of bent narrative involving grasshopper royalty. Fortunately, on the surface of this place Eceon, as indicated on the sleeve, ""time and energy are blurred into a beautiful landscape of sound,"" which is definitely an idea I can get with. The story of the album is told instrumentally for the most part, through dreamy sheets of feedback and gurgling drones, so even though I parted ways with fantasy literature 20 years ago, I can follow. The band's second album is Dragyn (as in, ""dragon""), and it continues the tale, I guess. This time, there's actually a short prose narrative on the inside of the record dealing with Tussyans and Sephryns and assorted other Magic starter-deck rejects. I haven't read the story yet, and I doubt I ever will, but it's there if you're wondering what happens next. The extent of my interest in all this is that place where ""time and energy blur,"" so I'm going to talk about the sound. Though it definitely sounds like the same band as last time around, the feel of Dragyn is considerably different-- darker, spacier, more abstract. Dragyn was apparently assembled Can-style from recordings of extensive band improvisation; when walking the improv wire, Surface of Eceyon has a tense and restless vibe. There are no vocals this time, and the warmth of a song like the debut's ""The Open Sea"" is missed. What Dragyn delivers best is some effective passages of atmosphere, where three and four instruments combine seamlessly into pulsing whole. ""Council Is Called"" is a nice example of the band working together to lock into a mood rather than a groove. The track is built on a keyboard drone, around which several guitars spin synchronous webs of sound, the echoing series of notes playing off each other, accented by the occasional cymbal wash. It reminds me a bit of Spacemen 3's Recurring in the way simple guitar tones and space do a huge amount of emotional work. ""Victory of Ice and Magyk"" is much more acidic, with distantly wah-wahing rhythm guitars from the early fusion school playing off an overdriven lead that imparts an edge of fried psychedelia. Both are engaging and reward careful listening. Owing to their improvisatory origins, many tracks fade in and out almost randomly, and sometimes the abrupt transitions are jarring. But when they leave the scissors in the drawer, as on the 19-minute closer ""Freeing the Winds"", you understand why they edit: it's a track with a few great moments and a number of dull ones. This patchy, haphazard character puts Dragyn a notch below the band's debut. Sometimes, you feel like you're listening to a solid practice jam rather than a recording to return to frequently. ""Over Land and Ice"" is Dragyn at its best. It fades up gradually, but rather than seeming like an edit from a longer session, the song feels like the musical equivalent of a Polaroid photograph developing before your eyes. The ringing guitar pattern dominating the song's first section is pretty much pure joy translated into six strings, and the gauzy coziness of the accompanying rhythm part reminds me of when Duster used to get the guitar tone just right. Even as these connections unravel over the tune's 11 minutes (this is a six-track, hour-long record), ""Over Land and Ice"" retains its uplifting feel. As long as the band's collective jams occasionally lead somewhere this satisfying, I'll put up with the fire-breathing mushrooms.",,6.8,
Ego War,Audio Bullys,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a142c0084474cd0bfd8c/1:1/w_160/521727b4.jpg,2003-06-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/354-ego-war/,Astralwerks,"Part of me feels a little bit sorry for Audio Bullys, a duo stuck in a thankless position: they promise great things and can't always deliver. Like a great singer-songwriter with a lousy voice, like a pro-caliber basketball player who's only five feet tall, they're packed full of the right ideas but stuck fighting their own limitations. Actually, that's an outright lie, because they aren't fighting: if their limitations are a wall, it's just another surface they can slouch against, smoking cigarettes. Their debut single, after all, was called ""We Don't Care""-- and if people heard punk in it, it was just that disregard for whether they were doing things right or not. They were. When the song took off in the UK, people suspected they could do many things. They could be the next Basement Jaxx, wrapping house music around a dozen genres-- rock, hip-hop, R&B;, UK garage-- cranking out purified pop from their blender. They could be the next Streets, packing up a street-level vision of Brit boylife and mailing it out on bumping beats. They could christen a new genre-- ""hooligan house?"" All of this was just the usual exaggeration from getting very, very excited, but no one was out of line: ""We Don't Care"" sounds like a couple guys in gorilla suits taking house hostage. It starts with solo vocals, Simon Franks barking marble-mouthed like the Clash; then, before the house stomp comes in-- a big knuckle-dragging bruiser of a stomp, a beat that bounces in a way hardly anything but American hip-hop ever does-- the whole thing stops for the highlight, the barely-intelligible sneer: ""WHATHAFAA!"" I have notes on this track in front me, and after a bunch of stuff about hooliganism and the jaunty mid-song breakdown I have written: ""Oh my god. Oh man."" Ego War sports a few singles this good or arguably better, and in each case it's down to two things: fantastic ideas and consistently great scripting by beat-dresser Tom Dinsdale. His music isn't exactly symphonic, but it's good-looking and inventive: constantly punchy, rough-and-tumble, sneakily switched-up house beats like overexcited puppies tripping over their own legs as they sprint over to lick you silly. Not to point fingers, but the problems lurk more in Franks's domain: if Americans already have problems with British people doing anything rap-like, Franks's occasional bouts of troglodytic rhyming aren't going to help matters. This doesn't have to kill things any more than punk singers killed punk-- in at least two places, it sort of helps-- but I have to mention the line, ""About a year I was with her for/ and when we broke it left me quite sore."" It's another reason to feel bad for them, actually, because that clunker comes in a year when UK garage MCs have started looking even better than their hip-hop equivalents-- even Jay-Z's paying attention, and sometime soon, he'll see the release of a full-length from Dizzee Rascal, whose basement rant ""I Luv U"" walks all over ""We Don't Care"". As for Franks, well...you're better off if you don't exactly need your pop stars to sound like scholars. Some winners: the title track, for which my notes go a step further and say ""holy god."" You could dance to this super-sunny island bounce, but not without sporting a loopy grin at the situation, or at its intense Englishness: it's Madness; it's like the parks of Parklife got paved to put up discos. Or ""The Snow"": Dinsdale's got a thing for punchy seventies horn sections, and this, their best house track, EQs them through dime-stop switchbacks while Franks lazes around the repeating melody. Or ""I Go to Your House"", which struts and bumps like Stereo MCs and points the hey-there gun-fingers at you. This is one of those places where Franks's tossed-off babble enhances things: he goes to her house and she's not there, but it sounds like he really thinks that's her loss. When your M.O. is just a banged-up house pump and a less-than-stellar singer coasting over a few melody lines, anything less than the best has a tendency to grate: like the riff-repetition of the average Fall record, the winners win and the rest just sit there looking underplanned. It's the Day in the Life packaging that fails them more often: on The Streets' Original Pirate Material, Mike Skinner put on just the right two-face-- a garrulous wit one second, he'd go all emo-earnest on you the next, sounding sad, determined, and vulnerable. Franks tries the same, with less success-- on ""100 Million"" he sits around stoned while his mother yells at him to get a job, and ""Way Too Long"" offers a Skinnerian tale of bad debts among the geezers, but by ""The Things"" and ""Veteran"" he's promising to change his life and ""be a better man."" In between you get Dinsdale playing with the beats a little: video-game tick-tock and synth-tweakery on ""Real Life"", then a weirdo Halloween toy-robot bass-bump on ""The Tyson Shuffle""; Joe Cocker samples alternate with music-hall piano on ""Face in a Cloud"". They don't need to be ""great,"" really, because sometimes it's more important to get everything right; to be honest is often to be honestly great. And they are, In the rough crayon sketches of everything collapsing, of dance music being pop music being dance music again, of anyone singing and rapping the way anyone could shout for punk bands, of everything pumpable or shoutable or loveable collapsing into a hit-single playground. Still, crayon sketches: they're no Basement Jaxx, and it's easy to hope for someone with more professional skills to come fill in the Audio Bullys' blueprints.","Part of me feels a little bit sorry for Audio Bullys, a duo stuck in a thankless position: they promise ...

Here Comes the Indian,Animal Collective,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09d13d197565213841f/1:1/w_160/a1ff8bc5.gif,2003-06-17 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/190-here-comes-the-indian/,Paw Tracks,"The last time I was lost in the Enchanted Forest, stomping through the snarls of black branches, snapping sticks and rustling the leaves, I came across a bent hag. She whispered a few words, scattered some herbs to the wind, and shrunk my hands into little one-inch nubs at the end of my full-grown arms. Helpless, and with nightfall hastily approaching, I stumbled across a campfire that had been built by the friendly furry creatures of the Animal Collective. I could hear noises coming through the trees as I approached: They were making feral cries in the darkness, beginning ""Native Belle"" and startling me for just a second. After a full day of jamborees and playing Indian in the woods, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Geologist and Deaken were dancing like children around the crackling fire among the pines. Their voices were twisted electronically to the point that they were hardly distinguishable, swirling around as though just loosed from the Ark. I felt feeble in my attempt to join in, my hands cursed as they were, but the Animal Collective made me comfortable in my new body, showing me that even with such undersized tools-- and scarcely more than drums, voices, effect-laden guitars and keyboards-- infinite sounds were possible. The moves were simple, really: I could still whoop like an injun, flapping my nubs over my mouth to bawl rhythmically. Holding my hands up into my ears, all the sounds flickered like primitive wah-wah pedals along a cave wall. Even with these hands, I could still clap, and did so right in the middle of the Gibby-tronic slurs and screams of ""Hey Light"". The wolf-howled bursts quieted into snapping pattycakes and chanted rounds around the dying embers. These communal murmurs were far removed from their first spastic sounds. Panda Bear showed that by tightening my hands into balled fists, my very arms could become drumsticks, conveying endless energy, every surface a percussive experiment. Even as I tap out this recollection, they clack against the keys rhythmically, moving with the rounds of distorted campfire singing; not as a regular beat, but as something stumbled upon and followed into the wild. The thinly veiled vocal menace of Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising is laid out on ""Infant Dressing Table"" with much clanking, wailing and gurgled regurgitation. Seemingly innocent as a newborn babe, ""Two Sails on a Sound"" mutates the dark forest into the wood panels of Whitley Strieber's downstairs den, suggesting the presence of silvery aliens. As a piano sampled from Cluster II plinks out ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"", the twelve-minute abduction transcends glory-glory hallelujah altogether. ""Slippi"" is a lost Missa Luba ritual disguised as basement hardcore, an ecclesiastical outburst of joyfully chanted heart patters. ""Too Soon"" creaks as near to the ground as cricket tremors, interrupted by the shrapnel of the exploding frogs that fall from the trees. Our hands also tremble with inevitable release. It is a natural death for such forest-dwelling creatures as us, slowly losing hold, rising and falling. The odd pop traces from Avey Tare and Panda Bear's much-beloved Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished have become discernable at certain moments on this day, but only echoed distantly in the woods, not so much lost as Gone. The music was stripped down to that ecstatic skin of mouth, hands, and feet, invoking a rhythmic rapture I had previously only associated with Boredoms and certain tribal recordings. While it's hard to grasp exactly what the Animal Collective was up to here that day in the forest, I have fumbled for hours tonight with my withered paws to gain some kind of understanding, and to hope for just one more glimpse of the ghosts with whom I was so sure I'd danced.","The last time I was lost in the Enchanted Forest, stomping through the snarls of black branches, snapping sticks and ...

Welcome Interstate Managers,Fountains of Wayne,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be02abf31b7dc715609a/1:1/w_160/f137b1e5.jpg,2003-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3160-welcome-interstate-managers/,S-Curve,"There's a lot of sugar in Fountains of Wayne. You could get a month-long jolt of artificial energy from just one helping of their self-titled first disc, or the follow-up, Utopia Parkway; syrupy harmonies, magnetic power-pop chords and the occasional dopey keyboard riff have been the group's bread and butter since day one, and it's served them well. Long after other groups have lost the knack for tongue-in-cheek couplets and catchy chord progressions (what have you got to say for yourself, Rivers?), Fountains of Wayne have kept the formula close at hand, and served up some tasty dishes as a result. Songwriter Adam Schlesinger wasn't tapped for the soundtrack to That Thing You Do for nothing, and the pop sensibilities of teen sensations The Wonders infuse much of FoW's latest opus, Welcome Interstate Managers. As soon as the seconds start ticking and the guitar starts strumming on ""Mexican Wine"", you know what you're in for: fuzzy guitars, big Warner Bros. drums, and the gravelly voices of Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood, which hang out somewhere between Wayne Coyne's raspy tenor and the boat the British Invasion came in on. Throw in a delicate Beach Boys castanet, and you've got a killer opening number. Indeed, ""Mexican Wine"" is the biggest rocker on the record. To be fair, the first single, ""Stacy's Mom"", aims for king of the hill, but its routine pacing keeps it from breaking away from the pack-- even if the crystalline harmonies during the chorus are worth noting. As it just so happens, it's the duo's vocal harmonies that end up being the biggest boon for Welcome Interstate Managers, and no cut here makes this clearer than ""Hackensack"" (the couplet ""I saw you talkin'/ To Christopher Walken"" helps some), which highlights Schlesinger's 50s pop fixation while also encompassing jangly guitar and dreamy crooning. And ballads like ""Valley Winter Song"" and the upbeat, acoustic ""Hey Julie"" might find themselves dead in the water without their clever vocal pairings-- the kind Fountains of Wayne have falling out their back pockets. Even when the instrumentation gets stale (""Little Red Light"" and the Ben Folds Five redux ""Fire Island"" are prime offenders), the creamy, chocolate-covered melodies are there to offer up a little redemption. I like TastyCakes. They're sugary, they're bad for me, but I like them. I wouldn't eat a boxful of them in one go, though; too much of a good thing, as someone who's probably dead once said. That's the biggest problem with Welcome Interstate Managers, and in many ways the entire Fountains of Wayne catalog. I don't fault the band for being disposable; on the contrary, these guys are so in love with being disposable that you can't help but have fun. Even if it seems unlikely that you'd ever be driving through the 'burbs with the windows down, singing ""Stacy's mom/ Has got it goin' on,"" I assure you it'll happen. And although the lyrics to ""Halley's Waitress"" are nothing less than moronic, the 70s power ballad trappings are straight-up masterful. Still, Fountains of Wayne are guilty of taking themselves a bit too seriously here, or at least trying to prove their legitimacy, when they should be goofing around. How else to explain the peddle steel country of ""Hung Up on You"" which-- despite nailing the inbred cleverness of Nashville lyricism (""Ever since you hung up on me/ I'm hung up on you"")-- is a good example of how to fuck up a good thing, right and proper. Ditto the god-awful ""Peace and Love""; I really can't tell if they're making fun of hippies or giving them a big sloppy kiss, but the track stretches the band's magic so thin, I seriously considered starting a band just so I could quit in disgust. Despite its obviously short shelf-life, Welcome Interstate Managers is delicious power-pop, unpretentious, loose and perfect for teenagers driving down to Ocean City for the weekend; Schlesinger and Collingwood pen some mighty fine tunes ripe and ready for sing-alongs, drawing equally on the lighter-than-air innocence of the 1950s and the skewed songwriting skills of Ween and They Might Be Giants. Too much Fountains of Wayne will seize your stomach, but like a wide-eyed babe on Easter morning, you won't know you've overindulged until it's too late.","There's a lot of sugar in Fountains of Wayne.

Enantiodromia,Azita,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16913d1975652138612/1:1/w_160/5483db7f.jpg,2003-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/396-enantiodromia/,Drag City,"As much as I adore the songs from A Chorus Line, the 1975 Original Broadway Cast could not really Sing Worth a Shit. Partially, I think it was a concession they made in casting-- they chose folks who could project their voices, dance and act; looking for that triumverate of talent, it mattered not whether they were Sarah Brightman belting out that vibrato like the unfurling petals of a glorious rose. On the other hand, the voices on A Chorus Line were conversational. They had the advantage of sounding like real people conveying elements of their lives-- which is exactly what they were, in the context of the script. Wayne Cilento singing ""I Can Do That"" has all the requisite wackiness of a brassy jokester swindling his way into tap class; Priscilla Lopez's version of ""Nothing"" captured desire and revenge through the very viable channel prayer; both resonate with the banal reality of your neighbors grousing over what sweet morsel to throw on the BBQ next, only in song form. No spectacular warbles to phone home about, but somehow real in a way that Andrew Lloyd Webber's minions will never understand-- a sort of folk art, really. Azita's Endantiodromia works in the same way-- terrible, compelling and somehow real all at once. Terrible comes first, and I mean it in the literary sense: formidable, extreme, bloody, larger-than-life. Terrible as in ""Ivan, the."" With the assistance of drummer John McEntire, bassist Matthew Lux, guitarist Jeff Parker, and cornetist Rob Mazurek, Azita plays armchair pub jazz in 70s half-step melodies, composing jittery modernist piano pieces for the pop age. Her singing voice, petted down quite a lot from her war-cry days in Chicago no-punk greats the Scissor Girls and Bride of Nono, is a flimsy, moppety, rubbery alto that never knows which note is safe to pitch a tent upon. Initially, it is something akin to off-putting-- or if you're feeling sinister, off-putting could also be interpreted as ""intolerable."" However. Once the fertile terribleness of Azita's painfully unaffected delivery sinks in, it lays eggs, and Endantiodromia reveals itself as one of those records that shears the tiny line between genius and utterly confounding. She interprets her compositions like Linda Ronstadt's record with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, if Linda had first washed down a couple valium pills with a flask of Maker's Mark. Or, like Yoko Ono fronting Get Hustle. Or, on the vocal-free numbers, like Gyorgy Kurtag's jagged, frightening vocal explorations and Scriabin piano concertos interpreted in a pop-jazz context. Azita interprets the aforementioned ideas-- along with a whole heaping spoonful of Steely Dan cocaine-haze melodics-- as if seeing them through a warped mirror bubbled up and cracked with globules of heat. And, as conversation goes, Azita's is appropriately deranged, as she barks out lyrics like, ""I'd love to invite your eleventh finger in for a little tickle"" on the slinky, cabaret number ""Ooh Ooh Johnny"". On the opening track, ""Better End in Time"", Azita's narrative gets anecdotal: ""We split up after the Christmas party/ He was too far gone to care/ Pukin' out the driver side door/ Maneuvering the stairs/ Claiming his is the art of a sailor/ A little take from everywhere."" She sings it in a whimper and, more important than the fact that her throat is clogged and froggy, she is utterly believable. She's believable 'cause she's flawlessly human and unscripted, like her vocal tracks were cut in one take, the second she thought of them. Unfettered. And with that realization, something weird happens. The more I listen to Enantiodromia, the more I believe it to be a work erring more on the side of genius than on the side of confounding. Her piano compositions are quite impeccable (see Scriabin vs. piano jazz reference above), her voice is inimitable (without the slightest ounce of hyperbole, that one), and the album's final track, ""Show Theme"", left room for some subdued Fosse-style choreography after I threw back my Sunday mimosa.","As much as I adore the songs from A Chorus Line, the 1975 Original Broadway Cast could not really Sing ...

Are You Ready for an Organ Solo?,Quintron,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b4c0084474cd0bfe88/1:1/w_160/9c8c6ce1.jpg,2003-06-16 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6599-are-you-ready-for-an-organ-solo/,Three-One-G,"New Orleans-- home to whiz-bang vampire novelist Poppy Z. Brite and a frequent locale of the Girls Gone Wild video series-- is infamous for its muggy, beaded sleaziness, as well as a shitload of haunted locales. It's also the sweaty workshop of Mr. Quintron, the scattered 9th ward inventor of the Drum Buddy (a rotating, percussive oscillator activated by rhythmic light exposure patterns) and the fertile mind behind a finely tweaked circus-cum-porn rhinestone universe. Born in Germany, Q came of age in Mobile, Alabama and St. Louis, Missouri. Combing electronic know-how and sonic flair, he headed to Chicago when he was 17, where he hooked up with Bulb records, who up to this point released most of his material. Quintron relocated to New Orleans in 1991, and during a bit of Mardi Gras magic, met his wife Miss Pussycat, a renowned puppeteer and proprietor of the now defunct theater space Pussycat Gardens. They've been working together on music, sexy costumes, musical gadgets, infomercials, and over-the-top live shows ever since. Checking those grubby fingernails reachin' out for Miss Pussycat's pink air-brushed shirt on the cover of Are You Ready for an Organ Solo?, you can see they're collaboratin' on this freaky-ass love-in as well. My first run-in with Quintron was his second record, the vinyl-only Amazing Spellcaster (its shiny, silver-and-red swirl packaging leaked and smeared onto my hands when I first bought it). Recorded live at the Pussycat Caverns, it was a seriously haunted organ stomp of bottles, birds, and a Disco Light Machine. During this early period, Quintron's tunes were more gleefully exploratory and repetitious. I remember imagining this goggled smoke and mirror man living in a Victorian-styled cave, reading lots of Harry Partch. I miss that arcane shit. Q's lately been surrounded by an army of guest vocalists and some honest-to-god pop star hooks-- and he recorded this album with Tim Kerr, so things are even more layered and finessed. Despite the added production value, Quintron still handles the bulk of instrumental duties (Miss Pussycat plays maracas and a second drum), continuing with his one-man-band approach. But in the studio, that's hardly discernable: assembled track by track, it sounds like any other band. I don't mind cohesion, but I'm a bit nervous about the dance-oriented cheerleader change of pace here-- imagine a less irritating Peaches. ""Underwater Dance Club"" is a worrisome nod to the B52's, and when the record gets harsher, as on ""Cave Formation"", Quintron only approaches the detached pounding of Chicks On Speed. ""Miniature Breakdown"" is even more electroclash familiar, but does ushers in moments of a Terry Riley You're No Good vibe, which carries through to the next track, ""I'm Not Busy"". ""Teenage Antoinette"" and ""Place Unknown"" more successfully combine these new strains with his keyboard-driven sound, both exciting examples of his progression. You could righteously label most of these tracks soulful workouts, but the closer ""Organ Solo""-- a twisted laser tag waltz-- serves as a contradiction to the entire album, evoking Quintron's more ecstatic early years. I'm not a nostalgic man, I just know what works, and this reminder of how much better it used to be exposes the shakiness of his new ideas. While not his strongest or most compelling work, Are You Ready for an Organ Solo? does have some of that old-age chutzpah shaken with its new school ingredients, offering a sometimes swank interlude to Quintron's dirty hotels and kitschy backwaters.","New Orleans-- home to whiz-bang vampire novelist Poppy Z.

Asleep Many Years in the Wood,The Anomoanon,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a95e6ef9596931ffdf/1:1/w_160/9aae5c98.jpg,2003-06-16 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/201-asleep-many-years-in-the-wood/,Temporary Residence,"Ominously mellow, the Anomoanon's music is a lilting tide in which you don't mind drowning, much less the fact that your family will have to pay their last respects to an expensive box containing a rusted lounge chair. It's nigh impossible to avoid associating this band with Will ""Bonnie-Prince-Palace-Push-Songs-Music-Brothers"" Oldham: Ned shares plenty of his wily sibling's vocal tics and virtues-- a mumbly Kentucky brogue, a cocky but worried tone, a subdued wail-- and Will usually guests on Ned's recordings (The Anomoanon have conversely acted as Will's backing and touring band, sharing peripheral personnel in Dave Heumann, Pooh Johnston, and Paul Oldham). Both acts cover obscurish poetry, and are puckish with syntax and grammar. Lyrically, they love to tiptoe in tulips alternately soothing and disturbing. But Asleep Many Years In The Wood continues to define Ned's own dominion: he is not his brother's stevedore, he's the autopiloting captain of some weird tractor-boat, a hoverharvester that would replace the locals' fear of twisters (if Kentucky had everglades). Whereas Will has anachronistic magnetism and an under-the-bridge creepiness, Ned cuts a traditionally attractive and welcoming figure; he is Abel to his brother's Cain, or Arnold Schwarzenegger to Will's Danny DeVito. Another Anomo-myth is that ""they sound like the Grateful Dead."" Leave that noise to the misguided folks with dancing-bear ankle-tats, the ones who say ""whoa, that's Jerry, brah"" whenever the professor shows a slide of Karl Marx or Michelangelo's God (or Papa Smurf). Ned's otherworldly wharf-folk does not ""jam,"" nor does it indulge in that subset of psychedelia's time-honored (and time-consuming) bottom-scrapery. Disclaimer the Last: while even the most ornate ""alt-country"" records can suffer from sameyness, anyone who calls the Anomoanon's work conventional is only half-listening. You have to wonder if the band took the mobile recording unit from Shelbyville's Rove Studios to coastal Onancock, Virginia in order to safeguard the marina-vibe they've cultivated since 1999's Summer Never Ends EP, or just for the place's perverse name, because Ned appears to enjoy simultaneous fulfillment and inversion of expectations. His slow jams always prefer realism to romance; ""One That Got Away"" (a gaw-geous duet with Will that, though it might be about a dead lover, couldn't resist the cornball fishing-joke title) begins, ""Baby/ I don't think about you all the time."" The album is packed with uncanny lines: ""You gave away all of your eyes,"" ""If I understood everything you're saying, I would be you,"" or check this out: ""Friends like us, we need some enemies."" During the slippery, mystical ""Sixteen Ways,"" the band debuts the newest clan member, baby Sam Oldham, crying, in a gesture much less maudlin than ""Sail To The Moon""-- Radiohead's new homage to Lennon's egoey, procreation-praising ""Beautiful Boy"". Not all the verbiage contained here is keepworthy, though: Ned commits a dopey rhyme crime (""sad guy"" and ""bad guy"") and I hope he's quoting an Alzheimer's-compromised Mr. Belvedere when he sings, ""Sometimes dreams make me happy/ Sometimes they give me the worst kind of fright."" Derrr, flowers is pretty to smell at. Run quick from scary bears. The whole project is ruled by ""Kick Back"", a Fogertized cowbell stomp with a dash of Allmania, tempered by its Dylan-worshiping Jennyanykind neu-boogie. During the breakdown, you hear a cough, then a mutter of ""kickin' back,"" then a bonkers Vietnam-paranoid scream, ""KICKIN' BACK!"" The moment's incongruity provides a great upsurge, like when Frankie shouted for us to relax, or when Ian demanded we dance (three times) to the radio. Fun is your imperative!

Oskar Tennis Champion,Momus,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39013d197565213bd68/1:1/w_160/bed6f79d.jpg,2003-06-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5385-oskar-tennis-champion/,American Patchwork,"Stephin Merritt may be indiedom's Oscar Wilde, but Nick Currie (aka Momus) has long been lobbying to become its Baudelaire. For a while, it seemed like the Scot might get the job: his bon mots are sufficiently toxic, his imagery runs to rococo decadence, and best of all, he walks the walk: Currie's biography is a steady succession of scandals. A quick recap would include his marriage to a 17-year-old Bangladeshi girl-- which had British tabloids occupied for a good part of 1994-- and a lost lawsuit over a song about Wendy Carlos. The financial fallout of the latter had Momus soliciting wealthy fans for old-fashioned patronage (he sold them ""song portraits"" at $1000 a pop) and generally upping productivity-- the fleurs of which we are picking to this day. Oskar Tennis Champion, his unlistenable new album, suggests the launch of a different fund drive: Pay Momus to Zip It. Written and recorded in Japan (where Momus is fairly well established-- he wrote a hit called ""I Am a Kitten"" for pop star Kahimi Karie), the CD takes no inspiration from its surroundings, other than an unpleasant ambient intro titled ""Spooky Kabuki"", which finds Currie croaking ""we are the pirates"" over clicks, burbles and sine waves. The album's production adds a superfluous glitch layer to Momus's usual Casio sea shanties, and the results are somewhat reminiscent of Future Bible Heroes' ""Eternal Youth"", the vampires-and-aliens opus that arguably marks Stephin Merritt's lowest moment to date. But to compare the two would be to ascribe Oskar Tennis Champion a degree of coherence, and I'm not that generous. Song after song, Currie's trademarked sick wit is nowhere to be found. ""My Sperm Is Not Your Enemy"" is a vintage Momus title, but it's hung on a predictable and humorless ditty; the same goes for ""Beowulf (I Am Deformed)"", and whatever hilarity could be gleaned from ""Electrosexual Sawing Machine"" comes from the posh way Momus pronounces ""seks-you-al."" Hope is momentarily rekindled with the arrival of ""The Last Communist"", an energetic number with an actual melody, rather than a half-assed waltz or polka pastiche. Alas, the song is quickly exposed as a third-rate Auteurs ripoff, the kind Luke Haines probably writes in his uneasy absinthe sleep. The lyrics are an embarrassing laundry list of lame Russki clichés (""Drinking vodka through a straw/ Looking for the visions Lenin saw""), which is more than a disappointment from the guy who wrote ""Trans-Siberian Express""-- a cruel, precise, and terrific poem that deserves a place in any number of modern literary anthologies. That was old Momus, I guess, unencumbered by tabloid infamy and money concerns. The new Momus is the kind of guy who stoops to include a minute of silence as the 16th track on this disc and titles it ""A Minute of Silence"". If that's not enough, he follows it up with an instrumental reprise of the album's second track-- rendered in telephone ringtones! Oh, the fun! Awful as it might be, Oskar is not easy to dismiss because awfulness has always been a part of Momus' gambit. The man's main fallacy, however, is that his laboriously cultivated image of a postmodern ponce is binding and irreversible. Behind the moniker of the Greek God of Ridicule, Nick Currie is an erudite man who consigned himself to powdered-wig naughtiness and endless intimations of buggery. This kind of stuff gets old-- even for the joker-- and there's nothing to kill a comedy routine like a whiff of noblesse oblige.","Stephin Merritt may be indiedom's Oscar Wilde, but Nick Currie (aka Momus) has long been lobbying to become\n ...

Songs for an Unborn Sun,Lazarus,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb5eb335119a49ecd10/1:1/w_160/e9bd8bc4.jpg,2003-06-16 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4701-songs-for-an-unborn-sun/,Temporary Residence,"Isolation bred disinterest, and ultimately contempt, as I discovered that my enjoyment of pornography didn't survive the move from my parent's house to the new apartment. Even the understated kitsch value of a dwarf-- costumed as the sorcerer's apprentice-- ""giving it"" to a fully developed magic broom was lost without the possibility of grandma, shawl-covered and napping in the basement, haphazardly overhearing lines like ""FUCK ME HARDER, MERLIN!"" With an entire two-bedroom, two-bath at my disposal, the guilt of owning such a collection of magazines and videotapes was gone, unfortunately taking with it the excitement of viewing those naughty images of girl-on-girl, hardcore, and the dubious ""miscellaneous."" Trevor Montgomery-- formerly of Tarentel and The Drift-- is familiar with a similar thrill of fermented voyeurism, as his intimate tales of love and death are likewise garnished by a compelling sense of discomfort and guilt. Appropriately made within the confines of his bedroom, Songs for an Unborn Sun-- created under the pseudonym Lazarus-- is a revealing look into the inner-thoughts and fears of this songwriter. Augmented by the poetically macabre sensation that you're participating in an ill-advised act of personal and public shame, Songs... thrives insofar as it doesn't simply function as a detached ""tear-in-my-beer"" tale of woe, but actively engages the listener in his throes of melancholy torment, regardless of their consent. Crucial to the album's unsettling success is the production of Marty Anderson (Howard Hello, Dilute); he supplies the sparse accompaniment that shades the sincerity in Montgomery's doleful voice. On ""Wind"", Anderson layers his own crone-like, tar-filled growl in harmony with Montgomery's soft yet weighty instrument, as they bludgeon your ears with their lamenting call of ""I am my mother, I am the wind/ We are lost without each other"" before fading gently into the track's namesake. In the same way, ""The Song Becomes Blood"" and ""Born a Friendship"" share Anderson's accent: he weaves himself in and out of tune, arising mainly to highlight lyrical buzzwords like ""suicide"" and ""choking."" The root strength of ""Poets the Liars"" is found within the bleak contrast between strumming acoustic guitar and distant swells of ambient noise, and proves exemplar of the homely yet enjoyable nature of the entire album. As chimes flutter and ornament the bare backbone of what constitutes a melody, you're driven to bear witness to the track as it unfurls, the same way you can't turn your head from the sight of a bloodied animal on the roadside. ""Tears"", ""Obviust"", and ""Time"" develop this musical conceit further, complicating the instrumentation with cello, organ, and piano, which nicely augment these otherwise nude compositions. Ironically, the relatively upbeat moments of the album detract most from the overall work. ""Ocean (Burn the Highways)"" feels sentimentally and musically flat trailing behind the rich ""Poets"", not aided in the least by the addition of sappy, surging strings and an invitation to ""drift to sleep."" Sounding like the forced caterwaul of a dying relationship that neither party is willing to acknowledge, ""Boredom Revolt"" further adds to the chagrin as Montgomery ceases to flex his elegiac power, choosing the path most-taken with his floundering plea to go ""Back to sleep, to work, and to dreaming."" The vaguely lewd liner notes-- sporting unpleasant line drawings of couples in various stages of arousal-- give the final clue to unlocking the charm and buried beauty of this album. Designed for headphone-enveloped solitude, Songs for an Unborn Sun invokes the dirty-yet-satisfying feelings associated with improper actions, wanton consequences, and various other culpable pleasures. It's telling that Montgomery's only true failure in the project comes in the few moments where he shrouds his work with elements of guiltless indulgence, robbing the listener of artistic intimacy and reducing Songs... from a powerful statement on morose coition to a less enticing, brief flirtation with the obscene.","Isolation bred disinterest, and ultimately contempt, as I discovered that my enjoyment of pornography didn't survive the move from ...

Yes New York,Various Artists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fa5e6ef959693210df/1:1/w_160/8f8605f6.jpg,2003-06-16 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2013-yes-new-york/,AtlanticViceWolfgang Morden,"Yes, New York, there is a record industry. That might be the most striking distinction between this compilation and 1978's historic No Wave warning shot, the famed, Brian Eno-produced No New York comp referred to by the title of this proposed modern counterpart. In 1978, James Chance and his contemporaries were making albums retailers couldn't move with a forklift, and now The Strokes probably have more platinum-certified albums than all the NYC No Wavers combined (which is to say, they have one). Teenage Jesus & The Jerks made music unlike anyone in rock and roll had before them-- or ever wanted to, perhaps-- but now we just seem to kill time between revivals. That's how it feels sometimes, hearing every new band discussed in reference to their ancestors; The Fever is to PIL as Ted Leo is to Thin Lizzy, ad infinitum. It's hard not to succumb to crotchety lamentations on the State of the Music Industry when an album-- a compilation, at that-- owes such an obvious debt to the past; as a music critic, I realize we're the ones responsible for most of the finger-pointing in the first place, but there's hope to be found at the bottom of all this. Even though Yes New York lacks the out-of-nowhere significance of its namesake, it's got a few major selling points. First, it's for a good cause: the proceeds will benefit Musicians on Call, a charity devoted to exploring the recuperative powers of music by bringing it to hospital patients. Second, if everyone would quit playing connect-the-dots to pin down who these bands copped their sounds from, you might be able to hear this album for what it is: a brilliant cross-section of a thriving quasi-local music scene. Fittingly, it opens with a live version of ""New York City Cops"" by the band who, along with a cataclysmic shifting of the city's Feng Shui, is most responsible for the recent wealth of attention being lavished on the NYC scene. The track was cut from the U.S. version of The Strokes' debut, Is This It, in a kneejerk post-9/11 pique, for its sweetly disparaging chorus of, ""New York City cops/ They ain't too sma-art,"" though I still can't fathom what anyone could hear in this song to warrant censure. Sure, there's a literal dig at New York's boys in blue, and it's basically a tale of heroin addiction, but in every wailing guitar strain, in each of Julian Casablancas' glassy-eyed lines, I hear pure love. All of these songs are just a fraction of the emotion to be found on the faces of the millions walking the downtown streets of New York-- the redemptive hope of Interpol's ""NYC"", the world-is-against-me determination of Ted Leo's ""Ballad of the Sin Eater""-- but ""New York City Cops"" is an honest expression of hometown pride. Yeah, I could be reading into it too much, but this comp is New York through and through, and I can't think of a better way to open things up. Following the champions are a half-dozen of the big name acts you'd expect on an early-naughts NYC compilation: Radio 4 contribute one of their most uncharacteristically innovative and powerful tracks, the impossibly urgent ""Save Your City""; DFA's other dance-punk superstars, The Rapture, chime in with the synthesized desperation of ""Olio"". From the fragile tranquility of The Walkmen's ""Rue the Day"" to Calla's slightly sinister ""Strangler"", this comp makes one thing perfectly clear: for a host of bands so readily compared to the same tiny stable of influences-- ""sounding like a modern-day Gang of Four...""-- there sure is a hell of a lot of diversity between them. An equally impressive feat: most of the bands not yet blessed with truckloads of publicity hang in for all sixteen rounds, without once showing signs of fatigue. The Witnesses manage a surprisingly entertaining take on blues-rock care of AC/DC; the arena vibe might get old after a whole album, but ""I Should Not Have to Ask"" is the perfect antidote to the mopey miserablism that cuts a broad swathe through the middle of the compilation. The Natural History, meanwhile, pull off a groovy, Anglican amalgam of American roots and classic Britpop with ""The Right Hand"" in a moment of clutch late-album respite. DFA's performance alter-egos LCD Soundsystem contribute some Zep-informed 70s stomp-rock mayhem with ""Tired"", and there's even some band called Unitard doing a subtly countrified, boring take on the Yeah Yeah Y-- hey, wait a second, it's actually the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they almost had me fooled! And here I thought they skipped out on Yes New York like their no-account friends in Liars. The YYY's pull out a less impressive ""unplugged"" version of ""Our Time"" billed as ""Year to be Hated""; it's one of their weaker moments as a band, but it's uncommonly sincere, and an appropriate, fine closer to a schizophrenic thrill-ride of a compilation. There are a few other less-than-stellar entries-- particularly Longwave's achingly ordinary acoustic gentleness-- but this is a portrait of a city's music community in total, and as such is really impressive. Though every song might not be spectacular, an accurate portrait isn't just a matter of putting on a shiny, happy public face, but rather showing the scene from all angles, for better or ""eh."" Yes New York manages to corral a number of shooting stars you might expect to fall into ego traps, and countering the cool sheen displayed in hype-building articles, their participation in this benefit-- for such a simple charity-- is a commendable contribution to the city they call home.","Yes, New York, there is a record industry.

"Ghana Soundz: AfroBeat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ee13d1975652139536/1:1/w_160/0f5435da.gif,2003-06-15 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2000-ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-fusion-in-70s-ghana/,Soundway,"We Americans have some very different ideas about music. Here, it's an industry, a part of the GNP-- even others countries' folk music is a commodity. Playing music is a learned skill for most of us, a luxury, even a solitary form of expression, often never shared with the world at large. Meanwhile, in parts of the third world, music is part and parcel with daily life, a communal language infused with ceremony, and integral to daily life. Perhaps this helps explain why so little recorded music comes to us from outside the sphere of industrialized nations-- there's little focus on distributing and selling recorded music, even music with obvious commercial potential, in societies where making music isn't widely viewed as the province of the few. All this makes a compilation like Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk and Fusion in 70s Ghana somewhat bittersweet. Bitter because it's obvious that, without direct Western influence and a certain compromising of traditional lifestyles, this music never would have been made; sweet because the music is so, so good. Like all of Africa, save Liberia (which was very nearly a U.S. colony), Ghana was once ruled by distant Europeans with no vested interest in the well-being of the local populace. The British colonial authority in Ghana (they called it the Gold Coast, because its huge gold deposits were what they wanted it for) wasn't among the worst colonial governments, but foreign rule is always a dead-end street for the locals, and in 1957, Ghana became one of the first European holdings in Africa to assert its independence, taking the name from an ancient and powerful trading empire that once controlled vast swaths of West Africa. Ghana's boundaries are, of course, artificial, and Ghanaian society consists of no fewer than eight major ethnolinguistic groups, but the country has managed to remain peaceful in spite of numerous coups and failed experiments with democracy in its history. The 70s marked an era of relative tolerance in Ghana, one in which the massive explosion of creativity that engulfed Western popular music in the late 60s found its way to Ghana. There, Western music infused itself into Ghana's prevailing pop music style, Highlife, a gumbo of jazz, traditional rhythms and Liberian sailor songs that had dominated the popular music scene in urban Ghana since the 30s. It's worth noting that Fela Kuti's earliest bands were essentially Highlife bands-- Nigeria and Ghana shared heritage as former British possessions and the music scenes in both countries often moved in parallel, though Nigeria's was far better funded and more visible. The experimental bands that sprung up in Ghana, taking on funk, psychedelia and fusion, never really deposed Highlife from the top of the Ghanaian charts (if such a thing can really be said to have existed), but hundreds of highly unique recordings nonetheless found their way onto locally pressed shellac discs in Ghana in the mid-70s and the era left behind a spoil of riches that's only beginning to come back to light, thanks largely to this disc, the first in what promises to be a series of three volumes. These songs tread a startling range of ground, but a few things hold true across all of them: they're ebullient and virtually apolitical, and the rhythm is the key. The compilation kicks off with three breakneck, fantastic funk tracks that are impossible not to groove to. The Third Generation Band's ""Because of Money"" is full of tribal percussion and hypnotic guitar, but it's really ""Bukom Mashie"" by Oscar Sulley & The Uhuru Dance Band that brings things into high gear. The song slams in with a killer drum vamp and before you can even fully wrap your head around how awesome it is, the bassist drops this fantastically buoyant line that'll have you looking around for someone to high-five. A huge, sax-dominated horn section blasts out an odd mixture of hot jazz, spy theme-ish drama and dancehall celebration that sucks the breath from your lungs. It's incredible how excellent each song here is. Marijata's ""Mother Africa"" is one of the best funk tracks I've ever heard, raw and filthy and tumbling along at ramjet tempo. Another personal favorite is Gyedu Blay Ambolley & The Steneboofs' ""Simigwado"", a strange tune built on a funky vamp that veers into spoken word passages (I'm not sure of the language) where Ambolley's flow picks up the rhythmic momentum and becomes the song's primary driving force. Honny & The Bees Band are the most overtly Western-influenced band here-- the backing vocals between verses sound almost like a Yardbirds guitar part. And then there's the shocking ring-modulated synthesizer solos that show up in the offerings from K. Frimpong & His Cubano Fiestas and a band called The African Brothers. Rob's ""Make It Fast, Make It Slow"" practically sounds like a D'Angelo track, with its slow, trunk-rattling beat anticipating every sleazy bed track that ever cropped up on a hip-hop album. You have to hear for yourself to truly understand the magnitude of what was happening in Ghanaian music in the 70s, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. This music sears, and the track selection here is impeccable. I've heard so many cheap-ass ""world music"" comps over the years that it's truly refreshing to hear one quite so expertly assembled-- it's not even presented as a world music compilation, so much as a collection of little-heard tracks that happen to be from Ghana. Ghana Soundz shines a long-overdue light on the best kind of music scene-- one in which creativity and simple joy took precedence over sales or posturing. We could learn from it.","We Americans have some very different ideas about music. Here, it's an industry, a part of the GNP-- even ...

Love & Hate,Aceyalone,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fea9d034d5c69bf25ba/1:1/w_160/b8f7c74e.jpg,2003-06-15 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15-love-hate/,Deconstruction,"Brad Nessler: Welcome to our wrap-up of Game Four between the East Coast and West Coast Hip-Hop Finals. I'm joined as always by the mookiest color commentary in the league, Bill Russell and Tom Tolbert. Guys, what do you think of this classic match-up, especially as it gets played by Aceyalone? Bill Walton: I got to tell you, when he first entered the league after his phenomenal showing at the Ronald McDonald Project Blowed game, I seriously thought he was the second coming. A powerful vocabulary, a vision encompassing the whole floor, commenting on the daily trials and tribulations-- as well as conscientious of the spiritual matters beyond-- and still funny and funky as well, putting it all together into the complete package for his breakthrough album, All Balls Don't Bounce. Criminally lost in the 1995 season, overwhelmed by the thuggish street ball of the East Coast Conference, it seems he's doubted himself since Capitol deleted the release and made it eBay fodder. Tom Tolbert: The game is playing Aceyalone these days. That non-materialistic, ""it's all good"" outlook embraced by the entire Left Coast contingency for years has led to a situation where they're seen as soft throwbacks when compared with the East, dominated on the Bill-boards and outscored on Soundscan points. Just look at the evolution from the peaceful outlook of his first album compared to the slightly tougher angle he takes on his newest, Love & Hate. I just don't believe it. Where was the weed-smoking, Crys-sipping and skin-hitting back then? He didn't need to resort to these tricks back then. I couldn't get behind the thematic, tepid thoughts on Book of Human Languages and Accepted Eclectic, but this season seems to be different for Acey. Bill Walton: It all starts with his supporting cast, guys. He needed the fatherly guidance and jazzy touch of producer Fat Jack on his first album, and it's nice to see him behind the glass again on ""The Sage Continues"". His old teammate from back in the day, Abstract Rude comes in for a few assists and timely treys, and it recalls that classic team of '95. He even brings the eternally winded Casual from Hieroglyphics off the bench for ""Let Me Hear Sumn"", which had the defense confused. His weight problems have always limited his player time, but for a moment, we see Casual and Acey engaged in the type of one-two game that we hoped to have seen when both of their records were glued to the decks eight years ago. Tom Tolbert: What makes this joint different is the recruitment of free agents from the Definitive Jux team on the East Coast stronghold. The most versatile DJ Big Man in the country, Ohioan RJD2, plays big minutes in the game, rejecting all wack shots and spurring fastbreak flights of fancy from Aceyalone. It's enough to get all the backpackers in the crowd up and nodding on three cuts here. His presence in the middle of tracks like ""Lost Your Mind"" alters the way the game is played around his booming beats. And ""Takeoff"" gets even more air, as Acey's vertical game takes over-- he jumps all over the weird digital fugues that RJD2 dribbles with the kick drum. The Play of the Game for sure. Bill Walton: Even on the seemingly too-R&B;, femme-cooing of ""Moonlit Skies"", both RJD2 and Aceyalone exhibit soft hands, reviving the lost art of touch-passing, and it makes for an excellent down tempo moment. But the biggest shock of the series comes when the Great White Hope, El-P, enters the game for ""City of Shit"". All about smash-mouth basketball, Acey takes the challenge magnificently, grinding it down in a back-and-forth match that's nasty and physical, yet never loses its tough sense of humor. The punch line chorus ""Now every time that I think about What-the-Fuck, I think about you/ And how he changed and took the pain when he ran into Fuck-You Too"" is one of the funniest shots this year. Throw down, Big Man, I say. Tom Tolbert: The most crucial aspect is staying strong for the entire game, but that just doesn't get done here. Moving from All-Stars to scrubs in the space of a year, bringing Saayid and Priest from the former AntiPop Consortium in for ""Lights Out"" is pure trash-time, the game lost on all, as neither player can find a worthwhile rhythm much less through the rock in the ocean. And as he tries to return to the ponderous themes of such vague nonsense as love and hate, Acey weighs the pacing of the game considerably. The tedious, song-long metaphor of ""Miss AmeriKKKa"" (whose tired theme I'll just let the viewers at home guess) has no place here or on any other team. That said, this is a rebuilding year for Acey, and there's lots to look forward to next year.","Brad Nessler: Welcome to our wrap-up of Game Four between the East Coast and West Coast Hip-Hop Finals.

Reset the Preset,Console,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64c9d034d5c69bf34d9/1:1/w_160/00d1233d.jpg,2003-06-15 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1585-reset-the-preset/,Virgin,"It's fairly common-- or at least I hope it is-- for critics to see what other folks are saying about an album before laying down their review, in order to establish some context, to make sure you're not just rehashing a tired angle. Reset the Preset proved a difficult subject for such research-- since it had yet to achieve stateside release, the only reviews available online were in the group's native German. Fortunately for Pitchfork, I received four years of training in German back in high school; unfortunately for Pitchfork, all I remember are swear words, how to order a beer, and the correct way to announce ""I smoke cheese!"" However, I am also highly skilled in the use of the Google page translator, and fired it up to do my fact-checking on this lengthy double album. I confirmed that Console is predominantly the work of Martin Gretschmann, who is ""also known for the electronic influence of the guitar-band The Notwist, in which he is a fixed member."" Console's also earned some acclaim of his own with the Matador release Rocket in the Pocket, which featured the ""from the media high praised love-song to his computer,"" ""14 Zero Zero"". But the most helpful Germanic resource I found was an Amazon user review by one Juergen Albertson, a lad with a promising future in the boom market of poorly-translated criticism. In his native language, the title of the review reads ""Guter Elektrorock!"" a statement that's not only accurate for the purposes of Reset the Preset but a ripe compilaton title just waiting to be plucked. Yet somehow the translated version-- ""Good Electrical Skirt!""-- is even more fitting, as Gretschmann enlists the singing talents of Miriam Osterreider on the poppier of the two stylistically-segregated discs. Dubbed Reset, the first platter works like a photo-negative version of The Notwist: rock-accented electronic rather than the opposite. Gretschmann shrugs off the recent IDM vogues, ignoring the glitch and only dipping his toes into the electroclash, instead choosing a fairly straightforward clubby sound: ""electrical skirt with genuine woman singing,"" as Juergen says. ""Dirt on the Wire"" is the most effective of these, combining deep strobe light bass and loops with unexpected horn breaks and robotic vocals before stopping on a dime and reconstructing its genetic material into a new, more corporeal direction like a Sade remix. Osterreider's Warwick act works well within the lap-pop constructs of Reset, her ability to emote more than your typical electro detachment sweetening the Morr-ish ""The Times They Are Not A-Changin'"" and floating amidst the synth-gaze ending of ""A+A=B"". Juergen rightly points out that it sounds dangerously close to other Indietronica acts, but also says the material ""makes for all of us luckier humans."" Well put. Disc Two, Preset, is entirely instrumental, and launches with ""Diagonal"", which could be the score to Terminator 4: The Machines and Humans Lay Down Their Weapons and Start a Groove Band Together. Tortoise-y with live drums and bass churning, while guitars and keyboards fight for melodic supremacy, it implies that Gretschmann is going to take a hack at German-ifying the Chicago sound. Ach der lieber, If only it were so; instead much of the disc concerns itself with meandering soundscapes, offering up four original tracks alongside dubbier, sparser remixes. Nothing offensively bad, mind you, but without much in the way of innovation it sounds like stock IDM gone stale: the nine-minute ""Marina"" sets Barcelona street accordion against a tired trip-hop beat, ""Independencia"" scatters wholesale beat flurries amongst minimalist piano...Juergen calls it ""pluckernder, verschmitzter Ambient from the PowerBook,"" and I have to agree with him-- provided ""pluckernder"" and ""verschmitzter"" are as negative as they sound. The organization of Reset the Preset makes it nice and clear what Console is best at producing: the digitized indie-pop of the first disc, and his work with The Notwist. Stripped of traditional song structures and without a band to manipulate, Gretschmann's work can't seem to find a foothold to distinguish itself from the catalogs of other keyboard-slingers. As a result, only occasionally do Console's ""sound surfaces join themselves perfectly unexpectedly from single noises and away-rinse us."" Goddamn, no way can I top that.","It's fairly common-- or at least I hope it is-- for critics to see what other folks are saying ...

St. Anger,Metallica,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44a13d197565213bf0c/1:1/w_160/725dc285.jpg,2003-06-15 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5250-st-anger/,Elektra,"A twisted barbed wire sign spans the entrance to the Ben Elektra Kibbutz in Metulla, Israel. It reads: ""And Justice for All."" There, in the country's northernmost town, pinched by Lebanon, and set in a valley as arid and colorless as an Anton Corbijn photo, my brothers and I assembled compact discs for Elektra Records, far from the reach of cable modems and CDRWs. After long days of picking rare bloodberries from barbed bushes for the screened St. Anger covers, which Lars assured us during his weekly motivational videos would only drive hard copy sales, I stripped my soiled black overalls, checked the bunks for banana spiders and sand ants, and settled in to read a tattered copy of Karl ""Geezer"" Marx and Frederick ""Freddi"" Engels' Metal Manifesto. Few historians care to document the period in the early 1850s when the pair, influenced by the heart-wrenching blue-collar poems of Bob Seger, abandoned the Bund der Gerechten, shaved their beards, applied eye-silver and rouge, and produced a series of simpler, populist manifestos. Often, I found myself reading the first line by Zippolight, unable to proceed further, lulling myself to sleep with its mantra: ""A spectre is haunting Metal - the spectre of Metallica."" Decades removed from its writing I didn't find the assertion particularly leveling or insightful. Rather, I was amused by its irony. Originally, Marx and Engels had hoped to shock their staid, academic readers with imagery of the undead, as with the Pushead-inked ""Red Monsta"" devouring Europe on the cover to their earlier Communist Manifesto. Now the word ""spectre"" struck me only as a reminder that Metallica had long given up the ghost. The manifesto remained only a document of arrogance and comedy. Marx continued, ""Metallica is already acknowledged by all Rock powers to be itself a power."" And yet, when MTV recently bestowed Metallica with ""Icon"" status, they could only dredge up Kelly Osbourne, Ja Rule, Sum 41, Godsmack, Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Lisa Marie Presley, and Snoop Dogg in tribute. Time had only made the rest of the text increasingly contradictory and meaningless. Marx and Engels had seen Metal as the antisocial soundtrack that could topple pop for the hearts of the young. ""Pop has converted the guitarist, the songwriter, the drummer, the man behind the boards, into its paid laborers,"" they vented. ""The Major Labels cannot exist without continually revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relation between fans and artists."" I read that last line while seated in a mule cart heading toward the Cardboard Folding Hut. Behind me, shimmering cylinders of stacked St. Anger discs stood in tight rows, an electrical current coursing through them for defense. I snapped the book shut, sickened by the absurdity. If only Marx had lived to see the sides flip over a dwindling battle line. For the first time, a technological advance-- MP3s and digital downloading-- spelled victory for the proletariat. File-sharing had become as anti-establishment as Marx had envisioned metal sounding. And Metallica, Marx's metal champion, had dropped an iron firewall between their music and their fans, who, despite their revolutionary ripping, were, for the most part, bourgeoisie boys choosing bands based on how the logos looked protractor-scratched into study hall desks. We kibbutz workers, who lived here by choice, manufacturing Metallica CDs, faced time in the Lightless Cell if found touching or ""experiencing"" St. Anger before its shipping date. Yet James Hetfield seemed to always sing about being locked inside a Lightless Cell as a badge of honor. Irony upon irony upon irony. Then again, Marx and Engels did grow their beards back and move on to more ambitious projects. A banana spider bit into Ktulu the Mule's heel. The animal reared. The cart spilled its contents, the CDs and myself, into the dust. A safety cut the electrical field protecting St. Anger. As the cart master attempted to rein the bucking animal, I slipped a disc into my overalls. After lights out (or ""enjoy the black"" as it was called), my bunkmates and I listened to the disc for which we had so diligently worked. What an utter mess. I saved 300 boxtops of Of Wolf and Man Cereal and bought a ticket to Israel for this? Lars Ulrich had taken the return to ""real Metal"" quite literally, playing a drumset consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell. The kit's high-end clamor ignored the basic principles of drumming: timekeeping. Fittingly, Ulrich's scrapyard racket rang senselessly like quickening, imploding industry under filtered, stream-of-cliché riffing. The gimmick overwhelmed entire songs, chiming hollowly over all else. Hetfield and Hammett's guitars underwent more processing than cat food. When they both speedstrummed through ""St. Anger"", and most other movements, H&H; seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise. A bevy of pedals-- including the decidedly un-metal wah-wah-- jingled conspicuously like a massive charm bracelet... I mean, a string of skulls. A string of iron skulls. A dry, crackling blooze melody squeezed out by Hammett on ""Some Kind of Monster"" brought to mind the time I used my practice amp as a stool in hanging a Ride the Lightning poster over my cot. The amp teetered and toppled, sending my foot right through the speaker cone. From then on I could only produce sounds exact to those on ""Some Kind of Monster"". I just never thought to release them during the kibbutz's mandatory ""riffstorming"" sessions monitored by Hetfield via satellite from his motorcycle factory. Bob Rock's bass neither bobbed nor rocked; it simply hid like an undulating grey amoeboid of sound, much like the web of hate pent inside the mind of the ""Invisible Kid"". ""Invisible Kid"" towered as an example of Metallica's new alloy of ineptitude. In the video feeds streaming throughout the mess hall, Hetfield repeatedly reminded us of the cathartic, psychological process behind St. Anger. This implied a personal, emotional vent. However, Hetfield can only convey feeling through the persona of the implied ""invisible kid"" who cowers from parents and rejection in every song, mirrored in the bedrooms of their audience. Such juvenile confessionals as, ""I hurt inside/ I hide inside/ But I'll show you,"" and, ""Mama, why's it rainin' in my room,"" sound ridiculous coming from the mouth of a 40 year-old man. Is this how he talks to his shrink? These muscle car confessionals and jerky, rough-edged transitions sounded not so much like metal, but Bruckheimer emo. Like Tim Kinsella, Hetfield found word pleasure in nursery puns such as ""purify/pure if I"" and ""ominous/I'm in us."" When ""Frantic"" cut from the grunting, ""My lifestyle determines my deathstyle"" refrain and shifted into the cooed ""keep on searching"" breakdown, it smelled strongly of sloppy pseudo-virtuoso bands like The Jazz June or Spitalfield. Emo bands found the simple process of merely moving from quiet to loud to be breathtaking. They wrote songs where beauty and melody was assumed on the count of clean guitar and picking chords, despite the fact that the two guitars had no knowledge of each other. In Metallica's case, the result was somehow worse for sounding so calculated and plotted in ProTools. ProTools had never been metal. ProTools never snorted ants up his FireWire from the side of the pool while urinating down a woman's dress. ProTools never inserted the sound of a chainsaw into the opening of ""Black Metal"" off the album Black Metal. ProTools never burned churches in Norway. And yet, ProTools had a major hand in assembling both ""American Life"" and ""Frantic"". The disc ended as the sun was rising over Syria. Had it lasted that long? My comrades and I looked at each other, stupefied. Our only memory was of forced effects, laughable lyrics, and audio surgical scars. I sat up and began packing my duffel. I'd rather pick bananas. One comrade suggested smuggling the disc out of the kibbutz to leak to the Internet. If Metallica were such proud artists behind their music, unable to both allow downloading and refund money after purchase, then we should warn others. Metallica had become less a band leading a genre than a team soaking up payroll in a second-tier sport. This was NASCAR, WWE. Logos, sneers, mustaches, and beards. Hair grows back, but the Jheri Curl of insincerity, of contradiction, and of compromising a cause never straightens.","A twisted barbed wire sign spans the entrance to the Ben Elektra Kibbutz in Metulla, Israel.

The Mess We Made,Matt Elliott,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4c5e6ef95969322df4/1:1/w_160/cacd207c.jpg,2003-06-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2754-the-mess-we-made/,Merge,"Inevitably, there's some symbolism implied when an artist, after years of lurking behind a semi-obscure pseudonym-- head down, eyes averted, shoulders squeezed and high-- puts out a record under his common name. Former Third Eye Foundation principal Matt Elliott has spent most of his recording career as a modish UK hipster in a dark disguise: thus, the leap from ""Third Eye Foundation"" to ""Matt Elliott"" should involve a nice dose of lurid confessionalism, some newfound honesty, a running-around-naked-in-daylight reinvention of self. Right? Hey, turn this car around! Someone left the personal catharsis at home! The Mess We Made, Matt Elliott's proper debut as Matt Elliott is, at least atmospherically, just as shadowed and sinister as his late, orchestral Third Eye work. Despite some significant tactical shifts and a deliberate creep away from jungle electronics, it's time to dig back into your Matt Elliott vocabulary sacks and whip out the perfunctory TEF adjectives: spectral, nightmarish, spare. Somehow, they all still apply. Overarching artistic sensibilities endure, and name-altering is about as thematically relevant as changing your clothes. Technically, though, there are loads of notable switches here that indicate an immediate (if not sweeping) content transformation to accompany Elliott's bright new cover text. Mostly beat/percussionless, and sprinkled with muted, heavily layered vocals, The Mess We Made is full of peculiar, often-inaudible chants, lots of piano, horns, strings, chimes, and the vocal prowess of something called ""The Drunk Ensemble of Chancelade"". Drunken choruses seem about right. The Mess We Made vehemently demands an appropriate context, and few scenarios seem more apt for this collection than the tired, dull inebriation of a throbbing post-drink comedown, when attempts at concise vocalization turn into gooey, muted singalongs. Unseen roars, sighs and echoes slip in with every pause. Disorientation abounds. Swallow, slip on this disc, and hope you remember where you live. Opener ""Let Us Break"" is full of darting, near-operatic vocal swells that sound more like fully embodied church organs than human vocal cords; thick, muddled phrases push hard through an otherwise desolate void of piano and drone. Elliott may be going more organic now, but he hasn't lost a grip on his knob-and-keyboard bag of tricks: ""Cotard's Syndrome"" builds slowly, backwards synth lines and switched vocals openly encouraging stumbling, dribbling dementia. ""Forty Days"" starts vaguely medieval, with impressively picked classical guitars (sharp and wildly melodic), cello, and eventually, some rumbling drum fills. Nearly five minutes in, the song slips straight into a gaping hole, trading its rich, golden glow for a stark, percussive landscape. Disturbing, complicated, and enthrallingly strange, The Mess We Made requires patience, and, ideally, an already established taste for Elliott's previous ambient output. For the uninitiated, this is a record that will open up more and more with each subsequent listen; it's like giving blinking eyes a chance to adjust to a dark room-- shapes emerge slowly, breaking up and coalescing as your vision adjusts, realigns, modifies. Schedule some time for this record's somber, protracted payoff, and loosen your grip on that stereo remote, friends: The Mess We Made is a gradual realization.","Inevitably, there's some symbolism implied when an artist, after years of lurking behind a semi-obscure pseudonym-- head down, eyes ...

City Reading,AirAlessandro Baricco,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a029b1335d7bf1697f6a/1:1/w_160/57c3ceda.jpg,2003-06-12 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/79-city-reading/,Astralwerks,"Ora capisco cosa si prova ad ascoltare i Looper quando non si conosce l'inglese. Do you understand this sentence? It says, ""Now I know what it feels like to listen to Looper when you can't understand English,"" as translated into Italian by Google. And what I mean by it is this: If you don't know Italian, I wouldn't recommend picking up this record. City Reading is a collaboration between Air and writer Alessandro Baricco, in which Baricco reads text from his novel, City, to Air's backing tracks. The three explain how it went down in the liner notes: *""*City is a book. The idea was to read some pages of it aloud, in a theater full of people, with musical accompaniment throughout. We did this in Rome, in November of 2002. It went well. The audience applauded, and we enjoyed ourselves. So the idea became: to make a CD in which a voice is reading, surrounded by music. We recorded the CD in Paris, a month later. We enjoyed ourselves. Now the idea is to make a video game. But we're not really sure about that."" I don't doubt that this pairing set the Roman throng cheering. Air's tasteful, wistful, and occasionally mournful tunes are an intelligent compliment to a reading, and their decision to mix lots of acoustic guitar with organ, flute and sound effects subliminally bonds with the plot (City is a trilogy of surreal, poetic Westerns.) And however Baricco's prose reads in his native language (an English translation is included in the CD booklet), there's no doubting that he has a fantastically great speaking voice-- clear, rhythmic, musical and dramatic. It was, I'm sure, an inspired pairing. All that, however, isn't enough to add up to repeated listens for me, because I can't follow it. I tried scanning the English translation of the text while listening, but it didn't interest me. Baricco's voice is very high in the mix, so much so that focusing on anything but him speaking the words is impossible. Even so, it probably wouldn't matter much if the mix were more music-oriented. Somewhere back there, behind Baricco's purr, Air's tracks sound nice enough, although the cues they've constructed are obviously repetitive and meant as a soundtrack to something more important. Though I get off on the pure sound of language as much as the next guy, I still don't find City Reading entertaining. I'm not complaining, really. It is what it is, and there's certainly no reason why Air should feel compelled to pander to my embarrassing monolingualism by working with, say, an English writer. All I can say is that City Reading is essentially a book on tape with high production values in a language I don't understand, and that, even if it were released in an instrumental version, it wouldn't be particularly breathtaking. Caveat emptor. ","Ora capisco cosa si prova ad ascoltare i Looper quando non si conosce l'inglese. Do you understand this sentence ...

"Flying Saucer Tour, Vol. 1 / Love, Laughter and Truth",Bill Hicks,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0cec0084474cd0c3248/1:1/w_160/6dad80d2.jpg,2003-06-12 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11753-flying-saucer-tour-vol-1-love-laughter-and-truth/,Ryko,"""I've been on what I call my flying saucer tour which means like flying saucers. I, too, have been appearing in small southern towns in front of handfuls of hillbillies lately, and uh... I've been doubting my own existence,"" lamented Bill Hicks in his unmistakably rueful Texas drawl. Speaking about the perils and inherent loneliness of life on the road as a nomadic stand-up comic, there wasn't a member of the audience capable of ignoring the arrant honesty of his words. Bill Hicks is our planet's most oft-revered, imitated, plagiarized and anonymous comedic talent. For as many people whose lives were impacted so indelibly by this man's genius, wit, and irreverence, he remains shrouded in mystery to the general public. When his life was tragically snatched away by pancreatic cancer at the age of 32, Hicks hovered precariously on the precipice of superstardom. Having attracted national attention as the first act banned from a CBS television program since Elvis Presley, and with a legion of obstreperous followers behind him, Bill Hicks' untimely passing served as his ultimate comedic closer. With a career built upon hostility, angst, scathing social commentary, and above all, compassion, Hicks' abrupt departure virtually sealed his fate as a contemporary cultural enigma. In the nine years since his passing, Bill Hicks has taken on neo-mythical status. Drawing plaudits from myriad pop culture icons, album dedications from the likes of Tool and Radiohead, and galvanizing the malevolence of cynics everywhere, his fame has soared exponentially. Unlike so many mediocre icons who find notoriety and mass-media acceptance in death, however, Bill Hicks was a man whose art transcended all time and spatial limits and thus established his legend long before his enormous heart stopped beating on February 26th, 1994. Bill Hicks was Noam Chomsky, David Sedaris, Lenny Bruce, and Carlos Castaneda rolled into one. Where other comedians like the late great Sam Kinison identified and ridiculed the problems of modern life for the purpose of shock and laughter, Hicks abhorred the passivity of the populace to such lengths that his rants rang closer to a guerilla revolutionary than a talking head with a microphone. No one has ever been more vocal about the evils of disposable pop culture. A society rendered mentally mute by the ills of marketing, advertising, and corporate dogma spelled the very death of this country and by extension, western civilization. Years before Chuck Palahnuik drafted a blueprint for eschewing convention by relinquishing all ties to commercialism in Fight Club, and thus making anti-commercialism more commercial, Hicks scripted a rousing fight song with the intent of impugning everything unholy and dangerous in the world of capitalism. Foremost on the list was the evil known as laziness. Not laziness in the casually procrastinating sense, but rather the much graver error of cultural indolence. Essentially, people who've grown weary of their power to discern submit to the demands of fictional authoritative figures (i.e. media) who dictate their tastes, interests, opinions, and beliefs. What results from this ""dumbing down"" is a culture of people who have forgotten how to judge correctly. A group of people-- some of whom are reading this review-- that find themselves on the wet end of a degenerate culture. A culture erected from the cancerous mutation of hype machines, spin, and an elitist social sect designed to capitalize on the acquiescence of its members. These same idle sheep find themselves flocking to inferior merchandise simply to nestle snuggly within an arbitrary hipness quotient, and because of the concomitant satisfaction in rallying behind mediocre products with strong PR. In collaboration with the Bill Hicks Estate, Ryko recently released two CDs worth of (mostly) previously unreleased material entitled Flying Saucer Tour, Vol. 1 and Love, Laughter and Truth. Recorded at a non-smoking venue June 20th, 1991 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city better suited for gun shows, tractor pulls, and Klan rallies than the musings of Hicks, Flying Saucer Tour, Vol. 1 gives us a keen view of Hicks at his most indecently acerbic. He starts off with one of his customary targets (non-smokers), informing the largely disinterested crowd that, despite their effort to remain healthy, smoke-free beings, their demise is as inevitable as his. The sheer frenzy of Hicks' nicotine addiction-- according to Hicks, ""I go through two lighters a day""-- is matched only by his lust for disgusting the audience with references ranging from tracheotomies, premature birth, and lung cancer. Within a mere ten minutes it's become painfully apparent that Hicks has completely alienated the incoherent Pittsburgh crowd. When the sound of low grumbling is the only response to a rant on the cyclically relevant tensions in Iraq, Hicks dubs the crowd the worst he's ever faced. After several more unsuccessful attempts to rouse interest, Hicks focuses his vitriol solely on the audience. With his frustration nearly at critical level, Hicks taunts the slack-jawed audience with a promise of ""dick jokes"" mere seconds before (repeatedly) pleading that a nuclear holocaust befalls the mostly yuppie crowd. Although Hicks generally thrived on a perplexed audience, the uncanny bemusement of the Pittsburgh crowd on Saucer, Vol. 1 forced Hicks to cloak most of his societal observations in blatant shock. If there's one detriment to the disc, it's Hicks' tendency to push moral limits a bit too far for gasps and groans. For every schoolyard chord Hicks strikes, there's at least three absolute chasms of silent confusion, wherein the entirety of his commentary on the corruption of President Bush (the elder), the governmentally endorsed lies on narcotics, and the value of pornography in art is completely lost on the audience. Only when Hicks posits celebrities hawking commercial products on television as akin to fellating Satan's penis is there anything resembling a functional synapse present in the Pittsburgh comedy club. By contrast, Love, Laughter and Truth functions as a sort of greatest hits package, compiling recordings made in Denver, San Ramon, San Francisco, and West Palm Beach from 1990 to 1993. Most fascinating about Love, Laughter and Truth is the evolutionary window it provides us on the career of Bill Hicks. We witness his development from the lounge lizard rube to the denunciatory comedic sage. When Hicks unleashes a rampage on the commodification of ""drugs"" in the form of subversive Public Service Announcements and beer commercials, he deftly blends the thermonuclear vocal explosion preferred by fellow Texan Sam Kinison with the kind of shadow government social paranoia familiar to fans of George Carlin. But while Kinison was content to rest on fireworks, and Carlin typically rants to draw blood, Hicks seized the role of sobering realist. When confronted by an audience more comfortable with schoolyard sex fare than education and self-awareness, Hicks assumes the voice of a member of his audience and recriminates, ""Doesn't he know about our puritanical self-hatred of our own body and its desires? The only way we can find relief is through the medium of penis material."" George Carlin, and to some extent Dennis Miller, have built careers upon spewing facts and figures in the most abrasive manner possible. In fact, Carlin's famous bit on euphemistic language can be viewed as a crude blueprint to what would shortly become Hicks' legacy. Expressing disgust at how emotion has been squelched out of the English language in order to create a softer existence for mankind, Carlin astutely recognizes the inherent danger to masking and muddling meaning with lots of extraneous words, syllables, and hyphens. Real life Newspeak was always a major preoccupation of Hicks' as well. And although George Carlin was content to condemn the government and lukewarm civilization who'd allowed meaningless jargon to pervert the language, Bill Hicks always remained optimistic about the possibility, no matter how remote, that civilization might one day awake from its golden slumber. We live in a time where the Orwellian lexicon is at its zenith. Between the low and steady buzz of ""weapons of mass destruction,"" the thinly veiled liberty confiscation machine dubbed ""The Department of Homeland Security,"" a feckless, oil-smeared ""road map"" to peace for people who've hated each other since time immemorial, and a feel-good fruit colored Terrorist Threat spectrum that has more in common with a bag of Skittles than a system of effective deterrence, it's quite simple to lose sight to distinguish what is real from what isn't. I've often felt cheated that Hicks wasn't alive to witness September 11th, 2001 and the subsequent chain of events. Aside from the comedic field day he'd undoubtedly have with the American programs mentioned above, Hicks might have provided some of the most lucid and trenchant analysis of exactly what's happened in the past two years. Hicks' supreme gift was being blessed with a coping skill sorely lacking in most of us: the ability to instantiate what is real from what is illusory, what is valid from what is disposable. At the crux of his work was the following question: does the plight Beyond Good and Consumerism imply foregoing personal happiness? If my years studying Hicks have been fruitful, the answer would be no. We can remain informed and aware in spite of marketing ploys and ambiguous language designed to lower standards and public awareness, delighted by the fact that we get the joke while others do not. As Hicks himself might have said, we're all capable of loving rather than fearing. Some of us require chemical assistance to attain higher consciousness, while others will find that enhanced state in something as basic as the companionship of another person. Whatever our means of mind expansion, we must never lose sight of the fact that life is nothing more than a brief detour to something better, something more fulfilling. Bill Hicks dedicated his life to showing us the funniest possible route.","

For Frosty Mornings and Summer Nights,Xela,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aac7b1335d7bf169971d/1:1/w_160/6ffc0c35.gif,2003-06-12 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8818-for-frosty-mornings-and-summer-nights/,Neo Ouija,"There's something familiar about Xela's sound, a feeling that you've heard this chord, that click, this melody somewhere before. It doesn't nag at you or scream ""derivative""; it's not, for example, like hearing a sampled loop and not resting until you've pinned down the source. Instead, one gets the feeling from For Frosty Mornings and Summer Nights of settling into old pajamas, sitting in oversized chairs on the beach, getting lost in the woods behind your house on purpose. A nostalgic mood tints the whole album, creating an aural equivalent to Super 8 home movies-- taken, most likely, on Mars. Like Boards of Canada, whose artwork and imagery intentionally conjure visions of nylon jackets, sepia tone and childhood circa 1977 in general, Xela (John Twells) crafts songs that are clear in their emotion, focused and difficult to misread. Not a little of the album's approach is inspired by Twell's friend Lee Norkin and his work under the guise of Metamatics; his Neo Ouija album is a definite mentor here, though without the more dance-fueled rhythms Norkin flexes with that name. ""Under the Glow of Streetlights"" and the ponderous, patient ""The Long Walk Home at Midnite"", whose pleasures are revealed slowly and with keen pacing, are good examples of the beats to be found on For Frosty Mornings: as fractured as Dos Tracks or early Pole, but with a wide berth between the pieces. At their most coherent, the rhythms on the record are inspired click 'n' cut textures, lazy BPMs that ride the ambience through till the end. The closer, ""Last Breathe"", pulls off a beat I can only describe as tropical, and backs it with a crying trumpet and the sobs of a woman, and while Manitoba and Marumari can conjure similar vibes, it's impressive how well Xela works it. It's the ambient elements, the gentle ebb and flow of layers of synth and extended chords, where the influences show the most. Marumari, Selected Ambient Works, WE; all of them know how to pull this technique off, and Xela adds himself to their ranks by copping a few licks here and there: ""Afraid of Nowhere"" bears The Mark of the 'Twin, and as excellent as ""Japanese Whispers"" gets, it's still leaning a bit heavily on the shoulder of Prefuse 73, with Music Has the Right to Children driving it to the airport. The sullen ""An Abandoned Robot"" fares better, raining down shimmering chimes into a thick soup of chords, rippling out and out and out, punctuated with Oval-ish skips and crackles provided by Stefan Lewandowski. I drive through the woods to work now, and with all the partially sunny days lately, For Frosty Mornings has been perfect for a sleepy, half-lit drive home over the mountain. It gets under your skin not with hooks or basslines, but with a mood that the chosen tones and pacing enforce for the duration of the record. It plays like a cohesive whole, a steady set of hills and valleys with perfect curves. It may go unnoticed on a label like Neo Ouija, whose content can often be described on similar terms, but Xela has put out a fucking nice record, a chill-out album that makes the term ""chill-out"" respectable again. This album is a sleeper in every sense of the word. Funkstörung for the content and drowsy.","There's something familiar about Xela's sound, a feeling that you've heard this chord, that click, this\n ...

Let's Get Ready to Crumble,The Russian Futurists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2dcea9e61561daa4b4d/1:1/w_160/d74344a4.jpg,2003-06-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6879-lets-get-ready-to-crumble/,Upper Class,"Matthew Adam Hart's songs-- The Russian Futurists' songs-- are designed to go from his bedroom to yours. Maybe even from his actual bed to yours: if it's easy to imagine him recording parts of Let's Get Ready to Crumble huddled cross-legged with the blankets over his shoulders, it's even easier to imagine a lot of people listening to them that way. This arrangement hasn't been a novelty for many years now, but in this case it's important, because Hart makes it important. Whether he made this music in a bathrobe or a three-piece suit, it's still one of indie's best bedroom pop records in years, and the illusion of that bathrobe is a big part of what gets it there. That ""best in years"" is, of course, mostly if you go for this sort of thing. The reasons why are almost too obvious to get at-- Hart just does a bang-up job-- and the simplest descriptions tend to make it sound much worse than it is. A one-man home-recording act with probable Beach Boys and admitted Beatles fixations? (""I still get chills,"" one song goes, ""when I hear Paul sing 'Golden Slumbers.'"" This is not the best sales pitch.) A cheapo-synthesizer enthusiast whose songs sound more than a little like The Magnetic Fields used to? (Circa Holiday.) A record that will likely appeal to fans of The Shins' Oh, Inverted World and The Postal Service's Give Up? There's nothing necessarily wrong with either of those records or any of those things, but these sentences describe far too many anonymous, infuriatingly boring albums-- albums one suspects record stores stock directly into their bargain bins-- for anyone not to wonder why The Russian Futurists should be much better. Well, but: Hart's just awfully good at this. He's the sort of songwriter whose tunes are instantly and comfortably his: it's not the individual tracks of Let's Get Ready to Crumble that wind up stuck in your head but his whole approach to melody and sound-- humming a few bars of ""It's Not Really Cold When It Snows"" turns into humming a few bars of ""The Matador's Theme"", and that turns into putting the record on again for another listen. So Hart comes bounding out with the terrific title track, drum machine popping, organ chords stabbing, and synthetic string plucks following the melody as his sings his opening manifesto: ""I do pop cause that's what my heart goes."" And wow, it really does sound like heart-bursting enthusiasm, in that way The Flaming Lips are always reaching for but have never nailed so casually. I imagine they'd be as impressed as anyone to hear that a song can seem quite this peppy (and quite this heartbroken) without turning precious or cloying; there's even some weird level on which you can start to think Hart sounds sort of badass about it. There's plenty more to be impressed by, too, even apart from the endlessly idiosyncratic hooks. There's the fact that, for a bedroom pop guy, Hart has a remarkable grasp on rhythm: the title track strides like crazy, ""Precious Metals"" has a shuffle-and-clap beat that wouldn't be so out of place on a 70s soul record, and ""The Matador's Theme"" sports the spare, stiff drumbeat of a marching anthem; the clip-clop cadences of his vocals manage to throw in twists and pile on words like nothing could be more natural. There's also the (wall of) sound, immersive to the point of drowsiness, which has reverb painting space around the synths' cold humming and icicle-pretty plucky or the occasional acoustic guitar: those early Magnetic Fields records never had quite this same cold room, fuzzy blanket effect. And then there's the extra quilt on the sulky, doe-eye baths of synth-pop romanticism that dot this record. ""It's Not Really Cold When It Snows"" is the show-stopper, with a melody that sounds like it was piped in from some alternate version of 1984 where it rained all year; ""It's Actually Going to Happen"" is its close cousin, with the drums dropping back again to let Hart strain sweet and hopeful at the top of his range. Elsewhere, his heart just goes pitter-pop in all of its various ways, and the worst it gets-- maybe on ""You Dot, Me Dot, T-Dot"", a smiley ode to lovin' in Toronto-- is vaguely slight, a little too blank and well-meaning to engage. Most people already know if that's the sort of thing that makes them melt and cuddle or storm off wondering if the guy wants a cookie for being so sweet. Hart's melt-and-cuddle just happens to be top-shelf, and to have enough backbone to occasionally get beyond itself. As for the bedroom pop fix, the starry-eyed melodic idealism, and the swoony toy-keyboard love songs, it's like I said: here it is, done really well.","Matthew Adam Hart's songs-- The Russian Futurists' songs-- are designed to go from his bedroom to yours.

I can still remember my DID souvenirs from that visit, as I spent much of that winter vacation trying to get through those first thirty minutes of the Melvins' Lysol, unable to understand the glutinous tom and tarred guitar they mercilessly slathered on my young cerebellum. I'm more adept at swallowing the sludge now, which helps when Pelican Songs' ""The Most Futile Insurance/Pelican Song"" medley comes burrowing up from the tundra at full bore. Hibernating in the vaults somewhere since 1994, and adding another session from 1997, Pelican Songs is a collection of long un-issued recordings by Finland's Worms, who previously released but a handful of singles in their country. The group promptly sets itself up inside Hawkwind's cavernous wind tunnel, with three guitars cranked for maximum pummel damage. For the first half-hour, it's all roaring vortices and attempted rock levitation that the Acid Mothers Temple would surely appreciate; these guys deliver the goods with a hypnotic, crunching slowness. Worms, who've been making this noise for nigh on twenty years, hinge on the guitar and murmured vocals of Veli Pesonen, and while he excels in the former role, his leads snaking in and out of feedback squalls at will through the oceanic onslaught of the band, his vocals are droopier than a mantra-chanting Morrissey with peanut butter lodged in the roof of his mouth. Pesonen never strays far from the simple English that merely rests atop the rotund bottom-end laid out by Timo Vuorio and Petri Leini. And early on, this isn't entirely irksome, but as he flatly repeats the line, ""I can't escape my mind""-- in a gothic Michael Gira patois, no less-- the listener is also imprisoned, by the tedium that pulls the middle of Pelican Songs into a wallowing quagmire. As the disc wears on, these decelerated progressions, appropriate in the opener, begin to smother any attempt at escape, reveling in a moody sameness that's less an effort at heavy minimalism than the inability to get out of first gear. Worms firmly and finally entrench themselves in a more Melvins mire toward disc's end, hauling a heavy payload that grinds out their clutch. Distorted wails on the 17-minute closer ""Border"" help the epic pound along with monolithic, overdriven purpose, and though it's supremely senseless and menacing as it barrels down the highway, it leaves me wishing the entire record were driven with the same lead foot.","When I first visited New York City in high school, there were only two things I wanted to do: buy ...

Halloween Party,Pink Anvil,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a161b1335d7bf1698241/1:1/w_160/957ffb39.jpg,2003-06-11 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6520-halloween-party/,Ipecac,"""So when does this little horse of yours actually start doing something?"" ""First off, it's a pony, not a 'little horse.' Secondly, the pony takes a little while to get acclimated to new people. Give it another minute, then it'll blow you away, I swear."" I rolled my eyes and sank back into the uncomfortable lawn chair. My reason for sitting idly in the hot sun that day-- wrinkled feet soaking in a brilliantly colored kiddy-pool-- was my friend Trent, who'd invited me over to see the new animal he had gotten for his little girl. Enticing me with the promise that the pet had a talent I would have to see to believe, his Shetland-- coincidentally named Pink Anvil-- had yet to impress me with anything beyond how one little creature could produce so much dung. Eventually fed up-- and halfway to a heat stroke-- I gathered my things to leave as Trent attempted to bar my way. Suddenly, his hand in my face, I heard it-- the sinister opening chords of Schubert's The Erlking, simultaneously hummed and neighed by the tiny and unassuming Pink Anvil. The lied was ugly but recognizable, nearly making it worth sitting in listless uneasiness for the past few hours. ""That's pretty cool!"" With visions of Schumann and Carnaval in mind, I inquired, ""What else can it do?"" ""Uh, unfortunately,"" Trent said, his eyes not meeting mine, ""that's its only trick."" I was disappointed, but his ashamed admission brought to mind an interesting inquiry-- should the listening public demand anything more of a novelty act than what it is-- a novelty? This question was begged many times during my exposure to Halloween Party, the debut album by Ministry's Paul Barker and Max Brody, working together under the non-metaphorical nomen Pink Anvil. Described as a continuation of the avant-garde experimentalism of Brian Eno and David Byrne's My Life In the Bush of Ghosts, Halloween Party suggests Brody and Parker might have slept through the majority of the classic album, awaking only to hear a few minutes of ""Mea Culpa"" before deciding that that was ""good enough."" Whereas Eno and Byrne sought to create myriad moods, textures and musical forms with their project, Halloween Party-- recorded near the Mexican border using a similar setup of FM radio, patchbay, and some delay pedals-- creates merely a two dimensional backdrop of horror-show found sounds and campy B-movie soundtracks (""Unmerry"", ""Rubber Suit, Pt. 2"", and ""Adagio in Cb""), with an occasional sprinkling of harsh programmed drum-beats in the style that has come to be expected from the Ministry-brethren (""Downer"", ""Sugarwater"", and ""Near Death""). ""Rubber Suit"" (traditional) delivers some surprises as a satisfying minor-chord keyboard progression is interrupted by a series of screams, moans, and howls that nearly jars the listener out of the catatonic lull induced by the album, providing one of the few sincerely enjoyable moments of the disc. Unfortunately, the moment is ruined as a rush of white noise and borrowed horns quickly betray the suspense, causing the song to flounder in its own directionless and mocking continuation. Even more regrettable: with the sense of expectancy established, the remainder of the album-- particularly the otherwise pleasant, ""Desert""-- is robbed of any gripping shock value, which is the lone motive one might have in purchasing an album like Halloween Party in the first place. Press comparisons peg the duo as a contemporary of noise-artists Black Dice and Sightings, but on the merits of this album alone, it's difficult to understand the foundation for these claims. The bands mentioned above exhibit dynamic displays of instrumentation with rich and inventive layering of the sonic building blocks at their disposal, while Pink Anvil is content to haphazardly plug away at the dried husk of a once venerable musical concept. It's unfair to presume they should share the limelight with those on the forefront of musical innovation simply because they have more history: as Pink Anvil, they're second-stringers, a pair of transient one-trick ponies.","""So when does this little horse of yours actually start doing something?""

How the West Was Won,Led Zeppelin,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbbabf31b7dc7155db4/1:1/w_160/5560072a.jpg,2003-06-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4707-how-the-west-was-won/,Atlantic,"It means something when a rock and roll band is described with such passionately divisive rhetoric as Led Zeppelin. The band was a big, dumb example of every opulent shark-story rock cliché of the 1970s: They were heavy-handed, irresponsible purveyors of the ""blues""; they were fake hippies and fake mystics who managed to strip even the grandest statements in rock of their power via mind-numbing drum solos and bowed-guitar expositions; they were the original Spinal Tap, replete with whole songs about Greek myths, ancient Celtic rituals, completely inappropriate bits of Bach spliced into Page's ""Heartbreaker"" solo, and a manager who was at once imposing, apologetic and the butt of Bob Dylan's jokes. One more thing: They were the greatest rock band to ever set foot on a stage, so what they fuck are you talking about? As they often do, things started small for this band of castaways and unknowns: Session guitarist Jimmy Page found himself thrown under the bus, holding the shitbag when The Yardbirds called it quits smack in the middle of a 1968 American tour. He was forced to piece together whatever ensemble he could to continue the tour, finding bassist and fellow session man John Paul Jones through a newspaper ad. Teen vocalist Robert Plant and his mate John Bonham were in Birmingham, discovered by Page on a talent-hunting expedition. The band were a rag-tag bunch, who were, if anything, most certainly not The Yardbirds. Nevertheless, after a few successful shows in the UK, they went to America, billed as ""Supporting Act"" in a another Spinal Tap twist of fate. By the end of their tour, they were headlining, and the rest is history. Right? Well, it's tricky. Led Zeppelin, authors of the most-played-song-in-radio-history and so many hallowed riffs and sexual double-entendres involving fruit, are so played-out at this point that they've managed to become taken for granted. Nobody blinks an eye when ""Rock and Roll"" shows up in a car commercial, because the band's music has long since become a pop-culture building block. Most of their big tunes are recognizable to the point of losing their emotional impact-- think, haven't you heard enough of ""Whole Lotta Love"", ""Black Dog"" and ""Kashmir""? And I might give a month off the end of my life to be spared from ever crossing paths with ""Stairway to Heaven"" again. Sure, Zep is great, but their classic-rock staples have been burnt into our minds-- each song exactly the same every time we hear it-- as unchanging musical patterns, and made predictable by force of infinite repetition. By now I'd think I'd have gleaned about as much pleasure from their music as I possibly could. Still, one thing that always strikes me about all of their music-- particularly their first five or six records-- is how effortless they made it all seem. Classic riffs seem like grade school basics now, but Page actually had to come up with all that stuff. And if you listen really close, those guys were doing more than just banging out the blues-- they brought out the best of a British take on rock, via funky, surprisingly accomplished arrangements and song forms, and a very potent eclecticism rarely found in bands that cracked the mainstream (much less reigned over it). And yet, none of those credentials really make me want to hear ""The Battle of Evermore"" again. So what's next? Jimmy Page found the two 1972 Los Angeles shows featured on the triple disc How the West Was Won while poring over his archives for what was to be a straight DVD release. And just like that, new magic is cast, new legends are born. One of the interesting things about Zep (and if you believe the rockists, this holds true for any truly ""great"" band) is that they made their most definitive statements in concert. The shows on this set document a band who were able to wring squeals, clangs and beats out of material that had been well considered and digested a million times over by performers and audience alike. Yes, they stretch out, often to near excruciatingly immense duration, but they also emphasize their greatest talents. Chiefly, How the West Was Won serves up the band's muscle, sweaty heart and golden grandeur in an exhaustingly persuasive light. That, and a hundred of the best riffs you've ever heard. Disc 1 keeps the exploratory blues odysseys to a minimum, though hardly at the expense of the epic saga that was their live power. In fact, from the furious, breakneck take of ""Immigrant Song"" to the almost otherworldly, ethereal ""Going to California"", it's one of the best sets of live music I've ever heard on CD. The band rips through most of the harder numbers a few notches faster than the album versions, and in the process, staves off most of the over-familiarity prone to live records. ""Black Dog"" gets a speed metal intro. ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" is transformed from its classic boogie-rock into an altogether rougher, funky jab. ""That's the Way"" (possibly the only Zep tune still underrated) and ""Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp"" form an acoustic mini-set with ""Going to California"" that yet again shows these guys were a lot more than barrelhouse blues riffs and high-heeled groupies in the hallway. And then there's ""Stairway"". It would take a lot to make this one fresh again, but I'll say that their slightly thrashy run-through at the end (with Jones on... piano?) and a few new guitar tricks during the intro do small wonders. Things take a turn for the far-out on Disc 2, beginning with the in-out-back-in-again-hold-up-we're-out-now version of ""Dazed and Confused"". The band takes its time easing into the tune, with a spooky bass- and drum-led funeral procession intro, but soon enough finds the jam. The song's infamous mid-section freakout gets everything it could have possibly had coming to it, including unexpected lapses into ""The Crunge"" and ""Walter's Walk"", in addition to giving Page his solo space and then some. 25 (!!) minutes later, they find the road again, somehow all ending up in the same place. Perhaps to recover, they follow with brisk versions of ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" (sounding now like a brutal piece of blue funk rather than its more famous loungy rock version) and the then-unreleased ""Dancing Days"". And then, the monster: almost 20 minutes of pounding, snapping and crashing on ""Moby Dick"", courtesy of the rock-solid, gorilla-footed Bonzo, probably fresh from having a Roadster delivered to his hotel that morning. Truth be told, if you had to take a snack break about ten minutes in, I wouldn't blame you. ""Whole Lotta Love"" gets the epic expansion on Disc 3, including a medley of no less than four complete versions of old rock and roll tunes inserted smack in the middle. But before that happens, they pull out all the spacy effects available to the super-wealthy in 1972, and don't forget to liven them up with a little skank-beat (who knew Zep could play ska?). Despite the detour, ""Rock and Roll"" doesn't sound tired for it-- and it shouldn't, as Page took the best performances from two shows to concoct the three-disc ""concert."" And finally, the set ends in authentic 70s roots style with a cover of Willie Dixon's ""Bring It on Home"", beginning with an understated harmonica-led intro before ramming it all back down with the sick-ass beats and engulfing bass rumble that had defined the previous couple of hours. Is this really the blues? Is this Blues Hammer? Nothing like it, I'm afraid-- it's Led Zeppelin, and for better (yay) or worse (nay), they only knew how to hit their own thing. I'm not one for reminiscing the classics, and in fact, I'm pretty sick of hearing about how great everything was supposed to be all those years ago (whatever years you happen to be talking about). That said, Page and company have done a nice job making me believe I've missed out on something special even when I thought I knew all this stuff backwards and forwards. Far from just a fan relic, much of How the West Was Won seems definitive, and maybe that explains why it happens to be the biggest selling record in the country at the time of this writing. Maybe there are bands tearing shit up like this now, I can't really be sure, but of this I am: Zep ruled, check it.","It means something when a rock and roll band is described with such passionately divisive rhetoric as Led\n\ Zeppelin ...

Raw and Rare,The Von Bondies,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96f9d034d5c69bf3c56/1:1/w_160/176de3b1.jpg,2003-06-11 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8490-raw-and-rare/,Dim MakIn the Act,"There's an overabundance of garage rock bands these days-- dozens upon dozens of Estrus-styled fanboys, all imploding digital-age stooges caught in a chokehold, threatening to fold in on one other like uninspired origami. At this very moment, somewhere outside the Detroit city line, around a hidden bend, an overcrowded field of garage rockers are a-nodding their greasy hair to the cool summer breeze, endlessly enslaved by a 60s mixed metaphor, Camel non-filters spoiling the honeysuckle wonderfulness of the atmosphere. Whenever a genre explodes, begins copulating with itself, and goes to seed all kinds of reckless, it can be a bitch-and-a-half separating the singular wheat from the inbred chaff. If you listened to every third Nick Zinner wannabe in town, you'd never make it home to enjoy black coffee and the less co-opted strains of your record collection. Sorrow of all sorrows, you might even pass away with D4 on your walkman. Garage rock is the grunge of today, which makes grunge today's hair-metal and leaves the new Vince Neil-fronted Poison in pretty good striking position to make an ironic comeback by next Fall. When a trend gets this out-of-control, I usually nod away, figure the rest of those punk-asses can MC5 it out amongst themselves 'cause I'm too old to scour local toy stores for the musical equivalent of a Cabbage Patch Kid or Tickle Me Elmo. I'm framing a review of The Von Bondies in this backstory to better point out the Detroit foursome's achievement: of all the garage rock kids I've listened to in the past six months they're my favorite by a mile, and Raw and Rare, the group's live album-- a teaser to keep folks primed for their upcoming second full-length, Pawn Shoppe Heart-- is fucking spooky-ass, grimy rock-n-roll fun. Why a live record so early in the game? A fair enough question. But remember this: their Jack-White produced debut, 2001's Lack of Communication, sold 20,000 worldwide. That's nothing to sneeze at. This disc's fifteen live and prerecorded tracks were taken from two BBC Radio Broadcasts and a performance at the Lager House in the band's hometown (the two US-recorded tracks, ""Unknown"" and ""It Came from Japan"", are the grubbiest, and the only ones that sound fuzzily ""live"", in that tinny, almost-bad way-- I guess that's the ""raw"" of the title?) You get to hear the band tuning up, the crowd making little noises, the between-song banter, the songs expanding into finessed jam territory, and the dank echo of the room. Though the songs here are largely available as studio takes on Lack of Communication, a band like The Von Bondies benefits from such unadorned documentation; in a one-take context everything just seems that much more propulsive and urgent. Throughout this album, these two men and two women sound absolutely joyful, like the music's a curative. There's great boy/girl harmonizing on ""Please Please Man"" and ""Going Down"", entire-band harmonizing on ""It Came from Japan"", and a manic handclapping barrage on ""Vacant as a Ghost"". ""My Baby's Cryin'""-- a slight ""It Came from Japan"" B-side sung by guitarist Marci Bolen (ex-Slumber Party)-- is made mightier through its pairing with ""Cryin'"" from Lack of Communication. It shows up twice on this CD, in two slightly different versions-- one live, one pre-recorded; ""It Came from Japan"" is also repeated, the second version a fuzzy Monoshock mess. Aside from the originals, The Von Bondies also dig groove-first into two covers. The eight-minute version of 60s staple ""Take a Heart"" by English garage visionaries The Sorrows is slinky and dirty, and takes enough patient time and care to warrant its ricocheting guitar-piss climax. And the live retooling of the Compulsive Gamblers' ""Rock & Roll Nurse"" is equally well-wrought-- punch-drunk, sex-freak gritty in its instrumental dueling. So why do I give props to The Von Bondies, but not to so many other chumps in the pack? Because instead of rote masturbation to genre tropes, this band blends equal parts Misfits and The Animals into their own distinctive Halloween sound; Jason Stollsteimer (guitar, vocals) writes prime hooks, and the entire band offers boatloads of hardcore flesh-and-blood energy. Save yourself some time and forget the flabby pretenders, already! I'm sure the upcoming Pawn Shoppe Heart will be even stronger (and the new material less familiar), but for now, plop this baby in, howl at the moon, dance 'til you drop, and pass out in your own whiskey vomit.","There's an overabundance of garage rock bands these days-- dozens upon dozens of Estrus-styled fanboys, all imploding digital-age stooges ...

Trinity Neon,Imitation Electric Piano,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1baeb335119a49ed5f1/1:1/w_160/200ce3ae.jpg,2003-06-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4077-trinity-neon/,Drag City,"The eccentric underbelly of British rock following The Beatles reveals an uneasy history that doesn't lend itself well to the tidy lineage of bands leading up to the break of punk. There was already a frighteningly diverse school of simultaneous evolutions happening in the late 60s, from the proto-metal of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, to the early progressive rock of Yes, Genesis and King Crimson, to intricate folk of Pentangle and the Fairport Convention, to the budding indie-pop of David Bowie and Marc Bolan, to experimental, jazz-driven outfits like Canterbury's Soft Machine. At the dawn of the 70s, all these strands of rock and beyond were set adrift to follow their own paths, never to meet again (though musicians would often infiltrate one camp or another, blurring the lines of \x93genre\x94). This period, roughly 1968 to 1971, is almost a forgotten era in British rock-- unless you've closely followed one or more of the above artists, in which case it starts to look like a classic era. Stereolab's Simon Johns and his band Imitation Electric Piano haven't forgotten those years. Working with multi-instrumentalist Lee Adams, drummer Ashley Marlowe, bassist Andrew Blake and a few others, Johns' band follows a similar trajectory as a few bands mentioned above, most notably the wry progressive psyche of early Soft Machine and other like-minded bands such as National Health. The band also shares quite a few similarities with Stereolab, especially in their lapses into motorik and post-rock pulsating drive, and their love of vintage instrumentation (imitation electric piano ain't just a band name). Johns wrote or co-wrote all of the music here, and handles all lead vocals (appearing on about half of the record). His understated baritone is a nice foil for the extended pieces, though, like recent Stereolab, the band has a tendency to veer into the background. Though Johns does sing on several tracks, Trinity Neon seems more like a sequence of (sometimes lengthy) instrumental impressions, encouraging listeners to wander in and out of the music. \x93The Khartoum Venus\x94 begins as a minor-key funk vamp, led by muted trumpet and the kind of spidery organ lick that hasn't been popular since Rod Argent bought his first Hammond. This segues into a deft, hard trance rock that sounds obviously similar to Stereolab. Likewise, \x93Don't Tell Me I'm Wrong (But You Are)\x94 is reminiscent of Cobra and Phases period 'Lab with its lounge-y take on jazz-rock, right down to the busy drumming and harpsichord touches. \x93Chronicle of a Spirit Foretold\x94 steps a bit further out, and though it's hardly avant-garde, does blend its mellotron tones and odd-metered, syncopated rhythms in a way more akin to 70s psyche-prog than 90s post-rock. The liveliest moments on the record occur on \x93Theme for an Imitation Electric Piano\x94, which features Johns \x93rockin' and rollin'\x94 his way through prime pep. The jam-band ending is a bit unexpected-- who knew these guys were such guitar heroes?-- but it's nice to hear them step out of their pristine arrangements every now and then. The opener \x93Gin Lane\x94 begins as a gentle pop lilt, with Johns lamenting that he'll \x93never see you, or hear you again."" The pace picks up, but the song never seems overly fussy-- one of Imitation Electric Piano's strengths is that they're able to make fairly complex things sounds simple. Even the full ensemble counterpoint in the middle seems perfectly natural. If you're one of those not completely perturbed at the last few Stereolab records, there is a good chance you'll find something of interest on Trinity Neon. Proximity aside, the record is a virtual goldmine for laid-back British jazz-rock, though don't go expecting anything terribly \x93out"": it's a uniformly pleasant record, and that's probably the best and worst I can say about it. If Johns' reference to Robert Wyatt in the liner notes causes a spike in \x93Moon In June\x94 downloads, I'd call it a resounding success.","The eccentric underbelly of British rock following The Beatles reveals an uneasy history that doesn't lend itself well to ...

Your Love Means Everything,Faultline,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd675e6ef9596932305f/1:1/w_160/6f63acc1.jpg,2003-06-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3014-your-love-means-everything/,Blanco y Negro,"Anyone who's ever picked up a crayon understands that the process of making art is inherently painful: the spiritual and emotional drain of bleeding words/sounds/pictures can be deeply, intensely debilitating, burning you until you're red and crying, face flat on the floor, writhing and howling and acting like an asshole. Occasionally, the anguish becomes unbearable: ears are cut off, shotguns plug up mouths, liquor cabinets and syringes are sucked dry. Most of the time, though, the album is boxed and distributed, the book slips into editing, the photograph is matted and framed and the artist-- distraught, but alive-- shakes that shit off and brews a pot of coffee. Love hurts, man. Ask David Kosten: one of his lungs exploded while playing clarinet for England's National Youth Orchestra. Whether or not Kosten's chest-pop happened mid-solo, or whether it was during the, er, orchestral off-season is still unclear, but poetry prevails either way. Check the kid who puffs so hard that his body can't keep up with his boundless aesthetic aspirations, the gawky teenager who endures an excruciating, otherworldly burst in the name of Clarinet. Or conjure the aspiring player who is physically stripped of his ability to perform, left silent and unarmed, broke-down and quiet. The artist's internal torment going external: it's horrifyingly apropos. But one-lunged David Kosten is Faultline now, and he has more than enough synthesizers, arrangements, and ideas to compensate for his anatomical lack. Faultine's heady combination of electronic avant-garde classical/dance is, thematically, about complicated as it sounds-- but Kosten's vision translates, aurally, as a series of threadbare, hauntingly programmed compositions, each simplistic and engrossing. Here, Kosten ditches the esoteric vocal samples that peppered his excellent first record Closer Colder (one of which-- a death threat-- was plucked directly from his home answering machine) for shiny, celebrity pipes: Your Love Means Everything is not only an easier listen than Faultine's debut, it's also an impressive, white-walled gallery of some of contemporary music's finest squawkers. Chris Martin, Wayne Coyne (in his first non-Flaming Lips studio appearance), Michael Stipe, and Cannibal Ox all lend their respective yelps, offering not only a mess of superstar names for those unit-shifting cover-stickers, but also some substantial choral chops. Kosten uses his guest vocalists as melodic trumps, building and refining his compositions around their singing: stripped down and fragile, each of the record's six vocal tracks are bare-boned bits, designed to showcase melodies and voices. Chris Martin's vocal prowess has always been Coldplay's supernatural center, and Kosten quickly establishes that grainy, loping coo as a force entirely independent of his band's earnest, sentimental melancholy. Textured, rich, and dripping with sinister, sexy longing, Martin outshines himself on ""Where Is My Boy?"", infusing each word and breath with desperate immediacy, flitting effortlessly from whisper to howl, begging and demanding, advancing and receding, his voice always fat with a throbbing, unnamed ache. Coldplay's melodic rock stew has never really provided the kind of sparse, shadowy stage that Kosten builds here, and, subsequently, Martin's nuanced murmur-gone-falsetto has never quite gotten the spotlight it deserves: set against a backdrop of tinny drums, the odd acoustic strum, lots of rumbling synths, and some achingly slow backbeats, ""Where Is My Boy?"" features the kind of subtly alarming vocal performance (Martin backs himself-- a wild, schizophrenic chorus of spinning Chris) that can fill in your cracks, wear you out, and leave you panting and oddly violated. It's easily one of the finest vocal tracks we'll hear this year. ""The Colossal Gray Sunshine"" sees Wayne Coyne's distinctive whine a bit heartbroken, humming its sad melody over pitchy piano and brittle synths; ""Greenfields"" a guitar-led twenty-fifth century folksong, has Michael Stipe sounding like anyone but-- voice tiny and unexpectedly resonant, Stipe's normally-nasal R.E.M. twangs are wholly absent here. Cannibal Ox's aggressive flow on ""Waiting for the Green Light"" is, admittedly, a little jarring, although the problem has a lot more to do with the track's placement than any missteps on his behalf. The revolving-singer lineup constantly eats away at the coherency of this record, and Your Love Means Everything occasionally feels more like a creepy mix tape/cabaret than a unified album borne from a single artist . The major catch is that Kosten ends up relying so heavily on his collaborators, whose human frailty so gorgeously offsets the electronics, that the instrumental tracks seem comparably vacant-- although they've clearly been beefed up to compensate. ""Lost Broadcast"" has some excellent distorted squeals and whippy drums, and ""Clocks"" is a tick-tocking haze of crackles and swells. but it's inevitable that such overproduced offerings fall a little bit flat. Laptop-clicking and keyboard-manning may have slightly lower maiming potentials than huffing your heart out into a horn, but Kosten still turns himself inside out for his music, whatever fine furnishings make it seem at times a sterile environment. On Your Love Means Everything, the blood is everywhere.","Anyone who's ever picked up a crayon understands that the process of making art is inherently painful: the spiritual ...

Elsewhere, labels such as Ata Tak and Beta-Lactam Ring prove that no matter how far out you get, there's always room to stretch. So, let's be serious: Avant-garde rock is not tucked away in the corner of Chicago art schools, nor is it merely the refuge of nocturnal drug experimentalists with a penchant for art-damage and enough eBay money to pay for their Pro-Tools. It has, in fact, long since crept into seemingly normal neighborhoods. The duo Samus, for example, are from Eastern, Pennsylvania. Jeff Gallagher and John Busher aim to please, or scare, or possibly just tickle each other with their debut, Desengano. With minimal assistance, in the span of just over 70 minutes, they manage to deconstruct as much of the workaday sludge metal and tape-splicing gumbo as you'd expect for any band of self-dubbed ""oddballs."" And with that description, they tread the well-worn path of understatement and anonymity so revered by Resident-ial family of noisemakers. I'm no traditionalist, but I can admire the strength of musical lineage, especially when it's so ostensibly undernourished. It's too bad Samus sound so much like Disco Volante-era Bungle. Of course, there's no crime in sounding similar to other bands, but as all of the bands I referenced above can take considerable pride in sounding almost nothing like each other, Samus', well... sameness does strip Desengano of some much-needed edge. ""DJ Delta Burke"" goes through quite a backlog of late-night cable television blaxploitation movies and educational program sound-bites as narrative for its Casio-powered rhythm box beats and boogie-woogie piano samples. It's interesting when the textures change in rapid succession, but over the course of ten minutes, the gag wears thin. Similarly, ""The Happy Sultan"" wears its Melvins metal-dirge and Patton-ted screaming maniac vocals badges slightly too frequently to qualify as tribute. I'll add that the production is great, in a lo-fi, stoned-out kind of way. Predictably, the best moments happen when Samus ventures away from realms already extensively mined by their elders, as on the outstanding version of Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"" (here titled ""Super-Orthepedic [sic] Caravan""). They use a 50s Hollywood orchestra sample saturated with disembodied soprano goodness as the intro to a cheap synth-and-cocktail lounge groove fit for the finest kings of space-age poppy-delia. Furthermore, they pull out the psycho-sludge riffs at the end, and rather than numb my brain into submission, actually inject a little muscle into the mix. Nice stuff, and what's more, they accomplish it in less than half the time of most of the other tunes on the disc. I wouldn't say brevity is a prerequisite for serving up a particularly potent slice of abnormality, but in Samus' case, distilling the experience helps them to break free from the pack.","Good old Residents, what with their big eyeball heads and anonymity disturbing the peace of minds everywhere.

"In Fine Style: Original Rockers 7"" and 12"" Selection 1973-1979",Augustus Pablo,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb39eb335119a49ec9b2/1:1/w_160/3a091978.gif,2003-06-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6124-in-fine-style-original-rockers-7-and-12-selection-1973-1979/,Pressure Sounds,"Of all the people in the world that would intentionally choose a vacation to Jamaica, I never imagined that Mom and Bruce would. But they did go-- not to Trenchtown, to one of those nice resorts near the Jamaican golf course. Did they have a good time? ""Everyone expects a handout down there, they all want money,"" they laughed. ""'Aye mon,' all holding out their hands, 'Jammin,' mon.'"" Since a request for killer collie from these cultural ambassadors was out of the question, I asked them to bring me back a melodica. I packed her a picture of Augustus Pablo for reference and tried to explain how, using a plastic child's toy, he had produced some of the most beatific breaths ever imbibed by the ears, leading folks as disparate as Tortoise, Damon Albarn, and Pole to send their mums out for one as well. Initial concerns about the interchangeability between tracks faded away as I let this latest culling of rare sides spin, endlessly. Instead I was struck by the truth of possibilities that come to the fore. Put together by the British reggae reissue label Pressure Sounds (also responsible for last year's equally exquisite Pablo set, El Rockers), these side by side tracks showcase the playing of Pablo and a pool of folks like the Barrett Brothers, ""Chinna"" Smith, and Robbie Shakespeare, laying out in consecutive versions a phenomenon that even Shrödinger could get with: each version of a riddim splits into different realities, elucidated on apiece by the players in their dubs. It opens up with five different versions of ""Far East"", done under such interchangeable names as Pablo All Stars and Rockers All Stars. The first one focuses on the melodica, allowing it to move through the brass section laconically. In ""Phillip's Showcase"", the brass head gets dropped soon after the opening, and the pumping organs of bass and drum are revealed in all their pulsing glory; returning later as ""East Man Sound"", there are extra percussive shakes and a quivering keyboard that warps the melody beautifully, leading into even more-- you guessed it-- melodica. The fourth version drops in more hi-hat and cavernous rattles, before cutting into a more Hi-Fi take midway through, weaving another Pablo solo into the expanding guitar and organ. Then there's the stretch of Jah Levi's ""False Rumour"", ""Zambian Style"" by Rockers All-Stars, and the ""Rockers Rock (Version)"" by Jah Iny near the end of the disc. The DJ on the first cut is heavily Rastafarian in theme, but his voice gets reverberated on the follow-up, the rhythm permeating the mix, making everything shake with low frequencies. Everything is tweaked beyond recognition on the last version, as Pablo switches up the bass line, stretches the organ like salty taffy, and has the tape-rewind run through an ever-shifting echo that destabilizes their dub into a new element. It's the most overtly weird slice here, the concentration being more on Pablo's touch behind the boards as well as in front of the microphone. But to only view the surface of Pablo's music is to miss out on the fact that beneath the seeming simplicity of three minute instrumentals lies a complex set of relationships, between the drum and bass, the stabs of organ and yardbird guitar, the temporal space between each hit, and how his serpentine lines on melodica and/or organ slide about on waves of probability, leaving ripples in the ether. For its limited scope, this is not a bad souvenir of the man.","Of all the people in the world that would intentionally choose a vacation to Jamaica, I never imagined that Mom ...

Sigur 1/Sigur 9 EP,Sigur Rós,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f79d034d5c69bf2f57/1:1/w_160/f75ddd1e.gif,2003-06-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11826-sigur-1sigur-9-ep/,MCA,"They should stock this as an impulse buy at record store checkout counters to catch the customers picking up Radiohead's new album. Contrary to the belief that singles have gone digital-- that nobody would pay almost ten bucks for one new song when they could just steal it, or grab it for 99¢ through iTunes' ""Save Apple Computers: Again"" fund, Sigur Rós has released two versions of the first single from ( ). Last month we got a three-inch CD for ""Untitled #1"", packaged in white like a box of Chiclets; now there's a follow-up that pairs the same music with a bonus DVD. Compared to their breakthrough second album, \xC1gætis Byrjun, last year's ( ) was beautiful but unsurprising, parts of it even turgid. Toning down \xC1gætis Byrjun's near-excesses and orchestral embellishments, its grey palette and heavy mood were as exciting as watching ice not melt: it was solid, but unpersuasive. And so the single featured here, ""Untitled #1"" (aka ""Vaka""), has to disappoint a little. True, it's exquisite, and the melody's flawless, borne on a thick but tingling organ with Jón \xFEor Birgisson's near-whistling vocals augmented by a stately piano on one side and wisps of synth on the other. Most bands can only sound this graceful by whispering, or feigning delicacy; Sigur Rós muster the effect with an iron fist, every detail aggressively beautiful. But to hold it up again to a near-impossible standard, the song lacks the freshness and expanse of their breakthrough single, ""Svefn-G-Englar"". Gone are the woofer-trembling echoes of glaciers shifting, forgotten is that impulse to pull over the car, roll down the windows and cry. The song sounds internal and contained, somber and complete; it's incredibly pretty, but is that all there is? ""Untitled #9"", on the other hand, makes a pretty tight B-side. It reportedly started as a remix of ""Vaka"", before the band stretched and reworked it beyond recognition. In its the first section, the trumpet, vocals and synths loop around and speed to a high pitch. These elements lilt and revolve until a final high-pitched natter kicks off a quieter section, which drifts down to a single slow, moaning tone, joined gradually by a higher one-- like whale pillow talk. Although cut across three tracks on the disc, ""Untitled #9"" has to be judged as a whole, with the more insubstantial second and third tracks making a tail-wagging-the-dog fade-out from the first. If it weren't twelve minutes long, you'd call it a miniature; it's as charmingly mechanical as a music box that quietly breaks as it plays. Anyone who bought last month's version of this single went home with just the music disc; to make those people feel like suckers, MCA released the expanded edition this week for about the same price-- it comes with a DVD. Off the bat, I was disappointed in the no-frills presentation of this disc, which scores a fat 0.0 for extras. You don't get the ""Making Of"" mini-documentary for ""Svefn-G-Englar"". You can't switch on subtitles in Hopelandish, Icelandic or Hidden Peoplespeak. There's no wacky backstage footage of Birgisson practicing e-bow on the can in his boxers. You just get the three videos. It should go without saying that all three run in slow motion, and that the imagery's muted and beautiful. As for the content, the messages are, well, blunt. ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"" opens with a shot of a young boy playing with two beat-to-shit dolls, and he's later assaulted by a homophobic welder and a Bible-hefting priest. ""Svefn-G-Englar"" features Iceland's Perlan Theater Group, a group of actors with Downs Syndrome, dressed as angels. But neither of them conks you harder than Italo-Canadian filmmaker Floria Sigismondi's ""Untitled #1"", which sends a bunch of kids out for recess in a post-nuclear wasteland of black snow, red sky and poisoned air. A pack of them smash the hell out of a car while wearing old-fashioned gasmasks, evoking the kind of apocalyptic imagery that doesn't even bother to look futuristic and cool. ""Untitled #1"" is too Terry Gilliam-lite for my tastes, but the two others-- co-directed by Sigur Rós themselves-- have grown on me. They're enjoyable half for their regional charm, and half because they match the band's slow romanticism and implicit political edge. Both were shot against the now-iconic landscape of Iceland, green fields under overcast skies with craggy rock in the background; and from the choreography and costumes of the Perlan Theater Group, to the great plot twist in ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"", the videos are as subtle and engaging as the songs. And they both end with killer kisses. For this band, what could be more appropriate?",,7.1,
They Ate Themselves,The Robot Ate Me,by: Nicholas B. Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a289ea9e61561daa4a81/1:1/w_160/330fbf4f.jpg,2003-06-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6804-they-ate-themselves/,Swim Slowly,"Within a very particular circle of the Internet, advertisements for The Robot Ate Me have been popping up maybe as frequently as the ones for the X2 spycam or Highschoolgraduates.com. The album came out in December 2002, and the label that released it, San Diego's quasi-experimental Swim Slowly, has presumably spent thousands of their own dollars pushing the band as hard as humanly possible. And just like I bought that spycam and caught my wife cheating with some dudes from the office, my decision to drop cash on They Ate Themselves has been one with some pleasant surprises. The Robot Ate Me, according to the band's label, is ""a band out of San Diego, CA that writes happy and sad songs with wit and ease. They use guitars, old synths, accordions, horns, toys, power tools, organs, and pretty much anything that makes a sound."" Unfortunately, when those toys, accordions, and old synths take over like an X-rated Toy Story 2, The Robot Ate Me is an utter disaster. Yet somehow, this very same lo-fi collective, when at its least pretentious and power tool-ish, becomes starkly compelling, and their album becomes indescribably moving. Drums and synth wisps of an abbreviated Mount Eerie sort open ""Our Bones Were Chalk"", halted abruptly by the simple, honest croon of vocalist/guitarist Ryland Bouchard. Bouchard remains accompanied only by guitar for a short time, until the rest of the band enters forcefully, disrupting the song's former solo guitar delicacy, all while Bouchard maintains his own gentle and wavering say-sing. The accompaniment slowly and artfully diminishes as the song reaches its end. ""Our Bones Were Chalk"" in many ways typifies many of the album's tracks: a textbook (if not somewhat cliched) lo-fi introduction is followed by a series of abrupt changes in rhythm, volume and texture consistently contraposed against Bouchard's vocals and necro-centric, yet impenetrable lyrics, and finishes with a fade-out instead of a clear-cut ending. The album's title track follows this pattern, but bears the distinction of being far more expertly executed, drawing comparisons to The Walkmen. ""What We Thought Was Fog""'s gripping tale of, from what I can gather, a fatal car accident, is perhaps even more indicative of The Robot Ate Me; all actions are intended to exact a grave and emotive response from the listener. When The Robot Ate Me avoids its ""this is how good and interesting lo-fi music sounds"" trope-y schtick, the album offers its finest moments. ""A Harp (...And How You Cut My Strings)"" is simply beautiful. Its lyrics are touching yet smart and refreshingly ironic, and Bouchard's vocals melt seamlessly amidst a lush string line. ""Everyone Was Still"", for all its semi-irritating apocalyptic lyricism, has one of the most memorable hooks on the album (""I searched through bodies, but only found change""). But even in moments like this, it's difficult not to be somewhat distracted by the lingering air of cold calculation and despicable pretension. One imagines The Robot Ate Me deciding over tea that elements X, Y, and Z comprise ""good"" and ""interesting"" music, and choosing, like musical sophists, to write a song that exists solely to execute these cleveries. The second track, ""Tied to the Car"", has all the gimmicky and soulless trademarks of The Robot Ate Me's songwriting formula gone awry. Perhaps most egregious is the song's performative lyrics: immediately after Bouchard sings, ""I waited for a knife to cut loose,"" the song changes rhythm and intensity as if to act out musically how Bouchard would ""cut loose."" Performative lyrics can be an immediate indicator of how much thought has gone into a musical composition (i.e. lots), but when done poorly, as unfortunately often happens on They Ate Themselves, the affectation irritates. The same goes for the lame onomatopoeia of ""In the Fire"" (""crackle crackle crackle""), and the spacey and unnecessary electronics of the sadly Dashboard-like ""After the War""-- easily the most offensive song here. When all is said and done, They Ate Themselves is frustrating. Its best songs are truly wonderful-- those rare instances of musical beauty that have the ability to transcend the underground-popular divide while maintaining some semblance of ""cred."" Its worst songs, however, seem to embody everything truly disgraceful in indie pop. It's a give and take: waiting out the worst of it yields fantastic rewards, but whether that's worth $10 is up to you.","Within a very particular circle of the Internet, advertisements for The Robot Ate Me have been popping up maybe as ...

Opera,Tape,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a732b1335d7bf1698fd1/1:1/w_160/c3f12b4a.jpg,2003-06-09 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7937-opera/,Häpna,"In honor of Henry Miller and his devout love of watercolors, I've decided to augment my music-writing artistry by taking up soft-lead pencils and doing artistic renderings of all my favorite albums. I started off with some white sleeve promos and gradually worked my way through The Beatles and TNT. I'm cramping a little bit on Rudimentary Peni's Death Church and Terry Riley's Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band All Night Flight, but the icepacks are doing wonders. At the last International Starving Artist's Swap Meet at Joe Freeman Coliseum, I started trading with the Berthling brothers, Johan and Andreas, and their Swedish buddy, Tomas Hallonsten. The three called themselves Tape and wrote out the title of their latest creation as Opera, the graphite tactile on an exquisitely textured paper. They do a mighty nice rendition of the pastoral plucking and counter-current circuitry of Faust's IV, I must say, in addition to the charcoal cubism of Gastr del Sol's Camofleur, done without any sort of preciousness that can hang over such electronic and acoustic rubbings. ""Bell Mountain"" opens with chiming guitar strings and a processed gurgle echoing from deep inside the wood, an elegant contrast between the two aforementioned albums. ""Return to Ship"" traces the beautiful figures of Five Leaves Left, with warm feedback drifting through those Drake-draped branches like an arctic sun. When the harmonica comes in, the weird objects drawn on the front cover-- including curiously curled leaves, stones, and plant life-- recall the world tree on Talk Talk's Laughing Stock in their more amorphous states of sound, before the voice of Mark Hollis would enter. ""Longitude"" drifts in and out of percolating rainfall, breathing harmonium breezes, and metallophones, perfectly matching yet another gray, washed-out, still-not-summer weekend outside. What's perhaps their most awe-inspiring cover adaptation is that they capture the family vacation photo processing of Fennesz's Endless Summer. With an instrumental list that includes guitar, harmonium, laptop, field recordings, zither, piano, flute, glockenspiel, accordion, trumpet, and styrofoam, to name but a few, they move between the two extremes of unadulterated sound and sound processing. Tracks like ""Feeler"" and ""Radiolaria"" will be familiar to anyone already enamored with ""Caecilia"" or ""Shisheido"". While the guitar ambles along, moving in a drawn-out fashion that can be a little bit too extended, little sound events puff and gust around it, sometimes sympathetic and subdued, other times randomly contrasting with the melodic figures and standing out, the colors of all the various instruments vibrant even when mixed together. Culling such deeply nuanced and singular sounds as the quoted covers above, Tape, while evoking brief instances of recollected sounds, manage to carve out a distinct, albeit more mild space of their own, drawing forth the most distinct elements and reworking it as their specific, spacious sound.","In honor of Henry Miller and his devout love of watercolors, I've decided to augment my music-writing artistry by ...

Slow Charm,The Figgs,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd93ea9e61561daa7726/1:1/w_160/686d2654.jpg,2003-06-09 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3052-slow-charm/,Hearbox,"It's always sad to see a formerly lively band grow labored and predictable in their old age. It's also always sad to see a critic drone on and on about his youthful experiences in order to set up an emotional context for his admonishments. This review will contain plenty of both, so be forewarned. The Figgs hold a special place in my heart, simply through the serendipity of being the opening act at my first concert. Okay, not my very first concert (that'd be Kenny Loggins with the 'rents)... alright, not even the first concert chosen under my own volition (that'd be Aerosmith and Megadeth, also with the fam in tow)... okay, not my first concert without parental supervision either (that'd be Soundgarden and Tad). But let's call it the first show that had any sort of bearing on my subsequent listening habits: The Poster Children and The Figgs at Chicago's fine Cabaret Metro. With the naïve exuberance of a high school freshman not yet allergic to the limited returns of opening acts, The Figgs were pure joy: they were loud! Fast! Jumped around! Had songs about ice cream! Maniacally unencumbered by familial chaperones, I celebrated like a mid-90s teenager should: crowd-surfing! Moshing! After the show, I eagerly scooped up a copy of the band's Lo-Fi at Society High, and went on to treasure it like any kid who thinks he's found a band only he knows about. Holy name of Jesus! It's been ten years since those innocent days, and look at how things have changed. A decade later, I'm a little more informed and a lot more cynical, and while Lo-Fi (and its not-bad successor Banda Macho) still sounds good, I can recognize that the songs within were little more than sped-up Elvis Costello ripoffs. A decade later, The Figgs are probably a little more cynical, too, having been victimized by a number of label restructurings (including Capitol Records'), endured the loss of a member, and now, ended up on tiny Boston-based Hearbox Records. Or at least it would seem that way, as Slow Charm opens with Pete Donnelly declaring, ""I'll never go back to being that way."" Yet, it seems like the changes they've made since I last encountered them have all been of subtraction, as The Figgs incarnation here sounds rather caffeine-free compared to the sugar-high act of old. Minus the fast tempos and punchy rhythms, Donnelly's voice is left astonishingly bland on his share of the songs-- ""Static"" and ""The Trench"" are unpleasantly MOR-friendly. Doubles partner Mike Gent fares better, his peculiar, acrid voice still intact, but with more mature subject matter replacing the lovelornaments of the past, it's put to waste on spineless material like ""Protocol"". Of course, I don't expect The Figgs to still be throwing down spittle-spraying material like ""Favorite Shirt"" as they ease over the hill, but what passes for growth here is less than promising. ""Metal Detector"" is proud of its theremin overdubs but ultimately limp, while the two-chord ""Soon"" cuts a weak swagger, its bargain wah-pedal and senseless organ noodling making it sound something my jamband-polluted high school would've regurgitated. The majority of Slow Charm displays pop that has traded in the ""power-"" prefix of old for a more mature ""-rock"" suffix, leaving the sterile end product sounding less like The Buzzcocks and more like Bryan Adams. And while the band still offers up a couple catchy keyhole glimpses of their earlier spirit (""Sit and Shake"", ""Public Transportation""), The Figgs sound like Band #35,873 that's existed long past their expiration date. 'Tis a harsh sentence to pass on the band who taught me how to mosh, but unfortunately for The Figgs, we're all a bit older and less excitable these days.","It's always sad to see a formerly lively band grow labored and predictable in their old age.

The Black Babies EP,Devendra Banhart,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20b5e6ef95969320318/1:1/w_160/e70e3f43.jpg,2003-06-09 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/547-the-black-babies-ep/,Young God,"It's the middle of the night. You're sound asleep. Suddenly, the phone rings and all the sweet, sweet serotonin gets sucked straight from your brain in a mere instant. So now you're awake, but you're too tired to get up and answer the phone. The machine picks up, and someone on the other end starts plucking a guitar and singing in a vaguely creepy, almost gender neutral tenor. It's bone-chilling in the darkness. When it's over you struggle back into fitful, paranoid sleep, and in the morning when you wake up, the message is there. After several listens, you still don't know who it is, but the song is starting to make sense. It's actually pretty good. Devendra Banhart's music ingratiates itself to you like this. His simple songs-- typically two, maybe three chords, one acoustic guitar, and his shaky, freakish vocals layered on top-- have an archaic, almost primitive feel to them that's utterly otherwordly, and yet strangely, deeply American. Harry Smith would have heard treasure here, and Banhart's output shares a lot of ground with the Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk Music's creakiest selections. Plus, it sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine, engulfed in hiss and night sounds. That's somewhat by design, of course, at least as far as the actual releases of this mini-album (eight songs in 23 minutes) and his first full-length (2002's Oh Me Oh My) are concerned. Young God Records honcho and erstwhile Swan/meanwhile Angel of Light Michael Gira first heard Banhart via a rough demo that came in the mail and couldn't bring himself to have the kid come into the studio to polish the songs up. He felt that they sounded pretty well perfect as they were, and he was right-- it's hard to imagine these songs presented with any amount of gloss. The story goes that young Devendra was always recording these songs for himself on cheap recording devices and had to be convinced by friends and family to send them around to labels. The result is an uncanny honesty and open imperfection to the songs that would be impossible to capture in a studio. ""Cosmos and Delos"" is ink black and spare, with skeletal guitar figures and what sounds like a distant gunshot and street noise in the background. Banhart sings with himself in extremely close harmony, creating melody out of a near-drone. Banhart proves himself an able guitarist on ""Lagoon"", filling in the melodic gaps with gorgeous, cascading lines. The lyrics are almost inscrutably obtuse, with strange non-sequiturs like ""Never been to Minnesota/ Still I'd love to live in Maine/ Never been to Salamanca/ Still I'd love to live in Spain"". ""The Charles C. Leary"" is my favorite lyrically, detailing a series of surreal, dreamlike vignettes of a possible shipwreck. ""I lost the gloves my mother gave me/ While on the way to the make believe sea,"" he intones over a bobbing guitar part-- the song throbs and sways with seasickness, speeding up and slowing down as befits the urgency of each respective verse. Though it can be thoroughly engrossing, it bears noting that Banhart's music is decidedly not for everyone. If the sounds of the backwoods-- real or imagined-- appeal to you, Banhart will give you chills in the best way possible; if you're more into polish and can't stomach the deeply surreal, caution is definitely in your best interest. Still, Banhart is a singular talent, and if he hits you right, you'll be only too happy to be held in his thrall.","It's the middle of the night. You're sound asleep.

Triste,Oren Ambarchi,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07313d19756521383b2/1:1/w_160/e0ea7221.jpg,2003-06-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/151-triste/,Idea,"I'm a relative newcomer to Australian guitarist Oren Ambarchi, but after hearing two solo albums and one collaboration, it seems clear that he doesn't like to repeat himself. He moves easily between moods and textures, from spacious ambient plucking to abrasive drones, and at this premature stage in my exploration of his discography, his truly experimental style is still difficult to pin down. This gorgeously packaged album contains a full live set, 40 minutes or so, recorded in Holland in 2001, along with a seven-inch EP containing two ""remakes"" by Tom Recchion. Sounds are by Ambarchi alone, using his guitar augmented by some basic processing and electronics. The show was presumably in a gallery or theater, because the vast pockets of space that Ambarchi leaves between the notes (especially on the first side) are filled by silence alone. No background noise is detected. The calm is important, as Ambarchi's preferred technique on the A-side is to move between a small handful of tones, where he plucks a single guitar string and lets the sound slowly decay alongside prickly electric scrapes and pops. He alternates between a half-dozen or so notes, with silence predominating in the early going and sounds congregating into progressively dense clusters as time passes. Because of the seemingly random movement between the small set of pitches, the first side is oddly reminiscent of wind chimes, sounding like a peculiar amplified version of a hanging clutch of tubular bells. There's a sensation that something other than two hands is causing the notes to sound, some silent and unknowable force setting things in motion and then moving in and around the vibrations. Because the music is still surprising and unpredictable after ten spins, Triste makes for excellent repeated listening. Both the sound and approach changes on the second side. It definitely starts where the piece left off, but the tempo is accelerated and more urgent, and sub-bass drones intrude and then take over almost immediately. The crackling taps that accompanied the drawn-out notes remains, but slowly shifting layers of sound and feedback are the focus. The rumbling bottom end combined with nasally, flanged harmonics bring to mind a chorus of didgeridoos, and then the midrange swells imparts the sonority of dueling sine waves. In the piece's final half, wild electronic tones untraceable to a guitar bang in and out, buzzing around the space like large sheet metal insects. Where the first side left ample space for contemplation, allowing the listener to make a minute dissection of each sound, the harshly textured blasts come and go far more quickly by the end of the show than they can be processed. Triste goes from Thursday Afternoon-style ambience to Mego-ish noise, and then, for a minute or two at the very end, back again. It's a mesmerizing ride. The remakes by Recchion are excellent. Ambarchi's bell-like tones are prominent, but rather than focusing on a particular aspect of the original piece, Recchion uses the material to construct something new. Playing against the seeming randomness of Ambarchi's pieces, Recchion adds anchoring drones and sequences, thereby softening the material and making it more conventionally musical. Recchion's treatments are deeply affecting, occasionally even bordering on the sentimental, which is amazing considering the coolly removed nature of the source. All in all, Triste is a deeply satisfying exploration of abstract sound.","I'm a relative newcomer to Australian guitarist Oren Ambarchi, but after hearing two solo albums and one collaboration, it ...

This is the main thing I remember about their record-- that it contained one of the better uses of parenthesis I've come across in a guitar-pop song. ""Give me one more chance (and you'll fuck up),"" all matter-of-fact, like neither of them even felt like going through the motions. There are a couple of Kiss-Offs in Black Lipstick, including drawly guy-singer Philip Niemeyer, and like you'd guess from the name, they're still kicking around the same pleather pants and beery make-out vibes as before. They can still nail down the parentheses, too. On ""Serpentz"", one of a few highlights here, some straggling backup vocals turn an oily compliment into a warning, because these guys are out to steal your girlfriend: ""No lady so lovely should be left alone. (With me.)"" They're clever like that. But the girlfriend's probably safe: these folks might get into beer, or trucks, but you just know they're cute little indie kids. One of them is a lawyer; it's not hard to imagine the others being grad students. Which works out perfectly for them, cause it's surprising how good they sound. They live in this down-to-basics neighborhood that's a certain type of indie rock band's Home Base, which is to say that they sound like a lot of bands who sound like The Velvet Underground: the drums tick and shamble, the guitars scrape and jangle, and the singers drawl off-key about being broke, getting fucked up, and breaking up with people. (Just when I'd forgotten why it used to be cool for indie bands to sound like they were doing everything half-assed!) Add in these guys' penchant for cute glammy details and the low-rent Texan good-time vibe gets pretty infectious: the idea of Black Lipstick playing anywhere but basements, barbecues, and dive bars seems sad and wrong. So they fret about being 27 and still getting excited about thrift-store finds; they get around on the city bus; they dream about getting back at bill collectors and luring old friends away from corporate day-jobs. They almost-- almost-- manage to make me miss being broke, wearing dirty shorts, and forgetting what day it is. It's about the voices more than the music, really. Niemeyer's got a lazy sing-speak that makes Lou Reed sound like the one with the affectations; he drawls so sly and husky that you can almost miss his one-liners. (What's remarkable is that he's still more expressive than the average yelper: at his best he beats even the knowing sing-song of Luna's Dean Wareham.) Guitar player Travis Higdon-- who lays sloppy hooks over Niemeyer's rhythm-- takes the lead for a few tracks, covering the other indie-vocal mainstay: he's the sweetly warbly one. Drummer Elizabeth Nottingham, meanwhile, is the secret, tossing out the occasional deadpan lazy backup or just talking back and forth with Niemeyer: ""So, papi... you like it when I shake it?"" That's how they shamble through. Sometimes it's that lazy jangle, like on ""Voodoo Economics"". Sometimes Higdon breaks through for a snappy pop run, like on the perfect chorus of ""Serpentz"" or on ""Corporate Happy Hour"". Sometimes they sag down for the lazy head-nodders: ""Dirges are Downers"" and ""Hot Sinners"" seem like mumbling from under the covers, and it's at moments like these where the band seems most in danger of losing the plot. But they just as often hit it spot-on. ""Ease Back"" makes good on a few minutes of ultra-slack cruising when it, like, eases back, into some big guitar sweeps and Niemeyer's good-life fantasy: ""We're spending cash at malls/ And making booty calls."" Not to mention the nine-minute ""Texas Women"", which stops midway through for a long guitar break that explains how these guys bought some Sonic Youth records and liked a lot of the pretty parts. The music is... well, don't expect to hear anything you haven't heard before, and don't expect to hear anything you've heard before done particularly better than the last time. Black Lipstick work mainly because of charm. This is the thing about the slacker-band Home Base: there are two reasons you might be spending time there. The best Home Base bands sound like they're rediscovering it-- jogging happily back to the plate after hitting a home run, giving the thumbs-up to a crowd that's getting what it knows it wants. The worst Home Base bands sound like they're just stuck there, striking out. So this completely ruins the analogy, but Black Lipstick have sort of hit a triple: like their dreamier labelmates Palaxy Tracks, they've latched onto all of the loveable, slopped-up band-in-a-room realism of college bands around the turn of the 90s. That's not always enough, though, and Converted Thieves really does just sound like a half-assed record unless you feel like letting the details grow on you. And yeah, let's be clear: there's no excuse for another rock band that sounds this much like The Velvet Underground. But then again, it's supposedly summer, and if I could have any band over to play a house party...","A few years ago, maybe: this Austin band called The Kiss-Offs put together a couple lines that made me want ...

Pretest,Dysrhythmia,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3bea9e61561daa71bd/1:1/w_160/e7a13d50.jpg,2003-06-08 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2503-pretest/,Relapse,"As I stood tightly squeezed between the club's plywood bar and some bouncers, the maelstrom unfolded before me, nearly becoming quaint. It was my first and last heavy metal concert, a Relapse Records showcase on the outskirts of Brooklyn. I don't remember what I'd expected my curiosity to yield that evening, but mere seconds after the house lights dimmed, amidst a pit of writhing bodies dancing violently to Cephalic Carnage's blistering rendition of ""Jesus Saves""-- a setting in which leather is preferred to denim, and quiet introspection will get your teeth kicked in-- I was privy to a blaring personal revelation: I did not belong there. Being acclimated to a more passive absorption of the music that was now being presented on stage in deafening megadecibels, I was ill-prepared for the engaging and brutal nature of metal-- this unreadiness stemming not only from my being a coward (which I am), but also from my unfamiliarity with a parallel, yet decidedly foreign, subculture. Philadelphia's Dysrhythmia is a band unplagued by any similar fear of genre-crossing, as they seek to prove that the door is capable of swinging at least one way with their recent album, Pretest. Outfitting elements of Relapse's signature metal and grind-core sound with post-rock's jazz-influenced complexity, Dysrhythmia have created a collection of instrumental tracks with contemporaneous comparisons drawn to Don Caballero, early Mogwai, and The Fucking Champs. Overseen by Steve Albini, who has previously engineered projects by both Don Cab and Mogwai, the group nearly pulls off their fusion, forming a viable indie-by-way-of-metal hybrid that slumps only when it underestimates the range of the former through debased pride in the latter. ""Running Shoe of Justice"" appropriately delivers a racing march upon which a borrowed Explosions in the Sky melody is layered before dissipating into a dissonant wall of feedback. Similarly building off of a strongly percussive skeleton is ""Heat Sink"", a track that delivers on the band's roots with buzzsaw guitars accented by a fuzzy and dominating bass. This heart of metal is deceptive, though, as a distinct pop-tune arises, bouncy in comparison to the dark and rapidly pulsing percussion that nearly buries it. ""Annihilation"", the two-part centerpiece of the album, concurrently represents the musical peak, beginning with a beautiful upper-register guitar line that chills as it echoes against the bass drum that is itself inevitably immersed within the sparse background. As the percussion increases with fits of Robert Wyatt-inspired furor, an approachable rhythm emerges that ultimately cascades into a more reliable beat. Rapid bursts of energy alternately led by guitar and bass punctuate the remainder of the suite, with interjections finally giving way to the peaceful finale of light reverb followed by silence. Merely having the moxie to attempt to build a bridge between the raw aggression of metal and the brooding intricacy of post-rock does not necessitate success, though, as evidenced by the tracks ""Catalog of Personal Faults"", ""And Just Go"", and ""My Relationship"". Treading on shaky ground, the songs all manage to combine either the least interesting elements of both musical approaches or the most clichéd, resulting in frivolous exercises in one style or the other. Proving the unhealthiness of excess, ""Touch Benediction"" sounds like a band falsely assuming an easy acceptance into the folds of instrumental indie rock, pushing a simple motif well past its welcome and ending the album on an extremely weak note. A similar overconfidence could hypothetically compel a hardened New York metalhead to assume dominance in say, a Tortoise concert, or for that matter, Bright Eyes. While the individual probably wouldn't experience any mortal fear, as one might at a Relapse Records showcase, he or she would feel the same level of discomfort and antipathy that the opposite situation prompted in me. There are definitely bands that are capable of moving back and forth between the two poles, but, although Dysrhythmia rise to the challenge for a few wonderful moments, they don't show any real consistency at it here. Instead, they often return to the safe-ground of one of the two genres throughout Pretest, and wind up alienating both of the scenes they were seeking to unite.","As I stood tightly squeezed between the club's plywood bar and some bouncers, the maelstrom unfolded before\n\ me ...

Sumday,Grandaddy,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf8813d197565213b8d7/1:1/w_160/5d64256e.jpg,2003-06-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3544-sumday/,V2,"Consider the defining conflict of our generation: flesh vs. hardware. It's been the central thematic tension of the 21st century thus far, and countless indie bands have exploited (some mercilessly) the discord generated by mixing organic and machine-made elements within their songs, building friction and malcontent through the juxtaposition. For a lot of bands, this means combining acoustic guitars, synthesizers and Brian Deck; for Grandaddy, man vs. machine is separate aesthetic principle entirely-- one that has far less to do with music than with the imminent fate of our universe. On 2000's The Sophtware Slump, Grandaddy were radically pessimistic, a band droopingly resigned to humanity's relative uselessness in the face of gnashing, impeding technology; it was a stance that kicked open the gates for lots of OK Computer-aligning and gobs of millennial anxiety/robot nightmares. The idea of calculated perfection overtaking goofy human error is some awfully scary shit-- mostly because our potential futility is such a perfectly plausible concern. Consequently, The Sophtware Slump was a chillingly foreboding record, both intellectually and aurally frightening: it was peppered with moments of pure sonic brilliance (""He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot"") but ultimately burdened by its own dark, apocryphal apprehensions. Three years later, Sumday glows. While it might feel oddly recognizable to some (please insert requisite Radiohead/Pavement/Sparklehorse reference here), Sumday's dim, protracted familiarity has far more to do with the band's sudden character shift than their occasionally questionable ingenuity. The déjà vu here is internal: Sumday sounds vaguely like Grandaddy. Pastoral, sanguine, and oddly buoyant, the album is far less sinister (and certainly less adventurous) than Grandaddy's former studio experiments, but still comes complete with its own curious set of demands: the first six songs are strikingly (and, presumably, deliberately) similar in timing, tone and strum. Luckily, the band avoids the sameness that often comes with such a consecutive string of spacious midtempo pop songs; instead, the effect is a dreamily cohesive half-hour of music, the perfect extended metaphor, a big warm blanket to curl up in and chew on. Thematically, not too much has changed: Grandaddy seem to be actively pigeonholing themselves as a band preoccupied, at least lyrically, with the encroachment of mean, blank-faced technology. Sumday, fortunately, sees the band employing a more laughably absurdist bent (which, I suppose, could have arisen from the tragic-- or hilarious, or irrelevant-- irony that The Flaming Lips have actually already made a very similar record), tackling our collective defeat with a few more giggles and spits. Futuristic apparatus were once apocalyptic-- now they're borderline silly. Computers and sprinkler systems are boldly personified as nervous and insecure rather than silently destructive. Desktops cry out bleeps of lonely despair when no one's around, robots are left in the dark, and, occasionally, vocalist Jason Lytle decides to embody the mechanized other. In the tellingly titled ""I'm on Standby"", a bot is banished to a shivery tech services lab, where he glumly laments his malfunctions: ""According to the work order you signed/ I'll be down for some time."" Meanwhile, humans are reduced to fumbling idiots when denied the shiny trappings of industrialization. ""The Group Who Couldn't Say"" features a cast of improbable entrepreneurs who, when faced with a day in the countryside, slowly self-destruct (""She kinda lost her shoes/ And lost her mind/ And smashed her phone upon a fallen pine""). Lytle's airy tenor is alarmingly tranquil, and its calmness can be oddly affecting: when he asks, blankly, ""Are you happy with what you're doing?"" in ""The Group Who Couldn't Say"" it's almost impossible not to pause and reboot; simplistic sentiments aside, his always-honest, unwavering voice is resonant enough to inspire some serious self-assessment. When the project finally shifts out of its opening haze (exactly halfway through-- ah, vinyl!), Sumday's soundscape suddenly goes big, fuzzy, and dramatic. Things also get a bit more warm-blooded. ""Yeah Is What We Had"" is Sumday's triumphant (if unexpected) return to heart-pumping, fleshy reality, a distorted, spectral love song fat with shimmer and regret: when Lytle howls, ""In this life/ Will I ever see you again?"" it's unbearably clear that the man's not addressing his iBook. ""OK with My Decay"" nails the most palpable of human sensations-- fear of mortality-- with frank, wistful piano, thick bass, and swelling synths. Here, Lytle goes sad-eyed: ""I'm OK/ With my decay/ I have no choice."" Ignore the obtuse lyrics and realize it's hard to get more lifelike (or more heartbreakingly honest) than freaking out about your foreseeable demise. After enduring years of (yawn) useless Radiohead comparisons, Grandaddy have, ironically, created an album that's fundamentally antithetical to the record their contemporaries are scheduled to release on the same day-- rather than embracing experimentalism and cold calculation as substantive art, Grandaddy have gone soft in a way that's far more satisfying (and, to an extent, more compelling) than their detached past, where the band tended to miss more free throws than Tim Duncan. They've still got their clever title-spellings, and more than one set of lyrics featuring an operating system, but Sumday is all glorious, throbbing heart.","Consider the defining conflict of our generation: flesh vs. hardware.

We Walk the Young Earth,The Blithe Sons,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30ab1335d7bf1698626/1:1/w_160/7d942f1e.gif,2003-06-08 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/801-we-walk-the-young-earth/,Family Vineyard,"When I was a teenager, my friend and I recorded music while standing in a cedar pond, water up to our shoulders, guitars over our heads. And one time we wrapped blankets around our heads, played as loudly as possible on his porch, and commenced battle with the invisible army of neighboring bugs. Our guitars blended into and supplemented their chirps. There was a night we snuck to a barely paved fire road and rubbed carrots back and forth in the dirt; and though I'm vegan, I once mic'd a pork chop and later used the otherworldly scrapes of the meat as a minor-key percussion track. These exercises were each an attempt to locate previously undisclosed sounds, to move beyond standard instrumentation. It was through these sorts of things that I learned how to tilt an acoustic guitar against a hand-held recorder for feedback, and realized that twisting my body a bit to the left made the same strings a muted whisper. On their third album, We Walked the Young Earth, San Francisco-based Jewelled Antler stalwarts Glenn Donaldson and Loren Chasse, obvious disciples of the above tenets, construct an aural topography using complexly geographic-based recording techniques. Recorded last summer in a World War II-era bunker in the Marin Headlands and under a creek bridge in San Gregario, We Walked the Young Earth picks up where 2001's achingly ephemeral Waves of Grass left off. Here, however, the duo forges the din of acoustic guitar, harp, bells, harmonium, toy amplifiers, gongs (submerged in a creek), battery-powered keyboards, vocals, banjo, birds, pipes, bell-blocks, drums, and branches into even quieter spaces of beauty. The best comparisons might be Flying Saucer Attack and Richard Youngs collaborating on an unplugged psych meditation, a tree-bound Calvino-inspired Ghost with even more droning patience, a restive California-style International Harvester, Sun City Girls when they drone the Eastern thing, or a stretched-out This Kind of Punishment minus the rusted baritone. On ""The Book of Names"", Donaldson's wistful vocalizations seem like invocations to various forestland gods. ""The Oldest Living Things"" is built within bubbling water and a cricket solo. Throughout the album, wind chimes are raised to the level of art, distant whispering seems like an animal call, and wind ominously sounds like anything but wind. ""All Children's Faces Looking Upwards"" is guitar-based psych with the rusted crumble of a gong scraping the background. Interestingly, on the album as a whole, percussion seems like a series of tasks and rarely functions as a backbeat. ""Green Patterns"" is more claustrophobic than the others: Notes on a guitar are tapped and chiseled, a load of percussion drips and clatters, and analog feedback hums; a shift brings the percussion more to the fore, and evokes a ghost dragging its chains through the dead leaves of the forest floor. Tones resonate, and are drawn out endlessly. And the final bit, the title track, is reminiscent of ECIM-era Cul-De-Sac: a last-gasp falsetto, strings are plucked, bells are shaken towards a nighttime sky, an underlying sadness remains. I imagine The Blithe Sons leaving their instruments in place for a year and returning each season to see what's written upon them. How would these pieces sound with so much more history and decay, the freeform structures and striations of passing sediment? The sense of place on We Walk the Young Earth is affecting, the care taken in capturing naturally occurring sounds admirable. Some bits aren't as strong as others (the drones do sometimes drone), but the constant reciprocity between the players and their instinctive interaction with the environment is damn-near breathtaking. If you listen carefully enough to these recordings, which were set to the rhythm of a particular environment, their expansive sounds in turn consume the patterns of your space, creating an endlessly dense hymn that leaks and breathes into the city around you.","When I was a teenager, my friend and I recorded music while standing in a cedar pond, water up to ...

White Noise,Alpinestars,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0635e6ef9596931ff2e/1:1/w_160/f77d7dee.jpg,2003-06-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/134-white-noise/,Astralwerks,"I often wonder why more musicians don't publish their lyrics in the liner notes. Usually, the explanations I come up with include higher printing costs and a desire for artistic esotericism. In the case of Alpinestars, I believe the answer to lie in the fact that their lyrics are simply not great-- to the extent that they could, at times, pass for an awkward kind of sci-fi poetry. Witness: ""You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram."" Or Placebo's Brian Molko singing, ""No time or space in the city"" in a forced sneer attempt to drive home the fact that this band is making MUSIC that THINKS about the FUTURE!!!! Alpinestars play modern, trance-y synth-pop with zero edge and melodies with zero hook, which everyone knows are the two key elements synth-pop bands revolve around in the first place. The couple tracks that are sort of decent-- like ""Snow Patrol (Part 1)"", which combines screaming synths with a techno beat, or ""NuSEX City"", whose dorky, NOVA-oh-shit!-check-this-trippy-keyb-line self-wonderment is countered by a fairly tite disco jam-- are sullied with the kinds of vocal effects placed over the nasal yawl of Britney Spears and all her teen pop progenies. Even the ""Bobby Peru's Electrostar Edit"" remix of ""Carbon Kid"", which adeptly plunges itself into snappy, almost experimental, hot electro tweaks, is sullied by the Hi-NRG style splicing of Molko's cheesy vocals over the only good synth melody on the record. Plus effects. But okay, by ""Brotherhood"", which is track 7 out of 12 and shamefully rips its melody of unquestioning happiness from ""Here Comes the Sun"", you'll be longing for the tracks that sound swiped from U2's Zooropa. Elsewhere, inspiration seems desperately plucked from such dicey sources as The Soup Dragons and Give Out But Don't Give Up-era Primal Scream (as on ""Hotel Parallel""), or are stolen outright from, say, New Order's ""Temptation"" (as on ""Burning Up""). Now, normally I wouldn't be so careless about wanton name-dropping and comparison-making, but merely imagining the music that inspired Alpinestars is far more interesting than Alpinestars' actual record. I don't know who listens to this antiseptic electro-pop, or how they can distinguish it from any of the other insipid dance-schlock that DJ Neiman Marcus spins while they compare Kate Spade bags at the upscale boutiques on Madison Avenue, but I know this: IT'S FUCKING HELL. If I want to listen to the Pet Shop Boys I'll put on Magnetic Fields.","I often wonder why more musicians don't publish their lyrics in the liner notes. Usually, the explanations I come ...

Entertainment Is Over If You Want It,The Swords Project,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a617b1335d7bf1698d50/1:1/w_160/93ec1150.jpg,2003-06-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7676-entertainment-is-over-if-you-want-it/,Arena Rock,"It seems pretty obvious that John Lennon's refrain from ""Happy X-Mas (War Is Over)"" has fallen on mostly deaf ears in the decades since its release; in fact, it seems as though war itself has become a form of entertainment, the way it's broken down to a few iconographic videogame images: During the Persian Gulf War we saw buildings ringed by laser site positioners obliterated in seconds, but we never saw the bodies that were torn apart by those same explosions. The war was remote and mechanical, an awesome show of force with little human toll, if you believed your television. War even seems to be regarded by networks these days in the same way that any other form of entertainment is: like any other slice of reality TV programming, a war is a chance to reposition yourself in the ratings. Given the state of television, film and popular culture today, I'd say ""Entertainment Is Over"" is nearly as hopeful a statement as its ancestor. Of course, I don't know if this is what the band thinks, though I suspect some similar sentiment lies at the heart of their decision to name the album that; addressing societal malaise doesn't seem to be at the heart of what the Swords Project are all about. Ultimately, these six Oregonians want you to smash your head on the post-rock and enter their world for about forty minutes, to turn the blinders on. Their self-titled debut EP established them as a sort of gentler, subtler West Coast Mogwai, with a Godspeed-y concept of tension and release in some well-conceived arrangements. While that EP sported some very understated vocals, it didn't suggest singing was a big priority for the band, and given their genre, it was pretty easy to assume it wasn't. Strangely, though, they've opted to play this card more often on their first full-length, though it's virtually never the center of attention. One wonders why the band sends bassist Corey Fickens up to the microphone at all; he has a good voice, but he's rarely intelligible or accomplishing anything that, musically speaking, a viola player couldn't add in his place. The Swords seem desperately to want a human focal point for their sound, but it really isn't necessary. It's not really distracting, either, it's just an odd tactical move. Apart from the vocals, we find the band soaring over much the same ground as before, though they've developed their texture a little more fully this time around. There are no absolute standouts like the stunning bowshot ""Shannon's Wedding Song"" from their EP, but they're wandering less these days, building their songs with more precision. The drums have an open, room mic sound, behaving texturally as much as rhythmically while Rhodes keys and electronics bubble around the edges. The big statements are left mostly to Liza Reitz's violin, and guitarists Ryan Stowe and Jeffrey Gardner, who are deeply, completely in tune with each other. Neither guitar ever moves too far into the other's space, and they frequently play off each other, with one laying down cosmic soundscapes while the other states a theme or cues the rest of the band to action. Closer ""New Shapes"" sounds as though it's drowning, the guitars surfacing through the translucent production for gasps of air, while the drums flail like helpless limbs, kicking up the foam that eventually brings everything back to the surface. Entertainment Is Over If You Want It ends there, scarcely above water, struggling to breathe and regain its bearings. As the electronics sputter to an end, it feels like an appropriate close, and satisfies the notion somewhere inside me that globally, things are spinning out of control, and in the process, downward. Entertainment isn't over-- neither is war-- but you can join in the hopeful refrain that beckons the end.","It seems pretty obvious that John Lennon's refrain from ""Happy X-Mas (War Is Over)"" has fallen on mostly deaf ...

History's First Know-It-All,The Caribbean,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5265e6ef95969320a2e/1:1/w_160/e75126f0.gif,2003-06-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1308-historys-first-know-it-all/,Tomlab,"I have nothing to say about an album that says nothing. Except that it says it all about itself, and is very crafty about saying it well. The Caribbean has always made serious pop without a purpose, built of sequences of unmatched chords, cobbled from lyrical scraps that mean nothing in and of themselves, but when combined mean less. Doing this in a compelling way is no small accomplishment, and it comes off as thrillingly coercive: you're forced to occupy their barren pop architecture, unfinished, unfurnished and uninhabited. You don't understand it, but, though you might not admit it, you do hope it will understand you. Or at least not destroy you. The songs are built with three tools: distance, omission, and interruption. Distance comes in when what you hear is very far from what any one person could have meant to put together. If you think of the original song as a canvas, there's been a fair amount of collaborative shredding, staining, stacking, and abrasion before this thing made it to the gallery wall. Omission comes in with the oblique lyrical style and near-incomplete textures. You feel like there's a real live pop song in there somewhere, but it seems that most of the essential moments have been recorded over with silence or incidental noise. There's obviously still a skeleton to hang a song on, but you start to wonder whether you're the one who was supposed to bring it. Interruption refers to the host of accidental and ambient noises that flick your attention away from the action just as you're starting to follow along. Dishes clinking, microphone sputum, crackling static, antique telephones, or synth grains lure your ear away from the loping meat of the song just as it's sending out spores to slip under your skin. And they get there, without any hint of the irony that usually makes academic pop like this unpalatable. These songs are for real, but they're not about disappointment, or complacency, or shame, or attention, or glee. They're about themselves. Without ironic distance, such oblique experiments can seem exhausting. But only on the giving end: it takes a humble and prolific writer, some cunning musicians, a very patient engineer, and an overarching commitment to self-censorship to pull an album like this off. On the receiving end, however, the pop wreckages of ""History's First Know-It-All"" are quite easy to enter. Most are loaded with all-purpose catharsis, ready to be nodded to on the way to a blind date, or just as things are getting serious, or a few weeks after the break-up. They're taut with a kind of pointless frankness, but the point is just to be taut. And they are.","I have nothing to say about an album that says nothing.

No Podemos Ser Amigos,Aroah,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10613d1975652138520/1:1/w_160/b27f863a.jpg,2003-06-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/294-no-podemos-ser-amigos/,Acuarela,"So, to generalize very broadly, I'm not crazy about these ""singer/songwriter"" types. I mean, Dylan's one thing, and I dig Paul Simon a lot, but none of the more modern crop of earnest songsmith-performers-- all these Mayers and Yorns and Colvins and DiFrancos and their coffeeshop successors waiting in the wings-- aren't clicking with me. Which is why I'm having a tough time understanding why I like Aroah so much. Aroah, for the uninitiated, is the stage name of bilingual Spanish-American singer/songwriter Irene Tremblay. Maybe it's just the fact that she has a stage name that makes her more appealing, I don't know, but the layers of weirdness pile on when it becomes apparent from listening that Tremblay has probably taken in quite a lot of Ani DiFranco records-- though she never aspires to Ani's histrionics, musically or vocally. I really enjoyed Aroah's debut EP, Cuando Termines Con Todo, Habrá Terminado Contigo EP, and I actually think it's about one head and maybe two shoulders above its full-length follow up, No Podemos Ser Amigos (Español for ""We can't be friends""). Part of the reason for the dip in quality is that Tremblay and her collaborators, who consist mostly of members of Spanish post-rock demigods Migala, have backed away somewhat from the deeply atmospheric sound that enveloped the EP, letting more songs dip into acoustic guitar and voice non-arrangements. Mind you, there are still plenty of fantastically rich atmospheres here, they're just not continuous. Tremblay is also a lot more demure and less accusatory that a lot of her peers, preferring to approach the failed romance that is her bread and butter from oblique angles. And when she does rise to point a finger, as on ""The Biggest Idiot in the World"", she always remains equivocal, blaming herself as much for a relationship's little eruptions as much as her unnamed Other, ending on the telling line, ""We are a pair of the biggest idiots in the world."" The biggest shift from her past lyrically is that only three of these songs are in Spanish, which is a much lower proportion than before. On the musical front, the songs that most clearly echo her debut and broadcast the involvement of Migala are the most successful, beginning with opener ""Myriam, la Primera"", which is shrouded in dark, roomy drums and dribbly guitars. There's even an instrumental, appropriately titled ""Canción Sin Palabras"", that allows the album's often moody backing tracks a chance to shine on their own. Everything comes together beautifully on the slinky ""Tell Noah About the Rain"", a spooky slide through a decaying relationship smothered in vibes and subtly noisy guitar. Migala fronthombre Abel Hernandez even offers up some vocals for closer ""Whiskey"", which is always welcome-- the guy's like a cross between Lou Rawls and Stuart Staples and his voice is just awesome here. Unfortunately, amid all the excellent material are a few songs that just don't push as hard sonically, and these are generally the low points of the album. ""Flavor of the Month"" and ""Happiness Avoids Me"" are just too singy-strummy to stand up to their neighbors. And I guess maybe that's what I don't like about so much singer/songwriter stuff-- most of it's just not adventurous enough musically. If your whole pitch to a listener lynchpins on a great melody and some killer lyrics, well, you have to deliver, or the song won't. Thankfully, Aroah largely manages to do just that, despite a couple near misses.","So, to generalize very broadly, I'm not crazy about these ""singer/songwriter"" types. I mean, Dylan's one\n ...

NYC Man: The Collection,Lou Reed,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24013d1975652138817/1:1/w_160/68cc8001.jpg,2003-06-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6734-nyc-man-the-collection/,RCA,"To one man, everything Lou Reed has ever released is absolutely perfect. And if his interviews are any indication, that one man is Reed himself. His vaunted intellectualism has always afforded him a final, unbreachable line of defense when one of his albums is subjected to criticism-- I mean, who are we to detract from Lou Reed's epic vision? We, the insipid, the shortsighted, could never truly grasp the depth of artistry that goes into even the most seemingly hackneyed tracks from Ecstasy (particularly that of ""Like a Possum""), to say nothing of the deep harmonic layering in Metal Machine Music. ""If you had a small mind, you'd miss it."" You said it, Lou. ""I've been rewriting the same song for a long time. Except my bullshit is worth other people's diamonds. And diamonds are a girl's best friend."" See, only Lou Reed can criticize Lou Reed; fortunately, he has only the kindest things to say about himself. He's been maligned for not understanding what he does best, and inadvertently playing directly into his weaknesses as a result, but I'm more inclined to think that he just doesn't care what other people believe his perceived strengths to be. It almost makes me wonder why he bothered at all to hand-select and remaster the 31 tunes included on NYC Man, especially when such effort has been made to include material from even (to my ""small mind"") the worst of his later work. Here, studio versions of numerous mega-classics are replaced with live renditions, often denying listeners even that small pleasure of listening to these tracks with some small degree of studio clarity rather than stripped-down, emotionally dead reprises. About the only unpleasantry he's spared us is sixteen minutes (and one second) of grating feedback-- er, I mean, deeply embedded classical melodies-- to represent Metal Machine Music. Still, like any of the greatest Roman emperors and European monarchs knew, the wrath of the mob is something to be avoided, and so the King of NYC condescends to include basically all the songs that will send still send him to the front of the line when rock's judgment day arrives-- most of which appear as live versions. ""Sweet Jane""'s gloriously faded core progression is one of the single most ripped-off blasts in rock and roll; the harrowing epic ""Street Hassle"" still sets a standard in orchestral rock augmentation that few bands can even dream of approaching. The transcendent helplessness of ""Caroline Says"", the sultry decadence of ""Walk on the Wild Side"", the sweet fuck-all of ""White Light/White Heat""-- all the songs that have been included on every other Lou Reed compilation are here, too. In some sense, the decision to include live takes of many of these songs would be preferable to offering yet another studio copy of ""Heroin"", if only Reed's lackluster, ""I'd rather be anywhere else"" live performances didn't so consistently wither in comparison. To give the man some deserved credit, though, it's hard to produce a ""bad"" version of a song as genuinely perfect as ""I'll Be Your Mirror""; it may be diminished here, but fundamentally, it remains one of the brightest jewels in rock's crown. And so it is for all of Reed's most brilliant moments. The bad news is, there's more here than just his most memorable work. Now, to state that many of Lou's later albums are awful is certainly subjective on some level, but I sincerely doubt there's a person alive (well, aside from Lou) who'd be pleased with any collection that attempted to sum up his career by including any songs at all-- even just one, as this compilation does-- from rock-bottom tragedies like Mistrial, Ecstasy, and The Raven. Unfortunately, after the necessary inclusions, that's about all he can do. So, rather than excise ""Rock Minuet"", the studio-alternate of ""Who Am I"", or any of the other relatively uninspired works of his later albums, and focus instead on his equally incredible, but more commonly overlooked 80s work-- or shit, just limited this thing to one disc-- he wildly over-reaches. All possible opportunities for cohesion have been denied here at the expense of the implicit notion that all Reed's work is created equal. It ain't. But you know what? Lou really was a genius (maybe still is). Even if his decisions make much of NYC Man a baffling ordeal, as albums go, the canonical rock and roll might contained in some of his greatest triumphs, even in second-rate form, save this album from the guillotine. Such is the scope of his songwriting skill. This is Lou's career, all of it-- from The Velvets to The Raven-- as it could only make sense to him, 3\xBD decades crammed into less than 3\xBD hours. Take away any sort of chronology and then attempt to find representation from every release he ever crapped out, and all that's left is a strung-out, confusing mess that could have turned out a hell of a lot better than it did. A hell of a lot like Lou, actually.","To one man, everything Lou Reed has ever released is absolutely perfect. And if his interviews are any\n\ indication ...

Airports for Light,The Vandermark Five,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90fc0084474cd0c0f7b/1:1/w_160/a4fa6c81.gif,2003-06-04 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8397-airports-for-light/,Atavistic,"Ken Vandermark gained his first real exposure as the young tenor sax player in Chicago avant-icon Hal Russell's NRG Ensemble in the late 80s. Along with Mars Williams, Vandermark provided an edgy, almost punky spirit to the band's music, and, after Russell's death, went on to form his own celebrated outfit with Williams, The Vandermark Five. Trombonist Jeb Bishop and the outstanding bassist Kent Kessler have appeared on all the group's records since 1997's Single Piece Flow, but Dave Rempis eventually replaced Williams. The quintet's music, like Hal Russell's, has generally maintained a space not easily pigeonholed as straight jazz, nor is it strictly avant-garde, free or jazz-rock; Vandermark might draw the easiest comparisons to New York fellow head-of-the-classer John Zorn, or more accurately, Ellery Eskelin. Airports for Light is the Vandermark Five's sixth record, and will be of interest to anyone who has enjoyed their previous five. In fact, the familiarity can be distracting: the playing is spot-on, all the time, especially from Bishop and Vandermark, both of whom display a fairly intimidating mastery of styles and timbres. The music ranges from European-styled free improvisation, rock and funk moves, sudden bursts of activity and all the cohesion you'd expect from a band of players who'd been together for much of the past decade. But if things occasionally seem a little too familiar, it's not for lack of interesting ideas. And it's not that this stuff doesn't swing-- it certainly does. ""Both Sides"", dedicated to legendary jazz tenor saxophonist Budd Johnson, lays it all out pretty clearly. Johnson's tenure with the pianist Earl ""Fatha"" Hines earned him a rep as one of the swingingest cats in town, and fittingly, Vandermark's tune is half Chicago strut and half snappy Playboy lounge blue. His solo actually reminds me of another sax-man, Plas Johnson, most famous for his playing on Henry Mancini's infamous Pink Panther theme, and a damn fine swingman in his own right. Vandermark's playing is loose, but clean; understated but obviously nuanced. He plays a perfect chorus, and Bishop's more modern sounding strains seem somehow misplaced in comparison (though not much, especially in light of the free jazz on either side of this song). The worst I can say is that the music is a tad on the comfy side-- and that's only a problem if you want it to be. ""Other Cuts"", dedicated to Curtis Mayfield, takes the nice-n-easy road, too, but as it applies to low-down 70s funk rather than beatnik jazz. And just as the band made quick work of swing, they have little problem finding the pocket here. Again, Vandermark's solo is precise to a fault-- not in his choice of notes or articulation, but in the way it so easily falls in line with the scores of small group funk sides of the late 60s and 70s. Think Lou Donaldson at his meanest, or The Crusaders playing a gig in a Houston dive on a weeknight. Of course, Kessler's completely free, unaccompanied solo midway through sort of blows any ""authenticity"" out the window, but only for the better. Airports for Light is at its best when it surprises. Several explicitly exploratory cuts-- like ""Plus (for Fredrik Ljungkvist)"", reminiscent of the early Art Ensemble of Chicago records, and ""Initials (for Jean Tinguely)"", a fairly chaotic mixture of bleating outbursts and clangs-- demonstrate that Vandermark's group is at home without the net of a genre frame (though my favorite moments are actually when their wheels start to come off, as on the blistering opener, ""Cruz Campo"", dedicated to artist Gerhard Richter, who was immortalized in the indie world when Sonic Youth took his Two Candles as the cover of Daydream Nation). Here, the kinetic, unhinged energy splatters all over the place, with Bishop in particular navigating the catastrophe with fresh, scatterbrained ideas. The band revisits this vibe on the closer, ""Confluence (for Sonny Rollins)"", though the end result is less a joyous anarchy than it is your workaday explosion of 60s-comeback era Rollins meeting post-John Zorn mash. (As a side note, Vandermark is a major Rollins fan, and some editions of this CD come with a bonus disc of six more of his songs.) The good news for folks not normally on the jazz bus is that Vandermark's records-- with this band and without-- tend to offer outsiders a helping hand. His own playing can be fierce, or noisy, and his band is always top-notch, but the tunes are hardly off-putting. In fact, in a way, The Vandermark Five are a perfect bridge for rock fans raised on the notion that jazz is the music of a secret society filled with a thousand guys named Bud or Johnny. By the same token, longtime listeners may not be knocked out of their seat, but should at least find enough of interest to invest the time it takes to make it through. Not quite as viscerally engaging as catching their set at the club, but good stuff nonetheless.","Ken Vandermark gained his first real exposure as the young tenor sax player in Chicago avant-icon Hal Russell's NRG ...

Answers,Ui,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cfc0084474cd0c0efa/1:1/w_160/e3fa0728.jpg,2003-06-04 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8335-answers/,Southern,"If rock bands are tight nuclear families, bass players perfectly embody flippant, middle-kid disregard. Check the bassist as a perennial Jan Brady: habitually overlooked, occasionally neglected, and usually crouched humbly behind a black Marshall stack, looking bored and/or distracted while Howling Singer and Shredding Guitarist blindly lick up every last glory-filled puddle of sweaty, lustful adoration with their long, pierced pink tongues. 2003 hasn't been such a stellar year for the four-string. The White Stripes made a big, noisy fuss (again) about (still) being a strictly picks-and-sticks outfit; Midwestern brethren The Black Keys have done pretty much the same. John Entwistle was replaced about nine minutes after he died. Les Claypool is jamming with members of Phish. And the once uber-cool drums-and-bass phenomenon of yesteryear has somehow tunneled itself into near irrelevance, with hipsters everywhere frantically adjusting their caps and muttering, ""That shit was soooo 2002."" New York's Ui, however, boasts two bassists, a newly initiated multi-instrumentalist, and a drummer. A four-man rhythm-section revenge fantasy, Ui's latest LP, Answers, isn't nearly as wearied or as Spinal Tap as its lineup might suggest-- this is intellectual, muscular stuff, metrical and expectedly throbbing. Marked by dynamic shifts and experimental space-hops-- and teeming with loads of (vaguely) jazzy grooves and cerebral pet tricks-- Ui persistently shake off the obvious, fiddling with time signatures, splicing, diversifying, and following an invisible sonic line that bounces and twists, stops, and starts before doubling back again. Answers is Ui's third full-length since forming as an instrumental outfit in the early 90s, and conveniently, their third official line-up (founding members Sasha Frere-Jones and Clem Waldmann have withstood both shift changes). Yes: Sasha Frere-Jones plays bass for Ui, which, to the non-rock crit crowd, might not mean a whole lot-- but to those of us perpetually buried in our awesomely Eddyfied Voice music pages, Frere-Jones was already a pretty fucking rad New York stylist, responsible for consistently penning some of the city's best music writing, and his nimble work on Answers only adds new dimension to the (er, at least my) forever growing vat of SF-J love. If nothing else, this album proves Frere-Jones knows his shit. Heavily ESG-influenced, Ui boast tons of strong New York rhythm-roots, drawing from a long, twisted lineage of Gotham-based dance-funksters-- even legendary Liquid Liquid bassist (man, these guys are secular!) Richard McGuire is signed on as a graphic designer (he also devised CD packaging for Lifelike and the Fires EP), lending Answers its curved, puzzle-piece face. And to further pad their collective artistic-collaborator resumes (as well as, I suppose, prove themselves less provincial) Ui toured and joined studio forces with Stereolab in 1998 (see Fires, recorded under the name Uilab, which features two originals and four-- yeah, four-- covers of Eno's ""St. Elmo's Fire""). Answers, though, is all Ui. ""Back Up"" pops open the album with the kind of burst that should make its title proud: alternately rumbling and reeling, the song is a bouncy tornado of funked-out grooves and sweet little melodies, each rubbing up against the others and gleefully motoring along. ""Get Hot, You Bum!"" is packed with thick, fuzzy basslines; ""Mrs. Lady Lady"" fronts (presumably vintage) synths and some (easily danceable) rhythmic breakdowns. A truckload of instruments-- myriad bizarre, creaky synths, even a guitar or two-- overload the album, but for Ui, it invariably skews back to the thump-thump-thump. The band's tendency to operate almost exclusively in beat-driven mode is interesting, and, for the most part, enormously successful-- but the inevitable fallout of is that it can get a wee repetitive after a while. Astoundingly, not repetitive enough to warrant serious complaint, but once you figure these songs out, there's not too much more to head back to-- unless, of course, you just wanna dance. When the world finally stops presuming that guitars (and, incidentally, cymbal crashes) are at the melodic core of a rock band, it should become impossible not to also recognize the bass as a surprisingly lucid sonic pioneer. Sparse without feeling empty, clear without being awkwardly straightforward, Ui can remind even the most jaded of guitar gods that what Mingus (or Mike Watt or Peter Hook) did wasn't a fluke-- the bass doesn't have to be supplementary. It's only a matter of time until dudes start tugging acoustic four-strings into coffeehouses to pluck sweet lines and collect wads of cell numbers from impressed ladies. Rhythm is the new lead.","If rock bands are tight nuclear families, bass players perfectly embody flippant, middle-kid disregard. Check the bassist as a perennial ...

Le Red Soul Communitte (10 Points Program),Tokyo Sex Destruction,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d45e6ef95969321085/1:1/w_160/46c0ecd9.gif,2003-06-04 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8097-le-red-soul-communitte-10-points-program/,Dim Mak,"Squeezing out meaning from their bilingual liner notes I noticed-- whoa! go figure-- those wacky kids in Tokyo Sex Destruction have the goddamn same last name! Hold up, keep a lid on: before you go running home announcing that you just stumbled upon Spain's garage-rock Jackson 5, note first that there are only four guys and, second, the brothers Sinclair are kicking it MC5 political, not a bit biological. In punk, a shared surname might represent unity, a gimmick, a constructed band history. With the Ramones and the Danielson Famile, there's a bit of each. In this case, though, the move's obviously a nod to the band's hero, John Sinclair, the white panther philosopher and agent provocateur behind the Detroit faves mentioned above. So why adopt the surname of the guy who didn't even pick up a guitar? Only getting half the MC5's genius, J.C. (drums, voice, Hammond, claps), R.R. (lead guitar, voice, and claps), R.J. (second guitar and spiritual advisor), and S.F. (fuzz bass, voice and claps), are content to shout ""hey!"" and play dress-up in that Make-Up-meets-The-Hives, black-pants-with-white-belt style. I just wonder why the spiritual advisor doesn't get to clap. Sometimes appearance is everything. Here, the product's coated in revolutionaries, public protest, Black Panther rallies. Tokyo Sex Destruction also offers a conceptual framework in which Le Red Soul Communitte (spelled differently on the cover, side, actual CD, and when it appears as the name of a song) is treated not only as the title of the album, but also an actual, difficult-to-spell organization. Commies are very sinister, right? Especially ones with soul! Continuing the fashion statement, the liner notes include ""Revolutionary Violence"", a Hallmark version of Noam Chomsky. They subtitle the album a ""10 Points Plan"" and though I listened closely for the fucking plan, all I could figure out is that they love soul music. To be honest, I'm still unsure how that forms any kind of legitimate escape route. TSD aren't all slick styling, though. ""Break Out"", the opener, is a great song. Clapping through its tight syncopation I found myself pretty excitedly thinking that not since those sassy N.O.U. guys offered kids-in-the-know a thirteen-point plan to destroy America have revolutionaries armed with swaggering guitar chops, Hammond organ, tambourines, a vague political argot, and fine sartorial choices kicked it so righteously. Ah, but bliss is an evanescent son of a bitch: at just about the three-quarter mark of the first blast, the band rears into full pontification mode. When the guitars fall back but the handclaps and rhythm section keep up, rest assured that the vocalist's about to start talking shit. For his first sermon, R.J. tells us that a large percentage of people are unable to afford their rent, but rich people spend a lot of money on junk. In rock music, as in emotional oratory, the force of the delivery causes more of an effect than the bare material, so maybe I shouldn't judge the band on its empty political posturing. To cite the cliché, it's not what you say it's how you say it. So, ideally, the energy, the sweat and adrenaline are the message? You dig? Me neither. Not until the eponymous final track does this band make good on the promise of the album's opening track: ""Le Red Soul Communitte"" has the ferocious energy of ""Break Out"" but adds a layer of distorted percussion and super-fuzz bass. It's more non-verbal than the eight middling tracks before it and relies nicely on an interchange between the pealing feedback of dueling guitars, organ, and barely there handclaps. Nice stuff. When modeling sound on an obvious archetype, strong writing with solid hooks become essential. I mean, why not toss in a catchy chorus or other brief moments of distinction? When Tokyo Sex Destruction get around to clapping outside the box and tap into some genuine rock verve, they transcend simply parroting their past masters and wind up sounding okay. But those moments are rare: at this point the Sinclair family proves to be but another band sloppily evoking a nostalgic rock history, sans-urgency. It's a politics of misheard intangibles, a lightweight taking on something that once weighed much more.","Squeezing out meaning from their bilingual liner notes I noticed-- whoa! go\n\ figure-- those wacky kids in Tokyo Sex ...

"Miami Sound: Rare Funk and Soul from Miami, Florida: 1967-1974",Various Artists,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e4ea9e61561daa56c0/1:1/w_160/f092646f.jpg,2003-06-04 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1990-miami-sound-rare-funk-and-soul-from-miami-florida-1967-1974/,Soul Jazz,"""Oh,"" Mom looked up for a moment to glance at the photograph I had unearthed, ""that's me with Disco Duck. They'd bring out the bird every night around twelve, and we'd all get a chance to dance with it. Good times."" I'd agreed to help my parents clean house in an effort to amend the fact that I was living with them for the next few months while I got back on my feet. Like any gross turnover of an entire house full of memories there were always a few surprises to be discovered. ""I didn't know you went to discos, "" I said, my tongue laced with derision. ""Weren't they sort of... lame?"" ""What?!"" Shock was apparent in her tone, as she queried, ""Aren't you the big 'music-guy'? I'm sure it was more of a party than the droning 'live-experiences' you always describe. Besides, I don't think you'd care to admit how many of those 'lame' disco-beats are found littered throughout the music that you're constantly waking your father and I up with every night. Son, you need to get in touch with your roots."" While I can't whole-heartedly support the majority of her comments, the latter-- regarding my need to understand the history of some of the music I unabashedly endorse-- is true enough. Luckily, Soul Jazz Records has done some of the legwork for me, collecting obscure classics from the masterful proto-disco Flahrda-based label TK Records onto a single disc entitled Miami Sound. Prior to their stint as KC & The Sunshine Band, Rick Finch and Harry ""KC"" Casey were merely two songwriters among an entire staff of talented arrangers, producers, and musicians turning out hits for Henry Stone's TK label. While the compilation includes many tracks from such successful artists as George and Gwen McCrae (both of whom would go on to crossover from funk/soul into disco, George doing so with the touted first track of disco, ""Rock Your Baby""), Timmy Thomas, and Betty Wright, there's also due respect to lesser known artists such as golden-voiced Helene Smith (""You Got to Be a Man""), R&B-crooner; Joey Gilmore (""Somebody Done Took My Baby""), mid-period funk-ers All the People (""Cramp Your Style""), and lilting nymphet Della Humphrey (""Don't Make the Good Girls Go Bad""). Among the most prized gems recovered by the collection, though, are undoubtedly the multiple tracks featuring James Knight & The Butlers. One of the most obscure artists from the TK stable, Knight is also one of the self-described ""funkiest cats ever to come out of Miami, Florida."" ""Save Me"" sports one of the biggest hooks on the album with a chorus worthy of becoming an anthem, as Knight, surrounded by an entire room full of percussive warmth and undulating basslines, ushers in his plaintive and repetitive cries of ""SAVE ME!"" before bringing the song to a conclusion with the distant sound of clapping hands. Changing this festive mood quite a bit is the still spectacular ""Fantasy World"". Beginning with a simple muted string rhythm, the track is fleshed out further by a heavy organ and some mellow horns before it takes a turn for the weird with a reverb-laden chorus and a distorted organ that's light years ahead of similar effects in fusion, funk, and even the Prince-indebted new wave of the early 1980s. Other compositions sound equally fresh and unnerving, as is the case with Timmy Thomas' ""Funky Me"", a keyboard composition that utilizes an ancient drum program to breathe fresh life into the already aging genre, adumbrating the future of post-punk and industrial music as well. What makes it sound even more disturbing is the realization that the song was originally the B-side to the unbelievably commercial and popular track ""Why Can't We Live Together"", making it one of the oddest and most rewarding choices for inclusion on the compilation. The only drawback to Miami Sound is that, due to the source material used for the majority of these tracks (more than likely a series of 45s), the bulk of them never have time to develop completely, tapering off just as a good groove is established. This is more than forgiven, though, as gratefulness for the compilation's existence outweighs the disappointment of not quite getting enough of a good thing. Besides, as the liner notes point out, this is only volume one in a series that threatens to exhaustively explore the connections between the final lingering golden days of soul music and the upstart genesis of dance and disco, thus bridging an unfairly maligned generational and musical gap. In regard to the recent resurgence of tinny guitars and funky breakbeats in dancepunk and indie rock, this compilation should be considered indispensable in gaining an understanding and appreciation for the roots of what will hopefully rise from obscurity as a viable element of the musical canon: that funky, funky Miami groove.","""Oh,"" Mom looked up for a moment to glance at the photograph I had unearthed, ""that's me with Disco ...

Us,Mull Historical Society,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40869fc7814a47cd7ba/1:1/w_160/6ad66213.jpg,2003-06-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5498-us/,Blanco y Negro,"If I had a nemesis in the ruthless world of indie rock, it would have to be Dan Bejar. Nothing against the man personally-- I'm sure he's a noble Canadian and all-- but nobody else in his profession inspires stronger feelings of rage in my bosom. His last album, This Night, was a throwback slice of 70s singer/songwriter excess: self-indulgent, bloated, nonsensical. Maybe if Bejar restricted himself to his other band, Destroyer, I could peacefully ignore him, yet he insists upon sullying the good name of The New Pornographers with his phoned-in, momentum-desiccating contributions. Grrrrr. And I don't drop this piece of character assassination to serve as mere see-saw balance to the frequent Bejar gushing put forth by Matt-ador LeMay in this webspace; this is full-disclosure pre-opinion, because if I were to describe Mull Historical Society (formerly a duo, now just auteur Colin MacIntyre) as the Scottish Destroyer, it would be just about the cruelest entry in my slambook. But for you, loyal Pitchfork reader, such a comparison could possibly be a glowing recommendation. Diff'rent strokes, y'see. Similarities: a voice firmly rooted in his throat (though slightly less squawky than Bejar's, not to mention more appealing), a love for the lush-pop era of Jackson Browne and peers, and a preference for working alone. Differences: MacIntyre possesses an alternate voice for versatility beyond talk-singing every tune, offers less forced-juxtaposition poetry, and is somewhat more genteel in instrumentation-- due to that whole British thing. The most profound resemblance between the two ""groups"" is the frustrating (if occasional) glimpse of melodic skill buried amidst the cliches and mediocrity, pleading for an editor or equal collaborator to swoop in and excavate. Opener ""The Final Arrears"" wields a sharp hook of a chorus, but the syrupy, wistful post-Britpop verses blunt the impact. ""Minister for Genetics and Insurance M.P."" shows glimpses of wry, Steely Dan-saluting jazz-rock, and ""The Supermarket Strikes Back"" is infectious and pleasant, but with over-glossed production and humdrum structure, it veers a little too close to a particular amphibious Wet Sprocket for comfort. While I'm taking cheap shots, I should add that it just... pisses in my tea how critics (including the grand old NY Times) can take the non sequiturs Bejar shovels for serious poetry (what the hell is ""I flew into a lesbian rage"" supposed to mean?) And yet, for all his faults, Destroyer-man has never penned anything as trite as ""Asylum"", which pleads ""place it on the sunny side of me"" like it can't wait to soundtrack a montage of a couple tearfully packing up their respective things before tearfully booking their respective breakup flights on Expedia.com. MacIntyre isn't afraid of getting his hands a little sappy, whether slow-dancing (""Don't Take Your Love Away from Me"") or biting Yorke's ""High and Dry"" falsetto to emote ""can anyone feel anything inside of me?"" on ""Can"". Actually, in light of that simpering, Destroyer-lovers might want to scratch the above backhanded recommendation. Though Mull Historical Society is an act one could easily file under ""pleasant-enough pop,"" at 13 tracks (plus a bonus disc!), MacIntyre's strictly 80bpm velvet-lined melancholia will test the patience of any Anglophile. My dislike of Daniel Bejar might be some volatile mixture of irrationality, priggishness, and psychosis, but one thing it's not is unfair, and McIntyre is not quite up to the level of ruining New Pornographers albums.","If I had a nemesis in the ruthless world of indie rock, it would have to be Dan Bejar.

Fag Patrol,Xiu Xiu,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aacc13d1975652139ad0/1:1/w_160/7915cd02.gif,2003-06-03 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8823-fag-patrol/,Free Porcupine Society,"As anybody who's ever watched a television show, seen a movie, or heard a song will tell you, intimacy is a bitch. It makes you accountable for all your bullshit, brings out your worst personality traits, and sometimes, makes you act like a crazy person. Musical intimacy, on the other hand, isn't quite so complicated. Most ""intimate"" music is strictly a one-way communication, and is rarely even remotely confrontational. Xiu Xiu mastermind Jamie Stewart, on the other hand, has a way of turning such conventions against themselves, and on Fag Patrol he turns all the signifiers of intimate music into complex, often unnerving emotional weapons. Fag Patrol is a nine-song mini-album featuring largely acoustic reworkings of six songs from Xiu Xiu's previous three releases, along with two new tracks and a cover. It isn't Xiu Xiu Unplugged, nor is it a Jamie Stewart solo record-- as with all Xiu Xiu releases up to this point, what it is can't be clearly defined. But in keeping with the band's conformance to unconformity, Fag Patrol finds emotional power in unexpected places, pushing the concept of musical intimacy to uncomfortable levels while laying bare the strong songwriting at the core of Xiu Xiu's unique and profound musical statements. But, strong though it may be, Fag Patrol is neither as unique nor as profound as either of Xiu Xiu's proper full-lengths, especially this year's monumental A Promise. That album's standout track, ""Apistat Commander"", perfectly embodies everything that makes Xiu Xiu so compelling. The moment when, pitted against a throbbing, impenetrable wall of industrial noise and organic hiss, Stewart's unstable tenor wails, ""Oh, this relief it's the oddest thing/ Oh my god oh my god oh my god,"" constitutes the most moving musical climax I've heard this year. While some are put off by the over-the-top, undeniably confrontational nature of Xiu Xiu's music, it's the very willingness to overstep conventionally accepted boundaries of expression that renders their music so incredibly affecting. The relatively sparse, largely acoustic arrangements of Fag Patrol don't allow for the terrifying transcendence of ""Apistat Commander"", but they do allow Stewart to twist the idea of ""acoustic intimacy"" into something perverse, voyeuristic, unexpected, and often beautifully disturbing. ""Helsabot"", the first track on Fag Patrol, and one of two previously unreleased originals, sets the tone for the acoustic portions of the record, as Stewart sings with a potent mixture of regret, reflection, and conspicuously constrained passion. Stewart's voice is right at the front of the mix, dominating a subdued acoustic guitar, every uncomfortable breath and awkward, searching silence intact. When, after one such silence, Stewart returns with a whispered, ""Do your pants ever just fall off off off,"" the effect is absolutely chilling. The oft-discussed ""I Broke Up"" receives a similar acoustic treatment, the song's notorious scream replaced by a venomous whisper that is ultimately much more powerful. Fag Patrol's other two unreleased tracks are standouts: ""Nieces Pieces"" sets Stewart's voice against a backdrop of decaying strings, as he sings of all the dark secrets his niece can look forward to discovering. Far from a touching tale about retaining the innocence of youth, Stewart touches on both the perpetuation of dysfunction within a family, and how, often, gaining awareness of that very dysfunction serves as its own coming-of-age ritual. Stewart's interpretation of The Smiths' ""Asleep"", also available here for the first time, conveys not only Stewart's deep understanding and appreciation of an incredible song, but his ability to convey the emotional heft of such a song without delving into melodrama for the sole purpose of cheap theatrics. Indeed, for all its hushed whispers, swallowed confessions, and short, gasping breaths, it's difficult to perceive Fag Patrol as even remotely insincere. If anything, the record demonstrates that, behind the layers of screeching and noise that many listeners find so alienating, Jamie Stewart is an extremely talented singer and songwriter, expertly crafting melody and using his voice in ways that most people would consider untenable, if not downright rude. It may be mostly acoustic, but Fag Patrol is by no means an easy listen-- just as it begins to draw you in, it stands poised to rip you apart or, worse, taint the whole experience with a single, understated, disturbing utterance. If that isn't intimate, then I don't know what is.","As anybody who's ever watched a television show, seen a movie, or heard a song will tell you, intimacy ...

'Fire on Ice' and 'Turn You to Love',Terry Callier,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ec5e6ef959693209a1/1:1/w_160/99993697.gif,2003-06-03 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1254-fire-on-ice-and-turn-you-to-love/,Elektra,"Two friends are walking around in Brooklyn, trying to figure out where to eat: ""What about Tempehest?"" says one. ""Eh, I heard the food's not that good,"" the other replies. ""Yeah,"" responds the first, ""but the DJ is really great!"" As DJ and vinyl culture has infiltrated nearly as many facets of social interaction as Clear Channel, so has it also traveled into the past through the feverish groove consumption to bring forth crates of obscure beats lost to time. And because of such investigation through the dust of record bins, figures that would have been written off to the times-- folks like Les McCann, Ananda Shankar, Idris Muhammad, or even Liquid Liquid-- have gained a renaissance back to sunlit brunch patios. One of the more curious unearthings was of Chicago singer/songwriter Terry Callier. Arising out of the coffeehouse scene in the early 60s, sporting a cloth hat, beard, and acoustic guitar, he found his way into the studios at Chess and Cadet, cutting three infinite-Saturday-afternoon-in-bed albums with producer Charles Stepney, himself famous for the pink laser light that was Minnie Riperton. Before getting lost a the mix of label mergers and lay-offs in the late 70s, Callier shot up a few warning flares through the oncoming haze of disco and R&B;, as his career began to go awry. Fire on Ice, from 1978, sputters on so many levels that it's hard to isolate just where things misfire. Is it the heavy-hand of producer Richard Evans, slathering saccharine strings over the funkier charts of jazz players like Eddie Harris and Phil Upchurch? Or is it the extraneous girl choruses fogging over Callier's own smoky, syrup-smooth voice? While it still conveys that gusty Chicago soul, cooing smoothly yet capable of dropping into a guttural growl, it barely salves the pat symbolism and synthesized schmaltz of ""Butterfly"" and ""African Violet"". But even his talents can't escape the foreboding gravity of club kickdrums that had penetrated every genre by that time. With a weighty title neither the Bee-Gees nor Walter Gibbons could possibly have upheld, ""Disco in the Sky"" cringes as it crashes, Icarus-like, unable to commit fully to disco or focus on the strummed acoustic guitar, forcing Callier, for some reason, to call out to Hendrix and Lorelei in the middle of the song. More than anything else, it's the songwriting of Terry Callier and partner Larry Wade that mars the whole affair, the lyrics too flimsy to do his voice justice, much less bear the bloated arrangements. Judging from the cover of Turn You to Love, Elektra's marketing focus was ratcheted up a notch the following year, recasting Terry Callier as ladies' man, with two tight bitties on the cover, and the man sizing up booties on the back, ready to mack. There's even social commentary and talk of how much his mother loves him. Sliding across the nasty electro bass, Callier's two-textured throat trembles with warmth on ""Sign of the Times"" and cools with the Egyptian cotton button-down of ""Pyramids of Love"". That leads into the satiny rustle of the title track, proving that he could've been a distinct R&B; personality had the breaks gone his way, albeit one more like Leon Ware than Jeffrey Osborne. The difference here is not in the studio gloss (though it is glaringly polished), but in the songs that Callier's sharp threads hang from. His cover of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again"", while missing the drugged groove and electric sitar solo, has portions of the Bard-ian verses to brighten with assloads of brass (including Fred Wesley) and a set of pipes that neither Becker nor Fagan could've ever exhaled. And in addition to a Smokey Robinson cover, Callier redresses two old classics, ""Ordinary Joe"" and ""Occasional Rain"". The former, already perfect as pop, gets too heavy a makeover, but the latter retains the gentle grace of the original, the gradual touch of other instruments never overwhelming Callier's singular voice and guitar playing. It's not the best way to turn you on to the excellent soul of Callier's past heights, when his best records could nearly be mentioned in the same sentence as the early works of Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, but there are traces of his voice that still linger on here. It can be worth a taste, but it does put an overwhelming slick of soft R&B; on your tongue all the way down.","Two friends are walking around in Brooklyn, trying to figure out where to eat: ""What about Tempehest?"" says one.

It's Not for You as It Is for Us,Bergheim 34,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27c5e6ef95969320416/1:1/w_160/af399dd4.jpg,2003-06-03 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/661-its-not-for-you-as-it-is-for-us/,"Klang Electronik, 2003Klang Electronik, 2003","The album kicks off with a jaunty flute lick-- it's almost cute. Happy little organ chords start perking around, then squishy synth stabs; the flute starts to flutter while some drums build in. Then the beat runs off, a suave and steady groove that'll play host to a funk guitar riff in a minute or two: it's like Fischer-Price techno, sunny and reassuringly blocky at the same time. When the beat bulks up, it's not the usual housey hi-hat loop coasting over. It's a guy. With his mouth. Going ""shick-a-thoomp, shick-a-thoomp."" To liberally paraphrase Alanis Morrisette: Thank you, Germany. Over the past couple years, the Germans have been churning out breeds of leftfield electronica that are pretty much revelatory, handily stirring up a lot of the genre divisions that IDM (""intelligent"" dance music) and regular old house, techno, and electro (""dumb-by-implication"" dance music?) have set up for themselves. Artists on labels like Klang Electronik and Bpitch Control have taken up the microprocessed sound-sculpting and hyperdetailed laptop jones from IDM, sure, but not so much the penchant for ""cinematic soundscapes,"" the heady splatter, or the fear of all things danceable. Instead, they've made techno and minimal techno, house and microhouse, IDM and electro, and music that's more than happy-- almost giddily happy-- to be all of the above. They seem, basically, to be in love with all the sorts of music only machines can make, whether that means abstracted glitches or thumpy bass beats, ambient echoes or straight-up synth buzz. This year has seen a few too many standouts in German sound-design to safely single out It's Not for You as It Is for Us as any clear winner-- even in Bergheim 34's more subdued neck of these woods, Barbara Morgenstern's Nichts Muss and Ellen Allien's Berlinette offer strong enough competition that doling out handicaps seems a bit pointless. What brings Bergheim to you here, today, is that ""shick-a-thoomp"": the slightest bit more than even their immediate colleagues, Bergheim have this free-floating and weirdly optimistic openness to the possibilities of their sound that makes them rather unique. That, and the fact that this record contains one of the better singles of the year so far, a subliminally humming groover called ""Random Access Memory"" that seems to crystallize everything that was exciting about Stereolab, Broadcast, and Lali Puna in one pillowy electric pulse-- a track that should be sitting on as many indie playlists as electro and techno ones. So yes, Bergheim do pop songs, on which Anne Vortisch sighs and croons all subdued and matter-of-fact over click-and-whir drum programs and tickly basslines. On ""System"", she actually puts a hint of R&B; into it-- between and that and the pizzicato string plucks, the track winds up sounding almost like an Aaliyah single as reformatted by an IDM auteur. But Bergheim's feet were originally planted in techno, and they do it here, if on the smallest scale imaginable: there's a minimal, microscopic feel to their tiny-music crackle and pop. On ""Nasty Girl"", a stiff, clattering beat-- just the beat-- stutters and winds around itself as complexly as laptop tweakery ever can. It's all nearly subliminal: ""Frogs on Grills"", for instance, seems oddly unassuming as its gentle click-and-cut programming revs a coasting beat, reedy wood-block tones, and some squishy funk touches through a casual series of twists, turns, builds, and falls. It feels like IDM, which is to say that you could fall asleep to it. But it also feels like if you turned it up loud enough, it could almost turn into a dancefloor stepper. And they play around. It's Not for You was supposedly created via online file-swapping-- the four members trading bits and pieces and finishing one another's ideas-- and it shows, not only in the grab-bag jumble of concepts here, but in their tone, as well. Half the time, it seems as if the four of them were all trying their hardest to surprise one another as often as possible. When Vortisch starts singing on ""Nasty Girl"", she sings the melody from Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" over a series of stop-on-a-dime breakdowns. (It's not the only moment of recognition, either: the prechorus to ""Random Access Memory"" features her Nico-ish delivery of Melle Mel's infamous ""Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge"" chorus from ""The Message""). ""US Key"" makes slice-and-dice with the mouth noises again, ornamenting them with a careful bass walk and programmed stabs of Vortisch's voice; ""Sucker Pt. 1"" cuts up organ tones and drum shuffles until it sounds like someone put jazz fusion in a blender and minced it into a fine goo. But that's standard German sound-sculpting, and what's likeable about this record is the possibility for surprise. Like on ""Coding Stains"", a grooved-out remix of ""Cotton Stains"" by Andy Weatherall's fantastic electro-tech Two Lone Swordsmen project: this is Bergheim's Night Out, with the beat rocking steady and even the vocal cut-up leaving plenty of room for a housey, repeating sample. And there's the second of two bonus tracks, possibly the most fascinating things here-- a big ominous chant from Vortisch that starts off brooding and works its way over to some psyched-up synthesizer freak-outs. As one Pitchforker says of this record: ""It's pretty weird."" And it is, though not in the usual way: it's weird in its surprises and beat-warping Easter Eggs; weird in its impossibility to pin down effectively; weird in its carefree way of floating from idea to idea and trusting you to follow happily along. ""Weird"" meaning ""interesting"" meaning, well, ""good.""","The album kicks off with a jaunty flute lick-- it's almost cute. Happy little organ chords start perking around ...

Tempting: Jenny Toomey Sings the Songs of Franklin Bruno,Jenny Toomey,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ddb1335d7bf169914a/1:1/w_160/1ba5a194.jpg,2003-06-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8106-tempting-jenny-toomey-sings-the-songs-of-franklin-bruno/,Misra,"Gender coincidence: What a butt-weird year it's been for the women, as they celebrate eighty-odd years of the right to vote in this land of liberati. Cat Power's You Are Free could lullabotomize a speed freak, Lisa Germano's new ferris wheel warns that you must be over thirty to ride, and Karen O's Yeah Yeah Yeahs crosswired all anticipation by releasing the year's best singles collection masquerading as an album. The finer offerings from the speculum-prone have been the results of collaborative efforts (Ms. John Soda, The Majesticons, The New Pornographers, Adult., Fruit Bats), which sent me digging through last year's while-we-were-out promo stack in search of a grrl who could strr my leftover soul. And even the crème of that plastic slurry is a disc on which a female salvages the work of a sub-pop patriarch. Shrimper and Inland empiricist Franklin Bruno is best unknown for his solo heapings, or for his work as one half of The Extra Glenns with The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, or as the frontman for the ill-recorded Nothing Painted Blue. He's a clever sod, often to a fault, as his songs build to rhymes/puns of which the listener detects he is all too proud. So he occasionally comes across as a neurotic talent, like that guy who has to do a bicycle trick on every corner. Bruno's covers, though, are reverent; consult his sweet take on ""What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?"" Jenny Toomey ran the Simple Machines label and (among other bands) led the agitprop outfit Tsunami, a group that indie traffickers felt bound to like, despite its nigh-monochromatic slogan-lyrics. Toomey's recent activist role is as the executive director of the Future of Music Coalition, which wages a noble losing battle against the megamedia casseroles who will insure that your children burn the Dixie Chicks' children at the stake, with help from, say, Coke, which will by then be called Water and will be pumped into Americans at birth to ensure that they're on schedule for their Puberty/Insulin implants at thirteen. Tempting seamlessly melds the strengths of Toomey and Bruno while tempering their indulgences. Toomey's voice is a brash and sensitive weapon with a deep trill that can suggest a cabaret where the armpit hair is off the hook (okay, a drag Scott Walker), but it also retains a humble twang (and on-key warble) reminiscent of elastic crooners such as Iris Dement or Jimmie Dale Gilmore. Bruno's songcrafting chops deserve the flesh-out they receive not only from Toomey's careful inflections, but from the arrangements of the eleven terrific musicians involved. You won't make it through opener ""Your Inarticulate Boyfriend"" without noting some scariachi that is particularly Calexican: yup, Joey Burns and John Convertino are in the house. Bruno himself contributes elegant guitar and piano so convincingly that one wonders why he ever dicked around with power-pop, while Amy Domingues multitasks on castanets, organ, cello, and bass. About that opener: it is so damn funny, about an intellectually hierarchical bond in which one partner ""holds up both ends of the conversation."" The majority of the songs present relationshippery as a surrender brimming with risk and ""martyrdom"" and compromise, but couply togetherness remains an irresistible proposition. ""Cheat"", for example, is a gorgeous plea for a rendezvous reeking of ethical abandon. ""Only a Monster"" concludes: ""I wouldn't be frightened if you were a monster/ But you're only human and that's even worse."" ""Pointless Triangle"" uses a Ouija board to negotiate a tryst, with a great line about the almost psychotic exclusivity that emerges in intense courtship: the speaker confesses that ""the small of your back"" is where ""the weight of the world"" lies. Politiquing surfaces on ""Masonic Eye"", which asks its object of desire, ""Will it take a war between the classes/ To get you to digest what you consume?"" And ""Unionbusting"" presents a long affair as parallel to failed labor negotiations. The western swing vibe expands endearingly to bossa nova at points on the record, with only the resolute defeatist anthem ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" threatening to Sheryl Crowify itself and ""Let's Stay In"" sounding so showtuney that the listener hurls sugar substitute. The rest of Tempting showcases the good kind of vomit-inducing beauty. Hell, ""Empty Sentiment"" could open an existential sitcom, maybe with Kirk Cameron as Dad this time. Toomey's choice of tributizing Bruno's sap-alog is ten times more effective than releasing an album about Clear Channel or RIAA rape. In this era of automatonic uncuriosity and assent, being humane and compassionate is almost radical. Tempting makes me want to do something as definitively ho-hum as have kids, even if they're going to be wiped out by a cancer wave or fried by a homeless genius with nuclear roller skates. I hope she loves that, even as an activist in a time of abominable transgressions, she made a ""love"" album, because (sniff) love is real. The guilt in these songs is, too. You know this if you ever saw a documentary about Palestinian rubble, but stayed transfixed by your date's fantastic hands.","Gender coincidence: What a butt-weird year it's been for the women, as they celebrate eighty-odd years of\n\ the ...

D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat,Junior Senior,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3b5e6ef95969322b4f/1:1/w_160/771c44be.jpg,2003-06-02 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4317-d-d-dont-dont-stop-the-beat/,Mercury,"I was once just like you. At shows, I would concentrate on remaining as still as possible, allowing only a tapping foot or nodding head to express any enthusiasm I had for the performer. When confronted with commercial radio, I would sneer and mime symptoms of illness, bemoaning the factory-produced facelessness of pop music. My head was full of a taxonomy categorizing all artists I came across as ""authentic"" or ""contrived,"" as judged by their biography, label affiliation, and oh yeah, occasionally, their music. For years, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with this behavior, considering my musical health robust, even vibrant. But after an appointment with the vaunted Dr. People, I realized I was suffering from a rare illness: Indie Guilt Syndrome, or IGS for short. Though I thought my listening diet was healthily balanced, Dr. People diagnosed me with a serious deficiency of Vitamin F(un), which led to excessive behavorial inhibition during shows and caused me to miss out on hundreds of irresistibly catchy and fascinating songs against which I'd been prejudiced based on sales figures. To treat this condition, the good doctor prescribed a revolutionary new cure: Junior Senior's D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat. Chances are, your only exposure to Junior Senior thus far has been the Fatboy Slim-endorsed ""Move Your Feet"", a track that happens to be the most stereotypically Euro on this record, layered as it is with three coats of rayon keyboard and a raspy diva shouting for global unity via the dance! It's a strong club track, but probably a bit of a deep-end dive for tourists from the land of singer/songwriter moping and fiercely proud lo-fidelity. Fortunately, the remainder of the D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat is easier to swallow for IGS sufferers, as Junior Senior draw their inspiration less from disco/techno clubland than from the classic rock dial. ""Boy Meets Girl"", f'rinstance, combines the psych-organ groove of early Traffic, cowbell-banging from ""Honky Tonk Woman"", and Kool & The Gang woo-hoo!'s, while ""Shake Me Baby"" speaks of wanting to be ""your tambourine man"" in a gleefully approximate Dylan impression. (If either fails to get you off wallflower detail, your IGS may be approaching the terminal stage.) Sure, this duo's wacky sexual-orientation hijinx (Junior is straight, Senior is gay, and boy, they don't let you forget it) are a bit gimmicky, but it's not like the popular duos of the indie rock world are publicity stunt-free. Plus, the backstory allows for lovably loopy songs like the raucous ""Chicks and Dicks"", the ""I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock 'n' Roll"" of gay/straight relations. Brimful of the unbridled horniness of ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" but without the hetero constraints of Mötley Crüe, the song contains the humanist message that Junior Senior will fuck any and everyone. Lyrically, the subject matter runs the philosophical gamut from ""move yo body!"" to ""rock da house!"", but for every moment that triggers the cheese reflex (pretty much all of ""Shake Your Coconuts""), there's a sly wink. The frantic ""White Trash"" declares, ""We wanna be like Nancy and Lee,"" a reference semi-obscure enough to appeal to long-time IGS sufferers. Not that you'll care much, as you hop along to songs like ""Rhythm Bandits"" and ""Good Girl, Bad Boy"", each alternating between hard-beat drum-and-chant verses and explosive go-go cage choruses. Sounding as much like playful garage-rock as cocky Europop, it's telling that one can easily imagine a unifying DJ set playlist where The Rapture's ""I Need Your Love"" segues into ""Move Your Feet"" segues into Justin Timberlake's ""Rock Your Body"". I don't mean to pressure you into the embrace of dance music-- many people live long, productive lives with IGS-- but if you're starting to chafe at the constrictions of the indie lifestyle, if your feet insisted upon doing more than just tapping at that last Dismemberment Plan show, and if you've repeatedly caught yourself humming ""Cry Me a River"" while you Kinko's your zine, consider Junior Senior as treatment for Indie Guilt Syndrome. [Warning: Side effects may include sexual potency, temporary girlfriend amnesia, and disco neck. Consult your physician before use.]","I was once just like you.

After the precursory spinning of mental rolodexes amidst have-you-seen-so-and-so-latelys, she made it known that she is now a part of the lost art of millinery. The yellow fedora of La bohème is her latest creation. ""It is a dying trade,"" she whispered, ""because of the quality of buckram. It's the foundation of the industry, and the machines that sew the material make lower thread counts; the very threads themselves are just weaker these days. They just don't make buckram like they used to."" From pink pirate hats to tilted trucker caps, they were all done better back in the old days! So, as I slump at the café, staring moribund at my chinos gone threadbare at the knees, I echo the sentiments of ""Summer Clothes"" off of Coloma's second release, wanting ""to wear the clothes that summer wears,"" in all its light fabric fits. I swear it will be the hit of the summer, fit for all café dwellers, mostly because there's always something there to remind me of that bygone era still ripe for nostalgic plucking and preening. For those who pine that The Postal Service were more Anglo, without the pink Death Cab for Cutie baby-tee, enter the stylish Le Corte Ingles of Coloma, two British ex-pats now residing in Köln, Germany. While Alex Paulick neo-romances the programming of Baroque strings and lingering xylophones cut-n-clicked back together again in a tasteful, unassuming early 80s style, Rob Taylor croaks and croons through a buttoned-down throat bothered with both Jarvis Cocker's aesthetic headaches and Bryan Ferry's decadent migraines, his head splitting at the seams with painful observations of the hip and hideous. His world is full of well-dressed assholes and slumming primadonnas, their visages parading as sensorial barrage: ""With their impossible skin and collagen Charles Atlas lips/ Courting the Italian waiter and whistling at the rose-sellers/ When in comes a shower of rickenbacker bricklayer hairgel dumbbell goodfellas."" Of course, he's not exactly innocent himself, as there's hair dye on his hands as well when he indicts himself on the epic rendering, ""The Tailor"": ""I don't do sincerity, I couldn't run a mile/ I don't offer guarantees, but I've got a lot of style."" As the dignified violin strokes fall apart at the seams, tearing into static, Taylor makes a clean breast of it, admitting, ""I am the Dream Weaver, this is the life I chose/ I'm the tailor who sews the Emperor's clothes,"" revealing his own nakedness in the final wrung breath. ""The Second Closer Still"" sutures a sneering lip quiver to Lithops-like hiccups, while the more uptempo ""If You Can't Be Good"", is Farley Jackmaster Funk with a xylophone on the touchpad throb. ""Illegible Love"" has all the saxy caress and satiny rustle of Wham's Vaseline-lensed classic, ""Careless Whisper"". Elsewhere, the tracks are as barbed as any sewing needle threaded with strands of tainted love. Where Coloma sticks through is in their persistence of vision. The images tumble past quicker than a parade of bulimic models at a Jello-shot slicked staircase, glossy and grotesque as they collapse. There's also that singular feeling Taylor enunciates as ""falling like a goose down feather dropped from a tenth story window sill"" that makes me swoon. Coloma remains tempered throughout, with every electronic fiber and silken sigh in its right place, proving that a knife lies within every sharp-dressed man.","Pure happenstance, I came upon an old acquaintance beneath Metropolitan Avenue.

Old Fashioned Love,John Fahey,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1dabf31b7dc7155e89/1:1/w_160/e0a7736b.gif,2003-06-02 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2946-old-fashioned-love/,TakomaTakoma,"John Fahey was a lover, first picking up the guitar in a gas station as a means of picking up chicks. So a good way to become enamored with Fahey's catalog is to just pick any track fixated on a woman, and go from there: ""Impressions of Susan"", ""A Raga Called Pat"", ""Requiem for Molly"", ""Beverly"", ""Juana"", or on this particular disc, ""Marilyn"". Each lady is lovely, dark, ultimately unknowable. Is Juana really a waitress in Oregon? Was Molly really out on Knott's Berry Farm? Who was this Marilyn? She is lush yet sad, and that might even be her squinched up on the cover, painfully reclining and staring out into space. When Fahey is playing her, it's at a much slower pace than the rest of the first side of this 1974 reissue. Second guitarist Woodrow Mann's second guitar glistens across Fahey's lead, each taking their sweet time in waving goodbye to her. The small diversions they take along every line are as exceptionally awkward as any of Thelonious Monk's irregularly melodic spurs, yet for all the unhurried and dissonant playing, the quickly picked finale shines a brighter hue on this lovely figure. Apart from the ladies, this particular session shows how Fahey's talents took him much further afield of the blues path than most people will credit him for. Here he tackles in succession ""In a Persian Market"" and the Hindu chant ""Jaya Shiva Shankarah"", the two guitars twining around their Byzantine themes with a heck of a lot of flange, giving the fluctuating fingerpicked patterns a secondary weaving of soundwaves. ""Old Fashioned Love"" is prime Fahey playing in its own right, but with the midway appearance of the old timey orchestra consisting of jug, banjo, clarinet, tuba, trumpet, trombone, piano, and drums, the ditty goes to a place seldom heard elsewhere in the man's catalog. The affected cymbal crash at the end also gives it an odd modern spin that confounds them ornery notions of time and nostalgia. John was never that easy to glean. ""Boodle Am Shake"" sounds straight off the shellac itself, Fahey blending into the background of the ensemble perfectly and sending up that wonderfully ridiculous refrain-- it's the one of the few instances of standard singing in his oeuvre. Fred McDowell's standard ""Keep Your Light Trimmed and Burning"" is recast here as a 1920s big band number to excellent effect, the Fahey arrangement a particular surprise. Very rarely would he work with so many attuned musicians before or after this point. The set closes with one of his truly magical works, ""Dry Bones in the Valley (I Saw the Light Coming Shining 'Round and 'Round)"", which was a gateway for many through the cover version exacted with Tony Conrad on Gastr del Sol's Upgrade and Afterlife set. The effects are off, the session musicians sent home, and it's a beatific example of Fahey's opened steel strings resonating into the infinite, droning yet with numerous emotional contours unfurling in the chiming notes. It may have aged 28 years, but Old Fashioned Love remains a consistently surprising collection of Fahey's many loves.",,8.4,

Upon hearing the horrific cry ripped from the throat of Daedalus, they knew the game had gone too far. When the last of the padded leather costume was shed they quickly squinted toward the horizon to see, falling from the sky, the body of the young boy they had come to pay homage to, his graceless and pinioned form careening inevitably into the distant Aegean Sea. Initially, it seemed like a good idea coaxing the old inventor through his complex and intimidating technological exercise. After all, the strategy seemed to work on their latest release, Six Soviet Misfits, a two-disc collection of the group's previously released UL-6 EP, Soviet Igloo 12"", and Misfits LP. The idea was to utilize a series of black boxes functioning as micro-labyrinths-- through which only chance bits of data are allowed to pass-- that would inevitably reconfigure information via wires and circuitry boards as something unexpectedly musical. The group's hope was that by donning the guise of the Cretan half-man/half-bull and pushing Daedalus and his son through the real labyrinth, the mythological duo would happen upon something equally interesting and novel. Unfortunately, Brown, Britton and ultimately Icarus pay the price for this tinkering, as the formulaic approach builds expectations that are seldom satisfied. Of course, there could be no opportunity for a fall if anticipation weren't raised to a heightened level. ""Benevolent Incubator"" begins with a jazzy swarm of percussion instruments-- including the ever-present skittering snare-- that gives way to a beautiful melody anchored by a handful of extended tones and the warm hum of various computer generated noises that finally usher it to conclusion. Organic and cohesive, the composition sets the bar high for the remainder of the album, which never fully meets the mark again. While compositions like ""Borichean Pintak"" and ""Nine Fresian"" contain moments of uncluttered beauty that parallel ""Incubator""-- utilizing minimal drum-programs and sighing electronic manipulations that give both tracks a haunting element-- they eventually devolve into the lowest common denominator: predictable, uninteresting dance music. ""Xot Zoiks"", ""Despair"" and ""UL-6"" attempt to circumvent this potentially crippling fault by supplementing the musical ideas of various other electronic luminaries like Boards of Canada, Autechre, and Plaid, but unfortunately, instead of fleshing out the music, the tonal clusters, distorted beats, and jazz-inflected bass serve only to illuminate the duo's shortcomings in light of their inspirations. This leads to the aural equivalent of counterfeit inspection-- leaving it up to the listener to hold each piece of sound up to the light in order to search for the watermark of originality, a task both tedious and annoying. As Icarus and Daedalus discovered, context is potentially more harmful to the creative process than imitation-- specifically, the available tools and employed methods of the artist. It's at the hand of their own limited musical palette that Brown and Britton fail in their misadventure, as similar to the old man quickly throwing together precarious materials in a bid to exit the cold confines of the labyrinth, the group produces an album that feels rushed, weak, and too eager to flee its roots in drum 'n bass and jungle. Like Icarus approaching the white heat of his demise, the musical counterpart can only bear witness to the consequence of a half-realized album that, though it never quite kisses the earth with gossamer wings, is as equally unfastened by the warm radiant glow of its aspirations.","Ollie Brown and Sam Britton (aka Icarus) slowly began to make their way out of the Minotaur suit; one pulling ...

Alter,Pleasure Forever,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2029d034d5c69bf2ac5/1:1/w_160/99b0c3c8.jpg,2003-06-01 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6346-alter/,Sub Pop,"Pleasure Forever's Alter boasts one of the more inane covers I've seen: three suited men with carefully gelled hair cluster in the center of a white, columned room, encircled by a string of blood-red roses. Middle guy wears lots of jewelry and holds a flower to his chest. Precious! Above them, in a rich gold font, lie the dreadful words, ""Pleasure Forever."" Note the infinity symbol separating the two halves of that phrase. shudder Had I purged myself of all familiarity with this band, disregarding the little Sub Pop box slapped proudly on Alter's binding, I'd have expected some riotously bad Daniel Bedingfield-inspired dance tracks. Instead, I smirked, chuckled glibly, and mentally filed Alter away as a preposterously solid example of why we should never, ever judge a record by its cover. Pleasure Forever only look dissolute. There's a little bit of the grown-men-standing-in-a-circle-of-roses to their sound-- these are opulent, dark, glammy songs, tugged around by cabaret-style piano lines-- but Pleasure Forever are also a fine, thrashing rock band with some heavily distorted guitar and lots of rough, lecherous vocals. Things may go tribal and occasionally skew a little bit goth, but they never lean toward the kind of greasy, sordid beat-bopping implied by Alter's Euro-creepy package. The band hails from sunny San Francisco, and have been known, at various points, as The VSS (then with Sonny Kay) and Slaves; their current incarnation is a smarmy three-man circus dedicated to wedding bits of prog indulgence with post-punk brooding and early metal noise-- to secure yourself a more specific prototype, conjure the freaky crossbreed of Interpol (whom, to be fair, they effectively pre-date), The Jesus Lizard, and Nick Cave's Bad Seeds. They don't sound like much you've heard before. Each of Alter's twelve tracks are structurally slippery, shifting seamlessly from style to style in a way that makes it almost impossible to accurately map their paths. The subsequent mazes can be disorienting, but it's the most thrilling brand of dementia, as well as an acute reminder of the tension and balance true songwriting prowess can build. This is not rote, predictable stuff. ""Czarina"" opens with jingly, resonant piano and airy, rollicking drums; the song eventually breaks itself down into a gritty, single-string guitar fight, heavy and addictively thick. ""Aeon Flame"" twists a bouncy synth line with dicey percussion and guitar, allowing all three elements build to tiny climaxes and peppering the track with unexpectedly cathartic bursts. By five minutes in, Andrew Rothbard's profoundly distorted voice has spiraled into something entirely otherworldly, sneaking toward Thom Yorke vocals-as-just-another-noisy-instrument territory, and becoming almost entirely indistinct from Joshua Hughes' fuzzy, spectral guitar. Rothbard's copiously fuzzed vocals, while never tedious, can occasionally get a little impenetrable; Pleasure Forever's self-titled debut proved that his pipes justify at least a few moments of unadulterated, plain old singing. In more questionable moments, the vox evoke a heavily eyelinered, squealing Scott Weiland, but it's Rothbard's piano tinkering that consistently pulls Pleasure Forever from the pits of overindulgence, providing already-packed songs with additional rich, curious melodies and spots of light. The transposition of keys and feisty percussion with feral vocals and wild guitar wrangling is, ultimately, what's most interesting here: the juxtaposition is dynamic, if occasionally unsettling, and steeps in a kind of nasty, drunken licentiousness. It's hard to say why, specifically-- Rothbard's lyrics are apocalyptic but certifiably obscure (""Caressed solace of oceans sinking/ Liquified sky of fishes drinking/ Driving drifts to flash flood finish/ This is the Zodiac speaking""), and the band's instrumentation is clever enough to endure any number of interpretations. Only their dark, sinister atmospherics can be properly linked to the cryptic, inexplicably black synergy of these three men and their instruments. I don't know what roses have to do with it.","Pleasure Forever's Alter boasts one of the more inane covers I've seen: three suited men with carefully gelled ...

Computer Recital,Lullatone,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd95abf31b7dc7155f9c/1:1/w_160/87170aa6.jpg,2003-06-01 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4912-computer-recital/,Audio Dregs,"Consider the sine wave. It's the purest tone possible, a smooth wave without overtones. A sine wave, if reproduced properly, sounds exactly the same as another sine wave at the same frequency. Perhaps because few sounds in nature are true sine waves (some insects come close), we associate sine waves with machines. Ryoji Ikeda builds much of his music from sine waves, and the tone of his music reflects an abstract, mechanized and mathematical world. Ikeda has made some mind-blowing music that, to me, doesn't sound particularly human. It's music that seems pulled from some philosophical plane and injected directly into my brain. But Ikeda's ideas are only part of the sine wave story. I wonder if-- for American kids, at least-- a lifetime of exposure to the emergency broadcast system tests hasn't given sine waves a twinge of humanizing nostalgia. I remember tests while Electric Company played, and I remembered the real thing when a tornado would touch down in the area. I hear sine waves now and it triggers vague memories of being huddled with my family in a damp basement with the radio on, hearing the branches rattling against the house as the wind whipped outside: ""Bzzzzz. This is the Emergency Broadcast System... a tornado warning is in effect for..."" The familiar EBS tone was not actually a sine wave; the combination of two tones, 853 Hz and 960 Hz, gave the sound a slightly grating edge meant to signal ""danger."" But it was close, and it was the kind of thing you paid attention to when you were a kid. The EBS tone, though ostensibly a warning, had a certain comfort to it. On Computer Recital, Lullatone has found a way to take sine waves and arrange them into soft, gentle little lullabies, and I can't help but wonder if Shawn Seymour (Lullatone's driving force) feels a similar sense of nostalgia. This is music that instantly seems connected to pleasant childhood memories. Lullatone gets some of his warmth from the sine waves by not being a purist. While he makes regular use of clean tones, he mixes them with tones enriched with a dollop of harmonic distortion, in addition to tossing in some other instruments occasionally. So you get some organ, little hints of percussion, and even a subtle vocal. Lullatone's melodies are the repetitive and sequenced sort that minimalist composers added to music's vocabulary, and though tracks are easy enough to tell apart, the mood from one to the next varies little. Computer Recital is a calm, clean, reflective musical space that seems intimately connected with sounds coming from Japan, despite Lullatone's home base in Louisville. More than any single record, Computer Recital reminds me of the patient, measured melodicism of Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko's solo album Ongakushitsu. It definitely sounds like something that could have come out on Childisc (witness titles like ""Coloring"" and ""Plastic Toy Record Player""), and, deepening the connection, Lullatone's only other release is a split-single with Takemura alias Child's View. Even with these obvious inspirations, Lullatone doesn't seem derivative-- or, more accurately, the fact that it may be derivative doesn't much matter. There's something in Computer Recital's single-minded pursuit of simple beauty that personalizes the record. Everything about it radiates smallness and intimacy; it's intended for one-on-one communication, and hence, consideration of outside references seems unimportant and possibly even intrusive. The only requirements for enjoying Computer Recital are ears and the ability to daydream.","Consider the sine wave. It's the purest tone possible, a smooth wave without overtones.

Deceleration Two,Califone,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ddb1335d7bf1698a79/1:1/w_160/ca089770.jpg,2003-06-01 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1239-deceleration-two/,Perishable,"The other night, NPR ran a feature on one of the world's oldest living cinema pianists. I'd wager that perhaps not a single person reading this site has ever been to a cinema where a real, live piano player sat and soundtracked a silent film as it played. The practice pretty much ended in the 30s, as silent films died and gave rise to their talking descendents. You can imagine how progressive it must have seemed in the late 1920s when moviegoers were first able to see Al Jolson moving his mouth on screen while simultaneously hearing his voice from in-theater speakers. As it became possible in the early 30s to record sound directly to film-- thus eliminating synching issues that had plagued early ""talkies"", as they were known-- film scoring gave way entirely to the process we're familiar with today: a score is composed, recorded and subsequently dubbed into the film's audio track (and, of course, marketed as an album and sold in tandem with the film). Those early cinemas with their pianos by the stage faded into quaint memories, along with most of the performers who worked there every night, highlighting the drama, the comedy, and the romance that played out on the screen above them. Decades upon decades later, in an entirely new century, the idea of having musicians in the room performing a score while you watch a movie is an almost completely foreign one. Prerecorded scores are now the only accompaniment we're accustomed to, and as such, the idea of people improvising to a film feels progressive all over again. But throwback or no, Califone's Deceleration series (the band issued One last year) is an eminently worthwhile project, comprising the band's live, improvised scores to short films created by acquaintances. Deceleration One was a fantastically powerful recording, cinematic in an altogether different sense. And though its follow-up was recorded at the same time as the original (February 2002)-- as well as the circumstances surrounding its recording-- it's a very different beast, favoring steadier rhythm and much busier accompaniment. Whereas Deceleration One scored a series of film loops and Ladislaw Starewicz's short film The Mascot, and its general tone could best be described as largely ambient, this album functions as the score to three distinct films (Brent Green's Francis, Jeff Economy's Fireworks (No Mail Days Are Sad Days), and Alla Navimova's Salome), which allows for a wider diversity in sound. Of these films, Francis is the only one I've actually seen, thanks primarily to its inclusion as a multimedia track on Califone's most recent proper full-length, Quicksand/Cradlesnakes. Its score, a wildly percussive piece of music, opens this disc, marking an instant departure from the elegiac tones of Deceleration One. The warm, swelling synths and squawking guitars that found their way onto much of the last record are present, but the mood is like none the band has committed to tape before; though initially accompanied by tribal drums, the six-minute piece eventually morphs into a fantastic R&B; groove, then back into another polyrhythmic drum freakout, and finally departs with only the gentle buzzing of a synthesizer or two. The three pieces performed for Economy's Fireworks (No Mail Days Are Sad Days), meanwhile, are fiercely, stubbornly chaotic-- almost brutal at points-- especially for a soundtrack to something with such a whimsical title. Your enjoyment of these pieces will be a direct reflection of your tolerance for crunching bursts of noise, outright lack of structural contour, and gratuitous space echo. It's a freakish pile of piano, amplifier noise, cymbal, found object percussion, and other assorted slop that never seems to arrive at any apex or reach any particular destination. The album's second half, though, makes it all worth sitting through. I imagine Salome to be a beautiful film, if the music is any indication. The piece is split into twelve tracks, but flows seamlessly from point to point, settling into softly whirring synth and mandolin eddies, and bursting forth in rushes of shimmering noise with incredible, telepathic grace. The band even puts the funk hammer down on a breathtaking section called ""She Dances"", guitars scratching away with wah pedals to the metal, posing all kinds of intriguing questions as to what could happen if Califone grafted their signature junkyard folk onto this chassis. Obviously, widely distributed films aren't like to see live scores these days, but with their Deceleration series, Califone have made a hell of a case for, at the very least, using live improvisation as a method of composing scores. Anyone who digs Pink Floyd's early soundtrack work (especially More), is almost sure to love this stuff, and the Salome section is one of the most outright enjoyable pieces of improvised music I've ever heard. Film music rarely gets more dynamic or challenging than this.","The other night, NPR ran a feature on one of the world's oldest living cinema pianists. I'd wager ...

Fire,Electric Six,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc36c0084474cd0c2a33/1:1/w_160/24a7b8b7.jpg,2003-06-01 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2733-fire/,XL,"""She is so white (white!)/ I was born to excite her/ She could never be whiter!"" Now, I swear, I can smile and nod as well as the next dude. Maybe better. It's not as easy as you might think to drag me into the cynical pop Philistinism that prevents so many of my indie brethren from enjoying themselves. Even I have my limits, though, and when it comes to Electric Six's debut full-length, even the vaunted ""pop defense""-- the Johnny Cochran of all justifications for idiotic music-- can't win this case. If Andrew W.K. hadn't gone out of his way to lower a common denominator that was already quite low enough, thanks, these repellent schlock-rockers would have taken care of it. All of you, every last one who defended I Get Wet's slope-browed Anthems of Commerce as anything other than pandering, mindless escapism, reap the terrifying fruits of your labor: Fire. Is it that I don't ""get"" the Electric Six? Believe me, I get it; it's just that once I got it, I started looking for a way to get rid of it. When snarling frontman Dick Valentine subjects me to lyrics like, ""I've got something to put in you/ At the gay bar,"" I just wonder if, upon the crazy success of their incredible disco/rock hybrid, ""Danger! High Voltage"", these guys simply decided it was easier to just give up than to try topping it. Granted, it's not all as sophomorically abominable as ""Gay Bar""; some of it's actually even kinda funny, in a Men Without Hats sorta way (""Radio message from HQ/ Dance commander, we love you""), but let's be direct: these guys mention ""fire"" in nearly every song (that, or ""going to war"" on the dancefloor), and the subject of ""Naked Pictures"" is none other than-- whoa-ho-ho!-- your mother. Clunky power-chord progressions, tinny percussion, and distant synths complete the gruesome aura of kitsch surrounding Fire-- and that wouldn't be so bad if we could at least dismiss it as pure novelty. If only there wasn't that lingering sense of vacuous sincerity. Electric Six, like Andrew W.K. before them, are not in the business of satire. However: if it's really all fun and games, as the staggeringly insipid Detroit six-piece might lead you to believe, the music doesn't give it away. 80s rock clichés abound-- but just subtly enough to imply that the band was either too musically incompetent to follow through to the point of parody, or just didn't give a shit that they are, in essence, a very sincere hair-rock band. Even the ballad here-- a love song to a synthesizer-- is drenched in beamingly heartfelt bleach-blond solos and soaring, Winger-esque keyboards. But hold up, it's confession time: until my HMO approves my elective surgery, I'm not made of stone. And even though many of these songs are steaming retro-piles, and the lyrical content here often makes a fatal car crash seem pleasant by comparison, Electric Six actually bothered to throw in a few songs that are genuinely, unabashedly entertaining. Slightly funky guitar lines skirt along the edge of power ballad territory, while Valentine dives completely over the edge on the laughably earnest, yet surprisingly upbeat ""I'm the Bomb"". Title aside, it's the band's most serious moment, and proves to be a fairly even blend of bouncy, disposable pop and just enough real meaning, or sentiment, to sustain interest. ""Synthesizer"", the aforementioned techno-serenade, closes the album immediately afterward on an equally positive note; the loopy, whistling synth tropes are at least a decent counter to the time they spend mining hair-metal elsewhere. And yes, ""Danger! High Voltage"", the surprise British dance hit of '02, is reprised wonderfully, forming the only truly illuminating cut to be found on Fire. The steamy sax action and rattling, echoing guitar-funk has all of the original's overwhelming urgency, and then some, thanks to co-yelps from Jack White. After having put me through Whirlwind Heat, I was sure that Jack and I would meet in the afterlife as enemies on the vast battlefields of Valhalla, but his desperate screaming offsets Valentine's sneering rumble perfectly, achieving an almost impossibly frantic tone. The band never even comes close to that level of unrestrained might anywhere else; the only other song that succeeds similarly-- in spite of wading hip-deep through the prevalent 80s rock clichés-- is ""Electric Demons in Love"". And even that remains too rigidly tied to Def Leppardisms to pass as anything greater than a basic achievement of its aim. So that's my dirty little secret: in spite of myself, I like a few of these songs. I only hope that my earlier warnings are sobering enough to put it all in perspective. As good as ""Danger! High Voltage"" is, the rest of this album is simply not worth it. Fortunately, you can just pick up the single for half the price, and without having to put yourself through this hairy mess.","""She is so white (white!)/ I was born to excite her/ She could never be whiter!""

We Are from Nowhere,Dance Disaster Movement,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a898b1335d7bf16992ff/1:1/w_160/39a6466e.jpg,2003-06-01 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2160-we-are-from-nowhere/,Dim Mak,"Dance Disaster Movement are a scarf-bedecked duo from Long Beach. They wrap themselves in bright white uniforms, evoking a dyadic dance-obsessed schism of The Polyphonic Spree and the anesthetized crispness of fresh bedsheets in a sentimental commercial for stain-lifting detergent. Sonically, they craft danceable punk-out rave-ups circling around a synthesizer, male group shouts, and heavily groove-based drums. And on We Are from Nowhere-- their first full-length after an out-of-print, tour-only seven-inch-- Kevin Disco (no relation to Bis' John Disco) and Matt Howze opt for moving one's ass as a fun way to break a sweat. Regrettably, though, these cats' vision isn't adventurous or expansive enough: they rarely vary their aesthetic scope beyond the obvious stereo-electro start/stop clutter, and as such, the results are more symptomatic of current trend-following than some dynomite block party. On a more positive note, half the songs are over five minutes (the longest clocks in just under seven), which is a respectable length for aiding and abetting getting one's groove on. But part and parcel to a seemingly endless stream of post-millennial dancepunk groups, Dance Disaster Movement simply meld ESG, mid-career P.I.L., Devo, A Certain Ratio, and, whether they realize it or not, the vastly forgotten Silver Apples into an easily digestible pabulum. And beyond being just another album in a line of similitude, We Are from Nowhere suffers from internal homogeneity: Dance Disaster Movement fail to diversify the dance moves much during the album's eight unsurprising tracks-- most of which unfurl amid equivalent patterning: ebb - two beats - flow - two beats - ebb - fill - flow, etc - give or take a beat. But perhaps this isn't a lapse of historical or aesthetic vision: DDM could possibly be hemmed-in by the limitations of their retro gear, or their inability to use the shit to its full potential. The Omni keyboard, released by Arp in 1976, is an analog synthesizer with four separate voices (monophonic cello and bass, polyphonic viola and violin) and a bass/synthesizer section. The strings, synth, and bass synth are all simultaneously available. That's a lot of action. And there are two oscillators per voice. Kevin Disco, though, can't seem to get his to do much beyond mid-Victorian rapid-fire oscillating burps. The song structures themselves are also fairly formulaic: as is often the case with this kind of thing, there are far too many build-ups that lead to a crescendo. The seed is forever spilled. Also, there's usually some sort of discordant twang of a guitar or simulated string running counter to the general flow of the other instruments. It becomes a catchphrase halfway through. However, one of the stronger compositions, ""The Shots"", offers some punk-rock chutzpah-- a likable anthem about escaping to the mountains, reminiscent of P.I.L.'s ""Rise"" without Johnny R's wide-eyed charisma, the song boasts: ""Got my head in the clouds/ My middle finger is up."" The strongest bit on the album, ""I Want Your Sass"", moves between tempo shifts, and remains enjoyable despite endless scatterbrain shouts of (yes) ""I want your sass"": It begins like Julie Ruin, moves into Stereolab territory, cozies up to the Blues Explosion and the angularity of Six Finger Satellite, chills outs a bit, and flies past full of nervous energy and sugary hooks. Keep context in mind, though; it's also the first track, at which point you're still innocent to the fact that, aside from two forgettable videogame-digitally-analog-skipping instrumentals, you're going to have to deal with basically the same song with slight variations for the next half hour. By the second number, the slower-paced ""C'est La Vie"", the pattern recognition has already begun to emerge. Midway through, Disco announces: ""Don't you even think the beat will make a change!"" That's the problem, man, it doesn't! Though select tracks off We Are from Nowhere would nicely compliment a living room dance party, We Are from Nowhere just doesn't offer enough respite from Dance Disaster Movement's synthesized sameness to maintain any sort of boogie-woogie, let alone kickstart an entire movement.","Dance Disaster Movement are a scarf-bedecked duo from Long Beach.

Failer,Kathleen Edwards,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc04eb335119a49ecb81/1:1/w_160/914f1f41.jpg,2003-05-29 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2684-failer/,Zoe,"Whenever a record features a lyric like, ""You call me Danny and I call you Mable/ You passed out so I flipped through cable,"" it's almost impossible not to immediately demand some kind of cultural perspective-- anything to justify that kind of deliberately queasy setting. Mostly, this means fronting an appropriately coarse locale. Check the millions of unmitigated references to Iron & Wine's hometown of Miami, Florida, and the inevitable beard-stroking that accompanies attempts to nail Sam Beam's throaty, broken-down folk to a town better known for topless sunbathing and people in frayed jean shorts and/or rollerblades. Somehow, authenticity is all tied up in claiming the proper context-- a kind of geo-cultural aptitude, wherein the sound and feel of a record is inextricably linked to the nuances of the landscape. How palatable would The Strokes' cigarettes and shitty jeans be if the band had burst forth from the streets of Vermont? Might we have suspected their art-rock credibility? Kathleen Edwards is Canadian, and sleepily coos sad songs about jobs down south, slurping whiskey, infidelity, and dirty girls in dirty bars. Her album also hosts a track called ""Hockey Skates""; like Neil Young or The Band, Edwards seems firmly rooted in a very specific kind of guilty, gritty American longing, despite hailing from a tidy, peaceable country with unarmed policemen and free health care. It's an anachronism that can only be effectively squared by complete geographic disregard: close your eyes and think of Mississippi. Or learn to reconcile yourself to the high, lonesome sound of muddy Canuck melancholy. Because despite this conflicy, Failer is an accomplished debut, packed with haunting, tired laments that only occasionally cross the line to preciousness. A few too many goofy guitar solos break things, and some over-produced, swelling strings seem out of place, but Edwards' breathy, wearied singing is certainly true and consistently compelling. Opener ""Six O'Clock News"" is deceptively swishy for a song that recounts the brutal murder of a man whose baby is slated to arrive, via the narrator, this June; the sodden and languished ""Sweet Little Duck"" is a brooding, minimalist acoustic crawl through depression (""I sleep through most days/ So the time goes by/ And I think I drink now more than ever."") ""Maria"" is steeped in (carefully monitored) guitar feedback and hooky vocals, with lyrics that boast more cars and drugs and fast, fleeing women. Edwards is perpetually being pinned to her Lucinda Williams poster, and the comparison-- the borderline irrelevance of which, I'd imagine, must be properly irritating to Edwards-- is actually apt, if a bit too easy to be fulfilling. She's mastered Williams' dusty, slept-all-day whisper, but there's a bit of Aimee Mann's crafty songwriting here, too, and Failer certainly evokes, if only incidentally, the atmospherics of Nina Nastasia's striking debut. This is impeccably put together (if painfully straightforward) alt- country, the kind of stuff that wins Grammys and sits on the coffee tables of well-behaved urbanites, who will shiver a bit when Edwards says ""fuck,"" but quickly grin and giggle at her candor, clinking their martini glasses. Regardless of the audience she's bound to attract, Edwards has significant songwriting prowess, and Failer stands up to any unfashionable associations.","Whenever a record features a lyric like, ""You call me Danny and I call you Mable/ You passed out so ...

Jefferson at Rest,Early Day Miners,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe613d197565213b1bf/1:1/w_160/906a6cab.jpg,2003-05-29 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2656-jefferson-at-rest/,Secretly Canadian,"Every so often, a band perfectly encapsulates the natural environment in which they're based. Central Indiana, like central Illinois, central Iowa, and many other Midwestern centrals, is carpeted with a waist-high forest of corn and soybeans, stretched out on ironed-flat topography. Flying over the region you can see all the farms drawn out into perfect, rigidly shaped dimensions; driving down I-74 the sky sometimes drapes around, radiant blue on all sides. In other words, it gets old fast. Early Day Miners show a talent on their third full-length, Jefferson at Rest, for tapping into that corn-belt uniformity some call tranquil and others call bland. With arrangements confused about where sparse ends and dull begins, most of these seven songs tread water like they're taking a summer camp swim test. Sounding worshipful, at times, of milk-carton kid Mark Kozelek and the stormin' Mormons of Low, Early Day Miners rarely exhibit the nuanced dynamics that allow their idols to produce more than mere sedative sonics. After the promising, rich-toned opener ""Wheeling"", Jefferson sinks into a mellower mood, as the Miners try their hand at spinning sepia-toned country portraits. Unfortunately, they can't help but sound like a second-wave emo band trying to go pastoral, American Football-style twin guitar weaving beneath grocery list lyrics of cookie-cutter antique imagery: factory work lights, homesteads, transistor radios, quarry swimming pools. Left to fend for themselves with little creative context, such words lend the songs all the down-home authenticity of a Cracker Barrel. In the throat of a stronger vocalist, this effect may have been tempered, but band maestro Dan Burton's voice has about as much scenic variation as his home state. The band whips up a fair amount of texture on some tunes-- ""McCalla"" is borderline creepy and taut like ""King of Pain""-era Police; the title track is filled out with evening-drone keyboards-- but even these starve to death in dire need of a crescendo or two. By the time the album closes out with a limp on ""Cotillion"", Early Day Miners sound like they're running out of batteries. Indiana fancies itself the Crossroads of America, presumably because of its central location both geographically and, er, culturally, but I've always personally interpreted the slogan to mean it's the kind of state you only pass through on the way to somewhere else. Jefferson at Rest projects the same sense of disposability, and while Secretly Canadian, with a solid stable of Great Plains poets like Jason Molina and June Panic, is doing a bang-up job of providing regional mystique for us Midwesterners jealous of that cred-loaded South, this release doesn't help the good cause much. Like Indiana itself, Jefferson at Rest might be comforting to a few, but it'll be flyover country to many more.","Every so often, a band perfectly encapsulates the natural environment in which they're based.

Nice Up the Dance,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e213d1975652139516/1:1/w_160/e34bf8e6.jpg,2003-05-29 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1988-nice-up-the-dance/,Soul Jazz,"The Soul Jazz label, in all its endeavors, is far more focused on the joint than the dancefloor-- not just in terms of ""joint"" being a single slice of beat brilliance, but also as a connective tissue between locales like New York, Jamaica, and London. The label showed that the nexus of early house, hip-hop, and post-punk lied in the Bronx with ESG, while last year's A Certain Ratio retrospective inexplicably linked Harlem percussion jams to Manchester's Hacienda club, and how 70s disco boogied into Jamaica on the Hustle! comp. This time around, they focus on a most peculiar connection between two genres-- American hip-hop and Jamaican dancehall-- proving them to be Siamese twins joined at the hip. The very bedrock of hip-hop-- DJs Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash-- are both of Jamaican descent, modeling their turntable set-ups on the soundclash sound systems of their youth. Run-DMC collaborated with albino toaster Yellowman years before pasty burnouts Aerosmith. Stars like Lauryn Hill and KRS-One base hits on dancehall staples. And now dancehall stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy are crossing over into Hot 97's pervasive mix. That the knee-jerk response to Shaggy's ""Gunshot"" is of crouching booty shakes is testament to the bass frequencies found here. Spraying a frantic flow over a bouncing beat shot through with Otis Redding samples, there's no trace of his later noxious hit ""It Wasn't Me"". Long-time staples of hip-hop DJ sets, Tenor Saw's ""Ring the Alarm"" and Dawn Penn's ""No No No"" are thankfully present, too, concisely showing the connections between the two island sounds. Kenny Dope (of Masters at Work) chops up A Tribe Called Quest for dancehall MC Screechy Dan and hip-hop producer J Live swirls an Augustus Pablo sample around a straight-ahead American head nod. While maintaining a studio shine, dancehall boasts elaborate double-jointed rhythms that drop in and out as the track plays, a change-up seldom found in most radio hits, plying different voices as the beats morph instead of looping a beat ad infinitum. The island patois and fierce flows show the most engaging aspect of dancehall is the vocal textures, be they croaking or nasally clean. The absolute mutant growl by Pompidoo on the primitive ""Synthesizer Voice"" (taking Biz Markie's ""Ah One Two"" tongue buzz to full bloom in '85) is odd as fuck-- after all, it shared a label with Mantronix and Arthur Russell back in the day. Jumping ahead twenty years, Ward 21 croaks in a flat flow that sounds like Timbaland's phoned-in baritone before it gets jacked by a more frantic and brash spit that's lies at the other extreme, cutting between the two throats expertly. The craziest joint, though, is the Missy-like bleep-bounce of Ms. Thing's ""Get That Money"", in which she raps over a digital dot-dash in vocode while men bark back: ""Ladies get that cash and 'ave fun/ Get your face and hair and nails done."" Even Dr. Dre's ""Next Episode"" makeover of David Axelrod gets a facial with equal aplomb from the UK's Singer Blue on ""If I Know Jah"". Not content to be a mere curatorial comp of dancehall or hip-hop, Nice Up the Dance transcends other genre-tasters with the ease in which it cuts between the two sides, noting all variants of the amalgamation. That every track also works for ""playing doctor"" on the dancefloor makes for a fine-ass corpus.","The Soul Jazz label, in all its endeavors, is far more focused on the joint than the dancefloor-- not just ...

Broken Girl,Julie Doiron,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9eb9d034d5c69bf5328/1:1/w_160/ee7de16d.jpg,2003-05-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2407-broken-girl/,Jagjaguwar,"Well. Here's Julie Doiron's rare and unreleased solo work from the Eric's Trip years. Huh. Dear Julie Doiron fanatics: in Julie Doiron's newly reissued 1996 debut Broken Girl, which combines her first-ever solo tracks from seven-inches and limited edition releases, you shall uncover a trove of early 90s, mostly acoustic, lo-fi dream-pop in the vein of Eric's Trip, but far sweeter, and far smooshier. Dear the rest of you: you will uncover a cache of lilting songs which resonate in their earnestness, but not much else, since you've heard approximately 3,298 musicians toting similar aesthetics to fanzine conventions across America since 1995-- starting and ending with The Softies. A germinate of Doiron's now-honeyed, loping alto is apparent on certain tracks, such as ""So Low"", but for the most part she was dotting her I's with little hearts and breathily overemphasizing the vowels, as every pop band was wont to do between 1993 and 1995. Hey, Twee Kitten, you're living all over me. Broken Girl is an odd release. Stylistically, it doesn't exactly stand the test of time: the material is nice enough, but it's lacking in profundity, or really anything beyond nicety. On ""Sorry Story"", Julie Doiron sings about unrequited love; on ""Five"" Julie Doiron plugs in the guitar and sings about being double-timed; on ""August 10"", Julie Doiron sings about messing up her relationship and apologizing about it. Julie, we are totally feeling you. For a woman whose latter-day catalogue is so much richer, prettier, and more intimate-- especially her excellent 1999 release with the Wooden Stars, Will You Still Love Me, which burned with an urgency still unseen in her other releases-- Broken Girl just seems like pangs of unwarranted nostalgia. Sure, you could say she had a hand in defining said acoustic twee-pop sound-- which she did, at least as much as the K Records battalion-- but only if the twee-pop sound had actually been broad-scoped and impacting enough to still matter all that much. It's sort of fun to listen to Broken Girl and be all, ""Wow, back then hardly anyone had the internet or ProTools and I spent all my money mail-ordering from Cher Doll Records"" or some shit, but unless you're a completist, get Will You Still Love Me instead. Julie Doiron fanatics, go to town. The rest of you, as you were.","Well.

"GoGoGo Airheart / Love My Life, Hate My Friends",GoGoGo Airheart,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf50c0084474cd0c3003/1:1/w_160/7bbe63bb.gif,2003-05-28 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3491-gogogo-airheart-love-my-life-hate-my-friends/,Vinyl Communications,"Two albums and six years are spent in relative obscurity, mixing sizzling rhythm with cold-sweat tension. Then ""art-punk"" gets the call-up for tomorrow's headlines, and Exitheuxa breaks GoGoGo Airheart so instantly and to such immense proportions you'd think they were from New York (and you'd almost be right). Meanwhile, all the band's loyal first-generation fans have to say to the flavor-of-the-month fashionistas is, ""What took you so long?"" because they already knew what the rest of the world is just figuring out now. To some bands, this ""dance"" thing is a ""movement""; to GoGoGo Airheart, it's just one of many genres that could be foisting them into the rock 'n' roll spotlight. It's a flavor like any other-- post-punk, electro, they even got some pop chops. Wait... did somebody say ""reissues""? Sure enough, Los Angeles' groundbreaking Gold Standard Laboratories label has answered the call, effectively offering a second chance to anyone who missed the band's 1997 self-titled debut or 1998 follow-up, Love My Life, Hate My Friends, during their brief run on Vinyl Communications. It's a move that bespeaks great conviction on the part of GSL to back this band-- and fortunately, it's warranted. Even though Airheart's debut feels a bit raw in comparison to their subsequent accomplishments, Love My Life still stands as their best work to date. More importantly, though, the scope of these two albums shows just how much ground the band can be expected to cover in the future: the San Diego boys covered a sick amount of ground on these two records, careening recklessly, but determinedly, through genres and styles. The hazy minimalism of their debut is light-years removed from the nervous grooves of last year's widely championed Exitheuxa, in spite of the fact that both ""November, November"" and ""Something Else"" found a place on both discs. But, due in part to the extraterrestrial engineering of ""noise terrorist"" Spacewurm, GoGoGo Airheart play up an icy, electronic emptiness broken intermittently by low-frequency transmissions from outside the solar system. Some of the intercepted signals are revelatory, like the ominous red alert threat of ""Community, Continuity, Insecurity"" or the smiling synthstrumental, ""Distance"", hinting at things to come; others, like the shambling tangle of assorted percussion on ""Elgin Marbles"", should have been jammed outright. Elsewhere, the static hiss and vibe of ""Untitled"", ""Positions Are Not Popular"", and especially the near-nonexistent ""Chemistry in the U.S.A."" serve no Earthly purpose apart from interference-- at best, they marginally enhance the album's cohesion by contributing to its wholesale disjointedness. From an album standpoint, GSL's decision to remove four cuts from the original tracklist (they inexplicably kept the terrible filth of ""Holiday"") makes it a marked improvement on the Vinyl Communications edition, but even so-- and despite its occasional inspiring peaks-- the only thing holding GoGoGo Airheart together is nerve, and even that doesn't always do the trick. In retrospect, GoGoGo Airheart seems just a test; by Love My Life, they're a tight-knit, fully operational unit with a feel for their boundaries and actual vision. The brutal swagger of ""No Language Before Its Time"" fades in from the distance, setting the prevailing tone early on: one of vague, indiscernible malice. The shallow rush of the snares and pulsing bass collide with shrieking-yet-restrained guitar lines, leaving behind nothing but jittery paranoia. And as it turns out, that's the mood that dominates the proceedings here-- but just to show they've got other tricks up their sleeve, Airheart transition directly into breezy alt-country, care of ""First Among Equals"". It's a little abrupt, certainly, but this isn't the reticent toe-dipping of their debut; they're ready to shit their pants, dive in, and swim. Every disparate musical aspect is tackled full-force and expertly assimilated. Again, it's not all perfect, but the resultant sweep and urgency of Love My Life is humbling and, at times, fearsome. For every sinister assault on Love My Life, Hate My Friends-- from the clear inspiration ""Congratulations"" gleans from Peter Hook's Joy Division bass, to ""SP3""'s scrambled synthetics-- there's always a release from the tension. Songs like ""Rebirth"" and ""How I Feel Tired"" are necessary respites, if only to momentarily alleviate the pressure, and consequently stand out as among the album's strongest offerings. It's the final catharsis, though, that's also the finest: for all of the nail-biting build-up on the rest of Love My Life, ""Ever Since I Was Young"" is the gloriously anticlimactic denouement. The desperate pace finally gives way to a somber, aching farewell, instantly recalling the bittersweet closure of Radiohead's ""Life in a Glasshouse"". Beyond the overt similarity of tone, the total emotional drain produced by the preceding tracks leaves the listener hollowed-out, and both of these songs seize on the only thing that's left: resignation. On this final note, with so much already behind them, all that's left is where they're going. Neither GoGoGo Airheart's self-titled debut or Love My Life, Hate My Friends is quite as simultaneously balanced and diverse as Exitheuxa, but they don't duplicate it much, either. Rather, these records demonstrate the true depth of the band, expanding even further on what they're capable of, to the point that nearly anything seems possible.

"Ikebana: Merzbow's 'Amlux' Rebuilt, Reused and Recycled",Merzbow,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c446ea9e61561daa80f4/1:1/w_160/96acad8d.gif,2003-05-28 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5246-ikebana-merzbows-amlux-rebuilt-reused-and-recycled/,Important,"Source material for a remix can be like salt in a cake mix: technically speaking, one has to have the first in order to construct the second, but the fun lies in the way you hide its taste, and I would argue that a ""faithful remix"" (or a salty cake) defeats the point. So, chefs, DJs and other people who like to make messes have run amok over the past couple of decades turning what might have been nothing more than small, lifeless pea into Haydn's Creation. Many times, this transformation is done for practical reasons-- say, extending a groove for the dancefloor, or adding a little punch for the radio-- though I've always been more interested in the mixture made for reasons purely ""artistic,"" culinary or otherwise. Over time, this recreation-- probably a notch removed from a ""remix,"" if only because the most interesting stuff involves more than just editing and jacking with levels-- has evolved from fringe experiment to full-grown musical cuisine. Early musique concrete pioneers Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry might have envisioned a world where everyday sound or radio broadcasts might be turned into avant-garde art via sampling and electronic amplification, but I doubt they could have foreseen the po-mo hurricane that is modern sound design: Otomo Yoshihide uses his ""group"" Ground Zero to ""remix"" UK experimentalists Cassiber's live record; Christian Marclay cuts up Elliot Sharp's guitar in real time and nobody comes out unscathed; John Oswald forges massive documents of alien sound out of music already heard by anyone with ears; Ekkehard Ehlers, Fennesz and Keith Whitman play their own stuff, cycle it through a laptop, and produce sounds at once familiar and of singular idiosyncrasy. Nothing is sacred. Or, music is god, and cannibals make the best sacrifices. Merzbow's 2002 release Amlux is the main course for better than twenty very hungry young dicers on Ikebana's meta-menu. According to the liners, artists were supposed to use the original album's music as an element in a new composition, rather than piece together a traditional remix. Furthermore, despite Masami Akita's rep as devastating noise dominatrix, none of the new tunes were to be necessarily bound to his extreme aesthetic. I can imagine the participants feeling either fantastic glee at the prospect of being given free rein in the Merzbow shop, or a bit of paranoia at approaching the same material as twenty other artists and having to come up with something just as interesting. The coolest thing about Ikebana is that you don't even really need to know anything about Merzbow or ""noise"" to listen to it. There are a few u nruly moments that seem pages out of some forgotten cassette-only Masami Akita (Merzbow) release, but in general, much of this release could pass for an experimental IDM sampler. Alec Empire's raging ""Digital Hardcore Mix"" comes on like the soundtrack to a Terminator sequel that didn't suck, with wildly distorted drum tracks kicking the shit out of all the extraneous debris (hint: tonality = debris) in their way. With a decent stereo, the bassline could do some serious damage. Similarly, Luke Vibert's (performing under his Plug alias) excellent untitled futuro drum-n-bass slaps an engorged, fuzzy repeating synth bass under jagged glitch stutter beat. Some of the tempo changes and oddly timed samples remind me of the more spastic moments on Hrvatski's first record-- or possibly of the record I wish Squarepusher would make. Elsewhere, artists you might think would provide the electro-splice goods deliver something else entirely. Mouse on Mars' ""Superstar"" features no beats whatsoever, and in truth, sounds almost exactly like a Merzbow original, albeit a piece wherein he doesn't so much opt for deafening displays of violent florescence as disorientating sound design. Cornelius' untitled piece starts out innocently enough, with sampled jungle birds and rain, but gradually mutates into the pitter-patter of static electricity and industrial clang. Nobukazu Takemura's ""Assembler Mix"" takes the static idea and gallops with it, giving you hundreds of variations on the same grating implosion for what seems an eternity. Now that's entertainment! However, it's also pretty reverential, and in scheme of Ikebana seems kind of quaint. For reference, see Makoto Kawabata's amazing/nauseating ""Revolved Jane"", which shows you don't have to bother living up to a legacy if you're perfectly capable of vandalizing it with a chorus of grotesque psych-locusts. Ikebana isn't exactly the smoothest listen, and not just because it comes from Merzbow music. DJ Spooky's trip-hop treatment doesn't really sound like it belongs on the same album as the MoM or Takemura tracks, and Negativland's highly annoying ""An Actual Attack"" doesn't sound like anything I need in my collection at all. Still, as samplers go, it's consistently ""challenging""-- or better yet, there lots of sounds you'll want to come back to after being assaulted the first time. And you want to know a secret? I never heard the original Amlux music, and can vouch for this stuff working well enough on its own. So, sit down, fork in place, and dig in-- you like buffet, right?","Source material for a remix can be like salt in a cake mix: technically speaking, one has to have the ...

Keep It Simple,Hackensaw Boys,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c03613d197565213b9ef/1:1/w_160/3e75ba69.jpg,2003-05-28 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3699-keep-it-simple/,Hackensaw Boys,"As long as kids are pummeling pots in basements and snatching vintage amps from Goodwill, there will be musical genres that challenge, if not completely subvert, all acceptable notions of aural pleasure. Even bluegrass was one back in the day, and though the lifestyle surrounding it isn't as instantly seditious as mohawk-and-safety-pin-circa-'77, the music itself is just as belligerent-- particularly when it's taken out of its historically benign porch-and-moonshine context. Fiercely cacophonous, often percussionless, and defiantly lurching toward a flurried, volatile climax, proper bluegrass is hardly the most palatable stuff. Sam Bush may be more badass than he gets credit for. Think of the overall sporting, wheat-chewing jugbands of 1910s and 20s, who acted with a certain degree of self-awareness, amping up the hillbilly wackiness with novelty songs about donkeys and/or whiskey. Before Bill Monroe came along, shit was all gimmick and goof; in the 1940s, Monroe put on a suit and sped it up, pushing the vocals higher and higher and parsing in jazz solos and bouts of improvisation. For better or worse, things kept evolving, and now, over fifty years later, hundreds of ""newgrass"" bands have dragged the genre (at present, significantly, painfully watered down) onto woodsy college campuses, lighting up big, fat joints all across America. Thankfully, Charlottesville, Virginia's Hackensaw Boys have defiantly eschewed the lazy, neo-hippy circuit in favor of staying freakishly traditional and, incidentally, also opening for bands like Modest Mouse (or joining 2002's Unlimited Sunshine tour, alongside The Flaming Lips and Cake, after John McCrea specifically extended an invite). These are startlingly indie twists for a band with eight members (four of whom play banjo; one of whom is named Pee Paw, another Skeeter, and another The Kooky-Eyed Fox), no drummer, and a penchant for fiddles. But the Hacks have always been a curious outfit. With origins that effectively pre-date the Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk revolution spawned by 2000's aptly titled O Brother soundtrack, The Hackensaw Boys are surprisingly well-steeped in the picked, howled traditions of the American south, and their second self-released record, Keep It Simple, is packed with vigorous, pitchy bursts. Keep It Simple doesn't perfectly reflect the band's fast-and-fierce live show, but it offers a solid glimpse of their proclivity for catchy melodies, classic harmonizing, and stringy noodling. Somehow, the band infuses their grassy tornado with brazen punk attitude and catchy pop structure, while simultaneously remaining vehemently sincere; tracks like ""Dance Around"" feature prototypically bluegrassian lyrics (""Dancin' with the girls/ That's a mighty fine thing/ You ain't gotta buy no wedding ring"") without mocking the traditions from which they came. If you're of the jaded sort, this kind of anti-irony can be a little jarring. The first time I heard The Hackensaw Boys strum up their flurried mess of scrappy, eight-man bluegrass, I was just off a plane from New York City, tired and twitchy, curled fetal into the grubby, wooden floorboards of Charlottesville's Starr Hill Music Hall, pitifully slurping a cold pale ale. Eventually, The Hackensaw Boys puttered onstage, smirking and vaguely feral, crowding three tall microphones and forming a tight, acoustic cluster of reeling fiddles, banjos, guitars, harmonica, accordion, washboard, upright bass, charismo, dobro, and mandolin. My own cranky posturing aside, I dug the display: a noisy army of quick strings and wide, clever eyes spinning their own (slightly bizarre) brand of thick mountain music, with manic, nasal vocals and rowdy instrumentation. The Hackensaw Boys are all fairly young, and the sounds they make-- wild, boisterous, merry-- are so unexpectedly raw, so intensely traditional and sincere, that it inevitably takes a few minutes to acclimate. By the time I'd stopped staring blankly, I realized I was fully and completely interested. These boys were singing things like, ""Oh my goodness/ Oh my God/ Oh my Ruby Pearl!"" and not giving a shit about whether people thought it was funny or outmoded or awkwardly abrasive. Fucking punk rock. It turns out that most people in Charlottesville can offer up their own version of a Hackensaw story, and it almost invariably includes a handful of extraneous, contextual details: a grassy field, a purple mountain, eight kegs of beer, a 1964 GMC touring coach, the Blue Moon Diner and a hot platter of buttery flapjacks. There's something intensely anachronistic about The Hackensaw Boys that, even within the over-examined paradigm of American roots music, seems to force people to acknowledge their surroundings and carefully consider the contrast. And that kind of examination is rarely a bad thing.","As long as kids are pummeling pots in basements and snatching vintage amps from Goodwill, there will be musical genres ...

The Howling Hex,Neil Michael Hagerty,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c03cea9e61561daa7ba9/1:1/w_160/b15d6690.gif,2003-05-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3703-the-howling-hex/,Drag City,"Of all the obvious potshots one might be tempted to take at Neil Hagerty, he's got at least one thing going for him: a sense of determination so stubborn, it puts the ""pathetic"" in ""apathetic"". After my esteemed colleague Mark Richardson essentially wrote the man's career epitaph over the course of reviewing his first two solo outings, the former king of the Royal Trux monarchy shows that he can not only stick to a record-a-year release schedule, but that he also doesn't give much of a fuck about what anybody thinks of his inability to deliver a cohesive statement. Physical Graffiti fans take note: like Neil Michael Hagerty and Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll, Hagerty's latest disc is all over the stylistic map, even upping the ante by sprawling out to the length of a double-LP. But where those previous records couldn't really offer much in the way of a good song, The Howling Hex is surprisingly chock-full of 'em. And believe it or not, this record succeeds where its predecessors failed so miserably: actually drawing the listener in with nearly an entire side's worth of straightforward, well-written tunes before veering off into the usual inconsistency. ""Firebase Ripcord"", the first of several blue-eyed boogie numbers recorded in Chicago with a full band and minimal overdubs, finds Hagerty in a Phil Lynott state of mind as he offers a gravelly confession of nothing in particular. From there it's off to what could be an awfully contagious outtake from Accelerator (""Out of Reach""), a sloppy soul tune that's also about nothing in particular (""Watching the Sands""), and a fragile acoustic folk ballad (""Gray"")-- all of which are equal parts concise and engaging. The end of the equivalent to LP side one is the disc's turning point, where people are either going to succumb to its schizophrenia or depart without a backward glance. ""Rockslide"" is one of two (well, three if you count the studio-enhanced ""Energy Plan"") live recordings from some March 2002 shows that showcase Hagerty's mercurial guitar freakout mode, aided by Tim Barnes' tribal propulsion and Dan Brown's liquid bass. These drastic rearrangements of songs from the previous solo records are far beyond the semi-organized chaos that reigns elsewhere on this one, basically coming back to what we've been saying all along-- if you enjoy the sound of Hagerty finding his inner Joe Walsh (James Gang-era, that is), there's a lot to love; if not, well, you know where the skip button is. Shifts in polarity aside, the first half of The Howling Hex is still quite outstanding-- with or without the lazy tape composition piece ""Clermont Heights""-- begging the question of whether this might've been best left at a single LP's length. Because once side three hits, it's straight downhill with few exceptions: other than a shitkicking preamble to the closing ""Energy Plan"" (""AEP1"") and a couple of similarly minded acoustic tunes, there's really not much worth going back to. As active as he's been since the Royal Trux ""hiatus"" or ""breakup"" or whatever-- three solo records in addition to the Weird War and Drag City Supersession projects-- it's starting to look as if Hagerty's a bit lost without Jennifer Herrema's yin/yang of intolerability and tragic brilliance. But as long as his former partner remains MIA, it seems we have to take what we can get, along with all the lapses into mediocrity that entails.","Of all the obvious potshots one might be tempted to take at Neil Hagerty, he's got at least one ...

Zongamin,Zongamin,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab35b1335d7bf16997d4/1:1/w_160/0d8f2fcc.jpg,2003-05-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8933-zongamin/,XL,"I crawled into my faded, cornflower blue leisure suit (the one with ""1977"" scrawled in peeling electrical tape on the back) and made my way to the latest most-hyped club my town had to offer: Club Zongamin. My friends Tigersushi and BB Couk had tipped me off, saying that the place was giving the world something to dance to unlike anything heard since Arthur Russell's notorious Dinosaur L creations in the early 80s-- back when disco and dance were becoming the new punk. The wait to get in was long; I had nothing better to do than listen to the odd sounds emanating from the open doors. Some girl wearing pink Saran wrap and a belt-buckle with Elvis Presley's face on it mentioned how much she liked the track that was currently playing, ""Make Love Not War"". She was in the process of telling me how she appreciated it a lot more than the original Arrows version, when the music abruptly halted, cutting short the Dick Dale-influenced guitar and Morricone-styled choral arrangements. Suddenly, the DJ switched to a more direct dance beat led by a fuzzy bass and hi-hat. The guy behind me sporting a faux-hawk and twinkle in his eye was attempting to make time with the girl to my left, who was hardly impressed by his knowledge of the track-- ""Serious Trouble""-- and how he had the original ""twelve"" long before 2 Many DJs dropped it on their As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2 mix a year earlier. Finally inside the club, I boogied my way to the middle of the dancefloor just as the club owner, Susumu Mukai, halted the melee momentarily to allow house turntablist J33\xBD to set up his deck. Mukai announced the arrival of ""Street Surgery 2"" with the atonal manipulation of his fabricated bass, which slowly evolved into an awkward-yet-interesting, Indian-inspired backwards phrase before juxtaposing with a lower register polka-dance bassline. All of this inevitably fell upon the cutting room floor, as J33\xBD interjected breaks between notes of the main melody for the remainder of the song. Other tracks held my attention throughout the course of the night-- the swirling ecstasy-fueled atmosphere of ""Spiral"", the Esquivel-esque bachelor-pad-music of ""J. Shivers Theme"" (complete with whistling), and the alternately funky/frightening ""Tunnel Music""-- but in time the scene ended, and I made my way back to my apartment, exhausted and badly in need of a shower. When I awoke the next morning, groggy (and, yes, smelly), I had the acute sensation of buyer's remorse. Suddenly, with the perspective of a new day, I remembered moments from the previous night's mix that had mercifully been ignored at the time. The weak industrial experimentation of ""Double Dostiev"" was a slap in the face to every kid that had been at the club sporting their Throbbing Gristle t-shirt, and the grossly suspenseful ""Mummies"", with its repeating four notes and distant horror-show ""thuds"", led to nothing more than the abrupt flood of the house lights signaling everyone to leave-- a severe disappointment in what was otherwise a potentially strong track. The remainder of the experience was inexplicably tinged with the dark odor of commercial viability. Tracks such as ""Whiplash"" and ""Trespasser"" would sound better, perhaps, were it not for the distinct future-sound of Nissans and Hondas whisking across isolated mountain roads, fields of fog, and humorous common life situations. Despite these misgivings, though, I wouldn't ask for a refund on the experience. The club showed a lot of potential that evening, and though it's a fair criticism to say the music functioned more as a collection of singles than as a cohesive mix, there's still some merit there. The next time I get that certain urge to strut, I'll make my way back to those pyramid-shaped black-and-white doors and slip into the groove, because, while it's doubtful I'll want to visit every night, it would be blatantly dishonest to say I'd never return to Zongamin.","I crawled into my faded, cornflower blue leisure suit (the one with ""1977"" scrawled in peeling electrical\n\ tape on ...

See, every ""cool"" person I ever knew during my formative years was partially subsidized by their siblings: the younger sibling strove toward trendiness to act as a role model to the following generation, while the older sibling had the less proactive role of wisely plundering the influences behind the younger kids' record collections and recommending similar-- and often better-- bands. Being an only child, though, I had to wait until I was well into my teens to start uncovering music that got my motor purring, and even then it felt like an arduously slow and expensive habit to maintain. Added to this late-to-the-game-shame was the deplorable fact that most of the bands I discovered for myself had broken up by the time I got around to hearing them, shattering my hopes of ever experiencing the full spectrum of their music in a live setting. Yep, it's too late for me, but us Pitchforkers would like to think we're preventing this from happening to other kids out there. So let me just say that Wetheads Come Running is momentous. Absorbing a large index of musical inspirations, Austin, Texas-based newcomers Single Frame blaze through 20 songs in a scant 37 minutes, their countless influences congealing and materializing as short, clipped pop songs that stick around only as long as their hooks can remain fresh. This thing is packed with potential summer college radio hits-- ""Comm. Jet (Creepykid Remix)"" is chief among them, with its pronounced and cooing vocals blending Modest Mouse-style vocal timing with a bargain-basement synth and a fistpumping, anthemic chorus replete with nonsense lyrics so passionate they nearly convince you they mean something. ""Eavesdropper Goes Solo"" slows down the tempo for a quiet march that, augmented by clacky, reverbed percussion, continually builds to fake-out climaxes before dropping back down to its impossibly catchy chorus, relating to the angst-ridden introvert with such lines as, ""The fact of the matter is/ I'm always behind/ The fact is/ I'm always out of place/ In my own skin/ With my own friends."" Though certainly not as poignant as Sly & The Family Stone's ""Skin I'm In"", Single Frame make their point just as sincerely, and with a melody no less vital. Meanwhile, ""Mod Style '68""-- quite probably doomed to be known as ""the Fugazi song""-- has the group saluting D.C. with a joyous, geek-hardcore riot over a loping beat with harsh and rapid vocal delivery. Above the sing-song chorus, two voices call-and-respond in what sounds like a guest spot from Ian and Guy themselves, before the near-bubblegum refrain is roped in by the harder edge of the guitars and synthesizers. Other tracks borrow heavily from the aftermath of the Electronic Poem, resulting in a large amount of found sound constituents, established mainly in interludes such as ""Rare Paintings"", ""In the Ground"" (which electronically modulates a female voice to an operatic effect), and to some extent on ""Post Daydream Forecast Endeavor"", one of Wetheads' clear standouts. One of the album's only tracks to build brief interludes into the song itself, ""Post Daydream Forecast Endeavor"" works primarily because the band has a good sense of balance: the accompaniment co-opts elements of the post-punk tradition and incorporates strongly syncopated swing-percussion that's cut only intermittently by a keyboard drone and a buzzsaw guitar-- and it's all an elaborate accent for a hook so perfectly simple you might wonder how it's escaped 50 years of pop songs without having ever been used. Better still: on top of all this early achievement, Single Frame possess that one characteristic so rare amongst the all-too-common indie sophomore slumps: even greater potential. That the trio is already this attuned to one another's musical instincts is pretty impressive, but the slightly undercooked sound of a couple of these tracks (""I've Been to a Party at This House"", ""3 Bloodless Shadows"") give the impression that, with another year or two under their belts, they could easily develop into one of indie music's frontrunners. With this in mind, it's imperative that this band's music be brought to anyone and everyone that has an ear for it-- which is why I wholeheartedly suggest that, during your next beer-and-cigarette trip to the local secondary school (pervert), you bring a copy of Wetheads not just for your kinsfolk, but for the chubby antisocial kid, too. Maybe that person won't need something like Cobain's drugged rants about Flipper, The Raincoats, and The Vaselines ten years after the fact to develop his or her own musical aesthete.","My mother knotted her ovarian tubes when I was five years old, barring any chance I might have at one ...

Zoo Psychology,Ex Models,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc7eb335119a49ecd42/1:1/w_160/f6d6e8ed.jpg,2003-05-27 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2864-zoo-psychology/,Frenchkiss,"On Zoo Psychology, Ex Models chose to title one of their songs ""Hott 4 Discourse"". Like many of their songs, it's an attention-deficient, disjointed, yelpy plate of noise with guitars popping out all around like switchblades, erections, or eyeballs. Both title and song illustrate the NYC quartet's insatiable hunger for straight-up, gunky rock 'n' roll sex appeal, tempered by straight-up, gunky academic interchange. It's not a mild pairing, but Ex Models are panting for the bombast, hold the fancy mannerisms, thanks. This spastic steez goes for the throat of French post-structuralist theory, then tries to stick in a wayward tongue. Really. What else did you think ""Ex Models"" meant? Since Other Mathematics, their 2001 Ace Fu debut, the band has not only dumped a bassist (Mike Masiello was replaced by The Seconds' Zach Lehrhoff) but mostly left their art-funk sound behind, too, allowing their new record to shiver and sweat in its own ragged chunks of jittery riffs and self-mocking, flesh-searing staccato vocals. Too clever to be speared with the ""no wave"" dart, but too abrasive and irreverent to land under any other umbrella, Zoo Psychology is something like a highly developed version of what's currently happening in the Midwest noize scene, plus the ghost of Oingo Boingo. It swims in complex musical ideas, which are in turn presented skeletally enough that, for the most part, you can even actually figure out what the fuck is going on. That is, assuming you have the ability to stop time. A full fifteen songs play out in a mere thirty minutes, and Zoo Psychology's refrains are faster, shorter, and more efficient than ever. Edge-of-yr-seat time signatures spark into dizzying guitar bombs, occasionally giving way to a few short, grating jams and highly tense, 30-second drum bashings. Ex Models' world is always on the verge of stepping on a mine-- even their girlish vocal mannerisms (e.g. the fanciful cooing falsettos of Lehrhoff and guitarist/singer Shahin Motia) can't tempt this apocalypse party into a midnight cocktail. On ""Zoo Love"", the boys sass in unison like they think they're junior high cheerleaders/50s R&B; singers doing time in the National Guard as the instruments grind out a simple but bratty little strut. I have no idea what the lyrics are, because they're sung with appropriately sloppy, mushy mouths and: THERE IS NO ACCOMPANYING LYRIC SHEET!, though I could make out the phrases ""funky and twist"" and ""noise if it gets too loud,"" which both seem to be the illustrative fragments of the band's musical thesis, however subconscious. Did you ever see Bela Tarr's brilliant film The Werckmeister Harmonies, which was (generally) about the peace and clarity possible after the total destruction of everything? Yeah, well, this is sorta like that. Ex Models are only happy after all pretense of calm has been shattered, bashed, kicked in, crumbled, and twisted 'round their heads like a helicopter. They sound like they're vandalizing something, or about to, or just building up the courage to go balls-to-the-wall loco. That this band can be utterly in sync and on the pants-peeing edge at once, plus presenting entire philosophical and mathematical principles under the guise of sexually charged, aggressive post-punk, while still having enough humor to title their problems ""Hey Boner"" and ""Brand New Panties"" is the answer to a question only Guy Debord could present. Tres incroyable.","On Zoo Psychology, Ex Models chose to title one of their songs ""Hott 4 Discourse"". Like many of their songs ...

Now,Stark Reality,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63113d1975652139117/1:1/w_160/d2693548.jpg,2003-05-26 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7700-now/,AJP,"Do you remember all that weird stuff public television tried to slip past us when we were kids? It's not enough that their most popular program featured huge, fluorescent birds and other unidentified animals (what the hell was Cookie Monster? Oscar the Grouch? Grover!?), it was created by a man whose greatest claim to fame before the show was a documentary about what it was like traveling through his brain while he meditated. And what about all those weird songs: that chaotic one with the counting and the chef always falling down the steps that always sounded like they had recorded it too loud and was really distorted, or the one with the psychedelic pinball machine, and that way-out-there funky fusion vocal shit (that I later learned was penned by Herbie Hancock, and sung by the fucking Pointer Sisters). I suppose the producers at PBS and its affiliate networks like Boston's WGBH were reaching a tad far in those days, but to their credit, it's hard to imagine a world where their colorful, 60s-informed visions of a new education didn't exist. In 1969, jazz vibraphonist Monty Stark was working as a bandleader and arranger for WGBH's Say Brother program when he received a request from one Hoagy Bix Carmichael, son of legendary American songwriter, Hoagy Carmichael (""Star Dust"", ""Georgia On My Mind""). Bix was keen to produce a children's show wherein his father's music would receive a facelift for a new generation of kids, and in the process, learn the little-uns some music education. Stark's quartet, Stark Reality, had been working on Say Brother, and though they probably weren't terribly familiar with Carmichael's old-time pop, were pretty keen to give it their own flavor. So, their own flavor: jazzy funk beats, fuzz guitar, wandering, restless bass and some of the most distorted vibes this side of, well, anywhere. Stark Reality made proto acid-jazz and psych-funk out of the tunes, and though it was supposed to bring the music closer to something children in 1970 could dig, I can only imagine what they might have thought. I mean, unless these kids were hip to the Soft Machine and Headhunters, they'd probably have preferred something less out there. Stones Throw's reissue of Now includes all of the Carmichael songs, as well as a few Stark originals, though the less said about most of those, the better. Stark's band works up a groove pretty well, and he's an interesting player (even when that distorto-vibe gag wears thin after a few tunes), but I could probably have done without hearing him sing for the rest of my life. Oddly, Stark's raw, Oklahoma monotone croon only seems to veer off key and into the beyond on his original songs, because the covers sound mostly OK-- all in all, a good reason to appreciate the mastery of Hoagy Carmichael's melodies. ""Junkman's Song"" comes on like the mutated pairing of War's ""Cisco Kid"" and ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"". The band hammers the beat with patented Hendrix-style guitar chords, but on vibes, and Abercrombie's vintage six-string sear adds just the right amount of haze to what might otherwise lapse into cocktail lounge fuzak. The sing-song melody sounds a little disorienting over this treble-heavy brew of dirty jazz-rock, but that's probably the most interesting thing about the piece. In fact, throughout the album I wish Stark Reality had spent more time on the song proper, rather than taking off into cosmic improv jams so often. ""Thirty Days Hath September"" has another great melody, but you have to wade through a few minutes of grade-A noodling to get to it-- and once Stark gets through, they launch another marathon, meandering solo session. I'm all for musical exploration, but this kind of flat-footed jamming gets pretty boring after a while. ""Cooking"" gets it right, apparently by loosing the solo sections almost entirely. The slinky groove, powered by super dissonant vibe harmonies, and vintage wah-wah gives way to Stark's ominous rendition of the original Carmichael melody. Again, the intro to the tune is about twice as long as the tune itself, but thankfully, the payoff comes relatively shortly, and the groove is worth the wait. ""All You Need to Make Music"" finds the band teaching the world about flats, naturals and half-rests-- but is actually a pretty good funk tune. Vinnie Johnson's tight drumming holds together a clever arrangement wherein the band plays off of Stark's lyrics detailing various aspects of musical notation. Anyway, the important thing is that the rather theoretical nature of the piece steers the band away from their more unhinged tendencies. Stones Throw have dropped a few gems in my lap over the years, but in this case, I wonder if the funk really is its own reward. The best moments on Now are reminiscent of other artists mentioned above, but the worst are basically unlistenable (I'm serious, play ""Too Much Tenderness"" at your own risk). All the sounds in between are by-the-numbers jazz quartet funk, post-boogaloo, pre- the DJ culture that would mine their beats for loops. I reckon 75% of this CD occupies that middle ground, so if a few fleeting moments of fuzzy glory sound good to you, have at it. Hopefully, the kids will be all right.","Do you remember all that weird stuff public television tried to slip past us when we were kids? It's ...

Please Believe It,The Party of Helicopters,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a006c0084474cd0bfa73/1:1/w_160/baf0ec5c.gif,2003-05-26 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6186-please-believe-it/,Velocette,"Raising the headphones to my skull for my first listen to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, I was struck by the taste of a heavy mousse or a rich pastry: I discovered the capacity of directed sound to inform an otherwise disconnected gustatory sensation. I searched out other experiences, finding that classical music whets my appetite for small portions of vegetable dishes and rare Japanese cuisine served on an asymmetrical jade plate. Jazz makes my mouth dry with the odor of cigarettes and a hard drink. Rock 'n' roll-- and nearly all of its substituents-- leaves an aftertaste of mostly carnal delights; a bleeding porterhouse, or at times a more elegant filet, wrapped in bacon and topped with horseradish sauce. There are notable exceptions to these corporal delicacies though, as rock 'n' roll has also given birth to the bubblegum-and-marshmallow-flavored emo-core scene, the Spam-laden rock/punk-revival and the saltwater taffy of electro/electro pop. Counted among its differing offspring of rock is shoegaze, a sub-genre from which nearly any composition lends itself directly to savory desserts-- small portions of dense pleasure that are lovely in moderation, but can be more than slightly off-putting if consumed in mass quantities. Loveless, the Pitchfork-endorsed exemplar shoegazer album, serves as the crème brule-- the mark by which all others should be measured. This leads to a problem: the watermark of excellence having been set, the only thing left for its musical legacy is the tweaking of the established order in hopes of arriving at something new, if not necessarily better. This has led to all manner of ghastly cuisine, but occasionally it yields something palatable. Initially, the thought of joining shoegaze and heavy metal-- a la Black Sabbath and Judas Priest-- is as off-putting an idea as combining dark chocolate and sweetbread, but the Party of Helicopters nearly prove otherwise on their aptly titled Please Believe It. Flexing hard riffs over a constant wall of feedback, Jamie Stillman leads his troupe through the album in a manner befitting the former drummer of post-hardcore group Harriet the Spy: upgrading that group's sound with vocalist Joe Dennis' roots in the shoegazer outfit The Man I Fell in Love With, Party of Helicopters push forward to pull off an amalgamation yielding some memorable tracks. Sounding like an early-Shudder to Think, ""The Good Punk"" delivers layered falsetto choruses atop a fuzzed-out bass and pummeling percussion. The song spans a progressive length of over six minutes, providing chromatic runs and time signature switch-ups that serve to highlight the irony of the line, ""this ain't punk rock enough for my ears."" Further down the Craig Wedren and Nathan Larson ladder, ""The Toucher"" builds on a catchy hook that tightens and releases like a kinetic block-on-a-spring, over a distant hum and trite lyrics regarding a love triangle between a moustache, a little brother, and a loved one. The heavy string-work of Hum is later apparent, on ""Cover Me"" and ""Science Reasons"", as are the stop/start, dense variations of Polvo, which rise on ""Rising Up Is Hard Work (Let's Just Sit Here)"". PoH wade into the dance-friendly waters of a swinging Dismemberment Plan with ""Delta '88"", and to a lesser extent the frantic bass of No Kill No Beep Beep-era Q and Not U on ""Never Ending Cycle"", which also features acoustic elements buried in the mix, giving the song an enjoyable organic base. Unfortunately-- despite a handful of soundalike respites-- the music tends towards an equilibrium that doesn't entertain beyond the initial shock of its conjoined parts. Like most Epicurean experiments, novelty soon fades away to reveal that, from the beginning, the varying musical concepts were tacked onto a weaker-than-anticipated structure. Like sausage steeped in syrup and served up warm with French toast, Please Believe It sounds like a good idea at first but the thought of having it every day-- or even every week-- makes my stomach quiver. Another marriage of frayed guitar layering and weighty riffs is marred by its own overwrought fusion, a dish whose varied and potent flavors never resolve, spoiling what could have turned out a fine meal had it been prepared by chefs less eager to impress.","Raising the headphones to my skull for my first listen to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, I was struck by ...

Precollection,Lilys,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd16eb335119a49ecddc/1:1/w_160/e8d4ff96.jpg,2003-05-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4798-precollection/,Manifesto,"Within every contemporary record reviewer lies the knee-jerk critical impulse to articulate and describe via contextualization: to frantically establish a massive, webby paradigm of music past, present, and future, and then to neatly (and accurately) place each CD sitting in his/her respective stack within that ridiculous, elaborate map. Here's the thing: most of the time, the Lilys sound an awful lot like the late-60s, mod-rocking Kinks. Frontman Kurt Heasley has channeled Ray Davies so expertly that it's impossible not to half-expect the guy to bust out ""Lola"" every time a new track opens. Heasley sings with a distinctly fey Brit clip, despite hailing from less-than-Cockney Philadelphia, and he and 1969-Davies even sport the same suit and haircut. Self-parody? Blind idol worship? Preemptively striking at critics? There are a handful of other folk-pop-psychedelic influences (from the Beatles to My Bloody Valentine to The Apples in Stereo) evident in the Lilys' electro-acoustic buzz, although, ultimately, context proves stoically unimportant. The Lilys' slot in the ever-growing matrix of recorded music is, happily, very much their own, and Precollection, the band's eighth full-length, is far from being blatantly derivative or embarrassingly footnoted. For the most part, the Lilys' melodic strumming and driving percussion is addictively palatable and, occasionally, surprisingly innovative. Heasley is the sound-defining double helix of the Lilys, and the peripheral players rotate from album to album, almost incidentally. Precollection sees Heasley drawing from his own varied discography nearly as extensively as he draws from his record collection, and many of the tracks here reflect and refine past experiments, now imbued with a new sense of coherency and artistic vision. ""Perception Room"" weds Heasley's early-90s fascination with meandering, shoegazing space rock to his poppier sensibilities, and the result is dark, rhythm-heavy, and shiftily melodic, a song that would have been startlingly comfortable on late-80s college rock radio, alongside cuts by R.E.M. and the Church. ""Meditations on Speed"" is a muscular tangle of acoustic strums and electric fuzz, quiet, occasionally inaudible vocals (Heasley sheds his Davies skin when he hops into higher registers, but the resulting whine can be difficult to discern over this track's throb-throb bass) and merry, driving organ. Like almost every song on Precollection, ""Meditations"" is held together by an incessant, uncompromising rhythmic assault; there very few holes, gaps, or pauses for breath. Silence plays a minimal role (at best) and if these songs had been less skillfully assembled, they might seem impenetrably thick. But Heasley's grown into an expert songsmith, and although not all of Precollection's ten tracks are wholly distinct, each does offer something unique for your time: an unexpected drumbeat, a lone guitar wail, an oddly timed burst of vocals. Precollection's title track (and opener) sees Heasley suggesting, convincingly, to ""become what you are."" It's an especially apt new beginning for a musician finally working out his ambitions and channeling them into something both resonant and entirely coherent. Achieved nearly ten years after the band's inception, this is a bright start for Heasley's Lilys.","Within every contemporary record reviewer lies the knee-jerk critical impulse to articulate and describe via contextualization: to frantically establish a ...

Our rivalry to the death is going okay, thanks; we're currently interviewing contractors to construct us a Thunderdome. It started, predictably, with him throwing a Twinkie at my face during an argument about Xiu Xiu. My platelets were particularly low that afternoon, and my lip hemorrhaged all over the office, ruining my homemade Silver Apples tee. Anyway, the man CANNOT HAVE FUN. Somehow his pleasure-receptors got all crosswired with his analytical lobe, and he thinks thinking is fun. Check his reviews in our nifty archive to behold his pedigrist polemiciana. So you know what band is a lot of fun? Numbers. You know who dissed the frozen shit out of their recent long-player? Ott. He turned in another of his ""State Of The Legacy Of Something Or Other"" reviews, claiming they were a rich man's Devo or Gary Numan (don't get me started about the day Pitchfork's Ry Schreiber chucked one of our ergonomic pencil sharpeners at me for defending Devo). Ott's disrespect was writ large when he didn't even get their album title right. It's called Numbers Life, not Life, so nyaah, you exacting motherscratcher! Yes, Numbers is derivative as all hellhole, their sound a clone xeroxing its carbon-copied dub of a fascimile's simulacrumatic twindred. But they are so damn fun, barking dumb automaton slogans to junkily stilted laptop-punk ad giddeum. More, I say.

You know what band is great for a night of who-cares-we're-already-dead? Numbers. Death is a buoyant collection of remixes and restagings, principally of work from Numbers Life, and it manages to expound on the post-humanity of its source material, setting Indra Dunis' chants of answering machine lingo and traffic patterns against a grid of rabid oom-chicka. The ho-hum rating above is to placate the PhD-seekers in glitchography who scour this website; Death offers nothing groundbreaking in the field of DJ overhauls. But that does not stop it from being frequently awesome, as each contributor's cheesy or noisome configuration combines to predict what would happen if Negativland looted C&C; Music Factory. Though this incognito Anglo also gets mega-dissed, I don't care about his street resume: Gold Chains' assault on Numbers' ""Prison Life"" offers a hilarious intro, then takes a band who sounds like '74-'77 Devo and reduces them funnily to '94 (Smooth Noodle Maps-era) Devo, before he busts into a Body-Count-ish punk skrang, bringing to mind grunge outliers Clawhammer and their album of Devo covers. That lauded klepto, Kid 606, turns in the least interesting of three versions of Numbers' consumer-anthem ""We Like Having These Things""; while Dwayne Sodahberk's take provides a slice of funk deprogramming itself, spoof act Zeigenbock Kopf outrocks both of these renditions with their speaker-shattering Teutonic gay-porn-a-thon, which swaps Numbers' hankering for Chinese cultural revolution syntax with phrases such as ""morning erections,"" ""man abuser,"" ""dance-floor manpiles,"" and ""bathroom sweatfest."" As if an electro Turbonegro wasn't inevitable; relish this violation of Numbers' daffy culture-critiquing. Dymaxion's ""What Is The Product"" sounds like Pink Floyd's ""Money"" done up by Pizzicato Five and Dee-Lute until it unfortunately starts relying on Speak-n-Spell vocal tones, which have been quasi-passe since right before Beck abused them. Uprock's ""Alphanumeric Disinformation"" fascinatingly deconstructs Numbers' ""Information"" to a paramecium state, never letting it really start for three-and-a-half-minutes. Face it, Ott, this disc bumps! I love hearing rhythmagicans plug Numbers songs into their computers, atop our culture of people caressing their cellphones and glaring at cars like they need to hump the gashole. Numbers is right! Language is a code! Rock is a treadmill! Choose Death. I don't want to meet the person too icy to enjoy Original Hamster's wonderfully spastic, maximum-overdriven, Wal-Martyred handling of Numbers' subway intercom ode ""Human Replace"". And, yo-ho, Kit Clayton's ""Information"" blends anarchy with limo-booty way better than Aphex Droid. But when I told Ott what I was reviewing, he said, sniggeringly, for me to include how he was a ""total culture fascist."" He even accused me of pining for robo-chanteuse Indra Dunis. I simply must brain him with a brass spittoon. Have a machine day, dear reader, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.

Iki,Värttinä,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98c9d034d5c69bf3c84/1:1/w_160/cdcace96.jpg,2003-05-22 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8516-iki/,Northside,"Finland's VärttixE4 began in the early 80s as a 21-member ensemble, 15 of which were female vocalists, performing traditional folk music from the southeastern Karelian region. The vocalists' distinctive, sharp style, accompanied by upright bass, violin, accordion and various woodwind instruments was featured on two late 80s records only released in their own country. These were regionally popular discs, but the band didn't hit it big until the primary players (including current members Mari Kaasinen and Janne Lappalainen) jumped ship and formed a second, smaller version of the band (in a turn oddly similar to the Amon Düül legacy). This group released the internationally popular Oi Dai in 1990, which stuck close to their folk roots but introduced a manic rock edge. Imagine a tight gypsy band, nimbly dancing around impossible shifts in meter and speed, but only in support of some of the most amazing vocals ever recorded. VärttixE4's singing reminds me of the late-80s' Mystere des Voix Bulgares series on Elektra/Nonesuch, with their high register acrobatics and almost piercing unison lines. In short, they might think stuff is old hat in Finland, but to me it sounds like the party music of Nordic war gods. Iki is VärttixE4's ninth studio record, and their best since that remarkable 1990 LP; it's especially welcome after a lengthy period wherein they appeared to be going for some kind of adult-contemporary crossover (most notably on 1996's underwhelming Kokko) but ended up sounding like a tart, unplugged ABBA. The tempos have slowed a tad over the years, and the vocalists aren't dazzling you with fireworks so much as enticing with intricate harmonies and tender expression, but with that said, much of this will still get your blood moving if you let it. Karelian folk seems to have some kind of built-in adrenaline, so even when things don't seem that hectic, they're brimming with kinetic energy nonetheless. Versions of ""Syyllinen Syli"" (from traditional verse, though VärttixE4 perform mostly original music now) bookend Iki, and illustrate perfectly the kind of passion the group are able to pull out of harmonies and phrasing that must be hundreds of years old. The song is apparently about an unfaithful husband, and the minor-key melody makes it pretty clear these women are none to happy about the guy. However, despite the powerful wail of the trio of vocalists on the second version, it's Kaasinen's delicate solos on both tracks that overwhelm me. I'm not really the type to go on about someone's voice, but hers is simply gorgeous. ""Tuulen Tunto"" adds a full band, a dreamy, almost elfin ballad; the vocalists soar over an opulent arrangement of accordion, violin and acoustic guitar as the gentle piece takes on an angelic timbre. ""Tauti"" (translated as ""Disease"") is an aggressive odd-metered jaunt, with some of the best singing on the record. The band hacks into the piece with precision, and the violin drops a few harrowing lines to send some folks into celebratory convulsions while causing others to trip all over themselves. Again, it's hard to tell whether this music is happy and fun or brutal and warlike, but when it provokes my blood to boil so, I cease splitting hairs. Susan Aho's ""Maahinen Neito"" (""Earth-Maiden"", which betrays the mythological tint to much of this music) succeeds even further at this: dark guitar figures, misty reeds and a cutting bass support her vocal, which sounds at once a warning and a seduction. The tune explodes into a chorus of three-part harmony and slashing cymbals, at which point everything gets witchy, with a disembodied moan and unison drone replacing the previous restless dance. The outro slams all of this into one manic pot, and goes away just as quickly. Fucking breathless. There's a lot to recommend here, but I'll provide the caveat that if you absolutely hate the modal adventures of bands like John Zorn's Masada, of Pachora, Les Voix des Bulgares or any number of Eastern European folk groups, this might not be up your alley. One of VärttixE4's attributes is that they seem to have little problem translating faraway jams into something a whole bunch of people can understand, so an obscuro-fetish is hardly required.

Though he started making ambient house records in the early 90s, latter-day Terre Thaemlitz music is not for the background. Well, you might get away with playing a record while you read one of his lengthy essays from the CD booklet, thus interfacing with Thaemlitz's ideas on two levels simultaneously. But in general his theory-driven work requires both heavy concentration and a certain amount of back-end reflection to be absorbed. There's nothing light about his intent, concept, tone or sonics. Lovebomb is Thaemlitz' exploration of ""love"", and I use quotes because Thaemlitz is a skeptic. The tightly-spaced 32 pages of liner notes, which are written in both English and Japanese (Thaemlitz moved from the Bay Area to Tokyo) lay out in detail how, despite the spread of the West's version of ""love,"" the meaning of the word still varies greatly from place to place, and indeed even within a single closed cultural system. The essays that accompany the tracks provide the theoretical backing, but despite their liberal use of poststructuralist jargon, the meaning of the music is even less clear. This is a strange album. Having listened to it 15 times or more, I can hardly recall a thing about it once I slip it back into its case, and sometimes my memory doesn't even last that long. As Lovebomb is filled with odd pockets of silence ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes long, sometimes it's easy to forget that you're listening to music at all. The music seems designed to resist easy assimilation, and this is one of the more fragmented records I've heard. Tracks range from tiny snatches of sound to epics more than ten minutes long. There are plunderphonic cut-ups, noise, raw found recordings, ambient drones, delicate piano mediations...just as you're getting into one mode Thaemlitz he changes his pitch up, thus keeping you at arms length. And yet, despite the pretension and the dense impenetrability, certain aspects of Lovebomb are so undeniably powerful that you have to give yourself over to Thaemlitz. First, there is ""Between Empathy and Sympathy is Time (Apartheid)"". On this track Thaemlitz takes an Apartheid-era militant speech from a member of South Africa's African National Congress and filters it through the music of Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"". I mean ""filters"" literally here. The speech is run through a vocoder that varies along with the Riperton tune, so that the words of the speech-- about acquiring weapons, killing policemen, bombing factories-- are shaped the harmonic qualities of the song. It's a haunting and utterly unique effect, and the track is difficult to describe in terms of emotional complexity. It's somehow sad, frightening, confusing, inspiring and intellectually engaging all at the same time. And then there are several places where Thaemlitz' genius for sonic texture and dynamics come through. The title track moves from almost inaudible silence to room-shaking, bassed-out distortion and back again over its 10 minutes, but it somehow manages to remain compelling and coherent as a composition. And ""Sintesi Musicale del Linciaggio Futurista (Music Synthesis of Futurist Lynching)"" provides an interesting contrast between its minimal Music For Airports-style piano and a mangled spoken word collage. And in running down Lovebomb's high points, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the gorgeous sleeve (drawings of a lynching and a scene from a subway terrorist attack are gussied up with scattered photographs of roses), which Thaemlitz illustrated and designed. And somehow, some way, something about ""love"" is what ties all this together. It's difficult to understand the ideas at work without going back to the liner notes, but even the essays bring more questions than answers. In the CD booklet Thaemlitz offers, ""Love-- no matter how inexplicably mentally consuming-- is not so much an emotion as an equation of contextually specific cultural variables."" And elsewhere, ""Love is...a redundant construction of pacifying hysteria, a mandatory insult to appease our senses."" I'm not positive, but I think this is just a fancy way of saying: I've had the blues

Michigan Haters,Sightings,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f1ea9e61561daa4dbb/1:1/w_160/efab9f63.gif,2003-05-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7143-michigan-haters/,Psycho-Path,"I was dreaming of a chance encounter between Steven Stapleton and Ralph Ellison when the shrill ring of my telephone shot me off the couch, causing my laptop to fall to the floor in the process, the cursor blinking on a nearly blank screen. I picked up the phone still groggy from my nap, and slowly tried to understand the upset voice on the other end of the line. ""Hello? This is he. Yes, Michigan Haters is staying at my place, but only until I finish reviewing it. No, I'm not its legal guardian, but-- may I ask who's calling, please? Mrs. who? Well, Mrs. Indie Rock, could you please slow down and tell me what this is about?"" Apparently there had been an altercation at school: Mrs. Indie Rock's son, Bland, had been speaking to some girls at lunch, about his songs of angst and isolation, when Michigan Haters started screamed so loudly that it sent Bland crying from the cafeteria. He ran straight into the gym doors and wound up with black eye and a mild concussion. Mrs. Indie Rock is at the hospital, and she wants to know how I plan to handle the situation. She wants an apology. ""Ma'am, I'm truly sorry that this happened. I will speak with Michigan this evening, I assure you. Too violent? That's not really fair to say-- I don't think he's too violent at all."" Certainly most of Michigan Haters-- especially the opener ""Bought a Grandfather Clock""-- tend towards abrasion with its apparently nihilistic regard for instrumentation, but in the end this is the type of music that seems necessary as an outgrowth of other worthwhile genres, specifically Industrial music. This is how I would have imagined groups that followed in the footsteps of Throbbing Gristle and Coil to have sounded twenty years after the fact. The title track is especially exemplary of this trend, as metal-against-metal racket plays against the sound of broken radio transistors, atop a background of sophisticated free form percussion and guitar work. ""Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, now, see I disagree on that point as well. He's not a bully."" Basing an opinion on a casual listen, one could argue that it displays a very static and homogeneous sound, but if the Indie Rock family-- Bland, in particular-- would only take the time to listen with an open-ear, they might all might discover that there are a good deal of dynamics at work on Michigan Haters. ""Chili Dog"" slows the tempo to a relative halt, introducing a synthesized ping-pong rhythm that interplays with established, rising percussion. A fuzzy bass accompanies both elements as the polyrhythmic piece unfolds between the upper and lower register, loads of guitar effects keeping you transfixed. Closing with a reverb-laden guitar coda, ""Chili Dog"" helps put to rest any concerns that so harsh a band couldn't both build and wreck suspense. ""Meaningless noise?! Ma'am, I think you should take a moment to think this through, before you say anything you might regret."" While it's true that most of Michigan Haters ends up buried in the red, the album doesn't suffer from what you'd ordinarily expect from ""bad production."" Songs such as ""The Easy Answer"", ""Ihc-ic"", and ""I Feel Like A Porsche"" are meant to provoke a reaction with their imbalance, which goes hand-in-hand with the conceptual beauty of contrasting high-end guitar screeches with low-end bass and percussive distortion. The gluts of feedback act as a foil to the quieter moments culminating in the steel-drum like ending of ""Guilty of Wrecking"", which takes the album out on an atonal, yet striking note. ""Of course I'm sorry about poor little Bland Indie Rock, but have you considered that Michigan only lashed out because your child is so fucking BORING?"" I hung up the phone, knowing it was a lost cause. But ultimately, that's fine, and actually desirable: if rock music began as a rebellion against conservative parents, I'm happy to open my doors to the son of a bitch that punked its lame grand-kid in the eye. Sightings' latest doesn't think twice before lashing out, and in rock and roll, that's nothing to apologize for.",,8.8,
Shootenanny!,Eels,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc08eb335119a49ecb89/1:1/w_160/c112dade.jpg,2003-05-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2687-shootenanny/,Dreamworks,"Let's set aside that the Eels are not for everyone. Some folks can't stand frontman E's sense of humor, which he calls ""edgy"" but is closer to a seven-year-old yelling ""SHIT!"" in a crowd to embarrass his parents. Not everyone likes his super-polished power pop stylings; in fact us indie folk are usually suspicious of a band as finely calibrated to the needs of cutesy, ""alternative"" pop radio as the Eels. But you have to admit that E's had plenty of hits to make up for the misses. He has a knack for crossing obscenity and crass comments with heavy subject matter: the ballad ""It's a Motherfucker"", and the best songs on his ""catchy tunes about cancer and death"" album Electro-Shock Blues, combine this off-handed crassness with sincerely moving music, to put just the right spin on his personal fight with despair. And as for his pop, give him credit for clinging to the top tier of L. A.'s new breed of songwriters, rubbing up against Michael Penn on the soundtrack to The Anniversary Party, hanging out at Largo with Jon Brion, and hey-- maybe it was Aimee Mann who talked him into ditching his Souljacker-era homeless beard. We didn't sharpen the knives when the Eels announced a new record, even if the title deserves a chuckle. E coined the word ""shootenanny"" to describe a fun shooting spree, but this pathetic title turns out to be ten times more clever than anything else on the album. Musically and lyrically, E is spent-- out of ideas, out of innovation, unable to cough up anything but by-the-numbers pop in the fourteen originals he wrote for this disc. The self-loathing and despair that seeps in around the edges touch so lightly that they can't give it a backbone. I'm not slamming this album to diss the man behind it, but to tell him he can do better. Much, much better. E works country and blues into Shootenanny!; it opens as a polished, petrified bleat complete with harmonica, and reveals other would-be redneck classics like ""Restraining Order Blues"" and ""Lone Wolf"" as it spins on. Add to this superficial affectation E's stone-washed voice-- rougher than ever-- and you have the makings of an urban cowboy record, one that's sacrificed the splice-ups, orchestral fragments and family-friendly grooves that made him a rich man's Beck on previous outings. The production as always sounds great, making fifty cent arrangements sound like a million bucks, but that doesn't save the music, which is as generic a set of post-post-Beatles pop as he could possibly turn out-- with some of the least involving melodies of his career, like the blase feel-good of ""Rock Hard Times"". He offers some passable bubblegum-- the alt-rock anthem ""Saturday Morning""-- but only a few of these songs have anything fresh or engaging to offer. ""Dirty Girl"" or ""Wrong About Bobby"" muster fast, catchy hooks, and there's some graceful orchestration on ""Numbered Days"", showing E could have made a passable, catchy stop-gap album. Could have, if it weren't for the lyrics. The author of the rich and witty words of Electro-Shock Blues cranks out rhymes so forced, they're reminiscent of your parents making up lines while they sing along to the radio. Good choruses are marred by poor verses on ""Love of the Loveless"" and ""Dirty Girl""; his in-studio lyrics are never rewritten. ""I made mistakes/ Everyone does/ Don't know why I did/ I guess just because."" Was that even worth writing as a placeholder? Then there's his clunky stab at redneck chic. Johnny Paycheck he ain't: the violent psychodramas hinted at by the lyrics never come to life, and the few dark lines are left so far out on their own that they're inconsequential-- the serial killer threats in ""Rock Hard Times"", and his repetitious boasts that he's a ""lone wolf."" ""Wrong About Bobby"" is full of purely belligerent shit-talk: there's some guy named Bobby, and there's something about a girlfriend, and how Bobby'd better not fuck with E or E'll...I played it five times and I still don't know or care what revenge E's mapping out. ""Somebody Loves You"" wraps things up like a late-night hangover on the men's room floor, so vague and saccharine, grasping exhaustedly for meaning but coming off a maudlin meditation on its own failure. There are pleas for help on Shootenanny!, but he's recorded better pleas before. The problem isn't that the record's unlistenable, it's the half-assed, uninspired compositions themselves, scrawled on a Largo's cocktail napkin and run through auto-pilot, buttressed only by ""craftsmanship"" and token self-pity. The biggest alarm bell goes off on the second-to-last track, ""Fashion Awards"", which he wrote while watching the VH-1 Fashion Awards. Nothing signals muse-death better than a tune written in front of the tube, and E, if it's not too late, cancel your cable-- or better yet, make like Elvis, grab a gun and blow the idiot box to shit. There's a whole fucked-up post-9/11 world out there to sing and make tasteless, morbid jokes about, and I know you've got more to give us than this.","Let's set aside that the Eels are not for everyone.

Bloodthirsty Lovers,The Bloodthirsty Lovers,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31413d19756521389e4/1:1/w_160/67fc7d51.gif,2003-05-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/810-bloodthirsty-lovers/,Frenchkiss,"""We finally just had to move everything inside."" John put down the sheers for a moment to stress the impact of his next statement, ""It was raining so hard, its what we used to call 'dropping pitchforks and nigger-babies' on the land."" He had been my barber for nearly all my life, so I knew the uselessness of trying to argue with the old man. It was simply one of those moments that you face where you have to grin and bear it, realizing that not everyone is fortunate enough to know enlightenment in the modern age. Countless discussions with him-- coifed crown in the opposite direction of his Southern drawl-- had yielded scarce results in changing John's viewpoint. The key to his salvation (and ours) is in the realization that future generations will wince and learn from the mistakes of the past; righting wrongs and carrying on in what will hopefully be an improved manner. While no music can be considered an equal iniquity to racial slurs, if I had to pick a single pseudo-genre that was the closest to it-- and it happens to be experiencing a recent resurgence-- I would choose the music of the 1980s. The heavy reliance on synthesizers and childish notions of lyrical sincerity that the stereotypical 80s music was made of bring about nearly the same feelings of vehement distaste and disgust as the use of the n-word in casual conversation. Dismissal of the genre would be a grievous crime in the long run though, just as it would be wrong to put someone like John to death for doing what he's always been taught to do. Constructively, it would be wiser to learn from the spirit of the not-forgotten past, without strict adherence to any woebegone or vulgar ideology. Enter former-Grifters member David Shouse and his latest musical incarnation, The Bloodthirsty Lovers. Turning away from his most recent gig with Those Bastard Souls, Shouse's latest project experiments with the slight elements of the 80s listed above in his bout to infuse a salvaged period in pop's history with a refreshed viewpoint and some refined ideas. Falling into a more subdued pattern of melody and rhythm, Shouse partially succeeds in his goal, creating interesting songs that catalog some new tricks for this old dog. On ""Hardcore"", Shouse and his cronies-- drummer Paul Taylor from the North Mississippi Allstars and keyboardist Thom Krupski-- lay out their finest blueprint with a tinny beat overlapped by slowly evolving, distorted bass. The song progresses not unlike a heavier Cocteau Twins, except that instead of building to suspense, it leads itself towards stagnancy, content with its own aimless wandering before it weakly peters out. ""Call Off the Thugs"" begins with an ambient synth-intro that sounds like a poor man's Brian Eno or later-day Tangerine Dream, eventually melting into gentle guitar strumming accompanied by a frail drum program. Similar to the tracks ""Telepathic"", ""Transgression #9"" and ""Take the Time"", the song eventually becomes too focused on the bland repetition of its basic patterns, ultimately leading to a loss of all interest. ""Sonic Letter to Sara Jean"" behaves likewise, but the by-now usual fuzz is interchanged with the harder ""thump"" of programmed bass, as retrograde instrumentation flutters around a buried falsetto. The track makes further use of neo-psychedelic elements, sounding at times like a modern version of Tomorrow's ""My White Bicycle"" in its backwards guitar phrasing and obtuse lyrics. ""Datapunk"" emerges as one of the stand out tracks on the album, borrowing most heavily from the beat-heavy 80s, tagging what sounds like a Scott La Rock backing track onto a weary distorted bass, with electronic flourishes punctuating every down beat. Though one of the shortest tracks on the album, it summarizes the band's stated philosophy of assimilation and defiance to the utmost. Unfortunately, TBLs make an attempt to outrun the demons of their inspired past, and they are in the end overcome by the burden of previous blunders. The kitsch value of Shouse's current vehicle still makes one's jaw clinch at times, no matter how sincerely he pulls off certain aspects of the endeavor. He admits in an interview on the Southern Records website that this album was ""99% me; the next one will be a band project."" Perhaps tempered by the opinions of his bandmates, Shouse will reel in his unpleasant superfluities, and release a record in the near future to propagate the prouder elements of his new sound, excluding those that encumber this debut.","""We finally just had to move everything inside.""

Offcell,Pinback,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07713d19756521383bf/1:1/w_160/56c452ad.jpg,2003-05-21 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6297-offcell/,Absolutely Kosher,"Offcell isn't inherently shocking, since-- let's be honest-- Pinback only have so many moves, but it's another supremely gorgeous record from a band that exists outside contemporary musical trends, yet makes absolute sense within them. Quite simply, Pinback are an original pop band, and these days, you can almost count their peers on two hands. I saw Rob Crow and Armistead Burwell Smith IV a few months ago, at a bar staffed by muscle-bound, black-clad bouncers and tall, blonde, half-shirted waitresses carrying illuminated trays. It was the first time I'd seen the band in person, and this bizarre, conservative setting seemed all wrong; in my imagination, theirs was background music for firefly-infested fields and laid-back loft parties. What's worse, the club was packed, and it had a smoke machine, which pumped furiously and pointlessly before Pinback even took the stage. By the time they'd gathered their army of DAT machines, it was way too late for my wide-eyed excitement. They sounded pretty-- as expected-- but after four or five songs I left, dejected. What a fucking letdown after I'd waited four years to see them! Still, leaving early didn't bother me: I was only interested in seeing how well they'd pull their quiet magic off in front of staring eyes and the tired commentary of drunken goons. After a few songs, I'd seen all I needed, which is one of the beautiful things about Pinback: their work is a single volume of slight variation. You could cut and paste their output together as one big landscape of clouds, mist and plaintive sounds. And some complain, but I like the unwavering steadiness of their vision. Pinback have added layers as time's goes on, but otherwise, the narrative arc is entirely predictable, and all the better for it. This isn't some kind of underhanded compliment; you don't listen to or watch Pinback to be surprised, you welcome their aesthetic, because it lends the same nostalgic recognition as the smell of a freshly mown lawn. The main difference on Offcell is that the guitar and bass tracks sound more live and full, more ""rock"" for lack of a better word. I've always enjoyed the interiority of the duo's work, and would hate to see take on the boring mid-ranges of most indie twaddle, but they did record this EP in Smith IV's new studio, so this ""low-key technique""-- not so anal and arcane-- is probably just a byproduct of their surroundings (and, yes, as with their other releases, we get moody images of their gear). Offcell starts with the three-part ""Microtonic Wave"", which leads with a damp, sandy guitar, offset by piano and chimes. After a quick shift into the patented baritone/falsetto harmonizing, and bleak, often cryptic lyrics-- ""Cauterize my scars in scum""-- brief stardust vocals murmur and sigh below the persistent but dainty chimes. They've thankfully dropped the tired, ill-advised nautical fetish of old, instead finding inspiration in digital waves and telephones. ""Victorious D"" is improbably gorgeous, especially because it's such a bruised fruit. When I saw them perform it live, I wondered how they'd bury the bass line on record, and if Crow was supposed to be singing so absently off-key in the bridge. Seeing how they struggled through its ambitious melodies in concert, it's exciting to hear the resolution: Crow intones ""Angels suffering/ Angels fall from light/ Angels sickening/ Angels suffer,"" giving way to Armistead's higher-pitched response, which accrues a perfection all the more triumphantly on-the-mark. Offcell's midpoint is a lesser version of ""Tripoli"", from their 1998 debut. The band's never topped that one, that first song on their first record: its sunny instrumentation hid the ""sad I'm gonna die"" lyrics for weeks, and only over time, like a slow-release pill, did its intent emerge. ""B"" is Pinback as garage rock: distorted guitars blending into computer blips and drum machines, the rust and angular gears of their vintage gear praising an idiot god. I thought of the town ""B"", from William H. Gass' In The Heart of the Heart of the Country, a place of revulsion and poetic repose. As in ""Tripoli"", there's again a discrepancy between the cheery musicality and creepy lyrics, drones in the air and kids down spiral stairs: ""Mommas tell your babies not to rest inside your will/ Kids in refrigerators won't scratch their way out, and never will."" ""Grey Machine""-- an eleven-minute, string-based doo-wop romance-- streaks across the sky, considering space and time before retreating into the more immediate powers of memory. I don't want Pinback to break-up, but in a way, this unique, potent bag of sweets would be a nice finale to what began so gloriously with ""Tripoli"" in 1998. You'll have to excuse my romanticism-- and don't worry, there's a Touch and Go full-length due in 2004-- but this grand epic, after many minutes and layered sounds, delivers its own aching epitaph: ""Pick me up/ Take me home/ Get me out of here/ Please.""","Offcell isn't inherently shocking, since-- let's be honest-- Pinback only have so many moves, but it's another ...

Scratchology: Mixed by the X-ecutioners,Various Artists,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7dab1335d7bf1699143/1:1/w_160/a73b42a5.gif,2003-05-21 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1978-scratchology-mixed-by-the-x-ecutioners/,Sequence,"Back in about 7th grade or so, a friend tried to impress me with the depth of his musical knowledge, urging me to check out Aerosmith's version of ""Walking the Dog"". Apparently this boy genius had been raiding Mom and Dad's record cabinet and discovered the percussive, muted guitar breaks at the end of each chorus as those future Behind the Music posterboys tried desperately to be as funky as Rufus Thomas. His conclusion? That Joe Perry had invented scratching. Now, I don't know what happened to this kid after high school, but I think it's safe to assume he's not a logic professor. Still, maybe he was more prescient than I'm giving him credit for, considering that within a year of his prophecy, Run D.M.C. and the toxic twins' cover of ""Walk This Way"" dominated MTV and radio alike. Wait, come on-- anyone who's even remotely aware of hip-hop knows scratching ain't scratching unless there's a turntable involved. Not surprisingly, Aerosmith are nowhere to be found on Scratchology, the latest mix CD in a series that previously put the Beat Junkies' DJ Babu, Dan the Automator and Slum Village to the mixtape challenge. This time around, Sequence aims to outline the history of scratching with tracks selected and mixed by that highest-profile of turntablist crews, the X-ecutioners. Moving from 1981 to the present, in roughly chronological order, the X-men sprinkle spoken testimonials in with impeccably arranged rare tracks and standard-bearers, giving the disc an aural documentary feel that, though nowhere near comprehensive (and it's not intended to be), is as enlightening as it is enjoyable. After an adroit X-men introduction, they get right to work with the first scratch-oriented song ever recorded, ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel""-- the best possible point of entry with Flash's sleight-of-hand effortlessly turning ""Rapper's Delight"" into ""Another One Bites the Dust"" and back again, like a hip-hop David Copperfield. From there, it's a short ride through the 80s, touching on both the ubiquitous and the ultra-rare. Herbie Hancock's electrojazz masterpiece ""Rock It""-- once renowned more for its video's creepy robots-- stands as testimony to the scratching skills of Grand Mixer DXT. Mixmaster Gee's ""Like This (Full & Fresh)"" is just the contrary; according to X-man Rob Swift, ""A lot of people don't even know this record exists,"" increase Scratchology's value tenfold. The 90s section runs a little heavy on back-patting with solo tracks by Swift and fellow X-ecutioner Roc Raida, along with several more by various combinations of their contemporary crews, The Beat Junkies and Invisibl Skratch Piklz. Of these, Raida's ""I'll Kick Ya Ass"" definitely fulfills its promise in a back-to-basics nod to some of the disc's earlier cuts. Also representing for that decade: a Pete Rock mix of Public Enemy's ""Shut Em Down"" and Gang Starr's ""DJ Premier in Deep Concentration,"" two fine examples from scratch-masters who came to prominence in the late 80s and chose to work through most of the 90s with emcees, rather than banding together with fellow turntablists. The X-men even throw in ""Premier's X-ecution""-- one of the few redeeming moments from last year's Built for Scratch-- a DJ equivalent of the posse cut that sounds much fresher far, far away from that record's Linkin Park love-in. If you thought, as I did, that the X-ecutioners had ditched their integrity for five minutes on MTV, don't count them out just yet: let this bit of DJ history as heard through their ears serve as a statement of intent, and hope their next record of original material delivers substantial evidence.","Back in about 7th grade or so, a friend tried to impress me with the depth of his musical knowledge ...

To The Rooftops,Watchers,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa84ea9e61561daa5be1/1:1/w_160/0b121b46.jpg,2003-05-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8759-to-the-rooftops/,Gern Blandsten,"Who knew you didn't need ""fun"" to spell ""funk""? It seems almost impossible, but Watchers have found a way, though I doubt they were looking for one. They want to be the life of the party, but like the kid you gave near-beer that acts hammered, they're trying way too hard. To the Rooftops, their debut full-length, can't contain its own ambition, combining angry post-punk funk with world-music dub and hints of Chicago's post-rock, post-hardcore, post-everything scene. Which is by now post-entertaining. These disparate styles are braced together so rigidly that all fluidity is lost, resulting in stilted, workmanlike compositions that play it off casual, but sound like they were recorded at gunpoint. Part of the trouble is that, while they cycle through a huge swath of distinctly different genres, all the elements are tossed together in indistinct ways, at incongruous times. Not one of the myriad modes they draw inspiration from becomes a clear anchor for any of their songs, ""Follow Me, Follower"" excepted. Basically, they sound a lot like mid-period Talking Heads without the...is ""edge"" the word I'm looking for? Maybe it's ""coke."" Whether or not they're purposely recycling ""Burning Down the House"", regurgitation like this is rarely exciting. Michael Guarrine sings with the ice-cold confidence of an evangelical David Byrne, going so far as to duplicate his signature staccato enunciation; the band firmly embraces the funk-punk-fused polyrhythms exemplified on 'Heads tracks like ""Cities"" and ""Life During Wartime"", but the pop sensibility to smooth out those rough angles is absent. Instead, Watchers dwell on post-punk anxiety, lending these tunes a forced, undeserving gravity. Not all of To the Rooftops is marred by such a contradictory sense of over-seriousness. Though plodding, twitchy cuts like ""Gold Standard"" and ""The Dirty Sponsor"" feel like a chore so early in the record, stiffened by monotonous, dry beats and a stockroom of old, half-hearted funk riffs, things improve as the album draws to a close. The aforementioned ""Follow Me, Follower"" delivers some unique energy at last: chugging guitar and surprisingly slick bass give the tune a recognizable face, something Watchers can call their own amid a sea of characterless clichés. They go on to do themselves one better with ""Taxiland"", the record's obvious highlight; off-kilter rhythms and deliriously unbalanced guitar lines give the song a woozy, spiraling charm, and somehow still preserve its fundamental dancefloor appeal. ""When the Night Comes"" is a decent-enough finale, relying on the band's few strengths, but it only begs the question, ""Why couldn't the first half of To the Rooftops have been this engaging?"" Terrible production doesn't help, as nothing comes even remotely close to breaking out of this cardboard-flat mix, but as problematic as these uniform levels are, it still comes back to the Watchers' overly sober, suspect sonic mixture. Despite their obvious efforts to enthrall and entice with punk-funk riffs, this throw-down has all the spontaneity of an office birthday party. Guarrine howls ""Cut loose!"" as the oh-so-strained funk underpinnings of this music try to play along, but it feels like the off-hours rebellion of your coworkers. Like most parties, it takes a little time for things to heat up, and the band gradually settles into a smoother, more vibrant art-funk groove after the initial stiffness, but by the time they come around to their formless 9-5 lament ""My Cube"", the Watchers have loosened the restraints as far as they're gonna. The implicit sentiment is still ""Your ten-minute break is over in five minutes,"" and everyone knows the door to the roof is locked.","Who knew you didn't need ""fun"" to spell ""funk""?

Dandelions, and breezy windfalls. My knees got weak from the aroma, the sense of a smart man writing what was on his mind, and not being so cynical that he doused his thoughts in the petals of harmony. Instead, he doused his music in stories. They could be real, they could be fake, but you don't know for sure because they're just too vague for interpretation, and you don't wanna project your own shit onto music this nice, this universal. You don't wanna dump your own problems onto it. This music is about feelings-- not emotions, feelings-- like the sixth sense you get when summer's about to break, when the mail carrier's about to deliver a package to your door, when someone's about to break your heart but it's okay 'cause Life. Is. Awesome. The Long Winters are a wholly life-affirming band, helmed by acclaimed Seattle songwriter John Roderick. He's backed by drummer Michael Shilling, bassist Eric Corson, and former Harvey Danger vocalist/keyboardist Sean Nelson-- his regular boys. Oh, and a 26-person ensemble of violinists, tamborinists, and producers, including Chris Walla and Peter Buck. You get the feeling that, during the taping of this album, Long Winters, et al. were flipping somersaults in the studio, or smooshed all together like moppets. You feel as if they are screaming even when they're not, because they are taking gigantic breaths, letting air fill their guts full. It's just straight rock and roll, really, and I mean really straight rock and roll. There's a tinge of folk, a tiny, tiny dash of mid-level Beatles/Kinks...it has the same wildflower fragrance as 120 Minutes circa 1991. R.E.M.? World Party? ""Sowing the Seeds of Love""?! Anything is possible. And here, ""anything"" is the elimination of hippie-ness in music that sounds so wholly optimistic. It's all in the harmonies. Sure there's unmitigated rosy joy blossoming from every boppy keyboard hinge, a gleaming simplicity that's neither sentimental nor under-thought, but makes you feel so good is Roderick's sometimes-craggy, mostly regular-guy yelp, as it sweetly rubs up against Nelson's familiar tweet (""familiar"" as in Harvey Danger's ""Flagpole Sitta"", which you may or may not recall blasting from every college dorm a few years ago). Crashing waves of distortion cut out to reveal a spry orchestra of stringed instruments, ebbing and flowing as the pair sing, ""I'm countin' on you to throw more than shapes!"" When I Pretend to Fall is not without imperfections; for one, it's a little too glossy, but then again, I'm used to recordings where people jam up their laptop outlets with dirty rags dipped in ether and Vaseline. One grave misstep is the album's closer, ""Nora"", which is horribly heavy on the cymbal and cheesy with its guitar solo. Roderick also sings the finale in an unbecoming, monotonous drawl, a shame of a parting impression since he's best when he's skipping around the scales like a lop rabbit. Teeming with the ""nice"" and major-key action, Long Winters can at times get a little barfy. But time is on there side, as right now the sun is out, life is rad, and their sometimes too-simple songs are nothing if not solid. What the fuck, I can dig it.","I tore the shrinkwrap off this album and the smell of dandelions spilled out. Dandelions, and breezy windfalls. My knees ...

Dark Island,Pram,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a112ea9e61561daa46ed/1:1/w_160/46a30850.jpg,2003-05-20 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6446-dark-island/,Merge,"Part of Pram's charm has always come from the junky, worn sound of the instruments they employ: a battery of kitsch like homemade theremin, glockenspiel, loungey synths, and the other accoutrements that with their lo-fi lack of polish made the group sound genuinely ""vintage""-- in the most leftover, castaway sense of the word. It took a real spark of ingenuity to breathe life into something that had been all but designed to sound beaten: the snarled noise of Gash and the infectious, bubbly Museum of Imaginary Animals-- with its mermaids and owls, frizzy noise and bursting-out hooks-- showcase the band at their best. But their new record, Dark Island, paints them in a drab light. Working at a slower pace, they play off a shallow exoticism as genuine as a fortune teller on the boardwalk in a seaside town. Song titles like ""Penny Arcade"" and ""Peepshow"" evoke old-time fun, the kind that you don't really believe in but go along with because it's shiny and makes your date giggle. But more often than not, the facade doesn't sparkle: the album's like a wind-up toy that's slowly worn itself out. The problem is that Pram don't fit the poignant mood they're trying to create. First and foremost, singer Rosie Cuckston-- their lyricist and frontwoman-- sounds dreary even as she aims for ""mysterious."" To further the analogy, if we're talking about wind-up toys, Cuckston is the clapping monkey that's been loved a little too hard and can't quite get the cymbals to connect. Her voice has often been called ""idiosyncratic"" for her tendency to show off just how weak it can be; instead of playing to its few strengths, she'll flaunt how much she's struggling to hit or sustain a note-- see Museum's ""Bewitched"" for an example that, in a goofy way, actually works. Here, however, she's just flattened and even listless on ballads like ""Goodbye""-- a tune with a glimmering melody and hurt sentiment that nevertheless doesn't tug the heartstrings. The band barely shakes off the dust of the past three years: trumpet and clarinet on ""Peepshow"" barely conjure a burlesque swagger, but the synths of ""Penny Arcade""-- the kind of technology that gets them compared to a low-rent Stereolab-- throb and buzz dazingly to support Cuckston's hints of sin. ""Paper Hats"", with an abruptly quicker tempo and knottier lyrics, almost sounds out of place, less breezy and more tense than the other tracks. The instrumentals promise less and deliver the most, like ""Leeward"", which captures the best sense of dreamy, distant drifting, wafting away on numbing waters; yet too many of the songs repeat and meander until this mood wears off. With more work, this direction could pay off, but even the fizziest of their past records were marked by eccentric, even manic bursts that carried the dark subject matter; at their best, they refined the contrast between the tinny gaiety of their tacky music and the complexity of Cuckston's voice. Taking the whole thing seriously ruins the tension, and Dark Islands is as somber as an amusement park in the off-season: sad and profound-looking at first, but ultimately, pretty dull.","Part of Pram's charm has always come from the junky, worn sound of the instruments they employ: a battery ...

Ether Teeth,Fog,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde3c0084474cd0c2dca/1:1/w_160/9cae282f.jpg,2003-05-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3130-ether-teeth/,Ninja Tune,"Fog's Minnesota driver's license is inscribed with the name his mama gave him (a comparably unromantic Andrew Broder), and the shrewdest Minneapolis hipsters might recognize him by his club moniker, the farcically straightforward DJ Andrew, but on Ether Teeth-- his second full-length-- he is, conveniently, all Fog. Broder's latest alias is an appropriate metaphor for Ether Teeth's eleven wispy, befuddling tracks: alternately gorgeous and jarring, soothing and repetitive, Ether Teeth is a hypnotic, moody collection of experimental guitar wails, lush piano, eclectic sampling, and ethereal, hissing blank space. Bursting forth from the collage-driven DJ tradition (Prince Paul to Kid Koala), Fog is obviously well-versed in the process of snatching and reusing, infusing his tracks with occasionally ironic spots of found sound. The general problem with found stuff-- be it a Diana Ross backbeat or a canary-- is that the act of recognition is not an especially artful endeavor in and of itself. Recontextualization is hip-hop's founding principle, but it's a tenet based on the idea that sampling should involve skillful arranging and sequencing, not straight up cutting and pasting. Appropriation and transplanting requires ingenious tweaking in order to deserve a stamp of reinvention; to become the painting-- not just the wall it's hanging on. Fog, fortunately, realizes this-- his snagged material, which can consist of anything from film dialogue, to conversations, to fragments of old songs, to birds, birds, birds-- are placed over alarmingly beautiful, droning guitar chords and splatters of piano. Despite a couple of rough spots, Ether Teeth is largely composed of sublime moments in which the sound becomes part of the song, complimenting the melodies and functioning cohesively rather than extraneously. ""Plum Dumb"" is a heart-stopping, expertly assembled opener that layers rich guitar plucking over a Casio-looped classical drone and buzzing, almost-human turntable slips. A creepy choral refrain of ""which nobody can deny!"" eases in like a second melody; soon, a meandering piano line snakes through, building to a thunderous, overwhelming climax before easing back out and ending on a breathtaking choral sample, now louder, stranger, and throatier. The foot-stomping ""What a Day Day"" is more straightforward: snarky, sarcastic and fueled by aggressive acoustic guitar, Fog's charmingly haphazard singing finds a contextual home here. After an unpredictable two minutes, it bursts into a chorus on par with the best melodramatic piano ballads from the 70s: ""If you need me, call my lawyer."" Another archaic vocal sample pops up at the end, warning everyone to ""get out of Terrible Town"" and ""go on to Lovelyville."" ""The Girl from the Gum Commercial"" opens with some nicely obnoxious open-mouthed gum mauling; these smacks sound oddly percussive against a rudimentary piano melody and quiet guitar strums, like sticky, high-pitched drums. Fog's voice sneaks around the tune, sometimes loud, sometimes inaudible, but the track vehemently refuses to follow any sort of logical, linear path. It's a dynamic trick: if you've got the patience to stick it out for five minutes, the alarming turntable debauchery halfway through should substantiate the investment for most. It's the winning (if anything-but-cheery) ""Cheerupcheerily"" where Fog's isolated misery is most dramatically defined. As an ambient swell-- almost certainly snatched from a U2 track, and quite possibly the instrumental ""Korova 1""-- loops repeatedly, the song gradually builds into a clarinet-dotted wail of distortion so focused and thin, it threatens to tear a hole through your line of sight. Like cinema's recent Americana melodramas, it's a meditation on ache and desire that's at once aware of its insignificance in the scope of things. Ether Teeth sags briefly midway through-- ""No Boys Allowed"" and ""Apologizing to Mystery"" are both half-conceived-- but immediately after, the 11-minute ""Wallpaper Sink or Swim"" seems a clear and devestating revelation. After five minutes of its barely-there piano and jutting left-channel samples, a thundering melody harkens a new beginning, killing itself on an odd chord before rising again as a dramatic, ascending progression. Hushed jazz drums begin to stutter and fall all over the track as horns, tones and samples wander around Fog's constant chant, ""Goats will eat tins cans,"" an apparently meaningless repetition that has a surprising function: the lyric is the grounding melody around which an orchestra of instruments circle, a moment in which hip-hop's tradition of juxtaposition meets music theory. Fog lays down some skillful, ambitious, and certainly curious foundations on Ether Teeth, but his coloring book isn't completely filled in. But that he's made such a tremendous leap from his amateurish if promising debut to this highly developed, emotionally attenuated sound manipulation speaks to his future. For its sometimes uneven composition, Ether Teeth brings reality closer to your ears than most music ever hope, melding folk, hip-hop and psychedelia to produce a few of the finest tunes you'll hear this year. Surprisingly personal and emotionally resonant, Ether Teeth is potent inspiration, undeniably captivating in its moments of brilliance.","Fog's Minnesota driver's license is inscribed with the name his mama gave him (a comparably unromantic Andrew Broder ...

The River,William Basinski,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2245e6ef9596932034f/1:1/w_160/90aeabea.gif,2003-05-20 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/576-the-river/,Raster-Noton,"This happened once before, at least. It was in Memphis-- not the ancient one nestled on the banks of the Nile, the one situated along the Mississippi. In the early sixties, before the Beatles landed upon our shores and seeded the hippies. During those years, young kids became interested in the sounds of folk and blues, scarcely realizing that their Negro gardeners and street-sweepers were once prominent Blues recording artists in their own right before the Depression hit. Right under their noses, folks like Furry Lewis played and sang the blues, scant houses down from them. Fast-forward to late-90s Williamsburg. After scoring increasingly pricey Brian Eno ambient records like Music for Airports and Discreet Music on Bedford Ave., a group of tousle-headed hipsters walk up to look for cheeky furniture at a vintage store called Lady Bird. Little do they realize that the store's proprietor, William Basinski, beyond the daytime gaze of his patrons, spends his nights distilling string signals from the radio waves into loops of melodic ellipses, weaving them back together like Mark Rothko's blanket, suggesting resonant depth far beyond the surface of radio static. It's something that Basinski has been doing in secret for decades, realizing the symphonies behind refrigerator hum, jackhammers, bum mumbles, subway screech, night bleats, and the low volumes of Klaus Schultze records left looping in the loft space, gleaning the aleatoric ambience of such noises and acting as alembic for their salient features. The River, recorded in 1983, marks the first time any of this work has seen wide release: 1998's Shortwave Music was an impossibly rare 12-inch (also on Raster-Noton), and the rest of his discography is a numbered assortment of self-released CD-Rs. The River washes out your internal clock. Like the opening currents of Can's Future Days, it lulls you into dream-state. Drowned siren songs and dolphin chirps surface, AM symphonies and Muzak backwash swirl around, a reverberating snap crackle 'n' pop coursing over it all as it begins to move. Over the hour and a half of spectral waves, the tides heave heavenwards and back. Try as I can to hold on, there are no markers to indicate how far I've sunk into the music. If one image that continually loops through my mind as I drift, it is of an enormous ballet of ghostly zeppelins in the midnight sky, filled with careening ball lightning, hovering over the surface of the ocean, its ripples of water swollen with whale songs, rising and falling in a grand, gargantuan gesture. In terms of psychoactive aural properties, the echoing freefall and slowly evolving twirls of bliss-smoke are reminiscent of another two-disc drop through Nirvana, that of the Taj Mahal Travelers' August 1974. But the emotional undertow here could only match fathoms with a minimalist classic like Gavin Bryars' The Sinking of the Titanic. But The River is without context, an Alka-Seltzer commercial for transubstantiated Body of Christ tabs, peregrinating as they descend to the bottom of the Dead Sea's drinking glass, captured in slow-motion by structuralist filmmaker Michael Snow. Though it's taken twenty years for these waves to reach 21st century shores, they don't show many wrinkles. In fact, The River is so far ahead of its time that in hindsight, it could only have made sense this far downstream, after the ambitious radio documentation of fringe noises such as the Conet Project's ""numbers transmissions"" and the noises incorporated into two of last year's more aurally exciting pop releases, Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and the Trail of Dead's Source Tags and Codes (both integrated the sounds of shortwave radios, albeit only to make their guitar songs a bit weirder). It's a final justice that these clippings so mysteriously divined from the heavens can exist on their own infinite plane.","This happened once before, at least.

The River Nektar,Iditarod,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1a913d197565213bc2d/1:1/w_160/ffad232b.jpg,2003-05-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4059-the-river-nektar/,Hub City,"The sun breaks low on the Rhode Island horizon: it's a cold, snow-covered day, but a man breaks the still silence with a listlessly strummed chord on an acoustic guitar. A woman slowly begins to mumble. The noise threatens to rise to a boil, to cohere, to build into a perfect expression of icy beauty, but it never does. It goes nowhere, limply plodding through a lackluster haze of underproduction. Meanwhile, deep in the Alaskan wilderness, a sled dog sheds a single tear in the snow. So, welcome to the bottom of Pitchfork's review column! There are days when decent releases wind up down here simply by default-- bad timing, mostly-- but today is not one of those days. Obviously, not everything that crosses our desks is a work of unqualified genius, but every so often, a disc so encroaches on the gag reflex that it becomes necessary to issue a warning. So, I'm just going to pull out some of our patented critical orange cones and yellow crossing tape and put up a big barrier around this reissue in the hopes that you won't make the same mistake I did. Did you catch that? This is a reissue, meaning that at different points in time, two different labels felt this album was worth your time. This is Iditarod's 1998 debut, back in stores for God knows what reason. Excellent for beer coasters and torturing people with perfect pitch, this album manages to simultaneously give ambient, slowcore and folk a bad name. And the good folks at BlueSanct have even tacked on nine bonus tracks, nearly doubling the length of the album. Guys, you shouldn't have. No, I mean you really shouldn't have. Making it twice as long just makes this album twice as bad, though, truth be told, the bonus tracks are better than the original...material. Questions abound: Is the spelling of Nektar in the title a reference to the German prog band? Is it cool to cover Brian Eno even if your cover doesn't do him any justice? If you took the nice acoustic guitar part from ""Providence"" and mixed it with the weird noise from ""The Lorelei"", might it add up to something interesting? Why couldn't there be more songs like the dark acoustic guitar instrumental (and bonus track) ""Move""? What is the sound of one hand clapping? Is there anything on TV? In 1998, Iditarod were basically a duo comprising guitarist Jeffrey Alexander and vocalist Carin Wagner, and sweet Lord did they make some boring music. Alexander must have slept with his guitar-- an assumption I base on the fact that it sounds as if he's playing it in his sleep. Aside from the fact that his guitar is sometimes slightly out of tune, he's not technically horrific, it's just that his chosen idiom keeps him uninteresting and repetitive. Wagner's trembling, uncertain mumble on the other hand, that can't even be described as quasi-melodic-- pitch and key were discoveries not yet in the offing, apparently. It's like listening to a folk duo warm up before recording, something I doubt is a thrilling prospect to most listeners. A couple of tracks add some interesting textures, in the form of scraped guitar strings or singing bowls, and their subsequent releases have thankfully moved in this direction, but their barely-considered debut is just excruciating. Huskies and their mushers deserve better tribute than this-- you definitely deserve better than this. And George Washington deserves to have his crumpled green effigy exchanged for better than this. By and large, I think the recent trend toward reissuing every note ever played by anyone has enormous potential for good, frequently digging up forgotten sessions and lost albums that deserve to be heard. But there is a point where it goes too far-- certain bands' baby steps just aren't worth revisiting. I'm grasping for balance here-- Iditarod really have improved since this album first came out, and there are hints of neat things to come here and there, the best of which is the vaguely medieval textures and scraped and blown instruments that close out ""Mariner"". But a few merely curious moments-- and then only as harbingers-- cannot salvage this thing, a mostly shapeless lump of sparse almost-folk, almost-anti-folk that will frustrate your ears and have you begging for one fully-realized song.","The sun breaks low on the Rhode Island horizon: it's a cold, snow-covered day, but a man breaks the ...

5 Songs EP,The Decemberists,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e513d1975652139778/1:1/w_160/b99310b4.jpg,2003-05-19 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2240-5-songs-ep/,Hush,"Strange how sometimes you cax92t fully appreciate a band until you hear their lesser material. It's easy to take the most well-executed, naturally powerful elements of a band's sound for granted never having heard the early, less-refined work they've grown from. Such is the case with 5 Songs, a reissue of the Decemberists' self-released first EP, which features an additional, title-nullifying sixth track. The same crystal-clear, folk-informed sound that spun throughout the Portland band's beautiful full-length Castaways & Cutouts is at the core of 5 Songs, but singer Colin Meloy's potent, imaginative whimsy is passed up in favor of a more straightforward pop sensibility that's ultimately less rewarding. Much has been made of the similarities between Castaways & Cutouts and Neutral Milk Hotel's opus In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. The two albums do have a lot in common-- the similar vocal inflections of Meloy and Mangum and the intersecting themes of their material-- but Meloy's songs address mythical pasts with a certain degree of dream-like detachment, conjuring and retelling vivid images and tales while never participating directly. Mangum, on the other hand, is a man possessed: he lives his stories, and describes them with a wrenching directness. Meloy's subtle, observational tone seems like a moot point on 5 Songs, which never tackles the same kind of involved, quasi-historical narratives of Castaways. Not only is the EP thematically indistinct, the hazy red pastel clouds and ghostly, disembodied figures of Castaways are replaced with sharp, distinct outlines. Generally speaking, 5 Songs is a much more steady and controlled batch of songs, with none of the unsettling undertones of its winding successor. 5 Songs does convey a subtle sense of melancholy, through laid-back melodies and evocative instrumentation. The opener ""Oceanside"" is definitely one of the best offerings here, a backdrop of acoustic guitars and accordion painting a vivid picture of some lonely foreign port, perfectly framing Meloy's longing, nautical lyrics. The more uptempo ""Shiny"" fails to develop a particularly moving refrain, relying too heavily upon bits of slide guitar worked into a disappointingly formless structure. ""Angel, Wox92t You Call"" almost delivers on the sparse broken promise of ""Shiny"", building to a powerful chorus, but it stops just short. The appended ""Apology Song"" is simply out of place, with lame, awkward couplets like ""I'm really sorry Steven/ But your bicycle's been stolen."" Meloy is much more adept describing the regret of a soldier at Burkenau than that of some dude who lost his friend's bike; it's hard to take ""Apology Song"" as anything more than a hokey inside joke, and that can almost cheapen the resonance of his more potent latter-day lyrics. Though 5 Songs is by no means a bad release, its relative lack of substance when compared to Castaways is close to staggering; it makes the latter both a relief and a revelation, as the powerful songwriting hinted at here is fully realized. But it's easy to see how Castaways is an evolution from 5 Songs, which suggests that claims of theft or simple imitation hurled at Meloy are somewhat exaggerated, if not outright unfounded.","Strange how sometimes you can\x92t fully appreciate a band until you hear their lesser material.

More Nipples,Peter Brötzmann,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ba9d034d5c69bf2ec7/1:1/w_160/883cc672.gif,2003-05-19 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/967-more-nipples/,Atavistic,"Like the sound of flesh being torn from a spindly set of bones? Then chances are you already know Peter Brötzmann's music. The German saxophonist has made a career out of the kind of ear-shredding, lung-collapsing free jazz that makes most mortals run screaming for cover when it's thrown on the stereo; 36 years and counting from the release of his first record, Brötzmann still possesses the sandblasting tone that made his early LPs and performances the stuff of legend. As the story goes, at one moment of particularly divine inspiration, the man blew through his horn so hard that he burst a blood vessel in his forehead. If that's not hardcore, I don't know what the hell is. More Nipples is the fifth archival Brötzmann release from Atavistic, under the wing of Chicago jazz gadfly John Corbett's Unheard Music Series. Although these tracks had been previously unavailable since being recorded in 1969, they come from the same meetings that produced Brötzmann's original Nipples LP (hence the title). This session from April 18, 1969 put British improvisers Evan Parker and Derek Bailey into a once-in-a-lifetime sextet with Germans Brötzmann and Buschi Niebergall, and Dutch radicals Han Bennink and Fred van Hove (they'd record as a quartet 6 days, later minus the Brits). Unlike the alternate take filler that ruins most perfectly good jazz reissues, these are easily as good as the pieces that made it onto the original Nipples, and for 34-year-old tracks never intended for release, these recordings are astonishingly clean. The title track is 17 minutes of some of the most important music in the history of European free jazz-- a second run through the only piece recorded by this particular European Union of musicians. As it unfolds with duos and trios crystallizing from the splinters of the entire group's nuclear mass, it's even more apparent how well these guys understood each other's playing, to the point of being conscious of what the group performance sounded like as a whole. There are moments-- like Bennink's percussion fadeout on the precipice of Niebergall's bass solo-- that make it seem inconceivable these changes weren't written out beforehand. It's also an unfortunate reminder of how compatible Brötzmann and Parker's polar opposite styles were-- if only their egos hadn't been too overpowering for them to work together very often after these recordings. Of the quartet tracks, ""Fiddle-Faddle"" is the least revelatory, blistering along at an even keel with fairly programmatic free jazz structure until Niebergall's percussive bass and Bennink's hydra-limbed drum attack whirl up a remarkable climax. ""Fat Man Walks"", on the other hand, is quite unusual in comparison to the rest of Brötzmann's late-60s work-- or just about any other European improv from that era. The piece is built off of a peculiar gospel chord progression played by van Hove, setting up a melodic straitjacket that Brötzmann spends the song's first half trying to get loose from; when he finally succeeds, the force is so overwhelming that only Bennink can keep pace. Don't let the fact that these are outtakes scare you away from this disc, because this stuff is essential to anyone interested in how Herr Brötzmann earned his status as one of the most devastating forces to ever touch a saxophone. We can all benefit from a few more nipples in our lives.","Like the sound of flesh being torn from a spindly set of bones? Then chances are you already know Peter ...

"Rock, Rot & Rule",Scharpling & Wurster,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63c9d034d5c69bf34ad/1:1/w_160/3b7611f2.gif,2003-05-19 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7710-rock-rot-rule/,Stereolaffs,"As if you needed another reason to bemoan your radioless, radioless town, by which I mean snobbishly ""real"" radio, not the Powell-scion-deregulated monocultural squat brought to you by Clearcut Channel and like-unminded businessmen. Tom Scharpling deejays ""The Best Show On WFMU,"" WFMU being the legendary and amazingly multiform New York/New Jersey station on which programs as interesting as that of outsider-musicologist Irwin Chusid air. Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster telephones Scharpling's show, in different irritating guises, and people initially were fooled into calling and joining the discussion; 1997's single-show Rock, Rot & Rule captures this era. By the one 2000 show and five 2001 shows compiled on the two-disc Chain Fights, Beer Busts, and Service With A Grin, most of the audience is savvy to the show's premise, but they still call in as ironic participants. Yes, this prank has been done to death by practitioners of wildly varying merit, but I've heard no one as witty, as satirical, or as gleefully self-aware as this duo. Rock, Rot & Rule is a faux promotional interview with ""Ronald Thomas Clontle,"" who has ""written"" a book that's just a list dividing all of popular music history into the categories ""rock,"" ""rot,"" and ""rule."" This concept is an apt spoof of the false authority of rock guidebooks, of how all music-critics are self-appointed assbags, and of the fraudulent ""expertise"" (regarding not just music, but romance, parenting, etc.) holding forth from every magazine counter and bookstore shelf. Clontle admits to not being very knowledgeable, and has based his book on conversations he had in a coffee shop in Lawrence, Kansas, and while visiting his grandmother in Gainesville, Florida. Clontle is disinterested (he has money on a basketball game in progress), his rationale is inconsistent, and he contradicts himself often, setting up the enraged callers to come across as righteous defenders (and provincialist snobs, when they malign Lawrence and Gainesville). While the stereotypical music fanatic can be a flinchy aesthete (one of the callers seems to find Clontle's taste indicted by his basketball prioritization, a classic dualist fallacy), the venom they unleash, and the passion with which they debate these pointless hierarchies, mirrors that of the armchair coaches/athletes on sports radio. More enraging than Clontle's inflammatory remarks about Bowie, Zappa, and Neil Young ""rotting,"" and Madness ""inventing ska"" is his manner of turning the other cheek as callers become more confrontational; he lowers his mousy voice and offers tidings such as ""keep rockin"" and ""enjoy the night."" Wurster as Clontle is amazingly quick, reacting to every caller's diatribe hilariously, or relying on the book's overstated subtitle/slogan: ""It's The Ultimate Argument-Settler."" Of the six shows on Chain Fights, Beer Busts, And Service With A Grin, the funniest is ""The Gorch"". Roland Gorchnik--""63 years cool""-- claims to have been the inspiration for Happy Days' Fonzie, and has written a self-help book. As the interview progresses, Gorch quickly reveals that he is a sociopath, not just a lovable hoodlum. This skit manages to skewer generation gaps, terminal adolescence, the seventies and eighties' love affair with a lobotomized version of the Eisenhower era, the patheticness of the almost-famous, the absurdity of ""celebrity advice"" tomes, and the elasticity of pop icons. Remember the Fonzie-centric Weezer video, or the cartoons on which Fonzie appeared, Laverne And Shirley In The Army and Fonz And The Happy Days Gang, featuring the dog Mr. Cool, and Cupcake, girl from the future? It hits at how television softens America's underbelly-- wouldx92t a real Fonzie have been more drunk, more thieving, more violent, and treated women worse than Henry Winkler's hardly chivalric get-over-here finger-snapper? The Gorch is one of the machine-fixated cretins Marx predicted; even his choice of weapons (pipes and chains) are talismans of the industrial revolution. The Gorch so represents an American scourge that he brags of beating up an entire ""baseball game."" His homoerotic zeal for tussling with men (his band recorded a song called ""You=Beat Up"") and his motivational axioms (""College is for weak babies"") are fuggin uproarious. Laugh long and hard at this relic from the ""good old days,"" code for when blacks had few civil rights. The other five shows on the set are worthwhile. ""Radio Hut"" sends up the invasive interrogations to which Radio Shack subjects their customers, as well as that chaix92s overpriced, sub-cutting-edge products. If you ever detected something ominous, something just-about-to-snap in the electronics store that feels like a shoe store, you'll find ""Radio Hut"" a riot. ""The Music Scholar"" regards those Ari-Fleischer-smarmy record-geeks who namedrop as if their lives depend on it. This guest is a manifestation of elitism-as-brutality, reporting that he chastises customers of his store until they are in tears. The Stooges were ""his thing"" at age ten, and then he dug Mauve, pre-Big Star demos, rare Can, and Harry Partch. To him, the Residents and The Fall are ""teenyboppers."" ""Citizens For A True Democracy"" is almost not funny; the show involves a CEO Jr. who headed an Oliver-Stone-style cabal to ensure Bush's election. Though his arguments with stoned callers yield nervous chuckles, this pre-boxcutter bit comes too close to summoning the united-front teetotalitarians who now run a majority of our government. ""Mike Healy"" teeters on misunderstood small talk that gets blown exponentially out of proportion; this segment, though inventive, bears much in common with the quotidian-dread humor of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, or his headier episodes of Seinfeld. These CDs reward repeat plays, even if Scharpling seems a little pent or vaudeville-hokey in his ""straight man"" role, biding time and repeating the setups of punchlines. Offering listeners the voyeuristic thrill of the hoax but without stooping to cruelty, these radio shows would spice up a mean mix CD, or could work to combat the silence on that night when you and your friend/lover begin to take each other for granted, lacking the will to even speak.","As if you needed another reason to bemoan your radioless, radioless town, by which I mean snobbishly ""real"" radio, not ...

Shub Niggurath,Shub Niggurath,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a638ea9e61561daa5306/1:1/w_160/4b299d78.jpg,2003-05-19 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7706-shub-niggurath/,MuseaGazul,"Shub Niggurath arose from the pollution of a skewered kettle of semen and snot, fires raging around its crusted edges, sparks screaming with brilliant depravity. Which is to say Shub Niggurath formed in the mid-80s in France, playing an engaging mixture of free-jazz, electroacoustic music and avant-prog. Thing is, it's pretty easy to forget this band was made of living, breathing people rather than a concoction brewed by some dark magus, obsessed with violent self-gratification and the color black. What's more, the band was named after a fertility demon created by master of the macabre/really strange horror, H.P. Lovecraft. ""Ia! Ia!"" was the Lovecraftian monster's cry, and it matches pretty well with the scratches, shrieks and subsonic bass growl of Shub Niggurath. 1986's Les Morts Vont Vite was their first full-length release (after a self-released cassette), and so says me: it is one of the finest releases of that decade. The tunes tended to stretch out to epic length, and the atmosphere was decidedly grotesque: flailing, dirge-like beats, moaning, atonal guitar solos and massively distorted bass painted a frightening picture filled with various indecencies, and one that but for Ann Stewart's wordless soprano leads, would be almost entirely devoid of light. The band's 1991 follow-up C'etaient de Tres Grands Vents went even further, removing any ties to rock and presenting their dark visions as full-on impressionistic overtures and group improvisations. Bassist Alain Ballaud died of cancer in 1995, and the band broke apart, but their recordings from 1992 until that time are now available on this self-titled release. The music here is generally of two varieties: dark and ugly. That said, it is a deep darkness, and an interesting ugliness, so if it at first you dox92t get a little queasy, try, try again. For the most part, group improvisation is the program, and the overall mix of sounds shouldx92t actually be terribly shocking for anyone used to freak-outs via the likes of Sonny Sharrock, Nurse With Wound or even early Sonic Youth. The difference lies in Shub Niggurath's way of making all their pieces (each of which is untitled, identified merely by its track length) seem less like meandering skronk than soundtracks for bondage films we werex92t meant to see. If you've heard records like Naked City's Heretic or Merzbow's 1930-- records that wrung seductive fear out of ""noise""-- you'll find something to grab hold of here. My favorite track is actually the first, and, perhaps not coincidentally, it's the most structured. It's also the most cinematically horrific, the perfect soundtrack for plunging into darkness just after death. Omnipresent yet distant bass drones engulf a mix that also features scraped metallic percussion, low rolling toms, squealing guitar harmonics and a fine sonic approximation of the deep black sea. I've heard this pallet of sounds before, but always obscured by other elements and resolved too soon. Shub Niggurath milk this for all of its potency, and if it's a very bad trip you're looking for, they have you covered. The second track erases that uneasy tranquility with jagged jabs of guitar and tiger-roar bass, not to mention muscular jazz drums cracking anything in sight. It almost seems like a three-way fistfight, as cuts and scars are traded among the participants in rapid succession. If you can make through the gauntlet, I'd say you're threshold for pain is pretty high. Only the fifth track has anything close to a ""beat""-- fractured and thudding as it is-- but it doesx92t really takeoff until the last couple of minutes, wherein the aggressive bass and guitar give way to precisely timed staccato hits. The piece dies away into silence, and leads directly into the next, featuring what sounds like the remains of barbed wire fence being shaken and Jean-Luc Herve's ornery, high-pitched six-string static. It eventually climaxes into a hectic drone thrash (which doesx92t quite bury the odd screaming in the background), not unlike something that might happen at the end of a particularly bleak Godspeed You! Black Emperor song. I guess the only thing keeping me from really flipping over this CD is the way it all melds together in my head after I'm done listening. Unlike their debut, Shub Niggurath's final recordings went for an admirably dense method of madness as opposed to something more varied; still, their persistence and talent for molding a small array of timbres into almost symphonic mass is impressive. I wish they'd been able to continue, because at the very least, this CD is a testament to a band who were quite obviously not done experimenting. Go for Les Morts Vont Vite first, but know there's something to unearth here too.","Shub Niggurath arose from the pollution of a skewered kettle of semen and snot, fires raging around its crusted edges ...

Words,Homunculus,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c111abf31b7dc7156575/1:1/w_160/22cd7327.gif,2003-05-19 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3913-words/,Howling,"Homunculus is one of those words that's pretty much exited the English language over the years-- there really just arex92t that many opportunities to use it, and it sounds awkward in conversation unless you have John Cleese's accent. The modern definition is simple enough: ""n; a diminutive human,"" according to the American Heritage dictionary. But there's a second, archaic definition that I prefer: ""n; a miniature, fully formed individual believed by adherents of the early biological theory of preformation to be present in the sperm cell."" There's just something about the image in the second definition I find hilarious. Like, here's this little guy, piloting a sperm toward an egg, and when he gets there, he just starts expanding, like those dinosaur sponge things you got at the museum store when you were a kid. The theory is so obviously bogus on so many surface levels it's staggering. Who in any medical capacity in any era could seriously have looked at a baby and not noticed how different the physical proportions were from an adult? It's just absurd. This, of course, makes the name just about perfect for a band like Homunculus, who use absurdity and wit as their lyrical bread and butter. In fact, the wit of the writing can get a bit grating over the course of a full album, but taken individually, each of the ten songs on Words, this quintet's debut-- there are four of them on the album cover, but they're a quintet-- works pretty well. Actually, come to think of it, there's one exception, but we'll get to that in a minute. First, the things they do correctly. If there's one undeniable strength these five guys possess, it's the gift of melody. They whip out one ear-clobbering hook after another, going ten for ten with a couple extra-base hits for good measure. This is critical for a band whose musical formula is pretty conventional-- verses, choruses, the occasional bridge, and fairly steady instrumentation-- so every song here has to hold up its end or things get boring really fast. ""Here and There"" establishes the sound right away: Ben Doepke's prominent piano licks pass the chords while drums and auxiliary percussion serve up a bouncing rhythm and double tracked vocals spread melody into every available nook. The spins on this formula range from the Caribbean cocktail piano that dominates ""Deep South Beach"" to the smokier R&B; of ""Time in a Can"", which owes a lot of its success to Adam Schoex92s melodic bass line and the band's close harmonies. ""Walking Home"" supports detailed lyrics about losing out on a bus ride for lack of sufficient pocket change with a bass and percussion pattern that actually approaches fusion, cut through with weird, echoing synthesizer. The best song on hand, though, is ""When Sheila Dances"", which marks a huge step forward lyrically with its surrealist imagery and vivid description. ""When Sheila Dances she lights on fire/ And through the laughter she melts like butter,"" ""The world is merely a book of matches/ He wants her spirit/ He wants her ashes."" The song's smoothly delivered minor key melody is entrancing, and easily the album's highlight. On the other end of the spectrum, though, is ""Stargazing"", which opens with the non-sequitur ""Stargazing from the bathroom/ Naked astronaut,"" and continues with what seems like an unsuccessful attempt to break down the effects of weightlessness on love and some other stuff that I'm not really clear on. What it all adds up to is a semi-solid debut spiked with a bit a bit of potential. The album's production has a sort of neutering smoothness to it, which will likely put off a good many prospective fans (and dropped this rating a bit as well), but the composition and performance really cax92t be denied. At the very least, Homunculus are pretty well formed at this nascent stage, and could develop into a pretty formidable band very quickly.","Homunculus is one of those words that\x92s pretty much exited the English language over the years-- there really just ...

An Angel Moves Too Fast to See: Selected Works 1971-1989,Rhys Chatham,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58d9d034d5c69bf3313/1:1/w_160/72c34b1e.jpg,2003-05-18 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1408-an-angel-moves-too-fast-to-see-selected-works-1971-1989/,Table of the Elements,"There can be only one King of New York. Ask Christopher Walken. Even when Dubya visited the smoking holes at Ground Zero, he deferred to then-King Rudy Guiliani. So it goes in the art world: who else but Matthew Barney could command the entire Guggenheim and have Björk sire his child? New York sets up more of a duality in its music worlds: there's always contention and tension in the air of premieres, the two lords evenly matched and equally powerful, landing formidable punches with each new expression. In jazz you have John Zorn and William Parker; way back when, it was Bird and Diz blowing, first together, then at crosswinds. Unearthed tapes from folks like Tony Conrad, John Cale, and Charlemagne Palestine continually contest the supposed reign of minimalist La Monte Young; into the seventies, Steve Reich and Phillip Glass were upping the inverse ante with their ensemble sizes (6 marimbas to 12 Parts to 18 Musicians). In the eighties, it was the rock muck of Sonic Youth and Swans, exchanging asphalt-hard blows on audiences' ears like long-banged champs. Further underground, there was the guitar-symphony battle for supremacy between avid pupil Glenn Branca and teacher Rhys Chatham, an arms race of detuned six-strings building up to Hundred Guitar Armies the likes of which Tommy Garrett never imagined during the cold war-- Branca even marched them through the World Trade Plaza way back in the early 21st Century. While leaner Branca has released ten symphonies on disc, master Chatham has been neglected. Consider this the Equalizer. The Bomb. Chatham's got The Box. \x93Two Gongs\x94 opens this set, a piece composed in 1971 but appearing here as documented in 1988. It seems simple, even in the hazy dawn of American Minimalism; less concerned with the piano patterns of Terry Riley and La Monte, and more with the pure physicality of sine waves pursued by Maryann Amacher and Charlemagne Palestine in their electronic work, Chatham found as much kif-kin in each hit of Chinese gongs as he did in his work with the early Buchla synthesizer (the cornerstone technology of the Intermedia Center at NYU in the late sixties). The resulting investigation of these gongs sounds not so much like an idealized Music of the Spheres as it is a ""Music of Two Enormous Fucking Ball Bearings the Size of Jupiter Grinding Together like Electric Teenagers"". Heavenly, yes, but with enough sharp metal shavings and distorted sparks as to spray in your eyes over its sixty minutes. For those who won't find an hour's worth of gong vibration invigorating, head directly to disc two. Buzzing and bursting forth with six guitars on \x93Die Donnergötter\x94, Chatham's motley crew-- featuring future Illbient-blower Ben Neill, ex-Modern Lover Ernie Brooks, Susan Stenger from Band of Susans, and the Dictators' drummer-- plows down a speedy superhighway of black tar rock and roll, paving the space between Televisiox92s ascendant Marquee Moon and Neu!'s motorik downbeat. The overlapping dust storms of tones kicked up by way of the guitar stretch far over the horizon of detuned, droning rock, a point reiterated over and over again as the set continues. Aside from the Lee Renaldo-penned epiphany from 1977, wedged into the 140-page booklet, ""Guitar Trio"" succinctly lays out the career trajectory for Sonic Youth in eight sustaining minutes. With David Linton providing a kicked-kit push on drums, three open-tuned guitars let flow pure, humming-head streams that quickly become a current of cascading electrified overtones and sheer delight. From this body of sonic wash came all other noisy guitars for the next thirty years, to fill their respective canteens: Mars, Theoretical Girls, Band of Susans, Ut, Swans, and the aforementioned Youth, even latter day practitioners of sonic overload ranging from My Bloody Valentine to the Trail of Dead. No matter who it inspired, the piece proves that no one quite had the vessel-- the distillation process-- much less quenched any thirst for tone overload quite like Rhys during those hectic times. The fact that the third guitarist on this piece (Branca) would explore the same ideas to even greater success reveals the wellspring Chatham had loosed in New York City. \x93Drastic Classicism\x94 is far more fast and furious than its ""minimal"" tag would lead you to believe. Four chariots roll on fiery Brimstone tires in a savage Drive Like Jehu drag race; the noise on these tracks is more than most ensembles could ever hope to hit, but not even Jehu could keep up with these gear changes, flowing and grinding until the wheels fall off, even burning through the re-entry that \x93Eliminator Jr.\x94 brought at the end of Daydream Nation. Variables focused on in previous works-- volume, trajectory, velocity-- culminate in Rhys' final revelation of electric guitar with the title work, \x93An Angel Moves Too Fast to See"". Scored for one hundred guitars and toured throughout Europe, it's the only one of three such pieces that has ever been documented, premiering here. Despite the sheer impossibility of recording one hundred guitars and accurately conveying that force, there are huge movements from the group, roving from Chatham's classic colossal bustle into \x93Interstellar Overdrive\x94-like drift, even into a curious place that resembles...a hundred dudes playing the opening punches of \x93Eye of the Tiger\x94. Dump out his peripheral role-playing: the work with Morton Subotnick in the sixties, his time tuning harpsichords and pianos for the likes of Glenn Gould and La Monte Young, founding venerated music outlet The Kitchen and introducing Canal Street bludgeonings of electric guitar to academic minimal marks. Even if you're feeling Spartan, cutting out all the non-guitar works here (as most of his focus these days lies in brass), you'd still have a huge reckoning with one of the downtown greats looming larger than the Federal Reserve building. Chatham is huge, and that the box grasps so much of that significance makes it a crowning achievement.","There can be only one King of New York. Ask Christopher Walken.

Shine,Daniel Lanois,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d813d1975652138717/1:1/w_160/067b35f1.jpg,2003-05-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4950-shine/,Anti-,"Daniel Lanois' third solo album Shine-- the first since his decade-old For The Beauty Of Wynona-- is difficult to swallow, and not because of any challenging experimentation, politics, or off-kilter production. None of that, nah. What got me nervous about this album is that, for his reputation, it's the most drab, adult-oriented product to make it to my stereo since some Starbucks-sipping visitor got sentimental about the Magnolia soundtrack. ""Those frogs were symbolic!"" he cried, and asked me to bow with him before his shrine to Aimee Mann. It's here we enter the world of the tame, a land where Sting is king and Phil Collins is raucous. It's the bottled atmosphere of Borders, the safety a slightly left-wing baby boomer craves as they sip tea and read bestsellers about other baby boomers. It's Jeff Healey. Lanois writes somewhat catchy, almost moody stuff, but when I say ""moody"" I mean like a CEO gets moody when there isn't enough whole milk in his latte. My dad's a nice man. I imagine him not only liking Shine, but also finding it soothing; he could downright chill to this. If pops and I were resting on his overstuffed couch, the few things on Shine I enjoyed-- faint bells during the first minute of ""I Love You"", off-key guitar, chimes, a pedal steel-- wouldn't make an impression on him, while the many things he'd love-- ""This reminds me of a less crazy Astral Weeks!""-- would have me flashing back to the summer I interned at Musician Magazine, brewing weak coffee for Rush fans with fake tans and male-pattern-baldness ponytails. The production on Shine is beyond clean: slide guitar winds in like a coma, tumbleweeds bounce into the sky, a creepy voice exhales and makes me jump. Layers and distances are detailed, but nothing overlaps or crowds, always shiny. Anesthetic, like a commercial. Lanois produced the record himself, and if you don't know his name, he also produced Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind, Peter Gabriel's So and Us, and U2's The Joshua Tree and All That You Can't Leave Behind, to list but a few of his credits. So no, I'm not talking DIY: his microphones probably cost more than my apartment. Maybe you're a better person than I am, maybe you can hurdle the squeaky-clean production. Answer me this: do you find the Counting Crows moving? If so, you're halfway there. Aside from the overproduction, the songwriting is pat: none of the tracks deviate from what's laid out in the first stanza: ""No need to worry about surprises, sir/ Just sit back and relax, sir."" Three of the four instrumentals are decent, clean versions of Will Oldham's Odes, while ""Space Key"" takes the ghostly atmospherics of ""Transmitter"" and ""JJ Leaves L.A."", including a drum machine so crisp, it's as if you're forever riding into the sunset, leaving town on 70mm stock. What Lanois always has, no matter what he brings to the table personally, is star power. Emmylou Harris offers backup on the album opener, ""I Love You"", and Bono chimes in with a mellow vocal turn on the second track, ""Pretty Falling At Your Feet"". The sunglassed one wrote the track with Lanois during the All That You Can't Leave Behind sessions; for all his shallow pomposity, Bono can be tolerable-- even pretty-- when he isn't trying to pretend he's smarter than he is. What does Lanois himself sound like? He sounds like everyman-- he's French Canadian. No accent; he could be a newscaster in the Heartland. There's no doubt he's an accomplished producer, but he drops the ball trying to communicate anything other than light-weight, overextended metaphors: ""My tremolo, you're my fire...what keeps me walking is your shine."" His odd musings are especially grating because he mixes the vocals so high. Final litmus test: in the liner notes Lanois writes, ""What a privilege to be able to make music.Here is a small portion of what's cooking in the kitchen. I hope that some piece of it will elevate your spirit. May we all touch a heart somewhere, sometime."" Your gut reaction to his best wishes is a solid indication of how palatable you'll find Shine.","Daniel Lanois' third solo album Shine-- the first since his decade-old For The Beauty Of Wynona-- is difficult to swallow ...

Southernunderground,CunninLynguists,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ba13d1975652139254/1:1/w_160/53c98aed.jpg,2003-05-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1689-southernunderground/,Freshchest,"Southern rap is one of the most distinct subgenres in existence. Searching for buried booty or bass? I'm sure some guy named Papa Dadfather or Gold Card Grinder can point you in the right direction, but hold on to your alligator-skin bathrobe, Bear Bryant-- the crimson tide has turned! By way of Georgia, Kentucky, and Florida, the CunninLynguists have been operating in a different hip-hop realm than their geographical brethren. Will Rap For Food (2001) was a solid, accessible debut, filled with clever rhymes and tremendously consistent production, and the deservedly strong support system it garnered had fans hoping Deacon and Kno (now accompanied by SOS) would someday realize their potential and drop a certified gem on the masses. When Southernunderground was finally announced for this year, eyes widened. Kno proves himself one of hip-hop's preeminent producers on this record, handling the beat duties on nearly every track. He exquisitely sets up backdrops to match the lyrical subject matter: the bass heavy first-half of \x93Raix94 props up a drifting piano line, soon pushing into a splash of building cymbals. And just like it's hot, everything drops out into Sir Elton John crooning, ""Wise man say/ Looks like rain today."" Captain Fantastic has never sounded so distressing. ""Falling Down"" is Kno's masterpiece, tracing three separate tales of domestic and workplace woe, each exploding midway into perverted destruction. Devoid of any subtlety (gunshots and screams abound), the kick-drum goes berserk as each emcee snaps. This is a drum-and-bass firestorm that practically drowns the vocals of Deacon doing his best Michael Douglas impression: ""Muthafucka is my one car really halting movement?/ I got some powerful shit in my trunk, want me to use it?"" Other production highlights include the slippery jazz guitar in ""Doin' Alright"", as well as its blissful second interlude-- just thirty seconds of that shames a horde of current beatsmiths. It makes the RJD2 contribution ""Seasons"" (incidentally the lead single) sound lazy and heartless. Domingo's title track feels redundant after just one verse. With all due respect to Deacon and SOS, the CunninLynguists would be nothing without Kno. He is in a league of his own-- when it comes to production. The point of contention on Southernunderground is the vocals. On a technical level, Deacon, SOS, and Kno (yes, rapping) are all lyrically adequate, and there isn't much to complain about delivery-wise, either, but the downfall to this album is something the dudes can't help: their voices. Deacon and SOS are virtually indistinguishable in tone, not to mention vocabulary; at times, Kno begins to sound like the Swollen Members' Madchild (and that's not a compliment). His sincerest lines can fall flat, even over the most disquietingly affecting tracks. When he tries to come through on upbeat party jamz (""The South""), all I hear is a clumsy excitement that sounds like someone scored Mom's Lexus for Friday night. Also, sampling brutally distinct voices between their own (Big Pun, Andre 3000, etc.) makes the guys sound even less convincing. Call it contemptuous, but Southernunderground finds ways to get under my skin in its subject matter as well. After hearing lines like ""Let me rub some lotion on your cleavage,"" how can I take contemplation on romantic depression (""Love Ain't"") seriously? Look at the beginning of ""Old School"" too: ""New jacks?/ Y'all some new jacks!/ We Old School."" While the song humorously delves into hanging out with Henry VIII and Einstein, early ""teacher"" posturing always turns me off. Couple this with the album title, and all I can be reminded of is an MTV2 commercial showing a bunch of goons on Market St. drooling out phrases like ""Yeah...underground. Elevate the music...beats and rhymes."" Aligning themselves with this generic self-reference and ""authentication"" is superfluous. I don't want to sell this album short, though: Southernunderground contains the most reliable production of the year thus far. Yes, the CunninLynguists are capable on the microphone, and their voices could go over just fine to you. If you subscribe at all to the theory that ""an album is only as good as its production,"" buy it. Apologies if the group poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this one, and I don't know it the means to it are maturity or Kno ghostwriting, but mark my words: some day, the CunninLynguists will release a flawless record.","Southern rap is one of the most distinct subgenres in existence.

In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust,Joan of Arc,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0613d197565213afb7/1:1/w_160/a15f53dd.jpg,2003-05-18 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4267-in-rape-fantasy-and-terror-sex-we-trust/,Perishable,"Glorified/vilified: I don't give a shit what anyone thinks of Tim Kinsella. I don't care if he's pretentious, I don't care if he does retarded airplane dances onstage, I don't care if he squats over a mirror with two fingers up his ass. I don't care if his self-martyring lyrics are written and performed for the sole purpose of getting pussy, or if he's a tortured genius making esoteric-surreal-referential art, or if he wrote this entire album while sniffing rails of coke and listening to Louis Armstrong records (whose voice he approximates on ""No Corporate News Is Good News"", and which is probably one of the most offensive/creepy moments on In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust). I'm just glad he's given up the gory melodrama of How Memory Works, even if that means we get the fractured poetic dadaist freakout stuff on recent JOA records-- including Rape Fantasy-- instead. The fact is, Tim Kinsella is a figurehead in the realm of independent music because of the vehement reaction of his critics, fans, and deriders. There's just no in between: people either love him with frothing passion or hate him with ferocious vitriol, to the point that he matters at least as much as any other artist in the increasingly gray area of what we call indie rock, purely because of indie rock's cultural reaction to him. So. In interviews, Kinsella has said this record consists of outtakes from their February full-length So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness-- the ones that Jade Tree thought sucked. This is a cursed way for a piece of art to come into the world, with the knowledge of being unwanted and second-best. But one lady's trash is another lady's treasure, as they say, and to me, the cache of ""weird"" songs on Rape Fantasy is better than the tracks collected on Staying Alive. Maybe it seems stronger because there's less pained singing and more instrumentation, which can be awfully pretty at times (even when it oscillates in noise wankouts), or maybe it's because of the personas Kinsella tests out on different tracks: he sings, ""Ignorance is my privileged right,"" in a protest of American apathy and suddenly, he's Frank Zappa; the aforementioned Louis Armstrong impression is, if nothing else, uncharted territory; and then there's Tim's old failsafe, the grating, wailing juvenile toddler, which he's channeled at every opportunity for the better half of Joan of Arc's career. Kinsella's toddler persona comes directly to the fore on ""Happy 1984 and 2001"", as he begins intoning the ""shadow government"" chorus in that scrawly whine (you know the one), and then lists other kinds of shadows in a children's theater-style singsong (""sidewalk shadow, cowboy shadow, BBQ shadow, hackeysack shadow)-- a sort of ""Now I Know My ABC's"" of the illuminati. Kinsella's harped on the government a lot recently, which fits in nicely with his contempt for authority (boyhood Catholicism seems to be at the core of ""Dinosaur Constellations Part 1"", when he repeatedly screams, ""God is the bomb""), and also with his inner conspiracy theorist. But you know. I don't care about those things. Here's what I do care about, really: a semblance of human emotion, a snippet of beauty, a boatload of comedy, some musical friction and a good story. In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust-- and by extension, Tim Kinsella-- possesses those things at varying points, and sometimes all at once. On ""Them Brainwash Days"", someone credited as ""Ingersol Torniquet"" reads unintelligible poetry while a graceful guitar blossoms quietly, a steady drum beats, and a piano unfurls-- and to paraphrase Kinsella, it's just nice. On ""Them Heartache Nights"", austere vocal samples and another burst of pretty guitar fill out the emotion requirement. In the simple beauty of these moments, the question has to be asked: what could Joan of Arc accomplish if they tossed aside their shock-rock tactics and primal scream therapy, and aimed for this instead? It seems to me that when they're just spazzing the fuck out, it's not for a lack of talent on the behalf of the players-- which, this time out includes members of Califone, Friend/Enemy, 90 Day Men, Ghosts and Vodka, Chicago Underground, Bent Leg Fatima, and just about every other Chicago-based indie session player you can think of-- it's just a lack of attention span. The formula is for everyone to play what sounds like random measures at once; it's not about applying the aesthetics of free jazz to indie rock, so much as getting a bunch of kids on Kool-Aid to jam out together in the basement. The results are never brilliant or violently disagreeable-- just kind of funny and weird. In Rape Fantasy is more of a curio than anything-- think of it as Duchamp's suitcase meets Richard Pryor's Bicentennial Nigger.

(Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves,Hawksley Workman,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa7013d1975652139a36/1:1/w_160/a3f72cf4.jpg,2003-05-15 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8737-last-night-we-were-the-delicious-wolves/,Ba Da Bing,"All eyes are on him. He's wounded and wailing, but then he abruptly takes command; he quivers vulnerably, his voice warbling as his heart deflates, and then he roars his demands, like a lioness that follows orders without hiding her claws. Hawksley Workman assaults his songs with butch sexual charge, the camp and flamboyance of a junior league pop diva-- so much that, well, not to question anyone's identity, but he's gotta be, you know, British. Workman actually hails from the less glamorous nation of Canada. In the strange, maybe made-up biography on his website, he writes that he's a country boy whose life changed when he moved to the city and took up residence in a dance studio. Working day and night to earn his keep and learn his art, he became a dancer who has held the Dutch Royal Family in his thrall. And after learning to sing and collecting some garish stage outfits, he took up a new career as a burgeoning international pop star, with three records under his belt: For Him and the Girls, a Christmas album called Almost a Full Moon, and now (Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves. Far and away his greatest strength is his voice. Owing some influence to idols like Bowie or Freddie Mercury, his style has been compared to Britain's 70s glam pop age: his sexual energy encompasses and then tosses aside plain old macho cock-rock. Whether caterwauling through ""You and Me and the Weather"", moaning low like Robert Plant, or barking orders to an anonymous plaything in ""Striptease"", Workman not only possesses chrome-plated pipes, but the style to use them. Workman recorded this album almost entirely by himself at home: that's him hammering out the tight piano part on ""Jealous of Your Cigarette"", or working the guitar like he's humping a pole. Ditching the folk and country tinge that colored his first album, the music goes from a rhythm-and-blues urgency to drawn-out almost schmaltzy musical theater. But even if Workman's putting just about everything he has into performing this music, the material he wrote can't keep up: it just jogs along while he's singing up a storm; and for someone who can spew purple prose-- he's even published a book of love letters, Hawksley Burns for Isadora-- the lyrics range from lurid and rambling, to obvious and dull. ""I'm jealous of your cigarette/ And all the things you do with it,"" works as not-too-subtle camp, but later in the song he spells out the innuendo (""...and how you want to suck on it), and that's just gauche. Although the singles that kick off the disc are almost lunkheadedly blunt, they still carry more charge than the later songs which, while smart and often catchy, are strangely defanged. ""Clever Not Beautiful"" is actually neither, running on seemingly forever; the piano ballad ""Lethal and Young"" tries to sum up the perils of youth, but ends up just waving a finger at them. Even though there are charming melodies on songs like ""Your Beauty Must Be Rubbing Off""-- almost every track is well-honed and catchy-- Workman gets too cute and puckish; end-to-end the record grows cloying, losing the edge that the first few songs promised. Where's that tension, the ambiguous charge that sends your neckhairs crawling? The album hints at something worthy of Workman's craftsmanship and charisma: something that aches more, or shows less, or doesn't sound so damn theatrical. As is, it doesn't dig deep enough into what drives him; is this erotic and raw, or is it just needily pawing at us?","All eyes are on him.

Single One EP / Single Two EP,Papa M,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe6c0084474cd0bfa2b/1:1/w_160/bbf80cc7.gif,2003-05-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11799-single-one-ep-single-two-ep/,Drag City,"In his 22nd year of music-making, Dave Pajo rules your whole family, holmes. He can do li'l wrong: the man had Drag City release his own farthing (in their catalog as DC170-COIN). What instrument can this Robotussin messiah not play? What ice-warm and bed-cold tone can he not engineer? What album bears his prints that isn't wondrous? (Okay, besides the Zwan one?) Listening to Pajo-related projects is the only thing that helps America get through what commercial radio calls its ""workdays"" more pleasurably than sneaking human obituaries into Petloss.com's registry of patriotic domesticated dead. And glory be, Pajo squirts out singles like a tomcat does bastards. Better still: in order to survive Zwan's ""Siamese Cream"" road haul, Pajo plans to release a series of six three-song ""AudioTour Diary"" EPs this year-- the first two of which will be celebrated momentarily. Those of us who remember the fun of singles clubs and of chasing down rare comps and ""vinyl"" (before Soulseek democratized thangs for dispassionate posers computer-labwide) can almost get excited, almost! Seems like every day I'm stooping to homeburn a Best of Papa M singles comp for some moody apprentice. Pajo practically gives us fans no choice-- how else can we include the crucial cuts from his three-inch single or his split-45s on long rental-sedan trips to our siblings' divorces? Dare the Papa end my copyright-infringing ways by packaging these as a double album someday, as the Wedding Present did with their Hit Parades? Shiiit, you throw in some prestigious liner notes by David Fricke, and I'd buy a permission slip to buy the thing. Single One kicks off with ""Flashlight Tornado"", and though the music is the vintage mix of acoustic guitar, accordion, and keyboards usually associated with Papa M, you know something's up because Pajo sounds happy. Those who arrived at his work by way of his dour Drag City kindred, brace yourself for when he insists that ""we do more than just survive."" He evens goes Disney for the chorus: ""Skippity do/ Skippity dee/ Doo rye yea."" Hang your sundresses on the nearest antler, ladies, because Papa M's getting ready to bust out of his subtle-moan shell. How can Pajo top his covers of The Misfits, Cat Stevens, Daniel Johnston, Bob Dylan, and Jerry Jeff Walker? Not by covering unknowns-- he already did that. So he covers himself, dogs. The revisited version of ""Beloved Woman"" is straight-up ghostly. The original (from Whatever, Mortal) started Smog-ominous and then went beatific with some vocal help from Will Oldham; here, Pajo removes the song's scaffolding and underbelly, and the result is nigh spiritual. All my laziness wants to say that its curdling violins recall a requiem-for-a-spleen battle between Kronos Quartet and Rachel's, but then Pajo comes in with that harmonica. Don't shoot me for heralding the arrival of chamber post-folk, because you'll swoon when you hear it. Then he's back to covering others to end Single One and initiate Single Two. Draining the blues from Reverend Gary Davis' ""I Am the Light"", Pajo fashions an impressive gather-round ballad that's philosophically cousin to cohort Oldham's appropriation of D.H. Lawrence's ""The Risen Lord"". By the traditional ""Black Is the Color"" (as in ""of my true love's hair""), only die-hard fans (I'm guilty) will still be awake. Even the sci-fi keyboards don't distinguish this from Pajo's surfeit of dirge material, and the lasting power of popular renditions-- such as the one by the recently deceased Nina Simone-- don't help, especially when Pajo's cover devolves into a spoken word piece, with one loop of Pajo saying ""black black black"" and the other saying ""black is the color"" like he forgot he wasn't covering Kurtis Blow's ""Basketball"". The piano-and-strings ""Mary Was the Kind"" sounds like an outtake from the Songs of Mac EP, and provides a window to Pajo's songwriting formula: he crafts an inescapable, lilting, usually cyclic (repetitive if you're not feeling generous) atmosphere, mutters over it with some lame poetry (""I offered her a postcard written in the ink of the sea,"" or ""Release the birds from my pillow"") and then he buttons the thing with a profound abstract assertion (""We change without choice""). Whew. Consider me whipped. ""World's Greatest Sin"" is upbeat, brisk, tuneful and casually, cleverly randy, but it wasn't enough, I thought, to save a lackluster single, until the guitar-and-strings bonus track stirred around the 12-minute mark and was so gorgeous it cured my chronic dyspepsia, eyebags and all. It's just, uh, derr... damn pretty. What do you want? So I'm not technically astute like my friend who can tell you what notes are being played and how; I'm an ""impressionistic"" music critic, okay? You win. My job's to compare the guitars to horses and get the fuck out of their way.","

Songbook,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71dc0084474cd0c0aff/1:1/w_160/495eff78.jpg,2003-05-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7918-songbook/,Bubble Core,"This is such a beautiful record on paper. On his third album in the last six months, Japan's Nobukazu Takemura closes his laptop, sits down with partner Aki Tsuyuko, and makes an album of songs backed with (mostly) acoustic instruments. In the past, Tsuyuko has provided the vocal inspiration for career highlights like ""Kepler"" and ""Wax & Wane"", though on the last couple of Takemura projects she's been replaced by processed and computer-generated voices. While not a technically adept vocalist (she's a keyboard player by training, and her own solo material is instrumental), Tsuyuko's simple and direct style has been the right accompaniment for Takemura's child's-eye view. Pairing the two over the course of an album sounds like heaven for admirers of twee electronics. Problems are evident on the opening ""Mirror Tower"", which is just Takemura's nylon-stringed guitar and Tsuyuko's voice. Tsuyuko's notes sound almost random, for one thing-- there's essentially no melody. It has a certain Shaggs-ish charm, I guess, in that it sounds ""innocent"" and so forth, but the track is all atmosphere and no song. Fortunately, ""Mahou No Hiroba"" is a terrific follow-up. There's still not much in the way of a tune, but ""Mahou No Hiroba"" is less about melodic development, and more of endless build through repetition. There's propulsion in the blend of acoustic guitars, vibes, organ and crisp jazz-style drums (which I believe are programmed); the way the song stacks its blocky chords almost seems like a gentle, discordant, far-East version of Stereolab's ""Jenny Ondioline"". This track is nine minutes long but doesn't seem it, and it's one of the best things Takemura has done. Unfortunately, nothing else here comes close to ""Mahou No Hiroba"". With 19 tracks running almost 80 minutes, Songbook is way, way, way too long, but that's come to be expected from Nobukazu Takemura. When he has a good idea he tends to drive it into the ground, making the listener tire of the track before it ends. But on Songbook, the good ideas don't come often enough. Roughly half the tracks sound like throwaways, nothing more than some clever instrumental flourishes laid beneath Tsuyuko's off-key warbling. I consider myself a pretty serious Nobukazu Takemura fan and I enjoyed Aki Tsuyuko's solo record, but I honestly can't understand what anybody could get from ""From the Ocean of Forest"", ""Tadpole in the Puddle"" or ""Obaoba""; there's just nothing there, no melody, harmony, hook or texture. Plenty of great tunes have come from singers who could only sing three or four notes, but all of these had someone behind them who knew how to use that handful of tones to their best advantage. Both Takemura and Tsuyuko sound utterly lost inside most of these tracks. There are a few exceptions, like ""Turutiksbinbon (Fr ver)"" (easily the best tune of the bunch, though the melody only lasts two bars and still goes on for 8+ minutes) and ""Uruu"" (which, with its thick organ and breathy vocals, reminds me a lot of Björk). These few highlights and the fantastic ""Mahou No Hiroba"" keep Songbook from being flat-out bad, but just barely. As an album of songs, Songbook fails. A major disappointment.","This is such a beautiful record on paper. On his third album in the last six\n\ months, Japan's ...

Jacknuggeted EP,Manitoba,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39213d197565213bd6b/1:1/w_160/42f1ceed.jpg,2003-05-12 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5079-jacknuggeted-ep/,Leaf,"Manitoba's Dan Snaith knows how to piece together records. I'm not talking about the quality of his music (though he's hitting his stride, and Up in Flames is definitely among the year's best), but his editing and sequencing skills. True to its 60s influences, Up in Flames is a tight and tidy 40-minute record, the kind that's so short and consistently good you can't help but wonder about the quality of the tracks that didn't make the cut. Because Snaith knows what he's doing, we can assume that some of the better also-rans would find release somewhere. This EP, in addition to containing one of the highlights from Up in Flames, contains three such tracks. But first there is ""Jacknuggeted"" itself, taken from the album. The simple acoustic guitar hook on the chorus is the first thing that sticks out. It's a jubilant, three-chord strum that sounds like something you might play a couple hours into your first time picking up the instrument, during that moment when you finally ""get"" how chords work together. It's got a virginal excitement to go with its archetypical pop structure, and the fact that Snaith backs it with an organ swell and a thicket of sitar-like sounds makes it even better. Handclaps, ba-ba vocals, a chopped, stutter-step break-- it's a lot to pack into 3\xBD minutes, but it works beautifully. The first time I listened to ""Olé"" it sounded like Snaith had omitted his version of ""Let's Go Away for a While"" from his own personal Pet Sounds. ""Olé"" is certainly more upbeat and aggressive, but something about its meandering, tuneful structure punctuated by periodic drum rolls (these being much heavier) seems akin to Brian Wilson's light classic. ""Thistles and Felt"" hearkens back to the first Manitoba full-length's interest in the sounds associated with innocence. Music box bells provide the center around which sampled strings, guitar, keyboards and drums revolve. Very much like the best of Up in Flames, ""Thistles and Felt"" is a traditional pop instrumental constructed by someone with a background in electronic music. That is, instead of relying on long melody lines laid over chord changes, ""Thistles and Felt"" is about instrumental addition and subtraction, a series of sonic swells and contractions. The six-minute ""Seaweed"" closes this brief EP. With its length and brooding intro, the track feels like it wants to be more substantial than the three tunes preceding it, but it's ultimately not as satisfying. A short glockenspiel melody is the focal point of the track, but somehow the hook isn't compelling enough to warrant the grandeur that surrounds it. Still, despite the ho-hum closer, Jacknuggted is still a smart little EP that shows Snaith had enough good material to pack Up in Flames completely if he was so inclined. His decision to include the B-sides on this EP instead elevates both records individually.","Manitoba's Dan Snaith knows how to piece together records. I'm not talking\n\ about the quality of his ...

Politics of the Business,Prince Paul,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1379d034d5c69bf28e4/1:1/w_160/0342b0de.jpg,2003-05-12 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6482-politics-of-the-business/,Razor & Tie,"I used to walk around in high school telling everyone-- teachers, hall monitors, Old Man O'Malley-- that Prince Paul was the greatest producer of all time, ever. I had a crush on him. The track record? Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this: three absolute masterpieces for De La Soul, Stetsasonic, Gravediggaz, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Psychoanalysis (What Is It?), A Prince Among Thieves, etc. Here's a man with the guts to push sampling boundaries to their limits, creating broad, sonically cluttered terrain that remain tidy enough to still be logically rapped over, and not to mention being hip-hop's re-inventor of the ""skit."" Despite ample success over nearly two decades, attempts are never made by others to emulate his sound; Prince Paul is constantly groundbreaking, and being the pioneer that he is, that shouldn't sound clichéd. Now, after severing ties with Tommy Boy, it's nice to see that the guts are still intact, and this time his audacity and valor are being used to... create a terrible album, on purpose! Like intentionally missing a free-throw to score an offensive tip-in for the win, Dew Doo Man fans are left scratching their heads, thinking, ""just how is this gonna work?"" Obviously no stranger to the concept album, Paul's meta-flavor this time around is to be, well, mediocre. Citing the liner notes, he lays out his feelings towards the state of the industry today: ""Hip-hop has remained stagnant... the level of greed has intensified. It's not about the music as much as what surrounds the music ($)."" That one gets an ""amen"" and a ""duh"" from me, as I'd like to think everyone reading this essentially regards that as a given. At least, though, a prominent face in hip-hop has taken an ""I'll be damned"" attitude if he doesn't do something about it. ""Record sales are like votes, it all counts,"" he states. ""Your purchases have the power to change the course of the music being made and sold."" Romanticizing aside, Paul still feels ""a good portion of people probably won't go beyond the surface of this album or care enough to even get the meaning or irony of this project."" After digging through every inch of it, I certainly have a grasp of what's being attempted; however, one can't help but think this thing was doomed from the start. The story begins with Paul (as himself) in a meeting. After going ""double wood"" with the first attempt, record exec Dave Chappelle demands a new album that will sell. The result is Politics of the Business, a record designed strictly for commercial success. Thus, the barbs the ""real"" Prince Paul is hurling at the music-machine are themselves what the industry is made of. These are the most insipid and undemanding creations he has ever come up with. It's difficult to approach an album like this without plodding into an indie/commercial discussion, but I'll try to let it be with just saying these songs would fit right in on some Hott-Baby-Boy-Urban-Traffic-Jam-Hour-Dude corporate radio show. In short, this is generic, blandly accessible hip-hop that goes absolutely nowhere. Trust me, if this review was rewarding whether or not Prince Paul achieved his goal, I'd crown him with a shiny 10-zillion.0 rating. Unfortunately, the concept just won't fly. Is this really the appropriate way to address the status of a genre that's on life support, or perhaps better yet, revive one that's already beyond the grave? The album is devoid of anything musically noteworthy. The synth horns of ""Not Tryin' to Hear That"" bash a hole into your skull; ""So What"" has a twangy organ line that's nauseatingly boring. The drum tracks in every song sound like they took ten seconds to program. One exception could be the acoustic neo-soul of ""Beautifully Absurd"", featuring poet-man W. Ellington Felton, but those drums are by far the only thing worth mentioning. Yes, I know production like this is the whole point, but what do you want from me? It sucks. Unfortunately, emcee contribution helps in name only. Some of hip-hop's most intimidating make appearances accurately showing industry dissatisfaction, including Chuck D, Ice-T, and the gravelly voice of DJ Premier, though only by way of brief skits. Verses from Guru, Trugoy, Planet Asia, Eric Sermon, and Masta Ace (to name a few) fit right in with the ""accessibility"" the record should contain, but that just means being dull. To quote Kardinal Offishall's chorus on ""What I Need"": ""We keep it hot when we up in the spot/ Every time when we on the grind/ Make it happen when you calling the shots/ Do you and I'm a do you mine."" Now that's effectively not saying nothing. Cynics that pass off the release as Prince Paul's last gasp, however, are missing the point. Honestly, the concept as a whole is clever, and I'm legitimately shocked that he would craft such an outing. He really pulls off a current (albeit boring) sound I didn't think he had in him. Musical evidence to prove his future hasn't been shaken for good-- aside from ""Chubb Rock Can You Please Pay Paul the $2200 You Owe Him (People, Places and Things)"", which only works due to the reuse of De La's ""Pease Porridge""-- is the album's final tune. After the proper sham ends, Paul tacks on ""The Way My Life Seems"", an elegantly dreary half-Pharcyde reunion with Tre and Fat Lip. The guitar splashes and thick bass aren't far removed from Dre circa '91. It must be reiterated that I know full well what Prince Paul is doing on Politics of the Business, but he's fighting fire with fire. His arm's too short to box with the industry gods. He set out to make a mediocre album, and succeeded admirably. Doing the unexpected, just as we've come to expect, at least one thing remains: Prince Paul is still my favorite producer.","I used to walk around in high school telling everyone-- teachers, hall monitors, Old Man O'Malley-- that\n\ Prince ...

Ride Paranoia,JR Ewing,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3313d197565213b018/1:1/w_160/1fd986d3.jpg,2003-05-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4309-ride-paranoia/,GSL,"As a kid I remember reading in the Guinness Book something about Van Halen being the loudest band in the world. Impressive. They displaced Deep Purple. I think Manowar might have it now. To be honest, I was never much taken by such shows of largess: all it meant was they could afford big amps. I got to thinking in terms of world records, though, while listening to Ride Paranoia, the second full-length by Oslo's JR Ewing. For its 34 minutes, vocalist Andreas Tylden screams at earsplitting levels, uncoiling insane vocalizations over Keith Moon drum theatrics so powerful, walls start to buckle and bend. With the right management Tylden could win decibel-blasting contests, take gold to Norway, display the shiny shit besides a couple of Happy Tom's stained sailor caps in Oslo's imaginary rock 'n' roll hall of fame. Since 1998, JR Ewing's caustically winded approach has been on the verge of breaking something: imagine drenched and heaving bodies caved-in from exertion, how eels supposedly implode after traveling hundreds of miles to spawn in the Sargasso Sea. Sonically, the purest comparison is Drive Like Jehu, or the louder factions of the Gravity Records roster-- maybe Clikatat Ikatowi. It'd seem Oslo's but a few miles north of San Diego. Ride Paranoia opens with a loose, sputtering guitar cable trying to establish a flow of electricity, which shifts into the manic drum roll, fill and sliced guitars of the fairly pitch-perfect ""Repetition Is Failure"". Within its onslaught, Tylden's backdrop pauses momentarily to make way for his shout of, ""Stop cutting the hair and start living for a change,"" after which the album-- doing speed-freak one-armed pushups-- happily avoids calming down or even taking much of a breather. Some songs might rely too much on dynamics to propel-- never focusing on much beyond their composition-- and as is often the case with rock of this sort, a few songs suffer from sameness. ""Naked Pavements"" is akin to an overlong Jawbreaker exercise where Blake pointlessly incorporates movie samples and spoken lyrics. The band's best at short blasts: the histrionics are already epic in scope by just existing so there's no need to drag them out with Unwound-like incidental jams. Usually, though, the sheer momentum of the playing overcomes (or rebounds from) such missteps. ""When You're Gone"" is the bottled energy of Behead the Prophet and The Locust, but waxing emotional and sappy. Hey, even the frantic get the blues, right? Despite the song's cheesy lyrical turns (""crimson flames running through my heart""), I dig Tylden's sap: his purple prose matches his determined delivery. ""Pre Summertime Blues"", for example, is equally spaz-core potent, but redeems the crimson flames line with: ""A comma counter just shot himself/ A sawdust trail leading nowhere."" Nice: the textual conjoining with the corporeal. In ""A Case of Evacuation"" Tylden goes on about how ""being broke is probably the best luxury."" The vocal line offers a few ""My Generation"" stutters and over-enunciations, reminiscent of Nation of Ulysses, torn suits and all. I ultimately prefer these Lou Reed-ish sick city poverty themes (""a sweet syringe lost in a haystack"") to the tales of woe-begotten broken hearts, no matter the curative powers of a song's dynamics. A cracked city is filled with human relationships, things broken (and broken things) on a larger scale. Ride Paranoia's cover depicts abandoned, placed-just-so instruments and amplifiers: the detritus of staged rock excess. Nothing actually looks destroyed, and instead of reading this as a contrivance, I saw it as a reality: some folks just can't afford to break their shit. So you choose your damage. Catharsis is achieved, the metaphor for rock 'n' roll energy is deposited, and you can use your wounded gear the day after next. Ride Paranoia is this intelligent obliteration.","As a kid I remember reading in the Guinness Book something about Van Halen being the loudest band in the ...

In a wintry forest, a human with a crudely pasted-on horse head embraces a dog, frost breath issuing from its snout. In the background are two wild boars, and upon contact with your cursor (mouseover, in the HTML parlance) the beasts lift off, rise several feet in the air and proceed to dangle there, irritated. It's not a terribly functional page-- one boar bears an MP3, another a video-- but it's one of the most distinctive I've ever seen, a formidable piece of art in itself. And the inevitable segue: I wish I could say the same about Goldfrapp or their new album, Black Cherry. The bestial spookiness is there-- disturbing woman-dog hybrids are all over the booklet, and ""Wolf Lady sucks my brain"" is actually a prominent lyric of the first single-- but that's it. This platter of overproduced come-hither electropop is a polyester successor to the band's silky 2000 debut Felt Mountain. Continuing the sartorial analogy, vocalist Alison Goldfrapp's purr is still decked out in the sexiest sonic lace money can buy: swooping string passages, languid sampler bleeps, whooshing pads, double bass. These are, by now, pretty rote signifiers of sophistication; while the loungy orchestration of Felt Mountain didn't raise any flags at the time, Black Cherry's oh-so-timely shift to electro beats will make many scream ""ambulance chasers!"" Add my reluctant voice to that growing chorus. From the title on down, the new CD tries hard to conjure an ambiance of languid sin-- opium, absinthe, vintage porn-- but that aesthetic is just a few steps from your average bachelor pad with a zebra throw and ceiling mirrors. In fact, that's where copies of this album will inevitably spin, a soundtrack to excruciatingly banal seduction. The songs themselves, though hard to see through all this velvet fog, are a grab bag of trendy tactics. The first single ""Train"" is an ancient shuffle, rendered in quantized beats and fuzzy synths. You may recall that Liz Phair used this idea on ""Baby Got Going"". Goldfrapp's lyrics (opening line: ""Plastic brain scar/ I want laser"") are probably supposed to bewilder, but instead they annoy. On the mellower end, the title track sounds like early Air, and ""Tiptoe""-- the strongest song on the record-- mightily recalls Tori Amos circa From the Choirgirl Hotel. (Pardon the barrage of direct and obvious comparisons, but the songwriting is faceless enough to warrant it.) It couldn't be more ironic, then, that it's Black Cherry and not its predecessor that's truly broken the Brit duo in the homeland, netting them a Top of the Pops appearance and a place in the charts. The bad news is that the opacity of Goldfrapp's intentions will turn against them: they could be first-class ironists, but that will hardly matter when Alison's soft coos begin to lull customers into buying $200 panties at Agent Provocateur.","I suspect it's somewhat mauvais temps, but let me first sing the praises of the Goldfrapp website-- more specifically ...

Next, the band comes along and declares that what would make the meal even better is to take all of those fowl elements and further stuff them into a Jayhawk, thus producing the final product, the jayhawkturducken! The meal is a symbol of how the group envelops the different elements of music available to them-- from folk, to rock, to Gram Parsons-influenced pop-- in such a way that is alternately enjoyable and excessively off-putting. This culminates in The Jayhawks' latest release, Rainy Day Music, which serves as a prime example of the trend. And as an added bonus, the jayhawkturducken is composed completely of fictional and non-fictional ""Byrds."" RS: Interesting, but somehow lacking. Maybe if you worked on the substance over style, you would have something a bit more pleasing and less... well... less bad. Sound advice friend. Sound advice. One can coast only so far on the semblance of a good idea, and even the best of people suffer from the albatross of their reputation. That said, Rainy Day Music is nothing if not a pleasant album. Steering away from the immediate gratification of their highly Beach Boys-inspired 2000 release Smile, the band comes full circle with a return to their alt-country roots in the tradition of Neil Young or The Flying Burrito Brothers. This is no more apparent than on ""Stumbling Through the Dark"", a Gary Louris and Matthew Sweet co-write, which starts the album off on an incredibly strong foot. Short and to the point, the song begins with a hint of 90s alt-rock before sliding into a breezy, banjo-driven chorus that's instantly accessible and hummable, apparent even in the bonus acoustic version tacked on to the end of the album. ""All the Right Reasons"" slows down the tempo a bit allowing the band to flex their harmonic power over the course of the affirming ballad before steering towards ""Save It for a Rainy Day"", a song that wouldn't be out of place on an Alex Chilton solo album. The following track, ""Eyes of Sarahjane"", gives a leash to the organ, which explores as best it can the areas not completely dominated by pointless guitar soloing and Louris' twangy tenor. ""One Man's Problem"" rounds out the satisfying first half of the album with its wavering bassline and breezy chorus where the guys drop benign rock lyric nuggets like, ""I don't expect you to see/ But she's important to me, babe/ I guess it's just one man's problem."" It's during the latter portion of the album that the music begins to suffer from what sounds like a mix of neglect and overcompensation. The Tim O'Reagan song ""Don't Let the World Get in Your Way"" sounds more like my little cousin-- hairbrush in hand-- singing along to David Bowie's ""Major Tom"". Other Louris written tracks such as ""Come to the River"", ""Madman"", and ""You Look So Young"" simply sound forced, pushing the combination of what constitutes alt-country and folk-rock to its limit of self-parody, and at times irreversibly crossing that line. A modicum of respect is salvaged with the bonus disc of material that accompanies the original release of the album. The mini-album, entitled More Rain, gives a more intimate glimpse at the band with the exclusive track ""Fools on Parade"" (originally released for Spanish magazine Rock Sound), and acoustic/demo versions of album cuts such as ""Reasons"" and ""Tampa to Tulsa"" that shed light on how great a songwriter Louris truly is. The inclusion of a live version of the beloved ""Waiting for the Sun"", off of the exemplary Hollywood Town Hall, is both a delight and a disappointment in that while it's undoubtedly one of the band's greatest songs it poignantly displays how circular the group's recordings have become. Rainy Day Music is ultimately the sound of a dog (or more appropriately a bird) chasing its own tail, content with plugging away at the same formula as long as there's still precedence for satisfying their musical niche.","Ryan Schreiber (RS): It just seems like a bit of a stretch is all I'm sayin'.

The Moon Boys,Iran,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97f5e6ef95969322993/1:1/w_160/8e0b7a70.gif,2003-05-11 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4122-the-moon-boys/,Tumult,"Relative anonymity functioned as an aesthetic safe haven for early, cassette-bound Sentridoh, pre-pre 4AD Mountain Goats, and the cryptic skree of dozens of lesser-known, hiss-ridden troubadours. Likewise, stream-of-the-cuff releases by tape labels like Shrimper, Catsup Plate, and Union Pole were defined by a hand-scribbled, super-arcane but friendly DIY mystique. Put the two parts together and the distorted, crackling sounds of faceless songwriters arrived unedited from darkened corners of small-town disorientation on an almost daily basis. It was a less populated network of obsessive discontents, documenting basements and sunken porches, entropy and broken relationships, via unadorned four-tracks, duct-taped guitars, and stolen elementary school cassette recorders. I don't know much about Iran beyond the obvious: they're from San Francisco, and are a trio. On the cover of their latest record, there's a dark-eyed girl in a flannel shirt resting below a painting of some ducks and mountains. The CD booklet is littered with ink drawings: a dragon, a squirrel eyeing pills or acorns, a crying baby, some kid with a swastika on his forehead and a fish in each hand, an elf with a rifle, a hand forming the shape of a gun, an amputated arm sprouting diamonds or moon rocks. The centerpiece is a collage of a winged child on a leather couch with a friend, who, obscured by his pal's wings, appears to be smoking. The back panel's marked with mixing directives, language for establishing a perfect sound: ""More dynamics over all (song to song and within song)."" I've re-read this at least fifteen times, yet nothing becomes clear. The Moon Boys is Iran's second album: it's a frost-bound anthology of claustrophobic hymns to leaving/not leaving, black eyes, hushed voices, windows, silence, the night, mirrors, and strangulation. While less sonically virulent than their self-titled debut, it remains spiraling and unfathomably dense as a documentation of plush, damaged interiority, twelve discordant halos soiling the carpet. Deft at shaping and repackaging noise, Iran pummel channels and burden eardrums while sneaking hooks through your skin: imagine Simon Wickham-Smith, Three Mile Pilot, and Goosewind collaborating with Arab Strap on muted/mutating pop, sung all at once by Wallpaper, Lou Barlow, and Elliott Smith. If that makes no sense, pretend you're listening loudly to Xiu Xiu, and this is what it sounds like from next door. The walls are thin; even the slightest motions bleed, confusing the space. ""The Moon Shines Bright"" strings together echoes of psych fireworks, and for whatever reason reminded me of a split lip. Maybe it's the ferocity of the guitar picking and drone, or the fucked-up-on-codeine vocals trying to paint stars black, to overload the world with personal darkness. It's tough finding an exact match, though I'm getting Luxurious Bags backed by Harry Pussy or Richard Youngs gone hard-ass bubblegum. ""Four Armed Star"" creates sub-textual fuzz with two sets of vocals, one like a fractured kazoo. Both are buried by a de-tuning of the environment; as in most of the tracks, certain notes and words are hidden, but at the center someone's threatening to leave or to stay. The largely instrumental ""Wuthering Heights"" is Heathcliff hanging Isabella's dog within a romantic geography of wind and bent trees, trumpet and clarinet across the grassy lea. I thought of Loren Connors tripping a landmine. Balancing psychosis and the erotic, the off-kilter, ever-spinning ""Fading Out"" is creepy and tender and catchy: ""I pull the sheets above my head/ I was hiding in your bed/ It made you laugh but I guess you'll still be leaving anyway."" The Moon Boys is fucking beautiful, a dizzying revelry, but also a scary, late-night lock-down. With repeated listens sounds bloom, open and deepen, and a story develops. Hooks disappear. Flubbed notes remain and turn dusty, then to prismatic gold. Dynamics unravel. Dew looks like piss. Air cuts out. Indistinct things distract from earlier fixations without detracting. It's hearing a far-off cry in a dark forest, or two blocks over in your own city, and knowing the next day you should've intervened. These are momentary transmissions from faulty cables, remaining long enough to declare a hook, break apart, disengage, then disappear. Thank you, Iran. Whoever you are.","Relative anonymity functioned as an aesthetic safe haven for early, cassette-bound Sentridoh, pre-pre 4AD Mountain Goats, and the cryptic skree ...

This Is the Glamorous,New Wet Kojak,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ebeb335119a49ed815/1:1/w_160/70f8def3.jpg,2003-05-11 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5778-this-is-the-glamorous/,Beggars,"I remember when New Wet Kojak were still but a humble side project toiling in the shadow of Girls Against Boys, a smoother, slinkier sideshow to GVSB's rumbling main event. That was, however, eight years ago, and a lot has changed since then. GVSB tanked on the utterly plastic and lifeless Freakonica way back in 1998, and they've only just begun to regain any steam with last year's slight return You Can't Fight What You Can't See. Meanwhile, New Wet Kojak have released a string of great albums, to the point where they're now even more consistent than GVSB ever were. This Is the Glamorous is the band's fourth full-length since vocalist Scott McCloud and bassist Johnny Temple began seeing other people, and it's definitely got a shinier wax job than any of their previous albums, but where their other band was choked nearly to death by overproduction, this one fairly thrives on it. McCloud could hardly be described as melodic, but his distinctive declamations sound fantastic in New Wet Kojak's greasy-haired soup of thumping backbeat, laser synth and freaky sax. The band rides in triumphantly on the kinetic guitar and blorping bass of ""The World of Shampoo"", with Charles Bennington's harmonized sax channeling Morphine's Dana Colley and McCloud's slightly gruff sing-speak riding easily in the fore. ""Supermodel Citizens USA"" is positively anthemic by this band's standards, surging in its choruses on the back of some great guitar and piling on the tension in the verses until it becomes almost overpowering. With its fat bassline and cloud of sax, ""Nothing You Can Say"" picks up the Morphine ball and runs with it, piling on electronics for good measure, but Bennington's best moments come amidst the whooping synth noises and rock-steady rhythms of ""Something Easy"". His sax burns on multiple tracks in the background, some of them distorted, others writhing in free jazz ecstasy. It's been said in these pages multiple times before (including once in reference to this very band) that the sax is definitely due for a comeback in rock. If you require evidence of that claim, just check out the songs I just mentioned, or the record's closer ""Reverse the Curse"", which overflows with a rich sax arrangement that absolutely makes the song. There are a few curious moments on This Is the Glamorous that make me wonder if this project is starting to run out of ideas, chief among them being ""Jealous"". The album title originally appeared in the band's catalog three years ago in a line from ""The Overkill"", the second song on the excellent Do Things. Strangely, the band recycles the line over and over in ""Jealous"" here, which is odd, because the phrase really doesn't mean much to begin with. Thankfully, though, the band remains utterly conscious of their own sleazy/scenester come-on schtick, as evidenced by the nonchalantly delivered lyrics of ""Let's Get Glorified"", where a bored-sounding McCloud offers, ""I hear you're hanging out/ And stuff/ Hanging out/ Et cetera/ Doing a lot of bad things."" It's as though he wants to care, but can't quite bring himself to. So let the word go out, good people: New Wet Kojak are still in the game. This Is the Glamorous isn't their best (that's still Nasty International), but it's a solid entry into the canon of a surprisingly long-lived band, one that seems destined to outlive its own roots.","I remember when New Wet Kojak were still but a humble side project toiling in the shadow of Girls Against ...

A report on the known mutant Terrence Tessora, or ""Tes"", filed this day May 11th, 2003, by Spec. Agent Julianne Shepherd. Abstract:
On the recovered document x2, Tes' uncanny powers were found to include: 1. the ability to spit words faster than the speed of sound; 2. the ability to spit said words in a youthful, nasally, sing-songy voice, for long periods of time without oxygen; 3. the ability to make beats appear light and minimal, yet be heavier than bricks; 4. x-ray vision. It is apparent Tes was not born a mutant; however, the origin of his mutations is still under debate. (Note: in previous reports, Tes himself has noted a change may have occurred at a ""roller rink"" while hearing Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock"" for the first time; UNDER INVESTIGATION.) According to the dossier, said mutant has been living out his identity undercover; specifically, in the labyrinthine fronds of the Brooklyn underground rap scene. Known associates: Vast Aire (of the known ""Cannibal Ox"" cell) and Afra (a Japanese mutant with the ability to make awesome percussive noises by using his mouth, lips and tongue). In the x2 document, the names ""LoDeck"" and ""DJ Ese"" (investigate: magneto?) came up more than once as conspirators in Tes' mission. This special agent believes x2 to be a highly advanced form of communication. In addition to the subject's vocal powers, whose cadences play a choppy kind of ""jump-rope"" code we have yet to decipher, Tes' musical system is also relatively unique. Whereas many previously recovered audio documents have merely been crude or one-dimensional keyboard transmissions, Tes has developed a way to combine a minimalist code of rhythms with a delicate aesthetic of melody, often including crackles and whirs derived from ancient human appliances, such as the ""turntable."" We believe its simple, ominous beauty is meant to throw infiltrators off its trail, while still transmitting information to those advanced mutants who have become familiar with the dialect of ""underground rap"" and the ongoing experiment known as ""Warp-touched hip-hop."" We have seen similar types of transmissions in several other cells-- including those on the ""fresh coast,"" and those operating out of the New York metro area. This geographic connection may in fact be a key to understanding Tes and his fellow operatives, though at times, the subject inflects a tone found in cells of a more southerly location. In the most compelling file, characterized by a humid, soulful melody and marked simply ""New New York"", Tes uses his voice to transmit the following powerful message: ""If you listen to Tes, you know where I'm from/ Fuck where you at, I'm the original one."" This home-base pride permeates the message of many other files in x2, such as ""Late to Work"", which combines a certain work ethic (""Fool Time"": ""Don't watch the clock, it's a waste of time/ And even if they pay you, don't make it by nine"") with a feeling of societal imprisonment (""My Receiver"": ""Get compelled/ To propel/ Steppin' through hell/ Tramplin' the fate I was dealt/ Saw both sides but didn't like either/ Chose to block out both with the sound of my receiver/ Good and evil always push their presence on the scene."" The Agency believes this to be a direct communication.) Conclusion:
While potentially dangerous to ""other emcees,"" Tes' x2 document could be an important comrade in human/mutant unity. NOTE: other agents on our team were concerned with the transmission ""I've changed/ Extended my brain/ [indecipherable] Satellite strike like war games/ In the past, I was the future,"" on the file marked ""Change"". However, given his discursive interest in evolution, team consensus holds that Tes is likely to use his powers for good, not evil. STATUS: ALLY

Flower with No Color,Yoshimi & Yuka,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf05e6ef95969321685/1:1/w_160/959d9095.jpg,2003-05-08 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8858-flower-with-no-color/,Ipecac,"I just love Japanese art students. I'm looking at two right now, on the subway down to St. Mark's Square. One is wearing this pink plaid dress with baggy camouflage pants underneath it and a Latrell Sprewell jersey on top, all completed by canary-yellow high-heels and an askew fedora. Her friend has a classic mullet, a puffy North Face parka, thigh-high lime-green stockings, and a pair of beat-up Converse All-Stars. Somehow they're pulling off both Exquisite Corpse looks, as only the Japanese can, carrying it with just the right touch of innocent panache, while also looking hotter than Bukkake on the Bayou starring the Ass-Fuck Twins. I don't exactly feel perverted, as this is merely the same sort of drooling veneration that the Pitchfork staff has always had for all things Boredoms. While not one to have pin-ups of Yoshimi in his house (cough, Dom, cough), I have actively sought out any and all appearances of her holding an instrument and/or striking a resonant surface. Her two-minute singles for Ecstatic Peace are cherished objects of Dada doo-doo gibberish beatific to a sicko like myself. Even Editor Ryan Schreiber has a closet fetish for all things Cibo Matto, so how could we not like this collaboration? Why is this disc of glorious, do-no-wrong babes just not happening? It's Yoshimi P-We and Yuka Honda hooking up, fer Christ sakes, yet it feels so much like they're just calling it in from halfway across the world-- if they're even in the same room. ""UMEgination"" is a gentle opener of cocktail piano, crickets, and digitized chirps, parting the bamboo curtain into a Martin Denny tiki hut of baboons politely rattling bells. It recalls the weirdo work that Boredoms went through years before, doing their own version of ""jungle,"" which included lots of lounge gestures run through ginsu blades. It's pleasant enough, but from there a grip on the album becomes slippery, or rather so lax that there's nothing to hold onto until it's well into the middle of the nine-minute fourth track, ""Spy Said One"", when another interesting concoction of sounds becomes audible. This time around, the girls sound like the chance meeting of the listening dog on classic RCA labels mixing it up with the laissez-faire trumpet of A&M; honcho Herb Alpert. An interesting sound clash, but it scarcely engages for more than a few minutes. ""Mow Deck in Eye"" is twenty-seven minutes of the sort of faux ethno-forgery that Boredoms magnificently stretched beyond the breaking point on Super Roots 6. Mushing together some of Yoko Ono's classic toothy chitter, some lethargic piano, and haphazard sound tweaking, it's topped off by weary chants and hand drums. It's not so much dreamy as it is lazy and indolent. ""Elegant Bird"" is the most exquisite of the bunch, and it's where the Yoshimi's new age piano resonates best, plinking amongst floating moans and cymbals. That it concisely clears two minutes exhibits a sense of self-editing scarcely executed elsewhere. If anything, Flower with No Color reminds me of another pedestrian collaboration from earlier in the year, from Richard Youngs and Matthew Bower as Youngsbower, in which no amount of intricate multitracking hues and processing tints could masque the simple fact that the first takes by the duo were lackluster and uninspired. Colorless, as the title itself attests. Guess some things do clash.","I just love Japanese art students. I'm looking at two right now, on the subway down to St. Mark ...

I'm What's There to Show That Something's Missing,Styrofoam,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a593b1335d7bf1698c1e/1:1/w_160/d3d0cc2c.jpg,2003-05-08 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7545-im-whats-there-to-show-that-somethings-missing/,Morr,"A few years back, somewhere deep within the dark, creaking, bat-infested headquarters of Apple Corp., the demonic wraiths running the company must have hatched an abominable scheme. Not content merely to brainwash the children of the world into Apple loyalty through complimentary comps for schools, marketing goblins created the perfect method of seducing an entirely new market demo: the hipsters. ""By distributing Powerbooks to the IDM artists of the world, we will be able to influence countless scores of captive concert audiences!"" the hooded and clawed demonlord Steve Jobs (who just wants you to think he doesn't run the company any more) probably cackled, adding, ""Muuuuh-hahahahahahahaha. Ha! Ha! Har-har! Ha!"" Rarely does a show go by these days without branding the fascistic logo of Apple into the crowd's retinas; they're as hard to miss as swooshes at football games. Through some incestuous scene peer pressure, Powerbook requirements have even spread to rock bands, and no artist dares perform his latest programming compositions without the softly glowing fruit silhouette hovering below squinting eyes as he delicately point-clicks through a song. Styrofoam (neé Arne Van Petegem) is one of the more recent Powerbook hunchbacks I've seen, both opening and manning the click-tracks for The Notwist. Focused entirely on his liquid crystal display, trying to look busy making minute adjustments to pre-arranged music files and occasionally singing, his solo set was every bit as boring as I imagined a live laptop performance could be, standing in stark contrast to the surprisingly spontaneous band-technology intercourse of headliner's set. So it comes as something of a surprise how much I enjoy Styrofoam's third release, I'm What's There to Show That Something's Missing. I've heard enough of the label by now to know that this is paint-by-numbers Morr music: laid-back pop generously enervated with microhouse ingredients. But Styrofoam is less lap-pop than lap-folk, his songs built on foundations of circular acoustic guitar figures and whispery vocals. If it wasn't for the drag-and-drop modifications, Van Petegem would be your Thursday night coffeehouse distraction; with the electronoise, he's the coffeehouse performer in Tomorrowland. The obvious comparisons to The Notwist are too distinct to ignore-- ""You Pretend You Own This Place"" sounds like a distant cousin to ""Consequence""-- but Styrofoam is into an even deeper Quaalude haze then his countrymen, the snap-crackle percussion tracks merely circling the melodies with a thin frame of nervous energy. In a largely bass-less environment (only ""If I Believed You Back into Focus"" possesses what I would unashamedly call ""beats""), the only dance move it induces is the soporific head nod. It's easy to be lulled into a trance by this music, especially with the lullaby sentiments of ""The Long Wait"" and ""Blow It Away from Your Eyes"" cooing in your ears. Styrofoam occasionally manages to snap his fingers in your face, to get you to listen more carefully, as on the soaring ""A Heart Without a Mind"". With somber ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" guitar lines competing with neon synthesizer pirouettes, Van Petegem somehow conjures up an epic out of micro-implements and vocals that make Sam Prekop sound hardcore. Save the heavy-handed Books-ish vocal samples eavesdropping on the neighbors fighting in ""Forever, You Said Forever"", he preserves this balance throughout. Perhaps because I never quite immersed myself in the clicks-and-cuts movement, Styrofoam still sounds fresh to me, where it might not to a more studied follower of the laptop scene. Or perhaps Van Petegem is just a rung above the rest of his mates in the Morr stable, slightly more handy with a melody, or has hit upon a new, compelling kind of slow-glitch. Perhaps the latest models of Powerbook have some kind of eeeeeevil hypnosis plug-in to woo the minds of any zine scribes in the audience. Either way, Styrofoam is a missionary of the Apple's diabolical operation mindcrime that's easy to forgive, a Powerbook hunchback to know and love.","A few years back, somewhere deep within the dark, creaking, bat-infested headquarters of Apple Corp., the\n\ demonic wraiths running ...

Socialisme ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings,Monade,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39469fc7814a47cd697/1:1/w_160/026a845e.jpg,2003-05-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5388-socialisme-ou-barbarie-the-bedroom-recordings/,Drag City,"At a point in the mid-90s I was ready to declare the lounge music fad to be at once the sound of a lethargic god, and utterly worthless. The exotic productions of 60s stereo pimps and failed pop bandleaders were campy to be sure, but in many cases, they were often obscure enough to afford the kind of off-kilter experimentation that wouldn't otherwise stand a chance on a bill with Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin. Guys like Les Baxter and Martin Denny weren't part of any counter-culture that might have had them, but were making strange music nonetheless; escapism, as sexy and thrilling as decent folk might ever be allowed to imagine, was their game, and if their silicone-injected future-visions had a fault, it was one closer to comfort than kitsch. Thirty years later, enter Stereolab and their retooled version of this ideal, filtered through increasingly straight-faced takes on posh retro-pop and kid-proof krautrock. I'll have you know that I'm one of the few who didn't balk when their album covers went two-tone; part of this is due to the fact that I already owned more than one Baxter LP, and was only too happy to hear people who approached mood music from the same warped innocence. However, it also seemed to me that on records like Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Sound-Dust, the band weren't just playing odes to a bygone age, pumped up with electronic steroids-- they were becoming part of the same legacy, and carving their own niche as purveyors of the very same fake future the old masters did (though I guess those guys weren't quite so, er, Socialist). During the mid-90s, 'Lab co-leader Laetitia Sadier hooked up with fellow eccentric Rosie Cuckston of Pram, to record a few tunes at Cuckston's studio. Despite both women's considerable pedigrees with atmosphere and studio manipulation, these sessions yielded low-key, minimalist pop songs that might have fit on albums for either's respective bands (though were probably a bit on the soft side). Later, without Cuckston, Sadier continued to put down tracks on her own (""Cache Cache"", featured here, ended up as a Stereolab B-side), and if anything, that material was even more laid-back. Replacing the expected space-age spark is a pleasant obligation to nothing other than passing an afternoon away with easy melodies and analog orchestrations. Detractors of post-ETK Stereolab will likely appreciate the stripped-down (though hardly lo-fi) feel of Socialisme ou Barbarie, but I can't help but think this music could have used some of that good old silicone veneer. ""Un Express"" is very reminiscent of Dots and Loops-era 'Lab, with its repetitive chord structure, synth interjections, understated brass, and especially the peppy, rhythm-box percussion sparkle ending. Sadier's distant moan transforms an interesting experiment in homemade post-rock into very alluring electronic pop, reminiscent of Raymond Scott's similarly homemade adventures of the 60s. Another highlight is the aforementioned ""Cache Cache"", beginning like the scary part in the Hawaii episode of The Brady Bunch, with slinky acoustic bass, accordion and Fender Rhodes. Soon enough, the deft shuffle of hand-percussion rubs up nice and smooth next to Sadier's always-gorgeous monotone French. This tune reminds me of the prog-lounge of Sound-Dust, though there's tenderness at work that I'm not sure I've ever really heard with Stereolab. Socialisme runs out of steam during the numbers that fail to emphasize its more immediate pop aspects, and also in parts that are just too smooth for their own good. ""Vent de Sud"" might have been an interesting fantasy-disco number all dolled up in Elektra production values, but here it basically sounds like a demo-quality exercise in Casio-powered funk. ""Enfin Seule"" should be a dreamy ride through trombone heaven, but seems too flat, while ""Sunrise Telling"" doesn't have much more going for it other than the vintage fuzz on the bass. Fans of either Pram or Stereolab should find something to enjoy on this record-- and it's not as if any of it is exactly off-putting. I might have wished for something more lively, but then, these are ""bedroom recordings."" It could be that just as the classic exotic sounds of vintage bachelor-pad pop weren't built to last beyond their era, this music sounds best in its own tiny frame.","At a point in the mid-90s I was ready to declare the lounge music fad to be at once the ...

You Can Never Go Fast Enough,Various Artists,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c5ea9e61561daa5672/1:1/w_160/eaee7b04.jpg,2003-05-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1955-you-can-never-go-fast-enough/,Plain,"We pitiful pop-mongers have weathered all manner of organizing-principle diversification schemes for works by that most inconsistent concern, the Various Artists: the fake rock opera, the real rock opera tribute, the fake film soundtrack, the fake band tribute, etc. Now we must bear witness to the fake-soundtrack-tribute-to-a-real-film-that-already-had-a-soundtrack-that-wasn't-released, a plight lubricated (depending on your level of boredom with these acts) by the promise of unreleased recordings by Will Oldham, Wilco, Mark Eitzel, and Sonic Youth, as well as some previously available (yet absurdly labeled ""rare"" on the disc's wrapper) tracks by Cat Power, Roscoe Holcomb, Leadbelly and Sandy Bull. Being fake-soundtrack-tributed is Monte Hellman's 1971 film Two-Lane Blacktop, an uncanny narrative (advertised with the slogan ""The Far-Out World of the High-Speed Scene!"") about bohemian gearheads, a film ""road"" enough to wow the garage-begreased, and existential enough to intrigue the coffeeshop-ponytailed. Anyone who knows anything about the incognito monopolies with which car companies destroyed railroads, or about how our Interstate system was based on Hitler's autobahn (not to mention his reich's use of film to glorify people-machines), might figure a libertinist car movie more counterintuitive than countercultural, especially when one considers that the ""easy rider/on the road"" motif quickly blossomed into Dukes of Hazzard/Fast and the Furious fetishism. However, Two-Lane Blacktop constantly entertains and surprises. At the beginning of the film, James Taylor and The Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson seem miscast in such car-porn, clutching big sticks, talking about cleaning rods and points, and declaring in a diner parking lot how there's ""a lot of muscle here tonight."" Soon, though, their macho-femininity contrasts interestingly with a drifting girl (tired of their talk of cars' rear ends, she says, ""I don't see anybody paying attention to my rear end!"") and a suave status-quoppie running from his life. Their endless race, their strangely communal competition, their implausible line readings, and the ethereality of their lusts result in the film's barely resembling America, or Earth. At some points, Two-Lane Blacktop plays like the car film that Kubrick would have made (if he wasn't making A Clockwork Orange at the time). And its appeal lasts: elements of Two-Lane Blacktop pervade later films as variegated as Duel, the Cannonball Run series, White Men Can't Jump, Bottle Rocket, and Y Tu Mamá También. Now onto why this comp is so conceptually mangled: the film already had plenty of music. ""Hit the Road Jack"" predictably plays in a grimy spoon, and The Doors and Kristofferson surface elsewise. Also, Taylor and Wilson's insanely focused characters went without music, intentionally, preferring the roar of their engine. The Girl (that's her name in the credits) sings her own versions of songs. The only character with a constant soundtrack is ""GTO"", the status-quoppie; he plays plenty of country and bluegrass, so this CD's suggesting other roots music is odd. The liner notes say that the project's organizer wanted this to be ""what the characters heard while driving,"" which might explain why these contemporary artists contributed either vintage-sounding ditties or (why oh why couldn't Sonic Youth and Mark Eitzel have imagined what they'd have sounded like in 1971?) abstract noise-clusters. So if you'd never heard the high lonesomeness of Sandy Bull, Leadbelly, or Roscoe Holcomb, or the previously released Calexico, Giant Sand, and Cat Power songs, I guess they'd be revelations; if you know them, this is awkward, like a love-mix from a new squeeze bearing songs the last three squeezes gave you. (The Girl has Chan Marshall bangs, and behavior, and she sings ""Satisfaction"" in the film, so trotting out Cat Power's great-the-first-time, annoying-the-nth-time cover of The Stones' oft-muzacked gem is at least warranted.) So: New stuff! Will Oldham teams with Alan Licht (the last third of whose An Emotional Memoir of Martha Quinn should be required reading for pop-nerds) to deliver a rehash of his oft-bootlegged live favorite cover ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"". After Oldham sets up the spike, Licht reads James Taylor's best lines from the film for five minutes. (Note: Will's muttering wave-and-wax-obsessed role as The Surfer in Slitch is clearly modeled after Taylor's muttering oil-and-octane obsessed role as The Driver.) Willophiles would do much better to skip this and track down the latest volume of Louisville Is for Lovers, on which Will covers Lucinda Williams' ""Something About What Happens When We Talk""-- that wrenching cover had me afraid to leave the house, wearing a hairnet, and taping peppermints to my collarbones, whereas ""Don't Cry, Driver"" just had me typing cusswords into the crappy search engine at Netflix. Wilco offer ""Old Maid"", an acoustic guitar, backgrounded piano, and brush-drum retro affair that recalls lackadaisical Dylan or Prine (another oft-bootlegged live favorite). It's fun to hear Tweedy play the geezer, but this is Wilco on cruise control, which violates every rule of Two-Lane Blacktop. Alvarius B (of Sun City Girls) contributes a song that, even though B's career predates David Pajo's, perfectly mimics Papa M. The German ragaist (I told you this disc was a contradiction in terms wrapped in a contradiction in terms) Steffen Basho-Junghans delivers a mega-soothing slide pastiche. Marc Eitzel teams with his sometime wurlitzist Marc Capelle to make a messy cackle-and-grind soundscape more akin to the ominous Wild at Heart (another film that homages Two-Lane Blacktop). In other news: Suntanama betray their black-oak bombast with some mellow zylophonic post-cock-rock, Charalambides inflict their heaviest vampire-ambience, and Sonic Youth fucks around with pedals for six Cousteau-ian minutes (really, they should label their stuff either Sonic Youth A or B, so you know if you're getting a rock band or Harry Partch-versus-Schoenberg-at-Radio-Shack). Roy Montgomery rocks the whole record with his unchanging 12+ minute phaser-fest ""2LB"" which summons Slint, Ween, and countless Bootsy Collins space-freak-outs. This track alone best befits the glorious ending of Two-Lane Blacktop, which to this day puzzles those who wank to aftermarket mags, even more than Harry Dean Stanton's cameo as a dejected homosexual hitchhiker.","We pitiful pop-mongers have weathered all manner of organizing-principle diversification schemes for works\n\ by that most inconsistent concern, the ...

45/45 EP,Pole,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c713d1975652138487/1:1/w_160/0daac5d8.gif,2003-05-07 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6374-4545-ep/,Mute,"Berliner Stefan Betke justifiably took some heat for repeating himself after releasing Pole 3. His career in music closely paralleled the ascendancy of the ""glitch"" in the late 90s, and by the time he made his third-straight record of crackly, bass-driven ghostdub, people started wondering where he could possibly go next. He sidestepped the issue in 2001 by releasing the underrated and under-promoted R, which compiled some early 12-inches with significant remixes and re-recordings of same, including particularly fruitful collaborations with guitarist D. Meteo. These collaborations were key, because they showed that the formerly hermetic Betke was open to trying something new; R was further notable for skimming off some of the sonic fuzz. Betke's label ~scape continued to put out some excellent records, but the question lingered: what would he come with on his next Pole record? Well, 2003 promises to be an interesting year for Stefan Betke. As introduced on the four-track 45/45 EP, he's changed his sound considerably. Tired of his own fingerprints-- indeed, the glitch movement in general-- this EP almost sounds like a debut from a new artist. Certain distinct Pole elements are intact-- mantle-shaking basslines, dub references (here in the form of melodica leads), a preoccupation with space-- but the production on these four tracks couldn't be more clean, and the rhythmic inspiration comes from well North of Jamaica. Like it or not, this is a new Pole. And for the most part, I like it. This particular sound is much more welcome than a further refinement of the blue, red, yellow progression would be. Starting off the record, ""Arena"" takes its syncopated rhythm directly from hip-hop, and this time the drums are loud and clear as opposed to being hinted at by the use of negative space (the latter was something Betke had a genius for). The Pabloesque melodica figures impart an island ambience and bits of chicken-scratch guitar form a pencil-thin riff, but the production is brittle and dry, nothing like the reverb-heavy syrup dub is usually coated with. ""Round Two"" is a slightly moodier and subtler reshuffling of the same ingredients, with the addition of some bell tones and more familiar Pole chords. ""The Bell"" is a bit of a letdown. Like ""Arena"" and ""Round Two"" it will appear again on the forthcoming Pole full-length in a vocal version, with some rhymes (!) courtesy of Mush Records emcee Fat Jon, but ""The Bell"" is the only one of the three that sounds incomplete as an instrumental. It is so unbelievably spare, with interesting percussion but almost nothing happening melodically, and it just sort of loops over and over until it's finished. Fortunately, 45/45 ends with ""Back Home"", which is the best thing we've heard from Pole for some time. The track is built around a sparkling surge of digital energy that strikes me as being inspired by ~scape's Jan Jelinek (there's a glow to the chord texture that Jelinek would be proud of), and it also features some funky acoustic bass work by August Engkilde. Betke titled this EP to reflect his shift in direction (a 45-degree turn), and that angle might be a bit conservative. You can still tell it's the same guy, but barely, and almost as importantly, 45/45 doesn't sound like anyone else; Pole imitators have become legion, and Betke has signed a few of them. For his own career, this is an interesting first step into new territory, a statement of intent.","Berliner Stefan Betke justifiably took some heat for repeating himself after releasing Pole 3.

Center:Level:Roar,Youngblood Brass Band,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae5b1335d7bf169974f/1:1/w_160/8529087e.jpg,2003-05-07 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8848-centerlevelroar/,OzoneLayered,"Anyone who's taken Black Music History 101 during his or her college tenure knows the New Orleans brass bands' importance to the development of jazz. Tracing the evolution of those ensembles from leaders of funeral processions to whorehouse accompanists to their ultimate destination up the Mississippi River is the cornerstone from which any understanding of post-Depression Era music is derived. From there, any number of paths are possible-- with the right map you can get to John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix or Jay-Z-- but without that foundation there's little chance of meaningful academic travel, not to mention bagging anything higher than a C. Too didactic? Probably, but that's what listening to Madison, Wisconsin's Youngblood Brass Band is like-- not only do they prefigure that people don't know anything about the history of Black Music and the links between jazz and hip-hop, but they also assume that folks don't know much of anything at all. Maybe it's a result of the band members' doubling as teachers in their spare time, but I can't help but feel beat over the head with a social justice/""know your history"" party line that's far more elaborate than the music itself. Youngblood Brass Band is nine players strong, but two of them can be held accountable for the one-dimensional mess that is Center:Level:Roar: composer/sousaphonist Nat McIntosh and emcee/snare-drummer David Henzie-Skogen. McIntosh's charts admirably attempt to erode the lines separating big band polyphony and breakbeat rhythm, but his lack of compositional dynamics causes the band to blare along at a brutal decibel level-- a sound that's way more Maynard Ferguson than Stetsasonic. In fact, the only track on the entire disc that makes me rethink my initial impulse to send them a complimentary case of Harmon mutes is the instrumental ""Nate McCavish Handbills for No Man"", where the Youngblood horns do a striking IDM impersonation with the help of some electronic effects. McIntosh's weaknesses might be open to rehabilitation, but Henzie-Skogen's rapping is just downright inexcusable. Where the strides made by underground hip-hop have opened up any number of possibilities for non-traditional flows, cadences and lyrical approaches, Henzie-Skogen doesn't even measure up under that expanded criteria. When not shouting out distorted song titles Zack de la Rocha-style (""The Movement"", ""Avalanche""), he's playing the social consciousness card with all the skills of a poor man's Talib Kweli-- who, incidentally, guests on a recent non-album Youngbloods single to prove that not even a top-notch emcee can lead them to the next level. But where Kweli backs up his bold observations with one of the best voices in contemporary hip-hop, Henzie-Skogen is all words and no tone; a combination that's bound to alienate more potential sympathizers to the cause than it recruits. I really do wish these guys had pulled this together more successfully, because, in theory, I still think it's a good idea that could withstand further exploration, especially since The Roots have almost entirely abandoned the jazzbo tip from whence they came. But the Youngbloods' good intentions are beyond compromised for now by a limited vision that effectively reduces them to a high school pep band trying to be down with the hip-hop kids-- only to reveal themselves for the cheerleaders they truly are.","Anyone who's taken Black Music History 101 during his or her college tenure knows the New Orleans brass bands ...

Cryonics,Hot Cross,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c11deb335119a49ed4e3/1:1/w_160/52282bd9.jpg,2003-05-07 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3925-cryonics/,Level Plane,"Post-Lightning Bolt, when the usually distracted media started paying bits of attention to noisy, visceral experimentation, bands who kick't the spastic histrionics full-on ended up collecting an unfair amount of comparisons to that there ubiquitous Providence, RI-based drum + bass duo. Lightning Bolt are good, but the unschooled folks trying to explain 'em aren't: LB are barely the tip of a vast, complex aesthetic, certainly not as anomalous or out-of-nowhere as the powers that be would have you think. I'm all up in arms, in my half-assed way, because I've seen and heard Hot Cross compared to Lightning Bolt. So lame! Such ridiculousness! A comparison like that not only strikes me as completely naïve, it denies the existence of hardcore! So why be a hardcore denier? Well, uh, because hardcore has a fucking mile-long list of bad connotations. (The straightedge kids nod in fatuous agreement, tripping o'er their pants as they reach for their Big Gulp). Once ""the kids"" more outwardly turned into jocks and suburban squares (the shit was, for a time, latent in their souls), it got much cooler to call hardcore something else: post this or that, new metal, jagged whatever. Even the Hot Cross press kit avoids the term, opting instead for ""technical-punk-metal."" Nope, son, this is hardcore! Genre is as genre does. I grew up listening to hardcore and I partially accept its glaring shortcomings like I grudgingly accept the neuroses of my family. With that in mind, when I listen to Hot Cross they definitely win points for: A. Not having even a single vocalist who sounds like Cookie Monster.
B. Lyrics that aren't just a bunch of strung-together cliches about the scene and ""dead"" friends.
C. Offering dynamics beyond a requisite hardcore breakdown, the one where the kids punch the floor or tap their chests and stare at the ceiling.
D. Having graphic design sense.
E. Being out of high school. Hot Cross are a good hardcore band. A good band, period. Intrepid tour companions of Melt-Banana, they formed in 2001 when Level-Plane owner Greg Drudy decided to hit the skins again. He played drums in the screamy band Saetia and was also the original drummer for Interpol (no shit!). With hardcore on the mind, he gathered some friends together-- including ex-members of Neil Perry, Off Minor, and You and I-- and that's Hot Cross. The band's secret weapon, and the reason I want to listen to this record so often: three vocalists shouting and singing in different registers, bullets ricocheting throughout a metal room. The vocal trio thing not only works well to propel the songs into interesting territories-- the reliance on human voices to raise mine soul transforms Hot Cross into a rabid version of a boy band. ""Fortune Teller"" reminds me of Small Brown Bike or maybe heavier Christie Front Drive: melodic voice in one speaker, screamer in the other, someone all up in a hissy fit elsewhere. The chant of ""fuck not lest ye be fucked"" is repeated until it grows-- like a hardcore snowball! monsoon!-- into a crackling, side-splitting acapella. If only I knew what it meant. This approach is also evident on ""Pretty Picture of a Broken Face"", where an almost e-m-o sigh clashes with distant screaming and a more upfront shout. Wisely, Hot Cross aren't afraid of straddling genres. ""Patience and Prudence"" is sad like the metal dirges of old (think Metallica), but then there's some CHUGGA guitar to lift your spirits, too. ""Figure Eight"" is unremarkable, but almost country. (Well, at least the guitars.) While listening to it, I thought of Team Dresch's ""Freewheel"" and remembered what a good band they were. It's only when Hot Cross get overly hardcore-- over-identifying with the less exciting aspects of the monster-- that I grow kinda weary. This happened now and again. ""A Weekend Spent Askance"" and ""Dissertation: 14"" are indistinguishable and chock full o' yawns. To their credit, even during these otherwise duds, there are brief lyrical gems (""Forget the phony fuck that thinks with an ass instead of a head"") or tiny flourishes like a wailing flange, an undistorted guitar, ringing noise sped up and slowed down, radio hiss, and/or an almost reggae dub. Overall, Cryonics is an intense if sometimes average ride. More importantly to the thesis, though, Hot Cross aren't post-metal or pre-primitive this or blah blah that or whatever the fuck; they're basically what true-blue hardcore sounds like after having interestingly evolved.

To lose this-- to ditch the genuine, spiritual inspiration that actually makes music a feasible artform-- would be, in a certain sense, to render their music useless. There's something uncomfortably sterile about The Sea and Cake's new, seven-song Glass EP that precludes it from functioning emotionally, and music that operates exclusively on an intellectual level seems counterintuitive. Synthesized and aggressively antiseptic, this stuff just makes me nervous-- I can't conceive of a single viable situation in which somebody would stumble home, pour a bowl of cereal, take off their pants, and say, ""Man, I just really need to hear some of that effin' Glass EP right now."" It's hardly unreasonable to crave something that makes your eyes roll back in your head, even if just for a few measures; it's far from irrational to require something you can holler at, or, at the very least, exchange satisfying pleasantries with. There's nothing to grab onto here, though-- no obliging space for eager, sweaty fans to curl up in, no craggy, emotional scraps to latch onto and savor, no telling finger slips or screwed up instrumentation, no gasps for air, no poignant leaps. None of the smelly, awkward, human stuff that really wets everyone's pants. This is expertly assembled music, but it's also impossible not to miss (and fair to demand!) the raw, reeling, otherworldly passion that can, and will, make even the most electronic of albums cry real, salty, face-streaking tears. The plastic-wrapped bleakness is most evident on the two opening tracks, ""To the Author (Version 1)"" and ""To the Author (Version 2)."" Even the titles are telling-- I don't know what kind of man-machine these tunes were scribed for, but it sure as shit wasn't me. Each seems more a self-indulgent experiment in sound than a labor of love or cathartic burst of inspiration, and even with that complaint aside, they're pretty much the same song: there are beeps in different places, structural reconsiderations, and some notable rhythmic switches, but the two still aren't distinct enough to warrant their cold, parenthetical qualifiers. Offering actual, numbered options only makes the songs themselves seem painfully arbitrary: there's no blood pooling on the studio floor here, no clear narrative path, no instinctual reactions or gnashing teeth. The two tracks are artful collages, made from clean bits of actual and/or synthesized sound, and, at some point in the pasting process, the songs also became entirely devoid of greasy human fingerprints, functioning like math equations, fractals, patterns: anti-engaging, chillingly definite, and frankly, a bit boring. Sure, there are some wacky waves of synth and an expert, snaking guitar line (with ever-nimble Tortoise-alum John McEntire banging out some brilliantly counterpoint drumbeats), but they don't add up to any logical conclusion or soulful epiphany-- just a big, shiny robot-face staring blankly back. On Version 2, when Sam Prekop's breathy, limited coo blows up nearly five minutes in, the sudden and unexpected presence of something vulnerable and non-metallic is intensely comforting-- it's like being tugged out of an avalanche by one of those furry dogs with a tube of hot cocoa tied around its neck. Remixes only work when they crack open the casing and rewire some circuitry, re-thinking the process and the story. But again, The Sea and Cake seem to be unfairly shying away from their creative responsibilities here, opting for hedonistic experimentation over honest, genuine output. It's fine for those happy to throw on the disc and do something else (like use their graphing calculator), but if you're looking for music to really listen to-- the kind of music that The Sea and Cake are better suited to producing-- just skip ahead to the third track, ""Traditional Wax Coin"", a piano-driven instrumental jaunt with all kinds of compelling tricks and some wildly good jazz drums, or ""An Echo In"", the last new track on Glass, a contemplative guitar jaunt with fuzzy bass and euphoric vocals. Even ""Interiors"" and ""Hotel Tell"" (each culled from 2002's full-length One Bedroom, and re-interpreted here by Broadcast and Carl Craig, respectively) toy with some workable emotion: on ""Hotel Tell"", Prekop's singing is certifiably inspired (if a little strained), and Eric Claridge's bouncing bassline is genuinely charming. It's getting warmer in here, boys. Johnny 5 is alive!","The Sea and Cake have never really been the type of band to set shit on fire, but up until ...

One Word Extinguisher,Prefuse 73,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a115ea9e61561daa46f6/1:1/w_160/0417f3b0.jpg,2003-05-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6449-one-word-extinguisher/,Warp,"Up to now, Scott Herren-- the shy, lanky Atlantan responsible for Prefuse 73's fabulous glitch-hop debut Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives-- hasn't made his name as a purveyor of confessional music. The closest he ever came was the laptop catharsis of Delarosa and Asora, which had no secrets to tell; rather, its intricacies of meter and texture gave your head something to do while your guts spilled out over it. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was hard-edged and fast-cutting, immersed in early rap techniques and sensibilities; it didn't express feelings, it steamrolled them. But One Word Extinguisher shows a range of emotional grappling usually foreign to instrumental hip-hop. It's clear that Herren was coming back to the studio night after night not just for skills and thrills, but for a measure of solace. Make no mistake: This is a breakup record. ""The never-ending battle"" is what Herren calls the break-up that lasted for the year-plus during which this album was in production. ""I locked myself in my room working, disconnected the phone, bummed out as fuck,"" he told CMJ in March. ""You can't talk to anybody, you feel like shit, and it's the only thing you have to express yourself."" A year of unspeakable suffering channeled into sixty ripe minutes: In the hands of anyone else, it could be torture. This sorrow, however, sparks with a sweeping wail of queasy ahhh's that carry stunted hopes for a soon-to-be-doomed relationship. Vocal scraps and a blood-curdling scream announce the descent of the mask of hip-hop rage, as an eightfold synth-scribbling bomb drops right into ""The End of Biters"", the first of several sucker-punching cutfests in the illustrious tradition of the edit record. Next comes Diverse's self-absorbed ""Plastic"", a screed that rails with righteous indignation against ""pop trends and predetermined top-tens."" All this over-the-top rebuke is obviously an escape from something. Things begin to come into focus as ""Uprock and Invigorate"" bounces in with its edges exposed. Warm, fretless bass, flitting Rhodes, drizzling sawtooth, and a brittle snare become intent on stocking up and locking down with every passing bar. But beneath the surface lies a hint of tension between the percussive exoskeleton and its syrupy core, an orderly contest of soul-versus-machine that momentarily eclipses the sense of loss. The rest of the album projects this kind of tension into a giant battle of the sexes. ""The Color of Tempo"" mangles its feminine samples with a virile beatbox pattern; ""90% of My Mind Is with You"" breaks up heavy panting with a deliberately difficult, meter-defying beat, and ends with a series of mournful, defeated R&B; samples. There can be no more doubt when, on ""Female Demands"", a girlfriendish voice casually tells Herren to ""fuck with the beat here"" only to be throttled by digital effects; the rest of the track feels like a giant damaged gynorcism. Before we know it, we're desperately trying to forget her, bumping with another woman who croons ""you... you... you..."" on the offs. Meanwhile, straight meters are often sprinkled with triplet ligaments, propelling the beat with an uncommonly light touch. But Prefuse's rhythmic sophistication isn't just about alternating threes and fours-- as the lesson goes, it takes two interlocked meters to make African music. While Herren rarely tries to stand up in two meters at once, he often relies on the juxtaposition of mildly divergent rhythmic feels within the same beat, proving his mastery of some of the subtler tensions available to the instrumentalist. This gives him access to some very subtle tensions-- though many tracks seem like tricks to distract us from the ongoing devastation. Sooner or later, it sinks in that we're in the company of an emotional fugitive, sealed in a room with machines whose perfect control, he is convinced, will allow him to avoid the inevitable emotional reckoning. Through scorn and bombast, through distraction and self-parody, through the sheer weight of craft, this Prefuse tries to wear his sorrow down, to crush himself, to explode the emptiness. A thrilling listen, but how could such a mission succeed? I'm not sure how he did it. There's a glimmer of hope in the open restraint of ""Choking You"", a sawtooth shuffle scattered with chirpy, chalky bits. Another late track calls a gender truce, as a skeletal crunch frames some lightly doctored female vocals, giving a cold, sweet impression, like melon rinds left out in the rain. And the last track, in spite of its metric and sexual duplicity, offers a baffling promise of balance. Unexpectedly, the music becomes its own consolation.","Up to now, Scott Herren-- the shy, lanky Atlantan responsible for Prefuse 73's fabulous glitch-hop debut Vocal Studies + Uprock ...

Attention! Blah Blah Blah,Atom and His Package,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13b9d034d5c69bf28f3/1:1/w_160/c4da3747.jpg,2003-05-06 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/347-attention-blah-blah-blah/,Hopeless,"Perhaps because a class clown is just a shy kid with different coping skills, the alterna-indie-underground has always had its share of satirical acts. Take The Dead Milkmen, The Dead Kennedys, or They Might Be Giants-- who had a really good song called ""Dead""-- or browse the single-syllable branch, with representatives like Devo, Ween, and Cex. It's not much of a stretch to assume that Atom & His Package imagines himself a part of this genetic lineage, but his true mentor seems to be a comedy-rock star that shines a bit more brightly: parody king ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. Now, far be it from me to front on The Al-- after all, I was an eleven year-old boy once. In fact, I still have an autographed ticket stub from a Weird Al show, a performance at a dinner theater at which I saw my first ever moshers during ""Smells Like Nirvana"". You might even say Al played a formative role in my musical development. No, let's not say that. Unlike me, Adam Goren doesn't seem like he'd be too ashamed by the comparison. He's got the nostril-heavy vocals, he occasionally borrows a melody or two from the pop culture consciousness, and instead of an accordion, he's got the sequencer companion he calls His Package (clearly a statement on the technologicalization of sexual organs in our increasingly impersonal and technical lives. Or just a cheap laugh). He might avoid overt song parodies, but that was only half of the Yankovic catalog: the rest of his albums were filled out with, er, classics like ""Nature Trail to Hell (In 3-D)"". On Attention! Blah Blah Blah, however, Goren is doing stand-up, with pretty limp material. Here's a song about marrying your grandma! Hey-o! Here's a song about why Atom doesn't want to have kids! Here's a song about smashing things with a hammer! I'm not totally averse to humor in music, but these jokes are sitcom-bad, and especially disappointing given that Atom has been reasonably funny in the past: the way ""Punk Rock Academy"" inexplicably becomes an Eddie Money cover halfway through, or the spot-on, caffeinated, Le Tigre-referencing rant of ""If You Own the Washington Redskins, You're a Cock"". The closest to thing to ""If You Own the Washington Redskins"" on Attention is ""The Palestinians Are Not the Same Thing as the Rebel Alliance, Jackass"", which never gets funnier than that doozy of a title right there. Two minutes of breakneck-speed anti-war protestor mockery that scores a couple valid points, it falls flat as satire, and Atom can't help but cut himself with double-edged statements like, ""You people who generalize are all the same!"" Compounding these problems, Attention shows Atom & His Package isn't even as musically compelling as he's been on previous outing, and he wasn't all that compelling to begin with. Where Goren once offered up a welcome slice of synthy levity between bands at a thousand over-serious emo shows, he now sounds like he's auditioning for the next Blink-182 tour, coating nearly every song with crunchy pop-punk guitar glaze. Capable, not-quite-Postal Service moments of programming-- the pizzicato strings of ""Friend, Please Stop Smoking"" or the epileptic rhythms of ""Possession (Not the One by Danzig)""-- are lost beneath the Nü-Weezer metal riffing. The sad fact is, a project like Atom & His Package suffers from the They Might Be Giants quandary: the more it sounds like a real band, and the more it takes itself seriously, the worse it becomes. Essentially, this means Atom & His Package is painted into a corner of stagnation, doomed to repeat himself with the musical editorials and danced-up Mountain Goats covers that got him this far. But hey, chin up, Atom-- doing the same thing over and over again has given ""Weird Al"" Yankovic a long, virtuous career and a killer episode of Behind the Music-- you could be next!","Perhaps because a class clown is just a shy kid with different coping skills, the alterna-indie-underground\n\ has always had ...

Electric Version,The New Pornographers,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e45e6ef95969323925/1:1/w_160/ec46da50.gif,2003-05-06 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5772-electric-version/,Matador,"Generally speaking, ""supergroup"" isn't a word that gets thrown around a lot. The term is usually reserved for one-off vanity projects by famous people with too much time on their hands. And besides, the results of the supergroup collaboration are almost invariably doomed to be regarded as secondary and inconsequential. If David Lee Roth, Keanu Reeves, and the Olsen Twins made an album together, it would not only be a surefire sign that Earth had finally become a true Gomorrah, but also would undoubtedly fail to generate the revenues and public acclaim of Van Halen's 1984, The Matrix, or the July 2006 issue of Hustler. It seems odd, then, that a pack of talented but largely overlooked Canadians and one up-and-coming, Canadian-by-way-of-Virginia alt-country chanteuse would come to be spoken of as if they were indie rock's answer to The Traveling Wilburys. But listening to The New Pornographers' stunning debut, Mass Romantic, the term ""supergroup"" seems surprisingly fitting, if not in the traditional sense of the word. Certainly, Mass Romantic was as far from an insubstantial vanity project as one can imagine-- but, just as certainly, it doesn't sound like the product of just some average, run-of-the-mill ""group."" That record was the result of years of sporadic tinkering by a rotating cast of insanely talented individuals. Each song seemed to showcase a different permutation of the members' talents, and registered like a perfectly constructed sonic artifact, rather than just a recording of some people playing their instruments in a room. Since its release, the Pornographers have become the main project for primary songwriter Carl Newman, bassist John Collins, keyboardist Blaine Thurier, drummer Kurt Dahle, and recently acquired multi-instrumentalist Todd Fancey. The band has toured extensively, and over the past two years, written and recorded this, their sophomore album. In other words, The New Pornographers have become a real band. Accordingly, the most substantial difference between Mass Romantic and Electric Version is that the latter sounds much more like an album by a band than a collective. On Mass Romantic, every sonic nook and cranny was filled by a whirring synthesizer, a buzzing acoustic guitar, or a five-part harmony vocal. Electric Version, on the other hand, is a much more live-sounding and spacious record, with instrumentation kept relatively straightforward and a minimum of evident studio embellishments. And yet, The New Pornographers have retained their signature sound-- in short, Electric Version is a more streamlined and spontaneous incarnation of the same catchy, harmony-laden power-pop that provided the foundation for Mass Romantic. Even more so than Mass Romantic, Electric Version sounds like Carl Newman's record. The frenetic-verse-and-anthemic-chorus formula that Newman toyed with last time around constitutes the core of this record, and provides the format for some of its greatest moments, but also a few of its most forgettable. ""The End of Medicine"", which was included as a B-side on the ""Letter from an Occupant"" single, gets a fantastic reworking here, as Newman turns a fragile vocal hook into the centerpiece for a perfectly concise pop gem. On ""July Jones"", Newman inflects his bouncy, melodic songwriting with a kind of reflective melancholy that Mass Romantic never even hinted at, with absolutely gorgeous results. In fact, the more spacious sound of Electric Version allows for a lot of low-key moments that Mass Romantic simply didn't have room for: ""From Blown Speakers"", another standout, subtly develops to a powerful and bittersweet finale, weaving the threads of nostalgia that run throughout the song into a shimmering coda. As was the case with Mass Romantic, Newman makes some of his most powerful statements on Electric Version through the silvery pipes of Neko Case. ""The Laws Have Changed"", in which Case and Newman trade off lead vocals, may very well be the best song here. Hooks within hooks are exchanged between the two singers, and the contrast between Newman's smirking disaffection and Case's effortless resonance is played up to great effect. Since 2000, Dan Bejar has amicably given up his position as a full-time member of the band. Nevertheless, he's offered three contributions to Electric Version, and they're absolutely superb, as his obtuse, nonlinear songwriting provides a welcome counterpoint to Newman's classicist leanings. On ""Chump Change"", Newman's power-pop machine turns a typical Bejar ditty into a chugging anthem, effortlessly transforming a line like ""the saints and the desert use their heads"" from an abstract lyrical nugget into one of the most indelible hooks on the record. ""Testament to Youth in Verse"", Bejar's best on Electric Version, is host to a two-minute vocal round coda that really has to be heard to be believed. Of course, strong though it may be, Electric Version is not without its low points. Sometimes Newman's propensity for writing verses crammed full of chord changes works against him, especially when such verses fail to effectively segue into a rousing chorus. Those expecting the dense, powerful, and insistently upbeat onslaught of Mass Romantic will no doubt react to Electric Version with some degree of initial disappointment. Repeated listens, however, reveal that Electric Version not only displays Carl Newman's brilliant and unique pop sensibility, but allows it enough space to reveal previously obstructed layers of emotional depth. Indeed, the overall success of this record suggests that The New Pornographers are anything but a one-off project; with any luck, it will mark the beginning of the band's metamorphosis from ""supergroup"" to, simply, ""great band.""","Generally speaking, ""supergroup"" isn't a word that gets thrown around a lot. The term is usually reserved for one-off ...

Send,Wire,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa549d034d5c69bf3e13/1:1/w_160/42dcfd16.jpg,2003-05-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8710-send/,Pinkflag,"If revival acts ran the world, we'd all still be searching for the wheel. Now, some of these bands are great at what they do-- if we were ever to eventually discover the wheel, after all, you can bet it would be the roundest goddamned wheel humanity had ever known-- but tail-chasing can only go so far. So in hindsight, is it that surprising that Wire's two Read & Burn EPs from last year marked such a successful return after a decade-long hiatus? Simultaneously resisting the cop-out of cannibalizing the sound of their classic late-70s material, and dodging any self-conscious stab at avant-garde, Wire sound nearly as essential now as they ever have. Who ever said comebacks were tough? All it takes is a preternatural sense of musical trends and history, a cunning knack for timing, and the willingness to completely reinvent yourself. So what the Hell is this, Colin? Bruce? Send? Here I am, doing my best to talk up Wire's tireless desire to innovate (which, regardless of any lingering ambivalence to the merit of their 80s output, is near-indisputable), and you guys go and release this in lieu of the anticipated Read & Burn 03 installment. Concealing a scant four new tracks in the midst of just above half the material from the prior two EPs, Send feels a little, uh, unnecessary. The album fails to even meaningfully compile 01 and 02, ditching some of those discs' most potent buzz-punk tracks, instead replacing them with a couple of stiff, diluted cuts that surely wouldn't be equipped to stand on their own. In a bizarre twist, the whole becomes far less than the sum of its parts; less than anything close to a new album, less than even a new EP, and certainly less than Wire has proven themselves capable of. That said, this record could only be seen as a false move in comparison to the standards they've so brilliantly set for themselves; in isolation, Send still possesses much of the fury, malevolence, and crushing immediacy that had all the kids talking about them again in the present tense. The martial anthems reprised here are no less vicious for sitting on the shelf a year; the guttural bile-spitting, robo-hypnotic snare simplicity, and guitars as head-rattlingly violent as a boxing match between a power sander and a jackhammer-- it's all as sharp as ever. Those who've yet to know the power of the new EPs will marvel at the subliminal paranoia of ""Nice Streets Above"" or rapid-fire metal blast of ""Comet"". These folks may also take some comfort in the vintage melody-making of ""The Art of Stopping"", though the sheer authority of Bruce Gilbert's speak-shouts and the grinding waves of feedback on ""Spent"" will humble them. The content of Gilbert's barking is unclear beyond keeping the drive alive, but that's not important-- his tone is crystal, and it demands obedience. In truth, anyone who's enjoyed the Read & Burn series to date will probably be awed by all that stuff, too-- the only difference is the slight, bitter pang of regret they'll experience when the gradual eruption of Send's (and 02's) epic closer ""99.9"" quiets, and they wake to the realization that ""Raft Ants"" and ""Trash/Treasure"", the finest moments on 02, are nowhere to be found on the album's tracklist. Sadder still, the new material left in their stead just twists the knife. The dull claustrophobia of ""Being Watched"" and the even duller ""Half Eaten"", a brief, pounding instrumental that might as well be ""Raft Ants Lite""-- all the repetition, half the nuance-- shouldn't have made the cut. Neither track is particularly objectionable, but that does little to remedy the fact that better songs were sidelined for them. The other two fresh cuts take up some of the slack, for what it's worth. The ominous, confrontational tone of ""You Can't Leave Now"" slows Send to a crawl before a distorted, beatific refrain offers momentary redemption, but the only truly impressive addition to this album is ""Mr. Marx's Table"". Colin Newman's voice is carefully, gracefully restrained, distorted just enough to be slightly rendered unclear; it offers mystery and an uncertain happiness even as he admits (or informs) that ""It's too late to pray."" It's a beautiful counterpoint to the vague malaise that hangs over not only the pulsing guitar drone that accompanies it, but the rest of the album, too, standing in particularly strong relief against the largely limp new offerings. If Send is to be your only exposure to these guys this century (so far), it's worth it-- even though they've outdone themselves at pretty much the same album in the past couple of months. Wire's proven not once, but twice, that they'd rather disappear entirely than even consider doubling back on themselves, but nevertheless, after thirty-odd years of barreling forward, this is, if not a step backwards, something equally alien: a hesitation.","If revival acts ran the world, we'd all still be searching for the wheel.

Songs from Willipa Bay,Birddog,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b6c0084474cd0c00df/1:1/w_160/78c36020.gif,2003-05-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/715-songs-from-willipa-bay/,Happy Happy Birthday to Me,"I had that magic feeling, the same feeling I had before I spun Royal City and June Panic, about Birddog: the feeling that I's about to discover a frumpy diamond or a low-key giant, some music that would give pause to self-mutilating goth tweens and soothe insomniacs learning Latin to improve their tattoos. Maybe I got wooed by their fourth album's portentous cover art-- a photorealistic painting of a hole in a stormcloud over a body of water that had me convinced that there was a God, and a God's butthole. Alas, this underwhelming ""long player"" (on my property, 7 songs in 24 minutes is called an EP) teaches us why Birddog are best known for an alumnus (they're the farm team from which Wilco recruited Glenn Kotche) and their guestlist (Elliott Smith and Edith Frost on their last record, Jason Loewenstein and Paul Oldham on this one). As a band, Birddog acquits itself as a delivery system for moody, mystic-toned neo-folk, and the presence of onetime Bonnie ""Prince"" sidemen Loewenstein and Oldham help to hint at a more streamlined Palace sound, what Joya should have sounded like were it rehearsed or produced worth a durn. These unconventionally or at least atypically alluring figures are a perfect match for frontman Bill Santen's faux Brit/psych enunciations (""night"" is ""noi-eye-ght"") that suggest a whimsical, but slightly disturbed, mid-60s mix of Donovan, Neil Young, and fruity pebbled Arthur Lee. (Okay, it's David Byrne as Peter Pan.) (Okay, it's The Vehicle Flips versus The Lightning Seeds, but slow-burn.) Santen's fey and elfin self pens lyrics about not-much that rhyme-or-don't. Their dilly-dallying begs for some antonym of ""urgent,"" and their occasional bad poetry is saved by the occasional great line such as, ""Hoping for a hooker or a handout."" This is from ""Cities"", which busts into a righteous artwad-Skynyrd riff. ""Red Red Wine"" is a brooding Lynchian antifable about needles and devils, its forlorn bridges pointing out what a markedly unfestive departure it is from the other song you know by its name. ""Beaches"" ain't got aerosol do to with Bette Midler or the breeze under anybody's featherflaps, but it is the band's poppiest peak, refraining, ""Without you/ Without you."" Still, a pop Birddog is like The Wallflowers if they were on Shimmy-Disc. ""$100 Wedding"" can't help but sum up this band's vibe: low-maintenance, sparsely attended ceremony. There's something admirable about how this band waves no cudgel, doesn't appear to be aiming for its audience's memory, and probably doesn't mind still bumping like an opening act after eight years. This disc makes for inoffensive incidental music, and that's no faint-praise write-off: their sound is shyly expansive rather than invasive. But damnit, I was on the prowl for a new unsung visionary, and Songs from Willipa Bay just reminds me of another Washington waterway: Cape Disappointment.","I had that magic feeling, the same feeling I had before I spun Royal City and June Panic, about Birddog ...

The Listener,Howe Gelb,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf04ea9e61561daa79c0/1:1/w_160/7c581162.jpg,2003-05-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3417-the-listener/,Thrill Jockey,"I don't know how he does it. Really, Howe Gelb shouldn't be making music this enjoyable, not with that voice of his. Gelb's larynx commands a staunchly unmelodic rasp, hovering in a range that's obviously too low for his natural delivery. And the perverse thing about it is, I think he does it on purpose-- his past records with Giant Sand (and there are a lot of them) suggest he has quite a range, though one unifying principle remains in place on every one of his albums: he studiously avoids sounding polished and professional. Part of what makes it work is his sense of humor, which frequently permeates his records. His songs often contain the kinds of jokes you get the second or third time around, and his delivery is occasionally part of the punchline. Gelb's latest solo record-- arriving more than two decades after his first release with Giant Sand precursor Giant Sandworms-- is a casual, good-natured romp recorded in Denmark and Arizona, stuffed full of cabaret, porch jazz and slacker noir, furthering Gelb's recent trend away from the idiosyncratic desert blues-rock on which Giant Sand initially built their cult following. Gelb hooks you with his liner notes before the album even starts, penning a hugely successful and entertaining prank diary, wherein he's been hired to research the ""actions and displays of modern thinkers"" by a company that makes custom-sized rivets for Airstream trailers. To get close to his people, he decides to become a ""cult artist,"" and there's a passage that so positively slays the indie rock scene (and his own past) that I have to repeat it in full here: ""First, a lack of proficiency on any instrument of choice;
This would allow a more unique style to emerge from the playing.
Second, a definite omission of melody in the material;
This made it even easier to qualify to such status.
And thirdly, a demeanor of abandon;
A reckless execution mixed with an offhanded delivery with too much wordplay."" The whole notion that he attained cult status in the underground specifically to aid the process of selling out is icing on the cake. Of course, this is a guy who labored in obscurity for decades, never really receiving the kind of attention that most upstart bands receive after a month in the Brooklyn club scene these days, so he's entitled to get his licks in. That he carries this spirit into the music is a pleasure for the listener. ""Felonious"", in particular, reveals his piano bar jokester side, blatantly copping the riff from ""Sweet Jane"" for the piano part then admitting it with the opening line, ""The piano's stealing Lou Reed licks/ Licks that he probably stole."" The whole thing unfolds in ramshackle widescreen ambience, with Calexico (themselves Giant Sand alums) functioning as the house band, and swelling strings offering offhandedly pretty melodic accompaniment. The Danish tracks-- featuring assorted Danish scenesters and a backing band called Under Byen-- reside in a realm of demented jazz, where tension builds and resolves in unexpected ways, and the tango is anything but elegant. Peter Dombernowsky's hand percussion is the driving rhythmic force on these tracks, and the smears of classically trained violin and drunken sax that Under Byen provide render things rudely off color. ""B 4 U (Do Do Do)"" brutally butchers Bill Withers' ""Lean on Me"" over a backdrop that could only be called rock in the loosest possible sense-- which is not to say it's good, though it is strangely captivating. The Listener is ultimately such a strange record that it's hard to really classify; Giant Sand fans are going to love it, naturally (all twelve of them likely already own it), but people new to Gelb and his accomplices might be left scratching their heads. Gelb's work is ultimately difficult to approach without simply diving in cold, and with that in mind, this album is probably as good a place to start as any (I might recommend Giant Sand's Purge & Slouch, Glum, or Chore of Enchantment first, but they're all similarly whacked). As a slow convert to Gelb's world myself, I know his stuff's not for everybody, but I have to say it's worth a try for anyone with a wide open ear and a sense of humor.","I don't know how he does it.

Love and Distortion,Stratford 4,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5825e6ef95969320afe/1:1/w_160/35c87c40.jpg,2003-05-05 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7528-love-and-distortion/,Jetset,"Stratford 4 vocalist/guitarist Chris Streng nudged the dirt with his shoe, cocked his head to the side and replied in kind, ""So what you're saying is that you are a magic, talking bull, and you have the secret to my success?"" ""That is correct,"" the bull calmly replied. Streng was nervous, as this was the first time he'd met a talking bull during any of the many roadside bathroom-stops his band makes during their busy tour schedule. ""Well... what is it?"" ""The reason your band hasn't hit it big yet is because you don't yet have the strength to break-on-through. What you need to do to in order to gain strength,"" the bull cleared its throat, ""is eat one of the paddies of excrement I've produced in the field. It's rich in nutrients that will make you and your band the Next Big Thing."" ""Gee... I don't know about that..."" ""Lou Reed did it."" This was undoubtedly assuring to Streng as he went face-first into the dung, and began his dietary regiment. It certainly seemed to help him accomplish his goal, as The Stratford 4 began to climb the ranks of indie-rock stardom, first with their EP This Could Be Heaven, then with their full-length debut The Revolt Against Tired Noises, culminating in anticipation for their latest release on Jetset Records, Love and Distortion. Early on, top names such as Rolling Stone and The Chicago Sun-Times lauded the album as a true union between seemingly disparate influences as My Bloody Valentine, Yo La Tengo, and The Velvet Underground. With the help of producer Chris Walla, Streng had finally given the world his full artistic vision, and it appeared at least initially that the world was accepting it in the same manner that Streng himself had originally accepted the defecation of that magical bovine, with an open mouth and a blind eye. Unfortunately for Streng-- and the rest of the band-- the moral of the story was soon to hit them square in the Rickenbacker 12-string: you can learn to fly high by feeding off bullshit, but sooner or later you are going down for the count. Though one would be hard-pressed to accuse the band of false advertising-- as there is both love and distortion present on the album-- the word ""fake"" comes to mind. From the faux-British accent (""She Married the Birds"") to the teenage content of such imaginatively titled tracks as ""Tonight Would Be Alright"" and ""The Simple Things Take Over"" (sample lyric: ""I don't want to be your friend/ And I don't want this to end""), the band sounds more a product of pop culture than the cultivated indie-aesthete conveyed in the album's liner notes and content. Lest you doubt their credentials, the track ""Telephone"" literally and figuratively runs the gamut of the artistic influences upon which The Stratford 4 base themselves for better or worse. Amidst a fictional call to his mother, Streng relates how his world is falling apart while simultaneously asking for advice on what to do about it. His mother-- a thin veil for this cross-generational metaphor-- replies that it all depends on ""what you're listening to."" Of course, hipster that he is, Streng has his CD wallet unzipped, ready to list off such band names as ""Spacemen 3, Primal Scream, and T. Rex/ Belle and Sebastian and The Bunnymen"" before giving in to the suggestion of his mother not to ""forget Bob Dylan, and don't forget the Stones."" While great in their own respect, one would expect that, given this large group of influential artists, the band could have produced a track (or album, for that matter) that showed a bit more variety and variability beyond the scope of sopping introspective lyrics and dulled hooks. It's telling that the band's moment of shining promise comes at the end of the track that damns them the most, when Streng finally takes a break from being the constraining superego with the line ""there's more to this life than The Stratford 4."" Like a weight lifted off their shoulders, the rest of the band is afforded the opportunity to explore the limited sonic region they've decided to call their own, and to good effect, as the final half of the song comes closest to the origin of their purported sound. Even more promise is shown with the harder and decidedly catchier ""The Story Is Over"", with its meaty guitar riff and thankfully muted vocals. ""Kleptophilia"" and ""Tiger Girl"" display a much stronger songwriting style, allowing the fuzzed-out guitars and tinny percussion to lead the way through relatively strong bridges and brief choruses. Unfortunately, the tracks grow increasingly difficult to hear as the album concludes, not because of any abstract artistic statement on the band's behalf-- mercifully-- but due to the deafening roar of used bin CDs clapping against one another as consumers rifle through the vast abundance of The Stratford 4's Love and Distortion, all sold in a fit of rage that can only follow failed expectations after being force-fed overpraise, which is more often than not a load of shit.","Stratford 4 vocalist/guitarist Chris Streng nudged the dirt with his shoe, cocked his head to the side and replied ...

The Horror EP,RJD2,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2805e6ef95969320420/1:1/w_160/346e18d2.jpg,2003-05-05 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6796-the-horror-ep/,Definitive Jux,"If I didn't know better, I'd think this Rjd2 kid had a Charles Bronson-sized death wish. He showed up on the cover of last year's Deadringer with his skull busted open and bleeding all over his Sunday school clothes, and he's taking The Horror even more literally, with a photo of himself face-down in a pool of blood, next to somebody's stash of pop-top Schlitz cans. I could throw out all kinds of scenarios that might lead to such an unfortunate demise, but it's probably best left for people to resolve with their own imaginations while I break down what's really important-- the music. As has become Def Jux protocol, The Horror is a post-blockbuster collection of odds-and-ends designed to either shed new light on its predecessor or lure in suckas who slept on the original. But where anyone else attempting such a dubious marketing scheme would be immediately called out for straight-up pirates, the Def Jukies have once again done an impressive job offering up baubles that satisfy both conditions. Like Deadringer, The Horror begins with what's become Rj's signature cut, ""The Horror"", repeated verbatim with its punk-ass bassline and triumphant horn samples. From there, the EP takes off on a compilation of B-sides and remixes that's dizzying enough to confuse the fuck out of anyone trying to play spot-the-differences, not to mention utterly betray the five kids who still collect Def Jux twelve-inches. To be fair, there is one entirely new cut (""Sell the World""), but it's nowhere near revelatory. Other than a Kurt Weill-ian bridge detour, the track isn't much more than standard downtempo-- pleasant enough, but far from on par with Deadringer's best. The previously unreleased remixes fare much better, especially the new take on ""Final Frontier"" that finds Vast Aire, Aesop Rock and Murs kickin' it along with Blueprint to the tune of a Def Jux posse cut that finally gets it right after a handful of misfires. There's also an instrumental mix of ""Final Frontier"" that holds up well on its own thanks to that claustrophobic shuffle of a beat, and a superior version of ""F.H.H."" that breathes easier in the absence of Jakki Motormouth's run-of-the-mill mic check. In regards to the B-side material, The Horror admirably corrals some fantastic cuts that have only been heard by the most obsessive of Def Jukies. ""Bus Stop Bitties"" (originally found on the ""Let the Good Times Roll"" twelve-inch) captures Rj on some more of his ""thinking man's Moby"" shit, with its repeated sample of ""Cornbread/ And lima beans/ Candied yams/ Collard greens"" inciting equal amounts of ass-shaking and face-stuffing; one can only guess what might've happened had he run into those other bitties over at the BK lounge. Similarly, the white-label-only ""part one"" of ""Good Times Roll"" grafts the same ""Mannish Boy"" verse over a significantly harder beat, even taking a Black Ark worthy dub detour in the middle. I wish I could say the same for the ""June"" remix (from the twelve-inch for the original track) but, like the previously unreleased ""Ghostwriter"" mix, it's rather underwhelming, offering only shades of disparity from its original version. Like El-P's FanDam Plus before it, Rj's EP comes with a second disc of multimedia material to presumably sweeten the deal. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely a couple of redeeming factors-- like the surreal animation short for ""The Horror"" or the ""Making of 'The Horror' music video"" clip, shot on-location at the same abandoned mental hospital where Jacob's Ladder was filmed-- that make disc two more than collector-bait. But beyond the few people who've always wanted to know that he's stolen beats from Kentucky Fried Chicken commercials (""as long as it's hott"" indeed!) or never seen Rj and El-P do their Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick routine at the end of ""Squeegee Man Shooting"" on tour, it's a mere novelty and not much more. Since I'm positive that no one over at Def Jux central is losing sleep over these questionable-at-best marketing tactics, I'll let them off the hook once again-- because The Horror is still a solid reiteration of Rj's remarkable talent. And if he wants to keep using the bleeding head wound fixation to disguise his music from the uplifting force it truly is, I won't begrudge him that one simple pleasure-- even if his records betray him every cut of the way.","If I didn't know better, I'd think this Rjd2 kid had a Charles Bronson-sized death wish.

The Stolen Singles,Arab on Radar,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e95e6ef9596932007e/1:1/w_160/0518a164.gif,2003-05-05 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/267-the-stolen-singles/,Three-One-G,"Arab on Radar broke up a few weeks ago, and no one seemed to notice. Whether to your delight (DiCrescenzo) or your chagrin (a dude who likes them), the haywire Providence, RI quartet has called it quits after seven-plus years, dragging four full-lengths, four seven-inches, and four comp appearances in their wake. Misters Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Type A, Clinical Depression, and OCD are citing ""irreconcilable differences"" that have ""compromised the creative process""-- and just when their name was becoming en vogue! San Diego's Three One G has gladly seized the reigns of the band's back catalog, and plans to reissue their first two albums, Queen Hygiene II and Rough Day at the Orifice. But first, the label has shot out this bile-soaked treasury of Arab on Radar's out-of-print odds-and-ends, a rusted-out Voltron they call The Stolen Singles. The gritty, piercing noise-rock attack of the two-guitar/drum/vocal outfit that has warmed the hearts of lobotomy patients worldwide since '95 is well represented here. Arab on Radar's seven-inches highlighted the soiled brevity of the band's albums; stitching them into their own release creates a year-by-year format of intermittent song spurts that makes for a logical collection. Not at all throwaways, these tracks contain some of the band's strongest songwriting. Be forewarned, though: what sounds ""strong"" to a decently sized fanbase is just as easily found discordant, jarring, and strident to others. Getting a rare glimpse of the group's beginnings, early cassette track ""Inventor"" is the most accessible the band has ever been. Seemingly a no-wave, android dance-party act, the tune features an addictive bassline the likes of which would never again be heard in their future efforts. The Horshack-meets-Mork vocals of Eric ""Post-Traumatic Stress"" Paul turn him into ""the female defector,"" as he mindlessly chants about ""placentas"" and ""ovulating."" Think a sludgier, amelodic Devo, which works mainly on the power of sheer conviction. The sound of this tune and the similar ""Aisle 5"" are short-lived, though, as Arab on Radar strangely seemed to de-evolve into aggressive, menacing noisemakers. ""Pig Roast"", a 1996 seven-inch track, contains a guitar that sounds like it's amped through a Casio plugged into someone's butthole. 1998 B-side ""Samurai Fight Song"" is, curiously, a straight-up attempt at stoner rock. More recent cut ""Running for Asthma"", from the Kid Commando split, sounds like dad's lawnmower trying to start after thirty years of abuse. Oh yeah, and as the tracks progress, Mr. Stress' voice ever increasingly seems to be coming out of his nose-- more so with each passing year. The man's lyrics, of course, are another story. Potty humor? Wit? Whatever-- titles like ""Swimming with a Hard-On"" and Yahweh or the Highway exude a certain charisma that I find a bit too rare these days. Of course, the band's place on the bill of their final tour (referred to as Oops! The Tour) almost seems a better function of how they'll be remembered down the road. Whether it be an overall tiring of The Locust, Lightning Bolt's equipment being in tatters, or late-comers missing out on Hella, Arab on Radar managed to slide into the middle commanding the most attention. Hard to ignore, the group found themselves a notch in your eardrum between ""annoyance"" and ""tolerance."" Existing fans of the band needing to play catch-up-- as well as aficionados for any group mentioned above-- are advised to pick up this sendoff, but consider it a recommendation made with caution.","Arab on Radar broke up a few weeks ago, and no one seemed to notice.

In the early 90s, when ""post-rock"" meant English people moving past shoegazing into ambient and dub, they caromed into view on a buzzy organ-and-guitar rush, droning joyously into a frenzy as poppy as it was driving. By the late 90s, when ""post-rock"" meant Chicagoans with jazz ambitions going nuts with the vibraphones, their tight drones had opened up into a fascinating grab-bag of swingy lounge and spacy pop, much of which was as terrifically conceived as anything else that decade. Some naysayers like to point out that they sounded like the metronomic grooves of Neu!, but they just as often sounded like Faust, the hyper Parisian pop of France Gall, the loungy exotica of Martin Denny, the bloopy Moog-music of Jean-Jacques Perry, or any of the dozen other acts whose reissues they laid some groundwork for. And if the reams of fresh ideas on Stereolab's best albums weren't proof enough to convince detractors that the band's songs possessed as much depth as their record collections, ABC Music stands to close the issue. The run of sessions presented on this two-disc collection is broad, stretching from 1991 to 2001 and covering every major phase of the band's progression over its 32 tracks. As such, it's hard not to get a little nostalgic, to start mentally mapping the Complete History of Stereolab for old hands and newcomers alike: The Earliest Days. Represented here by two Peel Sessions from 1991 and 1992. Stereolab's appearance was a revelation, and that's just how this compilation kicks off: with a quick, blurry run through the anthemic bounce of ""Super Electric"", which starts off droning and doesn't stop until you've had enough. Maybe it was the purposeful hum of Tim Gane's guitar or Laetitia Sadier's matter-of-fact melodies, but Stereolab always came out sounding like they were leading some sort of stirring revolutionary march through your headspace, Sadier playing Eponine in a future moon-version of Les Miserables. There's the contemplative jangle of ""Changer"" as well as the slow harmonic shifts of ""Doubt"" (another hymn), but my personal favorites from this batch come with the wrecking pulse of ""John Cage Bubblegum""-- a shifting collage of melodic mantras over an unstoppable charge-- and the wistful abandon of ""Peng 33"" where Sadier enthuses about the world's possibilities over a weirdly heartbreaking chord pattern; the fact that her lyrics are mostly paraphrasing from the opening of One Hundred Years of Solitude actually makes it better. The Early Middle Period. These heavily represented days saw the Lab's drones go from a lo-fi rush to more varied and concrete forms-- the first high-water mark of the Stereolab Can Do No Wrong era-- and appropriately, the set leads with ""Wow and Flutter"" from their longest, sleepiest, outer-spaciest record, Mars Audiac Quintet. Soon after, we come to the single ""French Disko"", which had the band summarizing its entire early charge into one pitch-perfect pop moment; ""La Resistance!"" they cheer, confirming that revolutionary-anthem impression. ""Lo Boob Oscillator"", one of their earliest pretty-swing excursions, has Mary Hansen and future Snowpony frontwoman Katharine Gifford doing 50s harmonies while Sadier paints pictures of the moon drifting freely here and there; ""Golden Ball"", unfortunately, stands as the only representative of Transient Random Noise-Bursts with Announcements, the Lab's darkest and most disorienting record. I wish they'd done ""Crest"", but I also wish Sadier had a stronger voice, as she struggles to be heard all through these sessions. Still, this is the Stereolab that switched people on, and it's on lovely display here. The Late Middle Period. This is where the beauty of ABC Music is unveiled. Stereolab's records completed a long-term turn they'd been taking since the mid-90s, from a straight-up band-in-a-room feel to a focus on studio-assisted pop experiments. The beauty of seeing Stereolab live, however, was discovering how much of their signature sound was really just down to them: from beginning to end, and through a cavalcade of new rhythm sections and sidemen, they were always at heart a tight little pop combo, and one that could swing and groove as easily as it could rev up the organ buzz. The sessions from this period start off with the track that just might be the high point of their recording history: a slow-mounting groove called ""Metronomic Underground"", from Emperor Tomato Ketchup, which reveals itself as every bit as band-in-a-room as their first singles-- the trick, for anyone who hasn't noticed, wasn't that Stereolab had some insane recording budget, but that they actually constructed songs that sounded massively interesting. This impression is only reinforced by the other tracks from Emperor Tomato Ketchup, without doubt the pinnacle of Stereolab as the architects of fascinating song-machines: the odd back-and-forth off-rhythm of ""Tomorrow Is Already Here"" and the peppy bubbling of ""Les Yper-Sound"" become clearer revelations the more you can hear the band actually playing them, and the gorgeous swooning of personal-favorite ""Slow Fast Hazel"", with its gently revolving bass and watery guitar breaks, is one of the finest things here. The Late Period. One popular music-geek game is the one that goes When Did This Band Stop Being Good, a mental diversion on which pretty much everyone with any interest in R.E.M. has spent some time. This game gets played a lot with Stereolab, with the biggest point of contention among moderates being whether Dots and Loops-- the most plainly and deliberately ""post-rock"" of Stereolab's albums-- was a well-formed flagship of the era or the point where Stereolab gave up. Dots and Loops is not represented at all on this collection; neither is Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night, which most everyone agrees was the Lab's first truly bad record, by-numbers to the point of self-parody. The band were mostly just unlucky: They released their first flop right at the moment when listeners were starting to move on anyway, and their passable return-to-form, Sound-Dust, was followed by the hugely tragic death of key member Mary Hansen. Sound-Dust is represented here by four tracks from a 2001 session, all of which-- surprisingly for those like me, who'd started shaking their heads around Cobra-- sound great, if sometimes a bit too ""easy."" As a Smiths-obsessed teenager, I played that band's albums to death, meaning my later Smiths listening always revolved around the less mediated perspectives of radio sessions and live recordings. The Stereolab-in-a-box on offer here has the potential to turn into the same for me: they play plenty of non-album songs throughout, the most fascinating being the EP track ""Pinball"", originally titled ""Heavenly Van Halen"" most likely because it sounds sort of like Heavenly, and sort of like Van Halen. The groop sounds great and tight and, well, the slightest bit different here, exposing how they functioned when scaled down to just instruments in a room. It's a rich and pretty glorious history. Far be it from me to go writing epitaphs for Stereolab already, but: it's been wonderful.","Stereolab have been a terrific band.

Deception Pass,D+,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86d13d1975652139653/1:1/w_160/ec7051e7.jpg,2003-05-04 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2122-deception-pass/,Knw-Yr-Own,"On their fourth album since 1997's self-titled debut, the Anacortes trio D+ still consists of Beat Happening's silent partner Bret Lunsford; Microphones nature boy Phil Elvrum; and my favorite ex-oyster shucker, Karl Blau. Promising! Although last year's Mistake was somewhat slight and uninspired (sometimes reminiscent of the tossed-off air of Beat Happening's self-titled yellow album), I had hope for Deception Pass: Elvrum seems to grow more ambitious daily, Beat Happening were often able to squeeze hooks from stones, and Blau's Clothes Your I's surprised the socks off me just a month ago. Instead, Deception Pass-- named for a narrow band of water separating Washington's Whidbey Island from the mainland-- is a skeletal, less rocking, and more Lunsford-centric Mistake (in a couple senses). The first track, ""Skin Me"", is paint-by-numbers love-rock reminiscent of a few too many seven-inches purchased solely because they came out on a label I trusted: listen twice, file with the rest of that forgettable international pop overflow. More painfully, on the eponymous ""Deception Pass"", Lunsford's a dead ringer for Kermit the Frog. I dare you to block out the saccharine harmony of ""Rainbow Connection"" as he warbles, ""The water's too cold, I know where you've been, the water's too cold, I know."" When D+ are less Kermit/more Silver Jews, the seas get friendlier. ""Blind Spot"" is a catchy pine-needle pop song with a good politico-fairy tale lyrical turn: ""I voted for the wrong whore/ I'm paying for the wrong war/ Mirror says we're fairest of all..."" On ""Kill the Messenger"", Elvrum's drums made me dote on ""Bad Seeds"" or a primitive Velvet Underground jam-- and everyone harmonizes over the chorus into a final minute of la-la-la's, rat-a-tat drums, and Blau's swooping, airy backup. Unfortunately, the less compelling 50-second ""I Don't Owe You Anything"" is awkwardly embarrassing poetry: ""Song is like a medicine... meta sin... meta sun/ Fill the groove of Edison... let us in... let us sin."" ""Sound"" offers interesting instrumentation redolent of Peter Jefferies' everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach: tapping, something like sandpaper, and the repeated line, ""I want to plant a sound."" Nice. ""No Charge"" is basically ""Advice to the Graduate"" for the seafaring. (Whoever thought David Berman made such a lasting impression?) So, Deception Pass does have its decent moments. But things go incredibly wrong when ""Camptown"" rolls around. Here, Brett and a piano remind us of that bourgeois mustached Snowman from the Rudolph Christmas special. It's of the Ernest Goes to Camp school of poetics. The mega-chirpy ""Blame-a-Holic"" could make even a stoic cringe: ""It's not me me me me me/ It's all you you you you you..."" And on the final track, ""We Could Do Anything"", things disintegrate into Queen-as-interpreted-by-early-pork-roll-egg-and-cheese Ween. Oh me oh my! If I could do a play-by-play of ""We Could Do Anything"", you still wouldn't understand the unbearable badness of its 25 minutes. In the spirit of completion, here's a bit: There's rain, rustling paper, maybe a water stick. Then we get a hand-clapping Blind Boys of Alabama campfire round: ""You got the upper hand when you up and died on me."" The rain thing reemerges. Pause. Silver Jews. Rain stops. Rain starts. It's fucking water torture! A guitar. Creaky gate. More rain? Radio hiss! Dials! People going between channels! Then there's a distorted voice singing about hell and pain. Computer voices bleeping about a hell mouth and somebody saying, ""Don't fuck with the dead."" The opus ends with Casio drums and a chilled-out breeze: Martin Denny after a KMFDM monsoon. Maybe D+ had extra studio time or decided to make a statement transcending the rest of their oeuvre? Hell, that's what Eddie does with Rimbaud in Eddie and the Cruisers, right? But it drove him crazy. Maybe this baroque ending is the deception of the title! You've made it from one end of the gorge to the other when all of a sudden, in comes the deus ex machina of Greek tragedy: Trent Reznor on a swinging cable starts a pallid avalanche and sinks your battleship. Everybody hurts!","On their fourth album since 1997's self-titled debut, the Anacortes trio D+ still consists of Beat Happening's silent ...

Necessary Measures,Pest,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a043ea9e61561daa4519/1:1/w_160/1fd82aaf.jpg,2003-05-04 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6246-necessary-measures/,Ninja Tune,"I'll say this for Ninja Tune: they're consistent with their product. They've developed a label identity that encompasses the ghosts of trip-hop and acid jazz, the freshness of engaging laptop hip-hop, and a cantankerous enjoyment of taking the piss out of all three. As a result, they're responsible for some of the most enjoyable and versatile electronic albums available, bridging genre gaps at every turn like they were cracks in the sidewalk. But when you're dishing out a product that the kiddies are digging, it becomes risky to switch things up. Crystal Pepsi, New Coke: you fuck with the formula slightly, and the consumer switches to some other brand till you bring back the classic stuff. Better to go the Pop-Tarts route-- give 'em 20 different flavors of the same pastry goodness-- and watch the units shift. In that sense, Pest's energetic, balls-out Necessary Measures is a success. It manages to taste like something (sort of) new using ingredients that can be found on any other disc in the Ninja Tune cupboard. Coming on like a more street-savvy hooligan incarnation of here-today-gone-today sensations The Avalanches, Pest spice up turntablism and jazzy breaks with a dash of party funk and sampledelia, aiming for a Solid Steel milestone. What they give us isn't quite so revelatory, but the pure manic energy the group exhibits keeps their debut album from getting completely lost in the newest wave of Ninja Tune products, which includes Super Numeri, Hint, Fog, and Jaga Jazzist. In execution, Pest couldn't do the Ninja Tune sound more justice. From the get-go they're lanky and rubbery, laying down fuzzy bass carpets, and slotting in horn and piano samples like they just hit the crate diggers' jackpot. The swingin' ""Duke Kerb Crawler"" keeps the big band bluster in check with a lazy beat, punctuated by stabs of brass, and Pest follow it up with the string-heavy ""Jefferson Shuffle"", a mash-up of symphonic soap opera theme music, snappy percussion, and a hilarious vocal bridge that devolves into a serious hip-hop break that occupies space somewhere between Ultramagnetic MCs and a wild bar mitzvah. ""Dr. Umz"", which begins as a fairly annoying loop only Mr. Magoo could love, explodes once Blackalicious' Gift of Gab starts rockin' the mic with his usual breathless cadence, turning what began as a lackluster four minutes into a definite keeper. When Pest play their cards right, they come across like Medeski, Martin & Wood or Bullfrog, packing a healthy underground swagger that permeates whatever genre they throw into the pot. But even when they're doing things right, their success is dictated by the prevailing laws of Ninja Tune. They fit the label's profile to a T, and so anything they do right on Necessary Measures is stuff you've heard done right before. With the exception of the closer (track five on the vinyl version), ""Relief"", with its jangling, Paul Simon-circa-Graceland guitar and inventive, lo-fi beat, everything here is disposable-- even the good stuff. Pest don't need any help sounding indistinguishable, but at least half of the ten tracks here seem ready and willing to lend a hand in the effort. The thick ""Heard Your Bird Moved In"" could easily be a Mr. Scruff outtake, and Gift of Gab was already put to much better use by DJ Vadim. And for all of its lovely moments, ""St. Pest"" is guilty of robbing Animals on Wheels' piano closet blind. Removed from the context of the Ninja Tune multiverse, perhaps Pest would fair better. But my instincts tell me that Necessary Measures would remain indistinct no matter what label was putting it out. To put it another way, the album tastes pretty good, but I've been drinking this down since '96. Instead of producing a sound that comfortably approximates what's come before, Pest should be working on their strengths and fine-tuning their approach, finding their own identity. So what if it ends up tasting like Coke II? There must have been someone out there that just couldn't get enough of that shit.","I'll say this for Ninja Tune: they're consistent with their product.

Red Cross,John Fahey,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1bea9e61561daa7638/1:1/w_160/e4ffbbf6.jpg,2003-05-04 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2945-red-cross/,Revenant,"Joey and Dee Dee, Joe Strummer... it's been a bleak stretch lately. My adolescent heroes are a vanishing breed, it seems, yet Pat Boone might as well be immortal-- where's the justice? It's a bum deal, really: you care enough about an artist's music, and somewhere down the line you end up caring about the person behind it, too. Artists give themselves up in their work, and we connect with that small part of them, though they're probably folks most of us have never even seen or known. But confronting the knowledge that suddenly there's no one on the receiving end of your myriad, tiny bonds leaves an emptiness. It's minor, sure, but to me at least, it's undeniable, and writing about it is even worse. There's little room in criticism for eulogy (and vice versa), leaving the underlying sentiment merely to seep in through the cracks. Still, the vague knowledge of loss remains. John Fahey died following a sextuple bypass on February 22nd, 2001, six days before he would turn sixty-one, after co-authoring the emancipation of acoustic guitars everywhere, freeing them from the shackles of their American roots masters. With barely more than spare, deliberately picked acoustic finger patterns and the often eerie hollowness in between, ""he was the first to demonstrate that the finger-picking techniques of traditional country and blues steel-string guitar could be used to express a world of non-traditional musical ideas-- harmonies and melodies you'd associate with Bartók, Charles Ives, or maybe the music of India,"" in the words of (of all people) his close friend and colleague, Dr. Demento. This omnipresent restlessness with his chosen medium even led him to disown much of his early work in favor of experimental drones and extended forays into free-form musique concrete. His output is vast, and owing to the constant flux of trends it contains, quite humbling. Listening to the echoing ghosts of ""Remember"", Fahey's morose take on the Irving Berlin standard that opens Red Cross, it's hard not to absent-mindedly begin searching its haunting stillnesses and recesses for hidden goodbyes, or some tell-tale resolution. It casts the rest of the album in such heartbreaking shades that the need for closure (of a sort) is almost palpable. Through retrospective artifice, though, it's all too easy to see so much in little more than a title, and in the end this opening piece is more of an open question. Much of the album nods to moments throughout Fahey's career, perhaps accidentally, but nonetheless offering thin glimpses of his stylistic diversity, with ""Remember"" poised to prepare the listener. Although the delicate acoustic works of Red Cross are powerful, they only mimic things Fahey has accomplished a dozen times before, and better. He's been rightly accused of a lingering redundancy in his recent work, but this album seems more readily taken as a conscious overview. The memories stirred up by these compositions are very purposeful, if only half-formed. The unsettling but still beautiful hollows can't help but invite nostalgia. Fahey began to accept his more traditional material late in life, reassessing the worth of the blues and standards he had once disavowed, and Red Cross certainly shows hints of his own coming to terms. Allusions to the amorphous compositions of his later years are kept side-by-side with a minor helping of refreshingly straightforward arrangements. He approaches the classic George Gershwin tune ""Summertime"" in his typically painstaking fashion, realizing it as less of a warm weather romp than a ballad of bittersweet solitude. Where there was once ye olde swimmin' hole and children playing stickball in the street, the kids aren't allowed to go to the lake since some hapless child drowned last summer, and the streets and playgrounds are all disquietingly barren. Only the vague peace that comes from memories of simpler times remains. Similarly, the original composition ""Charlie Bradley's Ten-Sixty-Six Blues"", is also reminiscent of vintage material, not as impressive as his most concerted efforts toward country-blues form, but still breathtaking in its remarkable quietism. And it fares better than the dry, Arabian ""Ananaias"" or ""Red Cross, Disciple of Christ Today"" with its uncomfortably spare string-bending; respectively, they evoke the exotic promise of Fahey's seminal acoustic ragas and his bold forays into noise, but ultimately fail to develop fully. In a way, these meandering explorations are a hallmark of his own, and (particularly in the seven-minute expanse of ""Ananaias"") contain more than a few enlightening passages without necessarily forming a cohesive whole. The only real misstep is ""Untitled with Rain"". For six minutes, the song flows leisurely across faintly ringing organ tones and chimes, with just a few scattered notes recalling some of Fahey's concrete leanings. At that moment, the music dissipates into eighteen minutes of thoroughly impenetrable silence while the ambient noise of a deserted studio is mic'd up for, presumably, listening pleasure. Sadly, his generally keen abstract edge is at its dullest-- any similar track from City of Refuge makes this seem like a cheap gimmick. And worse, if it weren't for the (almost fittingly) unnamed tonal reverb of the track's final two minutes, the closing seconds of his final album would conclude in a vacuum. Even if Red Cross is less of a striking conclusion than a broad summation, it's a tragedy to allow the vague recognitions elicited here to evaporate into nothing. It's silence in remembrance of a talented, haunted man, but he deserves a eulogy, and his guitar speaks better than anyone ever could.","Joey and Dee Dee, Joe Strummer... it's been a bleak stretch lately.

Rounds,Four Tet,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be09ea9e61561daa782a/1:1/w_160/566c7497.jpg,2003-05-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3166-rounds/,Domino,"Free jazz drummer Milford Graves has a nice trick that he performs at his shows: He brings someone in the audience up on stage and asks them to feel for his heart rate. It starts out steady, but as the person holds both wrists, it slows, and Graves begins to diverge his bloodstream on either side of his body, finally achieving an internal polyrhythmic pulse between the two points. Then he jumps behind his kit and clatters away in ecstasy. Four Tet's lone member, Kieran Hebden, is fascinated with the impossible rhythms that the free-form jazz greats could bang out as they pleased. Whether or not he's taking a page out of Milford Graves' book is debatable, but he opens ""Hands"" with a cardiac sample fibrillating into a multi-limbed percussive rattle of densely edited and seemingly random drum hit samples that just starts to stroke Barry Altschul's beard before locking down into a hip-hop groove. He fades the cymbals' sizzles into the pseudo-Clyde Stubblefield sticks of ""She Moves She"", a cycling song evenly spaced with wheeling rimshots, scattered gongs, and funky string plucks that veer around the car horns that bleat past. ""My Angel Rocks Back and Forth"" gently blows iron-lung sighs through ride cymbals and dirty, run-out grooves while an austere piano twinkles, hinting at the sort of gentle sounds Hebden will soon weave around English folk legend Vashti Bunyan. Verging on the lugubrious is the nine-minute ""Unspoken"" (whose piano riff is lifted from, of all sources, Tori Amos' ""Winter""), but Hebden's touch keeps it from morass. Here, he controls his ingredients-- fictitious soundbytes of early Gato Barbieri sax, a plaintive finger or two from McCoy Tyner, broken chimes, backwards feedback, and a DJ Shadow kickdrum-- keeping them at a contemplative simmer, rather than allowing them to come to a full boil. ""Chia"" is a tabla-bubbling conduit to the mod bass and shimmying sitar of ""As Serious as Your Life"", namechecking the crucial free-jazz text by Val Wilmer, yet standing much closer to Miles Davis' On the Corner, with those odd-metered handclaps and that stuttering punch of a Jack DeJohnette hi-hat. With metallophone ripples at a wake, ""And They All Look Broken Hearted"" is an abstract and solemn affair, recalling the oddly melodic cadence of a player like Bobby Hutcherson, and with spliced drum solos swirling around some affected harpsichord and vibraphones like club smoke, Hebden captures the cool sadness of old Blue Note posters. It sounds like a shoo-in for the album's closing track, but it instead leads up to ""Slow Jam"", which has that long goodbye of the best melancholy closers, a circle game of echoing footsteps, fitful static, gleeful kazoos, lulling guitar repetitions, and shadows surely sinking in, revolving all disparate sounds to resolution. Freely moving in and out of cycles, able to coalesce or evanesce in a heartbeat, straight up and down, or else banging about like a toddler on the pot shelf, Rounds funnels every element through the drum, which always remains at the forefront of the mix. But what gives this record its internal order, and allows it to stand out against previous laptop explorations of immense record collections, is the other genres Hebden dabbles in and draws upon to flesh out the beat. Though hardly obvious the first time through, there's the supple, propulsive fun of funk, as well as the pastoral placidity of folk, both moving over the cut-up rhythms like cumulous clouds, allowing hot light through at some junctures, but cooling things out with a darker umbrage in others. Rounds may not be ""as serious as your life,"" as one track proclaims, but it does feel that pulse.","Free jazz drummer Milford Graves has a nice trick that he performs at his shows: He brings someone in the ...

Beyond the Blue Heaven,Saboten,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32dc0084474cd0c01f6/1:1/w_160/ac568977.gif,2003-05-01 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6959-beyond-the-blue-heaven/,God Mountain,"Like many post-rock cosmicians, Japan's The Saboten excel in music that works at least as well as a backdrop as it does the feature attraction. But where DJ Force, guitarist Saguaro, and Tokyo underground legend Hoppy Kamiyama might concoct an ambience in common with Western space-mixers DJ Spooky or Instrumentals-era Mouse on Mars, their real talents seem closer to cinematic sound design. Over the course of six albums (including soundtrack work), they've refined an identity well-suited to colors of bliss, exotica and quease-- sometimes with the aid of sex and bondage imagery (try ""ass hole box"" as an instrument), though most often with a mere mastery of electronic textures. Kamiyama's experience as a producer and arranger doesn't hurt, but as with many of the best Japanese bands today (and German ones from yesterday), it's the voice of one from many that resonates loudest. Simply, The Saboten make a soft noise that, at its best, soothes the savage trip. Beyond the Blue Heaven does feature heady stuff-- especially on the opener, ""Helicoid Spume"". Beginning as a low murmur, the track takes its time revealing small details over a 30-minute course that ultimately seems shorter. The bass-hum gradually exposes itself as the rattle of a slow-motion helicopter, and from the distance looms a high-pitched (but hardly piercing) digital whistle. The pastel synth tones are like mist on an already moist pallet, and soon the whistle dissolves into runny static. A human voice in the left channel manages a single syllable, panned across the mix, and before I have a chance to notice the volume has come up, the helicopter jumps an octave, and tower bells and some kind of intermittent jittering clang replace the synth tones. Soon, the whirling, whipping blades of the machine jut out beyond the rest of the pack-- though not so much as to completely drown out the percolating vintage Cluster line in the left. This is the kind of track that, from a distance, might seem a gigantic, spiraling mess, but it's pretty exhilarating from inside the eye of the storm. So it's all the stranger that The Saboten should choose a nourish jazz piece as the other half of the record. ""NÖK"" blasts out of the gate with a full horn section and the percussion of Ruins leader Tatsuya Yoshida (who, for whatever reason, is quickly becoming the de facto Japanese ""jazz"" drummer). They blare and bawl something fierce for a few moments, when suddenly everything drops, and a Fender Rhodes strums out a couple of cocktail lounge chords. There's a little computer-driven feedback for spice, but when the horns come in, the vibe is obviously ""lowdown"" and ""bluesy."" The contrast with the previous tune is a little jarring, but given that The Saboten tend to let their ideas wander off now and again, you have plenty of time to gather your wits. Much of ""NÖK"" reminds me of John Zorn's experiments in noir-jazz, especially that of some of his Filmworks series. Of course, when I asked Kamiyama about this music, he told me it was supposed to be a combination of Kraftwerk and Sun Ra, so who knows? As an album, I'm not sure Beyond the Blue Heaven makes much sense, but in the scheme of most of these guys' careers, that's not really a criticism. Truth be told, the second tune doesn't really even get going until midway through when it becomes a free-funk tune and everyone starts playing at once, so haphazard choices were probably the order of the day. I might recommend a few other Kamiyama projects before this one, but where The Saboten win is in their dedication to milking a mood, and in making epic soundscapes seem like a walk in the park.","Like many post-rock cosmicians, Japan's The Saboten excel in music that works at least as well as a backdrop ...

"If He Is Protecting Our Nation, Then Who Will Protect Big Oil, Our Children?",Of Montreal,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f1b1335d7bf16983a3/1:1/w_160/d88a3aab.gif,2003-05-01 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5949-if-he-is-protecting-our-nation-then-who-will-protect-big-oil-our-children/,Track & Field,"These days, most food products are so thoroughly labeled that unpleasant surprises are virtually inevitable. Fat and saturated fat contents are laid out in familiar gram quantities and percentages, anything that's come within thirty miles of a peanut is generally labeled as such, and potentially misleading words like ""healthy"" have been yanked from packages of those sneaky little gummy bears. Most people who aren't named Tipper Gore seem to be pretty firmly against placing warning labels on CDs. And considering the fact that the current labeling system consists only of a single sticker, who can blame them? I think a more detailed, descriptive music labeling system is in order. You know, like listing the ingredients: ""guitar noodling, harmonica solos, histrionic vocals, overproduction,"" that sort of thing. Or maybe more useful labels like, ""contains 115% RDA of vocoders,"" ""not a significant source of songwriting prowess,"" or even ""please recycle."" Were such a system to be implemented, If He Is Protecting Our Nation, Then Who Will Protect Big Oil, Our Children? would most likely bear the following, much-needed sticker: WARNING: Tour-only odds-and-ends release, contains minimal nutritional value. Truth be told, I had no idea what to make of this disc when I first saw it in stores. Its title and cover art, in which George W. Bush ejaculates oil onto a young boy's head, led me to believe it might be a political-type record. And that seemed like a pretty intriguing concept to me-- to filter the sometimes incredibly surreal state of world affairs through Of Montreal's fantastical, often child-like music could certainly yield some interesting results. Sadly, as the aforementioned labeling system is not yet in place, it wasn't until I opened up the album that I realized this was not the case. Instead, If He Is Protecting Our Nation offers a disjointed collection of unreleased songs and alternate versions of album material. It would be tempting to say that this album suffers from a simple lack of unity, but their previous singles compilation, Horse & Elephant Eatery, showed the band more than capable of stringing together a great record from disparate sources. The problem is that, quite simply, the material on If He Is Protecting Our Nation just isn't that good. Case in point: ""There Is Nothing Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"", in which Kevin Barnes reads off a list of the usual complaints musicians hurl at critics: ""What makes you think that you're better than anyone?/ You don't even create, you just critique,"" then, ""There's something wrong with you/ There's nothing wrong with me!"" Ouch! Sorry, Kevin, but a lot of us critics, with our ""corrupt"" hearts, actually really like a lot of your music! I'm not even really that opposed to anti-rock-critic anthems-- The Bevis Frond's ""There's Always One"", aside from being a great song, actually contains some insightful and well-founded complaints, my favorite being, ""Is it cool to be The Velvets/ But pathetic to be Cream?"" Unfortunately, ""There Is Nothing Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"" isn't a particularly memorable song, as Kevin Barnes' voice hovers somewhere between a strangely compelling, paranoid shriek, and his usual bell-clear delivery without ever fully delivering on the power of either. With its fully rocked-out sound, ""There Is Nothing Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"" is pretty anomalous for If He Is Protecting Our Nation, most of which consists of a watered-down incarnation of this band's signature sound. All the hyperactive Of Montreal chord changes, oddball lyrics, and off-kilter melodies are here, but the production is pretty thin throughout, and the melodies aren't nearly as strong as they've been on countless past releases. ""What a Strange Day with a Swede"", ""Christmas Isn't Safe for Animals"" and ""An Ill-Treated Hiccups"" are all cohesive, well-conceived songs that suffer from the lack of a strong hook. Even if they're not the catchiest in the Of Montreal catalog, these songs at least manage to convey Barnes' unique songwriting style in all its playfulness. Throwaway tracks like the almost-tonal rock noodling of ""Barely Asian at the Beefcake Horizon"", the sped-up pseudo-skit ""Charlie and Freddy"", and a worthless bongos-n-bass ""beatnik"" reinterpretation of ""Mimi Merlot"" may have been fun to create, but offer little impetus for repeat listening. If He Is Protecting Our Nation started out as a tour-only bonus album, and it sounds like one. If you like Of Montreal enough to truly enjoy this album, odds are you've already picked it up. If not, don't say you weren't warned.","These days, most food products are so thoroughly labeled that unpleasant surprises are virtually inevitable. Fat and saturated fat contents ...

Mit Gas,Tomahawk,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d65e6ef9596932108c/1:1/w_160/79a6313e.jpg,2003-05-01 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8099-mit-gas/,Ipecac,"I like to imagine Mike Patton's mind in similar terms as rural America; it's a nice place to visit, but I sure as hell wouldn't want to live there. A world where maniacal hitchhikers wait for unsuspecting Samaritans at the edge of town and midgets and harelips cavort in saturnalian bliss on empty carnival grounds might offer a fair amount of solace to extreme cases of psychological disability, but for a normal guy like me it's a tourist destination and nothing more. Patton, on the other hand, seems perfectly at ease with his permanent residency in the macabre corners of the psyche. After almost single-handedly inventing rap-metal (or at least stealing the patent from Chuck Mosely) with Faith No More, he spent most of the next decade-plus growling, shrieking and spitting his way from a blip on the pop culture radar screen to certifiable obscurity, thanks to his work with Fantômas and a pair of solo records on fellow nutjob John Zorn's Tzadik imprint. But somewhere between starting his own record label to prove that there are other weirdos out there making music as thoroughly twisted as his, and crooning his way to soft-porn nirvana with Dan the Automator on Lovage, Patton answered a call from ex-Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison-- turns out Denison has an unquenchable fetish for writing music for oddball singers, and Patton was just the scratch to relieve his itch. With fellow musclemen John Stanier (late of Helmet) and Kevin Rutmanis (ex-Cows, The Melvins) fleshing out the DNA strain for this new monster, they christened it Tomahawk and started scalping motherfuckers from the get-go. Not only was their 2001 self-titled debut easily Patton's best work since his Faith No More/Mr. Bungle heyday, but the band also managed to land an opening slot with wannabe-freaks Tool (presumably to lend the headliners some cred on the mentally impaired circuit)-- giving weight to the long-debated theory that routinely being booed off the stage by 15,000 black-clad teenagers only solidifies your resolve as a working musical unit. Although I'm not usually susceptible to press release anti-hyperbole like ""Mit Gas finds Tomahawk more comfortable working together as a proper group,"" I'll be damned if there isn't something to that little bit of PR wisdom that accompanies Tomahawk's second full-length. For one, Patton's keyboards play an inextricable role within the band this time out, allowing the group to straddle the distance between ambience and onslaught even more remarkably than on its first record. This is especially evident on instrumental segues like the untitled section between ""You Can't Win"" and ""Mayday"" and the self-contained ""Harlem Clowns"", both of which suggest that the band could improvise an entire set off of something similar and it would be virtually mindblowing. Adding to Tomahawk's musical evolution is the fact that Denison's guitar lines are significantly less riff-oriented than before; sure, he's still just as likely to throw down some Zeppelin-worthy flatted-fifth power chords, but he spends more of his time clearing the room for Patton to throw his voice around like an abusive stepfather. Song-wise, there are some real killers on Mit Gas-- cuts that reference the intensity of the self-titled record but still manage to take it to a higher level. ""Rape This Day"" and ""Mayday"" both have Herculean punk-rock choruses that pimp-slap any and all competition into a fetal position, while ""You Can't Win"" uses a cheap drum machine to approximate the sound of horseflies buzzing around a rotting foxtrot corpse. ""Capt. Midnight"" is equally abrasive-yet-melodic, as it builds the band's newfound mastery of dynamic tension into an epic meditation on something to do with ""don't be afraid"" and ""stinking lies."" In fact, the only track that's downright displaced is the Spanish-language ""love song"" ""Desastre Natural""-- while the realization that Patton can now inflict his disturbed will upon millions more in foreign lands is frightening, the song as a whole is about as entertaining as Enrique Iglesias on crystal meth. Now, I could try to pass off my own PR jive like ""Mit Gas isn't for the faint of heart"" or some other bullshit cliché like that, but I'd just be rehashing what was already obvious as soon as I mentioned Patton's name in the first sentence (not to mention that I'd also be writing like a goddamn chump). But anyone who gets off on a good old-fashioned visit to the dark side like I do (to reiterate, keyword = ""visit"") should turn the volume up, sit back, and picture Patton growing fins and a Hitler mustache while taking this Teutonic geek show on the road.","I like to imagine Mike Patton's mind in similar terms as rural America; it's a nice place to ...

Soft Sounds,Velvet Crush,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9845e6ef95969321422/1:1/w_160/ee7ce63c.jpg,2003-05-01 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8510-soft-sounds/,Action Musik,"If there's a touch of irony anywhere on this record, it's in the cover art. A rather playful series of references to the Velvet Underground, it puts the reverence for rock and roll's past that Velvet Crush mainmen Ric Menck and Paul Chastain on full display, but it turns out they chose the wrong band to pay homage to. The Velvet Underground were all fiery confrontation, restless exploration and urban decay, and the Velvet Crush are really none of that; if anything, they're revivalist, pious, and utterly suburban. But they did get one thing right on the cover of their latest album, and that's the title. Soft Sounds abound on this, their fifth proper full-length, and first since 1999. Long gone is the hyperactive jangle and thick guitar sound that propelled 1994's Teenage Symphonies to God and their other early records, replaced instead with a piano-dominated sound that perhaps reflects older age and deeper thought, but doesn't excite quite as much. It's not nearly as extreme as, say, Eric Carmen leaving the Raspberries and recording \x93All By Myself\x94, but it's sort of the same idea. Even with the change in sound, the Crush keep it in the Me decade, as evidenced by the Badfinger/America/Big Star harmonies and Leslied guitar that pop up on the slow-gaited opener \x93Staying Found\x94. \x93Don't Take Me Dowx94 is the sole look back at the band's early nineties basement days, Paul Chastaix92s gentle tenor sounding just as good today as it did when he relocated from Champaign-Urbana to Rhode Island over a decade ago. Menck grabs the mic for a heavily countrified take on the Boxtops' \x93Rollix92 in My Sleep\x94 that lays yet another wreath at the Shrine of Chilton, but never approaches his ragged delivery. A pair of additional covers reveal where the boys' musical heads have been lately, though they bring everything they touch right back to their own middle ground. Their take on Fleetwood Mac's \x93Save Me a Place\x94-- originally on that band's wild Tusk-- could almost be counted radical for the way it reins the song in and makes it sound conventional (for a recent version closer in spirit, if not sound, to the original, check out Camper Van Beethovex92s version on their full-length cover of the entire Tusk album). Stranger is their version of Scott Walker's \x93Duchess\x94, which oddly sounds almost exactly like \x93Knockix92 on Heavex92s Door\x94. Chastain does his best, but only a few vocalists can handle Scott Walker truly well, and he really isn't one of them. Looming huge in the background throughout the album is Matthew Sweet, who recorded Soft Sounds over the course of a couple years and plays a host of instruments. Though he leaves the spotlight to the band (as any producer should), and his voice blends seamlessly into most of the harmonies, there are times when you can definitely pick out his guitar. With so many fey tenors going at once, comparisons to Grand Prix-era Teenage Fanclub are apt, while \x93Some Kind of Light\x94 is a veritable Ocean Blue tainted with Quaaludes. In the final equation, the Velvet Crush wear their new, more velvety sound well-- flourishes like the jazzy arrangement of \x93Party Line (Samba)\x94 are definitely welcome-- but it would be nice to get more than just one old-fashioned hit of jangle. Teenage Symphonies... is still their best, even all these years later, but Soft Sounds is a fine record on its own merit, sure to earn repeat listens now and then.","If there\x92s a touch of irony anywhere on this record, it\x92s in the cover art.

Bad Timing,Grand Mal,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf86c0084474cd0c3051/1:1/w_160/76551f6a.jpg,2003-04-30 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3542-bad-timing/,Arena Rock,"Bill Whitten knows what he's talking about when it comes to bad timing: with his early-90s band St. Johnny, the Grand Mal leader got a couple toes in the door as part of the post-Nirvana alterna-signing sweepstakes, arriving too late to cash in on the opportunity. Where that might be enough to discourage an average rocker, inviting the certain state of laziness that so often results from near-successes, Whitten reinvented himself as glam-rock savior well ahead of the current revivalist trend-- except now that he's perfected the style, it's already a casualty of overexposure and style-over-substance bandwagon-jumpers. So when Whitten sings that the ""21st century/ Bores the hell out of me"" on ""Duty Free"", I'm inclined to believe him, because what better way to erase time's relevance from the equation but to live in the past, a past where Marc Bolan still swaggers to the bang of a gong, Lou Reed still can't decide whether he'd rather score speed or chase transvestites, and the Replacements weren't even a twinkle in papa Alex Chilton's eye. Still, all the dramatic nostalgia in the world is useless unless the songs are there to back it up, and that's where Whitten has surpassed his previous two outings with Grand Mal. All eleven tracks on Bad Timing are gems that balance a knack for brain-lodging choruses with the grime and stylistic drift of Exile on Main Street, begging a record collection's worth of comparisons with nary an instance of outright thievery. Whitten's lyrics are about as sharp as they come-- lines like ""She says I look like a fascist/ With my black mustaches"" (""Old Fashioned""), ""She was standin' on the corner/ Smokin' marijuana/ Drinkin' Hi-C"" (""Duty Free""), and ""She was a first round knockout/ She was a beauty school dropout/ She was full from the fat of the land"" (""1st Round K.O."") just skim the surface of the singer's knack for unlikely rhymes and clever turns of phrase. He even manages to adopt an impartial narrative style on tracks like ""Disaster Film"" that packs more gritty urban drama into five minutes than Dick Wolf can spew forth in an entire season of Law & Order spinoffs. Of course, Dave ""You might remember me from such productions as The Soft Bulletin, Deserter's Songs and Hate"" Fridmann's presence behind the boards certainly doesn't hurt. Though Fridmann has worked with Whitten regularly, dating back to the St. Johnny days, Bad Timing is the first record where they've really connected on a visionary level. Fridmann seems to consciously avoid going the heavily orchestrated route that has worked so well with the Lips and Mercury Rev, instead allowing Whitten to stick to the rawk while adding just enough sonic tweaks to warp things out of the ordinary-- unless female backup singers that sound as if they've been duct-taped into the mix or slide guitar disguised as a gobbling turkey don't qualify as unusual anymore. The only real problem that Whitten has to contend with now is keeping a band together long enough to take this new batch of songs on the road-- he's the only member of the current five-piece Grand Mal lineup that even played on this record. As of this writing there's still room at the end of the coattails for another New York band or two, but in a year, as elephants represent the best that indie rock and US politics to the masses, Whitten's Bad Timing may-- regrettably-- find him slipping through the cracks of consequence yet again.","Bill Whitten knows what he's talking about when it comes to bad timing: with his early-90s band St. Johnny ...

Demonlover OST,Sonic Youth,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c15e6ef95969320943/1:1/w_160/6bbe3582.gif,2003-04-30 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7346-demonlover-ost/,SND,"I've come to the realization that I'm never going to figure out noise. Nothing is more humbling to this supposed music expert than the experience of downloading a high-rated album by a Fennesz or a Whitman, only to be confronted with head-scratching experimentalism my pop-lovin' head can't even begin to wrap around, like sampling a drug and not understanding what the big deal is. I wouldn't dare think that the reviewers who celebrated the music were, in fact, wrong, due to the highly eloquent and clearly passionate writing it inspired in them, so instead I face the fact that I'm almost always going to enjoy reading a Richardson review more than I would enjoy the music he was writing about. But with Sonic Youth, it's not so simple keeping the noise segregated out of my sight and off my hard drive. Having developed in an avant-garde culture with the likes of Glenn Branca, the band has generally made no easy separation between their ha-ha-""accessible"" content and the more difficult material in their catalog. And as a dutiful fan, I give most everything a shot, including the obtuse-as-fuck SYR series (""what is this, a field recording from inside a vacuum?""). Now this soundtrack for the French arthouse film, Demonlover-- which is certainly not to be confused with the 1985 flop, My Demon Lover, starring latter-day Family Ties star Scott Valentine-- is the next test of my SY-devotion and patience. By my count, it's their third work for the screen, after the early noodling scorework for Made in USA (the reissue of which my 14-year-old self was duly suckered into buying) and the actually quite nice strip mall desolation music for Eric Bogosian's woefully-dated slacker opera SubUrbia. Demonlover's plot, something about virtual reality porn involving Gina Gershon, sounds fit for late-night Cinemax rotation, but the Youth's soundtrack is hardly bwom-bwom-chikka wood-paneling and waterbed music. The leadoff track, ""Move Away"", sounds like an abstract Sonic Youth project I can get into, despite Kim moving back towards the demented cheerleader style of vocals that was thankfully absent from Murray Street. With an easy, laid-back, funkish three-guitar groove (read: wah-wah pedals), softly purring feedback, and Steve Shelley keeping a steady, grounding beat, it's got the kind of improvisational flair I've always hoped for out of SY-- a way to reconcile my childhood love for a happy jammy band that shall remain nameless with my more ma-toor appreciation for the indie rock. After this enticing slice, however, Demonlover moves off into quiet, ambient drone territory, which, as we've already established, is rather frightening and alien to this reviewer. But now, in my professional capacity as a critic of musical oddities, I've buckled down and given it a shot, trying it out in different environs, hoping to unlock the secret of the noise. Cranked up on headphones, I'll admit it gave a late-night walk to the video store a rather cinematic feel, feedback curling like the manhole smoke. On my harsh-lit morning subway ride, the more mechanical sounds blended with the heavy machinery whir around me. Before bed, it, well, put me to sleep-- not necessarily a bad thing, considering I once fell asleep at a Sigur Rós show and loved it. But despite all these incidences of context-enriching, I still find it difficult to say I actually enjoy listening to Demonlover. For starters, the ramshackle, rhythmless percussion found on most tracks (""Control Freak"", ""Teknikal Illprovisation"") conjures up the same old train imagery I always get from abstract pieces, leading me to conclude I either had some profound pre-memory experience with trains, or that the textures here are not exactly groundbreaking if they sound familiar to me. While I wouldn't make the foolish assumption that the songs on Demonlover are dashed-off, many strike me as profoundly unfinished, like blocks of marble left partially unsculpted. ""Control Freak"", in its second half, blooms into a delicate interplay of riffs that sound like they'll explode any minute into a Daydream Nation epic... but then the track just ends. ""Electric Noisefield"" and ""Superdead"" could be the exhilarating exploratory sections in the middle of any number of SY tracks, but without melodic bookends they seem overly weightless. A handful of the sonic canvases whipped up by the band are at least surface-interesting, but am I alone in thinking that the addition of Jim O'Rourke to the lineup detracts somehow from their mystical edge in projects like this, eliminating the ubiquitous ""wow, this is all guitars?!"" response? Given the confessional nature of this review, it'd be more than fair to say that I'm probably not the best person to review this album. And really, without experiencing these compositions in the context of the film for which they were created, perhaps nobody is really capable of judging the competency of this material. But Sonic Youth must know that they have a spectrum of fans, ranging from those who bought Dirty on a Cobain rec, to those who think everything since the Sonic Death bootleg has been a sellout. I'd plot myself somewhere in the middle (you know, that SYR vacuum track is kinda cool), and I can't help but find Demonlover not only over my head, but a little bit on the dull side. Appendix: Demonlover also features a track each from Goldfrapp, Death in Vegas, Dub Squad, and Soulfly. Disappointingly, none are collaborations with Sonic Youth as my MP3 files suggested, and they're all pretty expendable, ranging from the kitschy Bond theme of Goldfrapp's ""Lovely Head"" to the absolutely godawful goatee rap-rock of Soulfly's ""Back to the Primitive"". Though come to think of it, a hot 3D sex scene set to Soulfly would probably be a lot sexier than one accompanied by ""Electric Noisefield"".","I've come to the realization that I'm never going to figure out noise.

Fight Test EP,The Flaming Lips,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb5ea9e61561daa7773/1:1/w_160/9bcae8d7.jpg,2003-04-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3083-fight-test-ep/,Warner Bros.,"When all is said and done, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots was a great record, especially for an album that wasn't exactly loved by everybody when it first hit the file-trading circuit. Admired and enjoyed? Sure, but mostly, mixed or lukewarm reactions to the record slowly grew into devotion. It took me a lot of listens before Yoshimi's silly, sometimes childlike songs revealed themselves as a heartbreaking meditations on life and death. Not to tug your heartstrings, but I lost a loved one around the time I bought this album; now I can't hear it without getting a little choked up. How many modern artists could give us such a personal take on accepting mortality, and then throw balloons all over it? Certainly not Cat Stevens, whose weepy, pedantic ""Father and Son"" provided the melody for ""Fight Test""-- one of the Lips' greatest songs, and the centerpiece of this post-Yoshimi EP. Granted, the band admits to cribbing the tune, and yes, the lyrics are disarmingly simple; read literally, the song is just about a couple guys fighting over a girl. But saying this is ""just"" a pop song is like saying a classic Roman arch is a pile of stone with a slit up the middle. ""Fight Test"" is majestically architected. It speaks so purely about an idea-- steeling yourself up for something you don't want to face-- that it can resonate with anyone, especially as Wayne Coyne's empathic vocals ride Dave Fridmann's finest flying saucer production and bold orchestration. That's the only song on the Fight Test EP that isn't new; it's followed by six live and rare tracks-- including a set of cover songs recorded for radio sessions, selected from the promo-only offering Yoshimi Wins! Unfortunately, the novelty factor of hearing the Lips tackle other people's pop hits counts for more than what they do to them. It's as if Wayne told the guys, ""Hey, why don't you go hose out the rabbit suits? I'm gonna stay here and knock out these arrangements."" We start with Kylie Minogue's disco-tech smash ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", which is slowed to a dirge and buried under maudlin organ. It's an effective way to bring out the desperation in the lyrics, but I'd rather hear the Lips turn up the beat and knock this track on its ass. Their performance of Beck's ""The Golden Age"", meanwhile, is as solid but submissive as you'd expect from, well, Beck's backing band. Then you have Radiohead's ""Knives Out"", an interesting band for the Lips to set themselves against. In these troubled times, a lot of rock fans are sitting around waiting for some band to hand over the perfect protest song, one short ditty that could somehow encapsulate everything that's wrong with the world today. But sometimes we forget the few bands-- including Radiohead and The Flaming Lips-- who have given us a more nuanced response to the state of the world (or at least to the mental state of their fans). And while Radiohead treads on gloomier themes, the Lips take the opposite tact of emboldening the individual: Wayne Coyne's like your coach, and the game is to not let your head detonate when you turn on the news. So, what does this clash of important bands yield? Sadly, not much-- the Lips' fuzziness and squawking guitar are, at best, a very weird substitute for Radiohead's tense, insistent rhythms. After the covers comes the only other Yoshimi track, ""Do You Realize??"", which has been remixed and rendered club-friendly by DJ-of-the-moment-five-minutes-ago Scott Hardkiss (really, it could as easily have been John Digweed, Timo Maas, or Danny Tenaglia). Hardkiss's treatment makes the band's ""happy death song"" longer and brighter, but somehow, the lyrics lose their punch without the over-the-top production of the original. And ""The Strange Design of Conscience""-- one of two brand-new tracks-- almost reaches Yoshimi-level meditations, but is too wordy and relies too much on blips and bloops than broad strokes or sharp hooks. Fortunately, the final track fares far better than the rest of the entire disc (title track excepted): ""Thank You Jack White (For the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)"" is a little ditty that recounts the time they were playing in Detroit, and The White Stripes frontman came backstage to give them a present. [Note to Ryan: Tell the newswire they can relax-- we just made our Jack White reference quota for today.] While on the surface it seems like a throwaway track, the lyrics are funnier, the melody catchier and the entire song better thought-out than it needed to be. The songwriting, in fact, hearkens back to a much earlier Flaming Lips period-- the oft-glazed-over Transmissions from the Satellite Heart era, back when the band was more concerned with goofy, feelgood pop songs than beautiful, grandiose statements. Still, I think I speak for most fans when I wonder why Warner opted for this track selection over an official release for all the great songs recorded during the Yoshimi sessions that didn't make the album. ""Up Above the Daily Hum"", ""Funeral in My Head"", the Japanese version of the title track, and all the others are generally accepted to be on par with any of the album's eleven existing cuts. They may be available on import singles, but since this will likely be the only Yoshimi companion piece to receive a U.S. release, it would be nice if they'd issued them all together in one place, or even expanded this disc to a mini-LP to make room for them. Coasting mainly on novelty tunes, this EP isn't exactly essential listening. But then again, if the Lips only stuck to what's essential, they'd have a much cheaper stage show and a much less giddy fanbase. Anyone who wants to keep the Yoshimi party rolling will enjoy it. And as a bonus, there's a multimedia portion with the (kind of dull, I'm afraid) ""Fight Test"" video, and a five-minute trailer for the band's long-awaited Christmas on Mars film. Will the film couple its silliness with the rigor of their best work, or will it, like this disc, turn out to be a fans-only vanity project? To compare them once again to their peers, at least their flick'll be a hell of a lot more fun than Radiohead's or Wilco's. Bring on the alien Santa Claus autopsy!","When all is said and done, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots was a great record, especially for an album that ...

Let's Get Serious EP,PANTHERS,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb535e6ef95969322bb3/1:1/w_160/2297d1eb.jpg,2003-04-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6150-lets-get-serious-ep/,Dim Mak,"In 1984's The Friday Book, writer John Barth offers a salvo about epigraphs, calling the bits of quoted material ""hokey... one more bit of window-dressing before we get to the goods."" I disagree. But then, I've always tended towards indulgence, and I like it when authors (or bands or artists) layer a bunch of other people's words atop their own text, offering various paths to their own creation. Thankfully, the Panthers are similarly unafraid of affixing disparate textual voices to their work. No matter which member you tap, the Brooklyn-based band has all sorts of rock pedigree: Justin Chearno was in Turing Machine and Pitchblende (and he did some stuff with Unrest, too) and Kip Uhlhorn was a member of The Red Scare. But if you asked me to choose which parent the band resembles most, I'd have to point at vocalist Jayson Green, guitarist Geoff Garlock, and drummer Jeff Salene, all ex-members of Orchid, a band that carried (and tossed) the flames of Guy Debord and Born Against into the late 1990s. Sure, some people found Orchid heavy-handed. Why not? They quoted lengthily from Albert Camus and Jacques Attali. They peppered song titles with references to intellectual movements (""Snow Delay at the Frankfurt School""), applied theories to the lives of angry, good-humored punk-rock kids (""Let's Commodify Sexuality"", ""Discourse of Desire""), and the lyrics themselves were engagingly over-the-top: ""I kiss the girls that speak Marcuse/ I kiss the boys that speak Foucault"" (""Tigers""). As inspired and fun as I found Green's rants, the thing about Orchid that really allowed them to transcend the label of unsmiling crusty anarchists were their love/sex songs, their humor, and their desire to get folks dancing. And this is where the Panthers pick up the ball and start jogging on Let's Get Serious. Yeah, they jog. Perhaps taking their name from John Sinclair's White Panther movement, or maybe the Black Panthers, or even the pink bastard himself, the Panthers still toss around epigraphs by French theorists, gangster rappers, and Situationist poets galore; and Green is still on about sexism, fascism, fucking, and being a dick; but the lyrics (and overall political approach) seem less confrontational. It's like the emotive angst of the early years has given way to a bit too much rhetoric. More sinuous and less angry than last year's Are You Down?, the new songs manage to move beyond the pit and onto the dancefloor, yet, through the tepid lyrical flow, it sometimes seems like the revolution itself has become a nervous wallflower. ""Thank Me with Your Hands"", the first and strongest track here, is David Yow in a romantic mood. Somehow it also cops a slight feel from George Michael's ""Monkey"" (trust me on this). It's a warped, multi-layered MC5 shouting spree with some nice shit about slang and sleeping: ""I was thinking we should sleep in separate beds, but the heat's gone to my head/ Let's get tired at the same time (tonight)."" More blues than Orchid ever mustered, it's the Laughing Hyenas or some Am Rep band from back in the day; each guitar line's a trampoline, lifting the song to higher levels until things explode into total rock-out ballistics. Equally rich, ""It's Not the Heat It's the Humility"" is noteworthy for a weird drum fill that sounds like a violent beatdown and the placement of Notorious B.I.G.'s ""I don't know what's more important: my ego or yours"" just above it. The vocal line and lyrics are a bit tired (some late-80s battle of theory and praxis, indeterminability, and death of the author), but the guitars, again, totally rock. There's also a change during the last minute that brings overdriven Moog and vibraphone to the fore: somewhere amid the sheet of noise there's baritone sax, trumpet, and tenor sax. Fuck Rye Coalition, son, this is what the excess of the 1970s should've led us towards! ""Post-Fascist Fantasies"", which again has fairly throwaway lyrics, offers (to draw further parallels with The Jesus Lizard) an angular guitar line straight from the book of Duane Denison and, as with the other tracks, plenty of percussion (feedback, hand claps, and shakers). On ""Sexist Not Sexy"" the guitar tracks are upfront, kicking things through the wall and floor-- plus, there's pretty noise at the end: twisting buzzes stop and start, panning in the left speaker, and then tear the sheetrock into powder. Meanwhile, the final track, ""Don't Be a Dick"", offers this: ""My trousers have a nice pleat/ And I enjoy my method of self-defeat/ It suits me..."" The record needs more personalized flourishes like that. All in all, Let's Get Serious is grimy, fuzzed-out goodness, and while the aural trumps the textual time and again (I found myself caring less what the songs were about, and for a band like this that's a crucial slip), it's notable that the Panthers can coast by on rock alone: this is, after all, a mighty rad rock record. Still, they have the depth of thought to take it further than this. Maybe next time, if they amp the political angst as loudly as the guitars, the revolution of the everyday will finally have its proper soundtrack.

More G.D.M.,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f55e6ef959693210cf/1:1/w_160/1ee5d2f3.gif,2003-04-30 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2008-more-gdm/,Tigersushi,"You're sick of it, I'm sick of it, but ignore it as you might, electroclash aix92t going back into that closet doubling as a fifth floor walk-up any time soon. It's on the floor to stay, neither muffling its cheap-sex grunts nor apologizing for its shitty haircuts, shredded thrift store shirts, $200 pants, spiked wristbands, and trucker caps. Funny thing is, with all the trawling for irrelevant and/or relished treasures, this little crossbred genre that's finally come home to roost has been giving dissidents reason to pull up some other lost music not made by coke-loving third rate models. In what may be the only outpost of French love for the US at the moment (and vice-versa), Tigersushi not only functions as a website that namechecks the lost downtown groups, delves into fringe Village figures, weird hip-hop, the funkiest of Krautrockers and all the latest remixers but as a label, mashes genres into a great, rubbery wad. Taking all that knowledge down to the stoops and out on their rooftops, they dropped some serious pidgin shit in 5 EPs, jumbling old and new together in an electro tongue that's both an exclamation and a groan: \x93More Goddamned Music?!\x94 Famous for her opening turn on Andrew Weatherall's Nine O'Clock Drop-- one of the first comps to poke at the abandoned bum of ""left-field disco""-- eurotrash warbler Gina X is in the lead-off slot again, taking a detached drum kick and Vicki the Robot vocals to offer up tribute to an English gentleman, with an attitude that resonates twenty years on, snotty and clear. The Bush Tetras' detuned tom thud of \x93Things That Go Boom in the Night\x94 gets further reduced by Alice Machine into reverberating finger snaps, loin-quivering low tones, and coy femme coos about being on the night-prowl. It wouldx92t be French without some of their own bizarre contributions to the world of trashy fashion recordings tacked on, no matter how plastic. Going as far back as 1978 to document a bastard child of Gainsbourg's \x93Requiem Por Un Cox94 clopping on Superfly's lost roto-toms, a froggy Max Berlin gulps through ripples of melodica and synth wave into some illegitimate disco for \x93Elle et Moi\x94 that is quelle bizarre. Even in the shallow end of Ya-Ya girl babble in \x93Swinging Pool\x94, an homage to the Club Palace, it feels relatively deep today. Old and new get confused, which is easier to preach than practice. The alien-abducted graffito of Chapter Three (which convenes somewhere between Sun Ra, Special Request, and Sugarhill Gang) brings the fresh-dork fusion of \x93Smurf Trek\x94, while Jamalski, beamed from the dying planet of BDP, gets to toast on top of \x93Extraterrestrial Manoeuvers in the Dark\x94, and it's as if time has slipped together. Acts like Metro Area retain their rain-slicked cool clacks and snapping clomps for \x93We Also Not\x94, even standing next to mid-nineties Detroit producer Terrence Parker, while relative newcomer Maurice Fulton leaves Stevie Wonder's floaties in Tri Repetae's pool. Least interesting is Silver Apples' one-trick pony, an oscillator perfect-pitched onto a banjo in the desktop recycle bin. Simeox92s track makes him out as a Charlie Kaufman-type, cantankerously babbling to his girlfriend about salad for four minutes. On the other hand, Tigersushi does present the first swatch of Bill Laswell's Material that doesx92t make me nauseous-- in fact this hot shit track has me rethinking my whole take on the man. That they glean Cluster's creamy \x93Hollywood\x94 for the finale-- so epic in its electro splendor-- auguring G-ride frequencies on a \x93Flight of the Valkyries\x94 type of trip is leaving the goddamned best for last.","You\x92re sick of it, I\x92m sick of it, but ignore it as you might, electroclash ain\x92t going ...

C'mon Let's Pretend,Sahara Hotnights,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a336c0084474cd0c0209/1:1/w_160/77653673.jpg,2003-04-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6968-cmon-lets-pretend/,BMGBMG,"Elizabeth Daily. That's the name of the Valley Girl actress who later became the singer in the band that played various film proms: Better Off Dead, Summer School, some other shit. She did that 80s dance where her bobbing head, cocked arm, snapping hand, and suede-booted leg all moved in the same direction at the same time. She had Jersey mall hair. She was cool. Most of all, she had the most underrated film voice in history, a scratchy, scrappy, sandpapery bark. Elizabeth Daily's brilliantly craggy chirp-- the one that sang the line, ""I'd be better off dead/ Than to live without you!"" so passionately-- is now relegated to low-rent anime on American television and the occasional Nickelodeon film. God is fucking dead, people. Maria Andersson, she's the lead singer in Sahara Hotnights, the Swedish four-girl garage rock band for whom America freaked its shit after the stateside release of their second full-length album, Jennie Bomb. Snarling, cool-smart-and-driving-'82-Monte-Carlo-real-fast kinda stuff peeled out of that record with a U-Haul of suave and sass: The Runaways, but better prepared. It reeked like cigarettes. Even with the vague stench of Def Leppard, Foreigner and Survivor's leather/pyro tunes, that record's focus was its masterful sneering riffage. It made chix visualize throwing punches as an assertion of their all-encompassing tuffness. Some of us, in fact, did so. Sahara Hotnights' ""Alright Alright (Here's My Fist Where's the Fight?)"", from Jennie Bomb, made it onto soundtracks, but it's on their newly reissued first proper record, C'mon Let's Pretend, that Andersson sounds like the totally badassical Scandinavian incarnation of Elizabeth Daily. Shittier production quality, less anthemic assertion, and possibly the presence of weird guitar pedals (""Push on Some More"" is dressed with a sorta gothic flanger) allow Ms. Andersson's vox to have a singular presence that got lost in Jennie Bomb's foggy urgency. That presence is craggy, vibrato-laden, overly dramatic, and has ingested more stray droplets of Aquanet than Lita Ford in the years '87-'88: i.e., Elizabeth Daily. The only thing missing is the dance, which Andersson eschews in favor of muscle-y precision fretwork. Whatever; this time it'll have to do. But it's almost an entirely different band, this C'mon Let's Pretend-era Sahara Hotnights-- and in certain ways, it's a more original one. Unique embellishments extend beyond flange, in the form of breathless teenaged harmonies (""Too Cold for You""), grittier, more depressive songwriting (the surfy swagger of ""Drive Dead Slow"", ""Impressed by Me""), and forlorn, Axl-invoking ballads (""Our Very Own"", ""I Know Exactly What to Do"")-- less worldly, with a wider stylistic range. They weren't locked in to being a Garage Rock Band at that point, which resulted in a raw selection of arena weepers on par with Poison's ""Something to Believe In"", Lita & Ozzy's ""Close My Eyes Forever"" and Def Leppard's ""Photograph"". In 1999, Sahara Hotnights were well on their way to being the featured band at the stoner prom. I like that melodic innocence better than their current Pelle-tainted rocker persona. C'mon was written before they left their tiny Swedish hometown, so it has the unfiltered angst and itchy friction of four chicks who just wanted to get the eff out. It was written before they got all cynical from American tours, critical bonerz, and too many dudes disclaiming their guitar heroics with ""and they're hot, too."" It's the sound of innocence, like night-long basement parties spent listening to cheesy 80s rock records: derivative in a naïve tributary fashion, while still glimmering with songwriting promise. You won't wanna throw a punch, but you can visualize the possibility.","Elizabeth Daily. That's the name of the Valley Girl actress who later became the singer in the band that ...

Mad Dogs and San Franciscans,MushroomGary Floyd,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41ec0084474cd0c3605/1:1/w_160/1c3e3577.jpg,2003-04-29 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5520-mad-dogs-and-san-franciscans/,Black Beauty,"I'm slumped over at the Beauty Bar, my head ducking the plastic hair dryer dome as beehive designs surround me, when this voice starts coarsely bunting up against my skull. There are wicked edges to each syllable, but there's a viscous soul to it that seeps in where the barbs have already drawn blood. Which is peculiar, as the song itself is a nasty, bashing sort of punk number, the lyrics asking, \x93Are you stupid, or just a faggot?\x94 It's the Dicks, of course, one of the most powerful Texas punk bands ever to arise, at the same time as the Big Boys and the Butthole Surfers, before singer Gary Floyd-- the gargantuan punk-rock queen from which this powerful voice emanated-- pulled up stakes to the more accepting climes in San Francisco. With the less chain- gang Sister Double Happiness, he preceded the grunge genre by a few years, keeping a soulful edge to their sludgy rock. A touchstone for the likes of Nirvana, the Jesus Lizard, and Mudhoney (the last two covering Dicks' songs), Floyd has lain low the past few years, as punk cred don't exactly pay Pacific Gas. That he's paired now with Mushroom, a bunch of left Coast groovers and movers, is less a respectful resurrection than an inspired match. Comprised of players who've dabbled with folks such as Beth Orton, Beck, Faust, and Kevin Ayers, they have always been capable of summoning speed-crisped 60s soul, 70s fusion synth stacks, and 90s Tortoise wax buffing all the crags to a sheen, but with Floyd, they fill in that missing decade of the 80s, with his hardcore heart. Happy enough to contemplate their omphalos while zoning out to Herbie Hancock's Headhunters or Daevid Allex92s Gong, Mushroom veers more towards early seventies AM Gold with such a formidable front man, while still trudging up the old Fillmore West in all its incestuous glory and excess. Divining Joe Cocker, Floyd gives you just enough time to hit the black lights and crash into the bean bag before Mushroom takes off with the cringingly titled \x93The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, but It Will Be Auctioned Off on eBay\x94. That it works better than it reads by lava lamp is crucial, for they do take their sweet-ass time reaching expansion, wading through flute and trumpet morass before revealing their secret weapon: Monoshock and Glands of External Secretion tweaker Doug Pearson. Pearsox92s synthesizer is the x-factor for most of the tracks, extracting the psychoactive purities that lace their originals and covers, coating it all in electric Kool-Aid meltdown. On Curtis Mayfield's \x93Pushermax94 he is both street-level truck brakes and uncut space dust, squirting tracers around Floyd's falsetto and leather take on the gay hustler, concerned more with his own tricks than on ruining the ghetto. That the signature conga line drops into a lock at the end with the Can patter of Patrick O'Hearn Thomas (also doubling as producer of the sessions) gives their cover a much more potent effect. \x93Even the Beatles Had Beards\x94, the other Mushroom original, decelerates into a Traffic jam, with harmonica and organ cutting through with the Doppler effect of late-night ambulances, smoothing away all memories of a front man, but when Floyd belts back at the ARP blats of the Who b-side \x93Water\x94, his presence pulls the proceedings back from the tarpit of noodling these chops always teeter over, saving the group from falling in with the other dinosaurs. That Carrie Nation nymphets could be reborn to shimmy for the likes of the Spencer Davis Group, Steppenwolf, Leon Russell and Randy California is less about the Mushroom's session-cat ability to cough up long-haired balls of past glories than the dollar bin detritus coursing through Floyd's rough, corrugated throat, scuffing it up just enough to take hold on the way down.",,7.0,
R.I.P.,Murder City Devils,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e7c0084474cd0bff13/1:1/w_160/725fdfbe.jpg,2003-04-29 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5508-rip/,Sub Pop,"It's quite possible that the Murder City Devils' farewell show on October 31, 2001 was a good time, and that concert goers filed out of Seattle's Showbox Theater sweaty, confounded, and wholly satisfied, eyes glazed and shoes untied. But the actual, fleshy experience is entirely irrelevant to its recorded counterpart: as a live release, the Murder City Devils' posthumous and aptly titled R.I.P. is a tiring, sloppy failure. In some ways, that's the point-- by 2001, the Devils had made a career out of ballsy metal-punk garage posturing, and their final performance maintains that spirit to an absurd degree-- but it's not enough make R.I.P. worth its weight in fake blood and chicken bones. On 2001's Thelema, the Devils stopped smashing beer bottles long enough to give fans a quick glimpse of their songwriting potential, featuring some decent melodies and a lot more attention to instrumentation-- and structure-- than their previous albums. But shortly after its release, the band disintegrated mid-tour: keyboardist Leslie Hardy and bassist Derek Fudesco abruptly fled the group, and the remaining members (Nate Manny, Dan Gallucci, Coady Willis, Nick DeWitt, Moody, and Gabe-the-Roadie) agreed to dissipate forever following a final hometown gig. Unfortunately, what could have been the ultimate swansong for a band seventy minutes away from self-destruction plays more like a half-hearted, obligatory spurt from a tired, lifeless, group bored with their own gimmicky sludge. As a collection of songs, R.I.P. is completely (and self- consciously) incoherent. It's also a physically distressing, head- twitching experience, opening with vocalist Spencer Moody slurring ""I hope we don't disappoint!"" before thirty drawn-out seconds of flat, monotonous electric guitar wail, followed by a viscous, gooey glop of power chords and banging drumbeats. This is the instantly forgettable ""Bear Away"". Pretty Girls Make Graves frontwoman Andrea Zollo (DeWitt and Fudesco are now card-carrying members of PGMG) lends some shockingly expert vocals to ""Boom Swagger"", although it seems safe to assume she-- like everyone else-- was properly trashed (think of the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Karen O. not even trying to keep the Corona in her mouth while howling onstage); ""Boom Swagger"" is the highlight of R.I.P., thick with palpable sexual energy, muscular (if boring) guitar thrashing, and creepy (if belabored) organ lines. MCD chose to close their set (and their collective career) with a new song, ""Grace That Saves"", although there's nothing especially different about its dark, heavy guitars, throaty, unmelodic screams, and aggressive percussion. Wait, scratch that-- there's totally extra screaming on this one! Man that's loud! Whether the Murder City Devils actually disappointed their fans that night is impossible to determine now. They had always been a band that aspired to a very specific kind of musical mediocrity-- more pomp, gore, and black leather than ingenuousness-- and even the album's liner notes admit ""Good musicianship never goes out of style. Well, we had one shot, and we blew it."" Still, any clear-headed Ramones fan knows that ""good musicianship"" isn't necessarily the cornerstone of a fine rock band; what the Ramones lacked in chops they more than made up for with heart, inventiveness, and character. The Murder City Devils don't display any such stuff here, and that, at least, will be enormously disappointing to anyone who shells out $12 for their send-off CD. As with almost anything certifiably worthless, a perverse beauty emerges from the midst of crap: this record is so brazenly bad that it's almost-- almost-- good, mostly because of the obviousness of its faults: out of tune guitars, broken and/or exploding microphones, shit-faced band and audience members tackling each another, drum sets toppling, spotty sound, peripheral noise, indecipherable vocals, and plenty of beer-fueled pontificating. R.I.P. has a kind of entirely credible kiss-my-ass swagger that, while you're tossing the disc in the trash, will perhaps allow for a tiny, fleeting ""Those wily little fuckers!"" grin. After that, you will never, ever think about the Murder City Devils again. MDC: R.I.P.","It's quite possible that the Murder City Devils' farewell show on October 31, 2001 was a good time, and ...

Where Shall You Take Me,Damien Jurado,by: Daniel Crumb,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba43ea9e61561daa71ae/1:1/w_160/b96edc2e.jpg,2003-04-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4323-where-shall-you-take-me/,Secretly Canadian,"For the most part-- damn near the whole part-- Damien Jurado went for the straightforward earnest lo-fi acoustic ballad ""thing"". Far from the rocking follow-up to his chair-breaking 2002 release, Where Shall You Take Me is as distant as Jurado can travel without ending up in the same place (the token rocker, \x93Texas to Ohio\x94, is like Alejandro Escovedo's most annoying moment, but not quite as well executed). The sparse and largely unobtrusive music, and Jurado's wanting vocal range place the emphasis on storytelling, one his strongest assets. The results, however, are a mixed bag. He begins by trying to shock us to attention. The snappy first line trick would have to be pretty damn snappy to top Crooked Fingers' \x93Blurry eyes/ Half-bent/ And I can't take you sober,\x94 but \x93First came a scream/ Blood on the floor/ The alcohol and magazines\x94 gives the trick a fairly decent whack. You have to love the old standby, a porn/murder ballad. Despite how it outlines Jurado's stunning ability to stack moving images into a pliable story (\x93Smile for the camera/ Take off that dress/ $20 for a kiss\x94), Jurado overreaches on \x93Amateur Night\x94. The quasi-cinematic monotone crescendo that begins midway through never pans out: the story isn't \x93real\x94 enough to be genuinely disturbing, and a half-assed attempt at trying to humanize the protagonist (\x93I am not an evil man/ I just have a habit I can't kick\x94) derails anything he was building up to. Jurado's stacking technique works best with image collages; his similar portrayal of actions make the story a series of connecting lines without reference dots, rather than dots without connecting lines. The latter invigorates the imagination. The former is simply frustrating. Two distinct threads unify the album: the aforementioned \x93creepy\x94 motif, and an at once endearing and annoying faux-naïve peasant idyllic, both of which yield varying degrees of success. \x93Omaha\x94, for example, presents a desert wasteland, sparely peppered with half-dying saguaro mope-core acoustics yearning for a late monsoon. \x93Tether,\x94 on the other hand, undercuts its pleasant naivety with the proper use of \x93whom\x94. ""Abiline\x94 is a lovely little lullaby and the most adult contemporary song on what's in many ways an adult contemporary album (a characterization due mainly to piano work that invokes Bruce Hornsby). \x93Window\x94 is stark naked Americana, and proves to be the most effective invocation of his idyllic mode, in the same way as senior alt-contempo master Ryan Adams' \x93In My Time of Need\x94-- in fact it's pretty much the same damn song. \x93I Can't Get Over You\x94 works as a sequel to \x93Window\x94, but that's about it; featuring the album's most predictable guitar work and lyrics like \x93I've tried sleeping/ Just to get over you/ I have tried dreaming/ But all of my thoughts were of you/ Oooooh whooooo,\x94 he fails in the same vein he succeeded on the previous track. \x93Intoxicated Hands\x94 is the album's highlight, despite some annoying vocal processing, and provides the ass to cash the check of \x93Amateur Night\x94. A whirlwind of phantasmagoric vocal layering, flashes of lust and jealousy, and snippets of frantic, obsessive mania slap the listener from every direction: it is all the atmosphere and confusion of Amore de Tropico compressed into one song. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I desperately want to; like some disembodied spirit floating through different bodies, adopting their perspective momentarily and then moving on, Jurado's shifts through first, second and third persons reveal a stark betrayal, if little else. Where Shall You Take Me? may be one of the most aptly titled albums in recent memory, but Jurado does lead us on a worthwhile journey. With the exception of ""Matinee"", most of filler is forgivable, and the music, while not innovative, is lovely. His storytelling has a ways to go before I'll follow along with baited breath, but his ambitious songwriting-- while not brilliant-- places him well above your average troubadour.","For the most part-- damn near the whole part-- Damien Jurado went for the straightforward earnest lo-fi acoustic ballad ""thing ...

Airs of the Ear,Richard Youngs,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aade5e6ef95969321669/1:1/w_160/b0583017.jpg,2003-04-28 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8841-airs-of-the-ear/,Jagjaguwar,"Somewhere in the middle of pagan nature worship and an acid trip lies the music of Scottish experimental folk musician Richard Youngs. Be it an acoustic love paean, minimalist drone or feedback-ridden electronic sound collage, Youngs' domain is of florescent mayflies, vast fields of green grass and an uncanny ability to spike his gentle, seemingly simple tunes with psychedelic grandeur. And despite his talents as a cultivator of spaced sounds and vintage flange, his songs never seem like mere excuses for blasting off into the cosmic abyss; in fact, I'd go so far as to say that when he's singing, his music is generally straight ahead British folk, along the lines of old Sandy Denny or possibly Comus' lighter moments. Furthermore-- unlike virtually everyone outside of Jeff Mangum-- he's able to keep his far-outness from overwhelming the tunes. In a world where Makoto Kawabata threatens to release a new record every month, that means a lot. Airs of the Ear is Youngs' fourth record on Jagjaguwar, and is often reminiscent of his 1998 high point, House Music, on which troubadour melodies and eccentric takes on psychedelia and musique concrete were exposed as better bedfellows than you might think. The songs are generally long, but rarely seem like workouts; when Youngs rides a phrase, he tends to opt for trance-like repetition instead of aimless noodling or extended forays into sound-effect hell (hey, it worked for Ash Ra). There are moments when retro sci-fi terror via who-knows-what arrays of ring-modulated synth might lure you off track, but it's nothing a healthy flashback couldx92t render merely charming. As a whole, this is a pretty earthbound record for being so superficially spacey. \x93Fire Horse Rising\x94 gathers a head of steam in five relatively short minutes. Typically, it begins with a delicate, fingerpicked guitar line accompanied by various homemade effects (provided by, among other things, some kind of hyped-up theremin). Youngs' minimal lyrics, similar to past efforts, serve not so much to narrate a story as to help along the reedy melody (though \x93I dox92t understand, I dox92t want to know\x94 is right in line with his relation to current trends in music). Soon enough, the fuzz bass comes in, guitars are dubbed and overdubbed, and various screaming electro-tones wail in the distance. The effect is similar to Angels of Light's symphonic folk steamroller, though where that band might barrel down on the song, Youngs is content to drift, though with considerable momentum. That he's able to muster this kind of power as a one-man show is all the more impressive. \x93Halifax Amore\x94 reminds me of last year's May, though the discordant square-wave interjections do their best to punt this as far away from that record's entirely acoustic atmosphere as possible. However, like May's music, \x93Halifax Amore\x94 takes two lines of verse and understated guitar to deliver a barely-there hybrid of folk and minimalism. Youngs' vocal harmonies add a mournful tinge to the song, but where trance ceases to emphasize pulse, there's always a chance you might miss a few bars if you're not totally zoned in on what's happening. \x93Machaut's Dream\x94 uses similar tactics, though the good old theremin supplies some much needed soft counterpoint to the thin melody. Youngs' guitar playing, as always, provides a skeletal framework for the rest of his tiny motifs to work in and around, but again, if you arex92t up to the task/joy of an epic stroll down minstrel lane, the details might get lost in the shuffle. The maddening thing about Airs of the Ear is that no matter how many times I think I've lost track of the previous 20 minutes or so, all the melodies stay with me. Singing along to this stuff is almost second nature, which I guess means Youngs' songs really are able to survive the half dozen effects applied to each verse. Far be it from me to condemn anyone for running with a groove, especially when way-out-there sounds are involved-- if you're on the same wavelength, there's plenty to hear inside the mix, and hum along while you do.","Somewhere in the middle of pagan nature worship and an acid trip lies the music of Scottish experimental folk musician ...

Fever to Tell,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab0f9d034d5c69bf3f5c/1:1/w_160/37a18b0f.jpg,2003-04-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8888-fever-to-tell/,Interscope,"Can a band build an entire career, a legacy even, on a handful of EPs and a boundless torrent of press? How many party dresses need to take a beer bath before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs drop the rock icon pastiche and just play some music? Over and over again, they've been accused of empty posturing, wallowing in scrofulous, self-conscious ""irony,"" disguising themselves Predator-style as the public conception of who they were supposed to be rather than who they actually are. And yet (dramatic pause), until the stylists and spin-mongers start writing the music, why does this still have to matter? The band plays the blistering, bassless hand they're dealt, plus or minus the cards up their designer sleeves, and make the ""right moves."" More power to them; hype, famously, is a bitch, a shrew, and in the end, it's still theirs to try and tame. No one wants to be the ill-fated morning-after tat on the ass-end of the garage-rock revival, after all. The really stupid part of all this, though, is that the shitstorm of publicity that's been hanging overhead the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is based on all of, what, eight songs? Two EP/singles? Robert Pollard throws away eight songs before breakfast and you sure as hell don't see him on the cover of NME. Well, hold yr breath, kids. The YYY's have finally released the plot element that their garage-to-riches Cinderella II story has most sorely lacked: The Full-Length Album. This is gonna make 'em rockstars, everybody! The final story arc-- and how's this for irony-- will conclude with them shedding their personas here, showing everyone that they've got what it takes to endure, and living happily ever after as the saviors of rock 'n' rollllll... Except, they don't do any of that. Or maybe (and this is only an hypothesis) they were never all that guilty of the heinous crimes of Fashion they've been charged with in the first place? Either way, here it is, Fever to Tell, and they just play the same guitar/drums rock they have since the beginning-- what'd you expect? Sure, you can practically feel Karen O looking over her shoulder for approval with every faux-erotic squeal or disdainful shout, and a number of these tracks fall flat entirely because of the knowing, brutal swagger they try so damn hard to affect. And when it's all over, the slow-burning, gently chaotic dissolve of ""No No No"" (even the title is self-conscious) or the bluesy strut of ""Black Tongue"" will wither under anything more than passing scrutiny, but more will remain. Reason is, first and foremost, the near-faultless musical support at the core of the YYY's: Nick Zinner and Brian Chase. If you can hear (or even care to try to hear, which you shouldn't) an ounce of ""posture"" in Zinner's thunderous guitar licks or Chase's relentless percussive assault, then you're a more cynical man (or woman) than I. The rhythms are never very complicated, but when it counts, Chase pounds away with enough precise desperation to project an unfailing sense of urgency; it carries through even the more emotional tracks, lending the rare vulnerability a tragic sort of transience. Between the vicious buzz and slender trill of Zinner's strings is a breathtaking range-- the robotically looped harmonics of ""Rich"" coupled with the layered crunch of the wall-of-sound that collapses on top of them; the stop/start emergency-room shriek of ""Date With a Night"". Even Karen O seems stunned by the anthemic scope of the blazing, surf-like guitar and Chase's deafening percussion on ""Y Control""; she turns in one of her most subdued vocals, as if it's all she can do just to keep up. Not coincidentally, it's also one of her most impressive turns. That's not O's only compelling performance, though-- there are a couple moments when she drops her lacquered sneers and teases, and when this happens, it suddenly becomes very difficult to avoid seeing the music in a different light. Of course, her success varies. At times, she's the linchpin of the band-- and not just because her gratuitous sexual tension has become their trademark-- while at others she's the weakest link. The problem here is that, while the guys are definitely on here, they're still nowhere near groundbreaking, and as a result, they rise and fall depending largely on Karen's delivery. Her play-acting is what got the Yeah Yeah Yeahs slapped with the charges of shallow insincerity in the first place. It shouldn't matter if it's a façade, but it does; knowing beforehand what you're dealing with or not, it becomes very trying to accept every sleazy squeak as part of her routine. If the band ever wants to really dump these lingering doubts for good, they'll need to overcome this obstacle. Still, for proof that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, at their core, make a better band than they do runway trendsetters, one need look no further than Fever to Tell's singular true moment of clarity-- a tune of such moving grace I can scarcely believe they're responsible for it-- ""Maps"". Though the song is sadly in a class by itself on this record (it would take about two seconds to call roll for the tunes that even come close), absolutely everything falls into place here. The drums are gentle enough to simply caress the tune, but still pressing enough to make it clear that this second of happiness is fleeting, and Zinner's guitar work is easily his best to date, equal parts joy and discord. But it's Karen's vocals that steal the show; for once, they fairly drip genuine, regretful emotion: When she sings, ""Lay off/ Don't stray/ My kind is your kind/ I'll stay the same.../ They don't love you like I love you,"" almost on the verge of defeated tears, the emotive response it produces is very real, and that means a lot.","Can a band build an entire career, a legacy even, on a handful of EPs and a boundless torrent of ...

Re:Release: Clear Blue Skies,Juggaknots,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba349d034d5c69bf53eb/1:1/w_160/fd845469.gif,2003-04-28 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4310-rerelease-clear-blue-skies/,Fondle 'Em,"Don't up your bids yet, web shoppers-- your wallet can breathe a huge sigh of relief. At last, the sounds of Clear Blue Skies can again grace the ears of the common man, an album only A-Rod or B-Gates could have picked up recently. The availability of the Juggaknots' one vinyl-only full-length had been relegated to the Net over the past few years, fetching upwards of sixty dollars each time it was posted on eBay. Rumors of another pressing floated for some time-- in large part because the only other Fondle 'Em LP of the era (Kool Keith and Godfather Dox92s The Cenobites) got another go-'round in 2000-- but this year Clear Blue Skies is finally getting the King Ralph Royal Meal Deal expanded treatment, available for the first time on either CD or double vinyl, with eleven bonus tracks, in a store near you. Up until this point, Breezly Brewin and Buddy Slim havex92t exactly been household names, but the Bronx duo has risen to cult status through some exceptional guest appearances. Many may remember the Brewix92s contribution to \x93Fire in Which You Burx94, on Company Flow's Funcrusher Plus. If you have a reasonable excuse for missing his opening verse (though, you dox92t), perhaps he's more recognizable as the lead role of Tariq in Prince Paul's cinemaudio opus A Prince Among Thieves. With an added third member (Queen Heroine), the Juggaknots also helped fill in the RZA-esque bleeps and Pterodactyl-screams of Mr. Lex92s \x93This Morning\x94, the standout track on the Matador-released Pity the Fool. If all of this slipped under your late 90s rap-o-meter, hopefully last year's terrific comeback 12\x94 \x93WKRP in NYC\x94 jogs your memory. I'd high-five you if these releases were all a part of your music library, but in case they arex92t, consider Re: Release your salvation. All nine tracks from the original album are collected here, albeit in incorrect order. Call it nitpicking, but the sequencing of this LP is essential: from \x93The Hunt is Ox94 to \x93I'm Gonna Kill You\x94, each song pounded into the next, creating a thick swamp of street wisdom and relentless battle raps. Breaking up the flow with bonus tracks (read: session outtakes) that rarely last two full minutes was a mistake. Still, the masterwork remains. \x93Trouble Max94 is the proper Clear Blue Skies kickoff, with a distantly fading piano and a bassline that seemingly jumps the gun before the start of each measure. Buddy Slim, vocally reminiscent of Parrish Smith, clobbers the track. Complete with sampled explosions (dox92t front) Slim gets to work: \x93You become a sittix92 duck, but fuck it I aix92t givix92 in/ I'm livix92 trifle, the pen and pad becomes a 12-gauge rifle.\x94 This is pure, unadulterated, urban angst, twisted through the mind of a grizzled war veteran. Easily the album's highlight, the title track is curiously found as an unlisted bonus cut. This song should not go unnoticed, and the following statement is not made lightly: \x93Clear Blue Skies\x94 is one of the greatest hip-hop songs of the past decade. Breezly Brewin, through some knob tweaking, portrays both a white father and his son, quarreling over the sox92s interracial relationship. Superbly articulate and critical, the Brewin tastefully deals with race in a domestic context that is rarely explored so patiently in hip-hop. This song alone is justification for any eBay price inflation. Aside from the aforementioned sequencing problems, it's impossible to complain for the simplest of reasons: this superb, out of print record is back, and widely available. The bonus tracks are a nice touch in and of themselves, and have some worth considering the limited output of anything wholly Juggaknots, period. The group shouldx92t have to worry about wallowing in obscurity anymore, as a new batch of fans can discover a Fondle 'Em gem without breaking the bank. Sit back, program tracks 1, 2, 3, 11, 5, 9, 7, 20, and 16 into your player, and revel in the Clear Blue Skies.","Don't up your bids yet, web shoppers-- your wallet can breathe a huge sigh of relief.

Telegraphs In Negative / Mouths Trapped In Static,Set Fire to Flames,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a308c0084474cd0c01ac/1:1/w_160/c2bb1211.gif,2003-04-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11823-telegraphs-in-negative-mouths-trapped-in-static/,Alien8,"Amidst analog-derived hiss and static, Set Fire to Flames make clear the motivating theme behind their latest release, the double-disc Telegraphs In Negative / Mouths Trapped In Static, only moments prior to its finale: ""...we're the luckiest people in the world because stop this is just gonna stop make us stronger and stronger as stop it goes on and on..."" The true meaning behind this desultory phrase-- sampled from either a discussion between a jailed man and his estranged wife, or excerpted from the most insecure brothel relationship ever-- may never be known to anyone outside the band, but it carries transparent connotations regarding the recording process that's eagerly flaunted on both this release and the band's previous: their records were made in ""self-imposed isolation, with the band operating in states of little or no sleep, varying levels of intoxication, and in physical confinement."" Aligning themselves with various other shut-in luminaries such as Amon Düül and Faust, the band undoubtedly view the euphoric and analgesic power of narcotics and somnambulism as a one-way ticket to the underground, an idea closely tied to the Cage-ian fueled notion of aleatoric music. From this tradition, Set Fire to Flames emphasize their steadfast belief in the principle that music stems forth from the natural gamble of improvisational/inspirational jamming and the found-sound principles of musique concrète. One need only listen to their last album Sings Reign Rebuilder in its entirety to understand the basis for this belief, but unfortunately the adage of lightning rarely striking twice endures, as their latest effort is hardly as cohesive or stunning a composition. ""Déja, Comme des Trous de Vent, Comme Reproduit"" begins strongly enough, with the return to form suggested by the title. Intermingling a rolling guitar and a staccato bassline, a uniform hum swallows the song, building to a deafening crescendo before petering out with the words, ""Small steps against inertia... echo a dead end."" The song then proceeds at a protracted pace, which regrettably establishes the tempo for the majority of the first disc. Used as an amalgamated experimental device, the sounds of rustling and torn pages, keys rattling into a rusty ignition, and various other concrete noises can become a sonic accent that makes or breaks a song, but standing alone for such extended periods of time with little-to-no accompaniment sounds forced and musically without nuance. Even the slight return of Lyingdyingwonderbody, a recurring character from the first album, seems trite and misplaced as the disembodied voice expounds upon how he's forced to escape various deadly situations, before the track dissolves into another round of generic industrial noises and cavernous roars. Of course, there are still moments of brilliance scattered throughout the work, but they're inevitably crushed by the weight of the double album itself. The beautiful and dense ""When Sorrow Shoots Her Darts"" begins with a playful tune that's traded in counterpoint between the guitar and violin, as a strong percussive element builds before quickly fading into ""Kill Fatigue Frequencies"", which offers what sounds like a brief piece for the glass harmonica. ""Rites of Spring Reverb"" and ""Something About Eva Mattes in the Halo of Exploding Street Lamps..."" both offer a display of melodic songwriting, memorable and complex in their use of overlapping instrumentation and extended techniques. Throughout their innovations these tracks manage to avoid most elements of excess, which is unfortunately more than compensated for in such inexplicably long and underdeveloped tracks as ""In Prelight Isolate"" and ""Sleep Maps"". To the band's credit, these moments of musical gluttony are more a question of temperament than talent, whereby error lies in the misconstrued principles upon which the original project was founded. Though chance music and improvisation is a path toward the creation of music-- and a damned fine one at that-- it can't guarantee good music anymore than meditative contemplation by a classical composer can lead to Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Furthermore, to truly subscribe to the philosophy and use of field-recording as a work of art involves the commercial denial of the product insofar as nearly anyone can find an empty space where they can sit and simply listen to the environment around them, free of charge. Optimistically, this excursion merely represents a flirtation with imbalanced recording for a band, something the group had to flush out of their system prior to their next masterpiece, and not an enduring trend towards irrelevancy.","Amidst analog-derived hiss and static, Set Fire to Flames make clear the motivating theme behind their\n\ latest release, the ...

Danse Macabre Remixes,The Faint,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd20eb335119a49ecdeb/1:1/w_160/a55af0ed.jpg,2003-04-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2949-danse-macabre-remixes/,Astralwerks,"So The Faint have finally made it into the 90s. Let's toast; Smart Drinks are on me. Coming off like The Cure's own transition into the last decade, Mixed Up, tracks from The Faint's wildly popular 2001 record Danse Macabre get molded here into to the throbbing glowstick beats and gigantic bronze cojones of famous producers such as Junior Sanchez, Photek, and Paul ""Assembly Line"" Oakenfold. For the most part, each remix is based around the most identifiable facet of The Faint: the whiny, underdog-Simon-LeBon mewl of vocalist Todd Baechle. Conveniently, he's also the band's most annoying facet. (Oh, he's funny, and has the propensity to get naked at shows quicker than the strippers at the Blue Banana. I'm sure there's a lotta fuckin' urban disaffect gripping Omaha like a disease, but dudes! Blase 80s vox are the new emo howl: & I have grown weary of them.) However, even if your selective listening skills allow you to drown out Baechle's pukey purse-lipped coif, the actual remixes here-- with a few exceptions-- are mired in trahnce cliché, premeditated keyboard blasts, canny beats, and that ""UH UH UH"" pulsing low-end synth whir that blankets practically every cheap 90s house comp sold in the cut-out bin of yr local Fred Meyer's. It's all very inoffensive in its lightly perspiring drive, like hearing ""Pure Energy"" by the Information Society, ten times. Okay, maybe only eight times. Two tracks stand out: The Calculator's minimal version of ""Posed to Death"" neutralizes Baechle's authoritative pronunciations (wait... is this guy even British?!) with Leila Cusack's pretty vocals, all over a balloony glitch track that sounds straight from the new Prefuse 73 record. And with maybe a tiny sense of irony, Ursula 1000 turns ""Your Retro Career Melted"" into a funky, bass-driven disco track infused with cowbell and handclaps. Otherwise, each remix bleeds into the next with not-really-alarming anonymity. ""The Conductor"" is tackled by Madonna cohort Jacques Le Conti, aka the guy who remixed that critical Jack White blowjob, Electric Six's ""Danger! High Voltage!"" Paul Oakenfold does his intense, positive ""enter the matrix"" trance thing, and Tommie Sunshine mirrors that feel on ""Let the Poison Spill from Your Throat"", albeit with better beats and more subtleties. Photek gives ""Total Job"" an industrial makeover (complete with a chorus sung by an Apprentice of Satan) worthy of NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, before blending into Jagz Kooner's farting version of ""Agenda Suicide"". Mojolators, Junior Sanchez, even Medicine's operatic glitch... I think I got roofed and woke up in a desert rave. Is this record The Faint's attempt for legitimacy in the dance world? Is it an attempt to crossover into a larger audience, i.e. the vast amount of people who inexplicably relate to and purchase Oakenfold records? Is it an attempt by Astralwerks to regain that portion of the indie rock audience they lost after what seemed like a straight year of nothing but Bare Essentials comps? All that's cool w/me, but Dance Macabre Remixes doesn't even have the energy to scream ""JACK YO BODY"" like virtually every 90s house comp ever. Instead, its overarching mediocrity sends the message: ""This is preordained, socially acceptable dance music (possibly tailored for people who don't normally dance)."" And everyone knows that ""preordained"" and ""socially acceptable"" are the carpool lanes on the freeway to B O R I N G.","So The Faint have finally made it into the 90s.

Glam,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e213d197565213be21/1:1/w_160/12f0e647.jpg,2003-04-27 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5463-glam/,SonigSonig,"I heard Microstoria before I ever heard Mouse on Mars. A friend had somehow acquired the Thrill Jockey 12"" with Microlab's ""Endless Summer NAMM"" b/w Oval's ""Runtime Engine"" Microstoria megamix, which was surprising because he didn't much care for experimental electronic music. Having no context at that time for this sort of thing, I didn't know what to make of it. But after I heard some Mouse on Mars and gradually became drawn into that world, I went back and gave Microstoria another listen, and then began looking for Jan St. Werner's solo project Lithops. When I finally bought everything I could find under all three names, I began to see the music of Jan St. Werner as existing along a spectrum, with the tuneful music he made with Andi Toma as Mouse on Mars at one end, the free-floating manipulations of his Markus Popp collaboration Microstoria on the other, and his own work as Lithops in the middle. And that's how it went for St. Werner's output generally, but one album was fixed at the fulcrum between St. Werner's abstract and pop interests: Mouse on Mars' Glam. Glam's initial release was a vinyl-only limited edition, but now it's finally been reissued domestically on CD (there was a pricey Japanese import CD with the bonus tracks also included here). I listened to Glam constantly in '99 but hadn't put it on for a while now, so I was curious whether it was as great as I remembered. It is, for the most part. And it's particularly fun to hear now because it captures Mouse on Mars at such an interesting time. Though they've since distinguished themselves as a warped electronic pop group, Mouse on Mars were all over the place during the latter half of the 90s, working with everybody and experimenting like crazy. Atmospheric soundscaping was something they excelled at when so inclined, as evidenced by the abstract tracks they placed on compilations (most of which were collected on the equally fine Instrumentals album), and that's where their focus is through most of Glam. As a collection of pieces initially constructed as sound cues, Glam sometimes feels like an album packed with brilliant but unfinished ideas. Three great albums could be made if the music hinted at here were extended and developed. For example, it would please me if the feedback drones refracted through a fine mist of distortion on ""High Court Low Cut"" lasted for fifteen minutes instead of just over three, and I think it's safe to say that if an instrumental on the My Bloody Valentine album that never was sounded this pretty it would have been worth the wait. The snarling, crunchy breaks of ""Tiplet Metal Plate"" hint at a dark and funky industrial road not taken, with far more groove than the cartoony noise tracks Mouse on Mars would later construct. And a good portion of the album's first half is fine 70s-sounding ambient, something Eno would have been proud to put his stamp on during his prime. A couple tracks did find their way to other projects. ""Mood Leck Backlash"" is similar enough to Iaora Tahiti's ""Gocard"" to be considered an alternate version, and the unbelievably joyous sunburst pop instrumental ""Glim"", which closes this record, also finished out the Cache Coure Naif EP. Despite the patchwork nature of Glam, though, where not-quite-finished tracks in a number of different styles seem stitched together, it works as an album. Maybe I spent too many hours staring at the sleeve art (a good argument for keeping the vinyl), but the cover, a shot that might have been titled ""Hyenas on the Savannah at Dusk"", really captures the mood of Glam. It's a grainy video capture that diffuses the early evening light into finely textured particles, and the photograph is gripped with tension as it straddles boundaries between day and night, between the natural world and an electronic representation. Glam, absorbing influences from the vast musical world of all of Mouse on Mars, has a similar complexity. Oh yeah, then there's the story of how the album came to be. By now anyone remotely interested in Mouse on Mars knows that Glam was originally recorded as a soundtrack for an awful Australian film called starring Tony ""Who's the Boss?"" Danza but was rejected outright by the producers as being too experimental. I haven't seen the film, but I think the producers probably knew what they were doing. It's impossible to imagine Danza's face onscreen as this music plays in the background. Still, I love the idea that Mouse on Mars approached scoring a straight-to-video piece of shit as if they were Popol Vuh working with Werner Herzog. Instead of tossing something off, getting paid, and going home, they holed up in St. Martin in The Streets and recorded some of their best music. Glam is the sound of two believers. ","In 1998, Mouse on Mars issued music from a rejected film soundtrack that turned out to be one of their finest albums. Alternatively jagged and lush, it moves with ease from the most billowy ambience to jet-black industrial grind.

Brother Shepherd: First off, what's with this ""Robert Johnson"" song that begins your latest album? It appears to be just a smattering of our Messiah's lines held together by detuned, light-gauge strings and some barely sussed-out slide on top. I don't hear any twelve-bar blues here. Brother YZ: We're from the South, so even though we're just playing sloppy punk with a slide, we get to call it ""the blues."" By mewling out loud like I got a kidney stone and I'm fixin' to die, I am channeling the spirit of Johnson. I've even read Steven LaVere's transcriptions of Robert Johnson's songs, so I know what he says.

That ain't exactly becoming. Brother Token: Yeah, well, I got more blues in what I coughed up this morning than the last fifty years of you fucks combined. When's the last time any of you could do something as sonically destitute as the void of ""Weak Brain, Narrow Mind"" and make it sound as evil as the living dead clawing their way out of the Mississippi mud? It might as well be Willie Dixon's skeleton rattling the hemorrhoids of yer lily-white back doors. Brother Cooder: Well, since they wouldn't know Esu from Ruben Studdard, they sure can't boogie on R.L. Burnside's ""Goin' Down South"", slathering it instead with some red-eye gravy of punk clatter. Brother Cray: And when they turn up, they're about as tasty as Kentucky Fried Goat. You gotta let that goat cook up real slow, boys. But even though your plumb-dumb ineptitude and suburban caterwauling should mussy up the slower, faux-rhetorical titles like ""Truth Through Sound"", it's surprisingly non-odious and the best thing you do. Grand Wizard Richards: Agreed. You sure ain't the Gibson Brothers. You boys are much better at crawling than at galloping. Sullyin' up your own pot of beans is one thing, but to be plain messin' with the blues just won't cut it in these affluent circles.","Snippets of dialog from the 66th Annual Convention of the Robert Johnson Pasty-White Memorial Society at B.B.

More Like the Moon EP,Wilco,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa339d034d5c69bf3dcf/1:1/w_160/f4727347.gif,2003-04-27 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8678-more-like-the-moon-ep/,Wilcoworld.net,"Okay, show of hands: how many of you people have listened to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot recently? Yeah, that's about what I expected, 'cause you know, I haven't pulled it out much lately myself. That kind of bothers me. YHF did, after all, cling battered and bruised to the top spot on my list for the Palindromic Year, and one would expect it would have a better shelf-life, even though it's been wink-wink-available for nigh on two years. Now, before you start sharpening your Outlook, know that this is not an official Pitchfork backlash war cry, but a mere personal assessment. I was, you should know, the staff's staunchest defender of YHF's canonization, enduring countless hipster rants about its dad-rock/easy-listening nature and the impressionability of the nation's boomer crits. For a period of about nine months, anyone so unlucky as to be around me after three or four beers got to hear my pulpit speech about the horizon-widening effect that Jeff Tweedy & Co.'s masterwork could have on the general populace. Maybe it's because of this intense love affair that I don't reach for YHF so much anymore, in favor of albums that slipped through my fingers while I proselytized about the genius last two minutes of ""Reservations"". Surely, then, this miniature collectible e-EP-- originally released as a deal-sweetener for YHF-buyers down under, and now streaming and/or downloadable (if you're an honorable sort) from the Wilco website-- would rekindle some of the romance? Packaging two of the better YHF outtakes with four more recent songs, More Like the Moon is timed like a snack to tide us over while the band gallivants around the U.S. with Sonic Youth and R.E.M. instead of RECORDING A NEW ALBUM DAMMIT WHY WON'T YOU FINISH ITTTTTT! But for those of us pulling for Tweedy to keep the laptop plugged in, More Like the Moon will stream a bit hollow due to its focus on that old humdrum, outdated tool, the guitar. Two tracks-- the unfamiliar ""Woodgrain"" and solo-show mainstay ""Bob Dylan's 49th Beard""-- are little more than street-corner-strumming Tweedy, ""Kamera"" resurfaces in grungier form as ""Camera"", and the title track and ""Handshake Drugs"" feature extended soloing twixt the verses. Your enjoyment of those last two tracks will probably determine your final score, as they stretch out over more than half of the EP's twenty minutes and change. ""Handshake Drugs"" comes off the better of the pair, employing a reclined groove and muffled ""Only a Northern Song"" noise breaks. ""More Like the Moon"", on the other hand, is an extremely straightforward purty ballad, with extended near-Flamenco picking lending the track a Chi-Chi's-style ambience. Yeah, it's somewhat moving and hardly faultable, but the bar is set too high now for Wilco to coast like they do here, restricting drummer Glenn Kotche to a first-day-of-drum-school beat and key-man Leroy Bach to gentle organ fills. The only other misfire of the six tracks is ""Camera"", a bassy, fuzzed-out version that tramples over the delightfully subtle progression from folk-rock to laser guns in the original. But an arena-size ""A Magazine Called Sunset"" comes out better than expected, given the several lackluster Springsteen-esque demo versions floating about-- even if it sounds more like a Summerteeth outtake than a Yankee cut (count 1, 2, 3 keyboards in the first thirty seconds and know that Jay Bennett is in the hizzouse). The two folky tracks squeak by on lyrical grins, with Tweedy going meta on ""Woodgrain"" (break out your touchdown bandaids for the self-ref ""Sometimes I rhyme/ Sometimes I don't"") and making a defense mechanism out of Dylan's facial hair on ""Beard"". If you find the whole effort a tad bit underwhelming, there may be good reasons why; to connect the dots with the stopgap from the other 10.0 hate-mail-inducer of last year, Trail of Dead's The Secret of Elena's Tomb EP seems like a dressing room for the band to try on possible future directions, while More Like the Moon sounds like Wilco cleaning out their fridge, even though it's only 33% leftovers. It's not that the sextet of material here plants any seeds of doubt about the band's future trajectory-- road-tested tracks like ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" indicate there's plenty o' future to be excited about-- it's just that this release is less a tease for what lies ahead than an audit of last year's receipts. But you can easily forgive More Like the Moon for being a bit of a dry-hump, due to its free and easy distribution on Wilco's website. This gracious move is a reminder of what might have been the real epi-musical ""Meaning of YHF"": the digital-utopia-hinting fact that it was streamed on the band's own site and easy to find on file-sharing bazaars, yet still became Wilco's biggest unit-shifter by a mile, very likely due to (really, could it have been?!?) its Internet leakage. All the same, my drunken YHF ramblings stay retired, replaced by an even more ludicrous sermon about how The Rapture are going to reinvent indie music based around the mere two songs I've heard from their upcoming full-length. Don't get me wrong, I still stand convinced that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot opened up a lot of aunts' and uncles' ears to new sounds, and assuming Loose Fur didn't shut all of them back up, it's a spell that's still working. Still, More Like the Moon is far too safe a play to keep that momentum rolling between full-lengths, and fails to rise above the fan-club gift bonus it is.","Okay, show of hands: how many of you people have listened to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot recently?

Slightly West EP,Greg Weeks,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9e513d1975652139936/1:1/w_160/17eb165f.gif,2003-04-27 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8602-slightly-west-ep/,Acuarela,"There's a style of music out there sent to condition the listener into thinking that its yawning, eye-gooey sounds were faithfully cobbled together into a patchwork blanket of bedtime in some opium den, rural deep-walnut bedroom, or other plushly closed-up space with those little glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. Often, the bands who sing these self-conscious lullabies are best understood while you, the listener, are also saddled-down all cozy and half-awake, maybe with pillows over your head or your windows painted a solid, endless black (this way you can invent an ideal landscape of longing for your perfectly uninspired town). This is psych-pop, and as with all psychotropics, once you have experimented you can never go back. Eschewing a third-person adjectival name for his sleep-deprived pop-psych, Greg Weeks, who looks to me like a gaunter, fresh-faced Vincent Gallo and actually sounds a bit like that spanner of time, plays a predictable but also enjoyable brand of gentle insomniac rock. Weeks' five-song EP, Slightly West (perhaps titled in reference to a half-assed manifest destiny) often plays like it came to Weeks during a 20-minute break in an otherwise deeply restive stretch of time. In a lot of ways (some good and some bad) it barely registers on his homemade sleep-monitoring machine. The opening ""One Summer Night"" has welcoming organs like that old church song called ""Hallelujah""; for some reason it made me think of Kenny Rogers' ""We've Got Tonight"". Maybe it's the boy/girl vocals? Or the sense, impending, that this is the last day these two have together? Shit, even more confusing to the participants, it might be the first of many: ""One summer night/ By firelight/ We laid out under the stars/ And set our sights."" To be picky, I'd like it better if they set their sighs. The next four songs are standard in a lot of ways, but the addition of crunchy and distorted analog-sounding keyboard, organ, and/or synth parts make what could've been paint-by-numbers-boring sort of firefly languid. ""Unsettled (By the Sun)"" is more psych, less pop, and talks of nightmares and dreams (""Who wants inside a dream?""). The vocals are submerged in the shade of drums, organ, bass, and little jangling bells. The title track (incidentally, also the album's strongest) is comforting like the smell of a skunk on a dark road in some town you're just barely visiting. It speaks of false comforts-- ""It's safe by the sea/ The ocean/ But crawling up behind""-- but comfort nonetheless. By song four, ""Devils"", I was hemming and hawing about Weeks' voice being a bit nondescript. Here, too, the organ parts are patchy and overly ""sinister."" The song is obviously stitched and fails to flow quite as nicely as the first three: a fucked-up Frankenstein monster all awkward and unworkable. On ""Settle Down"" there are moments where I peel my ears to hear Magic Hour guitar parts, but it's never as dense or sustained (though I do think I heard a gong!). Sustain. The weakness of this offering at the alter of pixie dust is that the shit never busts out. There are those pretty moments on the first three tracks, but it largely feels truncated, like when a band has two seconds of feedback at the end of a song and then fades to the next (are we supposed to imagine endlessness?). But at the same time that I talk of making things last longer, more densely, it's actually the brevity of the recording that works in Weeks' favor, since the songwriting and singing aren't particularly striking. The mood evoked is pleasant enough-- and there's nothing overtly ridiculous or aesthetically embarrassing-- but at the same time, getting by on one connotation can only last so long. I think of the laughable melancholy of Codeine, whereas the more inspired shut-eye of, say, early Spacemen 3 could seemingly go on until forever, keeping you wrapped in dreamscapes until kingdom come, amen... But knowing one's strengths and/or limitations is nothing to push aside. On his website, Weeks mentions the importance of the EP to his oeuvre, how sometimes what needs to be said requires a short story, not a novel. I guess I just like it when there's fucked-up poetry, too. I mean, even when you're recording in a metaphorical bedroom, it helps to climb out the window or sneak through a hole in the wall and dream your nightmare on the roof, expand outward to the blank spaces around you.","There's a style of music out there sent to condition the listener into thinking that its yawning, eye-gooey sounds ...

The Summer of the Shark,Portastatic,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f2c0084474cd0bfcc8/1:1/w_160/bdbd2076.jpg,2003-04-27 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6415-the-summer-of-the-shark/,Merge,"Providing the proper context for a baggage-heavy project like Portastatic is tricky, especially without launching into some kind of perverse, indie rock version of The $10,000 Pyramid, twitching in a plastic seat and frantically hollering buzzwords: Superchunk frontman! Co-owner of Merge Records! Tropicalia! Chapel Hill! Canadian film soundtrack! Yo La Tengo! But the peripheral associations that inevitably infuse any discussion of a Portastatic record (this being Portastatic's fifth full-length, and first in six years) are often the least interesting parts. The brainchild of multi-tasking Mac McCaughan, Portastatic is pretty much a one-man show, but McCaughan has invited a host of equally talented co-conspirators to pitch in: Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney, Quasi), Tony Crow (Lambchop), and Margaret White (Sparklehorse, North Elementary) all contribute their respective bits to the record's clever, synth-punched pop/rock. The Summer of the Shark flirts with acoustic nuance (""Oh Come Down""), fuzzy guitar assaults (""Windy Village""), and rhythmic electric grooves (""Through a Rainy Lens""); McCaughan hops styles relentlessly, but rather than feeling chaotic or disorganized, The Summer of the Shark has the internal coherence of an expertly assembled mixtape. The narrative and stylistic lines running from song to song might not be instantly visible, but they're certainly present. That McCaughan wrote most of these songs on guitar is obvious, and The Summer of the Shark is a noticeable departure from 1997's less six-stringed The Nature of Sap. The album was recorded on \xBD-inch eight-track tape at McCaughan's home studio (his brother Matthew plays drums on half the tracks), but it's hardly lo-fi scrambling. Though it may not quite reach the peaks of 1997's The Nature of Sap, its polish and expert production make it Portastatic's most diverse and accomplished work to date. The excellent ""Swimming Through Tires"" opens with spare piano chords and an echoing assortment of clanks, clatters, and high-pitched bings, like a sack of forks upended over a snare drum; when McCaughan's doubled and harmonized voice finally pipes up, it's heavy with studied desperation, promising, ""I will be with you when I am able."" Soon, trombone and bowed bass slither in and curl up at the foot of the bed: the result is both comforting and oddly resigned. ""Oh Come Down"", which Mac breathily coos with Janet Weiss, is a perfectly formed pop cupcake, full of resonant acoustic guitar picking and popping drums, a vigorous, gluey bassline filling in holes as necessary. When Mac goes electric nearly four minutes in, the subsequent solo is a welcome (if anachronistic) freakout, his curious guitar syntax all the more appealing for the contrast and tension it provides. Album closer ""Hey Salty"" lets McCaughan show off his quirky, nasal falsetto and penchant for loud/quiet/loud structure; it also sees McCaughan heartily insisting, perhaps against instinct, that ""it's okay."" There are definite themes embedded here. While he's not exactly coming on up to The Rising, McCaughan does (explicitly) address the events of September 11th on The Summer of the Shark: ""I do not need another gap in my life/ When there's teeth missing in the sky downtown,"" he laments in ""Chesapeake"", before admitting, in ""In the Lines"", ""Now everyone hangs flags out their window/ I've got a white towel."" Superchunk was scheduled to perform-- as part of a Merge showcase for CMJ-- in downtown Manhattan on September 14th and, in the days directly following the attack, McCaughan nobly chose to tackle the 700-mile drive from North Carolina to New York City (passing a cracked, still-smoking Pentagon) to perform his scheduled solo set alongside The Clean, Ladybug Transistor, former Bricks bandmate Laura Cantrell, and some stranded Saddle Creekers. Released nearly eighteen months later, The Summer of the Shark is, at least lyrically, still heavy with the kind of misdirected melancholy that marked the immediate wake of the attacks. Even the record's title is seeped in subtext: in August 2001, Time Magazine ran a (characteristically) hyperbolic cover story, complete with pithy, newsstand-worthy headline: Summer of the Shark. Weeks earlier, an eight-year old boy had been brutally mauled by a bull shark while swimming off the coast of Pensacola, Florida-- the incident, unprovoked and tragic, kicked off an avalanche of sensationalistic journalism, as reporters donned wetsuits and began lurid, stupid investigations of man-eating fish. As a catchphrase, ""Summer of the Shark"" quickly went ubiquitous. Less than a month later, empty proclamations like ""Summer of the Shark"" functioned symbolically, indicative of a now-obsolete era in which a bored press had the liberty of transforming random, isolated incidents into certifiable trends. After the unprecedented events of September 11th, worry over aggressive sea creatures seemed frivolous, at best, and killer sharks slipped back into screenplays and Panama City nightmares. Journalists scurried back into blue blazers. It's an appropriate title for a record so rich in contrast. McCaughan layers distressed, despondent lyrics over addictive melodies without pause-- capturing both some of our innocence and some of our loss.","Providing the proper context for a baggage-heavy project like Portastatic is tricky, especially without\n\ launching into some kind of ...

6twenty,D4,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86fb1335d7bf16992a6/1:1/w_160/6fa55c07.jpg,2003-04-24 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2124-6twenty/,Flying Nun,"The D4 remind me of two Falstaff-like white trash guys who live down the block. Daily, like live-action Gummo, they stand in front of their house and throw rocks at the gas station across the street. When they get a hit they chuckle at each other, get loud and rowdy. Despite their pejorative comments about other races and the fact that they're as white as the cream inside a fresh Twinkie, they refer to one another as ""nigga,"" ad infinitum. So I ask you, is this awkward brotherly love or a pantomime of toughness? I sort of admire these hapless dorks for managing to exist at the top of their trailer-park game within super-hip/ultra-prissy Williamsburg, that erstwhile no-wave village in the heart of Brooklyn. Considering the cultural context, when you watch the obliviousness unfold on a daily basis, it becomes almost touching: Beavis and Butthead laughing it up as everyone walking past in turn laughs at them. Though to be fair, I guess the kid with the faux-hawk has someone else in stitches, as does the girl with the lines shaved into the side of her head, Yeah Yeah Yeahs t-shirt torn just so around the collar. Because I'm a fucking sap, I feel bad for these guys (all of them). And when I feel bad I pretend their shtick is a weird anthropology experiment, that one day they'll pull off their Coors t-shirts and baggy jeans and yell surprise, joke's on you, over-analytical prick! While listening to The D4-- four lads from Auckland, New Zealand who play lifeless garage rock about getting drunk, partying, heartbreaking chicks, and living it up all rocker-like-- I had a similar embarrassed, repulsed, nervous reaction. And, you know, I wasn't about to make fun; instead, I'd have just liked to tell them to open their eyes and stop navel-gazing, to see what exists around them, to perhaps move on. But then, the lack of immediacy on 6twenty is striking, like time gave out in a really bad way the day before meaning was invented: you wake up dizzy and pasty in a garage somewhere and realize all you know how to do is get drunk and point your guitar at your friends like a gun. Bang, bang. Ha, ha. The guitar isn't a real gun, though, so you can't touch them. When you try-- kaplow!-- stolen notes mug for the camera in slow-motion. You chump, your own guitar licks are laughing at you! Soon enough your solo's acting in its own backyard revue about time lost called Party Really F**kin' Hard, YEAH: The Musical. The existential finale: ""Son, time's a-wastin'. And I'm wasted, dude."" ""Maybe time's not gone, pop. Maybe in the garage world, the minutes are stacked differently, the seconds otherwise weighted. Like it takes an hour to shit, one second to die, a year to grow sideburns. Dig?"" ""Good point, son. Now rock out all pretty just like daddy taught ya."" The music swells, then goes limp. Poor kid hasn't even reached puberty, how's he expected to carry on the traditions of his more talented forefather? Looking like Michael J. Fox clones decked out in garage rock gear, The D4 present aural amnesia with the lyrical complexity of an even less non-ironic Andrew WK: ""Get up, get out, get loose, etc."" ""Come on, come on."" ""I'm runnin' on empty."" ""I want you, baby..."" ""Here I stand with my heart in my hands..."" It's days like this I long for lyrical abstraction. Rock was always kind of stupid-- that's part of the fun-- but when did it become entirely, unrelentingly dumbassed? And I'm not talking about intellectual capacities. Stupidity isn't measured by IQ tests or reading lists: it's what you do. I mean stupidity as no-soul alienation from the self, obliviousness to your own badness. Oh, where have all the New York Dolls gone... That's the easy dismissal of an easily forgotten band, but I want to go further. We already have The Datsuns and they're equally lame. What's with garage? These groups are so obviously coping sounds, styles, and band philosophies from contemporaries, distant historical facsimiles, and the Estrus records back catalog that it's self-reflexive parody from the second the first pick slide occurs. I'll be nice. I'll be positive. They love the Buzzcocks. You can't fault that. Also, they're from New Zealand. Solid enough country. The one vocalist/guitarist, Johnny Christmas, seems to be balding somewhat gracefully. Or his hair's just really stringy and he has a high forehead. The bass player reminds me of Alex James from Blur, but possibly sober. They played David Letterman, which means maybe my dad knows about them. They formed in 1998, a bit before the garage rock revival. Not bad. But dig deeper and see where being nice gets you. They cover Guitar Wolf's ""Invader Ace"". Guitar Wolf covers? The best song of the stinkin' lot is the cover of ""Pirate Love"" by Johnny Thunders, but only because Thunders knew how to write a song. ""Party"" is the Bay City Rollers minus the guy with the large package. Or maybe it's ""Working for the Weekend"" with less impressive drumming. The D4 are like the nerdy aliens in a bad Hollywood film who land somewhere out west and decide to mimic a band of soulful earthlings. But the problem is the aliens lack nuance, forward thinking, and any sense of aesthetic understanding. When they perform an awkward take on the earthlings' strange music, the town laughs and laughs and laughs at the ineptitude... and I have to turn off the TV because I feel bad for them. A private note to Flying Nun: I know shit's changed and nationalism's getting more important in the light of the American machine and I try to fight the good fight against whimpering and wallowing, but I do remember a time-- not so long ago-- when your label was completely and irrevocably synonymous with quality. And it was through labels like you that I first learned of and greedily consumed the haunting songs of Cakekitchen, Peter Jefferies, and The Terminals, as well as the smart pop of Chris Knox, and the noise of The Dead C. Was a goddamn sheep-infested Eden if I ever heard one! What happened to the knowledge of good and evil?","The D4 remind me of two Falstaff-like white trash guys who live down the block.

Headdress,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ab13d1975652138fe7/1:1/w_160/e8d52491.gif,2003-04-24 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7569-headdress/,Records,"When Carl Jung carved his symbols of mankind onto the face of his beloved cubic lawn jockey, among the archetypes of the collective unconscious present was surely the open hand. Part invitation and part warning, very few pictorial representations-- with the exception of the smile or frown-- are so readily recognized as the forward stare of the uncurled hand. With one glance at the album cover of The Sunburned Hand of the Man's latest release, Headdress, it's apparent that the spirit of the deceased Swiss psychiatrist is alive and well in this musical collective hailing from the darkest recesses of Massachusetts. The knit hand encircled by a background of stars embodies both the welcome and caution inherent in the music that is in turn violently cruel and unconformably beautiful. The fact that it's a patchwork appendage, obviously tailor-made with minor imperfections magnified, displays the collective approach that more than likely went into the creation of the musical product itself. One imagines a procession line of long-haired bohemians printing and then hand-gluing album covers, inserting fresh-pressed vinyl into protective sleeves made from recycled rolling papers, then boxing and shipping the fresh goods away from the confines of an abandoned barn surrounded by three feet of mostly white snow. It's from this natural and mystical bond that the music emanates effortlessly. The opening track ""Shitless"" presents all of the musical motifs at the band's command upfront for aural inspection. A funky bassline and a smattering of odd percussion act as the soil and ground from which the guitars grow forth, as a recorder eventually pushes forward against a barrage of wails and grunts, more animal than human. ""Sense of the Senseless"" develops from this with a steady hypnotic drone cut intermittently by bird-chirps and struck bells. A polyphonic chant arises-- a modern Dies Irae-- as a whistle signals a tempo change that finds solace solely in the errant harmony of frantic shouting. The song ends with a lamenting cry to ""learn from experience,"" before fading far too quickly into the harmonica-driven track ""The Illness"". With any luck, the band will heed their own plea, as the album's only true criticism can be that, at times, it sounds more like a collection of inspired moments that are cut far too short than a fully developed composition, more than likely a consequence of its finite medium. Brief windows of ingenuity such as the echo and din of the title track or the droning ebb and flow of ""A Second Guess"" would find more time to breathe, develop, and recapitulate given the format of a double album. As is, though, songs such as ""Yes, Your Highness"" don't have time to pick up the momentum of such Varèse-pleasing ideas as the use of sirens and strong complex rhythms incorporated into regular song structure. This is not to say that the entire album feels abruptly halted or rushed, as ""The Underground Press"" proves contrary. Easily the most developed piece, if not the best, this is the swaying back and forth number on the album that allows the girl wearing the kitten ears at the live show to feel that she's comfortable enough with the crowd and herself to take off her shirt. Stravinsky himself would be proud of this unadulterated use of rhythm and beat, augmented by loud hypnotic chords pulsing from a variety of instruments, ultimately falling prey to the screams and whoops that herald its necessary finale. Acting as a subtle trend in the album, the sense of prevalent necessity from song to song further merits one of the superior critiques that can be lauded upon a work of art, the discrimination of timelessness. This is not to say that the album could have been released at any given time with similar acclaim-- though it undoubtedly could have-- it's only a comment upon how the music flows so readily with complete and utter disdain for trend and fashion that it feels simultaneously primitive and advanced, while retaining every bit of its musical relevance. In the end, the music leaves one with a sense of somber contentment and satisfaction as mysterious in origin as the warmth received from the open-hand greeting of a stranger.","When Carl Jung carved his symbols of mankind onto the face of his beloved cubic lawn jockey, among the\n ...

Merit,Meanest Man Contest,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40b5e6ef9596932397f/1:1/w_160/eb7d7046.jpg,2003-04-24 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5192-merit/,Plug Research,"After the dotcom bubble burst, two guys in Oakland decided to take stock and slow down a little. Noah Blumberg (aka Quarterbar, and one-time guitarist for indie band The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up) had been collaborating with Weapon-Shaped Records founder Eric Steuer (aka Eriksolo) since 1996, in the Santa Barbara-based hip-hop act mic.edu, a promising college act cut down by the tragic death of Lafura Jackson (aka A-Twice), who fell victim to cancer. The duo started putting the pieces back together in 2001, dubbing their new project Meanest Man Contest-- probably a tongue-in-cheek reference to the dog-eat-dog mentality of the Bay Area boom-- and though they've been around for a couple years, Merit is just their first full-length. I assume the title refers to Lake Merritt, a shimmering and stagnant man-made body of water at the heart of West Oakland's most habitable district. Like the lake, Merit is unassuming and pleasant, and the album is changing how I listen to what I call ""comfort"" hip-hop, a sweeter strain of rap-inflected instrumentalism ranging from Populous to DJ Krush. You could debate whether this is really a rap album: the smooth-edged instrumentals are only interrupted a few times by Eriksolo's earnest freestyle compositions. Reminiscent of early El-P, these passages aren't explicitly hip-hop; there are no hooks-- just an endless sequence of second thoughts-- but Quarterbar's style of sampling and sequencing is definitely born of rap music, even if his preference for pristine texture and melodic levity is not. He has all the verve and hunger of a bona fide beatsmith, but he's not suffocating under any vinyl obsession-- Quarterbar is a crate digger with delicate fingers. Oddly, his beats don't change up predictably; when they do evolve, they open up suddenly and without explanation, as if someone had ripped cotton from your ears and flung open your bedroom door. His tracks have a kind of spatial coherence, each segment like a different room in the Alhambra or a smoky corner bar, or, more likely, your apartment. From the beginning, Merit promises to be a slow-growing force for good, and it does not disappoint. ""Sorry"" starts heavy on a DJ Shadow tip, flicking into a tight break, while its counterpoint ""Not Sorry"" fades in with washed-out moans, before soldiering through some chaotic cuts. Detuned guitars shimmer behind a dirty beat in ""Carpal Twist"", while ""Don't Die on Christmas"" juxtaposes the warmest organ with an evil interlude, and ""Alive in Sweet Bad Times"" works a fusion Rhodes sample into a restrained lather. Later, an unrelenting clav pattern jabs at a wizened female sample, ""You are obviously not an ordinary human being/ I promise to try no longer to take you with me."" The rest is grindage clean and pure, enclosures blunt and luscious, pockets widening, hi-hats rustling and tines chiming; it's bright guitar, fat heat, and a ripped snare. The final track charms with a slender bolero, and it's gone. Quarterbar is an impeccable housekeeper: his samples are always fresh, his effects always polite, and his textures always tasteful. All of his lilting vamps, with their no-nonsense presentation and unassuming depth, come scrubbed and radiant from a higher realm. Still, there's the unmistakable stain of something darker here, whether it's the sun-washed idleness that passes for depression on the shores of Lake Merritt, or the more obvious, life-changing tragedy the band's rebounding from.","After the dotcom bubble burst, two guys in Oakland decided to take stock and slow down a little.

"'No Depression', 'Still Feel Gone' and 'March 16-20, 1992'",Uncle Tupelo,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d8ea9e61561daa58fe/1:1/w_160/f79fd8d2.gif,2003-04-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8344-no-depression-still-feel-gone-and-march-16-20-1992/,RockvilleRockville,"In the current issue of Bookforum, Jeff Tweedy, who has been documented referencing a certain darling quartet by changing the refrain of ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" to ""Playing Joy Division covers, beautiful and alone,"" says: ""The circuit between Justin Timberlake and a fourteen year-old girl is what's really important about music, and... that connection is more profound than the one between an Interpol record and a fifty-year-old rock critic."" Whuh-oh! Holy Christgau! The Tweedist notes that if a scientist from the future came to visit us (why not a Terminator, Jeff?) that ""N*SYNC would tell him more about our culture than any Will Oldham record."" (Ahem, females have made remarkable advances in science-careering, there, Cap'n Foxtrot.) Then he half-disses Wilco! Have fourteen years of high-profile music-making got my boy all discombobulated? If he's truly under the spell of über-pop's nauseous gravity, something tells me he'd find the hullabaloo over his remastered, bonus-track-befattened early work with Joltin' Jay Farrar a tad unremarkable. And I'll admit: the worth of these discs to anyone not already a Tupelo tutee will depend on whether your response to monoliths is an infantilizing, golly-bum wonderment, or an urge to pull a Jello Biafra and tinkle on the shriney behemoths. Let me set the scene for the cultural landscape when Uncle Tupelo busted out: The cassingle shelves were still reeling from the layered grooves of Neneh Cherry's ""Buffalo Stance"". People were fascinated with the psychological underpinnings of evil-twin absorption due to Stephen King's scouring of the subject in The Dark Half. Filmgoers finally learned what happened after Chris Lloyd's unforgettable Doc flew away in the garbage-fueled hovercar; and to tell the truth, we were underwhelmed by Cyborg Biff, Western Biff, and the absence of Crispin Glover as the fitful McFly patriarch. The scene was clearly set for a pair of Illinois malcontents to usurp and enhance a country sound that had already been fangled by folks from places as far away as California, some quite well (Rank & File, Green on Red, etc). The ""heartland"" was suffering as usual from Bookended Syndrome, penned (if one can be penned in vastness) between all manner of paisley undergrounds and post-punk revivals. And even the South had that whole ""Southern"" brand to promulgate. So these two prophets of the twang-blast complaint-jam, Tweedy and Farrar, successfully tractorjacked a style of delivery, reappropriating it for the midwest, further secularizing its good-versus-evil conceits (which already hinted at man-versus-machine struggles) by installing a new industrial devilry. No Depression is, of course, the album that spawned a webboard, a magazine, and a movement (if ""movement"" is an accurate word to describe a music largely about sitting around, watching trains go by, inhaling silo rust, drinking, and feeling grandiosely bummed). What's beautiful is that the expression isn't Unkie's but A.P. Carter's, from Toop's cover of his economic theodicy ""No Depression in Heaven""-- one of two Carter covers that beg for hill-cred on this hyperactive debut. (While we're being infinitely tangential, consult Mark Zwonitzer and Charles Hirshberg's excellent page-turner Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone for a history of the spastic and rambling A.P., the father of country who stole as many songs as he wrote.) Reissues, though, demand to be examined in terms of how they ""hold up,"" and No Depression's reputation seems vestigial, especially next to its follow-up, Still Feel Gone. Sure, ""Screen Door"" is a damn good skittle of misfitude, but elsewhere the boys sound like they haven't grown into their coveralls, and they were certainly yet to discover subtlety. Tweedy's faked southern accent can induce smirks, and Farrar's spoofable earnestness might have you bellowing about assembly lines into your Body Shop hempbrush. No Depression is innovative for about thirteen minutes, after which it's sorely redundant. The sophomore album is so much stronger-- it sounds like a fourth or fifth album-- that one wonders why the bash-n-crop genre these guys spawned isn't called ""feelgone."" In addition to how Still Feel Gone's spectacular drums and (cliché alert-- but they earn it) ""blistering solos"" benefit the most from the digital refurbish, the band had settled into its song structures: the lyrics, though still awful slogany, are less strained (especially the part about ""walking cancerous miles""), the banjo backdrops are better timed, and the shifts from harmonica and acousti-pliddle into Hüsker Dü-dom are more organic. This album is a slightly wiser No Depression with plenty of power steering fluid. Though definitely saddle-punk, Still Feel Gone is interestingly the least country Tupelo record, due to its trad-coverlessness, its Minutemen tribute ""D. Boon"", its heavy-handed production by the Fort Apache crew (who knobbed everyone into Boston-fodder a la Dino Jr and Buffalo Tom), its genius opener ""Gun"" (on which Tweedy synthesizes the entirety of The Replacements' Tim), and its genius closer ""If That's Alright"" (on which Tweedy lays the groundwork for what would become known as the grunge ballad). How did it become conventional wisdom that Farrar was the better songwriter? Much of his stuff is prosaic and melody-less; he may have better pipes than Jethco, but his homemade Stipe-Mellencamp-Linnell-Rollins smoothie can get hoary and grate. Oh snap: The boys then hooked up with newly mandolin-competent producer Peter Buck, fresh from losing his religion and wearing vests over blouses, to record, in the actual South, their least characteristic but by far best album. (Sorry, Anodyne fans-- call me revisionist, but that out-n-back disc hardly sounds like a unified band. You can practically hear Tweedy sizing up new member Stirratt's mutiny-mettle. Even Still Feel Gone predicts a future schism, as any careful listener can detect seedlings of the irreconcilable differences between Farrar's insistence on gestures of meaningfulness and Tweedy's burgeoning nihilism.) Forty percent rearranged traditionals and covers, March 16-20, 1992 strove for a porchiness that risked hokum, but thankfully, Buck rendered the project pristine; you'd think it were laid down in some soundproof gazebo outside an all-retiree church. The acoustic guitar has rarely sounded better than it does here. This record's Geffen-be-damned songs against capitalism and Danzig-be-damned songs against Satan helped to make Tupelo the favorite uncle of many a bandwagon purist. The not-quite bluegrass of Tweedy's tearjerker ""Wait Up"" stands as one of the band's most inventive moments, and slowcore owes a debt to the almost-undrummable version of murderer's lament ""Lilli Schull"". (This review will now acknowledge the stickwork of Mike Heidorn. The man kept the fuggin beat.) Farrar tormentedly taps into some woodland ghost on his rendition of Dylan's rendition of the anonymous ""Moonshiner"" (since revisited by Cat Power, who rightfully added a verse about wanting to tour hell). The songs about hard labor and unionbusting on March transcend the almost-quaint pre-NAFTA factory sentiments that underscore the first two albums. Tupelo's decidedly unescapist catalog reaches its apex in these oppression anthems, which, eleven years later, still haunt as mottoes of a perennially defeated army (and Wilco would, of course, go on to double-honor workingman's minstrel Woody Guthrie). Surely gazillionaire Buck was so enraptured by the blacklung alchemy underfoot that he could have never guessed that something called Wilco would tour with R.E.M., or that he'd play with the lauded troupe on a record called Down With them. I'm the rare bitch who resents bonus tracks. They violate the sequencing of classic albums; imagine how a film's coherence would be disrupted if the ""deleted scenes"" played right after the denouement (consult the recent ripoff Forever Changes, though I won't complain about the mid-90s Ryko reissues of Bowie and Costello). This triad boasts the usual, serviceable smattering of faster versions, slower versions, live versions, and rare covers. Standouts include the unbelievably naptime-then-thunderous ""Sauget Wind"", among the band's top five songs, and proof that a fallen tree in the forest makes a bustass sound even if Albini didn't mic it. Two covers that should have been included on albums are ""I Wanna Destroy You"" (especially now that The Soft Boys are, um, soft) and Iggy's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"". These awesome homages would have broken up the austerity of Tupelo's humorless albums; one of my record-store coworkers once tossed March across the sales floor, proclaiming, ""I can't take their seriousness anymore, man: I'm trying to digest a hot dog, and I gotta live."" An aborted, hidden cover of the theme from The Waltons constitutes the ultimate pop-south surrender, though the show's atheist dad remains an inspiration. Funny how Tweedy went on to be the John The Baptist of futro folk-rock, while Farrar's last project was a (vocal-less, natch) score for a film about the homoerotic subtext of football.

The Long Goodbye,The Essex Green,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca5ea9e61561daa750d/1:1/w_160/4e6b8b9e.jpg,2003-04-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2834-the-long-goodbye/,Merge,"Deep into the month of April, and still the hunt for the spring/summer albums of 2003 goes on, tendons weary, sleep deprived, hope fading. By now the CD wallet reserves are usually full of music for those precious few humidity-free days above sixty, but lately we've been forced to resort to the standbys of years past rather than fresh meat. Originality is not necessarily a prerequisite; any virally contagious melody will do. In trying times like these, it might be helpful to look to the scraps left behind by the dissolved Elephant 6 franchise. The Essex Green offer promise, one of the few E6 acts with throwbacks to the Yankee side of psychedelic pop and the easiest group to imagine playing in Golden Gate Park at the turn of the 60s. Combining that era's strange mix of backwoods-country idealism, quaint space-race experimentation, and electric guitar dervishes, these Vermonters put together 1999's Everything Is Green, one of the finest releases from the E6 minor leagues. Now a subsidiary of the Merge corporation, The Essex Green's The Long Goodbye could be the album that moves the band out of the shadows of their former benefactors, a more mature effort and all that jazz/rock. It's a much more cohesive affair, a record less given towards ADD skips across the stylistic map, and like every band going through musical puberty, they've begun sprouting string arrangements like new body hair. Even the cocoa-rich voice of Sasha Bell, the band's most distinguishable feature, is given more precedence! So why do I forget I'm listening to the album by the time it's finished? Other than ""Our Lady in Havana"", a demurely epic Bell-sung Alice in Wonderland tale (did I mention these guys like the late 60s?) wrapped in swaddling strings, The Long Goodbye is largely ephemeral. Stripped of their eccentricities (no Irish jigs, no dye-on-the-overhead-projector guitar jams), the band seems to have evolved along the same path many of their SF idols trod, evolving into an act content to churn out happy-afternoon folk-rock like ""Sorry River"" and ""Southern States"". Meanwhile, tentative dives into more New England twang efforts are rather disappointing for a group that created an entire side project (The Sixth Great Lake) in tribute to The Band. ""Lazy May"" wrings out a nice opry from steel guitar tears, but conjures images of Russian kickdancers. Allowing that heavily ethnic sound, the merry banjo of the largely instrumental ""Old Dominion"" might as well be the score to a Sesame Street segment on barnyard animals for all the woodsy gravitas it doesn't possess. Mostly, The Essex Green just can't help sounding overly saturated by their influences, a fact that, while endearing on their debut-- where there also seemed to be more influences to draw from-- starts to show its limitations the second time around. California dreamin' like ""Berlin"" and ""The Late Great Cassiopia"" (sic) are certainly easy on the eardrums, but like bingeing on a snack food, you'll be hungry again an hour later. Even in the midst of an indie-pop drought it's still possible to be choosy-- it's not time to settle for barely noticeable breezes like The Long Goodbye just yet.","Deep into the month of April, and still the hunt for the spring/summer albums of 2003 goes on, tendons ...

Bring Along the Weather,Twin Atlas,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84b5e6ef95969321195/1:1/w_160/e9196e3b.jpg,2003-04-23 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8215-bring-along-the-weather/,Tappersize,"Suddenly, I've got a lot of Lenola in my life. It seems only yesterday that they dropped an ambitious, double-disc album on me, and now Lenola vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Sean Byrne hits me with yet another disc from his Twin Atlas side project. It's the duo's fifth album since 2000, if you include the as-yet unreleased Inside the Skate Scandal. The other Twin is Lucas Zaleski, and with their powers combined, the two make some pretty enjoyable music. Understandably, with Byrne handling lots of vocals here, it comes off something like Lenola lite, which, as it turns out, is actually kind of a good thing. See, Byrne's songwriting thrives when it's stripped of Lenola's busy psychedelic accompaniment and just allowed to present itself to you. Lenola's swirl can be enthralling, but sometimes it distracts from the melodies, and here, those melodies are laid out on top of laidback, sparse guitars, slow tempos, and gently glowing keyboards. Perhaps even more than Lenola, The Twin Atlas evoke the fluorescent folk of The Kinsgbury Manx, and the close harmonies smeared up and down this record drive the comparison home even further. The lilting acoustic strum and bold vocals of opener ""Sun Touches Down"" immediately set you down in a very comfortable place, but things really pick up on the song that follows, the excellent ""Show Me All"". Drum programming mixes with live drumming and subdued lead guitar, building to a fantastically layered chorus in which lead and background vocals weave in a classic call-and-response. Speaking in terms of pure sonics, though, The Twin Atlas have roughly the same problem as recent Lenola: homogeneity. The album's sonic character is so consistent that things bleed together at times, particularly when you get a run of similarly paced songs in the middle of the record. However, with the heavy production emphasis on melody, tracks like ""Beautiful Surprise"" can't help but differentiate themselves from the pack. Another part of what makes Bring Along the Weather work so well is its brevity-- at 39 minutes and 14 songs, it's shorter than any of the duo's previous releases (their debut, The Philadelphia Parking Authority Must Die, had 26 songs on it), and the discretion shows in the consistent quality of the material. Indeed, the band themselves remark that they implemented a stricter editing process while putting this album together-- ""y'know, make it more like a proper album, less like a bloated time-capsule,"" as they put it on their website. That approach seems to have paid off nicely, as The Twin Atlas have slipped a quietly ingratiating mickey to us with Bring Along the Weather, a fine companion piece to the headier sounds of Lenola.","Suddenly, I've got a lot of Lenola in my life.

Draft 7.30,Autechre,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14dc0084474cd0bfda1/1:1/w_160/bcae2763.jpg,2003-04-23 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/364-draft-730/,Warp,"In wondering how to get my head around Autechre's new CD, it never occurred to me that this music might not lend itself very well to aggressive analysis. Not every piece of music begs for intellectual immersion, and of course, not every listener is ready to conduct such an extensive investigation. In fact, most people probably don't waste much time with these things at all, so why should I? I remember how looking for patterns in Confield basically got me nowhere, except to notice that chaos isn't as perfect, crystalline as its made out to be by misunderstood mathematicians and restless musicians. Confield's chaos was digital, but it was also a great mess in places, merely strangely beautiful in others. Yet, despite my considerable missing of the point (and for all I know, I still am), its spark was clear. Sean Booth and Rob Brown constructed a fiber-thin moonscraper of a system: I'm not sure any of it would stand up in the face of analysis, but most of it tears down my attempts without much effort. I've never heard Autechre's music, especially their more recent stuff, described as ""inspirational"" or ""brilliant"", just ""complex"" and ""mathematical"" (and ""cold"" and ""distant"" and a catalog of other words that aren't technically bad, but are never written to mean anything good in music). Somehow, their chaos is ""complicated,"" while real-life chaos is a crisis, capable of changing lives. As I see it, LP5, EP7 and Confield are near-miraculously compact capsules of a state that would, in nature, engulf everything in its paths, and maybe as a consequence, something few people would want to approach. Well, it just so happens Draft 7.30 is a return to form for folks who thought all that gibberish I spouted over Confield was, well, gibberish. If you're old enough to remember beats, none of the ones on this record will escape your ear. Also caught are bits of melody that, rather than obscured behind nine layers of software, are often heard in broad daylight. And another thing: even with an hour of pristine, possibly perfect edifices of light and head-bobbing structures, it's possible you don't notice the music is playing. At this point, Draft 7.30 makes its most powerful impressions via the noise it fends off rather than the tunes it emits. ""Theme of Sudden Roundabout"" (in a rare populist move with coherent titling) lays its squelching beat down for all to see, and its melody, efficient in the extreme, is faintly reminiscent of the minimal watercolor of their more tuneful labelmates. Dispensing with the systematic analysis, I'd say it's pleasant, but not essentially interesting, a bit like the ultimate IDM museum piece, Clicks & Cuts-- although, Autechre are hardly producing ""micro"" music of any kind here. This is Macro is the truest sense, and yet, despite its intricate thousands of details, few combinations produce that old kinetic spark. The opener ""Xylin Room"" hits an uptempo, polyrhythmic stutter beat to the tune of Autechre's patented thud-bass and various cut-up synth noises, all in and out, over and tumble, as if the arrangement could never be made busy enough. But a fucked-up beat is a beat nonetheless, and when the actual ""xylin""phones hit, it's clear that this tune might well be the duo's take on bossa nova. It's a hard way to wrench a groove out of static air, but to me it sounds pretty convincing, so even if it fails to fill a dancefloor, it holds the ear at home. ""IV VV IV VV VIII"" is back to Confield school, albeit slightly stripped down. Somehow, the duo manages to obscure the beat without ever covering it up entirely, off-center snare slaps and cavernous echo notwithstanding. It's not all beat-fuckery, for once, as the brief ""Tapr"" proves. It begins with the drop of a plexus on glitched-up vinyl, more reverb, seemingly random synth tones and a whirlwind of low thuds and piano altered to an almost unrecognizable degree. Without pause, this ornery vignette segues into the epic, relentlessly varied ""Surripere"". Over its ten-plus minute course, a fairly simple electro-funk backbeat is transformed into chattering, squishing metallic flutter, the end result of which doesn't so much resolve to the duo's usual silver-blue noise as bump up against a brick wall, as if they just ran out of ways to mess with the same group of semiquavers. Fittingly, at best, it's a move towards the brink despite frustratingly stationary stretches; at worst, it might not be worth the time. Of course, as with most Autechre releases, there will probably be considerable differences in reception for Draft 7.30. Since it doesn't break much new ground, there will be many who dismiss it quickly (perhaps without giving it a fair shake); others will be only too glad to see Booth and Brown return to more straightforward grounds, even if they don't quite reach their mid-90s peak as melodic technicians; still others may hear a logical progression from Confield, pointing to the group's use of a similar sound palette to make a very different journey. My guess is that there's some truth in all of those viewpoints, though in the end, I'm left with the sinking feeling that, as criticism goes, an unfortunate combination of familiar methods, beats and timbres won't overshadow the ultimately uninspiring music.","In wondering how to get my head around Autechre's new CD, it never occurred to me that this music ...

No Games No Fun,Hanin Elias,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4713d197565213b2ac/1:1/w_160/c99251bb.gif,2003-04-23 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2749-no-games-no-fun/,Fatal,"Hanin Elias needs new men in her life. Merzbow, Can ""Khan"" Oral, Alec Empire: not one had the balls to be straight with her during the recording of No Games No Fun, to take her aside and let her know the album was slowly but surely devolbing into one of the biggest piles of shit in DHR or DHR-related history. Though the Digital Hardcore aesthetic has rubbed off all over her-- Elias talk-sings and spouts cold electro soundbytes over the album's cacophonous drones and drum machines-- she's completely unable to translate her message into effective lyrical content, and it's this inability to present insight into the issues that stoke her rage-- gender equality and pseudo-politics among them-- that render No Games No Fun so utterly pointless. DHR artists are, in general, more passionate than articulate in their music, preferring their abused hardware and uncomplicated war cries over detailed explanations of their political views. Elias tries to simplify things even more, and in the process severely dumbs down her angle with insipid codas and strained vocal performances; otherwise catchy tracks like the skuzzy ""The Bee"" and Alec Empire's ""You Suck""-- an orchestral cousin to ""Shards of Pol Pottery""-- are wasted. Head producer C.H.I.F.F.R.E can't seem to reconcile Elias' inert, listless vocals with the demented machines that pound away behind her; his solution-- dumping extra layers of industrial distortion onto his compositions, in hopes of distracting from the unavoidable flatness of the finished product, doesn't hold up. Is it easier to program an elaborate yet terrible piece of electronic music than to tell a girl she shouldn't quit her day job? For proof of Hanin Alias' shortcomings as a frontwoman and singer/songwriter, look no further than the opening cut, ""Catpeople"" (a collab with actor Mario Mentrup) and the obliviously hilarious rap that she lays down on ""You Suck"". An inexplicable acoustic ditty, ""Catpeople"" approximates a sort of stoned tropicalia, but the cringe-inducing refrain (""I wanna play with you/ I wanna stay with you/ I wanna get rid of you/ But now I don't know"") and Elias' meowing wouldn't go over at a grade school open mic. After a complete listen to No Games No Fun, it's apparent that ""You Suck"" is the best example of what's wrong with the album. Although the instrumentation is solid, Elias trips herself up with her unstudied politics, railing against male-defined sexuality and the objectification of women in a terrible rap that might be the inspiration for Madonna's anal MC-ing. How does Elias respond to male chauvinist pigs and dickless bastards who try to marginalize and abuse her? With a resounding ""You suck."" Naturally, it's screamed ad nauseam over a groaning analog synth. If ever feminism were to do a little house cleaning, Elias would find herself in a bag on the curb for such a juvenile retort, the doors of the movement slamming behind her. Within the ATR unit, Elias wielded her revolutionary power more admirably, working better as a component in the anarchist machine than the whole engine. No Games No Fun finds Elias trying on shoes that are just too damn big, and it's a crying shame no one told her before she hit the town wearing them.","Hanin Elias needs new men in her life.

The End of the Beginning,Murs,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c417c0084474cd0c35f6/1:1/w_160/c70ecd06.jpg,2003-04-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5513-the-end-of-the-beginning/,Definitive Jux,"When I saw the first Def Jux promo poster (pre-""Definitive"" lawsuit), I knew El-P was on to something incredible. An unsightly wash of black and burgundy was yelling at me to check for releases from Mr. Lif, Aesop Rock, and relative newcomers Cannibal Ox. I knew if El-Producto had remotely anything to do with these projects that this little-label-that-could would easily rise from the ashes of Rawkus Records. And this was excitement that hit me before I got to the fine print: ""Coming Soon: full-length from Murs of Living Legends."" Not only would this label rise from those ashes, it would sweep them up and use them for gunpowder. Almost three years later, many of us understand the monolithic Castle Grayskull of a record label Definitive Jux has become. From the industrial, Orwellian paranoia of Fantastic Damage and The Cold Vein, to the blue-collar approach of Labor Days, to the ""no blood for oil!!!1!!1"" sentiments of I, Phantom, the label has attempted to make cohesive LPs in a predominately singles-oriented genre. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who refutes the idea that they have succeeded-- unless, of course, you're a Living Legends fan. Living Legends devotees are the most fickle people in the musical kingdom. If a release has the ""LLCREW"" seal of approval, it's prematurely hailed as ""album of the millennium."" This is not to say the West Coast representatives have done anything wrong-- on the contrary, their output has been some of the most consistent hip-hop since the underground boom of the mid-90s. To the diehards, though, all other artists must reach the bar set by these Los Angelinos to be considered ""good music."" Murs is arguably the most beloved Legend; terribly prolific, the man has been bringing heat for nearly ten years. Hearing he would be making moves with a Def Jux collective that practically oozes New York has been shocking to many, but for both Company Flow and 3MG lovers alike, the anticipation has been for something nothing short of spectacular. So it's odd that The End of the Beginning is the most traditional hip-hop record Def Jux has produced to date. Fresh off thematically unified solo releases like the solid Varsity Blues and the underrated Slug collabo Felt: A Tribute to Christina Ricci (she was so fly in That Darn Cat!), Murs has been cultivating the art of storytelling in his raps for some time now. It's this mode of rhyming that predominates his latest release, but only track by track. The album lacks the dogged coherence that's become such a Def Jux staple. What's left is a scattershot of tunes recorded all across the stars and bars from the past few years; the album is truly a collection of singles. ""What's the problem with that, duke?"" you may be wondering. Well, there isn't one. The songs Murs has selected for the album are, for the most part, well above average. The insanely chopped guitar sample in ""God's Work"" (produced by Belief) is the perfect backdrop for Murs to spit on the toils of keeping up with touring, holding a day job, and paying credit card bills. One of the two Ant (of Atmosphere) contributions, ""Got Damned?"", is filled with simple piano frills and an accelerated soul vocal, soaked in drums that thunder through every four bars. Murs, in a rare moment of politicizing, gets open: ""I'm not your average rapper talkin' shit about the government/ It's not that I'm loving it, it's where I live/ They try to bomb the place where I wanna raise my kids,"" later getting all Travis Morrison on that ass with the lines, ""It ain't a game, there is no aim, they want America crushed/ If you don't like Bush, you're still dying with us."" Perhaps even more rare, El-P's production gets outshined by an emcee. Murs kills it on the double-time ""The Dance"". Cramming ""what, you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst/ Push your girl on the ground so that you can run first?"" into two measures is no simple task. Still, the album does have its missteps. ""Transitionz Az a Ridah"" is Murs' ode to skateboarding, rapped over the ambient sounds of a skate park. Creative? Sure. Hella good? Nope. You'll also think Murs has been watching too much Lifetime when it comes to the track ""BT$"" (born to shop, sister!). Nonetheless, the album becomes a good starting point for any newbie to Murs' discography. Completely positive and straightforward, he has created the soundtrack for any 9-5er hoping for some hip-hop salvation from a schedule that doesn't permit time for the density of other Def Jux releases.","When I saw the first Def Jux promo poster (pre-""Definitive"" lawsuit), I knew El-P was on to something incredible ...

All Your Summer Songs,Saturday Looks Good to Me,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35913d1975652138a84/1:1/w_160/27570df0.jpg,2003-04-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7002-all-your-summer-songs/,Polyvinyl,"Possible ways to describe the music of Saturday Looks Good to Me, one of Detroit-based indie laureate Fred Thomas' approximately 38 bands: Scuffed-up transistor radio with a blown speaker beaming time-travelled frequencies from 1957-1967. What The Beach Boys might have sounded like if they recorded in an underwater cove. A warped vinyl copy of your favorite pop record played on one of those tan Fisher Price record players we all owned as kids. If such descriptions set off the alarms of your festering indie-remorse, fear not. Though indie rock once defiantly waved the banner of lo-fi production, Slanted & Enchanted setting off a four-track reverse arms race over who could broadcast their music with the most slackitude and hiss-teria, I don't mean to trumpet that the budget sound of All Your Summer Songs makes it more ""real"" than a similar product of modern technology. Rather, I've come to the diplomatic conclusion that intentionally beat-up production simply complements bands who are bent on re-examining time-worn musical ideas. Fred Thomas' Saturday Looks Good to Me is one of these bands, a large Michigan-based collective trying their hand at familiar oldies-station molds: walls of sound with bricks of brass and stringed instruments, arpeggio-heavy prom themes, shy soul, and surf grooves with radio-friendly ambitions. All of these songs are filtered through enough layers of reverb and ambient noise (courtesy of knob-twiddling from Thomas and His Name Is Alive's Warn Defever) to sound like they're coming from the past-their-prime speakers of Dad's old station wagon, a process that, paradoxically, strips them of their nostalgia and lends them fresh personality. Take ""Meet Me by the Water"" as a representative sample. Opening with snare hits that sound recorded from two rooms over and a wood block clack processed into liquidity, the song rides on piano and guitar parts that bleed reverb profusely, and stratospheric, echo chamber'd female vocals which lend an airy spaciousness that could handicap it for some as typical cassette indie-pop. At least, until the dead-sincere saxophone solo, the verse where the elements fly off and reassemble at random in dub fashion, and the warm electric blanket coda of Loveless-style guitar. All in less than 1/20th of an hour, radio standard time. Different shades of these textures are evident throughout All Your Summer Songs, with distantly familiar drum tracks being manipulated into submission and orchestral ambitions being squeezed through a four-track to come out the other side in unexpected fashion. Brass, string sections, and buzzsaw guitar fight for elbow room through the galloping ""Underwater Heartbeat"" and ""Alcohol"", while irresistibly catchy sections fly by before you even realize it, never to return. ""Ambulance"", a song taken from the band's self-released debut, is recast here as a duet featuring Ted Leo working out his lower register over taut guitar and Comiskey Park organ. Leo's not the only mild celebrity appearing on All Your Summer Songs; Thomas turns over the singing to a basement-show all-star cast including Tara Jane O'Neil and Ida's Karla Schickele. Given the microphone-swapping details and torch-song performances, it's easy to think of the album as an even more obscure version of Stephen Merritt's 6ths album showcases, albeit stripped of the synthesizers, showtunes, and (save the lackluster title track) creepy baritone. The liner notes, unfortunately, fail to offer beleaguered critics a key to connect the vocal dots, but I'll vouch that the women fare best: The wide-eyed vocals of ""Caught"" skim playfully over what sounds like my childhood church's handbell choir, and the twee breathiness of ""Ultimate Stars"" nests perfectly within the track's chamber take on the riff from Booker T's ""Time Is Tight"". The male chorus gets stuck with the ballad catalog, but Thomas himself (I think) makes showstopping, cracked performances of the starry slow-dance numbers ""The Sun Doesn't Want to Shine"" and ""Last Hour"". So while the album lags somewhat in the middle (""Typing"" is a little bit Belle, a little bit Sebastian), All Your Summer Songs is unshakeable and unique enough overall to be the frontrunner for Official Rob Mitchum Warm Weather Album '03. With enough melodic chops to keep the project from falling into a pit of esoteric experimental production, and enough studio inventiveness to prevent the record from being Brian Wilson Love Letter #3451, Saturday Looks Good to Me seem poised to spring from tape-trading in dusty Ann Arbor record shops to national semi-stardom on the label emo built. Yes, Michigan!","Possible ways to describe the music of Saturday Looks Good to Me, one of Detroit-based indie laureate Fred Thomas' approximately ...

"Fandam Plus: Instrumentals, Remixes, Lyrics & Video",El-P,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc21abf31b7dc7155c4e/1:1/w_160/b93066c4.gif,2003-04-22 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2713-fandam-plus-instrumentals-remixes-lyrics-video/,Definitive Jux,"El-P's Definitive Jux label has made some serious headway over the past two years, gaining enough momentum to inflate it from fledgling dream to full-blown phenomenon. After a strong run at the end of its first calendar year with the Cannibal Ox and Aesop Rock records, 2002 saw Def Jux drop Bush-worthy bombs in the form of RJD2's Deadringer and Mr. Lif's I Phantom. Yet the heaviest waves were reserved for the impresario himself, as El-P unleashed his first post-Company Flow work upon the hip-hop world with the jawdropping beauty that was Fantastic Damage. Picking up exactly where he had left off with that groundbreaking trio's demise, Fantastic Damage showcased both E-L-dash's incomparable production talent (particularly for anyone who slept on Can Ox's The Cold Vein) and his considerable skills as an MC. Of course, Co-Flow fans already knew and revered his gifts behind the boards and the mic, but the hype accumulated by the label's growing reputation as the Motown of indie hip-hop only increased the record's promise for impact. These days, instrumental hip-hop albums are generally suspect. Since The Instrumentalyst, it's almost as if hip-hop crews feel an obligation-- the only problem being that not every extended family member is Dan the Automator. At best, they do offer some exposure for potentially overlooked DJs or producers; at worst they give someone the chance for some private (or public) fun, karaoke-style. But let's not forget that El-P released an instrumental hip-hop album (Little Johnny from the Hospitul) with Company Flow that wasn't just a ""vocals surgically removed"" version of the already-hit record, but rather a fully conceived collection of instrumental tracks created by El-P and Mr. Len specifically for that project. In other words, the man has a little more cred than DJ Average or some other producer trying to milk his record for another dollar or two-- and furthermore, it made perfect sense for him to release an instrumental version of the Cannibal Ox record, especially considering that Vast Aire and Vordul are an admittedly acquired tastes as far as MCs go. Which brings us to Fandam Plus, the instrumental companion to Fantastic Damage. While it's certainly no replacement for the original-- a record justifiably present on any 2002 top-ten list that matters-- it does offer some valuable insights into El-P's production that aren't readily apparent on the vocal version. Take ""DeLorean"", for example, which, without the distraction of Ill Bill's knuckleheaded guest verse about getting his dick sucked in a strip club by a cokehead, shows how truly amazing the bridge's breakbeat is. ""Truancy"" provides another test case, one in which the lack of El-P's stream-of-consciousness wordflow reveals the beat as the illegitimate offspring of the Beastie Boys' ""Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun"". And then there's ""Accidents Don't Happen"", which in instrumental form serves an even clearer reminder that El-P was incorporating Middle Eastern vibes into hip-hop (see Company Flow's ""The Fire in Which You Burn"" from Funcrusher Plus) long before Missy Elliott and Timbaland made it fashionable. Of course, just as Newton's Law prescribes, for every great moment on Fandam Plus there's an equal and opposite reaction. ""Deep Space 9mm"", one of the original record's strongest highlights, sounds haphazard and clunky without El-P's meticulous verse to hold it all together. Similarly, both the title cut and ""TOJ"" come off rather flat without the vocals to set up each track's powerful dynamic shifts. But of all the instrumental mixes, ""Dr. Hellno Vs. The Praying Mantis"" probably disappoints the most-- it's still a fine slice of robofunk, but gets awfully monotonous without El-P's hallucinatory sexcapade narrative. As an added bonus, the second disc of Fandam Plus includes several appetite-whetting rarities that will most likely be the major selling point for Def Jukies. Of the remixed audio tracks, RJD2's deconstruction of ""Lazerface's Warning"" satisfies most deeply, particularly for turntable-deficient fans that missed the 12-inch on which it originally appeared. RJD2 gives the cut a little more traditional hip-hop flavor, courtesy of a tastefully scratched intro, tightened-up beat and supremely sick vocal sample that he weaves into the very fabric of the mix. Throw in a CD-ROM component with complete lyrics to the original album (to further fuel those karaoke dreams, even though you can't actually print out the damn things), the ""hip-hop Taxi Driver"" video for ""Deep Space 9mm"", and some live performance footage (including a version of the rare Company Flow classic ""Patriotism"", which no fan should go without hearing) and you've got the makings of a real collectors' package. Unfortunately, what relegates Fandam Plus to the status of mere curiosity piece is that it really is just a ""vocals surgically removed"" version of Fantastic Damage. After serving up a record like that, our man El-Producto doesn't really need to prove his skills (surgical or otherwise), but if he'd made the effort to remix some elements of the backing tracks or switch up the running order, he might've achieved something closer to a kidney transplant than a tonsillectomy.","El-P's Definitive Jux label has made some serious headway over the past two years, gaining enough momentum to inflate ...

Granted, there were some great songs on that album-- their excellent versions of ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" and ""Crossroads"" (and, of course, you can't fuck with ""White Room"")-- but the album's rigorous overall consistency in tone and color made it remarkably dull as a whole. 35 years later, along comes Lenola, with another double album that proves psychedelic music can still be pretty monochromatic, a full generation after the term came into being. I'm not making any musical comparison between Lenola and Cream at all: Cream's brand of psychedelia sat heavily on blues for its foundation, while Lenola are the product of something altogether different, more pastoral and more modern. Since losing original bassist Scott Colan and expanding into a quintet, they seem to have been hit to death in the future head, basking in the glow of the Flaming Lips and borrowing whole chapters from the book of Mercury Rev whilst largely kicking to the curbside the UK shoegazer influences that shaped their early records. In short, they're drawing from a host of sources either directly or tangentially related to Lips producer Dave Fridmann, but the honeyed harmonies that coat each song have a certain whiff of 70s AM gold about them as well-- several of these songs could easily be in the same subdivision as ""Our House"". Lenola take a decidedly rockist approach to their influences, building remarkably lush sounds for a home recording but steering widely clear of the incandescent orchestration the Lips and the Rev are so taken with these days. The unfortunate thing is that the band's songwriting process churns out twenty decent tracks, but almost none of them stand out: the two discs are for the most part interchangeable. That the second disc is generally slower-paced and less memorable than the first only makes the album feel much longer than its combined 82 minutes. The opener, ""Eternal"", is particularly great, however, giving the guitars one last moment of complete dominance before setting them back next to the numerous keyboards that have found their way into the band's stable. The song is one of the few that employs a real climax, opening with fervent strumming and swelling harmonies and ultimately bursting into a fuller texture borne on pounding drums, all the while flaunting some nice fretboard fireworks. ""Sudden Stop"" stands out as well, employing a jittery rhythm, and strange, woozy modulations that throw the verses somewhat off kilter; ""Gentleman Overboard"" brings in luminescent keys and bells to highlight the chord structure and create a countermelody to the vocals over the album's liveliest beat. Yet, despite some good material, Sharks and Flames ultimately succumbs to that age-old double album curse: it just doesn't need to be as long as it is, and with some editorial discretion, it could have been much easier to swallow. There's no reason for a plodding song like ""Traffic Lights"" to stretch beyond five minutes (or make the cut at all, really), and I get the general feeling that the number at the top of this review would be higher if the cutting room floor were more cluttered. Lenola are a Good Band, but if I might borrow a sentiment from fellow scribe Matt LeMay, they've yet to make a Great Album. Sharks and Flames shows it's not for lack of trying, but, for now, Lenola remain a possibility, perhaps capable of something better.","The cover of Cream's 1968 double album Wheels of Fire features one of those crazy psychedelic bubble drawings that ...

Thickfreakness,The Black Keys,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e6b1335d7bf16985c8/1:1/w_160/de4fb5f0.jpg,2003-04-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/766-thickfreakness/,Fat Possum,"The pressure to make a White Stripes comparison here is almost unbearable, so I'll get this out of the way quick-like: The Black Keys and the Stripes will inevitably be indexed on the same page in the great canon of Rock history, but paper similarities aside-- each duo brazenly, turbulently rehashing American blues tradition through a minimalist storm of scraping guitars and bruised skins-- they've got almost nothing in common. The Black Keys may just be a couple of white dudes from Akron, but they seem closer in spirit to something that Muddy Waters himself might've considered ""the blues"" than to any midwestern bar-band's approximation of it. The only Stripes link of any importance, in fact, is that the Keys' previous album was better, too. Last year's The Big Come-Up introduced the garage-grime and ""white Hendrix"" croon of The Sonics to the unholy strut of Junior Kimbrough's legendary guitar lines, fusing them into a spitting, spewing, 40-ton monster. Winners like ""Heavy Soul"" evoked the primal ballet of Fordzilla crushing unmanned Buicks, and when it wasn't busy flattening rides, still offered a glimpse of the delicate machinery under the hood with soul cuts like ""I'll Be Your Man"". With Thickfreakness, the once-massive guitar is exponentially weightier, thicker, and juicier, swelling to Earth-shaking proportions, at the unfortunate loss of a little subtlety. But that's just the way it is sometimes; there's no room for luxuries like nuanced variations in tone, or shifting rhythms when you're fleeing from a fire-breathing behemoth. Still, swallow enough white-hot blues riffs and you get heartburn; it's hard not to miss Come-Up's pace-breaking exercises like ""Countdown"" or ""Them Eyes"" after blues explosion #348 (and counting). Even at its most delicate, Dan Auerbach's fretwork still hits like a hollowbody that's been filled with cement, and Patrick Carney's swaying grooves seem suppressed, driven further back in the mix. Once again, the Keys stomp as violently and elementally as before, but they nearly get carried away. Tracks like ""If You See Me"" and ""Hurt Like Mine"" attempt to reduce Thickfreakness' wildfire to merely a controlled burn, but even when the Keys try to play it cool on this album, they still run hot. Nothing strays too far from the molten desperation of a more typical offering of ""Midnight"" or an uber-faithful cover of The Sonics' ""Have Love Will Travel"". Ah, but who'm I kidding? Thickfreakness may veer towards oppressively monolithic, but it's also equal parts sincerity and devotion, thunder and lightning, majesty and naked anger. Look upon the power of the title track, mortals, and despair! The central riff splits heaven and earth, and for a few brief minutes, commands all your attention as you fear for your very life; it's an exorcism, a catharsis. And it only gets thicker and freakier from there, lurching into the cautionary force of the too-similar ""Hard Row""; like a simplified, but equally relentless version of its predecessor, the simple bluster is momentarily awe-inspiring. When Auerbach howls, ""It's a hard row to hoe by yourself,"" the release is overwhelming. But sure enough, the intensity of the opening combination proves impossible to maintain for long. Though the stutter-stepping percussion and racing, rise/fall soloing of ""Set You Free"" nearly succeeds at preserving the pummeling drive beyond all limits of human endurance, it ends up being the most purely entertaining cut on the album simply out of the necessity for respite. The body braces itself for another towering blast after being further skewered by Auerbach's nasty hooks in the opening seconds, and gets (only a little) less than that, but the relaxation is welcome. From that point on, Thickfreakness begins to run together slightly, though as mentioned earlier, not for lack of energy. The related concerns of a need for a bit more understatement and variety hinder the Black Keys this time around, but remain somewhat insignificant in relation to their even-more-muscular blues attack. On top of that, the ultra-minimal echoes of ""Cry Alone"" and the R.L. Burnside-as-channeled-thru-MC5 tangle of ""Hold Me in Your Arms"" partially ameliorates the somewhat pervasive sameness, closing the album with a distinctly different sound than they've yet shown. All told, the shortcomings are relative to what the duo already proved themselves capable of on The Big Come-Up; Thickfreakness isn't quite their debut, but it's still a powerhouse, even exceeding its ancestor in total spectacle. Raw rock grandeur as so frequently conjured up on this album is hard to come by in any capacity; if that means having to overlook a few minor flaws, it's worth it.","The pressure to make a White Stripes comparison here is almost unbearable, so I'll get this out of the ...

Animal Chin,Jaga Jazzist,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bf9d034d5c69bf52c2/1:1/w_160/6e3cf647.jpg,2003-04-21 05:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4195-animal-chin/,Gold Standard LaboratoriesGold Standard Laboratories,"For a country of a scant few million, Norway has a staggeringly deep music scene. A favorite to usurp Nordic comer Iceland-- and easily outpacing the rockist Swedes next door-- Norway boasts an interconnected scene of electronica, improv, and avant-rock that hasn't yet reached our shores except through imports. That makes Jaga Jazzist's first stateside release, the Animal Chin EP, significant: not only are the band's members tied to dozens of other major Norwegian outfits, they also cram all those strains of music into a single, mind-foggingly dense package. Imagine if someone replaced all the lamps in your house with strobe lights and neon, and you'll get an idea of the kind of claustrophobic overstimulation Jaga Jazzist instill from minute one of this record. Jaga Jazzist have been pegged as a state-of-the-art jazz-rock \x93fusiox94 band, a nine-piece (recently upped to ten) that mix conventional jazz instruments-- a horn section, drums, upright bass and guitar-- with layers of tightly-sequenced synths and keyboards, electronic percussion, vibes and marimba. Yet the band sounds more \x93jazzy\x94 than jazz: with the improvisation confined to closely-managed solos, texture dominates. Sections will stop or switch on a dime, and every instrument sounds rich, the luscious bass clarinets or Martin Horntveth's drums and electronic percussion scattering like a boxful of precisely-tuned robots. Think of Steely Dan producing a Tortoise album, or imagine a dottier, loopier Stereolab disc while digging the Latin feel to songs like \x93Real Racecars Have Doors\x94, where the band ventures onto a style that comes as naturally to Norwegians, slopping hot salsa on reindeer filets. But the sound may be familiar to fans of 70s jazz fusion: while none of the soloists are show-offs-- you won't hear a Chick Corea or a John McLaughlin wanking into the spotlight-- the writing shows a fusion-like tendency to use intricate, knotty melodies that are catchy but impossible to hum along with. The arrangements set them apart, from the title track's bright, brassy horn fills and cascading vibes to \x93Low Battery\x94, which has a slower tempo, and even settles from time to time on a simple vamp; \x93Toxic Dart\x94 is jumpier, and shredded underneath with glitches. While the songs run a concise few minutes per, they're spliced and melted together from multiple sections containing a dozen ideas each. It's telling that the two remixes-- which suck up half the album-- actually sound far less busy than the original songs. Martin Horntveth remixes \x93Lithuania\x94 himself and chops up the source, then buries it under an insect swarm of glitchery which effectively steals the show-- and gives us something simpler to focus on. Meanwhile, the Kim Hiorthøy remix of \x93Going Dowx94 stretches into a sixteen minute collage of found sound and conversations with a (comparatively) simple drumbeat, all built around a loop of just the first couple bars of the original track's melody, played on acoustic guitar. For its ambition, it's almost boringly simple compared to the rest of the album. Animal Chin is only Jaga Jazzist's first stab at the U. S. market after taking Europe with their Ninja Tune/Smalltown Supersound releases; most of the songs are culled from their two full-lengths and other scattered EPs. As a sampler for new listeners it could leave you intrigued, or even sated. Anyone who's already spent too much time listening to fusion may know the kind of ear candy gut-ache it can produce, like chowing down a one-pound bag of Skittles in one sitting: for the overwhelming taste, you'll get plenty of color coming and going.","For a country of a scant few million, Norway has a staggeringly deep music scene.

""Do you really think Pitchfork will like it, sir? Why, where are the extended metaphors?"" ""Well, I was going to pretend to be a reviewer from a time before Spiral Scratch who'd been visited by this time-travelling Billie Joe Armstrong replicant."" ""Can we be your extended metaphor, sir?"" piped in diminutive Noel St. John. His huge, pale eyes met mine and he began coughing weakly into his sleeve. ""Okay, Noel, sure, why not? Let's see... well, sometimes musical genres get together, just like mommies and daddies, and, of course, it seems like an excellent idea at the time, and, by design or by accident-- usually the latter-- they produce a new genre. And it starts out very cute and lovable, sure, but soon it begins to whine and demand and smell funny and then, wham, it gets dropped off a bridge or left in a deacon's mailbox or..."" ""Surely, Mr. Reid, you're not blaming the Buzzcocks for creating all of pop/punk!"" Sophie Higgins chirped. ""Certainly, most of it is wretched, but you can't hold them responsible for what's come afterwards."" ""I'm blaming them for making it look too easy, Sophie. When the Buzzcocks started, punk was still something of a reaction against pop, and combining the two has always been a rock-paper-scissors sort of affair-- punk bludgeons the nuance out of pop, and pop sweetness neuters punk attitude. A straight mixture of the two almost always ends up as musical slapstick, and for pop/punk to work in any context besides novelty, the balance has to be close to perfect. Even though the Buzzcocks sounded like they were always playing with complete abandon-- er, sorry, poor choice of words, kids-- they had the instincts and the songwriting talent to hit that mark with decent frequency. Most every band that followed them didn't. Pop/punk pretty much turned out to be a one-trick genre, and the Buzzcocks were that trick."" ""That's a lot of past tense, Mr. Reid,"" observed Alexis Chittenden. ""Are we, the Buzzcocks' fans, also orphans, in a sense, sir?"" ""Okay, so look at it like this. Blink-182 and Good Charlotte are the mean old orphanage proprietors Mr. and Mrs. Nesbitt, and Green Day is that old gentleman who used come by with candy every once in a while before he died in the mandolin accident: It feels like they've been gone forever, but the Buzzcocks were only ever really broken up for a large chunk of the 80s (negligible, given the fact that they're pushing thirty as a band). They've been a steady act for over a decade now, though; the past tense refers to the fact that their best material has always been the stuff that does the least to disturb the distortion/melody accord they struck in the late 70s. And, while the Buzzcocks have wisely passed on innovation with this new album, they also display only an intermittent control of that distinctive touch that makes the pop/punk marriage worthwhile."" ""L-losing their touch, sir?"" Nevil Greenleaf stammered, his rheumy eyes moistening. ""Well, maybe not losing it... their albums were always spotty, and few fans ever see the need to probe beyond Singles Going Steady. And, true, a couple of these songs would be right at home on that comp. 'Friends', for instance, finds the band's component parts in inspired cooperation-- the breezy melody, giddily climbing chord progression, and chainsaw guitars all work to whittle the angstful central assertion, 'I don't even know if I'll ever be loved again/ The only thing I can rely on is chay-ee-ange!' down to snotty-sincere perfection. Most, however, fail by inches, not quite tight enough to hold their charm for more than a few listens. 'Sick City Sometimes' works brilliantly as an anthem as long as you can keep the image of Andrew W.K. covering the Gin Blossoms' 'Hey Jealousy' out of your head. The resurrected Howard Devoto-era gem 'Lester Sands', while sharp as ever, only suffers from the much cleaner production and Pete Shelley's newly acquired snarl. In fact, a lot of the album's problems come from overaggressiveness; the further the balance tips toward loud-and-fast, the deeper the split in their musical personality show. The Buzzcocks have never needed to bash a chorus into our heads as mercilessly as they do here on 'Keep On' and 'Morning After', and the grinding fade-outs of each song seem to announce the cynic's ultimate victory over the sensitive."" ""But sir, we need both!"" cried Alvin Witherspoon-Devonshire. ""How ever are we to deal with our wretched lives without their cheeky take on childhood angst?"" ""Well, the Buzzcocks have moved on, Alvin. They've still got angst to spare, but their wit has been ground down by 'maturity,' or whatever you want to call it, into a bitter thing that saps a lot of that reckless energy. Sure, it's great when Shelley matter-of-factly snots into mortality's handkerchief with his declaration that 'Life's only temporary/ And then you fucking die!' on the final track, but the drawn-out instrumental interlude and guitar solo drag that pissed-off punch towards mopery. But, you don't have to move on, Alvin! You don't have to imagine a grand, noble death for them, as you have for your parents; The Buzzcocks have left you Singles Going Steady! And there's still that gleam of greatness left in this one."" It was no use. One by one, the children all started bawling. A single tear slid down my cheek, too.

Diamonds on the Inside,Ben Harper,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c063ea9e61561daa7bea/1:1/w_160/42257808.jpg,2003-04-21 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3747-diamonds-on-the-inside/,Virgin,"In Pleasure and Pain, Danny Clinch's documentary of Ben Harper's 2001 Burn to Shine tour, Harper is caught throwing a cute-if-cantankerous fit on camera, whining and snapping at a European journalist like a pot-smoking Thom Yorke. It's funny, but not especially surprising that when faced with a middling reporter, Harper found his knickers in a bit of a twist: he's been misunderstood by the mainstream music press for nearly a decade now, and bumbling critics are at least partially to blame for the sloppily cobbled together batch of tracks on his latest studio release, the scattered Diamonds on the Inside. Since his 1993 debut, Ben Harper has been getting all tangled up in his influences-- he's inadvertently hog-tied himself with big, fat superstar ropes, each woven from stringy bits of Hendrix, Redding, Marley, Plant, Page, and a few stray Dylan hairs. This is as much a product of a lazy press (who relentlessly-- aw, shit!-- point out and examine his many muses) as it is his own musical mishmash, but either way it's got Harper stuck and wiggling for release. Disparate inspiration isn't a problem on its own, but Harper's inability to stabilize and carve himself a personality sure is. Neo-blues-soul-metal-punk-reggae-gospel-rock-funk is far too cumbersome to be a proper qualifier, and Diamonds on the Inside's breathless Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock whirlwind is tiring, at best. Harper's now-trademark lack of focus-- which is especially disappointing because dude's got skills with that slide!-- is destined to forever supercede his considerable songwriting talent. Diamonds on the Inside opens with its first single, ""With My Own Two Hands"", an optimistic and aggressively reggae-inspired bit of dancehall wah-wah, complete with Hammond B3, clavinet, and high, lazy backing vocals. Harper swings effortlessly from a low, throaty growl to his excellent soul falsetto, and the rich, dynamic percussion (Oliver Francis Charles on drums) works remarkably well here. It's what happens next that gives pause: the sparse, southern gospel romp ""When It's Good"" stars a completely different breed of Harper, blues-driven and virtually unaccompanied (save a box of rocks, some background singers, and his acoustic slide). Meanwhile, the title track is a thick, sentimental Lynyrd Skynyrd guitar throwdown, featuring a singalong chorus and sweet, lilting pedal steel, electric piano, bass, and guitars; the aptly titled ""Bring the Funk"" is pure gimmick, all synthesizers and poorly channeled Parliament. ""So High So Low"" is heavy, Zeppelin-inspired metal thrashing, kick-started by some kind of otherworldly primal scream. And on and on: slices of this and chunks of that. Slow down, Harps, I'm getting freakin' confused! What kind of goulash you serving here, anyway? Despite Diamonds on the Inside's pointed identity crisis, there are still some standout songs. Ladysmith Black Mambazo pop up on the vocals-only ""Picture of Jesus"", which, despite its heavy-handed religious meditations, is a textured, vigorous, and engaging contemporary hymn. The brisk and solo-friendly ""Touch from Your Lust"" (seriously, what does that mean?) would have fit nicely on Burn to Shine, with its Lenny Kravitz bellbottom howls and heavy electric guitar noodling. Harper has never been a particularly keen lyricist, but the introductory line of ""When She Believes"" (""The good Lord is such a good Lord/ With such a good Mother, too"") is especially ridiculous, and the ""Behind all of your tears/ There's a smile/ Behind all of the rain/ There's a sunshine for miles and miles"" of ""Everything"" seems equally uninspired. To the contrary, new-favorite-word ""shuck"" is employed superbly in ""Bring the Funk"" (""Some are jiving/ Some are shuck/ Some are just down on their luck""). To his immense credit, Ben Harper pulls off rock star posturing even though he sits in a chair while playing live (an achievement Jagger has not yet approached-- maybe this explains the incessant arena-touring?), and his performances are always charismatic affairs, especially if you're okay with little kids dancing shirtless outside. It's onstage that Harper excels, his humble grace and organic porch singing somehow capable of tugging sunburned college students away from the falafel tent and back to the main stage; live, his scattered influences are far less distracting and his playing takes on a more even and consistent edge. Other artists have played the don't-pigeonhole-me card with slightly more success-- Beck unapologetically flits between genres and styles, but has enough sense (or enough handlers) to centralize his records in a way that makes them thematically comprehensible. Even when artists self-consciously draw from a long, complicated lineage of diverse sounds and tactics, there still needs to be an organizing principle; ideally, individual tracks should contribute something substantial to the greater whole, like a chapter in a novel or a stanza in a poem, each cohesive, directed, and pushing towards a narrative payoff. All fourteen tracks here are autonomous, but as a record, Diamonds on the Inside feels pretty empty.","In Pleasure and Pain, Danny Clinch's documentary of Ben Harper's 2001 Burn to Shine tour, Harper is caught ...

Friends Forever,Magas,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c365ea9e61561daa7ee7/1:1/w_160/bdbc8bbc.jpg,2003-04-21 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5031-friends-forever/,Ersatz Audio,"Friends Forever isn't a metal record, but let's pause for a second anyway and give credit where credit is due: hardly anyone appreciates the deep and complex sense of humor metalheads have about the music they like. They're one of a few subgroups of music fans who can take their music intensely seriously and laugh their asses off about it at the same time. Half of the point, after all, is to deliver that mind-boggling, ridiculous more: more guts, more demon oratories, more insane, unbelievable, undeniable power. And if you fall over laughing at the sheer intensity of it all, so be it. There's something of that same giddiness with electro-punk Magas. James Marlon Magas and his wife run a store in Chicago called Weekend Records and Soap. They sell records, obviously: electro, microhouse, minimal techno, glitch, dub, and some other things-- records from labels like Bunker, Force Tracks, Bpitch Control, Warp, Mego, and Tigerbeat6. They also sell handmade soap. Magas also used to sing for no-wavey Chicago rockers Lake of Dracula, and he's got plenty of those horror-flick hesher tendencies wrapped up in his electro love: walk into Weekend, and you're likely to find him standing over a turntable half-banging his head to Luke Eargoggle or Electronicat, smiling in that kidlike way that metalheads smile when Reign in Blood is playing. He's the sort of guy who'll get awfully excited all of a sudden and say, pointing to the turntable, ""Wait, wait, wait, check out this part,"" at which point a German woman will shout something about a cat. Look back up at him and he's grinning and nodding enthusiastically. Which is pretty much the best way to approach Friends Forever, his first full-length on Adult.'s hesher-friendly electro label Ersatz Audio. (Adult.'s Adam Lee Miller co-produces here.) The quickest way of getting at it is like this: Magas often sounds like an electro version of rockabilly punk favorites The Cramps. I'd even be tempted to try out the term ""electrobilly"" if there were any chance that anyone but Magas (or Quintron) were likely to make a record like this in the future. There's nothing much danceable going on-- just the stiff and rhythmic crack and buzz of drum machines, rock 'n' roll analog blurts, and the synth-noise explorations of your more ""serious"" European electro. Nothing very dark, either, despite all the minor-key grinds and rock yowls: Magas, as you can hear almost immediately, is having loads of fun, as will some hopefully decent proportion of his listeners. You can hear it from the start, on ""Blind Contact"". A fuzzed-out synth does the rock 'n' roll bassline over a big wet snare drum, and then there's Magas with his deep, affected, Lux Interior/Jon Spencer sneer: ""We got the feeeel for the lux-jureeee, we got a taste for the gold!"" After only four lines: ""Lookout! Waaaaaah!"" And that's the program from there on out: something like Quintron, something like Adult. on goof-off day, all peculiarly and entertainingly Magas. It's devotedly minimal-- usually just a drum machine, synth bass, and upfront, untreated vocals-- and probably way too low on variation for most. It sounds best loud. It ""rocks"" at points, like on ""This Is How We Do It"" (""Woke up this morning, I was looking for a fight!"") and gets all sneery-funky at others, like on ""Pocket Racers"". It wanders through some more complex and traditional electro, like the synth workout ""Love Compressor""; it rewrites ""Toys"", from the Bad Blood EP; it breaks out the piano for the closing ""Too Much Fear"", and you can almost forgive Magas for using the same vocal line for the third or fourth time when he sings in the title in a growly demon-voice. When Friends Forever is working, it makes you chuckle and curl up your lip and sneer along: it's loveable and entertaining and sounds-- a rarity these days-- like people who don't take themselves too seriously having a good time making music. Which is lucky, because you need to be on Magas' side to forgive him for the record's being sort of slight: there aren't exactly a ton of different ideas being worked through here, and the ones that are aren't particularly complex to begin with. Much like metal-- and much like a good number of Ersatz releases-- this record will be a decent amount of fun for those who are ready for it, and sound, well, sort of stupid to everyone else.","Friends Forever isn't a metal record, but let's pause for a second anyway and give credit where credit ...

Radio Amor,Tim Hecker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19b13d1975652138687/1:1/w_160/0475ea96.jpg,2003-04-21 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3796-radio-amor/,Mille Plateaux,"Minimalism, as it is usually described, is precise music. Whether it's Steve Reich's phase patterns, Terry Riley's ""C"" pulse or La Monte Young's extended tones, classical minimalism is laid out as carefully as a math equation. Each note has its place; harmonic collisions are not left to chance. The sound is ordered. Minimalism is music for neat freaks. Tim Hecker's second proper full-length under his own name, following the underrated Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again (the My Love Is Rotten to the Core EP was an interesting diversion but not much more), approaches minimalism from a messier angle. Radio Amor's identifying motif is a repeated piano cluster. It is obviously minimalist in some respects, involving the repetition of a limited tone set, but something else is happening. Hecker's piano cluster sounds accidental and broken, the notes tumbling down haphazardly into a clump on the floor. Though each sound was likely laid out carefully in a window on Hecker's computer, you'd never know it. This sound idea is closer in spirit to the melody of wind chimes than something one hunches over a piano to work out, but it's no less striking for its seeming randomness. ""Song of the Highwire Shrimper"" introduces this fantastic sound. After some hissing and shortwave radio static, complete with unidentifiable voices, the keyboard bit comes in. I can't tell if it's a sample or just my own mind connecting two nautically themed records (Radio Amor was inspired in part by Hecker's observations in a Honduran fishing village), but something about the quality of the piano in ""Song of the Highwire Shrimper"" reminds me of Herbie Hancock's ""Maiden Voyage"". Where Hancock tapped into the fixed rhythm of the tide, Hecker zooms into the chaos present inside the breaking crest of a single wave. Listen closely and you can hear the endlessly variable gurgling of the ocean. Like Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again, Radio Amor flows one track into the next, and it really works best as one long piece. The choppy keyboard pattern drifts back into view several times. On ""Spectral"" it hovers around the corners of the frame, visible only when one turns attention away from the gradually shifting drones that make up the bulk of the track. Here, Hecker's technique reminds me a bit of Vert's sonic sleight-of-hand on The Köln Konzert, where he plucked tiny melodic phrases from Keith Jarrett's similarly named solo piano album and wrapped them in layers of prickly noise. ""I'm Transmitting Tonight"" is also based around the stuttering melodic figure, but the noise is shot through the tones, so the piano phrase becomes some poorly tuned static-ridden ghost of itself. The rest of Radio Amor floats by like an uneasy shipboard dream. Radio transmissions, which often serve as a seafarer's only human contact, come and go. Harmonic-rich drones morph into static and then return. White noise simulates the hiss of the ocean. Occasionally, as on ""Azure Azure"", Hecker incorporates guitar feedback and achieves something close to the raw grandeur that once made hometown pals Godspeed You Black Emperor! so great.

"Bitter, Bitter Weeks","Bitter, Bitter Weeks",by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c1c0084474cd0c00fb/1:1/w_160/990ae1d1.gif,2003-04-20 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/726-bitter-bitter-weeks/,My Pal God,"Brian McTear is known primarily as a producer, having manned the boards for Burning Brides, Mazarin, and a host of others, including orchestral indie popster Matt Pond PA, so his debut album as Bitter, Bitter Weeks comes as a bit of a shock. The same guy who's spent a career bricking and mortaring walls of sound for other musicians, it turns out, has a soft spot for the minimal, getting his strum on with almost no adornment over the course of a 35-minute long-player. This can be a perilous path-- stripping a bunch of songs bare and laying them out for the world exposes weak writing faster than anything, and too much consistency of texture quickly becomes boring-- but McTear demonstrates his engineer's ear with an attention to detail and variation that keeps things rolling pretty well. His songwriting doesn't exactly bring to mind Dylan in the basement, but he's got a knack for a melody, and as a lyricist he's certainly got a good internal editor; no cringeworthy stuff here. ""Sage"" kicks off the record abruptly with McTear's multitracked acoustics laying a bed of gothic fingerpicking and his distinctive, gritty tenor drawing forth lines about psychological discovery and ""learn[ing] how to love without your whole body."" ""Taking Pills"" adds a subtle steel guitar to the mix for textural variety, and several other songs employ such subdued measures to add more body to the music. ""Daylight Savings Is Over"" is contoured by a weird, high-pitched pinging, while McTear's strumming trades in drastic dynamics and details, in multitracked harmonies, exhausting walks through dirty streets. The closing pair of ""Still as a Stream"" and ""Water in the Basement"" each employ backing harmonies from cohorts including Matt Pond and Mazarin's Quentin Stoltzfus, while organs hum low in the rear of ""Still as a Stream"", building on the ancient feel of the guitar work. ""Water"" has more of a backporch feel, with lazily picked banjo and wandering harmonica weaving their way around McTear's steady strumming and powerful voice. The two best songs each resort to the fully unfleshed sound of McTear and his guitar, though each takes a markedly different path. ""You Paralyze My Heart"" is sparsely strummed and intensely intoned, with the opening line, ""Dear, I just want to say/ You paralyze my heart/ I feel like a thousand trucks all barreling/ Some loaded with sparks/ And some with gasoline."" Meanwhile, ""TN"" is a brisk acoustic pop tune, replete with casual ""hey hey hey's."" McTear outlines the storm and stress of relocating during a relationship, summing up his frustration with the lines, ""I wish I could hold my breath/ And it would cure this unrest."" Of course, given that this album is largely a one-man affair, there are moments where the excitement dims a bit, but it's remarkable how well McTear does keeping it interesting and engrossing. It's not going to win over anyone who can't stand these kinds of acoustic troubadours, but it'll light a small fire in most anyone who's into that sort of thing.","Brian McTear is known primarily as a producer, having manned the boards for Burning Brides, Mazarin, and a host of ...

Nichts Muss,Barbara Morgenstern,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3bcc0084474cd0c352e/1:1/w_160/6338e3df.jpg,2003-04-20 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5428-nichts-muss/,Monika,"Is it really possible to whisper in German? The language seems so naturally loud and boisterous that even intimate coos exchanged with my little Fraulein when I visited the country rang in my ears more as Sturm und Drang than pillow talk. Fricative whispers came out like menacing hisses, and pleasantries to ""have und gute nacht"" became jackbooted commands. That Barbara Morgenstern, by her voice alone, can find a supple middle ground that invokes neither a bondage-gear Heidi nor Nico in lederhosen on Nichts Muss speaks volumes about her sound sensibilities. She knows when to softly sing in Deutsch, when to slip into something a little more English for the internationally catchy choruses, and when to step back from the microphone and allow her piano playing to resonate. ""Aus Heiterem Himmel"" pongs and pops with a rattling beat and honeyed vox that has folks like Dntel, Tarwater, and Ellen Alien already sticking to it with their recent remixes. Her piano glitches in and out of focus with a church organ moving slowly into the foreground. That organ is present again on ""Nichts und Niemand"", alluding to yet another bilingual pop group dabbling with technology, Stereolab. Her commanding coo to ""come on, mooove"" is titillating and utterly convincing, as are the glowing pin-prick ticks of a beat that tickle the ears and pulse about her cool piano keys. For a techno-pop record, there are great expanses of the album that are stark and instrumental, warmed nicely by two stalwarts in the producers' chairs: Pole's Stefan Betke and Palais Schaumburg co-founder/ex-Orb collaborator Thomas Fehlmann. The German equivalent of having King Tubby and Jim O'Rourke manning the consoles, the two bring a nuanced clarity to the proceedings that is shockingly moderate and light. Avoiding the dense pulse of Fehlmann's microhouse work and the capacious crackles of Betke's more nominally recognized Pole persona, the two focus on keeping the beats both wispy and crispy, generally staying with simple percussive taps that give Morgenstern's supple voice and piano room to steal softly through the snow. Surrounding the echoed crackle that reflects both Eyes Wide Shut's minimalist plinks and the chilly austerity of the ECM back catalog on a track like ""Merci (Dass es Dich Gibt)"", Betke rattles out some metal clangs that create sparks against the other elements, a testament to his skills beyond mere dub isolation chambers. ""We're All Gonna Fucking Die"" is certainly less dramatic than its title would hint at, but it's the most rocking of the set, thanks to the attack of the guitar across the red lights of the beat. The dropping in of plucked nylon strings to the flickering rhythms of the title track is the finest merger of acoustic and digital since the Spanish flurry of Basement Jaxx's Remedy and funky banjo of fellow countrymen The Notwist-- and the track expands to epic proportions when guitar kicks out a wah-wah funk lick midway through with some teeny electro ticks. ""Reset"" is the most exquisite of the instrumental set, closing the album with the hiss of analog sizzle and an expansive, low-toned hover that takes full advantage of Betke's sound specialization, mixing in with gentle guitar figures. That, and the penultimate ""Gute Nacht"", encapsulate many sundry strands of Germany's electronic history: the glitch-pop format that Lali Puna and Neon Golden captured in miniature, the more abstract work of Morgenstern's two producers from the last two decades, and the electronic pastoral pleasures of Kraftwerk and Cluster that they all harken back to.","Is it really possible to whisper in German?

Sleeping with Ghosts,Placebo,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a094ea9e61561daa45ca/1:1/w_160/6ba61a5d.jpg,2003-04-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6326-sleeping-with-ghosts/,Astralwerks,"Last I checked, our puritanical country had yet to accept naked asses on CD covers: a glimpse of anything more than the proverbial carpenter's smile guaranteed the album an airbrushed Stateside reissue, a paper baggie, or a strategically applied sticker. Yet Placebo's latest gets away with an unobstructed view of female hindquarters, and I think I know why: see, the chick's dead. She's a ghost. You can see right through that ass! Sorry, I'm just fascinated by the logic of it. First, some art director (to be specific, one JB Mondino) figures that the title of Placebo's nostalgia-themed Sleeping with Ghosts requires literal visualization. He thus blesses us with one of the worst non-metal album covers of all time: a guy in artfully torn blue jeans making out with a semi-transparent Photoshopped nude. Then, U.S. retailers greenlight the etude on account of the girl being a specter. And to complete the circle of idiocy, here I am going on about it, instead of briefing you on the album's highs and lows. Fact is, there aren't that many. No peaks, no gorges, just a steady oscillation between adequate and inspired. Sleeping with Ghosts is a remarkably level collection of guitar pop, simultaneously less glammy and less pungent than Placebo's earlier stuff. It whooshes by on clockwork beats, precision guitarwork (their way with the dun-dun-dun-dun downstroke makes Interpol sound like a jam band) and purely decorative bits of dissonance. Yet, if not for some Britishisms and Brian Molko's endearingly bratty whine, this could have been Duncan Sheik. The album has two assured rockers (""The Bitter End"" and ""Plasticine""), two not-bad ballads (""I'll Be Yours"" and ""Centrefolds"") and even a great single called ""This Picture"", where Molko gets to call his departed lover ""forbidden snowflake"" and ""angelic fruitcake."" Which brings us to the genuinely bad news: in these days of stunted complacency on both sides of the Atlantic, it's hard to grumble against artists' newfound political focus. It's just that Molko might not be the ideal man for the job. He is, how you say, not very bright. That's rarely a problem with glam rockers-- leave them in a room with a tome of Faulkner and out comes Michael Stipe-- but the eruptions of schoolboy righteousness that dot Sleeping with Ghosts are skirting self-parody. The title song, marked by the abundant and irony-free use of the word ""soulmate,"" boasts a couplet worth reproducing here in full: ""This one world vision/ Turns us into compromise/ What good's religion/ When it's each other we despise?"" Take that, Pope! Globalization and consumerism get a more detailed lashing in ""Protect Me From What I Want"", an otherwise perfectly agreeable rave-up in 6/8. When not drilling the catchphrase into our brains, Molko dispenses such pearls as, ""Corporate America wakes/ Coffee Republic and cakes."" Which is a pity, because the distorted harmonica solo wailing away below this drivel is one of Placebo's best musical moments to date. Suddenly, the transparent form on the cover gains a meaning: Sleeping with Ghosts invites a conscious separation of form and content. It's dead but pretty but dead.","Last I checked, our puritanical country had yet to accept naked asses on CD covers: a glimpse of anything more ...

Hello Doctor,Gravy Train!!!!,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf9a5e6ef95969323414/1:1/w_160/ba99b5d7.jpg,2003-04-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3561-hello-doctor/,Kill Rock Stars,"John Waters' Pink Flamingos: At the end of one of the raunchiest non-porno films ever made, a coifed Divine chomps on a big hunk of dog shit, gleefully. It is a giant train wreck, grand and disgusting and compelling, and the pinnacle of 70s raunch. Stockhausen was close, but no cigar: an obese drag queen eating dog shit-- now that's pushing some boundaries. But should the stultifying actions of the mondo bizarro elite be resurrected? Oakland's Gravy Train!!!! seems to think so, along with a cache of nu-raunchers from East to West (all sporting hymen-chilling monikers such as ""Splitmewideopen"" and ""Fudgie & Fufu""). Gravy Train!!!! pay some kind of homage to their booty-bass predecessors J.J. Fad, tingling cowbell clad in pink spandex and lyrics executed with the baby sass of ladies eager to self-actualize. And then, like Divine, they desecrate all tangible boundaries of taste, demanding, ""Lemme see those titties bounce!"" over teen karaoke keyboards, supersonic cadences getting busy with Mad Magazine, and a weird innocence, which isn't easy when you consider this band's status as three ass-exposing hooches and a homo. They nasty, though, and they won't let you forget it. On ""Hella Nervous"", which is rapped surprisingly well (considering), the homegirl calling herself ""Chunx"" rhymes: ""Suckin' my muff like a vacuum cleaner/ She doesn't have the titty/ She doesn't have the ass/ She doesn't have the thick-ass Mexican thighs that I poss-ass."" On the instrumental ""Pussy Thrusts (Exercise Demo)"" (trend alert #2: fitness-related dance numbers), a beat only slightly less progressive than Parappa the Rapper's driving instruction demo is accompanied by instructions for a floor-humping dance move. On the whole, Hello Doctor's beats and synths operate on Las Vegas time: more is more, 'round the clock-- and the band gives it to us in blinding excess, three or four simultaneous melodies often trumped only by the absurdity of superfluous and misplaced drum fills. The Gravy Train!!!! M.O. isn't quite clear, other than the perpetual reminders that its members are ""filthy little slut[s]"" who ""like to take it in the mouth."" The lyrics tend to be vague assertions of maximum hoochietude, with occasionally funny moments. But it's certainly not great music. Actually, it's more akin to the soundtrack from Dig Dug at a minithin-friendly 190 bpm. But like Divine's glorious shit-eating grin, Gravy Train!!!! are quite the raunchy, gaping spectacle; its terribleness is trumped by its incredible disregard for human decency. Which makes it kinda funny.","John Waters' Pink Flamingos: At the end of one of the raunchiest non-porno films ever made, a coifed Divine chomps ...

Black Eyes,Black Eyes,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2df5e6ef95969320504/1:1/w_160/1d3d6da2.jpg,2003-04-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/757-black-eyes/,Dischord,"Black Eyes' live show is a confounding orb of energy: two drum kits, sometimes a third percussionist, two bassists, two vocalists, and a rotation of variable instruments. To the human eye, they're a funhouse of tiny, screaming singers twitching about with the herky-jerky motion of flipbook animation. They're a D.C. five-piece that sounds like ten (or at least moves like that many), and they promote an equally convulsive squawking of rhythmic, sometimes experimental and gauzy, dubby post-punk that sits on the same sonic fence as Savage Republic and Swell Maps. It's a spectacular, dizzying sight. But how do you properly capture this mélange of melodic chaos on disc without its accompanying visual imagery? Ian MacKaye, producer, opted to turn up the rhythm section, and flatten the vocals for equal footing. You know: Fugazi production. It works here, because Black Eyes tend towards similar dub-influenced genetics as the aforementioned Dischord patriarchs. It also works because the screeching/harping, high/low vocal interchange has major potential to be annoying/overpowering, were the vox any higher in the mix. With these production qualities, the band is just comfortably abrasive, snagging against the mix of bent-string guitars and strange, trebly percussive clamor. On ""Nine"", there's even a very Fugazi-like drum fade-in, as a wall of distorted guitars and warm, insurgent bass pluck out their natty incisions. Particularly great is the bombastic disco skronk of ""Speaking in Tongues"", where two shrieking, e.e. cummings-possessed vocalists duke it out in a scribbled disconnect: ""Some words if you use them too much lose all meaning/ Enough/ ENOUGH!"" Of course, it wouldn't be a good Dischord band if they didn't provide some sort of higher message, and Black Eyes' poetic commentary is particularly well-written. In ""Letter to Raoul Peck"", they sing voraciously, ""One-sided politics sell boring records 'cause your vision's too cloudy and our visions are clear."" Sounds like a thesis; though their vocals are anxious, the lyrics are delivered in cryptic, personal imagery rather than high-strung, broad polemic, and reference poets Langston Hughes and Derek Mahon. This is the case throughout the record. Racism, queer issues, slavery, and a general sensation of imprisonment permeate their words, which are apparently heavily influenced by modern and contemporary black male poets and filmmakers. ""A Pack of Wolves"", which excerpts a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa, delves into the psychosexual nature of rape, and in this context, perhaps comments on the fratboy element of rap-rock: ""What happens when fuck you I won't do what you tell me to/ Means that I will still fuck you/ Even when you tell me not to?"" These lines are tossed breathlessly among the friction of uncomfortably skittering bass and clicking beats. It implies not only a profound cultural disorder, but refreshes the new kind of creative, full, experimental hardcore.","Black Eyes' live show is a confounding orb of energy: two drum kits, sometimes a third percussionist, two\n\ bassists ...

Call and Response,Bangs,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b213d1975652138450/1:1/w_160/743e77ae.jpg,2003-04-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/545-call-and-response/,Kill Rock Stars,"Still heeding twelve year old echoes of that riotous manifesto, still ""grrls, grrls, grrls,"" women ushered to the front of the stage; still long on passion and short on technique, it's the Bangs. It's a familiar call and response, and every static chord or fossilized scream of empowerment proves it isn't the call that's changed, it's the reply: from the solidarity of ""Who's with me?"" to something more like ""Who cares?"" Unfocused, ""spirited"" energy has gotten feminist rock exactly nowhere since the long-gone days of Bikini Kill, and the Bangs are determined to remain part of the problem. Shouting works when no one's listening, but as soon as you've got people's attention, you'd better have something to say. Kathleen Hanna, Sleater-Kinney, and a more enlightened few already know that, but the Bangs-- runners-up in this feminist sweepstakes-- have yet to catch on. All that's left, evidently, is to ride the horse that brought or birthed them, pounding on the instruments until candy comes out, hacking the same ground in the ongoing saga for a Strong Female Rock-and-Role-Model. If there's one genre that fears change, it's plodding, monolithic power-punk, a mode the Bangs have down pat: from the opening grind of the title cut, it's clear they don't aspire to anything more than the riot-grrl hand-as-dealt. Maybe it runs in the family-- bassist Maggie Vail is after all the sister of former Bikini-Killer Tobi Vail-- or maybe they'd argue that there's merit to rehashing already well-hashed (and admittedly unresolved) problems in traditional fashion, playing loud, confrontational, hard-firing punk. If the latter is the case, I respectfully disagree: if ""We got art to make/ We got shit to learn,"" is Sarah Utter's cry (on ""New Scars""), why recycle artless, ham-fisted three-chord progressions as your backing track? There's got to be an underlying anger to pull off lines like, ""It's years of names and disrespect/ I won't shut up anymore""; drive can only take you so far before a dynamic shift is needed to sell the pitch. The blistering, arpeggiated buzz that contributes to ""Leave It Behind"", the bubblegum balladry of the unfortunately shallow ""Kinda Good"", and the less-is-more, sing-song breakdown on Call and Response's title track evidence at least some effort at creativity, but basically, the Bangs deliver their message exactly as you'd expect them to, chaining old songs to even older dances, all but ensuring these tunes are relegated to also-rans in a genre that, for the vast majority, was left by the wayside when it ran out of fuel. Having to sit through this obvious repackaging of legitimate concerns-- old ideas that in light of their derivative second-generation, continue to be relevant-- is like listening to highlights from someone's trip to Agony. Lots of listeners have yet to get a headache from beating their heads on the punk rock, demanding no more than the status quo, and in the Bangs' defense there's still urgency to feminist issues in music and the world at large. These girls are still getting the message out the only way they know how, but even to that end-- as meaning with a melody (of sorts)-- the Bangs aren't cutting it.","Still heeding twelve year old echoes of that riotous manifesto, still ""grrls, grrls, grrls,"" women ushered to the front of ...

The Smell of Our Own,The Hidden Cameras,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0d2abf31b7dc7156516/1:1/w_160/2870c989.jpg,2003-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3853-the-smell-of-our-own/,Rough Trade,"Whenever it was that daylight savings hit, I was talking to a few friends in a local red-carpeted gay bar while an unmotivated go-go dancer swiveled his hips to the jukebox beside him. It didn't matter if it was The Price Is Right theme or something by Erasure, he pointed at himself, the jukebox, anyone who looked at him, and then the sky. It was weird, and not nearly as spiritual as I'm making it sound. As go-go boy continued, someone next to me started talking about being really into golden showers, discussing the ways in which you could go about asking people to piss on you. At the time I never thought I'd be able to use this story of consensual erotic pissing as a lead-in to a record review, but on the warmest day of spring thus far, The Hidden Cameras made their way into my compact disc player, and just like that, Grecian goldsmiths of hammered gold and gold-enameling were everywhere a-peeing. Honestly, this pack of queer Canadians make pissing on your loved one a most holy and glorious of act deserving of its own special Hallmark greeting. Named in part after Michel Foucault's take on the panopticon, The Hidden Cameras began as the solo project of singer/songwriter Joel Gibb in 2001. Armed with a degree in semiotics and a parade of instruments including drum machine, acoustic and electric guitars, glockenspiel, bass, guiro, tambourine, church bells, jaw harp, and organ, he recorded a bunch of songs on his four-track and made them available locally on CD-Rs (a few of these compositions were released in February 2003 as Ecce Homo on Gibb's Evil Evil label). Now, a couple years later, the band members have multiplied like the world's population; Gibb has anywhere from three to eleven apostles assisting him in spreading the gospel from town to town. As a brief aside, I should recommend that you check them live, should they arrive locally: they take the stage along with masked go-go dancers, films, projected lyrics, cheerleaders, a choir, and all sorts if ribaldry. Folks stomp, slap, spin in a rock-opera-cum-passion-play. On The Smell of Our Own, the first LP for the full-membered group, The Hidden Cameras wrap deviancy in Polyphonic Spree packaging and AM-pop sheen. Similar in sound to The Magnetic Fields, The Tall Dwarfs, and the more orchestral moments of Belle & Sebastian, the album begins with strings, organ, and a flourish of harps and voices. The first track ""Golden Streams"" is road music, some uplifting John Cale sunburst; it's also the first of two songs dedicated to piss: ""The golden stone builds the golden road to heaven (held up high by golden streams of ice)."" The next song, ""Ban Marriage"", approaches matrimony like any good anarchist. It's a jubilant manifesto regarding fucking around while also being in love: ""I was late getting to church on the morning of my ceremony/ Stayed up too late the night before from fingering foreign dirty holes in the dark."" Gibbs goes on to deconstruct ""coupledom,"" and it's here that he makes a point shared by folks who see marriage as a bourgeois ideal regardless of sexual orientation; more importantly for the music fan in you, the tune's suspiciously similar to Belle & Sebastian's ""The State That I Am In"", a take on tying the knot amid a brother's coming out of the closet. On The Smell of Our Own, there are a number of moments for the highlight reel, and only a few plodding stinkers. ""A Miracle"" and ""Shame"" are pretty but tepid, and ""Day Is Dawning"" doesn't do much besides repeat the song's title. On the more positive side, ""Smells Like Happiness"" has a high-pitched ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" melody while the crew sings like a pack of Genets buggering away: ""Happiness has a smell I inhale like a drug... it is the smell of old cum on the rug."" Equally a triumph of catchy transgression, ""Boys of Melody"" sounds like ""I Started a Joke""-era Bee Gees, but here the brothers Gibb are accompanied by strings, a choir of angels, and stained bedsheets. Ahh, Spring! And springs! Though Gibb is completely obvious about the pleasure of fucking other guys, the sex goes beyond man-on-man action to that of any people enjoying fucking other people, just always ecstatically. The album's closer, ""The Man That I Am with My Man"", is initially about a couple's sexual ministrations, but by song's end, it's more about a communal eroticism: the multitudes act as brothers in bed, pronouns slip, and I imagine the whole world fucking. With an open approach to queer sexuality and radical politics, The Smell of Our Own offers an alternative to the saccharine teen spirit we're so used to sniffing. It's a sensual celebration of stinky, real-life sexuality.","Whenever it was that daylight savings hit, I was talking to a few friends in a local red-carpeted gay bar ...

In 2001, it sounded great ideas, unearthing what were once rival influences-- disco and punk-- and ushering them into a new era to co-exist as an indestructible art force you could finally dance to. And credit is due, of course, as they were among the progenitors of the genre. But the fact remains that, just two years later, it's become undiscernible from the pack. So maybe there's something energizing about distance. For their second full-length, MNML, core members Bob Doto, Daneil Mazone, and Julian Grefe (also of The Trans Megetti) sent each other tracks via post, writing long-distance songs from their homes in Boulder, Providence, and Philly, respectively. Long-distance relationships are nearly impossible to maintain, and long-distance bands echo the statistics: I'm guessing the survival and/or success ratio of these bands to be around 1 in 50. For the rest, the mail-order romance end in monotonous over-simplicity or blinding disconnect. But magically, MNML clicks in all the right, punky discotheque places, and it's love American style. S Process' rhythm section sends the dancepunk idiom flailing like a jackknifed truck of bricks. Where other low-slung hipsters bark angrily atop cold hi-hat beats, this trio softens any pointed angles with a smart emotionalism. Heavily rhythmic, electronic-smattered dance-pop numbers are the name of the game-- and when the instrumentals are short on arty hooks, the vocals are long on lilting melodies. It's a wise and balanced move, and it sends S Process just across the threshold into their own vista of elaborately composed tracks, sparkling with guitar, drums, programmed electronics, even actual pianos. Also, possibly thanks to producer Phil Ek, the rhythm section sounds hotter, fatter, and more driven than those of their counterparts, Rick Mitchell's basslines burning across the record with a fireball intensity. Sure, they're no Gang of Four, and their vocals don't sit stiffly at 90-degree angles. It's more like a fuzzy 45, bent and melting; more Craig Wedren than Indra Dunis. The band opts to reference Boy George before exposing its damaged goods. On MNML's best track, ""I'm a Cement Mixer/I Heart You"", vocalist Bob Doto chirps either ""Karma Karma Karma Chameleon"" or ""Come on, come on chameleon""; either way, it's executed with the enthusiasm and timbre of Lee Ranaldo's ""Hey Joni"" treatise, as decorated by a trembling orchestra of road-burning guitars and hi-hats sharp enough to cut through glass. And best of all, S Process never abandon their subtle combination of club-hot bass and warm, emotionally fertile vocals vice-versa. Even in the seething, rigid ""Spring Garden Drive-By"", in which Mazone sings, ""Function or fashion/ Fashion or fuck you... Six-finger Rick is the sickest boy in Providence!"" has a certain fiery-passionate twang about it, among its clipped beats and thumping bass breakdowns, leaving you to pray this is one long-distance relationship with staying power.","If S Process' 2001 release, More Me, had been released today, it'd be getting in line behind all the ...

Death of the Sun,Cul de Sac,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a121b1335d7bf169819f/1:1/w_160/d0cd9eba.gif,2003-04-16 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1685-death-of-the-sun/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"An instrumental band with a more or less rock setup can go in a few different directions. Some improvise, emphasizing interaction between players in a manner approximating jazz. Some focus on specific rock signifiers and exaggerate certain aspects. And then some go off to a more impressionistic place, manipulating texture and mood as if composing a score for a film. Cul de Sac is a restless, searching band that reimagines itself for each new project, so it's no surprise that they've dabbled in all these at one time or another. Here in 2003, with their new record Death of the Sun, Cul de Sac is firmly entrenched in the impressionistic mood-based sphere. This record finds them adding two new members-- John LeMaster on bass and violin and Jake Trussell on turntables and electronics-- and along with the sounds brought by them, guitarist and leader Glenn Jones is more freely experimenting; his hand spends about as much time on a mouse as it does a fretboard. In large part due to Jones' shifting interests, Death of the Sun is very much a product of the studio: old 78s are sampled and looped, odd drones that sound anything but live creep in and out, field recordings form the structural backbone. I'm sure they have a solid plan for taking this music on the road, but Death of the Sun doesn't sound like something made by getting four or five people together in a room. It sounds labored over, thought through, and pieced together very carefully. In addition to the electronic experimentation, the album is also very much a drummer's album, and Jonathan Proudman's consistently rich and nuanced playing could be described as the lead instrument. ""Bellevue Bridge"" is a track that started with a field recording Glen Jones made underneath a bridge near his hometown, and though the eerie sounds of cars passing overhead and water rippling below are intact, the percussion is what's most evocative. Alternating blocky mallet hits with shimmering cymbal washes, Proudman effectively conveys the menace and wonder one feels when visiting a strange childhood haunt. ""Turok, Son of Stone"" is even more percussion-heavy, with Proudman's tribal floor-tom patterns functioning somewhere on the level of Mickey Hart's score to Apocalypse Now, signaling the approach of something deadly. The moaning, wordless sound of a woman's voice ups the tension further. The best songs on Death of the Sun are the ones that are built around Cul de Sac's new interest in samples. ""Dust of Butterflies"" is assembled around a loop of an ancient 78 recording of a tune called ""Creole Love Call"", a haunting clump of sound that's difficult to place but whose emotional content is clear. The apparition of the sample's central riff, when doubled with a parallel violin line played by LeMaster, works against Jones' plucked nylon string guitar, bits of glitchy static, and Trussel's Melodica. ""Bamboo Rockets, Half Lost in Nothingness"" is mostly a feature for Jones' electric sitar work, but as he spins out a buzzing melody the sound of South American rainforest recordings flicker past, fixing the sound of the music in space. The closing ""I Remember Nothing More"" is the capper, a breathtaking piece built from a sample of an old Cajun 78, with a ghost of a woman's voice singing ""Salangadou"" along with Cul de Sac on guitar, bass and drums. There's an interesting story about how Glen Jones came across the record, but the liner notes tell it well enough. Suffice to say that Cul de Sac have built a stunning track around the woman singing from the crackly slab of shellac. Cul de Sac went out on a limb a bit with Death of the Sun, venturing into unfamiliar sampled-based electronic territory, where tracks are layered gradually over time. It could have been embarrassing. Instead, they've made one of their finest records.","An instrumental band with a more or less rock setup can go in a few different directions. Some improvise, emphasizing ...

Don't Want To Know You,Dwayne Sodahberk,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49a5e6ef959693208ec/1:1/w_160/fd8976c8.jpg,2003-04-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7309-dont-want-to-know-you/,Tigerbeat6,"Any goth kid that went to your high school, any pseudo-crusty punk who played out every hackneyed anti-authority cliché to the hilt, their attitude resounds in Don't Want To Know You's disintegrated beats, granular chunks of synthesizer and minimal drum programming, thrown out at the listener like a hot and stinky middle finger. Sodahberk must be listening to Home Invasion in his bedroom, though; the clanking hip-hop breaks and squelching bass that show up in the mix definitely belies the abrasive ethos of cuts like \x93Lagre (Long Play)\x94 or the white noise antisocialism that \x93Jax94 and the Oval-minded \x93Bunk Debris\x94-- originally on Sodahberk's a-noi-a CD-R-- subscribe to. The attitude is a front, and when Sodahberk puts himself out there, when he tries to mix with the gyrating sheep, he does his absolute best to please. If you hollowed out his brain and filled the cavity with sand, Daren Emerson might be swayed to work Don't Want To Know You into his next Global Underground mix; there's a whole colony of X-ed out party anthems to be found on the record, bound together by mathematically precise beats that nonetheless sit on fairly shaky terrain. The hypnotic shuffle of \x93Swichd Weg\x94 is crusted over with static and radio waste, plodding along with elephantine dedication toward the DJ booth. \x93Is OK\x94 is the epitome of this approach, a tribal house behemoth that doesn't lose the static interference, but drops a short chiming melody in the mix that can't be resisted. At all times, the sound is channeled through steel wool and fiberglass, shredded to microscopic bits, and it is to Sodahberk's credit that the tracks still retain their gritty thump. The hip-hop genes in effect are less pure, more akin to the abused structures of Plaid or the harsh dynamics of Techno Animal; the latter's Brotherhood of the Bomb LP is prime inspiration for \x93What I Can Do If You Don't Listex94, with its mountainous kicks and metallic frequencies, as well as the subterranean bassline that oozes its way into the core of \x93Participateur\x94, surrounded by drum loops that crumble under the woofer's mammoth weight. Smoother beats can be found on \x93Walk Me To The Corner\x94 and in the textured layers of the dancier \x93Devoiced\x94-- both with boom-bap backpacker kits-- or the slower tempos and rewound synth washes of the last cut, \x93Formerly\x94. They work equally well, separating the intentionally abrasive tracks from those that are able to retain their misanthropic attitude, while shamelessly reaching out for your ears. Dwayne even tries to win us over with a miserable warts-and-all acoustic ballad, but \x93Fuck You I'm Untouchable\x94 is a case being uncomfortably honest on the first date-- after all, it wasn't to long ago that our good buddy was carving \x93Fuck you, Fascist!\x94 on the principal's desk and starting fights with anyone in a sweater-vest. All is forgotten after Don't Want To Know You: the kids sit a little closer at lunch, wait for him outside of school in the morning.

In the Land of the Blind The One-Eyed Is King,Mika Vainio,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90bb1335d7bf1699418/1:1/w_160/515dd397.jpg,2003-04-16 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8391-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-is-king/,Touch,"When not turning entrails into milkshakes with the frequency fuckery of his full-time project Pan Sonic or performing clinical click/cut operations as either Ø or Philus, Mika Vainio has spent his time accumulating a curious catalog of sounds on the Touch imprint, be they of the curatorial art gallery background sort or the more frontal lobe-frying, barbed sinewaves sort. His fourth solo disc finds a kind of strange theme: sailors. Here he is, all dolled-up like a siren with a wig and fishnets, waylaying freshly shaved skippers on shore leave with a beguiling sound that's part good-time laughter, part throat gurgling, and part cheap-liquor retching, before he stoves their heads 20 seconds in with a savage blast of broken glass, roars, and machinations. If those Yankee recruits could only have read Finnish, they'd have known that the title ""Revi Täällä, Merimies"" actually translates to ""Sunder Here, Sailor"". ""It Is Existing"" breathes some back-alley gases through the lungs, seeping out an air of greasy haze over a slimy puddle underfoot. Once that clears up, Vainio turns his prey down a dark passage, chloroforming them again until all you can hear is their drugged, staggering heartbeats and the swaying neon of the red-light district. Coming to from the stupor, the sailors find themselves stripped clean, clanging against some oil barrels as they try to hide out on an opaque dock in a strange port town. ""He Was a Sound Sometimes"" drones pleasantly the first two minutes, before the record ends and a needle starts to slowly drag across the label, pulling the ears back down while gathering up dust as it loops itself. Vainio finally gets around to replacing it with a rare record of steamer engines, all surface noise and menacing hiss. Floating still on that boat, he wraps a scratchy wool pea coat tighter around the head before a tea kettle in the captain's quarters reaches a roiling boil, evaporating all that came before it. The blissful peak comes at the center of the record. ""Colour of Plants"" uses a gentle harmonium-hum as the starting strand of a relaxing sort of sea cruise, while Vainio assuredly gathers a gravity about it, stretching its salty breadth to encompass all available space, at the same time retaining its hypnotic state, the colors of the open sea glowing a ghostly blue iridescence that carries through the more land-locked tracks ""Streets"" and two-thirds of ""Motel"". But that's where the nightmares begin. Forgoing the nautical imaginings for the seedier side of noir, the end of ""Motel"" seethes with a menacing series of squeals before segueing into the drunken lurch of ""Snowblind"", which is just blottoed enough to hear the ozone gathering over the flickering TV static, all of it turning into an acid-reflux of hot mash, making the by-the-hour room spin and strobe. ""Further, Higher!"" finds us by the seaside for a split second, hearing the crashing waves before a low drum hit drops us back into the dank galley darkness, where the shanghaied sailors sleep. Small orchestral flames slowly cast a glow over the claustrophobic space, just catching the glint of a blade before it chops the disc to an end. More frequently than not, Vainio serves up a disarming fluctuation between the extremes of ambience and power noise, even changing horses midstream in the track if the mood takes him. A fine bodily hijacking that's neither too mellow nor too harsh.","When not turning entrails into milkshakes with the frequency fuckery of his full-time project Pan Sonic or\n\ performing clinical ...

Mouthfuls,Fruit Bats,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4beb335119a49ed03b/1:1/w_160/562b65a4.jpg,2003-04-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3228-mouthfuls/,Sub Pop,"In this age of file-sharing and do-it-yourself promos... woah, man, I just got the craziest feeling of déjà vu. No, seriously, I've got a real glitch-in-the-matrix thing going on here; I feel like I've been here before, reviewing this CD before, in this exact manner. Hmmm, Fruit Bats... I think Bowers once told me they were ""pleasant-is-the-new-subversive,"" but just who knows what that bent lunatic is ever on about? Well, let's run through the checklist on opening track, ""Rainbow Sign"". You got your folky-picked acoustic guitar riff, check. Your twangy, even though the singer is not from the South, vocals, check. By the end of the song the coffeehouse strumming is overtaken by plunky vibraphone and digitized percussion, check. So good have I gotten at this game, I can hide the liner notes, put on my pyramid hat, and figure out that Sub Pop is on the contract and Brian Deck is on the switches, giving the proceedings that Sleepy Hollow sound he specializes in. Wait a second, Sleepy Hollow, hollow, Holopaw! Mouthfuls is so similar to the eponymous release from this band's Gainesville-based label-cousins, they're harder to tell apart than Mary Kate and Ashley. Indie-folk with a slight taste for what some cultures would consider experimental (keyboards, machines, and the like), Fruit Bats sound like they've been cheating over Holopaw's shoulder on SAT day, right down to a lyrical obsession with Niagara Falls (Canada-side, I'm assuming). All of which you'd know I consider to be a considerably good thing, if you've been a good Forker and printed out my Holopaw review for your nightstand. Batman Eric Johnson has got a good ear for a classic melody, has overcome his fear of occasionally sounding like the Grateful Dead, and is willing to let Deck toss in enough gizmos to keep songs like ""A Bit of Wind"" (backwards guitars, horns) and ""Track Rabbits"" (mellotron, outer space ""La""-ing) from getting too evening-dull. Coming off their nostalgia-high debut, Echolocation, Fruit Bats seem to be further embracing modernity and sounding great doing it, even getting a little E6-poppy on ""Magic Hour"", which sounds like Beulah after laying off the horn section, or ""Union Blanket"", Olivia Tremor Control on an overdub diet, plus a hip-slap beat. And yet the rerun feeling pervades the entire album; admittedly unfair given that even our shiny new global economy could not allow Fruit Bats to rip off Holopaw this quickly. And besides, Fruit Bats even beat Holopaw to the punch; Echolocation was also produced by Deck, way back in 2000. In fact, it could be said that Holopaw actually stole their show from these guys, if a person was so inclined to make those kinds of assumptions. The question is: if I'd heard Mouthfuls before hearing Holopaw's record, would it have scored the 8 instead? And I think I can safely say ""no"" to that, since the Fruit Bats are lacking in their labelmates' sense of when to get out of a song-- too much of this record's second half celebrates meandering, like the interminable ""Lazy Eye"" and the two-line-mantra ""Slipping Through the Sensors"". Still, never have I been able to make a stronger RIYL about a band, and many flaunters of plaid shirts would appreciate the delicate girl-harmonies and banjo of ""Seaweed"" or slow-motion environmentalism of ""The Little Acorn"". I'm certainly not saying I don't want to drink a glass of red wine to it, but let purveyors of this musical brand take note that it's starting to bleed together in the wash. If this post-folk stuff doesn't watch out, A Mighty Wind II is gonna end up featuring Parker Posey as a relocated Southern gal who's too drunk to finish a song live and a thinly-veiled Tweedy figure portrayed by Fred Willard.","In this age of file-sharing and do-it-yourself promos... woah, man, I just got the craziest feeling of d\xE9j\xE0 ...

Red Snapper,Red Snapper,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a234ea9e61561daa49a5/1:1/w_160/7ca4df23.gif,2003-04-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6722-red-snapper/,Lo,"When Our Aim Is To Satisfy Red Snapper first met my ears, zonked and chilling at the end of a long college party, I remember being impressed by its very thickness; like a generous salmon steak, it was just dripping with juices natural and unnatural. Finally, someone got it together to play lounge electronica with a live band, I thought. The drummer had some real weight behind him, not to mention the lilt and swank to wear it with pride. The bassist and guitarist were credible musicians; on the whole, the record had a pleasingly large and consuming sound the first time through. But you cax92t eat the same steak twice, and that goes double when you're dealing with white fish. I learned the hard way when I pilfered a friend's copy of Our Aim Is To Satisfy-- the thickness was there just as I remembered it, but now it seemed slimy, oppressive, even abusive, covered in a thin film of its own aggressive self-impotence. Loop-happier than bottom-of-the-crate trance, but with an itchier sound-byte finger than the dustiest display-doomed house mix, this was no wellspring of musical ideas. Once in a while my head would start to nod, but the sheer repetitiveness lulled me to sleep before I could start tapping my foot. I woke up sweaty and paranoid, feeling violated. Gentleman, this is the kind of music you might get slapped for playing when you have a girl over. Ladies, it constitutes just cause. This latest self-titled album, on the other hand, is a totally different beast. It has no pretense of inertia, no shot at mediocrity, and in a just world, no chance of being back-ordered by even one pitiful Red Snapper completist. My ancestors have a word for this kind of artifact: dreck. Terseness not being one of my virtues, I see it as a pyramid of candle-thin pins just waiting to be toppled in slow motion by the spit-shined ebony sphere of my naked wit. This disc was made for trashing, readers, and I will do so with gusto, in an attempt to win back the dim sense of self-respect that the previous release has so thoroughly shattered in me. For the sake of concision, a poem inspired by the tracklisting: One is pretty messy, two is none too quick;
Three is housy-bouncy, and four is much too slick.
Five goes on forever, six is just dead weight;
Sevex92s name is \x93Odd Man Out\x94 but sucks as much as eight.
Nine is a nice live track, but dox92t listen to ten.
I'd rather die a gruesome death than hear this shit again. It's hard to say what's so offensive about the new album. In a way it's kind of like the difficulty victims of sexual assault have admitting that it wasx92t their fault-- if the problem was beyond your control, how can you ensure that it doesx92t happen again? There is ultimately nothing to distract you from the fact that these people have succeeded in doing with live instruments what even the most styrofoam DJ cannot: make dance music that appeals entirely to the dark side of the human spirit. I would be surprised if passive manipulation, sexual withdrawal, stony silence and possibly looting dox92t follow in the wake of this album. So if you have any say in the matter, I suggest seeking out a few minutes of old Red Snapper to inoculate you, and then staying the hell away. Just look what it did to me.","When Our Aim Is To Satisfy Red Snapper first met my ears, zonked and chilling at the end of a ...

"Cats of the Wild, Vol. 2",Swirlies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6145e6ef95969320c58/1:1/w_160/8086ee3c.gif,2003-04-14 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7674-cats-of-the-wild-vol-2/,Bubble Core,"The future of the past looks a lot cooler than the present. Where are the hover-cars and space colonies we were promised in 50s and 60s Futurist films and literature? Are TiVo and bagless vacuum cleaners the best we have to show for two centuries of industrial revolution? I dare say, reality has been greatly shown up by the imaginations of people who wrote and directed fifty years ago. We do have ways to access the future of the past today, though: Disney's Epcot Center is a huge, overpriced monument to unrealized technological ambition; goofball ""future music"" recordings by the likes of Perrey & Kingsley and Peter Thomas have been made available on compact disc (with modern mastering technology revealing limitations in the source tape, no less); and every utopian and cautionary sci-fi movie ever made is out on DVD, whether or not it deserves to be. We even have modern acts like Stereolab and The Swirlies, who insist that the future of the past actually did arrive, with their analog soundtracks to space station lounge scenes and meetings in edgeless, woodless buildings with minimal decor. The Swirlies weren't always so bent on retro-futurism, but the obsession was always present, whether as an undercurrent. With Cats of the Wild, Volume Two, however, the band members throw themselves into straight-up homage, despite that the lounge craze it would have sounded so tight in hung up its smoking jacket for good almost ten years ago. Cats of the Wild, Volume Two (there is no Volume One) is kind of The Swirlies' seventh album-- though it's actually more like a seven-song EP with 20 minutes of aimless noise tacked on at the end-- and it perfectly embodies the old vision of what the turn of the 21st Century was supposed to look like. The record swims in squiggling electronic noise and quasi-futuristic noisemaking, but like a string holding up an Ed Wood spaceship, its noisy, lo-fi sheen gives away its present-day creation. For all their playful experimentalism, The Swirlies remain, to this day, essentially a shoegazer band that strayed into a European electronics boutique. Longtime Swirly Damon Tutunjian keeps the lead mic to himself on each of these songs, but Swirlies old and new pop up all over the record to lend support; the liners list (almost illegibly) a total of 15 members playing on the album. That's a lot of Swirlies, and sometimes, it's apparent that too many cooks were crammed in the kitchen at once, as the instrumental clutter is often overwhelming. You still get some old-style blasts of Swirly goodness, though. That's Seana Carmody lending her fetching croon to the background of opener ""One Light Flashing I Love You"", the track's bright synth melodies floating above the overdriven beats and messy guitar parts like an olive in a martini, and sloppy guitar parts grinding against the facade while Tutunjian's faux-British accent strives to rise above it all. ""Le Bag"" is a slinky noir thriller strewn with percussive clutter and clean guitar chords bent in half by tremolo bars. And ""Sleepytime"" kills its melody with blasts of horrendous, tuneless distortion, yet somehow comes out all the better for it, despite bordering on being a bit overlong. Even with some choice moments, though, it's difficult to say that Cats of the Wild is really worth it for anyone but a true Swirlies devotee. And, of course, even they won't likely be listening to that aforementioned, ridiculously unnecessary (if aptly titled) 20-minute closer ""Cats of the Wild Forever"". 13 years into their indie rock career, The Swirlies still haven't topped their second full-length, 1993's fantastic Blonder Tongue Audio Baton. So maybe the future of the past doesn't look so great after all. If you need to reminisce on what might have been, there are better retro-future documents out there than this one.","The future of the past looks a lot cooler than the present.

The results of this hybridization have been documented as Daystar, an exhaustingly comprehensive case-study on the effects produced through blending a core structure of blissful shoegazing with just enough poppy bounce to make said shoes tap every now and again. On paper, it's a fascinating theory, but in practice it can't help but yield a little less than the sum of its parts; maybe someone should double-check the formula. In isolated instances, Lab Partners seem to have a brilliant grasp on the delicate science of crafting fuzzy drones for mopey kids, but brightening things up enough to keep people watching the skies instead of the floors. The preliminary results are decidedly positive. The sweet acoustic refrains and 60s pop harmonies of ""Gold"" are a strange and effective mixture of upbeat and bittersweet, and its jangly chords merge with the massive feedback theatrics that made space-rock famous on ""Those Things"". Beautifully strangled notes gasp for air through waves of feedback while the vocals glide just over top, clean and clear. It's lush, flowery music that easily lends itself to such lush, flowery description, and the early tests are a real success; however, in just two tracks, Lab Partners also inadvertently showcase the entire width and breadth of their powers. Like all good students of the scientific method, Lab Partners realize that these trials need to be performed again and again, to ensure the veracity of their output. That's when the trouble begins; the group sticks to a fairly rigid equation-- open small, build big, lather, rinse, and repeat-- and they rarely appear to be comfortable working outside of it. They mimic Galaxie 500 not only in sound, but in sheer constancy as well; the link is so omnipresent that for a few brief moments during the opening of ""After Hours"" I would have sworn up and down that I was listening to ""Strange"". Fortunately, overt comparisons aside, such heavy-handed influence peddling is rare; Lab Partners have seen farther because they usually just stand on the shoulders of giants, not because they've ripped them off. Still, by the time the album passes the 50-minute mark (and you realize there are still twenty more waiting in the wings), the sense of predictability becomes stifling. Occasionally, some outlying data crops up; the brief wall-of-psych on ""Riptide"", the minimalist echoes of ""Waves Keep Falling"", or even the blues-tinted, hard rock crunch of ""Magnify"" all fall out of step to mixed effect, but they're the exception to the rule. The bulk of Lab Partners' work seems content to reproduce prior effort, creating what feels like an abundance of filler. One sprawling, ten-minute epic falls well within standard tolerances (""Still Shine On""-- the title says it all); the second is just a more sensitive remix. It's hard to fault these guys for giving more than necessary, and as the padding on Daystar goes, it's relatively strong. Still, when Lab Partners begin to outdo themselves at the same songs on the same album, you'd be well advised to cut their funding.","If one was to combine Galaxie 500's ethereal fireworks and Spaceman 3's jammier tendencies with a taste of ...

Promise is sprinkled like birdseed throughout Great Aviaries, Super Numeri's blinding menagerie of instrumentation, which grounds itself in post-rock and percussive jazz. Each track presents a new twist on its predecessor, adding elements with bold confidence and at a patient, comfortable pace. Sitars, Victorian music boxes, and Doors-inspired organ all find their way into Super Numeri's tour van, which is already packing the legacy of Ninja Tune acts such as Cinematic Orchestra and Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra (whose complex instrumentals often offered respite from the labels highly evolved trip-jazz mission statement). The live band feel is inescapable, as electronics and studio trickery become window dressing for the tight interplay of the group. \x93The Ember Love\x94 and \x93Classic British Ponds\x94 easily build a bridge over the troubled waters between post-rock and cloying jam bands, fortifying their extended meanderings with a thick bottom end that ensures the noodling doesx92t overcome the beat. \x93Classic British Ponds\x94 swells as the percussion reaches a treacherous climax, then breaks over the simple bassline, which pulses into \x93Flaurent Carmix94, a hypnotic, echo-laden slice of warped funk that sounds like Osibisa fronted by Roger Waters, all in the throws of a dedicated hydrocodone binge. \x93Sundial\x94 carries the afro-beat torch as well, but allows it to roam wild and attack the speaker cabinets with bursts of shrieking guitar and squawking brass, sounding like the Philly Zoo during mating season, and the sloppy stop-start dust that \x93Beaks\x94 kicks up is a natural follow up. You could almost get away with saying it rocks, but you'd get laughed at for sure; a gentle trip like \x93Otter's Poll\x94-- draped with groggy harp and violin-- is a lot more Andrew Coleman than Andrew W.K.: the guitars get crazy, sure, but they never get up to 11. The strings that find their way into the commotion as bookends to \x93Sundial\x94 are stunning, and their presence on Great Aviaries resonates deeply. Super Numeri's Ninja Tune bio, credited to their landlord, makes much of the orchestral elements in effect on the album, and rightfully so. They are the cool satin sheets that the afternoon rehearsal funk of \x93The Ember Love\x94 rests on, the tranquil stream that winds through the wet summer air of the album's opener and first single, \x93The Electric Horse Gardex94, an impressive number that could easily sit beside Coldplay or Phish's quietest moments without breaking a Liverpudlian sweat. Used sparingly, the strings never overwhelm, content instead to simply bring a touch of majesty to the party. It's a seamless integration. With only eight songs on offer, Great Aviaries seems insufficient, sticking to a lower weight class when it could easily be taking on the big boys. Most of the pieces stand by their established modes for the duration, with little variation in mood or energy. You can be certain Super Numeri have some chops, and equally sure that their debut is holding something back. But they make up for their brevity with a number of excellent refurbishings of the Ninja Tune sound, pulling the soul of the samurai into their tea-shaded rock unit and working it ragged. If there's a safe bet in the newest Ninja generation, Super Numeri are it.","Great cover art, yeah?

The Handbag Memoirs,PAS/CAL,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a009ea9e61561daa448e/1:1/w_160/b5076af8.jpg,2003-04-14 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6188-the-handbag-memoirs/,Le Grand Magistery,"If I might uncharacteristically wax intellectual for a bit here, I'd like to start off with a short discussion about the symbolic character of the Motor City: Detroit, Michigan. For all the shit the D has taken over the years, it seems to be integrally representative of certain American trends through the ages, be it the mass exodus of the middle class to the suburbs, the collapse of industry and associated decay of the labor movement, or the cost-cutting decline of the once-proud Tigers (where have you gone, Chet Lemon?). Musically speaking it's been no less important, from Motown's rise paralleling the civil rights movement to the futuristic idealism amidst crumbling factories paradox intrinsic to techno. Now we find ourselves in third age of Detroit musical prominence, and depending on what kind of righteous mood you're in, the success of the White Stripes, Kid Rock, and Eminem is either an honoring or a pillaging of the city's black culture. Evidence for the latter is provided by the fact that the above notables, Eminem and his celluloid-dramatized trailer park (soon to be a thrill ride at Universal Studios) excepted, originate from the expansive Detroit suburbs, the endpoint of that 70s pale-face migration. If you're the kind to grant weight to back-story authenticity, there's little in the strip-mall continuum of Novi and Rochester to justify either blues-rock wailing or hip-hop indignation. So if there's one thing you can grant Pas/Cal-- natives of the burbs that would rather consider themselves satellites of highbrow Ann Arbor than empty Detroit-- it's that they aren't denying their identity. If we're embracing our mental tendencies to pigeonhole, the quartet is purveyors of that most whitest sound: slightly fey indie-pop. The boys of Pas/Cal don't want to be Robert Johnson or Run DMC, they want to be Stuart Murdoch, as their rumpled preppie wardrobe on the cover and the literary fonts suggest. Unashamed of their Brian Wilson fandom, they obligingly title the opening song on The Handbag Memoirs ""The Bronze Beached Boys"", and possibly naming themselves for mathematician Blaise Pascal doesn't do much to reduce their nerdy image. But like the Detroit suburbs themselves-- which could be swapped with commuter towns anywhere in the US without anyone noticing-- Pas/Cal's indie-pop never makes an impression deeper than any nice, pleasant, derivative music. The first half of this six-song EP-- each track bearing painfully bookish names like ""I Wanna Take You Out in Your Holiday Sweater""-- is full of capable sunny-day soundtracking with occasional quirks, like the brass breakdown of ""I'd Bet My Life That You Bet Your Life."" However, nothing suggests that these dapper dandies are anything more than big fans of Carl Newman's pre-Pornographers days in Zumpano. With a downward slide over the last half unloading the undercooked ""Grown Men Go Go"", the lost-without-a-map instrumental ""Marion/Miriam"" and the Beatles-by-numbers ""This Ain't For Everyone"", Pas/Cal can't sustain an EP shorter than a sitcom, suggesting a less-than-rosy career prognosis. It says something that their biggest attribute is their predictable, familiar character, and it bears mentioning that they don't even do the suburb-jam with as much energy as some of their regional compatriots (if I might name-drop for a second, I hereby plug The Little Band That Could've, the Red Shirt Brigade). It all begs the question of what's worse: staying within demographical lines and coming off dull, or donning the cloaks of cultural carpetbaggers to reap occasional rewards. In either case you're being sold second-hand goods, and although their selection is limited, the tributary Pas/Cal are at least up front about where they got them.","If I might uncharacteristically wax intellectual for a bit here, I'd like to start off with a short discussion ...

Theoretical Girls,Theoretical Girls,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a764b1335d7bf1699045/1:1/w_160/261e47eb.jpg,2003-04-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7987-theoretical-girls/,Acute,"For the past few weeks, I've had a crash course in No Wave: from CDR mixes to press packets, to an interview with the big daddy of it all, James Chance, I've been absolutely deluged in a movement all but kept secret on my own New York streets for over twenty years. The cherry on top is finally being able to hear this archival release of the Theoretical Girls, a band whose moniker treaded close to becoming an apt description of their turbid presence in the history books of the late 70s downtown scene. Hypothetically, what would a band featuring hundred guitar orchestrator Glenn Branca, visual artist Margaret De Wys, Sonic Youth producer/engineer Wharton Tiers, and theatre/dance composer Jeffrey Lohn sound like were they still in their mid-twenties, when the city was still up for grabs and there were many aspects of rock that had yet to be turned by their forefathers the Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, and the others? Surprisingly, they sound a lot more rock'n roll than their contemporary art credentials would lead you to surmise. And while the Glenn Branca reissue on Atavistic focused only on his singing contributions and the more avant leanings of the Girls, this set of songs descries the styling of Jeffrey Lohn, the more straightforward side of the group. Their theme song starts the disc off at full gallop, taking the thundering count-off numbers of the Ramones and stretching them to the limit, concentrating less on ideas and more on the mad tempo blast, straining to stay within the chords even as Tiers' drums thump relentlessly. ""Computer Dating"" foresees the advent of Nerve.com, and the faceless frenzy of the New York City hook-up infects every note of the song like a chancrous outbreak. Perhaps their closest contemporary at the time would be the Step Forward-era Fall, matching their raw rock non-production with the profuse, sneering verbiage of ""Europe Max,"" as well as embodying the lean, gleeful bounce from a few choice rhythmic elements, becoming the latter act's modus all the way through its Brix-era pop sensibilities. The unrefined keyboards of De Wys serve as link not only to the similarly primitive bleeps of pre-Eno Devo, but all the way through the spasmings of another Ohio group, Brainiac, nearly twenty years later. On ""Lovin in the Red,"" her organ's throbs act as contrary motion to the rest of the band, speeding and slowing defiant to the rhythms of the spiky guitar riffs of Branca and Lohn. The only track ever to see Carter-era light-- as the A-side of their lone single-- ""U.S. Millie"" runs together inane pop culture references to Howard Johnson hotel chains, Jews for Jesus pamphlets, yogurt health, and Scientology at a Taxi Driver pace, contorting the marquee barrage of Times Square through Lohn's catchy derisions and setting up the 3-card monte stand for Thurston Moore's street hustles circa Sister-era Sonic Youth. Equally powerful is the frustrated garage rage of ""No More Sex,"" grunting and steaming like the nastiest of '77 punk. ""Electronic Angie"" howls secret constellations of blackened bubblegum on subway platforms, illuminating the preordained patterns of sidewalk cracks and black tar asphalt. Real street gospel. Some of Lohn's experiments, like ""Keyboard Etude"" and ""Polytonal,"" are too short and unformed to be effective, especially in light of Branca's buzzing behemoths. ""Parlez-vous Francais"" works despite their tendencies to shout lyrics in French, but even as redundant tracks appear on the second half of the disc, songs like ""Theoretical Girls,"" ""Electronic Angie,"" and ""Chicita Bonita"" are high voltage and variegated enough to warrant revising those old No Wave maps, which right now only include DNA, Mars, Teenage Jesus, and the Contortions.","For the past few weeks, I've had a crash course in No Wave: from CDR mixes to press packets ...

Black Cabaret,Dinky,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98fc0084474cd0c2634/1:1/w_160/38e0f0ce.jpg,2003-04-13 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2321-black-cabaret/,Carpark,"Alejandra Iglesias (aka Dinky) is somewhere in Chile right now due to those meddling grups at the INS. You see, for some reason, they're under the impression that just because you weren't born here, you shouldn't have the right to DJ and record slick-ass odes to urban nightlife and the thrill of getting naked on the dancefloor. I think I heard she got married to an American guy, but even so, Immigration wouldn't let her travel for a couple of years, and jetset downtempo electro loses a lot when you remove the jetset part. So now, she has this CD that she can't really promote, which you're not likely to hear unless you go to the right NYC clubs. Tough break, huh? Dinky's stuff is well within your range if you're in any way enamored of (almost too) mellow electronic-pop, comfortably nudged somewhere between Boards of Canada, Röyksopp and the soundtrack to an 80s softcore Cinemax flick. She samples Madonna, but comes off like Björk on downers; she looks like one of the girls in the ""Addicted to Love"" video, but her beats are imported direct from Computer World; she calls it Black Cabaret, but it's obviously gray slink. It's a party record that never attempts to hide its melancholia, or else it's a bored record that can't cover up its casual air of sex. And sex does seem like an integral part of this record. Where you might think the output of one of NYC's up-and-coming DJ stars would be filled with dashing, trendy electro or some mutated, American form of garage or two-step, Dinky's stuff doesn't really even seem suited as much for dancing as it does for foreplay, and beyond. In a perfectly delegated world, she might be doing soundtracks for high-class porn, and have you bobbing your head while watching heads bob. ""Berlin Nights"" uses its vintage Korg DDD-1 drum track, subtly placed underneath two or three layers of synthesizer watercolor, and loops blond ambition to create the perfect Autobahn cruising track, to be played only when your top three buttons are undone, and the gin's dried up. This music sounds best when you want to be played. ""Mami"" lopes along with considerably less bravado. Where many of the other beats are straight-up showroom dummy precision, this one swings a tad on the loose side. Dinky colors the loop with congas and occasional deep bass, and the downward spiraling melody fragments that seem to pop up all over the record lend it genuine tenderness, which might also be interpreted as nostalgic emoting by anyone expecting fireworks. She never really delivers fireworks, per se-- the most active stuff is the low-key future funk of ""Frogz"", or the silly take on fast-food Americana, ""American Guy""-- but, unlike recent Björk, Black Cabaret is generally able to keep smooth eccentricity from veering into boundless mush (perhaps the Icelandic diva could take some pointers on minimalism here). Of course, if you're not prepared for a comedown, then you might pass this record up entirely. In a way, this music relies on the listener already having danced the night away, and assumes you're ready to fall into lethargic bliss. Dinky certainly knows how to lather up a room of slow-motion players, and if you can stand a bit of sensuality at the expense of outright grinding, Black Cabaret satisfies.","Alejandra Iglesias (aka Dinky) is somewhere in Chile right now due to those\n\ meddling grups at the INS.

Moldy Peaches 2000: Unreleased Cutz and Live Jamz,The Moldy Peaches,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38c69fc7814a47cd686/1:1/w_160/4c80bcfc.gif,2003-04-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5381-moldy-peaches-2000-unreleased-cutz-and-live-jamz/,Sanctuary,"Oh, the sheer wrongness of it. The Moldy Peaches, a mere album and single into a dubious career, have just released a 55-track double-CD compilation of-- and I'm loathe to repeat this-- ""unreleased cutz and live jamz."" In terms of business guile, it's the equivalent of the plushie outfits Kimya Dawson and Adam Green insist on wearing onstage: childish yet disturbing, and so monumentally idiotic that I find myself disarmed. Making fun of this album would require all the daring of a Christopher Guest mockumentary, but I'll try to avoid fish-in-a-barrel potshots. The bounty is unevenly divided into two CDs arranged in roughly chronological order, and some of these cutz are actually coverz, of the Grateful Dead, Spin Doctors and Hulk Hogan. Most originals show up twice, first as studio demos, then in live form. ""Steak for Chicken"", with its manifesto rhyme ""Who mistook the steak for chicken/ Who am I gonna stick my dick in,"" is a triple offender, but I suppose you could compare the 2001 and 2002 concert versions to track the band's growing familiarity with open chords. You know what? So much for the poker face-- give me that Glock; you're going down, Gilly. The barrel, it needs to be said, is even smaller than the fish: this is the so-called Antifolk scene, largely confined to NYC's Sidewalk Cafe and sprung from the mind of a man named Lach, who does their booking. He gets a soundbite here-- anyone who makes it to track 20 of Disc 1 is treated to ""Lach's Intro""-- and Sidewalk provides the setting for some of the live stuff. The entire scene is a bit of a sham; Antifolk is nothing more than an infantile fringe of acoustic punk-- imagine if the Violent Femmes' development halted at age 9 and not 13, and you get the picture. If Adam, Kimya and pals actually pitched their songcraft as a Bronx-cheer rebuttal to granola musings of Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky, things would quickly become interesting. But I'm afraid ""Bunny Foo Foo"" and ""Who's Got the Crack"" are not going to cut it. Folk deserves a better nemesis. As absurd as the mini-cult around the Moldy Peaches is (this album is your comeuppance, suckers), fuming at them is probably even more pointless. At their occasionally glimpsed best, the Peaches radiate a stunted, abused-kid vulnerability that makes one feel almost protective. Of course, if that's a put-on, they're evil geniuses after all. In fact, someone should investigate these guys, dropping a debut CD with the song ""NYC's Like A Graveyard"" on the second Tuesday in September 2001. It's wiser, however, to sentence these kids to time served: novelty acts that blow up to play Central Park Summerstage are usually fair game, but people who played it in lion suits in 95-degree weather have punished themselves enough.","Oh, the sheer wrongness of it.

Suns,Thuja,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a5ea9e61561daa5622/1:1/w_160/fc3de349.jpeg,2003-04-13 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8049-suns/,Emperor Jones,"People often say it's calming to listening to the sounds of nature, from weather-sounds to bird calls to the lumbering of animals across terrain. Everyone has their own reasons for this, but personally, I find it refreshing because none of it's my problem: I don't know why birds sing in the morning, or why a flock of flamingos know to turn around at the exact same time. If cats are fighting in an alley, or a couple of squirrels are chasing each other in pre-coital scurrying, it's not my problem. While every noise in nature connects to some fact or motive, to an outsider it's just meaningless activity, and it can fade into a peaceful buzzing. What's ultimately so pleasing about the sound of Thuja's latest record is the way that they emulate nature, both in the sound-- a wide-open, lo-fi shape, what you'd expect if you recorded a hike in the woods with a ten-dollar Dictaphone-- and in their performance, which like all their work is completely improvised. While their first two records approached the open feel of these recordings, neither of them follows the concept so rigidly as Suns; where their earlier pieces often picked up clear rhythms or patterns, everything here is fluid. Thuja stick unwaveringly to one tone, even to the point of blocking themselves. Free improvisation is often expected to take on a life of its own-- the interactions between players cause tension, creating drama, or in some other way producing spikes and arcs-- but Thuja often avoids engagement. Players will interact and then swiftly unlock for fear of getting each other worked up, and in these moments, any intensity swiftly dissolves. To generalize, sound sculptor Loren Chasse and pianist and keyboardist Rob Reger take the more environmental roles: the sampled noises of bird songs or unexplained thrashing, and the sheer size of the production play major parts in every piece, if for no other reason than because they make the recognizable instruments sound small and even incidental. That includes Reger, who fixes drones with sustained tones, and Steven R. Smith and Glenn Donaldson, who pluck and clang across the top. I won't try to identify all the instruments and percussion on this record, since even the normal plucking of stringed instruments (like the steady line on track five) can sound bizarre. The variety of noises-- a radio frequency hum, a quick percussion loop, the extreme garbled noises on track eight-- make the album sound mysterious. If you didn't look it up, you wouldn't even know how many people are on this record, but it's mainly the way they taped it that makes it feel so sprawling and unpredictable. Like a field recording, you get the sense that even when you stumble upon a conventional piece of music, the person holding the tape recorder could just wander off to check out something else. Take the different sections of track five, for example: the break halfway through sounds like someone just hit the \x93pause\x94 button, and we have no idea why. If I had to sum up the experience of listening to this record in one word, it would probably be \x93arbitrary\x94; like nature, it has its reasons and we don't need to know. Thuja stick to their tactics unrelentingly, and sustain interest with an album that seemingly has nothing human to communicate: no clear motivations, no shifts in mood, and ultimately, no information, just an endless stream of activity that's pleasing for its own sake. This is not, therefore, a record that you'll really love, or that'll hold your attention from end-to-end; you might like to look at a bunch of trees, but how often you do remember any one of them? That intangibility doesn't make this any less refreshing, however-- its faceless ambience is nearly as soothing as total silence.","People often say it\x92s calming to listening to the sounds of nature, from weather-sounds to bird calls to the ...

The Strangest Things,Longwave,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4ceb335119a49ece51/1:1/w_160/2e2971b4.jpg,2003-04-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4846-the-strangest-things/,RCA,"Last night, after adding a heavy dose of cardamom to my coffee, I tumbled into a psychedelic fit regarding those anemic shoegazing soul-searchers in Longwave. Though I was previously unable to ascertain exactly why this band is being hailed as ""visionary"" (amongst other hyperbolic nonsense) in the greater music press, or even what the band seems to be aiming for on a just being-a-band level, the hackneyed early Radiohead/U2 pseudo stylings of Longwave became less hermetically locked to me in this state. I got it. I got them. It was an unexpected revelation. I was momentarily able to look past Longwave's soporific dullness-- and my own ensuing boredom and anger regarding the band's meteoric rise to mediocrity-- to figure out why they needed to exist in 2003. Before I returned to reality, the blissful effects of the cardamom took me to Brandon, age 14, when I, a clueless skater with Flock-of-Seagulls hair, proudly brought an Ocean Blue cassette into school and showed it off to my comparative history teacher who was really into The Smiths. The following week-- barely time enough to absorb their powerful work!-- I couldn't understand why he thought they were so slight. Fuck me! Even as he explained his response by analyzing their weak lyrics, derivative sound, and cultural plundering in relation to Morrissey and his jangly guitar-toting sidekick, I thought, ""He just doesn't get it, the old goat."" In that frame of mind, Longwave rule. But more importantly: Longwave are The Ocean Blue for our new dark age. Longwave formed in 1999, ostensibly to carry a pale, whimpering torch for men with Brooklyn perms the world over. They even boast two ex-residents of Rochester-- Mike James, the wiry haired drummer, and Steve Schlitz, a singing valedictorian who opens his eyes and mouth as wide as Billie Joe as he belts out banalities (""Tidalwave"" actually sounds like Green Day's ""Good Riddance [Time of Your Life]"")-- performing a stiff simulation of rocking out in the mannequin-heavy video for ""Everywhere You Turn"". The most interesting thing about Longwave is that two of their members grew up working in the factories of Kodak, that great manufacturer of images. Surprisingly, The Strangest Things isn't their first album. After listening to it seven or eight times I guessed it was some kind of studio invention to cash in on the aesthetic numbness of the rock revival, but shockingly, such anesthetic college rock actually emerges from people with day jobs, too. It's like you're a young artist growing up away from the evils of the city and instinctively you make a series of advertisements for Absolut Vodka. I guess it happens? Longwave's first album, Endsongs, came out in 2000 on Luna Sea Records, an imprint started by the owner of New York City's Luna Lounge. There was also an EP, Day Sleeper, on Fenway, a self-released EP, and a bunch of RCA-related singles. Both Day Sleeper and the new album were recorded by Dave Fridmann at Tarbox Road Studio, who, despite helping to mold the sounds of The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev in the not-so-distant past, is slipping a bit these days, working with artless hacks like Ed Harcourt and Phantom Planet, presumably in the name of easy cheddar. I've tried my best not to judge Longwave on their connections to The Strokes. After all, it does make sense that if you tour with a band, they might help you secure a record deal. What's more troubling is that a posse of four with about the same rock 'n' roll power as The Dave Matthews Band could get passed off as even kind of important in some pretty major, supposedly insightful music publications (CMJ has lost all remaining credibility-- as if it had much left, I guess-- by awarding The Strangest Things album of the day. That's right: of the day. Sigh). Okay, the music. There was a moment during my first year at college that I ran into a bunch of people heavily into My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, Slowdive, Swervedriver, and other bands in stripped Gap t-shirts who fell into the general Shoegazing genre: mostly pasty English (or Anglophilic) guys and girls with bowl haircuts playing dreamy, droning feedback, singing whispery in the background. Musically, that's Longwave, though their vocals are mixed in a much higher, more radio-accessible style that reveals every flaw of the vague, melodramatic lyrics. The cascading guitars of ""Wake Me When It's Over"" plod into the single, ""Everywhere You Turn"", which is admittedly catchy, but sounds eerily similar to Mr. Mister's equally catchy diptych of ""Broken Wings"" and ""Kyrie"". It's destined to be a favorite at weddings everywhere. Even grandma kicks it, asking you if it's a Strokes B-side, as she gets drunk on table wine. Longwave's lyrics remind you that valedictorians are sometimes just booksmart. ""Exit"" boasts an image that might've shown up in Ethan Hawke's deliriously bad first novel The Hottest State: ""Little thing/ What are you going to do?/ I'm drawn into your big black pool/ It comes in waves, it comes in waves/ And the waves could pull me in."" The icier ""Meet Me at the Bottom"", also obsessed with orifices, finds Schlitz ""slipping through your every crack."" Yikes? Though cardamom hits fast (like an atom bomb!), the high doesn't last. When I jumped out of bed in the morning, reaching for my notebook, I was chagrined to realize that I hadn't written down a single thing during those spice-induced moments of clarity. Man oh man, doubly screwed! Not only was I embarrassed that a standard cooking spice took me on a strange Christmas Carol trip to my past, now I no longer understood the need for Longwave. I guess, really, I just always felt comfortable in my thinking that one Toad The Wet Sprocket was more than enough to fulfill a specific emotional and intellectual niche. Am I wrong?","Last night, after adding a heavy dose of cardamom to my coffee, I tumbled into a psychedelic fit regarding those ...

"'Up for the Down Stroke', 'Chocolate City' and 'Mothership Connection'",Parliament,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff99d034d5c69bf25df/1:1/w_160/cbf97b3c.gif,2003-04-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6175-up-for-the-down-stroke-chocolate-city-and-mothership-connection/,CasablancaCasablanca,"For all the myth surrounding Parliament, Funkadelic and George Clinton, the P-Funk mob rise to freaky fame and fortune in the mid-70s was less the result of cosmic slop than a long, hard road of bad deals and slim payoffs made only through relentless persistence. Clinton had been going at it with his doo-wop quartet The Parliaments since 1955, when he formed the vocal group to play school dances and rec center hops. He released his first single in 1958 (it bombed), and auditioned for Berry Gordy's Motown in 1962-- they didn't get signed. Clinton's one lucky break came when Gordy's wife hired him as a staff songwriter, and even then he was sacked when the Gordy pair split up. However, by the time of Clinton's unfortunate release, The Jackson 5 and Diana Ross recorded a couple of his songs, and he was able to produce some sessions for other artists in Detroit. By the mid-60s, during the day, Clinton was working at a barbershop, and going to Detroit on the weekends to gig with The Parliaments (by that point, adding a rhythm section). In the summer of 1967, the band released the single ""(I Wanna) Testify"" on Revilot, and it was their first hit: #20 Pop, #3 R&B.; ""Testify"" allowed them to quit their day jobs, and the group were soon headlining The Apollo Theater, and touring with rock acts like The Amboy Dukes and Mitch Ryder. But during the late 60s, Clinton had a falling out with the Revilot big-wigs, and the result was him dropping out of his recording contract and losing the rights to The Parliaments' name. Thus, the Funkadelic moniker was born, and in 1968, Clinton even flirted with the idea of his own label. At the same time, most of the band was experimenting with LSD, and was fascinated by psychedelic music (in particular, Clinton has heaped major praise on Sgt. Pepper). From that point, marking their 1968 signing to Detroit's Westbound Records, they would never again be seen as a straightforward R&B; band-- and certainly not as the modest doo-wop outfit first begun by Clinton more than a decade earlier. Fast-forward a few years to 1974: Funkadelic had established a modest fanbase in the R&B; community, and even a small cult of rock listeners. Their 1971 masterpiece Maggot Brain had brought to fruition everything promised by Jimi Hendrix in the 60s, and is still seen as one of the major releases of the decade. That said, Funkadelic was never a pop band, and when Clinton got the rights to The Parliaments' name back, he made a concerted effort to make that band (rechristened Parliament) a better fit for a wider audience. Up for the Down Stroke was the band's first LP after their rebirth (on the newly created Casablanca imprint, also home to Kiss, and later one of the most prominent disco labels), and was the dawn of a new sound for Clinton's band. Gone were guitar solo freakouts and reverb-drenched biological speculation. The new groove called for tighter arrangements and shorter tunes-- though hardly at the expense of the funk. In fact, Parliament's 70s records redefined funk music forever more, from mere party music to ""Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication."" Brothers and sisters, make way for the bomb. The title track from the 1974 record was the best example of the new Parliament sound: mid-tempo, hard disco-funk beat with tight horn charts (most likely played by Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and the Horny Horns, though none have ever been credited) and a tight, super-addictive vocal arrangement. Furthermore, new bassist William ""Bootsy"" Collins' massively elastic, muddified lines almost single-handedly made this stuff sound completely different than even concurrent Funkadelic releases like Let's Take It to the Stage. The writing trio of Clinton, Collins and keyboardist Bernie Worrell were responsible for most of P-Funk's greatest jams of the mid-to-late 70s, and Up for the Down Stroke was their invitation to the world to join the movement. Several old Parliaments remakes made their way onto the disc: the slinky version of ""(I Wanna) Testify"" distances itself from the original with big-footed drums, Worrell's sly clavinet, and disco horns. ""All Your Goodies Are Gone"" gets hazy vocal harmonies, late night, blues-y piano and some very tight drumming by the legendary Tiki Fullwood. The band had already been playing this tune for a few years on the road with Funkadelic, and along with the incredible, gospel-tinged ""Whatever Makes My Baby Feel Good"" (featuring Eddie Hazel's always acidic guitar) are songs that could well have appeared on Funkadelic LPs from the previous couple of years. If Up for the Down Stroke saw the band still clinging to the established P-Funk sound just a tad, the next two releases would make a b-line for the new stuff. 1975's Chocolate City (a tribute to Washington D.C., where Funkadelic had enjoyed their greatest popularity since the early 70s) wasted no time in presenting the new-sound Parliament. The title track is the first instance of what would be many classic extended tracks with narration: ""They still call it the White House, but that's a temporary condition""; ""To each his reach, and if I don't cop, it ain't mine to have, but I'll be reachin' for ya, because I love ya, C.C.""; ""What's happenin', black?""; ""GAMIN' ON YA!"" All this set to a simmering, pulsating track peppered with Maceo's (again uncredited) sax and Worrell's reckless piano and synth lines. ""Ride On"" busts out of the gate with a ridiculously massive Bootsy bassline and patented Parliament group singing. This tune may be the baddest jam on the record, and that's saying something when the engorged funk of ""Together"" and party anthem ""Big Footin'"" share space on its tracklist. ""I Misjudged You"" is Parliament's finest ballad, and sounds like a tribute to old-time vocal bands like the Chi-Lites, with the obvious exception of the general queasiness of the groove. Clinton bathes the mix in reverb and the beat is pure Fullwood grease. Even with ""sha-la-la-la's"" and a Muzak string arrangement the track can't escape its destiny as an herb-fueled, escapist torch song. Where the band falters is when it gives up groove altogether, as on the tedious ""Let Me Be"", with only Worrell's symphony of synthesizers, piano and some impassioned emoting that basically says ""leave me the fuck alone"". Of course, it's hard to find a lot of faults with a record so consistently on the verge of something huge. But then, the best was yet to come. Clinton urges listeners not to adjust their sets, and that he's taken control of the show-- you'll get your life back as soon as you're groovy. In other words, as soon as Mothership Connection has been in your life for approximately three seconds. In one fell swoop, Parliament's 1976 LP made good on every too-long vamp and nonsensical narration they'd ever dropped. The title track is the fruition of Chocolate City's ambition to mass cultural freakiness: Clinton's narration gives you the sci-fi backstory, but this time there's a message (""make my funk the P-Funk, I want my funk funked up"") and it's backed up by a #1 jam. When the band joins in on the first chorus, they will the cosmos into alignment, and all unfunky peoples of the world into instant 3-D submission. Mothership Connection was a massive R&B; hit and even produced a pop hit in ""Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)"". Parliament was nabbing major crossover exposure, but their status as sci-fi R&B; superstars was practically unmatched at the time. The title track offers one of the classic P-Funk refrains-- ""Swing low, sweet chariot, and let me ride""-- and the weirdly religious undertones in the music were reflected in the cultish image of the band and the feverish scenes of their concerts from the time. Clinton's obsession with concept (and somehow using the same musicians to make records for a dozen labels) would soon get the best of his quality control, but on Mothership Connection, all of the out-there shit came together. These three LPs detail the blueprint for pretty much every Clinton project henceforth, and though there are still some hot spots left (most notably 1977's Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo System), Parliament never really got better. The reissues are remastered, and include some (mostly inconsequential) bonus tracks, so if you were curious about the band before, now's your time to investigate. Those of you already on the train, next stop is C.C. so get your handcuffs ready: these jams won't get stepped on.","For all the myth surrounding Parliament, Funkadelic and George Clinton, the P-Funk mob rise to freaky fame and fortune in ...

He's been all about the Benjamins more than any of his fans would care to admit. He lives in a bank for Christ's sake! Prolific through the mid-90s, Richard D. James seems content now to frustrate fans with half-assed double-disc sets, blow ears with full-frequency acid-mashed DJ sets with the likes of Russell Haswell, and wow his closest mates with amazing tracks that might never leave his laptop. Today we are left with the scraps from his bygone days as a mischievous media icon, in a subdued pewter digipak containing two discs' worth of musical whoredom, as he remixes both the academic and the absurd with equal amounts of aplomb, pisstakes, and irreverence for the source material. That attitude helps it all go down, especially as he deals with the early 90s' alternative casualties of war. He reduces Curve's ""Falling Free"" to Toni Halliday's bare voice, rebuilding her as a siren calling amidst crashing acid throbs, and for years it has remained a watermark in James' remix repertoire. Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me"" stays surprisingly close to the original, adding a bit more percussion but keeping its 90s crunch crispy and intact. Similarly, he ratchets up St. Etienne's ""Your Voice My Head"" with some burping bass and metallic thumps, making the head nod. One hit wonders Jesus Jones have their forgotten ""Ones and Zeroes"" decimated to the point of grateful extinction, as not a scrap of their sound is audible over its six minutes. Instead, the Aphex Twin Hovercraft is in full regalia, all disembodied lucid dream formations hovering in haunted washes of dislocated drums. Most hilarious is what he does to millionaire simp Trent Reznor. Paid absurd amounts in an attempt to remix Nine Inch Nails and soup up his stuff with that Aphex action, James leaves the odious source tapes unheard on ""The Beauty of Being Numb Section B"", opting for something equally obnoxious. Meandering on the keyboards for the first half of the song, he then decides to blow through a straw uninterestedly and cut up some wide-mouthed yawns for the remainder. Not exactly a great track, but apropos for the wretched artist in question. ""At the Heart of It All"" is similarly lethargic and half-assed, sounding like he slowed ""Ventolin"" down to 16 RPM and then poured on some slowly heaving, molasses-thick brass. Not that the more highbrow and academic musicians get a reprieve from the caustic magic: Gavin Bryars' near-perfect minimalist piece, ""Sinking of the Titanic"", is drowned out by the droning of some well-heeled passengers on the boat, as loud metal drums slowly flood the mix and overtake it completely. While unmindful, it's a pleasant enough take on the composer. Less listenable is a track James spent a good deal of time tweaking, the ponderous Philip Glass orchestration of Bowie/Eno's ""Heroes"", furious in its velocity and swooping sound manipulations, with strings gnashing about as Bowie's melodramatic squawks buzz by. The beatless structure he creates is interesting, yet it remains a cold take that you won't be returning to. More interesting is how he manipulates the easy-listening marshmallows of Mike Flowers Pops' ""Debase"" and twists it into something closer to his own take on Candyland. Loving care is given to his mates, though. He takes stabs at no less than five artists on his Rephlex label, all to the most interesting results. The Gentle People's ""Journey"" is a Paradise of extended exotica, like Les Baxter and tiki huts out on the MIR Space Station, where the repeated reverberated refrain of ""We're taking you on a journey,"" becomes a veritable mantra. Kinesthesia's ""Triachus"" could almost be a Tom Waits remix, all junkyard clanging and dust-caked noises, with slow swells of synth breaking through the metal clunks. His remix of 808 State's acid classic ""Flow Coma"" even has a twisted hip-hop feel to it, wheeling forward and back, popping and snapping as he spins and halts the frequencies masterfully. Baby Ford's house track is similarly frenzied, which is not surprising, as they're two of his more recent efforts. In hindsight-- and listening to this release, in particular-- it's easy to see how Richard James recycles his own ideas in the various remixes and his own songs. At the same time as he was doing his Joyrex bangers, he was also jackhammering the tracks for Mescalinum United. Meat Beat Manifesto's remix could easily hail from I Care Because You Do. And the string sounds that he honed to a cerebellum-slicing edge for his Richard D. James Album get trial runs not only through the Gavin Bryars track, but also through the mercurial mashing of goth-rocker Phillip Boa's ""Deep in Velvet"", as well as the endearing remix of Thrill Jockey glitch resident Nobukazu Takemura's ""Let My Fish Loose"". More Beat than beat-oriented, he loops some acoustic bass with flute trills, all the while abducting Aki Tsuyuko's little girl voice and taking it to various locales: the bottom of a well, the middle of a stirring pit orchestra, out on a pastoral countryside, and down through the cavernous alien world of ring modulation, twisting her gentle frequencies into a nasty extreme that's at once cute and irritating. Most surprising of all is what he does with one of his old Selected Ambient Works tracks. ""SAW2 CD1 TRK 2"" was always a favorite of mine; a lonesome Ligeti-like lilt lost amid dark funhouse mirrors. Here it's restored to its original version, as once heard on the John Peel show, in which the ""ambient"" track is merely an eerie backdrop for a vicious acid workover. The drums bubble and hiss like gas escaped from slashing ginsu blades, building into a delicious bumping middle section. It's such a delirious pleasure that it makes me question that perhaps the entire two discs of Selected Ambient Works II might merely be clipped of their nasty beats, and thus presented as mere halves of their former selves. So what we're left with is a set that could have easily arrived back in '97, with little or no loss of quality. That frustrating gestation period aside, many of the tracks here are certified classics, and it's nice to have them all in one place, best approached in small doses. Dated, yes, but James' ahead-of-the-curve deposits are still accruing enough interest to serve as a polite introduction to his oeuvre.","Cash. Dosh. Dough. Ducats. Dollars. Green. Cream. Lucre.

6 Peace EP,Schneider TM,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37aea9e61561daa4ca8/1:1/w_160/d18c1393.jpg,2003-04-10 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7029-6-peace-ep/,Mute,"The IDM heads are all going pop. Jan Jelinek sings. Pole recruited a rapper for his next full-length. Mouse on Mars added the golden-voiced Dodo. Dan Snaith of Manitoba traded his MAX/MSP patches for ba-ba-ba's. Over the last three years, a lot of artists making abstract electronic music who previously nodded in the direction of pop took a page out of Eric Carmen's book and went all the way. And it's a good thing. It's good because this meeting offers another avenue to explore, not because pop songs are something every musician should strive for. There's a lot to be done with this place where experimental electronics and chaotic beats collide with pop music. If vocal IDM becomes its own subgenre and history remembers it, Schneider TM's year 2000 collaboration with KP.T Michigan on ""The Light 3000"", an inspired remake of The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", will surely be acknowledged as an early classic. What Schneider TM and KP.T Michigan did was to take a perfect song about a brief respite from loneliness and remove the respite part. Listening to The Smiths, I always imagined the narrator in ""There Is a Light"" picking up a telephone to call his friend at the beginning of the song, begging him to take them both to a place ""where there's music and there's people who are young and alive."" His home life is terrible, but experience has shown him that he can extricate himself, both physically and psychically, by hitting the town with his pal. Sure, he welcomes death while riding shotgun beneath the overpass during the chorus, but it's because he wants to die happy, not because life isn't worth living. And whatever happens, he is not alone. In ""The Light 3000"", on the other hand, I think the friend is imaginary. The way Schneider TM processes his voice, I believe in my heart that his request to ""take me out tonight"" could not possibly be answered. He's too different, too damaged, a mutant. The warm, glitchy beats are friendly enough, but the narrator is stuck at home, maybe forever. When the track first came to my attention in 2000, it became, for a time, a pretty hot download on Napster, and the image of thousands of people the world over hearing it over their PC speakers as they surfed the web into the wee hours reinforced for me just how painfully lonely ""The Light 3000"" really was. The inclusion of ""The Light 3000"" is the best reason to get this six-song EP, which is being released to coincide with Schneider TM's forthcoming tour with The Faint. The Binokular EP, where the song first appeared, came out on City Slang and never received a proper North American release. Another track from Binokular, ""Chotto Matte"", also appears here. ""Chotto Matte"" is okay, but I would have preferred the earlier EP's other vocal track, the feedback-laden and melodic ""Onnanoko"". The rest of the 6 Peace EP is filled out with the album version of ""Reality Check"" from last year's Zoomer, a solid, noisier, beat-heavy remix of same by Mogwai and David Jack (taken from the ""Reality Check"" 12-inch), and two remixes of ""Frogtoise"", which appeared on the 12-inch of the same name. ""Frogstears"" is the better of these. The simple arrangement, just acoustic guitar, some digital claps in the background, and Dirk Dresselhaus' voice, shows that it's a lovely song even without production accouterment. The harmonica fills (!) are a little much, but the song is so likeable it's easy to let Dirk have his Neil Young moment. There are videos of ""Reality Check"" and ""Frogtoise"" included, for those interested in that sort of thing, but really, this one is all about ""The Light 3000"". Everyone should hear it.","The IDM heads are all going pop. Jan Jelinek sings. Pole recruited a rapper for his next full-length. Mouse on ...

Anthology,The Clean,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1139d034d5c69bf2892/1:1/w_160/cef6f191.jpg,2003-04-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1494-anthology/,Merge,"If you drew a tree of New Zealand rock, The Clean would in all likelihood be the trunk. Resting on the roots of legendary Kiwi punks Enemy, The Clean debuted in 1978, and were instantly something of an oddity in their homeland, where the rock scene was dominated by bands covering American and British music. The Clean played only their own songs, and helped nurture a Kiwi scene that's accrued probably the best per capita ratio of great bands of any country in the world. Contrary to popular legend, The Clean's debut single ""Tally Ho"" wasn't the first release on the Flying Nun label (that honor goes to The Pin Group's ""Columbia"" single), but it was the release that changed music in New Zealand forever: with next to no resources behind it-- and coming off a recording budget of just $60 NZ-- the song landed in the New Zealand Top 20. By all rights, ""Tally Ho"" is a classic of immense proportions, from its Velcro melody, absurdly mixed garage organ and motorik beat, to the crusty, hiss-laden home eight-track recording that embodies it. From these gloriously humble beginnings, The Clean never pursued convention; they didn't even record a full-length until after reuniting in 1989, following a several-year hiatus. Even today, the band is intentionally an on-again/off-again concern for its constituent members Sir David Kilgour, Hamish Kilgour and Robert Scott, who each have numerous, constantly active projects. The Clean's personal, personnel and collaborative connections infest the New Zealand scene, including The Bats, The Great Unwashed, Bailter Space, The Chills, and The Gordons. For their years without a full-length, the band sprinkled a healthy sampling of EPs and seven-inches across their initial phase, and the first disc of this compilation focuses on that pre-break-up period. Aside from the roots of many a New Zealand band, you can also hear the seeds of Yo La Tengo (who have covered the band countless times, and also guested on their last album, Getaway), and various lo-fi factions of American indie rock. The bulk of their most widely praised release, the generically titled Compilation, is represented here, along with various scatterings from sundry singles, flexi-discs and live EPs, all arranged in something resembling chronological order. ""Thumbs Off"" is a brilliant blast of fuzz and amateurish harmony with a strong kinship to the Television Personalities, while ""Billy Two"" has whiffs of England's Swell Maps about it, and ""On Again/Off Again"" improbably nods to The Fall with its jumpy acoustic guitar and declamatory vocals; how much contact The Clean had with these bands is hard to say, but those comparisons should read as nothing but compliments. Resemblances aside, Disc One is stuffed with an embarrassment of riches, from organ-marinated pop gems like ""Whatever I Do, It's Right"" to pre-Clinic instrumentals ""At the Bottom"" and ""Scrap Music"", to say nothing of ""Point That Thing Somewhere Else"", a ragged-edged surf-punk gem containing one of David Kilgour's best guitar parts, a droning whir of delay and fuzz that hangs in the corners of the song like fluttering cobwebs in a breezy room. The band's early days are left behind for the higher-fi post-reunion output on Disc Two, which features tracks from Vehicle, Modern Rock, and Unknown Country, as well as four incredibly rare songs pulled off of a US-only seven-inch and a flexi included with Modern Rock's early pressings. The band didn't alter their sound so much as expand it in the 90s, deepening the production and, of course, focusing on albums for the first time. While these recordings are generally less revered, there's plenty to rival the immediacy of classics like ""The Fish"" and ""Slug Song"": the second disc is just as strong as the first. The seven tracks from Vehicle sound confident, and show the band coming back together in fine form, with all three members taking vocal turns and pulling in experience from their various other bands. ""Drawing to a Hole"" kicks things off with a huge wall of jangle and everyman vocals built to infect your brain, and David Kilgour's guitar puts on pounds everywhere, spilling leads and chaotic scrawl all over every song in a joyous celebration of rock and roll noise. ""Diamond Shine"" is uncharacteristically tight and fast for The Clean, almost foreshadowing Britpop, of all things. Modern Rock dove back under the fuzz a bit, and feels closer to the band's early material than any of their other latter-day work; the selections from that album are highlighted by the excellent, organ-painted ""Secret Place"", which features distant-sounding drums and a quivering piano lead that's likely to catch anyone hearing it for the first time well off-guard. By the time Unknown Country dropped in 1996, the band were reaching into new, more East Asian-influenced textures, as evidenced by the drifting ""Wipe Me, I'm Lucky"", with its backward cymbals and stream-of-consciousness guitar melody. ""Franz Kafka at the Zoo"" bobs along on echoing keyboards, sporting whispered vocals and a vaguely ambient aesthetic that immediately sets it off from its counterparts, including the music-box piano sing-along ""Clutch"", a head-on collision of The Who's Tommy and the Beach Boys in Syd Barrett's brain. Then there's ""Balkans"", an instrumental that draws on Eastern European dances and harmonies for a satisfying foray into something completely different. ""Twist Top"" closes the set out with spry rhythms and the rallying cry, ""Three million people can be wrong,"" leaving things in high spirits two hours and 46 songs after the first disc began. The only release in the Clean canon not represented is 2001's excellent Getaway, which is still widely available for anyone interested. Though not totally comprehensive, at two hours and 46 songs Anthology is hugely inclusive and utterly worth your time, a definitive view of one of the greatest bands of the last two decades, compiling a wealth of their very best material.","If you drew a tree of New Zealand rock, The Clean would in all likelihood be the trunk.

Listen & Learn,Hexstatic,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c913d197565213bac7/1:1/w_160/e71b9608.gif,2003-04-10 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3845-listen-learn/,Ninja Tune,"Right now, I'm lying on my stomach on a dusty blue carpet, sniffing at my record crates like The Naked Chef whipped them up just for me (\x93it's got a sort of, of, sort of luffly spicy flavah. It's top, innit?\x94); touch typing instructional records snuggle up against Hancock and Wonder, lean lazily on acapella 12-inches by Salt x92 Peppa and the soundtrack to Willy Wonka. There is no limit to the unexpected juxtapositions to be found in the dollar bin of basement record shops, a sprawling garden of fresh and waxy ingredients. Ringwear be damned. Hexstatic seem to understand this. Usually the A/V specialists of Ninja Tune's Muppet-jazz empire, Listen and Learn is their contribution to the Solid Steel mix series, an excursion that is equal parts label sampler/primer and crate-digger's purging session. Pitting their taste for relaxed electronica against vintage vinyl cuts and oft-sampled breaks, Hexstatic are at their most playful and least inhibited, a throwback to the energetic days of Funkjazzical Tricknology and DJ Food's Jazz Brakes series. Everything gets thrown on the wheels of steel (and in some cases, the CD mixer), licked and glued to the forehead of Ike and Tina Turner's \x93Funky Mule\x94, stapled to the spacey buttocks of \x93Aquarius\x94 by Boards of Canada (one of their best); the interludes are crammed so full of sound bites-- Charlie Brown, Queen, Rock the House-era Will Smith, Twisted Sister and Boogie Nights in the space of 45 seconds on \x93Solid Steel Rock School\x94-- it's like a vinyl trainspotter's lonely wet dream, a perpetual flea market of sound. The mood is sedate and chilled throughout. Only occasionally do Hexstatic break a sweat and drop an up-tempo beat like the accelerated funk and bass edit of \x93Mr. Scruff's Ninja Tune Megamix\x94 that crops up early on, sneaking it into bed with a tasty loop of Dawn Penx92s \x93No No No\x94 before the mix settles into its creamy funk midsection. It's a nice exhibition of restraint, adding just enough adrenaline (and porno samples, natch) to keep things moving smoothly. This contrast brings out the hazy sunshine in slow burners such as \x93Easy Thing To Do\x94, an indelible vocal track by Shirley Bassey that unravels sweetly until the scratch-fest \x93Daily Intake\x94 steals the ball and runs with it into the old school hip-hop end zone, post-partying to Young MC's \x93Know How\x94. Listen and Learn never really falters or hits a rough spot, although the inclusion of \x93The Message\x94 suggests a lack of inspiration, a predictable choice that nevertheless melds well with its freewheeling lead-in, the very alliterative \x93Solid Steel Scratch School\x94 interlude. But it's not a mix to remember either, more a tasty party snack than anything else, delicious and cheesy and without much resonance. Hexstatic probably wox92t stress on this point too much; their game plan is to get the asses shaking, the drunks jumpix92, the feet tapping. If the CD could put a lampshade on its head and grab your girlfriend's ass, it probably would: they're aiming for a thinking max92s spring break essential, and they achieve that with Listen and Learn.","Right now, I\x92m lying on my stomach on a dusty blue carpet, sniffing at my record crates like The ...

Live,Soledad Brothers,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0efea9e61561daa4691/1:1/w_160/36013052.jpg,2003-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7321-live/,Dim Mak,"Oh Lord, you know I don't ask for much, but please just do this one thing for me: please, please, please don't let the breakthrough success of The White Stripes lead to a blues revival. Now, old blues I can handle, even if it doesn't particularly do it for me-- I file classic blues fanaticism alongside bisexuality and sportscars in the ""things I'll never understand, but cautiously respect"" column-- but the phenomenon of nu-blues, embodied by the likes of The Soledad Brothers, is an evil worse than hair metal. The thing is, The White Stripes themselves are accessories to this crime: The Soledad Brothers are known affiliates of the White syndicate. While the blues might be just as much of a conceptual jumping off point for Jack & Meg as their peppermint clothes (\xA9DiCrescenzo, 2003), it's their deviations from the strict blues formula that bought them walk-in humidors, like the fuzzy Buzzcocks emulation of ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" (\xA9Ott, 2002). The Stripes might show proper reverence for the titans of the genre, but it's funny how their true ancestral excitement always seems to bleed through on covers of decidedly non-blues names like Dylan, Parton, and Bacharach, while ""Ball and Biscuit"" remains the lamest dog on Elephant. Soledad Brothers, as shown by their creatively titled live album Live, have never broken free of the strict adherence to the equation Rules = Authenticity = Good. With a singer/guitarist who has-- again, creatively-- named himself Johnnie Walker, the trio rarely deviates from the twelve-bar script or the riff-trance blueprint. From this Toledo-based group's opening ""aight, y'all"", it's clear that Soledad Brothers are more than happy to hijack the Southern culture they've read about in books to cover up their suburban upbringing. From the one-chord-and-harmonica rumble of ""Stand Up""-- sounding like ""I Want Candy"" with even worse lyrics (""Stand up! Stand up!"")-- to the hey-I-can-play-with-a-beer-bottle slide of ""Break Em' On Down"", it's clear this band have zero to add to the blues vocabulary: they're subtracting. ""Walker"" can't get enough of putting himself in rustic-gospel scenarios (""Johnny's Death Letter""), but his thin voice has none of the character necessary to pull off this grizzled act, instead coming off like karaoke George Thorogood. Sure, in a live setting the band is able to get a sweatier sound than they've so far tapped in studio, but it's not enough, leaving me and the ten people present the night they recorded the album cold. Later, it's made clear by ""Teenage Heart Attack"" that the Soledad Brothers first heard blues the same way all us crackers did: 'cause the Rolling Stones used to play it. ""Teenage Heart Attack"" swipes the Stones' taste for S&M; lyrics and a couple riffs from Exile on Main Street, but with a limp tone and lacking that Jaggerian caterwaul, it comes out sounding like those British ""greats"" Deep Purple. When they reach their grubby hands further back to a cover of ""Goin' Back to Memphis"", they only sound more ridiculous, the refrain ""well, I'm going back to Memphis on Highway 61"" failing to obscure the fact that, nowadays, they'd be taking I-57. ""Up Jumped the Devil"" may finally be able to sustain a certain level of gritty swagger, but even the lamest bar bands strike gold on occasion. And these days, when there's pedestrian saloon blues for cheap-- from sterilized Memphis, to Goofy's Blooze Shack in Disneyworld-- I see no reason to release this mediocrity on a national level. Jack White endorsement or no, Soledad Brothers are just the home version of that shitty band you're trying to ignore down at the local dive, and pumping through your stereo speakers, there's not even $1 PBRs to take the edge off.","Oh Lord, you know I don't ask for much, but please just do this one thing for me: please ...

Dead Hills,Wolf Eyes,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa675e6ef9596932159d/1:1/w_160/9249dfbb.gif,2003-04-09 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8729-dead-hills/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Dennis Cooper's novel My Loose Thread opens with a high school student named Larry seated in a parked car at dusk, on a hill overlooking his town. With him is the nameless boy he's recently been hired to kill by Gilman Crowe, a senior with a fake Neo-Nazi streak. The boy finds all sorts of aesthetic and emotional pleasure in watching people in the town below turn their lights on one by one as they realize it's getting dark. The distant and depersonalized movements become the patterns in a non-pictorial language: a flash here and a flash there. He does a similar thing with stars. As Larry says, ""When you imagine the stars are a far away, upside-down city at night they seem more important."" Larry later realizes, when reading the boy's notebook, that he just can't carry out the deed. As a reader of the novel, you get second-hand information about what's covered in the journal, but Cooper avoids offering too much about how the boy went about it or where his language took him. The aura of the unknown remains intact. Wolf Eyes' latest is the aural equivalent of Cooper's aforementioned scene, another bold bit in the band's steady onslaught of material. Listening to Dead Hills, I saw Larry and the boy falling apart to AM radio hiss, barely recognizing the patterns around them, nonetheless sensing something sinking into and altering their emotional states. Current 93 channeled a similarly pre-lingual world of death and sex through their feedback, but where David Tibet evokes the haunting pre-Surrealist imagery of Lautréamont, Wolf Eyes act as the equivalent of three horror-obsessed punks in a forest, destroying a house by fire, watching their own homemade pitch-shifters burn and sing. Since getting their start in the cassette underground in 1997, Wolf Eyes have produced over 40 releases, each archiving a beautifully troubling practice. With an approach to music akin to Vienna Actionism or a second-generation snuff film, Wolf Eyes bleed analog, mark their territory with piss, and shout all crazed over layers of sirens and random pulses. Aaron Diloway (Hanson Records), John Olson (American Tapes), and Nate Young (who builds much of Wolf Eyes' equipment) are Ann Arbor, Michigan's most interesting band, and the town's most explosive assault on regularity since Negative Approach busted up in 1984, or perhaps since John Brannon's post-Negative Approach act Laughing Hyenas hit their peak around 1990. The title track from Dead Hills is its most impressive piece, launching from Colecovision explosions into tape loops running backwards before high-pitched rattling creaks like rusted gates over a stock horror film ding-dong effect, one of those incidental noises intended to signify that the person on screen should duck or run. It's equally reminiscent of suburban decay, conveying images of a pained girl drinking whiskey in a quilt-covered bed, hearts on her wall, a stuffed animal squirrel at her side, and a screaming wolf stenciled onto her headboard per Sue de Beer's Hans und Grete. In eleven minutes, ""Dead Hills"" shifts from tired video game rolls into rabid bugs and the screams of wounded animals. By song's end the shit has really hit the fan: a tempest of hijacked past-future laser guns run amok (and if you look closely to stage right you can spot Merzbow dancing with eyes closed-- he looks happy!). Like a nature recording of a forest in which each object has a contact microphone duct taped to its back, the agonizing, detailed noises define the lives of snowflakes' voices, screaming as they melt on the asphalt. The next two seances-- ""Dead Hills 2"" and ""Rotten Tropics""-- are more percussive, and kind of slinky, relying on overt shouts from their human singer to make their point. Unfortunately, the mystery of the first ""Dead Hills"" becomes a Big Black loop, like David Yow keeping apace with Cock E.S.P. But trying to find concrete musical analogies for the Wolf Eyes magic-- especially after being so fucking blown away by ""Dead Hills""-- is unfair, and a bit of a letdown. The songs aren't weak, but they've already shown us what was written in the book. Never do that; keep shit hidden. Relegating the record to more obvious categorization, the entire offering seem less heroic and more human for its epilogue. Despite this last-minute fall from the sublime, Dead Hills' 24 minutes are a briefly frightening fragment, a churning mass in the continually evolving oeuvre of one of the underground's most important tweaked-out bands. Outside any historical context, it force-feeds you, one by one, the screeching souls of those crickets you tortured as a kid.","Dennis Cooper's novel My Loose Thread opens with a high school student named Larry seated in a parked\n ...

Kopernik,Kopernik,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf0abf31b7dc7155be4/1:1/w_160/da0ba1fb.gif,2003-04-09 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4515-kopernik/,Eastern Developments,"Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs... So begins Sidney Lanier's epic poem The Marshes of Glynn, with a lush and transcendent streak of southern naturalism. It's the same feeling I get when I cue up Kopernik's self-titled first album, put out by Scott Herrex92s home-spun Eastern Developments label. The duo-- Tim DeLaney and Brad Lewis-- are a center of gravity that started warping space as the pop-ambient duo The Sight-Seers, as in Delarosa and Asora's Crush the Sight-Seers EP (Delaney's thick upright tone will be familiar to those whose heads have nodded to Savath and Savalis). A late track called \x93The Sea and the Marsh Are One\x94 is based on a symphonic version of Lanier's poem, which is an ode to the aquatic splendors of Georgia. In fact, the whole album comes off like the soundtrack for an apocalyptic riverboat cruise. No need for alarm, folks; these boys are natives of Decatur, Georgia. First a shimmering pool opens up in mid-deck, and steady pulses of backwards piano ripple out into a mournful pizzicato bass. When the bowing starts, it occurs to me that I'm listening to the product of many late-night layers and reversals, waves of addition and subtraction that leave the source material long since dissolved. I later learn that Brad Lewis calls the process \x93crushing\x94. ""The pieces are slowly built-up off of my initial abstracts,\x94 says Lewis on his website. \x93Tim comes in and adds new melodies, chord stacks and strong but supple bass lines to the original themes and phrases. Finally, after adding a few highlights and accents, we both step back and strip the piece down in layers, sometimes revealing new simpler and chance discoveries...\x94 A single chord sways in and out, and a half-cadence rises in what even the first time around is obviously The Moment, like an old max92s pupil dilating fully at the moment of his death, the foam of hope on a current of despair. Lanier drives us on: Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves, Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves... Suddenly I realize that without the help of attack or envelope, a backwards piano sounds a hell of a lot like a clarinet. The improv bass figures seem to know where the ethereal synth-cloud is headed; is the bass really leading, or just following in reverse? I stop wondering when a twangy 12/8 figure pushes its own dopey heat into a fretless-bass solo; skittish strings and a curt, chimpy lament lead into a lavish Mediterranean experiment that for the first time seems composed rather than found. Then \x93Kopernistax94 flings us out into the savage Central Asian plain, with crackly electronics sucking at struck bass fifths as at a wild yak's teat. A sustained dirge opens on a weathered wooden casket, but a broken beat lights the way to the slitted burial chamber of clarinet. Now seething: When length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore, And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain... The Moment now turns in on itself with a huge major cadence, throated into distortion then flicked off like a reel-to-reel. The cosmic bombast of Lanier lines like \x93Unafraid, I am fain to face/ The vast sweet visage of space\x94 is laid over the lappings and swells of a full orchestra. Even with all the skips and reversals, the constant interference, it's difficult to tell: are we in a concert hall or a tuner in someone's darkened bedroom? Has Chris sampled the rehearsals of his Dad's unfinished symphony and fed them through his friend's laptop? A French horn rises and submerges in the marsh; the camera sweeps out to endless sea, with a simple, sweet electric guitar lullaby to keep the credits rolling. This is an experiment in cathartic orchestration, and studio ebb-and-flow. There are enough thick browns and reds, creeks topped with red and yellow leaves, \x93marshes meshed with a million veins,\x94 muddy deltas, and grainy sea floors. Inside, there's an epic drama set in geologic time, where everything is either washing, washed away, or water. The flow is endless while it lasts: father-son nostalgia, cinematic hubris, a saccharine death sigh, all in service of a hymn to the sea expressed in mere water. The endless pivot of the whole album-- The Moment-- is just a dark dilation on some deathbed, opening on the first light of the last day of the rest of reverse-life.

Summer Sun,Yo La Tengo,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf75e6ef95969321691/1:1/w_160/daf365f7.jpg,2003-04-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8864-summer-sun/,Matador,"Can there exist a fate worse than mediocrity for a band that's had a taste of greatness? How about for a band that's enjoyed perhaps one of the longest runs of greatness in indie rock's brief history? Yo La Tengo formed just as indie rock-as-we-know-it was getting its wings in the mid-80s. Sure, they didn't get really great until Painful dropped in 1993, pointing to a turn away from alt-country dynamics and toward dronier organ-rock and guitar freakouts-- but they sure as shit haven't let up since, kicking out consistently remarkable full-lengths roughly every three years. 2000's And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out was the first sign that they might be running out of ideas. Though an incredibly strong record from any band that deep into a rock music career, and packed with touching breakup songs and beautiful, semi-experimental atmospheres, the across-the-map diversity the band had become known for was notably absent. Unfortunately, Summer Sun confirms suspicions, and, sadder still, marks Yo La Tengo's first album since their 1986 debut, Ride the Tiger, to lack invention altogether. Summer Sun is pleasant, if nothing else, but that's such a loaded word for an album that clearly aspires to (and ought to be) so much more than it accomplishes. At least if the album had been completely wretched, it could have been dismissed as an unwitting experiment or some such foolishness. But it ain't, and that's the shame of it all; Summer Sun consistently reaches a height of disposability so static and homogenous that it simply must be dispersed over an hour's worth of music. This isn't the sound of one of the most prominent institutions in independent music maturing; it's more like decomposing. It hurts to write that, but pipe the breezy, wistful blue skies of ""Let's Be Still"" through tinny elevator speakers, or the sound system of your local Wal-Mart, and it's nothing but indie-muzak. Call it a natural progression from And Then Nothing's moody, twilit explorations of texture and atmosphere, but progression or not, last year's instrumental The Sounds of the Sounds of Science had more creativity and dynamism in a single track than the entirety of Summer Sun, and that was a score to fucking nature documentaries-- never the most fertile ground for inspiration. For a band that once thrived on its stunning eclecticism, as well as a masterful assimilation of moods and styles, to produce an album that's merely pretty is tragic. Though, even if it smacks of gross underachievement, there is something to be said for the competence and simplicity of a record that understands how to gracefully fade into the background. Inasmuch as none of Summer Sun's songs aim for anything more than hushed, dulcet melodies and passive meditations, most of them basically hit their targets. The same smooth, rolling bass, delicate guitar lines, and airy percussion morph almost imperceptibly from the blue skies and bright eyes of ""Beach Party Tonight"" to the ghostly call of the Big Star cover ""Take Care"" and all intermediary points. Additional instrumentation of all stripes (strings, brass, piano, and the list goes on) seems added as necessary for cosmetic purposes, and the results are rarely less than soothing, if unremarkable. Truly memorable instances are few and far between, and often for the worse; the standout tracks on Summer Sun are primarily the beat-poetry jazz drone of ""Nothing But You and Me"" and the highly dubious post-fusion wankery of ""Georgia vs. Yo La Tengo"". It says something, I guess, about the relatively constant quality to be found here that the most notable tracks are the weaker ones, but that's kind of sad, isn't it? Who wants to remember an album for the lowlights? If any bright spot is to be found on Summer Sun, it belongs to Georgia Hubley, whose gorgeous, dusky alto comes closer to lighting up a room than anything else on this tepid body. Her voice alone stands counter to the various missteps and cardboard cutouts, and alone brings ""Today Is the Day"" and ""Take Care"" closest to genuinely intimate, affecting glimpses in the midst of tunes that are all too willing to remain at arm's length. In particular, ""Take Care"", as the finale to Summer Sun, steeps the preceding hour of beatific, automatic smiles in a beautiful melancholy, like a knowing and regretful farewell. I hope that's not the case, but if this is truly the next step in Yo La Tengo's move toward some abstract concept like artistic maturity, I don't think I want to stick around for the conclusion.","Can there exist a fate worse than mediocrity for a band that's had a taste of greatness?

"Tall, Dark and Handcuffed",Cex,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a579b1335d7bf1698be5/1:1/w_160/62314d3c.jpg,2003-04-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1388-tall-dark-and-handcuffed/,Tigerbeat6,"Blues, punk, and hip-hop are arguably the three genres of popular music most problematized by grand causal arcs and the myths of authenticity. Every punk chronicle (see The Filth and the Fury for a great filmic example) takes pains to link the idiom's genesis to societal rot, and to present its pioneers as singular and messianic. Blues patriarchs are particularly burdened with extratextual prerequisites: they could never just have been horny or melodic; they must have been poor, or criminals, or on Satan's guestlist, or channelers of the anguish of the enslaved. Yes Yes Y'all, a new oral history of hip-hop's Cretaceous period, subtly makes the ancient argument that hip-hop was born of urban decay and civil dysfunction, and that its early practitioners were visionaries whose realness the current church must strive to uphold. Shiiiit. Enter Ryan Kidwell, aka Cex, a talented, accomplished, and complicated 21 year-old who, for my filthy lucre, hasn't made a good album yet, despite his gifts with sound-collage and pose-analysis. He gets unfairly dubbed an nth-generation suburban fraud, but wait: if that oft-gonged municipal hellhole theory is valid, he should be packing more cred than Fitty Cent, because, let's face it (s'blanket-statement time, homesnakes), Baltimore sucks. That town's hipper denizens have been trying to construe John Waters' tackiness as a virtue for too long. Cex's B-More, which he extols on some of this album's better tracks (""Gigolo Knights"", ""Ghost Rider""), gave its once-cool downtown to ESPNZone, and embodies the worst elements of both sides of its North-South conflation. The dumpsters there say ""Ameriwaste"" on them. The Great Blacks In Wax Museum is glorious, but all the nearby pay-per-hour hotel rooms have tripods in them and guys in turbans swapping briefcases and jetskis in the parking lots. Cex keeps calling B-More by its chamber-of-commerce mis-moniker Charm City, when he's got to know that Harm City, Perm City, and Chud City are more befitting. But anyway, he rejects the rap-as-a-cultural-barometer argument, rhyming on the bold ""Bad Acne"" that genres can be ""police states"": ""I'm not pissing on tradition but stagnation I be hating."" Then he shoots down rap's Importance, saying it's not ""the key to revolution, it's just a fucking distraction."" That copout is characteristic of this record, which takes risks but then insists that nothing's at stake (Temporary Residence honcho and Sonna frontman Jeremy Devine jokes of Cex on his eponymous skit, ""You're rapping about dodgeball and bicycles""). Later during ""Acne"", Cex says he's ""never really been an entertainer, just a snake oil salesman."" Now you can't hand a critic a lubricated mallet like that. Yes, this is Cex's first all-MC venture, and though he was poised to drop a bomb, he dropped the ball; despite his ambition, he comes across as a nervous huckster who talks fast in hopes of preventing the listener from thinking. One minute he climbs the peaks of brag-rap, and the next he's deprecating himself at the bottom of the ocean. One minute he's talking trash and trying to come across as wielding a mack's fleet wood; and the next he's all biographical and heartfelt, putting the emo in memoir. Mixing shit up is fine and all, but this record conveys a Cex-in-transition who is having a crisis of confidence about whether to keep being penis-checking funny or to chase some bantam meaning. The amazingly urgent and ominous ""Childhood of a Leader"" (one of several weak titles-- see also ""Good Morning, Universe"") shows that Cex is thematically on par with Eminem, but the song's almost out of place on this goof-trip album (though Cex goes out with some Revelation-rejecting 9/11 proclamations on the record's finale). His embarrassing flow suggests the Fresh Prince's early crap, or a pubescent Prime Minister Pete Nice. Only three beats on the album aren't cursory, and even his great backing tracks subscribe, unfortunately, to the dynamics of the indie rock Cex loved, saving their best moments for the choruses instead of rocking the whole time. The ""serious"" passages are uncomfortably close cousins of Cex's online blogs. The record seems like an aural playbill for Cex's swell live show instead of a stand-alone effort. He's frequently hilarious (the Jesus stuff, the Preparation H ref, the Morningstar corn dog allusion, the smart and party-denial-trolling line about orgasms that make his partner forget Afghanistan), but he seems capable of being much more than a glitch-hop Andy Dick. This masturbauteur is very different from, say, a shameful Lou Barlow; he wants to get off on selling you raps about him getting himself off. Spare yourself from entering this feedback loop of need, which, if you'll forgive the inorganic full-circle-wholeness of this review, reminds me of the life-force-draining vibe of certain B-More streets. Cex's recorded output makes a case for considering him a fascinating exhibit, but not yet wholly an artist or entertainer.","Blues, punk, and hip-hop are arguably the three genres of popular music most problematized by grand causal arcs and the ...

Polarity,Norman,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42aea9e61561daa80b1/1:1/w_160/c76c4be6.jpg,2003-04-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5837-polarity/,Stuck Under the Needle,"There's certainly nothing shameful about having Sir-Mix-a-Lot as the most well known member of your city's hip-hop pantheon. Beyond \x93Chief Boot Knocka\x94, though, Seattle, Washington is better known for Eddie Vedder's plaid party pad than its vital hip-hop scene. This is good and bad: on one hand, since it's neither a Borough nor Cali, heads don't automatically look to Seattle for the freshest rhymes, leaving its hip-hop denizens to fight harder for wider recognition. On the other hand, the city's a blank slate; since Seattle rappers don't have any Kool Hercs to answer to (metaphorically, of course), they can be as creative as possible without laboring in anyone's shadow, or living up to their city's prescribed heritage. Despite Seattle's lack of heavy hip-hop baggage, the Oldominion collective works hard to properly represent their cities (the massive, more than 20-person crew operates out of Seattle and Portland). Barring Portland-based Quannum duo Lifesavas, they've recently been the most visible Pacific Northwest rappers, joining the West Coast legs of the Def Jux and Anticon tours. More importantly, they come the closest to defining a specific Northwest hip-hop sound; their characteristically moody production and thoughtful lyrics often illuminate a dark spirituality behind constant references to Lord of the Rings and their own Wizard of Oz-like mythology (based on Seattle's nickname as \x93Emerald City\x94). Norman is the shared (somewhat sociopathic) alter ego of two of Oldominiox92s most prominent figures: producer Onry Ozzborn and rapper Barfly. It's a concept album surrounding the life of \x93Normax94 (i.e. Psycho's Norman Bates), and immediately, the character is established as a hard-luck outcast without a definitive hip-hop past. On the first track \x93One Man Band\x94, Onry rhymes, \x93Normax92s the type of guy who never listened to LL/ Alice Cooper, Slipknot and Godsmack were the ones in headphones/ And Normax92s the type of guy that I love no matter the cost/ We goix92 crazy together...creatix92 scientific clones.\x94 With its matter-of-fact, distinctive cadence, the song comes off like a macabre, alienated counterpart/response to Aesop Rock's beloved \x93Lucy\x94; a Moog-like melody stumbles across the chorus, and Claude Denjeax92s campy vision is given ominous new life. On the stellar \x93Human Traffic\x94, Onry's affinity for ambient record-crackle beats is woven among melancholic violins, minimalist kick-drum, and deep, funky keyboards. A different version of the record crackle shows up later on \x93Weastwick UTD\x94 during its clever soccer metaphor, in which Norman \x93runs the wrong way down the field.\x94 At one hilarious point, Barfly halfway approximates a Brit accent and screams, \x93Oy, oy, motherfuckers! I love Stiff Little Fingers pointix92 at suckas!\x94 Of course, if Norman and the rest of the Oldominion crew wanna forge on with a new sound independent of hip-hop's forbears, they gotta rep for their town, and it wouldn't be a Seattle hip-hop record if these dudes didn't make a smack reference. On \x93Martyr\x94 they rhyme, \x93Perry Farrell/ Jim Carroll/ I'm scared of the devil/ This is my Basketball Diary/ And the perils of attaining these heights is falling fifty stories into syringes/ Harmony Korine's KIDS...Renee Zellweger and the lead singer of Hole/ I don't even have to say her name, I think you know.\x94 The duo's cadences play leapfrog with the beats, and they often rap at halftime for a surreal effect. The depressive, layered production reflects the isolating, wet darkness that grips the Pacific Northwest nine months out of the year. It's the unmistakable sound of Seattle hip-hop.","There\x92s certainly nothing shameful about having Sir-Mix-a-Lot as the most well known member of your city\x92s hip-hop pantheon ...

Dubtometry,DJ Spooky,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d5c0084474cd0c26d5/1:1/w_160/5aa14d0a.jpg,2003-04-08 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2386-dubtometry/,Thirsty EarSynchronic,"First off, dox92t let the credits fool you. Mad Professor and dub legend/guru Lee \x93Scratch\x94 Perry are being credited as having been heavily involved with Dubtometry-- a drastic reworking of Optometry, DJ Spooky's 2002 collaboration with NYC jazz wunderkind Matthew Shipp (avaiable on his Thirsty Ear label)-- but if CD inserts can be trusted, their touch was minimal and composite. Their names are attached to only a few of Dubtometry's seventeen cuts, including mere interludes and Perry's own \x93Jungle Soldier\x94; the prominent placement of their monikers on the album cover seems more like a calculated bid for credibility than an accurate representation of the artists and influences on this record, which runs the gamut from traditional dub to polished hip-hop and DJ Krust-flavored drum and bass. The album is mostly successful in its basic mission: taking jazz-fusion and musiq-concrete source material and putting a ballsy urban spin on it, bringing out the head nodding libido buried deep inside Optometry's somewhat pretentious and consciously stolid-- though still impressive-- experimentation. Many of the remixers on Dubtometry drastically improve the quality of their chosen songs by cleverly augmenting their highly traditional jazz identity: The weak, yawning \x93Parachutes\x94 finds itself revitalized with the addition of lilting flute passages and a striding, solid drum beat, breathing life into the original's academic corpse, while DJ Goo masterfully reworks the loose, bloated \x93Optometry\x94 into a crisp slab of inebriated hip-hop on \x93Bomb Massive\x94, replete with decayed synth bursts and a bassline that tops any of Spooky's upright work, topped off by sublime beatboxing from IsWhat? member Napolean . Goo's take on \x93Ibid, Desmarches, Ibid\x94 is equally successful at injecting fresh beats under the jazz-bop skin, as is the slow Caribbean sleepwalk of Twilight Circus' \x93Variation Cybernetique\x94 remix, which retains the original's gaseous string section. The closer deserves extra props: Animal Crackers' epic, wheels of steel raid on \x93Optometry\x94 is a class clown worth getting detention with, or Charlie Brown packing heat. The most glaring exceptions are easily spotted. The lesser criminals in Colorform craft a jazzy house rave-up from the rib of \x93Sequentia Absentia\x94 that's obviously lost in the wrong neighborhood at 2AM. J-Live's contribution is the record's nadir, a tepid vocal track that samples a non-descript snippet of \x93Optometry\x94 and builds an equally faceless song; \x93Asphalt (Tome II)\x94 was one of the more feverish moments on Optometry, but in the hands of Negativland it's a disappointment, a looping afterthought that falls flat. The credit and blame belongs to all the players, not just the notables: Dubtometry's greatest mistake is not presenting its contents as an amoebic whole. Optometry sold itself on the names of its central contributiors, and the remix album suffers from a serious case of conceptual envy. But Dubtometry does bring some much-needed swagger to the table in the house that Miller and Schipp built: the sometimes stuffy compositions found on the original disc get a kick in the ass and some tongue in the ear, and it's just the sort of stimulation that was needed. Everything's a little less inhibited this time around: be sure and check your drinks.","First off, don\x92t let the credits fool you.

Fear Yourself,Daniel Johnston,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba16ea9e61561daa7139/1:1/w_160/bcd1e020.jpg,2003-04-08 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4282-fear-yourself/,Gammon,"This being a Daniel Johnston review, you people must love raw honesty and such, so here's some pretty authentic stuff: I'm down with the flu. So sick am I, in fact, that I think I'm going to let David Bowie take it from here. ""This will have to be one of my favorite albums of the year so far. All of the Johnston traits are here in abundance. Beautiful melodies, fine if painful lyrics, and a searching poignancy that clutches the heart like iced velvet."" Thanks, Dave, dig the ""iced velvet"" simile. Very glam. Readers: Your Daniel Johnston CD has just been reviewed by David Bowie. Take care and goodnight. Such are the simpering testimonials Daniel Johnston always swam in, flowing from the oddest sources-- Eddie Vedder, Matt Groening, Kurt Cobain-- making him sound less like a favored songwriter and more like a pet cause. Even if his celebrity fans are truly interested in giving Daniel exposure rather than spritzing their own images with outsider chic, all they accomplish is forever interlocking Johnston's music (simple and lovely and undeserving of any awe) with his famed manic depression. As it usually happens in these cases, it's the No. 1 fan who commits the most egregious faux pas of all. Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse-- who had proven his devotion to Johnston by covering ""Hey Joe"" and ""My Yoke Is Heavy""-- got to produce Fear Yourself. ""Daniel is a gift to us,"" he embarrassingly gushes on the sticker blurb, though the album-- despite being credited solely to Johnson-- is pretty much Mark's gift to Daniel. Linkous handled all arrangements and played most instruments on the CD, relegating the author to vocals and piano. The result, while chock full of beautiful bits, backfires terribly. The lacquered production makes Johnston sound like a guest, or rather a ghost, in his own house. His timid voice haunts a suddenly spacious mansion, caught in mirror halls of multitracked harmony, bouncing off exotic trinkets (Mellotron? Chamberlin? Optigan?!). The opener ""Now"" is a deliberate false start, but also a statement of purpose: as Folk Implosion's glossy One Part Lullaby kicks off with a lo-fi guitar figure, ""Now"" spends its first minute as a tin-thin boombox recording, gradually funnels in noise, and suddenly emerges in glorious high fidelity! For about 30 seconds! And then ends! The meta-narrative couldn't be clearer: The Producer is here, come to save this poor sap from his lo-fi past. Press materials insist that Linkous stayed out of the genius' way, Albini-style. ""I don't even want to say I produced, I'm just ecstatic to have anything to do with getting more of him on tape,"" goes the exact quote, but even the most cursory listen debunks this soundbite as positively Rumsfeldian. Who put Tinderstick-sized holy-shit orchestra hits on ""Syrup of Tears""? Who turned ""Love Not Dead"" and ""Living It for the Moment"" into Britpop pastiche? Did Johnston walk into the studio intent on using french horns and glockenspiels on ""Power of Love""? Overproduction is relative, mind you-- I love when bands raid Jon Brion's basement. The problem with Fear Yourself is not that it sounds big, rather that it sounds condescending to the man it's supposed to be all about, and more importantly, by. The lushness of a ""One Part Lullaby"" or-- I dunno, ""Automatic for the People""-- is inoffensive because Barlow and Stipe arrive to it naturally. But here, it's a handout. Linkous, for all his best intentions, implicitly paints Johnston as helpless, his previous output a dry run for the big time, his art in need of patronage. Iced velvet, indeed.","This being a Daniel Johnston review, you people must love raw honesty and such, so here's some pretty authentic ...

The Exploding Hearts are not tongue-in-cheek punk-pop revivalists, and they aren't postmodern pastiche artists borrowing an abandoned aesthetic for the sake of cultural commentary. In fact, from their bright pink-and-yellow album art to their shamelessly Sex Pistols-esque poses, The Exploding Hearts make it clear from the outset that they're not too concerned with being taken seriously-- by you or anybody. At first glance, it would be easy to write off the Exploding Hearts as another pop/punk band that never mentally evolved past the 10th grade. But on their debut full-length, Guitar Romantic, the ridiculous geekdom that comes through the Hearts' ""cool"" façade like grease through a Big Mac wrapper pays off in spades, as the Portland four-piece cuts right to the energetic heart of power-pop, evoking vintage Soft Boys, The Only Ones, and-- though undoubtedly through sheer coincidence-- The Apples in Stereo's first seven-inches. The first thing you're likely to notice about Guitar Romantic is the production. It's clipped-out and fuzzy, burying the VU needle at +3. There's no subtlety to be found here: Everything is pushed so far to the top of the mix that the instruments all blend together into a fuzzy two-dimensional sonic image. In this context, the sound works perfectly-- there's no reason anything here should be anywhere except at the front. With all the instruments appropriately (or, perhaps, inappropriately) loud, the focus falls squarely on the songs themselves, which is where The Exploding Hearts' namesake becomes all too fitting. The band wastes no time kicking your ass, either: The opener, ""Modern Kicks"", is easily one of Guitar Romantic's best tracks, and perfectly exemplifies what makes this band's music so infectious. With its driving rhythm and insanely catchy vocal hook delivered in a bratty faux-English accent, the song plays out like an anthemically poppy and distinctly American incarnation of The Buzzcocks. But Guitar Romantic peaks with ""Sleeping Aides and Razor Blades"", mining the energetic melodies of everything from Big Star to Nick Lowe to the misplaced 50s-isms and lobotomized abandon of The Ramones. There are points throughout Guitar Romantic where parallels could be drawn to The Strokes, and indeed, the two bands seem to be working from a pretty similar tradition. But where The Strokes embody a self-conscious, affected ""cool"" that involves preening their hair to make it look like they just woke up, and their music sometimes seems similarly premeditated and self-conscious, The Exploding Hearts simply have no shame. These guys indulge in power-pop like true hedonists, their unmitigated passion for the music negating any shred of the hipness their influences imply. At first, it's confounding that a band with such a keen sense of songcraft would adopt a style aesthetic that combines punk cliché with an L.A. Looks advertisement, but their style, like their sound, comes across as a product of unabashed enthusiasm and near-ridiculous reverence for the music. All this discussion, of course, seems irrelevant when the record's playing. At the end of the day, Guitar Romantic is simply a fucking awesome power-pop record that would've been just as relevant and engaging twenty-five years ago, and will undoubtedly be just as fun twenty-five years down the road. It may seem glaringly retro on the surface, but The Exploding Hearts have released an album that is, at its core, ageless. ","Ladies and gentlemen, please switch off your irony detectors.

Pure Tone Audiometry,Various Artists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299f54b1335d7bf1697ec0/1:1/w_160/d615c114.jpg,2003-04-08 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6-pure-tone-audiometry/,Silber,"Can there be any purpose behind a master's degree in the psychology of music other than inevitably attempting to rule the minds of men through the manipulative powers of sound? I submit that there can not; the job prospects from a degree like that are, like, what? Music therapist? I don't think so. The only career I can imagine it successfully leading to is Supervillian. It doesn't take a superhuman intellect to see through the aims of Jon DeRosa's education-- he's the arch-mastermind behind the warm, homey folk of Pale Horse and Rider, and has guested on several other records, including Debridement, a recent Chairkickers release by Rivulets. But none of his various projects are more dangerous, more insidious, than the icy calm of Aarktica's dreamy ambiance. In fact, his nefarious desire to lull listeners into a pliant, peaceful daydream (and then rob them, no doubt-- or worse!) could easily have succeeded with last year's Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway if it weren't for the heroic actions of Pitchfo... hey, wait. That got a really positive review... uuuhhhh.... now... that... I think about it, Pure Tone Audiometry is really... pretty... oh, god, no... if I don't come back, tell Kathleen Hanna... I... love... her... Wow... where was I? I always get distracted by the lush, diffuse tones at the conclusion of ""Out to Sea"". The track opens Pure Tone Audiometry with a delicate, Magnetic Fields-ish male/female vocal dynamic between DeRosa and Lorraine Lelis, as they sweetly harmonize over the romantic notions of being lost at sea and never again seeing home. Before long, the voices become lost in the hazy ambiance completely, and the experimental pop is vaporized; only Lelis' seraphic call remains to try and navigate the listener through the droning fog. Eventually, even the music itself vanishes. DeRosa's arrangements are intensely careful and subdued, and never once does he allow his deliberately constructed tranquility to be disturbed. The few real swells of emotion are thrilling, but momentary; such an austere, clinical tone is produced that it sometimes becomes stultifying, although I'm not sure emotive response is the aim here. Aarktica is cold, pure, and almost inescapably tranquil. ""Snowstorm Ruins Birthday"" revisits the vapor that lingers from ""Out to Sea"". There was music here, but now only traces remain, surrounding the listener in a wintry mist of component sounds, atomic gray noise, a touching (but still distant) pop melody dissolved into its basic elements. Slowly, song structures reform; DeRosa's wispy vocals return alongside Lelis' stunning accompaniment, triumphantly welling up from miles beneath the faintly reverberating electric and simple acoustic plucking in ""Ocean""'s beautiful climax. ""Big Year"" explores the darker regions of Aarktica's ethereal shoegazing like a slightly cheerier version of Projekt-based ambient artists Lycia; the listener is inexorably pulled deeper into the track's echoing maze of acoustics, subtly ominous drones, and trembling strings. Until... total silence? No, wait. Not total. DeRosa slipped up; ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is a five-minute foray into ultra-minimalist drone, just a rhythmic pulse wrapped in a barely audible hum, before eventually bowing out completely. The sheer vacancy of what amounts to little more than empty space is pretty unnecessary, and though it's anything but jarring, it still stands out as a glaring hole in an otherwise pristine calm. As a breather before ""Williamsburg Counterpoint"", Pure Tone Audiometry's twelve-minute centerpiece, ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is briefly very effective. By the halfway point, though, the album's hypnotic spell has been broken-- it served as an anticlimactic pause, but after a few minutes, it just seems like a good time to get a drink, to make my escape.

Wanna Buy a Craprak?,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76e13d19756521393f7/1:1/w_160/08e47de6.jpg,2003-04-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1861-wanna-buy-a-craprak/,Carpark,"Label compilations are a strange beast. In some ways, it feels weird to pay for them. They are, after all, essentially advertisements for a business, which is something we're used to getting for free. The fact that they're often extremely variable in terms of overall sound doesn't help. When each track seems completely unrelated to the one before, and the CD doesn't seem like anything you would ever listen to straight through, the comp feels more like something that should be inserted gratis into a magazine. There are exceptions. Some label comps actually become classics in their own right. Take 2000's Putting the Morr Back in Morrissey. It elevated German label Morr Music by laying bare the label's aesthetic direction and managing to sound like a cohesive record. There was No New York, the Brian Eno-produced introduction to New York's then-burgeoning no-wave scene, featuring four tracks a piece from the now-legendary acts The Contortions, Teenage Jesus & The Jerks, Mars, and DNA. And then there's Wanna Buy a Bridge?, the 1980 Rough Trade collection that introduced America to bands like The Raincoats, Scritti Politti and Cabaret Voltaire. I've never heard Wanna Buy a Bridge?, but the fact that I've heard of it, 23 years after its release, speaks to its classic status. You can't say that about Digital Hardcore's You've Got the Fucking Power. Wanna Buy a Craprak?, the first compilation from New York's Carpark Records, doesn't quite reach those lofty heights but it has a lot to recommend. First, it sounds great as a single record. There's a fine line between ""these tracks share a sound and attitude"" and ""all the artists on this label sound alike,"" but Carpark winds up on the good side of the divide. There is a definable sound to Carpark. Or sounds, I should say. Certain characteristics carry over from one artist to the next: No melody fear. Respect for the acoustic guitar. Warmth. Three styles predominate and the label's artists do them all well. I'm in love with the sound of an acoustic guitar being dragged and dropped, and Wanna Buy a Craprak? delivers plenty. Greg Davis' ""Brocade"", from a forthcoming album, is at least as lovely as anything on his underrated Arbor. Davis knows how to mix minimalist fingerpicking patterns with subtle beats and gentle noises; something about the fresh clarity of his sound reminds me of a cool but sunny spring afternoon. Marumari's ""Saka"" has an electric guitar, but the clean tone and processed slides, bumping up against some piano tinkling and choppy percussion, give the track a laptop folk feel. Ogurusu Norihide's ""5:00"", from the just-released Modern, nods more deeply to tradition, as he spins a sentimental mountainside shuffle on steel string and bass with only the vaguest hint of digital processing. And then Hrvatski offers the tense, jittery exclusive track ""Equinox"", which builds acoustic guitar, feedback, accordion and percussion into something approaching pop until the track disintegrates toward the end. Carpark has also shown an interest in 80s-inspired synthpop. Dinky's ""No Love"" (also found on her debut Black Cabaret) sounds both haughty and cheap, and some effective background vocals manage cancel out Andrea E. Perez' predictably bored delivery. Better is Takagi Masakatsu's big-hearted ""Golden Town with Sunglasses"", which goes new wave in an endearingly clumsy four-track style, someone mumbling underneath the synths like a Silk Road Sukpatch. And finally, Kit Clayton & Safety Scissors' ""17-11"" shares a lot with the Super_Collider IDMR&B; of Raw Digits, though with inferior songwriting. The final Carpark category belongs to the ambient stuff. So Takahashi's gurgling ""Blue, Blue, Electronic Blue"" is aggressively lovely, a slowly modulating drone that oozes light and texture. Kid 606 kicks in the spare ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away It Would Be Looking for the Day When Right Beside You It Could Forever Stay"" (from the Soccergirl EP), which is nice enough, but almost too simple for its own good. And Casino Versus Japan's ""Aquarium"" (from Whole Numbers Play the Basics) is dominated by softly falling organ chords, giving an effect that's nostalgic and dreamlike, a slowdance song from a parallel universe. The three primary styles on Wanna Buy a Craprak? really do blend together nicely, the thing is sequenced well and flows, and Carpark's artists are accomplished. A label compilation worth owning.","Label compilations are a strange beast. In some ways, it feels weird to pay for them. They are, after all ...

El Cielo,Dredg,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba15ea9e61561daa7137/1:1/w_160/a304608a.gif,2003-04-07 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2450-el-cielo/,Interscope,"To make a pretentious concept album, you have to start with a pretentious concept, and Dredg picked a novel one: \x93sleep paralysis.\x94 Wading through the extensive liner notes for El Cielo, you can read all about this phenomenon, where you wake up to discover you cax92t move, or maybe it's that you're dreaming you cax92t move, and there's something about auditory hallucinations-- actually, I never figured out exactly what it is. And I'm also not sure why they wrote an entire album about it. That's just the first puzzle in Dredg's latest full-length. This California art metal band resembles Tool raised by hippies, encouraged to finger-paint all day. Veering between ominous dirges and wide-eyed big sky anthems, they play massive art metal that's been treated to multi-layered, intricate production in the vein of Radiohead and Pink Floyd; and for a band that can smash and roil like waves against Pacific beaches, they frequently take the subtler road, softening themselves with atmosphere and world music flourishes. There's just one problem: El Cielo makes no sense. I dox92t mean the lyrics or the central concept, which are enough of a Rorschach test to let any devoted fan dig out whatever they want from this album (post-millennial dread, musings on the conflict between the real and the unreal, the active and the paralyzed-- all your favorite themes are here), but the hundred and one ideas thrown onto this record dox92t hang together. It's too diffuse to match its scope, and all of the influences melt down to a bland sheen. Although frontman Gavin Hayes could have set the tone here, he's a hard man to read. Painfully earnest and sounding more assured than on their previous record Leitmotif, he's still in an awkward niche: he's too sincere and hopeful to sandpaper our eyes with visions of horror, yet too smooth to let his guard down. Mostly, he just sounds weird: his lyrics are like getting trapped at a party by a guy who wants to talk about dolphins, or Ralph Nader. \x93All you need is a modest house in a modest neighborhood/ In a modest town where honest people dwell,\x94 he states at one point, with a naiveté that's neither affected nor effective. Then wonder fills his voice as he sings, \x93Babies are born/ In the same buildings where people go/ To pass away...pass away.\x94 Yes, Gavin. People die. You cax92t fault the rest of the band, when they stick to melodic hard rock at least; they nail the punchy clean riffs on \x93Sanzex94, and tracks like \x93Convalescent\x94 and \x93Eighteen People Living in Harmony\x94 burn with the urgency of painting flames on a classic car, but they lose their edge when they soften the mood. As exotic and svelte as Dredg want to sound, they havex92t found a way to do it without watering down their music. When they don acoustic guitars, they cax92t help but rip off \x93Paranoid Android\x94; the Latin accents and slower tempos are as authentic as a Zorro movie. Knowing their limits, they've also dragged a circus of performers onto the record: strings, world musicians like the Iranian-born singer Azam Ali, and, lest I forget, the members of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, who close the album in an almost clichéd finale of hope and uplift. Dredg integrates some of these varied elements into their songs-- percussionist Greg Ellis may be the sharpest collaboration-- but quarantine others within the five instrumental interludes, subtitled \x93brushstrokes\x94, sticking random fragments of music between the songs. It's these bewildering variety on the edges of the record that give it a taint of mystery and exoticism, complementing that all-purpose metaphor of sleep paralysis. But cramming all of this stuff together doesx92t mean it adds up to anything: without the material and structure to make use of it, it's just a big multicultural mess. Dredg has to learn how to harness all of the ideas-- and major label money-- they now bring to these projects, the very things that gave them access to such a wellspring of talent. Next time, even if they drag in the world music, the choir and everything else, they should start with a concept that's easier to write about, something tangible, something with boundaries. Concept is only validating if it adds cohesion to your work, if it informs the compositions. This collection of unrelated experiments could have been anything, and though Dredg claims they're all related somehow, these songs fail to flow together, even as dreams.","To make a pretentious concept album, you have to start with a pretentious concept, and Dredg picked a novel one ...

Nothing's Going to Happen,Elf Power,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc43c0084474cd0c2a55/1:1/w_160/2147ee67.jpg,2003-04-07 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2745-nothings-going-to-happen/,Arena Rock,"Lo-fi hiss. Is there any finer sound than a power chord played through a four-track that sounds like it was built from Legos? It's like heroin to me; razorblades, anthrax, whatever-- wrap them in a few layers of fuzzed-up guitar and I'll eat it with my breakfast cereal. For years, Athens, GA stood as the richest resource of lo-fi hiss on Earth, but with the rapid expansion of the powerful Elephant 6 conglomerate, who controlled the area's supply, the hiss quickly dried up, leaving addicts like myself out in the cold. Fortunately, a handful of bands have emerged from E6 unscathed. Elf Power is one of the last remaining bastions of Athens' hiss production, having churned out irresistible fuzz-pop since the heady days of 1994. Now, on Nothing's Going to Happen, this Athens group has gotten its Elf Powers over sixteen tracks from all corners of the musical globe. And not just any songs. Great ones. Songs so near and dear to me that just the thought of having to do without the original versions makes me wanna fight. Naturally, I was a bit concerned as to whether Elf Power could do them justice, but the band quickly negated my worries with their trademarked geyser blasts of that precious opiate I cannot resist: lo-fi hiss. Out of the massive, monolithic indie stone-drone they've established as their signature sound, the Elves have hacked out an incredible array of covers from the most disparate group of names you're likely to see: Roky Erickson, Tall Dwarfs (classic lo-fi poppers in their own right), Jesus and Mary Chain (ditto), The... Misfits (what?), Bad Brains... ""B-b-but these songs aren't going to sound like the originals! They'll be butchered!"" some purist vainly cries. Silence! When I want your opinion I'll rattle your cage, even if you are half-right. On the surface, it may seem that a great many of these songs would be obscured by Elf Power's indie haze, but this is a labor done in earnest; these songs weren't chosen just to be buried. Hearing the D.C. hardcore of ""Paid to Cum"" through the light-hearted retro-buzz that only Elf Power can supply makes it overwhelmingly clear: the sincerest form of flattery isn't imitation; it's faithful interpretation. Despite the exterior differences in mood and instrumentation, everything here is carved from the same Rock, and as each track falls sway to Andrew Rieger's emotionally distant croons and wave after wave of acid-washed guitar crunch, it becomes evident that the band has accomplished something impressive. On one hand, Nothing's Going to Happen is so universally cohesive that someone unfamiliar with the roots of these tracks could be forgiven for mistaking this as an original effort. The slightly more subdued sound of Creatures plays well here, giving the group enough room to keep the acoustics cleaner when it counts (check out the bounce-pop of T.Rex's ""Hot Love""), or as muddy as necessary on tracks like the title cut. Hell, even the subject matter doesn't stray that far from the trippy psychedelia of their other outings. There're no birds with candy-bar heads, but ""Hybrid Moments"", The Frogs' ""Weird on the Avenue"", and Erickson's ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (among others) have a distinct oddity that's immediately reminiscent of vintage Elfin material. But then, finally getting around to the other hand in this comparison, they never sacrifice the personality of the various artists they tackle. Sure, the adjustment gets a little rough in places-- fans may rankle at the sheer absurdity of Rieger's Gary Numan impression on ""My Shadow in Vain"", and four-out-of-five dentists didn't believe it, but ""Upside Down"" sounds even lower-fi than ever before. Fortunately, these slight missteps take nothing away from the incredible effort put forth on Nothing's Going to Happen; every cut comes away as a singular application of the Elf aesthetic to every sort of music available while keeping individuality intact. Should keep the hiss fiends satisfied for quite a while.","Lo-fi hiss. Is there any finer sound than a power chord played through a four-track that sounds like it was ...

Radio-Free Brooklyn,Pete Miser,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c358eb335119a49ed6b8/1:1/w_160/dbdf467a.jpg,2003-04-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5334-radio-free-brooklyn/,Ho-Made,"I have a gigantic problem with people who describe underground/ \x93conscious\x94 hip-hop artists only in relation to mainstream bling rap-- as if bling is, was, and will always be the only kind of hip-hop that matters, as if it sets the standards by which all other hip-hop must be measured. Id est, \x93El-P illustrates a life far from the gun-slinging, bitch-humping, rocks-flashing steez of today's mainstream rap artists.\x94 It's condescending and ignorant to frame underground rappers in that way, as if the only thing an underground emcee represents is an alternative to your mainstream. But what if a rapper bases his entire theme on being underground? Like, say, the super-conscious Pete Miser, nee Pete Ho, who raps from New York via Portland, OR, whose third solo record Radio-Free Brooklyn is tight, has some great moments, and ultimately flips 19 songs about his underground lifestyle? Pete is so underground, he brags about not having Rolls, bitches, hoes, or furs, in lieu of having assloads of friends, love, hope, and \x93karma\x94. Yes, karma. Of course, it's pretty hard not to sound conscious and underground when your record's sprinkled liberally with the requisite images of war, racism, and the all-encompassing beauty of... Central Park: \x93If I had my way I'd stay a week in the park/ Forget about the phone and all the noise/ Shower in the fountain as the next day starts/ Kick it with the little girls and boys.\x94 The title track is a haunting image of Brooklyn after nuclear war, framed as a post-traumatic stress-disordered flashback: \x93I dox92t remember the place I was when the president died, but I recall the falling nuclear rain and burned skies.\x94 Dramatic, yet effective, Miser sets out in his world with an uninhibited emotionalism, though he's not self-indulgent like most emo rappers; rather, he discusses changing his name from \x93Ho\x94 to \x93Miser\x94 as a mechanism to combat racism; he writes a pretty sweet paean to his girl, elsewhere about his love for hip-hop culture, and the city itself. It meshes nicely with the tight production, ladeled by New York, with its easy beats sitting thick in the mix (but beware occasional, cringe-inducing moments of cheesy, straight-funk vibraphones...oy vey). Miser proves himself a more than capable DJ, burning holes all through the record with his scratching skills. At the beginning of the apocalyptic title track, a sample of birds chirping is violently interrupted by a monstrous explosion; the beats kick in, and we hear someone panting, \x93there's no place like home.\x94 The whole thing lasts about four seconds, but it's a nice touch, and similar moments of creativity are embroidered throughout every song. Frankly, you'd expect a lot less from a man who can put \x93Dido's touring DJ\x94 on his resume. Ultimately, Pete Miser is a pretty good underground emcee. Unfortunately, in the post-Aesop Rock world, emcees cax92t afford to be anything less than narrative geniuses; at the very least, they have to slay with the sharpness of their flow. And underground emcees can no longer simply ride on their underground-ness-- it's increasingly well known that as a whole, underground (or, to be more specific, independent) emcees rock better skills than mainstream ones: in order to blow minds, an emcee's either gotta have a hook, or innovate with rhymes, skills, or even production. When there are 57 million rappers out there promising they're gonna take it to another level, \x93pretty good underground emcee\x94 doesx92t really help you to stand out from the pack. From now on, I'm going to describe 50 Cent as \x93an alternative to all the peace-sign-flashing, bike-riding, mind-expanding conscious rappers.\x94","I have a gigantic problem with people who describe underground/ \x93conscious\x94 hip-hop artists only in relation to mainstream bling ...

Anxiety Always,ADULT.,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a012ea9e61561daa44a8/1:1/w_160/7d2cd0cf.jpg,2003-04-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/56-anxiety-always/,Ersatz Audio,"The first thing to note is that it's a wonderful thing when bands change. By this I mean when bands genuinely change: not when they ""mature"" or when they ""incorporate subtle electronic flourishes,"" but when they actually surprise you, popping up like friends who've been gone for years and reappear with bold new haircuts. Adult. have pretty much changed. Their twelve-inch records so far-- most of them collected on the Resuscitation CD-- have been stocked with some of the buzziest, punkiest electro going, as well as some of the hookiest: their nervous strobelight grind couldn't have been any less opposed to the pop sensibility it was standing on. Their last single, a happily shouty bouncer called ""Don't Stop"", had at least a few of us expecting their first proper album to be some sort of fine-tuned pop breakthrough. And it is, but not nearly in the way you'd think. The definitive departure here comes on a track called ""Glue Your Eyelids Together"", which you can tell is sort of a mission statement when you notice the picture in the liners of Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus doing exactly that. Look carefully: Miller's bottle of Elmer's is rebranded Ersatz Audio. And then listen as casually as you want, and you'll still notice that Miller is now playing bass. Right: everyone's always called them ""punks"", and now they're living up to it by being post-punks. The drum machine, previously popping forcefully in the center of the mix, now blurts and snaps from one corner of a very large room. Somewhere closer is Miller, charging sharply around on a massively fuzzed-up bassline. And right there in our collective face, her taunting chant no longer processed into tech-land, is Kuperus, bouncing and cheerleading: ""Glue your eyelids together! Glue your eyelids together!"" This time the ""post-punk"" isn't a metaphor. The sound has plenty to do with what happened when the artier punks of the late 70s started messing with synths, like a hyper child's redrawing of Cabaret Voltaire's ""Nag Nag Nag""-- and a little to do with the evil-techie buzz that's come out of the Pacific Northwest more recently (see: Mocket's ""Monitress""). And like a lot of the best post-punk, this is going to sound like a great shoddy mess to a whole lot of people: just the raw pulse of a four-note bass slice, punchy synth exclamations, needling sneers from Kuperus, and a great big slap of a snare drum keeping pace. It will provoke hatred and eye-rolling and accusations of soulless charlatanism, and at least one acquaintance has declared it ""the most annoying thing ever recorded."" But it's also terrifically, needlingly catchy, bratty fist-in-the-air catchy: in its best moments it sounds like Joy Division having a panic attack. Which is, of course, Adult.'s whole business: Anxiety Always, it's called, and there's even more jittery, spazzy insistence here than on those twelve-inches. There's also more of the deeper, more ominous exploration that filled some of those records' b-sides: the album creeps ominously in on the instrumental swell of ""The Cold Call"", and its second half opens equally slowly, repeating, tangling, and rearranging one line: ""People: you can confuse them.../ Into a disorienting babble."" There's also something of the Adult. of old, only the hyper-precise turnarounds are subdued into a careful trance: ""Shake Your Head"" bubbles and flutters with dangerous purpose, and ""Kick in the Shin""-- pictured on rear CD tray-- has an almost-smooth gloss on its deep electro, with Kuperus very nearly crooning over it. The rigidly groovy pop of ""Don't Stop"" comes back on another high point, ""Nothing of the Kind"", which is filled with a weird, scratchy twang that makes you imagine Miller wearing a cowboy hat as he plays its treble-heavy bassline. The big field trips come on ""We Know How to Have Fun"", a blurry, murky void you can spend hours parsing, and the new ""Nervous (Wreck)"", a complex and evil-sounding instrumental that feels like the soundtrack to an old video game about werewolves. But we're also gluing our eyelids together, and from there it escalates. ""Blank Eyed, Nose Bleed"" wraps its synths' brittle zapping with another paranoid cheer: ""I've been working on increasing my anxiety!"" Here I should remind you that Adult. really do have a sense of humor. Remembering this may be necessary to get through ""Turn Your Back""-- which is not to say that they're joking, but Kuperus is going to go ""neh neh neh"" at you, and you're going to want to be on her side when it happens. Because that's the sort of wonderful change this is: a high-wire hop, the kind of shift that tries to walk fearlessly onto a patch of ground surrounded by pitfalls. It's tempting to call it one of the most messily brilliant things we'll see all year, but it can't, in good faith, be recommended to everyone: if the duo's buzzy neurosis was enough to drive some people nuts before, the raw jumping and nagging of Anxiety Always will sound to many like the shoddiest, most amusical sham to be held up as a masterpiece in many of our lives. No joke: this album would annoy all hell out of some of you, would sound like everything cruel about music wrapped into a single package whose creators seem actively proud that they couldn't care less. But if you're at all ready to run with it, you might find yourself in one of the more fun positions music lovers can get into: wondering for ten minutes whether you're hearing an embarrassing wreck or a stroke of genius, and then realizing in an ecstatic flash that it is so the latter.","The first thing to note is that it's a wonderful thing when bands change.

Bright Yellow Bright Orange,The Go-Betweens,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf40eb335119a49ed1c5/1:1/w_160/84577f3f.jpg,2003-04-06 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3476-bright-yellow-bright-orange/,Jetset,"Well, I guess this means the Go-Betweens are back for good. It's not every day that a reunion becomes a full-blown second phase for a band's career, but that seems to be what's happening with this old Australian outfit, even if principle songwriters Grant McLennan and Robert Forster are the only original members back in the fold. 2000's Friends of Rachel Worth found the duo picking up pretty much where the Go-Betweens left off in 1988, back when they were a steady five-piece operating far from their Brisbane home, in London, to massive critical acclaim and microscopic album sales. The post-punk charge that found its way into some of the band's early recordings is all but gone; the band focuses almost all of Bright Yellow Bright Orange (their eighth full-length) on their acoustic, folk-inflected side. It's not an entirely bad thing: the mellow material seems to suit the band now that they're older, and gives the spotlight to their melodic craft, which hasn't diminished a bit over time. Ultimately, McLennan gets the better half of it, as his voice hasn't deteriorated much over the years; Forster, however, has trouble holding up his end. In fact, Forster's best moments on the album are those where the quality of the melody simply overwhelms his shaky, awkward vocals, a la Dylan in the days before he had a backing band. Case in point is the loping \x93Too Much of One Thing\x94, with its strummed verses and barely-there drumming, where his phrasing is less than precise, but still comes off melodically strong. McLennan puts in his two cents on some smoothly crooned, wordless interjections, making the contrast between the two vocalists all the more obvious. Opener \x93Caroline & I\x94 sounds great coming out of the gates, with a thick, though basic arrangement and a good performance from Forster, also fantastic on his best contribution, the propulsive \x93Make Her Day\x94, whose subtle keyboard countermelodies lead to ascendant choruses. But in moments, Forster is a complete disaster, like on \x93Something for Myself\x94, which sounds half-written and limp, with a completely unnatural synthesis of melody and lyrics, including onerous, would-be humorous lines like \x93Want to get out of folk/ and get into rare groove.\x94 McLennan, by contrast, can't seem to make a wrong step: he's positively ebullient on \x93Poison in the Wall\x94, where he bookends his excellent verse with big guitar hooks and a chorus that'll vertically envelop you faster than the 82nd Airborne. He pulls things back for \x93Mrs. Morgax94 and \x93Crooked Lines\x94, two richly strummed ballads that rank among the album's best tracks. His best, though, is \x93Old Mexico\x94, a thoroughly lush pop song with a swaggering, staccato guitar riff in the verses and a huge, swirling chorus full of harmonies and cascading keyboards. For its excellent high points, there's just something about Bright Yellow Bright Orange that's less than fully satisfying. Obviously, Forster's less inspired moments are mostly to blame, but there's also a certain lack of invention in a lot of the material that's a bit disappointing. Ultimately, I'm glad the Go-Betweens have decided to stick it out, because they're still making some great songs, but their best material is definitely behind them, on classic albums like Spring Hill Fair and Before Hollywood. Their latest album is certainly going to please old fans, but with their touted back catalog recently reissued, newcomers would probably be best off heading to their early records first.","Well, I guess this means the Go-Betweens are back for good.

Cruel Smile,Elvis CostelloThe Imposters,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6719d034d5c69bf3533/1:1/w_160/ce43ed16.jpg,2003-04-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1619-cruel-smile/,Island,"One of the naughtier things Elvis Costello devised for his last album was calling the centerpiece ""When I Was Cruel, Pt. 2"" and relegating ""Pt. 1"" to a Japanese-only B-side. Karma's caught up with him, though, seizing him with a prolonged fit of generosity which has culminated in Cruel Smile: a full-length companion to When I Was Cruel, offering a hodgepodge of sketches, elaboration, proposed improvements, belated amends-- and not least of all, the infamous ""Pt. 1"". As a prequel, the song isn't exactly The Matrix Reloaded, but gripping nonetheless: ""Pt. 1"" fleshes out the portrait of the same mysterious gold-digger (""Why did you travel far abroad/ So you could sleep with strangers?"") whom we last saw elevated to high society, and causing memorable hisses (""She was selling speedboats at a trade show when he met her""). All the while, Costello rues his own brutal youth, when he could muster more pungent insults at the drop of a top hat. This stunt aside, the meat of Cruel Smile comes with its remixes, which are plentiful and, refreshingly, created without the aid of cred-bearing ""name"" guests. For us rockists who cheered Costello's regression, the biggest and most pleasant surprise of When I Was Cruel must have been its sophisticated drum work, some of which bore comparison with Dave Fridmann's Yoshimi stratagems: idiosyncratic mix of live skins and sampled textures, with cut-up digital fills no human could possibly replicate. If you're with me on that, you may actually prefer Cruel Smile over the album proper, since it completely forgoes When I Was Cruel's few Bacharachian moments (""Tart"", ""My Little Blue Window"") for its glorious ugly side. The new version of ""15 Petals"" is loose and fast, its original Latin beat fuzzed up and defaced with blasts of horn skronk that wouldn't be out of place on a Frank London project. ""Spooky Girlfriend"", recorded live at KFOG, has about four drum machines going at the same time (one in reverse), and adds cavernous reverb to Costello's cracked vocal. This ""Spooky Girlfriend"" is noticeably sexier; Costello has suggested Destiny's Child should cover it, adding, ""I could see why they wouldn't want to, though."" Given that old racial-slur incident (from his cruel days) which I'm in no mood to reiterate, this may have been a bit of a risky quip for Elvis, but this version makes me think he might have meant it in earnest. Elsewhere on the remix front, ""Honeyhouse"" is a loungy incarnation of ""When I Was Cruel, Pt. 2"", sorely missing the hypnotic looped yelp that drives the original. ""Revolution Doll"", naturally, is a gutted ""Tear Off Your Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution)"". ""Peroxide Side"", in turn, remakes ""Episode of Blonde"", mercifully preserving one of the best lyrical insults of Costello's career: ""She had the attention span of warm cellophane."" And then, there are the bonuses. There's a new studio cut (""Oh Well"", conveniently describing my reaction to it), and a live rendition of ""Uncomplicated"" from Blood & Chocolate. Live chestnuts from the tour, which mark the closest Cruel Smile comes to padding, include ""Almost Blue"" and ""Watching the Detectives""-- and that, you must admit, is pretty good padding. Two versions of Charles Chaplin's ""Smile"" serve as superfluous bookends. Shit, there's even a hidden track that I discovered minutes ago during the obligatory while-reviewing spin! The highest achievement for any comp is standalone status, a shelf-life unshackled from the source. It won't happen to Cruel Smile, but as footnotes go, this one would make David Foster Wallace proud.

Land Air Sea,The Special Goodness,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5079d034d5c69bf31dc/1:1/w_160/f840b036.gif,2003-04-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7408-land-air-sea/,N.O.S.,"Wow, I've heard some third-rate Weezer knockoffs in my day, but this Special Goodness band takes the angel food. Seriously, I'd recommend Cuomo Inc. have General Geffen find them a good lawyer immediately, I think there's grounds for a lawsuit here. This shit makes Nerf Herder and Harvey Danger-- monsters of the late-nineties alterna-dial-- seem like veritable founts of originality and pep. Intern hands Mitchum slip of paper, darts out of office covering head. It reads: ""Rob, The Special Goodness is Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson's side project, it was nearly solo-recorded, with some minor assistance from a guy named Atom Willard."" I knew that already, Sarah. Really, I did, I was just...I was trying to make a point, about how little The Special Goodness deviate from Wilson's formulaic day job. Land Air Sea doesn't demonstrate this toothsome twosome are capable of much more than Weezer, either in songwriting variance or musical character. Wilson's vocals impersonate the same schoolboy quiver as Old Man Rivers-- he must do some man-behind-the-curtain understudy work on arena nights when Cuomo only feels like pantomiming. The songs, meanwhile, take the radical measure of mixing the power with the pop, in the tattooed-riff mode of recent =W=ork, rather than the overdriven-sugar of their black-and-blue early days. Wilson shows he's a firm supporter of Weezer's war against eccentricity by paralleling their descent into guitar-bass-drums hard rock sludge (and needless soloing) on the group's second record; if I didn't know better, I'd think these muddy productions were more future album demos leaked through the pores of Weezer.com. Wilson-- clearly-- is no threat to the alpha male of his other band's song craft, however, as his approach to this arena rock play-acting never lucks into reminders of past brilliance like ""Keep Fishin'"". Instead he offers lyrics weaker than the economy, and arrangements straighter than Ted Nugent. Occasional fits of catchiness on ""Life Goes By"", ""Inside Your Heart"" and ""Pay No Mind"" are lost amidst the background buzz, and a song with some promise-- ""Day in the Autumn""-- is ruined by obnoxious foibles like Wilson's pronunciation of ""autumn"" with a ""y"" at the front. ""N.F.A."" (sorry Deadheads, not a Buddy Holly cover) is the most glaring example of what passes for ingenuity with the Special Goodness, the chorus setting joyless ""ba ba bada""s against a snotty ""I'm not fucking around!"" mantra, triumphant in the belief that they're the first band to swear in a pop song. For purposes of contrast, set Land Air Sea up against the side work of Weezer's first defector, Matt Sharp's Rentals, whose debut album was a fetishistic new-wave departure from the core organization, compelling enough to (I think-- Jesus, it's still there?) hold a place on my disc shelf. Wilson can't establish an identity of his own apart from the group he swings sticks for, begging the question of why he even bothers with this, ahem, maladroit effort. Nothing on Land Air Sea indicates that-- if The Special Goodness wasn't the project of a Weezer sideman-- it'd be anything more than sporting goods for the annual Pitchfork Frisbee Golf Masters. I'm gunning for you this year, Tangari!","Wow, I've heard some third-rate Weezer knockoffs in my day, but this Special Goodness band takes the angel food ...

The Downfall of Ibliys: A Ghetto Opera,MF Grimm,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c450eb335119a49ed905/1:1/w_160/d8fc41a8.jpg,2003-04-06 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5256-the-downfall-of-ibliys-a-ghetto-opera/,MetalfaceDay by Day,"50 Cent may be mainstream hip-hop's Rasputin, but the underground has its own: MF Grimm, who came up in Manhattan with Freddie Foxxx, Kool G Rap, Rob Swift, KMD, MF Doom, Dr. Butcher and Roc Raida. Grimm was shot ten times (at once) in 1994, an attempt on his life that left him blind, deaf, comatose and almost completely paralyzed. Gradually, he was able to regain his sight, hearing, and much movement, though presently, he still requires the aid of a wheelchair to get around. In 1995, he started a record label called Day by Day Entertainment, which he currently helps run from the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island. In the 24 hours before he began serving a life sentence (stemming from conspiracy-narcotics charges), he recorded his first and only full-length record, The Downfall of Ibliys: a ghetto opera, in its entirety. Though he's still imprisoned, Grimm's label will soon release Scars & Memories (a collection of tracks from 1989-1994), which is also the title of the first song he wrote after waking from the coma. If that story isn't a testament to the importance of context, then I'm Noam Chomsky. MF Grimm's history alone makes Ibliys an imperative listen for both headz and musicologists; even more importantly, his vocal inflections are practically flipping over with subtext. When he raps, ""Human life is I/ Forgive him, God,"" on the album's thesis track, ""Time and Space"", a slight, cliffhanging, melancholy echo hangs on the ""God""; the slow rhythm and piano sample beat like the heart of regret. ""To All My Comrades"" is a clipped, grave warning to Grimm's ""fallen comrades"": ""We are greater than dogs/ We are wolves/ They can't tell us what to do/ That's why they go to the park/ And we go to the zoo,"" while invoking vivid images of slavery, and environmental destruction. ""The hunt is short today,"" he raps. ""My brothers, we are now the prey."" Grimm's tight, simple style packs punches. Though sometimes he stumbles, and the overall solid, reflective production can stray from its course (which is essentially low-key and filled with curiously delicate pianos), each syllable resonates with a cautious intimacy, at the very least. In interviews, Grimm has said that being imprisoned is the closest a person can get to being dead without actually dying. So in a way, Downfall consists of Grimm's final words before his ""death,"" which lends an added urgency to his delivery (or at least the illusion of such). In another sense, Downfall is the tale of Grimm's descent from innocence, Ibliys being the angel who fell from the heavens. Grimm takes the high road out; rather than glorifying his lifestyle, he takes the listener through a narrative descent into the underworld, touching on philosophy, love, snitches, and unity, finally ending with the uplifting ""Omega"", and its spiritual rays of keyboards, ""meant to close the gap between what is and what ought to be."" The story of a human befallen to the missteps of his own choices, both in real life and through his art, is age-old and deeply moving.","50 Cent may be mainstream hip-hop's Rasputin, but the underground has its own: MF Grimm, who came up in ...

He has a pair of headphones strapped on (cue Butthole Surfers' ""Kuntz"") and as he gazes upon the lipstick-smeared rictuses of the anorexic cheerleaders doing the splits and fisting the air, the cosmic conspiracy overwhelms him, and he sees that his entire life has led up to this moment. Flashback fade-in with vaseline-smeared lens: Our disaffected young hero sits in Ms. Walthall's homeroom at Alamo Heights Junior High, boldly asking intimate questions about her son Paul Leary's band. Hero: ""Wait, wasn't their first album really called A Brown Reason to Live? Whose peepees are those on the cover anyhow?

Log 22,Bettie Serveert,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28b9d034d5c69bf2c09/1:1/w_160/80f0298a.jpg,2003-04-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/674-log-22/,Hidden Agenda,"The most common criticism leveled at Bettie Serveert is that their songs all sound the same, and by extension that the Dutch group's albums are equally interchangeable, showing little deviation from the art-jangle formula established by the Betties' classic 1992 debut Palomine. Sure, that album was a college-radio smash, and along with Pavement, Liz Phair and Yo La Tengo, the band helped cement Matador's early-90s rep as the premiere purveyor of wiseassed, wide-eyed indie rock. But it's pretty clear, with a career now spanning ten years and five studio albums, that Bettie Serveert have remained truer to their original mission statement than their colleagues, and their albums, released like clockwork every two years or so, have always reflected that self-imposed aesthetic dogma. The band does what they do, and nothing more-- they've never made us suffer through a concept album or a period piece, and we thank them for that. Their last outing, 2000's Private Suit, attempted to recapture their Matador-era momentum by reuniting de Artsen drummer Reiner Veldman with his former bandmates, and hiring ace PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish to produce. Still, something was amiss: Private Suit's forays into orchestral pop-- the strings, the jazz-brush percussion, the melodies nicked from ABBA-- were far more convincing than the rockers, which lacked the garage-y punch and snarling feedback that made the band so charming in the first place. In the year of Modest Mouse, Sigur Rós and Kid A, Bettie Serveert never felt so quaint. Well, it must be time to change the batteries in the smoke detector and clean the guns, because here come Bettie Serveert once more with Log 22-- an album that might be considered ""transitional,"" if the band are dead-set on becoming a band that completely suck. With a bloated 60+ minute runtime and some truly misguided dabblings with e-bows and saxophones, Log 22 presents Bettie Serveert at their most self-indulgent. And it's not pretty. The distraction of singer Carol van Dyk's myriad side projects is partially to blame-- Chitlin Fooks' Stoffel Verlackt drums, plays bass, and arranges horns on Log 22, and Fooks/Shadowgraphic City frontman Pascal Deweze has a vocal cameo. Jeroen Blankert (of improvisational jazz-punkers Munzruh) replaces the more versatile Veldman behind the drumkit; even longtime bassist Herman Bunskoeke is pushed aside for a good third of the album, leaving guitarist Peter Visser and van Dyk to go Dutch with most of the songwriting. The personnel changes and risky, overly ambitious material, in conjunction with Visser's decision to produce the album himself, result in an album that is most generously described as ""random."" Log 22 is sporadically peppered with the five-to-eight minute epics that characterized the Lamprey period and the shorter, half-baked pop confections that padded Dust Bunnies. In the latter category, there's ""Not Coming Down"", an overdriven two-minute sketch that barely sticks around long enough to register a melody that features a vague slipstream of lyrical non-sequiturs. Or the overly aggressive ""Smack"", typical of the everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink production-- a knotty clusterfuck of sampled whistling, stuttered percussion, noise, and three dueling layers of van Dyk's amped-up vocals. But the album's most egregious sins are, not coincidentally, its most adventurous. Take the bleating, maudlin ""Have a Heart"", which contains the lyrics, ""Can we synchronize our souls?"" and, ""Life can be so easy, like tonguing candy out your molars"" (yuck?) and devolves in a brassy din of sax solos. The treacly ""Captain of Maybe"" pits the spacy wail of an e-bow against vaguely nautical flute-like synths and discordant sine waves undulating in and out of the mix as van Dyk sing-drones stream-of-consciousness dreck like, ""I'm drawing a circle on this invisible map of our lives, placing thumbtacks on all the dreams we've ever had."" Even potentially good songs are pulled under by poor aesthetic choices: the meandering, overly arty verses of opener ""Wide-Eyed Fools"", for instance, seem grafted from a completely different song than the explosive, satisfying choruses. The band's simply not wound tight enough to pull it off. Likewise with the eight-minute-plus ""White Dogs"", which begins promisingly by segueing from a chamber-pop prologue into a chugging, Velvets-style groove, but van Dyk's vocals and the drumming feel overly mannered, especially in this halcyon age of Interpols and Strokes. Oh, by the way, that one ends with a sax solo, too. If you still think all Bettie Serveert songs sound alike, or still cling to Palomine like a fraying security blanket, look no further than ""De Diva"", exactly the kind of wordy, pleasant-enough slow-burner that recalls those halcyon early 90s, sans-freshness. Likewise with ""Cut 'n' Dried"", a new recording of a Private Suit-era song with a thick syrup of strings, jazzy drums and drunken piano that sounds, well, just like an outtake from Private Suit. On the other hand, Bettie Serveert make a few departures so radical they're barely recognizable at all: ""Certainlie"", a torchy duet with Chitlin Fooks' Deweze, hails from the same mediocre prom-song planet as that Sarah Shannon solo album. The jammy, vaguely U2-ish sketch ""Given"" sucks six minutes from your life with little more than a five-note melody and a go-nowhere drumbeat. But Log 22's most shocking left turn comes with album closer ""The Love-In"", a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of Shania Twain and ""Lovefool""-era Cardigans with Visser chugging away on a wah pedal like he's auditioning for Austin Powers' backup band. This is precisely the type of drivel that could end up on the bestselling soundtrack to some Adam Sandler vehicle and become Bettie Serveert's Big Hit Single, to be begrudgingly played in encores for decades of grueling reunion tours. ""Don't try to fix a thing that isn't broke,"" van Dyk sings in ""De Diva"", and it'd be nice if she'd follow her own advice. Though their relevance has clearly faded over the years, the once-dependable indie warhorses of Bettie Serveert have finally delivered an out-and-out turkey, simply by not being themselves. At their loosest and most rules-free (circa Lamprey, let's say), Bettie Serveert's energy can be infectious, liberating; here they just come off as underpracticed and unfocused. At best, Log 22 is acceptable-- at its worst, unlistenable. Anybody got a match?","The most common criticism leveled at Bettie Serveert is that their songs all sound the same, and by\n\ extension ...

No Silver/No Gold,Baptist Generals,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2115e6ef95969320324/1:1/w_160/5521f596.gif,2003-04-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11661-no-silverno-gold/,Sub Pop,"The barn's empty and sinking. You see the sky through pauses in the roof; otherwise the wind's muffled. There's bird shit everywhere, and you begin gathering it with your feet into a single pile. You notice that when shit mixes with dust it looks like flour on wet dough. Next you recline across two rusted lawn chairs, unwinding. You sip lemon water and listen to the sky for airplanes taking off and landing: they follow twisting plots, surprising arcs, and pause where they can, rest a while, ascend. Then there's a sound you thought existed only at night in the suburbs, when it's completely still and all you can hear is the hum of the freeway in the distance. My friend has a theory of non-perfect beauty. In her mind, it's worth getting obsessed over uneven teeth, weak coffee in roadside cafes, unintentionally lopsided bangs, sweaters with holes held together by safety pins. The above, I guess, is my application of her theory, but it's also a response to the Baptist Generals, a band who embodies broke-ass gorgeousness in the form of a rowdy soul-sickness not easy to fake. In the world of these four weary Denton, TX guys who buy their equipment at pawnshops, people want things so badly they chase after them until their feet are bloody stumps. Or they pack their one bag then forget to run at all, as if mired deep to the knees in a Southern Gothic dream. The Baptist Generals have been recording in one form or another since 1998. No Silver/No Gold, their debut LP for Sub Pop, is hinged together with a claustrophobic insularity I remember detailed so fully on The Grifters' brilliant One Sock Missing, and rarely after that. The music is fragile and spiritual, sodden and boisterous. It's as if the players are seeking out loosely sewn faultlines while trying to balance decay and redemption and to escape a permanent rupture in either direction. Recorded on an eight-track in someone's garage, the album begins sparely with ""Ay Distress"", a hobo spiritual showcasing Chris Flemmons' cracked-up voice. His is the pained screech of an outsider, one who seemingly doesn't give a fuck about hitting notes, who instead plows around, and through his bastardized ABC's, still somehow gets the thing right, wrapping every fragment in a godly mist of tangled, slipshod estrangement. While reminiscent of the chirping yowls of Refrigerator's Allen Callaci, the closest analogue is Roky Erickson's post-breakdown solo recordings. And that's high praise. ""Ay Distress"" shares the 3:00 a.m. bedroom vibe of Refrigerator's ""One of Everything"", the lovely opener on 1996's Anchors of Bleed. Here, in Flemmons' calloused hands, it's a lullaby to one who continually misses the song in their heart. Flemmons nails the words as they fall and spit and piss around him, but when he reaches the near-end of the rhyme, his cellphone starts singing, too. This interruption breaks the spell, pushing him into a series of real-life histrionics: extremely frustrated shouts of 'goddamn it' and 'oh-h-h-h god' (I imagine him rolling his eyes to an empty heaven). And then he throws the phone or some other inanimate junk and finally, before the tape's cut, he smashes himself against a door. Though it isn't the best way to end a lullaby, the next track, ""Alcohol (Turn & Fall)"", offers a solution for falling asleep when large men are tossing themselves against walls around you: turn off the light, get drunk, sweat it out. There are so many good songs here, and each is difficult to recount by quoting lyrics or offering descriptions of certain elements. Though it's Flemmons' croon that strikes you initially, the band playing with him is equally dead-on: guitars sound like they're being snapped, the drums are shaggy-dog and really fuzzy. There seem to be buzzsaws, and the keyboards, slide guitar, and theremin are always somewhere in the distance catching breaths before chiming loudly into the general mess. The songs threaten to blow out your speakers purely with melancholy and anger. The Baptist Generals seem to know you can't ever really return to some cleaned-up state. And, really, most of us are too poor to afford simulated perfection anyhow. So you learn to deal with your injuries, make sure they're accounted for, and if you're lucky then you find some powerful and pure way to express the things that are most fucked.","The barn's empty and sinking.

The Ugly Organ,Cursive,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c45e6ef95969320dfe/1:1/w_160/e41a4483.jpg,2003-04-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1698-the-ugly-organ/,Saddle Creek,"Hey you. Yeah, you, holding a copy of A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius with an Adaptation ticket stub for a bookmark. You're obviously hip to the new sensation sweeping the nation: meta-fiction! Maurice the Meta-fiction Moose defines the genre as ""post-modern art conscious of and reveling in its own limitations"" and it's in full bloom everywhere from the bookstore to the Cineplex, with TV-show characters talking to the camera in-between. Hell, even record reviews do it-- I crafted a densely mirrored concept review around this latest release from Cursive, but it turned out to be too pretentious for prime-time (watch for it in my forthcoming collection of short stories about famous Omahaians). One media form yet to be infiltrated by the gimmick of self-reference, however, is music, partly because it's more than a little difficult to do in a three-minute pop song, and partly because Jon Spencer ruined it for everybody. But Cursive frontman Kasher is willing to give it the old college try on The Ugly Organ, and somehow manages to do it with a minimum of pretension while simultaneously livening up the crusted emo messenger bag. Cursive is no stranger to the concept album; their last full-length, Domestica, was a song-cycle dealing with the critical entropy of a dying marriage, and its warm reception seems to have motivated Kasher to stay in the storyteller role. The ""plot"" of The Ugly Organ, such as it is, revolves around loose themes of fallout remorse and hollow sexual meandering, the latter summed up in the double meaning of the album title. Appropriately, then, recurring organ figures occasionally torment Kasher's protagonist mid-song, while recent Cursive recruit Gretta Cohn's cello grants everything the epic quality it so desperately calls for. The material fueled by this concept is pretty easy to spot, bearing woe-packed titles like ""The Recluse"", ""Driftwood"", or ""Bloody Murderer"", and aside from the occasional Diaryland line (""My ego's like my stomach/ It keeps shitting what I feed it""), it's a solid record for those without severe emo allergies. ""The Recluse"" is melancholy and full of ornate note flurries like early Joan of Arc, and the eerie ""Driftwood"" creeps along like ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" beneath Cohn's bowed swooshes. An entire LP of this slumped-shoulder soul-searching would get pretty tired, however; a fact that even Kasher seemed to realize as he browsed back over the sad-sack lyrics he'd penned. Enter the meta: a handful of songs wherein Kasher either ups the self-loathing ante by both expressing his sadness and further expressing his sadness about his sadness, or brilliantly anticipates the kneejerk reactions of the emo-phobic critical community (not here, of course, no, never!). Opening the album with the couplet, ""And now we proudly present/ Songs perverse and songs of lament,"" Kasher makes a habit of anticipating the snide commentary of his hatas and beating them to the punch. ""Art Is Hard"" assails his own band with the biting stab ""cut it out/ Your self inflicted pain/ Is getting too routine/ The crowds are catching on/ To the self-inflicted song,"" and he styles ""Butcher the Song"" ambiguously enough to make vain critics betcha think he's talking about them, don't we, don't we: ""I'm writing songs to entertain/ But these people, they just want pain."" Wisely, Kasher also attaches these masochistic episodes to the strongest songs of the album: ""Red Handed Slight of Hand"" being all raw anthem like Desaparecidos without the limited understanding of the geopolitical landscape, and ""Art Is Hard"" using Cohn to her fullest as the rest of the band emulates her fierce bowing while she rips out a buzzsaw melody like a Dick Dale cello composition. Even ""Butcher the Song"" which turns on a sour riff repeated ad nauseam, has a sort of, well, nauseating effect that emphasizes the self-sickened words. With the strength of the meta-emo material, plus ""The Recluse"" and ""Driftwood"", occupying the first half of the album, it's easy to get caught up in The Ugly Organ's bold aims. Unfortunately, the album is too top-heavy to be seaworthy, the back end full of Fugazi knockoffs and half a song stretched out to ten minutes in a forced attempt at a showstopping finale (""Staying Alive""-- they'd be better off with a Bee Gees cover). The fact that Kasher, in a toe-dipping test of this meta stuff, already called himself out as a Mackaye acolyte on Cursive's last EP can't save the likes of ""Sierra"" and ""Gentleman Caller"" from my seen-it-all scorn. Bah. Still, a solid side A is enough to make The Ugly Organ an emo album (gasp!) on Saddle Creek (yipes!) that I'm not ashamed to admit a conditional liking for. Should Kasher decide to continue along the concept album path, it would perhaps do him good to study himself some Pedro the Lion-- and he might want to steer clear of the meta from here on out-- I hear from New York that unironic is the new ironic. But for twenty minutes of The Ugly Organ, what he's got now is enough to make an idea that sounds, on paper, a million ways wrong and a shoo-in for Most Self-Indulgent Album of the Year work reasonably well. Here's hoping he draws someone less homely than Nicholas Cage for the film version.","Hey you.

His 2001 debut for the Leaf label, Start Breaking My Heart, was blissed-out pastoral IDM that warranted Boards of Canada comparisons. Then he went off and made some clubby tracks that dabbled in UK garage. And now, with his second full-length Up in Flames, he's chucked the laptop, dug the analog gear out of the dumpster, and recorded a 60s-worshiping indie pop record, complete with sun-kissed harmonies, layered acoustic guitars, Farfisa organ drones and glockenspiel. You have to admire the chutzpah. Seriously, I can't remember hearing this stark a contrast between consecutive albums in a long time, maybe ever. The sound of Up in Flames is key. In contrast to the world of modern computer-based music, where noise is precisely controlled and each layered instrument can be mentally plucked from the mix and examined, Up in Flames is a colossal field of unified sound. The sheets of acoustic guitar and organ wrap themselves around the booming drums (mostly acoustic kits tuned to the full timbre of the Hal Blaine era) and you can't pry them apart. The obvious production inspirations are Phil Spector and Brian Wilson, both of whom arranged songs during a time when men had more ideas than available tracks; producers were forced to cheat in those days-- to bounce and to compress-- and the best records to come out of that period were massive and unknowable as a result. Up in Flames, whether by choice or necessity, has the same warm feeling of ramshackle Wagner. When it came time to record, precision was clearly a goal far down the list. Despite their obvious 60s references, most of the tracks on Up in Flames aren't really songs in the traditional sense. Instead of prominent verse/chorus/bridge structures, we hear a series of swells and contractions. Snaith has a good understanding of the tricks and techniques of pop's biggest and best moments, the moments that stop your breath during the pause just before the big chorus, and he set out to make an album filled with them. ""Hendrix with Ko"" (which is one of a couple songs featuring the voice of Koushik Ghosh) has some lyrics, but most of what you hear are just day-glo bah-bah-bah's that serve as suspension cabling to carry the track from one section to the next, through the Mamas & Papas homage to an electronic coda that's a rare memory of Manitoba's prior incarnation. ""Jacknuggeted"" has a similar arc, but reminds me more of Neil Diamond in his Bang Records days-- all ""Cherry Cherry"" handclaps and stiff-but-funky D/A/G acoustic strumming-- before another digital breakdown brings in sputtering breaks that would have had Greenwich & Barry lunging for the ""stop"" button. As tied to the 60s as it is, Up in Flames can also be described as ""psychedelic."" The way the absolutely huge ""Bijoux"" swirls with Wilsonian harmonies, layers of chords, music boxes, percussion explosions and orchestral samples, I swear it almost takes on a Boredoms cast-- not in terms of aggression, but as a primal celebration of the possibility of sound. ""Kid You'll Move Mountains"" is similarly dense, but this one sends a snaking soprano saxophone through the changes. A tenor sax erupts in the latter part of ""Skunks"", tearing off into a series of riffs that add the same sort of ""free"" element to the track that Stereolab incorporated into ""Fuses"". The fuzzy ""Crayon"", meanwhile, sounds like Múm covering The Jesus & Mary Chain's ""Taste of Cindy"". If Snaith were to follow the trend of most electronic producers, he'd have changed his alias for this project, the way Atom Heart does with Señor Coconut-- though I'll grant that there's some conceptual overlap: Up in Flames certainly has a wide-eyed and affirmative outlook, and features titles like ""Every Time She Turns Around It's Her Birthday"" to go with Start Breaking My Heart's ""Children Play Well Together"", and there are a few brief moments where Snaith's IDM head pops out of the fabric. But that's as far as it goes; the two albums aren't in the same universe. Is Snaith confused? Maybe he wants it all. Maybe he doesn't know what he wants. But because Up in Flames is such a great record, we win either way. ","Something must have happened to Manitoba's Dan Snaith. His 2001 debut for the Leaf label, Start Breaking My Heart ...

Data 80,Data 80,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a7b1335d7bf1699323/1:1/w_160/6f534a76.jpg,2003-04-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2175-data-80/,Force Tracks,"Some music is better in small doses. Data 80, a new project from multi-dimensional Swedish producer Håkan Lidbo, had a song called ""Love Was Made for Two"" on Force Tracks' excellent Digital Disco compilation. A catchy 80s-style synthpop song with vocodered vocals and nimble programming, the song nicely held down the sillier end of dance-pop spectrum covered by the compilation. But 46 minutes of music in the ""Love Was Made for Two"" style is a bit much, and that's what Data 80's self-titled debut has to offer. One of the problems is that the ""Love Was Made for Two"" template is followed almost exactly on about half the tracks. It's the same vocal processing, same tempo, same basic arrangement, and sometimes (as on ""Baby, I Can Forgive"") damn near the same melody. The overuse of the vocoder is what really gets to me. I have a love/hate relationship with processed vocals at this point. Sometimes vocoders are used in a way that absolutely kills, and sometimes I can't get over how tired they sound. Okay, I get it, it's futuristic pop and you sound like a robot. Just like Kraftwerk did thirty years ago. I follow. The best tracks here offer something different. ""Open Skies"" reminds me a little of Dntel's ""The Dream of Evan and Chan"" in the way it channels the innocence of 80s electropop. Tellingly, it has clean vocals, and while the pitch seems just a bit unsteady a times, the singing sounds as fresh as a spring breeze when heard from inside the chorus of cylons. Also strong and clear is ""Don't Believe Me"" which, with a woman on lead, sounds quite Stereolab, mirroring the sort of electronic elegance they achieved on Emperor Tomato Ketchup. Rounding out the decent stuff, the skeletal instrumental ""The Boy Who Grew Up to Be a Boy"" sounds a bit like Yellow Magic Orchestra, with a nice mixture of thin, dinky sounds and more organic squiggles. Even better is the instrumental I believe is called ""Every Pretty Girl's Dilemma"" (my lack of confidence here comes from the fact that the tracklist on the back of the sleeve doesn't match the one the inside), which features the percussive, popcorny Moog we all fell in love with in the 70s. After that, well... ""Love Was Made For Two"" is still pretty fair, although another listen or two and I might get my fill. All told, Data 80 seems like a mixtape/DJ set sort of project-- good when sandwiched between other tracks from other artists, good on a 12-inch, not so good on a full-length CD.","Some music is better in small doses.

Racetothebottom,Andre Afram Asmar,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a122b1335d7bf16981a6/1:1/w_160/83bd32c5.jpg,2003-04-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/322-racetothebottom/,Mush,"Very few record reviews contain much personal information, and that makes sense: what you care about is the music, and I'd just assume the occasional hatemail remain as vague as possible. But for you to appreciate the following, I need to tell you that I'm a slightly geeky Jewish male with an ambiguous relationship to Zionism and an aversion to second-hand smoke. Maybe my left-of-center bias in the current xenophobic climate should make for another rubber-stamp approval of Andre Afram Asmar's first desert-dub release on esoteric hip-hop label Mush. But let me put it this way: I am certain that at this very moment, this album is playing in dorm rooms where oppressed-person status, long attention span and sturdy lungs are a prerequisite for entry. That's not an ad hominem; every time I put this album on at home, I feel like I'm hanging out in a place where my kind is not wanted. The Palest-afarian photo collage in the liner notes reminds me of the walls of those oppressive college suites I naively thought I should enjoy chilling in. And though the streams of stoner-speak that open the first track, and the accompanying co-op basement drum circle, had me squirming right off the bat, the quality of the mix did keep my attention. But ""Camel Clutch"", in which singer Elias is completely drowned out by a mess of reverbed percussion, is a sign of failures to come. Sure enough, for the rest of the album any stray musicality gets drowned out by a rhythmic mess so moist-- nay, sodden-- that I can hardly hear myself hate it. Is this what Andre means when he calls himself ""the mugician""? More to the point, what is it about Asmar's mix of unarticulated victim politics, para-Rastafarianism, and spiritual exhaustion that I find so hauntingly annoying? It's one of the more familiar brands of college narcissism on the West Coast, and I should be used to it by now. Maybe more disturbing is that Asmar uses his Middle Eastern provenance not as a source of musical ideas-- Arabic vocal samples are mixed just like anything else into the loose dub textures-- but as a license to fairly drip with self-indulgence, as carte blanche for songs that don't go anywhere, built from stale beats, inane mantras, and extended gurglings. To make matters worse, someone in the control room is dead set on putting everything through the same cheap delay pedal, like the wild world of water sports without the wild, or the sports. Just wet. Capable experiments in mixing crop up once we leave the desert for a more tropical feel: straight-ahead ""Scientism"", for example, starts with a clean, guitar-driven hook, then makes its way from reggae-in-the-club to dub-in-the-headphones with an uncharacteristic smoothness. In ""Duniagariba"", traditional North African drumming melts into a braying hurricane, then congeals back into traditional drumming, deftly. Taken as a whole, though, these aimless jams herald no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub. Even Edward Said would nod off in no time. This is no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub, just the same old aimless weed-soaked jams.

Rock Egypt,Salk Vacchin,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a347ea9e61561daa4c38/1:1/w_160/631bad78.gif,2003-04-02 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6985-rock-egypt/,God Mountain,"If the number of bands fronted by doll-voiced Japanese girls in the Pitchfork archive seems disproportionately high (Melt Banana, eX-Girl, Pizzicato 5, Deerhoof, Cibo Matto, Shonen Knife), I ask you to look at the alternative: Yoko Ono. This isn't to say that there aren't hundreds of female singers from the Far East who don't possess a somewhat more powerful caterwaul-- some of their bands are even in the archive, check Gaji and Koenjihyakkei for starters-- but I get the distinct impression Japanese record companies believe Barbie-toned girls are what we want. And you know, who's to say they're wrong? Cute is as cute squeaks, no? The only problem comes when you realize that not only do all these bands cause hearing damage after more than three songs, it just feels...like I'm perpetuating some old Japanese dude's ingrained sexism by buying into those voices. n And before the Oprah Brigade chimes in, yes, I realize that me looking for sexism in what is, by all accounts, shiny, fun, golden sound is probably a sexist move on my part. Above all, it helps that bands like Deerhoof and Melt Banana sound so completely in their own world that only the most callous East Coast scenesters could reduce them to pop-culture gimmicks. In a perfect world, nobody would ever look for hidden catches (and other excuses to feel guilty about liking their music), but to these bands' credit, what stereotypes they might prompt are rendered almost sterile by their enthusiasm and originality. n So, without further ado, I introduce yet another band to add to the pile: Okinawa's Salk Vacchin. Rubber ducky voices: check. Short, Casio-dominated songs: check. Full of spunk and quirk and a lot of other words ending in k: check. Despite all of that, have you heard this record before? Not really. Even a little? Well, maybe if you heard some of that Picky Picnic record I wrote about in Pitchfork's Found Sound 2002 feature (and if you did, where's that $200 French LP of bathroom sink murders you said you were sending me?). This trio, produced by cross-dressing Svengali of the avant-garde Hoppy Kamiyama, comes on like the technophile obsessed Yellow Magic Orchestra, if they hadn't the budget for anything but homemade demos detailing a fascination with hill people and sugar substitutes. n ""Sable Tour"" waltzes out of the gate with the crash and rumble of an ultra-fake snare drum roll. The trio (Saeko Maesato, Megumi Maesato and Kiroko Gima) repeats a chant (in Japanese, except for a whole bunch of ""yeah yeah yeahs"") while bells fall down stairwells and dime store electro brings the pep like cotton on candy. And it's not that they sound sweet, necessarily, but there is a certain innocence at work, as if these people would be making this stuff regardless of whether an audience was out there or not. ""Maltese World"" takes the waltz feel into the lullaby realm; the singers perform a mini-canon with flutes and piano-- and I swear my Mom bought me that keyboard when I was 15. n The more energetic stuff tends to fall closer in line with ""traditional"" Japanese dadaist-rock. ""Saccharin"" is maniac disco-trance, featuring non-stop chatter from the singers, one of them always making sure to occupy the high-range hiccup parts. The title track crams in three or four beginner level piano etudes, some session funk bass, robotic pogo-vocals and just enough DIY post-punk ineptitude to qualify as some kind of shock therapy for feyer-than-thou Soft Cell fans. As for ""Monsieur Hee Hoo"", it merely sounds like Boredoms genetically re-engineered as the Powerpuff Girls. People, do the math. n Of course, I'm under no naïve impression that folks won't head into a CD like Rock Egypt with presupposed visions of cute lil' spaz chix dancing in their heads. Don't make me rear the S word again, children. And I don't think I'll need to; if anything, Salk Vacchin prove what funny, strange things are possible when three amateurs are caught ""messing around with a cheap lo fi minidisc recorder"" (to quote Kamiyama). With a career catalog of just over 26-minutes, my biggest complaint is that so far, they're a tease.","If the number of bands fronted by doll-voiced Japanese girls in the Pitchfork archive seems disproportionately high (Melt Banana, eX-Girl ...

Antenna,Cave In,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55fc0084474cd0c06db/1:1/w_160/ffbeed62.jpg,2003-04-01 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1363-antenna/,RCA,"I won't bullshit you, partly because my congested head is killing me, and partly because you deserve better: this is a commercial album. Massachusetts' Cave In might have been an indie metal band-- with considerable muscle to back up their tunefulness and more riffs than Rush managed in the 90s-- but now, they're hardcore. Which is to say they're pop. Which is to say, if you can't stand melodies, stay clear of Antenna. While all of this might seem obvious since they're on RCA, and their CD can only be played using \x93extended copy protection music player\x94 (which they've helpfully included), but the real giveaway is the immediacy of the hooks, and the clean mega-compressed mastering. In short, if your favorite bands aren't played between Audioslave and Foo Fighters on modern rock radio, Cave In probably isn't one of them. All of that said, Antenna is hardly a bad record. Almost every tune features a melody or riff practically guaranteed to stick in your head at least once after hearing it (or have you squirming to avoid it), and vocalist Steve Brodsky thankfully resists the omnipresent Cobain-cum-Vedder-cum-Cornell yelp of the tried and true \x93alternative\x94 lead male. Brodsky's playing-- while not terribly distinct-- always injects the right amount of grunge-wallop or Edge-y atmospherics; in a way, Cave In remind me of a modern-day Blue Oyster Cult, in that their \x93heavy\x94 music never really comes close to masking their considerable pop songwriting skill (Brodsky's voice is also of a similarly nasal, tenor quality as BOC's Donald \x93Buck Dharma\x94 Roeser). So, if I haven't scared you away by comparing them to dinosaurs from the 70s-90s... Opener \x93Stained Silver\x94 wastes no time in dropping the radio riffs, by way of Radiohead's \x93Pyramid Song\x94 (they also reference the \x93Paranoid Android\x94 breakdown on the next track, \x93Inspire\x94). ""Silver""'s flailing beats quickly make room for the oft-harmonized verse vocal, doubled by guitar; it's important to note insofar as the doubling makes it easier to pick out the melody on a crappy car stereo, for people who might only hear you once, during the afternoon drive. Dispensing with my cynical, rockist commentary, the melody is worth remembering, and the mass of guitars during the chorus carry their share of muscular momentum. \x93Anchor\x94 might be as easily dismissed: it's a squeaky clean Nirvana rip, but its energy is contagious, the chorus is pro-level catchy and the bridge really ties the room together. Typical of Antenna, it's a well-written song given the major label sheen, which explains the props in mass-market alternarags like Spin. While my descriptions ring death-knells for a lot of Pitchfork readers, I can only reiterate that awkwardly ambitious intent doesn't necessarily equal sucking. The bad news is to be expected: some of this stuff is too formulaic after a few plays. Except for two wildcards (the gentle acoustic ballad \x93Beautiful Sox94 and the lengthy cosmic jaunt \x93Seafrost\x94), you can generally count on the band adhering to verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-repeat structure, replete with those hallowed LOUD-soft-LOUD dynamics. Brodsky's voice is hardly grating, but just like BOC, I'm not sure Cave In features the world's most interesting, nuanced singing, and again, I have to cast my vote against nu-rock's maxed-out mix preferences, making every moment on the disc a peak, which effectively makes every moment part of a monolithic, dulling experience. Still, if there is a way to make decent radio rock outside of Thursday and Queens of the Stone Age, Cave In are doing it now.","I won't bullshit you, partly because my congested head is killing me, and partly because you deserve better: this ...

Elephant,The White Stripes,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa195e6ef9596932151a/1:1/w_160/fb7c898c.jpg,2003-04-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8652-elephant/,V2Third Man,"Church's Fried Chicken now sits at the crossroads of Highway 49 and Highway 61 in Clarksdale, Mississippi like an unaware, prefabricated neon mausoleum. While you can no longer barter your soul to Beelzebub for guitar-picking prowess, The Man will gladly exchange your eternal being for a place on the fryer and a hairnet. Or one may just opt for the Sweet Biscuit Crunchers and some Purple Pepper Sauce for a dollar. The tragicomic irony of a fast food joint squatting on the Valhalla of Delta Blues out-tarnishes our collective lore more than the Bus Stop of Gethsemane and adjoining Mount of Olives Hotel. And when you toss one of those sugary Sweet Biscuit Crunchers or gooey Honey-Butter Biscuits into your fat maw, you can let your mind drift to the thinly veiled sexual euphemisms of the blues, where biscuit almost certainly means ""vagina."" The Blues had been raped, exploited, stolen, diluted, rediscovered, reforgotten, and rendered meaningless countless times long before the Russian Mafia kept hot on the heels of the Blues Brothers 2000 and the House of Blues primarily showcased Wu-Tang side projects and Godsmack. Now, nearly a century after its birth, a non-ironic, post-Jon Spencer form of the Blues has risen again, ever so stubbornly and somnolently-- and naturally, it's being led by a couple of white kids. Jack White ahem not only namedrops Robert Johnson, he covers him. Summons him. Wears the same little derby as him. And on ""Ball and Biscuit"", the album-stretching stomper of the White Stripes' fourth album, White moans, ""Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar."" It's all too plainly clear what he means. What's less clear on the track (and the rest of Elephant), however, is just what Jack White intends. Certainly, one of his goals is to simply Rock, which his shit-hot guitar solos do bombastically; those Sears-Roebucks pickups buzz and screech like atomic harmonicas on the album's best songs. But beyond this, White struggles to tenuously weld a growing amalgam of contradictions and genre experiments with a veneer of schtick, persona and Fonzie cool, while Meg's pancake-handed drumming drips solvent over the whole experiment. The problem is that Jack White aims to honor his diverse heroes with too limited a palette; it's like paying tribute to Edward Hopper, Ansel Adams, Robert Colescott, and Georgia O'Keeffe in mural with a foot-pump-operated Wagner Power Painter and buckets of red and white. ""Hypnotize"" valiantly strives for The Stooges, while ""Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine"" gives up four fingers to a butcher's knife on the altar of Led Zeppelin. But Jack White is no Jim Page (nor Osterberg), and suggestions to the contrary will earn you an explanation at the end of the Questionable Musical Taste line on judgment day. Meg White, meanwhile, pleads to her man on ""In the Cold, Cold Night"" like a coy Mo Tucker or Georgia Hubley-- more so than take-no-sass Patsy Cline or Dusty in Memphis. Linty in Arkadelphia, perhaps. The White Stripes' two strengths lie in their understanding of the physics of ""rock 'n' roll"" and, on the opposite end of the spectrum, their ability to craft a beautiful little boy/girl ditty. As for the former, guitars kick in at the mathematically precise moment. Drums drop out of the atmosphere in their window of opportunity, only to knock you back like a returning pendulum. For the latter, ""You've Got Her in Your Pocket"", like ""We're Going to Be Friends"", makes one wish this whole new Foghat rock thing would blow over and make way for the Badfinger/Splinter/Fairport Convention revival that's been long overdue. And therein lies the contradiction of The White Stripes: How do you combine the shit-hot with the ""twee?"" Elephant's shortcomings suggests the enterprise is futile. Similarly, the naïveté of Meg's playing deflates any Big Rock aspirations. The child-like imagery of candy and Howdy Doody shirts renders Howlin' Wolf-like braggadocio transparent. More importantly, the Stripes' multilayered, contrived personas-- both within individual songs and as the greater public face of the band-- fogs sincerity. The useless, cheeky album closer, ""It's True That We Love One Another"", sums up this last obstacle. Piling on the Meta like Charlie Kaufman scripted the lyrics, this hoedown toys with the Jack and Meg relationship ""mystery"" that was made abundantly clear in the 459 press articles on The White Stripes over the last two years, while throwing Holly Golightly into a threesome of unfunny winks. When Jack sings, ""I've got your number written in the back of my Bible,"" a theoretically rich image from a much better unrealized song is wasted on an in-joke. The album title refers to the endangered animal's brute power and less honored instinctual memory for dead relatives. Essentially, The White Stripes admit to the contradictions in their music, but run through their hall of fame like a mad pachyderm. In a climate of kitchen-tinkered, designer cuisine pop, the album offers buckets of batter-fried guitar crunch. On tracks like ""Black Math"" and ""Little Acorns"", the grease and grunge of cheap guitar ingredients cover slim-pickings from the songwriting chicken. People who just want some fried poultry can drive-thru and get a quick fix, but underneath, the spirits of the heroes wait for a true seance.","Church's Fried Chicken now sits at the crossroads of Highway 49 and Highway 61 in Clarksdale, Mississippi\n\ like ...

Even their name is contemptuously, lazily vulgar. That air of cool detachment drives everything that's great about this record: it rocks but doesx92t show off, and it's so direly fashion-unconscious that no matter how many jittery rhythms and caustic lyrics they deploy, they're never trendy about their post-punk leanings. Il Dito and Other Gestures (""il dito"" is Italian for ""the finger"") is the In Out's fourth full-length; it follows a stretch where the band shrank to a trio, switched labels, played only intermittent local gigs-- oh, and toured Europe with Sebadoh. But in spite of all the transitions, the new line-up already sounds taut and engrossing. Singer and guitarist Todd Nudelman doesx92t have an immediately striking voice: slightly nasal and not at all powerful, his cool delivery covers a confident, masculine charisma. It may be a cheap shot to compare them to The Fall, but you can hear a likeness in Nudelmax92s implied sneer and indifferently articulate lyrics, criticizing hedonism or commanding us to \x93auscultate\x94 him. But he also flashes a sense of humor when he role-plays through \x93In Pursuit of You\x94, an almost cheeseball Afghanistan spy drama: \x93I tried you on the phone/ The lines had all been cut/ By me-- I forgot!/ It was me!\x94 shouted while the band feverishly plows ahead. As a guitarist he plays it just as cool, ripping off the occasional solo but mainly locking in with the rhythm section. Bassist Andy Abrahamson and new drummer Eric Boomhower are brutally fast together, from the drilling repetition of \x93Trapped Body (Auscultate Me)\x94 to the patter they keep up right under convoluted lyrics like \x93hedonism haunts our quality time.\x94 But then they slow down the pace: Abrahamsox92s basslines own several tracks, aiding the casual swagger of \x93Sense and Withdrawal\x94 and the mesmerizing, near-droning pace of \x93The Turning\x94. He makes guest singer Ilona Virostek sound that much huskier, and he's the foil for Nudelmax92s cool reserve. It can take a few listens to appreciate how wide-ranging the songs are, skittering through one, then playing glowing keyboards on an old blues cover. Everything hangs together; unlike their hipper contemporaries, the In Out spend more time nailing the material than getting in your face. The band will probably do nothing to promote the album-- they probably wox92t tour your home town or college campus-- but this is one of the tightest, freshest, truly Underground releases so far this year.","On the back cover of the In Out\x92s latest album, these three guys look genuinely bored as they pose ...

Our feigned grasp of subcultural machinations will finally bite us in our collective posterior, and the staff will be divided. Certain blowhards will refuse to fess up the whereabouts of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and like-minded dissidents, while others of us will cooperate and be given star-spangled clip-on ties and badges that say Justice Consultant, or Liberty Advisor. I plan to provide the feds with insight into the degenerate minds of every undergrounder except the former bandleader of Nation of Ulysses, Cupid Car Club, The Make-Up, and Weird War. He now refers to himself only as ""Svenonius,"" perhaps to drive home his exalted, totemic status. I will run interference on my gub'mint minders by playing his new band Scene Creamers' album I Suck on That Emotion. See? Eye bags. See? Gerbils. This ain't political; it's get-it-on-core. You know, original booty-call soundtrack material, the stuff you pump in the background while you tell that low-priority crush that you're ""kind of drunk"" and ""can't sleep"" and ""don't [sigh] really know what you're doing tonight."" Some of the suits will even tap their sensibly-loafered toes to the Creamers' spiraling, spare anglo-funk: Guitarist Alex Minoff (Golden, Six Finger Satellite) constantly riffs via a floorful of pedals that wah-flange-phase his every almost-indulgent flourish. Longtime Svenonius sidekick Michelle Mae navigates her bass with understated panache, and Blake Brunner's stop/start retro-military drums perfectly replace Make-Up-artist Steve Gamboa's more skillful, but also fill-happy, work. (The file on Brunner is thin but incriminating: he interviewed former Royal Trux and Weird War wandering guitarist Neil Hagerty in 2000, which raises some paranoid eyebrows, since Minoff was in Golden with Truxer Jon Theodore.) I'll almost get away with my united front, because a superficial listen to the Creamers begs the question of why Svenonius' dapper ass spent the Clinton-giddy 90s shrouding his gospel-punk party-jams in neo-Marxist rhetoric, only to ""go horn-dog"" when his D.C. neighbors' geostrategery got all ballistic. I'll admit that some of the change-your-bedsheet material is rich, particularly ""Session Man"" (a randy take on musician-for-hire whoredom), ""Housework for Three"" (possibly a menage-ode to the classic pine-scented porn fantasy), and ""Wet Paint"" (about an art student, with the slurred yeah-times-three refrain, ""looks the same, but it ain't""). These songs prove that Svenonius could find a double entendre in a falafel wrap. And whatever, partying can be subversive, reckon. There's definitely a libertine element to a post-midnight doowhatyalike vibe, despite the oddly codified hedonism of a zillion Best Spring Break Evers. But elsewhere on I Suck on That Emotion, Svenonius drops the funny and sings of naïve political pawns (""Candidate"", ""Bag Inc."") Drag City dry humor meets John Fogerty, creating Neil Jamburger! New guitar tones emerge, breaking up the Zapatista Zeppelin boogie! Acoustic songs! Surf songs! The rest is pure Robitussin-slag; imagine a pistol-whipped Frankie Valli teamed with Ween and The Cramps, and forced to perform deadpan send-ups of cock-rock histrionics! Get your Lockheed Martin on! Never mind the references to Roman Empire or Luxembourg or miserly millionaires! This red-white-and-blue-balled release embraces the butt-hott contradictatorial goofiness of enduring freedom.

Irony,Gogol Bordello,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf545e6ef959693233ae/1:1/w_160/4f23adcd.jpg,2003-04-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3494-multi-kontra-culti-vs-irony/,Rubric,"Eugene Hutz would very much like you to know he's Ukrainian. Or Serb, Russian, Gypsy, whatever: he's from over there and rocks the 'stache to prove it. A self-exoticizing project that brought oompah-punk to downtown NYC, his Gogol Bordello exude the precise kind of gleeful inauthenticity that gets the hipsters horny. The overarching mood is that of a wasted shotgun wedding in the Karpaty, but guests on both sides of the puke-flecked altar wear vintage corduroys and wouldn't know their rakiya from their gorilka. Mind you, this is not a bad thing: Nikolai Gogol himself used his Ukrainian heritage primarily for flavor, and did his best writing in Rome. Bordello compensate for their calculated image with true immigrant work ethic-- for years, they'd tear up any club that would risk booking them, and Hutz's weekly DJ stint is still, improbably, on. The band's debut CD, Voi-La Intruder, couldn't possibly recreate their onstage freneticism and hunger; for that, it would had to have come packaged with a Stoli and a blunt, but it toiled hard for its money all the same. Production was near-absent: fiddles and accordions waged a shoving match for the studio's seemingly lone microphone; on top of the racket, Hutz made like a winterized Nick Cave, gutturally imploring the listener to ""start wearing purple for me now"". The sophomore Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony is a much more realized record: Bordello's blend of punk, folk, cabaret and what the Russians call ""cruel romance"" music is now smoother and more organic. Alas, as the band blew up in the intervening years, so did its ultimate ambition to become the world's next Manu Chao. A mere party record wouldn't cut it, and judging from the successes of Clandestino and Antibalas, we like our funk cut up with agitprop. Hutz and Co. are only too happy to oblige, and Multi Kontra Culti finds the crew deploying their ESL vocabulary in the service of vague political tirades. Where Voi-La spun drunken tales of green card marriages, the new record feigns rage against fashionable bogeymen of globalization and, well, irony. To make matters worse, Gogol Bordello feel the need to constantly mention their masterplan for fear we won't connect the dots: a mildly raucous number is called ""Punk Rock Parranda"" as insurance. A song that's equal parts punk and gypsy waltz earns the name ""Hopping on a Pogo Gypsy Stick"", which is less a title than a ready-made blurb. That's mighty media-conscious, coming from people whose website places the press links over a graphic of an unspooling toilet paper roll. Buy it if you must, but the only sensible thing to do with grand anti-irony proclamations is, of course, to read them as irony. Gogol Bordello lack anything resembling an actual platform: when Hutz sings ""Let's get radical / Not ironic,"" he doesn't propose a specific brand of radicalism, he just floats a buzzword that happens to occupy his orbit, like ""green card"", ""contraband"", ""punk"", ""passport"" and ""gypsy"". Typifying ambitious immigrants, Gogol Bordello have quickly learned how to sell old wares in their new environment.","Eugene Hutz would very much like you to know he's Ukrainian.

The Best of Morphine 1992-1995,Morphine,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c3c0084474cd0c353c/1:1/w_160/5dc8deba.jpg,2003-04-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5435-the-best-of-morphine-1992-1995/,Ryko,"In the spirit of allowing sleeping dogs to, you know, get some goddamn rest, and only out of a preponderance of love and admiration for Mr. Mark Sandman's legacy as the leader of Morphine, this disc never should've been pressed. I'm not gonna harp on the fact that Ryko are profiteering off the demise of another human being (there's no two ways about it), or dwell longer than necessary on the fact that Morphine themselves quickly fell into a...rut, musically speaking, a fact that this compilation only serves to make brutally clear. 1992-1995 isn't exactly an arbitrary span is the band's career, either, neatly encompassing the Morphine recordings Ryko owns: their first three full-lengths and some b-sides. It's hardly a comprehensive retrospective of this very original band, but there's profit to be had. Let's back-up though, and talk about this band, as perspective is required to understand the disc's failings. Back in 1992, the sheer iconoclasm of Sandman's famously simple, two-string slide bass, in tandem with nothing more than drums and saxophones, was a triumphant calling card and almost claim-to-fame on their debut, Good. It would soon become an unendurable obstacle; even after emerging from the sultry, seductive haze of their finest hour-- the sophomore effort Cure for Pain-- one couldn't help but wonder, \x93Is their next album gonna be just like the first two?\x94 Yes, it was. There are only so many ways to write the same three songs-- up-tempo debauchery, slow, slinky atmospherics and beat-poetry readings-- and when you have such a narrow range of instrumentation, you can pretty much exhaust them on one record. A few exceptions, like the bittersweet acoustics of \x93Gone For Good\x94 spring instantly to mind, but, they're not on this album. n What you do get, aside from a pretty liberal definition of \x93best\x94-- given the wide swath this disc cuts through their albums-- are three unreleased tracks only begging to stay down. The recorded cuts, sure to bring smiles to the faces of the familiar-- \x93Honey White\x94, \x93I'm Free Now\x94, \x93You Look Like Raix94-- are more than sufficient to maintain a fairly high standard, as well as an adequate spectrum of the band's assorted powers. But when you come down to it, a lot of Morphine's most impressive songs are remembered for nothing more than standing out on a samey album. The shame or sheer hell-- depending on your outlook and/or relation to the band-- is that, when all these songs are brought together, they blend together like any other Morphine recording: the liquid-smooth-to-frantic-and-back, smoky and solid playing is, for its novelty, monotonous. As for the newly released material, it's nothing but filler, sounding like watered-down versions of every other song on this collection-- and the last thing Morphine's well-oiled machinery needs is another fifteen minutes of sand. n This is far, far less than representative of Morphine's greatness; although many of these songs are their best works, it's more of a Morphine intro course than a respectful farewell. Five of these songs-- a full third of the album-- come from the incredible Cure for Pain; anyone interested in this album as a short road to their best tunes could do a lot worse, but you'd better be served just picking up Cure for Pain itself. If you already own that, well, you didn't even need to read this review, did you? Spanning a measly four years and barely half the band's recorded output, it trades excellence in a heartbeat, for mediocrity and around fifteen bucks.","In the spirit of allowing sleeping dogs to, you know, get some goddamn rest, and only out of a preponderance ...

Amassed,Spring Heel Jack,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a529b1335d7bf1698b2c/1:1/w_160/3b218113.jpg,2003-03-31 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7441-amassed/,Thirsty Ear,"It's fun to play with jazz musicians, in both senses of the word: as collaborators, but also as toys. If you're the producer of a pop, rap or electronica album, a real live jazz musician can bring a spontaneous friction to your recording session; like wind-up cars, they can spin around of their own volition, careening with energy over your album. But for as much freedom as they enjoy, if you're behind the mixing board you can control them like a kid in the den: you can block them with cushions, see if they can clear the floor, even throw under the couch in a tantrum. No matter how many high-brow ideas Spring Heel Jack layered on the album before this-- 2001's Masses-- it was the \x93gee whiz\x94 playtime factor that made them exciting. Veteran drum-n-bass duo John Coxon and Ashley Wales are life-long jazz fans; aside from a guest spot by John Surman on Disappeared, they had never used live performers until the Thirsty Ear Blue Series invited them to collaborate with some of its roster. Next thing they knew, they had control over almost a dozen of the best improvisers in jazz, from pianist Matthew Shipp and bassist William Parker to monolithic saxophonist Evan Parker and violist Mat Maneri. On Masses the duo dropped the live musicians into shimmering electronic backgrounds and ambient loops: a grinding guitar, a faded radio orchestra or a thudding upright bass, each backdrop ambient and passive, but vibrant and tricky enough to challenge the musicians who wandered through them, sometimes merely reacting, sometimes violently confronting the samples (or each other). Coxon and Wales repeat the concept-- and some of the backdrops-- on Amassed, a follow-up that takes the basic idea from Masses but changes the cast as well as the atmosphere. While Shipp and Evan Parker return for this album, the personnel as a whole shifts to more European players, and the music slows down, losing some of the band's snarkiness and humor. Amassed doesn't spark as much excitement as their last outing: it's less satisfying, less surprising and far less dynamic. It's never weak, but it suffers greatly in inevitable comparisons with its predecessor. That's not the fault of the musicians. It's tough to pick who's better: Maneri and William Parker on the first album, or trumpeter Kenny Wheeler and drummer/pseudo-performance artist Han Bennick on this one; it's like arguing over who would win a fight between King Kong and Godzilla. The improv is as sharp and natural as on Masses; Evan Parker stands out as the star soloist, with his fluid, tight circles of notes detonating in the space between academia, passion and those little rock gardens you tend with a rake. Wheeler is in elegant form, coolly soothing and deeply reflective. For a wildcard, they add Jason Pierce, aka J. Spaceman (Spiritualized, Spaceman 3) on distorted, processed guitar; while his wailing is less nimble than his colleagues' performances, his style connects the electronic atmospheres to the live spontaneity of the band. Spring Heel Jack remain subtle in handling musicians: most of the tracks still run over sampled elements that lay in the background, affecting the pace and atmosphere without hemming in the melody or rhythm. They don't splice or splinter the performances; in fact, most of the time they stay out of the way, throwing out a cue or shaping a performance by trimming it, such as on \x93Maroc\x94, where they excise everybody but Parker and Spaceman, trimming a group recording down to a duet. The only guy they grapple with is Wheeler: on his ballad feature \x93Lit\x94 they surround his trumpet with scrunching sounds like bored kids crunching styrofoam cups, an effect that's witty but somewhat annoying. But for most of this record, the humor and novelty of the Masses lineup is gone. Their decision to repeat some of the backdrops is the first thing that takes the sheen off the project. For example, \x93100 Years Before\x94 uses the \x93Over the Rainbow\x94-like horns and wide spaces from Masses' \x93Chorale\x94, and \x93Obscured\x94 repeats \x93Chiaroscuro\x94. Even in the improvisation, the band seems to be getting down to business rather than enjoying themselves: everything's familiar, and everyone knows the rules. There are highlights, like the pastoral openness and disjointed noise of \x93100 Years Before\x94 and the grinding rise and fall of \x93Wormwood\x94, but too often Coxon and Wales set up the kind of heads-down dirging group improvisation where no lead voice emerges and the music seems endless. The concluding piece, \x93Obscured\x94, may show off their chemistry, but it's a turgid way to end the record. After they cut this album, Spring Heel Jack played some concerts with a band that took players from both sessions. A review in The Wire described a set where Coxon and Wales took an active role on-stage, Coxon playing guitar and Wales doing everything from blowing a trumpet to tearing up sheets of paper. If they make another record, they should think about making a live album-- they could document a challenging new context and give the jazz guys a chance to turn the tables, messing around with Coxon and Wales without a mixing board to hide behind.","It\x92s fun to play with jazz musicians, in both senses of the word: as collaborators, but also as toys ...

Campfire Songs,Animal Collective,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4faea9e61561daa501d/1:1/w_160/d1adcd2b.gif,2003-03-31 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1268-campfire-songs/,Catsup Plate,"I was driving around with my father, letting him prattle-- unprompted and unabated--about the good ol' days in the country: working on the farm, driving the tractor, drinking Big Red, listening to the radio wafting out into the open fields. Having spent most of his days dreaming of a place of his own out there, where he could sit on the screened porch on a summer night, playing cards, drinking cold beers, listening to old Willie Nelson wavering as his hand played out, it seemed to come true almost ten years ago, when he had his own ranch house. And yet, he finally confided to me that he had never, in all those years, drank a beer or played cards, much less sat out on the porch listening to Willie. It was one of the saddest admissions I ever heard from my old man. I tried to be discreet when I listened to this Campfire Songs CD; I tried to make sure he was beyond earshot of this Animal Collective offshoot, as the vibrations would no doubt come to bear on all those dark, mosquito-filled evenings he missed. Recorded on somebody's porch in rural Maryland, Campfire Songs is supremely relaxed, intent on reveling in the blissful pastoralism longed for by Avey Tare and Geologist's ""Good Country: (off of Danse Manatee), yet not by way of its tribal electronics and urban babble. Instead, we have awkwardly plucked strings and arrhythmic, strummed ellipses curving in and out of each other as they lay in the clearing, insects wandering through their hair as the leaves of the tambourine trees rustle on ""Queen in my Pictures"". The trio of voices, scarcely harmonized, creates a discernible motion, moving in and out of each other's throats, erecting a semblance of structure that stabilizes for a night, even if it's built on the flimsiest of timbres. As they turn their meandering strums into ""Doggy"", Campfire Songs almost approach the eroding acoustic glow the Grifters tenaciously shone from Eureka, the embers burning low under the gray ash as the sounds of rain fall and hiss about their little circle. The flames slowly build back, fanned by banjo and mandolin, the sound billowing from smoky green sticks and crackling branches. Somewhere a plane circles, droning high overhead, revealing open space in the lo-fi recording. ""Two Corvettes"" is more content to idle, absorbing the night air. Just when you think they're falling asleep, the acoustic guitars stumble back with a clenched rattling, their voices turning more animalistic, wailing just past the light of the fire. If the Oldham boys had clopped up in ostrich skin boots to Buzzy Linhart's loft space around 4am at Frank's to holler out ""Come A Little Dog""-- still haunted by the coyote spirits that bellow up in the Hill Country-- they may as well have blazed over to this back porch instead. But when the Campfires start to channel ""Taking Care of Business"" while the katydids yammer in the distance, it hits you: these are city slickers out on a weekend trip. These boys are taking Willie Nelso's golf balls and cracking them open, slowly unraveling the rubber band and nylon twine wrap until they arrive at the gooey gray center of it all, tentatively biting into the blue goop once dumped into Whiskey River. High on said toxins, they lose themselves in a drifting, imaginary suite, a patch of fantasy that made this city boy pine for a beautiful place out in the country.",,7.1,
Clouds,True Love Always,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1af5e6ef95969320243/1:1/w_160/e7674d2c.gif,2003-03-31 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8170-clouds/,Teenbeat,"According to popular legend, the Commodores chose their name by tossing a dictionary on the floor and choosing the first word they pointed to on the open page. I guess it worked out okay for them, but the perils of this approach are readily apparent: they came within inches of naming themselves the Commodes, and even closer to labeling themselves the Commodities. This is just an off-handed guess, but I'm thinking the three guys in True Love Always got the pedestrian title of their latest album (their fifth since 1997) using the same method. I base that assumption on the total inaccuracy of the title: if any thought went into it, it was certainly ironic, and that just doesn't seem to be their style. In reality, there's not a cloud in sight on this album, and as a matter of fact, irony is equally absent. The bossa-inflected pop these guys churn out is so breezy, it'll blow over any objects in the room not tightly secured, and if you hear a single distorted guitar anywhere on this record, you heard more than I did. Guitarist/vocalist John Lindaman seems to value clarity in all things, keeping his electric firmly rooted in a clean, jazzy tone, and singing in an even, warm tenor that sounds a lot like James Taylor with wider nasal passages. Drummer Matt Datesman and bassist Tony Zanella give things a minimal push with a series of easy rhythms, and generally manage to keep the backgrounds interesting, if harmless. This formula results in a bag of songs ranging from honey-soaked to just sugary; not a wide range, but when the songs are stuffed with moments like the chorus of the opener \x93Give Me the Clouds\x94-- where Lindaman and backing vocalist Evelyn Hurley paste huge harmonies all over an adhesive flytrap of a melody-- you don't so much mind. \x93Let the Rain Blow Ix94 even has a nice, understated guitar solo that would have fit in pretty well on A Hard Day's Night. \x93For You Alone\x94 features a fantastic, rapid-fire melody, but it's marred somewhat by the fact that Lindaman treats it as a duet with Hurley, and Hurley, while great on backup, doesn't quite cut it out in front. Problems also arise on songs like \x93Summer Books\x94, where the band's sense of economy gets them in trouble, resulting in an overly repetitive second half, with the lines \x93You, like summer books, don't kiss and tell/ And I'd be lost without you,\x94 repeated dozens of times. \x93Peel Away\x94 exaggerates that problem greatly, adopting what I suppose you could call a more experimental structure, with a vastly more fractured and a section where Lindaman layers his vocals, creating a repeated pattern of the partial phrase \x93why don't\x94 with a slower melody over it. It's conceptually very interesting, but somewhat annoying in execution. Still, points for branching out. Ultimately, I'm not really sure whether to celebrate or lament True Love Always for their complete lack of guile. On one hand, 36 minutes of pure silver lining can get a little tiresome, but it's also nice to see a band so direct and unassuming in this age of forced irony. Clouds is certainly pleasant listening, stuffed with good melodies and some accomplished musicianship, but it's also not likely to hook you back into a lot of repeated listens, given the way it lays all its cards out right away. A desultory toss of Webster's to the floor sums it up nicely: quaint. If that's your bag, have at it.","According to popular legend, the Commodores chose their name by tossing a dictionary on the floor and choosing the first ...

Intonomancy,No-Neck Blues Band,by: Oliver Lache,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c413c0084474cd0c35ee/1:1/w_160/06691818.jpg,2003-03-31 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5817-intonomancy/,Soundatone,"There's so much to fear in New York right now: Fed-Exed nukes from North Korea, low-grade Uranium shavings cast from the top of the Empire State building as cheapo fallout, a smallpox outbreak carried through the subway tunnels it was hard enough climbing stairs thinking \x93Any moment now, I could slip and break my neck.\x94 And yet, as I dwell on the unlikely finality of that snap, the supposedly impending revolution care of New York City's No-Neck Blues Band is one thing I'm not particularly worried about, even as they haunt my dreams in Mysterio clouds of sulfur and patchouli smoke, their satchels filled with obscure Don Cherry records, poisonous berries, and bearded songster scores found in dumpsters outside rehearsal spaces. \x93Witch\x94 eases things open with great haunted promise, snaking its way up the river between Apocalypse Now-era Rhythm Devils and the Doors' distended psychedelic menace, writhing and enticing great reptilian figures to surface, their faces slick with mud. \x93Play Your Play\x94 comes on in home-stitched priest gowns, the trails and runners wavering in and out of the physical realm as cloth drags along the ground, taking a few minutes to really get to the tom-tapped ceremony of accordion and organ drones, slowly attaining a chilled plateau they sustain for nearly twelve minutes. The sprawling \x93The Shepherd Takes a Shine to the Abyss\x94 that closes the album is the most exquisite exploration of the bunch, and as beautiful as anything they've ever conjured up. Building from spider-silk strands of cello and acoustic bass, its lightly delayed guitars slowly coalesce to stand upright, merging the bratty sax bleats into a wholesome peace. But the magic and smokescreens run out of steam in the middle of the record: \x93Open That Grass Cax94 begins to piddle and plink, revealing bored revelers behind their renaissance wardrobe, their rope-and-wood machines petering then falling apart. The title track only has its punny name going for it, a dorm-sponsored, smoke-out drum circle; \x93This Absent-Minded Crisis?\x94 is two minutes of baby babble even Yoko Ono couldn't entertain. \x93Fuck-No\x94 at least has the good sense to steal Sun Ra's cosmically therapeutic drum reverb, guaranteeing lift-off, but the captain comes out of the cabin dressed like an orangutan from a novelty calendar, making oogy-googy noises in utter disdain for Ra's muumuu. Twelve minutes in, pecked notes and monkey-scat-- not to mention a wooden train whistle-- thoroughly derail the piece. While a small beam of light fell upon their Harlem loft with a record they wrangled out on John Fahey's Revenant label-- earning critical accolades from high places-- the group remains relatively obfuscated, rarely playing shows and splintering into multiple personalities to obscure their different trails. Their early releases are pure handmade loveliness, sheathed in mystifying, artful packages, the music mashing together Cromagnon, Alan Sondheim, Father Yod, and other privately-pressed wax icons to the point where picking apart their influences became a futile exercise in bogus alchemy. Each was its own potent dose, and full gnosis was never quite possible when absorbing them; unfortunately, Intonomancy is a shoddier stone tablet, a wearisome simplification of their decade-old primitivism. Their music, now much more clearly recorded, finally reveals itself more sloth than Thoth.","There\x92s so much to fear in New York right now: Fed-Exed nukes from North Korea, low-grade Uranium shavings cast ...

Keep On Your Mean Side,The Kills,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb96eb335119a49eca8a/1:1/w_160/f6169dcd.jpg,2003-03-31 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4424-keep-on-your-mean-side/,Rough Trade,"It's rough times for these bluesy guy-girl garage duos, I tell ya. I mean, sure, if you're the least bit talented you've got a massive hype machine working for you-- which isn't a bad thing-- but you'll never shake those comparisons to the band that built the boat you're sailing. I promise not to mention of the W\x97S\x97 , maybe as a favor to The Kills, but mostly because the two bands sound nothing alike. Regardless, the Kills won't need to fish for complimentary comparisons; suckers are jumping out of the water. I'll be damned if vocalist VV (nee Alison Mosshart) doesn't have a picture of PJ Harvey at her bedside, and the same goes double for instrumentalist Hotel (Londoner Jamie Hince) re: Neil Hagerty. These influences aren't as disparate as they seem: while Harvey and the Royal Trux worked on different sides of the fidelity line, they were both attempting expansive, ambitious modern updates of the blues. The Kills' aim is just about the opposite; despite the stylistic similarities, they're trying to return the pillaged form to its simpler roots. Though their minimalism might sometimes sound like straight distillation, the tunes still hit, and hurt. On the second track, \x93Cat's Claw\x94, the raised hackles of V.V.'s voice roughly brush up against Hotel's descending string of power chords, and the \x93Got it, I want it\x94 chorus sinks its rusty sing-along hooks into your lips with stoned rapacity. On this song-- and as a rule-- The Kills offer strictly verse/chorus stuff, with a few careening bars of guitar skree passing for a bridge. Oddly, this is what makes the song great, just as the Jesus and Mary Chain distortion of the record's opener lines a wordlessly yowled chorus like lace on an exquisite corpse's casket, pulling the song beyond the confines of a boxy garage, out into the dark streets. The band knows when-- and more importantly how-- to augment their simplicity, but it's a shame they don't use this gift more often. It's not that any of these songs fail, at least in the rock and roll or blues departments, but there's a point where minimalism can easily turn hollow. The lockstep lyric and riff repetition of \x93Black Rooster\x94 wears itself out quickly, begging for variation about three minutes in, but the band keeps pushing straight ahead. And no matter how much enthusiasm the band pours into it, the titular mantra of \x93Fuck the People\x94 still sounds like nothing more than a predicate pose. Like their pseudonyms, the band's shove-it adherence to a few glib phrases and riffs is going stale; it's still good, but once in a while, you catch a whiff of lazy, empty self-mythologizing. But even a hollow brick can knock you out cold: there's enough hypnotic arm-wrestling in the slippery back-and-forth rhythm of \x93Hitched\x94 to drop a cruiserweight critic, and-- despite the minimalist posture-- there's enough thematic variation to make things interesting. \x93Kissy Kissy\x94, for instance, starts with a ringing guitar figure that almost sounds more at home in the Ganges Delta than the Mississippi, before following its thudding drums into doomsville. Though few and far between, the numbers where the band slows down and eases back on the attitude are things of beauty; \x93Wait\x94, the album's longest and most repetitive track, makes perfect use of the yearning core of V.V.'s tough, stripped voice, stretching seductive curiosity into two-chord cosmic foreplay. The final track, \x93Gypsy Death and You\x94, is in a similar vein, V.V. and Hotel using only voice, acoustic guitar, and insistent, reverbed drum hits to sketch their own halfway-to-sober version of ramshackle folk. If they should break through to the mainstream, The Kills probably deserve it more than most. Their poses are balanced with enough genuine emotion to approach the sum of their influences; they play with more style and flair than almost any band in a scene where the former is usually all that matters. Still, it's a bitter reality: they'd never be getting this kind of attention if it weren't for the White Stri-- fuck!","It\x92s rough times for these bluesy guy-girl garage duos, I tell ya.

Clothes Your I's,Karl Blau,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a303ea9e61561daa4ba8/1:1/w_160/c0490553.jpg,2003-03-30 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/795-clothes-your-is/,Knw-Yr-Own,"Karl Blau-- one third of D+, with Phil Elvrum, and Bret Lunsford of Beat Happening, and a contributor in The Microphones-- is a lonesome voice at a backwoods sing-along, but Clothes Your I's is a campfire very unlike the chatty marshmallow roasts I attended as a kid. The atmosphere of this recording is a solitary ritual of stalwart self-reliance, something the listener observes from a distance, the view partially obscured by sulphur, fireflies, and crooked black trees. Blau grew up in Anacortes, Washington on the San Juan Island of Fildalgo in Puget Sound; the site leaves an indelible mark on the album's watery geography, which emerges to the sound of a boat's distant foghorn. Blau situates himself within a world of ""concrete nettles"" and blackberry bushes, rainfalls, ""I's"", solitude, and a sun that's ""a revolutionary in the skies."" He focuses on natural forms of epiphany like burning pine, the dampness of ""loving"" soil underfoot, the milky rays of the sky, always working against ""the separation of our state from nature."" ""Pendulum"" leads, the strongest track on the record; this catchy three-minute pop song sounds like the cheerier work of Neutral Milk Hotel, teetering with a folk-art sensibility: ""Worn through the fabric of the chest by years of a tender cheek/ Speak talk of the rainfall today and mention sunbeams burning the skin of yesterday."" There's rust on the cheap old swingset in its backyard, crammed with coded language; on this track, it's so external, it's as though the musicians are using smoke and driftwood as part of the instrumentation, watching rain drop on a cymbal, a branch tap against a snare. Much like The Microphones, Blau excels at filling up spaces with organic sounds-- banjos, trombones, saxophones, shakers-- while avoiding overwrought clutter. He makes each detail seem like it was born exactly where it rests. I could chock this up to divining, but more pragmatically it might have to do with the fact that Clothes Your I's was laid down at Dub Narcotic with the aide of Phil Elvrum and Calvin Johnson, notorious for their recently spacious analog recordings. A number of other strong moments dot the record: ""Computer"" begins with a minute of dissolving horns that drift in and out of sight before turning opaque dirge complete with chimes and plucking tones; ""Sunsign"" works a brilliant samba atop a flood of percussion, horns, and boy/girl call-and-response, and ""Creepin' Jesus""-- with lyrics by Nate Ashley-- sounds like Will Oldham back before he was too reserved to scream and howl. Following ""Creepin' Jesus"", though, Clothes Your I's stumbles. ""Fasten Me to You"" has a cloying guitar line so detached, it dredges up images of new age gurus. It's also one of the longest tracks, trailing off into a seemingly endless repetition of the choral refrain followed by guitar swell, ad infinitum. On ""I Hold You"", the same busybody sensibility remains like the remnants of a dewy hippie hoedown-- I keep seeing overalls for some reason. These two misfires act as a troubling dip-tych, daring you with their inability to resolve, falling apart into meandering jams. They're prettily pastoral in a way-- I dig the flute-- but if I see a tie-dye, I get well nervous. During ""Bid-R-Bunch"", the record's tiny farewell, Blau regains his footing, going multi-track psychedelic like Olivia Tremor Control, raising the roof for Mother Nature. Thirty seconds after the end, a strain of ""Pendulum"" starts up again, but instead of singing about the sun and shifts in luck, Blau draws on ""and to love..."" for a minute. The reemergence after those less-than-stellar trip-ups acts as a reminder of how things went downhill for a bit, but also creates a nice loop, a fading frame of reference. When he's at his best, Blau resembles a prophet scarfing honey in the desert, a John McPhee speaking in tongues, chanting in a whisper from Lord Byron's Vision of Judgment about out-of-tune angels. Clothes Your I's isn't as perfectly poetic or blissful, but its rag-tag patchwork is a brief and enjoyable ride.

The Rutland Isles,Eric Idle,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1aa13d197565213bc30/1:1/w_160/5dc2be2f.jpg,2003-03-30 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4060-the-rutland-isles/,iMusic,"Around the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out, it seemed as if the members of the titular troupe could do no wrong and that the well of comedic genius might very well flow to the end of time. A string of diminishing films and the demise of Monty Python itself disappointed quite a few, but since its participants were still alive and kicking, so were the hopes of their fans. Eric Idle, along with John Cleese, stood out particularly, and Idle's work on the TV special, The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash, showed that there were enough good ideas left in his head to keep the faithful tuning in. Idle then pulled a John Lennon, appearing brilliant in group work, and briefly so after going solo only to punish diehards with an unbroken stream of mediocrity thereafter-- not least of which came during his short-lived stint on the U.S. sitcoms Nearly Departed and Suddenly Susan. Now he's added another dubious chapter to his legacy with the album, The Rutland Isles. Posing as a brief excerpt from host Nigel Spasm's 168-part documentary on the namesake islands, Rutland Isles also seems to pose as something related to The Rutles, which it is not. In actuality, it's a rather tepid music-and-comedy record from a man who stands shamelessly beside Steve Martin and Robin Williams in the Love-Me-Because-I-Used-To-Be-Funny Club. Merrie Olde national treasure though he may be, Idle never comes close to justifying his continuing existence with The Rutland Isles. Worse: he traces that sadly familiar line washed-up comedians can't seem to avoid. Though this album isn't as bad as hearing a formerly respectable comedian like Robert Klein tell flaccid jokes about O.J. and John Bobbitt years after they were deemed exhausted by the lowliest nightclub hack, it does reveal Idle's regression into some terribly cheap humor. See if you can spot the gag in the following track titles: ""Penis Fish"", ""Gay Animal Song"", ""Muff Diving"", and ""Homo Semi-Erectus"". Give up? Here's a hint: they're about sex, and they're as obvious as can be, with ""Gay Animal Song"" sticking out like a tasteless, derivative thumb. It's not too hard to understand why Idle resorted to such reliable topics, though. Not much else makes a decent stab for attention. On the island of Paranoia, says our host, people are prone to saying, ""Look out behind you,"" though certainly not so often or so expectantly as Idle. Another gem is found in ""Killing for God"", a song that bravely breaks comedy's long silence on the hypocrisy of religion. Yet even if the contents frequently fall short of anything that could safely be called a mark, the crumbling legend behind The Rutland Isles should be given credit for one thing: spoofing those pompous BBC documentaries. It's just what this world needs.","Around the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out, it seemed as if the members of the titular ...

The Secret of Elena's Tomb EP,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0925e6ef9596931ffa8/1:1/w_160/6c65df08.jpg,2003-03-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/179-the-secret-of-elenas-tomb-ep/,Interscope,"The pressure is on. Trail of Dead, still reeling from the acclaim of last year's monster rock epic Source Tags & Codes, now stand at that difficult juncture marked by the skulls and bones of countless indie-gone-major bands before them. A&R; ""need that next record ASAP,"" before the band loses their shot at the fickle tastes of mainstream American consumers, while the die-hards-- who'd be content to wait at least another year if it meant a better album-- expect a hallowed follow-up to either equal or surpass the band's treasured last release. In the meantime, the label wants an EP to keep the band in the spotlight, tide over fans, and further hype the forthcoming follow-up. So we get this: The Secret of Elena's Tomb, a clearly rushed product containing four newly recorded songs and one experimental leftover, with multimedia bonus features tacked on as a last-minute point-of-sale and a means of banking on those who would otherwise just download the thing (its artwork, unlike that of Source Tags, isn't much to look at). The disc's songs being, presumably, among the few Trail of Dead has written in the past year, it's safe to say that the band wasn't likely given the obvious advantage of selectivity. In light of that constraint, it's understandable that some of this disc's tracks aren't up to par, but also promising that the ones that pay off show the band working toward a departure from the sound of their last album. All of Trail of Dead's albums up to this point seemed refinements of the sound that finally culminated on Source Tags & Codes, a blistering, frenzied stomper summoning the aural equivalent of apocalypse and damnation. On Elena's Tomb, they seem ready push things forward, if not yet clear which path to tread. As such, the record is experimental in the truest sense, each of its tracks signifying a possible point of departure: one continues on their present course-- a sound which they've clearly grown bored with-- while another gives up that ghost and cashes in on the coattails of Dashboard Confessional; two others hint at a more pop-oriented reincarnation of Source Tags' more soft-focus moments, ""Another Morning Stoner"" and its title track. As can be expected, the band's transitional status doesn't exactly translate to a gripping listen. Many of their experiments either fall flat, or just seem too forced: ""Mach Schau"" is one of these, opening the disc with the band's most overt Sonic Youth plundering to date. Awkwardly straddling some imaginary line between experimentalism and rote hardcore, and lacking any trace of melody, they seem lost, and for the first time since their self-titled debut, a little self-conscious. The car-crash collision of these two genres is-- if nothing else-- unique, but the generic, shouted chorus and mumbled-word verses play like a hackneyed approximation of The Velvet Underground's ""Murder Mystery"", about as far from inspiration as these guys have ever wandered. Worse still is ""Counting Off the Days"", a thankfully brief shot at capturing-- or, possibly, satirizing-- the overwrought drama club banality MTV pipes into the bedrooms of suburban teenagers. A 12-string acoustic strums repetitively, a cello droning subtly beneath, while Conrad Keely intones, ""And it's sooooo hard to starrrrrve!!!"" in a scary parallel with Chris Carraba's unforgettably piercing, ""Anywhere... With anyone... Mayyykking ouuuut!!!"" If this is a joke, I give them credit for faking me out; if not, they should stop and consider whether America really needs another diary-scribbling pussy sobbing on its disdainful shoulder. Of their options, Trail of Dead seem most comfortable-- and are far and away the most successful-- reveling in melodic saturation. ""All St. Day"" and ""Crowning of a Heart"" both seem like logical progressions from Source Tags, retaining that album's drumkit combat and misty production, but pushing the songwriting straight to the fore. ""Crowning of a Heart"", Elena's clear standout, is almost wrenching, following a serpentine vocal hook, and dropping mid-song into one of the band's trademark instrumental segues, which rides a simple, drawn-out guitar figure and beautiful, languid four-part harmonies. ""All St. Day"" is nearly as good, a sort of tom-fueled, autumnal inverse of Source Tags' urgent ""Monsoon"", with an insistent backbeat and Neil Busch adamantly sing/shouting the killer refrain, ""Everybody knows you can't hide forever."" The record's fifth and final song could be counted among the record's many bonus features, a dancefloor rocker that appeared last fall on the UK single for ""Another Morning Stoner"". Technically, it's not even Trail of Dead; being a collaboration between Jason Reece and non-Trail member Tyler Jacobsen, it would more aptly fall under the header of Reece's side project A Roman Scandal. Its inclusion here further confuses things, adding to the disc's overall lack of focus-- although, that said, it's a pretty solid track, with punishing neo-industrial beat programming and an impassioned (if sometimes a bit tuneless) vocal performance from Reece. The Secret of Elena's Tomb is the sound of a band, having accomplished everything they dreamed of, starting from scratch. Drained by tours and shouldering pressure from their backers, Trail of Dead are throwing darts blindfolded, hoping at least one hits the board. While this disc is an obvious placeholder, it's not fueled by insulting or wanton disregard for their reputation, or their fans. In fact, fans of Source Tags & Codes will likely find it worth their $6.98-- if not for the two extremely promising highlights, then for the videos for ""Relative Ways"" and ""Another Morning Stoner"". Yet those hoping it might indicate what to expect from Trail of Dead's next album are left in the dark; fumbling for answers, they'll probably run into the band.","The pressure is on.

Winter in the Belly of a Snake / Find Candace,Venetian Snares,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9389d034d5c69bf3bf6/1:1/w_160/2ca9af38.jpg,2003-03-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11858-winter-in-the-belly-of-a-snake-find-candace/,Planet µ,"What can you do but duck and cover with Aaron Funk? Bomb shelters won't do you any good; your gas mask might as well be crafted from Slim Jims and bubble wrap. As the crusty leather heart of breakcore sith lord Venetian Snares, Funk drops more Fat Men per month than militant tree huggers drop acid, and every endeavor is more potent than any microdot floating around Northern Oregon. Belying the civility of his death-penalty-lacking homeland, Venetian Snares is the musical equivalent of a chainsaw massacre in the violent offenders' wing of your local Federal Penitentiary, raw flesh and circuitry overload guaranteed. But what's most impressive is the diversity of the Snares catalogue, the natural extension of Funk's Nosferatu fingernails into the shadowy reaches of electronic music; the psychotic drifter who programmed ""Skelechairs"" is the same cuddly birthday clown who gave us Songs About My Cats, and Funk has been comfortable with every transition, slipping into various skins like Planet \xB5's very own Buffalo Bill. Find Candace, released on the Hymen label as a companion piece to the Doll Doll Doll LP, comes two months after the highly anticipated Winter in the Belly of a Snake, an album that finds Funk stripping a few layers of dead skin from his sound to expose a bone structure ancestral to his razor-sharp cut-ups, but augmented with a more patient ear for composition and climax. Ambient passages abound, dark washes of Purgatory gray that suggest Seefeel's Ch-Vox on an ECT regiment. The tension here is thicker here than on other Venetian Snares outings, a mortician's gloom hovering over the epic, Siberian tundra of ""Gottrahmen"" and the symphonic ""Sink Slow Angel"", whose undead pinball beats can't contain the sinister string movements gnashing their teeth just below the track's glassy surface. The unpredictably touching ""Dad"" features Funk on vocals, and its harrowing mantra (""I had a dream you were still alive"") sticks with you like the diseased laments of a mental patient, writing letters that will never get mailed. Much has been made of the vocal tracks on this record, most notably Funk's sloshed philharmonic take on The Misfits' ""She"", but their presence is limited, and the fade very easily into the Venetian Snares patchwork. What comes as the biggest surprise is the de-emphasis on low-end, which Funk has eschewed in favor of more digital-sounding breaks, fragments of fiberglass and copper wiring that flicker and surge with a nod to Autechre at their most mathematical and inorganic. So no unstable jungle or kill-n-bass attitude pops up on Winter in the Belly of a Snake, although the beautifully ugly Zen meditation ""January"" and the speed-freak flashback ""In Quod"" kick up some dust with exorcised synth melodies and accelerated PVC drumkits. The 16 tracks found here are a winding black river cutting through miles of clear-cut forest and silent abandoned farms, carrying unidentified corpses out to sea. The dispatchers of said corpses are the heroes of Find Candace, whose mummified drill-n-bass rampages are aimed squarely at the violent predator in each and every one of us. Venetian Snares is safely within the borders of his murderous empire on Candace, dissecting jungle breaks and thick basslines, and swapping the vital organs until all terminology lines are blurred. This familiarity inflicts a small amount of damage to the record, lessening its impact by rehashing a successful attack plan; a vinyl copycat killer if ever there was one. Not essential, then (Higgins Ultra-Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006 is a much bolder take on this sound), but masochistically satisfying regardless. The lead track, a remix of Doll Doll Doll's ""Befriend a Child Killer"", actually fleshes out the original's coarse and volatile loops, turning an abrasive hardcore screamer into Dieselboy for lobotomized Bad Boy Yardies. Funk frontloads Find Candace with a deceptively methodical rhythm of interlocking snares wrapped in slasher flick ambience that would have Jamie Lee Curtis begging for a toe-tag. Including the previously released ""Dolleater"" is a strange decision-- seeing as how we have 12 new tracks from Funk every time we blink-- and it hurts the flow of the album. ""Yor"", fortunately, makes amends, evolving from faulty-modem feedback to time-lapse ogre boogie in time to set things right. The final minutes of ""Yor"" hint at the iron maiden solitude of Winter in the Belly of a Snake, floating by like a bitter poltergeist at midnight, but Find Candace ultimately comes in a distant second. All of the tracks are tight and hard-hitting, but they're too measured and predictable to really smash your skull against the curb. The putrid spirit of invention that informs Belly of a Snake is more exemplary of Aaron Funk's strengths, definitive evidence that this isn't some kook we have on our hands, no wanna-be Son of Sam. Our killer seems to have more purpose, handling his mutilations with a painfully steady artisan's touch. Venetian Snares is one sick and twisted menace to society, but he sure as hell is good at what he does.",,8.6,
Smarmymob,Neon Hunk,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c6ea9e61561daa7fd2/1:1/w_160/c0238dc3.jpg,2003-03-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5744-smarmymob/,Load,"There was a small army of ""horse girls"" in my school, all prissy and gussied, who lived their entire lives to ride, groom, feed, and fawn over their beloved stable of honeyed mares and-- if they were blessed-- ponies. Like a homicidal marching band, they all seemed to be outfitted in the color lavender, with their long pigtails brushed to a tail-like sheen. Though there was nothing overtly wrong about them (barring the girls who smelled gamey, I found an aura of creepiness about them, a lingering residue that I couldn't place but for my intuition. Isolated in their rainbows-and-unicorns world, they were perfect and inhuman. Neon Hunk hit me in the same way. They play off the pathos of creepy/cute, exploring every crevice of adorableness through their unsettling, maniacally entertaining funhouse of quacking synths, an intricate spilling of drums, and incomprehensible, muffled lyrics. Here, though, you can identify the exact point of freak-out: it's the scratching, buried presence of the vocals. Electronically altered to sound like either the heavy-breathing serial killer profiled on Nightline, or the torturous and vengeful spider/hobbit hybrid that lives under your bed, the vocalist (cryptically named fucking ""MOTHMASTER,"" for god's sake) squirms his way through your worst nightmares, alternately drooling and shooting acid from his mouth-hole. Live, the Milwaukee Hunks often don clashing acid-colored/acid-printed spandex, and happily, this aesthetic has bled into Smarmymob's cover art: Across a rainbow backdrop, a repeating image of three homicidal and deformed kittens drills holes into our minds. And that's fucking scary. However, unlike the kitties, Neon Hunk have mercy on us. There's a vein of self-aware hokiness pulsing throughout Smarmymob, but the expected element of irony is tossed aside in lieu of examining the total absurdity of the cute ""80s underworld,"" and presumably, scaring the shit out of its torchbearers. The kitsch is mostly in the concept; what's left over is an unrelenting, deceptively simple pixel-chirp genetically similar to Blectum from Blechdom's Haus de Snaus or The Curtains' Fast Talks: brain-spinning calliope rhythms occasionally sprinkled with gimpy C-64 funk. (As heard in the drilling call-and-response trills of ""Uncle David"", or in ""Beefmastor"", which sounds like the ""Push It"" ringtone on somebody's blowing-up piece.) Smarmymob gets the horse-girl illuminati stamp of approval, thanks to its overarching pop element, aka the herky-jerky, adorably ominous, science-class melodies. Then again, it's music totally loved by nerdboy noize dudes the world over-- who, when you think about it, aren't that much different from a troupe of 13-year-old horse fanatics. This time, however, the music is actually fun, instead of Garth Brooks' ""Friends in Low Places"".","There was a small army of ""horse girls"" in my school, all prissy and gussied, who lived their entire lives ...

Hot New Spirits,Tangiers,by: Matt Stephens,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72f9d034d5c69bf371f/1:1/w_160/1b807ee7.jpg,2003-03-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7934-hot-new-spirits/,Sonic Unyon,"For a scene that's so openly condemned and reviled by critics, this ""garage rock revival"" has sure produced some damn fine records. You can dwell all you like on the middling Datsuns or the hopelessly plagiaristic Vines, but when push comes to shove it's hard to ignore the stripped-down super-hooks of The Strokes, The White Stripes or... okay, so that's pretty much it for inspiring garage-rock. Nevertheless! While never particularly revelatory or original, the best of it has consisted of tight, punchy pop songs that take up permanent residence in your cerebral cortex. Even if you haven't listened to ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" in over a year, you probably still remember the melody. Toronto's Tangiers may, at first glance, represent an archetypal, derivative garage band. They've got most of the particulars in the bag; the tousled hairdos, the thrift-store suits, the cigarettes and alcohol. But throughout most of Hot New Spirits they both wisely and endearingly set themselves apart from the flock, twisting the garage formula to give it a new, refreshing looseness and dynamic without sacrificing the immediacy that the style thrives on. Incorporating a Stones-y rawness and a violently jangly two-guitar attack into the standard lo-fi muddle, the band ends up sounding... well, a lot like the Buzzcocks, really. I'm sorry! I realize every single garage-rock record review to date has referenced any one of countless punk and/or pop bands of the past, but look, we might as well face right now that no garage band of the 21st Century has yet really come up with their own distinct sound. Tangiers aren't breaking the mold or anything. And while I'm at it, I might as well say they aren't a direct clone of Shelley/Devoto-- frontman Josh Reichmann's vocals aren't nearly as nasal, and the band is certainly less high-strung and unquestionably (North) American. The influence, however, remains undeniable. And ain't nothing wrong with that. At least, not when the outcome is this solid. One thing that really makes this record-- that is, aside from the out-and-out stunning pop songs-- is the sincerity. These guys don't have the production value, fashion sense or, if we're judging by the artwork, desire to strike commercial gold. In fact, they lack every extraneous element that makes an MTV-friendly garage-rock band: there's no bratty attitude, no sneering vocals, and-- sorry, gents-- no ""cute one"". The focus here, absolute front-and-center, is always the song itself. The livid, stormy ""Here Come the Pieces"", the claustrophobic Dolls-style jam ""Anxiety"", and the almost anthemic ""Ca Va Cool"" are all concise, stirring send-ups that demonstrate the group's dazzling gift for melody and dynamics, each finding a subtle climax that demands repeat listens. Even when the writing isn't quite up to their usual standards-- which, I must say, is strikingly rare-- Tangiers' bug-eyed delivery and energetic Red Bull overdrive make the songs a welcome listen. Americas, here is your garage-rock underdog.","For a scene that's so openly condemned and reviled by critics, this ""garage rock revival"" has sure produced some ...

Gossett: This guy did this to himself? Lou: Best we can figure. We interviewed his hippie neighbor, said he heard weird things coming from up here all night: chainsaws, shotguns, beartraps, piranhas, you name it. Hippie said he came up to see what was going on, and the guy yelled all kinds of crap at him. Never opened the door, though. Gossett: What kind of crap's he yelling? Lou: Stuff about some album being so ""brilliantly bonkers"" he couldn't take it anymore. Something about, ""Is everyone in North Dakota as original as June Panic? No wonder you never hear about that place!"" Then something about how June Panic was ""so free of the shirt-tugging insecurity of hipster dinks."" Gossett: What the jack?

Gossett: He's a pile of melted Skittles for all I care. Lou: The hippie neighbor asked him to turn the music down, and Mr... Bowens, he turns it up, exclaiming ""yes!"" after certain lyrics. Gossett: Did the hippie catch any of those? Lou: A few songs about Jesus. Mr. Bowens said they ""mopped the floor with the Danielson Family."" Gossett: May be a mob thing. Lou: One of the Jesus lyrics was ""the carpenter got married to a board."" Uh, another was: ""Time chooses you because you are the one plus one."" The hippie heard lyrics about birth being an eviction, and about how learning to walk was really learning to walk alone. Through the door, Mr Bowens was exclaiming how ""freshly crushing"" these, uh, sentiments were. Gossett: Have the freakshits taken over the proverbial henhouse, Lou? Have they? Lou: Not on my watch, they didn't. More yammering: Bowens said Mr. Panic's voice could ""dither from gorgeous to awkward in the same syllable,"" and asked him to ""imagine a so-cute-it's-ugly, or so-ugly-it's-cute love-child of Jeff Buckley and Jad Fair."" Then he said: ""Imagine a male Belinda Carlisle, imagine Smurff Mangum, imagine Keebler Oberst."" Gossett: You running checks on these names? Lou: Nothing's turned up yet, though the hippie recognized a bunch of references to a Bob Dylan, which we learned is an alias for one Robert Zimmerman out of Minnesota. Mr. Bowens said that Panic was ""a spacier basement Dylan"", that his band The Silver Sound had ""synthesized Desire, Slow Train Coming, and the Lanois-produced latter-day albums."" The arrangements on the country-rock songs, he said, ""were as breezy and foreboding as the last two Bonnie 'Prince' Billy records."" Lastly, the hippie had to endure a speech about how the song ""Hung-Up"" was ""among the finest reconciling-a-dead-love chronicles ever, ever."" Bowens wailed the chorus, ""We tried and that is all we know: we tried/ We die and that is all we know: We die."" Gossett: This guy sounds like a fruit. How many more lives will this confounded rock music take before somebody props a law up against it? Lou: Sir, you're standing on a note! [Gossett wipes revolting gore off the note and reads it aloud.] Gossett: ""Dear Cruel World: I have never beheld anything like this turbo-ambitious concept album about Jesus, sex, childbirth, and Megadeath. As intelligent as it is insane, this album easily trumps Panic's decent recent work, and buries his tinny racket dating back to the late 80s. Baby's Breadth is constantly interesting. 'Giving Up the Ghost' is the 'Meat Is Murder' of anti-circumcision anthems, beginning with the call 'Don't circumcise your baby!' and ranging through lines such as, 'These puritans in fear mutilate children and call it hygiene.' The song features choruses to be sung by both grown-ups and 'grown-downs' about 'medi-sin.' Panic's argument is that boys get clipped because adults are lonely and dead."" Lou: Fat chance that gibberish gets played on the radio between ""Bump Your Horny Parts Up Against My Horny Parts"" and ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately"", eh, boss? Gossett: There's more: ""On 'Honey Careen', Panic sings of meat that flowers and sucks rain. Truly he is from a place where bees flock and birds swarm. The album is divided into chapters, and Chapter Five, entitled 'The Wondering Womb or God's Hysterical Pregnancy' consists of a trilogy on par with any trio from Love's psychedelic-doom flagship Forever Changes. 'Sex Is for Children' kicks off with the line, 'Fuck for your beautiful children,' and gets bolder from there. 'Death Is Gonna Part You' is like an existential children's song from some lost, Kierkegaard-scripted episode of Sesame Street. 'Even when your love is true/ Death will part you,' Panic sings, trying to get this assertion to be viewed as comforting, while he hammers home a notion of self becoming something better later, 'a light.' The finale, 'If Enough of Us Die', argues that we could stand to lose a few of us dowdy planet-crowders. Get ready for lyrics that proclaim, 'It takes faith just to sleep/ That's for sure/ It's a monster,' and possibly my favorite closing line from an album since the end of Pavement's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: 'If enough of us die and the rest take to drinking/ You know we might find that the world is not so unkind/ Only restless."" June Panic is the opposite of cool. This album is crafted as if he's the one who came up with Shakespeare's equation that sound plus fury eventually equals diddly. Baby's Breadth so deserves the wide audience it will probably never get. You already know these songs. The sun has already hit its half-life. Goodbye, you nation of gawkers. Return to sender, etc."" Lou: Funny how this guy Bowers wrote out those italics on his suicide note. What a flake. Gossett: Somebody clean this mess up.

Shot of Love,Com.a,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62b13d1975652139107/1:1/w_160/0db576b6.jpg,2003-03-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1553-shot-of-love/,Tigerbeat6,"Break-dancing for Gundams? Wild Style for pasty 8-bit geeks? Make out music for toasters? Reviewing electronic music, you notice certain descriptions beg repeating as commonalities in various sub-genres begin to show themselves; for example, elements of electro and/or hip-hop cropped up on every IDM record released in the last year. Which is not to say things have grown stale, to suggest that tinkerers like Solar X and Team Doyobi-- whose sounds share common roots with Com.a's recent release on Tigerbeat6, the hydraulics-and-birthday cake Shot of Love-- are flogging a dead effects processor. It's more a cosmic coincidence that these artists refer back to the same points in their past, sharing common history through the technology that raised them. Now, they're old enough to apply this knowledge during twister and dodgeball. Shot of Love is Com.a's third solo disc since the disillusion of his former group, Rom=Pari. The beats here bring to mind a dozen artists, ranging from the unavoidable (Aphex Twin, Squarepusher) to the more selective (the first thing that came to mind: the Electric Chicken Music Vol. 1 compilation, on Worm Interface). Unlike Dream and Hope-- his self-released sophomore disc, whose breaks sound big, gritty and closer to the frontline-- the percussion here finds itself playing second fiddle more often than not. The biggest exception is the much-touted ""Air Scratch Filter"", the lead cut on January's One More Story 12"". It's a jet-engine backdraft that hurls a heated scratch battle headlong into the craziest 4/4 piledriver this side of an Ultimate Cheerleading competition. But by the time the sepia-toned intermission ""Am I Wrong"" rolls around, the beats have been beaten back, hidden under the floorboards, giving the melodies room to get busy and multiply, resulting in heartbreaking kaleidoscopes that propel tracks like ""Crime Of Mr. Com.a"", a stunning grid of splintered machine drums and tender analog harmonies (which only grow more abrasive and pained on the following number, ""Fickle Grief""). But the mood isn't all rainy days and weeping robots; just look at that cover. How sad can a heavily armed robo-baby in his sexual prime be? It's the sound of cybernetics that provides the inspiration for the title cut, a mobile assault field training exercise that inexplicably finds itself on the losing side of a skirmish with electro-wielding interstellar arms dealers. Just try not to imagine a 9-foot cyborg drinking 18 gallons of caffeine and endorphins when the blitzkrieg melody on ""Sick Of It"" goes off the deep end, that's all I'm saying. For this great change of pace, ""Make My Day"" takes the cake, doing the Space Raiders one better with a ditzy pop riff that must be the soundtrack of every horny android slumber party from here to the beaches of Neo-Tokyo. Com.a isn't the first act to use vintage videogames as stock for his sound banks, and he won't be the last. The gleeful drill n' bass-meets-urban thump framework that supports Shot of Love is a well-tested infrastructure, with a safe expiration date. Perhaps aware of the need to break away from the pack, Com.a infuses the beats with a precocious personality, one that saturates even the densest layers of beat sequences with a youthful Nintendo charm, although the twisted, Gummo-quoting closer, ""Hug Luv Suck"", resides in a completely different sector of the subconscious. IMost of the cuts sound fresh, plugging away like Dozers as they skitter through shirting tempos and moods: there's an emotional investment here that makes Shot of Love fly, a measured amount of representin' backed by a whole lot of love, assuring this album a place in discmen all over Saturn.","Break-dancing for Gundams?

"The Networks, The Circuits, The Streams, The Harmonies",Burnside Project,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f8b1335d7bf1698855/1:1/w_160/c8603097.jpg,2003-03-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1026-the-networks-the-circuits-the-streams-the-harmonies/,BarNone,"My Dad, like many fathers all over the world, owns a dinky VHS-C camcorder. In his intensely pragmatic way, he sees no need to operate without auto-focus and isn't keen on re-framing, working the zoom, or dealing with white balance. Still, his immobile home videos, consisting of long-takes unintentionally akin to Bill Viola's I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like, are compelling for their sheer boredom: they make you question how you're spending (or misspending) your time. That's a high-minded consideration of home video as cultural artifact when, really, they're just fucking boring. On their second full-length, ponderously titled The Networks, The Circuits, The Streams, The Harmonies, New York City's Burnside Project-- a straightforward indie rock group dabbling in electronics-- attempt to spice-up run-of-the-mill songwriting with hip/trip-hop beats and cricket chirps. Beats are corporeal; even if you aren't paying attention you can end up tapping your toe, or at best shaking your ass. Here, that's certainly the case: while the electronic bed adds three-dimensionality, the songs themselves, minus these accouterments, are encyclopedia entries for harmless college rock circa 1988. Beyond the tepid compositional skeletons, Burnside's lyrics stand-out as the main hurdle; vocalist and songwriter Richard Jankovich's attempt at Malkmus-esque punning falls flat repeatedly. As he drops a ton of pop culture detritus, I can feel him winking, nodding, and holding his fingers up in mock quotation marks. In ""Assessing Your Performance"" he resorts to ""No matter what you say/ Say it don't spray it""; ""Repeat After Me"" hinges on the wordplay of a curious two year old: ""You pass the rest with flying colors/ But can colors really fly?"" Jankovich's singsong delivery plays like spoken word from the uptight fiction manager at your local Barnes & Noble, a pallid version of Barenaked Ladies for fans of NPR and The New Yorker. Better yet, it's the Eels gone electro, the aftermath of smoking too much herb and re-naming their cat MIDI. It isn't a blasphemy. This is not an entirely awful record; it starts off fine with ""He Never Knew The Benefits Of Caffeine"" a catchy-enough take on digital surveillance and technological overload. The second track ""Cure The Pulse To Begin"" features The Mendoza Line's Shannon McArdle on background vocals, transforming the otherwise anonymous club-kid drum clatter into a tepid Lali Puna impression. Notably, I made it through ""Only Ordinary""-- the one track sung entirely by McArdle-- without wanting to call the cheese police, but even that number was way too similar to ""Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money In My Hand"". And-- I never thought I'd say this - Primitive Radio Gods do it better. Outside that pair of tolerable moments, the center of this record slips under the weight of too many sketchy word choices. ""Heavy Mettle"" comes off like Beat Poetry for fans of Pete and Pete; in ""Foreign Exchange"", Schoolhouse Rocks is passed off as pained electronica: ""If the mirror lies then who can you trust?/ The painting on the wall is so full of torture/ Indigo, yellow, ultra violet/ Paint by numbers, count with me."" To hear scratching in this context, it's like watching my grandfather do the human beatbox to Dead Prez, and sadly, it just keeps going. Ultimately, Jankovich's fascination with one-liners reminds me of a bad waiter at TGI Friday's, trying to charm a table of girls with his sunny reenactment of Slacker ""Because it changed my life, friend. You want freedom fries with that?"" In addition to Shannon McArdle, the thirteen tracks also feature contributions from Hub Moore, who's lent his vocals to Hal Hartley films; Jonny Cohen, members of Elk City, and Bar/None label owner-operator Glenn Morrow also drop by. The hyperbolic I-am-Allan-Ginsberg-writing-opaque-stuff-for-Dylan's-Desire liner notes were penned by novelist and Feelies fan Rick Moody under the pseudonym ""Tyrone Duffy""-- Moody wrote the notes as a song-by-song response to the album, and, per usual, he likes to hear himself write: ""Get your camera obscura, construct the boys in the loft with the baseball games on even if they don't actually exist except as an image entity, because isn't hurting no one, and these frames construct a filmstrip about a dog's lungs and car crashes and the sixteen decisions, and, man, that's an uplifter. Listen to the words, as the mighty river flows past."" That's sic. Which is sick. Burnside Project's one-page mentions that their songs may show up on MTV's The Real World and Road Rules; that they're so excited to be ""optioned"" by these shows is indicative of their intent: as the barely audible background blip for one or two vanilla conversations between badly adjusted, over-privileged roommates, it makes perfect sense. Still, that press byte is a sad reminder that these guys believe in what they're doing-- for all the blundering wordplay, this is more than a joke to the Burnside Project: don't let them weasel out of their bad punchlines with ""You just don't get it."" We do, guys-- we just don't like it.","My Dad, like many fathers all over the world, owns a dinky VHS-C camcorder. In his intensely pragmatic way, he ...

Apple O’,Deerhoof,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f29d034d5c69bf3b7b/1:1/w_160/4f025f93.jpg,2003-03-27 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2252-apple-o/,5RC,"Just over seven years ago, a friend of mine found a detached deer's hoof (and nothing else) by the roadside on the way to high school. Being an idiot completely unaware of the hazards associated with handling dead animal flesh, he figured it'd be a great idea to pick it up and bring it along for a day of higher education. Unfortunately-- as I've been trying to tell Ryan, who sent me this record to review immediately upon hearing that I had this story-- no zany antics ever ensued. A little absurdity in the midst of an otherwise average day, that's it. Some people asked stuff like, ""Why the hell do you have a deer hoof?"" and, ""Would you mind getting your deer leg out of my fucking lunch?"" but basically nothing happened. Still, it left an impression; harmless, real-life surrealism like watching your principal confiscate a severed leg is rarely forgotten. Though this story might seem only tangentially related, the moral is simple: Everyone needs an occasional jolt of twisted, rhapsodic hysteria to shatter the mundanity of everyday life once in a while, something to pull them out of the banal mire of geriatrics in alien glasses, tech schools, gas prices, and trips to the supermarket. Deerhoof, bless 'em, have been serving the public interest for five full albums now by playing host to these little reality-warping junkets. With each successive release, their pop acumen becomes keener, a deadly undercurrent of subversive, sugar-glazed hooks to match their ferocious blasts of noise. Apple O' is the latest head-trip from these San Fran bliss addicts, debuting as-yet unseen levels of songcraft; in just thirty minutes, I danced, I wept, I sang-- even the pandas they promised showed up. In short, Apple O' performed exactly as expected, although that in itself is a little frightening. While last year's Reveille was a similarly beautiful, bright flight, it was just unhinged enough so that, until its final moments, there was a lingering uncertainty as to its destination: It would either land in a frenetic pop playground, or allow unbridled blasts of noise to plunge it into the sea. Now it seems as though Deerhoof have transmuted Reveille's spurts of genius into a more cohesive, but slightly less astonishing consistency. Apple O' is still a fascinating trip, but from the very beginning, it's a fairly safe bet that you'll be headed somewhere very pretty, without as much worrisome turbulence. That's not a lock, naturally-- the trademark madness that's infected their earlier recordings hasn't vanished, just diminished-- but this is their most straightforward release to date. The good news is that the band's efforts to ""normalize"" (if such a word can truly be used to describe their work) has reaped great dividends. Every song they present is a staggering collage of guitars and drums, bells, tambourines, brass, and every other manner of beep or squeak under the sun, all falling in line in lush, swaying arrangements. Now, with the added ballast of an improved song-focus, Deerhoof venture into deeper waters, adapting their instrumental melange to a wider variety of styles. Dance, jazz, be-bop, 50s doo-wop, and standard jangle-pop all get thrown into the mix at varying points, while remaining inimitably in the thrall of their particular brand of noise. All that's left is for Satomi Matsuzaki's kindergarten-cute vocals to add the final, unifying glaze. As a treatise on love, romance and creation through a very cracked looking glass-- love as bridge (the card game), among other metaphors-- Apple O' functions loosely as a concept album, so its tighter cohesion might be expected. Staccato crunch and trembling lines accompany the beautiful romance of ""L'Amour Stories""; ""Dummy Discards a Heart"" reprises the blistering, start/stop dynamics and killer percussion that made ""This Magnificent Bird Will Rise"" such a highlight of Reveille. From the streetcorner serenade of ""Dinner for Two""-- a sort of J-Pop reincarnation of ""Earth Angel""-- to the solemn regret of ""Apple Bomb"", all avenues of this relatively tranquil concept are explored. And then, in a definitive, almost symbolic closing statement, Deerhoof opt for a humble, unadorned acoustic gem (""Blue Cash"") in the vein of those prep-schoolers in Belle & Sebastian, rather than any of their signature weirdness. As Matsuzaki sings, ""Play on your heartstrings a song,"" its innocence perfectly conveys everything they've spent this entire record trying to say. Once again, Deerhoof have released an album masquerading as out-of-the-blue insanity, while cleverly harboring nothing but the most basic, virally contagious pop around. Apple O' never seems quite so unpredictable as Reveille, so it's a safe bet that if you liked Reveille but found it a bit too experimental, you'll like this one better. Of course, in the age-old controversy between a steady keel of greatness or sporadic moments of true genius, genius has to take the gold, but this album's intense variety and sparklingly consistent pop songwriting make a great consolation prize.","Just over seven years ago, a friend of mine found a detached deer's hoof (and nothing else) by the ...

Slanguage,Awol OneDaddy Kev,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a161b1335d7bf1698244/1:1/w_160/faa48c1f.gif,2003-03-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/389-slanguage/,Mush,"Don't expect a Souldoubt or Number 3 on the Phone redux. This thing puts freestyles (of sorts) atop free jazz (of sorts), the ambient, funky, brushed-drum goop of Daddy Kev with the slow rasp of Awol One, whose voice has the tone of a chainsmoker robbed of all gumption by constricted bloodflow and caked-over arteries. Slanguage, Awol and Daddy's third full-length together, is a self-proclaimed experiment in free jazz, as viewed through hip-hop's eyes. A sample on the record reminds us, ""The only thing about free music is that you have a greater success of not succeeding... but the fun is when you get the good moments."" Driving this sentiment home are Awol's frontal lobe ramblings, which unfortunately act as an album-long solo with a success rate of about 30-70. Still, you have to hand it to these guys for breaking out and trying something different. On the other hand, there's Daddy Kev, arguably one of the Los Angeles underground's most visionary producers. He either hides the seams between his samples perfectly, or lets them show, their awkwardness draped naked and pure across the beats. Moreover, his style exemplifies the steady bleeding of hip-hop culture into the more highbrow aspects of art. Daddy Kev stirs classical music into his highly thumping palette of beats, and he's adept at choosing the most beautiful and bombastic cuts. Slanguage is, of course, heavier on the free jazz than ever, but he doesn't confine his music to just slapping some skronk over a 4/4 bass track. This shit is deep. An opera diva's howl, the triumphant, pixilated theme from Defender, scratching by L.A. turntablist D-Styles, and the tense crescendos of free drumming all converge in the same ten seconds of ""Grey Skys in Psycho-Delic Rgb"". ""Reflections for Scratching Your Face Off"" is as traditional as Daddy gets, burying scraps of stringed instruments (an upright bass solo, an unidentifiable, abstract cello-- Bartok or Kurtag, maybe) under the jubilant slapping of toms gone crazy with the boom-bap. But, you know, there's still Awol's tragically tuneless whine-sing pissing all over it. The reason the guys in cLOUDDEAD got away with their dreamy, stream-of-consciousness shoegazer rap is because we were convinced they were huffing gas. Drug addiction is a good excuse for almost anything, when you get right down to it. When people ask, ""What were you thinking when you threw your baby in the dumpster?"" at cocktail parties, you can respond intimately, ""It was the cocaine,"" after which you and your companion will laugh gaily and heartily into your martinis. Awol should try harder to convince us he's on a freebasing binge, 'cause right now, much of his delivery and style comes off like apathy. ""Yeah, thanks. That was a poem called, 'Fuck That Shit',"" he says apprehensively, at the beginning of an anti-TV, stand-up comedy style confessional over Daddy's bluesy piano sample. Even compared to Awol's less-than-brilliant collab with Fat Jack, Propaganda, he sounds like he's phoning it in from a public landline on frigging Guam. Lazy mumbling is part of his style-- maybe an unavoidable facet of his gravelly voice-- but at points, you'd bet dollars he just doesn't give a shit. This is more frustrating in comparison to tracks where his solid style almost brings it, as on ""Audio Bibles Are Written on Stone Tablet Tables"" and ""Finger Paint with Bloodlike War Paint"", and on tracks where he really brings it, as on the bar-raising/hip-hop head-mocking ""Montgomery Burns' Quest for Power"". On the latter, he proves, if only for a brief moment, that he's capable of ripping out a rapid-fire spray of sick arrhythms. It's obvious that, for the majority of Slanguage, Awol was gingerly exploring his own interpretation of hip-hop/free-jazz vocals. This time around, the experiment mostly crapped out, and Daddy Kev's fantastically freaky psychedelic genius free-jazz funky classical hybrid is left to wipe up all the ass.

Quicksand/Cradlesnakes,Califone,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4dcb1335d7bf1698a76/1:1/w_160/c09c81fd.jpg,2003-03-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11697-quicksandcradlesnakes/,Thrill Jockey,"There used to be a quote somewhere on the Perishable website about Red Red Meat's final album, There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight, that said something like, ""God made us stop for a while after this one."" There's a kernel of truth there. Manger came at the end of a intensely creative cycle for Red Red Meat, where they evolved from the noisy blues-punk band of their self-titled debut, through the 70s-informed grunge of Jimmywine Majestic, and then up an even steeper arc with the sound experiments of Bunny Gets Paid. The Red Red Meat of Star Above the Manger sounded like a band heavy with noise and density, ready to implode. Tim Rutili's post-Meat project, Califone, which kept most of his previous band's members, started somewhere near Star Above the Manger but gradually drifted toward calmer waters. With Califone's second EP and debut full-length, Roomsound, Rutili was able to explore his deep love of folk music, and he alternated his own take on the murder ballad tradition with jagged rock songs that touched on late-period Meat. Lately, another side of Califone has emerged, an atmospheric improv outfit that released a record of film music called Deceleration One. Califone's sonic thumbprint seems well suited to soundtrack work, but the instrumental side of the band, while unique, isn't what makes it great. Califone lives and dies on the strength of Tim Rutili's songs. Rutili has confessed his love for Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music collection, and a large number of his recent songs have been informed by those ancient styles. This development hasn't always been for the best. One essential feature of folk music is that it has be easy to remember, and a certain melodic immediacy and simplicity helps songs get passed down through generations. While Califone's work has been consistently strong, I've sometimes felt like Rutili's focus on folk has shortchanged his melodic gifts. Quicksand/Cradlesnakes is the fleshed-out and focused songwriter's showcase I've been hoping for. In a way, Quicksand/Cradlesnakes is like a summation of all that Califone is about, and the first three tracks alone touch on almost everything the band has done to date. The opening ""One"" is a spacy one-minute instrumental interlude that would sound great behind an experimental film, and it bleeds into the slow country of ""Horoscopic.amputation.honey"", which is built around Rutili's piano and groaning harmonies. Halfway through, the track evolves into anthemic gospel-tinged rock in the tradition of the Stones' ""Shine a Light"", driving the song home with a fantastic refrain that features the typically mysterious line, ""Amputated years are growing back a new shade."" Then comes the gorgeous ""Michigan Girls"", so welcoming it almost seems like a nursery rhyme, mostly just voice and guitar, but with nice cello swells and gentle percussion. The delicacy and subtlety of the percussion throughout might have something to do with Perishable house producer Brian Deck sitting this one out (Graeme Gibson of Boas recorded and mixed). The remainder of Quicksand/Cradlesnakes continues to blend styles and refine previously established directions. ""Your Golden Ass"" is a rough, overdriven boogie track demonstrating that Califone haven't completely abandoned their punk roots. The old, weird American vibe of ""Million Dollar Funeral"" finds Rutili writing his very best song in the familiar style, with an old-timey tune worthy of the greats, performed with just voice, guitar and a fiddle doubling on melody. ""When Leon Spinx Moved to Town"" is a slow, black, moody rock song that sounds a bit like ""Bunny Gets Paid"", only more direct and forceful. The midtempo ""Vampiring Again"" is as relaxed and immediately catchy as mid-70s Fleetwood Mac, but Lindsay Buckingham would never have thought to add the hyper-distorted powerchord fills. In the end, the consistency of this album in the face of such diversity is inspiring. The songs, interludes, pacing and sequencing are all as they should be, helping to make Quicksand/Cradlesnakes Califone's best record.","There used to be a quote somewhere on the Perishable website about Red Red Meat's final album, There's ...

Selling Live Water,Sole,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a5c0084474cd0c052f/1:1/w_160/231a7b25.jpg,2003-03-26 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7319-selling-live-water/,Anticon,"Sole's declamations, rapid-fire syllables and message-ramming lyrics-- pounding idea after idea into your head-- make him sound like an inspirational speaker, stalking the hotel conference room stage during some ""Confront the 'Baddest Poet' Within"" seminar. Maybe I get that image from knowing that Sole is the ""business bad boy and catalyst"" of the Anticon hip-hop collective, the guy who can count the coins and keep his peers' chins up in the thankless world of underground rapping. He has self-confidence to spare, but knows you've gotta be willing to work for it. On earlier records like Bottle of Humans and Learning to Walk, Sole varied the pace, taking it easy a few times, but on his new disc he's jogging back and forth, dishing out rhymes thick as weeds, and rapping at a speed that's a half-tick too fast for the average brain to parse comfortably. The lyrics are dense, but they're honest and blunt: he bares himself on this record, to keep with the trademark emotional nakedness of Anticon artists. If you aren't rhyming about hating your family, losing your job or beating off, you might as well quit and hand in your poetry encoding ring (he even slips in his non-MC name ""Tim"" to lower the mask a little further). Kicking off with ""Da Baddest Poet"", Sole fesses up to every cultural crime a white man can commit. He's a slacker (""Jobs ain't nothing but free pens and long distance calls""), a yuppie (""The dog got birth control"") and an unrepentant wigger who's ""wanted to be black since age fourteen,"" though lyric for lyric, he harkens more to the Native Americans. Like them, he ""learned to eat pain like a sundae snack."" We later learn his hairline's receding, though he's only in his mid-twenties; the guy is so honest, he could make his own mirror cry. Still, you have to break yourself to grow, and you'll never hear Sole drop his self-confident act-- he's cutting himself down just to make himself stronger, and when he's done with that he turns his anger around to the rest of the world: stupid wars, the corrupt politics of fighting terrorism, the thoughtless pursuit of nine-to-five success. Yet the relentlessness is his shortcoming; Sole never stops, slows down or mixes things up, and an hour of this can wear you out. It's too frenetic to have much atmosphere, and it doesn't have the variety of, say, Sage Francis' more intriguing Personal Journals. The beats-- from producers like Odd Nosdam, Jel and Alias-- are good, but not the most exciting or head-expanding work you'll hear from these guys. Sole never finds a track that just plain kills, like ""Famous Last Words"" from Bottle of Humans. People take sides between Anticon and Def Jux as if they have some kind of underground East Coast/West Coast rivalry, as if Sole and El-P will face off, call each other ""honkey"", then run home and write in their diaries. But if it's a free country, would it be fair to prefer Anticon when they record for Mush Records, where the electronic/ambient mood wards off the brash low-fidelity of their own label? Whether you dig it all or prefer him in small doses, Sole has never sounded more keyed up, heady and on target than he does on Selling Live Water, and its wrap-up is almost anthemic. Ignoring the strangely soft-hitting epilogue ""Ode to the War on Terrorism"", Sole ends the album with a title track, one that sets off the light show and hammers home his message. He plows through dizzying images of bullshit, laying out career advice, war criticism, slams on ""hip-hop nazis"" and everyone else who got in his way, or who could ever get in yours. An electric guitar loop soars and the choir kicks in: this is Sole's ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". He's taken some blows, the world looks tough and the balance of man and nature is fucked sideways, but he's triumphant, and he owns his future. And he's here to say that you can too.","Sole's declamations, rapid-fire syllables and message-ramming lyrics-- pounding idea after idea into your head-- make him sound like an ...

Transfiguration of Vincent,M.

There's something running through it that broadcasts timelessness and defies genre constraints-- quite a feat, considering how M. Ward's previous outings had pegged him as a modern-day alt-country troubadour, tied to tradition despite promise that suggested he might one day transcend its confines. For Transfiguration of Vincent, M. Ward has invited collaborators who bring full flesh to his music, landing at the nexus of melody-drenched pop, Delta blues, Wall of Sound glow, ragtime, Appalachian folk, and about a half-dozen other styles. With this album, Ward moves onto the same block as Sparklehorse, Pinetop Seven, Calexico, Lambchop, and a host of other artists who draw from backwoods phantasmagoria and disparate genres. Over the past year or so, I've been really drawn into the world that musicians like Ward inhabit. There's a sort of spiritual gravity to music that exists in the cracks between genres and passing movements, and because it can mix-and-match the entire history of music, it's an aesthetic that's unlikely to run short of ideas any time soon. This album manages to cross a great deal of terrain without actually feeling eclectic-- there are too many elements working in concert with each other for true stylistic shifts to occur-- even while containing variety in spades. It doesn't hurt matters that Ward's singing and writing has developed into something truly special and unique. On the swinging flamenco blues number ""Sad, Sad Song"", Ward's voice is an impossible blend of gravel and silk as he croons, ""I went to my momma/ I said momma, please/ What do you do when your true love leaves?/ She said the hardest thing in the world to do/ Is to find somebody who believes in you."" They may be an acquired taste for some, but Ward's pipes are a perfect fit for his songs, moving through the decades with the same ease as his music, and taking on music hall boisterousness and bluesy weariness by turns, always full of soul. On the instrumental ""Duet for Guitars #3"", Ward takes things to the back porch for a brilliant, kinetic moment of levity, but otherwise, Transfiguration of Vincent is laden with heavy emotions and musings on death, loss and violence. ""Helicopter"" whirs with energy, bounding on a steady rhythm, Ward expounding on some sort of fantasy about rescuing innocents from the violence of the world. Through the nostalgic haze of ""Outta My Head"", amidst fluttering organs and synths, Ward sings, ""A playful little kitten/ Met a playful little bird/ And then off with its head/ Off with its head/ Oh my."" And his rough falsetto pulls all the emotion from the chorus of ""Undertaker"", where, over an ornate bed of acoustic guitar, theremin and muffled violin, he moans, ""If you're gonna leave/ You better call the undertaker/ Take me under, undertaker/ Take me home."" There are moments on Transfiguration of Vincent for which words fail-- particularly the cover of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", where Ward's low-key, acoustic delivery reveals a surprisingly emotional, fragile piece-- and while that may be an extremely uncomfortable position for a music reviewer, for a listener, it's the best place you could possibly be. I would say ""enjoy it while it lasts,"" but you've got all the time in the world.","Some time in 2035, I'm going to pull this album out, and it's going to sound just as ...

"When You Land Here, It's Time to Return",Flake Music,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdaf5e6ef959693230ec/1:1/w_160/1a8c547d.jpg,2003-03-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3079-when-you-land-here-its-time-to-return/,OmnibusOmnibus,"Awww, bands are so cute in their impressionable stage. I'm not being condescending, I swear-- they really are cute; any of us who've picked up a Gibson knockoff were probably musical Silly Putty at one point or another. As a peace offering to illustrate my complete lack of condescension, I fully disclose that my high school band would frequently cover Pavement, AC/DC, and Phish. You can only imagine the flipper-baby monstrosities that were our original songs (here's a taste: one was called ""Jabberwocky""). Of course, not too many of us had teenage bands that metamorphosed into a top-of-the-line pop act like The Shins, so we haven't had to suffer the overproud-Mom embarrassment of having these early days publicly released. Omnibus Records is happy to play that evil role, however, re-releasing the full-length effort by Flake Music, an early incarnation of The Shins. When You Land Here, It's Time to Return is far from an amateur souvenir of Battle of the Bands-won studio time, but at times it unflinchingly illustrates a group that wears its influences on its sleeve like a stock car wears its sponsors. ""Burnt Valve"" is the most obvious culprit, a song so enthralled with There's Nothing Wrong with Love (check out the Dug-ish nasal ""yeaahhhhhh"" and extended mid-fi jamout) that it makes Flake Music sound like those weirdos that sit in the art museum all day, drawing exact replicas of famous portraits. But hell, it's such a believable, lovable forgery, only a tyrannical dictator could hate it; Martsch himself would probably be fooled into thinking he wrote it. And if recorded sound is the canvas art of the future, it's gonna take a pretty sharp team of curators to separate it from a precious BTS original. Later in the program, other giants of mid-90s indie rock serve as occasional muse to Flake Music-- on ""Structo"" it's Weezer; on ""The Shins"" (yes, they had a song called The Shins), it's Guided by Voices. So the record would serve nicely as an on-the-cheap retro capsule soundtrack, should I ever make a movie of my high school years. And given the 1997 original born-on date of the album, and the considerable zest with which each tribute is performed, the affair is extremely forgivable. This is, after all, the kind of bedroom music Pitchfork was conceived to back in the day, so don't mind us if we feel a wee bit nostalgic. Most of the floundering here is due to frontman James Mercer still hunting for a comfortable voice. Ironically, opening track ""Spanway Hits"" captures much of The Shins' formula right off the bat, Mercer straining for the upper registers and the band all perky New Mexico sunshine. It's as clear to the listener as it apparently was to the band that ""Spanway Hits"", and the other crystal ball moment, ""Deluca"", marked the correct path for he and his mates to travel, even if neither tune approaches the lowest rung of Oh, Inverted World! That's not to say that fervent Shin-lickers won't love the dickens out of Flake Music, and that less committed Mercerites won't find something to love in its thirty-minute runtime. I might poke a bit of fun at the album's indie-classic sponge act, but playa-hatas can't touch the writer of a diamond like ""New Slang"", a song so good I didn't even hold its McDonald's co-option against it, instead just submitting to the subconscious urge to eat french fries whenever it played. While the future of The Shins is highly cloudy, most indie-pop bands tending to be one-album-stand types preying upon our ears, it's gratifying to know that their pubertal stage was far from painfully awkward.","Awww, bands are so cute in their impressionable stage.

Castaways and Cutouts,The Decemberists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e6c0084474cd0c0f2d/1:1/w_160/55d6168a.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2241-castaways-and-cutouts/,HushHush,"If Jeff Mangum had never been born, Colin Meloy could have assumed Jeff Mangum's current status as indie rock's consummate pop songwriter freak. Which, of course, would mean some other wild-eyed kid from Montana would have had to be Colin Meloy. The Real Meloy, in this Trading Places-themed Twilight Zone, would have filled in for Mangum's nasal warble and given the world the sweet gift of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea with his band Neutral Milk Hotel, while New Guy would front a band named, say, The Decemberists, who would shamelessly mine the sparkly folk-fuzz (sans-fuzz) of that most lauded of Elephant 6 bands. The Decemberists would be a tad poppier, and maybe a tad sweeter than their key influence, but fronted by a voice so close to Mangum's that few could tell the difference. Some say this may even have actually happened. Some say it's happening right now. Such a mix-up is understandable (even if it may seem quite the opposite on paper): The Decemberists stick to the same kind of heavy acoustic folk-rock and freakish lyrical balladry that fueled Neutral Milk Hotel's rise to power. Fortunately, their music also possesses enough unique twists to distinguish it from simple mimicry. The most obvious is the band's often baroque instrumentation, which generally makes for more elaborate arrangements than those of their stylistic forbearer. Hammond organ and subtle theremin flesh out the mix, each adding an anachronistic spin on the otherwise quaint jangle of strings and guitars hearkening to some dusty, distant past. Melodic organ riffs, meanwhile, slightly warp the old-time illusion of the music-- the better to compliment the absurd, rag-tag world at the center of this band's dreamy fictionalizations. The Decemberists' is a land of ghosts and petticoats, ""crooked French-Canadians"" gut-shot while running gin, bedwetters and gentlemen suitors, abandoned wastrels and pickpockets. It's also a realm of bizarre historical dreamscapes and snazzy wordplay: ""And just to lie with you/ There's nothing that I wouldn't do/ Save lay my rifle down,"" sings Meloy in the bittersweet hallucination ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"". Time and again, these unhappy tales and fantastic allegories ring out over strangely soothing, rolling folk that seldom breaks from a dense, melancholy haze. Only once does Castaways and Cutouts fully escape the hypnotic pull of its darkling bedtime stories; ""July, July!"" may be the album's only genuinely happy moment, decked out in lush harmonies and fly-away choruses that clip their wings just shy of soaring towards anything too grand. And the band actually makes this singular elated moment stick by remaining reasonably understated-- despite the temptation there must have been to launch into a full-on celebration in the midst of such omnipresent malaise, the song is content to simply smile, permeating the surrounding bleakness with a subtle aura of peaceful contentment. The constant sobriety of the rest of these tracks does wear thin now and then-- the inclusion of another similarly uplifting tune might have made the record somewhat more effective-- but the somber fables of Castaways and Cutouts remain compelling nonetheless. The Decemberists rarely put forth individually gripping songs, yet somehow, the result is a remarkable whole, an autonomous unit. From the opening cry of, ""My name is Leslie Anne Levine/ My mother birthed me down a dry ravine,"" to the album's exhausting conclusion, the fever never breaks. So, if Jeff Mangum really is on permanent vacation, we're going to need a successor. Few bands seem as worthy of inheriting his twisted empire as The Decemberists.","If Jeff Mangum had never been born, Colin Meloy could have assumed Jeff Mangum's current status as indie rock ...

New Deal,Waco Brothers,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b113d19756521398e3/1:1/w_160/eafa2719.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8551-new-deal/,Bloodshot,"My apologies to allergists; this review is covered in dust. A layer of germy sediment covers The Waco Brothers' image as aging, hard-drinking, boot-sporting journeymen. Another covers their lyrics, which alternate rootin'-tootin' cliches and look-ma-no-fascism politics (think Asleep at the Wheel Against the Machine). Another covers their sound, which is, you know, prairie-punk or saloon-wave or whatever one is supposed to call self-consciously country-western iconoclast-pop in 2003. And decades of dust adorn, inches deep, the review-twerp complaint that I have to make: This amazing live band can't [sneeze, wipe eyes] capture their stage magic [adjust protective paper mask] in the studio. Latecomers to the work of Jon Langford (can I get a show of hands for those familiar with him by way of the Palace Brothers' ""For the Mekons et al"" or Sally Timms' cover of ""No More Rides""?) should know that he's a Windy City Welshman/liberal self-recast as a scrappy outlaw. And he ain't afraid to channel Sirs McGowan and Bragg to set that image in stone. The band's pedigree argues for the moniker Cred'N'Crud: they've got two Mekons, a Deano who swaps vox with Langford, and then guys from Jesus Jones and KMFDM. Yet, certain blissfully raucous moments on this album make one imagine a Clash that kept going, that became semi-competent at barn-dance swing, and set off a wave of copycat bands with names like Rodeo Chaos, Harvest Havoc, Sourgum Rebellion, Back Porch Culture Jam, and The Lone Star Radicals. I had my crack team of scientistadors do lab experiments to figure out how the Wacos can be so hackneyed, yet still worth rooting for on transparent anthems such as ""No Heart"" and ""New Deal Blues"": the results were inconclusive. They did, however, prove that ""The Lie"" was better Farrar than Farrar, and that the minimal solo on the cover of ""Johnson to Jones"" is right up there with CCR's finest. My army of rhetoric-wizards and debate engineers declared that the Wacos think that their Bush-bashing is more revolutionary than it is, though they did note that the Wacos could knock a prefab Nashvillian such as Toby Keith on his super-seized, truck-pitching, hay-baling butthole. My resident visual artists' coalition proposed a sculpture, inspired by the Wacos, of humans trying to mate with jukeboxes, using hammers and sickles as contraceptives. My freeloading uncle said that ""AFC Song""'s manic-depressive espousal of defeat as a route to victory and destructiveness as a path to creativity was copacetic enough to replace Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"" as his afternoon nap-score. My pet Catholic priest pronounced the flat-funk ""Just No Way"" a source of shame for all mortalkind. This band is aware that they're pretending, making up the genre of Chicagit-cowcore as they go along; that knowledge weirdly gives them a kind of cockiness associated with authenticity. They're keen to their schtick: selling a sold notion back to itself. And the idea of linking ""progressive"" rhetoric with a style known for clinging resolutely to its roots is kind of genius, like taking a jackhammer to the road to nowhere. S'true, the Waco Brothers rock live, all loud and fun and sweaty and unbowed. But the same could be said of Hank III. They need to make a record as vibrant as their activist spirit; otherwise this honky-tonk Sex Pistols pattern will have people saying they're so at home on the range they've become pretty vacant.","My apologies to allergists; this review is covered in dust.

Supper,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47a9d034d5c69bf309a/1:1/w_160/5bab4870.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7278-supper/,Drag City,"For over twenty years, Bill Callahan has been finding devious new ways of defying expectations. Whether playing the role of the lo-fi pioneer, the boisterous noise-making prankster, or the darkly smirking balladeer, Callahan has always made music brimming with tension and complexity. When Callahan is at his best, a squealing, distorted guitar can break your heart, a rumination on death can make you laugh, and a joke can make you hate yourself. In a sense, Callahan's best work is often the most difficult to listen to-- a tapestry of revelation, humor, despair, beauty, and noise hardly qualifies as easy listening. Supper, Callahan's eleventh proper album as Smog, is a lovely collection of songs. Alternating between confident mid-tempo rockers and acoustic portraits of domestic bliss, this is without doubt one of his most accessible efforts to date. Which is exactly why it's not his best. Though certainly not a bad album, Supper lacks the unique, often disturbing touch that makes the best of Callahan's work so compelling. And though the more subversive side of Callahan's songwriting does occasionally manifest itself in more subdued ways, it's not enough to render the album anything more than pleasant. Callahan opens Supper with ""Feather by Feather"", a song that bears a striking resemblance to the works of Drag City labelmate Will Oldham. In fact, Oldham's Master and Everyone serves as a good point of reference for the more whimsical side of this record. Master and Everyone marked an even more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of Oldham's I See a Darkness than 2001's Ease Down the Road, as well as from Oldham's preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and having sex with Death. As a result, Master and Everyone was prettier, but also more reliant on traditional signifiers of ""pretty"" than on Oldham's unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, Supper suppresses both Callahan's talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and his tendency towards understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar. Still, ""Feather by Feather""-- along with ""Vessel in Vain"", ""Truth Serum"" and ""Our Anniversary""-- stands as a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre. Callahan's Hammond organ, Ken Champion's pedal steel and Sarabeth Tucek's breathy backing vocals combine to paint the very same portrait of subdued domesticity that Oldham seemed to be working towards on Master and Everyone. Sadly, a close examination of this portrait reveals paint-by-numbers outlines faintly detectable behind the color and texture of Callahan's unique baritone. Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on Supper are vastly superior to its bland, awkward electric rockers. As the BBC Session recording of ""I Break Horses"" featured in this year's singles compilation Accumulation: None clearly demonstrated, Callahan is more than capable of carrying off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed Callahan seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both heartless and heartbroken. The heavier numbers on Supper, however, simply drop Callahan's disaffected voice over displaced Rolling Stones-isms. Jim O'Rourke's Insignificance proved that such a formula can yield incredible results when executed with wit and finesse, but here, the awkwardness that makes much of Callahan's music so heartrending doesn't always work in his favor. Regardless, Supper is not without strong moments. The album's last tracks, ""Driving"" and ""A Guiding Light"", actually break from the disappointingly formulaic sound that Callahan utilizes for the album's majority. ""Driving"" turns the record's serene acoustic arrangements into something chaotic, layering plucked banjo and sparse, arrhythmic drumming atop occasional flourishes of warm, clean electric guitar. As the song progresses, it seems to become both more structured and overwhelming, as its ever-expanding stratum seems to congeal into a more regular pattern. ""A Guiding Light"" most closely resembles the Smog of days past, with Callahan's chilling voice accompanied only by a haunting, repetitive guitar figure and minimal percussion. Unfortunately, even these two relatively strong songs don't hold a candle to the greatest in Smog's back catalog. Throughout his career, Callahan has managed to wear many aesthetic masks while still coming through with something unique and interesting. At his best, he's evoked vivid, complex imagery with a single well-placed word or sound. It would be nice to say that he simply hides behind the machinations of docile country-folk and steady riff-rock on Supper to more insidiously convey his distinctively dark musical sense. But I get the distinct impression that all of Callahan's cards are on the table here-- where beneath the instrumentation there once lied depth and cutting truth, there is now only complacency.","For over twenty years, Bill Callahan has been finding devious new ways of defying expectations.

Star Witness,Snitches,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a492b1335d7bf16989ca/1:1/w_160/b36d6006.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7301-star-witness/,Oh! Tonito,"A band name like the Snitches is the world's shortest press kit. Nothing would thrill me more than to tell you these sons of Montreal play calypso or spin Goa trance, but the dismal truth has, in essence, already been spoken. Of course they're a fucking garage band. Sheesh. Star Witness, out on Oh! Tonito-- a newish Michigan label that appears to be a Le Grand Magistery offshoot-- is that saddest of things: a perfunctory run through a waning fad. Which, in a review, usually calls for an equally lazy round of unflattering similes, commencing...now! The Snitches are like the Hives without the evil wit, Mooney Suzuki without the electric sweat, the Raveonettes without the elegance, the Strokes without the entitlement. In fact, the only compliment I can pay this band, and the reason I find myself straining to say anything nice at all, is that their mediocrity never seems calculated. It's not a ploy or a gambit-- the Snitches make genuinely, honestly shitty music. The album's opener, ""December 21"", is a rote four-chorder with a remarkably honest opening statement: ""I tried to get it right/ But I'm a lazy boy."" Things pick up somewhat by the third track, ""Right Before My Eyes"", wherein the lead Snitch works up a glammy sneer a la Bowie by-way-of Spacehog by-way-of the Interpreters. All hope is then promptly dashed with the arrival of towering twin embarrassments: ""Willie"", a slick bore that sounds like all the other Canadians rockers pogoing across MTV2, and the dread ""Perfect Gentleman"". This one starts with lonesome-seagull sounds (a class A felony in itself), segues into a pseudo-Latin centerpiece, then throws it away, suffering a brief attack of fuzzy chorus before bringing the fucking seagulls back. The band fares a tad better on ""Sugar Mommy"", a straight-up appeal for female sponsorship with a nice vintage whiff to it. In fact, it might generally behoove the Snitches to go full-on retro: the bluesy ""Gets Me Down"" and ""Swallow"" are the best tracks on Star Witness, and not coincidentally the least faddish. The blues might also break the Snitches of their abstract poetry habit, which at one point sent me to the liner notes to make sure these guys are not Quebecois. Lines like ""This must be cool/ I can pretend that we are one and that we laugh,"" and ""Slut Shark oozes wax across the dance floor"" scan like lobotomized Robert Pollard prose translated to French and back. The Snitches' final damnation is their overreaching meta-concept of ratting people out. Their name figures in at least two songs, and a murky promotion on the band's web site invites you to ""finger a Snitch."" Thanks but no thanks, I'm keeping my nose well clean of this baby powder.","A band name like the Snitches is the world's shortest press kit. Nothing would thrill me more than to ...

"Atheists, Reconsider",LiarsOneida,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d8eb335119a49ec8a8/1:1/w_160/080d0ee2.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5997-atheists-reconsider/,Arena Rock,"Hell, or a simple cessation of consciousness: that's what Atheists have to look forward to. Pascal, that practical Frenchman, once countered atheism by suggesting one might as well believe in God, because really, what do you have to lose? Well Blaise, our dignity, for starters, and that's plenty. Art-funk luminaries Liars and schizo-psychers Oneida aim to embody the Truth and the Light, and put your faith in them if you must, but neither brings quite enough here to justify this record's proclamation; however these NYC evangelists see it, this split CD will not find many converts. Given the dynamism of both groups, there's a surprising dearth of gripping sounds on Atheists, Reconsider. The greatest disappointment is that Liars-- the more easily and readily revered prophets-- are mostly at fault for the record's shortcomings, while Oneida, whom I'd pegged as a babbling cadre of zealots, are the true saviors. And I hate to paint this in terms of a competition, but given the nature of the disc, one band's going to show up the other; it's inevitable. Each act puts forth three tracks: a pair of still-warm newborns and a third cover version, of the other band's material. Even the least imaginative of their followers can surely see the potential in this arrangement: Oneida could have re-christened ""Every Day is a Child with Teeth"" in acid, turning its frayed nerves and pent-up disorder into the penultimate bad trip, a seven-minute sermon on a simple commandment. Liars had the chance to force the spacey lilt of ""Rose and Licorice"" to submit to their brutal, gladiatorial clatter, but the chance for such clean juxtaposition of styles comes along just this side of ""never"", and when it finally comes time for the bands to clash head on, they play it completely straight. ""Letdown"" just scratches the surface-- creatively speaking, this is a a sharp plummet. No friction, no sparks; each band cozies up to the songs, makes nice with them and pretty soon, it's hard to care who did what to whom, since these new testaments aren't as exciting. Still, the revelation is noteworthy, in that both cover tracks stand proudly in the face of the source material, among the better work in each band's repertoire (a lofty perch with no room for the pair of new Liars tracks). On one hand, they deserve credit for steadfastly adhering to a concept, never buckling to expectation, mostly ignoring their audience. The Fins to make Us More Fish-Like EP barely hinted at this transition: ""All in All a Careful Party"" and ""Dorothy Taps the Toe of the Tinman"" sound nothing like Liars' established approach to post-post-punk. The band have turned a corner into pure experimentalism here: melody is a thing of the past, a relic, forsaken in favor of strange assemblages, noises and rhythms. The vital, spastic energy that flowed through their earlier material is drugged, twitching and mumbling in a hazy murmur. Careful study peels back the layers of these tracks, and lends an appreciation for their place within the scope of the record. Though the Liars' cuts are supremely inaccessible, moody pieces, their chaotic, indecipherable babel plays against Oneida's monolithic tower. Oneida set their cuts on full-blast, turning out some of the most evocative music they've ever produced. ""Privilege"" is a pummeling, concussive blow to the senses, consuming itself before it has a chance to wear the listener down; it's straightforward, driving psych-rock on par with any of their early work, though it still pales-- like most of their material-- to ""Fantastic Morgue"". If the whole record is just one twisted parable, ""Fantastic Morgue"" is its enlightening conclusion. An epic of fuzzed-out rock melodrama like this requires some faith-- if you run toward the light sans a pure heart, its blinding riff might reduce you to ashes. Lyrics like ""One if by land/ And seven by sea/ Take away ten/ You're still ugly"" shatter the pretentious nature of this mostly secular psalm, admitting that concept exceeds execution on Atheists, Reconsider, despite occasional moments of conviction.

Son,Jeff Hanson,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1985e6ef95969320208/1:1/w_160/6c4189f7.jpg,2003-03-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3732-son/,Kill Rock Stars,"It seems like an oxymoron, but rock has benefited enormously from singers who really shouldn't have been singing. Traditionally speaking, I'm talking about frustrated soul singers from Jagger on down, but off-kilter frontmen have been falling into place since Lou Reed first pursed his lips. Especially in recent years: Mike Patton and Craig Wedren, for instance, could each take up opera, but, why would they when rock is so accommodating and comparatively unlimited. As long as musicians are willing to steal outright from everything fresh and beautiful in this world, rock has no expiration date. As rigid as the form often seems, the fact that it never excludes solely on the basis of style or natural ability is one of its saving graces. As a singer, Jeff Hanson should've been a lot of things. He probably should've been a chick, for one-- how his kind of breathy falsetto can come from any throat with an Adam's apple attached is far beyond me. His voice is presumably what first caught Kill Rock Stars' attention; it was the first unsolicited demo to result in a KRS signing in years. Considering Hanson's barely-legal age and sky-high range, he seems like a lock for emo stardom, and his old band M.I.J. did the ""soaring"" thing as well as anybody else, for years. Which is why the sharp turn toward traditional pop on his first solo outing Son is pretty striking, both in terms of how perfectly he nails the archetype and how otherworldly it sounds coming from those pipes. For its first 20 seconds, Son is nearly bland, the acoustic opener ""Hiding Behind the Moon"" cribbing liberally and shamelessly from that old ""More Than Words"" power- ballad strum (complete with pensive guitar-slappin'). When Hanson's voice glides in, though, it easily fills in the space between every cliché with an oddly elfin assurance. It helps that his phrasing and arrangements are laser-guided, but it's that glassy timbre that makes the sinuous rub of descending harmony and ascending melody in the chorus so goddamn gorgeous. Without employing any vocal tricks or theatrics, Hanson does unheard-of things with almost every syllable; even the background vocals get the magic-larynx treatment. On the graceful rocker ""You Are The Reason"" he could be mistaken for a synthesizer's wash, and the la-la-la's in ""As Honest As A Liar Can Be"" sound like the eerie exhalations of some angelic backup trio rising to heaven right after a tour bus crash. Which is not to say any of this is at all heavy or depressing: Hanson gets his share of Elliot Smith comparisons, and they're all right on, especially when it's just Jeff and his guitar (as the majority of these songs are). The sharp Anglo pronunciation and aloof minor-key melodies make the influence a little too pronounced on some of the songs, but luckily, they adhere to Smith's standards of quality as well. Hanson's distinguishing characteristics are just as striking, however, as he manages to strip away just about every ounce of angst and damage, leaving the pure uplift of pop.","It seems like an oxymoron, but rock has benefited enormously from singers\n\ who really shouldn't have been singing ...

DJ Kicks,Tiga,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12cb1335d7bf16981c1/1:1/w_160/8a4da7da.jpg,2003-03-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8056-dj-kicks/,!K7,"There's a metaphor hidden in the picture of Tiga on the cover of this mix. As always, the Canadian DJ looks like a doll: made-up and over-styled, otherworldly, and proud as ever of his unnaturally slim hips. But-- as always-- he also looks like he doesn't belong there; like the worst yearbook portraits, the person in the picture seems slightly out-of-place, stiff and uncomfortable in someone else's clothes. Just imagine his hand under his chin in a ""thoughtful"" pose, knowing there's a devastating pimple smeared over with foundation. The boudoir pictured here belongs the Tiga of champagne-or-cocaine European electro, the Tiga who wrapped up a trend's worth of International Deejay Gigolos singles with his American Gigolo mix and gave them a public face with his half-assed smash-hit cover of ""Sunglasses at Night."" But trends-- especially the type you can dance to-- are built to mutate, and the sound of those Miss Kittin and Vitalic singles is already a bit, as they say, last year. But that's only the portrait. The good news for us is that the boudoir and wardrobe are, and have always been, rentals: Tiga was delivering the well-groomed tech-house well before electro started clashing, and now-- as the rigid swirl of that first thrilling pop wave spirals off in a dozen directions-- he shows up to each party in different suits. Admittedly, his novelty-tie cover of Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"" was probably more fun for him than it was for us, but on this contribution to the DJ Kicks mix series, he's not only resplendent, he's at home, digging well beyond the obvious to give us a mix that's both refreshing and all Tiga. The brief detour through Gigolo grind has brought him back to his best pair of cigarette-leg jeans: a drippy, soulful, and surprisingly light-touch party mix of vividly housey electro, the usual grainy fog suddenly broken by bright lights and the lingering smiles of Soft Cell, ABC, maybe even Cameo. It's only five minutes in, for instance, when Playgroup's instrumental mix of Chromeo's ""You're So Gangsta"" gives you the good-time vapors with-- praise heaven-- a saxophone solo, closing its eyes and dancing rapturously over the teched-up echo of a funk guitar lick. The next few tracks trade techno grids with disco bass grooves and squeaky clavi-funk, shaking and chuckling their way up to a necessary high point: DFA's hand-clapping remix of Le Tigre's ""Deceptacon"" struts happily along like Stevie Wonder with riot-grrl cheerleading. The whole first half of this mix is a flat-out good time: it's like watching a hipster's scowl gradually crumble. There's still the deep, rich pulse of the whole new-electro project, but it's as if someone's put on a pink headband and switched on the lights, letting loose the playful groove and pastel-colored electric funk too many people have carefully expunged from their 80s memories. And then starts something possibly better. ""Deceptacon"" slides seamlessly into Soft Cell's magnificent ""...So"", where synth piano and chimes keep up the disco, even as the gauzy swells draw you deeper into dark. By the time Codec & Flexor's ""Time Has Changed"" comes around, the depths have found their soul: the whirring tech beat continues, but the synth pulse drops away to an airy hum and a set of rich, earnest vocals, a ballad with its trenchcoat collar turned suavely up. Two tracks later comes a surprise to beat that first saxophone: Red Zone's remix of Stevie V.'s ""Dirty Cash"", wherein a vocal hook (that always sat in Soul II Soul's shadow) bursts through like its explicit aim was always to make Germanic electro monotony look weak. The cuts here slip darker and throb more relentlessly, but they still find way more of the ""disco"" in Italo-disco. So begins the end, wherein Tiga skirts close around the old electro mode and brings us to another remix highlight, this time the fabulous electric pop of Martini Bros., as handled by Black Strobe. ""The Biggest Fan""-- like the pop-ready chug of TokTok vs. Soffy O-- is a soft, sunny speeder that could theoretically command a radio like the days of old. From there it's a quick slide into another one of those Tiga covers that seems to be saying more than it should possibly be able to-- this time a New Romanticized remaking of Felix da Housecat's genre-defining ""Madame Hollywood"", Miss Kittin's provocative chant replaced with Tiga himself, crooning like a world-weary Simon LeBon. There's a second metaphor here. Perched up on these two singles-- ""The Biggest Fan"" with its happy ode to narcissism, and ""Mister Hollywood"" with its newly-soulful pop stride-- the whole project seems to have been reframed: suddenly it's become more human, more pop, more relaxed, and a dozen times more fun. Half of the excitement right now-- as people start wandering away from the main stage of the 2001 electro sound-- lies in watching all of the different directions they wander. The corner Tiga's returned to is terrific; what's even better is the vague sense that he could just as easily choose to wander elsewhere, and wind up making you change your mind about the whole thing all over again.","There's a metaphor hidden in the picture of Tiga on the cover of this mix.

Whatever memo found its way into Cypress Hill DJ Muggs' drug drawer must surely deserve the blame for Dust, a technically competent but lacking attempt to expand the producer's repertoire beyond the dusty, wet-smoking rhythmic foundations he laid down on early Cypress albums, using the nu-metal crossover of their 2000 disc, Skull and Bones, as the point of disembarking. You won't hear anything that draws from the gloomy barrio beats of Temples of Doom or Black Sunday, and the dearth of MCs guarantees no lyrical meditations to rival ""How Could I Just Kill a Man""; even ""Dr. Greenthumb"" rises above. With the exception of Everlast, who contributes his Kentucky moonshiner exhalations to the boring, heart-broken sob-story ""Gone for Good"", the majority of the vocal contributions here are made by female singers, chanteuses who at all times strain to approximate the performances of trip-hop notables like Beth Gibbons, Björk, Tracey Thorn, and anyone else who sounds impressively sultry, strung out and seductive. That seems to be the order of the day for Muggs; the cranky wall-of-noise ""Dead Flowers"", the blatant ""Angel"" ripoff ""I Know"", and ""Tears"" are as contrived and forgettable as their titles suggest, and equally interchangeable. Juxtapose, Muggs' loose collaboration with Tricky, seems to have rubbed off and drifted to the surface, but Muggs can't quite pin it down. So instead, it flies all over the room, shitting everywhere and squawking rabidly, and we're left with some weak Britpop hybrids (with the embarrassingly saccharine ""Rain"" at the top of the list) and some token snippets of studio tomfoolery, ranging from the almost-clever Laswell IDM of ""Shadows"" to the, um, almost-clever ambient music of ""Niente"". I pity the fool who has to clean this up. It's an unrefined, poorly calculated mess. I know everything reads to the contrary, but I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. Really. You can't fuck with the aforementioned Cypress records; shit, even the Muggs-produced ""Babalu Bad Boy"" rocked the house harder than anything on Dust ten years prior. Would it help to know that on the CD I'm looking at, it boasts: ""A down-tempo rock masterpiece by Cypress Hill's legendary producer""? No, I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. I'm doubting the quality of a song like ""Morta"", with its jack-in-the-box flamenco bombast struggling to impersonate Björk's ""I Play Dead"", which isn't that good to begin with anyway. I'm questioning any excuse you can think of for the trite, nasally ""Faded"": ""We are, we are, we are, we are always faded/ You are, you are, you are the one in my pages...""?

Googler,Parlour,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffc13d197565213828c/1:1/w_160/9364cafe.jpg,2003-03-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6177-googler/,Temporary Residence,"You know, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the wackiness of the pun in this album's title and artwork. For those of you new to this whole ""Internet"" thing, a googler is a desk jockey who's become so adept at finding idiosyncratic (and sometimes even relevant) things on the Net's finest search engine that they actually warrant a title. In a broader sense, I suppose we're all Googlers when we use the search engine, but the term is best applied to the true masters-- and arguably, a sort of backhanded compliment. Googler is the second album from the Louisville, Kentucky-based Parlour, headed up by Tim Furnish (Crain, Cerebellum, Aerial M). I suppose the fact that there's an album titled after this Information Age piece of verbiage means the term is here to stay, at least until the site it got its name from is superceded by something better. But what to make of the cover art? In case you're straining into the GIF at the top of the page, that's a big cloud of googly eyes on a yellow background adorning the cover. The CD itself is decorated with a massive googly eye, and they dominate all of the other artwork as well. I can only imagine the possibilities for a vinyl release-- you know those things would be real, functioning googly eyes if this were an LP. Bottom line: what a fucking terrible pun. Parlour's quota for humor (or perhaps humour) seems to be filled by album titles and artwork, though, as this and their debut, Octopus Off Broadway, attest. That record was bursting with texture, but completely undernourished melodically, and as such, was pleasant but not very fulfilling. This new album signals a different sound and direction for the band, rearranging all the elements, and entirely for the better. They still couldn't find a melody if they were living next door to it, but the textures that were so obviously their forte on the debut are infinitely more engrossing and varied here. What's odd about this is that these songs were all recorded over a period of several years beginning in 1997-- the same period of recording that yielded Octopus Off Broadway-- indicating that the band was more fully formed in their early days than that record let on. Googler sounds like a genuine progression, but if it's actually concurrent with their other material, it makes you wonder where this band might be headed-- an open question for the moment, it seems. Things get off to a somewhat familiar start with ""Jololinine"", which nods to previous Parlour material with its slow build and heavy layering of buzzing organs, electronic programming and clean guitars, but all bets are off when ""Distractor"" kicks in with its twitchy drums and splattered, dissonant guitar chords. The shifts in tension, weird rubbery breakdown and action/reaction structure are more than enough to make up for the lack of melodic focus, and the song stands as the best thing Parlour have put their name on yet. ""Over the Under"" is almost as good, riding a groove built to last and building slowly to a wah-soaked climax that toes a strange line between math and funk. ""Regulkfro Reel"" acts as a turning point for the album, transforming at its midpoint from a wildly askew stack of riffs and drums to a series of ambient washes that pulse like Stars of the Lid. The band places little quasi-melodic keyboard flourishes in the glow on an almost subliminal level, setting you up for the echoing chamber of keys and rounded-off sounds that comprises ""Hop Pife"". ""Hop Pife"" conjures a space filled with fluid, like a womb, but not quite as warm or safe, as strange quarter-tone synths enter like slow motion sirens near the halfway point. ""Svrendikditement"" closes things out with a foot on the post-rock and another wandering the world of static-fringed glitch, building on a basic, programmed tribal rhythm and some marimba-ish timbres, and winding up with a crunchy, noise-tainted concoction brimming with brain-grabbing sounds. Strange, then, that this was recorded at the same time as Parlour's debut-- because it sounds nothing like the other record, instead coming across as a leap and a bound forward toward something entirely more interesting and bracing. Parlour still aren't grabbing me with melody the way I want them to, but maybe that's just not the point for them. And anyway, with Googler, they've proven that they can be genuinely engaging without much assistance from melody, which is impressive enough in itself.","You know, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the wackiness of the pun in this album's ...

Holopaw,Holopaw,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c10b13d197565213bb32/1:1/w_160/1b1cb675.jpg,2003-03-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3908-holopaw/,Sub Pop,"In this age of file-sharing and do-it-yourself promos, the sovereign power of cover art has been greatly reduced. Having already suffered the indignity of being shrunken from glorious gatefold vinyl to pocket-sized jewel case, cover art now faces complete extinction by blank-disc proliferation, no longer holding the suggestive power of artfully assembled graphic design. Increasingly taking its place is a sort of creative inverse of the former relationship, whereby the music leads the listener to project his/her own imagined cover art-- what squiggly doodle will accompany this new lo-fi indie-pop release, what moody black-and-white photograph might adorn this shoegazer LP, and so forth. Playing this game, the first minute of Holopaw's self-titled debut almost immediately conjured up images of wood paneling, being my default alt-country image response. When I finally got my criminal hands on a legit copy of Holopaw, the wood-paneling spine was third-bear just right, soothing confirmation of my subconscious meteorology. But don't be fooled by the standard old-timey exterior, nor by the seemingly straightforward indie-folk surface of the songs. That bold 8+ rating up yonder would not be an acceptable endorsement were the five gentlemen of Holopaw as predictable as their album art; rather, their specialty is in the skilled peppering of their Tupelo-derived sound with modern and unusual peculiarities. Take that wood-paneling-suggestive opening track, ""Abraham Lincoln"", which starts off like Country Song #4623 from shaggy-hairs armed with resale western-style button-downs and a copy of Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Featuring little more than Ugly Casanova collaborator and Holopaw frontman John Orth's porch-strummed acoustic and light-twang vocals, the disc prematurely convinces that Holopaw aspire to little more than a capsule review towards the back of No Depression. But by the time the track reaches its fully fleshed end, the party's been crashed by jarring synthesizer chirps and a hissy, quiet drum machine loop, Nigel Godrich producing Woody Guthrie in a time machine phonebooth. [We briefly interrupt this review for the obligatory timely war reference. I'm compelled to mention that the lyric ""pale green light/ Vibrates across the Abraham Lincoln"" is now forever tied into footage of planes taking off from the USS Abraham Lincoln nautical metropolis, which using the beloved ""night-vision"" lens, takes on a, yep, pale green cast. Goddamn this infernal war seeping into the peaceful sanctity of rock crit!] The rest of Holopaw's almost-too-brief ten tracks are similarly deceptive, roots-rock at heart but with a tendency to take sudden turns of arrangement and instrumentation. Godspell-quotin' ""Igloo Glass"", fr'instance, has the quick-stepping pace and mandolin plucks of classic bluegrass, evoking, as such rhythms often do, images of steam engines and overalls. Any tired O Brother references are made moot, however, by a brush-trapped drum beat that's repeatedly faded in and out of the mix, and bounced between channels by whip-smart producer Brian Deck. With Southern music trapped too often within strict constructs of genre definition and Golden Age fetishism, Holopaw defiantly eschew Ludditism to great effect. ""Hoover"" and ""Cinders"" each ride on a warm Rhodes buzz, the latter adding a jalopy horn section full of dissonant clash; the impeccably structured and moving ""Teacup Woozy"" benefits from a low keyboard rumble beneath its classic folktale of travel and woe. And yet no song is so weighted down with studio trickery that the band loses its Everglades identity, anchored as they are by Orth's unfaked swamp warble and lyrical lyrics (tellingly organized as prose in the liners). By now you're probably just begging for a comparison to those other recent country-educated embracers of technology, Wilco, and public servant that I am, I'll oblige. If Yankee Hotel Foxtrot becomes the figurehead of a genre offshoot, Holopaw would certainly make the appropriate Tower Records listening booth, Americonica that it is. But Holopaw most embodies the rather exciting state of roots-rock/alt-country/bumpkin indie, which has finally gotten over the fear of ruining ""authenticity"" by using modern tools. Holopaw's cover art and Depression-era script logo might be indie-folk standard issue, but the music contained within is a refreshing, effective new use of the boundaries: a wood-paneled Powerbook.","In this age of file-sharing and do-it-yourself promos, the sovereign power of cover art has been greatly reduced.

A Gift from a Garden to a Flower: A Tribute to Donovan,Donovan,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9fbeb335119a49ec90e/1:1/w_160/3500b5ce.gif,2003-03-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2424-a-gift-from-a-garden-to-a-flower-a-tribute-to-donovan/,Darla,"The cognoscenti of rock, looking to dignify the object of their study and affection, has largely seen fit to revise the psychedelic era into something less embarrassing than it actually was. If it weren't for things like the Woodstock documentary, young pups only now becoming acquainted with the period might be led to believe that hippies actually had some substance to them rather than simply having substances in them. One of the most ruthlessly expunged figures from the time was one Donovan Leitch, that poor, trusting sap who bought into all the promises flying around the mid-to-late-60s with myopic conviction. Through his music, he spread the gospel to blissed-out followers only to find that he had chained himself to a sinking social and musical movement. When he went down with the ship, more than a few music-lovers were happy enough to be spared the reminder of what they formerly thought were the easy answers to life's most difficult questions. If he can be forgiven for his naivete (and he can), then Donovan deserves a much kinder evaluation than he usually gets. The sunny folks at Darla Records seem to have thought so, too, and rather than simply carping about it, they went out and assembled a tribute record to a man few would seem brave enough to publicly salute. A total of eighteen groups queue up on A Gift from a Garden to a Flower, drawing out the elements that made Donovan so enjoyable, as well as some of the ones that made him silly. As Bob Dylan can tell you, it's easy to poke fun at Donovan-- so much so that many of the artists on Gift do it while attempting to do the exact opposite. The torch of Donovan's excessive seriousness is regrettably carried on by The Blood Group and Pale Horse and Rider, smudging ""Colours"" and ""There Is an Ocean"", respectively. Self-indulgence is also on display, with track after track showing to varying degrees the crimes against good taste so easily committed by the chemically impaired. Worst of all are the ones whose self-consciousness leads them to douse their entries with heaps of irony. Ciao Bella's murder of ""Mellow Yellow"" is absolutely egregious-- if they were so uncomfortable affirming Donovan's talents, perhaps they should have sat this one out. The ease with which Donovan can be transmogrified into a walking joke tends to overshadow the fact that he was an able songwriter, and that, with the aid of producer Mickie Most, he was able to contribute some delightful moments to the rock canon. Though no one takes a shot at his only #1, the Jimmy Page-enhanced ""Sunshine Superman"", there are enough other highlights to make up for it. Rising stars Pas/Cal pitch in with ""Oh Gosh"", Lenola trips out ""Atlantis"" to the breaking point, and the estimable My Morning Jacket gives ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" a fun technological dressing-up that respects the spirit of the original. But the jewel of the bunch, surprisingly, is Watoo Watoo's run-through of ""Jennifer Juniper"", a brilliant recasting of baroque pop as skittering, low-key electronica. They and the other standout performers prove that Donovan's unapologetic optimism sewed seeds that far outlived his epoch, and in the process, show that that's not such a bad thing after all.","The cognoscenti of rock, looking to dignify the object of their study and affection, has largely seen fit to revise ...

Mani,Dorine Muraille,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c411eb335119a49ed86f/1:1/w_160/aac94a98.jpg,2003-03-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5507-mani/,Fat Cat,"Most people believe that humans are the only intelligent beings on the planet, and language is the peg they usually hang this uniqueness on. Language holds us together: the ability to communicate with abstract symbols is universal among cultures and innate to all individuals exposed to it. And language has set us apart, leading to all the advances-- agriculture, industry, social organization-- that have allowed us to dominate other vertebrates, including other humans. It's clear what language is good for, if not exactly how it works. If you think about it, music is just as universal and unique. But is it adaptive? Darwin thought it was an elaborate mating call. Others have claimed it's more like ritual cement, good for aligning people with each other. Of course, it might just be a way to let our auditory minds blow off a little steam from the usual verbal grind. And then there's evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, who has suggested that music is ""cultural cheesecake,"" serving no adaptive function at all. Music may not be adaptive, but music does adapt, so maybe we should be asking about the evolution of music itself, about the way we play host to a variety of competing sound memes. Which is all to say: Ask not what you require of the music; but what the music requires of you. That's the right attitude to have when you enter Mani, the debut release from Dorine Muraille. Having previously recorded an artefact under the name Gel, French composer Julien Locquet is no stranger to what some are calling laptop-folk. The sounds he brings to Mani are from demure and folky sources-- a muted piano, a children's song, a ukulele-- but they're so finely chopped up and swirled around that the project comes off as a series of thought experiments in fluid dynamics. It might help to cling to the voice of poetess Chloe Delaume, whose abstract work is featured prominently. But better would be to let the debris wash right through you as it gets ripped up, scattered, drenched, fed into itself, rinsed, squeezed, and sometimes laid out to dry. The anti-authoritarian bathroom scrawl on the back of the album may have been trying to warn me. But Mani doesn't want me to keep approaching music the way I know how, as hooks and verses, loops and layers, or even beginnings, middles and ends. Rather, I think part of Mani wants me to be a machine, and part of it wants me to be an animal. Let me explain. The opening track, ""Le Supplice de la Bagnoire"", is wildly soothing given how little there is to latch onto. A needle drag, a simple piano figure, some vinyl dust, snatches of guitar and female voice-- that's it, and the rest is just these moments blowing around in the white-tiled vacuum of an antique restroom, then getting worked into your scalp like a therapeutic shampoo. The expressive result is somewhere between a lullaby and an emergency eyewash. It's stunning, in an inhuman way. Then ""Bbraallen"" starts up with a chaotic ukulele and a real live beat, but soon degenerates into an awkward freeform accompaniment to some god-awful field recording of the tired old ballad ""Barbara Allen"". If the title is an indication that Muraille is trying to bring out a minimal doubleness in this song, then surely he has failed. The next track butchers a French nursery rhyme in much the same way. But then a track uses song in just the right way, letting it get swallowed up in a grainy storm of tactus-jamming ticks and blaring digital clip, having an expressive effect somewhere between raw predation and hard-drive failure. The gentle piano improvisations that fill out the back end of the album are interrupted by something that sounds like a cross between a campfire and a water filtration plant. And then a vibraphone trio warms up, only to be drenched in sweet acid rain through an open roof. If music were like most other forms of animal behavior, it would have to have come about gradually as the result of a series of adaptations. But is it possible that the capacity for music, like language, is a result of the lucky misuse of hardware evolved for other purposes? And if so, do we now have other latent capacities just waiting to be misused in precisely the right ways? If enough people listen to stuff like Mani, we may soon find out.","Most people believe that humans are the only intelligent beings on the planet, and language is the peg they usually ...

Trouser Jazz,Mr. Scruff,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f269fc7814a47cd782/1:1/w_160/904f7a19.jpg,2003-03-23 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5477-trouser-jazz/,Ninja Tune,"Trouser Jazz is quite possibly the answer to all of your sugar-fueled Saturday morning disco prayers, churning out one chocolate-frosted cereal box prize after another and bringing down the house with an inspired mix of rubbery funk, hipster soul and gleefully contorted, krush groovin' hip-hop. Mr. Scruff's inner pre-school party animal is in full effect, flexing a little four-on-the-floor muscle, and while this album may not be a huge leap from his debut LP, Keep It Unreal (his love of rusty samples and chunky, plastic drums still dominates), he's managed to take his distinct sound in a few new directions. More than a few props are in order for some other members of the Ninja Tune clan, whose influences are clear on many of the tracks: the third-world swing of Up, Bustle and Out is borrowed for the chaingang saxophone boogie of ""Shelf Wobbler"", as well as the Snorks-in-a-keyboard-shop lounge of ""Shrimp"", and recent vocal-heavy singles from Cinematic Orchestra and The Herbaliser appear to be the impetus for ""Beyond"", ""Valley of the Sausages"" and ""Come Alive"", featuring singers Seaming and Niko, respectively. ""Come Alive"" is enhanced by Niko's warm, breezy delivery, a wah-wah bassline made of Jell-O and ragged string samples transformed into sultry speak-easy jazz by her voice, but Seaming's cuts are two of the few missteps on the record: a fairly ambiguous Curtis Mayfield potboiler, ""Beyond"" lacks the inventiveness of Trouser Jazz's more memorable moments, and ""Valley of the Sausages"" runs in circles around its sweaty Cuban percussion. With a label as tight-knit as Ninja Tune, this kind of cross-pollination is inevitable. Scruff is able to take these borrowed elements and make them function in his own ramshackle funhouse. Their spirit is especially evident in the rhythm section, which remains rambunctious and spirited for the whole of the album. Too often, though, fun means frivolousness, an excuse for simplicity and sloppiness that, while rarely detracting seriously from the proceedings, leaves the album without any semblance of ingenuity or progression. For Mr. Scruff, playtime is serious shit. One listen to the fingerpaint jitterbug ""Come On Grandad"", which revolves around soapy synth bursts and a funky bandleader egging things on, is enough to send anyone running out to the playground. ""Ug"", previously released on Ninja Tune's Xen Cuts box set, and as a B-side to the Volkswagen-approved ""Get a Move On"", is above all else a giant teddy bear of a track, a toy box of basic, blocky bits and pieces that fuse into a towering wad of crunk'd up scrap metal; the subcutaneous bellow of the bassline, the Flat Eric keyboard squawks and slithering hi-hat snaps propel ""Ug"" to the top of the heap. Scruff even works a little two-step flava into ""Giffin"", turning a fairly sedate, atmospheric instrumental into a smooth operator with a bit of a pulse. And while it's not nearly as ideal a collaboration as ""Jus Jus"" (a two-minute head-bobber featuring Roots Manuva on the mic), the Neptunes-in-daycare b-boy swagger of ""Vibrate"" satisfies, laced with highly contagious call-and-response couplets and the relaxed ramblings of Leeds-based MC Braintax, yet another British lyricist who is in actuality much more talented than that bony pipsqueak in The Streets. The hip-hop element is fully exposed on ""Vibrate"", but it's the rhythmic foundation of the majority of Trouser Jazz-- coupled at various times with an assortment of roots music, from back-alley soul to Technicolor funk, equal parts Funki Porcini and Fat Albert-- that makes it an entertaining listen. Scruff keeps things sticky and sweet, passing out peanut-butter-and-fluff sandwiches and chocolate milk by the trunk-full, keeping things on a positive tip. Trouser Jazz is music for picnics and campouts: sly and soulful, and not at all concerned with the Monday to come.","Trouser Jazz is quite possibly the answer to all of your sugar-fueled Saturday morning disco prayers, churning out one chocolate-frosted ...

Tsu Gi Ne Pu,Asa-Chang & Junray,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a113b1335d7bf169817c/1:1/w_160/2f9366f7.jpg,2003-03-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/306-tsu-gi-ne-pu/,Leaf,"Ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni. This mantra, counting to twelve in Japanese, begins to resemble the cyclic routine of someone suffering from OCD after awhile. It's actually very easy to say, and even if it sounds like gibberish to other people, all the better to spin your own mental wheels. Repeat it and start over, and try to see how many times you can do this without missing a number or making a mistake. If you do, start over again. Try to do all of this in a steady rhythm, and with a couple of friends, make a chorus of counting. Then, try to start at the same time but all in different tempos-- keep your own rhythm while the others go off on their own, and then all meet up again on ""ichi."" If you mess up, start over again. And again. Then, once more. In music, the only culture I know of that employs such complex counting exercises in their traditional music is from India. Philip Glass spoke of studying Indian music before creating his equally mathematical minimalist pieces of the early 70s. Terry Riley also studied Indian classical music, as did La Monte Young. These composers are united by an interest in the disciplined refinement of Indian music, and all applied it to their own idiosyncratic music. Likewise, Asa-Chang & Junray reference Indian music in the process of creating music that is otherwise quite unique. In their case, the idea of rhythm and meter, and the extended development of beat exercises disguised as melodies, seems related to Indian raga. On ""Xylophone"", they even bring in sitars to compliment the already dominant tabla and bongo. The mini-album Tsu Gi Ne Pu (named for an old Japanese poem) is the fourth release by this duo, and even more than last year's compilation Jun Ray Song Chang, emphasizes how rhythm dominates their music. This almost maddening focus on rhythm dominates every tune on the record, even when, on the surface, it appears that they took a simpler, more song-oriented approach. On ""Kaikyo"", trumpet and trombone played with subtle apprehension perform a tune that reminds me of the closing credits to a an old Spaghetti Western. However, the actual melody is less brassy fanfare than merely the vocalization of what would otherwise be a drum part, right down to the accented, triplet figures and unison doubling of Asa-Chang's percussion. As it unfolds, the duo plays more aggressively, picks up some speed, and builds upon the simple figures they began with, until they arrive at a one-note endgame. They've gone through every conceivable combination of beats, and end the tune on a sampled crashing of waves. The song is the perfect depiction of obsessive mathematical development (or feverish logic), and will probably annoy as many people as it entertains. ""Kutsu #3"" begins innocently enough with a trumpet and accordion duet, neither of which are playing in any particular rhythm. After their short statement, and a few rising sine tones carried over from the previous album, everything disappears. For better than 10 minutes, there are no sounds at all, until a female narrator begins the countdown reference the opened this review. She counts to twelve, each number representing one note in a chromatic scale, and Asa-Chang and U-Zhaan join in. The never sing the same numbers at the same time, except when meeting up on the first one, instead each enunciating a different pattern with clockwork perfection. For anyone into polyrhythmic fugue, this will doubtlessly be fascinating-- though like most of Asa-Chang and Junray's music, it could have an equally maddening effect on others. I'm a little confused as to why the band needed to put that extended moment of silence in there (especially as it takes up about a fourth of the already brief album's run-time), but if a little goes a long way, these two are masters of exotic minimalism. It's going to be interesting to see where they go next; Tsu Gi Ne Pu gives me the feeling it might very well be into uncharted (and impenetrable) rhythmic waters. Like Glass and Riley, they've managed to strike a balance between the obsessive and the charming, and it's still a pretty interesting, if occasionally detached sound.","Ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach, kyu, ju, ju-ich, ju-ni, ichi, ni, san, yon, go, rok, nana, hach ...

It's like they were going up against New York's haute couture music trends, but went with the pocket tee: sturdy, comfortable and not too striking. Those of you who look to the competitive Brooklyn Diaspora for the most exciting, battle-tested new rock may not be floored, but the Holy Ghost are a solid guitar band that at least knows how to write a song and sing it like lives are at stake. On Color Sympathy, the second of two albums they cut last year, the Holy Ghost combine a mutt-like mix of influences. Their style is consistent enough not to be showy, but broad enough to explain how they could win support slots with everyone from the Dismemberment Plan to the Damned; if you had to sum them up in a couple words, I'd go with ""heartfelt"" and ""ponderous"". From the first cut they deploy barreling guitars and hyper-earnest vocals, lurching on the title track between big crests and deeply-felt ruts. That song and the closer-- the dragged-out ""Pinocchio's Nose""-- heavily bookend the album, as the rest of the album moves from ballads to rockers without ever shaking off that leaden intent. Some of the blame lies with Christopher Dean Heine. A forceful singer, he wails with overwrought machismo, but he can't overcome the fact that if everything sounds important, nothing actually is. ""Sunday's Calling"" would be a Spoon-worthy rock 'n' roll song if Heine didn't sing it like he was working on a difficult bowel movement. Not afraid of dishing out wordy imagery, he gets off some sharp lyrics-- the alliterative ""like a libertine from Lawrence, Kansas,"" or the seductive come-on, ""your mother looks like Sharon Tate""-- but he drops into pomposity, proclaiming the ""Berlin Wall was destroyed by rock and roll."" He gets his rock on for the Walkmen-like ""Snow White"", which kicks off with only drums backing his voice-- finally raspy, and spitting authority-- and at last ponies up some real excitement. The rest of the band mostly stays where they're put-- the throwaway instrumental ""Toledo"", for example, makes them sound solid if not extraordinary; to their credit the Holy Ghost are very tight, and probably great in concert. The ballads become rumbling and atmospheric thanks to guitarist Alec Ferrell, who has a mighty, wide sound with just a little shimmer; when it's time to get loud, he lays on a gritty, distorted tone that'll wake up the back rows. ""Berlin Wall"" sounds eerily close to late-period XTC: the band's real strength is never writing a song that runs too fast or skimps on tunes. With just eight songs run through in under half an hour, Color Sympathy has the over-before-it-really-starts feel of an EP. It's well-balanced, well-rounded and well-played; it's confident, and it's not too trendy. But it also feels like the work of a strong opening act for a more accomplished headliner-- too often it's emotional without nuance, loud without pizzazz, catchy, but not grabbing. Color Sympathy is good enough to get them big shows, but the Holy Ghost need to push things farther to earn a cushy time slot.","This could be the only band out of Brooklyn, NY that doesn't play no-wave, electroclash or garage rock.

Perhaps his death spared him unimaginable suffering. While he was alive, Jones felt an intense anger at Israel and the United States, and sympathy for the plight of the Arab world generally and Palestinians specifically (he wasn't exactly opposed to terrorism either). Jones' stance was not borne of experience (he never actually visited the Middle East), religion (he was not a Muslim) or community (he didn't know or care what the Islamic world thought of his work). He was simply outraged at the existence of the state of Israel and the West's imperialist policies. Because Jones was a workaholic, his anger found an outlet in recording, and he was pissed off, indeed: The discography page of his official website lists more than 150 releases since 1982. I didn't look closely to see how many of those are albums proper, but it's a lot. If he were alive today, with everything that's happening, he'd probably be putting out a new album every two hours. The pace would kill him. Because Muslimgauze was so prolific, new records still appear almost monthly, three years after his death. It's difficult to imagine that one day there simply won't be any more Muslimgauze material in the vaults. Maybe it won't happen in my lifetime. But for now, the new releases keep on coming, and relatively casual fans such as myself can sit back and cherry-pick the good stuff. Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip contains material Jones recorded in 1998, which wasn't originally released until last year and has now been repressed in a limited edition. No one expects one Muslimgauze release to sound dramatically different from another-- at his pace, he was bound to repeat himself. Rather, Jones' tracks are built from variations of about a dozen distinct and identifiable Muslimgauze styles. This record can be classified as mostly stripped-down Muslimgauze: generally easy on the noise, with steady, hip-hop-informed beats, and no dub touches or ambient interludes. It also has a lot of what made Muslimgauze interesting. Jones' greatest accomplishment, musically, was his genius with percussion. The sheer power and authority of his drum tracks never fails to impress, and so it is with Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip . Nobody ever has or will mix a midtempo hip-hop beat with distorted djembe fills like Muslimgauze does here on ""Hezbollah Radio Advert"". You can tell it's him instantly, with the unnerving blend of the clean (the driving 4/4 bit) and the filthy (the seriously overdriven hand drums). Bits of Arabic dialog, another Muslimgauze signature, buzz randomly over the rhythm. The title track uses a similar combination of sounds, but with loose, improvisational hand percussion and sweeping string samples that sound like they could be ripped from ""Kashmir"". ""Izlamiq Groupe"" on the other hand, is slow and druggy, with deep tabla pulses, samples of sitar, and an odd contrast as a pitter-patter of electric shocks dancing on top. These are all prime Muslimgauze tracks. The record gets more abrasive as it goes on. ""Rent a Hookah"" is hard, noisy techno with just a few Middle Eastern elements, and the drums in ""Balti Utensil"", though not particularly fast, inch into the red. Still, Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip is not a particularly punishing Muslimgauze release, so it wouldn't be a bad place to start for the uninitiated. He surely made 50 albums better than this one, and 100 or more worse. The important thing is to dive in somewhere and check it out. No one sounds like Muslimgauze.","That Bryn Jones (aka Muslimgauze) died in 1999 of a rare blood disease is a convincing argument for the existence ...

Infinite Keys,Ester Drang,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcaceb335119a49eccf8/1:1/w_160/086384db.jpg,2003-03-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2839-infinite-keys/,Jade Tree,"I imagine there are big ol' skies in Oklahoma. Though I've never been there, I associate the labor-conquers-all state with ridiculously wide expanses of blue that at times seem oppressive in their beauty. I can only assume these atmospheric conditions, though: I've not been to Oklahoma, only its neighbor Kansas, and that state is endless from one side to the other. I was on one road during my entire drive through the state, but as I looked left and right I wasn't sure if I should laugh or let myself fall apart at the site of so much repetition made real. So in the spirit of full disclosure, you should know now that I wrote this review with a sleeveless promotional CD and had no idea that the cover art for Infinite Keys is in fact a photograph of a blue sky over a green field. I only saw that afterward. And though it does make me want to trust my instincts-- maybe go into graphic design as a second career?-- it had no bearing on the review as written. Onward: Ester Drang are a five-piece from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and seem to be writing music based on cloud formations. I imagine them waiting patiently for a patch of white to explode, for a break in the otherwise steady weather, allowing them a chance to experiment with dynamics in response. Since 1995 they've put out a single, a now out-of-print EP, and last-year's somewhat lauded LP Goldenwest on Burnt Toast. With each release they've been charting a pretty straight path toward Infinite Keys, their first full-length for Jade Tree. And here, in the present, the preordained Ester-Drang cosmology doesn't shake much. From the first to the final fade, the music is a whisper. Each piece washes in dusty sheets, as though the band is literally assigning particular notes and durations to patterns in the sky. If that were the case, it could end up as a form of environmental music like the work of Chicago sound artist Collin Olan who, for example, inserted two contact microphones into a block of ice, submerged the block in water, and recorded the sounds it made as it melted. I like that-- I like theory-- but I can't invent intentions for Ester Drang and, ultimately, they don't seem to have such lofty or eccentric goals. I think, really, they really just kind of dig Radiohead. Or a section Radiohead as re-interpreated by The Gloria Record. Here and there, I've read comparisons to The Flaming Lips, and I don't get it. Though they share the same home state, and in the past collaborated with Steven Drozd on a single, the folks pushing Ester Drang as participants in some kind of Oklahoma-grown sound are stretching things to fill an easily processed critical canvas. ""One Hundred Times"" is where they're most openly taking from Radiohead; it's also when the stock elements of their wistfulness gel temporarily. The vocal lines cascade and plummet, little bleeps and buzzes make sense in relation to the overall density of the music, and, more importantly, there are enough pauses, build-ups, sputters, and redirections to make you feel like you're flying somewhere, leaping over your mundane town in a single bound. ""Oceans of You"" is the indie-rock version of Coldplay, shouting gracefully about ""problems"" fading. Incandescent shit-- I can imagine them performing this with an orchestra at the Grammys: lights flicker, the orchestra blows a fuse (some dude passes out in row one!), and as I watch from my living room floor I wonder if I'm supposed to feel something. The music is pretty-- it's difficult to deny that-- but so are the sounds of cars driving by your house at 4AM, or how the world muffles a bit when you put your ear up to a puddle. When your music is light and airy, you need to make sure it's compelling. While Radiohead are often bogged down by over-ambitious themes, they're at least constructing a poetics of experimentation, as well as a cogent if somewhat scattered message beyond their plush walls of sound. All I can cull from this music are empty exercises in pseudo-orchetral ear candy. Which is fine to a point: Sigur Ros (an easy comparison) move people to tears without the majority of their audience comprehending a single word of their lyrics, and like Ester Drang, they aren't exactly breaking new ground. Unlike Ester Drang, their stuff is a gale of goddamn triumph; Infinite Keys rumbles by like a draft through a cracked window, a tiny shift in the atmosphere, leaving only the vaguest of impressions.","I imagine there are big ol' skies in Oklahoma.

It's All Happening Now,Lewis Parker,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff4c0084474cd0bfa4a/1:1/w_160/7c70d2d4.gif,2003-03-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6170-its-all-happening-now/,Melankolic,"This is a bad week for Tony Blair. With his continuing commitment to a war only a third of his citizens support, Blair's political future, and even his job, has been called into question. Whether he started out as a UN-minded liberal or a militant interventionist, his credibility from here is in serious disrepair. As poodle in the lap of a unilateral and pre-emptive Texan, he must have some doubts about which side of ""with us or against us"" he really wanted to be on. And if they're pumping music into the doghouse, you can bet he's rocking himself to sleep to the freeform aural assaults of Lewis Parker. It seems like hip-hop is not yet as thoroughly market-driven and overexposed in Britain as it has been in the U.S. for quite some time, so there aren't many alternatives to doing it for the love over there. Lewis Parker is no exception. In 1998 he earned a lasting place in the Brit-hop pantheon with his dark, autumnal Masquerades and Silhouettes album, but then dropped off the face of the island-- silent but for a few compilation appearances and collaborations. Friendlier than a Braintax, but far more serious than The Aspects, Lewis Parker can battle with a neutral mask, but seems to draw on an undercurrent of well-considered rage. In contrast to Massive Attack, whose Melankolic label has released this new album, Parker seems to be comfortable taking the time to exact genius from himself. As one British reviewer put it, ""Although heads have run out of saliva waiting for it, there is more than enough [material] here to get them moist again."" If It's All Happening Now is any indication, Lewis has, these past five years, been chilling in his bedroom with the sequencer going and freestyling about his day. His blunt, precise sense of rhythm and natural rhymes glue together what might seem like somewhat loose themes on the lips of a less confident rapper. The minimal song structures, with just enough hook to pull themselves out of the frame for another impulsive verse, make for a sequence of tight three-minute tracks that can seem almost endless. With drop-ins by a dizzying array of pouting UK emcees, it feels like one marathon South London basement session. Guests include Apollo, Jhest and Supa T, who with Parker make up the Cloudsteppers Federation, formerly Champions of Nature. Says member Dolo: ""The story behind the Champions of Nature is that we were all in a freakshow... but we escaped after realizing that music was the only way to go forward."" Someone has since offered them jobs as knife-throwers' assistants. As relentless as the lyrics are, this album would be nothing without the straight-laced beats that drive every single track deep into its own future, like the best early Atmosphere did. Although the lack of production credits makes me nervous about leaving someone out, it's safe to say that Lewis Parker delivers the whole beats-and-rhymes package all of a piece-- there's only one sensibility at work here. On ""Mum's the Word"", Parker's homage to crate-digging, guitar octaves bloom in the grainy middle distance, like oily pastels on delivery paper. On a few tracks, unnatural brass and string crescendos push and pull at the waist of whoever's got the mike at the moment. Shit, even the thirty-second interludes leave me panting. The kicks are always electrically present, acting more like a catalyst than a foundation for the rhythmic superstructure. And then there are the snares: vine-ripened in Sicily, drugged and bludgeoned in Manchester, marinated in Marseilles, and served raw in a pool of their own expansion in the comfort of your very own head. In the words of that same wise British reviewer, ""They are lovely and crusty, there is nothing wrong with that."" After my first few listens to It's All Happening Now, I found myself ignoring the lyrics and wanting to live inside the beats. But I'm not pining for the instrumental version. Lewis Parker's lyrics are like a sandblast giving a smooth polish to the sweet jaggedness below. Or just noise on the surface of a single vivid walking meditation.","This is a bad week for Tony Blair. With his continuing commitment to a war only a third of his ...

The Grotto,Kristin Hersh,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c75e6ef959693235e0/1:1/w_160/2cd127e7.jpg,2003-03-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3843-the-grotto/,4AD,"Sometimes we music writers do wrong by Kristin Hersh: we can steal her words. The press around her last album, Sunny Border Blue, honed in on a few lines that made unusually (for her) naked admissions about troubles in her life-- her custody battle over her eldest son, or the break-up of the Throwing Muses-- wrapped up as conveniently as when John Lennon first sang, ""I don't believe in Beatles."" It's easy to write a story around these clear-cut revelations, but reading the words denies you the chance to hear her tell it herself, which is far more powerful. The Grotto doesn't even come with a lyric sheet, or anything else that could shortcut Hersh's enthralling delivery on one of the starkest albums she's ever recorded. Sunny Border Blue was solid, but it was also easy-going, with even the toughest lyrics set in tuneful pop. This time, she's changed course to release two of her most extreme discs: the startling Throwing Muses reunion, which in New England parlance is ""wicked loud,"" and its complement, this quietly blinking acoustic album. Her voice, raspy and harsh against the gently ringing acoustic guitar, makes you expect a gloomy, even maudlin disc. But that can distract from what makes it great: its ambiguity, the way she expresses herself in such strangely personal terms yet never settles on an emotional tone. She weaves domestic themes (family, love and marriage, alcohol, child-rearing) into pieces that come out so fully formed it's almost easier to take them individually than as an album. Yet as careful as they sound, they don't reach many answers. She reportedly joked to her husband, ""These songs seem to be about how I can't leave you,"" and that would be a pretty concise explanation-- but anybody who's been married knows there are hundreds of ways to stay together. Her words drop like lead weights. Take the opening statement of the captivating ""SRB"": ""Headfirst into the headboard/ I'm shatterproof."" Or the album's first song, ""Sno Cat"", which is a scattering of images and scenes from a marriage. Other songs are more impressionistic, though never as abstract as, say, the strangest stuff on Hips and Makers; her voice can rise from a rough, direct tone, to the guttural wails that trail across ""Vitamins V"", and then to a pace that's almost hypnotically introverted-- like ""Ether"", which lilts in circles at a slow, methodical pace. And that's not to say that every track is so serious, but not even the lighter ones sound casual: there's a heavy silence between these notes. While the words may be the focus, the music is tuneful and perfectly rendered. There are beautiful moments throughout the album, like the guitar bridge of ""SRB"", the twinkling piano that opens ""Vanishing Twin"", or the whistling ghost town ambience of ""Silver Sun"". Hersh has two strong accompanists, Giant Sand's Howe Gelb on piano and the inimitable violinist Andrew Bird. Gelb's playing is restrained, sometimes limited itself to a few notes at the end of a song or a quiet backing line that adds just enough sentimentality; likewise Bird, judiciously used on just a few tracks, has a perfectly yearning tone, sad without melodrama. Gelb and Bird have toured with Hersh, and even though they stay respectfully out of the spotlight you can hear their camaraderie-- on ""Arnica Montana"", a carefree tune that actually rollicks; or when they end the album together on ""Ether"", Hersh wrapping them into her stark, introverted narrative. The transitions from joy to isolation make clear how much ground Hersh has staked out here: even she may not understand all the feelings laid out in these songs. The most striking sections don't describe deep crises or dramas, but spread across day-to-day life; the outcome is neither content nor bittersweet. Instead, like most of her best work, it's stuck on the emotions she can't decipher.","Sometimes we music writers do wrong by Kristin Hersh: we can steal her words. The press around her last album ...

Chopped Zombie Fungus,Otto Von Schirach,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a972ea9e61561daa5a2e/1:1/w_160/c92b3ad7.jpg,2003-03-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8493-chopped-zombie-fungus/,Schematic,"For the aloof in the room, the story goes like this: After a devastating crash in which his ""land craft"" was totaled and both of his legs were mangled, Otto Von Schirach awoke, six months later, from a painkiller haze, disoriented and confused. The psychological effects of his trauma drastically altered his approach to music: Less melodic, more chaotic, light on the thoughtful, and heavy on the unbridled subconsciousness. The resulting series of three EPs, collected here as Chopped Zombie Fungus, are residual products of Schirach's ""accident,"" macabre and chaotic threads of intravenous beats and bed-pan bass that fold hip-hop, booty house and layer upon layer of processed noise into his hospital bedsheets, soaking them in night sweats and urine. That's the story, anyway. The plot. The reality is that life-altering tragedy has never sounded as good as it does when filtered through Schirach's delusional mind, fabricated or legit. Besides being a fine marriage of product and packaging (both the furry scrotum flipping the bird on the sleeve of the third EP, Earjuice Synthesis and the post-apocalyptic hardware warriors on Boombonic Plague, both designed by illustrator AS1, are an essential backdrop), Chopped Zombie Fungus manages to take the most predictable elements of the Schematic sound and frappe it into something tormented and way outside of the box, a sound as frightening and surreal as it is pop-lockin'. And in almost every instance, that conversion is a success. Chopped Zombie Fungus twitches its way through the dancefloor underworld, rubbing up against gyrating asses and thrusting pelvi as it searches for the Champagne Room, occasionally grabbing the mic and kicking a rancid verse. The Brian Eno-esque delivery that Schirach exhibits on ""Earjuice Synthesis (Urinate on MCs)"" becomes increasingly fresh with each listen, a strange sing-song that approximates Bodenstandig 2000 with its fractured, atonal rhythm; couplets like, ""Organized bubble bass/ Begin fisting the speaker,"" become deranged manifestos, lurking behind rumbling bass swells and breaks that writhe and twitter like dying millipedes. Nothing here could be classified as sunny, and all things are not as they seem; only David Lynch could have daydreamed ""Pelican Moondance"", a fevered hallucination in which some Sri Lankan ceremonial samba gets wrapped up with an anesthetized, ancient starlet droning ""Bessame Mucho"" until her throat bleeds, and the aggressive new wave stomp of ""Laptops&Martinis;"" is just the right mix of mutilated party anthem and breakneck cut/paste lunacy. ""Whip Me Down"" is less successful, so preoccupied with barking S&M; commands (""Whip me down/ Make me hurt/ Make me bleed/ Touch my tit"") that its promising ghetto-tech beats are allowed to wander off into oncoming traffic. But ""Boombonic Plague"" recovers the ball with the grace of a quadriplegic prostitute, cramming in enough cum-soaked booty house and disembodied demon children to rival GGG for sheer sensory perversion. No wonder it's the cut that kicked off the series. If there's a weakness to this compilation, it's not fire or decapitation or a shotgun blast to the dome, but the complete lack of restraint Schirach exhibits on many of the tracks. For sure, all three EPs are a product of frenzied, albeit revelatory, self-indulgence; but when things get out of hand, the listener gets buried alive beneath the studio noodling. The barely together ""Sliced Mucus Farts"" dries up quickly while ""Granny Foot Powder"" falters, suffering from too many aborted passages. I'll admit that it might take me years to decipher what's going on at the recess-and-Thorazine core of ""San Lorenzo"", but it seems like extraneous information, one too many B-movie sequels. Then again, more than an hour's worth of carnage takes its toll on a man. The sickness of it all leaves you stumped. As any of the undead realize, things are better ripped apart, split into pieces and gnawed at patiently. Taken in pieces, the true depths of Otto Von Schirach's scheme are better comprehended, easier to swallow and easier to flip than skip. The aim of Chopped Zombie Fungus takes time to absorb, and some cuts (like ""Facelift"") suggest eggs being laid under rotting logs, waiting. It's something for which Lucio Fulci and Gescom combined may be no match. This collection is Where the Wild Things Are; only the monsters are horny, hungry, and fighting off Atomic Zombies on the shore of Bikini Beach, amped up on pheromones in Clockwork Orange skivvies. Otto, you done did George Romero proud.","For the aloof in the room, the story goes like this: After a devastating crash in which his ""land craft ...

For Ramona,Los Halos,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5e13d197565213b516/1:1/w_160/a9ca2bf3.jpg,2003-03-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4862-for-ramona/,Loveless,"I live near what used to be the Glenview Naval Air Station in Illinois. It was shuttered in the last round of base closings, recently enough that it still appears in most atlases and maps of the area. Developers seem to have bought nearly all the land, and in just a couple of months, have constructed what must be literally thousands of houses; the only thing to suggest the land's past utility is the old airstrip control tower, which has incongruously been left standing. It looks like they're converting the building into a mall or something. This patch of land changed completely, almost overnight, from barracks and hangars to multifamily housing, strip mall shopping, and the now-ubiquitous mini-mansions that each get their own sixth of an acre to sit on. Anyone familiar with the old base wouldn't recognize it at all. Such rapid change is rare, and it's easy to be caught off-guard if you aren't expecting the change, which in this case I was. I was as struck by the dramatically altered landscape of this new Los Halos record. It's so incredibly divergent from the Lionstown, Pennsylvania band's eponymous debut that hardly sounds like the same band; the feel and the sound are both totally different this time around. Where their debut was drenched in noisy explosions of guitar and built on epic, psychedelic songcraft, there's nary an outburst to be found here, as acoustic guitars have almost completely replaced electrics. They once stepped on your foot and poked you in the eye, but For Ramona sounds at times like it's floating out of an old, wooden radio with cloth-covered tube speakers. The whole record is a hazy, languid affair bordering on folk, and oddly, the change suits Los Halos well. Led by an intriguing individual going under the pseudonym Samezvous (no word on whether he's considering changing it to make it sound less French), the contributions of the several other listed members of Los Halos are somewhat indeterminate (a quick web search reveals that one of them is named Momo Fatts, which is just too awesome for words). Samezvous kicks things off a million miles from hi-fi recording gear and drum sets, strumming old strings and singing in a tone that suggests he's got a secret to tell you. He employs this technique several times, bordering on a whisper; he's most successful on the deflated ""Losst Halo"" (sic), which sounds like Spiritualized's Jason Pierce losing his wife and his recording budget at the same time. For Ramona sports about five tracks that suggest Los Halos are on the verge of developing a sound of their own invention, and a couple of them are truly stunning. The title track is an inviting, cozy waltz brimming with melody and subtle dynamics that suggests they haven't lost their penchant for volume entirely. ""Gold As the Color"" follows up even better, opening with a repetitive, slightly processed vocal melody and unfolding, almost like a loop-based electronica track, gradually expanding with varied, repeating layers of instrumental and vocal parts, ultimately bursting forth with melodious xylophone in the song's final third. Later in the album, ""Morning of the Sun"" feels a little like American Analog Set with its buzzing organ drone, brushed drums and chorused bassline, but it's also cut through with a hook that's downright bluesy; it's weird and simultaneously wonderful. ""Dagger Bones"" takes that template to its logical pop extreme, brushing up against Sparklehorse and the glow of Fridmann-phonics in the process. If it wasn't as lo-fi, the record's closer ""Will You Go to Heaven?"" could be pretty bloated, with its ""We Are the World"" keyboards and Dream Academy chord progressions; it comes off instead as a quiet, humble anthem with an uncertain message in its ""Will you go to Heaven? And all that's wrong with you?"" refrain. So color me very surprised. I was expecting a big, militant stomp of swirling noise, and instead ended up in a quiet housing development full of cozy charm and considered craft. Such a wholesale change in sound seems like it would be difficult to pull off, but Los Halos have not had much trouble doing it. If anything, they've gotten a lot better, and I can't wait to see where they go next.","I live near what used to be the Glenview Naval Air Station in Illinois. It was shuttered in the last ...

Motel of Fools,Robert Pollard,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cb9d034d5c69bf27e1/1:1/w_160/f8946643.gif,2003-03-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6378-motel-of-fools/,Fading Captain,"If only someone could be employed to finally, once and for all, separate the lead from the gold in Robert Pollard's body of work, and simply excise the dead weight from the public consciousness. Ahh, but it's a pipe dream; there are more Bob Pollard songs than grains of sand, or stars in the sky. Who has that kind of time? Pollard certainly doesn't-- he's busy writing all these goddamn songs. Fans have been pleading for years that he use some judgment about what songs deserve to go on his records and stop releasing 18 records a year, to no avail. Simple logic says that it could spark interest in his music again, or produce his best album in years. He has clearly shown, with one or two decent tracks on each release in his Fading Captain series, that he still has it in him to write hooks as strong as those that made his mid-90s classics canonical indie releases. Until this happens, his loyal fans are left (yet again) unsatisfied, sitting despondently on the edge of the bed in the Motel of Fools, the sixth tragicomic Pollard solo release. Why is a gentle, shrinking violet like ""Captain Black"" forced to hold hands with the indulgent, incoherent slob ""Red Ink Superman""? Why is ""The Spanish Hammer"" even permitted in the same area code? Only Bob knows for sure. There are plenty of questions and precious few answers, I'm afraid, as the violent disparity in quality is perhaps more pronounced on this ""mini-LP"" than on any of his prior work (and that's really saying something). Motel of Fools is yet another face-off between songs that by rights should become insti-classics, a couple of cuts that should have gotten Pollard kicked off his own album, and a vast no-man's-land in between. In the theme of his other solo albums, Bob takes the opportunity to try his hand with slightly more unconventional (at least in comparison with his normal output) structures and effects. For the most part, these forays into sampling and tape manipulation fail spectacularly, and the two worst offenders are those mentioned above. Only three minutes of worthwhile music inhabit the cavernous 5\xBD-minute span of ""Red Ink Superman""; the remainder of the void is filled by little more than aimless, disconnected noise that has little or nothing to do with the actual song. ""The Spanish Hammer"" is to be appreciated as an experiment, maybe, but the only result that can be drawn from it is an object lesson in how easily a track can be destroyed by unchecked tape aggression. Viewed as an actual piece of music, it's virtually unlistenable. There's an outside chance I'm expecting too much from Bob, of course-- his greatest triumphs have been laid at the base of the great Tower of Song, distilled pop anthems of the highest caliber. As such, he's probably still coming to grips with the nuances of ""noise."" They might fare better in other circumstances, but charitably, they're still monstrously out of place here next to some of the most emotive, understated tunes he's ever penned. Pollard has devoted his considerable pop sensibilities to a few shy numbers, mainly forsaking fist-pumping hooks for simple, intimate ballads like ""In the House of Queen Charles Augustus"" and the painfully, beautifully morose ""Saga of the Elk"". Even as ""Harrison Adams"" nearly swells to arena-busting proportions, Pollard's powerfully self-conscious chorus of, ""You're not happy with me,"" brings it back to its emotional center. Simply put, when Pollard gives the knobs a rest on Motel of Fools, he glimpses the same interstellar heights he always does on these releases, hearkening back to the sepia-tinged glory days of vintage GBV. Unfortunately, he also reminds us why we all began questioning him in the first place.","If only someone could be employed to finally, once and for all, separate the lead from the gold in Robert ...

So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness,Joan of Arc,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba04c0084474cd0c2740/1:1/w_160/6f928446.jpg,2003-03-19 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4265-so-much-staying-alive-and-lovelessness/,Jade Tree,"Readers who would demand that a review of, say, a forty-seven minute CD by Joan of Arc regard the work as an isolated thing-in-itself: please don't beat me up in the parking lot behind the Pitchfork Mobile HQ (by the way, our boombox-shaped Aerostar will be rocking Danzaville, Montana this week, and the first fifteen people to sign up for a Pitchfork Citibank Mastercard will win coupons for pepperoni condoms from Doug's Planned Parenthood Pizza Hospice). You see, I swore I would write a decontextualized, non-self-reflective review of this mother. But three of the four Joan of Arc releases covered by Pitchfork received ratings ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 by the site's vaunted saint Brent DiCrescenzo, whose name is hurled at me in countless hateful emails, evoking Sam Kinison's old routine about the hypothetical tortured sibling of Christ who had to bear mother Mary yelling, ""Why can't you be more perfect like your brother Jesus?"" God rest his soul and arrange for seraphim to pet him with Fig Newtons, but I think the DiCrescenzo-ian resentment of the DuChamp-ian and DeBord-ian Tim Kinsella was only half-right (hence my doubling of his approximation of their worth). He accurately diagnosed Joan of Arc as a hip accouterment, a name on a poster to be hung above the porcelain piss-portals of a zillion clubgoers' sublets. But his dismissals too aggressively charge that the band is pretentious. This word gets thrown at anyone who mentions a theorist or poet or painter or Frenchman, but the word connotes pretending, and many of the people who cite theorists, poets, painters and Frenchmen aren't pretending; they're very much knowledgeable, and often passionate, about the ""names"" they're ""dropping."" Kinsella has been doing his fragile art-pud thing too long to still be considered a dilettante, though I admit that the line between ornate absurdist and fashion victim can be hard to trace. Typos in the lyric booklet further disservice his smarty-pants image. Alas: This stupidly titled album is not good enough to escape the vestigial diss, resulting in the lowest rating of my first full year of taking my CD opinions too seriously (as for the 6.1 that I regrettably gave Looper's The Snare, I was young, I needed the money, and a 24-hour clinic was conveniently across the street-- even this Joan of Arc disc is better). My mammy raised a polite pushover, and I have been fortunate to have not had to review much crap, but this album accomplishes too little with its talent pool, forcing me to spank-rate it, perhaps fallaciously, based on its potential. Tim Kinsella's last two helpings of frantic-to-lackadaisical gazebo-core, under the auspices of Owls and Friend/Enemy (color-coded on the CD spine to read ""Free in My End,"" one burl in a string of Kinsella's dodgy homoerotic/anal come-ons/blow-offs), were strong enough to recruit me as a Kinsella Apologist. I took up for the weasel, against a churning sea of discontent. But this album, and brother Mike Kinsella's recent ill-sung bucket of merely passable dirge-pop (Owen's No Good for No One Now) have persuaded me to lobby for the other side. Whereas Victor Villareal's guitar work in Owls brought the instrument the closest it's ever come to replicating water, Kinsella's plink-and-strum here is way mathier, despite how majestically the salamandrine, rapid finger-yoga sections of ""Olivia List"" impress. So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness is Owls on downers, or a Friend/Enemy that checked itself into an asylum. At some point, I stopped listening to it and began tolerating it. As gifted/studied as these musicians are, their contrapuntal arrangements and fidgety time signatures become, gasp, predictable. The steel drum on ""Madelleine Laughing"", is as adventurous as some of Friend/Enemy's (Need New Body-sponsored) scattershot pioneering, but the song is limp. The rest of the percussion is minimal and stilted, supporting the other players' experimental girth like canary legs beneath an elephant. When the band jazzes things up with the complex disco and muted coronet of ""The Infinite Blessed Yes"", they just sound like a homeless Steely Dan. Joan of Arc has abandoned the pastiche ethic of past albums to create compositions that flirt with being... songs. But that doesn't mean they go anywhere. While there has always been something inessential about Joan of Arc, this thing just languishes, ignoring the indie rock expectancy for gratifying blasts/spectacle like a cow chewing cud in a race against a combine. Many Joan of Arc songs' dark undertones suggest the ominousness of the everyday, that something about normalcy is askew, but this approach gets cloying. Which is why the strangely optimistic-sounding tracks stand out like styrofoam anchors. The aforementioned ""Olivia List"", the sprightly ""Mean to March"", and ""Mr. Participation Billy"" are the album's most interesting numbers, the latter a near-homage to Tom Waits' Coney Island carnage-barking, a catalog of urban violence replete with tragicomic falsettos straight outta Frank's Wild Years. Kinsella's previous two projects were aided by his best lyrics yet. These aren't so gripping, though he has ventured from his old Joan of Arc tack of Gertrude Stein-meets-(forgive this potentially offensive term for mangled Japanese commercial speech)-Engrish. These ""natural"" lyrics, though, suck: stream-of-consciousness, and premeditated, adlibbing, what-I-did-today spiels don't benefit from Kinsella's not screaming; the man has a guttural shriek as divine as Isaac Brock's, but you ain't getting it on this mumbly platter. Instead you encounter a speakeasy flat-croon, similar to how Will Oldham's been whispery of late, denying us his warbles and yelps. The ""poetry"" spoken at the end of the album is some of the wimpiest, wimpiest, wimpiest, unstomachably windy, emo-phillips, carbon-dated gossip-nostril, tantrum-panties, messiah-nipple, seventh-grade, goober-whittling, scruple-dink sweater-vest hobo-trigger, nut-kneading, mouth-breathing, pope-diving, womb-sniffing crap I've ever heard. The album feels lazy. This band would probably snigger at my apocalyptic melodrama, but I wish they'd create a record with the idea that it was their last, and that it had to be as awesome as they could make it. Because this product, as ""searchingly"" misanthropic and intentionally misproportioned as a Todd Solondz film, constitutes bad faith. I will spare you my Joan of Arc/Pavement analogy, about how they're both ""slack,"" love ""wordplay,"" feature bad singers who are great guitarists, and smirk like nothing is ever at stake, with Pavement's poppiness and cavalier cocksurity distinguishing them, but I will go ahead and say that So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness is a Terror Twilight, a mellow, slightly sub-decent album delivered at the wrong time. I guarantee that there will never be a point at which you will say, ""Oh shit! I've got to play [I Refuse to Type That Album Title Again]!"" The world is cray-zy, right, yet when this disc spins, I can only think of speed metal band Death Angel's singular locution, the chorus of the ""hit"" from their 1988 breakthrough Frolic Through the Park: ""I'm bored.""","Readers who would demand that a review of, say, a forty-seven minute CD by Joan of Arc regard the work ...

The Life & Times of Laddio Bolocko,Laddio Bolocko,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc67abf31b7dc7155cf1/1:1/w_160/4f79484d.gif,2003-03-19 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4626-the-life-times-of-laddio-bolocko/,No Quarter,"NYC's Laddio Bolocko were borne of the ashes of classic early 90s post-rock. Formed in 1996 by members of Dazzling Killmen, Mars Volta, Panicsville, Craw and Chalk, they began as the next logical step for hardcore bands wanting just a bit more to chew on than shards of metallic noise and haphazard speed-beat. However, where most musicians with the cumulative pedigree of this quartet would either be playing straight jazz or make a nice livings as mercenary session men, LB channeled their muso energies into a tightly wound ball of steel rods. As a group, they effortlessly converged at the service of drive and trance, occasionally jutting out unpredictably into harsher realms. Live, they were a powerhouse (perhaps drummer Blake Fleming learned a few things during his tenure with Zeni Geva), and though their recorded history is brief, it demonstrates a remarkable range of expression, precision and raw power. I've read comparisons to This Heat, Can and Albert Ayler, and while dropping names is usually a quick, cheap way to avoid describing music, in this case I think it really does pay tribute to the quality of their stuff. In short, Laddio Bolocko were fucking awesome. And now, they're gone. Sorry, you missed them. The guys are still playing (Fleming and Marcus DeGrazia in Electric Turn to Me; Drew St. Ivany and Ben Armstrong in The Psychic Paramount), but if you want to see LB now, you'll have to check out the video clip for ""As If By Remote"" on Life & Times of Laddio Bolocko. This two-disc set collects the entire recorded legacy of a band that might very well have become the premiere representatives of the noise/prog/kraut/jazz legacy as put forth by the aforementioned legends, and host of others currently receiving mega props (Flying Luttenbachers, Lightning Bolt, Ruins). The first disc of Life & Times contains 1997's Strange Warmings of Laddio Bolocko, and is the more rambunctious of the two. ""Goat Lips"" opens on a pseudo-fanfare of guitar and drums, sun-beaming riffs reaching toward the sky like a bizarro universe prog band that didn't realize they were supposed to insert a keyboard solo in the middle of all that commotion. Before things get too stagnant-- and they never do; one of LB's strengths was they were able to play repetitive music that didn't seem redundant-- they launch a kinetic, jackhammer groove that might fit well on a new Boredoms CD if it was just a tad less funky. They change again, playing an emergency-siren guitar riff while Fleming slams anything in sight. It's a beautiful sound, and they're just getting started. ""Call Me Jesus"" and ""Nurser"" emphasize the pure noise aspects of LB's sound, though still with enough a sense of pulse as to grant them post-rock membership on a technicality. Again, though they tend to hit a beat and stick with it, the small details-- DeGrazia's horn interjections in the right speaker, or the vaguely King Crimson-esque ""chorus"" blasts-- make very little go a long way. This pays major dividends on the unthinkably massive ""Y Toros"", which finds a few hundred ways to play the same three notes during its 34-minute tour. In much the same way This Heat played with rhythm on ""Repeat"", LB very rarely let a phrase go by the same way twice. Furthermore, they take almost ten minutes to climax; that may sound gratuitous, and I'm sure some folks are going to run screaming from the room during parts of the second half of the piece, but if extended foreplay with a messy peak is your game, this band wants to love you. The second disc collects 1998's In Real Time and 1999's As If By Remote, documenting the band's considerable growth over its short lifespan. ""As If By Remote"" is exotic drone, full of disparate sound-bites, jungle bounce and a Middle Eastern guitar riff that leaves a dreamy haze over the entire tune-- a state perfected on the practically untouchable ""The Going Gong"". ""A Passing State of Well-Being"" serves up the sunny organ chords, similar to the vibe of the first tune on the other disc, but adds flute and a metronomic funk beat to transform what would be run-of-the-mill Chicago post-rock into muscular psychedelia. Similarly, ""Laddio's Money (Death of A Popsong)"" takes two chords and half a riff to construct what should be the world's most inept attempt at a Ted Nugent song into avant-garage greatness. Obviously, if instrumental freak-outs of any variety aren't your bag, Laddio Bolocko might induce migraines. Yet this is rarely ""noisy"" music: where their would-be peers are going for the loudest and fastest riffs imaginable, pushing boundaries of sound into thresholds of pain, LB seemed to have been heading in a more textured direction. It's too bad we won't get to hear where they might have ended up, because bands that can craft delicate stones as well as rocky rave-ups aren't terribly common. In any case, Life & Times comes very recommended for those in need of a jam.","NYC's Laddio Bolocko were borne of the ashes of classic early 90s post-rock. Formed in 1996 by members of ...

Danger! High Voltage EP,Electric Six,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc37eb335119a49ecbf2/1:1/w_160/4870bb3b.gif,2003-03-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2734-danger-high-voltage-ep/,XL,"I saw the best bands of my generation destroyed by blandness, shoegazing, somnambulant. Indie rock as we've known it, folks, is getting wrinkles, a bad back, and kidney stones. And don't look at me like that-- believe me, I'm as upset about it as anyone. It's just that Stephen Malkmus retreating to extended displays of technical ability, Doug Martsch retreating to acoustic Delta blues, and Liz Phair retreating to The Matrix gives me the creeping fear about the viability of our beloved genre. But dry your eyes, congregation, for the ""as we've known it"" is the key here, indicating as it does the mid-to-late collegiate brand of indie that's held the taste of those of us snapped into musical awareness by Nevermind. Thankfully, the term ""indie rock"" is one with little constraints regarding actual sound, not possessing the stylistic rules of something like ska, punk, or emo-- meaning the music thrown under the umbrella of ""indie rock"" can do the biologically natural thing and evolve like a muthafucka. Stephen J. Gould's major contribution to the field of evolutionary biology was the concept of punctuated equilibrium, the idea that the evolution of a species doesn't occur at a constant rate, but consists of long periods of inactivity marked by occasional bursts of frenetic change. Looking back at this point in time, people might point to two 2002 singles (!) as the major stimuli that caused indie rock to come under major selective pressure: ""House of Jealous Lovers"" by The Rapture and ""Danger! High Voltage"" by Electric Six (neé The Wildbunch). Listen to the songs back-to-back and you'll see the similarities: both enter, run around the room, and leave in a steady state of arms-flailing abandon, both utilize rhythms custom-fit for the dancefloor, both induce muscle spasms like a doctor getting crazy with the reflex tongs. Both songs also hinge on vocal hooks where the singer lets his voice fly like a Frisbee: ""House OVVV jealous lov-AHS!"" or ""Fire in the DISCO! Fire in the [breath] TACO BELL!"" And both came down the wire to us through resolutely non-indie channels-- The Rapture sliding through the wetness of the electroclash scene, Electric Six getting their break on 2 Many DJs' mashup opera, As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2. Perhaps surprisingly, given the paths they've taken, both songs have been largely accepted by the famous-for-their-frowns indie community, whose feet are not known for leaving the venue floor at any cost. There has lately been a shift from the enforced joylessness of indie gatherings, with indie-pop dance nights proliferating at an alarming rate and bands like Hot Hot Heat, Liars, and Out Hud inducing audiences to shake their bony thrift-store hips. The scene is primed, ladies and gentlemen, to take a dancy turn, trading in waves of sound and plaintive head-bobs for disco-punk beats and white-boy shimmy. I vaguely recollect that something of this nature happened in the early 80s-- and if you don't think the sound's potential has increased, consider the computers of 1982 next to our Pentium IV monsters. Into this breach, as we've already covered, flies ""Danger! High Voltage"", which is finally getting official stateside release in the form of a quick three-song and a remix EP on XL Recordings. The star of the show sounds slightly less enflamed separated from the frantic context of the 2 Many DJs mix, but still drops a hard beat, announcing itself with taut wah-wah guitars before exploding into fuzztone and horns while singer Dick Valentine duets with the White Stripes' Jack White. White's appearance certainly eased the song's warm acceptance into the indie world's bosom, and his throaty yelp is the perfect complement to Valentine's phlegmatic growl. Saxophone skronk, sounding good for the first time in years, only fans the flames even higher. Part of the allure of ""Danger!"" and ""House of Jealous Lovers"", though, is their easy adaptation into more traditional dance club format, and the ""Thin White Duke"" remix contained here manages to barely outdo the source material. Remixer Jacque Lu Cont transfers the chord progression to ominous, overdriven keyboards, but maintains the driving beat of the original drums and the twisted unison of White and Valentine. It's an electronic-rock hybrid that sounds vaguely Prodigy-esque, but also works nicely as a combo meal of rock grime and electro precision; happy Faint from the Motor City. The other two tracks on the EP skirt dangerously close to the garage-rock band that I suspect Electric Six once were, to varying danceability success. ""I Lost Control (Of My Rock & Roll)"" comes closest to being a respectable b-side to ""Danger! High Voltage"", built on a jagged riff and with a furiously simple vibraphone bridge that sounds like dancing on post-rock's grave. ""Remote Control (Me)"", on the other hand, is distressingly weak, its tired guitar lines sounding somewhat ridiculous under Valentine's melodramatic, husky vocals and easy metaphors. Tambourine can't save it. On a longer effort, ""Remote Control (Me)"" might be a forgivable blip, but as 25% of an EP, it's a critical error that suggests a less-than-surefire-exciting future for the group. And part of me wishes Electric Six would've spun the buzz from ""Danger!"" into a bona fide LP, rather than buying into the hype-feeding EP cycle that's being increasingly employed by the scene's hot prospects. That, of course, might just be the old way of thinking-- with the sound of indie rock changing, club pressures and technology could also be pushing the preferred format towards shorter players. It's quite possible I'm completely wrong about all this high-falutin' prophesizing-- I hate to break it to you, but sometimes us critics aren't quite The Weather Channel when it comes to accuracy. But the success of tracks like ""House of Jealous Lovers"" and ""Danger! High Voltage"" across traditional scene lines and into the formerly dancephobic world of indie has to signal some kind of movement, one that I'd be loath in my duties if I didn't excitedly hypothesize about. So my conclusion, and my advice to you, indie rocker, is to learn how to dance.","I saw the best bands of my generation destroyed by blandness, shoegazing, somnambulant.

"Love, Love, Love",Glass Candy,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf33eb335119a49ed1ac/1:1/w_160/6c7f7c51.jpg,2003-03-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3463-love-love-love/,Troubleman Unlimited,"There was this one time in the early 80s when my sister and I rocked-out to Parallel Lines on the front porch of our NJ home. I was maybe seven. During a rousing ""Heart of Glass"", a kid walked past and yelled, ""Disco sucks!"" That hurt my feelings. I wasn't a real disco fan, of course; I was too young to claim any kind of connoisseur status and listened to whatever my older sister and her friends passed to me, but this guy's invasive badmouthing bugged me. At the time it deflated an otherwise idyllic moment, but now when I think about his monolithic proclamation what bothers me most is that his lame genre-specificity points towards a small-minded view of music in which rock and disco exist as discreet objects pinned down by a few obvious signifiers. I mean, come on, neighborhood kid! As if one excludes or precludes the other! And as if either is purely a style! Shit intersects... Enter Glass Candy. Ida No (vocals), Ginger Peach (drums), and Johnny Jewel (guitar) have totally bad porn names and their heavy-handed take on the past isn't convincing or disarming, but with recent rave reviews by historical amnesiacs, a flurry of seven-inches on K and Troubleman, a live one-sided twelve-inch on Vermin Scum, some other difficult-to-find releases, and an upcoming cover story in Jane, they just might be the next big thing. The cover of Love Love Love, their 25-minute debut LP, depicts an intentionally blurred image of vocalist Ida No (rhymes with Karen O!) staring at the listener in a sort of sedated daze. The eye contact is very Parallel Lines, but Deborah Harry was more intense and seemed to be for real. Continuing the theme of anachronistic appropriation, No sports a black and white (or black and pink?) top, 80s hairdo, and is superimposed over a pink-tinted Portland skyline, her image partially obscured by the remnants of a pink lightning bolt striking from the heavens on a different panel. I'm not sure if this is to be accepted as a sign of interstellar transmigration. Maybe It's like that Oscar Wilde thing in Velvet Goldmine? No's passé pose in front of the cleanest city in which I've ever lived is interestingly iconic for the recent mushrooming of twenty-something bands obsessed with (whether they know it or not) James Chance & The Contortions, DNA, Lydia Lunch, and the recently revived Theoretical Girls. In the 1980s no wave emerged largely from the gritty downtown NYC art and loft scenes as disco, new wave, and punk came together and jammed a bit. As superficially as the new crop of ""death disco"" or post-punk bands sounds like their forbears, the nihilism and desire to destroy paradigms that spurred no wave has seemingly been conveniently repackaged as little more than a dandified fashion statement. Glass Candy are fun, but the manner in which they co-opt a storehouse of iconography is pathological. Of the eight tracks on the record, six are originals. ""Hurt"", the best song of the lot, is a revised version of synth-punk band The Screamers' ""I Wanna Hurt"", and the soulless reworking of the Rolling Stones' ""Last Time"" is passable, but nowhere near as compelling as Cat Power made ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"". All this amid the passe smoke machines, checkered ties, 70s haze, and candy font. If nothing else shouldn't these revivalists key their own mixed metaphors? Or at least exploit the shit with a smarter sense of depth? The most successful purveyor of over-the-top ""art-rock"" is the underrated Wynne Greenwood of Tracy & The Plastics. Live, through her use of self-reflexive video in which she stars as three ""distinct"" personality types, she turns her ecstatic new wave/disco/punk into an obvious performance complete with complex meta-narrative. Not only that, she has that Diamanda-Galas-esque voice to interestingly propel her dense song constructions (which also ransack hard rock and metal, but in a much more subtle way than the heavy-handed Glass Candy). Ida No, however, lacks Greenwood's vocal dexterity, and in her no-wave attempts to move beyond tune or tonality ends up sounding like some hipster doing Karaoke to Nina Hagen at some electro-clash night at some bar in Brooklyn. On a purely technical level, No is similar to Mariah Carey, pulling out all the tropes and just kind of yelling according to a pre-prescribed genre-specific passion. Within an already heavily footnoted genre, Glass Candy are laden by reference points. Like a self-indulgent short story by David Foster Wallace or some Borgesian tale questioning originality and authorship, this simulacrum lacks the pure immediacy of the original, turning what was at one point a kick in the ass of 80s materialism into an empty pose-- something to which you can dance absentmindedly, wondering if the asymmetrical hairdo you just paid $150 for looks vaguely authentic.","There was this one time in the early 80s when my sister and I rocked-out to\n\ Parallel Lines on ...

Passionoia,Black Box Recorder,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2cf13d1975652138953/1:1/w_160/be1659c7.jpg,2003-03-18 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/741-passionoia/,One Little Indian,"Terrorist trivia time! Did you know that Hezbollah operates a satellite TV network called Al Mana that boasts a viewership of 10 million and even features English-language news? True story. Its primary purpose is to recruit young Palestinians into martyr brigades, via detailed instructions and the now-proverbial 72-virgin retirement plan. In short, it's a TV network whose main objective is convincing its viewers to kill themselves. This pretty much happens to be Luke Haines' modus operandi, as well. There are talented songwriters who make disdain for the listener a part of their mystique (yup, Will Oldham), but Haines must be the only one to fashion it into a persistent lyrical trope. The very first Black Box Recorder single, ""Child Psychology"", extended you an invitation to ""kill yourself or get over it."" A quick skim through Haines' back catalog yields more fizzy bile. To date, the man has lit aircraft on fire, ordered girls to sing in the wreckage, implicated the listener in child murders and kidnappings, mused about blowing up clubs and murdering artists, and proposed marriage to Andy Warhol's attempted assassin Valerie Solanas. There's also his work as Baader-Meinhof, which glorified the legendary German anarchists of the same name, from their first demented meeting to their mass suicide in jail. It was a funk album. Haines has mellowed only once, on 2000's The Facts of Life, crafting the eponymous single-- an affectionate semi-spoken treatise on puberty-- that somehow became a minor UK hit. As British reviewers methodically noted, it could have been even more popular had Haines not referred to his record label as ""fucking cunts"" in an interview. The Top of the Pops moment came and went but the taste of it fuels the entirety of Passionoia, his third album with Black Box Recorder. The CD is a blunt parody of a ""success is hell"" concept album, wherein hilarity stems from the fact that The Facts of Life wasn't that big of a smash: In order to properly disdain his success, Haines has to wildly inflate it. Passionoia begins with ""The School Song"", a spoof of Black Box Recorder's sole hit and an auto-comment as bitter as ""Rape Me"", with none of the self-denegration. The contempt here is all outward: vocalist Sarah Nixey, cast as a starchy principal, spews S&M-speak; (""You lot need a bit of toughening up/ You're weak and spoilt, look at you"") while a choir of children chant ""Black Box Recorder!"" Yes, it's as obvious as it sounds, and it's not only a terrible opener, but a major misstep for the band in general. Surprisingly, things pick up immediately afterward, the remaining nine songs standing as almost uniformly terrific. ""Being Number One"" is a Blur-ry lark listing perks of fame: ""Triumphant return to the hometown/ Treated with love and respect/ A special school assembly/ Before, they would have broken my neck."" On ""The New Diana"", the band achieves accidental poignancy, even as the song's narrator is a ditz calmly listing her qualifications for the post of the next English Rose. ""Andrew Ridgeley"" mocks celebrity in general by dredging up the lesser half of Wham! for exaggerated worship. Haines even finds time to riff on his status as the band's ventriloquist, having Sarah Nixey intone the lyric, ""This is Sarah Nixey talking."" Passionoia is just esoteric enough to pleasantly fluster (go decipher ""GSOH Q.E.D."", a pursed-lips romp through newspaper personals). But it's also wickedly smart; if you think intelligence in indie lyrics must come at the expense of coherence, take in a couple of these impeccably linear narratives. The arrangements, meanwhile, are Haines' usual fare-- deceptively cute, a tad on the lazy side, but always memorable. The funniest thing about Black Box Recorder has always been that, embodying all things British, they end up sounding French. This paradox is in full effect on Passionoia: Blippier numbers seem informed by Air, and chord progressions borrow from disco-era Gainsbourg. If you confronted Luke Haines about it, he'd probably chalk it up to situationism and Guy Debord and free-floating signifiers. Or maybe he'd just say fuck it and kill you.","Terrorist trivia time!

Scenes One Through Thirteen,Hot Hot Heat,by: Matt Stephens,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c11f13d197565213bb51/1:1/w_160/751f97fc.jpg,2003-03-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3926-scenes-one-through-thirteen/,OhevOhev,"These are great times for Canada. Not only is it not headed for a war only 37% of its population approves of, it has, in the past two years, become a hotbed of indie activity, unleashing stellar underground hip-hop from Buck 65, and Swollen Members, experimental weirdness by Godspeed You Black Emperor and Set Fire to Flames, the post-punk of The Constantines and Radio Berlin, and the stunning pop of bands like The New Pornographers, Broken Social Scene, and, of course, Hot Hot Heat. Make Up the Breakdown was truly one of the most uniquely entertaining rock records of 2002. A curiously appealing batch of organ-driven rockers, packed with twisted-up melodies and breakneck time changes, it made for a half-hour of music that was, above all else, incredibly fun-- and mere weeks after its release, it sent these Victoria-based hipsters into the indie-hype stratosphere. The music seemed pre-packaged to shun labeling, but at its base we could detect a steady balance of new wave quirk and post-punk angularity, with the throaty, viciously overwrought vocals of Steve Bays making or breaking the band for listeners. Those who dug his unusual style, or could at least get beyond it, found a markedly original album, free of the navelgazing emo pretensions that taint so many of their indie rock brethren. In short, Make Up the Breakdown inspired as much dancing and good cheer as it did journalistic hyperbole-- an attribute that Warner Bros. surely took into account when signing the band near the end of the year. So it seems only logical that at least some semblance of Make Up the Breakdown's sound would exist on Scenes One Through Thirteen, a compilation of old seven-inch EPs that showcases the band in their noisier, scruffier, and ultimately less enjoyable embryonic stage. Unfortunately, these songs, while far more crunchy and furious than anything on Breakdown, tend to approach tedium in their sheer brutality; though it all makes for music jagged enough to cause lacerations, it's rarely likeable on its own terms. There are three chief problems here: one is the grating, guttural vocals of the massively hardcore-influenced ex-frontman Matthew Marnik, who was later kicked out of the band and replaced by then-keyboardist Bays; second, despite its hardcore leanings, the album lacks any guitar whatsoever, with the band leaning on only keyboards, drums and vocals; and lastly, there's scarcely a melody to be found. The band's grasp on unconventional song structure, distinctive arrangements and jerky dynamics are all present, but Hot Hot Heat neglect to craft any real songs around them-- in fact, they seem stubbornly preoccupied with simply grinding as hard as they possibly can, with little regard for anything else. The record's overt hot-bloodedness quickly becomes pedestrian as these unstable, atonal tracks tend to blend together without finding much purpose-- perhaps that's why they were originally released as seven-inches. If nothing else, Scenes One Through Thirteen does make for an interesting sort of where-were-they-then archival document, proving that, as a rhythmic unit, they were always pretty tight (check Paul Hawley's ruthless, multi-dimensional drumming). It also further lifts confidence for what they may be able to achieve by the time their next record sees release. But even so, I wouldn't imagine the group has enough die-hard fans to warrant the release of what essentially amounts to old demos-- a sound they themselves have entirely disowned, and even now seem embarrassed of. Which all leaves Scenes One Through Thirteen, at best, a moderately interesting chronicle of Hot Hot Heat's development from volatile screamers into the unique pop band they are today.","These are great times for Canada.

In his native Japan he's released an uncountable number of records under many different names in every dance music style imaginable, and this IDM/ambient stuff is seen as an esoteric side project. Meanwhile, though he's never made much of an impact on the stateside dance scene, those interested in more abstract electronics have shown an increasing interest in the ambient series started in the last few years, highlights of which include Sakura and Grinning Cat. I mention Yokota's tangled history to point up that, despite his prodigious output, he never makes the same album twice. Though his records on Leaf sometimes share certain moods and qualities, Yokota is constantly varying arrangements and instrumental textures. With The Boy and the Tree, Yokota discards completely the hushed, patient melodies of Sakura and Grinning Cat and builds most tracks around sampled percussion. The dynamic range is still flat enough for many of these tracks to sound calm and internal, but I would hesitate to use the word ""ambient"" to describe a good half of this record. Yokota's primary interest on The Boy and the Tree seems to be the emotional quality of percussion as it inhabits an acoustic space. The woodblocks, djembe, and metallic bells that fill up ""Live Echo"" aren't ordered into particularly interesting patterns, but the way they seem to bounce off the stone enclosures that surround them is intriguing. ""Grass, Tree and Stone"" has similarly steady and repetitive drums at its core, and it adds the kind of twitching guitar reverb one associates with Ennio Morricone. Both these tracks have buried somewhere in the percussion wailing tribal voices of indeterminate origin. ""Plateau on Plateau"" also uses loops of processed guitar and voices, but the percussion here comes from bells and what sounds like hands beating on thick leather pads. A few other tracks on The Boy and the Tree follow the same template as the ones I've mentioned, and for the most part, I find this lot to be on the dull side. The tight, unwavering way Yokota has sequenced these loops makes it too easy for them to slip completely into the background. Once the layers fall in and the sounds are set in motion, the pattern basically repeats until Yokoto pulls the plug. The drum sounds chosen come from the family of percussion most of us would associate with collective activity-- improvisations, celebrations, drum circles and the like. And without the variation that comes from communication, the tracks seem flat and lifeless, if sonically impressive. But The Boy in the Tree has a handful of stunning tracks-- Yokota is just too talented for it to be otherwise. The cooing voices on ""Secret Garden"", though set against an overly repetitive acoustic guitar pattern, are haunting, and Yokota wisely cuts the almost too-beautiful voices with odd swells of noise. And while I can't say ""Thread Leads to Heaven"" is the most original of tracks (it's basically a minimalist canon thing played on what sounds like a toy organ), I am utterly powerless to resist its wide-eyed charm and simple sense of wonder. So, the mildly curious shouldn't worry about missing this Yokota release. Besides, there will certainly be another one along shortly.","There is a massive iceberg looming underneath the music we know from Susumu Yokota's work with Leaf. In his ...

Astral Collapse,Angus Maclise,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35b5e6ef95969323801/1:1/w_160/5a55f6e3.jpg,2003-03-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5023-astral-collapse/,LocustQuakebasket,"I'm not exactly going out on a critical limb saying that Keith Moon was one of the all-time great rock drummers, nor am I bucking the trend by slagging his god-awful solo record. Two Sides of the Moon, abandoned the brilliant potential of a prolonged ""Cobwebs and Strange"" propulsion or side-long extension of the violin ending he tacked onto ""Baba O'Riley"". He didn't even take the drumsticks into his meaty hands, for Christ's sake, much less set up an explosive drum kit. All he did on that bastardized album was sing! And wretchedly at that. Angus Maclise, on the other hand, was far more the Renaissance Man: making his own calendars, doing calligraphy, publishing homemade collections of his poems and spiritual tracts, and acting in underground flicks, not to mention founding the original incarnation of The Velvet Underground. To those already entranced by his late-blooming legacy (he passed away prematurely at age 41 back in the late 1970s with no readily available documentation of his efforts), he is remembered as a powerful percussionist. Whether in his hand-drumming duties sustaining The Dream Syndicate (featuring future minimal legends like La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Tony Conrad, and John Cale) or in the incessant rainfalls and thunderheads from the storms of Nirvana that he conjured up on the 39-minute mind expansion of ""Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda (St. Marks Epiphany)"" from the first Quakebasket archival unearthing, Maclise was one of the few original percussionists to come along in the last century, tapping into the ancient tradition that the drums could invoke and carrying it into the future. As he puts it in the poem that opens up this third disc of old tapes to be compiled: ""You are not limited to one room, there are many rooms."" Which certainly is true, as this collection explores the numerous facets of his far-reaching capabilities. The music, however, suffers not so much from dilution or scattering of energies as much as it does from remembrance of the beatific strength of his drumming capabilities so rarely on display here. On Astral Collapse Maclise concerns himself more with other possible disciplines: poetry recital, Gysin-esque tape collage, early synth meltdowns, and harmonium hums. ""Smothered Under Astral Collapse"" offers an explanation of Tibetan rituals that he was pondering at the time, before engaging in an Innersystems-like mashing of babbling beardisms with odd tape splicing in the background. This leads into a harmonium-hover of sustained drone that is surprisingly light on its feet, nimbly waltzing on wavering overtones that build over seventeen minutes. It finds him to still be extremely sympathetic with other New York lofters of the early 70s like La Monte Young, Terry Riley, and Charlemagne Palestine, though he isn't as obsessively focused as these gents. Only once, on ""Beezlebub"", does Maclise pull out the Beat bongos, and even then promptly chucks them into a haunted pressure cooker, making a most intense and unholy clatter of percussion and disquieting ghost noise. ""Cloud Watching"" is diffuse and calming, echoing and glistening with numerous gongs, bells, and strings. The tape quality of some of these restored pieces is less than ideal, but in the right setting, it reveals less the hi-fidelity flaws than the curious aura of tapes gooey with hash haze, transmitting by contact high. The fifth track reveals a heavy Sun Ra presence, as he transubstantiates the Arp circuits into star plasma, firing intense tazer rounds into the headspace with some background clopping coming almost as an afterthought. ""Dracula"" begins as an excellent dose of tape collaging and tambour buzzes, as birds, location recordings, tape loops, and electronic noises blur into one messed-up entity, but the stoned poetry reading that comes to the fore and pushes back the psychedelic noise is more of a buzz-kill, a bummer that brings down the remainder of the trip. Maybe drummers should just stay away from singing.","I'm not exactly going out on a critical limb saying that Keith Moon was one of the all-time great ...

Bousha Blue Blazes,Alejandra and Aeron,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a042ea9e61561daa4517/1:1/w_160/3073145d.gif,2003-03-17 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/103-bousha-blue-blazes/,Orthlorng Musork,"I've always considered folk a sort of private music, which goes against most of what I've read about it; in general, traditional folk music is described as ""of the people"" and representing universal experiences of pain, love and the otherwise mundane. Yet folk music almost always seems tied to a particular time and place, often indelibly related to the person making it. I hear Elizabeth Cotton's motherly, eternally optimistic plea, ""I don't wanna be treated this old way,"" and think of all the crap she must've gone through; I hear Leadbelly throw down lines like, ""Shot James Brady, gonna shoot him again,"" as if he'd killed a hundred men without a second thought. Even Dylan spouting ""I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard"" rings true with me. In all of these cases, I'm struck by the universal sentiment, yet the songs are nonetheless distinctly individual. In this way, folk music has always had an effect on me similar to free jazz, musique concrete or even noise: they all channel a desire to express what is generally considered inexpressible, though just as often, they represent the radically subjective. When Dylan spouts, or Stockhausen splices primitive electronics with German radio broadcasts, there's a tangible divide between what would be absolute truth and complete alienation. It's tough to stand on the fence with that music, even more so when it's decades removed from its birth. Of course, folk, in all its forms, has endured, and if there really is a relationship between the music of Dylan and Stockhausen, it is that practically anyone is invited to join in (if not necessarily to hum the same tune). Electronic and found-sound experimenters Alejandra Salinas and Aeron Bergman seem to be on a similar trajectory as the aforementioned musicians. Taking elements of mundane existence from kitchen scatter to storefront hustle to parlor room piano, they cut and filter with laptop precision, arranging the sounds into an almost documentary narrative; their music is folk merely by proxy. On three records prior to Bousha Blue Blazes (including the ethnomusical document Folklore, Vol. 1: La Rioja, source material for their Ruinas Encantadas disc), the Spain-based duo collected sounds familiar to almost anyone and manipulated them into music that, while culled from the mundane, was decidedly abstract. Their latest release uses most of the same tactics, but rather than proceed as an experiment in sound, it feels to me like a labor of love and loss, one of considerable depth. Simply put-- and despite my fear that it could fairly easily polarize listeners-- it's an incredibly beautiful set of music. The story of Bousha Blue Blazes is that Bergman's grandmother Bousha visited his home in Spain during Christmas 2001, and that all sounds on this record are taken from that time. After the very brief, laptop-manipulated guitar fanfare of ""\xC1nimo"", ""Humming Radio Caro Cariño"" sneaks in with distant violin and guitar pluck; soon enough, Bousha's passive, pleasant singing arrives, joining an old tune on the radio. Very quickly, the comfortable milieu of their living room is established, but it's just as quickly detoured by soft, high computer tones and a repetitive guitar figure. The tones float alongside, but rarely interrupt the trio, as the piece glides in and out of focus. ""Thanksgiving Going on Anyway"" begins on a stuttering, almost glitch pulse when all of a sudden, what sounds like a wine glass being shattered in the right channel introduces a muffled crowd of people, presumably sitting down to dinner. The broken pulse recurs now and again, and sometimes sine beeps (and lots of other unidentified noises) punctuate the mix like glitter on a tapestry. It's a very highly detailed music, but it doesn't overwhelm the senses-- in fact, like the best moments on this CD, it invites you to move closer. Since many of the tracks feature vocals, they often resolve into semi-songs. ""Amapola Dust"" features Bousha's refrain ""I love you"" over shimmering, sliced cymbals, vinyl crackle, and its own echo looped and considerably processed. ""I Don't Know"" is actually a straight song performed by Bousha, and sounds unaltered. Apparently, she had been a professional singer in the past, and although a few years removed from the stage may have taken strength from her voice, she's still graceful. ""Know I Don't"" follows, and the title suggests it may have taken source material from the previous tune, though its construction is obviously laptop-generated. Two minutes in, the voices and piano drop out for a cavernous, bottomless trip into the black abyss. Quiet but weighty ambience surrounds, and it almost feels as if I've plunged into the deepest regions of a northern river, unable to sense much but my own helplessness. There is no sound but the still, consonant roar of the beyond; in music it's sometimes hard to tell exactly where I am, though this place seems close to birth, or perhaps death. Of course, Bousha Blue Blazes is the kind of record that could inspire completely different impressions from someone else, or even myself at a different time. Like the best folk, or any other purely expressionist form of music, it not only relies on the methods and particular point of view of the performers, but on the hope that someone will intercept its transmission, thereby magnifying the impact. As I see it, Alejandra and Aeron's remarkable achievement is not only in the unique way they translate the warmth and wisdom of an otherwise completely unfamiliar woman and location, but in how they did it with such ingenuity. Far from a private experience, music like this stays alive as long as it has an audience with which to connect.","I've always considered folk a sort of private music, which goes against most of what I've read about ...

Dartmouth Street Underpass,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa22c0084474cd0c114d/1:1/w_160/634183c4.jpg,2003-03-17 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8660-dartmouth-street-underpass/,LocustMet Life,"As I lay in a country bed, trying to craft a worthwhile opening paragraph, I am constantly distracted by these sounds around me. One is a squeaky ceiling fan, which cries as it slowly rotates and rocks in the slow, humid air. The other is my Grandpa snoring symphonically through the thin wood panel walls, with such a frightful gale as to suck up his own nostrils. And outside the window are the distant cries of coyotes, yelping and yapping out on the shadows of the countryside. Yet, somewhere between my ears there exists a spectacular balance to the proceedings, as my head draws and mixes them together into a satisfying musical whole. If I only had a microphone in which to save and later savor these sounds! Apparently, Keith Fullerton Whitman feels a similarly procreant urge to capture these brief moments of life that seem to be outside of ordinary reality. In the Dartmouth Street tunnel that runs from Back Bay Station in Boston to Copley Plaza, a cavernous walkway lined with glass brick walls reflects the sounds of passengers and trains in such a way as to sound like music to his ears. We have utility doors banging, footsteps on a catwalk, some lost guitar reverberating down the walkways, the arrivals and departures of three trains, and all the percussive accompaniment of people running to make their transfers. As the piece moves on, an odd sound phenomenon begins to envelop the daily proceedings. About five minutes in, this mechanized drone of the trains disappearing down the tunnel coalesces into a heavy constant undertow of sound, swallowing up the guitar, passengers, and the approach of other trains, sustaining the snippet beyond its apparent qualities. What separates this material from the field recordings on the old Folkways label is that the raw sound taped by Whitman is conversely used to create a new piece, almost a reflection of the original sounds which are now bent and refracted through his eyes and ears. Whitman's response piece runs nearly the same length as the centerpiece, and is remixed in real time, combining these elements along with some of the life sounds from where he was doing the remixing, on his front porch. Here, Whitman builds on the odd metallic train drone of the original with a harmonium-like resonance, washing everything out with a beautiful haze of generator buzz, becoming the thick air of the underpass itself, completely saturated in humid humming. He even lets the birds in the trees and the cars on the street make an appearance as the drone begins its gentle descent back into the everyday. Those expecting sounds like those found on last year's polished Playthroughs won't find them here; the production on this outing has a much rougher aura. Whereas each note of Playthroughs seemed almost like a singular pearl, Dartmouth Street Underpass provides a gritty ether that sticks to the skin, as dirty in its ambiance as the subway's platforms on a muggy day. It's also important for newcomers to note that Whitman has experimented with this premise before, to more satisfying ends. His CD-R releases Car Passings at Night and Manchester-by-the-Sea similarly manipulated the sounds of cars passing on wet roads and waves crashing on a beach. Of these releases, Manchester-by-the-Sea remains the most compelling. Dartmouth is closer to Car Passings in both subject and replayability-- an interesting experiment that rewards listening, but rarely engages on a visceral level.","As I lay in a country bed, trying to craft a worthwhile opening paragraph, I am constantly distracted by these ...

"Melody, Melody, Melody and More Melody",The Phenomenological Boys,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0555e6ef9596931ff0b/1:1/w_160/e4bf1771.gif,2003-03-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6265-melody-melody-melody-and-more-melody/,Tomlab,"Imagine that your spastic kid brother broke into your stash of uppers, your mother's make-up cabinet, and your grandfather's old 78 collection, and you'll have a sense of the tone this album sets in its first thirty seconds. If you just took the seven impeccably paced collages scattered throughout the disc, you'd have a riveting three minutes. The blaring rhumba outros and ominous brass fanfares seem to be taken from the recurring dream where you're Ricky Ricardo having an acid flashback. The Spike Jones mumbles and hambone rat-a-tat-taps, on the other hand, are nightmares drawn from your previous life as a minstrel-show manager. Yes, the interludes are marvelous. But it's the stuff in between-- all 35:29 of it-- that confirms my suspicion about an album whose title includes the word ""melody"" more than three times. These people must have something to hide. Let's dispel some rumors. First, The Phenomenological Boys are not boys. The only consistent human presence on the album is a female voice by turns airy, flat and thin; she sounds more like a prissy big sister than a boy genius. And the rest of the production, from the mess of vintage samples to the Casio-thin backgrounds, is much too concertedly juvenile to be the product of boyish fantasy. Then there's the issue of phenomenology. The only full sentences in the cutesy liner notes, an impenetrable quote from Husserl, don't really help anything: ""The physical thing belonging to nature, is nothing less than this perceived tree as perceived which, as perceptual sense, inseparably belongs to the perception."" Giant nerd-chic red herring, anyone? Image aside, the Boys' early-TMBG-ish songwriting approach, with wacky samples filling out off-color textures behind loopy folkish hooks, had me expecting so very much. I was grinning widely through the incongruous hash of close croonings, free sax solos, and piercing strings of ""He's So Dumb"", which held out the promise of a melodic pop album composed entirely of mixed-and-matched wax. At this point, it's not even clear the vocals haven't also been lifted from some obscure vault, so the shoddy lyrics come off as intriguingly mediocre, although the illusion of foundness is shattered at lines like, ""He thinks that Axl Rose is pit crew deodorant."" The next track, while disabusing me of the mix-and-match fantasy with a brilliant doo-wop groove that leans heavily on a tinny little synth pattern, held out some hope yet: at the bridge all sense of meter is lost for good, and as tracks are dropped back in without the slightest regard for synchronicity, it feels like someone is slowly rearranging the features of your best friend's face without telling you what the hell is going on. If Frank Zappa built a great monument to the idiocy of doo-wop, then with this song The Phenomenological Boys have inadvertently demolished it. I wish I could go on like this. But I'm sorry to report that the rest of the album is as obnoxiously sloppy in songwriting as it is in musicianship and production, in a way that makes the promise of the first two songs seem like nothing but bitter lies. ""Visit to Venus"" really bursts the bubble, as the sense of an ever-unfolding plunderphonic adventure collapses in on the vapid powder-pop sensibility I'd been trying so hard to ignore. ""Yodeling in Heaven"" is a well-executed one-joker (""But before the day came he was swallowed in flames/ 'Twas a chemical spill out on I-94"") with the dinky glockenspiel, zippy slide guitar, and pitiful calliope to back up its puny little mock-pathos. At this point, the album this could have been is critically injured, if not quite on its deathbed. The next track deals a blunt head wound, and two tracks later, no one in their right mind would even try to check for vital signs. Shame that three wonderful minutes of choice retro-collage had to be ruined by such pig-headedly unmusical excuses for melody.","Imagine that your spastic kid brother broke into your stash of uppers, your mother's make-up cabinet, and your grandfather ...

So potent are these materials, merely perusing one paragraph red-lines the hype meter, which leads to our failing the weekly objectivity screening and the predetermined penalty: answering angry emails from Nine Inch Nails fans we dissed two years ago. So before I even bother filling the cup, this is my admission of guilt: I read the press release for this Liaisons Dangereuses record, and I actually responded to the first line: ""this is probably the most highly anticipated electronic CD reissue of all times,"" mentally entering in the obvious 10.0 it most certainly deserved. Whacked out of my skull on propaganda, I didn't even think for a second about what else could be considered a highly anticipated electronic reissue (Derrick May's debut full-length, an Arthur Russell singles collection-- even Stockhausen's Hymnen come to mind), nor did I even listen to Liaisons Dangereuses before buying in. I mean, if DJ Hell is spinning it, who am I to disagree? While Hit Thing's tag line is ridiculous, there's plenty of aural evidence to place this mysterious artifact high on any historian's list, dating from a crucial juncture in the development of electronic music in Europe: the dawn of the eighties. ""Mystere dans le Brouillard"" has a heavy Eurotrash throb-- fashioned by Chrislo Haas (ex-DAF) and Beate Bartel (ex-Mania D.)-- with thrusting French grunts from relatively unknown singer, Krishna Goineau. The synthesizers glisten like piss on broken wine bottles in a dark corridor of Le Mètro, alongside the roar of an oncoming train, approaching fast. The track that's most often spun on dancefloors, ""Los Niños del Parque"", squirms like Giorgio Moroder squeezing into some tight leather pants slathered with black tar heroin, dark and foreboding as the peculiar German-Spanish patois of Goineau mingles with feminine mewls and yelps. At times, the group fuse together clashing musical fashions into surprisingly stylish cuts almost too incredible to believe. On ""Etre Assis ou Danser"", they sound like Damo Suzuki doing white lines, fronting Taco, injecting some street-meth, squawking sax into the track. Sometimes they echo similar work from their peers in Cabaret Voltaire, over on the British Isles. On a track like ""Aperitif de la Mort"", Liaisons Dangereuses are incredibly menacing, as they take the spoken word moments of the Cosmic Couriers and rub some of Neubaten's scrap metal along their unwashed armpits, as Goineau babbles like Alan Vega, slobbering wine through the streets of Paris. ""Peut Etre-Pas"" could be next in line for the Disco Not Disco series, falling somewhere between classic Yello and lesser-knowns recently excavated from the early days of electro. The bass is rubbery, like one of Mister Fantastic's condoms, the vocals squalid and bizarre; you can see why this would lace the sets of Carl Craig, Derrick May, and the current crop of electroclash spinners. Twenty years on, Liaisons Dangereuses' only album proves they were way ahead of their time and its hot fashion sense.","There's a reason editors don't let writers see the one-sheets that come with CDs: to keep us away ...

Model 91,Christmas Decorations,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c2b1335d7bf1698c98/1:1/w_160/9149b23d.jpg,2003-03-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1455-model-91/,KrankyKranky,"People who don't like experimental albums tend to point up similar ""flaws"": there are no ""songs"", it's too minimal, the musicians don't play their instruments well, or don't do enough with them...but whether complainers come around or not, one expectation everyone should have is for that record to push your boundaries or buttons in some way. It should show you a new tactic, or a personal voice-- something to set it apart from everything you've heard before. Even with such limited criterion, there are albums that just have nothing going on. The biggest problem with Christmas Decorations' debut Model 91 isn't that it's simple or limited, but that within their constricted style, they aren't doing anything new or illuminating. Steve Silverstein (aka Madam Estrella) and Nick Forte (of Rorschach and Beautiful Skin) play what could be described as primitive pop-electronica, made with low-tech gear and chincy-sounding digital sequencers. You could as easily tag them as indie rock: they play guitar and bass, though they don't do much with their instruments. Whatever you call it, the album fails on a basic level: it never engages the listener. Christmas Decorations stick within a rigid sound world. Most of the thirteen tracks are short instrumentals-- about three minutes apiece-- built on thin effects and beats; they layer ambient waves over the music in a disinterested, ""look what this effect does!"" fashion. Each piece is basic and barebones, aiming for mood: some pieces loom like haunted dreams, but most are tainted by canned ""spooky"" guitar effects. There's no hint as to what we're supposed to be haunted by, however, or what's so haunting about this music. Without dynamics, there's no chance we'll find a particular passage any more or less affecting than another. Vocal tracks fare better, presenting skittish avant pop with goofy arrangements and nonsense lyrics. The best song, ""A Random Hill"", pits a British-accented lead and catchy harmonies over a melodica and samples; others, like ""Lowlands"" and ""Hen's Teeth"" suffer for their tedious attempts to wax sinister. Between the amateur vocals and skewed, deconstructed songs, you can almost trace a line to Brian Eno's 70s ""pop"" records, but that's just another reminder: this was done far better decades ago, when people first started taking pop apart. That those folks pushed the boundaries much farther and wrote better songs is further damnation for these young turks.

She Has No Strings Apollo,Dirty Three,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99a9d034d5c69bf526e/1:1/w_160/36c7d1d1.jpg,2003-03-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2330-she-has-no-strings-apollo/,Touch and Go,"It seems like only a matter of time before some bloated instrumental rock collective releases an album consisting of fifty-five bowed guitars, ten full drumsets, and a guy hitting a cat with a frying pan, all engaged in a single belabored crescendo. The musical vocabulary of instrumental rock seems to be largely oriented towards communal gestures, in both the grandiose swell of quasi-orchestral groups and the gratuitously irregular time signatures and binary melodic patterns of math-rock. And then there are the Dirty Three. The instrumental rock of violinist Warren Ellis, guitarist Mick Turner, and drummer Jim White has always held a determined gaze on melody and mood. Each of the three players has a distinct style, and when they're on-- as they were on their past three album-- the results can be stunning. At their best, Ellis' melancholy violin set against the backdrop of White's skeletal percussion and Turner's hypnotic guitar evokes the painful sensory acumen of a man wandering desperately alone through the Outback's dustiest deserts. Even as Ellis, Turner, and White expanded their sound significantly with 2000's unbearably gorgeous Whatever You Love You Are, their music benefited from a perfectly considered lack of excess. Unfortunately, She Has No Strings Apollo sees the sharp and evocative sound of Dirty Three falling slightly out of focus. Though all the elements that make their music great are still present, never do they crystallize and come together quite like they have in the past. Suffice to say, the mood isn't nearly as powerful when the aforementioned desert becomes a lush forest, and the man stalking it comes well-prepared, with tourists in tow. She Has No Strings Apollo opens with ""Alice Wading"", a song that could be described as a beautiful set populated by subpar actors. At about the three-minute mark, a repeated pizzicato pattern gives way to soaring bowed passages, just before White enters with one of the most steady, unchallenging rhythms on the album. The structure of the song is certainly complex, but the segues between parts don't sound particularly elegant or organic. By the time Ellis' violin is brought to the front of the mix for a few moments of gorgeous, strained melody, the song is already on the wane. Indeed, a dearth of strong melody is perhaps the biggest complaint to be levied against this record. Ellis' violin is multitracked to death throughout the record, and while the resulting richness is often welcome, the expressiveness of the clear, melodic lines that make so much of Ellis' work compelling is often lost in the mix. On ""Long Way to Go with No Punch"", Ellis' playing is segmented by swells of piano, as Turner's guitar and White's drums are kept at a near-whisper. On ""Rude (And Then Some Slight Return)"", that same whisper becomes a roar of violent noise, as Ellis' violin is swallowed up by distortion and Turner's guitar squeals in the foreground. The apex of She Has No Strings Apollo comes with ""No Stranger Than That"", which re-enlists the structure of ""Alice Wading"" with much more compelling results. Here, the multitracking of Ellis' violin is anything but a detriment, as Ellis weaves several soaring melodies around the gorgeous frame provided by Turner and White. Rather than concealed, the full character and timbre of the violin is brought out, and the track is much, much stronger for it. So even though it's host to a few spectacular moments, there's little to be found on She Has No Strings Apollo beyond any of the band's always lovely slabs of old-country post-rock. While by no means a weak release, many of the most enjoyable moments on She Has No Strings Apollo reflect only minimally the band's unique strengths. Instead, Dirty Three's singular emotional pull is sacrificed in favor of a more sonically grand, but ultimately less captivating sound-- proof that even an instrumental band can lose its voice.","It seems like only a matter of time before some bloated instrumental rock collective releases an album consisting of fifty-five ...

Ass Cobra / Apocalypse Dudes,Turbonegro,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82b5e6ef95969321150/1:1/w_160/1e57f650.jpg,2003-03-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11851-ass-cobra-apocalypse-dudes/,BlitzcoreBlitzcore,"Before the hype, I unknowingly stumbled upon Turbonegro's daunting physiognomy when a friend, visiting from Tokyo, took me on a search for the first Iron Maiden record. Totally engrossed in Bleeker Bob's extensive metal section, we were blown away by a photograph of what looked like a heavy-set Alice Cooper and his denim-obsessed friends, by songs titles like ""Hobbit Motherfuckers"" and ""I Got Erection"" (among others), and finally by the over-sexed coming-of-age liner notes to Ass Cobra, by ""King Irwin"" The Whiskey Rebel. In the language of a cracked-out Henry Miller (or Vince McMahon), this so-called rebel proclaimed that-- like Tristram Shandy-- he wouldn't have been born if his father hadn't ""come"" in the right place, that his strapping adopted Norwegian parents had a lot of sex, and how when he first saw Turbonegro in Oregon they managed to turn on an entire party of women (and men ""coming to grips with their feminine side""). That this band of frumpy metal heads-- men that could almost pull of black sweat suits-- were ""Norway's greatest band ever."" That's certainly a lot of rock-n-roll potential, but we were bummed to see they'd prematurely stopped their attack in 1998 when vocalist Hank Von Helvete went into intensive care at a psychiatric unit in Milan for an addiction to heroin and darkness. Ever a fan of the modernist cult of genius, this premature breakup only added to the flames of an already ferociously burning fire, a church torched in the name of death punk! So yeah, we were hooked. In their decade together, Turbonegro released at least two classic records: Ass Cobra (1996) and Apocalypse Dudes (1997), both reissued by Epitaph in 2003. Ass Cobra is the more immediate and rougher of the two, with the brilliant ""Denim Demon""-- the best teenage outcast anthem since Danzig left the Misfits. On Apocalypse Dude, ""Prince of the Rodeo"" combines piss-drunk L.A. thrash and a purer understanding of the band that inspired it. It channels Van Halen's first two records in a straight, wailing hard rock anthem, a classic piece of guitar showmanship precious few bands could hope to pull off. The addition of guitarist Euroboy and new drummer Chris Summers yields a denser sound: Check out the constant guitar tapping on ""Get It On"", and the ponderous, nearly Yes expansiveness of ""The Age of Pamparious"". The music isn't as heavy as I'd imagined; some friends and I watched the video for ""Get It On"" at work without any speakers, then decided to take votes on what music could possibly live up to the ridiculous imagery, of Hank Von Helvete in full face paint brandishing a cane-cum-riding-crop, the rest of the band decked out in sailor caps and red lipstick, driving nowhere in a car. Recalling a number of Guns 'n' Roses videos, Slash perched on mountain tops or in solitary confines for his half-assed solos, guitarist Euroboy plays quickly and with skill, in a stable. But we couldn't hear him. One of us said there would have to be electronic drums. I mentioned Roxy Music fronted by King Diamond. Someone else mentioned The Stooges and Danzig. Oddly enough, they ended up sounding kind of like a better, three-dimensional version of The Hives, though Hives' vocalist Pele Almqvist speaks elsewhere of watching and admiring Turbonegro when he was in high school, so I guess it's more proper to say The Hives are a bad version of Turbonegro. Though they've recorded for Man's Ruin, Sympathy for the Record Industry and Amphetamine Reptile, had a tribute album recorded in their honor (Alpha Motherfuckers, Blitzcore; 2001), and despite increasingly loud championing by Rocket From The Crypt, Dave Grohl, Jello Biafra, Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age (who cover ""Back to Dungaree High"") and the famously crotchety Steve Albini, Turbonegro remain best known in the US for their back-story. The decidedly 1970s East Village ""gay"" look-- bright red lipstick, Tom of Finland's facial hair and denim suits amid images of male on male blowjobs-- whether satirical or not, is pretty daring when placed in the context of our always uptight hard rock scene. Basically, Turbonegro are heterosexual men obsessed with other men's asses. Ass Cobra is the most overt in this regard: it's here that they sing about a ""tender"" sailor man, re-envision ""Midnight Rambler"" as ""Midnight NAMBLA"" (complete with children making nervous sounds), and decorate the album with images by Tom of Finland and old German men servicing one another. The butt fetish continues on Apocalypse Dudes, which has the Meatmen-like ""Rendezvous With Anus"". The perpetually sweaty Von Helvete often ends their sets by sticking a sparkler up his ass-- G.G. Allin watch out!-- so the question is, is this offensive, or are we talking grand Swiftian satire? What makes Turbonegro such a beloved band of hard rockers is the fact that they're intelligent, something their American counterparts have had a tougher time proving in recent years. Turbonegro's painfully clichéd but stunningly executed rock-n-roll excess reminds me of when I saw The Ramones play to a packed City Gardens. I was 16, and at first, nervous and intimidated by the male bodies crashing around the stage, but ultimately they unearthed exhilaration in this smoky, stinking, kind of stupid space, so far outside my usual suburban home. Today, as a cynical 29-year-old who for the most part nods out at the banality of live music, any band that can chip away at years of boredom and shift my head towards the nervous energy of that first punk offering must be onto something worthwhile. It might be the best praise I can offer Turbonegro: these records make me absolutely giddy.",,9.0,
Fast Asleep,Funki Porcini,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be5fabf31b7dc7156136/1:1/w_160/d63b2623.jpg,2003-03-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3248-fast-asleep/,Ninja Tune,"Marco di Dominicis is fluent in Italian; I am, to date, not. Consequently, I find myself largely unable to decipher his liner notes to Fast Asleep, a fact which would normally cause me some degree of distress, owing to my megalomaniacal desire to know everything at all times. That, however, is the true beauty of James Bradell's fourth release as Funki Porcini; it makes me not want to learn Italian. In fact, over the album's duration and some time thereafter, I don't feel the need to pick up any of the Romance languages, or do much of anything else for that matter. Instead, for a few brief moments, simply sitting and listening seems pretty great all by itself. Bradell, in his own subtly inimitable fashion, has created here an exceptionally personal album, though not in a particularly ""revelatory"" sense. Rather, this is an album most easily enjoyed in quiet solitude, as an entity all its own. Since becoming one of the original South London Ninja masters in 1995, Bradell's take on classic ambient downbeat has fallen in step with that of labelmates Amon Tobin and Coldcut, but now the emphasis is sharply on ""ambient."" Heavily treated vocal samples are the sounds of the outside world slipping away, or trying in vain to intrude into this almost accidentally cool dream state. There's still a fair share of jazz-infused breaks hiding out in the sweetly atonal fog, but they never arrive without warning or stay long enough to get the blood up; the last thing Bradell wants to do is quicken a pulse. Nevertheless, Fast Asleep isn't nearly as soporific as the title would imply, creating the sensation of a restful state somewhere in the nebulous territory between sleep and wakefulness. Even though his loungy breakbeats have been relaxed, the trip-hop technician that produced the genre marker Hed Phone Sex hasn't disappeared. Now song structures drift in and out like afterthoughts or mild hallucinations, dissolving back to component particles rather than merely concluding. It's actually difficult not to feel very slightly disappointed when the more impressive compositions, from the slithering, Tobin-esque vibe of ""50,000 Ft. Freefall"" to the crystalline breaks of ""Weow"", simply disappear into the ambiance, or are resculpted into the next track. The continuous morphing from point to point doesn't allow real closure, but still reinforces the flow of the album as a single, massive arrangement, which is the whole idea anyway. A few of these tunes are fully realized animals, though, like the astonishing centerpiece, ""The Great Drive-By"", which throws some question on the effectiveness of this album-centric release. Deep, dark currents of near-tuneless noise are instant reminders of a Boards of Canada arrangement along the lines of ""Everything You Do Is a Balloon"" or ""The Beach at Redpoint"", right down to the slow-motion breakbeat. Alternately uplifting and unnerving, ""Drive-By"" is a brilliant testament to what Bradell can do when he focuses on crafting a single track (instead of an entire album) from start to finish. Like every other song on Fast Asleep, it's slick and evocative, but, unlike many of the others, it's also more capable of supporting itself while bolstering the album as a whole. So, is it really necessary that an impressive monument to relaxation like this also be comprised of impressive individual songs, even when it works so well as a unit? Well, no, but if the excellence of ""Drive-By"" is any indication, it couldn't hurt.","Marco di Dominicis is fluent in Italian; I am, to date, not.

Magnolia Electric Co.,Songs: Ohia,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b4ea9e61561daa4f81/1:1/w_160/5e910413.jpg,2003-03-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7333-magnolia-electric-co/,Secretly Canadian,"Songs: Ohia fans, consider this a test of faith. The unstable, minor-key discomfort of Ghost Tropic is long gone, and for the first time, Will Oldham comparisons will be shelved by critics in favor of, god forbid, Bob Seger. The wailing, desperate spirits that plagued Jason Molina through his earlier albums have been banished, mostly; others have come to help him light candles against the darkness, and now ""something's got to change."" So he's left the quiet sorrow of Didn't It Rain sucking the diesel fumes of 70s roots-rock by the shoulder of a lonely stretch of highway, consciously emulating his ancestors in a long line of working-class heroes. No matter what you might think of Seger (and pretty much anything would be justified), or the earthy bombast of the time, such simple honesty as Molina's is always in style, and the results are rarely less than excellent. It may simply be the natural progression from the slightly fuller sound of Didn't It Rain, but the overt desire to move on preoccupies Molina. If the last album was a lamentation on finding home in Chicago and the sheer inertia of blue-collar hand-to-mouth, then Magnolia Electric Co. is about finding the strength to move, to grow, and to leave it all behind. ""While you've been busy crying about my past mistakes/ I've been busy tryin' to make a change/ And now I've made a change,"" is Molina's righteous cry in the early moments of ""I've Been Riding with the Ghost""; it's this bittersweet sentiment that forms the lingering heart of this album. But then, with the unearthly call of steel pedal strings and the line, ""See, I ain't gettin' better/ I'm only gettin' behind,"" the motivation for this need to pick up stakes becomes evident. It's beyond just a noble determination not to succumb to the stagnation of poverty or routine, and when the first hints of an underlying fear crack the façade, the effect transcends the allegorical simplicity of gallant idealism to something far more moving, something almost indescribably human. These themes are echoed even more poignantly on the title-says-it-all opener ""Farewell Transmission"", perhaps the most powerful Songs: Ohia tune yet: ""I will try/ No one ever really tries/ I will be gone/ But not forever."" This stirring mix of melancholy and hope which Molina consistently finds in his lyrics is swelled to epic levels by the driving alt-country pride and a painfully plaintive refrain. Molina's fixation on the symbolic romanticism of the moon and the darkness might be predictable, but it continues to impress as he segues from heartaching confessional to oblique metaphor in a single breath. When Magnolia Electric Co. hits its stride in tracks like these, and others like ""Almost Was Good Enough"", it soars over Molina's previous work, but it's not an unqualified success. First, although the rotating lineup of Songs: Ohia players recasts familiar faces Jennie Benford as Backing Vocal #1 and the Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma musicians as The Band, Molina's brought along Lawrence Peters and Scout Niblett as Guest Vocalists #1 and #2, respectively, and he turns the reins over to them on ""The Old Black Hen"" and ""Peoria Lunch Box"", to decidedly mixed results. Neither singer seems to connect with the written material, leading to slightly flattened deliveries of what might otherwise have been breathtaking in Molina's broken drawl. Niblett does all right for herself, still managing to infuse ""Lunch Box"" with a sort of haunting (if off-key) resignation, but Peters is more problematic. His fatherly, Haggard croon is a little more upbeat than the subject matter, and he sounds an awful lot like someone who should be saving his tears in the beer bottles he keeps in the back of his burnt-out pickup (with his dog) while he drives down dusty country roads, and the thunder rolls, and the lightning... whatever. Depending on one's tolerance for that hardcore country-soaked vibe, he's either extremely impressive or just awful. But either way, he's not Molina, whose voice you bought this disc to hear. Aside from that, the music doesn't always support the strength of Molina's words, especially in the gratuitously stormy ""John Henry Split My Heart"", but that's less a shot at the compositions than a testament to the wrenching sincerity of the lyrics. It takes a colossal effort to back Molina's candor, and given what a departure this record is for the band, it's not surprising that some of the songs get bogged down here and there. It's also not much of a problem; in the end, the more obviously misguided moments will be long forgotten, left in the roadside dust. Magnolia Electric Co. is the sound of change. It may be uncertain whether this is the journey of a man moving towards what he wants to become, or away from what he has been, but it's a great ride regardless.","Songs: Ohia fans, consider this a test of faith.

The Inhuman Condition EP,Sam Roberts,by: Matthew Stephens,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28813d19756521388c8/1:1/w_160/353ef435.jpg,2003-03-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6803-the-inhuman-condition-ep/,Interscope,"It is a magnificent if woefully rare treat to hear a record that begins with two songs as startlingly different as ""Don't Walk Away Eileen"" and ""Brother Down"". The former, an endlessly endearing Who-styled garage send-up is first rate, sing-along rock and roll, performed with the kind of fervor that will have you unwittingly air drumming on your lap before you know it. The latter is a conversely sedate, street poet acoustic jam, set to a remarkable, insightful set of Dylan musings. Together they form an obvious microcosm of The Inhuman Condition, a hugely promising debut EP from Montreal's clearly uninhibited Sam Robert. This suave twenty-six year-old singer/songwriter has enjoyed surprise success on Canadian radio with both of the aforementioned cuts, and might soon be treading water in his own hype. For the time being, though, The Inhuman Condition remains an unusually assured first outing, one that-- while far from being another Odelay-- paints the picture of a young artist adamantly refusing to be pigeonholed. The bases covered in a mere twenty three minutes are impressive; whether it be mixing the aggression of ""Don't Walk Away Eileen"" with a touch of rockabilly on ""When Everything Was Alright"", or adding an almost psychedelic climax to ""Where Have All the Good People Gone?"", Roberts-- even at this early stage of the game-- has his mind all over the map, giving him a wealth of options for the future. Perhaps the best part of The Inhuman Condition is the level of cohesion it manages despite its diversity; Roberts has developed his music enough to give it an identity, which will certainly be his greatest asset when it comes time to record a debut full length. Well short of perfect, The Inhuman Condition loses steam on its last two songs: the droning chant ""My Love is Freeing"", while it features a soothing overdubbed vocal, gets a little tedious, and the country-Stones closer ""This is How I Live"" is far too tongue-in-cheek to be taken seriously. Fruitless, learning forays like this will no doubt wind up shelved if Universal opts to record a full-fledged major label debut based on his recent North-of-American attention. As it stands, Roberts says enough in the six songs here, but leaves countless avenues to expand his already broad range of sound. A follow-up with a little more cohesion and consistency would be nice, but The Inhuman Condition is nevertheless a sturdy, respectable and, intermittently, even thrilling first effort from an artist who has much to say, and the exceptional talent to say it in such a short length of time.","It is a magnificent if woefully rare treat to hear a record that begins with two songs as startlingly different ...

The Instigator,Rhett Miller,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c531c0084474cd0c36be/1:1/w_160/e38c5b14.jpg,2003-03-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5290-the-instigator/,Elektra,"""In a way I've been working on this record for years. Don't get me wrong, these are all brand new songs, but I've been imagining this album, playing different versions of it in my head for a long time."" Rhett Miller's awfully talkative (and refreshingly down-to-Earth) about his new solo album-- technically his second, after Mythologies, a disc of his early, folky recordings-- but I think it's that quote right there that sums up what you can expect from this record. There's a studied, careful feel to The Instigator, a feel that seems to coat about eighty percent of solo records by bandleaders; it's hard to put into words, but easy to hear. It could have something to do with the lack of a group dynamic that comes with the territory-- when he's playing with the Old 97's, Miller and the band tend to let themselves come unhinged more often, as the experience of playing together all the time allows for a certain individual freedom within the group. Their ""Time Bomb"" is one of the most electrifying singles ever to have the label ""No Depression"" slapped on it, and it's largely because you can feel them letting go of the reins and going for broke. Even with certified monsters like Jim Keltner in your backing band, it's hard to recreate that kind of energy on sessions with a pieced-together ensemble. To wit, the album's opener is a fantastic song, but you can't help thinking that in the hands of the Old 97's it would have been just a little more commanding. Miller wrote ""Our Love"" after reading the collected love letters of two historical figures to their respective, married lovers: Richard Wagner and Franz Kafka. The subject matter is unexpectedly successful and universal, and his quips about Wagner ""working on a thing that when he finished took almost seven hours to sing"" are clever enough to elicit a pretty broad grin, but the music backing it is standard-issue rock-country, in that order. Elsewhere, ""This Is What I Do"" manages to put some power in its pop, largely on account of Miller's excellent melody and producer John Brion's (Aimee Mann, Elliot Smith) neatly harmonized guitar parts. The album hits a pretty good stride in the middle, where we find Miller consciously trying playing up his pop leaning: ""Come Around"" has a chorus titanic enough to stay afloat after any kind of collision, while ""Things That Disappear"" offers ""bah bah"" backing vocals and radio-friendly production. The two best songs hit right in a row, the excellent ""Point Shirley""-- featuring Robyn Hitchcock on backing vocals and guitar-- leading the way. In addition to Hitchcock's characteristic jangle, the song has an undeniable rhythmic sway and lopsided delivery that put its head and shoulders a few inches above everything else on the album; ""Four-Eyed Girl"", a delicious little slice of geeky romance full of rhythmic piano and drifting guitar hooks, leans further toward the center of the dial, sure to fix your Marshall Crenshaw jones. The sun-drenched pop of ""Hover"" and the rockabilly of ""the El"" (as in Chicago's ""El"" trains) keep things riding high, but the album suffers a curious collapse moving into its final quarter, with three limp songs in a row. ""Your Nervous Heart"" practically lets you hear the drummer snoring as he creeps along with a lugubrious beat, and even Miller's reliable pen doesn't seem quite up to the task. ""I Want to Live"" is the hardest-rocking thing here, but it wound up with the worst hook in the bunch; ""Terrible Vision"" closes things out with a strange coda, but nevertheless unsatisfying and unsettled. Miller offers more than enough quality material here to justify stepping out on his own: what he's occasionally lacking in energy, he largely makes up for with craft, and Brion is smart enough to put the emphasis on Miller's writing with his crystal clear production. That said, it's unlikely to instigate much beyond some afternoon head-nodding, and even some of Miller's fans will be somewhat put off by the album's borderline MOR sound. The Instigator is a fun diversion, but I'm looking forward to seeing Miller back in his natural habitat: the Old 97's.","""In a way I've been working on this record for years.

Unrest,Erlend Øye,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2d13d197565213b00a/1:1/w_160/268d6c68.gif,2003-03-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6078-unrest/,Astralwerks,"When you think of a diva, probably the last person that comes to mind is Erlend Øye. In terms of physical dimensions, the featherweight, Poindexter-glasses Øye looks more like a guy that would help you out with your calculus than the kind of person who would get people on the floor. Work experience? Øye made his name with the Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience, an outfit bookish enough to title an album Quiet Is the New Loud without gagging over their own preciousness. They're not exactly Fischerspooner where image is concerned. And yet, the Kings have already tipped their hand about their secret predilection for the electronic world, having released the remix album Vs. last year with work from the likes of Rökysopp and Four Tet. Now, Øye's decided to take the complete binary plunge-- he'll Garfunkel no more! Collaborating with a slew of laptop jockeys from around the world on each artist's home turf, Øye's strung together an LP that's all about the disco. For an album where each track is under new management from the one before it, Unrest remains remarkably consistent in tone and quality. It helps that all of Øye's collaborators, no matter the pedigree, leave the avant-garde leanings at home for fairly straightforward electro-pop atmospheres wrapped rather conventionally around what I assume were pre-prepared verse/chorus/verse Øye originals. Here, frontiersmen like Prefuse 73 and Schneider TM prove themselves equally capable of applying their arsenal to a more direct sound (Schneider TM, in particular, have some previous experience from their 2002 album Zoomer) as they are to working in abstract territories. However, the more immediately appealing songs are by artists already hip-deep in Italo-disco or house. Morgan Geist kicks off the proceedings with an understated, moody synth bonanza on ""Ghost Trains,"" then is narrowly outdone by the livelier hydraulic-hiss percussion and swoop-strings of his fellow Americans in electro band Soviet, who are not afraid to make ""Sheltered Life"" bounce beneath Øye's croon. But like most things these days, Sweden takes the opening trio of tunes, representative Kompis shellacking ""Sudden Rush"" with a subtle lite-rock sheen and a perfect head-bob bassline. Compared to these easy-swallow tablets, the more heady work of the marquee acts take a bit more time to sink in. Prefuse 73's ""Every Party"" throws Øye onto a set of Scott Herren's trademark Nordictrack-glide beats to make the song stand out from the tighter house beats of its neighbors, but also never reaches the peaks of the more trad-club jams. Schneider TM, on the other hand, brings the affair to a new level without sacrificing the song format, irregular drums and sudden clumps of notes still coming together to appropriately swoon under the ""my baby"" romantic choruses of ""Like Gold"". But let's not commit the sin of forgetting young Mr. Øye just because it's annoying to keep inserting that ""Ø"" symbol-- he's playing conductor through all this jazz, and he does it skillfully. Whereas his decidedly non-dramatic voice might sound like a limitation in this kind of setting on paper, his cool delivery is run through with just enough melody to be more hummable (see: ""The Talk"") than the ironic detachment that sometimes brings down this genre. Quietly assured, he recalls no one so much as the Notwist's Markus Acher, another fish-out-of-water finding a new home amongst the whirring machines. Thus, despite sagging a bit in the middle, Unrest skillfully skirts the myriad ways this kind of variety project could go wrong. The main failing I'd peg is a disappointing tendency to be overly retro-based, all too focused on Stevie Wonder keyboards and the days of asymmetric hair. With indie rock and dance music showing indications that they might be merging onto the same highway somewhere in the near future, it's time to tone down the recycling and start applying the innovations of IDM to this ungodly, and possibly thrilling, hybrid. While only Schneider TM seems fully up to that promise on Unrest, it still stands by Enon and The Postal Service as another important signpost on the way to new pixilated horizons.

For most listeners, it was the funniest thing that had ever happened to them. The comedy of Radio Free Oz didn't flow like a river; it evolved like a living organism, spinning off random bits and pieces but always keeping its own bizarre, internal coherence. When the first of many albums the group recorded as The Firesign Theatre came out in 1968, new records were set for sustained stoned giggling worldwide. But even before smoking all that grass, it was almost impossible to describe their appeal. Which is not to say they were without influences. Their freeform montage format drew heavily on pre-war radio drama and the emerging late-nite UHF spectrum. Their bits were built around ordinary things like RVs, game shows, channel surfing and fried chicken. And they were full of a kind of cock-eyed mock-patriotism that allowed them to take cheap shots on their favorite malignant superpower without really making any serious political statement. Hearing their lengthy streams of altered consciousness was like watching the Marx brothers do a James Joyce impression; in a lot of ways, they prepared the world for Monty Python. And their stuffed-shirt straight men were always really, really straight, which was doubly funny if you were high. And, back then, you were. From the tender age of three, I was weaned on Firesign albums with titles like Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him and Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers. What first struck me was the texture of the old-time radio dramas they spoofed: the distorted and insipid orchestral themes, the nasal and oblivious announcers, the squinting sleuths, snake-oil salesmen, and ingénues-- and that hiss and crackle that made it all seem so present. Then, I started to latch on to little bits of language, whose total freedom from context didn't perturb me in the slightest-- like the moment when a confused straight-man asks the patriotic chorus, ""Who am us, anyway?"" and they reply, ""We're one of you!"" But it was the hints of satire that kept me listening, as I started to sense a certain distance between what was being said and what any reasonable person could possibly mean, such as when a faithful choir sings, ""Oh blinding light/ Oh light that blinds/ I cannot see/ Look out for me!"" Of course now, hearing one of the early broadcasts where the Lone Ranger ducks behind a rock to smoke a doob with Tonto, or hearing a children's how-to record outlining the ""four basic methods of acquiring marijuana: buying it, growing it, receiving it as a gift, and stealing it,"" I can't help but wonder what my parents were thinking exposing me to this stuff at such a young age. Right on, mom and dad. The guys have stuck together, pursuing side projects but releasing material of varying quality on and off since the 60s, and most of it doesn't suck. In fact, their 1998 album Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death, an uncanny look at a top 40 radio station on the brink of apocalypse, is quite good. But they're not exactly a laugh riot anymore. I remember a big reunion show in Berkeley about ten years ago, which was bearable because they were willing to repeat the old shtick like ""Nick Danger: Third Eye"" and ""Beat the Reaper"" to please the aging crowd. But when they try... Okay, hold on, hold on. I've gotten this far without so much as mentioning the new album, All Things Firesign, a collection of clips that aired on NPR in the last year or so. I don't want to mention it, because the whole thing-- starting with the stupid title and ending with a stupid, stupid sketch called ""A St. Nick Dangerous Christmas Eve""-- was so difficult to get through that I don't feel right judging it. But I will: It sucks. In a fit of political fervor spurred by 9/11, it seems, Firesign signed on for the occasional radio ""column"" on All Things Considered. In these forced five-minute segments, the boys are always on-topic, flashing their liberal credentials and filling their quota of laboriously up-to-the-minute political references. All traces of the old unhinged wit have been crushed in order to make the segments topical in the worst possible way. To make things even worse, the group's stale insight and crappy wordplay are launched into the territory of genuine unlistenability by the very relentless pacing that once made them great. The end result is a lot like trying to read The Nation on nitrous oxide: Certainly not instructive, and quite possibly not bearable. Now it's possible I don't have the proper historical distance, or that current events are too serious to merit the usual surreal treatment. But the problem became clearer when in the middle of an awful segment one of them yelled out of the blue: ""Don't forget, comedy is heavier than gravity!"" Even they know their new material is falling flat. If they ever stop suffocating under the burden of earnest commentary, I might start listening again.","In the fall of 1966, four guys from L.A. calling themselves Radio Free Oz broadcast a manic three-hour\n ...

Let It Rest,Sorry About Dresden,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4cfea9e61561daa4fcd/1:1/w_160/97893820.jpg,2003-03-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7359-let-it-rest/,Saddle Creek,"Let It Rest, Chapel Hill quartet Sorry About Dresden's second full-length album begins promisingly with ""Beds and Lawns,"" a CCR screamer that drifts around a four-second, ozone-piercing guitar screech, evoking endless southern pastures and balls-to-the-wall guitar rock. But sustaining such beauty is a mug's game reserved for the effortlessly genius, and Sorry About Dresden, no matter how adept they may be at strumming and pounding their instruments, fall victim to gravity immediately after coming down for this promising high. What makes ""Beds and Lawns"" most successful is its bridge, a melody that I swear shows up in close to one-half of the heartbreak new wave I heard as a kid. Something along the lines of stopping the world and melting with a person you really, really like. Sorry About Dresden are hardly new wave, which makes that mental connection all the more striking; in a way, they represent a kind of rock pastiche, in which the sources are plentiful and beg to be identified, but are tweaked enough from their original contexts that each remains too difficult to properly label and file away. Still, my first inclination while listening to Let It Rest was to adapt myself to the task of some musical archivist, to properly identity the objects and carry them back to my writer's nest. And I'll say this: Wracking my brain for the names of a million blurred faces I saw open for Superchunk ten years ago, this was the one time I envied overtanned Sugar Ray vocalist Mark McGrath, because apparently, he kills at Rock-n-Roll Jeopardy. I eventually came to realize three things: there are moments that remind me vaguely of The Psychedelic Furs; some choruses join the hundreds of drunken refrains stolen from The Replacements; and singer Matt Oberst's vocal pacing, on occasion, reeks of Elvis Costello with post-nasal drip. Oberst's voice has a youthful gruffness, like a teenager who smokes too much: not quite world-weary, but scratchy and maligned enough to convey emotions beyond his years. Let me relate a quick analogy: The other day I was walking down East 61st in midtown Manhattan, during a very icy snowstorm, when I heard a bird singing in a bald tree. I stopped and looked for it, trying to establish a defining characteristic within the otherwise monotonous white landscape: a tiny, distinct fragment deserving my attention. There's nothing on Let It Rest so inviting, and I find that surprising for a band that's been around a few years and earned a slot on a small but well-known independent label. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised by SAD's mediocrity, or the begging acronym their name makes for. With such a renown brother, we know Matt Oberst didn't have a long road to hoe, but looking at Mike Kinsella's Owen and American Football material, you can't let that slide. Sorry About Dresden are a weak opening act in a circuit filled with superior headliners, a band lacking any distinguishing characteristics in the oversaturated world of mid-tempo anglophile pop.","Let It Rest, Chapel Hill quartet Sorry About Dresden's second full-length album begins promisingly with ""Beds and Lawns,"" a ...

Shakestation,Super Madrigal Brothers,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d09d034d5c69bf33ae/1:1/w_160/22d16099.gif,2003-03-11 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7612-shakestation/,American Patchwork,"It's 1538, your parents just left the castle for the night, and you're bored as all hell. Some Joust on the old Atari? Cartridge busted. Then maybe it's time to throw on the new Super Madrigal Brothers album: Real Renaissance music played by a deranged company of vintage video game systems. Wailing Gameboys mourn the loss of their queen in a sorrowful choir of triangle waves, chivalrous joysticks court a fair Apple IIc with baroque blorps and bleeps; early Nintendo cartridges mount and prepare for righteous, quantized battle against Sega's Master System armada. Why does it all seem so damn congruous? Young Oliver Cobol and Sir Fashion Flesh hadn't met face-to-face until a week before they took Shakestation on tour. Introduced by a common collaborator (American Patchwork founder Momus, whose fake-folk irony is fully evident on this effort), the duo produced their album by swapping files and instant messaging. First, they get inside each song and play it like a video game, yielding a shimmering once-through complete with a silly perc track. Then, with a long and wacky remix, the same song is ripped to pieces. If the straight take is a game level as it's meant to be played, then its remix is that same level played by your palsied kid brother on a melted cartridge with an erratic power supply. Its pristine veneer is subjected to a series of cruel cuts and modulations, wild loops and inversions, and sometimes an outright invasion of foreign tones or samples. This is like constructing a dollhouse by hand in order to experiment on it with your own private arsenal of natural disasters-- a ridiculous enterprise, but potentially a revealing one. Put another way, when Barney the Purple Dinosaur goes through the wood chipper, you see not only scraps of his costume, but slices of the man inside. Likewise, in destroying the total artifice of these straitjacketed renditions, the remixes sometimes bring out a lilting, modern feel that the straight versions had concealed. For instance, the remix of ""Gagliardia Venezia"" takes a bland instrumental piece and vice-grips it in a giant George Foreman Grill of the mind. The result smothers you with analog resonance, spatters digital clip all over you, and melts in your skull, not in your ears. Make no mistake, inhabiting the sound world of Shakestation for a whole 75 minutes is a truly grating experience. I understand that limited range, uniform tone colors, and plastic beats are all part of the game, but the childish, almost autistic glee that makes the whole project so pleasurable is also its biggest flaw. This music seems to truly ignore the human life on the receiving end, and forces you to approach it on Nintendo terms: Space is preplanned and one-directional, time is exact and exacting-- except you have no character to control. Like watching someone play video games, it only stays fun if you're high. Though their website claims they're gallant time-travelers currently residing in Elizabethan England, it's clear that the Brothers' first priority is to plunder the great machines of the recent past. In other words, they're looking for obsolete songs to hang their cool video games sounds on. But why Renaissance music? Well, that's an open question. Certainly not because they're trying to understand it on its own terms-- that's clear from the stilted phrasing and the almost total absence of polyphony. When it comes to tone color, there's a certain match: A melody written to exploit the nasal timbre of a sackbutt or krumhorn sounds pretty good on a square wave. Or maybe the Brothers understand that early music evolved as an elite hobby, just like video games, and are trying to exploit this parallel. Nah. Could it be that their self-imposed technical limitations give them a sense of solidarity with the Renaissance composers they cover? Without access to the brute force or layered textures of a symphony orchestra, these composers had to make do with a musical language that worked for small groups of strings and voices, so they interwove melodies to create a fantastic sense of line and motion. Likewise, video games haven't always come with their own box set soundtracks. Early Ataris had no background music whatsoever (they barely had sound effects!) and Nintendo composers had very strict memory requirements to meet. These technical restrictions actually made for some great work, which is easy to forget when you hear the latest techno remix of Tetris, or the latest philharmonic recording of Vivaldi, for that matter. But Shakestation succeeds when it sticks to an old rap axiom, which states that the classics shouldn't be revived as naïve covers or dancefloor soup-ups, but mercilessly mined, twisted, and mixed together again.","It's 1538, your parents just left the castle for the night, and you're bored as all hell.

The New Folk Implosion,The Folk Implosion,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdeeea9e61561daa77ec/1:1/w_160/39412ed4.jpg,2003-03-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3140-the-new-folk-implosion/,iMusic,"Guys, could I have a minute to talk with Lou in private? Nice, thanks; I'll get to The New Folk Implosion in a moment. Alright, Mr. Barlow, I think we're alone now. So, I'm just speaking for myself here, but do you know what I liked best about your work with Sebadoh, way back before you started Folk Imploding on the side? I'm not talking about Gaffney's or Lowenstein's noise work-- just your stuff. It wasn't the sleepy bedroom hiss, and it wasn't any of the plaintive sad-pop gems you turned out; it was the obvious sincerity, the desire behind the music. Fuck analog-- you could've recorded III and Bakesale with an abacus and the only thing that would've still come through would have been the fact that you were making music for you, and no one else. Why did that have to change? There's a guy, used to hang around with The Residents, by the name of N. Senada; maybe you've heard of him. Even though it was probably just another one of those Residents gimmicks, he came up with this ""Theory of Obscurity""; an artist does his or her best work when they never expect anyone else to experience it-- in other words, when they aren't working for an audience. Lou, you are the living, breathing proof of this theory, and I just can't help but think you've been looking for another ""Natural One"" since 1997, something else to fill the gap where radioland success used to reside, and everything has suffered for it. It's like all of a sudden you realized that we've been listening in on you. I mean, big deal, what industry seer could have foretold the success of that slowest of slow-burners, that slinky, understated temptation? More importantly, who cares? So you won the hearts of thousands for a while; so Interscope picked you up just long enough to drop you after One Part Lullaby failed to deliver a hit single. Like you're a Musician now? The capital M only leads to trouble, m'man; the music should be an end all its own. If I may be so bold, fuck us. We suck; all audiences do is stab you in the back the minute you let them down. It's always the same with us-- ""What have you done for me lately?"" In the end, the only thing we, the eminently fickle public, love more than building up heroes is tearing them back down. Who needs that? Leave stardom to soulless automatons like Justin Timberlake and mass iMedia crossover icon DMX; you're a human boy. As I understand it, being dismissed from Interscope took quite a toll, but you should just be glad that you got out with life and limb intact. As for the latest, The New Folk Implosion, you may say, ""I'm doing this for myself. It's an expression of something I did with my friends,"" but-- I know the work you've done for yourself. I know it well. And this record was made with an audience in mind. So, if you're out there, Mr. Barlow, you don't need us, never did; you were doing great on your own. All right, c'mon back in the room. The issue (finally, I know) at hand is The New Folk Implosion. Some things have changed since last we left our players at the unimpressive end of Lullaby; John Davis called it quits back in '01, and Lou lined up guitarist Imaad Wasif and even convinced drummer Russ Pollard (of Sebadoh lore) to put in an appearance. Gone with Davis are most of the trip-hop trappings, leaving the band to revert to something akin to the morose, jangly, guitar-driven roots of, yes, Sebadoh. The 'Scope wasn't buying the new sound, as you know, and so the wayward trio found a new home at iMusic. To recap: new label, new lineup, new sound; hence, The New Folk Implosion. The one thing that hasn't changed, unfortunately, is the quest for acceptance. A seemingly reactionary statement to the failure of the more exotic, and far better, Lullaby, the band's new sound is nothing short of painfully, achingly banal. It goes to ridiculous lengths to avoid the risk of turning anyone away, and in doing so, becomes so unassuming-- so innocuous it might as well be invisible. Everything here is half-realized; the uniform tempos and quaint melodies are easily forgotten. Occasionally, The New Folk Implosion flirts with sensitive grunge ballads (""Coral"", ""Brand New Skin"") and awkward, shambling alt-rockers (""Fuse"", replete with Neil Young-inspired guitars blazing), but it never pans out-- the rock dynamics the band attempts to explore just don't mesh with Barlow's strengths as a songwriter. The only time the album really comes into its own-- and this should surprise no one-- is when the mainstream rock posturing comes down to reveal the quieter moments of the record. ""Pearl"" is exactly what the name implies: a simple, beautiful acoustic gem in the rough, entirely displaced among the power chords and middling hooks that dominate the rest of the album. It's a sunset over the love of two people soon to be very far apart for a very long time, accompanied by a delicate, loping refrain and a few moments of sparkling piano; easily one of the most sensitive tunes Lou's ever penned. Aside from that brief reprieve, the only other really redeeming track is ""Easy"", a soft-spoken tune that merely serves to remind listeners how naturally these melancholy, personal ruminations come to Barlow, and implicitly, how unnatural the rest of the album is in contrast. The New Folk Implosion closes out with, thankfully, a little bit of dignity, hearkening back to the laidback wonder of mid-period Sebadoh, though it still flinches from the comparison, begging the unpleasant question of why there isn't more of the old magic. Well, as Lou sings on ""Easy"", in perhaps the most telling moment of this record, ""What I thought was fun isn't fun anymore."" But then, working for the satisfaction of others before oneself rarely is.","Guys, could I have a minute to talk with Lou in private? Nice, thanks; I'll get to The New ...

Transformer,Lou Reed,by: Matthew Stephens,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23cc0084474cd0bffcc/1:1/w_160/259de20d.jpg,2003-03-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6731-transformer/,RCARCA,"Being Lou Reed in 1972 was a raw deal: two years after walking away from one of the greatest and most influential bands in rock history, he found himself a penniless, strung-out wreck, with a career suddenly and seriously on the wane. To make matters worse, his self-titled solo debut, released earlier that year, was a monumental flop, a hastily thrown together collection of second rate re-recordings of Velvet Underground outtakes that lacked the intensity and focus of his earlier music. Reed was at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to take his newfound independence. At the same time, a new trend was emerging across the pond. Glam rock began to flower in 1971, and by the following year had swept up countless British kids, turning them from restless, discontended youths to consummate, androgynous hipsters decked out in platforms, sequins and imposing hair. It was the first mainstream rock movement to openly acknowledge the Velvets' influence, and in Marc Bolan, Ian Hunter and Bryan Ferry, Reed began to see his protégés: the coarse, primal rock 'n' roll he pioneered had found its audience. One of his progeny, a young David Bowie, was hot off the success of his chart-topping The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, and was perhaps the most vociferous in his love of the Velvets and the incalculable influence they'd had on his music. When given the chance, Bowie and guitarist Mick Ronson offered to produce Reed's solo follow-up: what followed was undeniably one of both glam rock's and Reed's finest moments, one that gave him a left-field radio hit and a blueprint for much of his solo work to follow. Thirty years on, Transformer still sounds startlingly fresh, free from many of the clichés that taint other similarly minded records of the period. It also works as an interesting diversion from most of VU's work: where they clearly had a full-band aesthetic, and often leaned toward the avant-garde, Transformer took the strong pop undercurrent that ran throughout their records and indulged. It's still fascinating to hear Reed outside the messy underproduction of the Velvets, yet even with Bowie and Ronson broadening the arrangements, Transformer feels remarkably natural. Their production work was so loaded that, were it not for the incredibly focused songs beneath, it might have been overbearing. But with a solid base, the ornate arrangements help bring these songs to life, lending Reed's music a broader palette. Lou himself, by contrast, sounds as intimate as ever on the record's more sedate tracks, crooning in a sensitive lilt that maintains his blissful, effortless cool. Transformer kicks off with the aptly titled ""Vicious"", a stiff, snot-nosed Godzilla of a rock song, decked out in leather and eye shadow, and drenched in the kind of punchy power chords intimately familiar to anyone owning VU's odds-and-sods compilations. Its gleefully tongue-in-cheek lyrics are among the album's highlights, with Reed's impetuous condescension beating down his subject's ego: ""When I see you walking down the street/ I step on your hands and I mangle your feet/ You're not the kind of person that I even want to meet."" Elsewhere, ""Perfect Day"" earns the distinction of being among the least characteristic songs Reed ever wrote; while its power ballad production and melody are enjoyable on their own terms, the song feels trapped under his dry vocal delivery, and falls somewhat flat as a result. ""Satellite of Love"" is still the bizarrely affecting centerpiece, serving as a poignant reminder of Reed's underrated gift for melody, which often eclipsed the signature, visceral abrasiveness he's more often recognized for. And of course, there's ""Walk on the Wild Side"", the classic tale of NYC gender-bending that garnered Reed the only real commercial airplay of his career. This new edition adds acoustic demos of ""Hangin' Round"" and ""Perfect Day"", the latter notable for a newfound emotional push in its minimalism. The remastering is nicely executed, clarifying the sound without bastardizing the occasionally dated production. This, along with the incredibly thorough liner notes and beautiful packaging make the reissue worthwhile for those who already own the record, and a must for first-timers just delving into Reed's solo work.","Being Lou Reed in 1972 was a raw deal: two years after walking away from one of the greatest and ...

Blumm as one half of the duo Sack & Blumm, partner to Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler, the go-to guy whenever Mouse on Mars wants a horn on their records. Sack & Blumm have released two full-length records together (one on Tomlab, one on the pre-Sonig Dommert/Jan St. Werner-run imprint Gefriem); F.S. Blumm made his full length solo debut in 2001 on Morr with Mondkuchen. Though he moves in electronic circles, Blumm uses more than a mouse to create his music. In fact, synthetic sounds are rare on Ankhern, his second full-length, and impressively, he plays most of the instruments himself. In both his one-man-band approach and the overall sound of the record, Blumm has a lot in common with Mice Parade. Cleanly picked electric guitar outlines the chord structure, melodic lines come care of cello, vibraphone and horns (yup, that's Sack on the brass). The compositions tend to focus on rhythm and repetition à la classical minimalism: It's music that is crisp and beautiful on its surface, easy to like immediately, with a certain staying power, but ultimately a bit difficult to fall in love with. I hate to fault a record so consistently lovely as Ankern; there's really no dip in quality among the ten tracks here, and each sounds so nice it's hard to imagine anyone not liking them, whatever their musical background. At times it reminds me of an evocative score to a first rate indie film, something like the music Hal Hartley composes for his pictures, a warm thoughtfulness made a bit pale by some unnamable ache. When the glow of Sack's trumpet swells up at the conclusion of ""Folge"", finally filling all the empty space left by Blumm's spare plucked guitar and one-note vibraphone riff, it feels like the welcome return of an old friend. ""Tal"", with its slower tempo, swaying cello, and increased spaciousness, is definitely cinematic, reminding me a bit of the Boxhead Ensemble in the way it conjures the sea. On ""Sprung"", droney sitar and accordion move in counterpoint to swirling guitar leads and hypnotic guitar patterns. Each track sounds great on first listen, and continues to please on the tenth, yet despite Ankern's positive attributes, something is missing. The music is almost too clean and orderly for me to feel any deep emotional connection to. Blumm just makes it all sound too easy: sharp melodies, well-balanced sound, and tasteful instrumentation. This is not to say that I won't hold on to Ankern and continue to enjoy it occasionally-- when the mood strikes-- just that Ankern is not the sort of record that crops up on best-of lists come year's end.","I've always known Berliner F.S.

Facts and Fictions,Alaska!,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08013d19756521383d6/1:1/w_160/a5baeef8.gif,2003-03-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/96-facts-and-fictions/,B-Girl,"The Los Angeles-based duo Alaska!-- Russell Pollard (bass, drums, and vocals) and Imaad Wasif (guitar, vocals)-- are also two thirds of The New Folk Implosion, one third of Sebadoh (Pollard), and the ex-front man of Lowercase (Wasif), but they sound more like a troupe of psych-heads from Olivia Tremor Control than Lou Barlow collaborators. On Emotions, Alaska!'s first album, the closest link to Barlow's aesthetic is the no-caps, handwritten liner notes. Emotions is slicker than Lou's Shrimper cassettes and even some of Sebadoh's Sub Pop albums, but that carefree spirit of camaraderie is similar. Though Alaska! didn't leave much of an initial impression, resonance emerged over time, clarifying details and offering seemingly endless nooks of beauty worth exploring. I felt the Incredible String Band at the beginning of ""Rust And Cyanide"", and ""Resistance"" is almost Simon and Garfunkel, though not in the horrible elevator way Kings of Convenience translated them. Pollard and Wasif's voices lock together almost perfectly, like a single track doubled-up. The fade-away chorus of ""The Western Sphere"" had me imagining the duo backing away from the microphone and into some beautiful, hazy field as they breathe out the words; it's a gentle brushstroke Olivia Tremor Control use quite a bit. ""Love (To Be Your Main)"" evokes late-era Elliott Smith, sharing a similar build-up approach with ""Bled White"" and ""Baby Britain"". ""Broken"" could also be Smith, but during his Kill Rock Stars days: it has his falsetto, guitar percussion, and vocal lines resolved by shaking off the words. Though their reference points are somewhat obvious, Alaska! layer music differently than their primary predecessor. Whereas Smith bows to George Martin, Pollard and Wasif appear to be more fascinated by darker instrumentation, similar at times to the whirl of a pre-blow-out 13th Floor Elevators. The only real clunkers on Emotions are the last two tracks, ""Nightmare X"" and ""In My Time"". ""Nightmare X"" goes nowhere, weirdly reminiscent of Smog's ""Be Hit"", which Lou Barlow took a stab at on 1995's Lou Barlow Plays Waterfront; ""In My Time"" is a repetitious mess of faux bravura where Pollard and Wasif sing ""inside the nightmare of my dream"" with seemingly straight faces, evoking the ridiculous semi-illiterate solipsism of late-period Black Heart Procession and, at times, the naive guitar crackle of early Radiohead. This ""big guitar"" misstep is redolent of another awful masturbatory finish, ""Evil Keneival"", which haunts the CD-version of Lilys otherwise shimmering A Brief History of Amazing Letdowns. Whatever my minor gripes, Alaska! have constructed an impressive first album. On ""Rust and Cyanide"" the state and the band are evoked as place, person, history, and ""glorious world."" This extended metaphor reminded me of the Velvet Underground's ""Stephanie Says"", in which ""Alaska"" is a nickname and a reasoning: ""She's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska."" Weirdly, I kept hearing Reed as I listened to this, another fragment of beauty affixed to an already dreamy landscape. Perhaps Alaska! decided their work should embody the roller coaster evoked by the album's title; feelings are anything but balanced, but by making the two dourest tracks on Emotions its grand finale, they seem to feed into a general model of glorified self-loathing, as if it's too naive to escape a record on a high note. I'm definitely no optimist, but ending things with the resplendent ""Resistance"" would've been wiser: it's a stronger song that the other two, a four-minute meditation about, waking up, getting out of a town, breathing in the seasons and going back home. It gets cold and dark in Alaska, sure, but don't forget the months where there's never a sunset.","The Los Angeles-based duo Alaska!-- Russell Pollard (bass, drums, and vocals) and Imaad Wasif (guitar, vocals)-- are also two thirds ...

Hlemmur,Sigur Rós,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f89d034d5c69bf2f5a/1:1/w_160/a7276b6f.gif,2003-03-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7150-hlemmur/,Fat Cat,"What stripped Sigur Rós of their hype? When \xC1gaetis Byrjun dropped like a catatonic bliss bomb at the turn of the millennium, it was hailed as an astonishing breakthrough, an instant classic that struck a perfect chord between pastoral purity and neo-futurism. A serene, old-world simplicity echoed in its glacial disposition, inadvertently playing to our glamorized perceptions of the Icelandic dreamworld that gave birth to it, while the album's epic grandeur, overripe with fervid emotional outpouring, spoke to our excitement for a new era of infinite possibility, the refresh of beginning anew, and the triumph of having prevailed over the prophesied cataclysm of Y2K. Plus, it was great to fuck to. But somehow, when the band's new album arrived last November-- and maybe this is just me, but-- anticipation for its arrival seemed lower than expected. I mean, people were interested, right, but there didn't seem to be the same kind of palpable enthusiasm as surrounded, say, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. I've spent some time speculating as to why this might have been, and initially, I chalked it up to the extraordinary sameness of \xC1gaetis Byrjun. Though notable for possessing one of the more unique sounds of the past decade, \xC1gaetis didn't offer much in the way of variety, which presumably led to fans fearing the band would be content to offer more of the same. (They were right, by the way.) That was only half of it. I think that, deeper down, the wide-eyed optimism, innocence and cathartic joy offered by \xC1gaetis Byrjun-- as well as that of ( )-- just isn't with people like it once was. When that landmark record saw release in the first months of 2000, we were still reeling from the dot-com boom, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq habitually climbed several full percentage points each weekday, and technology was leaping at unprecedented rates; the nation's gravest concern lied with an oversexed president. Since then, a crumbling economy, terrorism, and the looming potential of WWIII have decimated our peace of mind. It's only right that the once comforting and contented Sigur Rós sound now strikes as somewhat naïve. So there could hardly be a better time for the band to shift gears, which is what they've done, to some extent, with their Hlemmur soundtrack. There are only so many changes this band could make to their music without losing their signature sound (becoming a garage-rock band isn't one of them, though if they'd refashioned themselves as a Motörhead knockoff called ""The Sigur Rós"", I think the shock would wear off pretty fast), and to their credit, they've made most of them here. Where previous outings witnessed Sigur Rós mapping out sprawling, eight-plus-minute sonatas doused in spacious reverb and Jon Thor Birgisson's choirboy lilt, Hlemmur's tracks average roughly two minutes each, sans-vocals. The songs still ring with the same dampened production that graced Agaetis Byrjun and ( ), but the band's idyllic hopefulness has been replaced with a subtle malaise, and the overall effect is rarely as sweeping as on their official full-lengths. This, of course, is likely due more to the nature of the film for which this music served as a score than to any permanent adjustment to Sigur Rós' modus operandi: Hlemmur is an independent film by director Ólafur Sveinsson, which documents the lives of the inhabitants of Reykjavik's central bus station, from which the picture takes its name. Throughout the feature, Sveinsson interviews the homeless and/or drug-addled nomads that frequent the hub while, ""with unexpected candor, they tell of the monotony of their existence, their hopelessness, addiction and misery."" At times, this draws Sigur Rós toward a sound of grandiose bleakness, not unlike that of their orchestral brethren Godspeed You Black Emperor!, though never as defiantly bombastic; other times, the band offers standard-fare Icelandic IDM, owing its warm, melodic tones and analog drones to compatriots Múm and Boards of Canada. But mostly, this is Sigur Rós without the constraints of focus and melody that drew people to them in the first place. Hlemmur consists largely of empty ambiance, intended more for setting a tone in its cinematic counterpart than for home listening. As a score, the music serves its purpose, suggesting a certain mood (if always a somewhat vague one) without drawing attention from the stories told by the station's denizens. However, once the initial interest of hearing Sigur Rós in a slightly different context wears off, the music has a similar effect in your apartment or bedroom, rarely offering a moment to wake you to its presence. These moments do come, on occasion: ""Hvalir í útrymingarhaettu"" features a dense, muddied drone topped with reversed piano chords and the highly processed and pitchshifted vocalizing of Jon Thor Birgisson for peculiar, squeaking/squawking effects, and ""\xC1fram Island"", after opening with a low-tech, preprogrammed samba beat, blossoms into a beautiful piano and xylophone prelude. But ""\xDEversögn"", while notable for its departure from the album's usual sound, doesn't fare quite as well: It once again employs that low-tech samba beat while the band offers an elementary keyboard improvisation that clearly means to be spooky, but instead ends up the desert music from Super Mario 2. Interestingly, Sigur Rós never seem fully able to immerse themselves in the pale resignation that would be more suited to this documentary; there's always a light gauze of positivism in their major-chord drones-- which might even work in their favor here, were this kind of utopian reverie not such a tired theme of their records. Fortunately, the record isn't given a chance to wear out its welcome too badly, as the band throws us yet another surprise curveball: Even at 19 tracks, Hlemmur comes out at roughly half the duration of their usual 80-minute marathons. Still, the casual Sigur Rós fan won't likely find much to love here; though Hlemmur is certainly a beautiful record, beauty only stretches so far without the substance to back it.","What stripped Sigur R\xF3s of their hype?

On the Shore,Friends of Dean Martinez,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2fabf31b7dc71560e9/1:1/w_160/a222caea.jpg,2003-03-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3202-on-the-shore/,Narnack,"Somewhere along the way, Friends of Dean Martinez left the lounge and moved in next door to the butcher shop. Along the way, they passed through A Place in the Sun, their brilliant, expansive 2000 album that ironically saw huge, dark clouds scudding over their trademark sun-scorched instrumentals. The outfit's fifth album, On the Shore, is something of an odd package, splitting two discs between (somewhat) old and new material. The first disc houses the Wichita Lineman EP, originally released in Europe on the venerable Glitterhouse label, as well as three live tracks taken from the Live at Club 2 EP (also from Glitterhouse). Disc two is essentially the new On the Shore album, but the material all comes from such similar headspace that the whole set winds up sounding very much of a piece with itself. Disc one opens with the quiet, almost comforting sound of a film projector, lulling you into a false sense of security before the aptly titled ""Overload"" blows out your windows with a sudden burst of skull-crushing fuzz bass and acid-drenched guitar, heavier than anything any reasonable person ever would've expected from these guys. The six tracks of the Lineman EP cohere like nothing else in the band's catalogue, flowing with surprising grace from the frayed blast of ""Overload"" to the spooky desert nighttime of ""Alternate Theme"", which morphs from a lazy acoustic stroll drenched in mellotron into a soup of brooding organ and sustained guitar tones, then back again, without batting an eye. The tension of one piece feeds the release of the next and vice versa: it's an incredibly natural flow. Though overarching mood is their primary strength, Friends of Dean Martinez are great at crafting little moments that make your ears perk up, like the spot where the texture shifts from inky black cymbals and muddy guitars to a clear, shuffling beat and Bill Elm's pedal steel spills out the aching melody of ""Through the Whine"". Elm's steel guitar is the band's primary voice, and he muffles the instrument's country pretenses with an approach that brings to mind David Gilmour's soul-spilling, slightly damaged lead style of decades ago. This is on heavy display on the band's live cover of ""The Tennessee Waltz"" later on the disc, where he mines the basic sadness of the original tale-- losing a lover to a friend-- to staggering effect. Patti Page never sounded so evocative in her entire life. As solid as the first disc is, the second one is obviously the main course, pushing their sound in new, more abstract directions, and unearthing the band's jazzy core. ""H-Hour Minus Five"" rises from the deep like air bubbles from a sunken submarine, Elm using everything from his steel to Theremin, piano and the Casio CZ-101 synthesizer to create the most unsettled mood possible. It's the kind of thing I'd sooner expect from a band on Alien8, and it's wholly enveloping. ""And Love to Be the Master of Hate"" hardly takes a more traditional shape with its wall of dark-hued keyboards and guitar outbursts from Mike Semple; Dave LaChance's drums roll and stomp, constantly shifting the rhythmic basis of the song to affect change in the other players. Other songs reflect the band's old Southwestern desert sound more overtly, like the swooning ""Under the Waves"" and the boiling ""Time's Not Your Friend"", where Elm's parched steel squares off against Semple's brushfire fretwork. Semple is quickly establishing himself as the most contemplative Friend of Dean, as his gorgeous composition ""Indian Summer"" sits heavy and cold like the desert night, in the middle of the disc, slathered in icy Chamberlin and skeletal guitar parts. His other contribution to the second disc, ""Cahuenga"", feels a little more like the sunrise, with Elm's organ breathing softly in the background as Semple's simple guitar parts meditate gracefully, pushed along only by a simple, steady pulse on a bass. By the time the sun's up, Friends of Dean Martinez are pretty far from where they started out years ago, before Joey Burns and John Convertino left to form Calexico and the remaining members took their tongues out of their cheeks. They've developed into a band that can effortlessly extract the beauty from emptiness, while taking you on some pretty strange detours in the process. I'll always recommend A Place in the Sun over their other albums (unless, God willing, they make a better one in the future), but On the Shore is a two disc set full of refined, potent ideas, merely less expansive than their most daunting, celebrated effort.","Somewhere along the way, Friends of Dean Martinez left the lounge and moved in next door to the butcher shop ...

Ok Go,OK Go,by: Matt Stephens,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ab13d197565213aee4/1:1/w_160/3a1e6dbb.jpg,2003-03-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5956-ok-go/,Capitol,"If there's one rock journalist cliché that bugs me, it's that relentless tendency to dwell heavily on a band's image, allowing it to supercede the importance of the music in the interest of provoking a laugh or making what is often a frivolous, irrelevant point. A great deal of bands, from the early mop-top days of The Beatles to the afro'd At the Drive-In of today, have found their otherwise wonderful and perfectly noteworthy music suffocated by the ink given to their hair, outfits or backstage antics. Conversely, painfully mediocre bands like Kiss and Cinderella find substantial, undeserved attention simply through their flashy dress codes, using their image to blanket lifeless, pedestrian songs. Needless to say, it's a tactic I usually try to avoid. And so here I try, objectively as I can, to sit through the self-titled debut of Chicago foursome Ok Go. From the outset, their look is positively loathsome; four clean-cut, Suburbia-ripped pretty boys aspiring to toe the line between indie respectability and commercial adulation. I slide the disc into my CD player, glancing briefly at the Blue-era Weezer poster on my wall which optimistically reminds me of the joy that could abound. But as the music begins, and the bland onslaught of creative ineptitude soaks my room, my mood takes a nosedive. Fact is, Ok Go seemed to have made every effort to live up to their immaculate, airbrushed image in their music. That the kind of mindless, commercial monotony that dilutes every hint of vibrancy on the record seems wholly intentional is telling, as a comparatively lo-fi collection of songs were apparently scrapped in favor of this supposedly more accessible dreck. The sort of middle-of-the-road, half power-pop/half hair-metal hooks heard on first track and single ""Get Over It"" plays itself out on nearly every track, using the monster power chords, obtusely ironic lyrics and anthemic send-up chorus as a blueprint for the kind of 21st century arena-rock most people knew we didn't need. For forty minutes, Ok Go drags on laboriously, with each passing song more desperately anticipating the end. Damian Kulash's lyrics are almost uniformly dreadful, but no more so than on ""You're So Damn Hot"", what seems to be some kind of aggravating rewrite of ""Bang a Gong"" with all the substance and style drained from it. Lines like, ""You're a bad-hearted boy trap, baby doll, but you're/ So damn hot,"" are enough to make you despise the English language. Fortunately, the album is saved from total disaster by the band's occasional ear for a good hook, and though you'll knock yourself for it, the reasonably hummable melodies of a handful of these tracks may stay with you for the rest of the day. When push comes to shove though, Ok Go is either a dreadfully calculated, shot-in-the-dark attempt at accessibility from a band whose heart is in the underground or simply a dull, styrofoam pop record from a bunch of fresh-faced hacks who happened to come across a Weezer fakebook and decided to turn it into a career. Either way, their heart doesn't seem in it, and if you're gonna win the public over, you've gotta at least fool them into thinking you mean it.","If there's one rock journalist clich\xE9 that bugs me, it's that relentless tendency to dwell heavily on ...

Sunshine Hit Me,A Band of Bees,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4609d034d5c69bf305a/1:1/w_160/6409e300.jpg,2003-03-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1125-sunshine-hit-me/,Astralwerks,"Infographic: Why do we love British music so much? Anglophilia slightly more socially acceptable than necrophilia Want to support our noble allies in the perennially impending war by funding music industry Lingering colonial Stockholm Syndrome manifesting itself in our collective musical taste Not satisfied with faux-slang from The Hipster Handbook Or maybe, just maybe it's because the UK is such a damn little fertile isle for the development of music, as evidenced by their decades-long hold on various levels of American listeners. Right now, for instance, the Union Jack is doing little business on the Billboard charts, but is being fetishized below the radar for evolution-tree offshoots like the garage scene and mashups. Have you heard of this guy called The Streets? A great deal of this Transatlantic love seems to be a result of British talent for making stylistic casserole, taking a pink eraser to the lines between genres. Which is where The Bees come in, a hard-to-categorize group that shares much of their aesthetic with Astralwerks mates The Beta Band and Simian. Ostensibly a rock band in its foundations, The Bees (known in the U.S. as A Band of Bees, due to some hott legal action) stirs in elements from a wide variety of sources, including tropicalia, dance music, and 70s soundtrack soul. It's all summed up nicely by the cover at the chewy nougat center of Sunshine Hit Me, a conservative runthrough of Os Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina"". Like those frenzied Brazilians, The Bees excel at wadding up disparate elements into a vaguely psychedelic sound containing a believable tropical flair-- despite hailing from the Isle of Wight, which grainy festival footage suggests is hardly Rio. Bear witness, for example, to ""No Trophy"", a reggae that somehow circumvents Official Pitchfork Policy of loathing that entire genre. It's the fine opener ""Punchbag"" that steals the show here, however, growing from a music box Rhodes figure into a piece of dreamy microhouse that utilizes a near-glitch bassline and glass-bottle percussion that could've been lifted from a Prefuse 73 track. Similar elements frolic through ""Angry Man"", though this time with vocals that more clearly recall Curtis Mayfield than Wayne Coyne, and rich organ adding polyester strut. As the disc plays on, though, the tempo drops, and with it the score. The second half of the disc misguidedly trades in the eccentricities of the above tracks for piano-focused atmospherics and analog chillouts, reducing the affair to competent and inoffensive (if not terribly interesting) backdrops like those of Zero 7. Whereas the Side A instrumental ""Sunshine"" nicely breaks the getting-tired Moon Safari mold with moments of loose jazz-rock jamming, the backloaded quartet of downtempo numbers that ends the album does so on a breezily hookless note. Sunshine Hit Me does, however, remain an above-average production of reasonable merit, further proof that Astralwerks seems to have cornered the market on decent, but not quite excellent rock/electronic hybrid bands with potential. To wit, The Bees show signs of having creative reserves deep enough to power a long career; whether that career will be in pushing boundaries of genre collision or scoring commercials for text messaging remains to be seen. Still, their debut album has a handful of singles suitable for airplay in that Clear Channel-free wonderland of Engerland, singles good enough to quicken the breath of those of us whose toes curl at the site of a ""UK import"" sticker.","Infographic: Why do we love British music so much?

The Power to Believe,King Crimson,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba6abf31b7dc7155b36/1:1/w_160/fd4ad8e6.jpg,2003-03-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4441-the-power-to-believe/,Sanctuary,"""The only reward the musician receives is music: The privilege of standing in the presence of music when it leans over and takes unto its confidence. As it is for the audience. In this moment everything else is irrelevant and without power. For those in music, this is the moment when life becomes unreal.""
                                                                                --Robert Fripp, 1992 For all his scholarly quips and curmudgeonly demeanor, King Crimson founder and guitarist Robert Fripp has gone to great pains to keep his feet planted firmly on the ground. Unlike some of his first-generation progressive rock peers of the late 60s and early 70s, he never allowed his band to leap into the abyss of new age fantasy or wanky tech-pomp. At all points during Crimson's many-membered lifetime, Fripp has been the model of humble workmanship: You can usually count on him to 1) hate the music business, 2) refuse to rest on his laurels, and 3) practice his guitar. It makes sense that he wouldn't expect much pleasure from record sales or a cult of fans as obsessive as they come-- after all, it's the musician's job to strive for excellence in the face of commerce and compromise. And it shouldn't bother him that during the course of his 35-year, single-minded crusade he's left himself on a desert island with only his comfortable legion of fans and bandmates to keep him company. It's been a few years since he was painting London red with Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and David Bowie, and these days Fripp mostly celebrates advanced middle age with his wife, English garden and the latest version of his storied band. Sure, his records sound more than a little like shadows (albeit of the highest quality) of his classic past efforts, but it's not as if rock history is littered with grandfatherly figures re-inventing the wheel. ""Hey man, lay off Fripp-- King Crimson is the best prog band ever!"" I know it is, I do; I really wish I could get past the irony of a progressive rock band being unable to progress. The Power to Believe is the band's 13th studio LP, and the third featuring the current lineup of Fripp, Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto. Last year, the buzz about this record was that it was going to be the result of Crimson's ear to xFC-metal, and having toured with Tool-- in fact, the working title was Nuovo Metal. Last year's Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With EP offered some preliminary tastes of this direction, as did the deluge of recent live releases, including 2001's Level Five, and the Projekcts albums. I'm happy to report that Power is much less awful than that EP, and more consistently interesting than the sprawling live CDs. That said, there is an omnipresent residue of stagnancy that has covered just about everything King Crimson have released since 1995's Thrak, and this record is no less stained. Fans of the mid-1970s lineup should find the most to enjoy on Power to Believe, as it not only finds King Crimson playing with muscular aggression similar to that period, but also revisiting the group improvisation that set them so far apart from other 70s prog bands. The title suite-- arranged in four movements; Fripp still loves the symphonic form-- begins and ends as a sort-of haiku verse penned by Belew, but the middle sections are reminiscent of the lengthy excursions from 1992's excellent Great Deceiver box set, of their 1973-74 tours. Exotic percussion (Jaime Muir, where are you?), floating Frippertronics, and fretless basslines (ahem, ""Warr guitar"") flesh out what seems like very familiar territory. It is, of course, a credit to the band that they manage to retain the adventurous spirit of past incarnations, whether or not the end result is a tad stale-- Fripp's solo on ""Part III"" is pretty cool, after all, and the driving, minimal ""Dangerous Curves"" reminds me of ""The Talking Drum"" from Larks' Tongues, right down to the repeating bassline and ending on a wall of dissonant noise. The band also throws a few bones to modern electronic music with ""Level Five"" and ""Elektronic"". The former tune is a fairly standard instrumental in the style of ""Red"", or more recently, ""Thrak""-- though not quite as ferocious as either. However, Mastelotto's drum parts are injected with occasional glitch and Aphex-style stutter, giving the groove a somewhat refreshing (at least for anyone who never heard Aphex) wrinkle. The latter tune fares better, if only because the efforts don't seem like hopeless catch-up exercises. Oh wait, yes they do, because I'm pretty sure those Prodigy beats were stale about six months into 1997. Anyway, the tunes are right on time for Crimson fans, and if you wanted to, you could easily tune out the barely there computer touches. There are moments without many redeeming qualities: The dad-joke ""Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With"" survives in full form from its self-titled EP here, and alas, is still embarrassingly out of touch. Likewise, ""Facts of Life"" features just as clueless a take on metal as the former tune, and Belew's ridiculously holier-than-thou lyrics detailing how ""some of us build, and some of us teach"" (he forgot the ones who provide public service announcements), and how ""nobody knows what happens when you die."" These things are ""fact[s] of life,"" he says. Now, if he could only throw in a verse about how ""the president thinks he's so smart, but you know what, he's not,"" we'd be set. Despite all the unfortunate narrative (which, in itself is reminiscent of most Crimson records) and quaint ""updates"" in sound, this record should please quite a few fans. Even as my brain tells me that the Crimson well is probably dry, my fist wants to pump during the breakdowns in ""Level Five"". Fact is, very few bands have a command of their own voice as well as Fripp and Crimson, and I suppose when you've been at it for so long, mastery comes with the territory. I can admit to feeling some of that old Crim magic a few times during Power to Believe, but would be kidding myself if I thought it was as potent a spell as their adventures of yore.","""The only reward the musician receives is music: The privilege of standing\n\ in the presence of music when it ...

We're sit on the verge of war, and the rest of the world fears and loathes us. A missile just flew over my house, and though my Korean's a little rusty I think the graffiti on the warhead said, ""FROM PYONGYANG WITH LOVE."" With all that going on, why not close your eyes and pretend to be somewhere peaceful, somewhere cut-off and faraway-- like Australia? With their soft, calm sound and assuringly warm vocals, Art of Fighting are determined to help you get your mellow on. This Melbourne-based band helped show Stephen Malkmus around when supporting one of his Australian tours, and now, with the American release of Wires, they're doing the same for us. Their full-length debut introduces them as a spare, dreamy slowcore band: The album is heavily reverbed but too guitar-based and concrete to be ethereal, and it's recorded with the flawless cool of a glass sculpture. The album's eleven tracks are beautifully melodic, if sometimes too homogenous. The pleasantly yearning ""Skeletons"" gives way to the faster ""Give Me Tonight"" (which weirdly resembles Leo Sayer's 70s chestnut ""When I Need You""); from there the album ebbs and flows, as a few louder songs drift among the soft ones. Singer Ollie Browne echoes the way Thom Yorke handles his most delicate ballads (think ""Fake Plastic Trees""); Browne expresses aching, shallow-breathing vulnerability while staying precisely on pitch. He doesn't give it much lungpower-- when his birthday rolls around he probably blows out three candles, four tops-- but he's ideal for this passively beautiful music. Bassist Peggy Frew later provides a break with her rougher, more earthen vocals on ""I Don't Keep a Record"". A few tracks stand out for having some tremors of drama: ""Moonlight"", co-written by Browne and his Remotes bandmate Kristian Brenchley, strikingly moves from whispers to crescendos. And the album as a whole follows a soft-to-loud-to-hushed arc, all the way through to the shoegazingly extended, just-short-of-glorious guitars on ""Something New"", which ends the album. But while Art of Fighting create a strong mood, they never completely fill it. The songwriting, while tuneful, could be tighter, and the lyrics don't help: Two lovers want to be together but they're kept apart, for some unknown reason; or they're together but it doesn't work out, for some other reason that remains unclear. It's not that Art of Fighting need punchy or witty lyrics, but the vague words, which are sometimes too thin on nouns and adjectives, make songs like ""Akula"" all the more indistinct. For some listeners this album could be too little to take: The few gripping moments are surrounded by mellow sections that drift into the background. If the band ratchets up the writing, though, they could make an album that's just as nice but far stronger-- the kind that invites you to pay close attention, but that's just as rewarding if you don't.","It's a nerve-wracking time to be in America.

"Lost Planets, Phantom Voices",Tobin Sprout,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52cb1335d7bf1698b34/1:1/w_160/9f5b5720.jpg,2003-03-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7444-lost-planets-phantom-voices/,Wigwam,"Fact: When Tobin Sprout left Guided by Voices, he took the band's heart with him. Consider how often you listen to anything post-Under the Bushes these days, if you doubt it. With Toby in the ranks, GBV had that semblance of balance necessary in all great bands, Sprout's quick interjections of bashfulness standing out like a cardigan in a biker bar amidst Robert Pollard's boozy leg-kicks. When the guitarist dropped out of the Ohio fantasy rock camp and moved to Michigan, Pollard booted the rest of his Dayton lineup, signed up ""real"" musicians, and promptly drove the GBV franchise into a tree. Meanwhile, Sprout, off in his own orbit and presumably concentrating more on his photo-realistic paintings, never stopped recording. After his odds-and-ends debut Carnival Boy pulled a surprising upset over the simultaneously released Pollard-wank Not in My Airforce, Tobin spun a bunch of lonely basement nights into the drearily touching Moonflower Plastic, before being punted by Matador. Alas, from there on out the returns have been of the diminishing sort, first taking the one-man act thing too far with the disappointing Let's Welcome the Circus People, then falling way short of olden days with his own band, Eyesinweasel. Even postally collaborating with his old drinking pal Pollard via their Airport 5 project yielded disappointment, uncomfortably welding as it did Sprout's unassuming music to Uncle Bob's blustery vocals. So I was just about running empty on enthusiasm for Tobin Sprout, but thought I'd give Lost Planets, Phantom Voices a try, for old time's sake. Pleasingly, within I found a handful of tracks stronger than anything he's produced since Moonflower Plastic-- ""Cleansing from the Storm"" a reminder of Sprout's ability to pen an anthem that nervously toes the ground rather than swaggers, ""Catch the Sun"" (ft. Jim MacPherson) a reminder how much better Sprout sounded when he turned elsewhere for the drumming. Sprout even turns in his twee ID for a lower-register warble on ""As Lovely as You"" that sounds, dare I say, Interpol-ish! (Oh, take me now, Lord.) But the majority of Lost Planets merely parades out more examples of the weaknesses in Sprout's solo catalog, first and foremost being his studio solitude. Toby, my man, I don't know how to break this to you, but you're not the greatest musician technically. Which is fine! It's fine... but in light of that, the goin'-it-alone thing just ain't working. Much of Lost Planets is marred by a kind-of midtempo sameness (""Rub Your Buddha Tummy"", ""Indian Ink""), most likely due to your intermediate drumming skills. Sprout's mid-fi recording techniques are the other major problem with his recent work, up to and including Lost Planets; the sound amplifies his technical limitations by adding little in the way of sonic character. Given Tobin's thin voice, a mix that's heavy on the upper frequencies can cause acute trebleitis, ""Let Go of My Beautiful Balloon"" and ""Earth Links"" sounding particularly washed out without a low-end anchor. Awkwardly formulaic instrumentals don't help matters, either, be it the cookie-cutter surf of ""Martini"" or the keyboard waltz of ""Fortunes Theme No. 1"" (leave it to the French, Toby). But more than anything, it's just distressing to see Sprout evolving on a parallel course with Pollard, both of them forgetting that unrehearsed energy and verse/chorus/get-the-fuck-out structures were what got them into our record collections in the first place. It's also starting to become abundantly clear that Sprout is better enjoyed as a side dish than as a main course, his first couple albums notwithstanding. It's almost certainly too late to be holding out hope that Tobin will one day reassume his position at the right hand of King Pollard's throne, but maybe, just maybe, there's a prolific schoolteacher in northern Michigan with a four-track and a drinking problem we could set him up with?","Fact: When Tobin Sprout left Guided by Voices, he took the band's heart with him.

She held a thin flashlight between her lips as she meshed together the moaning Bowie choir from side two of Low with the percussive thumps of her Warp labelmates, Boards of Canada. It was a wonderfully woozy night, and she DJed with a deft touch, moving in and out of the vinyl grooves, merging sundry vibes and keeping the headspace at a nice high. The big balls of Spanish hash making their way around the room didn't hurt things, either, heads nodding within blissful alpha states. That was years back, and I wondered what she'd been up to this whole time. Her latest effort for Warp shows she's been doing basically the same thing as she was that night, looking for the perfect dream state rather than the perfect beat. It's all about the mix, a steady shifting of textures and unobtrusive rhythmic circles that careen like spinning plates, their centers slowly wobbling, deteriorating as the next pattern begins to assimilate and congeal. Skimskitta opens with some e-bowed guitar and glitch noise, before moving into the unadorned piano and rasping breaths of ""Poussou"". The beats don't formally appear until track three, ""Woody"", and they quickly skitter and dribble away like mercury as the gongs resonate, her low-mixed voice drifting in and out of consciousness. ""The Wolf, the Sheep, & the Door"" is slightly more kinetic, conjuring up the deep drums of Haruomi Hosono's Cochin Moon while simultaneously working out the combination on a safe, ticking away, slowly immersing her vocals in a salty ocean of fizzling crackles. As it flows downstream, you become aware of far-off echoes of gamelan percussion coming from the overgrown databanks of this river, as well as the innocent tricklings of keyboards, leading slowly into the record's centerpiece, ""I May Be Over There (But My Heart is Over Here)"". Calix mixes together guitar feedback, wind chimes, and her almost untraceable voice as piano recital patterns return to awkwardly move it along. This boat doesn't go anywhere, merely floating and turning in place, but your head spins nevertheless, blissfully discombobulated. ""Paarl"" and ""Shadenfreude"" feature Mira's vocals, but once again they remain far too low in the mix, making me wonder whether she doesn't trust her voice, or is trying to make a subliminal mix-tape. The harmonium and organ accompaniment flow well with the clicking beats, but from there the album submerges into blurry, indistinct washes, as individualized tracks give way to Calix's mutability, stirring the percussion and digital debris about, never letting the bits quite settle to the bottom nor revealing her recipe. Skimskitta isn't particularly strong or potent, but it's relaxed and smooth enough to induce a very mellow, mild buzz.","Last time I saw Chantal Passamonte was in a club in Valencia, Spain.

The Original Sound of Sheffield '78-'82: The Best of...,Various Artists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c09d034d5c69bf313b/1:1/w_160/89421609.gif,2003-03-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1210-the-original-sound-of-sheffield-78-82-the-best-of/,Mute,"""This is entertainment/ This is fun."" As choked out by Stephen Mallinder, this is less of a request than a command, and the irony conveyed by his grudging, bile-coated words is plain. Art is rarely more than intent, but ""entertainment,"" let alone ""fun,"" is considerably more demanding; in either case, it takes more than speech to so self-consciously elevate an artist's toil. The rift between assertion and sensible results is wide, after all; Mallinder's grim pronouncement at the center of ""This Is Entertainment"" amounts to little more than paradox as a consequence. His words attempt to define the work but the experience says otherwise, and that dilemma is the finest part. In fact, in a similar vein to contemporaries like Throbbing Gristle and Suicide, the lifeblood of Cabaret Voltaire's body of work is conflict. Hypnotic, mechanical rhythms struggle with jarring vocal effects and disorienting tape manipulation. The stark, minimal background music refuses to remain obscured, constantly demanding a listener's full attention. The Cabs wrenched science-fiction out of stone-age tech way back in 1978, calling it, to quote Richard Kirk, ""experimental pop music,"" in a fight to escape ""the slavery of dead-end jobs, and most important, to cause trouble."" These guys pioneered the electro-industrial genre ""out of boredom""-- think about that the next time you sit down to watch Blind Date. That's it for a refresher on the work of the oft-unheralded Cabaret Voltaire; it's not the place of this review to dwell on congratulatory back-patting or debate this band's place in the pantheon of music's heroes. After all, Mute has compiled a document of their earth-shaking early work, a chronological record of development with selections spanning the band's most vital period, and it basically speaks for itself. From their first steps on the Extended Play EP through the dual Spartan masterpieces Red Mecca and 2 X 45, this is a portrait of the Sheffield trio (including master tapehead Chris Watson, prior to his departure halfway into the 2 X 45 sessions) at the darkest height of their considerable powers. It doesn't fully succeed at capturing them in the best light, but as a map of their progress, it's irreplaceable. Note the simplicity inherent in the tinny, synthetic squeak-beats of ""Do the Mussolini (Headkick)"" in contrast with the wailing back-alley sax and driving rhythm of ""Wait & Shuffle"". Compare the tense dynamic created between the erratic bass rumblings and pulsating, omnipresent whine of ""The Set-Up"" with ""Yashar""'s barely there Arabian textures. All of the material predates Cabaret Voltaire's eventual move towards dancefloor electronica shortly after Watson called it quits, and so it shares the same bleak, oppressive vibe. Nevertheless, the contrast between the band's early singles and the material from Red Mecca and 2 X 45 makes for a jarring listen. The complexity of these compositions increases in magnitude from album to album; for that reason alone, it's striking to hear the succession of tracks included. By the time it comes around to 1981, you can almost hear history taking root. The shame of it is that on some level, the home-movie-esque documentation of Cabaret Voltaire's ""gestation period""-- a number of singles, as well as samples from the first two full-lengths, Mix-Up and The Voice of America-- just can't present the best possible album. As impressive as many of these cuts are, the stepping stones to greatness aren't in the same league as the finished product. Excepting the absolute necessity of the included ""No Escape"" and ""This Is Entertainment"", a simple best-of could be culled from nothing but the strongest moments of their early 80s material. It's not severely to the detriment of The Original Sound of Sheffield to do without the numerous alternative contenders it eliminates, but there's still the unmistakable sting of a missed opportunity. At the very least, the collection presents an astonishing succession of advances; Cabaret Voltaire's music was truly ""built from nothing"" and that has rarely been as evident as it is here.","""This is entertainment/ This is fun.""

Throwing Muses,Throwing Muses,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a09d034d5c69bf3842/1:1/w_160/5fb33695.jpg,2003-03-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8046-throwing-muses/,4AD,"Does Kristin Hersh have the most terrifying voice in rock? Many singers embrace higher drama or shred their vocal cords with icier shrieks, but there's an eerie steadiness in Hersh's voice-- an enthrallment that goes deeper than the mere sound of her singing, part crow, part Wicked Witch of the West and part vengeful alternative rock icon. Of all the artists who've invoked the cliché of losing control to their inspiration, Hersh is one of the few to make it convincing; she delivers her most harrowing lyrics with a delicate serenity, and her simplest with a frightening, reeling delirium. Her voice and surreal images were the key to the success of Throwing Muses, before the group disbanded. Hersh didn't want to break up the Muses, the band she's led since high school: It ended in the mid-90s for financial, not creative reasons. And that's the only way to explain how, when some funding came through, they could reform and cut a new album that sounds like they'd never been apart. Often, critics give a veteran band extra credit when they reunite-- props that were perhaps due long ago and never offered, or just bonus points for not having dropped dead in their autumn years. I can't think of many albums that need fewer crutches than this one. Without rivaling University or The Real Ramona, it's different from, yet far rawer than, anything since their debut. Fans will suck up the nostalgia as Hersh brings back not just her last rhythm section (Bernard Georges on bass and mainstay David Narcizo on drums), but also founding Muse Tanya Donelly, who adds seraphic harmony vocals. After several years of sporadic collaborations they jumped into the project without even rehearsing: They cut the album in just three weekends with minimal overdubs, giving it a clean and ""live"" sound that sticks solidly to an unembellished power trio. There are no acoustic tracks, no slow or atmospheric ballads (like University's ""Crabtown"")-- nothing but torrential, skidding, hard rock, right from the almost anthemic first track, ""Mercury"", which cuts through different ways of opening the throttle before it wrenches into the chorus. With such a consistent sound the songs bleed into each other, but Hersh's writing is still intriguingly unpredictable. Some of the songs are catchy almost after the fact-- like the perfect riff and matter-of-fact weirdness of her delivery on ""Portia"", or the erupting chorus on ""Pretty or Not"". Others sound like they were Frankensteined together from the verse, chorus and bridge of completely different songs and smoothed out by the guitars: You've got the mood change from dark to ecstatic on ""Half Blast""-- if Donelly had written any songs here, this would be the one-- or the way ""Solar Dip"" jerks between time signatures. And that's not to ignore the grinding dirges like ""Speed and Sleep"" that just pound themselves into a dark hole. Throwing Muses skip the production polish that brightened up albums like University, but they've found the perfect sweetener in Donelly's backing vocals. As limited as her contribution may be-- she sticks to backup and only sings on half the songs-- her lines are melodically gorgeous, high and pure against Hersh's lower, somewhat raspy vocals. But her presence alone isn't what makes this so joyous. Throwing Muses are the counterpart-- or maybe the antidote-- to the driven, enraptured solitude of her solo material; they deliver a release and an excitement that's been missing from her work for years. Their reunion is heavy, driven stuff-- as inherently inexplicable as the best, darkest Muses work-- but it's also ecstatic. This band has seized an opportunity that may never strike for them again, and they're celebrating it as though there were no tomorrow.","Does Kristin Hersh have the most terrifying voice in rock?

13 Songs and a Thing,Bob Drake,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0bc0084474cd0c2754/1:1/w_160/ad53ad6e.gif,2003-03-05 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2441-13-songs-and-a-thing/,Recommended,"Musicians don't exist on desert islands, isolated from human contact, any more than other folks. This piece of (seeming) common sense sometimes gets lost in the shuffle when discussing the effects of music: It's often described in similar terms as a natural disaster-- ""it moved me""; ""the music blew me away""; ""it destroyed all my expectations"". Thus, the creators of the stuff are indirectly positioned as only semi-mortal figures, working ""magic"" with our hearts and souls-- or worse, the cult of celebrity claims their bodies entirely, elevating what was probably a humbling creative experience into the work of gods. And while that pays excellent tribute to the mysticism of inspiration, it probably distances the artists from the rest of the pack (i.e., us) more than necessary. Bob Drake plays distant music (literally, from the south of France), but apparently takes no pleasure in abstractions that might, in the hands of a lesser musician, quickly alienate an audience. An abashed fan of olde-thyme pompasaurs like Yes and Uriah Heep, he rarely shies away from extroverted splashes of sound, be they cacophonous guitar solos or wailing vocal harmonies. Yet, these moments seem less like flashes-in-the-pan than merely broader strokes on his palette. In fact, where you might expect his songs to erupt into classical arcana, his underlying forms appear to be closer to traditional folk, albeit murder ballads and nursery tale night beasts. It's almost as if Drake's relentless attention to detail and humility, even when obscured by a few layers of feedback, keeps whatever pretensions he has in check. 13 Songs and a Thing is Drake's fifth solo record, and continues in a similarly eclectic vein as last year's excellent The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors. However, where that album was a song-cycle of short stories, 13 Songs doesn't have a running narrative to tie it together. Fans of his work shouldn't be disappointed, though, as per usual, there is no mistaking his sound. The opener ""Chase"", written by Dominic Frontiere (theme composer for the 60s horror show The Outer Limits) and arranged by Drake, would actually fit well on the last album, as its frenzied, claustrophobic terror is hammered home via an aggressive acoustic guitar jag and nervous violin. It's a junk symphony that would make as much sense coming from Tom Waits as Danny Elfman. Similarly, ""Ten for a Dime"" uses intricate guitar figures and bowed double bass to create an atmosphere not far from an Alfred Hitchcock soundtrack, yet Drake's later juxtaposition of strange bluegrass riffs and Mellotron-soaked goth place it in a realm of his own design. Acoustic textures lend understated warmth to most of this music, as do the omnipresent trad-American folk references. The fractured waltz ""In Case the Insulator Fails"" could almost be an outtake from O Brother, Where Art Thou were it not for the offhandedly dissonant asides from violin and electric guitar. It leads into the brief ""Griffin"", which is musically akin to Bela Bartok's take on The Beatles' ""I've Just Seen a Face"", but detailing Drake's erotic fascination with a museum statue places it well outside either folk-pop or modern classical music. The most striking moments on 13 Songs come when comparisons are much harder to make. ""And the Sun"" is a gorgeous piece featuring distant classical piano and a barely audible gauze of ambient noise, punctuated by random bursts of radio static. It's an almost perfect realization of almost forgotten mental imagery, as if years of life and music have obscured the original beauty of the piano music-- and in fact, Drake notes that part of the piece was recorded in the early 80s. Guest vocalist Dick Verdult carries both ""Foam I"" and ""Rtuuf"" with throaty Spanish, and lends the former tune elegance not far removed from Paul Simon's buoyant work on Graceland. Of course, Drake throws in a cavernous echo and expansive, almost overburdened arrangement of deep bass and primal, thudding percussion to knock it off center. And then there's ""Building with Bones"", aka ""A Thing"": an epic backbreaker that sounds pretty close to the ground beneath my house caving in for about 13 straight minutes. Despite repeated demonstrations of idiosyncrasy and an apparent dedication to turning left when a right is expected, 13 Songs is hardly an exclusive experience. I'd argue that Drake might even be approaching a hybrid of folk and avant-garde music that includes the most engaging characteristics of both without ever really betraying one for the other. Maybe that leaves him alone in music circles (though I might make similar claims for the aforementioned Simon and Waits), but should be all the easier to pick his brand of noise from a crowd for listeners. Sometimes it doesn't pay to look for links to the outside world, and his tunes are inviting enough that it may never occur to you to do so anyway.","Musicians don't exist on desert islands, isolated from human contact, any more than other folks.

Englabörn,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c25e6ef95969320272/1:1/w_160/f6dca289.gif,2003-03-05 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4274-englaborn/,Touch,"Though the lucre here at Pitchfork is plentiful, and I scarcely have time to get one wrecked Lex towed off before a new one is delivered, any promo CD package that falls through my mail slot is doomed. They will all be sold unless they can prove something to me, and quick. I don't need the damn things cluttering my pad. Englabörn, with its pretty little Jon Wozencraft cover, didn't have a prayer. But through a series of accidents, the disc somehow slipped into repeat mode without my realizing it. By the time I'd caught the error, the album had played through twice, looping and breathing to life, its leitmotifs orbiting the room in blissful, indolent circles, completely entrancing me. This first solo album from Jóhann Jóhannsson is absolutely beautiful, and it has only become moreso over the past few months, sustaining me for long periods of time when other music just wouldn't do the trick. Jóhannsson is a member of the Icelandic artist group Kitchen Motors, and aside from the fact that his loose-knit collective has, on at least one occasion, held a concert for cellphones at their local Reykjavik mall, additional information is scarce. So I'll tell you what I know: Taking cues he provided to a stage play by Hávar Sigurjónsson, Jóhannsson's Englabörn is composed of music he wrote, as performed by the Eþos String Quartet, with a light gauze of electronic processing applied to it. Although it's difficult to ascertain any obvious tweaking in the end result, there is just a slight haze in the air surrounding the sounds, letting the notes levitate and linger. It begins innocuously enough with an AppleTalk voice reciting Latin scribe Catullus' poem, ""Odi et Amo"". An intriguing selection of text, the poem addresses the agonizing extremes between devout love and consuming hate. To have this very human poem delivered by a droid tenor reveals all sorts of counterbalances at work: gentle, nuanced music that soundtracked a brutally violent piece of theatre, these acoustic, classical string quartets mixing with digital alchemy, and an ancient voice coursing through the latest in Speak 'n' Spell technology. It somehow balances beautifully, graceful in all its gestures. Some of the pieces, like ""Karen býr til Engil"" and ""Eins og Venjulegt Fólk"" recall the similarly melancholy electronic touch that infused the most desolate moments of Radiohead's Kid A. With subtle, digital rumbles, poignant glockenspiel, and scarce violin sustainment, a dreadful space surrounds each note, allowing the music to resonate deep inside of you. ""Jói & Karen"" is exceptionally restrained, the piano moving like droplets off of slowly melting icicles, and the violin breathing warmth from above. The hesitation of each breath and falling bead feels as though it were a Morton Feldman piece condensed to three minutes. ""Sálfrædingur"" is the most propulsive of the set, sounding like classic Moondog, with shaking rattles, percolating drums, and stately piano. Its counterpoint is ""Sálfræðingur Deyr"", where the theme is recast with bowed strings, the bass solemn in its slow movements. As the violin shivers against it, Jóhannsson reduces it all to scarcely whispered vibrations. This resonates into the music boxes and small squeaked brass of ""Bad"". ""Ég Átti Gráa Aesku"" recombines the processional percussion from before with the earlier refrains of piano into a more majestic statement, while ""Krókódíll"" recapitulates the downward movement of piano notes of the opening theme, this time with the voice replaced by profound organ drones. By the time of ""Odi et Amo - Bis"", which slows the original recitation to the point of near stasis, each computer tone and bowed note is stilled to the point of absolute zero, the echoes reverberating off of the ice. A rememberance of things past is conjured up as chilling ghosts float in the ether. The emotional strain is apparent with these haunting last moments, though the music remains elegant and elegiac. Just as Catullus balanced the extreme emotional opposites of love and hate into a composite whole the greater of its parts, so does Jóhannsson transform these sixteen miniatures into an exquisite listening experience. With the slightest of movements, and in a handful of descending notes, a shivering gulf of sadness is conveyed. It's easy to mention something grandiose, but to fully expound upon this subtly gestured work of music is far more difficult a task. While Englabörn remains out of reach with these words, the music continues to enrich.","Though the lucre here at Pitchfork is plentiful, and I scarcely have time to get one wrecked Lex towed off ...

Facts and Fictions,Asian Dub Foundation,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07f5e6ef9596931ff74/1:1/w_160/46d6ff04.jpg,2003-03-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/320-facts-and-fictions/,Nation,"""The music we make supposedly contains a lot of different styles, but it's not eclectic. It's a reflection of everything that we listen to and the people we interact with. We use 'dub' in our title because dub is a framework for experimentation, not just about reproducing a sound from a previous era."" So says the liner notes from this reissue of Asian Dub Foundation's debut album, originally released in 1995. It's an interesting assertion, and one I'm inclined to agree with. True to that summary, Facts and Fictions does incorporate elements of many styles, but it really doesn't come across as eclectic, as every element is fully incorporated into a base sound that's fairly consistent from song to song, and, to a lesser extent, from album to album. You can hear the influence of dub in the way the music's put together; you can hear hip hop, jungle and bhangra in its rhythmic undercarriage, rock in the guitars, and traditional Bengali and North Indian music in the instrumentation and samples they employ. The resulting mix is something incredibly unique and frequently arresting, but while their music may wear multinational tendencies on its sleeve, their lyrics are fiercely, proudly Indian. This is third release of Facts and Fictions, and it's clothed in one of the most thoroughly awful covers I've seen in years. Yes it's the music that counts, but the artwork is inexcusable give that the label already had two better sleeves to choose from. The Foundation coalesced at a music technology workshop for Asian youth in London, and quickly developed a political stridency based on anti-racism, displayed vividly in their lyrics, without much mincing of words. Britain's large Indian population has long felt itself marginalized in their society, and not without reason, as the lingering haze of colonialism still refuses to fade away. Vocalist Deedar ""Master D"" Zaman peppers his raps with lines like ""We're often told that this country's bursting at the seams/ But we're never told that there are in fact more people leaving than entering/ Immigration has become synonymous with black people/ Yet over sixty percent of immigrants are white,"" laying out his case in the plainest possible terms. This is where we start to run up against some problems: at this early point in the Foundation's evolution, their righteousness was occasionally clumsy. Read those lines above again; they may be true, and it's an alarming reality (revealing some rotten agendas), but, god, it's not exactly poetry. On top of this, diction somewhat compromises the message Deedar strives so hard to put forth, due to his singularly odd mix of Cockney drawl and Reggae-influenced flow. The Foundation's lyrics occasionally seem to run at cross purposes as well, mixing messages like ""We are gonna/ Spread power with words,"" from ""Debris"" with lines that advocate violence against fascists: ""Time is getting short, elections in May/ Give the fascist man a gunshot-- that's the only way."" I hate fascists, too, but this lowers the Foundation to the level of their enemies, and as a message, it's not constructive. However formative the album is as a whole, Facts and Fictions still contains a few stunning moments, such as the media indictment refrain to ""PKNB"": ""The Sun [UK tabloid] has got its facts wrong and it's fucking up my day,"" delivered over a slowly morphing beat that creeps from slow and deliberate to driving and manic, with tabla loops keeping a constant pulse in the background. The single ""Rebel Warrior"" is the band's best early song, with its strangely calming swirl of keys, flutes, and sampled Indian singers forming a disarmingly comfortable backdrop for Deedar, railing against the final vestiges of British Empire. Chadrasonic's guitar is given more breathing room than usual, and Deedar relaxes his delivery, becoming more intelligible without sacrificing his style. Facts and Fictions is an interesting look at where the Asian Dub Foundation got their start as politically-charged upstarts in the mid-90s, but I'd only recommend it to fans who don't already own it. Newcomers are much better off going for either Rafi's Revenge or Community Music, albums that showcase the Foundation in full, amazing effect.","""The music we make supposedly contains a lot of different styles, but it's not eclectic.

Live with J Lesser,Matmos,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3de13d197565213be17/1:1/w_160/07ca8a43.gif,2003-03-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5150-live-with-j-lesser/,Vague Terrain,"At first, I wondered why I had to mail away to an apartment in San Francisco in order to get my hands on Matmos' new live album. Now that I've heard it, I'm filled with speechless understanding. This is not the kind of music you sell in stores, not the kind of music you play if people you love are nearby. It's more like what you'd use to mask the sound of something horrible going on next door, like the frenzied mating of 15-foot dragonflies, or a tank convoy being strafed by fighter jets, or the partial-birth abortion of a wild rhinoceros. You might wonder what interest there might be in a live album by a band whose creates their music solely with elaborately programmed digital samples. Fortunately, the band generally forgoes LP recreations in concert, opting instead for largely improvised music. In fact, Matmos strive to keep things interesting onstage, to such a degree that fans may not realize what they're getting themselves into. High, Live & Dirty captures the outcome of some of their live experimentation, such as: ascending speakers to the ceiling with the help of balloons (Paramount Theatre, Oakland, 2001), subjecting turkey calls to wholesale abuse (Union Chapel, London, 1999), electrocuting slinkies (KDVS, UC Davis, 1997), and doing something I do not want to understand with a bucket of oatmeal (KSZU, Stanford, 1998). The San Francisco-based couple (Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt) is well-known for nestling their own raunchy universe of found sounds into glitched-out disco-bounce, and, some say, saving musique concréte from the dustbin of electronic music history. Notoriously, they'll go anywhere for a good sample, from the liposuction clinic to the sewer and back again. Usually, though, delightful sounds lurk close to home-- in inflatable blankets, for example, or records, whistles, insects, banjos, or crayfish. In these live shows and radio spots, Matmos attempts to capture some of the sound-seeking adventure of their unique studio process, yet the result is strikingly different from their studio sound, not least because here the experimentation is wholly unhinged from any friendly dance grid: very few tracks feature Daniel's trademark moist, irreverent beats-- and the addition of hard-working genre assassin J Lesser to the wrecking crew will only serve to further alienate the Björk fans. But what's exciting about these tracks is that moment when the distracted lab-jock feel of the onstage experiment begins to yield to the effortless discovery of a hidden song structure. Yes, song. No matter how vile the raw materials, these three listen for the hook and are ready to sweeten up the chaos when it finally emerges. Of course, this moment often corresponds to when the pre-sequenced rhythm tracks are dropped into the mix. It's a trick Matmos use all the time, and it almost always works. Without this essential component, however, all you have to cling to as a listener is your associations. Better make them as free as possible.","At first, I wondered why I had to mail away to an apartment in San Francisco in order to get ...

Melody A.M.,Röyksopp,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c6b1335d7bf1698582/1:1/w_160/172d8f9a.gif,2003-03-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6860-melody-am/,Astralwerks,"Melody A.M. came out quite a while ago, but if you were hoping this would be a catch-up rave or a late-breaking pan we're going to have to disappoint: Röyksopp are, ultimately, too beautiful to hate and too harmless to really love. You might already be familiar with this Norwegian pair from their appearance on every downtempo or electronic pop compilation ever made. These compilations, which have spread across the recent musical landscape like mellowed-out and occasionally groovy dandelions, are basically the result of a few people noticing that slick-and-dreamy trip-hop and records like Air's Moon Safari could be appreciated by practically anyone: embraced by clubbers during their daytime hours, yes, and appreciated by ostensibly clued-up rock hipsters, but just as appealing to someone who never cared about being clued-up in the first place. All across the Western world, it was discovered, happy thirty-something couples with business degrees and Jettas could pick up free downtempo samplers at Crate & Barrel and-- we might imagine-- enjoy Zero 7, Badly Drawn Boy, and housed-up Dido remixes while lighting candles and taking baths. People who find this horrible will recall Dirty Vegas' ""Days Go By"" and call it all ""music for car commercials,"" but on a certain level they're just being condescending and mean-spirited: People like this stuff because it's pleasant and reasonably interesting. Röyksopp, you should know, are the heirs to exactly this lineage, having picked up the crown Air once wore and set it on top of creamy, accessible house music. Their own tracks are languid but funky, occasionally revving up into a friendly house throb and occasionally laying back into sunny crooning very much like Moon Safari's-- I'm not completely convinced ""Sparks"" wasn't actually on that record. Röyksopp's many compilation appearances are based in part on that, but just as much on their stunningly consistent string of truly amazing remixes-- a string that culminated last year with their getting inside the dauntingly singular world of The Streets, turning ""Weak Become Heroes"" inside-out into an ecstatic gush Mike Skinner would likely never have dreamed of. The quality of those remixes is no surprise, because here's the thing: Röyksopp are master pop craftsmen, the Brian Wilsons and Burt Bacharachs of downtempo house. They know their tracks inside and out, from the subtlest sonic details, to the interplay of melodies, to the Big Picture build and flow-- and it's the pretty remarkable evidence of this on Melody A.M. that's endeared them even to many of those who think of themselves as being above easy-to-like compilation-fodder. ""Eple"", for instance, reconstructs vintage funky-drummer beats up against an addictively twinkly synth, all so enjoyably that it takes a while to notice details like the odd, rewinding stutter they've worked across several instruments. Or take ""In Space"", where loving little string swells drop off into achingly pretty harping while the remarkably complex beatwork ticks away bashfully in a corner. Call it new age pretty, Enya pretty, but hey: pretty is pretty, my friends. Melody A.M. is full of this stuff-- the stuff some people call ""sophisticated"" and ""organic,"" the stuff others might rightly identify as ""house for people who don't actually like house"" or ""ambient for people who don't actually like ambient."" The best moments, oddly, seem to come both from Röyksopp's devoting themselves entirely to this accessibility and from dropping their guard on it. On ""Röyksopp's Night Out"" they allow themselves to break into a free-flowing and slightly less restrained darkness, just enough for you to wish they'd try their hands at a full-on rage; immediately afterward, though, they've erased that wish by assembling another shyly sunny patter for King of Convenience-turned-downtempo-crooner Erlend Øye to sing-song winsomely over. (""Poor Leno"", the album's most successful single, has Øye voicing a lullaby hook over a rich, subtly mutating, and equally charming groove.) The worst moments, unsurprisingly, come when Röyksopp go generically downtempo and then miss the mark-- witness the vocals on ""A Higher Place"". The total package is, by any measure, a flagship release: This is likely the most solid, confident, and generally pleasurable downtempo full-length you'll be hearing for a while. Whether that means it's a must-buy, more well-meaning nondescript bubbling, or end-of-the-world car-commercial music has to be left to you. My vote may not be the first of those options, but at times it comes reasonably close.","Melody A.M. came out quite a while ago, but if you were hoping this would be a catch-up rave ...

Get Rich or Die Tryin',50 Cent,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8bea9e61561daa7719/1:1/w_160/3160cbd9.jpg,2003-03-04 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3045-get-rich-or-die-tryin/,InterscopeShadyAftermath,"Whether the motivations stem from a Derrideian desire to transform our monsters into pets, a post-feminist need to latch onto a lost sense of dominant masculinity, the streets' unquenchable thirst for heroes, or simply a quest for a compelling urban narrative, hip-hop's obsession with the gangsta has dominated the genre for more than a decade. It has resulted in political pundits-- many, it must be noted, with latently racist agendas-- dismissing the entire culture as violent, misogynistic, and ultimately destructive. Stylistically, gangsta is a mesh of Cinema Verite and action blockbusters, where the grime and moral ambivalence of the crack trade clash with the unmitigated bravado of playa anthems. At its best, gangsta delves into these contradictions-- the pull between community and wealth, morality and survival-- with a deftness and wit alternately charming and horrifying. Unfortunately, Get Rich or Die Tryin' rarely reaches these pinnacles; for most of the album's duration, 50 wallows in the genre's clichés. The wit is sparse, the details are slim, and the threats are hollow. This isn't as much a moral quarrel as it is one of thematic development. Biggie came with the soul, Pac came with the charisma, L. had the wit, and Nas had the words. But, with the exception of a few quality verses sprinkled here and there, 50 strikes as a parody of these masters, and does little on his debut to establish a persona of his own. He doesn't delve into the character of the gangsta any deeper than the prosaism he spits, and while he obviously has an excellent vocal cadence and a finely tuned ear, his lyrics lack the textured imagery and dexterity of themes necessary to sustain interest over the course of a full album. In perhaps his biggest misstep, 50 Cent eschews a world inhabited by real people doing real shit for most of Get Rich, instead relying on generalized threats, proclamations of invincibility, and calls for pussy. Even the threats and declarations, bereft of the violent, pull-no-punches absolutism of Big L.'s early horrorcore, seem sanitized for Middle America. To put it bluntly, 50's rap sounds cold and mechanical, as though he were paralyzed by the pressures of hype or the prospect of his album being used as evidence against him in his trial for alleged weapons possession; the album sees him alternately declaring that he cares/doesn't care whether the D.A. hears these tracks. Yet, for all the flaws in 50 Cent's persona, Get Rich or Die Tryin' isn't without its redeeming qualities. For one, the album offers a handful of great singles (obviously: ""In Da Club"", ""Wanksta""), anchored by his distinctive, rolling drawl. Loping beats and Caribbean Casios adorn ""P.I.M.P."" while 50 flosses that misogynistic swagger; trigger-happy snares and organ punches cry out from the Dre-produced highlight ""Heat"". Yet, none of the tracks touch his appearance on 1999's In Too Deep soundtrack-- even while its fish-in-a-barrel attacks on virtually every platinum-selling artist of the last five years smacked of Eminem strategies, ""How to Rob (An Industry Nigga)"" factored heavily into the anticipation surrounding Get Rich, offering a glimpse of the juggernaut he might become. In the meantime, the production work remains Get Rich's strong suit, boasting contributions from Sha Money XL, Megahertz, Rockwilder, Kon Artis, and both Eminem's and Dr. Dre's crews. Dre's team drops four tracks, each supreme examples of the raw ingenuity and virtuosity that, beyond the killer rhymes, made 2001 such a visceral, addictive party record. He also proves that, though rarely as experimental as Timbaland or as self-consciously high-tech as the Neptunes, he can still drop a hit to rival either of them, and with half as many layers. The bounce on ""In Da Club"" is straight-up irresistible, Dre at both his minimalist best and most deceptively infectious. Still, 50 just isn't quite there yet. Had he offered more tracks that showcased his talents quite as tangibly as ""How to Rob (An Industry Nigga)"" alongside the massive radio hits bumping from every inner-city Escalade, Get Rich or Die Tryin' very well might have been the landmark achievement it's being touted as. But as his character presently lacks the dynamism and depth required for that elusive gangsta magnetism that's a prerequisite for notoriety, 50 goes down as simply a decent MC with a wrenching back story, whose potential landed him a gig with the world's dopest beatmakers and the hype machine that shot the Great White Way into the pop culture stratosphere.","Whether the motivations stem from a Derrideian desire to transform our monsters into pets, a post-feminist\n\ need to latch ...

Incredible String Band / Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air,Incredible String Band,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b962eb335119a49ec768/1:1/w_160/5b2c184e.jpg,2003-03-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11760-incredible-string-band-liquid-acrobat-as-regards-the-air/,ElektraElektra,"I guess I'm gonna take it up with Malkmus. When he was doing millennial Mogwai promo at Matador, he decided to lay it all on the line and proclaim the Incredibles the ""greatest band of all time."" Of course it followed that Mogwai were ""the greatest band of the next millennium,"" so take each decree as you will... Regardless, the hungry dogs of hipsterdom were loosed on the Incredible String Band, and every dusty copy of The Big Huge-- even the wretched No Ruinous Feud-- was snatched up for worship. Elders like Robert Plant and John Lennon championed them in the past, and Boston folksters got with them in the eighties, but their status came back to the fore recently, as No Neck Blues Band and Avey Tare & Geologist attached the ISB's stream-of-conscious meanderings to their noisy blurts. Oneida even named a song after the group's girlfriends Rose and Licorice (a song since covered by Liars). As you delve into these Renaissance Fair backwaters, be wary: not all hold the same mystical powers of whimsy. Favorites of thespian types that call each other ""Lord"" or ""M'lady"" on their three-day weekends, the Incredibles pack a twee wallop into their fey tunes, enough to make Donovan or even Belle & Sebastian seem like leather-clad teddy boys. It can be overwhelming to say the least. Once you're stoned on it though, their peak output-- from '67 to '69, when 5000 Spirits, Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, Wee Tam and The Big Huge were released-- pours forth like the nectar of the gods (fairground slang for a keg of Olympia). There's nothing quite like their fairy-dusted folk, blending disparate twines of mystical musings and quirky, naïf instrumentation on a whim. These two reissues straddle that enchanted era, serving as bookends: before the Summer of Love and after going 'clear' with L. Ron Hubbard. Their first offering, from 1966, finds them still staid in their English folk roots. Springing from the same scene as future British Isles legends like John Renborn, Bert Jansch, and Shirley Collins, the group works as a trio, with soon-to-be-departed Clive Palmer pitching in for a number or two. Strange as their folk may seem, heavy with flute trills, nasal croons, and flat-picked strings, it's not ISB's strong suit, and their trad material-- ""Schaeffer's Jig"", ""Whistle Tune"" and ""Niggertown"" (""dusted with laughter powder"" as the notes say, those sick fucks)-- are tepid at best. To spice things up, and stay way ahead of the academic multi-culti curve, they dash bits of Bulgarian and Indian exotic fare into their songs. Incredible String Band is a bit incongruous, but within two short years, the group would effortlessly weave in and out of all the world's music, with the deftest, dreamlike ease. The Dylan inclinations are a bit by the numbers as well, but that's expected with most singer-songwriters of the age; the most interesting aspect of this album is that it documents the nascent stylings of Robin Williamson and Mike Heron as they find their respective voices. Williamson's romanticism is abundant (but vague) in ""Womankind"", and his keening voice expands and contracts along with his strumming style, both coming as easily as mantra-breath. From such a seed arose the very beautiful, personal ""First Girl I Loved"" (covered by both Judy Collins and Jackson Browne), and at full blossom, the feminine-universe sprawl of ""Maya"", from The Big Huge. Mike Heron's tunes follow along the same lines of natural growth. ""The Tree"" reveals his self-induced penchant for ""communing"" with Nature, capriciously talking to her, and her to he; this figment of fancy grows to include all the other little animals of the forest, on the cute and curious ""Hedgehog Song"" off of The 5000 Spirits, and perhaps the Incredible's finest recorded moment, the folk-form phagocytosis of ""A Very Cellular Song"". Neither songwriter is quite there yet, but they both lay groundwork in earnest. Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air is on the other side of the ISB bell curve, five years on, when their moment has already passed, on a slippery slope downhill. All alchemical incantations are of precarious balance: Acrobat is just a pinch or so off the mark, but it makes a crucial difference for the internal chemistry at work. Tensions have mounted between the two main songwriters, Heron leaning toward psychedelic rock, and Williamson trying to weave more theatricality into his compositions. The lineup has changed, the girlfriends are gone, and everyone's playing headgames. It's no Fleetwood Mac melodrama, but there's some audible discomfort. Williamson's ""Talking of the End"" is a promising opener, a five minute showcase of what he does best and most brilliantly, contrasting cringe-worthy musical elements and synthesizing them into something holistic and magical. He effortlessly glides from gypsy violin to Eastern Liturgical mass choir, then into some tambourine slap over a sitar solo before stirring in a dash of boy-girl folk levitation, with countrified yelps and pedal steel. It somehow coheres into the record's grandest moment, a meditation on imminent apocalypse and the intimate personal bonds between two people. If only it were all so effortless, so unforced, but it's apparent the group is grasping at straws, hoping for the natural gold that once came so easy. Liquorice guests on a song-- her first appearance in over six albums-- but it's obvious why she was relegated to harmonic duties: her voice is watery by itself, wavering in a thick brogue on ""Cosmic Boy"". They bring in a full drum kit for ""Painted Chariot"", but it's mild, stumbling rock, with an organum interlude plopped in the middle for continuity. ""Evolution Rag"" is downright awful, a funk fueled by mandolin plucks before it devolves into a bog of kazoo, slide whistle, and roller-rink organ twaddle. The weaving of three traditional jigs and one Williamson bit for ""Jigs"" shows they could still draw upon their roots, but ISB seem estranged from so recent a past. They dig up Mike Heron's ""Tree"" from the first album, but it's a half-hearted attempt to redress the song in a new swathing of piano, mandolin, and bazouki. The Incredibles' true talent was sprawl, songs that spiraled into the double-digit mark, like ""Maya"", ""Ducks on a Pond"", or my personal favorite, ""Creation"". The ISB's incantations have more time to take hold in these cases, but it a shame to find ""Darling Belle""-- the eleven-minute finale of Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air-- is cut of the same cloth as the disastrous double album of musical theatre, 1970's U. Each member has a vague recitation, a part to play, but nothing coheres until the very end of the failed piece, when the band is briefly beautiful, like the cover photograph: half-obscured in the dark, wandering lost in the countryside, indistinguishable. Blame it on a poor outing at Woodstock, on rising membership fees for Scientology (look what it did to Chick Corea and Travolta!). Blame it on parting ways with labels and longtime producer Joe Boyd, on the tantric dissolution when Rose left the group, but the magic summoned by the Incredible String Band in the late 60s quickly abandoned them. These two reissues play like dashed, crumbling relics, only hinting at what the ISB were capable of in their prime. Anyone intrigued by their legend should look instead to what transpired between these two releases, when they may have deserved the title ""the greatest band of all time.""",,5.9,
Rost Pocks: The EP Collection,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3dceb335119a49ed7f0/1:1/w_160/c860f223.jpg,2003-03-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5458-rost-pocks-the-ep-collection/,Too Pure,"Seefeel was among the first bands described as ""post-rock"" by journalist Simon Reynolds. If you've heard Seefeel, it's obvious that Reynolds' definition of the term didn't take. His version of post-rock described bands that started with a rock structure and instrumental set-up (guitars, bass, drums, etc.), but used these tools to create music that put more focus on rhythm and texture, as was more common in club music. Sometime around 1993, Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma of Mouse on Mars sent their demo tape to Too Pure because they admired the music of Seefeel, and I'm guessing that the title of this Too Pure EP collection is a reference to the band that brought them into the label's orbit. Rost Pocks collects material from five Too Pure EPs and adds one compilation track, and a number of these songs appeared on the duo's first three full-lengths (although usually in a different mix). Of course, as one would expect from a band that relies heavily on technology, Mouse on Mars had a different sound eight or nine years ago than they do today. When I interviewed Jan St. Werner for Pitchfork in the spring of 2001, he used the word ""shy"" to describe Mouse on Mars' early music. I take his use of the word ""shy"" to be something like ""subtle"" and ""polite."" Early Mouse on Mars was about simple, hummable melodies and sonic detail. From the start, the duo programmed their modular synthesizers to create their trademark and much-emulated squishy sounds, but they wouldn't begin experimenting with more aggressive tracks like ""Actionist Respoke"" until later. Only ""Bip"" here, which was extended for 1995's Iaora Tahiti, really ups the tempo, with flurries of breakbeats; the bulk of the tracks collected on Rost Pocks drift by on a mellow, dub-inflected groove and memorable tunes. One distinguishing characteristic of Mouse on Mars that was apparent from the start, despite their rightful classification as an electronic group, was their disinterest in building tracks from a series of repeating loops. It's always been their policy to vary the tracks slightly through the repeating sections. Their songwriting method at this time was informed by rock, which might explain why their audience is populated by a large number of rock fans. People dance at a Mouse on Mars show, but the event is much closer to a rock experience than a night at a club. It's not really DJ-informed music, though tracks like this compilation's ""Schnick-Schnack"", which features the women of Stereolab as they collaborated on the Cache Coeur Naif EP, anticipate the microhouse that would develop as the 90s wound down. Speaking of Cache Coeur Naif, three of the four tracks from that EP appear here (""Glim"" is missing, but that was borrowed from the group's 1998 vinyl-only LP Glam anyway), and they're all very good, and make me a bit nostalgic for when I first heard them. But more than anything, they make me pine for this era of Stereolab, right around Dots and Loops, when Werner and Toma were producing some of their tracks. The Mouse on Mars pop sense always made sense next to Stereolab. Another thing Mouse on Mars had from the get-go was a first-rate sense of humor. The IDM end of the electronic music spectrum has a rep for darkness, nihilism, and impenetrable abstraction, but Mouse on Mars during this time felt very comfortable being light, funny and playful. ""Twift"" sounds like the theme for a cartoon cop show, some sort of Hanna-Barbera version of Dragnet. Iaora Tahiti's ""Saturday Night World Cup Fieber"" is really just a catchy, tuneful celebration of soccer (there's no way it could be anything more) and the two remixes of the track here highlight its simple pleasures. I'm trying to put myself in the headspace of someone who hears Rost Pocks having known only Idiology or Niun Niggung. If you look to the band for melody and atmosphere, and don't view their music as a serious challenge, I would guess that Rost Pocks would be very much to your liking. It's certainly an excellent summary of those early years, and as an added bonus to those who dislike ambient house signifiers like the constant kickdrum thump that was all over the duo's 1994 debut, Vulvaland, the single mixes of these tracks are more pop-oriented, with live drums in place of the drum machine. If you're not going to get the three full-lengths from this period (which I would recommend), Rost Pocks is the way to go.","Seefeel was among the first bands described as ""post-rock"" by journalist Simon Reynolds.

Sound Restores Young Men,Cynthia Dall,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88c5e6ef9596932122f/1:1/w_160/876df5f6.jpg,2003-03-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2150-sound-restores-young-men/,Drag City,"Dear Diary, Picking up where we left off: I've decided that my crush on the mayor's wife has something to do with the mayor's being an Ivy Leaguer. My attraction to her is, gulp, rooted in the way her gruff composure silently upbraids his foppish kewpie-dollness. Another loose end: I think the frenzied dreams about mannequin-luvin' are based on anxiety about needing new clothes, instead of the myriad less reputable interpretations. Incidentally, I hope you don't think it's rude that I don't ask how you are doing; it just always struck me as insane, when I snuck reads of others' diaries, that they began, ""Dear Diary, hope this finds you well?"", etc. So I've got to review a Cynthia Dall CD for Pitchforkmedia.com, that e-zine that is fast becoming a cultural monolith as bristling with flash and bias as Fox News. I'm torn, Diary. You see, I dig her other work, but this... not so much. And it's on Drag City, a label so singularly wily, foxy, hip, outré, and haute that I find myself allotting their releases a different kind of attention than I would, say, a release from Atlantic. If Matador and Merge are the Monitor and Merrimack of big indie labels... well, I don't know where that leaves Sub Pop, since Washington wasn't a state during the Civil War. Okay, new time period: Drag City is like H.L. Mencken, a lovable pariah, a smug beacon of intelligence and contrarianism, even though Mencken was from Baltimore which ruins the geographical thing I had going with the Northern Matador and the Southern Merge. The point is, I feel a pressure to wink knowingly at Drag City releases, to which I'll admit extending a kind of insecure sympathy. I remember pretending I didn't hate Flying Saucer Attack's Distant Station, and even feigning that I ""got"" King Kong, huh-huh. So basically I suck? But maybe, Diary, I was caught in the pull of Drag City's communal, give-us-a-hand-here vibe; the label is (yes, another analogy) a veritable Brook Farm (K Records being the Branch Davidian compound) where everybody helps everybody and where all the crime scenes contain the leavings of an O'Rourke, or a Murphy, or a Hagerty. Dall herself first surfaced as a kind of ""lovely assistant"" to Smog's Bill Callahan. Her distinctive guitar work (a top-heavy, distorted, amateurish staccato attack that strikes back and forth from chord X to chord Y unchangingly) is easy to spot, and she did vocals on at least three releases, ending around The Doctor Came at Dawn in 1996. That year, Dall released Untitled, on which she was accompanied by Jim O'Rourke and Smog. The record was a fascinating slab of curdling darkness, and Dall came across as playfully bitchy with a hint of the sinister. No hipster's yuletide mix is complete without the song on which Dall repeats, over music that sounds like the test tube baby of The Exorcist and Halloween soundtracks, ""What are you buying me for Christmas?/ It better be good."" The album was soilingly fun, like being tickled with a bloody feather. Sound Restores Young Men, though, is frustratingly primitive, and thus monochromatic, which is a shame because Dall's had six years to work on her guitar. And except for when she actually emotes on ""Nest of Dead Children"", or when she calls to mind Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons-era Blonde Redhead on the great, tumultuous, eight-minute ""Snakeblood and Vodka"", her distant voice sounds like a flatter Juliana Hatfield, or maybe Frente! girl Angie Hart if she was a Yank on downers, or maybe soda brat Hallie Eisenberg auditioning for Ophelia's hey-nonny-nonny freakout scene. Some of the fragile waif stuff here might be a reflection of the back cover's note that the album is a ""study of a young woman struck mute after witnessing her mother's murder,"" but that may be a tease, since the packaging is covered in similar random bits a la the kings of cut-n-paste-n-scribble, (Drag City scions) Pavement. Incisive and divisive lyrics, like Untitled's about hating her body, are fewer and farther between here, though she gets a few good accusatory jabs in, such as this one from the jealous anthem ""The Party"": ""When you talk about her, I feel as if I'd been in her myself."" Dall careens from moments of precise imagery to patches of vague talk that recall, well, diary entries. So Diary, I reckon that in the Pitchfork piece I'll just say something that sounds totally objective, like, ""Despite its pedigree, this album's spook-chick tone is very early 90s, very drama club doyenne, very Tori Amos and Throwing Muses."" I won't mention the mayor's wife or the mannequins, or anything that would fuel some ""I'm intimidated by aloof femininity"" double-standard argument. I'll just hope no one points out comparatively hypocritical stances I've taken on other minimalist mid-fi outings. God, I can still hear my third wife saying, as she was packing her bags, that my bookshelf lacked proper representation of women and that how that was ""a metaphor for our skylab,"" ""our skylab"" already being her metaphor for our relationship's arc of enthusiasm, then eventless orbit, then choreographed plummet. I dutifully played Cynthia Dall's Untitled on the way to purchase bookshelf-democratizing tomes by Lydia Davis, Mary Robison, and Wislawa Szymborska. How's this for a last sentence, Diary, you truest and most charitable consort: ""Sound Restores Young Men is fundamentally hampered by production that reduces Dall's role, on her own damn platter, to performing backup vocal duties for a lead track that was never lain down."" And if people write to say the review was annoying, I'll say 'twas a case of critic emulating subject.","Dear Diary,

Chains and Black Exhaust,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79ec0084474cd0c0c23/1:1/w_160/88148305.gif,2003-03-03 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1911-chains-and-black-exhaust/,Jones,"Aged rock critic Richard Meltzer once said that writing about music is much harder today than it was in the 60s. He said that back then, there probably weren't 20 great bands in the world, so it was much easier to cover the scene comprehensively. I'd say he was reducing the issue a tad (especially in light of sets like Nuggets), but there is a kernel of wisdom in his observation. In 1967, Jimi Hendrix almost single-handedly rallied troupes from rock, pop, blues, jazz and soul on both sides of the Atlantic with his psychedelic call to arms, Are You Experienced?. In one fell swoop, he united the sounds of acts ranging from James Brown to The Beatles, and proved that young black men had as much a claim to rock's budding authenticity as any English mop tops. This could never happen again, as ironically, people like Hendrix contributed to a splintering of scenes and sounds that made common threads almost impossible to find (or wind) thereafter. In the wake of that fertile era, rock historians penned millions of words in hopes of connecting disparate dots into a clear lineage. You know the drill: Hendrix begat Earth, Wind and Fire, Can and Led Zeppelin, who in turn begat everyone from Bad Brains to Lauryn Hill to Pearl Jam. The holes in this reductive reasoning-- all too common in the post-Creem, post-Rolling Stone world of music journalism-- becomes apparent when you realize that hey, there might have been more than twenty good bands way back when, and wow, people were coming up with all kinds of shit in their free time. One crucial moment, almost always glossed over, is the short-lived Black Rock ""scene"" of the late 60s and early 70s (only occasionally in cahoots with Black Power); you'd figure that, coming immediately after Hendrix, bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, the Bar-Kays and the newly rockified Isley Brothers would seem obvious parallels, and accordingly, they're the ones always brought up in such discussions. However, bands from all over the place were shooting for the very same synthesis of American countercultural music that Hendrix did were all over, as the mysterious compilation Chains And Black Exhaust strives to document. Without a track list, artist mentions or liner notes, the Memphix crew (a collective of DJs and funk 45 junkies spearheaded by Dante Carfagna) attempt to set the record straight on black rock, psychedelia and funk, releasing this seventeen-track comp on Jones (a sub-label of their own Memphix Records). The sound is on the exact same, embryonic tip as Funkadelic's first record (if they'd had even less of a budget). Hendrix's wah-wah makes several appearances, as does his stoned out vocal delivery, and the omnipresent direct-from-vinyl mastering gives it a vintage groove. Of course, it would have been nice to know what the hell I was listening to without resorting to major search engine detective work, but for the most part, it's a stone jam of such proportions as to render the confusion part of the experience. The first half of a great bit captured from a radio talk show (""it's the color man, and the monthly payments, you know what I mean?"") opens the record, and leads directly to Blackrock's ""Yeah Yeah"". Piano and guitar drone set the stage for badass kung fu stomp, courtesy of molasses-laden drums and bass, both doing their best to max out the mics. An acid-fried guitar solo elevates it into the Hendrix/Eddie Hazel stratosphere. Likewise, Iron Knowledge's ""Showstopper"" takes Hendrix's patented quivering fret trick (on bass, no less!) and slaps down an anti-war jam so infectious, the singers can barely stay on key during the chorus. OK, in truth some of these bands were less than polished, but the spirit is always there. ""Life Is A Gamble"", performed by Preacher, Doug Anderson's ""Mama, Here Comes the Preacher"" and Hot Chocolate's ""What's Good for the Goose"" are prime slices of black rock, and would have sounded completely at home on Parliament's Osmium LP (""shooby dooby, bang bang, brotha's gotta groovy thang""), or one of the early Ohio Players records. The former tune features a break so potent a crossing of Band of Gypsies and a porno soundtrack, Westbound Records should pay them back royalties. Gran Am's ""Get High"" represents the raw end of the spectrum here, as the band overdub their vocalizing of the title over and over, threatening to bury the drums completely. On the other end is Curtis Knight's super-tight ""The Devil Made Me Do It"", which is an excellent mix of Superfly pulse and almost pop, classic rock hooks. The lesser tracks play it closest to standard funk, such as the Kool & the Gang spunk of track 4, or the funky Getaway music of track 14-- of course, I have no idea who I just dissed, but so goes limited pressing, semi-bootleg funk comps. There's a rumor Chains and Black Exhaust will be reissued next year with recording info and track listing, but for now, Jones is your connection. It's not as if there are loads of other comps with this stuff out there, and until somebody gets off their ass and issues those early Funkadelic records in a decent mix, you need this. Shit, you need it anyway.","Aged rock critic Richard Meltzer once said that writing about music is much harder today than it was in the ...

Irresistible Impulse,James Chance,by: Kim Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58313d1975652138f8b/1:1/w_160/7aa1f63a.jpg,2003-03-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1397-irresistible-impulse/,Tiger Style,"Between the late 70s and early 80s, there was a lot of noisy music being produced, but in New York there were some determinedly antagonistic inventors. The equation, as it's presented, is that punk rockers only knew three chords, while these New Yorkers, who became known as part of the nihilistically monikered no wave genre, didn't know any. The five or six years during which this approach thrived were remarkable, and the sense of community and frustration that permeates the music is beautifully singular. This was a group of people who came to success in an ass-backward way, and in ideal cases, never compromised their artistic integrity.While many of the artists survived, a good percentage of their material did not; the credibility of the movement rested squarely on the shoulders of hipster paragons like Sonic Youth or the Atavistic imprint, which has released some choice no wave records in its time. Irresistible Impulse is a strange idea for a box set, but it is convenient. As of early 2003, there has been no reissue of the legendary No New York compilation from 1978; while the Eno-produced compendium has bled into the preservative fabric of the Internet, you can't buy this once hugely influential album at your local record store. Most of the artists on No New York have their own releases available, but the most oft-cited, seminal release from this critically lauded era is blatantly ignored, probably for prohibitive or indeterminate licensing costs. With that limitation, Tiger Style decided to release everything it could license from James Chance's catalog, over four hours of music on four CDs filled with the violent, off-kilter dance music he's legendary for (though none of the Chance contributions to No New York are included). Chance's band The Contortions were the most rhythmic group on No New York, yet removed from a myopic, too-academic view of the scene-- placed against the backdrop of their contemporaries in Lounge Lizards and Kid Creole & The Coconuts-- there is certainly a visible context for this work that, judging from the liner notes, Tiger Style might want you to forget about. Still, the post-dated posturing can't downplay Chance's significance: On Irresistible Impulse we can view his work for what it is, filled with sheer anger and contempt, qualities neither of the aforementioned groups could bring to bear, infused with a modicum of funk and soul. The first two discs are the recently out-of-print, much-praised Buy the Contortions LP and James White & The Blacks' Off White, with added live tracks from other previously released (though hard-to-find) live albums. These records seethe with rancor, and call to be heard: From the first song on Buy the Contortions, ""You're Useless and There Are No Excuses"", to the more subtle snubs on Off White, revolving around race, monotony, and sex, the real surprise in this is how antagonistic Chance is towards himself. By the time he adopts the persona of James White, he's made perhaps one of the most painfully self-aware gestures in modern rock and roll, on par with Lou Reed's ""I Wanna Be Black"" from 1978's Street Hassle. Chance looks at himself in the light of American music, seeing himself for what he is, rather than what he pretended to be. This is what made the no wave: It's not the winking, arty pretensions of the music, it's the revelation that Chance was simply trying to make soul music. He wants to be a thief, a crooner, a wailer, but he doesn't have the skills or pedigree. Following incredible live tracks from Soul Exorcism-- including a prickly cover of Michael Jackson's ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough""-- Irresistible Impulse begins a steep decline. Tiger Style is stretching the endeavor thin: While Buy the Contortions and Off White are unique, powerful albums, Chance is simply not substantial or diverse enough to merit over four hours of investigation. Even if he was, one would need more coaxing than the gushing liner notes can muster. The two remaining discs of the set take Chance releases from the early 80s, and signifying the fizzling out of his once provocative music. You almost want Chance to reach out of the stereo and push you away, or turn it off. Neither Sax Maniac nor The Flaming Demonics are particularly bad, they're just so goddamned unassuming. Singing about spending money, or covering a dull Ellington tune is fine; it reaches where Chance was heading, aping a simple love for Black American music, but the parts of Chance that were amateur, exciting and combative are gone. The attitude and angst that made him a cult figure are replaced by eight-minute songs, heavy on process and pondering, not only studio-sterile and mundane, but tediously drawn-out. Still, there's something endearingly trashy about a song like ""I Danced with a Zombie"", even if it isn't as sharp or brilliant as ""Stained Sheets"". Buy the Contortions and Off White are simply fantastic albums, hugely significant in the progression of underground sound, but unfortunately they appear doomed to further obscurity thanks to their restricted availability on this overstuffed $40 dollar box. A four-disc set doesn't make James Chance's art any less wonderful or valid, but it diminishes the resonance of his finest works; context is a huge part of what makes this music special, and given theirs, Chance and The Contortions don't need to stand up for more than two albums to ensure they're counted.","Between the late 70s and early 80s, there was a lot of noisy music being produced, but in New York ...

Mayors of the Moon,Jon LangfordThe Sadies,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9f5e6ef95969322eac/1:1/w_160/dc7ccbe0.jpg,2003-03-03 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4680-mayors-of-the-moon/,Bloodshot,"From the first song you know you're in good hands. Jon Langford's voice, coarse and charming, opens ""Drugstore"". The Sadies' clean acoustic guitars are all country, but Langford's Welsh accent and that hook in the melody hint at a pub ballad. Langford's narrative is full of fleeting images both warm and threatening-- from the date he's dragging onto the dancefloor, to some guy with a gun who's just walked in, to the sharp air and hints of terror outside. It's a night out at a bar with a seat inside Langford's head, and The Sadies fit the words like a dress shirt that cost a week's pay and only comes out Saturday night. The bandname, Langford and ""His"" Sadies, is, of course, a friendly joke: The Sadies are their own outfit, with several records to their name that hover around country/western but touch on everything from psych-rock to surf. They've also backed many vocal talents, from 50s R&B cult singer Andre Williams to everyone's favorite redheaded chanteuse, Neko Case. Guitarist Dallas Good has even played with members of Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Toronto's finest surf band. As a support band, The Sadies know how to toe the line, and with Langford they forgo any genre-bending or simple fooling around that might distract us. So most of the music treads familiar ground, played well and only a little rowdy. The Sadies stomp down ""Up to My Neck in This"", on the lefty tirade ""American Pageant"" their guitars are brash and vicious. Occasional member Critter shows up on vibes and percussion, putting extra resonance on ballads like ""Little Vampires"", while guest Bob Egan's pedal steel-- especially gorgeous on ""Looking Good for Radio"" and ""Are You an Entertainer?""-- adds a soar and shimmer that tugs the heartstrings. The only thing that lets them down are the songs. These guys have plenty to say, but as the album plays, it becomes less captivating and more by-the-numbers. Putting The Mekons and Waco Brothers singer Jon Langford in front of Toronto's rising alt-country stars looks great on paper-- and typical for a disc from Bloodshot Records, the atmosphere's cozy and the playing's impeccable. Yet there are few sparks, and nothing is really exceptional. Langford and the band wrote all-new material, but it actually sounds less personal than if they'd stuck to good covers. Even their most exotic song, ""Shipwreck"", feels like just another dreamy lost-at-sea ballad. (Though Sally Timms' guest vocals sure are pretty.) The most career-average contribution comes from Langford. There's no doubting his cred in either rock or alt-country, after twenty-five years of ""anything goes"" anarcho-rock with The Mekons and his work in cowpunk band The Waco Brothers. And while much has been made of whether his Welsh accent belongs in North American country music, he proves yet again that his rough-timbred working man's rasp couldn't be more suited to belting out songs about work, despair, and opposition to the Bush administration. Langford gets angry, though here he only bares his teeth fleetingly, spitting out the horrific imagery of ""American Pageant"". He also gets sad, though he never hits a true gutbucket wallow; ""Little Vampires"" doesn't wrench the heart, nor does ""Looking Good for Radio"" feel like a deep admission of flaws. (The ""'Change must come'/ Can you break this twenty?"" line is just plain hammy.) More than anything, Langford comes off as a wayward if loveable uncle; his words are good but rarely cutting, and by the closing number-- ""Are You an Entertainer?"", a song about the grinds of the touring life-- the album itself has ground to a halt. Mayors of the Moon is in no way a bad record-- every performance is solid and the recording sparkles-- but it doesn't quite meet its potential. The challenge of this collaboration seems to have driven everyone involved to make safe decisions instead of taking risks or letting in a little sloppiness, and that's the last thing you'd expect from these guys.

Sleep and Release,Aereogramme,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01a13d19756521382d5/1:1/w_160/c3fea3f9.jpg,2003-03-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/63-sleep-and-release/,Matador,"Get ready, brothers and sisters and gender-assignees in the void, for a barrage of hyperbolic hypotheses: What if Radiohead got guitar-happy with U2-ish heft? What if The Flaming Lips stopped making nerd anthems for interplanetary Olympics? What if Mercury Rev included a post-Pixies scream-blast for every wince-worthy wuss-warble? What if Mogwai hired a vocalist who sounded like an imp cowering in an attic? What if Sigur Rós were a rock band already? What if Built to Spill were from Glasgow? What if Weezer and Björk hopped in the same teleporter and got blended into a grotesque, mood-disordered Brundlefly act? Without an inkling of conscious mimicry, Aereogramme are almost the answer to these questions on their revelatory, if somehow pompous, sophomore release, a thunder-bunny of a long-player with ambition rivaling that of their fellow murderous Scot, Macbeth. In fact, they so gracefully shift from lilt to conflagration that you wish they'd team up with certain fellow countrymen to form the ominous low-end supergroup Belle & The Bastards. I don't want to contribute to the way Aereogramme got typecast as a two-trick pony based on A Story in White, because they cease to be quiet/loud dualists on Sleep and Release, despite the hibernation-and-catharsis connotations of its title. In fact, the listener feels like a Jurassic Park lab technician unable to chronicle a wayward experiment's swift evolution; Aereogramme lurches spastically from dated electronica (cough, industrial) to rock to folk to symphony to-- The band purportedly was inspired by dark DVDs they watched on tour, resulting in what the press kit calls the album's ""deeply cinematic structure."" Whatever. That sounds like the logic of the film Instinct (a pajamas-and-vodka classic if you haven't seen it), in which Anthony Hopkins watches apes and therefore takes on their attributes. It's best if you avoid frontman Craig B's non-album musings; the didact tends to speak in manifestos that make his fans imagine Ian MacKaye wanting to change the world by starting Smashing Pumpkins. All you need to know is that this disc is hugely impressive and brimming with old-fashioned passion so earnest it's embarrassing, though occasionally the serene moments feel a li'l ziplocked, like a staged public service announcement of undying love. Don't be turned off by the radio-ready production: In less than four minutes, ""Indiscretion #243"" sprints from its introductory straight-outta-Doolittle bassline, into a jam that would inspire a Social Distortion air-guitar stance in a comatose nun, then it permutates into a R.E.M-Document/Green breakdown complete with Automatic for the People organ, then it goes choral (!), then metal again, then it becomes an ambient piece with the first of many fascinating spoken-word samples (the best of which are a hyperventilating evangelist and an answering machine message that begs, ""Get in touch with me, please, please, I need your help""). Again, that's only the first song on a disc that intermittently sounds like four discs on shuffle, or a spliced talent/variety show at the coolest arena-themed bar in the world. The optimism of the Fridmanniana can mask the despondent lyrics. At one point, Craig B sings, ""It's time to follow the black path/ Come tomorrow, you won't laugh,"" and then he adds, arrhythmically and all muffled, as if it were a useless afterthought: ""At love."" Elsewhere he intones, ""The reason we're all disfigured/ I'll say it again/ The reason we're all disappointed/ Is innocence lost."" These are the better moments on a record that at (orchestral) times can be cheesier than a mattress full of feta. But all is forgiven due to the sheer ass-kick that predominates the rest. This band can compete with collossae of the current heavy-vogue such as Isis or Queens of the Stone Age; cue up or download ""No Really, Everything's Fine"" right now and behold the guitars that reveal every cliched way that verbiage (""buzzsaw thud!"") fails to convey the adrenal onslaught of expertly multitracked axe-abuse. This song's chunky explosions are the holy mother of fuckscum scraped from the charred frame of the Ford Abomination, the SUV whipped up specially for Satan. Okay, so I'm the first to confess that ""Yes"" is Everclear-esque. Okay, so the unfortunate major-label grunge font on the cover does not do justice to a band who have upstaged their whole discography, even their Fukd-series disc for Chemikal Underground. Okay, so ""A Winter's Discord"", in title and execution, is awful Queensrÿchian. Okay, so the untitled finale is Mogwai doing a Braveheart score before it ends in a moist sizzle that suggests electric rain. Okay, so cynics will not get caught up in Aereogramme's sweep. But the bold remainder of you, I envy. You're about to witness the aural equivalent of time-lapse tide changes. You're about to see where purgation and authenticity meet manipulation and spectacle. I wish I could be you, hearing this CD for the first time, hosting the inner battle: ""Yo, this stuff's belabored."" ""Yo, this stuff's beautiful."" ""Yo, this stuff's pretentious.""

Lou B's Wasted Pieces: 87-93,Sentridoh,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a6c0084474cd0c02f4/1:1/w_160/df200822.jpg,2003-11-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7072-lou-bs-wasted-pieces-87-93/,Shrimper,"Cassette-only releases available via mail order from companies known only through zine advertisements... there's something so wonderfully quaint about the whole notion. What was it like to search so hard to find music during this time, when economy of scale meant investing in a dual-well deck and dubbing a run of tapes in your spare time? It really wasn't so long ago that such tapes were a path to a genuine underground, but it feels like another lifetime. I was there, I guess, but somehow it seems like something my parents told me about. In this marginal world of indie cassette releases, a world that has never registered even the slightest blip on the radar of the average pop culture consumer, Lou Barlow was king. Barlow first released cheaply recorded and mastered four-track material as Sebadoh, chose the name Sentridoh for his solo material once Sebadoh became a proper band, and also dabbled under his given name. All told, Barlow released a lot of material on cassettes and singles in the late 80s and early 90s, during the time before he obtained any kind of profile with The Folk Implosion or Sebadoh after it became a proper indie rock band. I'm only now starting to get a handle on how prolific Barlow was. I consider myself a fan, but after listening to Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93, a collection of stray tracks and the previously released Wasted Pieces cassette, I realize I don't know the half of it. I was amazed to find zero overlap with either The Original Losing Losers or Lou Barlow and His Sentridoh, two long albums that have something like 55 songs between them. All this Sentridoh material is in addition to the four-track stuff Lou released as the pre-rock Sebadoh-- and to think that there are at least two other full-length Sentridoh CDs out there somewhere. How did Barlow do it? Well, the trick was, most of what he released wasn't very good. A significant portion of the songs that found release during this time were either unformed, one-take songs, or dippy tape experiments. The usual method for putting together records, this idea of combing through a stack of recordings, working to find the quality tracks, and mulling how they might best be presented, was of no interest to Barlow whatsoever with Sentridoh. His four-track aesthetic during this time was the musical equivalent of automatic writing: just fling every last scrap out into zineland and let the listener do the work of making sense of it. It might sound careless and indulgent, but it was an aesthetic that happened to yield some oddly arresting artifacts. There's a ""1 + 1 = 3"" kind of thing happening with Lou Barlow's home recorded music, and I've always enjoyed this stuff more than I should. Part of it is the powerful melancholy mood that floats through the recordings. No matter what sort of songs Barlow is doing-- joke tracks, misguided attempts at avant-garde sound manipulation, heartfelt confessional ballads-- they wind up sounding like the work of a lonely, depressive guy who smokes entirely too much weed. Barlow was obsessed with bodily fluids and disgusted with himself, and the records tended to have the dank, poorly lit atmosphere of a lived-in room in need of care. If you've ever spent a sad evening alone and thought to yourself, ""Maybe I'll feel better if I take a hit and put on some music,"" you can understand the world of Lou Barlow. Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93 has the cotton-mouthed, blunted folk vibe that Barlow essentially perfected, but the ratio of memorable songs to failed experiments is even lower than usual. There are 31 tracks here, but you would have to live with this CD for a hell of a long time before you could pick more than a couple out of a lineup. ""Nitemare"" is a great little song, the kind of simple acoustic pop that shows Barlow really did listen closely to Joni Mitchell's Blue. And I honestly think the shockingly effective ""Organ"", which later found release on the Kids soundtrack as ""Raise the Bells"" (there is a different song here with the same title), is a brilliant piece of drone music as dreamy and potent as any Boards of Canada instrumental. There are a few other highlights, but mixed between are too many mangled tape collages, too many spoken word interludes, and too many songs that don't so much go nowhere as not ""go"" period. Lou B's Wasted Pieces is an interesting time capsule, perhaps, but it's well down the list of Barlow's four-track product.","Cassette-only releases available via mail order from companies known only through zine advertisements... there's something so wonderfully quaint about ...

North,Elvis Costello,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67513d19756521391b8/1:1/w_160/b840dcbe.jpg,2003-11-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1623-north/,Deutsche Grammophon,"Few musicians have made such successful careers as Elvis Costello by confounding expectations. His epic discography seems to dutifully cover virtually every genre (excluding hip-hop, thankfully): From the ska-inflected wit of his debut, My Aim Is True, to the Byrdsian rock bombast of Armed Forces, to King of America's stripped down Americana, Costello has painted himself as something of a reclusive, embittered Bowie-- a songwriting chameleon given more to political discourse than grandiose, caricatured personas. Unfortunately, with each passing year, his wide-ranging ambitions seem to become more of a nuisance than an inspirational creative light. Costello has always seemed to have a difficult time reconciling the critic in him with the artist, and it speaks volumes that one of his most inspired moments of late took place not in the studio, but at a desk: His Vanity Fair article Rocking Around the Clock was an immensely enjoyable, meticulously documented, hour-by-hour blueprint for an ideal full day of binge music listening. In a rare moment, Costello flashed his true inner manically-obsessive-music-dork nature. Of course, he's taken the time to entertain many of his inner music critic's fantasies over the years, as well, and while some of these indulgences have struck musical paydirt, his diverse ambitions have often come at the cost of his music's consistency, and have largely muddied the proverbial waters of his aesthetic voice over the years. Unfortunately, North, Elvis Costello's 24th (yes, 24th) album is among his least inspiring to date. Conceptually, the album should have been a knockout. Costello's music has always fared best when its arrangements were stripped to their bare essentials, creating an intimate space for his wry voice, witty narratives and poignant melodies. And while Costello saw success with his landmark ""intimate"" guitar album, 1985's King of America, he'd never before made a sister album for it, of piano-based material. Costello's piano songs, like the pensive, yearning ""Almost Blue"" (from 1982's abstract pop masterpiece Imperial Bedroom) and the gently heroic ""Shipbuilding"" (off 1983's Punch the Clock) have accounted for some of the most moving and inspired moments of his career. The only catch with North is that Costello seems less concerned with presenting a collection of melodically clever and empathetic songs filled with his trademark sense of irony and double-entendre than with recording an album for the classical and jazz elites. In other words, it looks like the result of self-conscious pandering to his inner music critic. Note that Costello inexplicably released the album on the acclaimed classical label, Deutsche Grammophon (the beaming yellow of the label's logo jumps out ridiculously against the sharp gray contrasts of the album art), and while he might gain ""street cred"" amongst the classical music in-crowd with this move, the result makes for his least compelling work yet. North may be better understood as a stylistic experience than as a musical one: Costello has eschewed all sense of melody and humor in favor of rambling, mock-jazz noodling. Where Costello matched the sparse arrangements of his jazz-influenced classic ""Almost Blue"" with the nuanced simplicity of standards like ""Body and Soul"", North defies this simple beauty as one long drab exercise. Fortunately, the album does find some saving grace in the iconic marvel of Costello's voice. His delivery here sounds like a rich, thick slab of wet red paint, adding rich texture and depth to the dim gray backdrop of his accompaniment. Also, touches of classic Costello rear their head every now and again; especially on the yearning nostalgia of ""Fallen"" (""I believed that life was wonderful, right up to the moment when love went wrong"") and ""I'm in the Mood Again"", the elegant, wondrous love song set amidst New York City which closes the album. Still, from the melodramatic opener ""You Left Me in the Dark"" (sample lyric: ""You left me standing alone/ Although I thought that we could not be parted""), notes tumble on ad infinitum, leading nowhere and standing in direct contrast to their meticulously crafted maudlin surroundings. The sentimental ""When Did I Stop Dreaming"" offers a possible excuse for the album's unrelentingly dim mood: If Costello has indeed become paralyzed with cynicism as signified by the lyric, ""Pardon me, if I seem distant and strange/ Just tell me when did I stop dreaming?"", it makes sense that this batch of songs reeks of such icy indifference. It could be said that part of what makes Elvis Costello such a shape-shifting artist is his unrelenting determination to capture the everlasting beauty he sees within the material of his favorite songwriters. It's a cruel irony that, as he grows older and aims higher, he only falls further away from himself and fails more profoundly at grasping that elusive quality.","Few musicians have made such successful careers as Elvis Costello by confounding expectations.

Rethinking the Weather,Daedelus,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8759d034d5c69bf3a4c/1:1/w_160/4a136416.jpg,2003-11-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2130-rethinking-the-weather/,Mush,"I've made enough ill-advised purchases to recognize that it's common practice for artists to release instrumental hip-hop albums, stripping away the vocals and selling rappers' souls to throngs of incompetent DJs. That's why the new Daedelus album is a little perplexing: It's a ""rethinking"" of this year's The Weather, an album that found Busdriver and Radioinactive unleashing arrhythmic non-sequiturs and product placement over Daedelus' harp-filling, beat-killing wingtip hip-hop. The first sound on the new album is a sample: ""We broke up because there were intergroup pressures and it was an experiment"" (okay, it was on the original album, too, but still-- the first thing you hear?!). We should probably take this with a grain of salt, as Daedelus is more a sardonic Santa Monica loafer than a 50 Cent, but we can probably safely assume someone's a little bitter. To ignore this possibly fictional animosity for a moment, The Weather's beats were actually pretty inspired, especially given that Daedelus was an IDM artist sampling ultra-vintage 78s for the Plug Research label long before he ever attempted a project like this one. In retrospect, though, The Weather seems a cage, wherein a dejected Daedelus was enslaved in order to prevent overshadowing the vocalists. ""Rethinking"" is when a loophole in the hip-hop bureaucracy accidentally let loose a lunatic whose only munitions are his attention deficit disorder and a vast reservoir of every type of pop music since 1920. I have neither the patience nor intelligence to compare every new version of The Weather with the Rethinking version. Suffice to say, the ""rethinks"" are basically little more than extravagant versions of the old ones (which means on the remix album, there's great music and starving tedium in roughly equal proportions). The music consists of little kids' playground games, 60s saccharine pop, and those harp-and-strings passages that always mean Jimmy Stewart's about to have yet another bad dream. ""Chorus, Verse, Chorus"" is a full Japanese torch song protected by the sort of blaxploitation sword-funk that RZA would be proud of. ""Dark Days"" is a 60s girl band interspersed with the kind of silly jams those kids from Peanuts would always stumble around to. These kinds of songs are simultaneously bizarre, obscene, and pretty damn stupid, together forming my definition of ""mildly amusing."" But sometimes the formula lunges into ""masterpiece"" status: the classic ""Greatly Exaggerated, Our Demise"" layers reggae, James Brown-style yelps, children's jump-rope rhymes, and 50s easy listening, ending up somewhere between a Jamaican prison's carousel and the appliance section at Sears. While even this kind of music is a little grittier than Daedelus' 2002 solo release Invention, if not as complex, elsewhere Daedelus vigorously fights the power like a homeless Def Jux producer. Hip-hop doesn't get much more abrasive than ""Missing"", which is about as dirty as shuffling across a freeway wearing nothing but soup cans. Unfortunately, on more traditional hip-hop tracks, like ""Robotic Girls Are Hard"", everything is tempered by his patented toy pianos and orchestration-- and by the time it rolls around, it no long seems either innovative or particularly affecting. Occasionally, the musical jokes don't exactly pay off: ""Name Game""'s potion of mentally challenged children samples and dense, claustrophobic rhythm ain't exactly gonna frighten DJ Shadow's ""The Number Song"". This is an exception, though. Usually the jokes are actually more entertaining than the music they produce. ""Bright Stars"" commences with a paralyzing rocket launch and all manner of crazy sci-fi samples until the whole track gets whisked away into whistling, charming exotica, far more appropriate for your grandfather's shuffleboard club than a psychedelic journey into the cosmos. Conversely, in ""Hardly Hip-Hop"", a middle-class family encounters an unexpected dinner guest who just happens to be a gale of shattering static in a French police state. Monty Python didn't even take the joke that far. There isn't really much of a comparison between this and The Weather; one is intended as a sort of supplement to the rappers (maybe a complement in the perfect rapocracy), while the other has nothing to rely on but itself. At the same time, there's enough overlap that you should probably pick one or the other. Basically it comes down to which you like more: lyrics or rule-breaking polyphony.","I've made enough ill-advised purchases to recognize that it's common practice for artists to release instrumental hip-hop albums ...

"Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief",Thunderbirds Are Now!,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a869ea9e61561daa57f6/1:1/w_160/9b285a0f.jpg,2003-11-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8243-doctor-lawyer-indian-chief/,Action Driver,"How do you know a group of musicians have violently overestimated their sense of humor? Well, they could form a band and call it Thunderbirds Are Now!; they could record an album and call it Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief; they could open said album with a 19-second skit entitled ""KGB Phone Sexxx"", with a girl named Jane speaking what is purported to be Russian; and/or they could spend more time composing song titles than songs themselves, coming up with non-hilarities like ""Not Witherspoon, but Silverstone"" and ""When It Comes to Elements, Hydrogen Is Titz"". The songs are spaz-punk shot through with bouncy synths. The musicians wear their attention deficit on their sleeves, picking up and discarding riffs and rhythms as they please. Ironically, they end up sounding monotonous: almost every song crescendos into the same jackrabbit epiphany, teeters for a while at 200+ bpm, and topples. I'm aware of a certain nu-spaz scene out there, and some of it sounds pretty potent. Sick Lipstick, for instance, make silly-squally thrash in time signatures even they don't know, and An Albatross are to Zappa what grappa is to wine (which is to say, a terse essence). At best, this sort of stuff has an ability to leave you dizzy and panting-- unsure what the fuck's just happened. Thunderbirds-- on this record, at least-- are not nearly unhinged enough to pull this off; far from dangerous, they simply come across as unpleasantly mathy. Here's what they don't know about themselves: they're actually unintentionally a fantastic new wave band stuck in a twitching spazcore body. Disregard the time-change madness and consider their Action Driver labelmates (which include unapologetic new wavers Radio Berlin), and Thunderbirds almost begin to sound different by proxy. ""Pink Motorcycle Helmet"" could, for all intents and purposes, be the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, down to resident screamer Ryan Allen's voice. Elsewhere, ""Party A.R.M."" plays it relatively straight for 2:08, and ""Who Wants to Fight?"" is 70s glam strut ripped apart and randomly stapled back together. Every other guitar- and synth-line these guys toss about so nonchalantly would be enough to build a single around, and if it's not ADD that's keeping Thunderbirds from doing just that, I guess it's the misplaced integrity or sheer delight in musicianship. I never thought I would emphatically advice a punk band to dumb it down, but Thunderbirds Are Now! could use a lobotomy, a Zen retreat, a major-label deal, or Meg White on drums.","How do you know a group of musicians have violently overestimated their sense of humor?

Rock N Roll,Ryan Adams,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a000ea9e61561daa447b/1:1/w_160/8d459738.jpg,2003-11-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/40-rock-n-roll/,Lost Highway,"The story of Ryan Adams' artistic decline is currently approaching epic, a long, complicated tale of public cockiness, big mouth bravado, and exasperated recordings: his churlish, fuck-off swagger was silly from the start, but Adams' self-satisfied smirk has got nothing on his newfound capacity to eschew every last one of his songwriter's instincts. Now, with a discography that's wiggling towards infamy, Adams shoots up one last middle finger to the slowly dispersing crowd. It's admittedly unfair that Ryan Adams has been forced to spend most of his songwriting career cowering in the shadow of his much-beloved solo debut, enduring loads of (unfavorable) critical comparisons to his younger, more inspired self. Adams' spiral into self-indulgence has triggered plenty of sputtering, red-faced indignation, and if it weren't for the lingering resonance of 2000's Heartbreaker, chances are nobody would care that each of Adams' subsequent efforts has lacked a certain quiet grace. Ultimately, the problem isn't knee-jerk alt-country purists getting pissed about Adams' penchant for electric guitars, or cred-obsessed indie kids hollering about Gap commercials, it's Adams' newfound incapacity (or refusal) to write a song with any acceptable degree of sincerity-- and knowing that he probably could really stings. Adams' latest, Rock N Roll, feels sloppy and stupidly rushed; recorded in less than two weeks, the record is so blatantly dismissive of both itself and its audience that it insults nearly everyone who attempts to interact with it. Adams' original scheduled-for-2003 release, the largely anticipated Love Is Hell, was clumsily manhandled by Lost Highway labelheads before finally being split into two separate EPs (respectively subtitled Part I and Part II; Part I was released simultaneously with this album), leaving Adams a comparably small window of time in which to record the proper follow-up to 2001's bloated-but-redeemable Gold. Still: it didn't have to be this way. Here, Adams stuffs the contemporary radio-rock cannon with more overblown, riff-heavy regurgitation, most of which is either painfully generic or preposterously derivative (the buoyant ""Anybody Wanna Take Me Home"" cops loosely from The Smiths; ""So Alive"" is karaoke U2; ""1974"" is an uncomfortable Bon-Jovi-meets-The-Stooges homage). The entire record reeks of late new-wave/80s rock cribbing, and consequently, it's difficult to write about without duly repeating a laundry list of influences: Adams' muses range from predictable (see Joy Division, Paul Westerberg) to bizarre (Adams quasi-mimics the prog diddlings of Rush on the forensically titled ""Luminol"", and ends up with a song that sounds a lot like rehashed Oasis). Suddenly, the record's opening couplet-- ""Let me sing a song for you/ That's never been sung before""-- seems vaguely humiliating. It's not so much that Rock N Roll is incorrigibly written as that the record is unforgivably careless, unwilling to commit to anything including itself. Each phoned-in track boasts a new kind of lame production (including plenty of weird vocal echoes), tired lyrics (""You're taking me higher than I've been before""), overstated guitar-rock noodling, and unbearably repetitive amp assaults-- combined, they successfully obscure any kernels of ingenuity that might have been buried beneath the buzz. Adams' definition of rock and roll has always been cartoonish (jean jackets, American flags, bar flitting, surly public appearances), but Rock N Roll's interpretation of its namesake officially approaches ridiculous. In all likelihood, Adams would like for you to think his flippancy is intentional, and for everybody to grin and chalk up his cocky half-assing to more authentic rock and roll behavior. In this, Adams is insistent: just as he did with Gold, Adams includes liner note photos of tattoos and cigarettes to remind us that he's badass, confirming the characterization with a handful of lazily sprung expletives (including the unconvincing ""It's all a bunch of shit.../ It's totally fucked up"" of ""Wish You Were Here""), some clever allusions to chemical abuse (""And if I could have my way/ We'd take some drugs""), and an embarrassingly obvious I'm-friends-with-The-Strokes aside (booming opener ""This Is It""). Possibly the best thing about ""Rock N Roll"" is how girlfriend Parker Posey is credited in the liner notes as ""Exe'cute'ive Producer,"" appearing ""courtesy of her bad self."" At least being precious is being honest. There are some curious guest turns (Billie Joe Armstrong inexplicably pops up, and Melissa Auf Der Maur provides background vocals on a handful of tracks, as does Posey), but Adams is almost always at his best when he's on his own and thinks no one else is looking: the album's title track is a sweet piano ballad, his plaintive wail layered nicely over fuzzy snippets of found sound. Lasting less than two minutes, ""Rock N Roll"" is (check the glaring irony!) also the record's least self-conscious song, a flash of earnestness that disappears almost before you notice its arrival. You have to angle Rock N Roll up to a mirror in order to read the cover text properly, and, in a way, the inherent fallacy of a mirror image is also the very best metaphor for this record: Rock N Roll is backwards Ryan Adams, one-dimensional, vain, and entirely lifeless.","The story of Ryan Adams' artistic decline is currently approaching epic, a long, complicated tale of public cockiness, big mouth ...

The Bootleg of the Bootleg EP,Jean Grae,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf83eb335119a49ed229/1:1/w_160/d67f99bc.jpg,2003-11-09 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3539-the-bootleg-of-the-bootleg-ep/,Babygrande,"One of the special features on the anniversary DVD of Scarface taps into classic whitey dread: a Def Jam-produced minfomerical in which mainstream rap stars make a case for Tony Montana's sainthood, claiming him as the street equivalent of a traditional comic book hero. Jean Grae may traffic in ""gangsta"" tropes, but she also subverts them by taking a galactic (as opposed to merely earth- or hood-bound) view of materialism and depression. Born in South Africa, but raised in New York by her musician parents, Tsidi Ibrahim's current stage name (she initially went by What?What?) is based on the telekinetic comic book character Jean Grey (the one Famke Janssen plays in the films about the co-ed, non-Shabazz-affiliated assembly of mutants called X-Men). Grey's tragic mythos involves being soul-trapped in a kind of womb in Jamaica Bay by an evil force that took over her body, almost destroyed the world, and then committed suicide. Grey was assumed dead, but she busted out of the womb-thing and got married, only to have to cope with her husband's being killed by a heavy heel named Apocalypse. The character's a fine match for Grae (though she threatens to change her name to Crystal Meth) because her material is obsessed with battling, mourning, self-murder, mind-weapons, alienation, and armageddon. Mr. Lif's labyrinthine concept album I, Phantom ended with an all-star, nuclear-devastation-hindsight jam entitled ""Post Mortem"" on which Grae upstages Lif, El-P, and Akrobatik: she regrets dying with a deficit of malice. If she'd known she was going to perish in a corporate-sponsored holocaust, she says she'd have taken pills, stolen guns, and assaulted women, concluding, ""I wish I'd done more sin.../ Let the devil come for me."" That darkness and despair continues throughout much of this ""EP"" (which, at 66 minutes, trumps My Morning Jacket's previous length record). Leadoff cut ""Hater's Anthem"" is unfortunate, with the dumb chorus, ""Fuck you fuck you fuck you hold up/ Fuck you fuck you fuck you wait nah/ Fuck you fuck you fuck you okay/ fuck you fuck you fuck you everybody."" Even the aping of Tony Montana by Scarface on the Geto Boys' ""Fuck 'Em"" was less creatively bankrupt, partially due to its propulsive samples; Grae, meanwhile, is hampered by soundscapes that recall the GZA/Genius formula: plodding beats matched with classical or keyboard-demo loops that never change. A last-will-and-testament song is guaranteed on Grae's releases, and her current entry, ""Take Me"", almost constitutes a self-read last-rites: though praying and using King Jamesian diction, Grae still begs to die (and yes, Notorious B.I.G. haunts the whole project, and is even overtly channeled). Don't fear the rapper: On ""Code Red"", love is dead. On ""My Crew"", rap is dead. On ""Swing Blades"", God is dead. The megamix ""Chapter One: Destiny"" begins with a choose-your-own-adventure killing spree, before spiraling into a cut-n-paste showcase of loose-style party grinds, older works (Natural Resource's ""Negro League Baseball""), and reappropriated (resurrected?) beats by such artists as Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, and Nas. This cavalcade dares to have fun. The previously-noted production limitations (man, some of this percussion is straight off the generic Drum Crazy series-- I've even dropped mad wackness over it!) are occasionally transcended by piercing soul samples that could provoke the listener to purchase all vinyl in sleeves that feature reclining Afro-sporters. The tension of the Wu-tro stuff serves Grae's unsettling vibe well, though, as she decries terrorism, militarism, commodity fetishism and nicotine, as well as her own masochism and schizophrenia, cramming more logos into a line than Bad Religion, all the while out-alluding MF Doom (reffing entities as disparate as Steve Buscemi, Born on the Fourth of July, and a crass spiritual cocktail that summons both Pascal's wager and Ned Flanders' scattershot approach). She knows she's impossible. In a rebuttal to critic Oliver Wang (whom she also disses in her liner notes, along with Northern State), she disqualifies herself from the roster of hip-hop gamepieces: ""Not a thug, not a drugseller, not a gunshooter/ Not a stripper, sex symbol or anything you're used to/ Marketing nightmare, I don't fit into categories/ I just rap, make beats, and shit and sleep all these stories."" This anxious rapper brags and then requests therapy; her closest historical complement would be the no-frills MC Lyte (because Grae has little in common with the regal poses of Miss Melodie and Queen Latifah, and even less to do with contemporary or old-school good-time girls). Grae's videos should feature refugees breakdancing while an Escalade outfitted with a weedeater plows through Gethsemane. These confrontational cries for help are worried woman blues.","One of the special features on the anniversary DVD of Scarface taps into classic whitey dread: a Def Jam-produced minfomerical ...

The Dirt Tier,Winfred E.

As if filing albums by bands like +/-, !!!, and Sunn O))) wasn't confusing enough, there are also more subtly deceptive bandnames out there lying in ambush. By now, everyone knows not to file Pink Floyd under ""F,"" but one could hardly be blamed heading to the ""Misc. E"" card with this disc, unaware that Winfred E. Eye is actually a band fronted by a guy named Aaron Calvert. I suppose it would be too perfect for music like this to be made by one person with such a fitting, sideshow-appropriate name, anyway. And I guess it's better (or at least less obvious) than any number of other suitable names, like, say, Tom Waits & The Bad Seeds. Calvert and his seven-man support corps camp out somewhere between the circus side tent, the witch trials, and the Mississippi Delta, and it winds up sounding something like what one imagines Mr. Waits might sound like with Blixa Bargeld, Kid Congo Powers, Mick Harvey and Warren Ellis backing him up. Calvert's voice isn't as grotesquely grizzled as Waits', but he works hard to get it there. Opener ""Run Along"", with its bone-room percussion and spookhouse organ, could practically pass for an outtake from Bone Machine if not for the lyrics, which steer far from Waits' twisted Cabinet of Dr. Caligari-esque surrealism and nighthawk poetry and instead come across like a homeless guy's diary entry. The title track lurches along on junkyard percussion and a slow and nasty blues lick that never changes once, while Calvert yowls like a dying smoker, wailing lines like, ""The germs all get eaten by the earthworms sitting on the dirt tier."" His lyrics are strange snapshots of ugliness, at times oppressively blunt. The gentle acoustic guitar and accordion arrangement of ""Grey Ghosts"" is counteracted with brutal lines like, ""Your tongue's in trouble for running your mouth/ Proof in your hands/ Fists in your mouth."" As good the music can be, The Dirt Tier suffers from a relentlessly slow pacing that only highlights the cartoonish violence of the lyrics, and its insistence on grit and filth too often feels affected. The reason Tom Waits gets away with stuff like this is that he sees the humor in it, and he plays his persona to the hilt, with delight, and that's one step this band will need to take if they're ever going to step out from under his shadow. For now, The Dirt Tier is the eccentricity without the personality to put it in context.","Pity the record store clerk.

Unknown Spin,Charalambides,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e6ea9e61561daa5483/1:1/w_160/4a75ec08.jpg,2003-11-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1733-unknown-spin/,Wholly OtherWholly Other,"Houston's Charalambides probably aren't providing the soundtrack to much other than their own meandering trip, but you could do a lot worse for yours than to let them in. There are scores of bands out there only too willing to let the tidal wave of fashion, bullshit trends and other cons of daily life niche them into your world. There are millions of CDs and MP3s out there to consume. At any given moment, you have access to so much music willing to play along to a numbing, corporate tune, and when I notice a band of minstrels so obviously anachronistic as this Texas trio, our mighty, muddy society's river seems all the more intimidating. Not that Tom and Christina Carter and Heather Leigh Murray are necessarily performing in protest. In fact, since 1991 their exploratory (or possibly just open-minded) brand of free-folk has been closer to the domain of daydreams than political statements, so maybe I'm just living vicariously through their utter refusal to embrace most aspects of the music business or consumer culture in general. Kranky's reissue of last year's Unknown Spin-- originally available as a split with Scorces (a Murray/Christina Carter duo project) via a limited pressing CD-R on their summer 2002 tour-- is like a lighthouse beacon for anyone sick of overkill in any respect. Improvisation plays a major role in Charalambides' music. Christina Carter's ghostly vocals drift through pieces like an autumn wind, without any particular place to go; Tom Carter and Murray's guitars draw from other notable non-scenesters like John Fahey and Richard Youngs, though Murray's steel keeps the music on Unknown Spin ever tied to classic blues and traditional American folk music. Despite having a knack for constructing bizarre tape collage experiments (as on parts of 1999's Houston) and psych-raga drone (1995's Market Square), their music seems tied to the magic of the moment-- that is, they're able to make massive statements in minimal folk seem like the offhanded storytelling of an ancient, knowing local. In both cases, simple pleasures rely on your willingness to sit back, listen and pay no mind to the distractions of the modern world. The title track is a very lengthy excursion into just the kind of rootless, rural escapism described above. Beginning with a faint, minor chord strumming from Tom Carter and Murray's discordant, distant pedal steel, I get the feeling that, for better or worse, I'm in it for the long haul. Sometimes, the steel guitar is content to moan in the background, other times it lapses into the front via tense, dissonant figures. When Tom's arpeggio figure picks up steam, Christina enters with a simple, repeated vocal tone. Murray occasionally echoes her calls with a similarly passive plea in the left channel. The trio is a model of spacious, free co-existence, and you'd do pretty well to avoid the charms of their hypnosis. ""Unknown Spin"" progresses like a drop of milk in water; expanding slowly into countless intricate patterns, each a fascinating exercise in the holy schemata of nature. However, when the piece ends and I back away, it all seems one large, cloudy memory; the thrill of the moment as distant as a hundred year-old photograph. If there's one problematic aspect of Charalambides' sound, it's that some of their songs blend together so well that they run a risk of being indistinct from one another. Moments on Unknown Spin-- such as ""Magnolia"", which begins similarly to ""Unknown Spin"", with Tom's laidback electric guitar strum and Murray again entering on the left with delicate, deep single-note pedal steel lines-- could be interchanged from song to song. Of course, when the results are so consistently spellbinding, I'm not likely to complain. ""Skin of Rivers"" does distinguish itself very nicely with the vocals of Christina Carter and Murray, sounding eerily like witches long since removed from casting curses, and content to fade away in the mist. For about five minutes, only the two female voices sound against each other-- though often so perfectly in unison as to simulate sine waves. When Tom Carter's guitar appears from the center, trembling restlessly, the effect is almost that of elation, despite the overall volume never rising above a whisper. Unknown Spin was recorded live in the studio, and as such, is a more straightforwardly folky sound for Charalambides than some of their other releases (most notably, the spooky, majestic Houston). I'm tempted to say it isn't necessarily the best starting place for the uninitiated because of its rather Spartan arrangement. However, I also get the feeling that its journeys are essentially the heart of Charalambides' music under any guise, and the real key is in your willingness to see them through. I wonder how many CDs ask so much of a listener, and if fewer still are able to deliver as much solemn resonance. In this case, patience and clarity pay in weightless shards of beauty.","Houston's Charalambides probably aren't providing the soundtrack to much other than their own meandering trip, but you could ...

Songs from the Black Mountain Music Project,Ginger Brooks TakahashiMirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c354c0084474cd0c3444/1:1/w_160/a8922950.jpg,2003-11-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5330-songs-from-the-black-mountain-music-project/,K,"The general consensus on Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn seems to be that one day she will make a great album. We know she has it in her, because she's let her cards show once-- with ""Cold Cold Water"", an unhinged, vertiginous, epic single that easily one-upped The Flaming Lips in orchestral bombast and yet remained intimate as a whisper. That song was a revelation; I feel reasonably safe claiming that it sounded like nothing anyone had recorded before, save Ennio Morricone as the obvious influence. Shockingly, Mirah and her producer-cum-Microphones-bandmate Phil Elvrum blew right past their own brilliance-- the rest of that album (2002's Advisory Committee) ping-ponged listlessly from coffeehouse folk to rickety lo-fi electro and back. So, does this new offering from Mirah deliver on that semi-accidental promise? As you can probably glean from its somewhat unwieldy billing and workmanlike title, it's not meant to. It's a 28-minute sound collage that nestles five or six songs among freeform instrumentals, unprocessed ideas and found sounds. Songs from the Black Mountain comes weighted with tons of extraneous circumstance-- Mirah recorded it with her friend Ginger Brooks Takahashi during a 30-day stay in a mountain town, presumably on portable equipment; its proceeds go to charities like the Rock'n'Roll Camp for Girls. In short, this record all but begs not to be judged as a proper album. I don't know what's at the root of this need to bury songs in ephemera, but it's beginning to look a lot like fear of responsibility. I hated wading through the muck of The Microphones' Song Islands for morsels of Elvrum's wan songwriting; solo Mirah at her best is so much better than Elvrum that it makes her worst that much more frustrating. To demonstrate what I mean, let's just get it over with and divide the album in two segments which, for easier reference, we'll call ""songs"" and ""other shit."" Songs: ""The Knife Thrower"": a gently perverse torch ballad reminiscent of Advisory Committee's ""The Garden"" and ""Light the Match"", wonderfully packed with such antique locutions as ""lark"" and ""asunder."" ""Life You Love"": a surprisingly straight-faced bluegrass number, with stuttering banjo on a bed of languid lap steel, and both women on vocals. ""Pure"": a minimal yet powerful melody built around one heartbreaking chord change, a whispery incantation of ""give in"" and precisely applied touches of ambiance both natural and industrial. The album's tentpole. ""Rock of Ages"": sung a capella, aside from a couple of fleeting piano chords, with the friends' voices double- and triple-tracked into a complicated choral arrangement. ""Oh! September"": pure fun, with doo-wop vocals that actually go ""doo-wop,"" and an honest-to-goodness surf guitar. Somewhat reminiscent of her recent brilliant Ragazza Pop compilation contribution, ""Don't"". A special bonus for rhyming ""baby"" with ""ukulele."" Other Shit: ""Lil' Bit"": a minute of guitar noodling. ""Birdy Noises"": noises akin to those made by birds. ""Plink Plink Plink"": as advertised. ""The Red Curtain"": actually quite decent, with Eastern chimes and a jerky accordion. ""The Party"": steel drums over a static cello riff. ""Noisy Groove"": 21 seconds of backwards noise. ""Plink Plink"": not to be confused with ""Plink Plink Plink"". Actually, go ahead. ""Broken Mirah"": a tape loop. ""Acoustic Groove"": guitar, timidly plucked. ""Horny Groove"": alas, a pun on ""horns."" ""Squocky Groove"": a blaring sax. ""Buggy Noises"": noises akin to those made by bugs. I believe it goes without saying that, for Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn, coming up with that great album will be a matter of subtraction, not addition.

Bodysong,Jonny Greenwood,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfeaabf31b7dc71563a1/1:1/w_160/3b95eb67.jpg,2003-11-06 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3630-bodysong/,EMI,"CH-CHUNK. CH-CHUNK. When Radiohead burst into British and American living rooms in 1993 with their now infamous ode to alienation, ""Creep"", it was only Jonny Greenwood's frenetic guitar stabs that hinted at the inspired musical legacy of the band that would soon follow. They were two jagged electric spasms of sonic sledge that not only foreshadowed the majesty of the anthemic guitar-drenched chorus to come, but also marvelously served to heighten the emotional content of the song; in this case, the unbearable and mounting anger of the self-defeated and alienated. It was with those two bursts of distorted beauty that Jonny Greenwood scripted himself into the vocabulary of rock, and left his first mark on music history. It's no shock that Greenwood would become the first member of Radiohead to release solo work. Anyone who's witnessed the band's meticulous career-spanning live show could see that the Jonny Greenwood of 2003 is far more peripatetic than his early 90s counterpart. On stage, Greenwood jeers back and forth, alternating between crouching in front of his varied arsenal of effects (which includes a transistor radio, a vintage patchbay, a laptop, and a number of guitar pedals), to gently lilting in front of his Ondes-Martenot, to heroically pounding notes out of his trademark telecaster. Greenwood is the consummate rock multi-instrumentalist, and the music he has composed for Bodysong perfectly reflects this heterogeneous ambition. If Radiohead's Hail to the Thief suffered from being too scatterbrained, Greenwood's Bodysong-- composed for the nominal British documentary which details the ""experience of being human""-- strikes a perfect balance, channeling all his diverse influences into a single multifarious recording. The album's opener, ""Moon Trills"", marries pensive and melancholy piano chords reminiscent of Radiohead's ""Pyramid Song"" with swarming frenetic string swells, and weepy Ondes-Martenot accompaniment suggestive of the late French composer Olivier Messiaen's Ondes pieces, while ""Splatter"" comfortably melds together a frenzied Charles Mingus-inspired bass riff, a DJ Shadow-esque funk break, and Ornette Coleman-styled horn blurts. The movements that comprise Bodysong, despite having their own specific sonic identities, also possess an overwhelmingly organic presence; they seem to bleed into and alter one another. The meditative twilight of ""Moon Trills"", and its minute-long epilogue ""Moon Mall"", gives birth to the insistent reversed hi-hat loop which makes up ""Trench"". The polyrhythmic chaotic clatter of ""Convergence"", meanwhile, gives way to the casual bop of ""Nudnik Headache"", with its lazy drunken drum break, and queasy piano loop. The only aspect of Bodysong that's somewhat disappointing is the inconspicuous lack of guitar work. While guitars do show up on two of the tracks (the dubbed-out hallucinatory ""Clockwork Tin Soldiers"" and the fractured gloom of ""24 Hour Charleston""), most of Bodysong is made up of lushly ambient strings courtesy of The Emperor Quartet, and elaborate webs of percussion. This fact may be of little surprise given that Radiohead themselves have infamously eschewed guitars in favor of other musical approaches. However, those majestic guitar stabs still linger on: They're in the rolling electric fog of ""Clockwork Tin Soldiers"", the disjointed electronic pings of ""Moon Mall"", the frantically wailing horns of ""Splitter"", and the uneasy midnight shuffle of ""Nudnik Headache"".

"Broken Spirit, I Will Mend Your Wings",Soft Canyon,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6475e6ef95969320ccf/1:1/w_160/a1f09ca9.gif,2003-11-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7721-broken-spirit-i-will-mend-your-wings/,Alien8,"Despite everything my foster parents taught me in the formative stages of my life, I looked at the label before I listened to this album. I understand this is the most grievous sin a reviewer can wallow in. Tricky Woo, Andrew Dickson's old band, was one of the great maestros of Canadian nostalgaragic rock, shredding out dimebags of scalding calamity with the attention and maturity of guitar-wreathed pre-adolescents. So I was understandably frothing out of my pores when his new band, Soft Canyon, got signed to Alien8 Recordings, a triumphantly experimental label that's released everything from Keiji Haino to Francisco Lopez. This was truly going to be a melding of minds, my generation's version of the Yalta Convention, reassembling post-war Europe with the fury only experimental rock can muster! Basically, I fully expected the first track to be called ""Rock 'N Roll Lunar Orbit 89 dash Armageddon "" It is actually called ""For You"". I believe my response, if this transcript I'm holding is accurate, was, ""Oh."" Rather than impart any negative words to my cherished Alien8, I'm going to put the rest of this review in brackets so it will never hurt anyone ever again. Freud called this ""lying."" I call it ""a terrible idea."" [""For You"" starts with a zestful beat, drowsy back-up harmonies, and braiding guitar lines. Unfortunately, the chorus is one note pretending it's ten, with a brainless heavy-handedness that would be more appropriate on a Train (maybe Green Day) album, one of those songs written for imaginary bands in movies influenced by better bands. It's hardly even worth mentioning that the song is about ""magenta planes"" and ""ocean music from strings that never end."" (Apparently this is the indie rock version of rap songs professing their own potency. Please, bands, stop critiquing yourselves and taking away my money!) The one compelling aspect of the song is the looming guitar solos, occasionally venturing into a sonic unruliness somewhere between Tricky Woo and Kim Thayil. Later, ""Hope's Great Divide"" replicates an Abbey Road bridge that wasn't interesting enough for me to figure out which specific song it came from. ""Sunflight"" begins as two girthed chords as produced by Willie Mitchell, but unexpectedly develops into a subdued anthem. Discouragingly, that anthem seems to be ""Sunflight, stay with me tonight."" Dickson's vocals are either irksomely whiny or in a growl better suited to a fifth-wave jam band than these tight pop melodies. Elsewhere, though, these vagrant genres coagulate into a mighty devilish genre-meld. On ""Kaleidoscope Mountain"", evaporating surf-guitar, stiff drums, and exasperatingly childish keyboards bounce over rockabilly ska. I dislike pseudo-surrealistic lyrics and I dislike love lyrics even more, but I have been bombarded with enough Johnny Cash articles recently that I have found room in my cancerous heart for the chorus, ""I walked into a lake of fire... and washed my hands."" Of course, about halfway through it spontaneously decides it would rather be a Pink Floyd tune (and little more). They might not be engendering new avant-garde circles, but, come on, Pink Floyd was a pretty damn good band-- but not good enough that I could reasonably be expected to sit through seven minutes of ""We Threw Our Love into the Universe"", a song so utterly indebted to Pink Floyd (to the exclusion of all else, including other Floyd plagiarizers) that I have little incentive to finish this sentence. Soft Canyon make no attempts to deceive anyone. From the cover to the song titles, the aim of the album quite clearly seems to be to serve only as an assortment of rip-offs and homages (indistinguishable ones, at that) to Beach Boys-inflected sunshine-pop and doomed surrealistic spaz-metal. Admittedly, I'm very amenable to such combinations, but there's simply not enough here to differentiate Soft Canyon from the innumerable minions of Elephant 6-derived progeny.]","Despite everything my foster parents taught me in the formative stages of my life, I looked at the label before ...

Client,Client,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e4b1335d7bf1698f24/1:1/w_160/de590456.jpg,2003-11-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1731-client/,MuteToast Hawaii,"Client value their anonymity. As the first signing to Depeche Mode keyboardist and founding member Andy Fletcher's Toast Hawaii label, the two-woman band bill themselves as Client A and Client B and limit promotional photos to shots of their torsos and legs, decked out in matching outfits. They claim it's an attempt to place emphasis solely on their music-- which makes it just another in a series of anti-image images. It's sort of amusing that an up-and-coming synth-pop band on an indie label fashions itself as an alternative to what it sees as manufactured pop. I'm not sure that either Led Zeppelin spent a lot of time worrying about The Partridge Family, or that Client should be worried about poaching Jessica and Nick's potential fanbase, but we won't hold any of that against them. If you must know, Client are Kate Holmes (no, not that one) and Sarah Blackwood (yes, that one). Holmes is the musical brain, a former member of both Frasier Chorus and Technique, and the wife of former Creation Records boss Alan McGee. Blackwood is the Yorkshire-accented former singer from Dubstar, who scored a few minor hits in the mid-1990s, most notably ""Stars"" and ""Not So Manic Now"". (Ironically, considering all of Client's pop hand-wringing, the musical half of Dubstar, Steve Hiller, has moved into songwriting, recently penning a top five UK single with ex-Take That member Mark Owen.) Unfortunately, that anonymity that the members of Client are aiming for-- they're going to get it, because their nondescript, evasive approach to promotion spills over into their music. Neither off-putting nor engaging, Client's debut occupies a rather uninteresting place in electropop's soft middle. At its best, it hums along with a sort of detached glacial sheen, skipping along on pleasant beats and tones, a healthy dose of attitude, and a bed of charming, jaunty singles. Too much of the time it comes off as a bit waterlogged because of its lack of sonic or vocal range. Blackwood's still-charming vocals are at their best when Client walk the fine line of detailing the life out on the dark, unsettling underbelly of cityscapes, like a less floral, more feminized Brett Anderson. In album opener/mission statement ""Client"", the band warns lays out their raison d'etre, intoning a series of catchphrases such as ""We never say no"" and ""Satisfaction guaranteed."" This sort of erotic cabaret act doesn't encroach on Peaches' shock-jock territory-- it explores eroticism rather than wields it as a weapon. At their best, Client explore sex (""Price of Love""), drugs (""Pills""), and rock and roll (""Rock and Roll Machine"") with cool, calculated precision. Some critics may sneer at Blackwood's coming ""late"" to the electropop game, but her warm Northern vocals suit the sound. Comparisons to Ladytron and Adult. may be inevitable, but Client aren't as biting or melodically thrilling as either group. Still, this is a decent start-- both for the band and Fletcher's label.","Client value their anonymity.

Balance,Akrobatik,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03513d1975652138322/1:1/w_160/3bcd20ff.jpeg,2003-05-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/90-balance/,Coup D'etat,"Six years ago, KRS-One started HipHop Appreciation Week to ""decriminalize HipHop's public image and promote the unity of HipHop Kulture."" Since then, events have been held in cities across America, from New York to San Francisco, to appreciate hip-hop and hopefully subvert some of the dickwads in the conservative media that continue to paint hip-hop culture as the sole root of our country's moral decline. It's a noble cause-- one that promotes KRS' ongoing devotion to ""edutainment"" and gets communities involved in the four elements-- and respect is due. However, I think they need some people working on the public imaging over there at the Temple of HipHop, 'cause this year, the theme is... ""responsibility!"" Now. While I'm all for behaving responsibly and not painting hip-hop in a bad light by, like, bumping Outkast out my boombox while shoplifting or something, there hasn't been a wonkier, more awkward theme for a positive event since Back to the Future's ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" prom motto. Responsibility. Since when did I go back to kindergarten? Was this in the syllabus? And most importantly, I thought we were gonna be getting some ""tainment"" with our ""edu."" Initially, I was feeling the same incredulity towards KRS collaborator Akrobatik's second record, which is titled, simply, Balance, and comes jam-packed with laidback, conscious, message-driven hip-hop. But where I expected raps about yoga or the medicinal benefits of yerba mate tea, I got: ""Ring the sweat out ya pores when you done with these verbal calisthenics"" and ""When I kick intricate shit you get intimate witchya brain."" Even when I thought Akrobatik (aka ""the black action figure with the kung fu grip"") might start to get preachy about his responsible way of life, he instead spat, ""I don't waste my time writin' ignorant rhymes, but I know that makin' niggas laugh ain't no crime."" (Friends at Temple of HipHop, please take note.) The Boston lyricist's themes are all fairly simple-- ""Balance"" is about balance, ""Hypocrite"" is about hypocrisy, ""Time"" examines of the concept of time and reality-- and his storytelling-rich style is smooth and easygoing. But, keeping with the theme, Akrobatik's raps are balanced with occasionally intense production by DJ Sense, DJ Therapy, Da Beatminerz, Edan, and DJ Fakts One (with whom Akrobatik and Mr. Lif have a crew, called The Perceptionists). The Edan and Fakts One cuts work best with Akrobatik's style, complimenting his relatively straightforward delivery with complex, isolated drumming which sometimes unravels simple breakbeats only to embellish them with surprising, firework-clatter drum fills, confident bass buzz, and quirky funk. Later, Akrobatik himself takes a stab at funk in his self-produced duet with Mr. Lif, ""Wreck Dem""-- one of the record's best, despite that Lif's higher-pitched, sharper delivery steals the show out from under Akrobatik's lower timbre. In short, Akro's style is of an older, simpler school-- perhaps the same one where ""responsibility"" could pass as a theme without needing a fancy spin to entice the cynics.","Six years ago, KRS-One started HipHop Appreciation Week to ""decriminalize HipHop's public image and promote the unity of HipHop ...

Dirty: Deluxe Edition,Sonic Youth,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bfb1335d7bf1698a2f/1:1/w_160/cd64cc33.gif,2003-05-14 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7345-dirty-deluxe-edition/,DGCDGC,"If anyone had told me in 1992 that ten years later I'd be stepping up to praise this record, I'd probably have shot him. When Dirty first came out, it was an almost universal disappointment to anyone who'd listened to Sonic Youth beyond Goo-- and amidst the cries bemoaning what a major-label contract had done to their music, it wasn't as clear then that, beneath the glossy sheen Butch Vig and Andy Wallace had inflicted upon their beloved chaos, there was a damn good record waiting to be heard. Sure, it won them the seeds of a new fanbase-- though the majority had probably been re-alienated by the time they got around to Washing Machine-- but back then, it felt like a slap in the face from David Geffen himself. Listening to the instrumental B-sides and rehearsal takes that make up the second disc of this deluxe reissue, though, the final Dirty product makes a lot more sense. Even if they're mostly meandering jams with cells of future songs congealing here and there, these tracks show how the big-league production simply smoothed out the frayed edges of the group's sound. Of course, the noisier parts of songs like ""On the Strip"" still feel more calculated than the ecstatic beauty that seemed to organically materialize in the past, but the record really isn't anything worse than the band beginning to play with some of the toys they suddenly had at their disposal. But is the second disc worth more than a cursory listen? Not really, at least beyond the covers. Hearing Kim Gordon grunt her way through Alice Cooper's ""Is It My Body"" or flatly drone above the acoustic shambles of the New York Dolls' ""Personality Crisis"" is a pleasure to which I'll gladly return, but once the insight is absorbed from blueprints of ""Wish Fulfillment"", ""Youth Against Fascism"" and ""Drunken Butterfly"", among others, they don't make for the most compelling of repeat visits. It's also worth re-examining the subject matter of these songs because, as Byron Coley points out in the liner notes, Dirty marked the first record where Thurston, Lee and Kim made direct statements with their lyrics instead of using a Beat-like detachment to throw smoke clouds over their true targets. Where lyrical content in the past had dealt with surreal portraits of unlikely pop icons or had offered subverted political commentary like ""Total Trash"", Dirty had them throwing pointed barbs like ""Youth Against Fascism"" or offering elegiac tributes to murdered friends (""100%"" and ""JC"")-- not to mention that Kim's prior feminist manifestos had never been so bitingly succinct as they are on ""Swimsuit Issue"" and ""Shoot"". Even among the less confrontational tracks, there are still so many more great songs on Dirty than a lot of people ever realized. ""Theresa's Sound World"" fuses some of the better guitar interplay of Daydream Nation and Goo into a concise proclamation, while ""Sugar Kane"" and ""Purr"" are pure pop songs dressed up with a thousand pounds of overdrive; even a near throwaway like ""Crème Brulee"" is salvaged by Kim's sultry delivery. The four B-sides that accompany the original tracks on the first disc are enormous finds, too-- especially the LP bonus track ""Stalker"" that shows how only Sonic Youth could conjure the Sex Pistols covering Lynyrd Skynyrd. They might be a little rougher around the edges, but each of these tracks is as good as anything that made it onto Dirty proper. The only thing that really stands out as worthy of true criticism now is the tendency toward mining and repackaging some of the older material that becomes visible through the cracks of this reissue. ""Orange Rolls, Angels Spit"" recycles the riff from ""Stereo Sanctity"" into a grungy vehicle for Kim's angst, while ""Shoot"" fails to look any farther back than ""Kool Thing"", slowing the trendy alterna-hit down to an unsettling dirge about a woman ready to gun her way out from under some asshole's thumb. Several other tracks have that familiar vibe to them without borrowing outright from previous songs, showing that even if they weren't entirely catering to the new ears Nirvana's success was sending their way, they were at least taking it into consideration on a semi-conscious level. Of course, we should be clear about one thing: there's no chance of Dirty usurping Evol, Sister or Daydream Nation on my list of favorite Sonic Youth records, and even this 180-degree change of heart won't make me apologize for all the shit I've talked about it over the years. Still, even if there's a distinct possibility that I'm in the minority of Dirty-haters who'll eventually come around, this package at least makes a good case for reassessment. But if I'm talking like this when the expanded remaster of Experimental Jet Set, Trash & No Star comes around, just do me a favor and put me out of my misery.","If anyone had told me in 1992 that ten years later I'd be stepping up to praise this record ...

Electric Circus,Common,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a638c0084474cd0c08e9/1:1/w_160/5765d09a.jpg,2003-05-14 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1565-electric-circus/,MCA,"Why is it that hip-hop artists have so much trouble reinventing themselves once they're established in the game? In the rock and roll milieu, someone like David Bowie can adopt a different persona with each record he drops, and not only get away with it, but have it increase his marketability. With hip-hop, though, conventional wisdom is to stick with the tried-and-true as long as it moves units, then get the hell out. Think about it: Run-D.M.C.'s Back from Hell was based upon the premise that they went underground and re-emerged as hardened thugs, a ploy that got hip-hop's equivalent of the three wise men nearly laughed out of the kingdom. Meanwhile, others that have had drops in the bucket of post-revisionist success either possessed suspect credibility in the first place (can I get an Everlast?) or just changed the punchline to what was already a bad joke (that's you, Kid Rock). Upon first glance, it appeared Common may have achieved that kind of transformation with his follow-up to Like Water for Chocolate. From the Sgt. Common's Lonely Peeps Club Band cover art to an 8\xBD-minute ode to Jimi Hendrix, Electric Circus resonates with a lava lamp glow that's a lot more hip-pie than hip-hop. But that's Com's idea of where hip-hop should be headed-- to a land far, far away from the bling-blingity of his mainstream peers; if only his record hadn't been released so close to The Roots' Phrenology (note to MCA management: fire the person responsible for that little ""oversight""), Common's three steps backward might not pale so harshly in comparison to his peers' two steps forward. The most difficult sword to swallow in this particular circus is the near-absence of noteworthy vocals. Though Common's never exactly been a top-shelf emcee, his previous records always had enough good ideas to cover up what he lacked in invention on the mic. This time out, Com comes off as alternately uncomfortable and downright lazy, half-speaking-- or worse, singing-- new-age revelations to the masses. Even on a crunk-ass Neptunes track like ""I Got a Right Ta"", he plods along with an awkward flow only to boast, ""I'm the only cat in hip-hop/ That can go to a thrift shop/ Bring that get-up to the ghetto/ And get props,"" as if it's something to be proud of. But for better or worse, he still delivers some vintage Common flow on ""I Am Music"" and the equally imposing (and nonsensical) ""Electric Wire Hustle Flower"", making it impossible to write him off completely. Common's also always had a soft side, which has more often than not stood up in defense of his tendencies toward lyrical misogyny. Unfortunately, returning to that comfort zone on Electric Circus translates into some of the record's weakest moments. If ""Star *69 (PS With Love)""-- a totally predictable phone-sex love song that reeks of cheap incense and leopard-print upholstery-- isn't example enough, Com's smarmy duet with Mary J. Blige on ""Come Close"" should be sufficient. With a line like, ""The pimp in me may just have to die with you,"" Com invalidates any claims he might have to renaissance man status in a mere eleven syllables. Yet there's one crucial element to Electric Circus that salvages it from the razor-sharp ends of our three-pronged fork: listening to it on headphones is another experience altogether. The record has a mellow tide to it much like that of Like Water for Chocolate, with brief musical interludes that fuse even the sharpest stylistic changes together nicely. It all builds up like a slow fever to the two marathon-length tracks that dismantle the big top-- ""Jimi Was a Rock Star"" and ""Heaven Somewhere""-- both of which are laudable for their ambition, even if they're not quite cohesive. If nothing else, Common does at least succeed in his mission to offer an alternative in a culture that, on the surface, values material wealth over spiritual well-being. Because even if Electric Circus isn't the sonic coup d'etat he might've intended, it does plant the seeds for future revolution within anyone who cares enough to kick back and listen.","Why is it that hip-hop artists have so much trouble reinventing themselves once they're established in the\n\ game ...

Fake French,El Guapo,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1ec0084474cd0c2a02/1:1/w_160/16b11be1.jpg,2003-05-14 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2711-fake-french/,Dischord,"Not far from my ritzy Capitol City digs is a gigantic piece of graffiti, proudly emblazoning the name of El Guapo. Now, I'm not sure if this is an ambitious advertising campaign for the band (seeing as they also hail from the city of circling helicopters, anti-aircraft batteries, and Gulf War vet snipers), or the inspiration behind the name. But no matter what you think of El Guapo, it's a better name than the other graffiti on that same wall: BONER. These guys have been together since 1996, initially releasing their crazy art-punk through such microindies as Mud Memory, Red Skies at Night and Resin. But don't be fooled by the Dischord label their records have sported since last year's Super/System-- this is hardly the Fugazi-derived post-punk fare the label built its name on, and is only tenuously related to the dancepunk the company's been peddling of late. No, El Guapo strikes out for more experimental territory, full of quirky chanting and uneasy arrangements. Let's say it's like Le Tigre, only non-aggressive, less conventional, un-female, and apolitical-- does that leave anything? One thing that's clear is that El Guapo sure loves themselves some vocal interplay, that being the element most central to all 12 songs on Fake French. Sounding a little bit like the inspiring story of three guys who always dreamed of a career in cheerleading, the group tries out all styles of group singing: call and response (""The Time: Night""), ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" rounds (""Space Tourist""), ""Transylvania 6-5000""-style big band shoutouts (""Ocean and Sky""). And despite that reference-packed rundown, it adds up to an original sound when set against the nervous compubeats, samples, and occasional accordion freakout of the backdrop. It even makes for above-average robot-dance music on the opener, ""Glass House"". After that, it drives me up the fucking wall. Seriously, ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" as a touchpoint? Who wouldn't need a couple Excedrin after that? The often cyclical and trance-repetitive nature of the vocals plays slowdown with the clock, making the typically two or three minute songs drag on for what seems like double that, the lean 35:00 of the album feeling like a triple LP . When the backing music is in tip-top shape (the concise-Tortoise of the title track) the vocals are a distraction; when the orchestration is of a minimal nature (""Hawks, ""Hollywood Crew"") the campfire-singing is torturous. Surprisingly, for an album permanently brandishing a big red EXPERIMENTAL stamp, Fake French only reaches its highest points with the relatively straightforward, timely tracks that clash a little bit of the electro: ""Just Don't Know"" and ""Underground"". The rest of the album is chock-full of music that sounds largely original and hardly enjoyable. So despite our shared city roots, and the fact that they'll probably beat me up next time I attend a Ft. Reno show, and my hunch that the title track is about the EPCOT Center (are they saying ""laser lights beyond the pocky ball?"" It's gotta be, right?), I'm gonna have to take a pass on El Guapo and Fake French. Stick to graffiti, boys.","Not far from my ritzy Capitol City digs is a gigantic piece of graffiti, proudly emblazoning the name of El ...

Free Sentridoh: Tales from Loobiecore,Sentridoh,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a59d034d5c69bf2e8f/1:1/w_160/9085a6e7.gif,2003-05-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7071-free-sentridoh-tales-from-loobiecore/,Repo,"Once upon a time there was a man-- let's call him, I dunno, L. Barlow. No, that's too easy; let's call him Lou B. Anyway, Lou wanted to make music more than anything else in the world, so one day, he found a few other like-minded individuals and they formed a band known as Sebadoh. They wrote songs about girls and weed, and they played them for people. And so it came to pass on that fateful day that one of the founding forces of lo-fi indie rock was born, and a small section of the music world would be changed for the better, forever. But Lou B. was not entirely happy with the musical genius of Sebadoh, and decided that he needed a more personal outlet for his musical demons-- one free of the evils of excess instrumentation. So he stripped his songs to their barest, most vulnerable elements and exposed them for all to see. He released these brave new songs under the guise of Sentridoh, and, well, not too many people noticed. Free Sentridoh: Tales from Loobiecore is the latest incarnation of Lou Barlow's work as Sentridoh, and I wish I could say that this little fairy tale has a happy ending. I really do. Unfortunately, Tales from Loobiecore doesn't deviate from the formula he established on the first two Sentridoh releases, only even less inspired and just plain bland most of the time. As before, the recording quality is as lo-fi as it gets, and each one of the twenty-three tracks features Lou on his guitar with only an occasional assist on backing vocals or music. Half the tracks sound the same, right down to the chord structure. And while no single track is terrible on its own, there's no reason that these should all find their way onto one album-- because together, they're almost totally ignorable. For the most part, the tone of the songs is distinctly personal, even at their most bizarre, on tracks like ""Spacescape Imagination Station."" Barlow comes across as earnestly and sorrowfully as he always has, which is the one thing that holds the album together at all. When the album works, it's due to a complete lack of pretense. But there is a tradeoff. Although never a problem with his work in Sebadoh and Folk Implosion, the trademark sincerity of these tunes comes at the expense of this album's vitality. Most of the songs just fizzle out after two minutes or so, leaving very little impression as they pass. On the few occasions when Tales from Loobiecore does start to show signs of life, like ""The Devil and the Barbie Doll"" or ""Impulse,"" Barlow's vocals quickly snuff it. With a band behind him, he can pull off his less-than-energetic delivery, but here his voice is fully half of every song; when the music actually picks up, Lou's vocals just aren't up to task. Still, for its misfires, the record isn't a complete wash-out-- Barlow's songwriting ability is too solid to go 0-for-23. In fact, some truly fantastic songs can be found here, especially in comparison with the other mostly forgettable tunes. ""WWJD?"" is one case when the direct, honest approach of the album works to beautiful effect, and the confessional aspect of Lou's writing is exemplified in the surprisingly touching ""None of Your Goddambizness."" ""Ride a Hearse, Build a Throne"" can go toe-to-toe with some of the best stuff he's ever done, period. Sadly, though, the great songs are in the minority, and easily lost among the rest of the set. Tales from Loobiecore feels almost uncomfortably poignant considering Interscope's recent decision to drop the Folk Implosion, too. Maybe Lou's depressed (more than usual, I mean)? ""I let Methamphetamine burn a hole in my brain/ The part of my brain that wrote the songs/ When all of my confidence had jumped the fence and moved along,"" he sings on the eerily Don MacLean-esque ""Don't Call Me Writer."" Whether or not it was his intent, I feel kind of bad for the guy. Hopefully, his new post-Folk Implosion project will cheer him up, but until then, we all have Sentridoh to deal with. The music can grow on you, but ultimately there isn't much to redeem Tales from Loobiecore. It slips into a coma before the five-minute mark, and though it shows promise here and there, even a die-hard Lou Barlow fan might consider pulling the plug.","Once upon a time there was a man-- let's call him, I dunno, L.

This is the tale of The Apes' epic travels in pursuit of the precognitive, post-cognitive two-headed Gemini butterfly! Marvel at the primal beauty of the Forest of Confusion! Tremble before the psychic might of Brainbow and Brainbro, free-floating nerve-clusters bent on constructing ""robot bodies to spread disease!"" Be inadvertently confused by the sudden appearance of some dude (Ape? Maybe!) named Worwiz, who knows ""all there is to know!"" Say your prayers and wet your pants as he detonates a world-ending nuclear blast! Actually, on second thought, maybe Worwiz is the butterfly. I'm sure there's a story here, but I'm also sure that I'm not crazy enough to ""get it."" Remember when The Apes used to be content to just namecheck apes a lot? Journeys far from the wilds of their native D.C. have deepened this band, it seems, and I'm not just referring to the evil absurdity of Oddeyesee's ""plot."" Materially, the concept isn't particularly enlightening, though it never fails to entertain (if only out of the sheer conviction behind the insanity), but it's the band's music that's really seen the benefits of evolution. The Apes no longer need to relentlessly assert dominance through layer after layer of pulverizing bass and crash cymbals; the Moog/organ combo-- once merely a garnish to distract from the lack of guitars-- now subtly brings its way to the fore, leading with the carrot instead of the whip. Fans of The Apes' debut's slope-browed, knuckle-dragging aggression, don't fret: it hasn't gone the way of the way of the dodo, it's just a little tamer now, more focused. You'd never know it from the opening, though: The Apes' killer instincts take control, surrounding the listener just seconds into ""Intro"". Angry jungle drums pound away from all angles, panning back and forth across the channels before an ominously simple bass riff introduces the echoing, otherworldly narrator, who makes clear the nature of Oddeyesee's unique vision. ""I-Magic"" immediately hints at The Apes' more civilized tendencies, though; by their own admission, they're now ""twice as smart and half as blind."" Here, the just-barely-under-control dynamic between soaring organ fills, Paul Weil's agonized, wild-eyed vocals, and the doomsday percussion shows just how far they've come. All aspects of their sound have been mastered, unified into an overwhelming, but-- and this is the real trick-- not overpowering force; it's direct evidence of the vastly improved songwriting on Oddeyesee, and there's more to come. The Apes still tend to get by on psyched-out riff repetition, drilling through monolithic rhythmic progressions, but the organ's increased prominence causes them to never rely too heavily on any one element. In many ways, the arch complexity of Amanda Kleinman's work at the keys is a crystallization of The Apes' newfound refinement, and frequently serves as the primary melodic focus. ""Myops' Coin-Ops"" segues effortlessly through rolling bass crescendos, organ trills and fills, and sinister breakdowns, never lingering on any section long enough to even show wear. Trippy, ritualistic chanting fuses with 60s psychedelia before dissolving into an ingenious manipulation of stock B-Movie organ lines in ""Village of Brainbow and Brainbro"" (seriously); it's goofy as hell, but so perfectly executed and so bizarrely fitting with the overall mood of the album that it's almost impossible not to enjoy. Elsewhere, as on ""While Majestic Ape Sleeps"", the haunting call of the lone organ is all that can be heard, and the shift from rock adrenaline to such delicate, almost ethereal atmospherics is utterly gorgeous. ""Big Fog"" takes that idea a step further, combining graceful Moog riffs, soaring organ refrains and bass drums that thunder with ultimate, bruising intensity. These more ""experimental"" cuts may actually be the finest moments on an album rich with blasts of awe-inspiring firepower. Sometimes the band's more ambient leanings cause them to briefly stumble (the spacey drone of ""How You Like Me Now"" leaps instantly to mind), but the dividends paid by the decision to rein in their self-indulgent riff-flogging and take a few steps up the evolutionary ladder for Oddeyesee are indisputable, and more than welcome. Jane Goodall would be proud.","Friends! This is the tale of The Apes' epic travels in pursuit of the precognitive, post-cognitive two-headed Gemini butterfly! Marvel ...

The UA Years: 1969-1974,Amon Düül II,by: Scott Hreha,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0855e6ef9596931ff84/1:1/w_160/6e5b4ed1.gif,2003-05-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/167-the-ua-years-1969-1974/,Purple PyramidPurple Pyramid,"""Krautrock."" Christ, what an awful term. Maybe it's my German heritage rearing its ugly head, but I'll forever curse Faust for a song title so incredibly dumb, yet so easily appropriated to represent this movement-in-retrospect. ""What are you listening to?"" asks the cute girl sandwiched next to you on the bus. ""Amon Düül,"" you reply, intoning each umlaut with native-speaker authenticity. ""Huh?"" ""It's Krautrock."" End of discussion. Not that the alternatives are much better: ""musik kosmische?"" That just opens the way for even more deplorable German-derived academispeak like ""gestalt,"" ""bildungsroman,"" or, uh, ""doppelgänger."" I suppose the English translation-- ""cosmic music""-- works as well as any; it's definitely music and it's sure as hell cosmic, but that's probably not likely to impress a potential date either, is it? Well, Purple Pyramid's attempt to sample Amon Düül's glory days with the United Artists label is similarly unimpressive, though not for lack of trying. The thought of boiling down eight albums' worth of the Düül's extraterrestrial slop into one single-disc showcase is a nightmarish idea in execution and import, but to the compilers' credit, The UA Years gives a small, sweet taste of each record, and guarantees a boost in sales for their other reissues (to anyone lucky enough to find them). Yeti-- the band's uncontested 1970 masterpiece-- draws the heaviest representation with four songs that showcase Amon Düül II as acid-rock improvisers of the highest order. ""Archangel Thunderbird"" and ""Soap Shop Rock"" cast the group as something akin to a communal Black Sabbath, turning sludgy riffs and tremulous vocals into haphazard jewels, while ""Cerberus"" takes a more mystical approach, as the rambling open-tuned acoustic jam fades into a phased-out electric hoedown without so much as a thread left hanging askew. If you remember one piece of information in this review, let it be that Yeti is Amon Düül II's crowning achievement. As far as the other records are concerned, this compilation provides several generous points of entry for even the most timid consumers. 1973's Wolf City comes in a close second to Yeti, thanks to the way their quintessential hippie-prog exploration ""Wie der Wind am Ende Einer Strasse"" plays gentle contrast to the cosmic grandiosity of ""Surrounded by the Stars"" and the consciousness-rattling voices that float around the mix of Wolf City's title track. The tracks from 1972's Live in London stack the deck further: ""Race from Here to Your Ears"" is a full-out rock avalanche dusted with synth gurgles and violin slashes, while ""Improvisations"" rocks an outlandish drone that erupts into a Lennon-esque choogle, complete with Renate Knaup-Krötenschwanz's best Yoko-in-a-bag impersonation. But the most massive hurdle to overcome while listening to this disc-- and the reason that it's not at all recommendable to anyone already familiar with Amon Düül-- is the rampant excerpting of longer tracks to make room for a wider view of their work. Because once you've acquired a predilection for the band's sidelong trips to the outer limits, the bits and pieces on display here are hard to digest. Hearing them in this misaligned context also shows how dated some of this stuff can be, especially the straight-outta-Spinal Tap ""Deutsch Népal"" and its medieval German voice-over; if you can't picture the band dancing around a miniature Stonehenge while playing this one, then I'll see you at the Renaissance Faire (sike!). Despite its shortcomings, I can't stress enough that The UA Years is an admirably assembled introduction to one of the most stylistically restless bands under the Krautrock banner. It's just that, personally, when the cosmic egg finally does crack, I expect to see the entire universe-- not a handful of stars and dust.","""Krautrock."" Christ, what an awful term.

Chrome Rats vs Basement Rutz,Chromatics,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c3c0084474cd0c07cf/1:1/w_160/a60d6b4a.jpg,2003-05-13 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1456-chrome-rats-vs-basement-rutz/,GSL,"The beverage felt cool to her warm lips as Stefani sat down for the first time that evening after being stuffed in the cramped basement listening to three bands play in just as many hours. Upon raising the bottle to her face for one more swig before returning to the floor, she felt a tap on her shoulder and a chorus of voices ask her, ""Excuse me, is this seat taken?"" Stefani turned her head, and saw behind her the entire group that had just finished their set, The Chromatics. ""Uhm,"" she hesitantly replied, ""no, it's not, go ahead."" ""Excellent. We're really thirsty after that show. Would you like something to drink as well?"" the band asked. A long silence ensued while the bartender fetched four beers for the group. ""Right... can I ask why you all are wearing an oversized sweater with four neck-holes cut into it? And why are you speaking in unison and wearing those duct-tape anklets?"" ""Our psychiatrist says we need to focus on building our team skills,"" said the band. ""She says it will help us salve our artistic wounds."" Stefani rolled her eyes. That's all she needed was to get hit on by yet another creatively divided band. She shuddered as she remembered her sordid affair with Wilco the previous year. -- STRIKE ONE -- ""SO,"" the Chromatics said, ""those are nice, exaggerated cuff dark-denim jeans you have there."" They paused for effect before adding, ""They'd look better on my van floor, though."" ""UGH, are you serious?!"" Stefani had to set her drink down. ""Is that your opening line? Aside from being completely crass and inappropriate, it's as old as my dad!"" ""We take pride in vulgar displays of animal lust, though,"" the band argued, ""and we think there's nothing wrong with borrowing from the past."" ""That's an understatement. I heard your new album, Chrome Rats vs Basement Rutz, and it's raw to say the least. It sounds like The Godz after 24-hour exposure to Gang of Four, The Stooges circa Raw Power, and The Fall."" ""Yeah, we feel that the tracks wear their influences like badges of honor,"" the group said before elaborating, ""We trade the catcalls and the angular honky-tonk guitar of The Fall on 'Skill Fall', drag the burden of feedback akin to Sonic Youth on 'Plastic Kross', and finally utilize American dissidence with the copped Wipers tune 'Felt Tongue'."" Stefani perked up, ""Isn't that one of the tracks that The Blood Brothers' Johnny Vade co-vocals? I've had my eye on him ever since the popular press started to notice the band. Where is he?"" ""Oh, well, you see,"" the band scratched their collective heads. ""He, uh, doesn't return our phone calls now."" -- STRIKE TWO -- Stefani tried to think of something to say to break the awkward silence. She finally declared, ""I appreciate the tangential no wave-inspired support of sexual equality that you all attempt, allowing the girls to share equivalent stage-time with the boys, especially on tracks like 'Hannah's Song'. It boasts the closest connection on the album to my favorite influential groups like Ut, Y Pants, and The Raincoats, though I don't understand why you couldn't do more with the sound and content, steering away from the clichés of grrl-rock."" ""Our effort was really on the lyrics in those songs, though, focusing the experimental energy into lines like, 'We pose a threat to undermine your dominance,' and, 'You ought to stick it in and show me what a man can do,' and leaving the song structure at a really basic style..."" ""I was curious as to why you only allowed the girls to shine in a stereotyped Kim Gordon-growl. Don't you worry that lyrics like that will peg the songs as second-generation Bikini Kill fodder? And why should the woman's role be defined by sexual views while the men get to opine and politick about everything from government policy to music history? The more I think about it, the more the songs sound like loosely tacked-on gender-specific apologies that work only to get the band laid."" The band stared blankly into their drinks before raising their heads with a wide-eyed grin and asking, ""Is it working?"" -- STRIKE THREE -- Stefani picked up her button-covered messenger's bag and made her way back to the stage. She never saw the band again, but she heard that they followed the No New York personalities' trend of imploding before the official release of any substantial body of work, leaving behind only remnant members and a slew of other NY bands to carry the torch of arty and ambiguous musicianship into the future. She thought to herself how sad it was that if they'd only been given the benefit of time the band could have eventually surpassed their dependence on immaturity and hindsight, and ultimately not have fallen prey to both her rejection and their own. Though she moved on with her life-- currently dating the Yeah Yeah Yeahs-- Stefani never forgot that magical moment she shared with a band that burned out just when they were getting interesting.","The beverage felt cool to her warm lips as Stefani sat down for the first time that evening after being ...

The Essential Byrds,The Byrds,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41a13d1975652138c2d/1:1/w_160/2cca703a.jpg,2003-05-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1058-the-essential-byrds/,Columbia,"Someday, some enterprising soul will establish a code of etiquette for naming these career retrospective collections. Essential, Greatest Hits, Best of, Classics and several less common but no less boastful titles are used largely interchangeably as it stands, and record companies are especially loose about throwing these terms around in hopes of snagging a few stray dollars from consumers who don't see any inherent value in the artists' original albums. Essential is the title that gives me the most pause, though, considering how vaguely the term is used. You can take it to mean that all of the material that made the compilation is essential, or you can take it to be more absolute, meaning ""here's the essential stuff-- buy it and you're set."" By the first standard, this latest in a string of dozens of Byrds retrospectives is mostly a success; by the second standard, it's a complete failure. Nearly every song on this two-disc set warrants inclusion on some basis, though disc two is somewhat weighted down by Columbia's insistence on including at least two tracks from every one of the band's albums for the label, including the hideously overproduced Byrdmaniax and the scattered Farther Along, the albums which precipitated the band's ultimate collapse. The band's final albums, to put it lightly, are for hardcore fans of the band's second, more country-inspired phase, and not territory for curiosity-seekers to be wandering onto. When you consider this set as a whole, that loss of momentum is especially problematic, as it leaves you with the aftertaste of the songs most lacking in luster. Perhaps a better title would have been Overview, or at least Anthology. Really, I could sit here and complain for paragraphs about the fact that they missed ""You're Still on my Mind"", ""I Know My Rider"", ""One Hundred Years from Now"", and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"", among dozens of other fantastic songs hiding in the band's catalog. But gripes aside, there's more than enough amazing material here to serve as proof that The Byrds were one of the greatest bands of their era. The first disc doesn't slip at all-- bookended by the band's definitive versions of Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""My Back Pages"", it's sixteen undeniable classics parked right next to each other; you can almost hear the roots of every band that ever jangled spreading the through the soil of rock. In just three selections, this compilation makes the case for Gene Clark as a colossal songwriter, and his ""I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better"" and ""She Don't Care About Time"" are enough to make me wish he'd written a thousand more. The band's exhilarating turn into psychedelia, ""Eight Miles High"", still sounds just as towering today as it must have back then, standing next to The Who's ""I Can See for Miles"" as rock's best early flirtation with open-ended improvisation within an otherwise conventional song form. Roger McGuinn's stunning twelve-string solos echo the exploratory sax of Coleman and Coltrane and blow the doors off anything else I can think of that was happening in mainstream rock in 1966. The goofy pop of ""Mr. Spaceman"" and ""So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star"" is excellent, though the songs sound a little slight in comparison to bassist Chris Hillman's gloriously Beatlesque ""Have You Seen Her Face"" and the dark, beguiling Crosby/McGuinn tune ""Renaissance Fair"". The second disc kicks off with perhaps the most inspired, unexpected choice on the set, the fantastic Crosby-penned single ""Lady Friend"", a tune that truly warrants the ""essential"" label, even if the band never saw fit to put it on an album. But from there, things get a bit less even, as the band became more erratic with each lineup shift that followed Crosby's departure. Certainly, their first post-Crosby album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, was every bit as good as their earlier records, highlighted by a pair of Goffin/King covers (""Goin' Back"" and ""Wasn't Born to Follow"", both included here) that marked a flirtation with Spector-ish Wall of Sound sonics. The following year, the arrival of Gram Parsons in the band's ranks sparked a shift into country that lingered even after his departure to found The Flying Burrito Brothers with Hillman. Opinions vary widely on the direction the band took following the dissolution of the original lineup, but it's hard to deny that Sweetheart of the Rodeo is one of the best country albums ever recorded, which is why it's curious that only two songs from it show up here. Parsons' ""Hickory Wind"" and their cover of Dylan's ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" are estimable songs, but it's a meager offering from such a rich album-- at the very least, ""One Hundred Years from Now"" should have made the cut. The stinginess of the Sweetheart offerings would be forgivable if there was much that followed that feels right taking its place. As it happens, ""Ballad of Easy Rider"" is the band's best late-period song, but... ""Jesus Is Just Alright""? Their version is okay, but-- and how often can you say this?-- The Doobie Brothers did it better. Otherwise, ""Chestnut Mare"" (from 1970's Untitled) is fun, and ""Tiffany Queen"" (from their 1971 swan song Farther Along) is a fine last gasp, but in the harsh light of what's come before it, it can't help but sound slightly dull. I don't know that I can recommend against picking up this set, but I'd say that if you can do it, buying the remastered, augmented versions of the band's first six albums is a much better investment. The Byrds were hugely important for all kinds of reasons, from their simultaneous embrace of folk and electric instruments, to their psychedelic experimentalism, to their mastery of country-rock, and a good sampling of the songs that made them important is available here. Whether or not it makes it to your shelf depends mostly on your appetite for The Byrds-- if one release is all you're ever going to get, this one would be hard to beat.","Someday, some enterprising soul will establish a code of etiquette for naming these career retrospective collections.

Touch Food,Phill Niblock,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f5c0084474cd0c35b1/1:1/w_160/c5878461.jpg,2003-05-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5788-touch-food/,Touch,"I'm watching my man cook at his house. I know he's a badass in the kitchen, working in one of New York's finest restaurants for years now, yet I never get to see him in action behind the swinging doors, over the open flames and hissing steam. The precision with which he handles the knife is incredible, his knuckles and manual movements the very economy of action, each cut vegetable chopped meticulously. Everything, be it ginger, onion, peppers, or tomato, is reduced into miniscule 1/16th-inch cubes. ""Why so small?"", I ask. ""The more finely chopped,"" he says, ""the better the flavor."" Technique aside, the resulting din-din is on a plane above how I imagined food could taste. I didn't really make the connection between fine cuisine and the music of Phill Niblock until thumbing through the thick ten-page booklet of Indonesian images that accompanies his latest set: bushels of harvest, rice patties, kitchen prep, and oxen carcasses being carved up rib by rib. The working methods of this minimalist composer are strikingly unique. At first it's tough to tell, since, for years, his recorded discography had large gaps, due to the limitations of the vinyl medium. The advent of the CD, however, allowed him greater frequency ranges and longer durations of uninterrupted time to cast his sounds in-- and the arrival of ProTools technology must have seemed an invention of Ron Popiel proportions, aiding him in easily amassing and processing his sounds. So while peers such as La Monte Young, Eliane Radigue, or Tony Conrad might have taken years or decades to bear forth variations on their initial 60s explorations, Niblock is feverishly cranking these days, his sounds mutating as he goes. The last few years have brought forth pieces for hurdy-gurdy and voice, as well as one for guitars featuring Thurston Moore, Kevin Drumm, and Jim O'Rourke. That said, it's hard to tell some of his pieces apart. Once instruments like the French horn, didjeridoo, sousaphone, hurdy-gurdy, and guitar are singularly smeared into 25-minutes cloud chunks, you could be anywhere. Here, the saxophone of the first piece, the bass clarinet of the second, and electric bass of the third are cooked down to their vibrating essence, and then heated in Niblock's cauldron as an entirely new thing. Alchemical or purely from the open flame, the once-acoustic instruments are altered to sound otherworldly, to the great duress of your woofers; as the low fluctuations coagulate and gain amplitude, cranking up the volume (as Niblock always suggests) lets the sounds beat across every pore and surface of the body, massaging the constrictions of the earspace away. The second disc holds ""Pan Fried"", a 70-minute bit of nervous system suspension that's easily Phill's grandest bit of glacial bliss yet, stretched out to commemorate his 70th year. Taking Reinhold Friedl's rosined fingertips as they rub a string tied to a single piano wire inside of a Bosendorfer piano (the piano of choice for heavenly hum by folks like La Monte Young and Charlemagne Palestine), several octaves of C# and F are recorded, then pureed. Between those two little notes, Niblock carves out a canyon that somehow has the basso profundo of the Million Man Choir, the slow grinding of plate tectonic pop, the 30-story high cicada song of spring, and the plinks of the Lord's own zither all freefalling through the space. That each droning sound dissolves into a heavenly consommé is one thing, but that the consummate effect is of you ""soaking in it"" makes it one of the more singular taste sensations of the year.","I'm watching my man cook at his house.

"Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts",M83,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfceb335119a49ecfc4/1:1/w_160/5cff20b4.jpg,2003-05-12 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5006-dead-cities-red-seas-lost-ghosts/,Gooom,"Sometimes I think it can't be a matter of simple coincidence that sound, when rendered visually, appears as ever-changing green fluctuations stretched over an infinite black void. The power of music to seemingly construct, alter and distort space can be staggering. Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, the second album from French electronic duo M83, nicely epitomizes this: The sound is absolutely huge, its relentless attention to detail eclipsed only by the stunning emotional power it conveys. For fifty-seven glorious minutes, its impossibly intricate tapestry of buzzing techno synthesizers, distorted electric guitars, cheesy drum machines, and subdued vocals generate a sense of bodily movement through a landscape of beauty, disappointment, glory, and decrepitude. Dead Cities not only envelops you, but also affords you room to explore its vast expanse. One remarkable attribute of Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts is how vastly M83's sound palette differs from the ones most often used to create music possessing this much beauty and depth. Countless musicians have humanized electronic sounds by generating tones that feel warm or organic, but M83 have undertaken a different challenge: to convey beauty through the familiar, filtered buzz of the kind of cheap synthesizers usually found in techno and dance tracks. Paradoxically, the sounds that have constituted some of the most vapid, hedonistic, and forgettable music of our time have now returned to make us cry. M83 open Dead Cities with one of their most striking misappropriations of trite instrumentation. In ""Birds"", a tinny sample of chirping birds is combined with swells of synth strings and a computerized voice repeating, ""Sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are growing, clouds are looming and I am flying."" The computerized voice is run through an odd, wavering melodic filter that affords it just the right degree of harmonic dissonance with the accompanying synths, and it takes on a decidedly unsettling feel, repeating its mantra-like invocation of the unsteady world you're about to enter. Once inside, you're exposed to a landscape of seemingly infinite depth and complexity. Rather than just ending, sounds and songs disappear off into the horizon, continually bringing a promise of something familiar but unforeseen to follow. ""Unrecorded"", the first full-fledged song on Dead Cities, makes clear the reason M83 have drawn so many My Bloody Valentine comparisons. Building upon a foundation of fuzzed-out guitar, rich bass, synth strings, and a drum machine that sounds surprisingly like the acoustic drums of Loveless, the duo layers burbling techno synthesizers into complex rhythmic intersections as the song's vast backdrop slowly fades away. Just as My Bloody Valentine refashioned distorted electric guitars as instruments capable of divine and volatile sound, M83 recast harsh sawtooth waves as voices of reflection and regret. On ""Run into Flowers"", almost-real strings and whispered vocals are juxtaposed with overdriven drum machine clicks, as an insistent 4/4 beat evokes lush, green fields as easily as abandoned factories and polluted rivers. This kind of contrast factors heavily into ""In Church"", as a clear pipe organ and an angelic, reverb-laden chorus are assaulted by blasts of white noise. Finally, a wrenching, synthesized melody enters, providing a profoundly moving counterpoint to the sterile beauty that preceded it. By the time you get to ""0078h"", it's impossible to tell whether the heavily altered vocals are of human or computerized origin; it's also completely ceased to matter. Oftentimes, the most organic sounds on Dead Cities are the most formless, and the most glaringly synthetic sounds the most emotional. Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts ends fittingly with the 14-minute epic ""Beauties Can Die"", which recalls at first the melodic, pastoral electronica of Múm's Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is OK. This peaceful opening is soon overtaken by a sound that gradually transforms from a low, earthquake-like rumble into a blast of synthesized static. Synthesizers and harmony vocals are layered and layered until the sound is so explosively, beautifully gigantic that you won't mind it's damaging your hearing. More earthquake rumbles follow, each ushering in even more layers of ungodly gorgeous sound and evoking a stomach-turning combination of fear and excitement. At the crash of a synthesized cymbal, the song descends into submerged ambience, and ultimately into a long silence, before resurfacing with distorted radar blips and shrieks of howling noise. As ""Beauties Can Die"" fades, you're left with the feeling that you've just returned from a journey-- that the images passing through your mind for the last hour couldn't possibly have been the result of mere imagination. An album like this extends far beyond your speakers, guiding you through an impossibly rich, detailed world of sound while also giving you room to explore it yourself; you don't listen to Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, you inhabit it.

Do Rabbits Wonder?,Whirlwind Heat,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa0e5e6ef9596932150b/1:1/w_160/a37f64bc.jpg,2003-05-12 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8642-do-rabbits-wonder/,V2Third Man,"With Pitchfork, as with any other cooperative effort, there's a general trust that each writer will do his or her best to act for the benefit of the others, in order to promote our continued, collective well-being. Just like baseball, or an orgy, or the army. Usually, it doesn't require much more than watching each other's backs and covering the music about which enquiring minds want to know. But sometimes, for the greater good, one of us has to take a hit for the team. So... Did you guys and gals like Elephant? Didja? I did, as I have most of the Stripes' albums, and I'll bet a lot of you share that sentiment-- Whirlwind Heat are counting on it. If it weren't for Jack White's perplexing cachet as crossover-darling-of-the-moment, I doubt anyone could've voodooed V2 into spewing forth Do Rabbits Wonder?. In a just world, the dismal aggregation of Moog-funk chaos collected on the debut LP of White's fellow Michiganites couldn't see rotation in a trash heap, let alone airtime on M2 (I'll leave it on you to decide the degree of separation there). But everyday, something-- be it venereal disease, or Republicans, or Nelly-- goes out of its way to prove once again that life ain't fair, and it ain't getting any fairer. Consequently, as the debut signees for Jack's Third Man imprint, and with V2's backing, and if everyone takes leave of their senses long enough to buy just one more album... well, it's all too easy to see how Whirlwind Heat is poised as a Next Big Thing on the cusp of the burgeoning art-punk uprising. It's mind-boggling that such sloppily arranged, barely listenable stuff is getting this kind of attention, but that's celebrity for you. In fact, Rolling Stone, as part of their apparent ongoing crusade to devour the public's collective sensibilities from the inside-out, has called Whirlwind Heat this generation's Devo. Did I miss some kind of election? Forget for a moment that a 'Stone endorsement seems more like sloppy seconds for anything that has the name ""Jack White"" stapled to it-- it's statements like this that cause brain hemorrhages. Is this supposed to be a good thing? To paraphrase Moses Hadas, the demise of Devo left a much-needed gap; even if painfully affected vocals, incompetent Moogery, and excruciating ""quirkiness"" are all it takes to fill that void, Whirlwind Heat are still nothing but an unfunny punchline to the joke Devo started back in '72. But they can't even hope for that much; Devo at least had a brain. Instead, Heat follows thoughtlessly in the footsteps of their betters on the dancepunk gravy train, piecing together similar fragments left in the ruinous wake of the post-punk/no wave aftermath. Erratic, bass-dominated rock with an ear toward shaking your ass (sometimes), punctuated with a little electronic dissonance to complete the outfit-- everything's in its proper place, but somehow it goes horribly awry. The Rapture, Giddy Motors, or the tragic brilliance of Brainiac-- the modern masters of the form know how to unveil cohesion, complexity, and even the odd melody out of apparent cacophony; meanwhile, David Swanson is so helpless with his keyboard I'm curious why he even bothers plugging it in. He caterwauls away, stabbing keys on a whim, presumably counting on some magical melody fairy to come save him. (She refuses.) Worst of all-- I mean, aside from the extra-strength dumb of this record's koan-esque title-- Swanson's spasmodic Moog is the album's attempted ""hook."" Oh my. Along with his yelping falsetto, the two most notable elements of Whirlwind Heat do nothing but smash anything that resembles a song, or organization, or the happiness of the listener. On ""Brown"" or ""Black"", Swanson is in a tolerable speak'n'sing mode, but can't go a full sentence without nastily spiking his voice into a range that shoots for ""tenor"" and hits ""what the fuck was that""; elsewhere, on cuts like ""Pink"", he never shuts up. He warbles through lines as laughable as, ""Like a trash bag helmet,"" operating in some sort of alien pseudo-rhythm that's nine-times-out-of-ten totally oblivious to the rest of the song. But, hey, y'know, it's quirky! Yeah, quirky like a seizure. That, and the gimmicky electronic squalls (see ""Blue""), are damaging enough to turn even the most intriguing bass/drum dynamics into soup. And that's no mean feat, either, since the carefully hidden strength of Whirlwind Heat is that they possess some of the filthiest, sleaziest basslines in town. When Brad Holland uses his percussive powers for good (instead of making his kickdrum the object of random violence) and falls in sync with the amped-up raunch of Steve Damstra's fuzz bass, the two can lay down quite an onslaught. Damstra's bass even pulls double-duty, carrying what little melody exists in the album in the absence of guitars. But it doesn't make any difference; pointless fills and caught-in-a-bear-trap howling create an untenable schism between spine-cracking intensity and atonal mess. If nothing else can be said in its favor, this is music that will instantly, violently polarize people: some folks' inner masochists may welcome it as an alternative to self-flagellation; personally, I'd rather take sandpaper across my corneas than sit through this thing again. As Swanson ""sings"" on ""Orange"", ""This is a good day to die/ And this is a good day to whine/ And this is a good day to cry""; listen to Whirlwind Heat long enough, and I think you'll agree.","With Pitchfork, as with any other cooperative effort, there's a general trust that each writer will do his or ...
