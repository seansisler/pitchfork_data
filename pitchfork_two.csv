Contact,Greg Fox,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed0341aeecba3592e7b14fb/1:1/w_160/Contact_Greg%20Fox.jpg,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/greg-fox-contact/,Rvng Intl.,"Over the course of three studio albums, Greg Fox’s solo output has become less conceptual. In 2014, Mitral Transmission drew upon experiments using free-jazz drummer Milford Graves’ various bio-sensing apparatuses, which allowed Fox to find music in the natural rhythms of his body. The Gradual Progression, released in 2017, was a richer, headier work, one still intimately connected to process, though the conceit wasn’t as high-minded: Channeling jazz and new age, Fox began working with software called Sensory Percussion, which can turn a drum kit into an electronic controller or sampler, allowing for a broader array of sounds in the mix. On Contact, there are even fewer formal constraints. Recorded with veteran doom-metal producer Randall Dunn (Earth, Sunn O))), Six Organs of Admittance) in just two days, the album feels more improvisatory than The Gradual Progression, and more blindingly technical. Fox remains a gifted physical performer, marshaling percussive chaos into increasingly controlled forms—defined rhythmic mutations in cymbal crashes and cool, rolling snare hits. The track titles draw from Buddhist concepts, though Fox admits they’re “somewhat arbitrary”; more than any overarching thematic framework, a freeform, exploratory sensibility guides the album. There’s a sense, too, of things being stripped back. This is clearest on the three title tracks, which are minimalistic to the point of resembling technical exercises. Fox presents complex rhythms in isolation, without any extraneous samples or production tricks. It’s sonic acupuncture—just Fox and the kit, iterating on a series of patterns to near-therapeutic effect. “Parasthesia” achieves something similar with an opposite tack; occasional blasts of processed, oxidized sound punctuate a sustained ambient tableau, with fewer flourishes and relatively little negative space. Where the three “Contact” tracks are aesthetically austere, “Parasthesia” represents an economy of motion. There’s a bit of that on “Vedana,” too, though the effect is somewhat weaker; the repetitions fatigue more than they entrance. As indebted to prog as to spiritual jazz, “From the Cessation of What” is the album’s most developed piece, and its most texturally stunning. What begins as something misty and spacious quickly tightens as the drumming becomes more dynamic. With a cascade of bright, percussive plinks, the track becomes almost dialogic; the interplay between the starkness of the kit and the gloss of those sampled tones resembles a kind of conversation. And in the final third, amid psychedelic organ, Fox lets loose, closing with splashy, cathartic release. The album’s title, Contact, nods to the basic mechanics of drumming: the isolated experience of hitting, rolling, or brushing as a moment of connection. But more than ever, in Fox’s solo catalog, that physical sensation bleeds into the psychic. The relationship between gesture and emotion is newly unmediated, and individual actions evoke worlds. Fox is the lone, many-limbed curator, conjuring sounds and samples in space. And though Contact is mostly a one-man endeavor, the music generates a sense of proximity, of presence. That tension feels both like an ironic reminder of our current isolation and a gesture toward a more communal future.","On his third solo album, the New York drummer sheds his earlier records’ conceptual frameworks, marshaling percussive chaos into increasingly controlled forms.

Neon Cross,Jaime Wyatt,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed02fd791e9d15571ac9302/1:1/w_160/Neon%20Cross_Jaime%20Wyatt.jpg,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jaime-wyatt-neon-cross/,New West,"The last time we heard from Jaime Wyatt, she was at the start of a bad spiral. Covering Merle Haggard’s “Misery and Gin” at the end of her 2017 debut Felony Blues, the Nashville country singer succumbed to her loneliest thoughts, “sitting with all my friends and talking to myself.” Now, she’s all but abandoned. Her latest album, Neon Cross, begins with the slowest of slow burns: a lush, stately piano ballad called “Sweet Mess.” Even more than its hopeless lyrics or gentle rainfall of piano and pedal steel, you’re left hanging onto her voice—a smoky, one-of-a-kind instrument. Just from a few notes, you might imagine it echoing from the darkest corner of a bar, from someone with a troubled past and a long, sad story to tell. And you would be right. Raised in rural Washington, Jaime Wyatt headed to California as a teenager with the hopes of breaking into the music industry. Instead, she found herself in personal and professional hell. She turned to hard drugs and, at 21, was arrested for robbing her heroin dealer. After serving eight months in jail and getting clean, her marriage fell apart; she relapsed after the death of her father and several of her closest friends. Some of these experiences, soundtracked by boozy, swaggering outlaw country, made their way onto Felony Blues, a tight, seven-song introduction that confirmed her as one of the genre’s most exciting and skillful storytellers. But “Sweet Mess” is her first song that suggests a darkness from which she can’t escape. It is beautiful, enveloping, and totally bleak. It is also an outlier. For the most part, Neon Cross is another triumphant record that speaks to the ways in which Wyatt has overcome these situations. She wrote most of its songs after recovering from addiction and coming out as gay: “I lost years of my life being in the closet and living a lie and trying to be someone else,” she explained. “I just can’t do it anymore.” The title track immediately feels like her defining song. Over a galloping rhythm and jangling acoustic guitars, she allows for winking, momentary self-pity: “So sad, goddamn/I’m wearing some pitiful perfume.” But the way she sings it, it seems more like a rallying cry, an effort to turn the car around and make the most of the night. A refrain of “Oh, poor me!” has never seemed so hopeful. The rest of the songs follow suit, searching for silver linings, or at the very least, a good punchline. She recorded the album with fellow outlaw revivalist Shooter Jennings, who expands on the old-school blueprint of Felony Blues to match these songs’ wide-ranging emotions. You can sense the pair digging through their record collections to find just the right texture. A brief twinkle of keyboard at the end of “Just a Woman”—a duet with Jennings’ mother, country legend Jessi Colter—sounds straight out of an ’80s jukebox classic, while the ghostly fiddle and pedal steel in her rendition of Dax Riggs’ “Demon Tied to a Chair in My Brain” make it sound more like an unearthed Carter Family standard. There is a cumulative feeling to the music, like Wyatt is placing herself within a deep history of folk wisdom. While Neon Cross highlights the versatility of Wyatt’s gorgeous, commanding voice, she finds her comfort zone in singalong anthems like “Goodbye Queen.” It’s got a sunny, windows-down charm that feels perfectly suited to the timeless grain of her singing. She mines similar territory in “Make Something Outta Me,” a callback to her last record’s more overtly autobiographical material. This time around, she embellishes her past with self-effacing humor as she zooms through her last 15 years, cracking jokes about her regrets, her online dating profile, and her fatalist tendencies. “I was raised on heartache,” she sings, “So I like to suffer slow.” It’s a clever lyric that should ring true for anyone who, like her, gravitates toward sad songs with dark, inevitable endings. But Wyatt wants you to know that’s not how she sees herself. On Neon Cross, her story is just beginning.","The country singer was “raised on heartache,” but her latest album is a triumphant testament to the way that Wyatt has outpaced her demons.

Ghetto Fabolous,Fabolous,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd49ac91dbebb858d7ecee/1:1/w_160/Ghetto%20Fabolous_Fabolous.jpg,2020-05-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fabolous-ghetto-fabolous/,Desert StormElektra,"Everything Fabolous knew could be found in blocks encompassed by the Brevoort Houses in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn. There, his personality developed: skeptical, quiet, unbothered, the type to stand around the freestyle circle but never contribute a verse himself. Throughout his childhood, he watched hip-hop blossom in Brooklyn, from the sound of the underground to something he couldn’t walk out of his home without hearing. One of the first rappers he became enamored with was Big Daddy Kane, his swag was undeniable—the chains, the high-top fade, Madonna—and everyone in the neighborhood had a story about Biggie Smalls and Lil’ Kim.  In high school, before he was known as Fabolous, and before his debut album was released on September 11, 2001, the kid born John Jackson would draw at an art and design school in Midtown Manhattan, another world. But even as he traveled to the city, he couldn’t help but notice rap’s impact around him—it was the soundtrack of neighborhood fish fries and basketball games, and he would hear about hip-hop duo Smif-N-Wessun outside like local celebrities. He wanted to have that effect. After a few small-time recordings, Jackson laid down a verse on a local producer’s flip of Puff Daddy’s “It’s All About the Benjamins.” The track became a neighborhood hit and eventually, the word spread to Queens-born party promoter and manager Kevin Webb. Together, they recorded a proper demo, and Webb made a promise that he could get Jackson’s music to the ears of a DJ who was breaking hits in New York like a one-man WorldStarHipHop. DJ Clue, raised in Jamaica, Queens, was a pioneer of the rap mixtape. In the 1990s, after landing an internship at RCA, Clue began to get access to unreleased exclusives. His mixtapes, known as Clue Tapes, were essentially curated playlists and goldmines for everything New York hip-hop. Coated with his signature DJ drops, Clue Tapes were launching pads for iconic New York rap records of the ’90s from Method Man to  JAY-Z to Biggie. Often his tapes would include songs acquired without permission, like the time he ignited a beef with Bad Boy Records after leaking a track from Ready to Die and Biggie traveled to the Bronx with a gun in search of Clue. But by the time 1997 rolled around, Clue’s platform was so powerful—from the clubs to the streets—that Diddy invited him to get an advance listen of Biggie’s Life After Death and choose any two songs to include on a mixtape. Clue chose two records that would become timeless: “Hypnotize” and “Mo’ Money Mo’ Problems.” Hot 97, New York’s premier radio station, desperately wanted access to the pair of Life After Death songs so they began to spin the records with Clue’s DJ tags still attached. The success led to Hot 97 recruiting DJ Clue for his own show on the station, “Monday Night Mixtapes.” Kevin Webb had known DJ Clue from parties he used to throw—Webb would secure the venue, Clue would DJ. Webb played the demo for Clue’s partner and manager, Rich Skane. “Yo, I heard some stuff from this kid, he sounds aight,” Skane said to Clue. “You should check him out.” Clue invited Jackson to meet him at Hot 97. In 1998, Jackson, at this point a high school senior who had yet to even form an official rap pseudonym, pulled up to Hot 97 with an Avirex jacket draped over his lanky frame, expecting nothing more than a typical sit-down meeting. But that day, he would leave Hot 97 with a rap name and the support of hip-hop’s most influential DJ. In 1998, the New York rap dream was simple: secure a record deal and get a song played on Hot 97. When Jackson arrived, Clue was fumbling around the radio station’s headquarters and told Jackson to wait in the studio with Noreaga, who at the time was one of New York’s hottest rappers. After a commercial break, Clue told Jackson and Noreaga they were going to freestyle live on Hot 97’s airwaves. Clue dropped the beat for The Lox’s “Money, Power, and Respect,” and suddenly, the typically quiet and reserved Jackson erupted. “Just in case y’all was lost, I’m the face in the sauce/Long Cuban, white ice, placed in the cross,” raps Jackson on the opening line, an introduction to his smooth wordplay and blase delivery. Noreaga followed him with a verse, but Jackson wanted to leave his mark, and surprisingly dropped a second. In this verse, Jackson washes Noreaga and misspells a word that DJ Clue would stamp as his rap name: “It’s the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S/In a new S, circling the U.S.” The next day the DJ gave him a call, and soon enough the first signee of Clue’s Desert Storm Records was Fabolous. Fabolous spent the next few years being touted around New York by DJ Clue like an up-and-coming boxer and his promoter. He became a staple of DJ Clue’s mixtapes, as the fresh-voiced kid who delivered clever punchlines effortlessly. On The Professional, DJ Clue’s platinum 1998 debut album, Fab made two appearances, one with Foxy Brown and Mase, another solo. As a part of Desert Storm Records, Fabolous joined Interscope, where he began to put together a debut album. It was a rough introduction to the music industry for Fabolous: Once, the label paid Lil Wayne $100,000 and four bottles Cristal out of Fabolous’ budget to record a guest verse for the Brooklyn rapper. Lil Wayne showed up for 15 minutes, laid down a verse, grabbed the bottles of Cristal, and left without as much as acknowledging Fab. When Clue left Interscope, Fab followed, and together they signed a distribution deal with Elektra Records. But still, Fabolous was rooted in the mixtape world—spitting verses was all he knew, hooks and song structure were an afterthought. In 2001, on “Fantastic Four Pt. 2,” one of rap’s signature mixtape posse cuts, Fabolous held his own, but was ultimately in the shadow of Cam’ron, Styles P, and Jadakiss. Compared to those larger than life personalities, Fab’s laid back persona was easy to overlook. But his appeal would fully emerge when a fledgling R&B singer asked DJ Clue for help. Lil Mo, a Long Island-born singer who emerged in the late ’90s as a protege of Missy Elliott, was in search of a hit of her own. Her first attempt “Superwoman (Part I)” was a misfire, and the desperate R&B singer brought the song to DJ Clue and convinced him to do a remix using a beat originally intended for the rap duo M.O.P. Next, she needed a guest verse, and instead of turning to Missy, Mo asked Clue about Fabolous. “She came to Clue and was like, ‘Who’s that kid on your mixtapes doing those freestyles? That kid is hot,’” Fabolous later said. Featuring Fabolous, “Superwoman Pt. II,” was released in early 2001, and pushed on DJ Clue’s preferred platform: radio and mixtape placements. Over a quintessential early 2000s beat, which similar to an early Missy and Timabland track sounds like demented funk, Fabolous balances the punchline-driven rhymes the underground loved with a swag and good looks perfect for MTV. That summer, “Superwoman Pt. II” hit No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Within months, Fabolous went from an underground mixtape rapper to a rising Brooklyn phenom, with a highly anticipated debut album set to be released on September 11. On the morning of Ghetto Fabolous, Fabolous was prepared to begin his rollout and ready to face what he thought would be his biggest obstacle: JAY-Z. Earlier in the year, the Roc-A-Fella overlord moved the release date up a week for The Blueprint, soon to be one of hip-hop’s definitive albums. Fab was unconcerned and delusional—he shrugged off JAY’s competition on an episode of 106 & Park—until he woke up the morning of his debut to a phone call where he was told his press day was cancelled and he should turn on the television. “I thought Hov had sabotaged everything,” Fabolous later said. But when he tuned in, it was just in time to see the second plane crash into the twin towers. Fabolous climbed on the roof of the Brevoort Houses in Bed-Stuy and watched the smoke from the World Trade Center’s towers fill the sky. New York was thrust into panic mode: first responders flooded the scene, parents fought to reach their kids at schools, and the city began to shut down. While the world watched in horror, a nation and by extension its culture, began to rally around the flag. In the coming months, patriotic anthems suddenly became Billboard charting hits: Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” Alan Jackson’s “Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning.” Films, television, and even comics became either a source of unity—Marvel comics published an issue which featured major superheroes as sidekicks to firefighters and police officers, and The West Wing responded with a preachy special on terrorism—or unintended escapism: the boom in fantasy films. Everything was looked at through the lens of 9/11, even Ghetto Fabolous. Ghetto Fabolous—the name a spin on a term credited to record executive Andre Harrell—was reinterpreted by listeners in whichever way they see fit. The music video for his lead single “Can’t Deny It,” featuring smooth-talking G-Funk crooner Nate Dogg, unintentionally became a patriotic symbol because of its red, white, and blue color scheme. “We ended up having the No. 1 video at MTV when the stats came back, they pushed that forward on their own,” Fab said in an interview. “They wanted that video to be No. 1 because of what it symbolized and what it showed visually.” No matter how much he raps about drug dealing and murder, the album always feels like a celebratory rags-to-riches story. “Most broads I done met, ain’t see a guy/Who spend a G on Gucci T’s, five for sweats/I’m what chicks strive to get, I stay in the PJ’s/You thinkin’ Brevoort, I’m talkin’ private jets,” he says on “Ma’ Be Easy.” But Ghetto Fabolous is most effective when he embraces the hip-hop and R&B formula, which began to pick up steam after Diddy organized Jodeci’s “Come and Talk to Me (Hip Hop Remix)” in the early ’90s, but exploded with a big-budget pop-friendly slickness in the early 2000s. Fab would inject the style with his wordy punchlines, nonchalant delivery, and constantly spelling his name like he’s afraid you’ll forget. On “Take You Home,” Fab reunites with Lil Mo and her soothing hook seamlessly complements his raps that sound like they were pulled from the back half of a lengthy Clue Tape. “I love the way you smirk and giggle, jerk and wiggle/Throw yo’ legs up while I work the middle,” he says, with a bold confidence that makes up for cheesiness and a lack of originality. He captures similar energy with Jagged Edge on “Trade It All,” though the crew belts a chorus that could have been recorded by any of the R&B groups of the era. Yet, with Fab’s calm demeanor, the song is low stakes and breezy, ready for a day of consuming nutcrackers at the beach. Beatmakers of the moment like Timbaland and Just Blaze briefly appear and hand Fab instrumentals fitting for the celebration. Timbaland’s beat on “Right Now and Later On” is true to his signature organized chaos, and Fab’s verses are pure escapism. “Fab’s hard to be found/But most likely I’m with a foreign dame who name’s hard to pronounce/I started out, gettin’ hard by the ounce/No more cash in stashes, it’s cards in accounts,” he raps, blurring the lines between reflections on his past and fiction. Just Blaze’s “Ma’ Be Easy” instrumental would make any New Yorker Harlem Shake after a sip or two of brown liquor, and Fab catches the perfect balance between punchlines you can’t wait to forget and memorable ones: “I be the club king with diamonds shuffling your friends.” On the album’s centerpiece, “Young’n (Holla Back),” the Neptunes convince Fabolous to embrace the goofier side of his personality. Initially, Fab was against the idea, he wanted to make something harder, but Pharrell pushed him to be inspired by rap flows of the past. “He said, ‘You should rhyme like Rob Base or Vanilla Ice,’” Fab reflected. “Then he went into the vocal booth and did a reference vocal himself. We was laughing, but it sounded alright.” He makes Pharell’s vision, which certainly would have been corny in someone else’s hands, come to life, while still getting off the chest-puffing street raps he was known for: “Thuggin’ jeans and Timbs/Fitted to the front lean the brim/Ride but never on teenage rims/And I keep a chick’s face between my limbs.” Part of the broadly appealing balance that made Ghetto Fabolous the perfect album to lighten the city’s mood. In the years since, Fabolous has become a debated figure in Brooklyn rap lore: To some, he’s forever synonymous with cheesy punchlines, uninspired beat selection, and questionable fashion choices, and to others, he’s an example of consistency, a trusted guest feature, and an underappreciated ability to adapt his style to fit the times. In reality, it’s probably a bit of both, though Ghetto Fabolous is by far the best iteration of Fab, for a moment the only person cooler in Brooklyn was JAY-Z. It’s easy to look back at the formulaic R&B hooks, dated production, and mixed bag of punchlines, and say that Ghetto Fabolous was never any good. But that would be removing the context of a moment, where Fabolous was a breath of fresh air for a city grappling with a new normal.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley Chapter 1: Snake Oil,Diplo,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed0323091e9d15571ac9304/1:1/w_160/Diplo%20Presents%20Thomas%20Wesley%20Chapter%201-%20Snake%20Oil_Diplo.jpg,2020-05-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/diplo-diplo-presents-thomas-wesley-chapter-1-snake-oil/,Columbia,"For every Diplo that you see—slouched on a Zoom DJ set in a shirt that says “Mercury’s in quarantine,” slack-jawed on a red carpet in a bright pink cowboy hat—there are maybe five Diplos you don’t see. There he is, folded into Jack Ü, working with Skrillex to make the best song of Justin Bieber’s career. Catch him in the Mark Ronson collab group Silk City, throwing throbbing beats under a Dua Lipa track. You could be forgiven for not knowing Diplo is part of Major Lazer, or that he toured with Grimes on a train across Canada, or that he produced two songs on Beyoncé’s Lemonade. And if you lost track of who ended up on which remix of Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” as the song contorted into genre after genre (K-pop! Kidz Bop!), maybe you forgot that Diplo was the one to make it shiver and surge into electronica. Diplo is aware of his tendency to be both ubiquitous and forgotten; he named a 2014 album Random White Dude Be Everywhere. His new album, a purported country record trickled down from the success of “Old Town Road” and the meme-level pervasiveness of the yeehaw agenda, has his real name in the title, signifying a shift from sparkly club bangers. Snake Oil is a country album the same way Westworld is a western, or “Cotton Eye Joe” is a saloon ballad. The record is steeped in stock-image cowboy aesthetics. A fiddle trembles through AutoTune. “Uh, uh, do si do,” Blanco Brown grunts, 18 times in two and a half minutes. In Diplo’s world, the Jonas Brothers are as convincing a country group as the Zac Brown Band; they bleat about hometowns, back roads, and “giving into love,” while crawling guitars give into beat drops and blurry synths. But Diplo succeeds in what he sets out to do: He braids classic Diploisms into country frameworks, and sometimes, he doesn’t sound like Diplo at all. Such is the case on the best song on the album, “On Mine,” a gentle, rasping Noah Cyrus love song. The production borders on theatrical—melodramatic wobbling bass, a chorus of layered vocals, seconds-long cymbal reverb echoing at the end—but this is still Diplo at his most subdued. “I don’t know if I can walk this world alone,” Cyrus pleads. The chorus rises in a swelling mash of instruments; it’s close to sounding genuinely euphoric, a mood Diplo typically reserves for juddering bass-blasted rave tracks. On “Dance With Me,” he coaxes strumming guitars into muted tropical house as Young Thug snakes around the beat and country-pop songwriter Thomas Rhett croons, “Give me your body.” It’s as danceable and easily dissolved as any summertime Top 40 radio hit. You don’t listen to a Diplo album for the songwriting, and Snake Oil suffocates in treacly kitsch. Song titles betray the generic romance clichés: “Heartless,” “Heartbreak,” “Real Life Stuff.” “I guess what goes up, it must come down,” Ben Burgess drawls over trudging 808s. “Just because you’re out here running doesn’t make you free,” cries the country singer Cam. “Sometimes in life, what you wanna do isn’t necessarily what you’re gonna do,” Orville Peck says on the album’s intro, a 97-second spoken-word mush of countryisms about gunslinger showdowns and desert hideouts. It’s meant to be funny, and it is: This is Thomas Wesley’s playground, and success isn’t measured by whether his country songs are convincing or even by whether they’re good, only by whether the listener has fun. Still, the closing “Old Town Road” remix feels like a reprieve from the rest of the album, not a template for it. You want to stay in this thumping oasis, a place where Billy Ray Cyrus moans about Fenty sports bras and whistles whirl around the beat, buoyed by the simple neon ecstasy of Diplo doing what Diplo does best: soundtracking the party, wherever it leads.","Trickled down from the success of “Old Town Road” and the meme-level pervasiveness of the yeehaw agenda, the ubiquitous producer’s purported country album suffocates in treacly kitsch.

El Androide,El Alfa,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed02b151628a7bc78de1a77/1:1/w_160/El%20Androide_El%20Alfa.jpg,2020-05-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/el-alfa-el-androide/,El Jefe,"Urbano’s various genres and styles come from across the Americas: Latin trap was born in the U.S., reggaeton in Panama and Puerto Rico, champeta in Colombia, and baile funk in Brazil. Dembow is the Dominican Republic’s urbano export, but unlike the others, it has not yet had its mainstream moment. Amid the mainstream success of reggaeton and Latin trap, the rising Dominican artist El Alfa has remained steadfast, churning out dembow hits and becoming the go-to guest feature for other urbano artists looking to dabble in the genre. He’s also responsible for dembow’s highest-profile moment to date, the stunning trap/dembow/bachata megamix that was Bad Bunny’s “La Romana.” If anyone was poised to carry the dembow torch into the 2020s with a massive dembow album, it was him. El Androide is not that record. El Alfa is still a dembowsero, but his latest LP is all over the sonic map, with romantic trap vibes (“Besalo,” “Enamore”), hints of Jamaican dancehall (“Un Dia Si,” “Singapur”), hip-hop en Español (“El Lobo de Wall Street”), Mexican folk and Colombian vallenato (“Chapon”), and even Detroit techno (“Tecnobow”). And even the dembow tracks have had their rougher edges sanded down with slick production, in stark contrast to the grittier nature of the genre’s underground roots. At 20 tracks, El Androide is essentially a double LP, with the first half consisting of 11 new songs, and the second half cobbled together from previous releases, many of which can be found on last year’s Dembo$$ EP. It’s a somewhat cynical marketing ploy to boost streams of the album with established hits, but does offer the most complete snapshot of El Alfa’s output over the past year. And that output has been mostly impressive. One of El Alfa’s—and Chael Produciendo’s, who produced much of El Androide—more impressive skills is a preternatural ability to sequence musical DNA, finding the common ancestry of different subgenres and mating them together to make something new and fresh. Beyond the trapbow, he recruits Yandel and Myke Towers for the line-blurring mashup “Dembow y Reggaeton,” and taps legendary cultural colonizer Diplo to tie the common threads between Detroit techno and dembow on “Tecnobow,” a track that effortlessly interweaves dembow’s machuqueo with a four-on-the-floor beat, lacing a Spanish dembow flow with analog electro textures. And it’s hard to pin a genre on the buoyant “A Correr los Lakers,” a goofy romp with mostly inconsequential lyrics that nonetheless sports an impossibly catchy hook and horn melody. This is the way you “cross over” in 2020; not by releasing English-language milquetoast pop with Anglo superstars, but by using the global internet to assimilate sounds from around the world into your music and make them your own. It doesn’t always work—Lil Pump’s dogshit verse ruins the otherwise catchy “Coronao Now,” and the straightforward hip-hop beat on “El Lobo de Wall Street” makes for El Androide’s most tepid offering. And dembow purists will likely be disappointed that El Alfa didn’t drop a record with the nostalgic rawness of Bad Bunny’s Las Que No Iban a Salir. But he hasn’t completely abandoned the heads; they can take solace in the fact that he makes a concerted effort to give Dominicans a signal boost, especially those whose music never gained traction off the island. “Hablamos Nunca” is a stripped-down dembow cut that features two OGs (Kiko El Crazy and El Fother) who weren’t always down with dembow—a bellwether of the genre’s sea change. The entire beat consists of drums, a bass line, and what sounds like a truncated guitar sample—and of course, the trademark repetition that makes the genre so danceable. And “Jalapeño,” one of the grimiest songs on the record, features the duo Doble T y El Crok, who hit their zenith as teens as the first artists to bring dembow to the ubiquitous variety show Sabado Gigante, but could never quite match the success of their first hit “Pepe.” If the expectation was for El Alfa to carry dembow into the mainstream, he most certainly has: El Androide debuted in the top 10 on Billboard’s Latin Albums chart. It might not look or sound exactly like the grimy old school jams that persisted in the underground while battling a classist and racist stigma on the island, but it pays homage to its roots in a different way—songs like “Singapur” and “Un Dia Si” draw directly from the Jamaican dancehall toolkit upon which dembow was originally formed. And most importantly, the beats still knock, and are sure to make even the most determined demagogos—the Dominican version of a “hater”—move their bodies. So even if his sound has veered from the streets, it’s aimed directly at the club, and is poised to dominate the dance floor.","The rising Dominican star carries dembow into the mainstream on this mammoth double album, sanding down some of the grimy genre’s rough edges in the process.

Methods Body,Methods Body,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd487691dbebb858d7ecec/1:1/w_160/Methods%20Body_Methods%20Body.jpg,2020-05-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/methods-body-methods-body/,Beacon SoundNew Amsterdam,"In Methods Body’s music, nothing feels fixed in place. The drums-and-electronics duo’s debut album is as slippery as the deck of a boat in a storm: Muscular rhythms in strange time signatures, microtonal prepared-piano riffs, droning feedback—they all careen back and forth, colliding, breaking into pieces. The result is a gnarled hybrid of free improv, minimalist composition, and dance music that advances in fits and starts, repetitive until it is not, knotty until it turns unexpectedly smooth. Despite the size of their sound, Methods Body are just two people: drummer John Niekrasz and multi-instrumentalist Luke Wyland. Niekrasz studied percussion in Cuba and classical Hindustani tabla in India, and his CV boasts collaborations with everyone from drone titan Rhys Chatham to jazz pianist Marilyn Crispell to Joanna Newsom. Wyland was, until 2013, a core member of the group AU, whose fractured, brightly colored fusions of American minimalism and kaleidoscopic art rock anticipated some of Methods Body’s more song-like moments. Methods Body share a lineage with bands like Battles and Horse Lords, groups working at the intersection of rock and non-Western sonics; in places, they tap into the metallic shimmer of Indonesian gamelan, or the tube-driven glow of Konono N°1. Though this is Methods Body’s first recorded work as a duo, they have been playing together since 2016, practicing five days a week in their shared studio and recording in remote locations: a saloon in the Mojave Desert, a cabin in the Oregon wilderness. But Methods Body feels less rooted in any particular sense of place than in the act of spontaneous creation itself; if there are landscapes here, they are represented as seen through the passenger window at 70 miles per hour, a blur of lines and vectors and splotchy color, morphing without end. The album’s nine tracks are divided into two side-long suites. The A-side’s “Quiet Pt. 1 – They Didn’t Come Here” begins with layered reeds and sour-tuned plunks, then gallops unpredictably forward, moving in cellular fashion: Rhythmic, repetitive passages build and build, then pivot without warning. “Quiet Pt. 2 – Tell Us to Be” is a silvery reflecting pool of dissonant piano that launches into slow, skulking electric bass, half doom metal and half dubstep wobble. In “Quiet Pt. 3 – They Came Here,” a stomping, polyrhythmic groove gives way to ostinato pianos that sound like a junkyard Philip Glass. The first side comes to a head with “Quiet Pt. 5 – Anthem,” whose monster organ riffs channel ’70s prog beneath wild, guitar-like soloing. The music lumbers like beasts fighting, then pausing to suck air—moments of feral violence punctuated by seething calm. If the A-side suite is driven by rhythm, the B-side’s four-part “Claimed Events” is an exploration of pure texture, in which piano and electronics rush like water over gravelly drums. Niekrasz favors sounds like resonant toms and the dry clatter of sticks against metal rims; Wyland wrangles plasticky, atonal sounds, bright sheets of tone that crinkle like cellophane. It’s rarely clear what the two men are doing at any given point, how much has been tracked live and how much overdubbed later—there are so many layers, it generally feels like more music than four hands are capable of producing. But the back-and-forth exchange between their playing makes clear that their music is a form of dialog. In fact, both musicians say that language is an influence on their practice. Niekrasz, who got his MFA in poetry from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, composes using a system he calls “syllabic notation,” translating the rhythms and tonalities of speech into drum patterns. Wyland, who stutters, finds inspiration in the cadences of broken speech. Methods Body only incorporates text in one song, but it’s a highlight of the album. In “Claimed Events Pt. 2 – Overheard,” the duo falls into what might be a funeral march—a slow, steady tom groove backed by mournful drones—that gradually gives way to an eerie chant from Wyland’s former bandmate Holland Andrews. The low, monotone chant hovers just on the far side of sense: “My friends, however, claimed events would identify them—but to overhear and accept only one month to prepare us in a very small room with rubble in one corner.” What looks dryly factual on the page, like a scrap of newspaper, takes on a weird, ritual sensibility in repetition—line breaks blurred, stresses sanded down, meaning dissolved into pure sonority. It is simultaneously the most calming and unsettling moment on an album in which all certainties feel up for grabs.","The drums-and-electronics duo’s debut album is a gnarled hybrid of free improv, minimalist composition, and dance music that advances in fits and starts.

Dedicated Side B,Carly Rae Jepsen,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd39e591dbebb858d7ece3/1:1/w_160/Dedicated%20Side%20B_Carly%20Rae%20Jepsen.jpg,2020-05-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carly-rae-jepsen-dedicated-side-b/,Interscope,"The Hulu television series Normal People, which follows a tenuous love affair between two academically bright but emotionally obtuse students, has everything your sophisticated millennial could want. Based on a Sally Rooney novel of the same name, the sexy Irish drama serves you wispy bangs, small boob representation, and—if you squint!—Marxist undertones. But it also offers a soft and stunning exploration of desire, the kind of intimacy that strips you of pretense, leaving you vulnerable to the world. The show features music of varying resonance: Selena Gomez’s too-precious “Rare” soundtracks a party scene when the doe-eyed ingenue meets a sadist, and Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek”—hallowed season finale material—is sacrilegiously wedged into the second episode. But midway through the series is a perfect alignment of song and scene. The morning after sleeping together, two friends linger in the kitchen. Everything is new, provisional: their conversation is suffused with longing. Wafting in the background is Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Too Much,” about the tingly uncertainty of liking someone: “Is this too, is this too/Is this too much?” This too much-ness, the spilling over boundaries of acceptable displays of emotion, undergirds much of Carly Rae Jepsen’s breathless music. Her songs brush against a scary reality. You may insist on your independence, your detachment, your self-conscious cool, but one day you will be unraveled by someone: their look, their memory, their touch. In Carly Rae Jepsen’s songs, there is always a “you” pressing against the “I,” a slippery object of yearning that colors its subject. Or as she sings on her last album Dedicated, “I think I’m coming alive with you.” A year after Dedicated’s release, Jepsen has surprise-dropped a collection of outtakes from the album, just as she did for 2015’s Emotion. Side B arrives at the perfect time. For many, quarantine has stalled romantic intrigue; without someone to pine over, our cramped, dull existence seems even more confining. Whereas Dedicated started out low-key, its counterpart immediately explodes with feeling: ’80s-inspired opening track “This Love Isn’t Crazy” pairs a volcanic chorus with pleading “baby/crazy/save me” rhymes. It’s a little too conventionally CRJ, but it’s still a joyful reprieve, like a fizzy drink after some 9-5 drudgery. As Jepsen tells it, “I wanted to flip the switch and just be like, ‘Welcome to love, everyone! We’re going to have a party! Stop cleaning your house!’” Side B demonstrates her range, teasing a few different lanes from the original’s “chill disco.” She originally wrote 200-something songs for Dedicated, and had such difficulty whittling it down that she floated the idea of a 50-track deluxe edition. With its tinsel synths and watery marimba, “Now I Don’t Hate California After All” sounds like Christmas on the beach; “Window” is buttery funk-pop that gestures toward her debut, Tug of War. Her lyrics venture away from shy flirtation, hinting at bickering, cruelty, and ambivalence. “I’m at war with myself,” Jepsen admits on the hazy, wistful “Comeback.” Some songs, meanwhile, are unapologetically hot. The feathery, mid-tempo “Felt This Way” shows Jepsen obsessing over a lover’s touch; “Stay Away” is the same song after a shot of vodka. The double-hitter is a peek into Jepsen’s songwriting process, revealing how the same text can be manipulated in different but equally compelling directions. “Both our hands speak for us and complicate it,” she sings. “How can I stay away?” Equally sexy but weirder is “Fake Mona Lisa,” which recalls the reckless fun of Katy Perry’s “Last Friday Night.” For a brief moment, Jepsen’s lover is hypnotized by the lipstick-smudged woman in the DaVinci print, who becomes Jepsen’s sexual competition. Then he comes to his senses, and undresses her. A few years ago, Carly Rae Jepsen proclaimed to “really really really really really really like you.” She thrived in this gap, between the intensity of the “really really”-s and the hesitation of the “like.”  When she tries to bridge the divide on “Let’s Sort the Whole Thing Out,” it’s a little jarring. The song is about feeling insecure in a new relationship, only for your partner to ardently commit to you out of the blue. Its twinkly, vacant Mattel doll sheen makes his chirped “I love you” seem implausible, perfunctory—simultaneously too much and not enough. (It doesn’t help that it sounds like the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend theme song “Meet Rebecca!”) “Let’s Sort The Whole Thing Out” is one of a few deflating moments for an otherwise exhilarating artist; another is “Heartbeat,” a total snooze of a prom song. While Jepsen makes B-sides markedly better than other artists’ A-sides, she can still falter; some points feel like kissing a crush for the first time and missing the spark.","With big hooks and breathless romance galore, Carly’s leftovers from last year’s Dedicated show off her range, even when the songs start to lose their spark.

Domesticated,Sébastien Tellier,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd3d4e91dbebb858d7ece6/1:1/w_160/Domesticated_Se%CC%81bastien%20Tellier.jpg,2020-05-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sebastien-tellier-domesticated/,Record Makers,"A vast amount of music is consumed at home, often lightening the domestic chores that map out our days. It’s a surprise, then, that so few musicians draw direct inspiration from the day-to-day grind of domesticity. Gnomic French musician Sébastien Tellier says that his sixth album, Domesticated, was inspired by dirty dishes in the sink, soiled laundry on the floor, and the two children responsible for so much of that mess; reflecting that mundane magic, its eight songs drift by on a light glaze of electro disco. This kind of mischievous concept suits Tellier, a singer who mixes the exotic with the humdrum and the sublime with the ridiculous. You can imagine him pushing the vacuum cleaner around his chic Paris apartment to the disco boogie of “Venezia,” while the Valium melancholy on a song like “Stuck in a Summer Love” raises the mournful spirit of Chris de Burgh’s ’80s standard “The Lady in Red.” Both songs seem tailor-made for washing up tearfully to daytime radio. On the whole, though, Tellier doesn’t seem to land the theme. “A Ballet,” for example, plays on the French word for “broom"" (“balai”), a borderline pun that few listeners outside of France will understand, while the very repetitive lyrics to “Domestic Tasks” barely expand on the promise of the title. It’s not that this record is ill suited to domesticity, exactly, but if someone claimed that Domesticated was actually about round-the-world yachting or Olympic diving you could easily believe them. Luckily, Tellier has a production concept too. His aim on Domesticated was to assemble a new wave of producers—including Jam City and France’s Corentin Kerdraon, aka NIT—to create a futuristic pop sound, leaving him free to concentrate on his supposed melodic strengths. The result is a devilishly lush instrumental vibe, whose wipe-clean aesthetic brings to mind ’80s pop refracted through the robotic luster of Jam City’s Classical Curves. “A Ballet” comes replete with soaring sax break and aching Art of Noise chords, while the electro-synth shuffle of “Hazy Feelings” seems to crave the sweetly anachronistic release of a slap bass, without ever giving in to temptation. These production choices—while not as futuristic as Tellier might like to believe—do at least fit with Domesticated’s homely theme, gleaming like the well-polished kitchen surfaces of a Patrick Bateman fantasy. But Tellier’s unassuming voice, so touching in its modesty on his 2003 classic “La Ritournelle,” suffers from the slaver of vocoder-esque effects. It sounds at times like Tellier is singing with a mouthful of porridge from the back of a wardrobe, the lyrics indiscernible to all but his closest associates, which leaves the melodies with a heavy emotional weight to convey. This shouldn’t be a problem: you don’t represent France in the Eurovision Song Contest (as Tellier did in 2008) without being able to pen a golden refrain. But the album’s odd moments of melodic sparkle—the winsome desire lines of “Won” or the doleful swoon of “Oui”—are never quite enough, symptomatic of a record that comes tantalizingly close to satisfying without quite scaling the heights. Domesticated is a concept album whose concept falls flat; a shot at the future that’s too in debt to the past; a brilliant idea consumed by inertia—less back-breaking deep clean than half-hearted tidy.","The idiosyncratic electro-pop singer-songwriter (and Eurovision contestant) turns his pen to the mundane magic of household chores, but it too often looks like he missed a spot.

EVERYTHING YOU HEARD IS TRUE,Odunsi (The Engine),by: Israel Daramola,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec53b191ed2d15ae8657e25/1:1/w_160/Odunsi%20(The%20Engine)_Everything%20You%20Heard%20Is%20True.jpg,2020-05-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/odunsi-the-engine-everything-you-heard-is-true/,Kimani Moore Entertainment,"From the first moments of opening track “luv in a mosh pit,” EVERYTHING YOU HEARD IS TRUE—the effortlessly sexy new album from burgeoning Nigerian alt-pop artist/producer Odunsi (The Engine)—sweeps you up in bygone visions of nightlife partying and youthful indiscretions. The music conjures sweaty basement parties, awash in red neon lights and the heat of strangers all around, where life is only as important as the moment you’re in. It might seem cruel to reminisce over tightly packed clubs in the middle of a pandemic, but the crush of quarantine only enhances the album’s rosy, nostalgic glow. The artist, born Bowofoluwa Olufisayo Odunsi in Lagos, Nigeria, first came onto the scene with his 2016 EP TIME OF OUR LIVES. On EVERYTHING YOU HEARD IS TRUE, the follow-up to his debut, 2018’s rare, he continues to distill his eclectic influences into something all his own. Mashing the singing voice of Ralph Tresvant or Frank Ocean with light Afrobeat influences and the sensibilities of Prince if he were a Soundcloud rapper, he has tapped into a startlingly modern take on the R&B coming out of Nigeria. Odunsi sings with irresistible magnetism and confidence, and his lines have a repetitive, nursery-rhyme cadence. On “airplane mode,” he harmonizes in a gentle near-whisper, hopscotching through sweet club nothings like “Shawty don’t talk like I know ya/ Shawty don’t talk like I owe ya.” On “PDA!,” he borrows from Rihanna’s “Umbrella,” shouting “freaky Margiela ela ela eh eh” over bouncy synths. The record captures early love’s sweetness even as Odunsi’s lyrics veer explicitly into cynical machismo (on “airplane mode,” he sings: “You be playing games that I taught you, had to get money had to stunt on you”). The bitterness is leavened by the sweetness of the music, and by the overall mood of love-drunk melancholy. To play on a famous Straylight Run song, the theme seems to be Existentialism on Club Night. At only seven short tracks, there’s very little wasted space or energy. The brevity contributes to the cohesion, allowing Odunsi to hold tightly onto the specific mood he sets. It’s a complete thought, and the vibe it conjures is vivid and glamorous enough to induce pangs. With such a short runtime, it leaves you wanting more, but at least it leaves you wanting.","The rising star’s effortlessly sexy new album offers a startlingly modern take on the R&B coming out of Nigeria.

Cold Water,Medhane,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec3ef56caddbe3e3b13ab74/1:1/w_160/Medhane.jpg,2020-05-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/medhane-cold-water/,self-released,"Medhane raps a lot about where he’s going and how he’s getting there. So many of his songs are about forward momentum: taking strides, chasing truth, setting his own pace. But movement without direction is simply wasted energy, and where his previous projects occasionally resembled lyrical exercises that developed a philosophy and a worldview in real time, his new album, Cold Water, feels like putting long-held plans into motion. Scars and trauma have been markers of Medhane’s raps, but he’s no longer bound by those wounds, he’s empowered by them. “I ain’t show it but I’ve been through the most/Took a minute just to get in my glow,” he says on “Na Fr.” While he’s no clearer about the origins of his injuries, he bears down on the lessons he can extract from them. The result: His most present and clear-eyed project. These songs aren’t just about perseverance anymore; they’re about taking action—using experience as a teacher and a guide. On 2018’s Ba Sub, Ak Jaam, Medhane explained that his father told him “always choose your words,” guidance he internalized. As he put it, he was speaking with his chest while others stumbled over what to say. On Cold Water, there is even more force and focus behind his bars. The verses on songs like “Late” and “I’m Deadass” are painlessly tricky, never sacrificing their immediacy in their pursuit of uncluttering his mind. “No Cap” and “All Facts” feel like chapters ripped from a hidden, hand-written manifesto. The rapping on Full Circle, the mixtape he released earlier this year, was economical at the expense of impact, but here, Medhane pairs concision with power. Medhane cites New York City stalwarts Roc Marciano and Ka as influences—you can hear them in his measured, unembellished delivery and in his bare-bones production. After producing all of Full Circle himself under the moniker AFB, he takes a step back on Cold Water. Duties are shared with Ohbliv, Alexander Spit, Chuck Strangers, Navy Blue, and frequent collaborators Bori, iblss, and Stoney. This is, without question, the best-produced project of his career so far. His production on Full Circle was intrusive, and the loops enveloped him like tidal waves crashing ashore. Cold Water, by comparison, is more understated and invigorating. The beats are gorgeously gritty, warped yet whole; he remolds jazz and soul samples as if from particles of sand, which brings the clarity of the raps into sharper relief. There’s a lot of rapping about mazes, and Medhane usually sounds like he’s writing his way out of them. But his rhymes have never been more direct than they are on “New Drip” and “Truth & Soul.” He unlocks each song with probing flows, finds his way to its center, and then he retraces his steps outward. Relationships often serve as his compass. By now, that posse of musicians has begun to formalize: MIKE, Navy Blue, Jasper Marsalis, Maassai, Gio Escobar, Caleb Giles, and Akai Solo. All have had some impact on the way he thinks about rapping, producing, and improving. “Love my brothers but I seen ’em change/For the better,” he raps on “Live,” an affirmation of collective growth. In addition to finding refuge in his little tribe, he’s now maneuvering on its behalf. These songs aren’t just bound by all the shared wisdom of his insulated hip-hop commune, they expand the movement and stand for those in it. “Working while they talking/Ball in my court/My little sister growing so you know who it’s for,” he raps on “No Cap.” A self-sufficient rap co-op is only as strong as its weakest link. “On a mission since the sandbox/I ain’t winning if my man lost,” he adds on “Full Hands.” There are still plenty of unanswered questions on Cold Water, but you get the sense that all the things left unsaid are stoking Medhane’s quiet resolve. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.","On his latest project, the Brooklyn rapper realizes his vision. His forceful and focused bars are just one aspect of the highly skilled emcee’s community-focused and spiritually rewarding music.

WUNNA,Gunna,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd43d11ed2d15ae8658231/1:1/w_160/Wunna_Gunna.jpg,2020-05-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gunna-wunna/,Young Stoner Life300,"Gunna’s lifestyle is less like a rapper and more like one of Bravo’s Real Housewives. He shops, travels, hangs out with his rapper friends, and has few issues outside of what color Audemars Piguet watch he should wear on his wrist or if his new pair of Amiri jeans will fit nicely around his waist. Among his Atlanta peers, he’s the most predictable. Listening to a Gunna album or tape is easy and familiar, like turning on the television and landing on a marathon of your favorite sitcom. The difference between Gunna’s best verses and his worst is at the molecular level: The best are easily recitable and bring color to his lavish lifestyle; the worst are basically the same except it just sounds like he’s going through the motions. On WUNNA, the 26-year-old’s latest, Gunna has the heart and is the most engaged he’s sounded since his 2018 breakthrough, Drip Season 3. (Insanely, WUNNA is an acronym—“Wealthy unapologetic nigga naturally authentic”—and as you would expect he explained the title in an interview as, “Honestly, I was just high, bro.”) WUNNA is more than an endless barrage of boasts about his designer clothes and foreign whips; the flows are crisper, his puns are more colorful, and the beats are pristine (new-age Atlanta beat-making royalty Wheezy and Turbo are mainly behind the boards). On the calm, Turbo-produced single “Wunna,” Gunna’s flow is patient, every word is emphasized. And then on the intro, “Argentina,” he changes paces with ease. Thanks to his bank of deliveries and melodies, his flexes stick. “It’s easy to slip, don’t want you to fall/Walk in with the drip at Met Gala ball,” he croons on the “Met Gala” hook. It’s a simple line that could have been generated by a bot, but through sweet vocals, it becomes something more. WUNNA hits a stride when it becomes a family affair. Much like “Sold Out Dates” and “Drip Too Hard,” “Blindfold” is like hanging out with Gunna and Lil Baby as they partake in a fashion duel: Gunna has a new pair of Rick Owens jeans and Lil Baby can’t decide if he wants to lace up his Dior or Jordan sneakers. Similarly, the album revolves around a pair of collaborations with Young Thug. “Dollaz on My Head” is ripped by Thug and Gunna is smoothly rapping about spending a bag on Prada. Followed by “Far,” their second collaboration, a welcomed disruption, and a rare moment of introspection. “I ain’t tryna talk down ’cause I know niggas be hardhead/Thinkin’ about how they put my brother in the ground, had to pour up more red,” wails Gunna, as it slides into a vulnerable territory he should go to more often. But, of course, at 18 tracks, there are moments when Gunna lapses into monotony. The nearly four-minute two-parter “Nasty Girl/On Camera” is tiresome, and guest features by Roddy Ricch and Travis Scott seem like nothing more than formalities to juice streaming numbers. Yet it’s hard to not have fun when Gunna is telling posh tales in a rushed melody over Wheezy and Turbo beats that sound like an elevator ride up to a penthouse. Like “I’m On Some,” where Gunna reflects about the moments he truly cherishes: a New York trip to buy baguette diamonds from celebrity jeweler Elliott Eliantte and purchasing his latest girlfriend liposuction just to brighten her mood. Who else can sound so unrelatable, materialistic, and superficial, and still remain charming? Only Gunna.","The 26-year-old sounds reinvigorated on his latest—the flows are crisper, his puns are more colorful, and the beats are pristine.

Taken Away,Moodymann,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd38abfcb5f329163e0b22/1:1/w_160/Taken%20Away_Moodymann.jpg,2020-05-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moodymann-taken-away/,KDJ,"If you’re black in the U.S., anything from shopping for prom clothes to being a firefighter to minding your own business in your own home can prompt people to call the cops on you. When people call in the police, the force might drag you half-naked into the street; they might pull out your tampon during a cavity search in the middle of that street; they might well kill you. In 2019, according to the Los Angeles Times, “Getting killed by police [was] a leading cause of death for young black men in America.” This shouldn’t happen to anybody; it shouldn’t happen to one of the most gifted musicians to come out of Detroit. But because this is America, it happened to Kenny Dixon, Jr., better known as deep-house hero Moodymann, whose career spans 25-plus years and an influence that can’t be overstated. Dixon was sitting in a van outside his own building in Detroit when someone reported “suspicious behavior” and the cops rolled up with their chaos. He made it out alive. Echoes of the conflict are all over his new album. Taken Away dispenses immersion therapy like last year’s woozy beaut, Sinner, and stinks of George Clinton like 2014’s self-titled long-player. But there’s often an ache where the fun used to be. There’s funk, in both senses of the world. “Goodbye Everybody” summons Lowell Fulson’s “Prison Bound,” swapping the original’s bluesy stomp for a roiling swamp of what sound like detuned bells and percussion that hisses like tasers. It’s closer in spirit to Erykah Badu than, say, boompty house. The crisp breaks and comfy swing of “Let Me In” could be legit Badu, or even Mary J., but Moodymann counters the grace of the (uncredited) female voices with spite: “You’ve never been a good soul to anyone/Especially me.” Some tracks are plush. “Let Me Show You Love” is maybe the most flat-out gorgeous thing he’s made to date, a velveteen expanse of sparkling melodies and little sequin-bright effects and blissed-out whispers. The purple chords and compressed tumble of “I Need Another ____” are horny as hell, but the “relief” that Dixon and his female companions call out for sounds as material and existential as it is sexual. “Just Stay a While” lights up the room with a fiber-optic bassline and irresistible beat; a quiet-storm interlude blows through every now and then, increasing the humidity without relieving it. If the vocals were glamorous, the song could be Luomo. Instead the sentiment is: “My back’s against the wall.” And not because nobody’s dancing. “Slow Down” does just that, buoyed by overlapping vocal vamps and a warm piano riff, and it’s just the sound of summer, complete with kids enjoying themselves. Until sirens interrupt. Most of Taken Away is fascinatingly ambivalent. A couple tracks lose their balance altogether. “I’m Already Hi” is a person-to-person skit backed up with some light jazz and scatting. It’s fine if what you want from one of the greatest house producers alive is a skit; if not, well, it’s over soon. Less funny are the album’s opener and closer, two versions of “Do Wrong” built on Al Green’s “Love and Happiness” but without much of either. Mixed deep in a midtempo shuffle of organ and tambourine and preacher calls, Moodymann sourly brings receipts to a no-good ex. “You’ve got me back in church,” he sneers, in a way that sounds more like he’d been punished than redeemed. Green was perhaps the most tender of soul singers; he also, among other cruelties, beat his pregnant wife with a boot when she refused to have sex with him. Moodymann chants, “You better find a way to love me/’Cause if you don’t, somebody else will,” while Green eggs him on with wait-a-minutes and yeahs. The groove might get your head bopping with a bad taste in your mouth, wondering if she’s better off without him. Regardless, Moodymann remains a master of repetition as a form of challenge. In his 1996 epic “I Can’t Kick This Feeling When It Hits,” he takes a quick hit of Chic (“What am I gonna do?” from “I Want Your Love”) and copies it over and over in a feat of disco endurance; the expression shifts from ecstasy to paranoid chant to paralysis and back. He’s also an expert at tension and release. His 1999 classic “Shades of Jae” holds back the kick so long that the samples of crowd cheers seem to shimmer in desperation. Title track “Taken Away” uses both strategies—but to ruminate. Moodymann shatters the crystalline grief of Roberta Flack’s “Sunday and Sister Jones” like a brick through a window. In Flack’s telling, a reverend’s wife wails and warns God not to let her husband die, or she will too: “Lord, if you take him away,” she sings, “I don’t want to live another day.” They both pass. “Sister Jones was taken away,” Flack mourns. Moodymann picks up her phrasings and lets each one glint in the cold glint of his groove, closer in tempo and timbre to Massive Attack’s “Unfinished Sympathy” than his usual hedonism. The “taken” brings to mind the endless chain of handcuffs, stretchers, coffins; the “away” becomes prison and beyond. Sirens again disrupt focus. When the hi-hat finally opens up about halfway in, it’s less a longed-for exhalation than just a moment to breathe. If you can.","Following a 2019 episode of police harassment in front of his own building, the Detroit house legend’s latest goes hard on depth and funk, but there’s often an ache where the fun used to be.

"Introduction, Presence",Nation of Language,by: David Glickman,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd35f2fdf28c81baeabd15/1:1/w_160/Introduction,%20Presence_Nation%20of%20Language.jpg",2020-05-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nation-of-language-introduction-presence/,self-released,"After Ian Devaney’s first band—the polished, punk-tinged rockers Static Jacks—fell apart in the early 2010s, the singer sought comfort in recreating the synth pop of his youth. What started as a nostalgia trip would eventually morph into a proper band, expanding to include ex-Static Jack member Michael Sue-Poi and synth player Aidan Noell. The band took its time, trickling out singles piecemeal before finally releasing their debut album Introduction, Presence, four years after forming. The time put in shines through; Introduction, Presence is a remarkably self-assured debut, 10 pristine pieces of synth pop that eschew dramatics for concision. Songs like “Rush & Fever” and “On Division St” reach the glory of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Human League through an attention to craft that many bands with the same influences fail to notice. The album is full of miniaturized synth flourishes and clear, crisp drum beats that were probably fussed over for months until they came out just right. Sue-Poi’s bass lines are the secret weapon,  having learned Peter Hook’s lesson that the bass can be a powerful melody instrument. Despite the shimmer, Introduction, Presence is a decidedly forlorn work, haunted by the ever-present specter of past mistakes and accumulated hardship. “I’m wasting away/I took the long road home and it never paid off for me,” Devaney sings in the album opener “Tournament” in a downcast voice that echoes through the entire record. Yet while nostalgia and longing inform the album, they never consume it, and the band knows when to push forward. “Turn the pages/Try to find another way,” he sings achingly at the end of“The Motorist,” desperate to escape this moment in his life. Introduction, Presence doesn’t offer any great reinventions. Notes of Altered Images, early Depeche Mode, or even modern contemporaries like Black Marble are impossible to ignore while listening. But their understanding of the genre they’re working in—its workings, tropes, and trappings—is so refined that they are able to boil it down to its barest essence, saving catharsis for just the right moment. That moment arrives with the album’s final song, “The Wall and I.” It shines as their most anthemic cut through just a few well-placed, dramatic keyboard notes and some unexpected guitar chords. Devaney sounds just as trapped in his circumstances as he always does, but for once it feels like he might transcend them as well. “I stared up the wall and he said/‘I don’t know’ is not an answer to the question,” he wails in the chorus, realizing he can no longer hide in indecision. Not necessarily a comforting epiphany, but fitting for an album built on making peace with the past, and taking small steps to something grander.","The synth-pop group offers a remarkably assured debut, with 10 pristine pieces that eschew dramatics for concision.

NO DREAM,Jeff Rosenstock,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec6b12a1a4e85635f12e54d/1:1/w_160/NO%20DREAM_Jeff%20Rosenstock.jpg,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeff-rosenstock-no-dream/,Polyvinyl,"Does Jeff Rosenstock ever get tired of seeing the future? Basically every musical and ethical component that his previous band Bomb the Music Industry! stood for in 2005 still remain. Bigger labels have allowed him to maintain a pay-what-you-want model that predated Radiohead’s famous method of sale for their 2007 album In Rainbows and predicted the current outright reliance on tip jars and shareware. Rosenstock’s side projects variously embrace ska, folk-punk, and Long Island pop-punk, long before these profoundly uncool offshoots were finally given their due as gateways to deeper DIY engagement. But his mainstream breakthrough didn’t arrive until 2016’s WORRY., when the election of Donald Trump accelerated America’s degradation to the point where the country started to look exactly like the worst fears of New York’s most anxious punk. After 2018’s POST- emerged to audit year one of the #Resistance, NO DREAM asks: When retail therapy, mindfulness apps, and pyrrhic political engagement all fail to provide anything more than a distraction, how do we live with ourselves? It’s quintessential Jeff Rosenstock—an album formulated around evergreen sociopolitical concerns yet sounds like it could’ve been written 30 minutes ago. Once again releasing an album with no advance warning, Rosenstock gets to the point in less than a minute with “NO TIME,” a welcome reacclimation to his hardcore roots delivered with frothing intensity. It’s a different kind of urgency than the one lent to POST-, which began with a chant of “we’re tired and bored” and ended with “we’re not gonna let them win,” less an expression of defiance than exhaustion. With meaningful, large-scale political change seeming further out of reach, the only conceivable path to serenity is having the wisdom to know what internal changes are possible. “Did you turn into a person that you really want to be?” Rosenstock yells throughout “NO TIME,” at you, at the mirror, rhetorically. Perhaps other artists have expressed more high-minded or effective anger at late capitalism’s human cost, but no one is more adept at validating the helplessness that comes from being constantly activated and totally powerless. Rosenstock’s solo career almost functions as a treatise about the lie of American industrialization. Once machines relieved humans of backbreaking physical and mental labor, surely we’d have more time to dedicate to personal improvement, community organizing, arts, and culture. Instead, the distractions just became shinier and more inescapable, the ostensible freedom of working from home revealed as being your own browbeating boss 24/7. And now that the economy has cratered and many people have nothing but time for all those New Year’s resolutions and long-shelved self-improvement projects, there’s even less incentive to take them on. The righteous aims of NO DREAM are true, even if they’re at broad targets—consumerism rebranded as morality; toxic online forums; one side of the political spectrum offering increasingly emboldened cruelty while the other is “weaponizing what’s left of your empathy.” “I’ve been told most my life, ‘Try and see the other side’/By people who have never tried to see the other side,” Rosenstock mocks during “Scram!,” giving them the half-a-bar they deserve. A few months ago, “Scram!”’s central hook (“Don’t you wanna go away?”) might’ve meant signing out of Twitter or Facebook, getting more involved in a local election, or finding solace in a marathon Death Rosenstock gig. The shoutalongs of NO DREAM are potent enough for individual use, but their communal impact is now sadly theoretical. Where does anyone go now when going off the grid means almost total disconnection from society? Two years ago, Rosenstock simply bemoaned the existence of “All This Useless Energy,” and NO DREAM tries to figure out where it eventually ends up. Fittingly, it’s far more spiteful and aggressive than his recent endeavors into power-pop, Billy Joel piano balladry, and Neil Young covers would’ve predicted. Pretty much every song on NO DREAM ends up veering towards the raw materials of Rosenstock’s less critically revered days. “Scram!” takes a midsong trip to the House of Blues for a metalcore breakdown, while the actual skramz pop up on the title track, which spends its first two minutes lost in the dual drones of college rock jangle and an endless scroll of atrocity. In the past, this kind of genre flipping could be used as a flex; on NO DREAM, it’s the sound of the walls closing in. The second half of NO DREAM narrows its scope to Rosenstock’s life as a musician and the self-doubt, heightened expectations, and precarity that results from spending decades dedicating one’s life to something that, at most, might provide enough success to justify carrying on. Yet, it also features some of the most expansive, rich writing of his career. “Be an aging tourist/Hustle like a tortoise,” he half-jokes during “f a m e,” a jerky dance-punk throwback to a time when it was a lot easier for acts at the upper echelons of indie rock to make ends meet. From that point forward, Rosenstock can only remember the good old days in the most unromantic terms: “Pictures of toilets across the planet,” increasingly short phone calls back home, a pyramid of beer cans in a flophouse that he’s embarrassed to have made and too proud to knock down. These would be worthwhile even just as bitterly funny snapshots of a band successful enough to play to arms-crossed crowds in Germany. But as he did with WORRY.’s “Festival Song,” Rosenstock can zoom out just enough to see the bigger picture, specifically, his complicity in the compromises everyone needs to make in order to make late capitalism work. The verses of “***BNB” would be hilarious Airbnb host reviews if they weren’t so heartbreaking—the first is dedicated to a stranger named Sam, stuck in a dead-end job and a terrible marriage, her house secretly being rented out by her mother so guys like Rosenstock can save a few bucks on tour. Delivered in a sing-song cadence, “I used the shower sponge when you went to Spain alone” should live on as the most devastating encapsulation of the pathetic intimacy generated by platform business. Rosenstock’s previous two albums ended on notes of bleak solidarity: Perfection doesn’t exist, so let’s enjoy each other’s humanity; they’re probably going to win but we won’t just let them. NO DREAM closer “Ohio Tpke” is dedicated to “the only person I ever wanted to like me,” and it starts out like so many other love letters from the road—counting the dashes in the median on the ride home, songs shared on a summer night, a simple connection on FaceTime easing loneliness better than a room full of fans. “Ohio Tpke” morphs to embody any number of quintessentially American rock bands—Bruce Springsteen, Against Me!, Wilco, Built to Spill—and the mood shifts just as quickly, as Rosenstock recognizes how everything required to make a life on the road work at his age gets less resilient. The phone calls get shorter, the reunions get more awkward, agitated, more desperate, more definitive: “I hate coming home/I hate leaving home.” If it was written by someone who showed even the slightest bit less commitment to their craft and cause than Jeff Rosenstock, I’d take “Ohio Tpke” as a retirement announcement. NO DREAM is about what really goes on when you take enough time to think about whether you’ve turned into the person that you really wanted to be. Maybe there will be freedom from having to repeat the same cycle of releasing an album and trying to find just enough income away from home to do the same thing over again, two years older than you were before. Maybe Rosenstock writes a batch of songs about slowing down just enough to find glimmers of inner peace, or the collective disbelief when someone else is president, or the disorientating euphoria of being able to leave our houses again. But if history’s any indication, even if all of that happens, Jeff Rosenstock will write about how nothing really changed on the most prophetic album of 2022.","New York’s most anxious punk delivers hook after hook on an album that deals with evergreen sociopolitical concerns yet sounds like it could’ve been written 30 minutes ago.

Strange to Explain,Woods,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec6b2bf1a4e85635f12e54f/1:1/w_160/Strange%20to%20Explain_Woods.jpg,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/woods-strange-to-explain/,Woodsist,"Dread has been an important ingredient in Jeremy Earl’s best music. Earl, the bandleader of Woods, has a dreamy falsetto that’s offset beautifully by unsettling songs, the type that appeared all over 2009’s Songs of Shame and 2010’s At Echo Lake. Those two albums were Woods’ best, with Earl’s darker reveries nurtured by the band’s remarkably coherent music: warm, comforting psychedelic folk tinged with sadness, confusion, and mystery. Woods’ newest album, Strange to Explain, arrives almost exactly a decade after At Echo Lake and, happily, sounds very much like it, evoking a familiar Woods feeling: that of a blazing campfire surrounded by darkness. The record represents a roaring comeback for the band at a moment to which their sound is particularly well-suited. Earl was set back on his heels after the 2016 presidential election and the band’s rushed response, 2017’s Love Is Love, was insipid and gooey. At times, its saccharine lyrics could feel like parody, something written by conservatives imagining the taste of liberal tears: “How can we love if this won’t go away? How can we love with this kind of hate?” Strange to Explain doesn’t gesture helplessly in the direction of bad feeling, but leans right into it. And in acknowledging the ubiquity of pain, the album offers to help banish it. Even the lesser tracks here are not what they seem. The two-minute instrumental “The Void” opens like a standard guitar jam (with some vibraphone mixed in) and arrives at a melodic hook within 30 seconds. But the song remains in motion, running from one neighborhood to the next, with new melodies coming into view every 30 seconds or so until its climax is revealed: not that initial hook but a brass refrain that undergirds the entire thing. It’s fully realized and then it’s gone, a feeling as wistful and complex as arriving at the edge of a waterfront. If there’s a criticism to be made, it’s that many of the strongest songs here sound as if they could have come out years ago. But album highlight “Can’t Get Out,” an anthemic song that combines garage-rock rumble with Dire Straits Americana (courtesy of the Mellotron that’s all over the album), sounds wholly new and remarkably cathartic. It’s a full-throated jam that describes the feeling of suffocation even as it rejects it. The sound is muddier than Woods’ usual, and Earl is belting: “Can’t get back/Can’t get out/Can’t take a breath/Leave me be.” Woods’ lyrics have always been impressionistic, but even as the quality of the songs here ranges, certain motifs recur: night, void, dreams, immersive experiences that make sense only in the light of day, if they ever do. The spooky title track has the most interesting lyrics, with Earl asserting that “you can reinvent yourself so you don’t slip away,” suggesting, basically, that the way to avoid death is to continually kill off versions of yourself. Yet the ghosts of past selves pile up, resulting in a déjà vu that gives the song, and the record, its name. Naturally, because the subject matter is so unsettling, it’s one of the prettiest tracks on the record. It’s tempting to hear this album as an elegy for David Berman, for whom Woods served as a backing band in the months leading up to his suicide. But Strange to Explain was written and recorded before that collaboration came to full fruition. Berman’s demons may have informed Earl’s, as a recent New York Times profile about their collaboration suggested, but Woods are perfectly capable of turning their own nightmares into compelling music. Late in the album, on “Light of Day,” Earl turns his attention outward. As with “The Void,” the song takes its time revealing itself, with a bridge that feels like a hook preceding the actual chorus. The lyrics are angry, as Earl sings, “You can fill your void with an empty cup/It might tear you apart, almost every night.” His voice couldn’t sound any sweeter.","The New York psych-folk band makes a welcome return to form with a dreamy, unsettling, Mellotron-filled album that feels especially appropriate right now.

Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes,Nídia,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec6ddc1ee33b6018584d9e1/1:1/w_160/Na%CC%83o%20Fales%20Nela%20Que%20A%20Mentes_Ni%CC%81dia.jpg,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nidia-nao-fales-nela-que-a-mentes/,Príncipe Discos,"On her debut LP, 2017’s Nídia é Má, Nídia é Fudida, Nídia sounded tough and triumphant, firing out knotty batida rhythms and piercing melodies with the pluck of a newcomer. Batida, a salmagundi of styles circulating through the Afro-Lusophone diaspora, and a sound closely associated with Lisbon’s Príncipe label, was still finding its footing on an international stage. Two years earlier, Nídia had joined the label when she was just 18 years old, building on the style as it had been established by pioneers like DJ Marfox and DJ Nigga Fox. After a long stint living in Bordeaux, Nídia has returned to Lisbon; Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes is one of three new records produced in her bedroom studio there. But unlike her hard-charging debut LP, this one is a breezy collection of mid-tempo tracks, clocking in at just 29 minutes. With their spacious arrangements and shuddering, 808-style bass blasts, the 10 tracks owe more to rap and grime instrumentals, or the street sounds of the global South, than they do to the heat and frenzy of the club. (The title, taken from a poem by Jorge de Sena, roughly translates as, “Don’t talk about her or you’ll end up lying about her.”) Nídia’s approach to sound is efficient and elemental, taking recognizable material—hand claps, crash cymbals, plasticky brass—and creating complexity through arrangement rather than signal manipulation. She paints in bold, black lines before filling in the gaps with heavy pigments. On “capacidades,” a distorted voice pops up like a cartoon speech bubble, chanting “Go! Go! Go!” as the beat topples forward. On “rap-tentativa,” the rhythm is spelled out like a schoolyard clapping game while a pair of two-note melodies circle each other like a team chant. The track titles read like hastily chosen placeholders—“popo,” “intro,” “RAP-complet”—as if they’ve come from a sample pack of “Nídia-Type-Beats” for prospective MCs. That doesn’t necessarily reflect on their contents; the interplay of breathy flute and twanged strings on “popo,” for instance, provides enough narrative without the need for human input. But other tracks do seem to be making space for a guest who never shows up, whether it’s a vocalist or simply a further development of melody or dynamics. Nídia exits the stage with a reverse fanfare on “emotions.” Sad stubs of synth brass blare out over hand claps and hi-hats, like a negative sheet for some mid-’00s Southern rap hit. The ghosts of good times seem to hover in the wings. In fact, Nídia often finds her way to a minor key or a dissonant triad, upsetting her upbeat rhythms with a shred of nervous energy. On a two-track 7"" released in tandem with this album, there’s more of this happy-sad, stop-go mood, as growling basslines square up to pretty pianos. Such complications are fundamental to the Príncipe universe, where tensions are left unresolved.","The Lisbon batida producer’s second LP is more spacious than her hard-charging debut, but infused with ambivalent emotion; the ghosts of good times seem to hover anxiously in the wings.

Survival,Wares,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec5502dfdf28c81baeab856/1:1/w_160/Survival_Wares.jpg,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wares-survival/,Mint,"Survival means something very specific to Cassia Hardy. Her 2017 self-titled debut album as Wares chronicled her life as an artist and outsider in Alberta (aka Canada’s Texas, with all the oil money and conservative politicking that goes with it) and her conflicted relationship with her home city of Edmonton, ultimately concluding that its supportive music community makes it “a nice place, but I don’t want to die here.” Wares’ second album, however, homes in on a very specific part of that experience: her transition into a woman, and all the locker-room bullying, judgemental doctors’ visits, and self-doubt she endured along the way. The cover painting on Survival depicts a gender-ambiguous figure in a red dress lurching towards a radiant sun poking over the horizon, but still surrounded by a forest that seems to be pulling them back into the darkness. It’s the perfect visual distillation of an album that perpetually teeters between euphoric, new-day-rising affirmations and the inescapable specter of past traumas. Hardy’s process of self-realization has run parallel to Wares’ transformation from an acoustic-guitar-slinging solo operation into a fiery indie-rock quartet with the fighting spirit of a young Titus Andronicus. On Survival, Hardy’s need for intimate connection is matched only by Wares’ desire to go over the top and burn it all down, rendering joy and rage as the same exorcising expression. Like a slingshot being pulled to its breaking point, the opening “Hands, Skin” ratchets up its tense atmosphere before blasting off into a double-timed punk sprint, its ecstatic, liberated energy undercut by Hardy’s grim account of a violent attack inflicted upon her. The album’s seismic centerpiece, “Surrender Into Waiting Arms,” presents the optimistic flipside to that narrative, of finding acceptance and possibly even love (“Jump for a chance at a better life/Give myself to one I desire!”). But the energy is equally unsettled, particularly when the song suddenly detours into a dramatic, doomy second act where Hardy’s amorous exclamations (“Kiss my lover in the sun/Feel their heart pressed between finger and thumb”) sound like they’re being shouted from the bottom of a well, suggesting that happiness is all just an unattainable fantasy. Survival is Wares’ first release for venerable Vancouver imprint Mint Records, the label that introduced the world to the New Pornographers 20 years ago. There are echoes of that group’s maximalist power-pop in the steady motorik cruise of “Tether” and jubilant jangle of “Surface World,” but Wares are ultimately less concerned with craft than catharsis, no matter how messy it gets. Hardy’s irrepressible personality abounds even in the album’s more delicate moments, like the anti-capitalist dream-folk lullaby (and readymade COVID rent-strike anthem) “Jenny Says” and the devastating “Tall Girl,” which could pass for an early non-electro MGMT track, but with their hazy cosmic jive replaced by a regretful account of being too nervous and wary of strangers to chat up a potential soulmate. By album’s end, Hardy has found enough strength and confidence in her identity to shift the lens away from her past and back onto the current state of her home province, where oil barons dominate with a blatant disregard for the environment and Indigenous land rights. “Fight like a dying species rejecting parasitic scum/Before everyone you love gets used up,” she screams with throat-ravaging desperation. By coming clean with her own struggles over the course of the record, Hardy shows that even the most formidable obstacles are surmountable. She’s alive; now it’s your turn.","On her second album as Wares, Cassia Hardy sings of rage, joy, and transformation on a dynamic and euphoric rock record.

For You,India Jordan,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec544761ed2d15ae8657e5e/1:1/w_160/For%20You_India%20Jordan.jpg,2020-05-26 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/india-jordan-for-you/,2 B Real ,"All the best club music rests on the thrill of combustion. Fusing opposing elements and watching sparks fly is what keeps dance culture alive and kicking today, even when there appears to be limited fresh ground to break. London-based, Doncaster-born India Jordan is, alongside compatriots Finn and Anz, part of a new alliance of DJ-producers who can zip between any number of rave-ish genres without blinking. Having grown up in South Yorkshire on the most x-treme fare clubland had to offer, that sense of kinesis never left Jordan, even as the 29-year-old producer siphons and smooths it into different avenues. For You, their second EP, is a testament to this instinct, fusing drum’n’bass, filter disco, breakbeat, and reflecting-pool synth shimmer into some of the giddiest, most assured electronic music of 2020. India Jordan initially established themself on the British club circuit as a promoter of ambient nights and one-time president of Hull University’s DJ Society. 2019’s DNT STP MY LV was their first full record, though it was rinsed so hard by tastemaker jocks that it felt happily lived in by the time the year wound to a close. Jordan’s song titles typically speak to an act of movement, forever shuffling, warping, leaving, and traveling through. For You shifts along the axis, now concerned with arriving and becoming. It is an overtly queer record, even if it doesn’t explode with pride on the surface. The “you” in the title refers to Jordan; rooted and at peace in inclusive East London, they came out as nonbinary just before Christmas last year—revealed on Instagram with a chipper, quintessentially Yorkshire sense of humor—and present themself as a work in progress. Jordan makes this lack of fixed definition work to their advantage. The opulent flourish of French touch and the chemical twang of drum’n’bass usually stand in high contrast to one another, but within the EP, Jordan makes them feel like two sides of the same rhapsodic coin. For You’s middle tracks are the hardest to throw a genre lasso around, yet might make the handiest transition tools in a DJ’s hands. Both glide forward as if carried by a jetstream, linear in structure though anything but trad in construction. “Rave City” is a soup of subdued breaks and smeared effects that suggest a dancefloor could be nearby while feeling wholly apart from it. The arpeggiated ripples on “Emotional Melodical” hit like a wonderful rainbow refracting off a chandelier, or taking a trip to the aquarium on acid. Jordan allows moments of earned catharsis at the close. The headstrong “Dear Nan King” is a thank you to Tipping the Velvet, a tale of female lovers that drew complaints from puritanical Middle England when broadcast by the BBC in the 2000s. Twenty years removed, Jordan threads samples from the TV drama that sparked their sexual awakening through raging Reese basslines and thunderclap percussion, life and death snare-rushing before their eyes. And on the soaring “Westbourne Avenue,” Jordan casts back to student days in Hull, a place where friendships were formed but gates were guarded by recalcitrant men in the D&B scene. The song is a composite of the EP’s various moods, pummelling and beautiful, reaching for the ecstatic while being cleansed by a flamethrower. The passion in Jordan’s music pays off most spectacularly on the opening one-two punch, a pair that would demand inclusion on any rundown of filter house’s greatest hits. They recall the glory era when Alan Braxe & Fred Falke, Joey Negro, and Bob Sinclar ruled the MTV Dance playlists and charts alike. “I’m Waiting (Just 4 U)” comes first, a ritzy whirl of mirror balls and chromatic LEDs. It elegantly tees up “For You,” an accelerated second stage which utilizes the same vocal sample as its predecessor—this time clipped, mechanical and insistent. We’re cruising now: The tension ratchets as “for” and “you” bounce back and forth, energy increasingly chaotic, sweet harmony in the thrum of human bodies. A filter sweep draws back the velvet curtain and reveals that the soft disco essence of “I’m Waiting” sample was resting there inside this tougher, more technoid track all along, before a kick thumps in and pandemonium breaks loose. Taken together, the songs are proof that you don’t need a star budget to make Stardust-sized bangers. For You arrives with live events in suspended animation, a quirk of fate that might stymie its evident crossover potential. These six tunes should be perfect fodder for long summer nights that stretch ’til dawn, but will instead be judged soberly and with appropriate care, rather than becoming fond memories of an ecstasy honeymoon. For a roadmap of self-actualization, perhaps this is no bad thing—and when we’re released back into the wild, these songs will feel all the more celebratory. The animating idea behind For You is that the music is India Jordan’s gift to themself. The fun part is, it lifts the rest of us too.","The UK producer arranges classic dance tropes into a roadmap of euphoric self-actualization, creating some of the year’s giddiest, most assured electronic music.

Both,Bill Nace,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec5633afdf28c81baeab85b/1:1/w_160/Both_Bill%20Nace.jpg,2020-05-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-nace-both/,Drag City,"More than any of his peers in his experimental-music scene, the guitarist Bill Nace has built his career on collaboration. Of his 45 entries on Discogs, only seven are solo, and they’re mostly limited-run, self-released affairs. He’s been much more interested in playing with people across the avant-garde spectrum, from free jazz veterans Joe McPhee and Mats Gustaffson to rock musicians Steve Gunn and Thurston Moore to polymaths Okkyung Lee and Kim Gordon (partner in his most well-known venture, Body/Head). All this collaboration has defined Nace, but it’s also made him something of a cipher. Because the records he plays on are usually instrumental and abstract, it can be hard to locate exactly which sounds and ideas are his. That keeps his work varied and fresh, and means he sees his comrades as equals rather than supporters. But Nace’s musical personality is oddly undefined for someone who’s been on over 40 releases. Though it’s long overdue, a full-fledged, higher-profile solo album raises the question: Can Nace maintain his shadowy persona all by himself? As the title hints, the answer provided by Both is yes and no. On eight instrumental, guitar-only tracks—all with plain, numbered names—Nace makes bold, loud noises and active, committed moves. Despite being wordless and non-melodic, each track has a discernible structure. They begin with sounds that at first seem random but, by warping into waves or clipping into rhythms, eventually become motifs. In “Part 2,” what sounds like a guitar cord being pulled out and plugged back in becomes a kind of subconscious beat, while “Part 7” offers two oscillations whose variations in volume build them into mantras. Even on the longest track, the nearly 11-minute “Part 6,” a wide range of sounds gain momentum—and verge on chaos—through basic rhythmic panning. Each piece is like a pitch-black room, easy to enter but tricky to navigate. Nace’s guitar tone is rough and gritty, continually generating tactile waves that you can grab onto and ride, and the result is both meditative and ominous. Both shares an eerie, hypnotic quality with the unhinged loops of Aaron Dilloway and the darkened seances of Marcia Bassett, aka Zaïmph. But Nace’s repetitions rarely hammer you with a single unwavering sound. Instead he dodges and darts, creating space for you to fill in blanks. In that sense, Both might be more about its listener than its creator. If by the end we still don’t know exactly who Bill Nace is, we certainly have a better idea of how much he can do.","The experimental guitarist who made his name on collaboration steps into the spotlight with a meditative, ominous solo LP.

The World I’m Going to Hell For,Nathan Micay,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec564b81a4e85635f12e365/1:1/w_160/The%20World%20I%E2%80%99m%20Going%20to%20Hell%20For_Nathan%20Micay.jpg,2020-05-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nathan-micay-the-world-im-going-to-hell-for/,LuckyMe,"Twitter is full of odd confessions, but the rising dance producer Nathan Micay recently let slip that when he was 19 years old, the first track he ever finished was a bootleg jungle remix of indie-folk hero Sufjan Stevens. The combination of Sufjan Stevens and rollicking Amen breaks sounds ridiculous, but in Micay’s case, perhaps it’s not so surprising. Although he’s best known these days for sidewinding, richly melodic tracks that recall the glory days of trance and progressive house, including last year’s manga-inspired Blue Spring, the Berlin-based Canadian grew up playing banjo, violin, viola, and cello, and was part of a Toronto youth orchestra for many years. More recently, his Schvitz Edits imprint—one of three different record labels he heads up—kicked off its run with club-ready reworks of famed singer-songwriters Dr. John and Gordon Lightfoot. On The World I’m Going to Hell For, his work has come full circle. Originally issued on a limited-edition cassette late last year, the LP was slated for a proper release this autumn, but once the COVID-19 crisis turned the world upside down, Micay decided to go ahead and put the album online as part of the most recent Bandcamp Friday. Unlike his recent output, The World I’m Going to Hell For almost completely abandons the dancefloor, opting instead for a more cinematic approach that folds in elements of ambient, IDM, and the more emotive corners of bass music. Two years in the making, most of the album was created using only cello, viola, violin, and a distortion pedal, and that stripped-back approach lends the music both a classical sensibility and widescreen dimensions; only a handful of its 13 tracks feature substantial percussion. It’s still electronic music, but strings are the dominant element, and songs like “Natey, Get on Your Horse,” “For the Hawk of the Millennium Empire,” and “Never Rhythm Game” are the sort of melancholy vignettes that might soundtrack a particularly gut-wrenching scene of a film. More uplifting is “Billing Service,” which includes an unexpected vocal turn from Micay himself; it’s the closest he’s come to having an Arthur Russell moment, although his baritone also brings to mind 69 Love Songs-era Stephin Merritt. The World I’m Going to Hell For, which Micay describes as his most overtly political effort to date—he calls it a response to the “outdated rhetoric spoken by outdated humans in power”—is meant to build upon the dystopian narrative he laid out with Blue Spring and its accompanying comic. But the closest spiritual analog in Micay’s back catalog is probably Capsule’s Pride, the Akira-themed album he released back in 2016 under the name Bwana. (Arguably the most famous anime of all time, Akira is also a story of rising up against government oppression.) Although Capsule’s Pride is more heavily steeped in club tropes and glossy synths than The World I’m Going to Hell For, the two releases share a filmic sensibility and showcase Micay’s talent for thinking bigger than the dancefloor. Like all good soundtracks, The World I’m Going to Hell For is best consumed as a whole, but there are some clear highlights. With its gleaming synths and luxurious strings, “Who Shaves the Barber” has a playful pomp that wouldn’t be out of place at a regal garden party, while “If the World’s Still Here on Monday” offsets its brooding swagger with sparkling tendrils of melody. Lush album closer “V” is more subdued, but there’s a sense of majesty in its billowing atmosphere. There’s also something for the DJs: “Panz,” a breezy, twinkling house cut that wouldn’t be out of place on labels like Studio Barnhus or Mule Musiq. Though the album predates the current pandemic, its reissue now, rushed out months ahead of schedule, gives Micay’s abrupt creative left turn new resonance. In the face of an uncertain future, many artists reflexively retreat to safety or indulge in clichéd tales of impending doom, but Micay has taken a different path. The World I’m Going to Hell For is a serious record, and there are moments of mourning and thoughtful introspection, but the music never falls into despair. It’s a hopeful exercise, and during a time when the whole world feels like it’s falling apart, there’s something uniquely powerful about Micay’s choice to let optimism light the way forward.","The Berlin-based producer swaps his habitually trance-fueled club anthems for an unusual fusion of filmic chamber strings and emotive bass music.

Acquiesce,TALsounds,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec5664aee33b6018584d821/1:1/w_160/Acquiesce_TALsounds.jpg,2020-05-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talsounds-acquiesce/,NNA Tapes,"Meditation and improvisation are very different practices, but the sprawling synth music of Chicago experimentalist Natalie Chami makes that difference nearly imperceptible. The key to doing either successfully is often mindfulness; a focus on the self, an awareness of breath, and the ability to completely give yourself to the moment. Chami proved this in Good Willsmith, her trio with Max Allison and Doug Kaplan, where the commitment to improvisation extended to entire albums of heroically psychedelic single-takes. Allison and Kaplan’s colorful avant-garde label Hausu Mountain provided a launch point for Chami’s solo project TALSounds, where her classically-trained voice flowed calmly through synths, tape-delays, and loop pedals. While early releases were uncut recordings, Chami employed subtle editing on 2018’s Love Sick before going further on her new album Acquiesce, making songs out of longer improvisations and applying vocal overdubs. But don’t mistake the title or enhanced production for any sort of compromise: Acquiesce is the most fully-realized TALsounds album to date. Acquiesce is TALsounds at their most turbulent, where the additional production emphasizes the rawest and most tender moments. The first track on Acquiesce is an instrumental appropriately titled “Opening,” not for describing a starting point, but implying an action that runs naturally throughout the album. On previous albums, Chami’s voice and synths would often form a dense unified sound, but on “Soar” they take their own trajectories. The soft arpeggios rushing under melismatic vocals compliment each other, but it’s just as engaging when they’re at odds. “Dynasty” begins with silvery synth lines and Chami’s voice in an upper opera register, until an elastic, glitchy synth interrupts and the song unspools into a delirious collage of looping vocals. But rather than disrupting the project’s zen atmosphere, this dynamic enhances it, as if we’re hearing her work through the tension and release in real time. “Dynasty” is reoriented by the fuzzy, heartrending organ instrumental “Conveyor,” the album’s shortest and most breathlessly beautiful track. Acquiesce always goes deeper rather than bigger. TALsounds has always been an inwardly focused project by nature, but these songs feel uniquely designed to pull you into them. The album grows darker in its second half, but there’s a warmth and safety there just like the dimly lit shot of the bedside table on its cover. The faintly atonal synths streaking through “Else” and “Instance” create a dead-of-night intimacy but Chami, like Grouper’s Liz Harris, has an innate ability to light these moments with her voice like a will-o’-the-wisp. It resolves on the penultimate “Muted Decision,” where she tunes a lone-synth to uncannily mimic a muted-trumpet. It’s a moment akin to stumbling through your home in the dark, only to have your eyes adjust and recognize the people and things you love most. Chami has described making this album during a period of new love, a time of happiness, but also of questioning that happiness when she found herself recording less. For a project defined by its constant and improvisational process, not to mention one that doubles as meditative practice, it’s an understandable anxiety. But the true brilliance of the album is how she channels those life tensions through that same creative process. As its final track “No Restoring” glimmers into view, Acquiesce reveals itself in hindsight as the now-engaged musician’s most romantic album. It’s easy to confuse acquiescence for a sort of defeat, but TALsounds frames it more as an acceptance of life’s endless change. We are all constantly improvising with what life throws at us, but the meditative majesty of Acquiesce suggests that with a different perspective, we can let it flow straight through us.","The synth compositions of Chicago experimentalist Natalie Chami are deep and romantic, uniquely designed to pull you into them.

Elliott Smith,Elliott Smith,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec53e3dee33b6018584d7e4/1:1/w_160/Elliott%20Smith_Elliott%20Smith.jpg,2020-05-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elliott-smith-elliott-smith/,Kill Rock Stars,"In a 2000 interview with Melody Maker, Elliott Smith told a story from his childhood. He is three years old—Steven Paul Smith, born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1969—and he is messing around with his mother’s television set. Immediately, he is transfixed by the power of the remote control: This button makes the sound burst from the speaker and this one silences it. This button makes the screen change, each time reopening to a new world, while this one shuts it off entirely. It’s a lot of power for a child. He is delighted by the collage of faces and voices and sound and possibility until the inevitable happens: the TV breaks. He soon learned to seek the same thrill in music. Smith’s first love was the Beatles, a band whose career lasted less than 10 years, so their every move carried immense weight and meaning for those discovering it in retrospect. His favorite song was the multi-part “A Day in the Life,” which he might have heard like a television constantly changing channels, each one landing on the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. When he started writing his own music, he followed this blueprint, accidentally stumbling upon the avant-garde. He described his earliest compositions as more like transitions than actual songs; as he reflected to Under the Radar in one of his last interviews, he didn’t understand why every part couldn’t be the best part. From Omaha, Smith and his mother moved to Dallas. He left as a teenager, a decision he attributed to a town full of bullies and an abusive step-father. His next stops were Portland, Oregon, where he lived with his father—a preacher turned Air Force pilot turned psychiatrist—and Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. At college, Smith studied political science and philosophy and was so affected by feminist texts that he momentarily wanted to become a fireman to offset some of the damage he did to the world simply by being a straight white man. He also met like-minded artists, including classmate Neil Gust, who helped him feel useful in a different way—trading punk 7""s and collaborating on music. After graduation, Gust and Smith returned to Portland, where they formed the grungy alt-rock band Heatmiser. The rise of Smith’s spare, self-recorded solo material and Heatmiser’s blistering rock songs are often held in contrast. But the truth is his solo work bloomed alongside their music, which had softened and matured by 1996’s extraordinary swansong Mic City Sons. So while Smith hated straining his voice to be heard over the noise (“I’ve had enough of people yelling,” he told Rolling Stone) and the way their audience reminded him of the dudes who gave him hell back in Texas, it did bring him closer to the sound he heard in his head. Rock music was always Smith’s guiding light. When interviewers compared him to folk singers like Paul Simon or Nick Drake, you could feel his eyes roll into his head. And when it came time to flesh out his solo sets with cover songs, he turned to rock radio staples: the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Kinks. He felt a particular kindred spirit with Big Star, the cult band whose 1972 ballad “Thirteen” would become a standard in his hands. The initial connection wasn’t because of their hard-luck story or the unspeakable loneliness of records like Third. Instead, Smith admired how Alex Chilton and the band rallied for a style of music that was unfashionable in their scene, following their intuition as opposed to trends. So just as Big Star performed their charging take on British Invasion power-pop to half-empty rooms through Memphis, Smith abandoned his Portland alt-rock band—their growing acclaim, their major label deal, their “next Nirvana” buzz—to strike out on his own. Released while Heatmiser was still gaining momentum, his 1994 solo debut Roman Candle was less a complete statement than a collection of demos, compiled in the hopes that a label would pick the best songs for a 7"" single. The following year’s Elliott Smith, then, can be seen as his first official solo album, issued on the buzzy indie label Kill Rock Stars. Like Roman Candle, it was recorded in the homes of friends—Heatmiser drummer Tony Lash and Leslie Uppinghouse, who toured with the band and mixed their live sound. Uppinghouse remembers setting Smith up in her basement, off in the corner with an eight-track Tascam tape recorder. Her dog, Anna, would sometimes press her nose against the door to listen in. Uppinghouse claims she can hear her in a few songs. Smith described a preference for writing distractedly—at crowded bars, at home watching Xena: Warrior Princess, anywhere he could take his mind off the idea of being a serious songwriter doing serious work. But he was devoted to his process. He wrote and recorded constantly, in a stream of interconnected ideas. The 12 songs he selected for Elliott Smith reflect that spirit. Phrases and images reoccur. The theme of addiction is constant, and his euphemisms are abundant and clear: white lady, white brother, death in your arms, getting good marks. His tone is often resigned, the perspective of someone who sees what’s going on but knows better than to fight. In the bridge of “Alphabet Town,” he sings, “I know what you are/I just don’t mind.” The chorus of “Good to Go” distills it even further: “You can do it if you want to.” Thematically, it’s the darkest album he’d complete in his lifetime, but it’s also one of his most beautiful. Think of how much happens in these songs before he even starts singing. The lonesome harmonica-accompanied intro of “Alphabet Town” sets the scene like blinds opening in a dim apartment, letting in the gray light from the street. The queasy blues riff that precedes “Clementine” is the sound of stumbling to your feet, realizing how late it is and how many drinks you’ve had. And of course there’s the opening “Needle in the Hay,” led by an ominous riff whose abrupt chord changes can induce a sense of paranoia: Smith’s meticulous, lo-fi rendering of two warring impulses. It makes sense his earliest supporters were fellow artists like Lou Barlow and Mary Lou Lord: If you listened closely, you could hear entire worlds in his arrangements. So while Elliott Smith serves as a stark blueprint for his 1997 masterpiece Either/Or, it also creates a bridge from the heavier music he played with Heatmiser. In songs like “Christian Brothers,” his voice is tougher and lower than it would ever sound again, as he growls that “no bad dream fucker’s gonna boss me around.” When he eventually performed these songs live with a full band, his accompanists re-enacted them as pointed, vicious things; he’d raise his delivery a full octave to seethe through “Needle in the Hay.” As presented here, the music is spare but deceptively layered. Note the muted drum part in “Coming Up Roses” that seems to drag his words along with it; how the droning strings in “The White Lady Loves You More” turn it into a doomed romance; how the frenzied strumming of “Southern Belle” seems poised to attack at any moment as Smith envisions a way out of the childhood memories that still raged in his mind. This kind of songwriting—tied with the dark path his own life would go down, through addiction and hospitalizations and suicide attempts—can lead fans to look for clues in his songs, as if he laid them out like a cry for help. But he described his music more like dreaming: less in the interpretive, Freudian sense than the mysterious way you wake up feeling fragile and uneasy and inexplicably pissed at someone you haven’t spoken to in years. And for all of the addiction talk in the lyrics, Smith explained to journalists that it simply felt like a potent metaphor, a conduit toward bigger questions: Why do we turn self-destructive? How does it affect the people who love us? Where does it lead? This insistence on not being taken literally is why Smith dismissed the idea of being a folk singer, someone who showed up on stage with a story to tell and a moral at the end. As soon as he was given the budget, he turned his records into expensive, symphonic opuses that seemed hell-bent on erasing the image of a quiet kid in his friend’s basement with an old acoustic guitar and tape recorder. Revisiting “The Biggest Lie,” the closing track on the record and one of his most heartbreaking songs, it’s almost jarring to hear him refer to “a crushed credit card/Registered to Smith.” It’s a classic trope of folk music: turning himself into a character, one whose future seemed as hopeless as the guy we imagine to be singing it. The following years confirmed these premonitions. For his final record, From a Basement on the Hill, Smith experimented with switching his songs from mono to stereo halfway through, which might be the logical endpoint of staying up for days smoking crack in the studio but also of wanting to find new ways to burst through the speakers and make a connection: to make every part the best part. The music industry does not take kindly to these excitable, sensitive minds. He fractured more with every step, leaving Portland to seek refuge in New York and eventually Los Angeles. Pressure built; expectations grew. Late in life, he became so frustrated with projections about his future that he carved the word “NOW” into his arm and wrote a song as he bled onto the piano. This pain eventually consumed him. But there was always some levity. During most of his live performances—a constant stressor that he once compared to a bullfight—Smith would turn to the crowd and ask for requests: “Do you want to hear a happy song or a sad song?” In his bruised, shaky voice, it always sounded kind of like a joke. After all, the magic of the girl in Either/Or’s “Say Yes” who was still in love the morning after was that, through her eyes, Smith could pretend that any sense of joy in this world might last. He claimed to have written this song in just five minutes and I wonder if we’d have gotten to hear it if he let it sit any longer. Instead of “Say Yes,” I’d point to this album’s “St. Ides Heaven” as his most purely optimistic moment—the one I’d come closest to calling “happy.” Granted, the guy singing it is high on speed, drunk on malt liquor, and wandering around a parking lot, resenting every person who ever tried to help him. “Everyone is a fucking pro,” he laughs, because he knows, sooner or later, they’ll end up in the same place he’s at right now. Smith seems at peace knowing this. On the front cover of Elliott Smith are two bodies free-falling from apartment windows; on the back cover, tucked in the corner like a postage stamp, is Elliott Smith with dyed-blond hair, stopping to smell a flower. Another bright moment: hearing the harmony vocals in “St. Ides Heaven” from the Spinanes’ Rebecca Gates. It’s a subtle performance that makes me consider how accustomed I am to hearing Elliott Smith singing by himself: in tight double-tracked vocals, in uncanny ribbons of harmony, as his own ghostly choir. With Gates next to him, he sounds different, maybe lighter. She wrote a little about the sessions in the liner notes for New Moon, a posthumous collection released in 2007. She remembers feeling shy but having fun, doing a few takes then going home. She also writes about a night, some time later, wandering around Portland with Smith. At one point they’re commiserating about the music industry; she remembers him being moody, wearing a raggedy old raincoat. Then somewhere along the way, they burst into laughter. It’s the kind of vague, half-remembered scene that always comes to mind when I hear these songs. You can see the rain on the street, the moon in the sky. It’s getting dark. They have the whole night ahead of them.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

High Off Life,Future,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec538fbfcb5f329163e058a/1:1/w_160/High%20Off%20Life_Future.jpg,2020-05-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/future-high-off-life/,Epic,"Future’s legacy is secure: as one of the most influential artists of the past decade, he’s managed to conquer the streets and the charts, crafting a sound that reshaped not just rap but pop music. All the while, he’s maintained a pace that few of his peers could match—depending on how you count, he’s released somewhere between two and three dozen full-lengths in the decade since he first started calling himself Future. In the years since his creative hot streak peaked with DS2, he’s continued releasing music at a steady clip. But where Future spent the first half of the 2010s relentlessly innovating, he’s been content to spend the latter half tinkering with his signature sound. High Off Life doesn’t buck this trend in any significant way. It’s another hour of music that renders tortured hedonism with painterly detail, meticulous production, and melancholy melody. There are exotic cars painted in candy-colored hues, designer sandals worn casually, women treated as if they were disposable, drugs sold and consumed. There are songs that glitter like a suitcase full of diamonds, songs that could soundtrack a crime procedural, and songs that will sound great when reduced to basslines blaring out of passing cars. Except for the previously released singles that pad the end of the record in keeping with industry norms, High Off Life is better-paced and sequenced than most of Future’s recent releases—the whole thing seems to glide by frictionlessly. In interviews, Future spoke about his previous album, The Wizrd, as a capstone for his career up to that point, setting the stage for a coming pivot. Sadly, High Off Life does not represent this major shift, though we do get a few new ideas. The errant guitar strums and saloon piano on “Too Comfortable” draw out Future’s inner bluesman, while on the Bezos-baiting “Trillionaire,” he goes bar-for-bar with YoungBoy Never Broke Again, discovering the sort of chemistry with his offspring that normally eludes him. On “All Bad,” Future visits the cartoony world of Lil Uzi Vert’s Eternal Atake, and it’s genuinely refreshing hearing the normally morose rapper have this much fun. That said, Future is still at his best when mining the depths of inner turmoil. On the Travis Scott-featuring “Solitaires,” Future adopts an unhinged flow and jokes about needing a psychiatrist. On “Ridin Strikers,” he owns up to his reputation as a dirtbag, admitting he “won’t enjoy life if it ain’t toxic.” But at the album’s end, we finally hear what sounds like a breakthrough. “Accepting My Flaws” comes spilling out of Future in one long verse, like a confession. Over a spectral choir sample, he acknowledges struggles with addiction, tries to shake off a worldview shaped by the streets, and stands in awe of a partner willing to accept him, flaws and all. ""I’ve been suffering withdrawals, missing out on real love,” he admits. It sounds like he’s done running from himself. During a deadly pandemic that has much of the world on lockdown, the title High Off Life can feel a bit flippant. It could have been worse: Future apparently scrapped plans to title the album “Life Is Good,” after the Drake collaboration that finds a home here as a tacked-on single. To his credit, Future has provided some context around the title (“So many tragedies and catastrophes and everything is going on in the world. And you want to enjoy life, as long as you have it,” he recently told XXL) but even so, his tone-deafness is unsurprising. His appeal has always lay in an ability to craft a world that’s not just self-contained, but airtight. Might Future still dramatically reinvent himself? He’s certainly pulled it off before. But as High Off Life suggests, perhaps the more impressive feat would be reckoning with what he’s already become.","The Atlanta icon releases another hour of music rendering tortured hedonism with painterly detail, meticulous production, and melancholy melody.

Sheeesh,MXXWLL,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec55f951a4e85635f12e361/1:1/w_160/Sheeesh_MXXWLL.jpg,2020-05-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mxxwll-sheeesh/,Rare Chords,"MXXWLL might hail from Sydney, Australia, but the beatmaker has a taste for the same vintage favorites that West Coast legend Dâm-Funk trades in: 1980s R&B, synthetic soul, electro-funk. In his work, you can detect classic P-funk, the spirit of Roger Troutman, “West Coast Poplock,” and the G-funk music those sounds inspired. The video for the single “Light Turn Green,” from his new album Sheeesh, even featured a tour around L.A.’s palm tree-studded streets, as if there could be any doubt where this music is spiritually set. The album packs 17 tracks into about 30 minutes, giving the record a skittish beat-tape feel (his previous full-length Beats Vol. 1 was precisely that). Sometimes this means tracks cut off abruptly: The sensual “Slow West” taps out just as the temperature starts rising. The impression is that MXXWLL wants you to know as much about him in as little time as possible. Sheeesh kicks into life with the 8-bit blips of “Player 1 Start,” summoning the spirit of an old Nintendo. It’s a hit of nostalgia that sets the retro tone. MXXWLL has fun making synths squelch on post-disco bop “CRZN”; the wailing key riffs that underpin weed jam “Rollitup” gestures towards West Coast hip-hop before building into a meaty funk-rock jam. In an era of Spotify algorithms and subpar copycatting for licensing purposes, any genuine attempts at retro revivalism must be extremely on-point. MXXWLL brings not just musical chops, but a feeling of wide-eyed sincerity, sliding him next to Thundercat and Anderson .Paak as a modern soul of old-school persuasions. For all there is to admire, Sheeesh doesn’t quite hold together. The guest vocalists, mostly in the early stages of their careers, don’t always distinguish themselves. Guapdad 4000’s vocals on “Relax” sound slightly strained. Rapper John Givez mirrors Q-Tip’s flow a little too closely on “Light Turn Green,” even parroting the lyric, “What’s the scenario?” Ditto on “Things U Do,” which harks back to Prince’s most slithering sex jams (the abbreviation of “you” in the title doesn’t feel coincidental) with the pretty but perhaps unsuitably delicate falsetto of singer Kyle Dion. These, though, are small grievances in a greater scheme. If you don’t peer in close enough to see the flaws, Sheeesh showcases a rising talent with great taste.","The Australian beatmaker has an ear for vintage sounds, and his debut evokes Roger Troutman, P-funk, and G-funk with wide-eyed sincerity.

Runaway Dog,Retirement Party,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebc0514e5423e84f420ea99/1:1/w_160/Runaway%20Dog_Retirement%20Party.jpg,2020-05-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/retirement-party-runaway-dog/,Counter Intuitive,"The song titles on Retirement Party’s second album read like a checklist of responsibilities on the path to maturity, each a bit more dispiriting than the last: “Runaway Dog,” “Compensation,” “Old Age.” By the time we reach “I Wonder if They Remember You,” it can be hard to recall that the band’s primary lyricist, Avery Springer, is barely out of college. But even on their debut LP, 2018’s Somewhat Literate, adult obligations loomed in the background, anxieties spurred by the expectations that set in when college finals give way to job applications. The standout song on that record, the blown-out “Passion Fruit Tea,” offered jamming with friends as a respite to the drudgery of work. But two years later, having graduated with a degree in music business, Springer has an understandably more jaded outlook. Her newfound angst is palpable on Runaway Dog, channeled via slick, outsized refrains. Runaway Dog pursues a more atmospheric and anthemic sound than Retirement Party’s debut, one that doesn’t lean on an onslaught of immediate hooks. This might be a result of the record’s more collaborative process, with drummer James Ringness and bassist/guitarist Eddy Rodriguez providing input from the beginning, rather than simply coming in to record Springer’s fully conceived songs. The resulting melodies are more patient, their progressions more meandering and less obvious. On “Fire Blanket,” which opens with distorted power chords punctuated by blasts from the drums, it takes almost 30 seconds for Springer to start singing; for a band whose biggest singles previously featured her voice within the first beat or two, it’s a sign of restraint. A gleaming new guitar melody introduced in the second verse propels the song to the final refrain with a newfound polish. The same is true of the title track, which opens with a galloping rhythm guitar; drums don’t enter the picture until nearly a minute in. That deferral—building up the song in layers, stacking two verses before anything resembling a chorus—creates a tension that was missing from their previous releases. Trusting that the audience will stay beyond the hook is a bold choice; executing it so confidently from the first track shows a band eager to transcend pop-punk expectations. They take risks with songwriting structure as well, with opening lines often beginning somewhat in medias res; on “Compensation,” Springer drops us into an unfiltered lamentation: “Oh when the quality’s poor, how can you sell a feeling/Without unethical means of promotion?” It’s a rapid-fire mouthful, syllables stretched to fit the rhythm guitar, a rambling tactic that seems designed to blunt the force of her criticisms. But lest the song sound like pop punk by way of Slint, the band lands on a shout-along chorus that’s just abstracted enough to speak to generalized anxieties: “I’ll always know to look both ways before I cross the road/If I get hit all that means is compensation.” In context, it’s a bleak evaluation of the current state of the industry, and a line that establishes what Retirement Party do best: cheeky mixed metaphors, often pulling from childhood lessons, that point out the ironies of adulthood. Verbosity is a standard trope of emo songwriting, one Retirement Party deploy frequently to lend a sense of breathless anxiety to ostensibly cheery instrumentation. But where Springer’s rushed delivery on Somewhat Literate was charmingly dizzying, impressive in its tight enunciation over whip-fast guitars, that approach falters when the band takes its time. With each word painstakingly drawn out, the sheer syllabic effort on slower tracks like “Old Age” and “Afterthought” sounds taxing, as if she’s fatigued by so many vowel sounds. On a record only 10 songs long, the odd vocal crack or awkward rhyme can threaten to derail the momentum so steadily built in the first half. But the inclusion of slower songs—ballads, almost—also signals a conscious effort to avoid premature categorization. They’re an emo band from the Midwest, but they don’t have the twinkling orchestral melodies of “Midwest emo.” They sing about anxiety over power chords, but their lyrics are couched in a layer of detached poeticism that sets them apart from the frustrated, lovelorn cries of their pop-punk peers. Springer nods to the patterns expected of her band on the quiet, twangy closer “Wild Boyz”: “Write a song that they can sing along with/Make friends that you don’t even have to talk with.” It might be a recognition of the band’s current ambitions, and a confession that she wants something more. As a distorted guitar breakdown sweeps over the track like an approaching storm, we’re left with a band fit for a stadium, no matter the size of the rooms that they’re currently playing.","Avery Springer and her bandmates grow into a bigger, bolder sound on their second album, pushing beyond obvious hooks and taking new risks with their songwriting.

Notes on a Conditional Form,The 1975,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec45326ee33b6018584d7a9/1:1/w_160/Notes%20on%20a%20Conditional%20Form_The%201975.jpg,2020-05-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-1975-notes-on-a-conditional-form/,Dirty HitInterscope,"The 1975 are distracted. They are drifting in and out of a podcast while reading the news; putting on a movie and spending half of it scrolling through their phones; living through a pandemic while worrying about the death of our planet—all while finding time to post inane memes on Twitter. Like few working bands, the Manchester quartet has made an art out of multitasking. Their albums are big, hyperactive statements that embrace the mechanics of our fragmented minds: half-evolved and half-destroyed, cyborgs acting out base desires. They never tire of sharp juxtapositions—airtight pop songs and meandering interludes, noisy tantrums and orchestral motifs, computerized mayhem and naked confession—because their very essence lies in the whiplash. If Matty Healy, their 31-year-old frontman and outspoken avatar, had his way, the band’s fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form, would have arrived mere months after 2018’s A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The goal was to satisfy his own need for constant stimulus: “I watch something on Netflix,” he explained at the time, “and it’s like, ‘That was the greatest thing I’ve ever seen. Next?’” It was an exciting proposition considering the myriad breakthroughs of Brief Inquiry: its heartfelt reflections on addiction and recovery, its attempts at generational statements and pop perfection. It was the sound of a band with uncontainable ambition on a creative roll. Like U2 after Achtung Baby or Radiohead after Kid A, they wanted to keep going. But, well, life happened. They got distracted. Following a series of delays, Notes arrives a full year after its proposed release date and makes no effort to hide its complicated genesis. Written mostly on tour and recorded across 16 different studios, it is the band’s longest and most uncentered album; their funniest and most earnest. It features numerous guest appearances (Phoebe Bridgers, fka twigs, Jamaican reggae DJ Cutty Ranks) and an EP’s worth of tracks with no vocals at all. Just to get to the second actual song, you have to make it through two symphonic pieces—one of which is almost five minutes long and features a sobering speech from climate activist Greta Thunberg—and the early single “People,” a throat-shredding alt-rock manifesto that suggests we might already be doomed. The album’s remaining 70 minutes are more introspective but no less sprawling: From radiant, thumping dancehall to the barest folk songs Healy has ever sung, Notes ups the ante on every challenge the 1975 have posed since debuting as a polarizing emo band in the early 2010s. It is neither their Zooropa nor their Amnesiac; at times, it doesn’t quite know what it is. But once again, they mostly pull it off. The band’s secret weapon remains drummer and producer George Daniel, who has grown increasingly adept at matching Healy’s every whim as a songwriter. It’s easy to take for granted by now that, no matter what style the 1975 attempt, it will at least sound great. A slapstick country-emo travelogue? Go for it. A shoegaze snippet with Auto-Tuned ad-libs? Why not. A lush, futuristic Americana story-song? Fetch the pedal steel. From a production standpoint, Notes is their most intricate and impressive work. It seems they have learned the success of a song like “Love It If We Made It” wasn’t just due to Healy’s grand, unifying lyrics: It was the pounding drums, the anxious string arrangement, the sheer momentum that made it not only read like an anthem torn from the headlines but also feel like one. The music on Notes is a narrative unto itself, a spiral into a haywire, alienated mind. “Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy)” spills late-night heartbreak to a pitched-up Temptations sample; the exquisite “Frail State of Mind” ascends from glitchy two-step as Healy sings about a loosening sense of security. “Go outside? Seems unlikely,” he sings in its opening lyrics, and, from that transmission, the record only grows more isolated and uncertain. This sense of solitude unifies the vast changes in production, and even pop turns like “What Should I Say” feel more geared for dimly lit bedrooms than mass gatherings. Healy’s writing takes us to settings that match: alone at the computer, at parties he is desperate to leave, on dates full of boredom and resentment, amid conversations he can’t escape. A verse in the acoustic song “Playing on My Mind” goes as follows: I met one of your friends
And it was dead nice, he was fine
But he said “Things that interest me exist outside of space and time”
Now I know I should have left it but, who says that?
What a sigh Earlier in his career, Healy might have been the one babbling on. Nowadays, he seems more interested in observing from the sidelines, lending a familiar, unglamorous intimacy to his portraits of relationships. The couple in “The Birthday Party” bicker about each other’s bathroom habits, while the Britpop rom-com “Me & You Together Song” finds its starring characters smiling through an underwhelming Christmas outing: “It was shit but we were happy.” The most purely romantic moment arrives in the closing “Guys,” where Healy reflects on his friendship with his bandmates, who he’s known since high school. “You’re the love of my life,” he sings sweetly. On an album that spins from societal collapse through personal catastrophe, it is a small, uncomplicated gesture: an unlikely ode to consistency from a songwriter who has spent his career at war with this very notion. For all its sonic experiments, Notes is filled with these quiet, self-affirming moments. If the 1975’s early work felt like pop music compulsively interrupted with provocations and footnotes, then Notes takes an inverse approach: It is a long, messy experiment that just so happens to peak with some of their sharpest songs. I imagine them piecing the whole thing together like a family moving to a new home, knee-deep in the clutter, where they might come upon a wholesome duet between Healy and his father (“Don’t Worry”), a six-minute extension of the band’s flirtations with UK garage (“Having No Head”), or a self-referential cry into the void about fame (“Everything Revealed / Nothing Denied“). It can feel indulgent. Yes, they have expressed some of these thoughts more succinctly in the past; and yes, the tracklist could be condensed so that you don’t have to clear your schedule to get through it. But when everything clicks, their work has never sounded so patient, so personal. Take, for example, “If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know),” a late-album highlight and their highest-charting single to date in the UK. Evolving from a slow-building intro into a mechanical chug, it is the record’s closest thing to a typical 1975 song—a glittery ’80s arrangement, a ridiculous saxophone solo, a charmingly sleazy hook. All the while, Healy sings about communing with the camgirl of his dreams. In each verse, he makes his way toward the laptop; in the chorus, he is seduced into a kind of digital heaven. “I need to get back,” he sings with bravado. “I’ve gotta see the girl on a screen.” Is it love? Will it last? Does it matter? Of course not. He’s doomed, as usual. And yet, backed by a band who can transform into whatever symphony blossoms in his head, a group who have settled into a personality so distinctly their own that a hundred genre exercises couldn’t strip it away, Healy seems focused, present in the moment. It sounds a little like devotion.","Matty Healy, the enfant terrible of pop-rock, pushes his band all-in with a long, messy experiment that just so happens to peak with some of their sharpest songs ever.

Figures,Aksak Maboul,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec454f71ed2d15ae8657ce3/1:1/w_160/Figures_Aksak%20Maboul%20.jpg,2020-05-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aksak-maboul-figures/,Crammed Discs,"A genre that defined 1960s French-language pop music, yé-yé always had a glaring gender problem. Named famously after the refrain of “Yeah! Yeah!” that American and British bands introduced to continental Europe, many of the genre’s hits cast teenaged girls as doll-faced puppets for older male songwriters. Certain ’60s artists, most notably the indelible Françoise Hardy, challenged their contemporaries’ misogyny problem, yet yé-yé cast its long shadow on the Francophone mainstream for decades. On Figures, Belgian avant-garde fixtures Aksak Maboul offer a compelling détournement of French pop’s gender assumptions. Led by Marc Hollander, Maboul emerged in the late 1970s as both globally minded experimenters and malcontents of convention. Their innovative 1980 album Un Peu de l'Âme des Bandits begins with a song called “A Modern Lesson” in which a signature Bo Diddley rhythm—the sort of clavé beat that courses through the bubblegum sounds of the ’60s—dissolves into distorted punk guitar work and discordant samples of Un Peu’s other tracks. The rest of the album thumbs its nose at Western pop, mixing in musical traditions from cultures as varied as Turkey, Polynesia, Baka, and the Mississippi Delta. After Un Peu, Hollander put Aksak Maboul on the backburner, growing his record label, Crammed Discs, which expounds a highly influential global vision of contemporary sound. He also played in the post-no wave band The Honeymoon Killers, an early collaboration with the singer Véronique Vincent. By the time Aksak Maboul completed their next record, 2014’s Ex-Futur Album, Vincent and Hollander were married and had raised kids together. Musically, she had become frontwoman to his backstage sonic mastermind, a transgressively familiar format they bring to the double album Figures. At its best, Figures addresses a 21st century in which the misogyny of the 1960s lives on, finding new places to hide and new opportunities to rear its head. One of the few English-language songs, “Dramuscule,” features a parodic conversation between a Georges Perec-reading man and a submissive woman. The man describes himself as the woman’s “hero,” and the woman tells the man, “I drink up your words, and I swallow mine,” before she later leaves him or kills herself—the narrative ends indeterminately. Vincent seems to echo yé-yé tradition on “Spleenétique,” repeating the song’s name at the beginning of each verse in a playful chirp before adding a few nonsense words. Yet the title translates to the English “Splenetic,” and the next lines maintain the rageful momentum coiled beneath her upbeat tone: “Idling speed attack/Ire swells in me.” The conflict between words and music reflects the album’s gender battles. Though Hollander composed most of the music, Vincent wrote all of the lyrics, and her musings are often self-reflective. “La musique et les lettres,” she sings on a track near the end, her next line translating into English as, “Words have ensnared me.” While the album’s hour-plus runtime is full of fragments and found sounds, Figures is most cohesive when it serves as a stage for Vincent’s writing. Hollander layers his restless electronic tracks with woodwinds, programmed beats, electric guitar, and runs of jazz piano, but the album lacks the surprising juxtapositions that mark Aksak Maboul’s early work, its relative smoothness often giving the impression that Figures’ arrangements are settings for words and voice. Non-French speakers may find it difficult to appreciate the quality of Vincent as writer and chanteuse. Of course, listeners across the world are alienated by the tyranny of Anglophone songs, and Aksak Maboul’s musical vocabulary is admirably worldwide. Figures is both musique and lettre, male and female, and it rejects a whole bunch of tyrannies in the course of proving its point.","The long-running Belgian avant-garde band explores complicated gender dynamics on their ambitious new double album.

Consummation,Katie Von Schleicher,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec4560a1a4e85635f12e322/1:1/w_160/Consummation_Katie%20Von%20Schleicher.jpg,2020-05-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katie-von-schleicher-consummation/,Ba Da Bing,"Katie Von Schleicher, a Brooklyn-based musician who also plays in the Americana outfit Wilder Maker, makes psych rock that belongs on empty, scorching interstates. Her decadent and intricate retro-revivalism feels synonymous with chrome finishes, the smell of leather interiors, and endless lonely stretches. Loosely inspired by an alternative reading of Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological masterpiece Vertigo, Von Schleicher’s second full-length album, Consummation, attempts to work through the quiet and often unnoticed struggles that come with feeling invisible in a romantic relationship. It is some of her strongest songwriting to date, complemented by virtuosic arrangements and cavernous production flourishes. Consummation is a major step forward for Von Schleicher. The jangly glam rock of 2017’s delightfully scrappy Shitty Hits, recorded directly to tape in her childhood home, left plenty of room to grow. Consummation sounds huge. Its arrangements are overstuffed and pristine, indebted to what feels like every subgenre of ’70s rock without ever devolving into outright pastiche. The distorted guitars and painstaking vocal harmonies of “Messenger” scan as both mutant glam rock and sun-drenched AM gold. All lo-fi proclivities are gone—Von Schleicher isn’t hiding behind anything. “Caged Sleep,” the album’s biggest track, is towering and massive, with urgent pacing and sharp turns. Von Schleicher describes watching herself as though in a dream and questioning her own existence. “The wall was full of green/No one looked at me/How strange/Am I free?” she sings, as her surroundings strobe in the background. Flickering with organs and finger-picked classical guitars, “Gross” verges on Renn Faire at its outset. “If you make honest work you believe it then/Unless no one’s home,” she sings, continually questioning herself and her process. The song maintains its slow, careful pacing until the last minute, when it transforms into a voluminous orchestral pop ballad. Von Schleicher’s best songs never quite go where you might think would make sense. Musically, Consummation is an ambitious record that miraculously does not feel like it’s taking on too much. Its concept is more elusive. Von Schleicher reveals quiet flickers of pain, hinting at feelings of isolation and smallness with occasionally muddled results. But on “Nowhere,” she is at her most candid. She watches her past slip out of focus from the side mirror of a car, surveying the road behind and ahead. “I’ll buy my childhood home/All comfort in the end/And when it fills me up/I’ll be alone again,” she sings soberly as the roofline slips past the horizon. A synthesizer unspools beneath her words like a thread in an ancient sweater. Von Schleicher doesn’t necessarily need to be transparent; more often than not, teasing out the hidden messages that lie beneath her impressionistic songwriting is genuinely enjoyable. Calling one’s pain by name can be terrifying, and she has a great talent for subtlety. Still, Consummation is at its most transfixing when it is at its most legible.","With virtuosic arrangements and cavernous production flourishes, the Brooklyn songwriter’s second full-length is an ambitious record that miraculously does not feel like it’s taking on too much.

Rain Shadow,Golden RetrieverChuck Johnson,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec536a01ed2d15ae8657dee/1:1/w_160/Rain%20Shadow_Golden%20Retriever%20&%20Chuck%20Johnson.jpg,2020-05-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/golden-retriever-chuck-johnson-rain-shadow/,Thrill Jockey,"Jonathan Sielaff, Matt Carlson, and Chuck Johnson share an apparent aversion to sharp edges and hard surfaces. For more than a decade, Sielaff and Carlson’s Portland, Oregon, duo Golden Retriever has used the unusual pairing of bass clarinet and modular synthesizer to make music that flows like liquid. Unbowed by their instruments’ limitations, they create an illusion of fullness, using just-intonation systems to pull ghost tones out of thin air, arpeggios to suggest mirage-like harmonies, and overdubs to weave narrow bands of tone into shimmering expanses. Oakland, California, guitarist Johnson also knows something about making his instrument sound like something it is not. Though he got his start playing fingerpicked acoustic folk in the American primitive tradition, his 2017 album Balsams turned the plaintive sound of the pedal steel to blissfully ethereal ends. And in the duo Saariselka, alongside Marielle V. Jakobsons, he eked even more weightless atmospheres out of his slide and steel strings. Rain Shadow amounts to a meeting of like minds, with a twist. Though Johnson and Golden Retriever have occasionally appeared on the same bills, they’ve never actually played together, not even for the making of the album. While Golden Retriever habitually mix real-time improvisation and subsequent editing, this time all three musicians hunkered down in their respective studios, composing and then swapping their individual parts in a three-way round robin exchange. Golden Retriever performed the final mix and arrangement on two of the album’s four tracks, while Johnson took on the other two. It’s a testament to the musicians’ collective mind meld that no song bears the obvious signature of any individual; it’s impossible to say who put the finishing touches on any of these uniformly luminous instrumentals. One of two 13-minute tracks, “Empty Quarter” opens the album with a soft chordal blush of unknown provenance, the pedal steel sailing gently over the top; multi-tracked clarinets rise in the mix, answered eventually by electric current from Carlson’s modular. There is no melody, just strands rippling and swirling like seaweed. But some imperceptible transformation takes place along the way: The sound thickens and congeals, its individual elements blurred like the texture of frosted glass. These songs differ principally not in method but in tone. In “Lupine,” the album’s most lyrical and sentimental track, twinned clarinets and pedal steel twist in slow-motion counterpoint against a glowing, major-key backdrop; the closing “Creosote Ring” takes similar elements and turns them pewter gray, like rain clouds pierced by harsh sunlight. All four tracks feel like parts of a series; they might be still-life paintings of the same object from slightly different angles, or photographs of a grassy field captured at dusk on four consecutive evenings. Given this uniformity, it might be hard to say just why the long “Sage Thrasher” is the album’s highlight, but it is; there’s a sense of mystery that the other songs don’t have, elements cruising into earshot like prop planes in the distance. The first five minutes feel like swimming through honey, then the body of sound seems to turn paper-thin before expanding once again in all directions, like a physics model of an alternate universe. From modest beginnings, the piece builds to high drama, with the enveloping buzz of an orchestra tuning up—an orchestra of fluorescent tubes, bowed metal, laser beams, and brain waves. It coasts out on a two-minute denouement, dissolving slowly into white noise. At times it would be nice to hear more variation, more detail, more friction: There’s a moment in “Lupine” when analog distortion adds a faint dusting of grit, a welcome counterbalance to the song’s overwhelming consonance. But the relatively concise album is a warm and immersive listen, and it feels timely. Created in isolation out of choice, rather than dictate or necessity, it’s an example of music’s refusal to be locked down. On Rain Shadow, notes bleed across the stave, pass through walls, and are transformed by good old musicianly telepathy; all that is solid melts into air.","The bass clarinet and synthesizer duo and the Oakland guitarist collaborate on an immersive quartet of tracks that feel like still-life paintings of the same object from slightly different angles.

All Visible Objects,Moby,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebdb4757408de6d52fb63a3/1:1/w_160/All%20Visible%20Objects_Moby.jpg,2020-05-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moby-all-visible-objects/,Mute,"All Visible Objects is the first we’ve heard from Moby since the publication of Then It Fell Apart, his second memoir, in 2019. An extension of his first, 2016’s Porcelain, which recounted his rise to fame in New York’s rave scene in the 1990s, Then It Fell Apart walks us through the debauched decade after Play, providing all the dirty details: mind-blowing amounts of vodka, ecstasy, and cocaine; threesomes, foursomes, and failed relationships; dinner with Bowie and beef with Eminem; penthouse palaces and suicidal ideation. Through flashbacks to his childhood, Moby also considers the roots of his malaise in his poverty-stricken upbringing as a compulsive masturbator and sanctimonious Christian prone to colossal panic attacks. In one chapter, Moby recounts dating a young Natalie Portman after meeting her backstage in 1999; then 33, he visited her at Harvard and stayed over in her dorm. Portman’s recollection, however, was of “a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school,” as she told Harper’s Bazaar last May. She wasn’t 20 at the time, as Moby had claimed, but had only just turned 18. At first, Moby doubled down, sharing what he called “photo evidence” of their “brief, innocent, and consensual romantic involvement.” A few days later he apologized, canceled his UK book tour, and announced, “I’m going to go away for a while.” That sentence, “I’m going to go away for a while,” should probably have finished with the words, “to think about what I’ve done.” Yet on All Visible Objects, rather than take the opportunity to reflect, Moby seems to elide his own existence, choosing instead to wrap himself in the flags of his chosen causes and habitual musical modes. Nine of the 11 tracks are variations on a theme of rave euphoria, including several anthemic techno cuts aimed squarely at the dancefloor, and the remaining two are slow-moving instrumentals. As with all his recent albums, Moby has said that the profits from All Visible Objects will go to 11 charities for animal and human rights, which is commendable. His sobriety, spirituality, and emotional stability may have wavered over the years, but he remains militant about animal rights—the phrase is now tattooed down his arms, with “VEGAN FOR LIFE” on his neck for good measure. But Moby the man is practically absent from this project. His voice, usually delivered as a barked monotone or barely-there whisper, appears on only two songs. One is “Forever,” a dreamy spin on laser-show EDM, where it’s processed beyond recognition, saying: “This is the way we’ll stay, forever.” The other is a mournful deep-house yarn called “One Last Time.” The lyrics are vague but plaintive: “This was how we have cried in the darkness/This is where you will save us all.” For a man who’s already pried open his broken spirit for public inspection, all this seems like a missed opportunity. Give us the gory details? Instead, Moby pushes his guest vocalists to the front. Dead Kennedys drummer DH Peligro takes the podium on “Power Is Taken,” a ’90s throwback modelled on the rave poetics of Faithless. “We who hate oppression must fight against the oppressors,” goes his generic command. “Power is not shared, power is taken.” In contrast, hearing Linton Kwesi Johnson on “Refuge” is a literary jolt—and, given LKJ’s stature and gravitas, quite the coup for Moby, even with his back catalogue of celebrity collaborators. The Jamaican dub poet’s single sentence, repeated over stabbing techno, isn’t a call to arms but a tight knot to unravel: “To us who were of necessary birth, for the earth’s hard and thankless toil, silence has no meaning.” L.A. singer Apollo Jane and Moby’s live collaborator Mindy Jones take the rest, including a windswept cover of Roxy Music’s “My Only Love,” which swaps the original’s fleeting grooves for a heavy drenching of pads, strings, and piano. Does he lay it on thick? Absolutely. But it’s too late to begrudge Moby for doing what he does best: soaring electronic music for billboard-sized emotions. The longest track of all is “Too Much Change,” a highly strung epic which winds between jazzy ambient and dusty tribal house for almost 10 minutes. These songs tend towards fuzzy sentiments—the words “love,” “life,” “light,” and “feel” are staples. Many of the musical ideas—tinkling pianos, plasticky strings and emotion-squeezing chord progression—have been part of Moby’s toolkit since the word “Go.” These are his trademarks, and he’s entitled to them. There are none of the misfires that tainted his mid-’10s records, like the syrupy collaborations on 2013’s Innocents. He’s on home turf. The problem is that All Visible Objects sounds like just another Moby album, as if nothing of interest has happened recently, as if his music has nothing really to do with Moby the man—the awkward, panic-stricken, validation-seeking, binge-drinking superstar DJ we now know almost everything about. He’s published 900 pages about his struggles and ostensible redemption, and the punchiest lyric on his new album is about “oppressors”? You’ve got 99 problems, Moby—but as a rich, white home-flipping L.A. restaurant owner, “the Man” ain’t one.","Richard Melville Hall is back to doing what he does best: making soaring electronic music for billboard-sized emotions.

The Goat,Polo G,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebdb1c0d7b4ffbd26509b25/1:1/w_160/The%20Goat_Polo%20G.jpg,2020-05-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/polo-g-the-goat/,Columbia,"Polo G raps with a sing-song lilt, but his songs are shaded with murders, heartbreak, and incredible pain. Each line is rendered in careful, writerly fashion, his voice barely produced and almost never doubled, so there is often little to distinguish chorus from verse. Memories, boasts, threats—all of it simply spills out. His songs are informed by the drill music that Polo grew up on on Chicago’s North side and once tried to imitate, but also borrow from rap’s more classicist branches. This approach was perfectly crystallized on Die a Legend, his arresting debut album from last year, which plays like an LP made up exclusively of the bloodlettings that sneak onto some albums’ B-sides. Its hits seem inevitable outgrowths of Polo G’s larger approach, the way its verses slide naturally into hooks. And the world it creates is unspoiled by outside interference: no treacly A&R-insisted beats or clumsily grafted features. It was easy to get lost inside. Polo G’s follow-up, The Goat, is not quite so shut off to the world. Its front half is especially adventurous, folding in kinetic collaborations with rappers from North Carolina and Tennessee and tender love songs. It is not the singularly engrossing experience that Die a Legend is, but it argues for him as an adaptable and unmissable talent, an unlikely star in a new major-label system. When he does return to that well of somber reflection, Polo G draws some of his most chilling material yet: see the desperate “Relentless,” where he tries to convince skeptical friends: “Heaven ain’t the only way we can escape up out the gutter.” It cannot be overstated how plain Polo G’s preferred syntaxes are, and how unsettling an effect they can have depending on the subject matter. This is, after all, a young rapper whose biggest hit includes a chorus that goes “We come from poverty, man, we ain’t have a thing.” When he raps about pain or trauma from his childhood and teen years, he often refers to them as “pain” and “trauma”; rather than make his music vague, this clarity is a helpful guide through dense verses packed with detail. Take the shimmering “No Matter What,” where he laments that his new money and power can’t bring back his departed friends: “But my homies died young and that wasn't part of the plan/Flying on these planes, wish I could reach and touch your hand/I don't wanna be awake, that's why I keep popping these Xans.” The problems are laid bare and the solutions are destructive, but the music—its lyrics and its sound—is always searching for a sort of exaltation. Later in that same song, Polo G recalls sitting in a Cook County Jail cell as a public defender explained the details of a plea deal. He juxtaposes this memory with a more recent one, of him on stage in front of thousands of fans, but the latter does not scrub away the former. Polo G often raps about a string of arrests and short incarcerations as a teenager (weed possession and car theft) as a turning point in his life, and you can hear the weight of responsibility in his raps: a new father, Polo G has moved along with several of his family members to Calabasas. But he’s still haunted by loss. On “33,” he raps bitterly about a friend’s murder that has gone unavenged, a loose end that will never be tied. There is another, curious motif in Polo G’s music. While it’s hardly uncommon for musicians to write about their self-medication, both Die a Legend and The Goat are littered with references to ecstasy. At the beginning of the 2010s, rappers often cited it in its traditional sense, as a party drug; more recently it has been given far grimmer purpose, as a salve for would-be shooters to steel their nerves before deadly confrontations. In Polo G’s songs, its purpose is characteristically plain: to steal by brute force the joy that can be hard to access otherwise. But this, of course, becomes another hurdle to overcome; Polo G has spoken in interviews about the pills’ nagging, lingering effects on his brain and body, and here, on “Relentless,” he raps that he’s “still trying to recover” from them. Beyond the language, Polo G’s music itself has a sort of emotional earnesty. The closing track, the BJ the Chicago Kid-assisted “Wishing for a Hero,” samples the same Bruce Hornsby song that 2Pac flipped for “Changes.” Polo G does not undercut this grandiosity: He not only compares his business mind to Jay-Z’s, but promises Malcolm X that he’ll follow in his footsteps. It is difficult for a sense of destiny like this to read as anything but silly, but who better to sell it than a creatively fearless, uncompromised young rapper who’s bucked conventional wisdom to stand on the precipice of national stardom?","The Chicago rapper’s follow-up to his riveting debut LP argues for him as an adaptable and unmissable talent, an unlikely star in a new major-label system.

How Do You Feel About Getting Married?,Dijon,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebeb04ee5423e84f420ed2e/1:1/w_160/How%20Do%20You%20Feel%20About%20Getting%20Married?_Dijon.jpg,2020-05-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dijon-how-do-you-feel-about-getting-married/,Dark GreenR&R DigitalWarner,"Baltimore-bred, Los Angeles-based Dijon is the quintessential singer-songwriter for this moment where genre and style have become exempt from classifications and hegemony. His new EP How Do You Feel About Getting Married? was released under the R&B/soul tag, appropriate for his yearning, falsetto-laden vocals and the mood of the synthy, digital textures throughout, but many of these sounds lie in the crosshairs of folk and pop-rock. Dijon cites Joni Mitchell and Feist as influences; his 2019 song “lace,” he’s said, was inspired by Smog’s “Teenage Spaceship.” When Little Richard died earlier this month, the vital conversation about how rock’n’roll was not invented by white people reopened. Whether it’s Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Beyoncé’s country stylings on Lemonade, or the often reductive classifications of a folk-leaning artist like Moses Sumney, the message remains the same: Guitar music, despite perception, despite who has dominated the charts, does not inherently belong to whiteness. In 2018, Dijon told the FADER that, as a person of color making Americana-influenced music, he was grappling with a kind of cultural dissonance. “[I’m] fascinated [with] really unironically and genuinely appropriating these symbols, ideas, and mythologies that aren’t necessarily associated with minority music,” he explained. With Dijon’s latest release, any trepidations about his obsession with guitar music are gone. On “rock n roll,” he sings, “She don’t like rock’n’roll/We talked about it… So I told her that I just got a record and I promise it’s a jam/‘Automatic’ and I wanna see you dance.” That would be Prince’s “Automatic,” from 1999, a reference Dijon goes on to pair with name-drops of the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Roxy Music, and, later, Sly Stone and Earth Wind & Fire. Like everything on the six-song collection, “rock n roll” is loud and sparse. Crunchy guitar and big, clubby bass expand and contract as silence peeks in through the synthetic chunkiness. Genre alloys that sound brand new and genuinely surprising—without being a mess—are always hard to come by. Standout “alley-oop,” the EP’s thunderbolt, pairs tender R&B and digital tinkering with pedal steel and country-ish riffs. Throughout, the sound-jamming is focused, the production glossy. But many of Married’s other hybrids are not so unusual that they sound particularly new. Opener “do you light up?” invokes both early Frank Ocean and Merriweather Post Pavilion without muddying the colors, but it doesn’t amplify them, either. Polygluttony reigns right now, and Dijon has figured out his place in it. But sometimes his references seem pulled out of a hat, as when he described an earlier song, “Cannonball,” as an attempt to merge Jodeci and Animal Collective. It does sound like AnCo with soul vocals, but there’s more to a Jodeci influence than soul vocals alone—nor does the combination seem entirely necessary in the first place. Essential on their own, Dijon’s inspirations require singular finesse to succeed as a mix.","Los Angeles singer and songwriter Dijon Duenas’ solo debut takes a polyglot approach, setting his yearning, falsetto-laden vocals against synthy digital textures and folk-inflected guitars.

Starz,Yung Lean,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebd883da994f4606de32ad4/1:1/w_160/Starz_Yung%20Lean.jpg,2020-05-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yung-lean-starz/,YEAR0001,"Yung Lean moaned so Lil Xan could mumble. With his sad-boy aesthetic, the Swedish cloud-rap pioneer set the stage for all the polarizing, Very Online baby-faced white rappers to follow in his wake. (“I thought it was funny, a 16-year-old kid rapping about coke,” he said recently.) But Yung Lean’s music has rarely served as anything more than a bridge for other rappers to advance across. “Yeah, I’m only 23 but there’s like, like, ten of me,” he raps on his new album Starz, not just a flex of his pedigree but an unwitting critique of how easy his stuff is to replicate. Lean deserves a lot of credit for being ahead of his time, but to paraphrase Drake, it isn’t about who does it first, it’s about who does it right, and on Starz, his methods seem outmoded and nondescript. The sounds Lean helped popularize are better off in the more capable hands of his Drain Gang collaborators, especially Bladee and Ecco2k, who push the music well beyond his limits on recent projects. Many other rappers have taken bits of the Sad Boys style and scurried off in so many different directions it’s hard to do a head count, but several of them did something more worthwhile with it. Lean, for his part, has remained largely static. Even as he’s become more comfortable with himself, there’s still an emptiness to his music that makes it seem uninhabited. Starz feels like an abandoned promotional website for a tentpole blockbuster: A snapshot of a bygone little kingdom unto itself, standing still, oblivious to the world that has passed it by. On 2017’s Stranger, Lean polished his songcraft a bit, and he stopped turning sadness into a meme and started reckoning with it. “Red Bottom Sky” showed his pop chops, and “Yellowman” teased the offbeat experimental musician he could potentially grow into. Sadly, the songs on Starz don’t really move in either direction. He’s still largely plagued by the same issues that hampered him in 2013: His boasting isn’t just inauthentic, it’s boring, and glimpses of real, genuine emotion are far too rare. On Starz, it’s easy to imagine most of the songs being better if someone else were performing, or if no one was performing at all. The music’s punch and pathos come from producer and frequent collaborator whitearmor. His icy electronics make Lean’s one-dimensional performances seem stereoscopic. The erupting synths on “Violence” nearly blot out the stains of Lean’s expressionless rapping: “Put the money in motion, I pull strings, Geppetto,” he says, sounding more like the puppet that has yet to become a real boy. The crystalline arpeggios on “Acid at 7/11” aren’t enough to salvage the amelodic chants or the song’s fleeting moment of introspection (“I sold my soul when I was very young/I’m so gone”). Lean has talked before about the titular harrowing incident in Canada, seeing a man crack his skull open at the convenience store while he was high on LSD, describing it as the worst drug experience of his life, but that isn’t the song he wrote. Too many of his songs operate in this way—as approximations of episodes that never quite articulate the feeling. The rapping on Starz, if it can even be called that, is utterly devoid of character. Lean regresses into bad habits, disappearing into empty flexing. “Pikachu” is the most explicit “Young Thug did it better” moment, and on songs like “Hellraiser” and “Iceheart,” Lean’s mentions of brands feel like product placement. There are flashes of evocative writing buried deep. “My dreams are in heaven, I won’t sell you them/Yeah, I lost a friend but we will meet again,” he raps on “Low.” He has a painterly way with melancholic imagery when he bothers: “Blood writings on the moon paint the sky/Living is whatever, I know what it feels to die,” he raps on “Sunset Sunrise.” But most of the time, he doesn’t bother, and whole stretches of the tape pass by without evoking a single identifiable emotion. Yung Lean is most tolerable on Starz when his songs play into the surrealism. On the yappy “Dogboy” and the crooned “Boylife in EU,” his oddball personality jumps out. The closer, “Put Me in the Spell” is closer to the Fray than any rap song, and while his singing is strained and incompetent, at least he’s going for it. Too much of the album seems satisfied with the small space Lean was able to carve out for himself.","On his new album, the sad-boy pioneer regresses into empty flexing, content to remain stagnant while the rap world passes him by.

The Mosaic of Transformation,Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebd75797408de6d52fb6332/1:1/w_160/The%20Mosaic%20of%20Transformation_Kaitlyn%20Aurelia%20Smith.jpg,2020-05-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kaitlyn-aurelia-smith-the-mosaic-of-transformation/,Ghostly International,"For 12 months’ access to an app called Calm—MSRP $69.99, with a lifetime option available for $399.99—your desktop and mobile screens will purportedly become a balm against the captive and infinite present. There are featurettes meant to help you sleep, reach peak performance, and breathe more thoughtfully. In “7 days of Soothing Pain,” communication teacher Oren Jay Sofer coaches you—tidily, hospitably, efficiently—how to cope with awful news. Stars like Matthew McConaughey and Laura Dern contribute audiobooks and self-affirmations. Composer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith—an elegant practitioner of the Buchla modular synthesizer, classical pianist, Yogi, and warm, benevolent spirit whose music has always been very much like a rainbow mist radiating out of the goblet of Earth—premiered her new album on the app a few weeks ago. There is something of a new age awakening afoot. A yearning for holistic spiritual nourishment now lives prominently inside advertising copy, news segments, retail operations, and Twitter dispatches from humanoid brands, each tapping into a collective longing for a return (or brief holiday) to something resembling even partial wholeness. I have seen Deepak Chopra on television every week for the past four weeks. Cooking and gardening websites, which are experiencing an unprecedented boom in web traffic, have passages on mindfulness alongside voguish recipes for very umami noodles or how-tos on watering your indoor plants. “Are you operating from a place of fear and scarcity?” asked the chief content officer of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop in a recent conversation with Entrepreneur magazine. “Take the time to articulate this for your business, yourself, the universe, and the divine.” The captive psyche—and following suit, the market—is arching hurriedly toward high Zen. The conch shell of serenity has been blown with steady pressure across the past 40 years in the fringe universe of East-meets-West experimental music. American new age’s spiritual crucible is roughly rooted in northern California, and, like most monasteries, the genre works somewhat like a family. Based in the small town of Bolinas, Smith’s own sonic relationship and serendipitous friendship with Suzanne Ciani—“America’s first female synth hero”—nurtured her practice with the Buchla world of synthesizers. The massive, water buffalo-sized Buchla 200 series, and Smith’s preferred Magic Easel model—which both work by tweedling the envelope and expression of tones into limitless configurations—were created by Ciani’s one-time boss Don Buchla, the former NASA engineer and close peer to the Grateful Dead’s sound tech, Owsley “King of LSD” Stanley. Like any computer or mind-altering psychedelic, the instrument is meant to mess with the texture of space and time to create an intergalactically exotic experience. Smith’s Buchla music routinely resembles a glowworm of paradise writhing along the other side of the cosmic lane. Her collaboration with Ciani, on an album titled Sunergy, recreates the sensation of watching serene clouds float in miniature. EARS, Smith’s enormous 2016 release, has inspired me more than twice to lie on the ground in a dark room and consider my purpose. Her albums regularly feature the melty blue sounds of an orca’s bubble and squeak, then give way to a foamy bloom of tones that communicate in a language spelled out of mandalas. One of her recent EPs, The Electronic Series Volume 1: Abstractions, contains beautiful Buchla effervescence alongside “a short comic about two friends—a plant and a human being—having an existential conversation.” Each forthcoming volume is “intended to nourish inquisitiveness.’” The Mosaic of Transformation, like Smith’s last album, Tides: Music for Meditation and Yoga, is also made for nourishing purposes. Here, she softly bangs the synthesized gong of a generous strain of spiritualism usually reserved for the discourse of Reiki classes or mindfulness retreats. It veers inescapably toward a place that—while technically inspiring—is unintentionally part of a larger system blanketed as what we need right now. By working earnestly, affectionately, and overtly in kneading the tensions of fear, it points, gently, at the conflicts it tries to abate. By kind design, or by dint of years of yoga practice, nearly all of Smith’s vocals are instructional, inclusive, and meant to be chanted. “Remembering” has eight words of lyrics: “Be kind to one another,” she hymns, as if through syrup. “We’re calming together.” She loops these words through the song’s entirety in a polyphonic canon, rounding and rotating phrases in slow, loping drifts. “The Steady Heart”—equally wreathing, equally peace-inducing—grows like sea lather during a tide. “I believe,” she begins. “I trust. Open up your heart.” Crescendos build, layer, and are serenely laid to rest. As with all chants—religious, political, or like those at the end of a core flow class—their goal is to unify the chanter with a greater whole. Psalms like Smith’s are more than acceptable at face value as restorative, pure-of-heart acts of grace, yet your threshold for bearing this attitude of exceeding amiability may vary. Often, I found myself at odds with her messages, though they are plain and pure as sun. Feel warmth. Feel gratitude. Heal, she patiently asks. The Mosaic of Transformation implicitly states that the endpoint of immersing yourself in its music—wherever or however you may get it—is to care for yourself, which, in turn, will make your world brighter, more palatable, easier to surmount. It is a tender, munificent offering from an artist who has operated in these modes her entire career. But the very idea of wellness has been made curious under present circumstances. Self-care is now less about getting oneself optimized in time for work and more about being able to breathe normally on a Wednesday afternoon. Smith acknowledges that the world is wondrous, and asks us to navigate it more joyously and effectively by centering ourselves and finding our peace. But in the absence of what was once a center—fatigue a global given, the ego constantly under duress, even the notion of work itself under siege—the music unintentionally traces the contours of our great, communal bruise. Smith notes that the album was created alongside a practice of “improvisatory movement”—which is to say, this is a work honoring the body in motion. The final track and melodious adieu, “Expanding Electricity,” swans across 10 minutes of arpeggiated, sprawling Buchla burblings, each whorling, compressing, and flowering like a big ballet born out of the inspirational “bubble of joy” Smith cites as the genesis for this project. This image is especially intriguing at a time when the body’s movements are bounded by isolation, and the extent of our physical freedoms is limited to what we can practice at a safe distance, bubbled in anything but joy. A lyric ribbons through, asking the audience a compelling question: “How can I help to serve you so you can do what you do?” What is it that we do now? The sort of work Smith has devoted her life to is certainly worthy, and it feels good to listen to this album as part of its express utility: to find ways to feel thankful for being alive. What’s impossible to untangle from the album is its relationship to the present, the notion that this is meant to be massaged like an ointment into the mournful, hollow dullness of life in isolation. Hope is not gone, but it often feels like it. An international existential crisis has opened and widened space comfortably, fortuitously, even miraculously, for Smith’s—and new age’s—sensibilities. What that crisis also does is reveal how it finds ways to swallow them.","Channeling new age spiritualism, the California synthesizer musician’s new album is a tender and warm-hearted offering, well-suited as an ointment for the dullness of life in isolation.

Atlantico,Tall Juan,by: Stefanie Fernández,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec3f15acaddbe3e3b13ab76/1:1/w_160/Atlantico_Tall%20Juan.jpg,2020-05-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tall-juan-atlantico/,self-released,"Tall Juan is as tall (about 6 feet 3 inches) as he is named Juan, and in his brief career, he has lovingly commanded the art of pastiche. On his 2017 debut Olden Goldies, Juan Zaballa introduced himself in 15 short songs as a rockabilly crooner raised on the Ramones—Iggy Pop doing an Elvis bit, maybe vice versa. The Buenos Aires-born singer made his way to Far Rockaway, Queens, where he honed his goofy brand of punk alongside former roommate Mac DeMarco and songwriter Juan Wauters (from whom “tall” distinguishes Zaballa). When Zaballa released a modest two-song EP called Tall Juan Plays Cumbia in December, the usual adjectives no longer applied. Here, he reached for a recent past: Buenos Aires in the 1990s and its working-class neighborhoods that cultivated cumbia villera, a synth-washed genre of social protest. It was the first glimpse at his new album Atlantico, a paean to Latin America, the continent’s musical roots in Africa, and the fraught body of water in between. If that sounds like a lengthy project, it is. “It all started when I realized that tango music was created by Africans,” Zaballa said in a recent interview. He names the music of Soweto in Johannesburg as a vector through which he came to better understand that of Latin America, and cites French no wave artist Lizzy Mercier Descloux’s 1984 anti-apartheid album Zulu Rock as his introduction to African musical traditions. Yet at a brisk 22 minutes, Atlantico is a compact exploration of the sounds that form the cultural fabric of Zaballa’s youth in Argentina. The album opens with “Rocio,” a lilting ballad that immediately belies the influence of Zulu Rock’s experiments with Shangaan disco, Soweto jive, and mbaqanga music. Soon after, Zaballa’s whining croon enters, having lost some of its snarl as he rhymes “la isla de pascuas” (literally Easter Island, or an island on holiday) and “ayahuasca” with characteristic nonchalance. On Atlantico’s cover songs, Zaballa uses simple tricks to illuminate the richness of Latin America’s genre dialogues. “Don’t Come,” a jauntier take on Argentine post-punk band Sumo’s “No Acabes,” infuses the song’s reggae foundation with jazz saxophone and rhythm-and-blues guitar. “Think I go to Africa, maybe Ethiopia,” Sumo mused blithely, and Zaballa echoes that desire with naive earnestness, even personalizing one lyric with his own experience as a transplant in Queens: “Living in Far Rockaway, it’s so difficult/I really don’t know what to do.” On “Irene,” the tropicália lick of Caetano Veloso’s 1969 original lends itself easily to the driving acoustic post-punk riff Zaballa adds behind it. And “Los Chicos,” while not a cover, is a sweeping, “All the Young Dudes”-esque zeitgeist ballad: “Los chicos afuera quieren divertirse/Y desde mi cuarto yo los veo tristes/Porque hoy, hoy yo no voy a salir.” (“The kids outside want to have fun/And from my room they seem sad/Because today I’m not going out.”) Throughout the record, Zaballa asks that the music be allowed to speak for itself, just as he has sought to listen more closely. He states that mission in the slow reggae march of “El Mar”: “Desenterrando los sentimientos que hacen/Que en la canción se escuchen las notas caer/Y en las notas se escuchará esta música” (“Unearthing the feelings that allow/You to hear the notes fall in the song/And in the notes you will hear this music”). He subsequently admits he’s not always sure those feelings come through. Atlantico lacks a deeper look at colonialism, the Atlantic slave trade, or the violence that is inextricable to the history of adopting and reframing African musical traditions in Latin America. Short instrumentals like the dreamy “White Castle” (a very Tall Juan equivalence of medieval romance and fast food) and “Rocio Piano,” the fleeting piano flourish that closes the record, give it an open-ended, unfinished quality. The album might feel more incomplete in these respects had Zaballa framed Atlantico as an outward ethnomusicological study rather than a personal one. Instead, it is an ongoing lesson in better understanding one’s own geography.","Drawing on the music of his youth, Buenos Aires-born songwriter Juan Zaballa’s second album cleverly illuminates Latin America’s rich musical heritage.

All That Glue,Sleaford Mods,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec3f4157408de6d52fb66be/1:1/w_160/All%20That%20Glue_Sleaford%20Mods%20.jpg,2020-05-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sleaford-mods-all-that-glue/,Rough Trade,"The British punk-hop duo Sleaford Mods are really a trio: vocalist Jason Williamson, producer/professional button-pusher Andrew Fearn, and Williamson’s water bottle. Williamson doesn’t simply leave his Evian by his floor monitor in case he needs an occasional swig; it’s affixed to his left hand, the life force that allows him to shout himself hoarse for 60 minutes about how everything’s fooked. His desperate gulping forces you to contemplate the superhuman effort he puts into his bilious rants, and, as this new career-spanning collection affirms, the effect remains just as potent when you’re getting berated at home. It makes sense that one of Britain’s most breathless acts would want to push pause now and take a look back: 2019’s Eton Alive cracked the UK Top 10, capping the Mods’ unlikely ascent from playing on sidewalks to headlining Brixton Academy. All That Glue, which bypasses a number of crucial cuts, has no designs on being definitive. Rather, the compilation positions a handful of the Mods’ most popular songs (“Tied Up in Nottz,” “Fizzy,” “Tweet Tweet Tweet”) as familiar cross streets on a back-alley tour of non-album singles, cassette-only releases, alternate versions, and previously unreleased ephemera. Fortunately, with a band as lyrically and sonically crude as Sleaford Mods, there’s zero dissonance between their official and non-official output: All That Glue’s unearthed tracks easily punch as hard as their better-known counterparts, and each showcases Williamson’s bottomless reservoir of ways to vent spleen. The story of Sleaford Mods is, of course, inextricable from that of England itself over the past 10 years. Thanks to dole-line dispatches like “Jobseeker,” the group emerged as Britain’s preeminent punk-rock band for an austerity age where even the most basic punk-rock rudiments (electric guitars, amplifiers, drums) seem like unattainable luxuries, and where no one can afford to feed their families but there’s “digital time boards on the new public shitters.” Williamson’s lyrics provide grave diagnoses on multiple English societal sicknesses, including its rightward creep in the Brexit era; on “Rochester,” he recounts a confrontation with a “separatist pub racist.” And yet he also speaks to quandaries that resonate for listeners with no idea what the EDL or BHS is. On “TCR,” he’s just a forty-something dad trying to keep his cool when chaos reigns both inside and outside his household. On “Fat Tax,” Williamson grapples with the new reality of being a touring artist in middle age: “If I play another venue covered in stickers where everybody chain smokes, it’s so no no!” All That Glue’s chronological sequence emphasizes the most remarkable thing about Sleaford Mods’ improbable success—i.e., that their rising popularity has had negligible effect on their music. (To wit, even Mark E. Smith—who, by law, must make a cameo in every Sleaford Mods review—eventually moved onto congenial Kinks and Gene Vincent covers.) But its cherry-picked tracklist also provides a clearer picture of the duo’s incremental evolution. Sleaford Mods may never deign to write a proper pop song, but as the motorik punk of “Seconds” demonstrates, Williamson has become evermore adept at harnessing his rangy rants into accessible chants. And tellingly, they opt to close with two Eton Alive outliers—the clarinet-squawked “OBCT” and damn-near-balladic “When You Come Up to Me”—that suggest a band on the cusp of a greater transformation. On All That Glue’s opening track, “McFlurry,” Williamson repeatedly declares, “I’ve got a Brit Award” with copious snark. But by the end of the record, the joke doesn’t seem so funny anymore.","The British punk-hop duo’s career-spanning collection shows their unlikely ascent from ranting on sidewalks to ranting at Brixton Academy.

Hair of the Dog,ARTHUR,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebeb3f4e5423e84f420ed30/1:1/w_160/Hair%20Of%20The%20Dog_ARTHUR.jpg,2020-05-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arthur-hair-of-the-dog/,Honeymoon,"The experimental Philadelphia-based singer-songwriter ARTHUR once explained that while he often sets out to write songs that sound like the Beach Boys or Gram Parsons, “they end up sounding like Daniel Johnston if he was a cyborg.” His music delights in pulling the rug out from underneath you, so that cheery, bittersweet tunes like “Simple Song” turn on jarring lyrics like “All I know, and all that’s clear to me/Is that everything ends, and everyone leaves.” Time and again, his sunny pop melodies prove to be a Trojan Horse for his brain-warping sonic experiments and existential angst. Hair of the Dog arrives roughly 18 months after ARTHUR’s debut, Woof Woof, and as the title would suggest, the new record very much picks up where the last left off: it has the same mixture of whimsical, jangling guitars, eerie lyrics, and stomach-drop production maneuvers. But Shea has become more ambitious. The expansive, chaotic “Feel Good” recalls the stretched-elastic percussion of SOPHIE, and the cascading, cavernous beats of “Something Sweet” suit Bronx rapper Caleb Giles’ understated verse. The scrappy psychedelic funk of “Epic” and “I Don’t Want To Talk To You” recall Steve Lacy’s melancholic lo-fi songwriting. Sometimes, these ideas end too abruptly—as with the too-brief, shimmering “Fatalist”—or are expressed too bluntly. The heavy-handed lyrics of “Biz,” which take aim at the superficiality of the music industry (“Your manager says that you look great/With dollar signs written on your face”), feel at odds with the gentle surrealism of something like “No Tengo,” Shea’s best song to date, which does much more work with oddly touching, evocative images like “I can't help but feel small when she kisses my head.” Shea’s music seems to exist in multiple genres and time periods at once, and his lyrics frequently evoke a kind of purgatory. Despite his sing-song, carefree style, the protagonist of Shea’s songs seems to be perpetually trapped, whether that’s “inside a jar of Formaldehyde” (“Something Sweet”), or waiting for someone to come home and save him from loneliness (“William Penn”). The latter song is buoyant even as it takes on a creepy dimension, threatening: “You can’t get away from me!” When ARTHUR nails these uneasy moments, the effect is like looking in a funhouse mirror: what you see is recognizable, yet somehow terrifying, and you can’t avert your eyes.","The Philadelphia-based experimental pop musician nails a sunny, carefree vibe somewhere between creepy and sweet.

how i’m feeling now,Charli XCX,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebeaae57408de6d52fb64ae/1:1/w_160/How%20I'm%20Feeling%20Now_Charli%20XCX.jpg,2020-05-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-how-im-feeling-now/,Atlantic,"How I’m Feeling Now, the album Charli XCX conceived and created entirely at home in quarantine in Los Angeles over the past six weeks, is instantly familiar to a lot of us at the moment. “I’m so bored/Wake up late, eat some cereal/Try my best to be physical/Lose myself in a TV show/Staring out to oblivion/All my friend are invisible,” she deadpans on “Anthems,” a song workshopped during a recent session on Instagram Live, the celebrity platform du jour. “Sometimes I feel OK/Some days I’m so frightened.” Say it louder for the people stuck in a depression nap. Launching a creative endeavor in public feels somewhat incomprehensible right now, when conditions for creating art are so uniquely discouraging. Charli began with a mid-March Twitter note, pondering questions that have become increasingly pressing as the music business scrambles to adapt to pandemic culture: When might it be safe to tour? Who will pay for artists’ work until then? Charli, a self-identified workaholic, forged ahead: She performed at the Minecraft music festival organized by 100 gecs and hosts a weekly video conference with appearances by famous friends. For those who’ve kept up with Charli’s unusually transparent creative process via interviews, livestreams, and screenshots, part of the joy of the new album is simply seeing how her song sketches and Notes app lyrics turned out. Those just tuning in may have missed the stress of a self-imposed May 15 deadline (she only just made it), and how quarantining with her boyfriend strengthened a previously strained long-distance relationship. How I’m Feeling Now is simultaneously a hopeless cry and a celebration of love recorded steps away from its object, with songs like “forever,” “claws,” “7 years,” and “i finally understand” devoted to sincere, immediate romance and pleasure. Though How I’m Feeling Now doesn’t have the same reflective gloss or celebrity guest list of 2019’s Charli, its sound is true to the sugary bounce of the club pop she’s explored since the Vroom Vroom EP in 2016 (A. G. Cook, Bon Iver collaborator BJ Burton, and 100 gecs’ Dylan Brady all receive co-production credits). While life shuts down, this music bursts out. Busy synthetic arrangements snake their way around Charli’s vocals, unmistakable even after they’ve been repeatedly pitch-shifted and filtered. “Claws” sounds like it’s being assembled in a canning factory, ascending a euphoric EDM build to a gaggle of dissonant, bionic vocal vibrations. Opener “Pink Diamond,” a standard-issue Charli banger, makes only passing mention of pandemic life (“In real life could the club even handle us?”). But though Charli might role-play as a party-time pop android, the most enjoyable parts of How I’m Feeling Now come from a vulnerable person in conspicuous glitter armor. “I’ve been reeling for 12 days/When I start to see fear it gets real bad,” goes the tender-voiced first verse of “detonate,” a dispatch from the anxious early weeks of lockdown, when the days were still few enough to count. Even the simplistic premise of “party 4 u” takes on new meaning under the circumstances: “I only threw this party for you/For you, for you, for you.” Hey, it’s not like anybody else can come. The sentiments read simply, but with the collective fear and uncertainty of pandemic still surrounding us, their meaning feels profound. As Pitchfork contributor Shaad D’Souza wrote last week, Charli’s music is not the pop of the future, but a pure expression of the present. By design, How I’m Feeling Now is so current that it’s hard to imagine its message resonating the same way when life begins to feel normal once again. It’s a cultural artifact from the ultimate liminal space, between the old, pre-pandemic world and an uncertain new landscape—why should it live anywhere else? Right now, even “forever” comes with a bittersweet caveat: “I will always love you/I love you forever/I know in the future/We won’t see each other.” But Charli makes a lot of sense here, and she deserves credit as our most fully online pop star. She’s the ideal choice for a festival in Minecraft, where glitchy, pitched-up vocals and the occasional free-association nonsense lyric seem to extend naturally from the game’s surreal, hyperactive world. More than just an autobiographical document or a manifestation of Charli’s impressive work ethic, How I’m Feeling Now is her answer to questions about the viability of music in a crisis. It works better than anyone could have anticipated.","The British electro pop artist sings of love, loneliness, and solo partying across an album built in and made for this very moment.

Becoming (Music From the Netflix Original Documentary),Kamasi Washington,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebeada78b87698b3b0ba32b/1:1/w_160/Becoming_Kamasi%20Washington.jpg,2020-05-19 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kamasi-washington-becoming-music-from-the-netflix-original-documentary/,Young Turks,"That Los Angeles saxophonist Kamasi Washington was tapped to compose the music for Becoming, director Nadia Hallgren’s documentary-film companion to Michelle Obama’s 2018 memoir, feels almost like a given. While there is a vital, venerated, multi-generational jazz scene still thriving in Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama’s hometown of Chicago, Washington’s music epitomizes the Obama presidency’s once-in-a-generation vision, uplift, and sense of hope. Today, that period looks like a beacon of light in a time of incessant dolor. You might even feel a lump in the throat when the film shows 2008 footage of Michelle signing campaign materials as a brief reprise of Washington’s bittersweet 2015 song “The Rhythm Changes” plays in the background. Becoming’s 15 tracks reveal a seldom heard side of Washington: concision. Barely topping a half-hour runtime, the record ends right where you would otherwise be deep into the third cut on The Epic or Heaven and Earth. Yet such brevity suits Washington here, letting him wrap pop-friendly motifs in big arrangements while also allowing him room to experiment with different approaches. In the film, it’s rare that Washington’s saxophone cuts through to the foreground. But as his records show, his charts and arrangements are every bit the equal of his horn, and the soundtrack allows him to fully embrace his inner Q. For all Heaven and Earth’s grand ambition, Washington tries on more styles and takes more risks across these cues. With no room to sprawl, Kamasi cuts right to the melodic core. Sunday-service church organ blends beautifully with his breathy vibrato on “Southside V.1.” Atop subtle strings, he assumes a steamy Last Tango in Paris mode on “Take in the Story,” and slots in alongside the horns on the stepping AM soul of the title track. “Provocation,” which soundtracks a scene depicting the racist backlash that President Obama faced during his time in office, is full of fluttering reeds and suspenseful brass, and its contrapuntal movement makes it as dramatic a piece of music as Washington has recorded to date. Some songs sound almost like snippets of Washington’s winding album tracks, cut into bite-sized chunks. “Connections,” “Detail,” and “Announcement” could easily be mistaken for excerpts from Heaven and Earth, yet they feel slightly anonymous in this context. As refreshing as it is to hear Washington working in a smaller scale, there are times you wish the compact form would give way to sustaining a mood. In “Fashion Then and Now,” just as the quivering strings, chiming piano, and warm woodwinds start to gather momentum, the piece abruptly stops. The most gorgeous track here is “Song for Fraser.” It’s as slow and smoky as a Stan Getz ballad, and Washington’s tone is mellow and enveloping, touched with velvety vibrato. There’s a real ache when it draws down after just two minutes, but in the context of the film it’s even more heart-wrenching. It plays as Michelle Obama fondly recalls her late father, Fraser Robinson III, relaxing in his recliner, listening to his old jazz records. Washington’s score is the perfect evocation of those bygone golden eras—one long ago, and one still fresh in our memory.","Soundtracking Netflix’s Michelle Obama documentary, the Los Angeles saxophonist trades the sprawl of his albums for a more concise approach, wrapping pop-friendly motifs in big arrangements.

Quickies,The Magnetic Fields,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebd706c7408de6d52fb632f/1:1/w_160/Quickies_Magnetic%20Fields.jpg,2020-05-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-magnetic-fields-quickies/,Nonesuch,"At the end of an onstage interview three years ago, I asked Stephin Merritt about the Magnetic Fields’ song “The Book of Love” becoming a staple at weddings, including my own. After some characteristic quips, he turned suddenly serious, recalling how for all of the many marriages at which he’d been asked to perform the song, he’d recently been pressed into delivering the tune at the funeral of his longtime friend. He almost couldn’t get through it, he said, and has associated the song with that somber occasion ever since. Merritt knows how context can deepen music’s meaning. “The Book of Love” benefits from appearing alongside 68 other witty yet tender tracks on the Magnetic Fields’ 1999 landmark album, 69 Love Songs. For more than three decades as a songwriter, Merritt has relished in presenting projects within discrete frameworks, whether group names (The 6ths, The Gothic Archies, Future Bible Heroes) or album concepts (the first person, the Jesus and Mary Chain, “folk”). This process seemingly culminated with another massive collection, 2017’s quasi-autobiographical 50 Song Memoir. After so much history, the brevity-oriented Quickies is a welcome reset. These are short songs, from 12 seconds to an epic two-and-a-half minutes, sparsely arranged. Merritt was inspired by the ultra-short fiction of author Lydia Davis, as well as working on his own 2014 Scrabble poetry book, and, as he cheekily implied in an interview with Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker, “record label preferences.” But short, even radically short songs are already the norm for the Magnetic Fields. Low-key production is also in character. And at 28 songs running 48 minutes, this album is not especially quick or lightweight. This is, blessedly, not the indie-pop laureate version of Twitter, let alone TikTok, let alone Quibi. It’s another Magnetic Fields album, and a fine one, freed from the baggage of a grandiose concept. Because it’s a Magnetic Fields album, Quickies delights in subversion. Its first single, “The Day the Politicians Died,” is a macabre, one-hand-piano sort of party anthem, sung by the Magnetic Fields’ manager and longtime member Claudia Gonson, who deadpans, “We’ve got a taste for blood/So let’s eat all the priests.” On “My Stupid Boyfriend,” a duet between Merritt and another longtime member, Shirley Simms, sung over a whimsical instrument called a banjolele, a laundry list of gender-swapping complaints about their respective partners culminates in a darkly comedic death wish. In the barely-a-jingle “Death Pact (Let’s Make A)” or the autoharp-backed “Love Gone Wrong,” an almost goth-country dirge in which Merritt’s booming baritone recounts gruesome real-life examples of, um, strange love, Quickies finds humor in bleak morbidity. Not all of the laughter on Quickies depends on maiming or death. The sole reference to the album title, the 45-second romp “Bathroom Quickie,” sung by Simms over accordion and celeste, juxtaposes Tin Pan Alley wordcraft and toilet-adjacent fucking. “Let’s Get Drunk Again (And Get Divorced),” which Merritt has said was inspired by his distaste for the Las Vegas wedding scene in the 1977 Martin Scorcese film New York, New York, is even more fun, and flips the classic Magnetic Fields wedding-dance format on its giddy head. Some songs, like synth-pop bad-boy embrace “(I Want to Join a) Biker Gang,” could easily have fit on 69 Love Songs. The Magnetic Fields resonate so deeply for a devoted group of fans, though, because Merritt also manages to subvert his own detached artifice. Quickies, too, cuts to moments of real (“real”?) feeling. “She Says Hello,” another chiming, concise duet, presents an unexpectedly touching, slice-of-life anecdote about a tearful, intoxicated woman’s greeting. “Come, Life, Shaker Life!” is Merritt’s reworking of a Shaker hymn, joined by both Gonson and Simms, and on an album that’s gleefully filthy, its banjo-flecked prayer for purity is oddly stirring, like accidentally clicking over to Sufjan Stevens in the middle of listening to a CupcakKe playlist. As with other Magnetic Fields projects, some deeper cuts succeed more than others. Still, any lows aren’t particularly low, though I could live without the cutesy rhymes on “Evil Rhythm” (“hypno-tithm,” “commun-ithm”) or the trippy first-person zombie-ant fungus tale “Song of the Ant.” The vinyl release, packaged as five 7-inch records, sounds exhausting, but it makes sense for diehard fans. And Quickies is the type of album that’s packed with little details for the particularly devoted, while also brimming with enough of the Magnetic Fields’ familiar charms to welcome those who haven’t yet found an entry point into Merritt’s increasingly vast discography. Merritt typically writes his songs alone in a bar, but see him in person and there’s a palpable sense of community. To promote Quickies, the Magnetic Fields were scheduled to play residencies at smaller venues in seven cities. “Kraftwerk in a Blackout,” with its top-shelf Merritt pop-cultural references (not just Kraftwerk, but Star Trek, too), and inescapable melancholy, might have ranked among the Magnetic Fields’ best songs whatever crisis happened to be in the headlines—certainly, if there had been a blackout. As the song fades, Simms repeats, “Will we ever dance again?” The tour, of course, has been postponed. Brevity might be the soul of wit, but life is short, and, sooner or later, all things must end. From weddings to funerals. In this or any time, there’s something to be said for less context.","The sharp wit of veteran songwriter Stephin Merritt thrives in brevity across a collection of short songs that range from 12 seconds to an epic two-and-a-half minutes.

Beneath,Infant Island,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebd7333d7b4ffbd26509a80/1:1/w_160/Beneath_Infant%20Island.jpg,2020-05-19 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/infant-island-beneath/,Dog Knights,"Infant Island could pass for post-hardcore, metal, or even post-rock, but the first time anyone called them “screamo,” they took on a potentially paralyzing geographical legacy. Barely out of college, the quartet are already the most notable band to emerge from Fredericksburg, Virginia, about an hour away from Richmond, sometimes called “the screamo capital of North America.” Virginia gave rise to pg. 99, City of Caterpillar, Malady, and Majority Rule, bands whose unstable lineups, obscure discographies, and sudden implosions set the standards for emo’s most chaotic offshoot. Recorded and mixed at the studio of Majority Rule’s Matt Michel, Infant Island’s second full-length Beneath is a brazen monument in a subgenre that typically has little use for canon and longevity. The band’s 2018 self-titled debut arrived during an international boom period for screamo. While peers like Portrayal of Guilt, .gif from god, and Respire were pushing the genre towards new frontiers of malevolence and orchestral opulence, Infant Island stood out for their versatility, equally suited for a future in the shadow of Sunbather or as melodic firebrands. But their recording budget was in no way commensurate with their ambitions: It was easier to find the celestette, upright piano, and bowed glockenspiel in Infant Island’s credits than in the mix. In light of Beneath’s sterling production values, Infant Island feels like watching a 3D movie without the glasses. The band sound more daring and confident, and it’s now possible to fully appreciate the intention behind each textural clash. “Here We Are” finds an unexpected nexus between surf-rock and doom metal in its foreboding introduction before burying Daniel Kost’s howls in blue-black tide. “The Garden” and “Death Portrait” are equally locked into militaristic rigidity and spasmodic skramz, visceral and cosmic imprisonment, haunted by bodies buried in the earth and hovering over trees. “Content” plays on the double meaning of its title, tracing a life of complacent cultural consumption before being consumed back in the dirt, bookended by tingling feedback and somber strings. Beneath takes its cover artwork from John Martin, the English Romantic painter of works like The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum, who once boasted that his work “shall make more noise than any picture ever did before.” Like Martin, Infant Island’s bleak palette creates illusions of infinite depth and vastness within relatively compact frameworks. Screamo tends to work in punishing brevity or pulverizing length, but the nine tracks of Beneath are sensibly paced and separated, each movement given enough space to make its point and no more. The album dedicates a significant portion of its runtime to outright ambience, its three evocatively titled instrumentals (“Signed in Blood,” “Colossal Air,” “Someplace Else”) an apocalyptic Neapolitan of infinite darkness, blinding light, and pink mist. Infant Island clearly intend Beneath as a full-length experience, urgent even at its sludgiest tempos. But it’s no slight to describe the album’s first 20 minutes as being in service of “Stare Spells,” a unification of nearly every variant of heavy music within earshot of mainstream acceptance. Connoisseurs could draw comparisons with any number of legends in the way elegiac acoustic chords and glistening reverb commingle with devastating, downtuned sludge and tinny cymbal crashes: some Neurosis here, a little Touché Amoré there, lots of Envy. Kost’s voice falters just the slightest bit upon entry, a split second stuck between a clean melody and a blackened howl; it’s a presumptive error that needed to stay in, proof of the degree to which the band is pushing itself. Ordinarily, Beneath would be heralded as the realization of Infant Island’s potential, but it might not even be their strongest release of the past month. Sepulcher, a four-track EP that’s only six minutes shorter than the album, was recorded after Beneath’s completion but released three weeks prior. It takes the band’s ambitions to extremes: “Burrow” is their most propulsive and dynamic slab of pure screamo, “Ghost Whines” their most defiant commitment to paranormal experimentation. It’s capped off by “Awoken,” the kind of stunning, 10-minute scorched-earth aerial view that every screamo band tries to make when they’re completely feeling themselves. Separating the two recordings is understandable—they were produced at different times, under different sets of pressures. Together, they’d be an instantaneous landmark of the genre; separately, Sepulcher and Beneath are superlative documents of a great band that still has their heroes’ propensity for confoundment in them.","Urgent even at its sludgiest tempos, the Fredericksburg, Virginia band’s second album draws on a bleak palette to create illusions of infinite depth and vastness.

Set My Heart on Fire Immediately,Perfume Genius,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebb18b3e5423e84f420e98e/1:1/w_160/Set%20My%20Heart%20on%20Fire%20Immediately_Perfume%20Genius.jpg,2020-05-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/perfume-genius-set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately/,Matador,"Each Perfume Genius album is a metamorphosis. Over the past decade, Mike Hadreas has transfigured from confessional balladeer to glittering prima donna to our baroque-pop bard. On his terrific fifth album Set My Heart on Fire Immediately, Hadreas emerges with all new contours. Guided once more by the meticulous work of producer Blake Mills and an expert troupe of musicians, including experimental saxophonist Sam Gendel and renowned session drummer Jim Keltner, Hadreas glides between sublime melodies and grimy, guttural dissonance. It is his strongest work to date—a three-dimensional, dust-blown world that is cinematic in its grandeur and intimate in its inspection of the human form. On 2017’s fantastic No Shape, Hadreas sang of liberating the body. Each song seemed to unhitch his spirit from the corporeal grind, letting it whip through the air like Fragonard’s swinging lady. Set My Heart on Fire Immediately feels more grounded, both in the earth and in the flesh. As on No Shape, there are skyward string arrangements and sparkling harpsichord passages, but Hadreas and his crew also introduce harmonium, grumbling synthesizer, and rust-worn electric guitar. The effect is sprawling and dynamic, made all the more intriguing by Hadreas’ agile vocal range. On earlier LPs, his voice pierced through the clouds with a clean note or a vulnerable falsetto. Those techniques remain, but he also dips to craggy lows, enhancing the record’s texture with layers of silt and grit. “Leave” marries these two approaches beautifully. Hadreas’ voice is pitched-down and scuffed, backlit by beams of violin and twinkling keys. Halfway through, howling dogs and unintelligible whispers besiege the song from its edges as the dream succumbs to nightmare. Conversely, “Without You” and “On the Floor” are the album’s most spry compositions. The former floats on plinked organ, distant percussion, and dashes of viola, a blend that somehow resembles a calypso melody. “On the Floor,” the album’s sweet and chewy pop center, bounces atop Pino Palladino’s elastic bassline, so thick it sounds like he’s wailing on industrial-strength bungee cords. Mills’ synth guitar riffs chirp and belch to Matt Chamberlain’s peppery snare, evoking a contemporary translation of Chic. Both songs find Hadreas in a state of intangible yearning. “Without You” chronicles an absence as “a blurry shape” that’s “just enough to find a trace.” In “On the Floor,” he attempts to recall that shape once more. “I’m trying/But still I close my eyes,” he sings, “The dreaming/Bringing his face to mind.” He never quite gets ahold of the complete image—it dissolves just before it’s fully realized. When Hadreas abandons the imagined world to confront physical reality, his palette darkens. On early single “Describe,” his voice seems to emerge from a crust of topsoil. Dirtied, distorted bass and twanging guitar lend a country western flair, and Hadreas’ rugged new look (perhaps a nod to Tom of Finland’s cowboys) enhances the fantasy. His multi-tracked vocals braid and tangle in the mix as he illustrates two sounds similarly entwined: “No bells anymore,” he sings, “just my stomach rumbling.” It’s a loaded couplet, hinting at his lifelong battle with Crohn’s disease, and a gesture toward Perfume Genius’ two greatest fascinations: The erosion of the body and the curative properties of love. When Hadreas confesses that there are no more bells, just bodily functions, it feels like a reluctant surrender to the mundane. If No Shape endeavored to transcend the body, Set My Heart on Fire Immediately embraces the joys and burdens of human anatomy. On mid-album battle march “Your Body Changes Everything,” Hadreas explores the exchange of power between bodies. “Give me your weight, I’m solid/Hold me up, I’m falling down,” he bellows. It might be his most masculine song ever, chronicling a sexual exchange that alternately yields to strength and conquers it. But it is audibly macho as well: Hadreas sinks to a shadowy register, Gendel issues militant sax blurts, and the whole thing gallops to a relentless drum pattern. It’s robust and intense, echoing the theme song from 1982’s Conan the Barbarian (itself a celebration of flesh). Set My Heart on Fire Immediately is both vast and packed with detail. The songs expand and contract, one minute blasting open with the melodrama of a Roy Orbison ballad, the next zooming in with surgical detail as Hadreas describes ribs that fold like fabric, a tear-streaked face, an instance of post-coital petty theft. He laments the passage of time in a trembling existential opus, then squeezes us into a bedroom to witness a clumsy, tortured hookup. On their own, these complementary vantage points are potent; in concert, they are grand, filmic, and tactile all at once.

WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD,Nick Hakim,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebbfc2b8b87698b3b0b9fc6/1:1/w_160/WILL%20THIS%20MAKE%20ME%20GOOD_Nick%20Hakim.jpg,2020-05-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nick-hakim-will-this-make-me-good/,ATO,"Nick Hakim’s compulsively listenable debut album, 2017’s Green Twins, drew from Curtis Mayfield and D’Angelo while adding twists of beat music and psychedelia. His follow-up, WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD, stirs some Parliament/Funkadelic and Sly and the Family Stone into the mix, but the result may frustrate his fans. This time around, Hakim’s tracks are shapeless, often listless, building tension only to let it ebb away. The new record doesn’t just reward close attention; it barely exists without it. Hakim has said that “If I really sink into a recording, I don’t want it to end.” It feels safe to say that he sank into most of the recordings on Will This Make Me Good, and the result can feel endless. But there are many worthwhile moments here, even if they’re blunted by an exhausting run time. WTMMG is definitively a headphone record, and it reveals itself slowly, sometimes on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The drums on “Qadir,” Hakim’s gorgeous lament for a friend who died at the age of 25, steal up on you; they’re fairly wonderful. The guitar chords on “All These Instruments” are catchy. In the opening of “Bouncing,” a bassline and a chorus of spectral voices come together and combust in a moment of excitement. Listening to the record becomes an exercise in prying its many beautiful moments from their duller surroundings. “Crumpy,” buried in the album’s back half, is its strongest song, and it’s not a coincidence that it sounds a lot like the tracks on Green Twins. (Hakim said in an Instagram post that it was recorded sometime between 2017 and 2018.) It is, more than anything else here, a song, and its opening lines have more character than anything on the record: “This town has really started to grow on me/My face has become one with the concrete.” In a gesture that expresses a fundamental reluctance at the core of this album, the lyrics on the title track, a meditation on morality and radicalism that should be one of the more compelling songs here, are distorted and difficult to hear. In a tweet announcing the album, Hakim appended a note that explained a little bit more about its origin. He said that he had been experiencing writer’s block, but that the blockage had been “a build-up to the three months of expression that led to this album.” Still, he confessed, he was “still trying to figure this record out. People have told me that it’s confusing or it’s messy—that’s fine.” Credit Hakim for his self-awareness and his candor. But the people who told him that were right. WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD has plenty of gorgeous moments. Those moments will inspire the most generous listeners to wonder what this record could have been, if Hakim had given it more time to gestate, and maybe edited himself more.","The Brooklyn musician stretches the boundaries of his psychedelic soul sound, yielding a record that alternates between hypnotic and languorous.

"Every Sun, Every Moon",I'm Glad It's You,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ebee5c6d7b4ffbd26509ca0/1:1/w_160/Every%20Sun,%20Every%20Moon_I'm%20Glad%20It's%20You.jpg",2020-05-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/im-glad-its-you-every-sun-every-moon/,6131,"Grief casts a shadow over the past. It lends new meaning to old photographs, text messages, and inside jokes, all indelibly colored by loss. On I’m Glad It’s You’s Every Sun, Every Moon, grief leads the Redlands, California band to revisit lyrics and song titles from their 2016 album The Things I Never Say. It was while touring that record, in 2017, that a van accident killed the band’s concert videographer and close friend Chris Avis. I’m Glad It’s You canceled the remainder of their tour; it would be another year before the group performed together in full and began the process of recording a new record. Every Sun, Every Moon is a lustrous document of that healing, casting the aftermath of shared pain in radiant piano and synths. The first words sung on Every Sun, Every Moon call back to the band’s first full-length: “Another long last look from the back of the ambulance,” frontman Kelley Bader croons on “Big Sound,” echoing a memorable line (“Take a long last look”) from 2016’s “Curbside.” But where once he sounded decidedly resigned, almost sighing, here his delivery is remarkably full-throated, riding brightly over searing guitars and synths. Similarly, “The Things I Never Said” casts a regretful glance back at The Things I Never Say, the title of their debut, the song’s introspection bolstered by piano interludes and surf-pop vocal harmonies. More than just Easter eggs, these references highlight the contrasts between then and now. It’s as if, spurred by the experience of unspeakable tragedy, the only way to return is louder. The album’s more mature palette was honed with the help of veteran producer J. Robbins. The former Jawbox frontman has spent the past three decades elevating scores of sheepish, shrugging bands to new melodic heights, leaving a legacy of adventurous, potent emo in his wake. The album is full of allusions to his highlights reel: The dense guitars that swirl around “Ordinary Pain” recall the Promise Ring’s classic Nothing Feels Good; the chiming chords on “Lost My Voice” bring to mind his work with Midwestern stalwarts Braid. Robbins’ direction suits the band, who had previously experimented with electronics on a “Redux” version of their 2016 record. Here, drawing on his experience producing similarly ambitious artists, he chooses studio techniques designed to flesh out the record’s narrative.  On “The Silver Cord,” ethereal synths complement the song’s vision of a visitation from the afterlife; on “Death Is Close,” a fluttering Mellotron sets an appropriately elegiac tone. In his diverse palette, Robbins reinforces the many moods the band traces throughout the record. Robbins’ production also serves as a welcome, weighted counterbalance to Bader’s writing, which leans on metaphorical imagery to describe the complex mechanisms of mourning. After that early, ominous reference to an ambulance, the focus turns to the more ambiguous, amorphous project of healing. Often, Bader leans on his Christian upbringing; this comes to a head on “Lazarus,” which pits the Biblical miracle of rebirth against the permanence of death. “The second coming savior running late this time and now I think I see/What Lazarus taught me,” he sings meekly, the ache in his voice burnished by smoldering guitars. As opposed to the tinny, bare-bones production of their prior EPs, the song’s textured facade takes note from British shoegaze, couching dark, nihilistic topics within a thick, protective coating of distortion. But where a Christian metal band, or emo peers like Reliant K, might find solace in God, Bader eschews facile resolutions. “Myths,” despite its repetitions of “hallelujah,” finds an easy savior not in prayer, but in the glacial passage of time: “Someday soon the day is going to come,” he pleads, his voice picking up as the drums kick in. It’s an ambitious song, not only for its plaintive piano arpeggios and liquid, reverb-heavy guitar, but for the careful, slanted rhythms in its verses: “My flickering flame/Dancing for rain that doesn’t pour.” The rhymes come unexpectedly, a destabilizing effect that forces a close listen and mimics the uncertainty of grief. “It’s a hallelujah/And I’m learning how to sing” might not be the typical shout-along chorus that I’m Glad It’s You expected to write when they first set out on the road three years ago. But through trauma, they’ve landed on the profoundly triumphant note that so many emo bands spend their careers angling to reach.","Following an accident that took the life of their tour videographer, the California emo band finds new meaning in old ideas, while J. Robbins’ production nudges them toward newfound confidence.

They sustain this conversational euphoria over the following 10 improvised tracks, with nary a “solo” to be found, while homing in on each other’s frequencies. No matter where the pair travels on this unpredictable set, they do so in intimate dialogue. Anderson and White make for sympathetic collaborators, and their first album together glows with ease. The Quickening shifts freely between moods and modes, but Anderson and White never sound like they are jamming aimlessly; each piece is a window opened onto a self-contained universe. On “Last Days,” Jim White lays out a lurching, ominous march rhythm while Anderson paints a blasted landscape. On “Diver,” Anderson coaxes an elegant bloom of drone into a conflagration of melody over White’s almost-invisible tom-tom accents and brushed cymbals. For Anderson, the album represents a breakthrough. Over the years, she’s stretched her vocabulary from the spare blues-folk of her early work to 2018’s astounding Cloud Corner, which was filled with mountain ghosts, empty spaces, and occasional humming keyboards. Anderson contributed to Portland’s Evolutionary Jass Band for years, where her guitar and sitar were subsumed into the larger free ensemble. But The Quickening is unlike anything in her discography, and with it she uncovers a new landscape of possibilities. Veteran Dirty Three percussion hero Jim White drums the way rain catches the surface as the rain shifts, except that White controls where every drop lands. Especially on the pair of nylon-string acoustic numbers (“The Lucky” and “The Quickening”), White’s powerful sense of flowing no-time works in elegant tandem with Anderson’s phrasing, joining to create a unified third voice that is neither exactly rhythmic nor melodic. That third voice is the most ecstatic feature The Quickening has to offer. It is music as a frozen moment, a precarious combination of energies and ephemeralities and economies. To listen to any free improvised music is to hear another world, speaking its own spontaneous language. The Quickening comes from a place very nearby our own, now lost, but recoverable by listening.","The Dirty Three drummer and expansive guitarist collaborate on a freely improvised album that glows with ease.

Dare,The Human League,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9c504d7b4ffbd26509673/1:1/w_160/Dare_The%20Human%20League.jpg,2020-05-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-human-league-dare/,Virgin,"In late 1980, the singer Philip Oakey was scheduled to go on tour and make a third record with his band the Human League. The problem was that there was no Human League. The founding members had departed acrimoniously, leaving Oakey with just the name and a lingering associate, Philip Adrian Wright, whose only role was to project slides of rocket schematics and stills from old movies behind the group’s live performances. Together, Oakey and Wright had to somehow make a new band and a new album out of nothing. Oakey didn’t have any finished songs, just a few disconnected ideas. The recently departed synth technicians Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh had written most of the music for the first two Human League records and, as far as critics were concerned, they were the real talent of the group, the masterminds behind the eerie yet often danceable synthesized music which sounded like it could’ve emanated from a post-apocalyptic nightclub or a dark alien obelisk in the desert. Oakey, by comparison, was a pretty face, a deep voice, and an eye-catching asymmetrical haircut—one side cropped close, the other a dark waterfall of hair. He and Wright were the visual element of the band, the kitschy surfaces that made even their bleaker electronic ruminations pop. Oakey could sing but he didn't have much in the way of musical talent, and he was anxious about writing a new Human League record on his own, especially with the added pressure of delivering something more successful to the record label than their previous album, 1980’s Travelogue. “I thought we were going to fail and everyone was going to laugh in our faces,” Oakey told the Sunday Herald Sun in 2009. But Dare, the album he made with the ruins of a broken band, was a paradigm shift: It signified the end of something old—the original Human League—and the beginning of something new—synth-pop—all at once, a kind of prism that all pop music would soon pass through. Three years earlier, Oakey had just been hired as the singer of a band called the Future, whose other two members, Ware and Marsh, had run in the same Sheffield arts circles since they were teenagers. They were all obsessed with science fiction, and many early Human League songs—for instance, “The Black Hit of Space,” about a song so dull it opens up a black hole that swallows the listener and the world around them—read as if they were pulled from a Philip K. Dick story collection. They grew up on glam rock, whose influence lingered in Oakey’s appearance, his features softened by makeup, his ear often sporting a long shimmering earring. But when Ware and Marsh heard German electronic group Kraftwerk, along with Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love,” they thought they were hearing the future of music. They noticed that the future didn’t seem to have any guitars. The future was a vortex of processed sound. With the addition of Oakey’s shadowy, handsome voice, they renamed themselves the Human League and started to reconceptualize themselves as a pop band. Befitting their avant-garde origins, they worked from an indiscriminate definition of “pop,” covering advertisement jingles and themes from film scores, absorbing and refracting every kitsch artifact in their grasp. But their approach proceeded from a true love of pop culture and its ephemera; the cover of the Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling” on their 1979 debut album Reproduction, manages to be truly heartfelt and warm through the cold glitter of its instrumentation. Human emotions were timeless, the League seemed to say. Only the technologies that conveyed them changed. But Ware and Marsh’s departure in 1980 left Oakey without even that bed of technology. So Wright was promoted to occasional synth player, and he and Oakey searched the Sheffield streets for new band members. Oakey had been listening to Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall and wanted to incorporate a high, androgynous falsetto into the Human League’s music, something that could hover like a spotlight over his own dark baritone. A few weeks before the tour started, he visited the Sheffield discotheque Crazy Daisy, which was hosting its “Futurist” night. Through a tangle of chic glittery people dressed like Gary Numan, Oakey glimpsed two girls—Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley—dancing in the lights. Something about their appearance and the way they moved—angular and awkward, charming and unselfconscious—mesmerized him, and he invited them to join the band even though they were both still attending high school. They were also fans of the band, and had purchased tickets to a Human League show on the very tour they were being hired for. Catherall and Sulley were neither trained singers nor professional dancers. Their voices wavered through notes, but they glowed around Oakey’s gloom like museum light on a sculpture. Their presence added an ineffable layer of glamor to the group—where the old Human League appeared inflexible and robotic on stage, this new League blushed with movement and color. Oakey’s method of saving his band wasn’t necessarily creative or musical but utterly visual. Could anything be more pop? Regardless, Oakey still needed to put together the pop music that would reinforce the visual shift. After the tour ended, Virgin Records sent in producer Martin Rushent to help shape the new Human League material into something not only professional but commercial. When he arrived, the band had just started work on a track called “The Sound of the Crowd,” a song Oakey and recent Human League recruit Ian Burden were building on synthesizers around a very simple, lopsided figure of thumping tom sounds. When Oakey first played the demo of it for Sulley and Catherall, it sounded simplistic and a little rickety, but they knew it was a hit—they could envision themselves dancing to it. Rushent wasn’t as impressed; he wanted more. He threw the demo out and insisted they start from scratch. What Rushent turned “The Sound of the Crowd” into remapped the world of pop music around it. He programmed a song without much potential into a chain reaction of synthesizer and drum patterns, all pulsing together in white space. Nothing on the radio, beyond Gary Numan’s geometric synth constructions, sounded quite like it. Each sound is so clean and separated you can hear them leave different impacts on the blankness. It’s also a staggeringly simple composition, a verse and a chorus culminating in a breakdown where Oakey, Sulley, and Catherall’s voices build to a scream. But in Rushent’s hands, it’s shaped into something as modern and distinct as space-age furniture. During the recording process, the band fused two different songs into “Love Action (I Believe in Love),” its synths sinking and creeping through like water leaking through a tar roof. Oakey broods through the whole thing, except for an abrupt monologue between the first and second chorus (“I believe, I believe what the old man said”) that reels out of him nearly at the speed of rap. None of them—not even Burden and Jo Callis, experienced touring musicians whom Oakey and Rushent had planted in front of unfamiliar synthesizers—knew exactly what they were doing, or if anything they were writing would work as a song. Rushent would listen to the rough mixes of Dare songs when he returned home from the studio and couldn’t figure out whether the album they were making was brilliant or terrible. This is, incidentally, why Dare works so well. The songs are simple, sometimes containing only one or two melodic ideas, and synthesizers connect in lattices around them. Opener “The Things That Dreams Are Made Of” is just a few sing-songy sequences stacked on top of each other, while Oakey sings lyrics that have all the frenzied energy of travel brochure slogans: See the world—Berlin or New York! Spend money and acquire new friends! “Dare to feel! Take the chance! Make the deal!” he sings in “Open Your Heart” as two-note synth chords drone around him like rays of daylight. It works almost like an advertisement: Very little is happening, but there’s just enough to catch your eye. Dare’s title and art were modeled after an April 1979 Vogue UK cover where the word “Dare!” glowed in neon pink above the warm blush of a model’s face; in all of the variations of the album’s cover design, a member of the band presses their face against a narrow rectangle, staring out into the same glossy white void it feels like the music was born in. But Dare is more than an advertisement for itself. There’s a hole at its center where the band abruptly slips into a dark glimmer of the old Human League. A spare cover of the theme for the 1971 crime film Get Carter opens the second side, retaining only the harpsichord line from the original, transposed here to a synthesizer so high and keening it sounds like a disembodied cry in the dark. Then the dystopian “I Am the Law” slithers into view, Oakey seeming to sing from the perspective of a police officer who believes he knows what’s best for the people he’s supposed to protect. It’s sinister and terrifying—the instrumentation creeps like the shadow of a hand over an insect. “Seconds” seems to snap the album out of this black mood, but its lyrics depict John F. Kennedy’s assassination, and eventually, the song just lapses into repetitions of the chorus: “It took seconds of your time to take his life.” Oakey runs through the shared cultural memory over and over again as if he were circling it on a track, trying and failing to see it from a new angle. Of course, Dare isn’t remembered for the darkness that engulfs its middle, but for the frozen glow of its singles, which presaged the dawning of a new era in pop music, one where synthesizers and drum machines processed the flutter and ache of crushes, romance, and heartbreak. But the League never again achieved the world-blanketing success of Dare, especially not its fourth single and final track, “Don’t You Want Me.” Oakey didn’t want “Don’t You Want Me” released as a single, and fought with the record company when he learned they’d selected it; needless to say, it’s ironic that the song on Dare that most wants to be wanted would be the one Oakey was most embarrassed over. For the lyric, he rewrote the plot to A Star Is Born as a duet of intraband drama between himself and Sulley. It’s perfect: the thick fog cast by the opening synth line, Oakey’s stone-faced gloom quickening into desperation in the transition from the verse to the bridge, the way Sulley’s voice gets shaky as if it’s feeling the desolate cold of the song. They ask each other the same question, yet the disconnection between them is so profound that neither person can hear it, a lonely signal sent into darkness as vast and quiet as space: “Don’t you want me?” Oddly, the League didn’t get to participate very much in the strain of pop they helped develop. “(Keep Feeling) Fascination” and “Mirror Man” were released over the next two years, but the sessions for the follow-up, 1984’s Hysteria, were so torturous and overextended that Rushent abandoned his role as producer and was replaced by Hugh Padgham. A few years later, the band would enlist Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to write and produce one of their signature songs, the redundantly-titled “Human,” which plunged their voices into a liquid R&B soundworld and gave them another hit. But the aesthetic and commercial successes of Dare were unrepeatable; the Human League could never be as unaware of the music they were making ever again. It’s the unconsciousness, that not knowing, that makes the record so great, that makes it sound like it’s beamed in from some vast emptiness. It was pop music that resembled the most enduring pop culture in history, things that didn’t know what they were until it was too late—the Beatles, Marilyn Monroe—massively popular figures that were absorbed as images before they were ever accepted as art. In making a record that no one involved could tell if it was any good, they made something unprecedented.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the high-art synth-pop of the Human League’s Dare, a prismatic album that all pop music would soon pass through.

LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR,Bad Bunny,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9bc908b87698b3b0b9e03/1:1/w_160/LAS%20QUE%20NO%20IBAN%20A%20SALIR_Bad%20Bunny.jpg,2020-05-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-bunny-las-que-no-iban-a-salir/,Rimas,"Like almost everyone else, Bad Bunny’s life got derailed when the coronavirus pandemic swept across the globe. Unlike most everyone else, he was coming off a performance with Shakira at the Super Bowl and shooting scenes for his debut acting role in the new season of Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico when much of the western world shut down, sending him back home to Puerto Rico to wait out the crisis. Weeks of isolation tested the limits of his ability to entertain himself—and us—without leaving the house. As he told Rolling Stone, he grabbed some old beats, called up some OGs, and pulled up to his engineer La Paciencia’s crib to track some vocals. And less than three months after dropping YHLQMDLG, the high-water mark of his career, Bad Bunny had a new album out. The title of that album, LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR, loosely translates to “The ones that weren’t coming out,” a play on words that references both the songs on the record as well as Bad Bunny himself, holed up in an Airbnb with his partner since March. Nine of the 10 tracks were pulled from the cutting room floor of the YHLQMDLG sessions; unfinished, unmixed, and unmastered beats with no vocals that Bad Bunny resurrected while in isolation, with a little help from his friends. Most of them appeared in some form during his marathon home quarantine concert broadcast live on Instagram earlier this month. The record plays quick and dirty, with uncharacteristically crunchy production value and lo-fi aesthetics. Even the album cover is lo-res. YHLQMDLG was a slickly produced homage to marquesina mixtapes; LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR sounds like it could actually be one, the kind of record a teen Bad Bunny might play at one of those underground garage parties. He says he put the record together in two days, and it shows. But far from detracting from the experience, the loose grit is part of the appeal. “Reggaetoncitos” that smooth out reggaeton’s rougher edges may have helped it merge with the mainstream, but Bad Bunny’s career has been defined by pulling the mainstream closer to him, as opposed to vice versa. Even as he’s reshaped urbano in his own image, he’s shown a healthy respect and admiration for its underground outlaw beginnings, and consistently made the case that there’s room for perreo on the pop charts. A quick glance at the guest features reveals the dichotomy of old school and new school—legends like Don Omar, Yandel, and Zion y Lennox represent the OGs, while nascent hitmaker Jhay Cortez offers a glimpse of the talent in urbano’s next generation. And while YHLQMDLG standout “Safaera” felt like a five-minute tribute to DJ Playero’s genre-defining mixtapes of the 1990s, he tips his cap to them even more directly here. “BAD CON NICKY,” his collaboration with Medellin-via-Puerto Rico reggaetonero Nicky Jam, samples Daddy Yankee’s “Donde Mí No Venga,” a seminal track in reggaeton’s history from Playero 37 that makes plain the lineage that connects reggae en español and reggaeton. Lyrically, LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR mostly sticks to Bad Bunny’s trademark sex flexes and party jams. But even in tossed-off mixtape verses, he retains a goofy charm; “Tantos hijos que no sé cómo los crío/Y en los dedos tengo el iceberg que rompió el Titanic/Los mato flow Sosa y quedan blancos como Sammy” he raps on “RONCA FREESTYLE” (“So many kids that I don’t know how I raise them/And on my fingers I have the iceberg that sunk the Titanic/I kill them, Sosa flow and they're left white like Sammy”). The album’s final track was the only one made from scratch during Bad Bunny’s self-imposed quarantine and offers the most literal view of his life in isolation. He compares the cause of his hermetic lifestyle to Puerto Rico’s corrupt governor, lamenting both his canceled concerts and lack of access to AutoTune. It’s also duet with his partner Gabriela Berlingeri, who has proven to be as much a collaborator as she is a paramour since the pair went public with their relationship earlier this year—she laid the reference vocals for his JLo collab “Te Guste,” and even shot his recent Rolling Stone cover. LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR is incomparable to Bad Bunny’s first two LPs: Those were two carefully crafted masterpieces, whereas this is merely an extracurricular project from a bored superstar trapped in a house for weeks on end. That it’s still this good is a reminder of his otherworldly talent.","With most tracks pulled from the cutting room floor of the YHLQMDLG sessions, Bad Bunny shows he’s in full command of his music, even when it’s a little rough around the edges.

Sorceress,Jess Williamson,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9bdb4caddbe3e3b13a576/1:1/w_160/Sorceress_Jess%20Williamson.jpg,2020-05-16 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jess-williamson-sorceress/,Mexican Summer,"For around $38, or the price of three cheese raviolis at Olive Garden, you can buy a 1.5-ounce jar of “Sex Dust” at Urban Outfitters. Sex Dust is an “aphrodesical warming potion” sold by the wellness brand Moon Juice, one of many witchy, New Age-y remedies endorsed by Gwenyth Paltrow, whose GOOP empire helped bring psychics and Tarot to the mainstream. You might also pick up some quartz crystals and zodiac tapestries, or a “survival mist” to tide you through Mercury’s retrograde. Nowadays, the occult is crudely commonplace, which poses a problem: In 2020, a folk singer with a collection of songs titled Sorceress and a passion for books on “spirituality, new age weirdness, and ... witchy woman 101” might be a little passé. But Texas singer-songwriter Jess Williamson’s fourth album is not breathlessly absorbed in the cosmos; it’s thoroughly grounded on earth. Whereas 2018’s Cosmic Wink was, in her words, about “naively trusting in synchronisticity and magical thinking,” Sorceress discards utopianism. The word “sorceress” emerges as a refusal, an acknowledgement of mortal limitations: “Yes, there’s a little magic in my hat/But I’m no sorceress,” she tells a skittish lover on the title track. Wistful observations like “you ain’t a tourist here no more” signal the time that’s passed; her body, she repeats, is aging. The moments Williamson documents are bittersweet and ordinary: having enough money to buy the expensive eggs, or losing a pregnancy, or getting invited to an ex’s wedding but wisely choosing not to go. The overarching sense is of someone who’s wised up; she’s too old for turbulence. “Can we put the coffee and our favorite record on?” she asks, fatigued, on “Love’s Not Hard to Find.” Williamson has a fluttery, plaintive voice reminiscent of Angel Olsen or Faye Webster, and the mood of these songs is that of watching an old friend pack their belongings and disappear down the road. “As the Birds Are” is especially forlorn and cinematic, like a classic film heroine taking one last glance at the wreckage before she goes. “Oh, to live in some photograph,” Williamson cries, apologizing for her past cruelty. “Wind on a Tin” was inspired by a revelation at a friend’s memorial service, when she heard an angelic, flute-like noise blown by the wind. “I heard God,” she murmurs, and you understand how someone can be moved by such a simple sound. The best cuts on Sorceress are effortlessly golden, glimmering with pedal steel, tambourine, and the occasional sliver of saxophone. The swelling disco-folk lament “Infinite Scroll” glows like a desert sunset. But Williamson missteps when she adds too many embellishments: cicada chirps and a whipping sound on “Sorceress,” meant to emphasize the line “I can’t tame a lion,” or choir-like harmonies on “Ponies in Town” that feel as kitschy as Christmas at Hobby Lobby. And the album trails off with a set of slower, dustier compositions, like “Rosaries at the Border,” an immigration ballad with the well-meaning but florid Jesus rhetoric of a “thoughts and prayers” statement. But these are small sins in the grand scheme. Sorceress is a mature and freeing record, one that celebrates meager triumphs of womanhood even as it mourns a loss of innocence. “Should we give up on Tarot? Maybe it’s a waste of time,” Williamson wonders. Of course, the magic was never in the cards, but in piecing together your own faith.","The Texas singer-songwriter’s fourth album sounds older and wiser, casting her mystical interests as a foil to the bittersweet, ordinary moments that add up to earthly life.

Nehruvia: My Disregarded Thoughts,Bishop Nehru,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9b7c4a994f4606de32794/1:1/w_160/Nehruvia-My%20Disregarded%20Thoughts_Bishop%20Nehru.jpg,2020-05-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bishop-nehru-nehruvia-my-disregarded-thoughts/,Nehruvia LLC,"For a while, it seemed like Bishop Nehru was living the dream of every aspiring teenage rapper to ever sleep under an Illmatic poster. Before he’d turned 20, he’d: scored beats from super-looper 9th Wonder; signed with Mass Appeal records; and finished an entire tape with drunken uncle rhymer MF DOOM. Nas, somewhat ridiculously, dubbed the young, earnest rapper “the future of music.” But Nehru has spent the years since 2014’s NehruvianDOOM trying to both live up to these co-signs and play them down. He relishes the notoriety that comes with his lyrical miracle title and getting asked about being endorsed by hip-hop royalty, but he dreads the prospect of being pigeonholed as dated and dusty. His new album, Nehruvia: My Disregarded Thoughts, is an attempt to be all things to all people: conversative wordsmith, progressive curator, storyteller, anthem-maker, introspective entertainer. In his efforts to split the difference between bar god and pop rapper, he ends up proving he is neither. The album is mostly produced by Nehru with a few assists, including DJ Premier and DOOM. It woefully samples diet trap, jazz rap, and boom bap. Just as Elevators: Act I & II was haplessly divided into two parts, the Kaytranada-produced “Ascension” and the DOOM-produced “Free Falling,” My Disregarded Thoughts follows a similar model. “The Abyss” is supposed to represent the darker recesses of his mind; “The Escape,” his relentless optimism. The binary doesn’t provide any narrative focus, or explore a duality, the way Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded separated Nicki’s rap and pop instincts. Nehru is chasing a balance between his classicist nature and his Grammy ambitions—“still lyrical, still hip-hop, but with a way to make everyone relate to it on a grand level,” he told Clash. His gestures toward relatability aren’t subtle: He does some singing, flexes over some Maaly Raw beats, and even utters the words “too litty” through Auto-Tune. Every one of his attempts to show range demonstrate how limited he is. The bits of SoundCloud rap parody aren’t fooling anyone. “All of My Years” sounds like the TV movie version of a Chance the Rapper song. In all his straining efforts to show off the skill that landed him a Madvillian apprenticeship, he sounds lightyears away from city dwellers like MIKE and Medhane, meditative rhymers who do far more with less. Even the Premier-produced “Too Lost,” which should be right up his alley, sounds like a chore. He raps some as the voices inside his own head, which can be an effective device, but where a song like Kendrick Lamar’s “u” is tension-filled and gripping, Nehru’s struggle to personify his mounting anxiety doesn’t make any discernible impact. Too many of these thoughts truly warrant disregarding. On the intro, “Colder,” he laments going over the heads of the closed-minded masses before rapping this galaxy brain couplet: “They want me mad, ’cause cops drop us within a week/But it’s nothin’ new, it’s just now you can send a tweet.” Getting worked up over police violence is pointless, because racism is old hat, he asserts. Wake up sheeple! His songs about being alone and lost are circuitous, constantly reiterating how alone and lost he is without ever probing what he’s feeling or why. His would-be boy-king rants about ruling the rap world are like celebrating winning a race you’ve already been lapped in (on “Emperor”: “I know that I got the recipe/I mixed the grinding with destiny”). So much of this album is vacant and inexpressive. “My main muse and fuse is just life in general,” he declares on “Never Slow,” sounding like the corniest rapping anti-drug PSA. “Little Suzy (Be Okay),” his story of a homeless girl who becomes a drug addict, is all clunky exposition, no activity. There is more talk of thinking than actual thinking taking place. Nehru is often considered a technical rapper, but his bars are amateurish, cluttered, and inexact. His rapping can be so syntactically bizarre it sounds like it was written by a neural net. And this isn’t zany obfuscation like his metal-faced mentor; it’s a lack of precision. The raps aren’t hard to follow, per se, they’re just off. He forces phrases to fit his schemes instead of letting them unravel naturally. His flows are stilted, pushing to prove expertise he doesn’t have. And the bars that aren’t completely flavorless (“Been broke, my pockets had mad hope/Couldn’t buy a laugh like bad jokes/And they wait for falls like bad ropes”) are mind-numbingly lame. When given some thought, Bishop Nehru’s bifurcation of rap and pop feels woefully out of touch. Not just because the worlds of rap and pop seem more and more indistinguishable every day, but because even the most hardcore, bar-heavy posturing can reach a really wide audience—DaBaby owned 2019. Nehru doesn’t need to change tactics to become the rapper he seems confident he can be, he simply needs to be a more lucid writer and a more arresting performer. On Nehruvia: My Disregarded Thoughts, he’s convinced himself that the key to unlocking his rap career is broadening his horizons. But Bishop Nehru doesn’t need to branch out; he needs to go back to basics.","The New York rapper attempts to be all things to all people, but in his efforts to split the difference between bar god and pop rapper, he ends up proving he is neither.

græ,Moses Sumney,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb98004a994f4606de32768/1:1/w_160/gr%C3%A6%20(Part%20Two-%2013%20Two%20Dogs)_Moses%20Sumney.jpg,2020-05-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moses-sumney-grae/,Jagjaguwar,"Last December, Moses Sumney debuted a video for a love song called “Polly” from his newly announced double album græ. It was about as unadorned a video treatment as possible: Sitting in front of his computer’s camera in a black t-shirt, framed by a white wall and some guitars, Sumney stared into our eyes while the song played. He did not lip sync as usual. Instead, he took a few deep breaths and began to weep, tears running down his cheeks. Every so often he gulped for air, but otherwise he remained still, and he never broke eye contact. Halfway through the song, he brushed his tears with his palm, a radiant smile escaping, his eyes warming. As the song played, its chorus stripping back longing to its pulsing root—""see see see see me""—he seemed to pass through something elemental and emerge on the other side, transfigured. This facility for naked emotional connection is a kind of superpower, for good or ill, and Sumney has wielded his with grace. It’s the most significant of his many, many gifts, including his astonishing singing voice, which can plead like Prince or ascend to ANOHNI or Thom Yorke heights. He’s been overwhelming new converts ever since he opened for the R&B trio KING in 2013. He spent the next several years deciding what to do with the vast possibilities his talent afforded him. Sidestepping a cresting wave of industry attention better known for ruining careers than starting them, he waited until 2017 to release his starlit debut Aromanticism on the indie label Jagjaguwar. That album, though decked in swirling string and horn arrangements, was quiet, intimate, and burned with the intensity of a few glowing embers. The most significant element in the mix, after his voice, was silence. He seemed at rest, drawing in one great breath and waiting for the moment to exhale. There was more to come, the album hinted, more to say, but not yet. On græ, he lets out everything inside of him. The album is bigger, in every sense—longer, for starters, a 20-song double album that Sumney saw fit to release in two parts (the first half of the album appeared in February, the second arriving only this week.) Where Aromanticism was intimate and sleek, græ is rangy, sprawling, a riot of moods from lustful to angry to broken-hearted. He has summoned a battalion of collaborators, including production from Daniel Lopatin, basslines from Thundercat, saxophone from Shabaka Hutchings, horn parts from the English art-rock group Adult Jazz, writing credits from James Blake and author Michael Chabon. The camera lens zooms out from dewdrop to mountain range. Everything Sumney’s ever done or tried to do is here. “Virile,” the single that preceded “Polly,” is in many ways more representative of the album’s omnivorous ambition. In the video, Sumney convulses across the fog-swirled floor of a meat locker, his body as flawless as a marble statue while carcasses swing behind him on hooks. The lyrics are a withering send-up of the pointlessness of toxic masculinity in a world where the body inevitably turns “to dust and matter.” “Cheers to the patriarchs,” he sings bitterly over bludgeoning stabs of guitar from Noah Kardos-Fein of the NYC noise-rock duo Yvette and string arrangements from Rob Moose. Like Perfume Genius’ Mike Hadreas, Sumney mingles the cerebral and the carnal, eroticism and disgust, until the sensations are indistinguishable. He also shares Hadreas’ yearning to escape his own shell. On “Gagarin,” which interpolates a piece by the late Swedish pianist Esbjorn Svensson, Sumney sings in a pitched-down voice of wanting to “surrender my life to something bigger than me.” (The title is a likely reference to the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel to outer space.) Sumney's voice pours like tar onto the sound of a jazz piano and eventually the whole track turns ectoplasmic. The final minute sounds like the birth of a universe, with synths streaking like stardust before melting down amid the formless cries of Sumney’s digitally altered voice. The HD sheen of the mix—you can practically see the air tremble around the cymbal splashes—is a bold contrast with the formless abstraction of the music, like a private-press 1970s new age record remastered by Dr. Dre. Though he might not harbor their commercial aspirations, Sumney shares some of the precision and remove of auteur figures like Dre or Trent Reznor. He controls every aspect of his art, from his flyers to the art direction of his videos, and so his music arrives seemingly whole and untouched from a different universe. It also means his work can feel a little cool to the touch, even when his lyrics are strictly autobiographical (“I had two dogs in 2004” is a good representative lyric). His voice is an instrument of pure beauty, a falsetto so dazzling he could trace a cathedral with one syllable. It also tends to turn his words into color, mere vehicles for him to cast light and shadow against the wall. The music is gorgeous, an empty word that often points to the missing thing in Sumney’s work: The stray hair, the smudged line, the wrinkle on the outfit that proved somebody once wore it. Running through the album are the sampled vocals of the Nigerian-Ghanaian author Taiye Selasi, whose ruminations on multiplicity and identity glue together the album’s edges. “I really do insist that others recognize my inherent multiplicity, Selasi says on “also also also and and and.” “What I no longer do is take pains to explain it or defend.” The dreamy piece culminates in a manifesto of sorts: “I am aware of my multiplicity, and anyone wishing to meaningfully engage with me or my work must be, too.” These pieces probe the album’s underlying consideration: How to account for your whole self, not just the pieces that you feel comfortable offering to others. For Sumney, the most precious commodity is space—space to test out your voice when no one else hears it, space to struggle your way towards self-definition. Despite his emotional transparency, Sumney seems a little ambivalent about unbridled self-expression: “Bystander” is a wry ode to the wisdom of keeping your mouth shut. “Honesty is the most moral way/But morality is grey,” he observes, in one of the album’s most tenderly sung lines. The most powerful moments on græ examine the distance between this wariness and the loneliness it produces. “I am not at peace with dying alone/But I am not at war either,” he sings on “Neither/Nor,” a negation that might be Sumney’s most resounding statement of self. His music is unique in the chilly way it yearns for warmth; he can often be coy, flirtatious, beseeching. “Sometimes I want to kiss my friends/You don’t want that…do ya?/You just want someone to listen to ya/Who ain’t tryna screw ya,” he croons on “In Bloom.” The stacked harmony vocals bear down on the line “Sometimes I want to kiss my friends,” and it proves as indelible, and maybe more meaningful, than his ideas about patriarchy or creative sovereignty. For all of græ’s high points, for all the elasticity of its ambition, Sumney’s most exalted work still happens at the emotional distance of the “Polly” video. “Polly,” like all of Sumney’s most devastating and resonant music, exists only by the grace of his calloused hands fingerpicking a simple pattern and his voice, which does more to generate cosmos than all the prodigious talents on græ combined. The album highlights—lullabies like “Lucky Me” or “Me In 20 Years”— come from a place where Sumney often finds himself: his glittering voice, resplendent and alone, aching in solitude. This is the range of the coffeehouse whisper, his hand atop yours on the table. This is still where we feel him most. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.","The sprawling second album from the crystal-voiced singer-songwriter is a riot of moods. Moses Sumney widens the scope of his work and takes full account of his self, warts and all.

One and Only,Sheff G,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9b66b8b87698b3b0b9dfe/1:1/w_160/One%20and%20Only_Sheff%20G.jpg,2020-05-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sheff-g-one-and-only/,Winners CircleEMPIRE,"Like most successful New York rappers from the last few years, Sheff G broke out by looking beyond New York. A pioneer of Brooklyn drill and one of its most technically gifted lyricists, he drew heavily from the implosive ferocity of Chicago street rap while adopting the husky patois of so many UK drill rappers. Even the music was imported: His 2017 street hit “No Suburban” was produced by Londoner AXL Beats, part of a fleet of British producers whose unflinchingly tense beats shaped the sound of Brooklyn drill. Sheff G’s new album One and Only arrives at a precarious moment for that scene. Pop Smoke, Brooklyn drill's biggest star, was killed in a home invasion in February. Weeks later, the coronavirus put the city on lockdown, closing the clubs where this music is shared and market-tested for the foreseeable future. And while Sheff G is still a star in his borough, his belated debut The Unluccy Luccy Kid landed last fall without much hype or impact. It was fine, but the ideas already felt stale, not worthy of a scene leader. One and Only doesn’t really feel like an event either, but this time that’s by design. It’s mellower and more muted than its predecessor, breaking from the maximalist bluster of conventional Brooklyn drill in favor of more nuanced shadings. Sheff G has settled on a producer closer to home, New Jersey native Great John, who crafts mood pieces from little more than hard snares and spectral traces of guitar—a distinct signature at a time when drill’s other architects are leaning hard on pianos. Great John isn’t an elite producer, at least not yet, but he understands how to frame to Sheff G’s nimble, cavernous baritone. It's rare to hear such a weighty voice glide so gracefully. The sparse accompaniments do little to tame Sheff G’s innate rowdiness—“Moody” may be his most deliriously sticky single yet, while “Lil Big Bro Shit” plays up his feral snarl—but they lend an introverted energy that matches the moment. Whether by fluke or intuition, Sheff G’s timing is impeccable: With the clubs empty, he released a headphones album. One and Only features a sequel to “No Suburban,” which under different circumstances might feel desperate—it's rarely a good look when a rapper tries to rehash a three-year-old hit. Instead of repeating the original’s formula, though, Sheff G uses “No Suburban Pt. 2” to highlight his evolution. The new track is as sparse as the original was boisterous. Stripped of its predecessor’s dramatic church bells and cacophonous embellishments, all that’s left is a husk, but Sheff G navigates it like a gymnast, his nimble voice spiraling over and under the beat at alternating tempos. He can really rap. Sometimes it doesn’t take much more than that.","The boisterous rapper’s latest is mellower and more muted than its predecessor, breaking from the maximalist bluster of conventional Brooklyn drill.

State Of Emergency,Lil Tjay,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb97898e5423e84f420e76a/1:1/w_160/State%20Of%20Emergency_Lil%20Tjay.jpg,2020-05-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-tjay-state-of-emergency/,Columbia,"The cover of Lil Tjay’s latest album features a portrait of the rapper wandering an empty New York street, mask fitted to his face, crows eerily circling overhead, everything tinted into an unnatural shade of blue. But instead of a treatise for  “these times,” State of Emergency remains focused on more historic issues. On opener “Ice Cold,” the South Bronx rapper mentions the global pandemic only to alley-oop a criticism of the education system—“JT my aroma, city got Corona/Sad to say I know like just two niggas with diplomas.” As it turns out, Tjay is more interested in addressing the NYC murder rate than the rate of infection. By the time guest rapper Sleepy Hallow shows up on “Wet Em Up Pt.2” to drop a bar like, “No Corona, boy, I’m too sick,” it’s outlandishly clear that this isn’t going to be a probing examination of this terrifying new horror. Instead, State of Emergency is an act of defiance as the 19-year-old Tjay and a supporting cast of local rappers pledge love and loyalty to their home soil. On “My City,” Tjay gives thanks for his recent success while remembering the hardships and incarceration that color his origin story. On “City on My Back,” he teams up Jay Critch—a rapper who always seems to be on the cusp of a breakthrough—to make specious assertions like, “We put the city on the map.” Sure, but the underlying message of State of Emergency is clear: New York rap is going nowhere. Some traditionalists will simply never take to Tjay’s voice. Chirping, tuneful, unorthodox, it can resemble an off-key American Idol contestant or his most apparent forefather, Young Thug. There are times when his vocals fly too close to the sun: The repetitive, high-pitched hook of “Shoot For The Stars” borders on abrasive. But when he hits the sweet spot, Tjay’s vocals offer a smooth counterpoint to some of the huskier Brooklyn drill rappers in his orbit. Perhaps of most consequence here is “Zoo York,” featuring Pop Smoke, tragically shot dead earlier this year. The pair went together like steak and shakes—Smoke’s fire iron vocals contrasting Tjay’s pleasing pop-rap. “Zoo York” is diluted by Fivio Foreign, an associate who struggles to keep up, but over a beat that carries all the familiar Brooklyn drill hallmarks—engulfing womp-womp bassline, foggy keys, general sense of peril—it reasserts the lost potential of a Pop-Tjay team-up full-length record to be a catastrophe for the culture. Lil Tjay will probably better albums than this. State of Emergency is too thin at just 22-minutes, too hastily assembled, too stuffed with guests that take attention away from the star. But with a healthy number of his peers committed to pulling New York rap into strange new terrain, Tjay refreshes his commitment to represent his city—and reminds us that the wounded neighborhoods aren’t going to disappear and, eventually, everything will be OK.","Across a mostly fun, guest-filled 22 minutes, the young New York rapper does what needs to be done and puts on for his city.

Josey in Space,Josey Rebelle,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9c1bca994f4606de3279b/1:1/w_160/Josey%20in%20Space_Josey%20Rebelle.jpg,2020-05-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/josey-rebelle-josey-in-space/,Beats in Space,"Dance music is steeped in mythology. The U.S. has Chicago, Detroit, Frankie Knuckles, the Belleville Three, Ron Hardy, Larry Heard, and countless tales of young artists—many of them black, brown, and/or queer—cooking up house, techno, electro, and other genres that would go on to transform dancefloors around the globe. Over in the UK, there’s a similar reverence for the country’s so-called “hardcore continuum,” which has roots in imported Caribbean soundsystem culture and runs through hardcore, jungle, drum’n’bass, garage, grime, dubstep, and a myriad of other low-end-heavy dancefloor sounds. There are innumerable points of overlap between these two spheres, and the exchange has gone both ways. In 1988, early house music from the U.S. helped inspire UK rave culture and the country’s Second Summer of Love. Twenty-five years later, Chicago producer DJ Rashad reinvigorated the distinctly American sound of footwork by injecting it with UK jungle rhythms. There’s an ongoing dialogue, particularly among black artists, yet U.S. and UK dance music are often portrayed as completely separate worlds, parallel entities rather than two pieces of a larger conversation. Perhaps Josey Rebelle can help change the narrative. A North London native with Caribbean roots, she started DJing at age 13, became a hardcore and jungle fanatic before she’d even finished high school, and is now arguably best known for her work on seminal radio station Rinse FM, where she’s been on the air since 2011. In many ways, her biography is quintessentially British, but her artistic vision extends well beyond the borders of the UK. Josey in Space is Rebelle’s first official mix album—and only the second installment of the Beats in Space-curated mix series, following last year’s excellent Powder in Space—and it arrives just months after she was awarded BBC Radio 1’s Essential Mix of the Year and subsequently landed on the cover of DJ Mag. DJing is her calling card—Rebelle doesn’t produce—and she’s developed a reputation as an eclectic, highly knowledgeable selector who’s just as comfortable playing moody jazz, blues, and soul as she is dropping blistering acid and thundering drum’n’ bass. Although she reins that in slightly on Josey in Space, the mix is a far cry from the rigid genre exercises that many official mix series tend to offer. It’s telling that so much of the Josey in Space tracklist is populated by black artists, British and American alike. Midwestern house veterans like Andrés, Hieroglyphic Being, and Reggie Dokes sit alongside experimental producer Loraine James and bass upstart Afrodeutsche. Rebelle may not be an overtly political artist—having grown up in a community whose relationships with police and authority were fraught and full of mistrust, she describes herself as “political by default”—but this mix is very much rooted in notions of blackness, a point that’s underscored by early selection “I Dream So Loud,” in which Bay Area poets Tenesha the Wordsmith and Daniel B. Summerhill riff on social justice and identity while referencing Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and a litany of horrors that have been visited upon black Americans over the years. From there, Rebelle lets the music do the talking. The bubbling acid of Fotomachine’s “BBoy”—one of a handful of new tracks exclusive to Josey in Space—kicks off an extended excursion through a variety of drum-machine workouts, including a couple of siren-filled hardcore screamers from 1991. Along the way are grotty stormers, wiggly house cuts, and deep house strutters (like Nwachukwu’s remix of Uschi Classen’s “Open Your Eyes,” a clear standout that features the iconic voice of Chicago house legend Robert Owens). Josey in Space runs nearly 72 minutes, and though the energy level peaks around the 40-minute mark with Rum & Black’s bonkers “Zombies at Dawn,” it’s during the mix’s final half hour that Rebelle flexes the breadth of her repertoire. Seamlessly moving between genres, moods, and eras, she weaves together catwalk-ready sass, dubby broken beat, swirly Afro-Latin rhythms, Balearic bliss, soulful drum’n’bass, and heads-down hip-hop. On paper, that sort of journey sounds like a jarring, confusing mess, but in Rebelle’s hands, it’s a gloriously winding road, a soul-drenched comedown after a wild bit of raving. As a DJ, Rebelle is a storyteller, and while Josey in Space is certainly good for a dance, it goes significantly deeper than the average mix. It’s a story of black excellence and black struggle, of endless creativity and innovation in the face of systemic and societal aggression and discrimination. That story transcends borders, and is also responsible for revolutionizing dance music in the U.S., UK, and beyond. It’s a different sort of dance music mythology, and with artists like Rebelle at the helm, a better and more accurate one.","Connecting disparate styles, eras, and moods, the London DJ’s mix tells a story of black dance music from both sides of the Atlantic, an ongoing dialogue that transcends genres and borders.

Reunions,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb979df8b87698b3b0b9d96/1:1/w_160/Reunions_Jason%20Isbell%20and%20the%20400%20Unit.jpg,2020-05-14 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit-reunions/,Southeastern,"The “rigorous honesty” required in recovery programs is a tenet that Jason Isbell has taken to heart. Candor has been at the core of Isbell ever since 2013’s Southeastern, the record he released in the wake of his newfound sobriety and his marriage to Amanda Shires. Seven years and three albums later, sobriety remains central to Isbell’s public image, as does his union with Shires, with whom he had a daughter. Isbell doesn’t shy away from probing personal questions when he sits for an interview, a habit that may be a fruitful part of his recovery but nevertheless can give his songs the appearance of being straight reflections of his personal life. Reunions, the fourth album he’s written and recorded since getting sober, is indeed filled with images that seem to mirror the personal life he’s talked about in public. Romances are stable but not without their struggles; characters will themselves to accept their fears; whenever a child appears it’s a girl, not a boy. Leading up to the album’s release, Isbell upped the ante by admitting to the New York Times that its creation was fraught with tension, stemming from the pressure to deliver another strong album after making, in his own words to GQ, “three good records in a row.” Buckling under his self-imposed standards, he closed himself off from Shires, who in addition to her solo career and her role in Americana supergroup the Highwomen plays fiddle in the 400 Unit, the backing band Isbell founded in 2009 who have shared album credits with the singer-songwriter since 2017’s The Nashville Sound. None of this agitation can be heard on Reunions. The album moves steadily and carefully, lingering on the conflicted emotions conjured by Isbell’s finely-etched tales and the band’s elegant understatement. Working once again with Dave Cobb, who has produced every one of his records since Southeastern, Isbell made a conscious effort to push the 400 Unit outside their comfort zone. What they wound up with is not with an album that blares—nothing rocks with the abandon of “Cumberland Gap,” a galvanizing number from The Nashville Sound—but one that’s so full of texture it nearly feels painted on a canvas. Waves of cool synthesizers pulsate underneath “Only Children,” whose mournful verses are accented by economical single-string runs. “Dreamsicle” unfurls with unhurried attention to detail, its bittersweet childhood memories gaining poignance as each chorus seems to be delivered with a sadder sigh. The 400 Unit can still roar—Isbell seems to steel his spine on “Be Afraid” because his group sounds tougher than their singer—but Reunions gains strength through the band’s collective interplay. That communal spirit is felt throughout, adding a counterpoint to a collection of songs where Isbell ponders the kinds of minor, numbing regrets that can metastasize into self-inflicted wounds. “What Have I Done to Help” provides a keynote of sorts, its narrator gaining no comfort in his successes because he can’t shake the notion they’re selfish achievements. Nearly every successive song proves this doubt untrue, as Isbell focuses on humans striving to connect and largely succeed in spite of their fumbling. Not every one of Isbell’s characters gives into their better nature. The narrator of “River” is tormented by his misdeeds, but the song plays like a guidepost for the rest of the record, illustrating how Isbell favors forgiveness over darkness. The closing triptych of “St. Peter’s Autograph,” “It Gets Easier,” and “Letting You Go” emphasizes his inclination toward empathy, finding grace in love for others. “St. Peter’s Autograph” is the simplest, sparest song on Reunions, an elegy for the departed friend of a loved one; it’s about giving another person the space to grieve on their own terms. Where “St. Peter’s Autograph” is haunted by loss, “Letting You Go” tells the tale of a father finally able to “see through the great fog of loneliness” by placing his daughter’s needs over his own. Between these two songs is “It Gets Easier,” which is where the heart of Reunions lies. It could be seen as an act of fellowship for fellow recovering alcoholics or Isbell could be singing directly to himself: “Last night I dreamed I’d been drinking,” he sings, “I had one glass of wine/I woke up feeling fine/That’s how I knew it was a dream.” It’s a lyric that anticipates a confession Isbell made to the New York Times, where he cops to drinking Listerine as if it was a shot of whiskey. He told Shires he held himself accountable in public, actions that jibe the song’s bemused, self-aware inventory of longings for substances that are now forbidden but never forgotten. Reunions is not pure autobiography or a series of confessions to be admired for their bloodletting. Attempts to parse the details in any particular song will uncover how Isbell departs from his own history. Like all great songwriters, he uses his life as a springboard toward a hyper-reality that reveals truths a mere diary entry could not. His candor can sometimes obscure this essential fact, but his forthrightness underscores the emotional clarity of Reunions: The music wouldn’t resonate so richly if he wasn’t able to access his truth as vividly in song as he does in the press.","The alt-country singer-songwriter’s new album moves steadily and carefully, lingering on the conflicted emotions of his finely-etched tales and the band’s textured, elegant understatement.

ORCORARA 2010,Elysia Crampton,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9723bd7b4ffbd2650957f/1:1/w_160/Orcorara%202010_Elysia%20Crampton.jpg,2020-05-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elysia-crampton-orcorara-2010/,Pan,"For thousands of years, the Sierra Nevada mountains regularly pulsed with wildfires. Lit by indigenous tribes like the Yurok and the Karuk, these controlled burns kept local ecosystems thriving, clearing weeds and detritus that, if left to accumulate, could fuel devastating infernos. When the state of California instituted fire control measures in the early 20th century, that kindling began to build up. Dried out by global warming, the state’s forests have succumbed to hellish blazes in the past few years, many of which have been fought by prison laborers making less than minimum wage alongside trained firefighters. It’s a phenomenon that nearly condenses the myriad horrors of the contemporary United States into a single scene: a forest on fire, thrown out of rhythm by centuries of colonialism, hosed down by people caught in the gears of the prison industrial complex. Elysia Crampton, the American Indian producer whose experimental electronic music ranks among the most singular and idiosyncratic of the past decade, dedicates her latest full-length release to Paul Sousa, a man “who while incarcerated, worked years as an inmate firefighter across the Sierra Nevada of California.” This image hangs over ORCORARA 2010, which was originally released as the soundtrack to an installation Crampton debuted at the Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement 2018. It was first meant to be heard in a dark room throbbing with diffuse light, an environment where sound overwhelms the senses and the mind can fall into a trance state. As an album, ORCORARA 2010 calls back to that method of listening. Its slow, sparse gestures reward patient attention with delicate, enveloping beauty. On Crampton’s tight, condensed self-titled album from 2018, voices flitted in and out like stray transmissions from distant broadcast towers. Here, the voice emerges as a central instrument by way of a handful of guests. Jeremy Rojas layers a spoken-word performance atop several piano-driven tracks that set the record’s oblique narratives in motion, while the New York-based singers Embaci and Shannon Funchess appear at two of the album’s high points. Embaci’s classically trained voice darts between tangled acoustic guitars, droning synthesizers, and owl calls on “Grove,” a song whose placidity belies a gut-deep restlessness. Twin guitar lines strobe in and out of sync, and her voice lifts away from the confusion, gliding and searching. Later, Light Asylum’s Funchess, whose unmistakable voice graced the Knife’s 2013 album Shaking the Habitual, makes an earthshaking appearance on “Crucifixion,” a slowly building piece that increasingly sounds like it’s on the verge of toppling. There’s no steady beat to ground her stirring vibrato, just a thicket of quavering instruments, digital and physical, that pulse until a frenetic piano and drum breakdown ushers her out. The album’s spoken-word segments return continually to the concept of twilight, a charged and liminal state where daylight ebbs away and the clean lines between seen objects tend to blur. “I confused you with the twilight/Confusing myself with you,” says guest vocalist Fanny Pankara Chuquimia on the tranquil meditation “Crest.” In this dusk, boundaries between people—between the self and the other, the “I” and the “you”—soften. Thoughts and desires become harder to constrain inside a single body. Feeling bleeds from skin to skin, and the individual dissolves into the environment. Full of slippage and lacunae, whipping itself from moment to moment and then fading, ORCORARA 2010 is so absorbing as to make the world outside it seem bizarre, and in this it has political power: There are a great many systems of harm that survive on habit. Enough people have accepted that it is normal to lock others away in cages and send them out to fight fires when the fires get out of hand. Enough people agree upon the many acts of violence sustaining this and other countries that the atrocity is naturalized, a distant but constant pillar of a certain way of life. These systems are bigger than any one person and yet sustain themselves on individuals networked in covert agreement, people who act as porous cells for mass behavior. What would it take to agree on something else—something less painful, where fewer of us die? In its hypnotic and generative confusion, ORCORARA 2010 bores open a portal to a life hiding just beyond this one.","Dedicated to an incarcerated man who spent years fighting wildfires in California’s Sierra Nevada, Crampton’s latest album confronts the systems of oppression hidden in plain sight.

Just Cause Y’all Waited 2,Lil Durk,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9b4bfcaddbe3e3b13a53f/1:1/w_160/Just%20Cause%20Y'all%20Waited%202_Lil%20Durk.jpg,2020-05-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-durk-just-cause-yall-waited-2/,Alamo,"Who is going to save Lil Durk’s soul? There’s barely a moment on Just Cause Y’all Waited 2 where the drill veteran doesn’t sound on the verge of tears, ready to collapse in the recording booth, his voice trembling with pain. Nobody who has been paying attention will be surprised: Durk has been broadcasting an unvarnished depiction of South Side Chicago communities since around the time of Obama’s first presidential campaign. These are now areas of the city devastated by coronavirus—early reports revealed that black Chicagoans account for more than 70 percent of deaths from the virus, despite making up 30 percent of the population—and most likely to bear the brunt of prolonged economic recession. In this backdrop comes the latest tape from a man burdened for far too long, his spirit finally ready to rupture under the weight of an unjust world. You can forget about finding a sense of catharsis on Just Cause Y’all Waited 2; Durk refuses to fill his music with false hope or easy answers. Never mind that he claims to be based out of Atlanta these days—his loyalty is to the people of Chi-Town. (Just last month he showed up at Rush University Medical Centre to help deliver meals to frontline workers.) Durk is not the most famous voice in rap to emerge from his hometown, but he’s probably the most detailed, the most compassionate, in his vision. In this latest study of the city, he walks the line between reporter and preacher, gangster and citizen. The ghosts of lost comrades circle Durk’s music, rendering almost every cut sorrowful and spectral. In his hands, Auto-Tune has a bled-dry beauty; over the piano chords of “All Love,” his digitized voice accentuates the erosion of his spirit. Far from a one-note vocalist, he drops the effect on “248.” Durk has never been particularly interested in virtuosity for its own sake, and here he slides into a conversational style, sounding like he’s slumping back in a chair, recollecting for his biographer. The elephant in the room doesn’t go unaddressed. About a year ago, Durk Banks handed himself over to authorities after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a February 2019 shooting outside of Atlanta restaurant the Varsity. (Since he was granted bond, some countries have refused him entry to perform shows.) “Turn Myself In” was released shortly before he handed himself over to cops, so its inclusion here a whole year later feels pointed as Durk laments the situation, calls the accusation “false,” and thanks Chance the Rapper for helping to keep his spirits up. It’s not unreasonable to attribute some of the tape’s sense of suffering to the case ostensibly being unresolved. When the atmosphere becomes suffocating, guest rappers help release the tension. “3 Headed Goat” lives up to its audacious billing as Durk amalgamates with rising Chicago star Polo G and ATL’s Lil Baby. On “Chiraq Demons,” he recruits G Herbo for a double dose of classic drill—all horror movie piano keys, crushing drums, and ample menace. Just Cause Y’all Waited 2 does have setbacks. The chorus to the unremarkable “Gucci” is derivative of every hook that’s been formed around the luxury fashion brand’s name. And there’s no good reasoning for the inclusion of “Trifling Hoes,” an unnecessary shot of misogyny. It’s out of step with the rest of Just Cause Y’all Waited 2, a set that transforms Durk’s pain into one of his most emotionally potent tapes ever, and confirms what Chicago has known for ages: If you seek to understand the city in the 21st century, listen to Lil Durk.","On his latest sorrowful dispatch, the drill veteran walks the line between reporter and preacher, gangster and citizen.

Good Intentions,Nav,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb97752a994f4606de32763/1:1/w_160/Good%20Intentions_Nav.jpg,2020-05-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nav-good-intentions/,XORepublic,"Nav didn’t like his first album, either. He claims he’s learned now, that he’s self-aware—in the trailer for his new album, he announced with a straight face that he’d made a “vision board.” There are hints of this fledgling growth throughout Good Intentions. Adjusting for expectations, this is his best album yet, one in which he makes half-hearted stabs at “maturity” and occasionally tries to be in on the joke. There’s still plenty of standard Nav fare. “Turks,” the lead single, is a stale, neon attempt at a Wheezy banger. “No Debate” is diet trap music anchored in plodding 808s. Throughout, it’s unclear whether Nav is trying to be funny or if his flexes are just too odd and specific to land. He clarifies that he rummages through his fridge for lean, not Sunny D. He invites a woman to quarantine with him, clad in all designer. “I’m part of the money-making committee,” he announces on “My Business,” a clunky boast that highlights his tendency to write garbled work-arounds of generic rap tropes. Nav repeats the same ideas over and over again—he likes drugs, he doesn’t trust women, look at all his money. When he lurches towards something like maturity, it’s a reprieve from both our boredom and his. This mostly takes the form of limp apologies, confessions that wither by the time he reaches the chorus. “I act the way you see on purpose,” he admits on “She Hurtin,” a quasi-love song where Nav transparently uses a new girlfriend to make an ex jealous. He moans about having “too many options” for lovers on the forgettable “Did You Wrong.” He proves incapable of discussing women without talking about what he can buy them, or, horrifyingly, how he wants to procreate (“If I come inside, she got a king inside her belly,” he warbles, not 30 seconds into the album). The lens is equally narrow when he turns it on himself; in “Brown Boy,” a song weird enough to almost be interesting, he sings about himself from the perspective of a third-person observer, whining about the size of his rings and how his music “feels like drugs.” (He pulled the same trick on 2017’s “Did You See Nav,” and he released another song called “Brown Boy” in 2014.) The apex of his flexing is that he’s friends with Young Thug, who pops up on the album twice and easily overshadows him. The most fun moments on the album are the ones where Nav gets out of the way. On “My Business,” he’s content to mumble occasionally in the background while Future gallops over the beat for a full minute. Lil Uzi Vert salvages “Status” with a vibrant verse that distracts from Nav rhyming “caught caught caught” with “rocks rocks rocks.” It’s genuinely shocking when the late Pop Smoke appears, his gravelly voice slower and softer than we’ve heard before; Nav wastes the opportunity by rhyming about wearing mink to go ice skating. Travis Scott appears only briefly, and his AutoTune-slathered influence seems to have waned. Instead, Nav tries to imitate his executive producer and label owner The Weeknd, reducing Abel Tesfaye’s haunted gloom to generic darkness. “Saint Laurentt,” whose extra “t”s seems intended to avoid confusion with the better Wale song, is a corroded, moody heartbreak track, with pitched-down vocals to convey the emotion Nav’s voice can’t carry. He references addiction throughout the album, but uses the glut of pills and bottles more to create an aesthetic than to consider their implications. “When I get depressed, no one can help me,” he squeaks on “Overdose.” “Sometimes I hope I overdose.” It’s a disturbing admission, one that seems to crystalize the sulking despondency that fueled his earlier music, but Nav doesn’t go deeper. The record ends on “Proud of Me?” a diatribe presumably aimed at people who comment on his social media posts. “I just want to fulfill my dreams,” he chirps, achingly earnest. For a 30-year-old rapper who only recently stopped complaining about his teachers, any semblance of self-actualization seems like growth. But intentions alone aren’t always enough.","Rap’s perennial kid brother makes his best album yet—adjusting for expectations.

Descendants of Cain,Ka,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5d7aae5423e84f420e651/1:1/w_160/Descendants%20of%20Cain_Ka.jpeg,2020-05-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ka-descendants-of-cain/,Iron Works,"Ka raps as if he’s pulled you into the hallway to talk business. His vocals are often hushed but always forceful, like he’s speaking in a stage whisper and the stage is collapsing. The beats he raps on, his own productions or sourced from a tight circle of collaborators, do away with nearly all extraneous elements—and often with elements that no one would consider “extraneous,” like drums. There are complicated lyrical passages, but some of Ka’s phrasing is disarmingly simple: He’ll say he “saw too much to have blind faith,” or describe the Brownsville, Brooklyn neighborhood of his youth as “the bottom” where “all the tops is slung.” It’s this drive toward the essential that makes Ka’s music singular. He cuts away the sinew from each line, leaving vivid detail and bits of moral code that he will then jam against one another, building a strange latticework of jagged, interlocking bits that he can use to explain or disorient as he sees fit. Descendants of Cain is the sixth album Kaseem Ryan has released since 2012. Before then, he had taken a job with the New York Fire Department and lost touch with music. But the Ka that re-emerged with 2012’s rewardingly insular Grief Pedigree was inspired, and in the years since, he’s released a string of LPs that has confirmed him as one of the preeminent stylists of his generation. (Although on the fringes in many ways, Ka was big enough by 2016 to be smeared on the front page of the New York Post for his lyrics critical of police.) There are no giant leaps or sharp left turns in his repertoire; there are grooves worn deeper and deeper, facades stripped away. There have been moments when this near-tunnel vision has seemed limiting; 2018’s Orpheus vs. the Sirens, a collaboration with the Los Angeles producer Animoss under the name Hermit and the Recluse, is an expertly made record that at times feels like the annual Ka album, assembled from a trusty blueprint. Cain, by contrast, exhilarates. Where Orpheus’ Greek-myth motif was an attempt to look at the personal and spiritual struggles Ka often writes about from an abstracted angle, the Biblical story of Cain and his offspring here evokes unshakable feelings about what it means to be damned, what’s learned versus what’s in your blood, and whether clean hands are a luxury everyone can afford. It includes some of the most striking writing of Ka’s career—the knottier verses and the blunter ones, too—and is utterly immersive, whole lifetimes of fear and pain and death and regeneration condensed into 33 minutes. The Biblical allusions on Cain make the Brooklyn of Ka's memory sound like a fallow land not expected to produce survivors. On “Patron Saints,” he strings simple threads into a complex web of lepers and protectors from his formative years: the tycoons who “moved in vests,” the caregivers who “stole everything we needed.” No one here would be without blame in the eyes of the NYPD, but nearly everyone is daring and principled in his or her own way. “Our yogis did stretches upstate,” he raps, “I saw Lancelots at round tables cutting eighths.” At the song’s end, he does away with the entendre: “Our heroes sold heroin.” That frankness serves Ka well throughout Cain. The penultimate song, “Old Justice,” opens, simply, “We was living in the living room.” But other tracks move slyly from childhood games to concealed weaponry. See “Unto the Dust,” where Ka remembers that while: ...y’all played the dozens
My favorite cousins spent they youth in prisons
They names known, came home
Now the house got two religions
‘Peace be with you,’ ‘Wa’Alaikum-Salaam’
?Make sure that piece be with you, laced in your palm. It’s that type of advice—grave but necessary—that guides Ka through one-half of the stories remembered here, and is dispensed by him in the other. Toward the end of “Saints,” he raps about his father shooting a man, then tossing him the gun to dispose of. “He knew how he grew me,” Ka raps, as he flees the scene to deny prosecutors “Exhibit A.” “I was raised to age a few years in a day.” Cain is a dynamic listen, despite relying on a consistent sound palate: somber pianos, strings, all made to sound like the denouement of a Western you catch on cable at 3 a.m. The exception is the dazzlingly weird beat for “P.R.A.Y.,” which sounds as if a broken elevator’s doors are being pried apart in stereo. Ka has never deployed a wide arsenal of flows or vocal tones; instead of seeming flat, his affectless voice gives the impression of seriousness, of persistence. This is most rewarding on the closing song, “I Love (Mimi, Moms, Kev),” where he writes to his wife, mother, and late friend with a touching vulnerability, but delivers the words with a steely remove, as if he has to gird himself to get through each verse in one piece. For all the peril of Cain—walks to subway stops that have to be chaperoned, summers full of murder that just won’t end—it retains a strange optimism, in the notion that principled living is its own salvation. It is also something of a capstone on the rapper’s career. The album, and Ka’s entire creative project, is best summed up by the chorus on “Land of Nod.” “You can tell I’m in fact a native,” he raps, “I live this vivid shit—I ain’t that creative.” This is the great trick of Ka’s music: For all the technical wizardry, the innovation in writing style and sound design, he’s made his work seem like the natural, insuppressible product of the blocks that raised him.","The Brooklyn rapper moves carefully between knotty verses and blunt lines to make some of the most immersive and exhilarating songs of his career.

Slime&B,Chris BrownYoung Thug,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5d8bd7408de6d52fb5c81/1:1/w_160/Slime&B_Chris%20Brown%20and%20Young%20Thug.jpg,2020-05-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chris-brown-young-thug-slimeandb/,RCA,"Of the many strange pop-culture artifacts to emerge from quarantine, a collaboration between Young Thug and Chris Brown probably falls higher on the plausibility index than Beyoncé shouting out OnlyFans or the name X Æ A-12, but their new mixtape, Slime&B, still feels beyond explanation. It’s hard to imagine it existing in a world less dystopian than the one we’re in now. The title implies a meeting of the minds and a marrying of their styles, yet this is a clear mismatch. Brown, while still commercially viable, has been slumping creatively. Thug is at the height of his success and near the peak of his powers. To work with Brown, Thug must sacrifice a ton of what makes him special and engaging. Why go from So Much Fun to so little? Thug is no stranger to this kind of project. On Rich Gang Tha Tour, Part 1, he and Rich Homie Quan formed an unlikely yin-yang duo that seemed linked even when unyoked, and even though he often lacks chemistry with frenemy Future, their collaborative tape, Super Slimey, was still like watching two sluggers at a home run derby bat flipping every time they go yard. They were two of rap’s preeminent talents in their primes, independent but together. Young Thug teaming with Chris Brown doesn’t have the same upside. Brown is a deposed R&B king-turned-heel whose continued hitmaking is offset by his inability to grow or show restraint, in his music or in his life. He is an incompatible, and in some cases unwelcome, partner for rap’s mischievous trickster god—indeed, someone’s already made a version where he is entirely cut out of the tape. The two of them don’t share any meaningful connection, and they mostly come across as self-indulgent. Young Thug, for his part, sounds jaded and disengaged. Roping Thug into Chris Brown’s world of frictionless songcraft limits the possibilities for what the rapper can do; he’s rarely seemed as bored as he does on “Trap Back.” Thug says he recorded his verses in a single day; honestly, it sounds like it. (He was spotted shooting hoops with Brown the day before they announced the tape.) He is so prolific and explosive that it’s easy to imagine a lot of his best rapping happening like this, but his verses and hooks here are aimless in an idle sort of way. These are “nothing else to do” bars without real inspiration. Even if the point of this project is simply to kill time, listening shouldn’t feel like a waste of time. Nor does his proximity to Brown push him to deliver on his singing. When Thug is locked in, as on the Swae Lee duet “Offshore,” he sounds like he could make all the chairs swivel on The Voice or pull a T-Pain at the Tiny Desk moment. But his performances here are just flat and spiritless, paling in comparison to the no-holds-barred crooning of his “singing album” Beautiful Thugger Girls. These two just don’t have any chemistry at all; on “She Bumped Her Head,” Brown sounds like he’s encroaching on Thug and Gunna’s space, trying to squeeze himself into a role likely meant for Lil Baby. Thug and Brown find common ground in the cut-the-line VIP lifestyles they lead, how that celebrity gets them laid (often), and the nature of their stroke games (always great, apparently). But there aren’t many songs that really sell the Playboy Mansion debauchery they’re aspiring to. Songs about being too wasted (“Undrunk”) and about not being wasted enough (“No Such Thing”) cancel out. And after half an album of womanizing, Chris Brown comes up for air just long enough to disavow the entire thing: “Poppin’ bottles in the club/Fuckin’ models, doin’ drugs/And I can’t do this anymore/I feel like an animal,” he cries. Granted, he does so on his knees trying to win a woman back, but still, it is a severe U-turn. Young Thug, missing the point entirely, plays the song differently, fully coveting the way of life that Brown is questioning. Neither of them seems to be paying any attention, so why should we?","Rap’s trickster god and R&B’s least tolerable person collaborate on a mixtape with no discernible upside.

Drop 6 EP,Little Simz,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb97c028b87698b3b0b9d99/1:1/w_160/Drop%206%20EP_Little%20Simz.jpg,2020-05-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/little-simz-drop-6-ep/,Age 101,"Little Simz punctuated 2014 and 2015 with her Drops series: spontaneous, carefree mixtapes that established her as a curious and brave voice in UK rap. She used these Drops to open up with diaristic verses and work freely with collaborators from across the spectrum. Since releasing the last Drop in December 2015, she’s reached new heights. Her third album, 2019’s acclaimed GREY Area, was her brassiest, most daring, and most profound work yet. But this year, finding herself locked down in London, where she lives alone, Simbi Ajikawo decided to go back to her roots with Drop 6: a gloomy meditation that proves she’s still spontaneous and self-reliant, if no longer carefree. Simz retains the confidence of GREY Area, opening the EP with an urgent running bassline and a lyric aligning herself with “Lauryn Hill back in the ’90s” (a comparison that has been bestowed upon her many times before). But this time, between the stripped-down drums and the metallic echo that haunts much of the record, a palpable feeling of loneliness surrounds her self-empowerment. As the EP loosens its pace, and more anxious thoughts creep into its fabric, you get the sense that these lines about self-confidence are not so much boasts as notes to herself. On Instagram, Simz talked about how she pushed through a crisis of confidence to finish the EP in April, while lockdown was sparking mental-health issues. Struggling against “all that self-doubt shit I never imagined thinking,” she notes, “I gassed myself up. There’s no one else here, I’m alone, I had to.” In between lines celebrating her success, Simz gives the impression of an artist halted mid-stride. She’s elated to be at such a successful point in her career, but she faces the pressure of calculating her next move—and, more to the point, she’s locked down like the rest of us, confronting mortality as well as enforced solitude. The world of these songs feels as small as a one-bedroom apartment. Each consists of little more than drums, snaking bassline, and Simz’s flare of a voice, and most run for less than three minutes. The shuffling, spare “you should call mum” is a song for the quarantine era: “Crabs in a barrel, we all in this,” she spits, between slow-rolling choruses about sleepless nights and nap-filled days. This circling of the same sounds and themes is an extreme form of introspection from a notoriously introspective artist. Occasionally, it becomes too claustrophobic, as with the off-the-cuff “damn right,” on which Simz cruises steadily in one gear. This confinement prevents the EP from reaching GREY Area’s heights, but Drop 6 still contains deeply affecting moments—particularly when Simz lands on cautious, conditional optimism. At the EP’s end, on “where’s my lighter,” she looks ahead to the future and her “next masterpiece” while keeping one fearful eye on the present. The EP’s final verse finishes mid-thought: “Breaking my back to make sure my family eats like...” That sense of uncertainty bleeds through every track—two of which have “might” in the title, including the most upbeat, with a hook that boasts, “I’ve got one life and I might just live it.” But it hits hardest on that piano-embellished final song, which is lifted by the smoky tendrils of London singer Alewya’s voice, and where Simz herself takes vocal leaps. Where the other songs are short and sharp, this one twists and turns through melancholia toward a lighter, softer promise that better days are still to come.","Stuck at home on lockdown, the London rapper returns to her long-running mixtape series with a gloomy, affecting meditation on self-reliance that feels as claustrophobic as a one-room apartment.

III,Auscultation,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb9617b8b87698b3b0b9d93/1:1/w_160/III_Auscultation.jpg,2020-05-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/auscultation-iii/,100% Silk,"At the close of a lengthy podcast interview last year, the electronic musician Joel Shanahan was asked if he had anything to add. “Play from the heart,” he said, without missing a beat. “Treat people well.” Over the past eight years, Shanahan’s idiosyncratic techno has encompassed jazzy whimsy, cosmic drift, and moody ambience; what ties it together is its questing spirit. Even when it zigzags, it’s marked by a palpable sense of forward motion, a yen for progress. For a time, that merely meant finding his style and honing his chops. But those two dictates—to be real and to be good—underscore something essential to Shanahan’s music: the attempt to envision a better world. Shanahan makes music under a variety of aliases, chief among them Golden Donna and Auscultation. He has roots in punk and DIY communities; in his early years performing and throwing parties in the electronic-music hinterlands of Madison, Wisconsin, he was instrumental in bridging the gap between rock kids and dance crowds. Today, in interviews and op-eds, Shanahan espouses the need for safe spaces for clubbers and fair compensation for artists. He has also been candid about his depression, which worsened following Oakland, California’s Ghost Ship fire, where 36 people died, including several of his friends; he was on the bill that night and watched helplessly as the building went up in flames. But Shanahan has been remarkably prolific in the years since, relocating to Portland, Oregon, and putting out a steady stream of new material, much of it exclusive to Bandcamp. In March, he quietly released a new Golden Donna album that built upon his signature style of live-to-tape hardware techno in exciting ways. But III, his new album under his Auscultation alias, is something else. It sounds like a breakthrough. Auscultation started out in 2014 as Shanahan’s ambient-house alter ego, the measured yin to Golden Donna’s ebullient yang. His self-titled debut under the alias was muted yet light-hearted, with a jazzy house lilt half-hidden beneath layers of tape hiss. The following year’s L’étreinte Imaginaire was equally hazy but more emotionally ambiguous, its chiming synths twinkling in the shadows like a Cheshire Cat smile. The first track on III, “Glowing Hearts in the Rainbow Room,” feels at first like a continuation of L’étreinte Imaginaire, wrapping ringing chords in endless reverb. But the new album boasts a more complex palette, mingling shades of ’90s ambient techno with distant echoes of the Cocteau Twins’ dream pop. All six tracks are clearly pieces of a larger whole, and a haunted air hangs over much of the album, even in moments of seeming calm: There are spectral voices and metallic shrieks, and the music teems with activity, innumerable tiny details rustling almost imperceptibly in the murk. Shanahan seems to be testing one of ambient techno’s core assumptions, that dance music removed from the dancefloor must be soothing. Even at the record’s mellowest, muted rhythms knock like a racing heart, and the low end has the felt-but-not-heard presence of a neighbor’s house party. Shanahan’s basslines have always been his secret weapon, and here they are stealthier and more powerful than ever, cutting through the gloom like neon lights through heavy fog. These songs are mercurial: moments of calm swiftly upended by anxious passages, and vice versa. By the album’s fourth track, “Turn Down These Voices,” it becomes clear just how complex Shanahan’s emotional terrain can be. Whimsical synth chords and swift, scratchy drum programming suggest the world’s largest, emptiest ice rink; the beat is surprisingly heavy. Plaintive, pitch-shifted voices gradually grow louder; the words are unintelligible, but the psychic pain is obvious, and despite the title’s plea, their wraithlike cries keep rising in volume until the very end. “Fool” plays with similar contrasts, ribbons of synth twisting gently over a brisk, distorted drum pattern, the atmosphere thick and cloudy. As the drums rise in the mix, what at first felt placid turns turbulent, sneakily forceful. This is something new: ambient as a clenched fist, fingernails pressing painfully into one’s palm. The haze that has always permeated Auscultation’s music here feels like it has actual physical properties, like something to be pushed through. It suggests real bodily effort, as tangible as sweat and tears. By the time the album reaches its conclusion with the gentle, beatless “Exit,” the feeling of catharsis is unmistakable. In a medical context, auscultation is the diagnostic act of listening to sounds in the body, and on III, Shanahan makes the process of healing as palpable as the smoothness of a scar where blood once ran.","Producer Joel Shanahan expands his palette, mingling shades of ’90s ambient techno with distant echoes of the Cocteau Twins. Even at the record’s mellowest, muted rhythms knock like a racing heart.

Petals for Armor,Hayley Williams,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5c582a994f4606de325df/1:1/w_160/Petals%20for%20Armor_Hayley%20Williams.jpg,2020-05-12 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hayley-williams-petals-for-armor/,Atlantic,"The use of voice memos in pop music—whether the dry, abstract interludes of Sonic Youth or the litany of voicemails throughout hip hop history—necessarily signals a pause, a moment to listen closely. But rather than a message from a missed connection or words of wisdom from a mentor, the new record from Paramore’s singer Hayley Williams features an intimate dispatch from her home. With her goldendoodle Alf barking in the background, Williams describes, sheepishly, a potential delay in the production process: “Uh, sorry, I was in a depression,” she offers by way of explanation. Trailing off, she adds, “Trying to come out of it now…” That moment of quiet reflection, understated in its depiction of the murkiness inherent to mental health, is an exemplary snapshot from her solo debut, Petals for Armor: intense emotional vulnerability couched in the creature comforts of her homestead. As Williams describes it, Petals for Armor began as an organic outgrowth of extreme introspection—specifically intensive, full-body therapy through a process called EMDR, in which the person in treatment is asked to recall distressing imagery, processing the experience through sensory input under the guidance of a therapist. For Williams, whose 2017 was marked with both immense highs—the release of Paramore’s triumphantly pop-oriented After Laughter—and definitive lows—a divorce from her partner of 10 years—therapy invoked powerful, at times grotesque imagery of nature. “I started having this vision where I was so gross, covered in dirt and soil, and there were vines and flowers,” she recounted. But that surreal vision became a sign of the inherent power and resilience in a body so outwardly fragile and feminine. Williams began writing songs around the same period, at the advice of a therapist. On Petals for Armor—originally released as three distinct EPs—Williams traces a meandering, multi-faceted path to recovery, one that might ring familiar to anyone who’s undergone the taxing process of intensive therapy. “Leave It Alone,” one of the earliest songs Williams wrote for the record, addresses the cruelty and irony of loss with chilling clarity: “If you know how to love/Best prepare to grieve,” she sings, her voice tipping upward, knowingly, on the last word of each line. The instrumentation, thick with gently sloping violins, brings to mind a post-rock dirge, invoking the leaden air of mourning without veering into maudlin sap. On “Rose/Lotus/Violet/Iris,” joined by the disaffected chorus of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus, she conjures a similarly haunted atmosphere, opening with ghostly, swirling vocals dense with delay. But despite the overcast mood, the lyrics hesitantly tell a story of regrowth. Through floral metaphors—“he loves me now, he loves me not,” wilting and blooming—she captures the history of women’s suffering, gesturing to intergenerational trauma without falling into hackneyed, broad-sweeping statements of feel-good empowerment. These hazy moments, which often reveal their depths only upon repeated listen, invoke a careful, considered path to self-love, one that doesn’t avoid its darker corners. The more hushed tones scattered throughout the album contrast her bolder statements, the musical equivalents of sudden breakthroughs. On “Cinnamon,” an uptempo ode to the comforts of nesting and making a home, Williams creates layered melodies with her vocals, beginning with animalistic yells of “ahh” and “ooh” and taking a sharp turn with highly syncopated, all-business enunciation on the versus: “Home is where I’m feminine/Smells like citrus and cinnamon,” she sings cooly, moving through the syllables of the final words like a percussive triplet. Here, as on “Creepin’,” with its robotic digital processing, Williams’ vocals sound towering and all-encompassing, as if she’s not simply claiming her power through words, but through taking up more space in the mix. Though the strength of Petals for Armor is derived from the complexities inherent in self-actualization, it is, at times, weakened by its musical and lyrical scope. Shifts in mood, as when the downtempo, shuffling ode to friendship “My Friend” leads into the propulsive synth-pop anthem “Over Yet,” are slightly jarring within the progression of the album, even if they’re expected within the context of therapeutic treatment. And after rage and recovery are discussed with such nuanced sensitivity early on in the record, it’s disappointing to hear her sing about love and sensuality with easy platitudes, as on the sophomoric refrain of “Taken.” Occasionally, these shifting moods occur within the span of a single song, as on “Dead Horse.” The song opens with that candid voice recording, which fades discomfitingly into bright, party-ready synths. Though it’s not new for Paramore to hide dark lyrics—the song details Williams’ affair with her now-ex-husband—within fluorescent melodies, the carefree nature of the somewhat-tropical house production can come off as if Williams is wearing a costume, playing the role of scorned ex through the lens of a dancehall singer. “Watch Me While I Bloom,” with its upbeat jazz rhythm and winking lyrics, similarly grates with its forced brightness, Williams’ cheery delivery coming across like a precocious lead actor in a school play. But even these weaker moments are small inside a record that is revelatory in its breadth, a manifestation of trust between its personnel: Taylor York, the record’s sole producer, and Zac Farro, who provided instrumentation, are long-time Paramore bandmates, lifers after the group’s many tumultuous shake-ups; Joey Howard, who helped pen several songs, is the band’s touring bassist. Somewhat counterintuitively, considering the familiarity among the players, the record, at its best, transcends the boundaries defined by their previous music, creating new soundscapes that recontextualize Williams’ powerful tenor. “Crystal Clear,” a pared-back march into the terrifying unknown, showcases the malleability of her voice. Beginning with woozy synths, the song picks up rhythm with skittering drum blasts, both of which take a backseat as soon as Williams’ swinging vocal enters. Here, Williams flows with the thematic current, her voice swaying and hanging heavy as she discusses overcoming romantic hang-ups. But by the time it reaches the chorus’ simple, hesitantly hopeful refrain, there’s a distinct lightness in her vocals, the relief palpable as she repeats, “Won’t give in to the fear.” We’re left with a vision of Williams that mirrors the strongest moments on Petals for Armor, one that takes the long way to enlightenment.","The Paramore singer’s debut solo album is emotionally vulnerable and musically ambitious, one that finds catharsis and enlightenment in the brambles of experimental pop production.

Regresa,Buscabulla,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5c7878b87698b3b0b9c78/1:1/w_160/Regresa_Buscabulla.jpg,2020-05-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/buscabulla-regresa/,Ribbon Music,"Home is a complex concept for Puerto Ricans. The island from which we hail is both part of the United States and not; as an unincorporated territory, its residents are citizens but can’t vote, can move freely between the island and the mainland yet are still seen as immigrants. Like many Puerto Ricans, Buscabulla’s Raquel Berrios and Luis Alfredo Del Valle left the island and made New York City their home, seeking opportunities otherwise unavailable to them. And they’re not alone; there are more Puerto Ricans in the greater New York area than in the capital of San Juan. But for everything that New York has to offer that Puerto Rico does not, there are parts of Puerto Rico that can’t be brought up north; the white sand of the beaches, the sounds of the jungle, the local traditions that stretch back centuries. For some, the only solution is to come home. Berrios and Del Valle moved to New York City separately to pursue their dreams, met at a house show, formed a band (its name is Puerto Rican slang for “troublemaker”), and started a family. But while they made their lives in the city, their spirit never left Puerto Rico, and the first two Buscabulla EPs were colored with deep longing and existential displacements. “Frío este duele” (“this cold hurts”) Berrios sang on “Frío,” their collaboration with Helado Negro, from EP II, yearning to warm her blood under the sun of her hometown. Once a record deal gave them the cushion to make the leap, they left New York six months after Hurricane Maria had battered their home. As thousands of Puerto Ricans fled the ravaged island for the States, Berrios and Del Valle headed in the opposite direction, packing up their life and moving back with family in tow. Regresa is the story of that return. But the home they returned to was not the one they had left, nor were they the same people who had once absconded north for creative pursuits. Many of their close family and friends had left or passed away, and vulture capitalists had already descended, seeking “economic opportunity.” The songs they wrote and recorded at their home studio in Aguadilla, a coastal town on the western side of the island, were joyful but melancholic. Regresa maintains their brand of tropical synth pop, but while their first records could be cheeky, poking fun at Latino machismo, this LP probes deeper questions of life and identity. The first song they wrote after arriving in Puerto Rico was “Vámono,” an indignant march inspired by local marching bands as well as Beyoncé’s Coachella set. Its video features traditions from their respective hometowns: vejigante masks from Carnaval de Ponce (where Del Valle is from) and the Festival de Las Mascaras of Hatillo, from whence Berrios’ family hails. It expresses the urgency of their journey—“Viene vamonos que es tarde ya” (“Come on let’s go it’s already late”) Berrios sings—as well as the overwhelming terror of what’s next (“Quien me va ayudar?” or “Who will help me?”). Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Berrio and Del Valle made much of the record in isolation, but they found ways to inject fresh energy. Patrick Wimberly (Chairlift, Solange, Blood Orange) mixed the album and contributed additional production, and Nick Hakim’s pre-COVID-19 visit to their home bore fruit in the form of several songs, including contributions on “El Aprieto,” English vocals on “Volta,” and a co-writing credit on “Mio,” a screed decrying the political and corporate influences that are turning the island into a tax haven for the one percent. An orchestral arrangement from Helado Negro’s Roberto Carlos Lange gives an otherworldly tint to “Club Tú y Yo,” a romantic ode Del Valle wrote for Berrios. But it’s the contributions of the famed 71-year-old Puerto Rican actress and singer Nydia Caro that keep the album from veering into darkness. The song marks the shift from angst to acceptance: “Light comes after the greatest darkness/You can't see the stars if you don't have a dark night/Let the darkness be your impulse towards Light,” Caro murmurs. Buscabulla’s Puerto Rico may be a paradise lost, an oasis devastated by an apocalypse. But from the moment they returned, they’ve been picking up the pieces and rebuilding; their home, their community, and themselves. After years of yearning from 1600 miles away, they’re home, and they finally sound whole.","The Puerto Rican duo moved back to the island in the wake of Hurricane Maria, and their joyful and melancholic new album takes stock of their changed home.

"What’s New, Tomboy?",Damien Jurado,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5cd3ed7b4ffbd265094c3/1:1/w_160/What%E2%80%99s%20New%20Tomboy?_Damien%20Jurado.jpg,2020-05-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/damien-jurado-whats-new-tomboy/,Mama Bird ,"On his 15th album, Damien Jurado confronts impermanence with arresting frankness. Across What’s New, Tomboy?’s 10 songs, a close friend perishes onstage, a plane smashes into the side of a mountain, and a long sought-after romance promises a dark comfort: someone to die with. Jurado may examine the unpleasant, but his observations are aren’t needlessly morbid or cynical, nor tortured or overwrought. Instead, Jurado allows these reflections to drift by like a steady current, never lingering long enough to invite undue scrutiny. In this 30-minute collection of vivid impressions, Jurado positions his voice at the front of the mix, braced by subtle and warm folk arrangements. His words are still just above a whisper, but they’re impactful as ever. What’s New, Tomboy? is, unsurprisingly, a quiet album, but it is noticeably less quiet than its predecessor, 2019’s In the Shape of a Storm, which also featured 10 brief entries. But while those songs were built entirely around acoustic guitar and Jurado’s tempered chest voice, What’s New, Tomboy? features an expanded palette courtesy of multi-instrumentalist Josh Gordon. Gordon was present on In the Shape of a Storm (playing high-strung guitar), but here he lays down bass, electric guitar, drums, Hammond organ, Rhodes, and more. Jurado extends himself as well, adding Mellotron and percussion to his usual repertoire. The effect is hushed but rich, and Gordon’s presence adds levity to Jurado’s melodies: His guitar licks on “Arthur Aware” and opener “Birds Tricked Into the Trees” twinkle as they refract off Jurado’s dusky voice. Gordon might be the reason that What’s New, Tomboy? at times sounds like a stripped-back pop record. Jurado recently admitted to Aquarium Drunkard that in the past year he’s become a first-time Beatles fan (“at 47 years old!”), suggesting that this may have partly influenced the simple structure of these new songs; there’s also a McCartneyesque feel to Gordon’s basslines. But despite What’s New, Tomboy?’s enlivened arrangements, the most interesting element is his lyrics, packed with fragments of daily life and ruminations on death. Mid-album ballad “Fool Maria” relays a series of contradictory images, at first lovely and then tragic. He likens a woman’s eyelids to a closing curtain “that lets you know it’s over.” “We are fiction as it’s written/The bleeding ink on paper,” Jurado sings, accenting his words with fingerpicked guitar. “Quiet as an aeroplane/Before it hits the mountain.” It’s like Jurado has baked a fish into a birthday cake—you eat a forkful of something sweet only to bite into a pungent and unpleasant surprise. Jurado doesn’t have a regimented writing schedule; his songs show up when he’s occupied with other things, whether that’s laundry, television, or even sleep. Avoiding the process is the process, and it’s likely the reason his lyrics sound so inspired and original. On the driving “Arthur Aware,” banshee-like backing vocals swirl around the dark fable, and a character named Mr. Will shares a cryptic secret: “I keep all of my prized reflections/In glass jars from the coroner,” he says. “And when I get bored of looking at myself/I trade the gray for the shade of someone else.” Singular passages like this are marbled throughout the album, and they don’t sound like belabored phrases that have been erased and rewritten a thousand times. Instead, they seem to have appeared to Jurado fully formed while he was walking through the grocery store—slippery thoughts that will dissolve if not documented immediately. If Jurado’s ideas are fleeting and intangible, that might be because he thinks life is, too. On “Ochoa,” Jurado sings to his late friend and longtime collaborator Richard Swift, who died in 2018 of complications from alcohol addiction. “Absence tunes the choir/Symphonies of you,” Jurado sings, again disrupting a serene image with a death knell: “You turn to sing, you’re gone/The show must go on.” But Jurado is quick to comfort his lost friend with the knowledge that he won’t be long behind. This sentiment is reinforced on “The End of the Road,” perhaps the album’s best song. Here death is lassoed to devotion. Gordon’s walking, bulbous bassline guides Jurado and his partner down a winding one-way street. We all know what’s at the end of it, but Jurado makes time to take in the bewildering scenery along the way.","Channeling stripped-back pop songs into hushed folk arrangements, the Seattle singer-songwriter’s 15th album confronts life’s impermanence in terms tender yet unsentimental.

Shadow Talk,Cafe Racer,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb5d3d57408de6d52fb5c7d/1:1/w_160/Shadow%20Talk_Cafe%20Racer.jpg,2020-05-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cafe-racer-shadow-talk/,Born Yesterday,"With their radiant warmth and cracked, spidery riffs, Chicago jangle-rock band Cafe Racer sound a bit like a sidewalk on a summer day. For a while, they seemed perfectly content to stroll: On their second album, 2018’s Famous Dust, they shuffled along at a leisurely pace, guided by singer Michael Santana’s staticky whisper-sneer. It was a vibe, but the songs didn’t always move with confidence—some had one chord change too many, one true change too few. Their third album, Shadow Talk, doesn’t just leave those critiques in the dust—it’s also the rare case of a band that sounds entirely aware of how much better it’s gotten. Cafe Racer are now bigger, sharper, and far more flexible. While Santana still sings as though from behind Jim Reid’s and Jason Pierce’s sunglasses, he also doesn’t hesitate to tear them off for the occasional towering ripper and bark some heavy-sounding words, pushing his full weight into “boulder” and “vulture” on “Seminal Art.” Behind him, bassist Rob McWilliams and new drummer Elise Poirier hum in the shadows. They do heavy lifting without breaking a sweat; when the rest of the band violently crashes down around them in the middle third of “Exile,” they keep the whole thing up while hardly raising their voices. Still, the best part of Shadow Talk is its gestalt: The individual pieces are all a notch stronger, but their sum is a ton stronger. Credit not only Cafe Racer’s conviction to rewire their love of fuzz with new energy, but also the album’s phenomenal sequencing. Subtle but firm, Shadow Talk’s motion mirrors time and weather: the first three tracks sound like a lucid morning becoming a focused afternoon, then gliding into a depressurized evening. Midway through the 10-minute closing track, a sustaining organ slips in unannounced, the whistling breeze that gently informs you that you have about four minutes before it turns into a droning downpour. Shadow Talk is soluble yet rock-solid; it evaporates and re-materializes with ease. For a five-piece like Cafe Racer, grasping this slippery balance doesn’t happen by accident. It can take years of trial and error, the kind of long-term conditioning made possible by the independent venues where the band came up—venues that suddenly find themselves endangered. Shadow Talk is a victory made possible in part by artistic incubators like the Hideout, the Empty Bottle, and Beat Kitchen; it’s heavy but fitting that the album now takes on additional meaning advocating for their survival.","The Chicago band’s third album brings wiry new energy to their fuzzed-out rock songs. The individual pieces are all a notch stronger, but their sum is a ton stronger.

By design “Valentine’s Day (Shameful)” has the dour feel of an uprooted flower bed, a gnarl of dirt and worms and grit. The song is nominally a breakup ballad, but tucked between the kiss-offs and spilled tea is a quiet grace. “Ain’t no regrets ’cause I’m proud that my heart was so pure/And I’m never ashamed of my love,” Kehlani sings, consoled by her honest effort. It Was Good Until It Wasn’t expands that poise into an ace R&B showcase. Less explicitly autobiographical and triumphant than her previous music, the album’s emphasis is on immersion. Kehlani takes emotions and situations and bathes in their contradictions and tensions, often arriving at clarity rather than catharsis. This results in love songs that are more about the mechanics of relationships, how and why they work (or don’t), rather than their discrete participants. The album feels like a subtle rejoinder to the aughts obsession with phones and miscommunications, mining all the other forces that make and break romance. The record begins with “Toxic,” an ode to a partner who Kehlani likens to tequila for the way he unhinges her. Built on reluctant praise, 808s, and dulled chimes that pulse like a headache, the song introduces the thesis of the album. “I get real accountable when I’m alone,” Kehlani sings as she yearns for a problematic lover. For Kehlani, accountability is separate from resolution. When she looks into the dark heart of this toxic arrangement, she recognizes that its danger is precisely what she wants. That sense of love as risk is a feature of Kehlani’s music, but It Was Good Until It Wasn’t has a sharper sense of the specific stakes of taking the plunge. “Bad News” distills the thug-love trope to its anxious essence: “Don’t wanna get no call with no bad news,” Kehlani sings frankly. It feels like a prediction more than a plea. “Tell your girlfriend that you single,” she demands on “Can I,” flipping Aaliyah’s coy “Come Over” into naked lust. On “Everybody Business,” she deflects ambient gossip into a warning to the naysayers: “Don’t make me feel bad for lovin’.” In all these instances, love has ramifications beyond the feelings of two people. Isolation and distance are recurring themes, giving the record’s timing an eerie relatability. On highlight “Hate the Club,” Kehlani’s harmonies swell and shimmer as she watches the clock and the door, drinking to endure the arrival of an estranged lover. Jahaan Sweet and Yussef Dayes’ lush, loungey production laces the scene with sweet irony; it’s as if the mere thought of her amour showing up makes the night bearable. On “Can You Blame Me,” that intense craving for affection produces one of the strongest couplets Kehlani’s ever written: “I would rather argue than me sleep alone/Rather call you out than no one call my phone.” The line conveys the underlying cravenness of affection, its ability to melt away reason and indulge the lonely human within. Coincidentally and intentionally, R&B artists have made some of the strongest songs about separation during quarantine, but It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is best understood as a continuation of the genre’s longer tradition of probing loneliness. The production here fits that pursuit, replacing the sunny, poppy swells of SweetSexySavage with cloudy grooves that rock and sway rather than ascend and drop. This shift allows Kehlani to layer her voice as well as flex it, an approach that works wonders on “F&MU,” where her background vocals trace the main melody as well as Jahaan Sweet’s synths. She’s alone but she isn’t. The lack of distinct characters in Kehlani’s storytelling can make the conflicts and hookups at the heart of her songs feel diffuse, as on “Grieving,” where it’s unclear whether James Blake is playing the ex mentioned in the first verse or himself. Likewise, the lover praised on “Water” just sounds like some schmuck who gave a good lay. But she’s becoming an increasingly agile performer, rapping, singing, and everything in between. It Was Good Until It Wasn’t channels all those skills into sterling R&B that feels like a homecoming of sorts. Just a few years ago she declared, “I don’t even make R&B.” Change is good.","The cloudy grooves of the Oakland singer’s second full-length album showcase her voice and her clear-eyed approach. These are love songs about all the forces that make and break romance.

Yeo​-​Neun,Okkyung Lee,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb58190e5423e84f420e610/1:1/w_160/Yeo%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8BNeun_Okkyung%20Lee.jpg,2020-05-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/okkyung-lee-yeo-neun/,Shelter Press,"A key figure in New York’s avant-garde for 20 years, cellist Okkyung Lee is seemingly on a quest to discover every sound that her instrument is capable of making. She can attack its strings with volcanic intensity before dropping down to a fierce pianissimo, probing the boundary between tonality and noise. She is equally at home improvising alongside electronic and acoustic musicians, seamlessly melding her cello with Christian Marclay’s turntablist chaos, the overtone-rich drones of Ellen Fullman’s long-string instrument, and the abstracted blues of Bill Orcutt’s four-string guitar. Regardless of the idiom she’s working in, Lee is an exceptionally expressive performer, able to conjure rapture as effectively as unrest. Despite the sweeping range of her work over the last two decades, Lee has never sounded as elegant as on Yeo-Neun, her debut for Félicia Atkinson’s Shelter Press label. These compositions, informed by the Korean traditional and popular music of her formative years, are spacious and patient. They contain playful counterpoint and contemplative melodic tangents, and the arrangements for quartet distill grand musical ideas into a minimalist framework. Lee’s cello is frequently the subtlest element in the mix, and the ensemble (harpist Maeve Gilchrist, pianist Jacob Sacks, and bassist Elvynd Opsvik) operates with eloquence and precision. Even for a musician so focused on extremes, this pivot to chamber music is as surprising as any primal burst of shrieking sound. A sense of meticulous equilibrium permeates the pieces on Yeo-Neun. Even its most impassioned passages contain a sense of hushed wonder, and moments of collected calm can fluently unravel into dissonance. “Another Old Story (옛날이야기),” with its stately, syncopated ostinato and majestic melodic flourishes, is followed by the sparse, impressionistic “In Stardust (For Kang Kyung-ok),” and the contrast between the two accentuates the heavy melancholy of  the latter’s Morton Feldman-esque piano figures. Even the instrumentation suggests a sense of balance: The cello and bass, capable of long, sustained tones and more varied textural explorations, often provide a foil to the chordal, rapidly decaying sounds of the piano and harp. The most exciting contrasts come when Lee’s propensity for chaos expresses itself within the confines of more rigid compositional frameworks. Her use of extended techniques—ways of playing an instrument that fall outside established norms—is a defining characteristic of her performances, and on Yeo-Neun it feels revelatory. The creaking, scratchy texture of horsehair grinding away at her cello’s strings on “In Stardust” adds a completely alien dimension to the otherwise muted atmosphere. The penultimate piece, “Facing Your Shadows,” is a slow build that grows from spare, arpeggiated figures into a frenzied rush of scraping strings and bursts of harp: an image of serenity shot through with tumult. Yeo-Neun is remarkable not only for its sophistication and restrained intricacy, but also as a statement of personal and creative growth. Flowing between formal tonality and structural dissolution, Lee reconciles her traditional musical upbringing with her subsequent expansion into free improvisation and avant-garde composition, and she finds an unusual beauty in juxtaposing the familiar character of popular and traditional music with experimental sound-making’s leap into the cosmic unknown. It’s thrilling to hear work so reflective from an artist often associated with volatility.","Accompanied by bass, piano, and harp, the New York cellist refracts traditional Korean influences though an avant-garde lens, yielding an album as surprising as it is elegant.

Music for 18 Musicians,Erik Hall,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb58aacd7b4ffbd2650948b/1:1/w_160/Music%20for%2018%20Musicians_Erik%20Hall.jpg,2020-05-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/erik-hall-music-for-18-musicians/,Western Vinyl,"When Erik Hall decided to record Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians by himself, he didn’t know he would be releasing it into a world where a traditional rehearsal of it, let alone a performance, would be illegal. (Technically, it should be called Music for at Least 18 Musicians.) And if it’s tempting to cast Hall as a prophet of social distancing, it’s even more tempting to cast him in terms of hubris: Here’s a young post-minimalist from Michigan who not only thinks he’s equal to the most influential American composer’s most iconic piece, but dares to recast it in a sleek, dark-hued electronic palette. But unless you regard 18 Musicians as a sacred text—and maybe you do—there’s nothing that audacious about someone recording it layer by layer with electronic instruments. If Hall had strapped mallets all over his body and tried to play it in the usual way, that would have been hubris. Still, there were more ways for this to go wrong than right. The only prior solo recording of any note, by Rough Fields in 2014, fell prey to some of them, with a misconceived palette that emphasized blurting repetition. Hall’s version feels shiny, new, and self-contained, but its continuity with Reich is clear—both musically, in its close attention to the structure and spirit of the score, and culturally, in its repayment of electronic music’s debt to the minimalist composer. Music for 18 Musicians premiered in 1976, a big year for a small genre, which also gave us Philip Glass’ Einstein on the Beach. The piece was a turning point for Reich, who flooded his severe, unpopular minimalism with 18 musicians (some of them playing two parts at once) and toothsome harmonic motion—more of it in the first five minutes than in the entirety of any one of his prior works, he said. You didn’t need to appreciate the mysteries of tape loops or unaccompanied clapping to get it. The piece solidified minimalism in the public consciousness and even pushed it to the edge of pop: Robert Christgau’s glowing review of the 1978 recording was reprinted in his guide to 1970s rock albums, an odd but telling context for a work without a single guitar, bass, drum, lead vocal, riff, verse, chorus, or lyric. What it did have was melody and motion, and listening to it makes you feel immortal. At the outset, 11 chords are played through two breath cycles each. Then, each becomes a stage for a study in interlocking pulses that kaleidoscopically glimmer and whirl. The changes are marked by a rare non-repeating metallophone phrase (watch the tall man with glasses waiting so patiently in the terrific Eighth Blackbird performance). The metrical patterns don’t seem to respire, they do respire, measured by the players’ breath, the bass clarinet pumping away like a great lung. It takes a certain kind of person to perform the repetitious underlying pulses on pieces like 18 Musicians and Terry Riley’s In C without going slack or mad. Reich assigned the task to pianos and mallet instruments, roles that Hall, a pianist and percussionist, was well-prepared to merge. Discarding the mallet instruments that make 18 Musicians hover, Hall instead makes it zoom. He rivets the core pulse to a muted piano, translates violin to electric guitar, and constructs the bass clarinet on a Moog synthesizer, sometimes swapping these voices around, as Reich does. It amounts to a series of shrewd tradeoffs: prismatic color for shapely contours, organic breath for mechanical power. Yet the signature details and passages of the piece—which moves similar material through many moods, from sprightly to raucous to mystical—are all in place. Hall captures not just the layered clockwork motion, but also the specific loopy timbre of a clarinet here, the sudden appearance of a maraca there, and the character of a vocal phrase in a Moog sweep. Though his version clocks in just under the appointed 55 minutes, it feels fast, borne along by scudding bass lines, and its reference points are as modern as they are arch-minimalist. The opening piano pulse comes on with the scrambling urgency of LCD Soundsystem’s “All My Friends,” and Colin Stetson fans will appreciate the percolating urgency Hall wrenches from the score. Removing the human breath that fundamentally governs Music for 18 Musicians required that Hall replace it with some other animating force. He found it by approaching the piece not as what it had been—the capstone and turning point of a musical era—but as what it had become: an idea that a broad spectrum of electronic musicians absorbed deeply into their hypnotic arpeggiations and busily interacting musical cells. His take is legible in history but assertive of the moment, propelled by its own vigor as much as anything else, and it makes a minimalist standard freshly thrilling to revisit.","Eighteen musicians? In this economy? The Michigan post-minimalist recasts Steve Reich’s landmark composition as a solo project with a sleek, dark-hued electronic palette.

They Call Me Disco EP,Ric Wilson Terrace Martin,by: Jackson Howard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb585727408de6d52fb5c71/1:1/w_160/They%20Call%20Me%20Disco%20EP_Ric%20Wilson%20&%20Terrace%20Martin.jpg,2020-05-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ric-wilson-terrace-martin-they-call-me-disco-ep/,Free DiscoEMPIRE,"Burgeoning Chicago rapper Ric Wilson is a throwback to a certain type of ’70s-era do-everything star: part MC, part bandleader, he’d be at home rapping with the Sugarhill Gang or shouting adlibs over fellow Chicagoan Frankie Knuckles’ thumping, soulful house. Wilson, who has a string of singles and EPs to his name, came up with the same Young Chicago Authors collective that birthed Noname, Saba, and Chance the Rapper, among others; like those artists, his verses often veer toward the poetic and cerebral, eschewing traditional rhyme patterns and subject matter for free-associative dives into the personal, political, and nonsensical. They Call Me Disco, Wilson’s collaborative EP with the prolific Los Angeles producer  and multi-instrumentalist Terrace Martin, is a jubilant six-song burst of summertime grooves and throwback funk. Martin, a longstanding collaborator of Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, and a producer for several other West Coast mainstays, is in his comfort zone, assembling four-on-the-floor drums, thick slabs of bass, and simple but rich chords throughout to create a warm facsimile of old school funk—spanning Lakeside to The Gap Band—with a dose of neo-soul sprinkled in. Wilson and Martin’s chemistry is undeniable; while not nearly as nimble (technically or lyrically) as Kendrick, Kurupt, DJ Quik, or any other of Martin’s nasally L.A. collaborators, Wilson’s conversational verses nonetheless sound just as natural over Martin’s layered beats. They’re not reinventing the wheel by any means, but on They Call Me Disco, Martin and Wilson know how to make your feet move, and, more importantly, how to make you feel good. Wilson’s greatest strength—his undeniable enthusiasm and charisma—is also at times his biggest downfall. His obvious musicality and inventiveness notwithstanding, Wilson’s eagerness can exacerbate the fact that he’s often stringing together irreverent non-sequiturs. When he tries too hard to espouse a worldview beyond peace, love, and confidence, he can come off as cringey (“Slappin’ hoes with my left/Fight for rights with my right,” he raps on “Breakin Rules”) or sophomoric (“Global warming is swarming/Beyond the matrix/While we out killing /For colorism and hatred,” he ponders on closer “Beyond Me”). They Call Me Disco, as a title, suggests the birth of a new persona, but in reality it’s more like Wilson figuring out what he wants to say in real time. Despite these moments of little sibling-like eagerness, Wilson’s—and by extension, Martin’s—giddiness is mostly contagious. And when Wilson doesn’t try too hard, the EP is pure joy, a transportive, funkified missive from another, happier dimension. “Don’t Kill the Wave” is the best of the project’s collection of dancefloor-fillers (though “Move Like This” is a close second): a foot-stomping, synth-flooded smash, it takes a page from Kendrick’s pulsing, Martin-produced “King Kunta” and adds some Dâm-Funk flair, as Wilson gleefully anoints himself “the disco Kaepernick.” Wilson and Martin have more than one gear, too—standout “Before You Let Go,” which features a lush contribution from singer Malaya, has shades of frequent Martin collaborator Thundercat, complete with spaced-out chords and a slinking half-time groove as Wilson courts a potential lover. Wilson ends the EP with a question. “Why do I see color when I’m livin’ in gray?” he asks, uncharacteristically somber. Instead of an answer, They Call Me Disco provides a perspective shift: in a moment when we’re all living gray, Wilson and Martin are here to remind us of the color that never left.","The Chicago rapper’s collaborative EP with the L.A. producer Terrace Martin is a jubilant six-song burst of summertime grooves and throwback funk.

Attica Blues,Archie Shepp,by: Nate Chinen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1e1953707e26f99351b5a/1:1/w_160/Attica%20Blues_Archie%20Shepp.jpg,2020-05-10 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/archie-shepp-attica-blues/,Impulse!,"On January 26, 1972, Archie Shepp packed up his tenor and soprano saxophones and headed to A&R Recording in New York for the third and final session of an album he was planning to call Attica Blues. If he happened to flip through a newspaper that morning, Shepp would have seen a few articles relevant to his cause: the Attica Prison uprising, which had transpired four months earlier but still amounted to an unfolding story. In its aftermath, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed a bipartisan commission on penal reform, which was just issuing its first report. “We are profoundly troubled that the present correctional system reflects an anachronistic, bastille‐like philosophy,” the committee chairman told The New York Times. “We doubt that there is any real hope that it can accomplish society’s objectives today.” The quote appeared in the paper on Jan. 26, below a separate article with the headline, “Impeach Rockefeller Over Attica, A Buffalo Assemblyman Demands.” Shepp probably wouldn’t have been surprised, or much impressed, by these indictments. What happened at Attica Correctional Facility, in upstate New York, amounted to one of the deadliest confrontations on American soil since the Civil War. On the morning of Sept. 13, 1971, state troopers opened fire on the prison in a siege-like effort to end a four-day rebellion in protest of inhumane conditions. According to a stark racial calculus, the protesting prisoners were mostly black and the assaulting troopers were mostly white. The savagery of the attack—39 people, inmates and hostages, were slain by police gunfire, with more than twice as many wounded—registered as an instant scandal and an unspeakable horror. As investigative journalist Tom Robbins characterized it several years ago, in an article for The Marshall Project, the assault on Attica was “a massive bloodletting marked by spasms of sadism.” So it was a bold stroke for Shepp to respond to this moment with Attica Blues. It was also totally in character for him: A leading provocateur of jazz’s radical “New Thing,” he had titled his previous album Things Have Got to Change. The same Afrocentric and revolutionary energies pulse through Attica Blues, with resolute conviction but a shifting center of gravity. The album is a sociopolitical statement shaded with human complexity. There is protest in it, but also tenderness and wistfulness and hopeful rumination. It’s a landmark in part because it refuses the stoical clarity of a broadside, just as it wriggles free of the parameters that typically apply to a so-called jazz album. Shepp came out of the avant-garde black-music tradition that proudly claimed Cecil Taylor and anointed John Coltrane. Those two lodestars were instrumental in his career: Shepp made his earliest recordings with Taylor in 1960, and when he signed a deal with Impulse! Records in ’64, it was through Coltrane’s intervention, under the label stipulation that he play Coltrane’s music. That first effort, Four For Trane, initiated a potent run of Shepp albums for Impulse!—including Fire Music, a Hall of Fame entry from ’65—that most observers filed, somewhat reductively, under “free jazz.” With all this in mind, it’s reasonable to expect that Attica Blues would open with a sorrowful dirge, like Coltrane’s “Alabama”; or in a cacophonous roil, like Coltrane’s Ascension; or in simmering rage, like “Malcolm, Malcolm, Semper Malcolm,” a spoken-word piece from Fire Music. Instead, Attica Blues opens with wah-wah rhythm guitar, a snaking electric bass, and a clattering tambourine—signifiers of the street, in tune with the glorious stank of Funkadelic and the impudent grandeur of a blaxploitation score. Ten seconds into the title track, veteran gospel-soul singer Carl Hall (credited on the album by an alias, Henry Hull) bursts in like an emergency alarm. “I got a feeling that something ain’t going right!” he sings in a piercing, androgynous cry. “And I’m worried ’bout the human soul!” The lyrics come from a poem by Shepp’s drummer, Beaver Harris (credited on the album by his given name, William G. Harris), but it’s clear that Shepp shares the stated conviction: I’m worried about the human soul. As the song balloons into a psychedelic-funk fever dream, it quickly becomes clear that Shepp’s concerns are much bigger than, if also inextricable from, the systemic failure and heinous outcome at Attica. “Through his music here,” writes percussionist Abdul Zahir Batin in the album liner notes, “we can feel the roots of a plight.” Shepp’s essential partner on Things Have Got to Change had been Cal Massey, a visionary trumpeter and arranger who shared his political perspective. They teamed up again for Attica Blues, and Massey, in turn, recruited Romulus Franceschini, his composing partner in a concern called The RoMas Orchestra. On “Steam,” a dreamy waltz that takes up much of the album’s first side, the flexibility of Franceschini’s string orchestration—featuring an all-star violin section of Leroy Jenkins, John Blake, and L. Shankar, along with cellists Ronald Lipscomb and Calo Scott—allows the song to morph from succor to astringency and back again. The song’s singer is Joe Lee Wilson, and his expressive baritone gives Shepp’s lyrics a tangible shape: “Summer,” he half-sings, half-sighs, “Soft as the rain/And sweet as the end of pain.” (If you have ever admired the work of Dwight Trible and Patrice Quinn in Kamasi Washington’s band, the declaratory stance of the singing should ring agreeably familiar.) There’s an interlude between parts one and two of “Steam,” and it pairs a deep and droning solo by Jimmy Garrison, Coltrane’s longtime bassist, with the recitation of a poem by Bartholomew Gray. The poem, “Invocation to Mr. Parker,” pays homage to alto saxophonist and bebop progenitor Charlie Parker—“that driving music man/who used to wail out back.” It’s a nod to jazz lineage that might seem out of place on such a politically charged album, until you consider Shepp’s understanding of black music as unavoidably political in and of itself, a point of view he shared with poet and critic Amiri Baraka. Later, on side two, there comes “Good Bye Sweet Pops,” Massey’s elegy for Louis Armstrong, who’d died in the summer of ’71. The song has no words, but still manages to hail Armstrong as a village elder; it’s a regal, bittersweet ballad that kicks into double time for Shepp’s breezy yet commanding soprano solo. The album’s thematic framework invites a reading of “Sweet Pops” as a valiant soldier, weathering so much injustice in his time, and finding the ultimate dignity in release. Sweet as the end of pain. The way that all of these songs and spoken-word passages swirl one into the next speaks to the realization of Shepp’s ambitions on Attica Blues. (Praise is also due to his producer, Ed Michel.) The way it all coheres is what makes Attica Blues one of the more successful concept albums in jazz history. But Shepp would probably object to at least two words in that encomium—starting with “jazz,” given his public disavowal of the term as a white man’s yoke for African American music. The other might be “concept,” with its lofty aesthetic baggage. “I don’t believe in the word ‘art,’” he told critic John Litweiler in 1974. “It’s, to me, not functional, it’s passive. It’s bourgeois in the sense that art develops at a point when people have leisure time. That’s like the Platonic ideal, something that can be observed as art, something outside experience.” Attica Blues seeks the inside track of experience. The album cover is a Chuck Stewart photograph of Shepp at work, seated at a piano with a tenor saxophone lying prone beneath his gaze. But what he appears to be studying, as he smokes a cigarette, is sheet music. Over his left shoulder is a bookcase crammed with books and records; over his right is an Olympics ’68 poster, showing Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their black-gloved fists on the podium. A keen student of revolutionary politics, Shepp was well aware that the Attica uprising had a precipitating event clear across the country: the killing of author and activist George Jackson, shot dead by prison guards during a failed escape at San Quentin. “Blues For Brother George Jackson,” which opens Side Two of Attica Blues, is Shepp’s paean to this fallen hero—and probably the most straightforward piece on the album, a 12-bar form with a grooving ostinato and a polished blare of horns. Shepp’s tenor solo, which follows a squawking alto statement by Marion Brown, exudes a characteristically robust charisma. Despite the temptation to memorialize Jackson in words—as Bob Dylan had in “George Jackson,” which was rushed to release the previous November—Shepp lets the soul in the song speak for itself. That is, until “Invocation: Ballad For a Child” fades in, featuring another Beaver Harris poem; “I would rather be a plant than a man in this land,” it begins. As on a similar interlude from side one, the solemn recitation is by William Kunstler, a radical lawyer who’d been an appointed witness to the doomed negotiations at Attica, and who would later defend several of its prisoners at trial. The very presence of Kunstler may be the purest act of provocation on Attica Blues. But it also underscores a core conviction about the uprising, which came about because the largely African American prison population objected to subhuman treatment and brutal living conditions. The massacre that followed was just a dire confirmation of their plight. As Kunstler intones in “Invocation: Attica Blues,” speaking words by Harris: “Some people think that they are in their rights/When on command they take a black man’s life.” We don’t need to draw an explicit parallel with the Black Lives Matter movement to recognize the undying urgency of Shepp’s argument. We don’t need to study the scourge of mass incarceration to understand that Attica Blues has lost none of its relevance. And we don’t need to strain, at least not much, to grasp the faith that the album places in the purity of a child. On “Ballad For a Child,” the bittersweet, Marvin Gaye-like reflection that follows Kunstler’s second reading, Carl Hall’s gospel vocals return. “But what the whole world really needs,” he sings, flipping into his buttery falsetto, “is a baby’s smile.” The earnest sentimentality of that lyric might feel gauzy and credulous on an album so mired in hard realities—an impression that Shepp readily disarms by concluding Attica Blues with a song called “Quiet Dawn.” Composed by Massey as an Afro-soul bossa nova, it features a stirring vocal by the composer’s daughter Waheeda Massey, who was in grade school at the time. The orchestration on “Quiet Dawn,” credited to RoMas, makes it one of the most vividly textured pieces on Attica Blues. The string section toggles between a quiet shimmer and a twitchy pizzicato, while the brass and reed sections meld into a soulful mass. Shepp’s rhythm section on the track—Garrison on bass, Walter Davis, Jr. on piano and Billy Higgins on drums, with several percussionists—maintains a strong pull without upsetting the song’s tonal balance. Shepp delivers his most bravura tenor solo, notes pouring out of his horn as if from a spigot. But it’s the small, determined voice of Waheeda Massey that you remember after the song and the album are done. “Quiet Dawn” doesn’t have the most singable melody on the album, and her intonation often lands under a given pitch. That imperfection speaks to the innocence and vulnerability of a child—but young Waheeda also exudes a steady, untroubled self-assurance. You can almost picture her gazing out toward the horizon line as she sings her father’s deceptively simple lyrics, more in reassurance than in resignation, at the top of the song: It’s quiet

Apparition EP,serpentwithfeet,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb18748aa1f4567491c2e6f/1:1/w_160/Apparition%20EP_serpentwithfeet.jpg,2020-05-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/serpentwithfeet-apparition-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"As serpentwithfeet, Josiah Wise wields his powerful, choir-trained voice to reach for the sublime. His elastic vibrato adds urgency to lyrics about the hazards and highs of queer love, occasionally multiplying into a sweeping chorus to deepen the sense of grandeur. On Apparition, the Baltimore artist’s new three-song EP, he invites listeners into his dark night of the soul. Where soil largely lamented the pitfalls of romance, Apparition takes a more introspective approach, as Wise rids himself of emotional baggage. His outlook remains generous and full of light, and the songs brim with the strength necessary to make it to tomorrow. Apparition opens with a dancing piano figure on “A Comma,” like a sequence from an étude. It contradicts the weariness to come, in which Wise strains to break free from expectations over heavy, rolling bass and drums. “Someone else’s beasts are riding me/I know this pain isn’t mine,” he sings ruefully, “Yet I feel it all the time.” His  vocal delivery is tremulous, the background filled with ghostly, wordless vocalizations and fraught silences. He wants to be an “open book,” to have agency and move the way he pleases, but the churning music beneath him suggests that it lingers out of reach. It’s a mental rut that Apparition’s beguiling eight minutes seek to remedy. All three songs on the EP were produced by Wynne Bennett, who lent a similarly delicate touch to Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer highlight “Pynk.” Bennett’s understated production is a good fit for Wise, who continues to use his voice to land emotional haymakers. On “This Hill,” he is accented by airy, tinkling piano and clicking programmed drums as he explores a selfish melancholy, angry at the earth for “asking him to live this long” in misery. Wise finds a moment of epiphany halfway through, his voice careening to the fore. The repeated insistence that he’s “better now” feels unshakable, the layers of swooning harmonies giving biblical weight to overcoming self-doubt. “This Hill” radiates a warmth that Wise maintains on “Psychic,” where his playful sense of humor comes to light. Here, he opens up to romance, cooing seductively to a “debonair soothsayer.” Wise chews into his spiritualist romantic object with unabated pleasure: “Shame on those who dread prophecy,” he sighs, “They must not know how hot it can be.” Bounding over echoing drums and a metronomic piano, “Psychic” recalls soil’s friskier songs like “slow syrup” and “fragrant,” where bawdy humor snuck into his poetic verses like glimpses of skin through fabric. Apparition proves that Wise moves in whatever sensuous direction he pleases, reckoning with himself head-on in order to break free and experience true connection.","On his new three-song EP, the Baltimore artist uses his sinuous, stunning voice to navigate a dark night of the soul.

Few rappers work harder or give more of themselves, but he tends to make his most resonant music when he gives himself time to reflect. Case in point: His latest album, Beyond Bulletproof, comes after a six-month break, and while the lyrics represent another immersion into Mozzy’s seemingly endless loop of bloodthirsty reciprocity, the music feels warmer, less standoffish. This is the first Mozzy album that could feasibly crack the radio, and it does so without compromising the integrity of his storytelling. The production adds a softer R&B sway to his usual West Coast bounce, with piano chords, lightly fingered guitar riffs, and samples of “Let Me Love You” and “Can’t Let You Go.”  The rasp in his voice eases into the occasional singsong, and as the songs grow smoother, Mozzy’s bleak worldview becomes less impenetrable. Here, he establishes himself as an unlikely role model and a champion for the lost and damned. Even his most hostile songs hide moments of tenderness: “Body Count” pads his rap sheet and offers prayers for loved ones in nearly the same breath. The hustle-hard anthem “Off the Muscle” uses brusque bars to impart simple, resonant messages. Through the huffed flows of “I Ain’t Perfect,” he ponders depression symptoms, shows compassion for the hopeless and the homeless, and describes vengeance as a flawed coping mechanism. “On Jesus Christ/Retaliation help me sleep at night,” he raps, but he still sounds weary and weighed down. God is the only force Mozzy fully trusts in, the only one there for him consistently (“I pray in the mornin’, I go get the dough, then I thank Him at night”). But despite his trust issues, he can be empathetic. On more than one occasion, he sees his aunt’s amphetamine addiction for what it is: a means to numb the pain of abuse. Near the end of “Unethical & Deceitful,” Mozzy lays down his personal code: “I was taught provide for your people/Life without parole, he’d rather die in search of freedom.” Despite the violence and mayhem depicted in his lyrics, Mozzy is clear-eyed, and at no point do the words feel gratuitously violent or like misery porn. They simply are haunting in their fidelity. If he terrifies you occasionally, that is a testament to his writing. At the end of “So Lonely,” he eulogizes seven fallen friends, and there’s suffering in his voice whenever he raps about responding in kind. Handcuffs rob boys of their innocence, painkillers fail to dull pain, and bodies keep piling up: In his songs, there are no safeguards. Beyond Bulletproof is the closest Mozzy has come to making his songs accessible. It’s hard to play the victim and the perpetrator all at once, but it’s remarkable how well he manages, and while his evolution into a hood benefactor is ongoing, his songs are already benefiting from the widened scope. It doesn’t have the immediacy of 2015’s Bladadah or the gravity of 2017’s 1 Up Top Akh, but Beyond Bulletproof is a better entry point into his massive catalog, a way to ease into his cruel reality without being overwhelmed by its darkness.","The Sacramento rapper’s new release doesn’t compromise on his bleak worldview, but the music feels warmer and more accessible.

Forever,Midwife,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1dfb83707e26f99351b56/1:1/w_160/Forever_Midwife.jpg,2020-05-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/midwife-forever/,The Flenser,"Madeline Johnston, the slowcore multi-instrumentalist who records as Midwife and Sister Grotto, found her footing as an artist while living at Rhincoeropolis, a beloved warehouse venue and artist co-op in Denver, Colorado. When local officials shuttered the space in the wake of the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship fire, Johnston and her close friend Colin Ward were two of 15 local musicians displaced. A little over a year later, Ward died unexpectedly. The back-to-back losses left Johnston feeling suffocated by sorrow, disconnected from her community in a city that no longer felt like home. She immersed herself in the songwriting process until she resurfaced with Forever, a collection of candid, minimalist shoegaze that grapples with the impermanence of life. With the barren dream-pop of album opener “2018,” she surveys the year and forces herself to accept the truth, repeating, “This is really happening” until the words go numb. There’s always been an air of detachment to Midwife’s music—2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter sounds like anesthetized Grouper—but here she sounds trapped, stuck in the purgatory of grief. On lead single “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” which sounds nothing like the Radiohead song, a hazy wash of guitar floods the air as she lies flat on her back, fixated on the desire to outrun her life yet pinned beneath the minute hand of a clock. It’s the type of warm, melancholic drone you want to pull up to your chin like a weighted blanket, and she wisely follows it with “Vow,” a heartbreaking instrumental that spaces out its lone piano chords so each one falls like a teardrop. Midwife is the rare artist who can wallow in pain without indulging self-pity. She performs her own kind of therapeutic practice on “C.R.F.W.,” a nearly nine-minute sprawl that opens with a recording of Ward reading an original poem about desire and fate, originally commissioned for the 2011 collaborative project Pure Becoming. His recitation is empathetic, spiritual, spoken in a flat tone with no audience in mind. In the final line, he compares death to a falling leaf: “Imagine the way a breeze feels against your leaf body when you finally don’t have to hold on anymore.” It’s not the poem itself that’s so remarkable, but the way Midwife follows his words with ambient drone and tectonic synth hums, turning it into a moving homage that feels like a hypnagogic meditation on the possibility of an afterlife. Johnston calls her music “heaven metal,” and Forever is heavy and hypnotic, full of nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss. But while the album begins as an outlet for grief, it grows towards zen-like acceptance of death. Closer “S.W.I.M.” capitalizes on Midwife’s strengths—blown-out fuzz, lethargic percussion, a pop of melody that appears like a daydream—to mirror her lyrics: “Treading water my whole life/I don’t want to swim forever/Reaching for the other side.” Forever is first and foremost a tribute to Ward, but its strength lies in the power of Johnston’s singular experience to unlock communal knowledge: that the mourning process never really becomes less painful, but so long as it’s inevitable, we need not feel alone.","Denver slowcore artist Madeline Johnston’s memorial to a late friend is full of barren dream-pop and hypnotic, nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss.

Mutable Set,Blake Mills,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb18d03ce714c8d7cfce7ff/1:1/w_160/Mutable%20Set_Blake%20Mills.jpg,2020-05-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blake-mills-mutable-set/,New DealVerve,"Blake Mills is a virtuoso guitarist who can’t stand the typical trappings of the phrase “virtuoso guitarist.” Even though his playing has earned him praise from boomer rock icons like Eric Clapton and Jackson Browne, the 33-year-old’s style is understated and eclectic, always in service of the song, not the ego. In his 20s, he caught the ear of Los Angeles’ songwriter intelligentsia, playing with the likes of Jenny Lewis and Fiona Apple, becoming the guy keen artists turned to when they wanted to add a layer of striking, yet subtle, musicality to their work. He could have spent his career as a secret-weapon guitarist, but he pivoted to solo work and production; his debut, 2010’s twangy Break Mirrors, doubled as a calling card that showed off his humble, affecting voice and burgeoning skills behind the boards. After producing albums for Alabama Shakes and Perfume Genius that redefined those artists’ sounds, he is now the clearest successor to turn-of-the-century studio sophisticate Jon Brion. And he brings all of that know-how, experience, and taste to his fourth LP, Mutable Set, a hushed collection that floats through the subconscious like a tender dream. Mills’ first two solo records were largely made up of country-rock tales of wounded love, sung by a rootsy obsessive who had seemingly spent thousands of hours commiserating with Bob Dylan’s Nashville Skyline, Ryan Adams’ Heartbreaker, and Wilco’s Summerteeth. They contained moments of brilliance, like the disarming and plainspoken “Don’t Tell Our Friends About Me,” a duet with Apple from 2014’s Heigh Ho, but they could also be too referential, like a graduate paper stuffed with citations yet lacking in original ideas. With Look, from 2018, he decided to remake his own sound. That album revolved around Mills’ experiments with vintage guitar synthesizers, and featured five wordless tracks that brood and flutter with the widescreen grandeur of a Terrence Malick movie. Mutable Set splits the difference between Mills’ two sides—the unassuming singer and the ambient wanderer. It’s song-based, but it’s not just another singer-songwriter record. Its arrangements are slippery, and it’s often hard to tell if what you’re hearing is a keyboard, a guitar, a saxophone, or something else entirely. It’s never clear exactly where this album will go next, but there’s no doubt an expert hand is guiding the way. Opener “Never Forever” starts where Look left off, slowly amassing a fog of tones for more than two minutes before Mills starts to sing atop a soothing fingerpicked figure. The song points out how modern human connection is so often thwarted by a society hellbent on wasting our time with the mundane, but its touch is featherlight. Here, the Southern California native trades in the drawl he used on past albums for a shrugging murmur that can recall L.A. ambassadors Randy Newman and Elliott Smith. Mills’ musings are more intriguing, and more oblique, than before too. Perhaps this is because he wrote about half of Mutable Set, including “Never Forever,” with Cass McCombs, who’s spent nearly two decades making sidelong folk-rock that always avoids the obvious. Throughout the album, the pair prove to be wonderfully complementary lyricists, with McCombs’ dark poeticism adding another dimension to Mills’ folksy groundedness. Another Mills/McCombs composition, the stunning ballad “My Dear One,” mixes the comfort of lasting companionship with existential dread. “My dear one, shelter my heart,” Mills sings, sweetly, over a lush backdrop. Then the arrangement suddenly empties, leaving only an unsettling dissonance, a lonely heartbeat thump, and a nagging creak. As the song draws to a close, Mills repeats, “The sky has grown dark.” The effect is ominous, bringing to mind a dinghy in the middle of a vast sea, with the worst still to come. Such vivid images of loss—“a bedroom with a bed that isn’t there anymore,” fish flopping on a beach ravaged by climate change—are in concert with the album’s equally spare and tactile  production. Mutable Set pours out of the speakers. It unfurls like lilies in a garden. The album was mainly recorded at L.A.’s famed Sound City Studios, where everyone from Neil Young to Nirvana cut classics, and Mills tunes it for maximum intimacy. Every bass pluck and keyboard wash, every acoustic guitar chord and string flourish is rendered with loving clarity. But Mills isn’t aiming for air-tight perfection. There are little choices, like how you can sometimes hear the moving parts of a piano chugging or fingers squeaking over guitar frets, that accentuate the overall sense of living, breathing humanity. And though Mills may not be the most naturally arresting singer, the way his somber croon sits in the mix, as if his mouth is inches from your ear, makes these mostly drumless tracks feel both eerie and reassuring. Aside from the haunting instrumental “Mirror Box,” which sounds like something Nina Simone could have sung over, the album’s only real guitar spotlight comes at the end of the six-minute centerpiece “Vanishing Twin.” As the shadowy track builds from a whisper to a rumble, Mills stops singing about a flickering doppelganger, and his guitar slowly fills the void. He proceeds to let loose a stream of feedback and mangled notes, as trilling strings prettify the air around his signal. It’s a melted solo, abstract in its power. At points, it barely sounds like a guitar at all.

Rainbow Bridge,Fire-Toolz,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1d90f7a1620531f133791/1:1/w_160/Rainbow%20Bridge_Fire-Toolz.jpg,2020-05-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fire-toolz-rainbow-bridge/,Hausu Mountain,"The music that the Chicago experimenter Angel Marcloid makes as Fire-Toolz exists somewhere at the fuzzy border between peace and pandemonium. Across the handful of albums she’s released under that name over the last half-decade, she’s made room for moments of blissed-out digital ambience, technical death-metal fantasias, glitch-scoured noise, and glossy AM radio jazz—often all slammed together within a few bars. It can feel like mayhem, but Marcloid insists her songwriting has never been self-consciously designed that way. She told AllMusic that over the last few years, her music has emerged from “a much more peaceful place,” even if it comes out gnarled and complex. “I might be making something about a serene meadow, but […] to someone who just listens to it, it might shatter their world temporarily,” she says. “That’s just how it’s going to have to be.” On Rainbow Bridge, her third Fire-Toolz album for Chicago’s Hausu Mountain, she maintains this head-spinning approach, doubling down on the extremes of her music. It’s somehow more crushing and complex than anything she’s done as under the moniker, but it’s also full of moments as tranquil and bright as anything she’s offered in her catalog. It’s a strange balance, but it’s true to the spirit of the Fire-Toolz project as a whole, which is full of pieces that feel like they’re being torn apart as Marcloid’s impulses go galloping off in different directions. The record begins in tumult with the double-kick battery of the concussive, minute-long “Gnosis .•o°Ozing.” It is bleak, bruising, and brief, but it also contains a few glimmers of an ascendant synth lead, which lends even this short, violent intro a surprising emotional complexity; there’s a sort of hopefulness embedded in its punishment. On “(((Ever-Widening Rings)))” she unleashes a series of terrifying screams over a shuffling synth piece that sounds not entirely unlike a Peter Gabriel instrumental. Marcloid has said that her fascination with metal began with proggy groups like Dream Theater and Fates Warning, bands that were more about world-building than brutality. The heavier moments on Rainbow Bridge seem designed with the same purpose in mind. They may be more transparently metal than anything Marcloid has done to date, but she’s not just trying to pummel you, she’s presenting complicated emotions for a complicated world. It’s a careful, considered exploration of a vein that’s run through her music from the very beginning. The slower moments of Rainbow Bridge are no less engaging. Tracks like “Dreamy #ex Code” evoke both the dizzy mysticism of new-age music and the burpy psychedelia of Animal Collective’s early collage experiments, while others draw on the humid jazz riffing that informed Marcloid’s record as Nonlocal Forecast. Even if any given moment is crammed with sounds, the record gives a lot of space to the serenity that she says informs her work. The record’s closer, “{Screamographic Memory}” is perhaps the most purely placid thing in her catalog: a collection of bell-like synth tones stretching and seeping into one another. It’s sweet and sunny, about as far from the thunderous terror that opens the record as you could imagine getting. Rainbow Bridge was made in part as a reflection on the death of Marcloid’s cat Breakfast, which explains in part the way the record swings back and forth between beauty and cacophony. Marcloid’s work as Fire-Toolz has always been about the way that these two emotional poles can coexist, but the way we deal with death is especially complicated. Even the most intense grief is braided with moments of peace and clarity, the beautiful memories of a life well-lived. Rainbow Bridge mirrors the intensity and the confusion of these experiences and shows that even in the direst times, it’s possible to find comfort.","On her third LP for Hausu Mountain, the Chicago experimental musician amps up the extremes of her work: It’s more crushing than ever, yet it features moments as tranquil as anything in her catalog.

Huellas Entreveradas,Beatriz Ferreyra,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1daff3707e26f99351b51/1:1/w_160/Huellas%20Entreveradas_Beatriz%20Ferreyra%20.jpg,2020-05-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beatriz-ferreyra-huellas-entreveradas/,Persistence of Sound,"For years, perhaps only the most attentive of musique-concrète listeners might have come across Beatriz Ferreyra’s name tucked away on obscure compilations. The Argentinian composer worked closely with Groupe de Recherches Musicales founder Pierre Schaeffer and served as technician on some of his 1960s compositions, but it was only when the illuminating Recollection GRM label reissued selections from her archive in 2015 that Ferreyra’s sound world came into crystalline focus for a wider audience. The rediscovery placed her alongside other belatedly appreciated female electronic composers, including Delia Derbyshire, Laurie Spiegel, and fellow GRM alum Eliane Radigue, whose pioneering work was just as invigorating as that of their more famous male colleagues. Ferreyra, now 82, has maintained her singular vision well into the 21st century. Huellas Entreveradas collects three distinct sound works created between 2001 and 2018. Much like her mentor Schaeffer, Ferreyra is an exhaustive explorer of the smallest of sounds, continually unveiling new worlds tucked inside the briefest of moments. In the previously unreleased 1978 piece “Echos,” recently issued by the Room40 label, she utilized her late niece’s breaths and murmurs to create a profound meditation on our mortality. Here, Ferreyra’s detailed approach takes a playful—but no less intimate—turn. Across the 11 minutes of “La Baballe du Chien-Chien à la Mé-Mère,” Ferreyra turns canine growls, the patter of slippered feet, and rubber-ball bounces into a surreal composition, zooming in like an electron microscope to reveal alien topographies in the most quotidian of noises. The title translates loosely as “Mommy’s Little Doggy’s Little Ball,” suggesting the loving gibberish that people use to communicate with their beloved pets. It’s a bewildering exercise in abstraction that’s also endearing and deeply strange, like watching someone hold a long conversation with their pet, then feed it a treat out of their own mouth. The longest and the most recent piece here, “Huellas Entreveradas” (“Intertwined Footsteps”) takes cues from landmark works of her venerated former colleagues, like Karlheinz Stockhausen’s “Gesang Der Jünglinge” and Iannis Xenakis’ “Diamorphoses.” It’s crafted from voice, flute, and percussion, though she strips them of their timbral familiarity and makes them into raw, startling sound. Ferreyra juxtaposes an expert sense of craft with childlike wonder throughout; the high frequencies of the flute flutter and whip about the stereo field like sparrows, only to plunge the listener into cavernous, rumbling bass tones. For nearly 15 minutes, Ferreyra guides us from the upper stratosphere down into subterranean depths and back up again, a journey that she describes in the liner notes as being like a “hike through an unknown landscape.” At the 11-minute mark, when the sounds of traffic emerge, it gives the sensation of a long-traveled nature trail suddenly opening up onto a paved road. A four-minute homage to her GRM colleague Bernard Parmegiani closes out the album. Playfully mistranslating the title of his 1977 opus Dedans Dehors (Inside Outside) as “Deux Dents Dehors” (roughly translating as “two buck teeth”), it’s about as close as high-minded electroacoustic music gets to the dizziness of a Saturday-morning cartoon. Snippets of a bright, chirpy voice and marimba (cue an animated galloping horse) get transubstantiated into more ethereal forms before toggling back toward the giddy and antic. Whether working on a scale immersive or succinct, Ferreyra’s philosophy utilizes her oblique source material to deliver a tangible emotional payoff.","The Argentinian electroacoustic composer has been exploring hidden worlds of sound since the 1960s; these three pieces, all from the 21st century, showcase her playful side.

Eastern Flowers,Sven Wunder,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb18fd17a1620531f133755/1:1/w_160/Eastern%20Flowers_Sven%20Wunder.jpg,2020-05-08 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sven-wunder-eastern-flowers/,Piano PianoLight in the Attic,"Last year, the Swedish artist Sven Wunder quietly released his debut album Doğu Çiçekleri on a freshly minted label called Piano Piano. Intentionally mysterious, the project was crafted to resemble an obscure ‘60s or ‘70s library record, the kind of purposefully anonymous mood music used by TV shows and movie houses to cheaply soundtrack their productions. In a vacuum, most library records are campy and awkward, but a select few feel like mystical accidents, cross-genre laboratory experiments that yield bizarre new life forms. Sven Wunder has successfully aimed Doğu Çiçekleri in this direction, and so it feels less helpful to describe the music as jazz or funk than to back away and simply call it heavy. The most memorable and reliable lead voice is a saz, a shimmering, sure-footed metallic sound that helps cast Eastern Flowers in a Mediterranean folk hue. Whoever is playing it is shredding, and helps give the album its restrained funk. The album clearly wants to transport you somewhere, but Wunder is refreshingly unclear about where that might be, and Eastern Flowers is never too on-the-nose about evoking rare-groove nostalgia: “Daisy” opens with some surf-rock spy-theme cliches before a saz overpowers the guitar and snowballs into  glitchy organ stabs and beeps. That surf-rock tone pops up as the pecking bass effect on “Red Rose” alongside a wah-wah that sounds like a laser. These are dramatic production choices, but Wunder submerges them into one long, lazy, bubbling groove. Things get much weirder: “Hyacinth” coaxes a polka-like trot out of a Seinfeld-theme bassline and douses it in spaghetti-western toppings. “Lotus” and “Lily” are brooding psych-folk jams, apropos of nothing else on the record. But no matter how outré the sounds get, the intensity of Wunder’s productions sneaks up on you. Many grooves dig in so deeply they seem to form a drone, an intoxicating effect that sinks in slowly over the course of the album. Snap out of it and step away, and the whole album seems to buzz in the same vibration, like a single plucked string. It’s a testament to Wunder’s vision that he’s created something so self-contained out of such wild ingredients.","On his debut, this Swedish artist submerges psych-rock instrumentals into one low, bubbling groove.

Invisible People,Chicano Batman,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea9a4b1f8ea2c000863d1c7/1:1/w_160/Invisible%20People_Chicano%20Batman.jpg,2020-05-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chicano-batman-invisible-people/,ATO,"As much as any American band, Chicano Batman represents the diversity of the American experience, the idea that no one thing exclusively belongs to any one group of people. A group of Latinos from Southern California with Central, North, and South American heritage, they grew up listening to as much Ruben Blades and Rigo Tovar as Dr. Dre and Warren G. For the past decade, they’ve honed a distinctly American take on Tropicália’s sun-drenched psychedelic grooves, evolving from the meandering jams of their eponymous debut to tightly crafted psych-funk jams with a political bent. It’s this perspective that shapes their fourth LP, Invisible People. The album’s thesis—“…a statement of hope, a proclamation that we are all invisible people, and that despite race, class, or gender we can overcome our differences and stand together”—is admittedly a bit hokey, but the songs themselves speak with considerably more nuance and wit, decrying “prophets for profit” and reminding us that race is a construct. The record’s optimism is rooted in love, the subject of most of its songs, and in its rhythm section, which makes even the most macabre tracks danceable. Because while the band has long responded to the contemporary political climate—2017’s Freedom Is Free is a direct response to the idea that it isn’t—they come from a place of perseverance, a dogged resistance to succumbing to the forces of evil. To that end, Chicano Batman songs typically start with a vibe, the pursuit of a specific feeling. Album opener “Color my Life” grew from a desire to make a song like Queen’s “Cool Cat” that boogied like Parliament. The demo for “Pink Elephant,” a song ostensibly about a predatory woman, was originally named “$40 Car Wash,” for the swagger that bassist Eduardo Arenas felt after getting an expensive car wash on his birthday. The result is a mish-mash of the ’90s hip-hop and R&B of their youth; think Ginuwine singing a D’Angelo song from a lowrider in a Warren G music video. With Chicanos. It’s a lot of fun. But Invisible People is at its strongest when it gets confrontational. On the title track,  Bardo Martinez’s croon bleeds all over the hook, and the verses plainly state axioms that only sound radical to those privileged by the status quo: “Invisible people, the truth is we’re all the same/The concept of race was implanted inside your brain….Invisible people, the truth is we take the blame/Fuck the system, it created so much pain.” It’s followed by “Manuel’s Story,” a frantic jaunt of a song driven by a spacey synth melody that belies its bleak narrative, which tells of an uncle who fled cartel violence to live in the U.S. It’s a vignette that distills the collateral damage of America’s drug war and Mexican immigration, a reminder of the people rendered invisible by capitalist political forces. Or maybe it’s just a tall tale your drunk tío likes to tell at the cookout. Whether it actually happened is mostly irrelevant. The 2020 version of Chicano Batman has evolved from its original incarnation. The influences that shaped them are still present, but their perspective has shifted; this is the first Chicano Batman LP without a word of Spanish. They’ve ditched their most distinctive visual elements, like the wedding-band-chic of their matching ruffled suits—an homage to Latin ballad groups of the ’60s and ’70s—as well as Bardo’s shoulder-length mane. But while they may have shed some of the quirks that made them unique, Invisible People is far and away Chicano Batman’s most accessible record, with big, clean hooks to match definitive statements. A decade into writing songs together, they sound stronger than ever.","The eclectic, party-starting Southern California band make their most accessible record, with big hooks and definitive statements to match.

Pure X,Pure X,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb18b18a4765fb4ce1855f5/1:1/w_160/Pure%20X_Pure%20X.jpg,2020-05-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pure-x-pure-x/,Fire Talk,"The unsubtle party drug nod, which now scans as very 10 years ago, was never the point. As Pure X guitarist/vocalist Nate Grace told Dummy in 2013, “Pleasure, ecstasy, purity—those ideas are directly related to the act of making music.” And, in the same interview, “You can’t experience pleasure without feeling pain, you cannot know ecstasy without knowing despair.” Pure X, the Austin band’s first album since 2014’s Angel, still jives with Grace’s earlier concept, in which ecstasy isn’t so much the result of listening to the music as a distant, unattainable goal or state of being. But in the six years since Angel, Grace, bassist/vocalist Jesse Jenkins V, drummer Austin Youngblood, and multi-instrumentalist Matty Tommy Davidson have further clarified their sound, creating the brightest and tightest bummer jams of their career. Album opener “Middle America” sets the scene: “Send help, I’m stranded in Middle America,” sings Grace from a Bible Belt hell they can’t escape. “Send help, I’m losing sense of who I am.” The rest of the record wrestles with finding meaning in a turbulent world, in a country where happiness—let alone ecstasy—is hard to come by. The lyrics offer flashes of beauty between the crush of the everyday. “All the neon skies are going grey,” Jenkins sings on “Fantasy.” “My people work so hard and work so long/Break and fall and disappear.” These are tunes for our times, but also seem built for age-old pursuits: nursing sweaty beers, driving through the Texas desert, diving into a swimming hole. Pure X arrives in a landscape at once parallel and vastly different from the climate of the band’s soporific first singles. Back in 2009, the recession had wildly altered the prospects of many young people. Careers were put on hold, replaced by Tecate-and-pot-filled warehouses and a DIY sensibility that lived as much on the internet as it did in clubs or practice spaces. “The first time we got on Pitchfork, I think they linked to my MySpace,” Grace told The Austin Chronicle. Much of Pure X is reminiscent of the working-class indie rock of the ’90s, when shit jobs and encroaching suburbia represented an existential threat to bands like Modest Mouse and Built to Spill. Economic uncertainty pokes out between otherwise metaphorical lyrics about relationships and personal growth. “I can’t afford the future/I don’t know my past,” sings Grace on “Making History.” “We’ve been working for nothing for so long.” Though these slice-of-life musings are sometimes dire, a feeling of patience and acceptance permeates Pure X’s 12 tracks. “I forgive myself for how I hurt myself,” goes one line in “Hollywood.” As with much of the band’s output, the music was recorded live—this time at Good Danny’s Studio in Lockhart, Texas—and carries with it a polished immediacy. Earlier in their career, Pure X had a tendency to muddy Grace and Jenkins’ voices, creating the impression they were singing from inside a hollow or behind a veil. But on Pure X, their deliveries ring clear, timbres unadulterated by fuzz or distortion. The album’s guitars, too, are more pristine, tinged with Americana or imbued with a psychedelic shimmer. Pure X’s druggy, wall-of-sound escapism put them on the map in their early days, but they sound more confident without it. On previous records, the band sometimes used synths to fill gaps between instruments, lending their sound density and heaviness. They’ve been gradually cleaning up their approach since 2013’s Crawling Up the Stairs, but on Pure X, they do more than wipe away the cobwebs; they take a Dyson to them. Bass, drums, and guitar give these songs a sparer, more intentional character. Across the album, hints of ’60s folk and lustrous ’70s rock are easy to spot. “How Good Does It Get” has a surf-rock shimmer—“How deep does love go?” wonders Grace—while “Grieving Song” matches elegiac lyrics with doleful guitars, a zombie doing the Zombies. After Angel, it was unclear if Pure X would stay together. The band members had migrated across the region, even started families. Pure X focuses less on that period of upheaval and more on the feeling of moving past it, wisened and ready for what’s next. Eleven years into their career, the smoke has cleared, leaving that age-old enemy of youth: perspective.

Roundelay,LAKE,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1dccbce714c8d7cfce806/1:1/w_160/Roundelay_LAKE.jpg,2020-05-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lake-roundelay/,Off Tempo,"Since forming in Olympia in 2005, the Washington indie pop group LAKE have carved a niche for themselves as enduring purveyors of good vibes. Along the way, they became Pacific Northwest mainstays, releasing albums on regional bastion K Records and serving as the backup band of Anacortes icon Karl Blau. It feels felicitous that one of their gentle tunes served as the closing theme for the whimsical but quietly devastating animated show Adventure Time. But LAKE have ripened with age. On their ninth record, Roundelay, the band push past their folksy twee inclinations towards the avant experimentations of early Stereolab, who themselves had roots in jangle pop. Early hypnotic highlight “She Plays One Chord” sounds like a lost Peng! cut in all the best ways: jazzy strings, cascading synthesizers, and abstract lyrics refracted through Ashley Eriksson’s dreamy warble. The self-titled opener, perhaps the brightest song to ever namedrop punk gremlin GG Allin (in addition to Mork & Mindy and Cyndi Lauper) plays with unusual time signatures and kaleidoscopic organ humming. Later on “Bubble,” the band mimics the movement of a pressure gauge, their tone shifting from droning to ebullient as they describe water erupting through the ground. LAKE is now a trio composed of Eriksson, Eli Moore, and Andrew Dorsett—each share various instrumental duties—and their music emits a steady sense of tenderhearted introspection. A glowing cover of Bert Jansch’s “Tell Me What Is True Love” snuggles right into the album’s theme of growth. On “Resolution,” a blissful tune built off a simple chord progression, Moore sings of being fulfilled by companionship, but also the occasional distance that results in growth: “It was so many days/To be away from you/But it gave us a chance/To find out who is who.” “Forgiveness” is similarly contemplative, as Eriksson wonders: “Look in your heart, what do you hold?/Do you hold on too hard to hold?” Though its tempo never drifts above a pleasant amble, “Forgiveness” incorporates horns, Vocoder distortion, and a rumbling bassline with a playfulness that recalls like-minded peers Mega Bog or Iji. Near its middle, Roundelay can feel a bit one-note, its pleasantry blurring together. The nursery-rhyming of “Don’t Pray for Me” borders on sophomoric, especially compared to the thoughtfulness of other tracks. But Roundelay picks up towards its end. “The Hanged Man” pairs ethical ponderings with ’70s AM-radio sunshine. Unlike the minimalist verses of earlier songs, “Talons & Feathers” contains an assemblage of vivid details and inside jokes—soaring eagles, overflowing wine, and matadors. But what cuts through this melange is a poignant depiction of remove: “Just like house guests/You are there, I am here/On the couch with my problems.” Roundelay can slip into languor, but the understated poeticism of moments like this prevails.","On their ninth album, the Pacific Northwest mainstays push past their folksy twee inclinations towards the avant experimentations of early Stereolab.

Old Blues,Bad History Month,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb19240a4765fb4ce1855fb/1:1/w_160/Old%20Blues_Bad%20History%20Month.jpg,2020-05-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-history-month-old-blues/,Exploding in Sound,"Most people don’t know Sean Sprecher’s name—not even his fans. The Boston-based lo-fi singer-songwriter uses fleeting pseudonyms like Sean Bean or Jeff Meff to mask his solo project Bad History Month, itself a twist on Fat History Month, his avant-folk duo. Yet his influence in the New England scene speaks for itself. Bad History Month is the one-man show that snuffs out chatter during a five-band bill. Artists like Sadie Dupuis and Krill offer eager endorsements of his music. Fans recount his lyrics like they’re quoting cult-classic TV characters, be it a sweet-toothed romantic or a guilt-ridden cowboy. His spiraling drum-and-guitar epics wring poetry from psychological breakdowns. But it’s only now, on Old Blues, his seventeenth release and the second full-length Bad History Month album, that Sprecher has revealed his real name. He’s also resigned as his own worst critic to try something new: attempting to forgive himself. Old Blues began as a concept album about the childhood immaturities we carry into adulthood: selfishness, grudges, confusion that manifests as disapproval. Across seven songs, Bad History Month analyzes previous poor judgements to imagine healthier ones. “Low Hanging Fruit” struggles to fathom others’ lived experiences as being equally real as one’s own. “Childlike Sense of Hatred” uses war (particularly the Israel-Palestine conflict) as a metaphor to explore how anger and lack of empathy fuel arguments. It’s easy to misread Bad History Month songs as misanthropic, but Sprecher knows where and when to come up for air. As he chronicles the evolution of his personal philosophy on “Want Not,” the 15-minute closer that confronts body acceptance and capitalism-induced shame, it’s clear some wounds remain open. But if Bad History Month songs are a way of holding humanity accountable, then Old Blues is Sprecher finding motivation to follow through in his own life. “Why are people terrible?” has become, “How can we fix ourselves?” Perhaps that’s why he finally felt comfortable crediting himself. Bad History Month’s self-reckoning succeeds because of its musical interplay. “The Road to Good Intentions” matches ruminations on life’s warped chronology with yawning keyboard ambience, a finger-plucked heartbeat, and an unstable tempo that suggest the soundtrack to a time-lapse video. “Childlike Sense of Hatred” flips moods with its lyrics: hesitant, acoustic guitar for hope; blown-out distortion for rage. Recorded with Fat History Month drummer Mark Fede and Dimples member Greg Hartunian, Old Blues is a careful balance of refined minimalism and raw takes, like Jim O’Rourke improvising with the Microphones while journaling. Old Blues introduces Sprecher as a grounded poet, turning his usual Bad History Month quips into curt yet detailed sentiments. Each song stems from Sprecher’s low-stakes pursuit of his own aspirations, in hopes that maybe he’s not alone in them. In opener “Waste Not,” he’s a whale “beached on the shore of a backward glance,” reminiscing about being a beach ball. Soon after, he recalls he’s neither, singing, “I’d better get to work on learning to improve/And move, and make use of my new limbs.” In these moments, it’s hard not to compare him to Silver Jews’ David Berman. “Everyone looks ugly when they’re close enough to kiss,” Sprecher sings on “A Survey of Cosmic Repulsion,” a song that began as revenge against a neighbor blasting Grateful Dead records but ends up as a rosy reflection on shared love: “Luckily for me, I’m into ugliness.” Old Blues isn’t a pity party for lingering blind spots; it’s a public call to mend them.","The Boston lo-fi songwriter’s latest project is a poetic and intensely personal rumination on selfishness, self-loathing, and self-forgiveness.

Instrumental Relics,Clams Casino,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb074aba1bcd64187eed46e/1:1/w_160/Instrumental%20Relics_Clams%20Casino.jpg,2020-05-06 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clams-casino-instrumental-relics/,Clams Casino Productions,"“Cloud rap” has been so absorbed into hip-hop’s identity that it’s hard to remember when it was subversive and new. The title of the latest installment in Clams Casino’s long-running beat-tape series implies that the tracks have been scavenged and preserved, like fading artifacts of a forgotten epoch. Michael Volpe wasn’t the only producer weaving ambient textures into trap beats at the start of the last decade—an era where experimental artists like Shlohmo and Evian Christ collaborated with the likes of Kanye and Drake—but few artists were linked as closely with the subgenre. Clams’ influence on hip-hop has remained at the elemental level; his work with rappers like Lil B, A$AP Rocky, and Soulja Boy truly shifted the sonic window. Without Clams, it’s hard to imagine Yung Lean or Drain Gang, and rap’s ongoing infatuations with the alternative rock spectrum might not be so passionate either. Clams was out there sampling Thursday in 2011, and now he works alongside a new generation who would probably not be making music without his influence: Lil Peep, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Ghostemane, and Nedarb, who credits “I’m God” as the beat that made him want to start producing. Instrumental Relics contains many of Clams’ most notable early collaborations (Soulja Boy’s “All I Need,” A$AP Rocky’s “Numb”), as well as three tracks from his Rainforest EP on the late Tri Angle records (“Treetop,” “Drowning,” “Gorilla”), an original cut from the Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack (“Crystals”), and a handful of other strays. Most were previously available and have only been remastered here, but “I’m God”—the definitive Clams Casino recording—can now be officially streamed as a standalone piece of music for the very first time. The instrumental’s unforgettable sample has gone from an unapproved flip to a full-fledged feature, with Imogen Heap credited alongside Clams Casino. “I’m God” was instantly iconic, immediately imitated, and impossible to recreate. Like Clams’ most haunting work, it decays and disintegrates inside your eardrum, more like a Burial composition than what you’d normally expect to hear Soulja Boy rapping over—the kind of thing I wish Mark Fisher had gotten to write about. For all its innovation and ethereality, there’s something timeless about “I’m God,” with drum programming that skews more boom-bap than trap, betraying Clams’ roots in New Jersey and his love of the East Coast’s classics — one of his first collaborations was with Havoc of Mobb Deep. Clams Casino emerged around the same time as witch house, a phenomenon his ectoplasm-laced compositions were often linked to. There’s no smeared eyeliner or guest appearances from Robert Smith, but it’s easy to see Clams as a slightly more uptempo kin to Salem and Pictureplane, not just in the general chilliness of his sound, but in the strong gothic undertone to his early work—that aesthetic sense of haute morbidity is maybe most evident on “Unchain Me,” an instrumental from Lil B’s I’m Gay (I’m Happy) that flips “Cry Little Sister,” Gerard McMann’s theme from The Lost Boys. Clams erodes vocals with waves of reverb and decay, like choirs crying with their mouths sewn shut, but the sample here sings out with a euphoric clarity. On his most distinctive tracks, Clams utterly destroys the human voice — fragments of human speech frozen into glass panes, fractured with echo and PaulStretch, and played backwards before being reverbed into oblivion. Clams’ approach to sampling is really only one degree away from the contemporaneous Daniel Lopatin’s Chuck Person’s Eccojams Vol. 1, a similar experiment in a more genre-friendly package. The sample on “Motivation” is like a found-footage videotape, an inscrutable object drenched in snow and noise. There were words there once, but they’ve been manipulated into a murky pool of pure texture. I know that I could go to WhoSampled and very easily found out the source of those haunting vibrations, but I’d rather entertain the mystery. As the 2010s recede, it’s increasingly apparent that some of the last decade’s most influential rap music was incompatible with the decade’s most significant shift in music technology: the advent of an endless stream of digital music that can only be accessed and never owned, a gated and guarded community that only so much inventiveness and copyright infringement can slip through. The history of hip-hop’s blog years is written in dead Mediafire links, removed MySpace pages, and uncleared samples. It’s heartbreaking to consider how many SpaceGhostPurrp loosies have been lost to virtual erosion, how much Playboi Carti music vanished when he became a label-sanctioned star and management AstroTurfed his online presence, how nobody remembers who Main Attrakionz are anymore. Beyond the sound itself, Instrumental Relics is vital because it ensures, at least for now, that these instrumentals won’t become relics.","This collection gathers the cloud-rap pioneer’s earliest and most seminal recordings, in danger of being lost to the digital ether.

800 BC,Fivio Foreign,by: Ben Dandridge-Lemco,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb0763daa1f4567491c2ced/1:1/w_160/800%20B.C._Fivio%20Foreign.jpg,2020-05-06 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fivio-foreign-800-bc/,Columbia,"Over the past few months, the phrase “demon time,” like so many pieces of localized language that eventually find their way online, has changed contexts. When Beyoncé graced the remix of Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” last week, the term found its way into the updated song’s most quotable bar: “Hips TikTok when I dance/On that Demon Time, she might start an OnlyFans.” The line is a reference to the virtual stages of an Instagram Live strip club where, in the midst of quarantine, celebrities like the Weeknd and Kevin Durant have tuned in to watch performers. It’s also a phrase popularized by Toronto rapper Tory Lanez on his Quarantine Radio live streams, where the nudity on his “demon time” segments became so constant that Instagram shut it down. But this game of digital telephone first started last summer with Fivio Foreign, who might have meant something slightly more sinister when he said he was on “demon time” on his breakout song, “Big Drip.” Over the past eight months, the Brooklyn rapper has proven himself to be an expert at, to reference another one of his favorite words, creating “viral” moments. Though he’s been releasing music since the early 2010s, his borough’s adoption of drill—an aggressive sound that has itself morphed in context, from its origins in Chicago to its outposts in London, Brooklyn, and even Sydney, Australia—has made way for Fivio’s punctuated rapping and dramatic ad-libs to cut through in his hometown and beyond. 800 BC, Fivio Foreign’s first full-length mixtape, is mostly a collection of his biggest musical moments so far. There’s “Big Drip,” the rowdy anthem that has been out for close to a year and also appeared on his 2019 Pain and Love EP; the “Big Drip” remix, with verses from Quavo and Lil Baby; and “Wetty,” a long-teased single that seemed destined to be the next hit song from the Brooklyn drill scene. “Wetty” succeeds for many of the same reasons “Big Drip” did. On the two songs, both produced by London’s AXL Beats, Fivio brings an unruly, contagious energy to even the simplest ad-libs. The song’s refrain, “I met lil’ mama in the deli/She was a wetty,” is regionally specific and original—it’s a couplet that couldn’t come from anywhere but New York, and anybody but Fivio Foreign. Still, at eight songs, the project feels lazily thrown together, with mostly forgettable songs placed around these previously released, big-ticket singles. Even when he brings bigger names into his defined sound, the results are stagnant. The verses from Quavo and Lil Baby feel like an unnecessary addition to “Big Drip,” and Fivio’s hook on “Demons & Goblins,” a collaboration with Meek Mill, sounds like it was filled in with predictive text from his most commonly used words. Similarly, “Ambition,” a song with Bronx rapper Lil Tjay, the only track on the project that deviates from the standard drill drum pattern, presents a muted version of both rappers’ strengths. One notable exception is “Issa Vibe,” a solo song where Fivio skillfully switches between melodic flows, introducing a captivating alternative to his usual hoarseness. Fivio Foreign has Beyoncé repurposing his phrases and Drake borrowing from his lexicon on a drill song, “Demons,” right alongside him. The Brooklyn rapper has channeled his entertaining personality into impactful singles, but he has yet to prove himself able to hold his concentration long enough to command an actual mixtape, or even hint at what a quality version of a fuller Fivio Foreign project might look like. Instead, at least for now, these big moments, and the way they travel up the pop-culture pipeline, are the only things that seem to stick.","Coasting on the success of last year’s “Big Drip”—which finds new relevance now that the phrase “demon time” is trending—the Brooklyn drill rapper shows personality but lacks focus.

HiRUDiN,Austra,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb189127a1620531f133751/1:1/w_160/HiRUDiN_Austra.jpg,2020-05-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/austra-hirudin/,Domino,"Katie Stelmanis has a voice like a beacon, a sound that can shear through any accompaniment, no matter how drab. She shares this power with ANOHNI and Zola Jesus, singers who enchant their surroundings with the depth and richness of their timbres, who are instantly recognizable in any setting. Her voice comprises the central pillar of her synthpop project Austra, the feature around which her music crystallizes. The Canadian artist’s previous album, 2017’s Future Politics, shifted deeper into the icy trappings of club music, laminating Stelmanis’ voice inside the production styles of deep house and trance. On HiRUDiN, Austra’s fourth LP, the project breaks from that rut, swinging for big, embodied pop moments that let the warmth of Stelmanis’ voice shine through. The most dynamic of Austra’s albums, HiRUDiN cultivates the raw pleasure of pop hooks without shying from the strangeness and discordance that has lit up the project since its 2011 debut. Live drums bolster songs like “How Did You Know?” and “Messiah” to the heights of Celine Dion’s late ’90s radio hits, a level of urgency that Stelmanis’ voice is readily equipped to handle. But even as she navigates sweeping and sugary choruses, dissonant figures prickle in the background—a stray looping whistle, the glassy shards of a synth arpeggio, the reverb on a piano chord bleeding into abrasive feedback. These bitter notes bring the sweetness of the vocal melodies into focus, making them all the easier to relish. Stelmanis brought co-producers Rodaidh McDonald and Joseph Shabason into the mix for the first time on HiRUDiN, and worked alongside Cecile Believe—the singer and writer whose presence enlivened SOPHIE’s debut album in 2018—on two of the album’s most striking tracks, the advance singles “Anywayz” and “Mountain Baby.” The latter introduces a children’s choir to the world of Austra, a move that contrasts with Believe’s trip-hoppy guest vocals but whose uncanniness ultimately locks into place. (Who better to sing about the blank innocence of new love than literal children?) These additional players open up the album until it sounds enormous and full, busily populated without losing particulate detail. Mountains serve as a recurring lyrical image, and the scope of the production matches the landscape—HiRUDiN towers, engulfing the listener. Plenty of pop music about the end of a relationship tends to project personal disaster outward: A couple breaks apart, and so does the whole world. Here, Austra takes a different tack. “Anywayz” dwarfs Stelmanis’ heartbreak, situating it within a planetary scale. “We’ll figure it out/But what if we don’t?/And the world keeps turning anyways,” she sings, her voice lifting into an upbeat hook. There is comfort—even euphoria, release—in the suggestion that her individual tragedy does not matter one bit to the world at large, that it falls away alongside so many other small sufferings as the earth keeps churning itself into the future. Flowers grow no matter how sad you are. For some, that’s an insult, a slight in the face of all-consuming, all-important sadness. For Stelmanis and her new cohorts, it’s a strange relief.","Katie Stelmanis’ fourth album swings for big, embodied pop moments without shying from the strangeness and discordance that’s animated the project since the beginning.

Sogni,Primo!,by: Shaad D’Souza,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb1df30a1bcd64187eed65a/1:1/w_160/Sogni_Primo!.jpg,2020-05-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/primo-sogni/,Upset the Rhythm Anti Fade,"In 2004, socialist feminist icon Barbara Ehrenreich offered an astute piece of advice to the women reading her work: “No matter how many degrees the experts dangle in front of you, no matter how many studies they cite,” she wrote, “dig deeper, value your own real-life experiences, and think for yourself.” This advice spoke to an often unmentioned truth: when so many of the so-called experts installed to govern the lives of women are men, every seemingly arbitrary choice becomes significant, an opportunity to escape the grip of unseen, often malevolent, forces. Melbourne quartet Primo! make music guided by an almost Ehrenreich-ian ethos: Catchy and plainspoken post-punk songs that, while not as grandly political as the anarchist polemics of scene compatriots Total Control or Terry, place significance in day-to-day choices. With their second record Sogni, Primo! sharpen their vision, continuing to write songs that find mystery and magic in otherwise-mundane life while honing in on a surreal, romantic aesthetic. Ideologically, not much has changed for Primo! since the 2018 release of their debut album Amici; their songs still speak to the drudgery of life under capitalism, and feel built from the aphorisms we feed ourselves in order to keep going. (“Onwards and upwards, say bye to the day, say bye to the night,” sings guitarist Violetta Del Conte-Race on “Comedy Show.”) Structurally, the band has expanded, bringing in Amy Hill of Constant Mongrel and Terry on bass, a change that, along with a newfound clarity in recording, rounds out the band’s sound. Stylistically, one only has to look at Sogni’s cover art to clock the shift the band has made: Where Amici’s artwork was in stark black and white, Sogni is lit up with neons, a change in palette that feels in tune with the new breadth of Primo!’s sound. Building on the synth-gilded post-punk of Amici, Sogni is artier and less linear than its predecessor, with a handful of jolting production choices—a squeaking saxophone on “Perfect Paper,” shrill vocal compression on “Machine”—deployed sparingly but effectively. The pummelling “Machine” is Sogni’s most out-and-out punk track, and one that wouldn’t feel out of place on a Constant Mongrel record. A diatribe against the increasing automation of “low-skill” jobs, “Machine” is as camp as it is bracing, the silly, Dalek-y scream of the song’s hook (“Machine! Machine! Machine!”) injecting surreal humor despite the song’s weight. Closer “Reverie” pushes the boundaries of Primo!’s style, the wandering synths that underscore the band’s chanting vocal conjuring memory of Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks score. The song that best encapsulates Primo!’s plainly philosophical spirit is “Best and Fairest.” Over Suzanne Walker’s spritely drumming, guitarist Xanthe Waite ponders the decisions one must grapple with in order to mold a good life: “What company will you be keeping?” she asks, “Who will you pay? And who will pay you?” Key words in the lyrics point to the jargon of capitalism and its associated doctrine—rich, company, pay, best—with the melancholy dream of a family floating far beneath: “Motherhood and other dreams slowly come out of hiding,” Waite sings. In this way, they are able to evoke the ruthless exceptionalism of western neoliberal capitalism without writing song-length pamphlets about it. The central metaphor at play reinforces this common touch. “Best and fairest” refers to the trophy awarded to the best player at the end of an Australian football season. No matter how skilled a player you are, you can’t win best and fairest if you’ve incurred even the most minor reprimand. The prize rewards good sportsmanship—in other words, a collectivist spirit—as much as it does talent. This is Sogni’s linchpin: the ability to seamlessly marry poetics and politics without an ounce of pretension. In the process, they conjure something galvanizing, class-conscious, and profound.","The Melbourne quartet’s catchy, plainspoken post-punk songs speak to the drudgery of life under capitalism, marrying poetics and politics without an ounce of pretension.

Dark Lane Demo Tapes,Drake,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eb04c24ce714c8d7cfce6f1/1:1/w_160/Dark%20Lane%20Demo%20Tapes_Drake.jpg,2020-05-05 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drake-dark-lane-demo-tapes/,OVO SoundRepublic,"Drake’s house is a gleaming monstrosity. Inside the 50,000 square-foot Toronto mansion called the Embassy, the rapper girdles himself with spikey chandeliers, slabs of Spanish marble, and sumptuous-looking fabrics. In one room, a shiny golden art piece constructed out of semi-precious stones occupies an entire wall. In another, beneath a microphone and requisite pop filter, there is a daybed upholstered in technicolor Jean Paul Gaultier and Louis Vuitton textiles. Dark Lane Demo Tapes, the 14-track mixtape Drake has released ahead of a proper studio album he says is coming this summer, shares the house’s gilded finish. As he toggles between a decade and several cities’ worth of rap styles, there is a consistent sheen, as though the project was furbished in the same workshop as one of his coffee tables. Though Drake has spent much of his career predicting and synthesizing trends in rap and pop, Dark Lane Demo Tapes proposes not a new sound but a new format, formalizing recent snippets, one-offs, and collaborations onto streaming services. He experimented with the mixtape as album on 2009’s So Far Gone, the album as mixtape on 2015’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, and the LP as playlist on 2017’s More Life. Last August, he dropped Care Package, a collection of songs he’d casually released or teased over the years. Billing these tracks as demos may offer the slight advantage of lowered expectations, a kind of ad-hoc market test. But it’s also a clever rejoinder to the current internet economy, in which artists like Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert have had their momentum derailed by endless leaks. The concept of the compilation may ultimately wind up being more useful in their hands than in Drake’s. Contributions from a broad range of producers—including Southside, Cardo, MexikoDro, and Axl, each representing their own little corner of hip-hop—allow Drake to travel. Earlier in his career, he likely would have tried on new subgenres like “SoundCloud rap” and transcontinental drill closer to their emergence. And yet the lag isn’t much of a hindrance. On “Pain 1993,” a Pi’erre Bourne-produced song that leaked earlier this year, Drake sounds comfortable softening his consonants alongside SoundCloud emissary Carti, even as the style is past its peak. On “Demons,” he matches the energy of Fivio Foreign and Sosa Geek, a pair of Brooklyn rappers who have been at the forefront of the borough’s drill subgenre; both sound genuinely thrilled to have earned his recognition. The single “War,” released this winter in support of longtime manager Oliver El-Khatib’s partnership with a high-end incense brand, is a spot-on UK drill track. It’s one of Drake’s most effective songs in a while, harnessing the genre’s menacing energy, barbs delivered convincingly. Demo Tapes contains moments of precise delivery, sticky flows, and hooks primed to be enjoyed in the context of an arena show, but there’s a fair amount of well-tread material, too. Drake begins the album with his tradition of pointed bars, includes a pair of slow burners with R&B vocals from Giveon and Chris Brown, and links up with Future and Young Thug for a solid, if entirely familiar song that has the tectonic bounce and clever flexing Atlanta rap has perfected. He follows that thread on the private jet anthem “Landed,” luxuriating over a spinning beat by Cardo and Dez Wright. Still, Drake remains more interlocutor than interloper. It helps that, unlike many of his peers in the top tier of the music industry, he has maintained an unwavering focus on music: “They too worried bout selling out shoes/I don’t give a fuck about jeans and crep/Or going to Milan or going to the Met/I just wanna make these songs for the set,” he rapped in a Link Up TV freestyle, in a verse ostensibly aimed at Kanye. Dark Lane is similarly a promise, or threat maybe, that he has the confidence to release music at a clip rivaled by few others at his level; as he points out on “When to Say When,” “He’s exceeded 500 weeks on the Billboard charts.” He’s a one-man monopoly, controlling both the supply and demand of his own work. But for all of Drake’s strengths, he has not evolved past the tensions that have defined this half of his career—the sulky revenge fantasies of a petulant man-child who is capable of loyalty to men but treats all women with suspicion. He remains in a suspended state of something resembling teenage boyhood, in which he is constantly aggrieved, but never accountable. As ever, Drake finds new ways of expressing escalating amounts of pettiness: Instead of snow tires and designer purses, the women he dates now want butt lifts and Lasik eye surgery. Instead of tracking their mileage on his Bugatti, he sends a friend to take back a gifted car. One song, “Desires,” features the unhinged regret that he didn’t isolate a woman he was dating so as to avoid losing her: “I should’ve put you somewhere where no one could find you/Mansion out in the sticks with nothing around you.” Drake lives in symbiosis with Kardashian-style celebrity culture, using veiled lyrics and social media posts to carefully extend or withdraw access to his narrative. Incidentally, one of the most evocative things he has written recently is the caption to an Instagram post he made celebrating his son’s birthday and sharing photos of him with the public for the first time. “It doesn’t matter what has happened in the past or what is happening around us now, you can always make the choice to break free of the wheel of suffering and panic and open up to your own light,” he wrote. The venue was appropriate for an artist whose success was formed in part on his ability to fill songs with pithy captions. But the message was a rarer thing: earnest, tenderhearted, with the focused sobriety of someone who has been meditating or studying Eckhart Tolle. Unfortunately, very little of that sentiment has made its way into his music, which remains guarded and skin-deep, even as it grows, like his houses, bigger and more expensive.","Drake’s new project is a mixtape of glossy “demos” from the recent past. It showcases his precise delivery, sticky flows, and arena-sized hooks, but comes with a fair amount of well-tread material.

Frozen,Klein,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eab3408bae33a8e8fd0b120/1:1/w_160/Frozen_Klein.jpg,2020-05-05 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/klein-frozen/,self-released,"Klein is a collagist who finds the beauty in pieces that shouldn’t fit together. Though often working with fragments of recognizable melodies—she cites both Beyoncé and Pavarotti as inspirations—the South London experimental artist isn’t interested in simply entertaining. “Anyone can do pop, innit? What sonically I want to hear for myself is stories,” she once said. Her stories don’t shy away from darkness or taboo. In her 2018 musical Care, which she wrote and starred in, she depicted a group of children living in a state-run foster home who stumble upon a Narnia-like fantasy world. She made the case that these hidden parts of our society deserve fairytales, too—albeit distorted ones. On her self-released album Frozen, she is as unflinching as ever, riding that slippage between brutal realism and escapist, meditative reflection. It is, for the most part, an intensely introspective record. On her first two albums, ONLY and Lifetime, Klein’s music was woven from the fabric of the world around her: church services, R&B songs, covert recordings of conversations between mates, and fractured snippets of drums that give the impression of standing outside a club. Her carefully controlled cacophonies stood on the fringes of dance music, but Frozen immediately feels like a more internal landscape. There are no collaborators in the credits; a number of songs were single takes recorded in her bedroom on her guitar. The murky, industrial first half is the equivalent of lying face down on your bed and letting out an existential groan. It can feel oppressive, like having the weight of the world on your shoulders. The minimalist “U got this,” 15 minutes long, hinges on a scratchy guitar riff and a rush of what sounds like traffic, and it progresses infinitesimally. Two short, jagged songs that follow break the meditative mood. “My friend I just buried him/Another grave,” Klein’s serene, somber double-tracked vocal intones on “another dust,” before reverb-drenched guitar thrashes out her anger on “grit.” Throughout, she pulls listeners in close, then pushes them away, never allowing them to get comfortable. After a half-hour stretch in which it feels like we are alone with Klein, she abruptly introduces other voices via the cut-up crowd noises of the 50-second interlude “reveal itself.” And at the record’s very end, she crashes out on a moment of dissonance with the abrupt, three-second-long “tribute.” In her most unexpected maneuver, Klein turns the lens outward on the listener. “mark” is a tribute to Mark Duggan—the man who was killed by London’s Met police in August 2011, sparking a week of riots in the UK—and 10 of its 11 minutes are silent. It’s a powerful moment, inviting listeners to reflect on Duggan’s death and the scant progress that the UK has made toward racial justice in the years since it occurred. It’s a brave move for an artist to make in a culture ruled by the skip button, and a testament to Klein’s unyielding commitment to looking directly at tragedy. Surrounding that emptiness is some of Klein’s most beautiful work. The silence is gradually replaced by a mournful guitar melody and slowed-down cries of “No justice, no peace,” which eventually blur into choral tones. With her vocals buried deep in the mix, Klein sounds ghostly. She creates a vast amount of space in the mix, giving the listener the feeling of standing at the lip of a cavern. It’s beauty with an underlying threat, always just on the brink of overwhelming, but with Klein remaining in control.","Slipping between stark realism and meditative reflection, this is the South London experimental musician’s most intensely introspective album yet.

The Mother Stone,Caleb Landry Jones,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eab2f61bae33a8e8fd0b11d/1:1/w_160/The%20Mother%20Stone_Caleb%20Landry%20Jones.jpg,2020-05-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caleb-landry-jones-the-mother-stone/,Sacred Bones,"No one plays a better creep than Caleb Landry Jones. Watch him sniff out Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out, wild and impatient, like a dog that’s just spotted a rabbit. Look at his sunken, lying eyes in Twin Peaks: The Return. Jones exemplifies the all-American boy gone sour, and most of the time, it’s unclear whether he’s pretending. “You know when you push so hard and you pop blood vessels and go unconscious a little bit?” he says of his acting. “Sometimes it’s like that, when you wake up and you don’t know where you are.” During interviews he erupts into strange, delirious laughter. You can’t watch a single YouTube clip of him without fans commenting, “Joker vibes.” The 30-year-old Texan began writing and recording music at 16, the same age he made his film debut in the Coen Brothers’ neo-Western No Country for Old Men. Over the years, he accumulated more than 700 songs. His thriving acting career pulled him away from music, until a few years ago, when he landed a meeting with filmmaker-musician Jim Jarmusch. In lieu of an introduction, Jones wrote him a piano instrumental. But they met at a diner, where there was no way for Jones to play his new piece. Instead, he slipped Jarmusch two collections of songs he’d written in his parents’ barn several years earlier, and Jarmusch connected him to Sacred Bones founder Caleb Bratten. Soon, Jones got to work on his debut album, The Mother Stone, incorporating his piano composition into the album’s title track. There’s a distinctly theatrical bent to The Mother Stone, which is framed as a “parade led by multiple unreliable narrators” who spew their monologues and then vacate the stage. In the video for “Flag Day/The Mother Stone,” stout, crimson-lipped aristocrats lounge in slo-mo, their faces plastered in Warholian neon, mouths agape like Edvard Munch’s The Scream. Sluggish carnival music intensifies the unease. Then, midway through the expansive, seven-and-a-half minute opus, a cymbal crash halts the sinister fanfare. Psychedelic guitar replaces the garish horns. Abstruse sentences escape Jones’ lips like vapor: “It takes a daffodil … to shake the jelly from the stone.” Spectral harmonies, waltzing strings, what sounds like a dog howling at the moon—all rear their heads in the opening suite. There’s something admirable about how willfully The Mother Stone defies easy listening; rarely do you encounter music this bombastic and unreasonable. (Jones cites the Beatles’ White Album as a major inspiration.) “The Hodge-Podge Porridge Poke” flips alien lasers into bluegrass fiddle. Strange voices materialize as if from a dream: a grubby croak in “Katya,” a gruff deadpan in “All I Am in You/The Big Worm.” In “You’re So Wonderfull,” Jones jauntily sings “you’re so won-der-ful” and foams at the mouth. The full tracklist is 15 items long, with several spilling past six minutes. But once you burrow deeper, the shadowy theatrics and cryptic gibberish become monotonous; these are not different characters, but the same man rambling on and on. Most of the songs—overwhelmingly sung in a nasally British whine—have the wilted grandeur of a drunk’s last hurrah. The lyrics conjure a hazy aura of doom and gloom, but they don’t amount to compelling character sketches. An ounce of clarity would go a long way towards balancing nutty remarks like, “The solitude I’ve reached has got one foot,” or, “Shakin’ like the main-frame, not warning, like they’re milking/All the sharp tanked slinkies, milling.” (According to Jones, the album’s themes include “abuse, loss, hope, the good tickle, the bad tickle, the runaway train, the perfectly timed flying bus.”) An unreliable narrator should be intelligibly so, if only for a moment. Or else why keep listening? In its dream-like exhibitionism, anachronism, and novelty, The Mother Stone is a little like Sleep No More, the immersive, Kubrikian staging of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, in which masked audience members follow silent actors around a dimly lit 1930s hotel, piecing together a deconstructed story at their own pace. Some people will indulge in the spectacle, valuing the sensory thrill over narrative coherence. Others will emerge from the multi-hour ordeal exhausted, wondering what the hell to make of the chocolate sauce and sporadic nudity. Caleb Landry Jones’ music inspires a reaction somewhere in the middle: It’s interesting, even fun while it lasts, but you probably won’t return.","The film actor’s musical debut is full of shadowy theatrics and cryptic gibberish. Rarely do you encounter music this bombastic and unreasonable.

Quiet Bloom,Minais B,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eab31806e7c12d69fed0ed7/1:1/w_160/Quiet%20Bloom_Minais%20B.jpg,2020-05-05 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/minais-b-quiet-bloom/,Anyines,"The structure of Quiet Bloom has more in common with a ballet or an opera than with pop music. On his second album as Minais B, Copenhagen composer Villads Klint values the unpredictability of emotion over neat stylistic resolution. Within a single track there might be several transitions, each one bouncing off the other in a frenetic call-and-response. There are clear leads—organ music, a pixelated take on trance, a devotional choir—but the storytelling is a law unto itself. The music of Minais B’s 2017 debut album, Deep Care, skewed closer to “distroid,” a name that musicologist Adam Harper gave to a strain of post-internet music he described as “brutal and cybernetic.” Quiet Bloom is a very different kettle of fish. Following the death of a loved one, Klint created the album away from the city, on the coast of a Danish island. “It was my first time being totally alone for two weeks, and in the cold winter of Scandinavia,” he writes in the album notes. “It was a period of extreme moods for me, but the music came out.” What that sounds like is sometimes a digital growl, a sharp inhalation, and a cloying harpsichord that’s gradually phased to the point of haziness (“Ceremony”). Two interludes, “Intermezzo 1” and “Intermezzo 2,” ground the album in a semblance of everyday life. The first features room hiss and mechanical rumbling and clicking, while the latter includes what could be the slam of a car door and the sweep of a brush on concrete. Against this pedestrian backdrop—the sound of life seemingly carrying on as normal—the album’s more mercurial moments take on greater meaning. On “Little Sun,” for example, a plucked synthetic string and resonant organ eke out some breathing space in a skeletal Baroque form before being momentarily drowned out by a demented trance arpeggio. Trance music has become a popular source material for electronic artists concerned with reexamining and recontextualizing the dance-music languages of the late 20th century. For many of today’s young European producers, it’s the music of their childhood or the scene they just missed out on. While Lorenzo Senni’s approach to trance forfeits release, in thrall to endless ascent, Minais B zooms in so close that he cracks the lens. What’s refracted on “Where We Meet” is a crosshatch interpretation of a build complete with choral underpinnings, its surface ecstasy revealed to be a mishmash of desire and alienation. The reflex of Quiet Bloom is to simultaneously reach toward and away from itself; the kind of dance that dealing with loss demands. Where the album really shines is when its ambiguous motion is given the space to run wild. The two longest tracks, ”Weaver” and “Magnolia,” unfold in a balletic display of potent gestures and dramatic twists and turns. Organs provide familiar sentimentality on both tracks, yet are spliced in such a way that they emancipate rather than overpower. Quiet Bloom does not deliver a tidy narrative about the processing of grief. What makes it such a riveting listen is that it allows each fluctuating feeling some time in the sun.","Created in a period of grieving, Danish electronic composer Villads Klint’s second album mimics the messiness of feelings in flux, pairing everyday sounds with hints of trance and Baroque.

Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase?,The Soft Pink Truth,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea88483895a1b000858e6d3/1:1/w_160/Shall%20We%20Go%20on%20Sinning%20So%20That%20Grace%20May%20Increase?_The%20Soft%20Pink%20Truth.jpg,2020-05-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-soft-pink-truth-shall-we-go-on-sinning-so-that-grace-may-increase/,Thrill Jockey,"Last year, Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt celebrated 25 years of mad-genius musical experiments as Matmos with a Plastic Anniversary—an album recorded entirely using plastic. That’s how Matmos albums work; a concept that might seem silly or crass at first glance is backed by a mountain of research, executed with passion and, in that case, ornately recorded using a parade of PVC pipes, riot shields, and breast implants. Since 2001, Daniel’s side-project the Soft Pink Truth has run parallel to Matmos, applying similar twists to the dancefloor. Yet nothing in either project has presaged Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase?, a cathartic, emotional windfall unlike anything Daniel has ever recorded. Daniel thought hard about how to process the anger and despair born out of a worldwide resurgence of fascism and the election of Donald Trump. Instead of making reactive “angry white guy” music, he sought to make life-affirming, healing music founded in community. So he gathered his friends and family, including Schmidt, Horse Lords saxophonist Andrew Bernstein, percussionist Sarah Hennies, and a world-class trio of vocalists: Angel Deradoorian, Colin Self, and Lower Dens singer Jana Hunter. There’s no concept, no edgy sound-sources; its instruments are simply instruments, arranged with a small orchestra of collaborators who generate a huddled warmth against an increasingly cold, dark world. The resulting Shall We Go On Sinning carries itself with the strength of a soft prayer, masterfully fusing jazz, deep house, and minimalism into an enormous, featherlight shield. Daniel built the album’s nine tracks to flow as two pieces, mixed seamlessly while using a bit of tape delay to unify each peak and valley. “Shall” opens the album with an invocation, as Deradoorian, Self, and Hunter create a choral round singing the titular question, itself an exasperated quote by Paul the Apostle from Romans 6:1. It acts as a focal point of tension, a summoning of negative energy that is exorcised as the chorus shifts on “We” to outward breaths and then long, silky sighs. A glowing synth loop razes any remaining darkness and as the beat drops in, “We” unfurls luxuriously into a deep house odyssey. It’s the first of many spontaneous surprises the album delivers. The rush of glockenspiel on “Go” provides a cleansing transition to the crashing waves of “On,” one of the album’s most soothing corners. Centered around repeating piano chords by pianist Koye Berry, the vocalists fuse into a singular force as Daniel manipulates the edges of the track with mercurial touches. It’s a soothing moment that sets up “Sinning,” a centerpiece for Bernstein and John Berndt’s dueling saxophones as bells, handclaps, and a pulsing bass gradually build up. Though its arrangement feels classical, “Sinning” flows like the sexy, sweaty peak of a house mix. The second half—“So That Grace May Increase?”—offers its own momentous trajectory. Schmidt joins on piano, developing the central riff on the hypnotically swirling “So,” as horn loops, chanting voices, and percussion fold in on “That.” Daniel’s mixing here is phenomenal, giving each carefully crafted element—the forward swing of the percussion, the warmth of the brass, a garbled tape-looped voice—a moment to shine. Schmidt returns with a tip-toed piano solo on “Grace,” offering a delicate misdirection before the track suddenly explodes into a final, euphoric climax. The album rides this soul-lifting shock to its conclusion, a cathartic gift so breathtaking it rises to the occasion of this moment, that moment, seemingly any moment we have yet to face. Daniel started the Soft Pink Truth on a dare from UK house legend Matthew Herbert. Matmos just had a breakthrough with the surgery-sampling A Chance To Cut Is A Chance To Cure, while Herbert fused jazz, house, and the human form to create Bodily Functions, one of the most revered and intimate club records of all time. The dare suggests Herbert, who released the Soft Pink Truth’s first albums on his Soundslike label, heard something special in Daniel beyond even the visionary work of Matmos. Nearly 20 years later, that provocation has inspired what feels like a successor to Herbert’s own masterpiece while perfecting themes running throughout the Soft Pink Truth. On previous albums, Daniel reckoned with homophobia in black metal or celebrated punk’s queer history. Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? opens its scope to a harsh world where being gay and thriving is itself an act of defiance. It stares down an apocalypse and fights back with joy, hope, and human connection.

Oh Yeah? / Brave Rats EP,Sunwatchers,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea8934d895a1b000858e6d4/1:1/w_160/Sunwatchers_Oh%20Yeah?.jpg,2020-05-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sunwatchers-oh-yeah-brave-rats-ep/,Trouble in MindDrones Against Drones,"Like a squad of beaming cheerleaders, New York quartet Sunwatchers spend much of their working lives cultivating pure joy. Especially on their fourth album, the devoutly playful Oh Yeah?, they deal in sax-and-guitar melodies so bright and rhythms so relentless they feel eternal. They pirouette through opener “Sunwatchers vs. Tooth Decay” with the gusto and precision of a professionally choreographed laser-light spectacle. Halfway through “Love Paste,” which lifts from a gleeful klezmer dance into an instrumental hook so big it could have belonged to Yes circa 1972, they shout “Whoo!” in gleeful unison. Hearing this sort of unbridled, earnest enthusiasm just feels good. However radiant, though, Sunwatchers have forever ferried political messages of resistance and persistence. “Sunwatchers stand in solidarity with the dispossessed, impoverished, and embattled people of the world,” they broadcast on the cover of their second album, a credo they’ve repeated with every subsequent release. Their mascot—the Kool-Aid Man, absurdly clad in Braveheart body paint—lorded over Uncle Sam’s mutilated corpse on 2019’s Illegal Moves. They fantasize in interviews about making the music that destroys capitalism and vow in liner notes to “forge an atmosphere of radical empathy and acceptance.” Sunwatchers’ rippling music works, then, much like American gospel or hardcore: It fights the power by flexing solidarity and responds loudly and triumphantly to existential terror. Oh Yeah? is vivid and boisterous. Burrowing between chiptune’s glee and doom metal’s glumness, “Thee Worm Store” conjures images of a video-game hero barely escaping the clutches of a particularly baleful boss. “Brown Ice” feels like the score for a movie montage where ardent young revolutionaries make their final preparations to overthrow the government, gathering supplies and scheming by lamplight. They’ve never been better than on “The Earthsized Thumb,” an extended anthem for overcoming the seemingly insurmountable. For the first 13 minutes, Sunwatchers repeat and revolve around a single bracing theme, circling it like an obstacle they can’t overcome. But then alto saxophonist Jeff Tobias has had enough. He screams into his horn like Sunwatchers’ inspiration Albert Ayler, his tone providing the call to arms. The band springs into action for the odyssey’s final quarter, beating the theme into submission with a synchronized assault. It’s impossible not to feel emboldened by it. On Brave Rats—a subsequent six-track EP, consisting of alternate versions and live renditions of old favorites, plus a few catalog obscurities—Sunwatchers relax their guard, or at least the need to sound so triumphant. Yes, they erupt into a jubilant clatter during “Everybody Play!” and dance through Sonny Sharrock’s “Blind Willie” with the élan of Akron/Family during those fleeting moments when they seemed like the country’s next great jam band. But mostly, they allow the anxiety and pessimism they typically funnel into rapturous hooks and ecstatic waves of improvisation to stand alone. It’s like watching a seasoned pop star dazzle a sold-out arena, then collapse backstage and confess how they really feel. “Sazx,” a rhythm-less duet for Tobias’ yearning horn and Jim McHugh’s jarring guitar, suggests a nightmare driven by a waking loop of self-doubt so extreme it haunts you in your sleep, too. Closer “Pedal One,” a scrap from an old soundtrack, pulses like Steve Reich slowed by Dilaudid, drugging the urban busyness of his work until it scans as dread. Even the magnetic hook and road-trip esprit of “Brave Rats” can’t camouflage the despair in Tobias’ brittle saxophone tone or the menacing keyboard notes that line the track like rusty razor blades. The first several times I heard Oh Yeah?, I pined for something like one of the bummers on Brave Rats, a song that made clear the complex emotions and revolutionary urges at play. Sunwatchers have touched on that feeling in the past, particularly with Illegal Moves. But as the weeks passed and the world changed, the album’s sense of unfettered joy—of shouting down misery simply by playing together—became reassuring to revisit, a reminder of the energy a band and audience can share in a crowded concert hall. A studio album that moves with the delight of a live explosion, Oh Yeah? is even more welcome at a time when that kind of catharsis is temporarily out of stock.","With a joyous new album, the New York jazz-punk quartet responds loudly and triumphantly to existential terror. Its follow-up EP lets their true feelings show.

Chaotic Good,Johanna Warren,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea886739c8ca90009f7f3c2/1:1/w_160/Chaotic%20Good_Johanna%20Warren.jpg,2020-05-04 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/johanna-warren-chaotic-good/,Wax NineCarpark,"A quiet rage simmers beneath Johanna Warren’s first four albums. You can hear it in the way she fries her voice on “A Bird in the Crocodile's Mouth,” or the distant, uneven percussion of ""Here to Tell,"" which sounds like angry footsteps growing closer. It’s there under the abundant beauty of her mostly acoustic earlier work, which inspires calm and dread in equal measure. On her latest full-length, Chaotic Good, Warren lets that rage erupt to the forefront. If the Oregon-based singer-songwriter’s music can be slotted neatly beside the lunar environments of Julianna Barwick and Grouper, women who take distance as a primary emotive strategy, she also finds a deep kinship with the work of Elliott Smith, the late folk-rock songwriter who sublimated anger into taut and compelling pop. Smith knew when to subdue his compositions and when to ignite them, when to whisper through gritted teeth and when to open  into a full-hearted yelp. Warren’s study of these gestures shows more clearly than ever on Chaotic Good, which evinces Smith’s influence on the brisk, rolling guitar chords of “Part of It” and on the close-whispered vocals of “Every Death.” Alongside Smith’s echo, bolder, brasher notes of Hole and Liz Phair also peek through—’90s contemporaries of Smith who indulged their anger playfully, in ways that tore up the scripts for women artists at the time. Warren often multitracks her voice to create a chorus of one, adding depth and dimension to her striking soprano. On Chaotic Good, the first of her albums she’s produced on her own, there’s a moment where she pitches that common technique into overdrive. It comes on a song called ""Twisted,"" a heavy exorcism of a troubled relationship. Against a throbbing guitar progression and a simple rock drum beat, Warren's voice ascends to a breaking point. “I give up/I give up/I gave it my all,” she howls at the song's climax, her voice splitting the last syllable open into a paralyzing shriek. Chaotic Good is an album about recognizing and deprogramming your codependent tendencies, the habit of needing a partner to feel whole. The ‘90s touchstones Warren calls upon often explored similar themes, excavating the ruins of relationships and trying to reassemble the self in their midst. “I wanted you to stay/And I wanted you to leave/Each day it’s a little harder to believe,” Warren sings on the gorgeous, sloping ""Bed of Nails,” a song where her transformation from shadowy folk songwriter to rock bandleader comes into clearest view. The space around her opens up, and more instruments join the fold, bolstering her sound with adrenaline and grit. The change fits the subject. As much as leaving a soured relationship can feel lonely, like the entire world has been compressed into the space of your own skull, the aftermath is often a communal rite. You call out to others to bear witness to what you’re leaving behind, to reestablish yourself in the social fabric. You quit codependence for interdependence, and then, eventually, independence, having learned to stand on your own two feet in a crowd. It’s a painful process, often an angry one. And then the fire finishes burning, and the nearby ground is clean.","The Oregon-based singer-songwriter's taut new album channels the wounded spirit of Elliott Smith.

Harkin,Harkin,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea889189c8ca90009f7f3c3/1:1/w_160/Harkin_Harkin.jpg,2020-05-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/harkin-harkin/,Hand Mirror,"For the past few years, Katie Harkin has been busy greasing other people’s wheels. When her old band Sky Larkin called time in 2014 after three albums of charming, lo-fi fuzz, she carved out a new career as a gun for hire, joining Sleater-Kinney, Courtney Barnett, and Kurt Vile on tour and playing on Waxahatchee’s 2017 LP Out in the Storm. That’s half a decade working in the shadows—unlike rowdy children, background players are supposed to be heard but not really seen—which makes the way Harkin finally steps forward on her self-titled debut feel like an extra striding into center stage and bursting into a lengthy soliloquy. That’s not to say that Harkin’s jagged, whirring indie rock represents some soul-baring confessional years in the making; listening to its vivid yet impressionistic vignettes is more akin to trying to get to know someone by sifting through a jumble of their candid Polaroid snaps. But it does capture a unique tension. Harkin slowly stitched the album together during a period of time split between touring, staying in New York, and hunkering down in the UK’s picturesque Peak District, and she often sounds as if she’s being dragged in different directions across its 10 songs. The geographical references span from her native North of England to Chicago and Missouri, chronicling the push-and-pull between wanderlust and fatigue, restlessness and sluggishness, blurry days and electric evenings. “No coordinates!” she yelps on “Up to Speed,” undercutting the song’s sweet melody with a scuzzy riff that exudes the fuggy confusion of too many late nights, as her nomad’s life spirals into a rut of scuppered plans and crash pads. Thankfully that second-guessing doesn’t slacken her songwriting, which coats Sky Larkin’s bright, fidgety din with a sleeker, after-dark sheen. Like most people who came of age in sleepy country suburbs, Harkin grew up enraptured by the way quiet days gave way to transformative nights out, and the best cuts here are charged with a similar witching-hour magic. “I know what love is/Love is a nighttime fight,” she croons over the shimmering rush of “Decade,” a gracious reflection on old memories and mistakes made after the sun went down. On “Nothing the Night Can’t Change,” she fizzes with the nervy, stomach-flipping thrill of seeing your crush at the end of a boring day. “Your eyes, they widen at night just like mine,” she sings, high enough on fumes of lust and adventure to shrug off the naysayers insisting it won’t last. Harkin is most alive when it sprints with that sense of speed and purpose, surging with adrenaline and sparking with twilit excitement. The one or two songs that stumble into a medium-paced chug, such as the choppy, stop-start “Bristling,” lack that same jolt of energy and come off pedestrian in comparison—yet it’s actually only when things really slow down that some of the record’s most beguiling textures emerge. Stella Mozgawa’s splashy drumming underpins whirlpooling guitars and synths on the woozy, Warpaint-ish “Dial It In,” while the fragile strum of “New France” takes on a strangely wispy beauty thanks to its cloudy electronics. “Red Virginia Creeper” shares its name with both an American plant and an Edvard Munch painting, but Harkin twists its shrill whistles and sticky keys into something that instead hums with the eerie, stultifying haze of the English countryside, until it sounds like she’s scoring a pastoral fever dream. Having an address book as fat as Harkin’s could never be called a hindrance, but it does inevitably magnify any lingering traces of those she’s worked with before, most notably the thrumming urgency of Sleater-Kinney and the playful wordiness of Wild Beasts, who she moonlighted with while still in Sky Larkin. But for the most part, those elements are shaped into something her own. On the twisting, tuneful post-punk of “Mist on Glass,” its guitars racing on a never-ending loop like souped-up slot cars, an awkward spat blows up into a full-blown culture clash. “Does my Calderdale sentiment/Ring out in American ambient?” she asks, worried that her no-nonsense Yorkshire dialect has been lost in translation or, worse still, corrupted by a new environment. On Harkin, at least, there’s no danger of her voice not cutting through.","After a few years as an indie-rock hired gun, the former Sky Larkin singer assumes center stage on her solo debut, chronicling the push-and-pull between blurry days and electric evenings.

Mellow Gold,Beck,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea862138269b8000899328e/1:1/w_160/Mellow%20Gold_Beck.jpg,2020-05-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beck-mellow-gold/,DCG,"If you were around to hear Beck’s “Loser” in the early 1990s, you probably felt the plates shift a little. Maybe you heard it on local radio in Los Angeles, where it arrived without context or marketing. Maybe you heard it in Seattle, where, six months after Beck had ad-libbed it in a cramped living-room studio, it became the most requested song on KNDD’s nightly People’s Choice Countdown, beating out the most recent single by Pearl Jam, who at the time may as well have been on the city’s tourism board. Or maybe you, like me, heard it on MTV, where it seemed like a cool breeze blowing through the abstract pain of mainstream alternative music. When, in July, 1994, an interviewer from Spin magazine suggested that Beck’s backstory—poverty, an 8th-grade education, bouts of borderline homelessness—felt like fodder for darker sentiments, Beck, 23 and blindsided by his own new fame, pitched his voice up and whined, “You just gotta rage against the appliance, man. The toast is burning, and you just gotta rip it out and free it before it fills the house with smoke.” For Vedder, hearing “Loser” lap you on the radio must’ve felt like getting hit in the face by trash thrown from a passing car. Much of Mellow Gold was recorded in the home studio of a guy named Carl Stephenson. By “home studio,” I mean a tape recorder set up in such a way that Beck later remembered having to finish vocal takes before Stephenson’s girlfriend wanted to get in and cook dinner. Stephenson had grown up playing in youth symphonies around Olympia, Washington, before quitting his grocery-store job and moving to Houston to work at Rap-A-Lot Records, then home to the Geto Boys. Rap-A-Lot was hardcore; Stephenson was not. He loved watching DJ Ready Red strip samples from old funk and soul records, but he was uncomfortable with the violence and misogyny of the material. He soon moved to Los Angeles, where he struggled to plant his homey, psychedelic productions in an increasingly gangsta market. The way Stephenson remembers it, Beck Hansen was a street busker with a bad haircut. But he had a mischievous sense of creativity and no attachments to his own artistic self-image, and when Stephenson—alongside co-producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock, who ran the small Bong Load label—suggested they pair his rudimentary folk songs with Stephenson’s loops and grooves, Beck went with it. After all, he liked rap—the immediacy, the beat, the sense of performance. In the same Spin interview where he raged against the toaster, he remembered the communal warmth he felt as a teenager riding the bus on L.A., hearing Grandmaster Flash playing on some kids’ boombox from the back, how people from all different parts of the city seemed to absorb the sound, some even getting up to dance. Mostly though, fashioning himself as a kind of rapper was a chance for Beck to undermine the sanctity of what it meant to be a white guy with an acoustic guitar. That he understood hip-hop as an extension of folk music rather than a betrayal of it—the way rap spun meaningful, entertaining stories out of everyday life using equipment anyone could get their hands on—felt insightful, even subversive, especially at a time when we were starting to digest the reality that grunge was just classic rock after all: the same quest for glory, the same macho, self-serious dream. In press coverage from the time, you can feel the ache of boomers hungering for the next Bob Dylan, but in reality, Beck was more like Tone Lōc or Mississippi John Hurt, or an asexual cousin to the Beastie Boys: a funny, self-styled dope just geeking out on the scene. Compared to the rest of its 1994 class—Green Day’s Dookie, Nine Inch Nails’ The Downward Spiral, Hole’s Live Through This, Soundgarden’s Superunknown, and Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged in New York—Mellow Gold was both weirder and lower to the ground. It could be direct—the roughness of the production, the visceral noise of some of the songs—but obscure, too, a knot of words that didn’t immediately register as metaphor or reality. And as vivid as it was, it also felt magically displaced in time. The compacted ’70s soul of “Fuckin’ With My Head” and “Sweet Sunshine”; the deadpan folk of “Nitemare Hippy Girl” and “Steal My Body Home”: listening to Mellow Gold was like finding a fossil from the future. Part of the fun and frustration of encountering Mellow Gold was figuring out what, if any of this, Beck took seriously. His mother, Bibbe, had been in some Andy Warhol movies and later played in a band called Black Fag with the drag performer Vaginal Davis. His grandfather, Al Hansen, was a member of Fluxus, a conceptual art group whose most well-known pieces—Hansen’s Yoko Ono Piano Drop, for example, in which a piano was pushed off a five-story building—functioned less like art than an attempt to make the viewer confront what they think art is in the first place. Mellow Gold wasn’t quite so high-concept, but Beck certainly seemed more interested in the currency of cultural images than the supposed truths of his own dark mind. That said, if you were the kind of listener who heard lines like “my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite who’s choking on the splinters” as nonsense instead of poetry, he was your ideological punching bag come to life, a portrait of the artiste as the charlatan who throws shit at the wall and leaves it to you to figure out what it means. The funny thing about his classification as a “slacker” was just how hard the content of his music could be. Where punks of generations past responded to dwindling prospects with angst, the slacker supposedly shrugged. Like the millennial 25 years later—another figment of the warped boomer mind—the slacker was ultimately anchored by entitlement: They didn’t not-perform because they couldn’t, but, like Herman Melville’s famous protagonist, Bartleby, because they preferred not to. And yet here we have a piece of supposedly quintessential slacker art that is mostly about jobs: working them, losing them, the cyclic ruin that comes from not being able to get one and the capitalistic grind that keeps those clinging to them underfoot: “I was born in this hotel/Washing dishes in the sink” (”Whiskeyclone, Hotel City 1997”); “Fourteen days I been sleeping in a barn/Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm” (Soul Suckin’ Jerk”); “I quit my job blowing leaves/Telephone bills up my sleeves” (“Beercan.”) Even when work isn’t in the picture, poverty is the frame. The stories on Mellow Gold take place in trailer parks and subsist on credit and suitcases of cheap beer. They are ground-down, washed-up and loving it, “dancing on the roof, shootin’ holes in the moon.” The music sounds like junk because junk is what he sees from his window. And the punchline of “Loser” isn’t that he lost, but that he didn’t have a chance in the first place. Listening to Mellow Gold, I’m always left with the same image: A child at play in the ruins of a dying world. “Tonight the city is full of morgues,” goes the first line on “Pay No Mind,” “and all the toilets are overflowing.” We’re at song two. (Or, as the tape-warped vocal at the beginning of the song puts it, “This’s song two on the album. This is the album right here. Burn the album.”) Between here and there lies mountains of garbage and unpaid bills, the purgatory of menial work, screaming neighbors and rivers of shit and the well-moisturized ghouls who profit from it all and tell you it’s fine. Where some writers synthesize their inner worlds from the insulation of an armchair or desk, Beck seemed to be out there with rubber gloves and a second-hand hazmat suit, bagging up southern-rock compilations and rap mixtapes, reporting live from the brink with a crappy dictaphone. By the time I make it to “Nitemare Hippy Girl”—her giant tofu, her radiant self-obsession—it doesn’t sound like a diss, it sounds like a safe haven. Maybe even a koan: If the world ends outside your window but you’re too stoned to notice, does it still end? I’ll spare you the fairytale about how this album helped make mainstream music better or more interesting. It did seem like good things came from it, including widening the avenues of conversation between hip-hop and indie-rock, and a weakening of distinctions between what was considered alternative and what was mainstream. In the years to come, labels like Matador, publications like the Beastie Boys’ Grand Royal, bands like Cibo Matto and Cornershop and even Björk and Air all made the kind of cultural omnivorousness Beck demonstrated feel like part of a general push away from old myths toward something more eclectic, more effervescent, maybe even more feminine. And as a young white man, I have to say it felt good to see someone up there who wasn’t so invested in their own darkness, especially with Kurt Cobain pointing to where all that darkness went. Mellow Gold was actually one of three albums Beck released in 1994: Another, One Foot in the Grave, was a lo-fi album of blues and folk, while Stereopathetic Soulmanure—released a week before Mellow Gold—was more fragmented, noisy, and tossed-off. Both, ironically, produced songs later covered by the kinds of classic-rock standbys whose universality Beck seemed to offer an alternative to: “Asshole” by Tom Petty, and “Rowboat” by Johnny Cash. They are both great songs, two of his best, as is “Satan Gave Me a Taco,” in which a luckless young man gets food poisoning from Satan only to discover that his life is in fact a music video. After an odyssey ascending the mountain of fame he is committed to hell, where he starts a taco stand with Satan—“just to smell the smell.” You could hear the old blues there, the big American yarn of hustlers and idiots and someone trying to sell something and someone else getting his ass burned. Years later, Spin would call Beck a generation’s consolation prize after the death of Kurt Cobain. But I always heard him as more of a cheerleader, maybe even a coach. Yeah, the world’s a trash heap. Let's climb it and watch the sun set.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Beck’s ramshackle 1994 album, a quintessential piece of alternative rock, experimental folk, and hip-hop that felt magically displaced in time.

Roaches 2012-2019,Dean Blunt,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea85f7997cf670008c84ab4/1:1/w_160/Roaches%202012-2019_Dean%20Blunt.jpg,2020-05-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dean-blunt-roaches-2012-2019/,World Music,"Dean Blunt started the decade challenging small audiences and ended it collaborating with A$AP Rocky and Panda Bear. At the same time, he created a body of work as distinct as it is varied, inventing a niche somewhere between post-punk provocation and dub experiment. As a semi-public figure, Blunt is restless and acerbic, willing to change allegiances at the drop of a hat and pull stunts that are simultaneously thrilling and idiotic. He sent an impostor to collect his NME Award, sold a weed-filled toy car on eBay, and released unlistenable noise as Babyfather. His propensity for gags can make it easy to dismiss the rigorous craftsmanship of his work. Yet Blunt sculpts infinite soundscapes littered with indecipherable messages; his songs are simultaneously archives of past genres and transmissions from the future. This ecumenical approach and DIY prankster spirit animates his latest release, Roaches 2012-2019, a collection of solo and collaborative pieces from the past decade. Blunt’s first official solo compilation rejects genre and attribution in favor of nuance and theme in an album-length argument for mongrel pop. The YouTube one-offs and previously unreleased tracks collected here traverse the universes that make up Dean Blunt’s discography. Unlike fan-made compilations or those Blunt has leaked via WeTransfer, this compilation, released through his World Music label, serves as an official archive and survey of the work he’s made in the past seven years. Album opener “Felony” and the bristling “Acts of Faith” take their cues from the cinematic string and beat structure of solo releases like 2014’s Black Metal and 2013’s The Redeemer. The smoldering duet “Neva,” which pairs Blunt with singer Poison Anna, recalls Blunt and Inga Copeland’s broken ballad “The Narcissist.” The tragic street narrative and thudding goth-rock sample in “Trident 2” wouldn’t sound out of place on Babyfather’s 2016 album BBF Hosted by DJ Escrow. The numbered “Benidorm” tracks are short, experimental sound samples that bring to mind the interstitials on 2012’s Black Is Beautiful, while the “Nitro Girls” songs with Joanne Robertson mimic the stripped-back acoustics of the pair’s recent collaborations. Taken together, they form a miniature history of Blunt’s development, a survey of the many ad-hoc genres he’s created over time. Steeped in post-punk and reggae, Blunt uses both genres to convey his particular desperation. “Prayer 2015” is post-punk taken back to its reggae roots; Blunt creates a dub version of Shellac’s “Prayer to God” by muting Steve Albini’s vocals and keeping the propulsive rhythm section of the original song. Adapting the technique of a Jamaican dub producer like Big Joe, he strips the song to its essentials, using the remaining foundation as a backdrop against which to modulate and delay his voice. Limited by his vocal range and distorted by reverb, lines like, “Here is my prayer to the one true God” gain added urgency as they fall in time with the militaristic march of the drums. In his monotone ad-libs, Blunt acknowledges the song’s debts to previous genres: “Here is my prayer… Jah!” When a speaker on “Sicko freestyle” says, “We made a culture, niggas,” it could be the manifesto for Blunt’s approach: If black music underlies all pop music, then is any part of pop off-limits to the black artist? If all cultural gradations are artificial, then why maintain any separation? It’s this sense of possibility that frees Blunt to fragment Prefab Sprout’s “Cue Fanfare” into the mumbled “Lit freestyle,” which sounds as though it were taken from the same Babyfather recording session that produced “Skywalker Freestyle” out of Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights.” Blunt’s fascination with reimagining the past has been present since the start. You can hear it on “The Throning,” a 2010 single by Hype Williams (a group then composed of Blunt and Copeland). It starts out as a vaporwave cover of Sade’s “The Sweetest Taboo,” then morphs into hazy techno reminiscent of Carl Craig’s More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art in its final 30 seconds; it’s both pop parody and pop devotional. Depending on your viewpoint, Blunt is a charlatan or a perpetually dissatisfied perfectionist. Roaches offers a map of the roads he’s taken and a peek at those he didn’t: On “N Then She Said I Need to Tell U Somethin N Dont Hate Me for It...,” a seven-minute dirge filled with MIDI harmonica, we get a glimpse of Dean Blunt the prog-rock frontman. Steeped in personal and musical history, the collection is as conflicted as its creator. It’s simultaneously political and apolitical, conscious yet contemptuous of race, focused and impatient. Roaches 2012-2019’s series of artifacts contains Blunt’s vision for the future.","The singular experimentalist’s first official solo compilation traverses the universes that make up his discography, rejecting genre and attribution in an album-length argument for mongrel pop.

ALPHABETLAND,X,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea85a50895a1b000858e6cf/1:1/w_160/Alphabetland_X.jpg,2020-05-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/x-alphabetland/,Fat Possum,"This month, the venerated Los Angeles punk rock band X opened a window that had been shut for 35 years, returning with their first new album featuring all four original members since 1985. They released ALPHABETLAND early, while X fans are quarantined inside and waiting for refunds for the Los Angeles 40th-anniversary tour the band was set to embark on this month. A quick glance at the tracklist reveals instant fan service. “Delta 88 Nightmare,” first released on the 2001 reissue of Los Angeles as a demo, gets a proper recording. Its 100 seconds of vintage X fury is kicked off by guitarist Billy Zoom’s rockabilly lick, blazing like an Eddie Cochran LP mistakenly played at 45 RPM while Exene Cervenka and John Doe shout in unison, invoking John Steinbeck’s 1945 novel Cannery Row. Even though the reference is a literary one, based on Depression-era Monterey, California, it’s easy to transpose the imagery to X’s version of Los Angeles, Doe and Cervenka stumbling drunk down back alleys, past the “cute resort with dads and moms/Staring at us and making fun.” “Cyrano de Berger’s Back,” another Los Angeles-era demo that the Zoom-less X recorded for 1987’s See How We Are, gets the version it always deserved. Zoom funks up the verses with some chunky upstrokes and the production from Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Saves the Day) gives the song—written during Doe and Cervenka’s courtship, recorded after their divorce, and presented as intended here—an emotional weight it was never previously afforded. “I got ten arms for you,” the former couple harmonizes, as beautifully as ever, even though the words mean something different 40 years later. “Ten hearts all beating blue.” X certainly played with its sound across records—even going pure country as the Knitters for a pair of albums—but ALPHABETLAND is a return to the X of the early 1980s. On “Free,” Zoom’s rhythm guitar part dances in-between drummer D.J. Bonebrake’s toms as Cervenka finishes Doe’s phrases. It’s a jangly mid-tempo rocker that peaks with Bonebrake repeatedly slapping the bell on his ride cymbal as forcefully as he did on “We’re Desperate” and “I’m Coming Over,” from 1981’s Wild Gift. “Lemme go free/Don’t tell me I can’t,” Doe pleads. The lyric echoes a 2017 interview on the PBS show Overheard with Evan Smith. Smith, the Texas Tribune CEO, asked Doe point-blank, “What is punk rock?” Doe, a silver streak now bisecting his black mane, answered before Smith finished: “Freedom.” The one outlier, ALPHABETLAND’s closer “All the Time in the World,” is Cervenka doing spoken-word over a piano. It’s an odd and clunky choice to conclude the record. But even if the song isn’t an ideal way to end an otherwise formidable comeback album, Cervenka’s lyrics are quite fitting. She looks back on the last 40 years, of the notion of her “youthful infinity” that now appears like mortality. She laments the young punks lost along the way, to “infected needles” and “speeding metal,” the latter likely an allusion to her sister, Mirielle, killed by a drunk driver in 1980 on her way to an X show. Perhaps resurrecting the past in making ALPHABETLAND 35 years later both inflicted pain and gave some needed perspective on life. Either way, she has no regrets: “It was fun while it lasted.”","On their first new album featuring all four original members since 1985, the Los Angeles punk icons return to the sound of their heyday on a highly formidable comeback.

Midnight Moods,Pinty,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eaaf76fbae33a8e8fd0b072/1:1/w_160/Midnight%20Moods_Pinty.jpg,2020-05-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pinty-midnight-moods/,Winged Feet,"Before grime, there was UK garage, a party-starting genre that treated its rappers more like hype men than storytellers. UK garage MCs were typically more concerned with getting the party started than documenting adversity, and Pinty, a south London artist and King Krule associate, grew up wanting to be just this kind of garage MC. His playful flow brings to mind the halcyon days of the late ’90s, when MC Neat and Craig David lit up the UK charts. Pinty’s no straight-out copycat, though: while most garage MCs were hyped to the point of explosion, Midnight Moods was recorded at night, and you can hear the nocturnal ooze in Pinty’s voice, his laconic tone caught somewhere between going to bed and recording just one more vocal. The production shares this nonchalant, itchy feel. King Krule produced the tracks “It’s Just Life” and “Fresher” (plus the 56-second “Pint’s Lullaby” on the vinyl) under his DJ JD Sports guise, and he brings his lush musicality to bear: The shadowy, guitar-lined “It’s Just Life” recalls The Streets’ Mike Skinner if he grew up on jazz in bohemian South London. Meanwhile, the central trio of “E’s”, “Moonlit Duty” and “All Nightly” suggest a meandering strain of chill-out garage, their production not far off from a young Burial. The mixtape’s most disquieting production is also its best. If the majority of Midnight Moods has the easy warmth of a packed bedroom studio, then “Go To Bed Pt. 2” brings the intoxicating delirium of a head cold, a warped synth line wrapping itself around nervous lo-fi house beats. Sadly, the mood dims when Pinty shows up, his one-paced flow suggesting a lack of confidence and finesse. Pinty’s vocals are genial enough when they fit to the beat, but a more versatile rapper would have switched up his style. But in the modest environment of Midnight Moods, this lack of personality is almost fitting. Garage MCs were rarely the stars of the show,  and Pinty’s vocals contribute to the ambience of this charmingly understated mixtape, rather than dominate them.","This south London rapper and King Krule associate evokes the carefree heyday of ’90s UK garage.

Making a Door Less Open,Car Seat Headrest,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea73861fbaf7a0008dcf2a5/1:1/w_160/Making%20a%20Door%20Less%20Open_Car%20Seat%20Headrest.jpg,2020-05-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/car-seat-headrest-making-a-door-less-open/,Matador,"Feeling like shit is the emotional baseline in Car Seat Headrest songs. Sex, drugs, or, if we’re taking Making a Door Less Open at its word, indie rock’n’roll fame only make it worse. Car Seat Headrest mastermind Will Toledo self-recorded and self-released nearly a dozen albums in the six years leading up to 2016’s feverishly lauded Teens of Denial, a commercial breakthrough that could easily be framed as an argument for the relevancy of an entire subculture. Released on Matador, feverishly debated and annotated on Reddit and Genius, a fount for major and minor Twitter controversies, Teens of Denial was a triumph for the past three decades of indie rock: a unification of ’90s aesthetics, ’00s blog-rock ascendancy, and 21st-century consumption. It has taken Toledo four years to release another collection of new material. And with it, he’s introduced Trait, his gas-mask-wearing alter ego that writes and sings exactly like Will Toledo. Though it’s ostensibly a gimmick or a distraction, Toledo has explained Trait as a means of clarifying his intentions by allowing everyone, himself included, to take the focus off Will Toledo for once. Or, put more plainly, it’s a way to make a Car Seat Headrest album without being “Car Seat Headrest.” This requires revisiting a time when “Car Seat Headrest” wasn’t loaded with meaning, heavy with all of the inane interviews, critical misinterpretation, endless tours, lawsuits, and deadlines earned by the success of Teens of Denial. At 43 minutes, Making a Door Less Open is one of the shortest Car Seat Headrest albums in the catalog and the first to be explicitly modeled after that year’s quartet of introductory, numbered compilations that preceded any flicker of buzz: a collection of singles with no overarching concept, no real allegiance to the “album” as a finalized document. Vinyl owners will hear “Hymn” as an interminable three-minute drone, while the CD and digital format feature its breakbeat-riddled remix. “Deadlines” has “Acoustic,” “Hostile” and “Thoughtful” retoolings, while “Martin” variously appears as the fourth, sixth, and seventh track. Making a Door Less Open already exists in three different formats, with more fan-made “Best Of”s inevitably to come. But all versions start with the essential “Weightlifters,” which functions the same way “Fill in the Blank” did on Teens of Denial, acknowledging the heightened stakes and validating the expectations of a “new, improved Car Seat Headrest.” Toledo kicked off Teens of Denial with an exuberant defense of depression that positioned him as an heir to Matador’s prolific slacker icons Stephen Malkmus and Robert Pollard, while here, “Weightlifters” reflects Car Seat Headrest’s status as the only Bandcamp-to-bandshell success story that warranted a live album. There have been many Car Seat Headrest songs structured like “Weightlifters”—where the beat builds for two minutes or so while Toledo breathlessly untangles a web of thoughts until its pithy core is revealed (“I should start lifting weights/Cause I believe that thoughts can change my body”). But Car Seat Headrest has never operated with the level of showmanship displayed here. The whirring synths and electronics sound more like walk-on music for the mighty septet that held its own at Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl. It’s the best-case scenario for the newly bionic Car Seat Headrest, one that Toledo designed to compete with the pop and hip-hop acts that have banished rock bands like his from the zeitgeist. If anything, Making a Door Less Open benefits from the inherent repetition of electronic music. Rather than the circuitous, tangential songwriting Toledo once stretched out to five minutes or more, songs like “Can’t Cool Me Down” and “There Must Be More Than Blood” just circle back to their hooks and hang on for dear life. It’s an apt structure for songs inspired by exhaustion, as Toledo’s most memorable images find him half-asleep on a red-eye and taking the stage through fever sweats and lemon throat lozenges. Yet, it’s not the “electronic influence” on Making a Door Less Open that belongs in scare quotes, but that of Toledo’s electronic “side project” called 1 Trait Danger, where Toledo and drummer Andy Katz imagined a band’s entire fictional career arc within two albums. Anyone who’s swapped guitars for synths likely understands the thrill of reinhabiting a beginner’s mindset, where pressing a button on the arpeggiator feels as significant as learning the chords to a Green Day song as a teenager. From that angle, maybe there’s a contact high to be gained from the overeager panning effects, samples, and redlining drums that clutter “Life Worth Missing” and “Famous” and leave them sounding like incoherent remixes of themselves. That same sense of gleeful adventure goes missing when Making a Door Less Open hews closest to autobiography. When Toledo describes Hollywood as “a place where people go to make their fantasies come to life, and they end up exploiting other people and doing terrible things to maintain their fantasy,” does he even expect people to repeat his words like he’s making a novel point? “Hollywood” is essentially Toledo’s version of Weezer’s “Beverly Hills,” somehow both the laziest and most ruthlessly calculated thing he’s done. Its concept is catchy and banal enough (“Hollywood makes me wanna puke!”) to realistically get co-opted by the very people in its crosshairs. The most generous possible reading of “Hollywood” is as a lyrical Eephus pitch, something that destabilizes through counterintuitive simplicity. Perhaps it’s not a mockup of Hollywood’s facade, but the cliché of people feeling like they have something new to say about it. This take becomes impossible to sustain with “Deadlines,” where Toledo’s stylistic tics— in-game metacommentary, nagging harmonies—start to feel like Car Seat Headrest cannibalizing itself. But if a song about the drudgery of songwriting is itself a slog, does that mean “Deadlines” achieves its goal? Or does it suggest that not even Toledo can use writer’s block as a prompt at this point? The latter seems more realistic in light of Making a Door Less Open’s more overtly inessential tracks. In the past, “Hymn” and threadbare interlude “What’s With You Lately” could’ve been written off as the churn of Toledo’s bustling DIY cottage industry. But when they make up 20 percent of the tracklist of his only collection of new material in four years, they become a working definition of filler. They’re not spectacular failures either, but Making a Door Less Open would inevitably benefit from a willingness to risk spectacular failure—this isn’t the hard left-turn “Can’t Cool Me Down” hinted at. Though I’ve seen plausible comparisons to Julian Casablancas chasing off the squares with the Voidz, the album never alienates and antagonizes to the same extent—its mild disappointments and half-realized experiments lack the contrarian conviction that mints future cult classics. For that, I direct you to 1 Trait World Tour, a concept album about 1 Trait Danger accepting the “Softmore Slump” after a critically acclaimed debut and taking good-natured shots at Car Seat Headrest's actual neighbors on festival side stage lineups: Beach House, the xx, laptop EDM producers, Mac DeMarco. As far as Matador artists moonlighting with hip-hop, it somehow drew less attention than Interpol singer Paul Banks’ experimental rap album, Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be. Katz worried that 1 Trait Danger would jeopardize Car Seat Headrest’s reputation, but they followed their muse anyway. The side-project only essential for being so profoundly inessential, yet more than Making a Door Less Open, it feels like a project in which Toledo followed his own artistic credo: commit yourself completely.","On his odd and ambitious new album, singer-songwriter Will Toledo dons a gas mask, adds electronic textures, and tries to separate himself from the indie fame of Car Seat Headrest.

Ache of Victory EP,Zsela,by: Zoe Dubno,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea84c0f8269b8000899328b/1:1/w_160/Ache%20of%20Victory%20EP_Zsela.jpg,2020-05-01 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/zsela-ache-of-victory-ep/,self-released,"Zsela Thompson’s rich, strange voice first appeared in February 2019 with her debut single “Noise.” There was something haunting about the song’s fluid, hymn-like motion, the way Thompson’s vocals evoked Sade. When the native New Yorker released her second single, “Earlier Days,” eight months later, I felt similarly to one of the commenters on YouTube: “HOW CAN I LISTEN TO MORE OF HER MUSIC, HELP.” Her five-song EP Ache of Victory arrives after years of teasing. Although it’s her first official release, it comes with an intimidating pedigree. Thompson is the daughter of Marc Anthony Thompson, the neo-soul artist Chocolate Genius, and though her music has traces of her father’s sound, she also fits in with the modern R&B cohort. She’s a scene staple, playing local haunts like Joe’s Pub and Baby’s All Right as well as more rarefied gigs: She covered Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” at MoMA PS1 for the fashion label Vaquera, performed at NYFW for Collina Strada, and at the Whitney for the museum’s annual Art Party. Her producer on Ache of Victory is Daniel Aged, who’s worked with Frank Ocean, and, as one half of the duo inc., with FKA twigs and Kelela. Last year, she toured with Cat Power and Angel Olsen. Judging by this EP, she belongs to her generation’s modern R&B cohort, marrying the bedroom-pop idiosyncrasy of Okay Kaya with the intimacy of Moses Sumney. In the opener, a synth-backed piano ballad called “Drinking,” the singer admits that she’s been “drinking again,” perhaps a nod to the bluesy sentimental standard of the same name. Alternating between the melancholy and maniacal euphoria that comes with ruining your own life, the song charts the ambivalence of falling off the wagon. Zsela’s voice vacillates between sulking and sprightly: “I’ve been drinking again/I’ve been losing all my friends.” The lines are sung from the bottom of a bottle, then from on high in an angelic chorus, then from back down again, before the song ends abruptly mid-sentence, jolting the listener from their vicariously drunken stupor. The strongest songs here remain the singles. “Earlier Days” shows Zsela singing breathlessly over gauzy ambient synths punctuated by laid back percussion. On “For Now,” Zsela is backed by synth arpeggios and slow-rolling drums. Her vocal range is astonishing; on the chorus, her voice dives to a bellow, then climbs into a weightless falsetto. When the drums are pared down, her layered vocals produce a stunning, Enya-like choral effect. The album’s last two songs, though they use similar stylistic quirks, do so with less precision. “Liza,” a torch song backed by a lovely undulating synth, offers little lyrical complexity compared to the rest of the album, and relies a bit too heavily on Zsela’s peculiar voice and vocal layering to carry it. Like “Drinking,” it ends abruptly, but rather than adding to the dizzying quality, it just sounds like someone’s pulled the plug. “Undone,” the album’s most stripped-down song, feels like a return to the piercing simplicity of “Noise,” but it’s so short that it feels unfinished. Perhaps the first cut is the deepest. Where singles like “Noise” reveal a distinct sound, the other material succumbs to generic, murmured any-R&B—imagine Rhye, the xx, and Aged’s project inc., all blended into autoplay monolith. But Zsela is too interesting to become a casualty of the “beats to chill/study to” playlist, and there are plenty of signs on this short, promising project that her formidable voice will enter the pantheon of greats in a matter of albums. Correction: Zsela’s father is Marc Anthony Thompson, not Marc Anthony Johnson. Her performance at the Whitney Museum took place at its 2020 Art Party, not at the Wide Rainbow Gala. This review has also been updated to clarify Daniel Aged’s production credits, both solo and as a member of inc.","On her promising debut EP, the New York singer-songwriter searches for ideal settings for her stunning, intimate voice.

Cape Cira,K-LONE,by: Matthew Schnipper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea73d99f7770300095897e3/1:1/w_160/Cape%20Cira_K-LONE.jpg,2020-05-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/k-lone-cape-cira/,Wisdom Teeth,"There’s something undeniably entrancing about the little donk that happens when you smack a xylophone. Same with the rubbery thwack of the conga. They are instant little dopamine-release mechanisms, and thus the bar is low for pleasing instrumental percussion records: Record yourself with moderate skill for a half an hour and, chances are, you’ve got something hypnotic enough to find an audience. In some ways, this describes K-Lone’s Cape Cira. It’s a record of small and bubbly percussion, featuring an added array of digital embellishments. But Cape Cira is a lush piece of music, one that uses familiar tools to create something fresh and vibrant. K-Lone, a young British producer named Josiah Gladwell, brings a kitchen-sink approach to the instrumentation. Yes, he relies on the lovely resonance of the marimba, but there’s also what sounds like pots and pans, Coke bottles, timpani, bells, castanets, and toy pianos. Gladwell claims to use both digital and analog sounds, but it’s impossible to tell what’s what. Listen closely and you’ll hear some bird chirps that are clearly digitized. Listen not so closely and you’ll swear you heard a nightingale out your window. Put it on in the background and you’ll experience bliss by association; pay close attention and you’ll likely be genuinely touched by its depth. Cape Cira is equally sprawling in its tone. The underlying drums on “In the Pines” are accompanied by a wordless chorus, and something that sounds like a guitar solo played underwater at half speed. “Honey” uses an almost hip-hop backbeat; through K-Lone’s lens, though, it sounds like a more zen version of the bouncy rhythms you often hear bucket drummers pounding out on subway platforms. The main rhythm of “Palmas” is undergirded with the sound of someone hammering tin. “Bluefin” is perhaps the album’s loveliest moment, with slowly building pan drums undergirded by Eno-esque long tones. Shards of noise jump in and out. At one point, a raygun noise shoots across the landscape. The song is not greater than the sum of its parts; it just uses its parts very innovatively. The whole album is a celebration writ small, music for a barnburner in a dollhouse. This is the first time K-Lone’s made music anywhere near this sumptuous. His 2017 song “Old Fashioned” hinted in this direction, beginning with a spare synth line and some bird calls (it seems he really likes birds) before breaking into heavy dub, like it couldn’t quite sustain its subdued ambitions. With Cape Cira, he’s largely dropped any desire for propulsion in favor of an outward creep, like a stain slowly spreading in all directions at once. In discussing this album, K-Lone has cited the Fourth World movement, which takes its name from a 1980 album by Brian Eno and trumpeter Jon Hassell. Hassell has emerged as a key influence on today’s composers and electronic producers, each with their own way of blending percussive music with digital effects. K-Lone’s one-time collaborator, producer Don’t DJ, has been tongue-in-cheek with his liberal use of Balinese gamelan music, even releasing an EP called Authentic Exoticism. Another K-Lone touchstone, Visible Cloaks, have been more than upfront about their love of Japanese New Age and ’80s ambient music. Cape Cira touches on all these styles and more. If he wasn’t so skilled at blending everything seamlessly, it might come off as naive. If anything, that’s Cape Cira’s major fault; it’s almost too meticulous. If you found it cloying, I wouldn’t blame you. But there is something sweet about K-Lone’s wholesale embrace of sound, like he couldn’t choose an allegiance to any one idea, so he had to find a way to make them all work.","The British producer’s bubbly, refreshing latest record is a celebration writ small, music for a barnburner in a dollhouse.

Modern Bliss,Roza Terenzi,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea855638269b8000899328c/1:1/w_160/Modern%20Bliss%20_Roza%20Terenzi.jpg,2020-05-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roza-terenzi-modern-bliss/,Planet Euphorique,"Outside of Australia, most people don’t know what a bush doof is, but they’re essential to understanding Roza Terenzi’s music. For a teenager growing up in Perth, a place often described as the most isolated city in the world, clubbing wasn’t a particularly attractive option, but bush doofs—that’s Aussie slang for outdoor parties in remote or rural areas—offered the chance to take a proper plunge into the trippy depths of electronic music. Terenzi recently located to Berlin after spending a few years in Melbourne, but Modern Bliss, her debut album, is rife with what sound like subconscious echoes of the nights she spent dancing in the wilds of Western Australia. (Some of those echoes might also be linked to her father, a percussionist who’s been part of an electronic dub project called Beatworld since the late 1990s.) Words like “sci-fi” and “extra-terrestrial” are often used to describe Terenzi’s production—and lines can absolutely be drawn between her work and the spacey sounds of vintage Detroit techno and electro, as well as the Motor City-inspired output of Dutch outposts like Clone and Crème Organization—but Modern Bliss also has a hippieish, psychedelic undercurrent that’s more Burning Man than Berghain. This vibe is most evident on “Modern Bliss,” which pairs a self-actualization mantra (“Exactly where I need to be/My thoughts create reality”) from Barcelona’s Ivy Barkakati with a floaty techno-trance framework reminiscent of Paul van Dyk’s 1996 anthem “Words.” Back then, ponderous self-empowerment monologues were a staple of trance and progressive house, and there’s something familiar and comforting about the track’s warm pads and subtle synth wiggles. “Total Eclipse” is another throwback, its blunted breakbeats and twirling acid lines forming a perfect soundtrack for blithely zoning out in the chillout room. The shambling, sun-soaked “Spiral” is an even headier trip, yet it’s “Jungle in the City” that provides the album’s most blissful moment. A cosmic chugger that cleverly nods to Terenzi’s father (it shares a title with the first Beatworld album), the song’s astral melodies glide atop gently tumbling tropical drum sounds. Warm and fuzzy flourishes aside, inventive percussion is at the heart of Terenzi’s appeal. A skilled shapeshifter, she’s flirted with a variety of styles and tempos across her previous releases, but her forays into electro and breakbeat have become a calling card. Those crooked rhythms play a role in Modern Bliss as well, albeit a less prominent one. With its robotic beats and thick, rolling bassline, “Yo-Yo” is one of the album’s sturdiest cuts, with bright melodic stabs that tip the song into euphoria. Album closer “My Reality Cheque Bounced”—a playful collaboration with Planet Euphorique founder DJ Zozi (aka D. Tiffany)—isn’t a straight-up breakbeat track, but its snappy, stop-and-start drum pattern and rubbery bounce make it one of the LP’s most obvious party tunes. Straight lines are in short supply on Modern Bliss, but “That Track (Rewired Mix)” is one of the few instances in which Terenzi adheres to dance music’s standard four-on-the-floor grid. With its squiggly melody and sassy vocal refrain, the thumping house tune jettisons the rave nostalgia, opting instead for something closer to the perky sounds of classic Chicago labels like Dance Mania. It’s one of the album’s most streamlined productions, but it’s also one of its most effective. Moreover, it’s proof that even when she deviates from what’s expected, Terenzi can still be devastatingly effective. The heart of Modern Bliss may reside in the bush doof, but its creator is capable of thriving just about anywhere.","Playing spacey techno sounds off breakbeats and inventive percussion, the Australian producer’s debut album has a psychedelic undercurrent that’s more Burning Man than Berghain.

Pain Mop Girl 2020,Default Genders,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea712e51fbee80008481748/1:1/w_160/pain%20mop%20girl%202020_default%20genders.jpg,2020-04-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/default-genders-pain-mop-girl-2020/,self-released,"In a 2019 Q&A, Default Genders’ Jaime Brooks likened her artistic practice to fanfiction, and to cumulative video game modding. “Modding communities in gaming are just like fanfiction communities,” she writes. “People pouring tons of time and heart and effort into an IP someone else owns for pure love of the thing. That’s what motivates the best and coolest ideas. That’s how this stuff is supposed to work.” This is the conceit of Pain Mop Girl 2020—both a showcase for Brooks’ bold, fractured songwriting, and a convincing argument for this strain of digital democratic thinking. Restless art invites restless interpretation. Brooks knows this well: last year’s Main Pop Girl 2019 was a masterclass in conceptual splatter, with reference points as far-reaching as Dylan, jungle, and the indie electronic sounds of the early 2010s. The music is humid, gestural—constantly shifting under its own weight and without a foothold in any particular style or framework. That Brooks’ clubby, nightcore-adjacent cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Secret Garden” fits as well as it does is a testament to the record’s perpetual motion: Having to square the Boss with a DIY rave only sucks you further into the relentless flow. That sense of whiplash makes Main Pop Girl 2019 well-suited to the project of a remix album. And Pain Mop Girl 2020 is that, more or less: a patchwork of dense, often cartoonish reimaginings from similarly-minded internet futurists, as well as two entirely new tracks, “cascadia subduction zone” and “am i gonna die?” On the latter, shuffling percussion and a half-slurred vocal delivery are proxies for self-doubt. “If I survive is it just/Because some paperwork got lost?” Brooks asks, collapsing the distance between the bureaucratic and the existential in a turn of phrase. The aesthetic palette is muted, but the lyrics remain sharp and searching. And though much of Pain Mop Girl 2020 is similarly attuned to questions of life, death, and material reproduction, there’s no single throughline. Canadian electronic tinkerer Drainpuppet’s take on “pharmacoma” ditches the frenetic drum programming of the original in favor of low-fi alt-rock, serrated pop melodies, and vocal processing that feels of a piece with big-tent EDM. The Tom Waits-referencing “christmas card from a scammer in minneapolis (live)” benefits from the addition of piano and a newly uncluttered ambient backing; the fact that it wasn’t actually recorded live itself points back to Waits, whose faux-live Nighthawks at the Diner is also set in an imagined lounge. It’s a flirtation with a certain kind of computer-controlled humanity that permeates the entire collection. The album’s most revealing rework is “sophie (wren dove lark edit),” which appears here in its third incarnation. Originally written for Magical Pessimism 2014, the track was transformed on Main Pop Girl 2019 from a fairly straightforward slow-burner into something slick and free, with pitched-up vocals as an anchor for lyrics about grappling with gender identity. The Pain Mop Girl 2020 version is her first under the name Jaime, and with new pronouns; singer-songwriter Wren Dove Lark’s rerecorded vocals, strained and ecstatic, speak to the universality of the writing, and to changeability as a guiding ethos in both content and form. No take is definitive because the music is fundamentally iterative, and nothing is ever finished. Even on the closer, the second and more inspired of the album’s two “checking in with the old gang” remixes, there’s a hint of continuity. In the hands of GLITCHLETTE, a self-described emo and synthpop musician based out of Washington, the track becomes an ethereal duet. Its central refrain is restructured as call-and-response between two voices: “Do you feel it?/Do these tired old lies feel true?/Well I used to believe them/But I’m not sure I still do.” There’s renewed pathos in the experience of an answered question, but an encroaching wave of guitars keeps a tinge of darkness in the mix.And at the end, just before it all fades out, there’s a crucial bit of barely-audible studio banter: “That was just extra, for fun. OK, let’s do it again.” Brooks and her collaborators suggest that all the fun’s in fluidity—not exactly in recursion, but in homage, references, covers, and antecedents, explicit or otherwise.","In the wake of Main Pop Girl 2019, Jaime Brooks delivers a patchwork of dense, often cartoonish reimaginings of those songs, exploring pop’s fluidity with a deft, funny, and heartfelt touch.

Thug Luv,Trouble,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea71819f7770300095897e1/1:1/w_160/Thug%20Luv_Trouble.jpg,2020-04-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trouble-thug-luv/,Def Jam,"Tupac Shakur said that even thugs cry, and Atlanta rapper Trouble takes that to heart on Thug Luv. Usually a hardened street presence, on his new album, he wants to display a softer side of himself. In his follow-up to his 2018 major-label debut, Edgewood, he tests his limits—writing more about his search for intimacy, upping his use of Auto-Tune, and switching up his flows. But the album is tonally confusing, aesthetically grating, and lacking the deft touch of Edgewood architect Mike WiLL Made-It. Unlike his idol, Boosie, Trouble struggles to reveal the layers beneath his hard exterior. On opener “Dreamin Bout My Dawgs,” he reminisces powerfully about friends he lost to long prison bids—“Young, it was just somethin’ ‘bout your spirit/Your smile just gave a nigga extra hope, I need you near me/Be free,” he raps. But that emotional force dissipates as the album goes on. There are songs about self-medicating with drugs and pursuing a soulmate, but he never has anything more to express than the basic idea that thugs are people too. In a mini-doc called “Origins,” he claims that “Special” is about his son, but except for a cursory “Had a son, I had to cut back on the drink” line, Trouble has nothing to say about fatherhood or what makes his son special to him. He does, however, manage to rap about buying a Tesla and offer to “take that big booty to a movie.” Like most of the album, the song simply exposes his limitations as a writer, and it’s hard to see Thug Luv as anything other than a massive stylistic regression. Edgewood was executive produced by a locked-in Mike WiLL Made-It. Returning to hardcore rap after a few years in pop, Mike offered some of his most inspired beats in years, turning Zone 6 into A Nightmare on Elm Street and the bando into a haunted house. By comparison, Thug Luv isn’t just poorly produced, it sounds cheaper, lighter on resources. The bootleg Timbaland bounce of “Which 1 Of Em” and the lazily recycled “Choppa Style” beat on “She A Winner” are both shoddy. Verses from 2 Chainz and Jeezy are phoned-in, and Trouble can’t even seem to settle on any coherent theory on what thug love means to him. It is impossible to get invested in this rapper as the thug with the heart of gold when he won’t even commit to the bit. The few occasions where Trouble shines, he’s back to his cutthroat ways. The sinister, Mike WiLL-produced “All My Niggaz” finds him standing his ground: “Fuck all that playin’ and wolfin’ I’m with the shits,” he raps. On “Ain’t My Fault,” he flips Silkk the Shocker’s 1998 hit into an indifferent anthem of his own. “Pride” is the closest he comes to diagramming the ways in which performing emotionlessness gets thugs killed. But in these songs, he’s all but scrapping the album’s theme of showing love and taking care. One of Edgewood’s final tracks, “Ms. Cathy & Ms. Connie,” laid a clear path for the album that Thug Luv could’ve been. On the song, Trouble remains the same get-it-at-all-costs hustler he’s always been, only the subtext is that everything he does to make a buck—be it thugging or rapping—is for the sake of those around him.  He doesn’t have to spell out his love for these people or slather on Auto-Tune for you to feel the weight of his commitment to them. Trouble has built a reputation as “the rapper who stayed,” the guy for whom making it out didn’t mean leaving those in his community behind. The mini-doc shows him chopping it up at the local barbershop, mingling with the kids at a barbeque, and buying his mom her beautiful new house—more or less being the mayor on his block. He would’ve had far greater success leaning into that characterization on Thug Luv. Love doesn’t always have to be demonstrated so bluntly. Often it speaks for itself.","On the followup to his explosive major-label debut Edgewood, the Atlanta rapper tries to show us his heart but trips over his own painfully limited writing.

Paradise Gardens,White Poppy,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea71977c5a4ee000888a2ce/1:1/w_160/Paradise%20Gardens_White%20Poppy.jpg,2020-04-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/white-poppy-paradise-gardens/,Not Not Fun,"As White Poppy, Canadian songwriter Crystal Dorval glides through dream pop’s highest altitudes with a guitar that rumbles like a jet engine. Releases like 2015’s excellent Natural Phenomena hid psychedelic Lisa Frank wonderlands and a distinct, unshakeable melancholy in their thick fog banks. On her follow-up, Paradise Gardens, these clouds clear to reveal her most immediate, adventurous music to date and the always razor-sharp songwriting that lurked behind them. Whether you’ve just fallen in love or taken drugs, dream pop has always been great at mirroring wild shifts in brain chemistry, but Paradise Garden often sounds like a mind trying to hold itself together. Over the blissful drumbeat of opener “Broken,” Dorval sighs, “There’s a hole in my heart/Don’t know where the pieces are/There’s a hole in my head/Guess I’m better off than dead.” Her ethereal whisper makes no attempt to hide the dire image painted by the lyrics, which culminate in chants of “I don’t want to complain/I can’t help myself today” and a starry guitar solo. “Broken” is a gorgeously, euphoric song about feeling absolutely terrible, but it sets the tone for an album where Dorval achieves trippy highs by simply accepting the lows. While Paradise Gardens recalls both dream pop originators like Cocteau Twins and revivalists like Dum Dum Girls, the direct and almost conversational way it explores subjects like depression is original. Depression doesn’t fit a tidy narrative, and Dorval’s layered writing captures the struggle of each new day. “Broken” and “Hardly Alive,” a song built on fuzzed-out guitars and driving drums that focuses on feeling trapped in your home, contain the album’s most anxious spirals. Yet it’s when Dorval shifts into the woozier side of her work that Paradise Garden takes on a meditative calm and a zen confidence. “Memories,” the second track on the album, sets the leisurely pace that’s always suited White Poppy best. Over a shimmering guitar and simple drums, she delivers lines with a plainspoken simplicity that recalls Bill Callahan, letting each word hang for a moment before drifting to the next: “I/Am letting go/Of who/I used to be/Everything/I know/Is rearranging.” Each steady step brings the song closer to a kaleidoscopic beauty, and each fading memory seems to lift Dorval higher. On songs like the dubby “Hawk” and airy “Orchid Child,” Dorval’s hypnotic mantras float over her drifting guitar. If previous White Poppy albums engulfed the listener in lo-fi guitar haze, Dorval unlocks new musical hues here by adding synths and samples. This experimentation leads to surprises like the magical “Something Sacred,” where Dorval, singing over a steady shuffle and chromatic guitar, is joined by the sound of a dolphin’s laughter bursting into the mix; the strange duet the two form has become one of my favorite musical moments of the year. It also gives us the staggering “Silence,” an unexpectedly uplifting song about feeling isolated that takes on a new power in a time of self-quarantine. “I/Am/Alone,” she sings in a whisper, letting each word hang over a distant glowing guitar, before adding “You/Are/Too.” It’s an equally heavy and heavenly realization, delivered in a moment when we are all trying to understand our situation and ourselves. White Poppy offers both blissful escape and inspiring strength just by taking it one day at a time.","Canadian songwriter Crystal Dorval melts away the haze of dream pop for her most clear-eyed and expansive music to date.

Though the quartet of old friends is based in Brooklyn, in recent years they’ve toured separately with other acts to pay the bills. So in late 2018, when they collectively decamped to a family cabin beside a frozen lake in Indiana to record a new album, it was a rare opportunity to congregate under the same roof. While there, they kept the tape rolling. On “funny thoughts…,” a delicate piano line is interrupted by the clink of a metal spoon.“It’s literally louder than the fucking piano, your fucking eating,” someone yells. Stifled laughter. “Love you!” “Love you too.” altopalo’s previous record, frozenthere, also recorded in Indiana, was inspired by the intimate estrangement of laggy FaceTime calls and unblinking stares into a screen. To mimic this state, they warped and corroded the human voice, sometimes to gorgeous effect: one passage sounded like overhearing a man cry from the other side of a wall, the tragedy heightening as the wail grew soft. Farawayfromeveryoneyouknow retains many of its predecessor’s signature effects—the garbled singing, shuffling electronics, and light pentatonic flourishes—but it’s a warmer and more spacious album, thanks in part to Mike Haldeman’s languid, echoey guitar. altopalo’s glitchy blend of ambient, indie rock, and R&B recalls the work of  “genre-less” auteurs like Justin Vernon or James Blake, though lead singer Rahm Silverglade’s voice is less howling and more numb, which lends the music an appealing anonymity. The group made a conscious effort to eliminate possessive language from their sessions—my bass, his drum—and so what you hear is less a singular display of virtuosity than a collective blur of experience. Farawayfromeveryoneyouknow has no proper nouns, no prickly clues from which to patch together a personal history. Instead, it dwells on ordinary and universal moments of alienation: the tedium of doing chores with a foggy mind, or the difficulty of falling asleep at night. Songs are addressed to a disembodied “you.” On “Honey,” a song inspired by bassist Jesse Bielenberg’s struggle with depression, Silverglade murmurs words of devotion to the drug Lexapro: “Never said love and then I did,” he recites hoarsely, over frayed drums and atmospheric swirls. “Never saw color and you dropped in.” Off-kilter accents, like the harsh blasts of static on “am i am,” or the hospital monitor pings that open several songs, accentuate the private strangeness of these liminal moments. Halfway through “Mud” is an absurd, wordless jumble that resembles a baby garbling through a tube. And while this particular bit seems random, other vocal fragments can be wrenchingly profound. On “Lub,” Silverglade warbles the album title in a rapidly ascending vocal line, so that syllables domino into each other. “Maybe/Stop at Safeway/Get some Pringles/And then/Maybe wander/Feeling sorry/For myself,” he screeches later, pushed to the brink by AutoTune. The mundane familiarity of the scene seems incongruous with the severity of the wail. It’s like the world you once knew has become foreign and inhospitable. farawayfromeveryoneyouknow closes on a gentler melancholy. Awash in static and feedback, the final song, “now that you’re here…,” recalls the sound of an old clock chiming slowly in the distance. It’s like staring out at the city at the crack of dawn, briefly feeling as though you have all the time in the world. It’s also designed to thwart Spotify from automatically queuing up a different album and jolting you into another landscape. Sit with me longer, it says. Stay. For all of its remoteness, farawayfromeveryoneyouknow is strangely comforting.","With garbled singing, shuffling electronics, and fragments of conversation, the Brooklyn band’s new album dwells on ordinary and universal moments of alienation.

Over melancholy pianos and guitars, the 20-year-old sings and raps in a choked voice that sounds like he wants to cry, but doesn’t know how. He’s incredibly blunt, and listening to his music can be as brutal as immersing yourself in early Chief Keef. “Red dot and head shots for who wanna do me/Homicides, mamas cry, it ain’t nothing to it,” he wails on “Solar Eclipse.” Often he’ll mention his family and friends by name. The emotional immediacy is undeniable, even if the headlines swirling around him remain unsettling. Since the release of early mixtapes like 38 Baby and AI YoungBoy, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana-raised rapper has built a massive and loyal fanbase who have consistently made him the no. 1 streamed artist on YouTube. YoungBoy is almost always involved in a legal issue, but with every one, he only gets more popular. The hip-hop tabloids have responded by following his every move like he’s their Paris Hilton, though the only time you’ll likely hear him speak is through Instagram Live. On that platform, tens of thousands of fans watch him faithfully like they’re at a megachurch, as he angrily rants, gives life updates, and runs through cigarettes like a bag of candy. His new album, 38 Baby 2, isn’t that much different from any other YoungBoy project, but part of YoungBoy’s appeal is consistency. Throughout much of the album YoungBoy is in his comfort zone, reflecting on his struggles over mournful production: “My mama cars ain’t never had AC ever since I was little/Thank God every card I got in my pocket hold at least one million,” he sings on the intro, followed by a verse from his own mother. Next to his mother, YoungBoy sounds sweeter than he ever has, but that doesn’t last long. YoungBoy has become defined by his menacing personality, as someone who can say, “I’m down to kill a whole house when my feelings involved,” like he does on “Rough Ryder,” and then quickly move onto something else. Typically he’s hostile and unpredictable; it’s made his relationships the source of endless social media debate and it’s reflected in his purest love songs. “Let me love you in my own way, that’s from a distance/I said ‘Fuck you,’ I was on them drugs and I was trippin’,” he sings on “Treat You Better.” It’s honest, but paired with real-life stories it’s hard to listen to. The best YoungBoy songs balance his lovesick attitude with his never-ending struggle. No other rapper has mood swings this extreme: He can sound like a typical madly in love 20-year-old and a madman who is a liability every time he leaves the house. It’s what made YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s connection with his fans so personal; whether it’s good or bad, YoungBoy lets them into his life. And now he’s not just another rapper who sings about pain, but the rapper who sings about pain.","The Louisiana rapper’s latest is typically blunt, anguished, and unsettling.

Sie7etr3 EP,Chucky73Fetti031,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea7070dfbaf7a0008dcf29d/1:1/w_160/sie7tr3%20EP_sie7tr3.jpg,2020-04-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chucky73-fetti031-sie7etr3-ep/,Sie7tr3 the LabelCaroline,"Drill music is having a moment in New York City. Brooklyn’s Sheff G, Fivio Foreign, and the late Pop Smoke pulled beats from up-and-coming UK producers such as 808Melo and AXL Beats to capture the sounds of the streets far from the borough’s third-wave coffee and artisanal mayo shops. But uptown in the Bronx—light years away in the NYC universe—a crew of Dominican rappers have put their own spin on the genre defined by urban grit and grime. Spitting Spanish flows over sparse beats from Latin producers, the Sie7etr3 crew’s take on drill is decidedly more light-hearted than their forebears in Chicago or their peers in Brooklyn. They still shoot low-budget crew videos on the block, and they’re certainly not immune to gangster tropes, but they’re also more likely to be smiling than mean-mugging, and have been known to brandish Nerf guns in place of Glock 9s. The 8-track Sie7etr3 EP is a succinct intro into the world of its namesake E 173rd St, and very likely the most danceable drill music you’ll ever hear. Those buoyant rhythms are the most compelling element of Sie7etr3’s music. The synthetic horns and bells on tracks like “Colombiana” and “Brazilera” lend the productions an inherently Latin flair, giving them a loose sense of movement you won’t find in Chicago or London. Sie7etr3 is new enough that their style is still evolving; early songs like “Wini” and “Wili” evoked a shadowy mood belied by all the smiling in their videos, but newer tracks like the opener “Kili” display a newfound refinement that hints at untapped potential. Posse cut “Tili” stands out as the EP’s strongest, featuring four crew members flexing their individual skills and styles over a bouncy piano melody that represents the crew’s most sophisticated production to date. And while the group’s de facto leader Chucky73 holds down the closing verse, it’s Dglo73 who shines here, showing off his range as both an AutoTune crooner and a rapper. Sie7etr3 is essentially a showcase for the budding label of the same name, but also a vehicle for Chucky and Fetti031, its two most evolved lyricists. Both have deep, compelling voices. But while Fetti’s monotone drone perfectly suits the medium of drill, Chucky’s limber flow and lyricism hints at greater potential as an MC, using the repetitive drill beats as a platform to show off his nimble-tongued delivery. Latin trap’s biggest stars—Bad Bunny, Ozuna, Anuel AA—all hail from Puerto Rico, but the style was pioneered uptown in New York’s clubs, by Dominicans, which makes Sie7etr3’s viral successes that much more satisfying.  And as strong as it is, the Sie7etr3 EP offers only a glimpse of the crew’s potential, a tasting platter of the hip-hop the Bronx is serving up in the new decade. There are certainly better rappers, in English or Spanish, but you would be hard-pressed to find a crew having more fun.","The Bronx-based Dominican crew offer a more lighthearted take on the drill sound with their debut EP.

Scacco Matto,Lorenzo Senni,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea70ae7fbaf7a0008dcf29f/1:1/w_160/Scacco%20Matto_Lorenzo%20Senni.jpg,2020-04-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lorenzo-senni-scacco-matto/,Warp,"To promote Scacco Matto, his first album for Warp Records, Lorenzo Senni challenged his fans to a virtual game of chess. With a penchant for deconstruction and a back catalog defined by monochrome palettes of icy sawtooth waves, the Italian electronic musician does seem like the kind of guy who’d be handy at the game. The rules are fixed but the outcome is unpredictable; within extremely narrow parameters, players can display flair, cunning, and subterfuge. Scacco Matto, which is Italian for checkmate, is the product of self-imposed limits and rules. The writing process was a back-and-forth volley, according to Senni, with every action followed by a reaction, as he deliberately countered his own moves in a knotty one-player game.  The basic material remains familiar—gated synth tones arranged in taut melodies and spindly arpeggios—but Senni has found a new flamboyance in these astoundingly ornate, often song-like pieces. The Milan-based artist has been working within strict limitations since 2012’s Quantum Jelly, the record that seeded his idea of “pointillistic trance”: a mirage of a familiar genre constructed from the “Super Saw” preset of a Roland JP8080 synthesizer, with no drums to anchor the beat, but big drops for that euphoric release. When Senni joined Warp with 2016’s Persona EP, he added flesh to those bare bones by introducing himself as the “rave voyeur”: a bright-eyed, clean-living soul who gets his late-night fuel from energy drinks and observes our hedonism with calculated interest. Now he leads us gently away from the dancefloor to a more orderly setting, a manicured garden of synthetic topiary and rococo fancies. “Dance Tonight Revolution Tomorrow” is the most relaxed Senni has sounded in a long time; a ponderous melody line makes its way across a grid of synthetic pizzicato strings which pluck-pluck-pluck in tidy formation. It’s a simple phrase, immediately memorable, but over seven and a half minutes Senni keeps finding subtle ways to build tension while barely moving. “Canone Infinito,” which was originally commissioned for the corridors of an intensive care unit in Bergamo, takes the refined ambience to the extreme. A sad melody ebbs and flows in an endless looping musical round—think Pachelbel’s Canon for furloughed ravers—and the undulating arpeggios feel like a portal to a lost world of straight-backed courtiers and gilded harpsichords. But “Canone Infinito” also points to a long-established link between classical music and trance, which has repurposed plenty of concert hall hits for peak-time euphoria (as established by William Orbit’s ’90s spin on Barber’s Adagio for Strings and its remix by Dutch DJ Ferry Corsten). Elsewhere, Senni makes this connection through tiny gestures: a few bars of hands-in-the-air piano followed by stabs of harpsichord-like synth, buzzing and metallic, on “XBreakingEdgeX.” There’s a further classical/electronic reference within the squeaky melodies of “THINK BIG” and “Discipline of Enthusiasm,” which recall the 8-bit Bach and Tchaikovsky that once blared from primitive video-game chips. It speaks to Senni’s increasing dexterity as an electronic auteur that all of this simply makes sense together; his themes and reference points cohere smoothly, right through to the cover art. The image, titled “Zuma #30,” was shot by photographer and conceptual artist John Divola in 1977 as part of a project documenting the dilapidation of an oceanfront house in Malibu. Seen through a window, one of those perfect Californian sunsets burns gold and orange beyond the white walls of the interior, which have been covered in thick black dots of spray paint. Was this an act of vandalism? Or some kind of manic meditation? Either way, it’s a retina-searing image of creativity born of limited means. Checkmate, the game’s final, winning move, is the chess position in which the king is doomed to be captured. It’s a frustrating quirk of chess that you don’t actually get to capture him—the inevitability of the result is enough to wrap up the game. Senni, so comfortable surfing his endless trance builds, surely thrives in these moments. With Scacco Matto he sweeps the tournament to become a grandmaster of unresolved tension.","The Italian electronic producer and arch conceptualist finds a new flamboyance in astoundingly ornate, song-like pieces of deconstructed trance and video-game chirps.

Shadows in Blue,Hodge,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea70fcfd77ce10008412000/1:1/w_160/Shadows%20in%20Blue_Hodge.jpg,2020-04-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hodge-shadows-in-blue/,Houndstooth,"Hodge’s signature is his drum programming. It pecks and prods, at once brutal and exacting, surgical and relentless in its staccato attack. Those drums instantly telegraph to dancers that they’re listening to a Hodge track. The Bristol musician, aka Jacob Martin, has applied that signature to all kinds of canvases in the past nine years. He has made fast tracks and slow ones; bludgeoning peak-time barnstormers and wobbly-legged sun-up jams; broken-beat syncopations and four-to-the-floor pulses. While the bulk of Hodge’s output has appeared on labels like Livity Sound, Hemlock, and Punch Drunk—hubs for the dynamic, resolutely UK-rooted strain of 21st-century dance music that Hodge has grown up alongside—he has also turned up on European labels better known for house and techno. He’s collaborated with post-dubstep peers like Peverelist and Randomer but also maverick experimentalists like Laurel Halo and Fever Ray co-producer Peder Mannerfelt. No matter how recognizable his touch, Hodge might be one of the most versatile figures in contemporary UK club music. His debut album, Shadows in Blue, makes the most of that flexibility, building on his dancefloor sensibilities while making good on the experimental tendencies that have long lain just beneath the surface of his music. This wouldn’t be a Hodge record without some certified bangers. A less ambitious producer could have packaged a handful of these tracks into one of heaviest EPs of the year. “Sense Inversion,” “Lanes,” and “Cutie” are all built around his unflinching use of force, with sternum-punching drum patterns forming a protective circle around sullen, slow-moving bass tones. His assault is so coordinated, with layered drum parts hammering away on multiple fronts, that you feel provoked, cornered, as in a fight-or-flight situation. But these are weirder and more graceful than your garden-variety industrial-techno stompers. Take “Cutie,” with its air-raid sirens firing over a tough, rolling beat: Halfway through, its synths thicken and congeal into unexpectedly beautiful melodic forms. The effect is part battering ram, part tearjerker. “Sense Inversion” is largely in keeping with Hodge’s percussive club style, but the beat quickly drops out, leaving ominous synth drones glistening like a patch of black ice; even at full swing, the tape-warped bells smeared atop the beat feel like an unstable fusion of Saturday-night floor-filler and 1950s Bell Labs patent application. What makes Shadows in Blue so captivating—like a proper album, a notoriously tricky category for a dance producer to master—is the way these heavy-hitting cuts nestle inside a protective ambient cushion. Beginning with the avian chatter and Foley thunder sheets of the opening “Canopy Shy,” the record takes its time kicking into gear, and its exploratory passages are essential to the overall mood. “The World Is New Again,” the album’s first real song, boasts a big, ebullient riff—jagged, almost jaunty—that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Oneohtrix Point Never album. The song’s physically modeled sounds—plucked and hammered strings, vaguely Asian-sounding flutes, something that might be prepared piano—accentuate the uncanny valley between “real” and synthetic instruments, setting up the spongy terrain to come. “Sol,” with its resonant tympani and gaseous radar pings, sounds like Hodge’s bid for soundtrack work; it would be perfect for a submarine-hunt scene. And “Shadows in Blue” is the ideal mix of worlds: It so effortlessly layers classical-minimalist pulses with flutes and strings that by the time the beat finally drops, you had forgotten the very possibility of it turning into a club anthem. Even the glistening breakbeat trance of the climactic “Ghost of Akina (Rainbow Edition)” abides by this principle: It bangs and envelops in equal measure. It’s a fine time for this kind of album. With clubbing on hold indefinitely, there’s little need for floor-filling DJ tools, even as dance-music fans pine for the energy of the club at its idealized best—as a space not just for socialization but also for experimentation, a place where musical forms might mutate on a weekly basis, thanks to artists’ keen ears and audacious productions. Entirely by coincidence, Hodge has turned up with an album of adventurous club music—as well suited for dreaming as raving—at exactly the right moment. Last week, Hodge made a plea that DJs, once the lockdown finally lifts, become more adventurous in their sets. With Shadows in Blue, he provides the material to do just that.","Nestling heavy-hitting cuts inside a protective ambient cushion, the Bristol producer’s debut builds on his dancefloor sensibilities while making good on his experimental tendencies.

Good Souls Better Angels,Lucinda Williams,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea20185ce27cb0008c43e25/1:1/w_160/Good%20Souls%20Better%20Angels_Lucinda%20Williams.jpg,2020-04-28 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucinda-williams-good-souls-better-angels/,Highway 20Thirty Tigers,"Good Souls Better Angels rises from the darkest corners of Lucinda Williams’ world: down desert roads, in a barren country, through the windows of homes and churches that don’t offer the sanctuary they promise. These 12 songs are tough and haunted, built on simple blues progressions that twist and pull until they fray. Williams recorded the album in Nashville with her touring band, Buick 6, in concentrated bursts, live in the studio. While her recent records have used their sprawl to navigate a wide array of styles and moods, she now finds a range that pulls her into focus. It is roots music, bursting from the ground, changing form in the light of day. The album arrives after two moments of retrospection for the outlaw country legend: 2017’s re-recorded version of her 1992 album Sweet Old World and 2018’s anniversary tour behind 1998’s Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Inspired by the latter experience, Williams enlisted a collaborator from that classic record, Ray Kennedy, to co-produce. He joins Williams and her husband, manager, and songwriting partner Tom Overby for an album that collects some of her saddest music along with some of her heaviest and most inspiring. “Let’s break the rules,” Williams said upon launching her own label in 2014 after decades of being misunderstood and mistreated within the music industry. “We can do what we want to do now.” Good Souls follows through. From the beginning, Williams seemed to exist between genres: too rock for country, too country for rock. She had an ethos aligned with punk but she could also write catchy anthems that became radio hits for acts like Mary Chapin Carpenter. At 67, Williams now has a voice that can make anything she sings sound like a genre unto itself: It is a raspy plume of exhaust, highlighting the shapes of her words as much as their hard meanings. She spent the first decade of the 2000s hardening her delivery into a bluesy speak-sing and the second decade leaning into more varied, psychedelic settings. On Good Souls, she finds an edgy growl that can sound tender or enraged, enlightened or possessed, all within a single couplet. In the opening track, “You Can’t Rule Me,” she lists the things that cannot be taken from her—her soul, her money, her point of view. As she counts them off, she seems to take spiritual inventory, meditating on the desperate fight for each one. Over this gnarled, electric music, Williams writes in stark, chantlike verse. “Wakin’ Up” is a harrowing portrait of a woman escaping from—or dissociating during—an abusive relationship. Its visceral tug is carried by a vocal delivery like she’s spitting each word from under her tongue. That song finds a spiritual contrast in the serene, breathtaking “Big Black Train.” It’s a soulful ballad carried by a slow pulse—echoing electric guitars, a lapping rhythm section—as Williams narrates from the throes of depression, her voice alternately breaking and soaring. “I don’t wanna get on board,” she sings as the music shows how easy it might be to disappear. Williams weaves these intimate scenes through other songs that take political aim. As with all her best love songs and travelogues, she sounds more interested in dissecting the heartbreak of modern life than simply railing against it. The righteous “Man Without a Soul” is a protest song full of patience and nuance that culminates with the deepest cut imaginable from Williams’ pen: “You bring nothing good to this world,” she seethes. Above all else, she judges people by the mark we leave behind, the afterlife we build for ourselves. Without the cinematic detail or rich scenery that once defined her work, Williams draws on the lessons of her years. On the title track of her last solo album, 2016’s The Ghosts of Highway 20, she gestured toward, “Southern secrets still buried deep/Brooding and restless ’neath the cracked concrete.” In these songs, she pulls us down with her, where we can feel the gravel and see for ourselves. Like “Drunken Angel,” her signature ode to the late folk singer Blaze Foley, the gentle “Shadows & Doubts” addresses a tortured, self-destructive figure who might be beyond help: “So many ways/To crush you,” she sings in the chorus with a bleak sense of inevitability. And yet, nearly every one of these songs searches for a way out, a crack of light. “I’m gonna pray the devil back to hell,” she sings. Her guitar rattles and her voice shakes, and suddenly it sounds like an actual, physical battle. “It’s on the top of everybody’s minds—it’s all anybody talks about,” Williams wrote earlier this year. “Basically, the world’s falling apart.” In her characteristic no-bullshit manner, she was describing the inspiration for these apocalyptic songs and forecasting the landscape she would release them into. Like all the writers she admires, from Bob Dylan to Flannery O’Connor, Williams will always be drawn to capturing the essence of the times she lives in: “All I can do is write about my feelings and the world’s feelings,” she explained. Suspending and swelling for seven-and-a-half minutes, the dreamlike closing track, “Good Souls,” sounds like her version of a prayer: “Help me stay fearless,” she sings. “Help me stay strong.” By the end, the music fades into a kind of sketch, an atmospheric waltz cycling between just two chords, the band leaning forward and waiting for her signal to close. But she keeps on singing; she’s on nobody’s time but her own.","Drawing as much from punk as roadhouse blues, Lucinda Williams’ loud and unsparing new album is some of the heaviest, most inspiring music of her career.

What Kinda Music,Tom MischYussef Dayes,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea205f03577a40009ece414/1:1/w_160/What%20Kinda%20Music_Tom%20Misch%20and%20Yussef%20Dayes.jpg,2020-04-28 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tom-misch-yussef-dayes-what-kinda-music/,Blue Note,"After Tom Misch’s beige and overly polished 2018 debut, What Kinda Music, a collaboration with drummer Yussef Dayes, brings a flutter of hope. Yussef Kamaal, Dayes’ project with Henry Wu, was instrumental in bringing the South London jazz scene to the fore in the mid-2010s, and was championed by tastemaker Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood imprint. After the duo split in 2017, Dayes went quiet and Wu went on to perform as Kamaal Williams. As a fully collaborative album, What Kinda Music feels doubly heavy. For Dayes, it represents his first full-length release since the breakup of Yussef Kamaal; for Misch, it’s a proving ground for his musical chops. What Kinda Music is cosmic in scope; the reverb layered throughout the album makes it expansive, and you can hear both musicians stretching themselves to the outer limits As a pair, Dayes and Misch bring out the best in each other. Where Geography was almost too clean, What Kinda Music is muddied with depth and darkness from Dayes’ rhythms, offsetting Misch’s pitch-perfect vocals. This is particularly true on “Tidal Wave,” where Dayes’ drum rolls and hollow wooden taps provide a counterpoint to Misch’s layered vocals. The mutual respect between the pair is tangible: From Misch’s admiring lyrics in “Nightrider” (“Mr. Dayes with the break of the drums/It’s icy cold”) to the tight interplay between the separate drum and guitar improvisations in “Kyiv,” the album bears both their signature imprints. What Kinda Music also feels indebted to the collaborative nature of the South London jazz scene, as does the presence of saxophonist Kaidi Akinnibi and Dayes’ previous collaborator, bassist Rocco Palladino, as features on “Storm Before the Calm” and “Lift Off.” The interplay between the three different musicians on each track feels tightly coordinated, without necessarily requiring distinct sections for each player. Elsewhere, What Kinda Music is catchy without being insincere or vacuous. “I Did It For You” is just one repeated refrain, and Misch’s whispered vocals seem wistful over a multi-layered guitar riff and Dayes’ buzzing drumline. The pitched-up vocal sample on “The Real” plays against Misch’s brief and softly sung interlude, which has the effect of parting stage curtains for a well-delivered monologue. Not only do Dayes and Misch offer an alluring marriage of virtuosity and pop, the album feels like the best recent example of Brian Eno’s theory of scenius as opposed to genius: the theory that it takes community and collaboration to spark something incredible, rather than the work of one gifted individual.","The second album from Tom Misch, the London-based musician and producer, is an expansive and fruitful collaboration with drummer Yussef Dayes, one that brings out the best in each other.

Thousand Year Stare,Otik,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1be57820bb800085ac822/1:1/w_160/Thousand%20Year%20Stare_Otik.jpg,2020-04-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/otik-thousand-year-stare/,Gobstopper,"At the end of last year, a new high-speed train started running from Bristol to London. Touted as a win for commuters and the environment, it also piqued the interest of the real estate market, which is rarely good news for renters—some of whom are the artists that gave Bristol its appeal in the first place. The two cities have long been linked; historically by the long shadow of British colonialism, and culturally by a shared heritage of black British music. While their music scenes are indebted to much of the same sonic DNA—most notably, Jamaican soundsystem culture—having some distance from the bright lights of London allowed something different to sprout in the West Country. From trip-hop to purple to UK techno permutations that imagine new journeys between the U.S., the Caribbean, and the UK, Bristol has long been on its own wave. Otik grew up in Bristol but now lives in London. Over the past six years, he’s put out a string of 12""s and EPs that each dip into a different facet, and era, of the music that grew from the seeds sown by dancehall soundsystems: jungle, UK garage, grime, dub techno. His new four-track release, Thousand Year Stare, is both a culmination of his stylistic exploration and a break from that pattern. While it was clearly designed with dancefloor dimensions in mind, what lifts the record up out of solely DJ tool territory is the storytelling detail that headphones illuminate. The sound design of the EP’s title track—moving water, birdcall, and expansive effects like echo and reverb—sensually describes a bodily experience of standing in nature. There’s an all-back-to-mine ambient-house spirit to the song, one that speaks to dancing as a form of meditation. The name of the track remixes a phrase that describes the dissociative stare of a person with extreme trauma. Where “Thousand Year Stare” created an endless horizon, “Antihero” is awash with a sense of towering dread. The eerie techno track’s central see-sawing creak of a synth line evokes the claustrophobia of a cornfield, something that decades of horror movies have amped up. In comparison, “Ghost Mole” plays on ideas of interiors. The bass, drums, and digital percussion—including what might be pitched-up rave whistles—sound like they are bouncing off the plastic and concrete surfaces of a built environment. Around the halfway mark, the treatment of the bass and the higher frequencies suggests a second interior: the one inside your own chest. These augmented sounds call to mind rushing air and pounding blood. If the rest of the EP speaks to a sense of physicality, the final track, “Means Nothing,” performs an act of transcendence. Folding dream-state dancehall energy into the sunrise moment of a rave set, it takes interiority to its ultimate conclusion. Otik has called Burial, an artist whose music is closely associated with the wandering-wondering experience of traversing London by night bus, his “all-time favourite musician.” Thousand Year Stare does not sound like Burial, but it does paint a picture of a Bristol producer coming into his psychogeographic powers.","The Bristol native, now a London resident, maps the links between the two cities’ dance-music traditions in a four-track EP that infuses club energy with headphone-friendly nuance.

Selbstportrait Wahre Liebe,Roedelius,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1b214f1e7bf00092972bf/1:1/w_160/Selbstportra%CC%88t%20Wahre%20Liebe_Roedelius.jpg,2020-04-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roedelius-selbstportrait-wahre-liebe/,Bureau B,"Hans-Joachim Roedelius has led a remarkable life. He was born in Berlin in 1934 and appeared in films as a child. During World War II, his family moved to rural Germany to escape the fighting, and they were impoverished after the war. Roedelius was conscripted into the East German army as a teen, and later attempted to defect to the West; he successfully made it across in 1961, after two years in an East German prison. When he began making music in the late ’60s, it came out chaotic and primal, but over the following 50 years, both solo and as a member of Cluster and Harmonia, Roedelius has been one of the most influential and prolific members of the original wave of German experimental rock. His music is charming and pastoral in one moment, amorphous and mysterious the next. It is defiantly delicate, quietly radical. Some of Roedelius’ most lasting work on his own has been his Selbstportrait (Self-Portrait) series, from 1979-80. Realized with minimal equipment—mostly Farfisa, drum machine, and tape delay—the original trio of releases is intimate and beguiling, bringing to the fore the complexities of his musical personality. Self-portraits can be a connective thread between what we know of an artist’s life and their creative work, offering a glimpse into how they make meaning out of their experiences, their body, and their imagination. The music on Roedelius’ self-portraits, grounded and gentle, shows an artist moving forward from a tumultuous past into a peaceful, stable present, with whispers of melancholy barely audible but consistently implied. It’s hard to extricate his life story, with its escapes to the countryside punctuating moments of social upheaval, from the music he makes. Forty years after those definitive recordings, an octogenarian Roedelius returns to the Selbstportrait series. Selbstportrait Wahre Liebe (True Love) is remarkably similar in style, tone, and timbre to the original trilogy. As sentimental as his compositions can be, Roedelius continued to push himself into new sonic territory during his fifth decade of making music, primarily through collaborations with innovators like drummer Jon Mueller, C.M. Von Hausswolff, and Stefan Schneider of To Rococo Rot. The nostalgic bent of Wahre Liebe, his first solo release in nearly a decade, reveals a willingness to come full circle. On Wahre Liebe Roedelius is able to conjure many different moods without deviating from the round, bell-like tones of the Farfisa, an instrument he returns to after years of primarily working with acoustic piano and digital processing. “Geruhsam” is airy and buoyant, with a slow, playful melody that intuitively unfolds over bouncing organ pulses. “Winterlicht,” a plaintive piece performed without conspicuous overdubs, fills a similar niche as “Inselmoos,” from the original Selbstportrait LP, with its rubato tempo and overtly romantic flourishes. There’s a nebulous feel to “Nahwärme,” in which tones shimmer and bubble in waves of blissful ambience. Such disparate moods are what makes these self-portraits so insightful and fascinating; each piece reveals new aspects of Roedelius’ musical personality, adding new layers of emotional complexity. The album’s final track, “Aus weiter Ferne,” makes for a strangely irresolute ending, removed from Selbstportrait’s sonic origins but very much in its spirit. The 15-minute piece, by far the series’ longest, drifts in and out of wispy dissonance, slowly pushed forward by a hesitant, improvised melody and droning organ. The music is undefined and hard to grasp, moving through strange, disjointed chordal patterns. These are echoes of darkness, an acknowledgement of the irresolvable complexities of growing older, of reflecting on a life lived in its entirety. It may not be a satisfying ending, but it feels true, like an acknowledgement of pain that seamlessly flows from peacefulness and back again, obscured by time and memory. From that seed of ambiguity blooms the wisdom of Roedelius’ accumulated years.","Returning to the series of instrumental self-portraits he began in 1979, the German experimental rock pioneer, now 86, sounds reflective and at times melancholy, braiding peacefulness and pain.

My Garden,John Carroll Kirby,by: Nathan Taylor Pemberton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1b518f1e7bf00092972c0/1:1/w_160/My%20Garden_John%20Carroll%20Kirby.jpg,2020-04-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-carroll-kirby-my-garden/,Stones Throw,"Composition is a kind of cultivation: All the best stuff a product of daily toil. Beauty, for those who work at it, is as much a process as a physical product. It’s invisible and stashed deep below the surface, until it occasionally blooms for the benefit of us all. The producer, pianist, and composer John Carroll Kirby, a consummate cultivator and songwriter on recent records by Solange, Frank Ocean, and Harry Styles, has no difficulty coaxing beauty out from the depths of his own square of earth (or home studio). But on this new solo album of cloudless piano compositions for the Los Angeles label Stones Throw, Kirby unintentionally reveals a crucial trade secret of each job: Beauty itself is often no more important than the labor that brings it into the world. My Garden catches Kirby in the middle of this work, mostly at the piano, and on an array of digital accompaniment: synthesized pads, flutes, and sparse programmed drums that never get in the way of the keyboards. As a pianist, Kirby falls somewhere on a scale between Sun Ra’s blissed-out tappings and Ryuichi Sakamoto’s architectural precision. Despite the clout of Kirby’s past collaborations, who have taken him to unexpected corners of the musical world (location: Kali Uchis), he hasn’t used his solo albums to burnish a reputation as creative polymath or production guru. He’s taken a much quieter path on the music that bears his name, stretching back to 2018’s Meditations in Music, an eight-part ambient suite composed of Minimoog leads and minimal DX7 voices, released on the new-age-inclined Leaving Records. Kirby recently released a collection of piano-only compositions titled Conflict, recorded sometime last year, with the intent to “induce inner calm” in listeners shaken by the global crises triggered by the ongoing pandemic. The California-raised musician’s songs are so dogged in their pursuit of total aesthetic pleasure, they sound almost aloof in the context of a full album. Kirby’s production taste, melodic invention, and feel for surfacing grooves with the sparest of parts make him an unusually compelling musician. But the songs on My Garden seem unable to make a case for themselves, or for your attention, beyond this. The result is an album that wouldn’t sound out of place in the mood-based playlists of the Spotify universe, even if it would represent the very best of that world. Take album opener “Blueberry Beads,” which sounds heavily inspired by Head Hunters-era Herbie Hancock. Its sound alone is striking enough for repeat listens—block chords chomp through a swinging drum pattern, each instrument glued together by the sinewy upright bass work of JP Maramba, making this the album’s only collaboration. The song is essentially a single vamp played with laidback force and swagger, and it’s one of the album’s high points. But its single-mindedness amounts to nothing much more than one very cool groove which runs until it doesn’t run anymore—perhaps the point at which Kirby lost interest. There are few dynamics shaping or redirecting the energy flow on My Garden’s nine songs, making for capricious endings. For “Beads,” which runs three and a half minutes, Kirby simply removes the song’s core elements one by one before his piano freestyles across the double bar lines. There’s a diaristic air to My Garden. Kirby’s songs commence with little preamble, as if we’ve stumbled into a folder containing his works in progress. This isn’t to say the album is carelessly dashed off, but Kirby is content to move quickly and chase new leads when they appear. New ideas pop up in rapid succession, even though the tempos on My Garden never break out of a leisurely stroll. In “Night Croc” and “San Nicolas Island,” Kirby crafts melodies with a neat geometric precision, playful inventions that sometimes seem like they are leading Kirby by the hand, rather than the other way around. Still, his arrangements perpetually expose a deft studio touch. He expertly inserts divergent textures—shimmering Moog swells and paunchy synth-bass hits that break over a song’s surface—without interrupting these daydreams, casting each song in subtly different light. But these subtleties box My Garden into a gray zone of sorts. This isn’t quite a background accompaniment; nor is it an immersive, deep-listening experience. It’s a collection of short stories, where a novel might make more sense for the approach. Kirby’s competent home production, and his economic arrangements, amount to a rich product that still manages to sound one-dimensional on repeat listenings, with little sonic depth. And his predilection for the occasional bright melody line works at cross purposes with his atmospheric tendencies. The album can never fully let itself recede into pure ambience. Instead, like the “my” in the title, Kirby’s latest album does feel a tad possessive. Instead of inviting listeners into his music, he’s exposing us to it. You can hear how he works his way through a musical fantasy, but it’s difficult to access the feeling of it, perhaps with the exception of album closer “Wind.” The longest song, it opens with cascading lines that have been digitally edited and chopped in a way that recalls the sloshing runs of Ethiopian pianist Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. Kirby’s hands work expressively at the piano, teasing at a melancholy style that’s somewhere between rag and gospel, before the chords settle into the grip of a steady drum pattern. It’s the clearest moment of levity across the album—a lone pianist playing with the sounds in his head, not stopping to wonder if anything beautiful will come of it.","The Los Angeles pianist, a collaborator of Solange and Frank Ocean, sinks back into spare soul-jazz and meditative new age, occupying a middle ground between deep and easy listening.

Flowers on the Weekend,Asher Roth,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1c6c34e26030008ba4f00/1:1/w_160/Flowers%20on%20The%20Weekend_Asher%20Roth.jpg,2020-04-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/asher-roth-flowers-on-the-weekend/,Retrohash,"Asher Roth soundtracked a generation of sweaty basements’ Thirsty Thursdays; now he stuffs his songs with asides about Senate reform and garbled philosophical platitudes. “If heaven closed its gates and hell was broke/And all you had was every day you woke/Would you be hella woke?” he asks on his new album’s first track. If you answered yes, you’re in for a treat—welcome to Asher Roth’s wokeness parade, where he fumbles towards opinions on: gluten consumption, baby boomers, climate change, marijuana decriminalization, the American healthcare system, and mortgage interest rates. “I think there’s too many men,” he announces on the cringely titled “Cher in Chernobyl,” a stubbornly unself-aware bid at feminism from the guy whose most rousing commitment to gender equality used to be chanting that he loved women just as much as he loved drinking. Even the album title is a self-congratulatory bastardization of gender politics—Asher Roth’s girlfriend brings him flowers, we learn on the title track. Please clap. Maybe we should credit Roth for attempting growth at all. Nearly every album of his since Asleep in the Bread Aisle has both tried to inch away from and capitulated to the formula that launched his career: half-baked rhymes about Banker’s Club and keg stands, belched over  wobbly bass. If Asher Roth didn’t create frat rap, he at least directly inspired a new strain of it—Sammy Adams, best known for a thrashing song that rhymed “Vegas” and “Jager,” got a record deal after remixing “I Love College.” Hoodie Allen grunted diatribes about sororities over drum kicks and now tours across campuses. The grunting, pastel-shorts aesthetics of frat rap have burbled beyond colleges. Lil Dicky has a TV show and a billboard in Times Square; weeks ago, two TikTok stars apparently paid some ungodly amount of money to mercenary producers to manufacture a “diss track,” their sneers and intonations carved in Roth’s image. Roth’s legacy, with all its thoughtless misogyny and beer-bong coveting, is the reason he can get Lil Yachty to come gurgle a guest verse a decade after “I Love College.” But it’s also why his new political posing, however well-intentioned it may be, is so hard to take seriously. “I’m every shared experience/I’m serious, I’m kidding,” Roth raps on the album’s opener, which doesn’t do much to clarify whether the album is an earnest proclamation of the rapper’s politics or one long, excruciating bit. Either way, Flowers’ most firm commitment is to bludgeoning language and logic. “I’ve had to learn to relent/To relearn how to vent/Scent is certainly concerning/Gotta learn to ascend,” Roth babbles at one point; “Got gluten in your doo doo,” he warbles at another. On “Back of the Classroom,” an attempt to appease whoever’s skipping through the album until they hear a college reference, his frenetic flow is a dead ringer for Hoodie Allen’s, a kind of snake-eats-tail moment of frat-rap synchronicity. The production alternates between grating open-mic-night theatrics—clanging cymbals, cloying bursts of trumpet, audible whoops—and plodding drums. Saxophones bleat; a ukulele plunks along. “Dark Chocolate” emerges out of this murk, a total surprise of contorting guitar riffs and reverberating synths in which Asher Roth strains for a falsetto and doesn’t rap once. The song seems like his take on Tame Impala, and while the track isn’t entirely unpleasant, it’s jarringly out of place, like a church organ rolled on stage at a Pitbull concert. Throughout the album, Asher Roth goes out of his way to reference his age. He groans that his back hurts. He moans that he’s been “doing this” for so long. At 34, he could have believably crammed the record with canned, beer-sloshed party stories; it’s telling of Asher, or maybe of the world right now, that his brags center on reading about private prisons, not on sex or shots or drugs. Still, these songs are frictionless and forgettable. You almost want him to have gotten his wish—to stay in college forever, where at least he could pretend to have fun.","Welcome to the frat-rap perpetrator’s wokeness parade.

BLQLYTE,Zeroh,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1ca6ef1e7bf00092972c4/1:1/w_160/BLQLYTE_Zeroh.jpg,2020-04-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/zeroh-blqlyte/,Leaving,"The elusive Los Angeles rapper-producer and engineer Zeroh, born Edwin Liddie Jr., has been active for nearly a decade, but he’s been covering his tracks. As Blaqbird, Zeroh, and a few other different names, Liddie Jr. released music for free on Tumblr, eventually linking up with producer Jonwayne, electronic musician Shlohmo, and the Wedidit crew. He became immersed in the L.A. beat scene, sampling Flying Lotus and Georgia Anne Muldrow and working with producers like the late Ras G and Low Leaf. For a while, some assumed Zeroh was the rapper behind the Captain Murphy character because of his connection to Low End Theory, his knack for hiding in plain sight, and his smudging, multisyllabic wordplay. In many ways, BLQLYTE is a culmination of his many years of experimentation. Created over a six-year span and entirely self-produced, his debut for Leaving Records is a journey of discovery within his world of shadows, and it is his best and most stimulating music yet. In its consideration of the effects of psychoactive drugs on the mind, the album shares lessons learned through introspection, though not in any straightforward manner. Just as a black light often reveals things unseen by the naked eye, on BLQLYTE, Zeroh illuminates the things that go unobserved in dark places. It can sometimes be difficult to derive any linear meaning from Zeroh’s songs, but their freeform narratives can be riveting just for how they sound. He revels in challenging listeners, and his sentences break apart until they begin to smear. On the title track, his bars dissolve into a phonetic soup (“Hue imbued human suit on two-inch tape/Tried and true like chest techniques”). The deeper you get into any verse, the more unbound it seems to become, and they are even headier when taken in the context of a psychedelic odyssey. “You should be shrooming in the ashram/Superhuman in the strug’/Levitating through the chasm/Cause hitting rock bottom may never be enough,” he raps on “4D.” There is something to be gained for the casual listener, the careful listener, and the mindful one. More impressive than Zeroh’s improvement as a beatmaker or his sharpened skill as a writer is his evolution as a producer. If there was ever a knock on his music before, it was that nothing bound his projects together, but BLQLYTE shows a gloomy and glitchy personal style forming. The whirring vortex of synths on “Invaluable” sounds like being sucked into an airlock. On “Mudblood,” wheezing electronics and misfiring drums settle into a mosaic, his raps skipping along the edges. Closer “Aquamane” is hushed, rippling, and bottomless; it sounds like the ocean floor. There are a handful of mentions of microdosing, and it feels like Zeroh is trying to induce a mini-hallucination or trigger some sort of breakthrough—if not in you, then in himself. His production is nearly heady enough to pull it off. Zeroh’s nature is to obfuscate, but here that obfuscation is stylized and purposeful. He wrings meaning from murk, tangible feelings from riddles. “It definitely feels like stuntin’ when you bend/blur the lines and show people what’s possible,” he recently said, and according to this metric, he is definitely stunting across BLQLYTE. In so doing, Zeroh both reintroduces himself and redefines what is possible for his music.","The enigmatic Los Angeles rapper-producer's latest is a journey of discovery within a world of shadows, and his best and most stimulating music yet.

Agitprop Alterna,Peel Dream Magazine,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ea1fde6820bb800085ac828/1:1/w_160/Agitprop%20Alterna_Peel%20Dream%20Magazine.jpg,2020-04-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peel-dream-magazine-agitprop-alterna/,SlumberlandTough Love,"For as long as Stereolab have written songs about the ills of capitalism, and Broadcast have named lofty indie-pop albums after Gertrude Stein books, there’s been modish art-school types making records that feel like the musical equivalent of a tattered paperback in a back pocket. It’s the kind of lush, atmospheric rock music that might involve buying a Mellotron off Craigslist, naming your band after a famous British radio host, and writing lyrics that could double as poetry in the right context. Peel Dream Magazine, the brainchild of Brooklyn’s Joe Stevens, fits neatly into this lineage. Agitprop Alterna, the band’s second album, is a 38-minute shoegaze record that feels a bit like a term paper on Bertolt Brecht and Karl Marx, written to a soundtrack of Tropicália, motorik, and library music. Out of the gate, Agitprop Alterna is a bookish listen that doesn’t sound particularly unique. At first, it’s tempting to call it My Bloody Valentine karaoke: The endless guitar distortion and the well-matched vocals of Stevens and copilot Jo-Anne Hyun distinctly recall Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher. With meditative vocals, outstretched layers of guitar dissonance, and chugging synthesizer, opener “Pill” is prime Loveless pastiche. “Tongue/Pill/I chew/It’s all I do,” Hyun and Stevens sing in calming harmony. The implication is obvious—we’ve all gone numb, relying on drugs to dull the pain of everyday life—yet the song is so undeniably catchy and relaxing that it produces exactly that kind of anesthetic effect. The same can be said for the rest of the record; Agitprop Alterna might be full of grand ideas, but it doesn’t bombard you with information. More often than not, the lyrical content is on the simpler side. Agitprop Alterna can best be understood as the sum of its influences: a patchwork of brainy indie-pop music from the past 30 years that flows together seamlessly. Soothing drones, a tranquilized drum machine, and Painful-era Yo La Tengo flourishes allow “It’s My Body” to chirp along like a baby bird. The snarky “NYC Illuminati,” one of the record’s least conceptually legible offerings, is dotted in guitar reverb by way of Galaxie 500 and full of late-night stoner truisms like “you stand for nothing at all” or “dressed in fantastic/illusions of starvation.” The equally lofty “The Bertolt Brecht Society,” an homage to the German theater theoretician and playwright, is constructed around a serene vintage organ and a delicate bass groove. Lovely and introspective, it feels as though it were written while deep in thought. “Up and Up,” the album’s last track, is its finest moment. Competing synth lines rest upon one another like layers of oil in water, and a plodding guitar brightens the scene like light through stained glass. “There are answers the theater will provide/For shallow faces taught to sleep through bigger questions,” Hyun and Stevens sing, summoning Brecht once more. Perhaps those faces belong to us, the song seems to say. It’s a striking—albeit slightly goofy—line on an album with plenty of similarly absurd brain-teasers. Like all the best shoegaze records, Agitprop Alterna is a heady, inward-looking listen. But if you’re able to zone out, or simply to begin walking with no destination in mind, its oversized and introspective ideas make welcome company.","Bearing a distinct resemblance to My Bloody Valentine, the Brooklyn shoegaze band’s second album is a patchwork of brainy indie-pop influences with its own absurdist charm.

Skylarking,XTC,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f671c820bb800085ac813/1:1/w_160/Skylarking_XTC.jpg,2020-04-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/xtc-skylarking/,GeffenVirgin,"Late one morning in 1986, Todd Rundgren awoke at the Sunset Marquis hotel in West Hollywood to ominous news: A space shuttle had disintegrated in the stratosphere, killing the entire crew on live TV. The same morning, he received a message from the British wing of Virgin Records, concerning a wily pop band from rural England. In the label’s view, XTC were in dire need of a no-nonsense producer, arranger, and authority figure, preferably all in one—somebody with an American touch and a hint of the madcap and... well, how did his schedule look? Rundgren’s appointment secured the savvy pairing of two brilliant and doomed minds. Between the anglophile producer and songsmith Andy Partridge were a thousand common interests and one great chasm that would subsume egos and tear up the studio floorboards. The rift did not concern taste or etiquette so much as—how else to put it—vibe: In one corner, the shaggy-haired, acid-frazzled Philadelphian whose passive-aggression belies a loose, honky-tonk approach to life; in the other, a three-piece reputed for 1) turning down their record label’s cocaine and 2) crafting technically brilliant pop. It was a match made in some 5-star hotel-lobby hell, and the calamity of it all enriches every second of Skylarking. Rundgren was optimistic about working with XTC. A few years earlier, he had caught the Swindon group in their element, twisting from off-brand punk toward whip-smart new wave. Soon after, in 1982, Partridge suddenly quit touring, suffering from valium withdrawal and on-stage panic attacks. He announced XTC would join the ranks of Steely Dan and late-phase Beatles as a studio outfit—a commercial disaster, to nobody’s surprise. Singles flopped, fans lost faith, and before the year was up, the group shrank to a trio when drummer Terry Chambers stormed out for good during a rehearsal. But by 1985, Partridge, at least, believed XTC were in the form of their lives. Though recent LPs Mummer and The Big Express lacked a hit to follow 1982’s “Senses Working Overtime,” the frontman’s studio indulgence (and bossiness) finally had free rein, even as the band entered free-fall. A parachute opened when the Dukes of Stratosphear, their cartoonish side project, released a period-psychedelia EP that briskly outsold the previous XTC record. Virgin hoped an American producer would collar the firebrand and hammer the new album into the transatlantic mold of U2 and Simple Minds—a notion that, like almost everything involving the label, Partridge found laughable. Consider the demos: Back-garden symphonies like “Summer’s Cauldron” and “Season Cycle,” among his ripest compositions to date. Fellow songwriter Colin Moulding, inspired by his move to the ancient Celtic settlement of Marlborough Downs, was clomping down the same path, composing pastorals like “Grass” and “The Meeting Place” from sampled lathes and thrums of pagan folk. If anything, Partridge reasoned, the album would be their most English ever. Caught between a quixotic artiste and a label tapping its watch, Rundgren was diplomatic. Who was he, a producer extraordinaire whose second home was a spacecraft-style recording bunker, to mock a studio fiend like Partridge? Hatching a plan, he accepted Virgin’s $150,000 fee and quickly discarded dozens of the band’s demos, assembling a tracklist around a concept of his own. The song cycle would plot a lifetime over the course of a day: daybreak in “Summer’s Cauldron,” then a suite of infatuation, heartbreak, marriage, temptation, and existential reckoning that concludes—on “Dying” and “Sacrificial Bonfire”—in the dead of night. All this was news to the band. To Partridge, it was virtually treasonous. The 32-year-old was still on the mend from a 14-year addiction to valium prescribed for erratic school behavior,  and had landed in an enlightenment phase, philosophizing over nature and “questioning things deeper: God, existence—the chewier questions,” he later said. The transformation in his lyrics was undeniable; and his voice, once a rabid yelp, had softened into serene hysteria, like a rescue puppy outgrowing its trauma. Despite their media portrayal as backwater bumpkins, XTC were brewing a new identity—something a star producer would surely dilute. Partridge’s bandmates felt differently. Guitarist Dave Gregory, a Rundgren superfan, was thrilled, and the docile Moulding—by now immune to Partridge’s arm-twisting—sided with Virgin, reasoning they all had mouths to feed. If only to humor them, Partridge held his nose and acquiesced. At his Utopia studio in the Catskills, Rundgren insisted on recording the songs in order, so sessions commenced with “Summer’s Cauldron.” His fingerprints are instantly visible: Skylarking opens in the nervous charge of dawn amid dog barks and crickets. As Rundgren’s melodica smears sunlight across the horizon, Partridge swans in from the wings and belts out a Broadway-sized croon, duetting with the lazy arc of a Moulding bassline. Just as the song builds to fever pitch, the producer plays his ace, scooping you out of “Summer’s Cauldron” with the summer’s-breeze strings of “Grass,” Moulding’s ode to al-fresco romance. A dreamy riff plays off his West Country burr, fizzles and dies like something unsaid. Beneath Skylarking’s twin sunrise, optimism was dimming. It’s hard to pinpoint when hell broke loose, but within a few days the studio had descended into extravagant pettiness. Partridge says Rundgren had sarcasm down to “an extremely cruel art,” mocking everything from his lyrics to his trousers; when the singer flubbed a vocal take, he impatiently offered to record him a guide track. Partridge, in turn, deemed Rundgren’s keyboard skills “incredibly primitive,” nicknaming him Old Banana Fingers. Whenever the producer hulked toward the studio, weary and long-faced, the band had taken to jamming the “Munsters” theme tune. One flustered night, Partridge gathered his bandmates. “I’m thinking of knocking the album on the head,” he confessed. “It’s like having two Hitlers in the same bunker.” As war raged, the sessions remained a spring of wonder. Moulding, a psych-pop reformist, came into his own with songs like “The Meeting Place,” reflecting Swindon’s rituals and industry in gorgeous stained glass. Partridge specialized in the melodic trapdoor, establishing awkward patterns and flooding your serotonin receptors at unexpected moments. The lyrics are just chewy enough to distract from each incoming sugar rush, creating endless replay value. (“Who’s pushing the pedals on the season cycle?” he quips wonderfully in “Season Cycle.”) Themes and images trespass between songs, from the vaudevillian pomp of “Ballet for a Rainy Day” into the melodramatic “1000 Umbrellas,” whose Dave Gregory string arrangement makes heartbreak seem an ancient, noble fate. In all this, Skylarking expresses a comic, cosmic apprehension of the natural world—not the banal site of ready-made tranquility but the arena of psychedelia, godliness, and permanence. Partridge and Moulding grew up on the border between urban and rural Swindon, ever ready to abandon the cinema of smalltown life, hop a fence, and explore a fantasyland of wildlife. Their formative years account for two XTC archetypes: the put-upon breadwinner and the serene observer of nature. That contrast—as much as Partridge and Moulding’s divergence—is a crux of the band’s character. Part of the tension with Rundgren was that his pastoral concept snubbed Partridge’s trademark social commentaries. Though his politics were fuzzy, the songwriter took pride in penning morality plays that skewered Middle England’s delusions of grandeur, sending up the bootlicking class that was then rallied behind Margaret Thatcher. Before parlaying that skill into songs like the anti-fascist operetta “No Thugs in Our House,” young Partridge had been famed for caricaturing schoolteachers, and it was this hobby that established creativity as his lifeline: initially to distract bullies, then simply to show off, drumming up attention he lacked at home. Though Partridge’s father played in a Navy skiffle band, his periods of absence and violence afforded little investment in his son’s artistic pursuits; his mother, whose mental health struggles led to electro-shock therapy, dished out verbal abuse and often sent Partridge to stay with other families, giving him “no sense of permanence about anything,” he explained in the book Complicated Game. Music and satire were pillars of Partridge’s identity that Rundgren would threaten to demolish. The songwriter’s roots in social antagonism deepened in his teens, which he spent pottering between oddball bands in a tasseled suede jacket, observing Swindon’s social and cultural trends from afar. XTC missed the 1976 punk rush because he had a job as a window dresser in a Victorian emporium. While the band had contemporaries in Elvis Costello and Robyn Hitchcock, the late-’70s new wave stopped short of welcoming Leonard Bernstein nostalgists. Assembling the Skylarking tracklist, Rundgren had shot down all but one addition to the band’s catalog of smalltown vignettes. To his credit, it may be their very best. Grounded by a snare that sounds airlifted in from a quarry, “Earn Enough for Us” spins a power-pop yarn pitting love against the material restrictions of poverty: “So you’re saying that we’re gonna be three/Now, a father’s what I’ll be,” Partridge sings between snakes-and-ladders hooks. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m so proud, but the belt’s already tight/I’ll get another job at night...” Despite rankling Partridge, Skylarking’s departure from sociology frees space for wildcards like “That’s Really Super, Supergirl,” a reject that Rundgren rescued, sped up, and made garish. His funhouse keys and a helter-skelter bassline lean into the lyrics’ comics-nerd pathos, Partridge sarcastically commending a girlfriend who presumes to ditch him for his own good. On tape, it came out as a burbling blast of Disneyfied pop. Partridge was horrified. “Could you play it a bit tighter?” he yelled, exasperated, as Rundgren perched behind the keyboard. “That was good enough!” the producer replied. Rundgren was gallivanting about like a ludicrous child savant—one moment darkly inscrutable, the next digging out cobwebbed keyboards and swaggering into the light. While Partridge fumed, Moulding and Gregory wrestled with their own frustrations. A month into recording, relocating to San Francisco for overdubs failed to heal rifts cleaved between the trio years earlier. During bass sessions for “Earn Enough for Us,” Moulding briefly quit the band, collateral damage in a Rundgren-Partridge power struggle that was now crescendoing. At one point, says the producer, Partridge fantasized aloud about plunging an axe into his head. Occasional stabs at communication worked miracles. Rundgren’s ability to brandish spectacular arrangements from his back pocket freed the band to reinvent songs on the spot. On a whim, he flipped a dirge called “The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul” into something fancy and louche; the recorded version saunters like a Scott Walker Bond theme. Partridge was justifiably wary of Rundgren’s exhibitionism, but in the wonderland of Skylarking, where Moulding’s bucolic songs are right at home, it is Partridge’s—bedecked in half-drunk keys and Vegas suave—that astonish. For a while, Partridge feared the completed album was ruined. He lambasted “Herr Rundgren” in the press and, as usual, fought bitterly with the label—but this time, with roles reversed, it was Virgin selling him on his music’s merit. As Skylarking awaited its fate, he and Moulding sulked in his Swindon loft and, on a giant board spread across the floor, set about re-enacting the great battles of 18th Century Europe. Lead single “Grass” bombed in the UK, and the album stalled at No. 90—a death sentence even by their commercial standards, albeit grim vindication for Partridge. But in America, a one-time single contender demoted to a B-side was making hay. On college radio, “Dear God” had sparked a moral panic: its narrator, griping with an absent god, appalled Bible Belt Christians and prompted a bomb threat to a Florida radio station. Everyone else seemed to love it. In a sheepish U-turn, the band’s American label, Geffen, smuggled the track onto the U.S. release of Skylarking. Over six months, the album outsold XTC’s entire prior catalog three times over. For all “Dear God”’s histrionic conviction, Partridge remains skeptical of his biggest hit, a pedantic screed that itches with a trite, secular holiness of its own. As a college-rock time capsule, it’s delightful; as for its moral import, Partridge was spitballing more soulful takes with interviewers. “If you can create Heaven for yourself without creating Hell for somebody else, fine,” he told the fanzine Limelight. “Try and create Heaven for somebody else as well, but don’t create Hell for anyone, ’cos that’s less than animal.” Partridge had finally earned the cachet to pursue a better contract with Virgin. But negotiations faltered and, after two more albums, the band went on strike, eventually winning the right to release elsewhere in 1997. Partridge never lost his air of thwarted ambition, drifting into the future for which he seemed destined: tinkering away in his home studio, mostly free of expectations and interlopers. (That includes Moulding, who stepped back from XTC in 2006, effectively ending the group.) Among his arsenal of guitars, Partridge now keeps company with a legion of toy soldiers, battle-prepped and awaiting its master’s command. In Skylarking’s immanent grace, you sense the perverse chemistry of warmongers relishing a battlefield bloodbath. A sweet photo from the sessions catches their repressed innocence: Gregory, Rundgren, and Partridge in fleeting unity, mouths agape, serenely piping out vowel sounds. Here you have Skylarking’s ideal form: three adult boys accidentally in their thirties, pooling harmonies for Partridge to plunge into, like something beautiful shot from the sky.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

ChangesNowBowie,David Bowie,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f49eaf1e7bf00092972ae/1:1/w_160/CHANGESNOWBOWIE_David%20Bowie.jpg,2020-04-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-changesnowbowie/,Parlophone,"David Bowie’s first greatest-hits set was called Changesonebowie, and the title has proven irresistible to his compilers: That collection was followed by 1981’s Changestwobowie, 1990’s Changesbowie, and 1997’s radio special ChangesNowBowie. Interspersing clips of a long interview with Mary Anne Hobbs with exclusive performances recorded during November 1996 rehearsals for his 50th-birthday concert at Madison Square Garden, ChangesNowBowie originally aired on BBC Radio 1 the week of Bowie’s birthday. Bowie was feeling valedictory at the time, a mood that came through in both the musing interviews and the laid-back performances, backed only by guitarist Reeves Gabrels, bassist/vocalist Gail Ann Dorsey, and keyboardist Mark Plati. The Hobbs-hosted show circulated intact on bootlegs for years, and the official LP was initially slated as a Record Store Day 2020 exclusive. Thanks to COVID-19, the physical release was pushed back, but the digital version is here, and the sanctioned release differs from the fans-only versions in substantial ways. All the interview segments with Hobbes have been excised, as have the birthday wishes from his peers and acolytes, leaving a tight 32 minutes of music—nine songs that appear in a different order than they did in the broadcast. In strict terms of listenability, all the edits are logical. Radio requires a different rhythm than an album, and the BBC Radio 1 broadcast sometimes bogged down in discussions, albeit many of them fascinating. The show hit its emotional peak with a greeting from Scott Walker, who thanked Bowie “for your generosity in spirit when it comes to other artists. I’ve been the beneficiary on more than one occasion, let me tell you,” a sentiment that left Bowie speechless and teary. It was the one time he let his guard slip in the interview. Throughout the rest of the broadcast, he was garrulous and charming, sounding utterly comfortable embracing his role as an elder statesman of rock. The live performances have a similar spirit, sounding so relaxed they’re almost cozy. Tellingly, Bowie’s setlist avoids songs from both the dark, roiling Brian Eno reunion 1. Outside and the drum’n’bass-besotted Earthling, which would appear a month after his 50th birthday. These two records found Bowie wrestling with contemporary music, but apart from a version of “The Man Who Sold the World”—a nod to Nirvana popularizing the song a few years earlier on their MTV Unplugged—the modern world barely can be discerned on ChangesNowBowie. Although Bowie conspicuously avoids the big hits, the songs are largely drawn from the early 1970s—even the Velvet Underground’s “White Light/White Heat,” heard here in a stomping version, was a staple in concerts by the Spiders From Mars—leaving just the Lodger deep cut 
“Repetition” and Tin Machine song “Shopping for Girls” as the album’s surprises. Next to warhorses like “Lady Stardust,” “Aladdin Sane,” and “Andy Warhol,” these are comparative novelties and they catch the ear: “Repetition” receives a lanky acoustic rearrangement, and without the heavy thump of the Hunt Brothers, “Shopping for Girls” turns sprightly and lithe. Save these two selections and the VU cover, ChangesNowBowie is built for comfort, not speed. Bowie understood that the audience for this BBC Radio 1 show was upscale and settled, perhaps nurturing a slight nostalgic bent, and he adjusted his performance accordingly, giving the people something close to what they want: old tunes—but not oldies—performed with skill and a burnished grace. Looking back, the live-in-the-studio set seems slightly out of step with Bowie’s adventurous 1990s, feeling more of a piece with the rock classicism he’d play at the dawn of the 2000s. It also feels slight. Unlike other Bowie live albums, this doesn’t document a specific tour or phase. It’s just a quiet, pleasant footnote to a busy era.","This set of cozy, stripped-back rehearsal recordings, later broadcast in a 1997 special, finds Bowie in a valedictory mood.

SXTP4,The-Dream,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f4e7c43b931000881ddae/1:1/w_160/Sextape%204_The%20Dream.jpg,2020-04-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-dream-sextape-4/,Radio KillaHITCO,"The-Dream’s last project, 2019’s Ménage à Trois: Sextape Vol. 1, 2, 3, opened with the sound of two people fucking in a rainstorm. The singer had spent years describing sex in a variety of locales—from the beackseats of every luxury vehicle imaginable to a padded room in a psych ward—but this time he decided to cut out the middleman—himself—and just present the raw act without adornment. It set the tone: This wasn’t a record to create a dance challenge to; this was music made for one thing and one thing only. In an era when some of the biggest rappers in the world proudly proclaim celibacy, Terius Nash is a throwback to an older, more explicit era. What came next was 39 tracks that replaced the cheeky metaphors and innuendos of his past work with straight-up filth. It never justified the king-sized runtime, but the magic of his songwriting still glimmered occasionally. His followup, SXTP4, is nearly a quarter of the length, suggesting a more cohesive affair, trimmed of fat. Instead it’s another leisurely stroll through the studio for Nash as he strings together a satisfying batch of R&B—but only really strives for transcendence once. But what a moment that is. In many ways, “Hard 4 Me” is one of Nash’s most stripped-down tracks ever, glued together by a smattering of synths that sound like they came straight from an old Casio preset. Its emptiness leaves space for his sultry squeak of a voice, which is divine at carving out melodic pockets in the groove. Here he uses it to beckon a potential lover to come over after work and, true to recent form, he wastes no time with pleasantries: “Come straight here and take your shit off,” he asserts. It feels like something made in about 15 minutes, but its rough-hewn finish feels like proof of Nash’s ability to sit down at any given instrument and crank out something infectious. The two tracks that precede it, “Notice” and “Spiritual,” play like alternate versions of the same song, with Nash exploring different directions he can take its chords and lyrics; it feels like we’re witnessing a Pro Tools session in real time. Its overflow cements the fact that “Hard 4 Me” is the project’s centerpiece, with the rest of the works sounding fairly low-stakes in comparison. The opener may be the most egregious example of that, as all clues point to it being a scrapped reference track for Diddy. Not only are the Bad Boy Records’ founder’s signature ad-libs all over it, but the verses also seem to be written from his perspective, with a reference to his former partner Notorious B.I.G.’s passing woven in. On the opposite end, the closer “Coltrane” is a pile-up of piano strums that goes nowhere, bookending the album with two equally perplexing showings. “Wee Hours,” revealed in the project’s digital liner notes to be cultivated from a Jhené Aiko demo, fairs better. On it, Nash shows off his signature vocal style where he isolates syllables and stretches and scrunches them until they become their own melodies, just like he did with the “ellas” and “ehs” of Rihanna’s “Umbrella” nearly 15 years ago now. Aiko takes the horniness baton and runs with it by boasting how she keeps hair ties and scrunchies on her just in case her hands need to be tied down. The pair make it all sound sweet, handling the hardcore subject matter with softness. The one other notable moment here is the aptly titled “Fuck My Brains Out,” another song on SXTP4 pulled from the archives—this time in its entirety, as it was first released almost a decade ago in the leadup to his fourth album, 1977—but nonetheless continues Nash’s streak of making admirable Prince pastiche. It’s no “Fast Car,” “Yamaha,” or “Hell Mary” off Vol. 1, 2, 3, all of which were dazzling in how they reworked the Purple One’s trademark sounds into something refreshing and relevant. But its glossy finish, pounding rhythm and emphatic howls demonstrate how Nash is of a dying breed of R&B singer, one that builds roaring muscle-car engines of funk to move arenas with.

Antarctica,Flat Worms,by: Brian Coney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f516c94034a00082e7a2f/1:1/w_160/Antarctica_Flat%20Worms.jpg,2020-04-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flat-worms-antarctica/,God?,"Flat Worms don’t lack talent. Frontman Will Ivy is flanked by drummer Justin Sullivan (Kevin Morby, The Babies) and bassist Tim Hellman, who’s played with Ty Segall and Oh Sees. In late 2017, the Los Angeles garage rockers’ kinetic and scrappy self-titled debut delivered a fuzzed-out blitz with no real agenda. Three years on, they’ve upgraded their sound: Steve Albini and Segall co-man the desk at Electrical Audio, where the trio recorded their second album. The setup may be a rock nerd’s dream, but the cleaned-up sound doesn’t do them any favors; Antarctica is a dour proposal for a societal reset that winds up feeling distracted by hero worship. Opener and lead single “The Aughts” makes for a promising start, melding the sneering spectre of latter-day Fall with Ivy’s pointed decrees. It’s a promise the album struggles to keep. Though Albini’s style suits the pummeling “Plastic Casts,” the shift from scorched earworms to taut, cookie-cutter post-punk becomes distracting. It’s one thing to ape a classic Albini recording like Shellac’s “Steady as She Goes” with an obvious homage like “Wet Concrete,” but on Albini’s own watch? He’d be within his rights to seek a secondary credit. Thematically, Antarctica suggests a through-line between the chaos of modern society and the titular desolate continent. But many of these songs fumble the intent quite badly. “Market Forces” takes questionable aim at the state and mass media: “Personality cult chambers/Showcase the peacock feathers.” “Stick to the formula, turn out another/Four on the floor, the greatest night ever,” goes “Ripper One,” an admission of mediocrity as much as anything else. While Flat Worms’ punk heroes—like Mark E. Smith, or Nikki Sudden of Swell Maps—could wield ambiguity like a scythe, here empty words take center stage. Warbly, woozed-out guitar forays help to blunt the lack of conviction. The seasick lead phrases on mid-album peak “Via” and the forcefield of feedback at the tail end of “The Aughts” ease the absence of the full-blown fuzz that made Flat Worms such a heady trip. The hand of Segall—who recorded the band’s The Apparition/Melt The Arms 7"" and last year’s Into the Iris EP, and releases Antarctica via his Drag City imprint GOD? Records—surely plays a part in bringing these silver linings to light. But to stand out in a supersaturated garage scene, Ivy and co. must command focus. The pencil-drawn analogy between Antarctica and the here-and-now isn’t exactly a reach, but the album’s perspective is blurry at best. Though Antarctica positions itself as an assessment of worldly chaos and isolation, it’s never clear whether the stance is earnest or apathetic. Even Albini-tier fidelity can’t make this formula sound fresh.","Even with help from Ty Segall and Steve Albini, the Los Angeles garage-rock trio’s second album reaches for a grand analogy its cookie-cutter post-punk can’t support.

Innocent Country 2,Quelle ChrisChris Keys,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f254b43b931000881dda8/1:1/w_160/Innocent%20Country%202_Quelle%20Chris.jpg,2020-04-24 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/quelle-chris-innocent-country-2/,Mello Music Group,"You’ll never catch Quelle Chris doing what’s expected of him. The bohemian Detroit rapper-producer hit new levels of excellence on both the Jean Grae joint project Everything’s Fine, and Guns, his meditation on American violence. On the back of those wins, a sequel to Innocent Country—the 2015 collaboration with producer Chris Keys—seemed as unlikely as it was unnecessary. Take it from Quelle Chris himself, who when ranking his projects back in 2017 for Vice, placed the record fourth on a six-album list. But the pair enjoy the relationship of two old buddies naturally cozy in each other’s presence. “I think at that time I would be at Chris’s spot in Oakland and we’d just smoke, chill, watch random shit, get food, listen to some music, make some beats, write songs, repeat,” Quelle told Vice. On the sequel, the pair recaptures this easy chemistry, serving up a set as blissful as a buzzed-on-beer snooze on a hot summer afternoon. Keys’ soft piano, organ keys, and light rat-tat-tat drums call on the soulful spirit of old Minnie Riperton instrumentals, and the melancholic jazz of “Black Twitter” could pass for an old Bob James cut. It’s fair to say the lack of tension can feel like the album’s weakness—Innocent Country 2 could use something like “Wild Minks,” Chris’s team-up with Mach-Hommy from Guns, to break up the good vibes—but Keys’ beats stay as perfect a fit for Quelle as his high-peaked baseball caps, helping the album’s lengthy running time to breeze by. Whenever Innocent Country 2 threatens to fade into a pleasant blur, guests help pick up the pace. Homeboy Sandman storms onto “Sacred Safe,” raging that “Every single person on Earth irks me,” while the churchly sounds of “Mirage” might be the brightest beat Earl Sweatshirt has rapped over in ages. Other appearances are less expected. Merrill Garbus appears on three songs, the best of which, “Graphic Bleed Outs,” shows the Tune-Yards singer scale down her usually powerful voice to line up with Keys’ dreamy flutes while she asserts that a lover has slashed at her spirit like a cold blade piercing her lungs. The counterbalance of gore and tranquility is jarring, but if there’s one thing you need to enter Quelle Chris’s world, it’s a mind open enough to reject conventional logic. It’s Chris, finally, who anchors the project. Unlike Guns, his goals here are modest but fully realized. He can swing from wry one-liners to guy-in-bar observations; he can offer goofy jokes or cutting narratives. “Living Happy” investigates the idea of crossing to the other side; in a delivery that sounds more traveling preacher than rapper, Chris envisions his own death: “Couldn’t find the energy to fight the call of the tunnel’s light,” he asserts before describing the angels on the other side. The warped and winsome grand pianos of “Sudden Death” honor the flaws of life: “It’s not for certain, but life ain’t perfect,” sings Chris, his voice squeaky and whimsical. Not allowing the pursuit of perfection get in the way of the celebration is a fine microcosm for Quelle Chris, who never lets kinks in his grand plan stop him. There is a fine logic to everything he does, even if it’s apparent only to him; returning to his Innocent Country franchise and outstripping the original just asserts that he always gives you something, even if it’s never what you expect.","The bohemian Detroit rapper’s latest collaboration with producer Chris Keys feels as blissful as a beer buzz on a hot summer afternoon.

Peaceful as Hell,Black Dresses,by: Leah Mandel ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f27306be2540008370e67/1:1/w_160/Peaceful%20as%20Hell_Black%20Dresses.jpg,2020-04-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-dresses-peaceful-as-hell/,blacksquares,"On April 12th, Black Dresses hosted a livestream listening party for Peaceful as Hell that doubled as a two-year anniversary celebration of their debut album, Wasteisolation. In a blue and purple-lit room, Devi McCallion and Ada Rook, the duo who make up this Canadian noise-pop project, were grinning and headbanging and throwing up the sign of the horns as their fervid fans (the kind that inspire Sauron memes) wrote messages like “go off microbiology queen,” “TRANS RIGHTS BABY,” and “this is the cutest thing that’s ever happened” in the sidebar. It’s all very fitting: Devi and Rook’s collaboration started via Twitter DM, sending loops and beats back and forth from Vancouver and Toronto; they live in the same city now, but the Black Dresses origin story, and their intimate online connection with fans, is something of a beacon in this hyper-isolated time. As Devi put it in a 2018 interview, “It’s very friend-oriented music, even though it’s about isolation.” (Their music is a reminder of the ways in which people have always been marginalized and alienated from each other—even pre-pandemic.) Peaceful as Hell is softer and more accessible than Black Dresses’ previous output, but ""accessible” is relative: The music still teems with metallic riffs, industrial noise, pop-punk that got stuffed into garbage disposal, and a good amount of digital caterwauling. It’s fun and loud as hell, as per usual; a psychotic slumber party, a Second Life rave. But the crackly, jabbing sounds are toned down here, and you can hear Devi and Rook more clearly than ever. In this new space, they stretch and shapeshift, making the most of their hybrid angel-demon powers. “CREEP U,” a coolly anthemic track which imagines a body as a haunted house, is not only the most straightforward pop song Devi and Rook have ever written, it might be one of their best (it’s also their longest to date). It’s filled with their characteristic questions about self-knowledge, and singular humor: “Empty windows shine so strange/Like there's someone behind the pain/Of glass,” Devi sings, over a simple guitar line before saying, “That's my idea of a joke, did it make you laugh?” “MAYBE THIS WORLD IS ANOTHER PLANETS HELL?” a track about making the best of a shitty situation (Earth, society), wouldn’t sound too out of place on Miss Anthropocene—that’s new for them, and the languidness is welcome. As always, even when they’re imagining themselves as angels, like on the fiery “SHARP HALO,” or as a “bloody worm goddess” on “SCARED 2 DEATH,” it’s all so human. It is decidedly music about being trans; it is music about being alive. It is music about the ways in which pain and joy swim together, the frustrations of trying to connect with others when even self-knowledge is elusive and chaotic. There is so much packed into Peaceful as Hell—complexity of inner life, dissociation, climate disaster, biblical imagery, the future—and yet it ultimately feels simple and unmistakable, as though it has fallen out of Devi and Rook. “So once again/Here we go again/It’s all we have/Okay,” Rook mutters on “BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP” before Devi joins her in shouting: “Beautiful friendship/Burning up in this/Tiny little moment of time/We will always try our best/To shine bright!” Especially with the world’s hellishness currently blaring at us, every social disparity spotlighted and exacerbated, loneliness and doubt deepened to an extreme degree, Peaceful as Hell is perfect medicine.","The Canadian noise-pop duo’s music conjures a psychotic slumber party, or a Second Life rave, but remains grounded in the bittersweet beauty of lifelong friendship.

Cinema,Skylar Gudasz,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f29fe4e26030008ba4ef0/1:1/w_160/Cinema_Skylar%20Gudasz%20.jpg,2020-04-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skylar-gudasz-cinema/,Suah Sounds,"Skylar Gudasz’s 2016 debut, Oleander, was North Carolina’s best-kept secret. Her follow-up, Cinema, is already attracting national attention. It’s not hard to see why this might be Gudasz’s moment: She’s a gifted singer-songwriter with a voice that attracts metaphors about hypnotism, and she’s wound her rhythm section like a swinging silver watch. Cinema is as dark and groovy as Oleander was bright and wafting; it’s more imperative and solidly formed. It also adds enough breadth to her discography to glimpse, beyond the individual beautiful songs, the outline of a holistic artistic persona, distinguished by Gudasz’s subtle, complex staging of femininity. Cinema’s multitude of genres are all tuned to the storm-cloud key of majestic opener “Femme Fatale.” “Rider” is country, “Animal” is folk, “Actress” is garage-psych, and “Go Away” is piano pop, but the album’s well-developed throughlines make the variation discreet. Gudasz’s band of North Carolina ringers sail at a measured pace, just like how she sings, and the scratchy snarl of her guitar keeps the organs and strings down to earth. The fountaining run of her voice recalls Joni Mitchell, while her classic yet chameleonic songwriting suggests Leonard Cohen, another student of ambiguity with the nerve to put his own name in a song, as Gudasz does on “Animal.” But her developing conceptual persona adds something new to the mix: the enigmatic self-performance of someone like Lana Del Rey. Individually, the songs impress with the poetry and grace of their sensory details, like the “waist inside the crook of my arm” from the back of a motorcycle on “Rider.” Cumulatively, they bring the razor-edged meaning of certain recurring traits into sharp focus. That “Rider” verse proceeds with such delicacy that it’s easy to miss the bloody crash at the end, and it’s indicative of the way Gudasz ironizes images of love without cheapening them. Her songs almost invariably contain an “I” and a “you,” though Gudasz might be either, neither, or both. She addresses women characters with tenderness, and men with amused contempt veiled by sweetness. (Any time you hear her call someone “babe,” watch out.) She slips, blank-faced, into masculine pronouns, a device that runs from Oleander’s “I’ll Be Your Man” to her stunning recent cover of “Wichita Lineman.” Iconic images of feminine glamour—in press photos, she reclines on the hood of a classic car or stands on a dune wearing fur—are Trojan horses for songs that undermine them from within, as Gudasz deconstructs male projections through pantomime and denunciation. “I ain’t no silent doll, and I ain’t that sweet,” she warns on “Play Nice,” lest anyone is having trouble telling the sugar from the salt. Cinema revolves around two archetypes: the star and the server, the one who is only seen and the one who never is. The former is writ large in the album’s title and film-noir tint, the latter in “Waitress” and the video for “Rider.” The two characters blur together in “Actress,” the purest expression of Gudasz’s resistance to resolving multiple exposures into one pat image. The overlapping, shifting edges between personal and projected desire are the contested zone she’s exploring. Instead of evading projections such as bad girl, sweet girl, tough girl—any kind of girl, really—Gudasz tries them on for size, humanizing them, only to fling back the empty costumes with a potent question for the culture that created them: So, this is what you want? Are you sure?","The North Carolina singer-songwriter has a voice that attracts metaphors about hypnotism. Her second album reveals a subtle, complex staging of femininity that resists easy resolutions.

Oneiric Formulary,Sir Richard Bishop,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e99e1c005b8ec0008212208/1:1/w_160/sirrichard.jpg,2020-04-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sir-richard-bishop-oneiric-formulary/,Drag City,"Sir Richard Bishop is one of the most riveting and dynamic acoustic guitarists on the planet, but he’s seldom seemed interested in the tropes of the solo guitar tradition. Since his 1998 debut on Revenant, John Fahey’s own label and a bastion of stylistic misfits, the Sun City Girls cofounder has indulged a deep restless streak, making records that nod toward his six-string contemporaries before racing off in a dozen directions. In the span of a few tracks, he might conjure the endless ecstasy of Munir Bashir, the cinematic elegance of Chet Atkins, and the spare beauty of Libba Cotten. The title of Polytheistic Fragments, his staggering 2007 Drag City album, still feels like a mission statement: Rather than subscribe to one belief system, Bishop has marshalled a more useful personal theology by borrowing a bit from everything he loves. Given Bishop’s insatiable curiosity, an album like his new Oneiric Formulary was inevitable. On his first solo outing since 2015’s Tangier Sessions, a painstaking exploration of every sound he could wring from a mysteriously salvaged guitar, Bishop doesn’t actually pick up a guitar for nearly half these tracks. Instead, he chops samples into spooky sequences as though he were RZA’s wayward understudy for “Call to Order” and surrenders himself to a nearly nine-minute morass of maligned circuits like a half-asleep Yellow Swans for “Graveyard Wanderers.” Yes, Bishop takes the guitar on a few mesmerizing turns, alternately embracing frenetic strums and pleasant licks familiar from his past. But on an album inspired by the sounds and scenes of his dreams, Bishop finally seems tired of being confined to one instrument. Of course, realizing Bishop isn’t here just to play guitar (or even piano, where his dizzying notes recall the puffy, cloudlike shapes of La Monte Young’s music) brings an initial twinge of disappointment. Imagine the letdown of going to see Michael Jordan man the outfield or paying handsomely to hear a member of Led Zeppelin plunge into microtonal improvisation. But even without the guitar, Bishop communicates his endearing sentimentality and his boundless instrumental ambitions. The dizzying pace and radiant tones of “Dust Devils”—a game approximation of frame drum and the strident Arabic mizmar, played with a MIDI keyboard—are as gripping as his most bristling Freak of Araby pieces. And his electronic lute lines for “Renaissance Nod” recall the contemplative pace of Bishop’s piano works: Same moods, different deliveries. Still, when Bishop grabs the guitar, you remember what you were missing. During the “The Coming of the Rats,” he thumbs out a staccato acoustic strut while fluorescent electric drones pirouette in slow-motion. It’s eerie and gorgeous, like Robert Fripp scoring some dimly lit alley scene in a gangster movie. And on “Celerity,” Bishop’s heavy strums are so fast, angular, and agile it sounds like Aphex Twin sampled him and built the track one meter at a time. Bishop somehow fits notes inside of rests that don’t seem to exist—the effect is exhilarating, like a motivational speech crammed into four breathless minutes. Bishop seems to understand it’s still reassuring to hear his particular sort of guitar mastery, where the emotions run as deep and free as the peerless technique. To wit, he ends the mid-album triptych of songs without guitar with “Enville,” a piece so brisk and resplendent it would be the standout on almost any record by the latest generation of solo acoustic guitarists. Aside from the introduction, it’s the shortest track here, so you might overlook it between the clangor of “Dust Devils” and the speed of “Black Sara.” But listen again to how cleanly Bishop plays and how many images he’s able to evoke in about two minutes. In one moment, I picture a tree-lined pasture, birdsong dancing at the edge of the field; in another, the quiet bliss of crossing a tedious item off a too-old to-do list. Hearing “Enville,” you get why Bishop might want to write beyond the guitar now—how can one instrument get more exquisite or evocative than this?","The acclaimed solo guitarist sets aside his beloved instrument for nearly half the tracks on his new album, seeking new routes to convey familiar moods.

Fear of Music,Talking Heads,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f18e14e26030008ba4eee/1:1/w_160/Fear%20of%20Music_Talking%20Heads.jpg,2020-04-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-fear-of-music/,Sire,"Fear of Music, the third album by Talking Heads, begins at maximum velocity and minimum warmth. Congas, funk guitar, chirping synths: Everything is in motion, and yet curiously, nothing seems to be moving. A guitar figure like a crying baby keeps tripping the song’s downbeat, and in the closing seconds, a phased guitar line comes in played by Robert Fripp, layering 5/4 over 4/4 and effectively erasing whatever forward momentum this blank, pistoning thing was creating to begin with. The groove feels uncanny, a little inhuman, like a flag rippling in no wind. The words, meanwhile, consist of barked nonsense syllables from Hugo Ball, a German poet of the Dada School. Dadaism mocked the very idea that words could convey meaning, that speakers could carry authority; for a band so devoted to verbal communication they named themselves after it, it was a forbidding gesture. And for fans of the New York band in the late ’70s, hearing “I Zimbra” might have felt like watching their hero obliterated in the first frame of the movie. It was exactly this sort of hero’s-journey narrative into which Fear of Music seemed to cast a wrench. The band’s popularity and acclaim had been gathering heat; “Take Me to the River,” their stiff-legged cover version of the Al Green standard, peaked at No. 26 on the Hot 100. They’d appeared on Saturday Night Live and American Bandstand, and they’d been touring to steadily bigger crowds. Already the quintessential New York band to New Yorkers, now they risked becoming the quintessential New York band to everyone else—maybe even to the sorts of folks who lived in the “Big Country,” the places about which Byrne had already admitted, “I wouldn’t live there if you paid me.” Fear of Music can be read, in part, as an attempt to throw buckets of conceptual cold water on everything that had made the Talking Heads beloved, or to at least submit it to rigorous forensic testing. They experimented with their songwriting process; instead of working from Byrne’s compositions, they entered the studio cold, jamming together until the shape of something promising emerged. As they did on More Songs About Buildings and Food, they enlisted Brian Eno as producer, but this time Eno played a much bigger role: It was Eno who suggested a Table of Contents approach to the tracklist, which turned the song titles into a litany of proper nouns, and it was he who furnished the Hugo Ball poem for inspiration when Byrne was struggling with writer’s block. As a band of former design students, the Talking Heads thought harder than most about presentation, about the telling power of surfaces. On Fear of Music, they repeatedly drew attention away from the picture to gesture at the frame: The radio announcement for the album was a simple, stilted intonation—“Talking Heads have a new album/It’s called Fear of Music”—repeated over and over. The album cover was a black obelisk, alternately bumpy and smooth but admitting no light and emitting no clues. There was a song called “Electric Guitar,” and the refrain, as the electric guitars gnashed their teeth in every available space, was “Never listen to electric guitar.” The bittersweet futility of this command neatly encapsulated a band that was a tangle of conflicting impulses in 1979. They shunned every method that had worked for them before, attempting perhaps to become a different version of themselves, and yet they only purified their essence. In jettisoning old methods and throwing themselves into new ones, they embraced the only true underlying force of their music: relentless interrogation. The album plays out like a series of mini-stand up routines about the absurdity, or the pointlessness, of human observation. Each song contains at least one declaration of seeming authority (“Hold on, because it’s been taken care of”; “Find myself a city to live in”), which Byrne goes on to repeat with increasing mania and decreasing confidence. As the music subdivides itself into a million tiny repeating phrases, you feel a grasping mind trying and failing to find purchase. “Everything seems to be up in the air at this time,"" Byrne observed mildly on “Mind,” with deadpan irony. On Fear of Music, he became our metaphysical straight man, able to defamiliarize the world, object by object, with his through-a-telescope gaze and his curious tone. He describes his “Mind” like some peculiar object that has crash-landed in his living room. “Drugs won’t change you/Religion won’t change you/What’s the matter with you?/I haven’t got the faintest idea,” Byrne mutters. Imagine a multi-tentacled alien attempting to put on a pair of pants; this was Byrne trying to make sense of reality. The album is almost heroically funny, each song a fit of pique aimed at the broadest and most pervasive targets imaginable: paper (things never fit on it), electric guitars (you should never listen to it), and air—for god’s sake, air. “Air can hurt you, too,” Byrne reminds us—a hell of a retort to the patronizing suggestion to “get some air.” He agonizes over the existence of “Animals”; “They’re never there when you need them/They’re never there when you call them.” He sounds incensed, deranged, his voice going guttural and squeaky—the performance is a hair’s breadth away from shtick. His voice rises to an indignant peak at the biggest insult: Animals “don’t even know what a joke is.” The music seems to know exactly what a joke is, and there are points where it seems to be laughing directly at you. There’s the “nyah-nyah” keyboard refrain on “I Zimbra,” the chittering keyboard on “Mind” like a bird that won’t shut up outside your window, undermined by Tina Weymouth’s banana-peel bassline. Like any good joke, the music seems to be constantly retelling itself, circling back on the first thought before the second thought even begins. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, stop me if you’ve heard this, stop me, stop me. It’s the sound of propulsive uncertainty. “Still might be a chance that it might work out,” Byrne squeaks on “Paper,” which is what you say just before everything falls apart. The scratching sound on “Cities” mimic pencils blackening every inch of a paper’s free space, and the keyboards, the vocals, strike with the force of a typewriter hammer smacking paper. This was writing and thinking as a percussive act, each note a small panicked violence on reality, the force and insistence belying the foreknowledge that all this would disappear eventually. Cities would fall to war, the good times would end, were always ending—if Byrne wasn’t going to break his bug-eyed poker face to spell all this out to you, Jerry Harrison’s guitars and keyboards were going to scream it. The guitar that intrudes at the end of “Mind” is like a pained groan, begging Byrne to shut up. The ratcheting sound ringing throughout “Cities” sounds like a scythe trying to sever the talking head from its body, once and for all. At the center of Fear of Music is “Life During Wartime,” inarguably one of their five most iconic songs. The lyrics ratchet paranoia all the way to the top: We open with a van loaded with weapons, rumored but not seen, and a gravesite “where nobody knows.” A triumph consists of finding some peanut butter to last you “a couple of days.” Everything else—records to play, letters to write, identity crises to have (“I’ve changed my hairstyle so many times now…”) is just quaint, a reminder of better times when we were allowed to be miserable for our own little reasons. Significantly, it’s the calmest that Byrne had ever sounded on record to that point—all the quavers in that reedy voice were suddenly smoothed out. The panic is always in the anticipation; when the disaster hits, we’re oddly calm. “The sound of gunfire, off in the distance/I’m getting used to it now.” I’m getting used to it now—is there any proclamation of success bleaker? The song, and Byrne’s vocal performance, offered a premonition of the shellacked hair and hard angles of his big-suit, early-’80s Stop Making Sense era, which would begin in earnest with 1980’s masterpiece Remain in Light. There was an incipient pitilessness to the American air; the country had just elected Reagan. New York City was a pyre of burning tenements and a city teetering on the brink of financial ruin. When chaos descends, talk is the first thing deemed cheap. So Byrne burned his notebooks, as the lyrics went, and all that was left was the burning in his chest that kept him alive. Civilization is a privilege; anxiety is a privilege; worrying about paper and minds and dogs and drugs are privileges, and they might constitute the best and sweetest moments of your life. That’s the joke, that’s both the setup and the punchline: You think you’re miserable now? This misery is the good part. And that would be the epigraph of Fear of Music if it weren’t for “Heaven.” It’s a song that Byrne almost didn’t write, based on a melody he nearly threw away. Eno heard Byrne humming it to himself and drew the song out of him, like a forced confession. The band in heaven plays your favorite song, plays it all night long. It’s a place where nothing ever happens; everyone leaves the party at the same time, and every kiss begins again exactly the same. The song is a prayer for order, a cessation of observation. When the act of observation, which grants us our humanity and fuels our neurosis, falls away—what’s left? Pure experience, untouched by anything else. “There’s a party in my mind, and I hope it never stops,” Byrne says on “Memories Can’t Wait.” Maybe the best moment happens when everyone leaves.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Talking Heads with new reviews of five albums that chart their journey from New York art punks to a voracious and spectacular pop group.

Talking Heads 77,Talking Heads,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9e146b43b931000881dda0/1:1/w_160/Talking%20Heads%2077_Talking%20Heads.jpg,2020-04-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-talking-heads-77/,Sire,"Contrary to the way they sounded, Talking Heads were not in a hurry. David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, and Chris Frantz had no particular plan to play music together when they moved to New York City after the dissolution of Frantz and Byrne’s band back in Providence, where all three had attended the Rhode Island School of Design. That lasted until Frantz and Weymouth saw the Ramones at CBGB shortly after they arrived—the kind of downtown show a couple of broke art-school graduates might wander into in late 1974. Still buzzing, Frantz, the drummer, convinced Byrne, the singer-guitarist, to give it another go. But they didn’t have a bassist in New York, and they couldn’t find one they liked. Rather than settle and start playing shows quickly, they decided that Weymouth could do it—never mind that she’d never touched a bass before. She bought one on layaway and set about learning, listening to records by pioneering hard rocker Suzi Quatro and receiving occasional words of encouragement from free jazz legend Don Cherry, who happened to live in the same building, down the street from CBGB, where the newly minted trio rented a loft for $250 a month. Talking Heads practiced for six months before they were ready for their first gig: at CB’s, in June 1975, opening for the Ramones. Another two years passed before they recorded and released their debut album. They had a big future ahead of them. Why rush? During those two years, they developed their music and career carefully. They added a fourth member in keyboardist-guitarist Jerry Harrison, formerly of the Modern Lovers, to fill out their spindly early sound. They turned down one record deal, always waiting for the right fit. They immersed themselves in the profuse richness of music and art that New York made available at the time: dancing to disco and salsa, rubbing elbows with avant-garde improvisers like Cherry and composers like Philip Glass, jamming with Arthur Russell, who almost got Harrison’s seat in the final lineup. And they brought it all with them as they clawed their way to the center of the new thing called punk rock that was happening at CBGB. Talking Heads 77 feels both like the culmination of the band’s days as downtown New York darlings and the primordial origin of their late-’70s-early-’80s masterpieces. They were already accomplished enough that Rolling Stone opened its review by noting how long they’d taken to record an album, and Talking Heads 77 shows it, expressing an arch, agitated, and abundantly tuneful sensibility belonging entirely to them. If they had gone the way of their less durable CB’s scene peers—say, the Dictators, or the Shirts—and broken up soon after, it might have been viewed as a one-and-done record collector classic today. But they didn’t. Alongside its ingenuity, Talking Heads 77 also exists as a mere glimmer of potential, a fascinating prelude to a few of the most visionary albums ever recorded. The band’s curiously multivalent relationship with pop music was already being negotiated. Across 11 songs, Talking Heads aspire to pop’s communal uplift while also creating distance from the genuine article. A few seconds into “Uh Oh, Love Comes to Town”— cymbal crashes, four chords ascending toward frenzy, the rhythm locking in—and we’ve arrived indisputably at the Talking Heads sound. Frantz plays like an R&B session drummer with a gun held to his head, just a little too edgy and insistent. Weymouth is bouncy and melodic, with no trace of a beginner’s tentativeness. A gleeful steel pan solo appears from nowhere, an early sign of the band’s disinterest in rock orthodoxy. Byrne yelps, proclaims, and carries on conversations with himself. As he would again and again, he addresses human connection in the stilted language of an atomized and impersonal society. He frets that falling in love might cause him to “neglect my duties,” as a stockbroker might make a bad investment—so concerned with performing his role that love becomes an incursion, an obstacle toward getting work done. Crucially, however, “Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town” is not black-witted satire. It may be a postmodern send-up of a love song, but it’s also a love song. The rhythm section does a stiff imitation of the Funk Brothers, but they still lay down a pretty good groove for dancing. Parsing the blend of sincerity and irony in any Talking Heads song is difficult, but you never doubt their belief in the music. For New York, 1977 was a difficult year—economic freefall, neighborhoods ravaged by arson fires, a blackout that threw the city briefly into anarchy, the shadow of a serial killer who stalked the outer boroughs the summer before—and Talking Heads 77 occasionally embodies that darkness. “Psycho Killer,” the catchiest song ever written about a sociopathic murderer, is more disquieting in footage of an early CBGB performance than it is on record, where it evolved into a campy performance of violence, turning the killer’s chilling laughter into a goofy refrain. “No Compassion” is more mundane, and more menacing because of it, with a narrator who calmly rationalizes his own refusal to empathize with anyone. Opening with an uncharacteristically hard-rocking riff and lurching between two drastically different tempos, it feels like a last vestige of affinity with the punk scene’s heavier and more nihilistic tendencies. Still, its message probably shouldn’t be taken at face value. “So many people have their problems/I’m not interested in their problems,” Byrne moans at one point, a rich sentiment coming from a guy beset by problems on all sides and eager to tell you about it, whose response to the joys of new love is a resounding “uh oh.” These moments of intensity arise as occasional spasms across an otherwise upbeat and approachable album. At times, Talking Heads ‘77 seems to leapfrog the stormy minimalism the band would pursue across the trio of Brian Eno collaborations that followed this album, and instead offer a budget approximation of the pancultural dance party they threw on 1983’s Speaking in Tongues. Talking Heads ‘77 abounds with ecstatic rhythms and bright sonic details: a honky-tonk piano disguised as a disco bassline on “The Book I Read”; mallets and Latin percussion building toward a sultry sax refrain on “First Week / Last Week … Carefree”; a toylike synthesizer on “Don’t Worry About the Government,” a song whose cheeriness in the face of alienation is both heartening and unsettling. The Talking Heads of ‘77 come off like enthusiastic collagists rather than master sculptors: these sounds are thrilling on their own, but they don’t always cohere with the holism of later albums. On “Tentative Decisions,” Byrne engages in a one-man call-and-response, switching between his usual whine and a cartoonishly stentorian low register, simulating the interplay of lead and backing vocalists on any number of old pop and soul records. This was a new kind of self-awareness for rock bands, who by the mid-’70s were steeped in decades of pop history, and anxiously searching for their own place within it. Talking Heads articulated that self-awareness without ever sounding smug or lapsing into parody, twisting pop’s stock gestures into new shapes while maintaining their core musical appeal. It was a feat no one had accomplished in quite the same way before them, and no one would repeat in quite the same way. No one except the Talking Heads, that is: Byrne would closely replicate the “Tentative Decisions” vocal arrangement on the chorus of “Slippery People,” from Speaking in Tongues. But by 1983, he had an actual chorus of slick-sounding backing singers—the distance between Talking Heads and the rest of the world growing smaller, but never collapsing entirely. After its tense final chorus, “Tentative Decisions” explodes into the most jubilant stretch of music on Talking Heads ‘77, an instrumental coda with a four-on-the-floor drumbeat, congas tapping at the edges, and high-stepping piano from Harrison—all of it repeating with minimal variation as the song fades out. More than anything, it sounds like house music, a genre that wouldn’t come along for a few years, but would eventually leave a seismic imprint on pop. Talking Heads stumble into the resemblance on “Tentative Decisions,” and stumble quickly out of it. Still, in 1977, they didn’t need to rush toward the future. They were already there.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Talking Heads with new reviews of five albums that chart their journey from New York art-punks to a voracious and spectacular pop group.

More Songs About Buildings and Food,Talking Heads,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9e17bf05b8ec0008212215/1:1/w_160/More%20Songs%20About%20Buildings%20and%20Food_Talking%20Heads.jpg,2020-04-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-more-songs-about-buildings-and-food/,Sire,"When the Ramones and Talking Heads toured Europe in the spring of 1977, Johnny Ramone was annoyed by seemingly everything. The varieties of lettuce served abroad. Stonehenge (“a buncha rocks,” he called it, according to the excellent book Love Goes to Buildings on Fire). And of course, the James Brown tapes that Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth played on the bus. Though the two bands frequently gigged together within the early New York punk scene, the Ramones were all about girl groups and surf rock, while their preppy-looking tourmates—particularly Weymouth and her soon-to-be husband, drummer Chris Frantz—were wild about funky R&B. Toward the end of the tour, Talking Heads played a small solo show in London. Brian Eno, fresh off making Low with David Bowie, caught the gig and invited the band to lunch the next day, which turned into listening to records at his flat. The producer put on Fela Kuti’s Afrodisiac and blew their minds. Afrobeat music (particularly West African polyrhythms) would become the next big influence on the members of Talking Heads, culminating in their magnum opus, 1980’s Remain in Light. But while that was still percolating, the group made an immediate connection with Eno. By the following spring, Talking Heads had kicked their original production team of disco pros to the curb and took up recording More Songs About Buildings and Food alongside Eno in the Bahamas. Though many tracks on their second album were live staples dating back to 1975, the songs took on a more groove-oriented sound as Talking Heads progressed and played to their strengths. Incorporating disco rhythms separated them further from Television, their closest corollary in the CBGB scene. The tempos were slowed down and simmering, while the layers of instrumentation and effects were built up. You can hear Eno’s “studio as instrument” approach in all sorts of sonic details, like the loudspeaker-style vocals and reverb bouncing off the drums in “Warning Sign,” the curious clicks and dubby echoes punctuating “Stay Hungry,” or the faint twinkling between lines in the chorus of their heady cover of Al Green’s “Take Me to the River.” But these increasingly intricate aesthetics never threaten to overthrow the music’s pleasure center: an involuntary compulsion to move your body. On More Songs About Buildings and Food, Talking Heads were sorting out how to engage simultaneously with the mind and the soul (or at least the hips)—how to be both art-rock and dance music. “Take Me to the River,” their first Top 40 hit, is ground zero for this duality. At the time, various white fools were reinterpreting Reverend Green’s 1974 album-cut-turned-Syl-Johnson-hit, ranging from the horrid (Foghat) to the decent (Levon Helm); none of them come near Talking Heads’ singular take. A soul song that walks the line between the sacred and the profane is not something you’d expect a singer who typically yelped quotidian paranoia to excel at, yet David Byrne’s idiosyncratic vocal phrasings—his pauses, his stretched-out crooning and strained falsetto, his “yayayayayaya” that sounds like it’s coming toward you—forever changed the way people hear “Take Me to the River.” And Byrne isn’t even the cover’s main power source, Weymouth is. Their version is one big, throbbing bass loop—the fastest, possibly only route to a sexy Talking Heads song. Byrne spends much of his band’s most immediately danceable record not getting laid, though. He claims he’s just too busy for romance these days. When he demands, atop a frantic guitar jangle in “The Good Thing,” that you stop and watch him work, it could almost be the album’s thesis statement. But Byrne is not just a workaholic, he’s also humorously jaded: The girls, after all, are “getting into abstract analysis” instead of paying attention to him. The one clear relationship portrait he paints is completely absurd, centering around a couple that funnels their stupid fights into a hit TV show; cheekily, it’s called “Found a Job.” By and large, these songs are about being a young, ambitious artist in the city, an album where the age is forever 26 and the mood is raring to go. Two songs that epitomize this outlook, “Artists Only” and “The Big Country,” are among the album’s most beautiful—the former for its interlocking parts, the latter for its swooning simplicity. An ode to the creative process, “Artists Only” is built from the kind of instrumental interplay that makes you want to dismantle it just so you can understand the source of its magic and mystery; is it the swirling organ melody, the chiming guitar riff, or the chugging bassline that produces this effect? (Like most things Talking Heads, the magic’s in the combinations.) Meanwhile, “The Big Country” is as lucid (and twangy) as Byrne gets: “I wouldn’t live there if you paid me,” he pronounces outright in the surprisingly laidback chorus. He borrowed the phrase “the big country” from Roxy Music’s Country Life closer “Prairie Rose,” where it refers to Texas, but as far as Byrne’s concerned, it’s any place you’d fly over without feeling much curiosity. It’s a barbed judgement he sings with relative peace, like someone relieved they live amid the move and hustle of New York City instead of, y’know, America.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Talking Heads with new reviews of five albums that chart their journey from New York art punks to a voracious and spectacular pop group.

Speaking in Tongues,Talking Heads,by: Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f1ced2071a50008c2bd3f/1:1/w_160/Speaking%20In%20Tongues_Talking%20Heads.jpg,2020-04-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-speaking-in-tongues/,Sire,"In nearly 35 years of David Byrne’s stage performances, some elements have endured: He still dances passionately with floor lamps. He lies supine on the stage, singing into his headset. Brass and woodwind players march around him in geometric shapes. Above all, his hyphenate backing singers/dancers always seem positively euphoric, beaming in a way that transcends professionally rehearsed cheer, as they execute song after song of quirky, nimble bends and leaps, the sort of exaggerated movements that evoke children’s specials and turtleneck-heavy performance art. From Talking Heads’ epochal 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense to Byrne’s celebrated 2019 Broadway show American Utopia, these dancers’ amusement has always been scrawled on their faces: How different this is, they seem to muse while in their Gumby contortions, perfectly identical yet each awed in their expressions. What an absurd, wonderful thing we’re doing now. Their balance of joyful freedom inside methodical choreography, spontaneity inside structure, perfectly mirrors Talking Heads, who first mastered that equilibrium in the studio. On their fifth album, Speaking in Tongues, Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison indulge their unusual, gamboling whims within solid walls. The record brought along the spry, Afrobeat-inspired polyrhythms and funk saunter of 1980’s Remain in Light while adding in new wave’s synths and the sharp, physical precision of Byrne’s 1981 score for Twyla Tharp’s dance piece The Catherine Wheel; there are also glimmers of the neon pop cheer of Weymouth and Frantz’s side project Tom Tom Club. Together, this inky passport of sounds yields an album that, besides smoothly mixing art-rock with funk with pop, feels meticulously mapped for the collective yet informed by the movements of the individuals. Even for an album titled after communication—nodding to both glossolalia and Byrne’s famously garbled scatting in recording sessions—Speaking in Tongues is singularly immediate and direct. In each song, one concept—one saucy bass-and-piano walking line, one ricocheting keyboard line, one heavily shouted pyromaniac refrain—repeats into an insistent foundation, so emphatic it begins to burrow into a trancelike state befitting the album name. Choruses are evolutions of verses, of ideas that have repeated enough to feel lived-in. Weymouth’s funk bass, the unsung star of the album, is never far from the foreground. This rigid framework throughout allows the rest of the instrumentation to cavort above it: A jubilant momentum rises throughout “Girlfriend Is Better,” but its base—a sauntering line from Weymouth, sci-fi synth radiation from guest Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic—is set quickly. This bedrock allows for Byrne’s hoarse, scattered shouting to reach velocity above while still feeling controlled. “Pull Up the Roots” flirts with disco as it rides a tight rhythm section that feels a shade too hectic for dancing; the bass bounce starts at a gallop and the guitar backflips around it. “Burning Down the House,” Speaking in Tongue’s biggest hit—and the only Top 10 single in Talking Heads’ entire catalog—starts with a literal scream from Byrne, and has no clear markers between verse and chorus: It is a full stampede to the howled refrain, an explosion buoyed by such a perky trajectory, it sneakily exculpates some the most insurgently unglued lyrics to ever crack the Billboard charts. (“People on their way to work and baby what did you expect?/Gonna burst into flame!” is some dark, dark weather.) Byrne’s lyrics have been deemed inscrutable art-school fare by many, minimized as Mad Libs sold as gospel; in fact, as Speaking in Tongues proves definitively, they are is the opposite. Byrne sings like a kindergarten teacher, or a Rosetta Stone language bot: in plainspoken, short observations that make sense individually, yet sequence into a mystifying dialogue. On “Moon Rocks,” when Byrne seems to scoff at alien intelligence—“Flying saucers, levitation/Yo I could do that!”—and follows it up a hair’s-breadth later with a liberal arts pep talk—""So take your hands out of your pockets/And get your face adjusted”—these are perfectly intelligible thoughts, individually. On “Slippery People,” Byrne and sensational guest vocalist Nona Hendryx offer a strange sort of gospel proselytizing—""Turn like a wheel, he’s alright/See for yourself, the Lord won’t mind,” a millisecond before sharing stark memories of cold bathtub water­—over a merry funk pulse and scratchy, uber-’80s synths. For all its charms, and the big single it housed, Speaking in Tongues lies in the shadow of Remain in Light; it’s not as effortlessly cohesive, its diffused interests not as zealous and enchanting as its more focused predecessor. But Speaking in Tongues does have the distinction of ending on the Talking Heads song most likely to be on a skeptic’s wedding playlist: “This Must Be the Place,” a neurotic’s concession to love even as he frets over the transience of life, and a bittersweet pact to let someone into his fearful mind. Byrne is unusually tender; his wild thoughts flow in one direction. As he sings gently to his partner, wondering, “Did I find you, or you find me?” the beautiful messiness of existence seems to soften. Here aren’t 30 thoughts bandying for space in Byrne’s fulminating brain, only vulnerability. There aren’t three synth lines racing off a cliff, just some percussive clang and one light synth wobble. His expression of love feels even more romantic because he clearly still knows love is a distraction. It's the strangest move of all from him, and it almost makes sense.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Talking Heads with new reviews of five albums that chart their journey from New York art punks to a voracious and spectacular pop group.

Little Creatures,Talking Heads,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9f1f0294034a00082e7a29/1:1/w_160/Little%20Creatures_Talking%20Heads.jpg,2020-04-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-little-creatures/,Sire,"Early in their career, Talking Heads seemed to be a manifestation of frontman David Byrne’s physiology: lean, angular, and severe. Journalists loved to point out his resemblance to Psycho’s clean-cut villain Norman Bates, especially when writing about their enduring first hit “Psycho Killer.” It was far too easy an observation, and one Byrne resented. Having sprouted at Rhode Island School of Design and relocated to New York in the mid-’70s, Talking Heads were wedged between two worlds: They were artsy outliers of the punk community too clean-cut and high-minded to really blend in at CBGB, yet too odd for listeners accustomed to a steady diet of Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. A few early singles like “Psycho Killer” and “Life During Wartime” snuck onto the charts by the end of the ’70s, buried under glossy hits by ABBA, Bee Gees, and Michael Jackson. Listening to their early catalog now, it’s clear their sense of melody didn’t get enough credit. Byrne didn’t have the easy star appeal of Barry Gibb, but by 1985, when Talking Heads released their sixth studio album Little Creatures, they’d become more melodic, more relatable: They’d made a pop album. “It’s so much fun to be able to relax and just play without feeling you have to be avant-garde all the time,” bassist Tina Weymouth told The New York Times’ Ken Emerson in May 1985, one month before the album’s release. “We spent so many years trying to be original that we don’t know what original is anymore.” Readers wouldn’t completely understand what she meant until July, when Little Creatures reached No. 20 on the Billboard 200. After a decade in which they’d produced five pivotal LPs, each more unexpected than the last, Talking Heads had laid down their most approachable album ever. Little Creatures is a triumphant pop document that celebrates life’s simple joys, the exact thing Talking Heads once weaponized. By this point, the band had already run the gamut of creative endeavors. In addition to their hugely influential discography, they’d worked extensively with Brian Eno, recorded an expansive live album (1982’s The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads), and collaborated with director Jonathan Demme on the groundbreaking and now-classic concert film Stop Making Sense. Critics keenly traced the arc of their success from RISD art obsessives to downtown punk affiliates to a 10-piece band of Afrobeat enthusiasts. Talking Heads’ love of funk and Afrobeat is alive and well on this album, evident in Weymouth’s walloping basslines and a smattering of hand drums; they also experiment with country western pedal steel (on “Creatures of Love”), bubbling synths (“Walk It Down”), and drumline snare (“Road to Nowhere”). But Little Creatures was about a lot more than a new batch of instruments in the studio. In a 1985 review, Rolling Stone insisted that Little Creatures was “the sound of David Byrne falling in love with normalcy.” Normalcy existed throughout Talking Heads’ catalog (what could be more normal than “buildings” and “food”?), but Little Creatures is their first album to examine one of normalcy’s most complicated and significant corners: Procreative sex and parental love. Such milestones in Byrne’s own life—marriage with his then-girlfriend, artist Adelle Lutz, and the birth of their daughter, Malu—were still a few years away. Meanwhile, Talking Heads’ wedded rhythm section, Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, had a little creature of their own: Their son Robin arrived in 1982. Byrne didn’t immediately rush to write a song about him. “David’s so funny,” Frantz told Rolling Stone’s Christopher Connelly in 1983. “He sort of wants to hold the baby, but he’ll never say, ‘Can I hold the baby?’ We just say, ‘David, would you like to hold the baby?’ And David gets all stiff, like, ‘Am I doing it right?’” By 1985, Byrne had caught the baby bug. Little Creatures is a celebration of love, procreation, and all the normal things Byrne used to treat with a sense of fear and alienation (this is a man who once sang: “They say compassion is a virtue, but I don’t have the time”). In a brief documentary from 1979, Byrne sits, half in shadow, criticizing other rock’n’rollers for singing about everyday life in “rather mythic terms.” “People get very emotional about these, sort of, very mundane things,” Byrne says. “Grand events very rarely happen.” By the time Talking Heads wrote Little Creatures, grand events were happening every day—every second, even. On the calm and clean “Creatures of Love,” Bryne does nothing but marvel at the mundane. “Well, I’ve seen sex and I think it’s alright/It makes those little creatures come to life,” he sings. “Little creatures of love/With two arms and two legs/From a moment of passion/Now they cover the bed.” Looking outside of himself, Byrne found beauty in Frantz and Weymouth’s little family. Mid-album romp “Stay Up Late” is a far more jarring display of Byrne’s sudden fascination with toddlers. Driven by Jerry Harrison’s punching keyboard and big stadium drums, it’s the goofiest entry in Talking Heads’ catalog to date. Byrne demolishes any remaining scrap of stoicism: “Cute. Cute. Little baby/Little pee pee. Little toes,” he babbles. The song was a hit, parking on the charts for a full 10 weeks thanks to its fun, bouncing form: simple, rubbery bass, a lyrical nod to the Temptations, and a sing-along chorus. Perhaps Byrne’s paternal affections made him a more approachable frontman than the paranoid beanpole of yore. Still, no amount of artistic brilliance can justify the lyrics “little pee pee.” “Stay Up Late” is the album’s most literal song. Little Creatures functions best when Byrne speaks in relatable abstractions, allowing the band to translate them into expansive and buoyant pop songs. Opener “And She Was” and “The Lady Don’t Mind” are prime examples. They seem driven by Byrne’s unique approach to love, affectionate but not possessive. Amid the prickly guitar riffs, brass accents, and woodblock of “And She Was,” he observes a woman at her “pleasant elevation,” in awe of her ability to just be. On “The Lady Don’t Mind,” he calmly watches her travel from place to place, admiring her autonomy from afar. The verses are slithering and mysterious, flecked with hand percussion and winding guitar licks, perhaps a nod to this woman’s independent nature. But when the chorus bursts open, Byrne is ecstatic: “I like this curious feeling!” he sings. This is the sound of Talking Heads when their leader is hopelessly in love. In 1985, Little Creatures sounded like nothing Talking Heads had ever done before, and its staggering closer, “Road to Nowhere,” could be called their first proper anthem. It is simply enormous, with a gospel choir lead-in, Frantz’s one-man marching band, and an accordion slinking all over the place. It’s a vast, victorious ballad that builds and builds. Its titular road feels particularly significant: It is a device Byrne had once derided as just another way rock music made banality sound melodramatic. “Every trip down the highway was a huge experience,” he quipped in 1979, explaining his desire to treat such stimuli with realistic proportions. Just a few years later, he took his own trip, a metaphor for our journey through the great unknown. Little Creatures went on to sell over 2 million copies in the United States, becoming Talking Heads’ most successful studio album. Many critics attributed their aptitude for arena-sized pop songs to Frantz and Weymouth’s disco-tinged side project Tom Tom Club, but in retrospect, the band’s fate was sealed from the beginning. Tangled in the barbs of early albums like Talking Heads 77 and Fear of Music were jagged pop songs made all the more interesting by their lack of sheen and manipulation of convention. On Little Creatures, Talking Heads polished every surface of their sound. It wasn’t so much a step in the right direction as an inevitable conclusion for a band who, like everyone, must embrace adulthood at some point. Little Creatures is not Talking Heads’ best album, but it is their case for aging gracefully, and with great fondness for life.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Talking Heads with new reviews of five albums that chart their journey from New York art punks to a voracious and spectacular pop group.

"Forever, Ya Girl",KeiyaA,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94b3f1b2ee63000804337c/1:1/w_160/Forever,%20Ya%20Girl_KeiyaA.jpg",2020-04-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/keiyaa-forever-ya-girl/,Forever Recordings,"Ever since an artist once known as Lonny Breaux decided to defy his label Def Jam and deliver his debut, Nostalgia, Ultra, straight to the internet, the textures of popular R&B have become increasingly homegrown. Whether it’s the lithe heartbreak workout of LE1F affiliate Rahel’s 2015 album Alkali or the collaborations of singer Alexandria and producer Ethereal, there’s been a bounty of music for those who crave soulful vocals over beats from somewhere underground. On her debut album Forever, Ya Girl, the Chicago-bred, New York-based singer/producer/multi-instrumentalist KeiyaA merges Earl Sweatshirt-ish grime and the grit of deconstructed club with hints of psych and funk. It’s easier to find a singular sound when you’re working on your own, which KeiyaA did almost entirely—she poses for Instagram portraits cradling a microKORG synthesizer—with occasional production assists from rapper MIKE under his DJ Blackpower moniker. It’s even more natural to work mostly alone when your lyrics are laments on loneliness. “Who is supposed to ride or die for me if not I?” she asks on “Negus Poem 1 & 2,” but not with a de rigeur sense of self-empowerment. It’s one of the many inquiries into the disquiet of being alone that KeiyaA proliferates through discordant synth lines and disembodied voices. She uses that POV to turn the music of others on its head, too. “Forreal???” opens with, “Before I put this pussy on your sideburns/I need to check in with my heart and mind,” a reference to Nicki Minaj’s verse from the Young Money bubblegum bedroom cut “Bed Rock” that turns shock-baiting coquettery—Nicki follows her sideburn remark with, “He say I’m bad, he probably right”—into a self-affirming mantra of protection. When KeiyaA covers Prince’s funky kiss-off “Do Yourself a Favor,” she quiets it to the volume of an internal monologue by someone still enmeshed in a painful end. On one of the album’s highlights, “Hvnli,” KeyiaA sings, “Gone for so long, I prefer to spend time alone with my pain/Gone for so long, I can barely recall, the last my phone rang.” Its stinging specificity is only part of what makes it so special. She builds on that hurt and longing by speeding up synths in places, repeating the lyrics in plainspeak with alternating intentionality, hanging on to the lines, “I can barely afford to eat/But my love is heavenly,” as a reminder of what soothes. It’s an embodied sound, imbued with the knowledge of what it’s like to fuck up and be fucked up and live to sort through the psychic trash of both things being true. This resolute realness, the album’s plurality of wanting—whether privacy (“I! Gits! Weary!”) or pineapple-pear juice (“I Want My Things!”)—can only happen outside the major label gaze. KeiyaA seems to be telling the listener that, too, in her use of samples from a TV commercial for the 1986 compilation Hey Love… (The Classic Sounds of Sexy Soul). In the ad, three men and three women sit on separate couches, bored at a small house party, until the host puts on a new album he’s just received in the mail. Pairs form and begin a stilted slow dance to songs like “Betcha by Golly, Wow” by the Stylistics and “Yes, I’m Ready” by Barbara Mason. Before the 800 number fills the screen, one of the partiers says, “Fantastic album, man. Let me borrow it.” The host replies, “No, my brother, you’ve got to buy your own.” When KeiyaA samples their dialogue at the end of “Way Eye,” leading into “Rectifiya,” it’s not just a reference to some of her genre forebears, but a truth about working in your own creative ecosystem: The sound on Forever, Ya Girl belongs to her.

A Muse in Her Feelings,dvsn,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9e0f9b7b32470008c19537/1:1/w_160/A%20Muse%20In%20Her%20Feelings_dvsn.jpg,2020-04-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dvsn-a-muse-in-her-feelings/,OVO Sound,"Daniel Daley has a voice so striking that it’s almost an affront he began his career as a rapper and songwriter; imagine having that gift and not feeling called to flex it. Nineteen85, Daley’s partner in the R&B duo dvsn and an exceptional pop producer in his own right, also had a musical entry point far from where he would end up: in punk bands with names like Coffee Double the Cream. The two eventually linked up in a grittier, pre-Drake Toronto. And after some years of quiet trial and error, they landed on a signature sound, a kind of red-blooded R&B that gave Daley the space to glide between his tenor and falsetto, and gave 85 occasion to focus his chameleonic style. A Muse in Her Feelings, dvsn’s third album on OVO Sound, honors the core of that alliance, but gazes past its perimeter. A Muse in Her Feelings opener “No Good” is vintage dvsn: assuredly spare, with sparkling, Yamaha-style ’80s electric keys, unfussy drums, and coiled vocal melodies that recall Jagged Edge at their heartthrob best. But its austerity is a foil for much of the hour that follows. After two albums of insular restraint, Daley and 85 have pivoted towards expansiveness, inviting contributions from a surprising number of collaborators. There’s production from Drake and Travis Scott collaborator Allen Ritter, writing assists from James Fauntleroy, and multiple high-profile guest appearances. Future is in peak toxic mode on 2019 single “No Cryin”; Popcaan shines with a labyrinthine verse on “So What.” Buju Banton and Ty Dolla $ign form an inspired pair on “Dangerous City.” For the most part, the guests are wisely directed, buttressing Daley’s tenderness rather than muddying it. One low moment is “Courtside,” which features grating vocals from Jessie Reyez and a paternalistic concept that shares some spiritual DNA with that one City High song. 2017’s Morning After subtly hinted at an interest in the club, and the pair explores that instinct more fully on A Muse in Her Feelings. The album’s most interesting stretch is a risky three-track run that begins with the playful outro of “Outlandish,” builds into the Baltimore club-referencing “Keep It Going” and crests with the lusty “‘Flawless’ Do It Well, Pt. 3,” featuring Summer Walker in the role of an unflappable stripper. 85 wields his skill at turning vocal samples into lush but unlikely springboards for R&B—he repurposes a snippet of Daley’s voice for “Keep It Going,” and 702’s “Get It Together” adds emotional depth to “Flawless.” (The beat change on the latter could inspire a viral TikTok challenge.) Unfortunately, Daley’s voice is infinitely more evocative than most of his lyrics. He finds inspiration in the slipstream of love lost, but chooses cursory remorse over introspection or profound revelations, and his songwriting largely lacks the specificity that makes a great song a transcendent one. Shallow writing turns “For Us” into a parody of an aching slow jam: “I don’t wanna/Waste a minute of my life without you in it/I don’t wanna/Act like you ain’t been the one from the beginning.” “Dangerous City,” a moody epic about love in the face of violence, features some of the album’s least convincing lyrics: “Baby, it’s safer here with me because they know me/The only crime you'll ever face is feelin’ lonely.” What’s more, dvsn’s aesthetic choices—a corny album title, cliché visuals—chip away at their mystique. On the cover, Daley and 85 are perched at a pair of wooden easels, while a woman, nude and partially obscured, sits atop a pedestal in the foreground. There are no identifiable art supplies, presumably implying, to great secondhand embarrassment, that they are painting her with their music. Rather than subvert the concept of the muse, one of the most overused sexist tropes in modern art history, they are literally embodying the patriarchal male gaze. The image tracks with much of the album, which feels thin even when it’s skillful. On Twitter, they explained the title a little further: “A MUSE IN HER FEELINGS AMUSING HER FEELINGS I’M USING HER FEELINGS.” The triple entendre doesn’t have the depth dvsn was hoping for and even though there are songs with infinite replay value, the album doesn’t quite have the depth, either.","After two albums of insular restraint, the elegant R&B duo takes an expansive turn, embracing club sounds and multiple guest stars.

Duality,Duke Dumont,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9e12506be2540008370e5c/1:1/w_160/Duality_Duke%20Dumont.jpg,2020-04-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duke-dumont-duality/,Astralwerks,"Duke Dumont rode the mid-2010s wave of radio-friendly deep house into superstardom. Alongside contemporaries like Disclosure, he blended classic house tropes with the punchy clarity of modern EDM pop. In two years, Dumont topped the singles chart in his native United Kingdom twice and hit No. 1 on the U.S. Dance Club chart five times. Now, seven years after his breakout single, “Need U (100%),” Dumont’s debut LP only highlights how far dance music has moved on from the era when his soulful vocal chops and frictionless beats felt like a breath of fresh air. Duality takes its title from what Dumont claims are the two sides of his artistic self: consummate hitmaker and bold experimentalist. (“NO GENRE, NO BOUNDARIES, NO RESTRAINTS AND NO FEAR,” he asserted when he announced the album.) This split plays out, unsubtly, in the sequencing of the LP, with its dancier A-side and more introspective, freewheeling B-side. But it’s nearly impossible, on either front, to get a sense of anything that informs Dumont’s vision beyond unobjectionable studio chops and a residual penchant for clichéd EDM builds. The productions’ defining quality is that they are sufficiently devoid of idiosyncrasies to serve as adequate vehicles for guest vocalists. This approach didn’t always result in mediocrity. Dumont’s 2012 single “The Giver” spun a passing phrase from the late Chicago diva Kim English into an addictive groove, while “Need U (100%)” was a thunderous piece of UKG-inflected house, even without A*M*E’s entrancing vocals. But the songs on Duality rarely approach the vitality of those tracks. Lead single “Therapy,” with a forceful performance from Yola, ought to be a knockout, but a clumsy jumble of breaks and piano house keeps it from greatness. Other features are more criminally misused; on “Obey,” rudimentary techno stabs and stale acid breakdowns neuter an anti-establishment oration from legendary house vocalist Roland Clark. (It’s a shame, because Clark’s spoken-word efforts, as another one of his recent collaborations reveals, can be effective when they’re paired with less cluttered productions.) On the second half of the album, How to Dress Well is recognizable on the vocoder-heavy endeavor “Together,” if only in timbre. This superficial ode to unity largely falls flat, but that’s not all Tom Krell’s fault. At the emotional apex, when the track swells into syncopated blasts of synth and crash cymbal, Dumont makes a brazen attempt at triggering the intoxicating main-stage euphoria of one-time rave wunderkinds like Porter Robinson or Madeon. Then the overblown arena-rock drum fill kicks in, and the whole thing ends up sounding like a facsimile of other, more emotionally affecting songs—a cheap play to the rafters. It’s a staggering disappointment, especially from a producer who once touted his hitmaking foresight when it came to the electronic music zeitgeist. “This will sound arrogant, but before ‘Need U (100%),’ there were no house records that got to No.1 in the charts,” Dumont said back in 2016, proudly proclaiming that his single “Ocean Drive” would “spawn copycat records, which will inevitably be commercially more successful”—apparently having his sour-grapes cake and eating it too. Fitting, then, that a reprised version of that last song sits in the middle of his debut album’s tracklist, half a decade removed from its original release. The lush synth pop of “Ocean Drive” has retained much of its charm, and it’s the still best moment on the record, far more memorable than its closest counterpart (the Say Lou Lou collaboration “Nightcrawler”) or album closer “Let Me Go,” featuring Ry X, which begins as a Sam Smithian ballad before inflating itself with middling trance arpeggios. Duality wants to be the moment that Duke Dumont re-introduces himself as a producer who’s capable of both generation-defining dance records and more emotive electronic work. Instead, you’re left with the sense that in a post-EDM world, he doesn’t know where to go next.","Seven years after his breakout hit, the UK house producer’s debut album aims to bridge generation-defining dance sounds with more emotive electronic fare, but mostly struggles to find its way.

Ajai,Serengeti,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94bb3583ce9a0008c4a90a/1:1/w_160/Ajai_Serengeti.jpg,2020-04-22 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/serengeti-ajai/, Cohn Corporation,"For almost 20 years now, Nike has asked young patients at the OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland to design shoes. Jordans, Foamposites, what have you. These are snatched up by sneaker collectors across the world, including at an unveiling auction where one-of-one versions yield millions of dollars for the hospital. AirMax Zeros, VaporMaxs. They’re commodities, like anything else, but they turn the kids, many of them gravely ill, into spokespeople. About halfway through Ajai, the absurdly detailed new album from the Chicago rapper Serengeti, the titular character is making small talk at a Congressional Black Caucus dinner. He’s there with his wife, a prominent medical professional, and so he’s seated next to doctors; one explains “the reduction of drug costs making it mandatory for federally qualified health centers to accept Medicaid.” Ajai doesn’t respond directly. He unlocks his phone, scrolls over to a photo of the Doernbecher 8s, and asks a simple question: “Have you ever won a shoe lottery?” Over the last 20 years—roughly the same span as the Doernbecher program—Serengeti has made some of the most exhilaratingly strange records in rap’s underground. He’s like a ventriloquist with a deep Rolodex and deeper depression, a web of grand declarations and muttered asides sprawled across dozens of albums and EPs. Ajai is one of his most sharply drawn figures yet: a young Indian man obsessed with exclusive drops and merch collabs, who sets multiple alarms to wade through webpages or go stand in line and cop multiples if they have them. From the beginning, Ajai makes plain his rationale: “Clothes is just clothes, I like the way that I look/I like the people in line, I like the effort it took.” But a dark undercurrent runs underneath. When he and his wife go on vacation (“Walking down the streets in Paris/It’s autumn here, and I’m in Supreme”), Ajai leaves her at a table so he can flee the restaurant and offer a passerby cold hard Euros for his stained sneakers; he returns during dessert and asks if she’d like to go shop for enzyme cleaners. At other points, Ajai’s wife cries from the other side of a bathroom door as her husband risks missing their flight to Cleveland (“You look fine, Ajai”); she begs him not to wear a certain suit to a work function; she drives him wordlessly home from a company softball game, where he has embarrassed both of them, Ajai “deeply nodding his head” to SWV while he bares his gold teeth––surely expensive. Ajai’s story is confined to the record’s front half. This enforced brevity is an excuse to showcase Serengeti’s masterful storytelling: The fourth song is called, simply, “Summary,” and chronicles Ajai’s short-lived stint as a tutor to four Chinese boys, who are enamored with his tales of street life (Ajai “once did an overnight stay at a jail due to a clerical error”) and whose angry father soon forbids the relationship. He challenges Ajai to a fight, only for Ajai’s neighbor, a fireman, to step in as a proxy and be “savagely and entertainingly beaten” on camera, and lose his “beautiful wife, the Estonian” to the Chinese father. In the middle of all this, Ajai goes to therapy; he asks his therapist about the first time she saw the Balenciaga Triple S trainer. “She starts talking about self-esteem,” Serengeti raps, “but he’s distracted by her boring chair.” On the B-side of Ajai, Serengeti returns to his most famous character, a semi-retired white rapper named Kenny Dennis, who’s beefed with Shaq, vehemently defended Steve Bartman, fallen in love with the late actor Brian Dennehy’s work, pined after a wife he believes was stolen by Tom Selleck, and suffered at least one psychotic break. When we re-meet Kenny during Ajai, he’s moved to Minneapolis and is working at a breakfast truck near an I-94 overpass. The album moves inevitably toward the point where Kenny has something Ajai wants to buy, but the transactional specifics are far less important than the baggage each man brings to the bargaining emails. As Kenny Dennis, Serengeti raps in a thick Chicagoland accent; the Ajai half serves as a counterpoint, revealing just how dexterous a rapper and vocalist Geti can be. These halves are stitched together by the veteran Los Angeles producer Kenny Segal. After a formative period working with esteemed Angeleno rappers, including members of Freestyle Fellowship, Segal has of late taken to crafting full albums for some of rap’s most distinct voices. Over the last year alone, he’s helmed growling, stuttering LPs for R.A.P. Ferreira and billy woods. His beats here skitter from playful piano loops to claustrophobic fits: see “Don’t Wear That Suit Ajai,” which feels, unnervingly, like early RZA on less dust and more coffee. The point here is not that “consumerism is bad,” or that you might get scammed trying to buy the Virgil/IKEA collab rug (“about six and a half feet,” Geti notes, recommending it for concrete or marble floors). Ajai is done in by his compulsions, his tunnel vision––not a ruinous Supreme drop. To hear him tell it, each long line or digital waiting room is its own Everest, and that rapid, dizzying ascent is worth the thousands of dollars and crying wives left in its wake. The world rendered on Ajai can seem silly: exclusive honey to buy in bulk, Travis Scott socks on auction blocks, “rich Kuwaiti kids” who might drop so much money on your work uniform that you can retire early, American kids running up to middle-aged men promising thousands of dollars if they’ll sell their shoes off on the spot, the Grey Poupon ads as an emotional touchstone, the word “Balenciaga” as an ancient, guttural chant, the promise that branded goods shuffled by UPS from point to point can save us all. This world, of course, is our own.","The absurdly detailed new album from the Chicago rapper delves into the compulsions of its titular sneakerhead character over rich production from Kenny Segal.

Pray For Paris,Westside Gunn,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e99dc30e21e4f0009eaf086/1:1/w_160/prayforparis.jpg,2020-04-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/westside-gunn-pray-for-paris/,Griselda,"There was a time when Westside Gunn and his Griselda cohorts Conway and Benny the Butcher were just some Buffalo rappers warming themselves on the flame sparked by Roc Marciano’s Marcberg. To rap fans who longed for the days of Mobb Deep, Griselda were refreshing, a no-frills trio that recaptured an old-school spirit without being ’90s revivalists. Despite the harsh grayscale atmosphere of their production, the bars had the colorful touch of mid-’00s Atlanta trap, and their swagger felt timeless. Steadily the energy behind Griselda has grown, and now it’s at an apex that nobody saw coming. Earlier this year, at Virgil Abloh’s Off-White fashion show, the designer and influencer played Westside Gunn’s gutter rap while models strutted down the runway and a man tap-danced. Virgil’s message with the tap dancer didn’t connect, but the cosign gave Griselda an unlikely path into fashion and art spaces typically not welcoming to gritty artists like them. It’s a space that Westside Gunn is obsessed with, and his new album, Pray for Paris is an attempt to leave his crew’s past as a niche underground act behind. His new vision is of going high-art: the album cover was designed by Virgil; the intro is a clip from the record-breaking sale of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi”; and a recent Instagram caption included the obligatory Kanye-style spiel about how he’s not a rapper, he’s an artist making misunderstood “Rare ART.” Yes, this all sounds like an unbearable pivot. But Pray for Paris is one of the best albums to come out of the Griselda camp so far, good enough to help you forgive the obnoxiousness and make you understand why the crew now have a cultural cachet that rap legends are dying to be attached to: Eminem signed them to his imprint, JAY-Z has become their unofficial mentor, and Kanye West has been seen floating around the three. To Westside Gunn’s credit, the more overblown his personality becomes, the better his raps get. He blurs the lines between reality and fiction to the point where the streets of Buffalo come off like City of God’s favelas, and his lifestyle raps make him out as the Great Gatsby of Upstate New York. The beat to “Euro Step” sounds refined enough to play during a sit-down dinner in a castle while he describes some snapshots from his life: purchasing a Goyard leash for his Saint Bernard, drinking wine in France with a specialist, and whipping coke with an Avian watch on his wrist. Pray for Paris is consistently this insane, all while switching flows on a dime and rapping on pristine beats. “Bulletproof Bentleys parked outside the Whitney,” he raps on the second track’s graceful DJ Muggs production. Westside Gunn’s revolving door of guests thrive in this space, though it means he’s sometimes outshined. Gunn wastes a spiritual Alchemist beat with a pitch-lowered misstep on  “Claiborne Kick,” but he’s saved by Boldy James’ unmatched precision. But Gunn doesn’t fumble frequently; usually he tosses his guests into the fold and let’s them sink or swim. Tyler, the Creator can’t keep up “327,” but who could when Gunn talks about cooking dope like watching flowers bloom? Tyler makes up for it with his soulful “Party Wit Pop Smoke” production, while Gunn goes on the album’s most unhinged three bar stretch: “Blood on the Salavator Mundi, we rock cocaine/Tie-dye Dior floss, stickin’ niggas up at Christie’s/Eugene Delacroixs for half price, leather strings and Rickys.” But even with all of the decadence, Pray for Paris is at its best when Westside Gunn just raps over a grimy beat alongside his Griselda crew. On “Allah Sent Me,” they all share a verse, and their chemistry shines. On “George Bondo,” all three fight for the moment: Westside Gunn prays on a Persian rug, Conway hits the Roc Nation brunch and intimately mingles with an R&B singer, and Benny the Butcher orders a hit at the Venetian. It all feels like a part of Westside Gunn’s vision for Griselda, which may be deranged, but only a mind that determined could take a crew that was destined to exist in a corner of underground rap to having their own ecosystem.","The  Buffalo rapper continues his unlikely ascent into hip-hop stardom with an album of feverish excess and the best raps of his career.

Blame It on Baby,DaBaby,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9de95a2071a50008c2bd34/1:1/w_160/Blame%20It%20On%20Baby_DaBaby.jpg,2020-04-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dababy-blame-it-on-baby/,South Coast Music GroupInterscope,"On DaBaby’s biggest song, he asked himself to switch the flow. He didn’t. “BOP” hurtled forward like he’d been shot from a cannon. His potent, barraging raps sound like they’re spurting out of him; the joke goes that they’re all different versions of the same song. DaBaby aims to be everywhere at once: on remixes of any Spotify chart-topper, coursing through TikTok, following pop culture wherever it leads. Of course he put out an album in the middle of quarantine—on the cover, he poses in a face mask, declaring his relevance to The Current Moment. Blame It on Baby reaches for more and resonates less. Half the album is stacked with the same regurgitated phrases and flows from earlier projects, stale the third time around; for the rest, DaBaby follows formulas other than his own. Though he’s known for being a capital-R Rapper, DaBaby clears his throat—literally, before admitting, “My voice kinda fucked up”—and tries to sing, sometimes with grating results. On “Rockstar,” he doesn’t imitate Roddy Ricch as much as adjust his tone to complement the feature. His voice becomes softer, as close as DaBaby gets to tender, as he talks about the physical jolt of PTSD, “waking up in cold sweats like the flu.” On “Find My Way,” he dribbles syllables over languid guitar. He follows A Boogie’s lead on “Drop,” catatonic and crooning. This is the first music he’s released that sounds limp. Some of that slowness comes from trudging through the murk of non-apologies and fledging repentance. DaBaby apparently slapped a woman at a recent event; in January, he was arrested for allegedly robbing someone and then pouring apple juice on them. Aggression is a key facet of DaBaby’s music, fueling his viciousness and velocity, and it’s often cartoonish; still, the record’s glimpses of violence can become disconcerting, especially when they involve women (“Put my dick down her throat ’til she throw up,” he raps on “Lightskin Shit”). “Can’t Stop,” the album opener, is weighed down by DaBaby’s insistence that he’s not sorry. On “Sad Shit,” he mimics a generic, desolate Drake song, soaking his voice in AutoTune and rasping pleas. It’s all fake, the sentiment and the sound, and after a few crooned apologies, DaBaby shouts, “Fuck that,” and goes back to tallying up the women he’s slept with. It’s not until “Jump,” eight tracks in, that the album turns familiarly propulsive—but it’s not DaBaby, it’s YoungBoy Never Broke Again doing his best DaBaby impression. If you’ve listened to DaBaby for a while now, you know his bits. He groans about fans asking for photos. He growls that he’s a dog. Even his most creative rhyme patterns become predictable when he’s employed them so many times before. Usually, the repetition is accompanied by rattling bass and blown-out speakers, or raps so fast the flows create a vortex; on these more subdued, slowed-down tracks, every recycled word is noticeable. Most of his past producers have followed the Jetsonmade model of pouncing drums and bass, a concentrated bump of adrenaline, but the production throughout this album slinks and tingles. DaBaby’s charm gets diluted; he sounds measured and restrained, not words typically associated with DaBaby. This is music to bob your head at, not lose your shit to. Ever the savvy marketer, DaBaby does manage a few highlights that seem packaged to go viral. “Nasty” pairs a gleaming lilt from Ashanti with a fun, dynamic Megan Thee Stallion verse. It doesn’t have the explosive power of “Cash Shit,” Megan and DaBaby’s last collaboration, but the song is still mesmerizing, with DaBaby’s absurd, precise eroticism in full force. The album’s payoff arrives on the title track, a two-minute opus that stitches together four beat switches and contorts DaBaby’s flow over and over. It builds, it thrills, it makes you feel like you can run through a wall—everything a DaBaby song can and should do, when he asks it of himself.","The North Carolina rapper’s third album in 13 months is stacked with the same regurgitated phrases and flows from earlier projects. This time, they’re starting to go stale.

Earth,EOB,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e99e01f1845400008028bbc/1:1/w_160/eartheob.jpg,2020-04-21 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eob-earth/,Capitol,"For all of the radical reinventions Radiohead have undergone over the past 30-odd years—the shift to experimental electronica, the redrafting of instrumental roles, Thom Yorke’s ponytail—guitarist Ed O’Brien has always remained guitarist Ed O’Brien. Amid the flurry of instrument swapping and machine tweaking that occurs at a typical Radiohead concert, O’Brien is rarely without his six-string and trusty bank of effects pedals, while his backing vocals often provide a crucial melodic underpinning for Yorke’s flights of fancy. That grounding principle carries over to his first proper solo album. Where Yorke and Jonny Greenwood have used their extracurricular projects to further explore dissonant techno and avant-garde orchestration, O’Brien’s debut as EOB revisits the late-’80s/early-’90s student-disco sounds that gave rise to his main gig. While his bandmates are going on about Flying Lotus and Oliver Messiaen, O’Brien is preaching the life-changing effects of Screamadelia. That said, Earth isn’t your typical guitar-based rock record. Inspired in part by O’Brien’s year-long stint living in Brazil in 2012, the album was initially conceived as a solo electronic effort before exposure to the country’s famed Carnival festivals prompted a more communal, celebratory approach. While he stopped short of making a batucada album, he did rally an all-star cast—including producer Flood, Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley, and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche—to infuse the songs with a more physical spirit. The opening “Shangri-La” was actually written after an all-nighter at the eponymous Glastonbury DJ stage, and though this wiry rocker is more Blur than PLUR (thanks to O’Brien’s uncannily Coxon-esque chorus), the track exudes a playfully scrappy energy and hedonic swagger that greatly distinguish it from any other Radiohead-related product. The record eventually achieves its true peak-hour potential on “Olympik,” which sounds like an Achtung Baby-era U2 song stretched out into a sweaty, !!!-style punk-funk workout. Between those high points, Earth can feel less like a dance-festival communion and more like the lonely, meandering trek back to your pup tent in the dark. The album’s more robust rhythmic exercises are counterbalanced by mellow meditations, and while these yield some affecting moments (like “Cloak of the Night,” a sort of coffeehouse “Dear Prudence” duet with Laura Marling), the songwriting isn’t captivating enough to sustain momentum during Earth’s simmered-down stretches. “Deep Days” comes on with bald, brow-raising expressions of desire but neuters them in a foot-dragging acoustic-soul lurch, while the atmospheric textures that envelop folk sketches like “Mess” and “Sail On” aren’t enough to compensate for their slight, vaporous melodies. Even when O’Brien suddenly detours from campfire tropicalia into Hacienda bacchanalia partway through “Brasil,” the track plateaus when it should soar, as if the mere novelty of flipping the switch was enough to justify riding out its mid-tempo Madchester groove past the eight-minute mark. For an album rooted in the idea of connectedness, Earth feels more like a mood board of ideas in search of a through line. Nowhere is the record’s jumbled quality more pronounced than on “Banksters,” a song O’Brien wrote in response to the 2008 financial crash. Hating on the 1 percent has hardly gone out of style since then, but the song’s vitriol and strident topicality feel out of place on an album otherwise occupied with more personal and spiritual concerns. And while the fact that “Banksters” sounds like a bossa-nova “Paranoid Android” may appeal to that faction of old-school Radiohead fans who still rue the day Thom Yorke bought his first Aphex Twin record, it ultimately seals Earth’s fate as the sort of tasteful, tentatively adventurous post-Britpop record that would’ve gotten sandwiched between Elbow and South on a “next Radiohead” listicle 20 years ago.","Unlike his bandmates’ forays in electronica or contemporary classical, Radiohead guitarist Ed O’Brien’s solo debut looks fondly back at the kind of British rock his own group abandoned.

Different EP,GuiltyBeatz,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9debbfd836c60009bec961/1:1/w_160/Different%20EP_GuiltyBeatz.jpg,2020-04-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/guiltybeatz-different-ep/,Banku MusicemPawa Africa,"In recent years, popular African artists have received a few bright moments in the American spotlight. In 2016, Drake’s “One Dance” became the first song to reach one billion Spotify streams with the help of South African producer DJ Maphorisa and Nigerian supernova Wizkid. Two summers went by before another African artist made a real splash on U.S. charts. Finally, in 2019, Davido’s “Fall,” Afro B’s “Drogba (Joanna),” and Burna Boy’s “Ye” became day-party soundtracks. Then, last July, Beyoncé released The Lion King: The Gift, a compilation of songs inspired by the Disney remake that featured some of the continent’s key contemporary talents. Ghanaian producer and DJ GuiltyBeatz was one of the talents Bey recruited. The three standouts he co-produced on The Gift were smooth, sauntering afrobeats, akin to hits that had gained traction in the U.S. already. His debut EP brings change: The predominately afro-house songs on Different demand more—both physically and mentally—than “One Dance,” “Fall,” or “Joanna.” This is not music to lounge or two-step to on a sunny day. These songs pulse and pull, building a shadowy, clubby world from echoing synths, pounding percussion, and slick, scant singing. GuiltyBeatz has been to Coachella, DJing for Nigerian Afropop star Mr Eazi; with Different, he sets his sights on Tomorrowland, where he can be an electronic maestro. Different is loosely about desire—romantic, sexual, and economic—but most listeners won’t catch everything the cast of vocalists is saying. They’re from three different countries, and perform in at least four languages. Nigerian dreamboat Joeboy stars on “No Love,” sometimes warding off gold-diggers in Yoruba, sometimes skating across the beat with rhythmic punctuations. On “Condom Collector,” South Africa’s Moonchild Sanelly powerfully professes her coital obsession in English. On “My Vibe,” Ghana’s J.Derobie seduces his lover in patois. But it’s GuiltyBeatz’s thoughtful production and sequencing that speaks loudest. He moves between sentimental longing and brazen lust with transitions so sleek it’s hard to tell where one song ends and another begins. “No Love” slips into “Uthando,” where the sweet-voiced Nigerian singer Nonso Amadi beckons you deeper down Beatz’s mystic path. The drums sparsen to usher in “My Vibe,” whose final keys flow easily into “How Long.” Different is only 16 minutes long, but like a satisfying workout, it both exhausts and energizes. Beneath the project’s electronic umbrella, Beatz shows off his genre dexterity. “My Vibe” is a sultry dancehall number. With a delicate piano melody atop galloping drums, “How Long” has the air of South African amapiano music. The EP’s most backbreaking track, “Condom Collector,” takes cues from gqom, a subgenre of South African house with BPMs around 126. It is relentless and exorbitant, but GuiltyBeatz manages a smooth comedown. Wisely saving the familiar for last, he caps Different with its months-old single, “IYABO,” an afro-house cut with pop flare. The kooky buzz of its synths suggests the twirling walls of a funhouse exit. Africa to the world is a popular rallying cry of the continent’s artists, whose work speaks in every tongue to the breadth and universality of Africa’s gifts. Born in Italy and raised in Ghana, GuiltyBeatz imagines a global audience for himself and his peers. His debut is not just for Saturday afternoons at Everyday People, the popular dance party celebrating the black diaspora; it’s also made for voltaic raves, psychedelic highs, and steamy trysts. Different envisions a Western world that doesn’t relegate African and Caribbean sounds solely to warm weather and tropical vacations. With a six-song survey of African electronic music’s boldest and shiniest new ideas, GuiltyBeatz begins to draw the lines of a more interconnected future.","The Ghanaian producer and DJ’s debut surveys contemporary African electronic music, uniting a breadth of influences and guest vocalists in a shadowy, clubby musical world.

SAWAYAMA,Rina Sawayama,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94b867b09a5100092ba764/1:1/w_160/SAWAYAMA_Rina%20Sawayama.jpg,2020-04-20 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rina-sawayama-sawayama/,Dirty Hit,"The scene: TRL, 1999. The tweens: legion, transforming Times Square into a cheer section and breaking the dial-up internet voting for their video faves. Those videos: Backstreet Boys, Britney, and Korn’s “Freak on a Leash.” The nu-metal hit was No. 1 on TRL about 10 times—it probably would have topped the charts longer had MTV not pulled it after Columbine—and shared space with Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and other decidedly un-bubblegum bands. Of course, these days nu-metal is considered—to put it kindly—fairly uncool. But nobody relayed the genre’s future uncoolness to the tweenage millennials who imprinted on it: Grimes, Poppy, and now Japanese-British artist Rina Sawayama, who “kind of [likes] making really uncool things cool.” SAWAYAMA, her debut album after years of retromaniac singles, does for Y2K pop what Hulu’s PEN15 did for Y2K middle school: recreates it to the tiniest detail. Many of us would like to escape to 2000 these days, and musicians more than anyone; in the span of a few months in 2018 we got songs called “1999” and “2002,” both of which interpolate the same Britney lyric, neither of which quite capture the year. But SAWAYAMA sounds like actual 1999 and 2002, when they had producers other than Max Martin, bands other than the boy variety, and arrangements so overproduced that now, in this time of endless chill, they’re almost refreshing. The album’s other big reference points are Timbaland and the Neptunes—particularly Exodus, the Timbaland-assisted album by J-pop star and Sawayama’s childhood idol Utada Hikaru—and “heavier Britney stuff.” Her audience is people who know exactly which songs she means. The Korn-iest song on SAWAYAMA is lead single “STFU!”, in which Sawayama summons the genre’s aggression and redirects it against casual racists; in the video, they’re embodied by a composite of every white sadsack on Hinge, who serenades his date with actual shit Sawayama heard from label execs. But her take on nu-metal bypasses bros entirely, beginning with Garbage—at times Sawayama sounds eerily like Shirley Manson, or maybe Tori Amos if her Slayer cover was actual Slayer—and pivoting on the chorus to singsong bubblegum pop. So when she finally really lets loose, with a howling last note and roaring crescendo, the eruption’s been primed. “STFU!” is also a bit of a red herring. Most of Sawayama’s nu-metal influence appears either in snippets, like the riffs that intermittently “flare up like an underlying zit” beneath “XS,” in translation, like the guitars that blend into new jack swing “Love Me 4 Me” by being so canned they’re shelf-stable, or in absence: the album’s gentlest, most contemplative song, which is called “Fuck This World.” Often, the artists to whom Sawayama pays homage are those who already blended the genres. “Dynasty” is an obvious take on Evanescence (“a little pocket of culture that people are maybe too scared [to reference],” she called the band) and is more like nu-melodrama: an intro with an airhorn but also strings, butt-rock but also church bells, a showy guitar solo but also a soprano vocal tracing it. “Who’s Gonna Save U Now?” is like the lost third sibling to Britney’s “Stronger” and Christina’s “Fighter,” and the song, complete with cheering fans and call-and-response, captures arena heroics in these arenaless times. The production of SAWAYAMA is so immaculate that when she attempts to satirize pop music, she plays the part too well. “XS” (pronounced “excess”) matches style to subject, luxuriating in the rhymes of “Tesla Xs” with “Calabasas.” It could be a lost Cora Corman track from Music and Lyrics—which is to say, only satire in context. The slinky “Comme Des Garçons (Like the Boys)” mashes together “I Feel Love,” Christine and the Queens’ “Girlfriend,” a thwacking house beat, and Madonna-esque backing vocals into something supposedly about Beto O’Rourke. But even if you didn’t pick up on that, it still sounds like hitting yourself in the head with a silk scarf wrapped around your fist. Most of the album, though, is absolutely irony-free, and better for it. The chorus of “Bad Friend,” the rare friend-breakup song by the guilty party, cloaks Sawayama’s voice in a thick cloak of vocoder that falls away at the last “friend”: a sudden pang of sincerity, when it’s too late. “Chosen Family” pairs a Nickelodeon-sweet melody with Danny L Harle production, and the sugar content would overwhelm almost any topic but this: the “chosen family” of LGBTQ friends, which hasn’t often received the specific affirmation of pop ballads. “Paradisin’” begins with a video-game blip like it’s zapping you back to teenagerdom and runs on the manic, buzzing-out-of-your skin energy of being 15 and damning all consequences. Best of all, at the end, is “Snakeskin.” The track begins like a torch song or an aria, Sawayama’s voice heavy and ominous. She goes into a sinuous vocal coil—the corresponding “heavier Britney song” is probably “Over to You Now”—then lets it build to a hissing drop (maybe more 2013 than 2003, but who’s counting?). Even if it didn’t interpolate the Final Fantasy fanfare, it would still sound like defeating the world. That’s what sets Sawayama apart: A neural network could add Papa Roach to its aughties pastiche. What’s harder to fake is the desperate, pulsing emotion beneath the songs, the kind that demands listeners pour in their own emotion until the song overflows.","The Japanese-British pop singer’s debut is a Y2K flashback that’s as reverent of Evanescence and Korn as it is of Britney and Christina.

The Don of Diamond Dreams,Shabazz Palaces,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e98ad3ce21e4f0009eaf07a/1:1/w_160/The%20Don%20of%20Diamond%20Dreams_Shabazz%20Palaces.jpg,2020-04-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shabazz-palaces-the-don-of-diamond-dreams/,Sub Pop,"Ishmael Butler and Tendai “Baba” Maraire of Shabazz Palaces have always been proud iconoclasts, consistently breaking ground in spaces once thought incompatible with hip-hop. They were among the few rap acts signed to Sub Pop; they were pretty much the only rap artists to ever perform at the avant-garde Big Ears festival in Knoxville. This adventurous spirit continues down the Butler family line with Ishmael’s son Jazz, aka Lil Tracy. It seems that Jazz’s work has had a profound effect on his father’s project; in recent interviews, Butler cites his own son as an influence. As one of the original members of the GothBoiClique, Tracy is an important figure in the development of “emo rap,” and what’s fascinating about Shabazz’s new album The Don of Diamond Dreams is the degree to which Ish seems to be learning from the new generation. Like polarizing label mates clipping., Shabazz’s brand of “alternative” hip-hop is not so much opposed to the mainstream as it is reflective of it, absorbing tangents of influence from trap, Auto-Tuned R&B, chopped and screwed, and other variants. Their lyrics are often shaped by the hip-hop hegemony too, playing off Rap Caviar tropes and taunting the Top 40 with a tongue-in-cheek braggadociousness, the kind that lets you know that Butler is still the same MC who told us he was cool like that all those years ago. On The Don of Diamond Dreams, the group absorbs and warps a different sonic palette than usual: listen for the loopy guitar solos on “Wet,” or the swaying riffs on “Bad Bitch Walking” and “Fast Learner.” That spectrum of influence is a new strand in their complex sound, but what surrounds it is very much classic Shabazz: glistening synth crystals on tracks like “Ad Ventures,” Maraire’s distinctive kick drum throughout, and a lyrical ode to the Divine Feminine (not their first) on “Thanking the Girls.” The Shabazz project began a decade ago with Butler and Maraire searching for a place in the cosmos alongside their Afrofuturist inspirations; their discography has been a process of ascension, elevation, and spiritual expansion, from novice pupils to musical prophets. For years now, Shabazz Palaces have oozed a kind of creative wisdom, the type that can only come with age and years of lived experience, but The Don of Diamond Dreams demonstrates a sign of even deeper wisdom: living an entire life of your own, and realizing that there’s still value in learning and listening from the youth.","Ishmael Butler, the MC of the futurist hip-hop duo, looks in a new direction for inspiration on his latest project: his own son, emo rapper Lil Tracy.

Knuckleball Express,The Howling Hex,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e98b384e21e4f0009eaf07c/1:1/w_160/Knuckleball%20Express_The%20Howling%20Hex.jpg,2020-04-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-howling-hex-knuckleball-express/,Fat Possum,"For a band who often looked like they had just rolled in from recording Exile on Main Street, Royal Trux were far too abstruse to be genuinely retro. But recent noises from Neil Hagerty—former/current/who knows? Royal Truck and now head honcho of the Howling Hex —have suggested a certain wistfulness in his dotage. “Rock and roll is what’s missing in bands these days that take a generic approach to playing that’s almost machine-like,” he harrumphed to Rolling Stone, indulging the kind of ruefully nostalgic statement that Liam Gallagher would tape to the studio mood board. The new Howling Hex album, Hagerty said, would be 100% real—a record, he promised elsewhere, that “people want to listen to without throwing it out the window.” To an extent, Hagerty keeps this promise on Knuckleball Express, the first Howling Hex album since Royal Trux’s ill-fated, occasionally wonderful reunion. Black Crowes fans will certainly find less to defenestrate than on 2013’s not-actually-a-best-of The Best of the Howling Hex, which was awash in polka rhythms, fuzz, and bizarre cowpunk lurch. “Lies,” the most immediate yet least satisfying track on Knuckleball Express, is a slice of heads-down Southern boogie, frenetic enough to raise a knowing smile without greatly troubling the cortex, while “Words” oozes with the leery strut of an acceptable Jagger outtake. Elsewhere, Knuckleball Express has enough of Royal Trux’s obstinate weirdness and willful rough edges to distinguish it from the retro blues of the barroom band. Hagerty’s guitar may be turned up as loud as you would expect of a man who has recently escaped an unhappy musical partnership, but there’s something deliciously unrefined about his playing, all jagged lines, rusty nails, and hangover shuffle. The drums have a similarly imperfect edge, their classic rock clip punctuated with a few too many lolloping tom rolls for comfort, while many songs shun the traditional verse/chorus structure in favor of bolting intros to riffs and solos to verses. “Heavy Curtains” sounds—brilliantly—like three unrelated songs welded together in a musical cut and shut. At its best, Knuckleball Express channels its awkwardness into songs that are thrilling in their instability. “Mr. Chicken” trembles on the edge of collapse before the unexpectedly well-mannered vocals of Kristine Shafer nudge the song into Belle and Sebastian-meets-Pussy Galore territory. “Cowboy Motors"" throws a harpsichord into the mix for no particular reason, like a cruel parody of 1960s baroque pop, while “North Aquarian” introduces a drunken-sounding face-off between drummer and electronic squiggles—hardly Beatrice Dillon in its audacity, but modish enough to remind you that Knuckleball Express was recorded this millennium. This waywardness is important. The tensions that drove Royal Trux, like many bands before them, were the same impulses that eventually unraveled the group. The risk for Knuckleball Express was that Hagerty, safely ensconced in Colorado with no tempestuous bandmate to spark off, might have succumbed to the easy musical life. Certainly, there are moments here—like “City in the Country,” where he hymns the “sweet Rocky Mountain waves”—that suggest a certain mellowing. But Hagerty remains as wily and weird as ever. Full of charm, panache, and eccentric raw power, Knuckleball Express makes good on his promise to make something real.","With the Royal Trux once again in his rearview mirror, Neil Hagerty returns to his own group. In place of the genre mashups of 2013’s Best Of, he’s back to making satisfyingly ragged rock’n’roll.

Viewing,Stay Inside,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9891ad524f9300087cc965/1:1/w_160/Viewing_Stay%20Inside.jpg,2020-04-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stay-inside-viewing/,No Sleep,"Let’s just get this out of the way: Stay Inside would have been just as timely of a band name at any point in the Brooklyn group’s short existence. On their bracing debut Viewing, bassist/vocalist Bryn Nieboer reckons with what she calls “the worst thing that happened to me in my life,” framing her personal trauma within the generational traumas of the last four years. Viewing is the work of a band formed amidst ongoing biological and political disasters, and the songs explore end-times questions: What is the purpose of creation in a state of perpetual impermanence? What is the meaning of forgiveness and hope when the arc of the moral universe is irreversibly off course? Stay Inside’s music shares the physique of Travis Bickle or Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, if not their regressive nihilism—they sound gaunt and wiry, the songs’ shredded musculature meant to frighten more than impress, developed in isolation as a defense mechanism to New York’s daily interpersonal cruelties. Viewing moves at a dyspeptic churn, its melodies alternately soaring and sour, their imagery borne of a lonesome, crowded Brooklyn, full of corrosives and irritants. Stay Inside earmark their arrangements with reminders of abject and vivid squalor that pop up like roaches—a recurring burst of feedback used to segue between tracks, the burrowing one-note riff of “Revisionist,” the chords of “Veil” slowly denaturing into atonality. “The picture’s weak/Everything’s a copy that I’m copying,” guitarist and vocalist Chris Johns sings on the opening “Revisionist,” in Viewing’s predominant pose: a snarl and a shrug. Having gotten a bombastically titled EP out of their system (2018’s The Sea Engulfs Us and the Light Goes Out), Stay Inside here commit to clarity, reducing the past two decades of emo and post-hardcore’s most serious variants into its most potent concentrate, stripped of pretensions. Each track hones its essence into urgent, mononym titles, with nothing in the arrangements to detract from their focused messages. A visit to the spacious, twinkling skies of Midwestern emo is pointedly called “Divide,” Viewing’s sole and fleeting beacon of light before Side B plunges towards the abyss. At their most anthemic (“Ivy,” “Monument”), Stay Inside fuse screamo brutality with post-punk elegance, suggesting an alternate history where Interpol recorded Turn on the Bright Lights with the guy from seminal screamo band Saetia still on drums. Viewing is one of the most confidently executed emo debuts of recent vintage, and it’s poignant to wonder what the live show would be like. Emo albums are usually made with sweaty, crowded, all-ages shout-alongs in mind, the kind of experience quarantine has rendered impossible. But unlike, say, Dogleg’s transcendent Melee, Viewing doesn’t feel designed as group therapy meant to foster togetherness. True to the name, Stay Inside finds purpose and nobility in doing push ups in a stuffy apartment, sublimating anger into action, working through shit in isolation before rejoining society—an aim that will make it just as relevant when the next disaster strikes.","The Brooklyn band’s debut is one of the most confidently executed emo debuts of recent vintage, a bracing fusion of brutality and elegance.

Born To Do It,Craig David,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e9093cbac9e490008f40864/1:1/w_160/Born%20To%20Do%20It_Craig%20David.jpg,2020-04-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/craig-david-born-to-do-it/,WildstarAtlantic,"It took 15 years to clear his name. Sweet boyish Craig, good as gold, bullied out of his dream. How had it come to this? A star birthed from UK garage yet regarded as a footnote within it. Born To Do It, a multi-platinum hit parade that codified the wider world’s perception of what UKG was all about, reduced to the fine nub of a joke. For as long as there was a stigma attached to the sound, there was a stigma attached to its pin-up. UK garage originally incubated in South London pubs, as DJs pitched up slabs of American garage house for buzzy ravers looking to push the feeling on to Sunday afternoon. A cut like Mood II Swing’s “Closer (Swing to Mood Dub)” was dynamite, sauntering about with a jazzy flair, but anchored by tough and unyielding drums. In Todd Edwards, the scene had an early unifier, a squeaky-clean sample wizard from New Jersey who gave himself to God first, garage second. His “Saved My Life” was released in 1995 but stayed in rotation for years as UKG developed, a benchmark for how creative the format could become in due course. Edwards showed you didn’t necessarily have to be a renegade club kid to cut it in this new world. British producers upped the ante, making the basslines chunkier and altering the straight-ahead flow of garage house, so that MCs crossing over from hardcore and jungle raves could find moments within DJ sets to command and conquer the dance. In 1997, Kelly G’s wailing remix of Tina Moore’s minor R&B hit “Never Gonna Let You Go” was a radio smash, breaking the door down for the popularization of 2-step. This variant took the lightly swung drums of UKG and made them outright skippy. Even if this initially caught the unaware flat-footed in an attempt to follow the groove, dominant female voices filled the space left open once the consistent pulse of a four-to-the-floor kick was subtracted. Homegrown singers like Shola Ama, Kele Le Roc, and Anita Kelsey gave listeners something alluring to latch onto, as well as balancing the rowdiness of geezers on the mic. By 1999, UK garage had gone national. No matter if you repped speed or soul or skip, the mood of the moment was intoxicating. Whenever the sun was out—far from a given in the UK, so appearances are celebrated with gusto––UKG blasted out of cars, ricocheted across council terraces, and accompanied grill smoke on its twist upward to the sky. People got dressed up to go out dancing: no hats, no hoods, no trainers; all smiles, everything nice ’n’ ripe. Champagne replaced H2O in the bloodstream. Times were as good as could be. As Great Britain blearily swept the kitchen on the first day of the new millennium, a song called “Re-Rewind” was boinging around the top of the charts. Its opening three seconds are an effective elevator pitch to everything attractive about garage: a woofer-vibrating rumble, head turning SFX (in this case, shattering glass), an Anglicized ""selec-tah,"" then a snare which springs us forward into major-key chords—and, invariably, a cork being popped. “Re-Rewind” was the first of seven UK top 10 hits in 2000 shared between Craig David and his producer Mark Hill, one-half of DJ duo Artful Dodger. April’s racy follow-up “Fill Me In,” billed this time as David’s solo debut, shot to No.1, making him the youngest artist in British chart history to open their account at the top. The great misremembering about Born To Do It is that the garage ends there. “Re-Rewind” and “Fill Me In” form the double helix of commercial UKG’s DNA, staples of every themed throwback party, brunch, cruise, and symphony ever since—but the rest of the album is barely a garage record at all. Though the lingo and affectations remain, its heart wasn’t in soundsystem culture: David longed to be an R&B star, and an American one at that. A chance meeting between David and Hill had led to an invite in 1998 for the singer to make use of Hill’s rudimentary studio and develop material of his own. Outside of its singles, which received extra polish once management entered the fray, most of the songs on Born to Do It are demos from those sessions that never required a further mixdown. Very little of the album’s beats can lay claim to originality: the pizzicato string plucks, synth bass, and Darkchild-style harp ripples all derive from sample packs, dutifully assembled as if by manual. Hill knew how to mask deficiencies in his setup, including using the smack of a bouncing basketball from the BBC Sound Effect Library to give the bass on some songs extra weight. (“Re-Rewind”’s glass shatter was at least done live in the studio, for that authentic breaking-and-entering feel.) The production might be standard fare in places, but that’s fine, because David is the star of this show, crooning his way to a world where he is the alpha shagger. Having grown up with the music of Terence Trent D’Arby and Michael Jackson, he understood how confidence could be distilled into a formula and bottled for mass consumption. All over Born To Do It are spirited imitations of silky-smooth loverman jams that made their way over the ocean in the late ’90s. A hat-tip to Usher’s “Nice & Slow” here, a little pre-chorus mention of “Gettin’ Jiggy With It” there, a few seconds of Busta Rhymes’ “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” spliced into “Time to Party”—and why not? His performance was brazen but no one told him to stop. With ""Booty Man,"" David interpolates the nursery rhyme “One, Two, Buckle My Shoe” and Willy Wonka's “Candy Man,” then spells out the URL to his homepage as if he were advertising a web 1.0 furniture sale. As “7 Days” slides into its final calendar-counting chorus, a warbling syllable soup pours forth, almost certainly recorded with the singer’s eyes closed and one hand tracing the notes through the air. And on “Can’t Be Messin’ Around,” a counterpart to Hill’s own hit “Please Don’t Turn Me On,” David remains chivalrous as he declines the advances of would-be suitors. Maneuvering around the dancefloor with his girlfriend on his mind, David still manages to drop a pick-up atom bomb: “Girl I must admit/You’re looking real fit”—the kind of line Mike Skinner would later latch onto with boozy glee as the Streets, delivered here with the fedora-doffing manners of a gentleman. Born To Do It is a binary-busting mesh of good and bad, corny to the point of inanity but with charisma to pull it off. At every turn, the Brit in him couldn’t help but leap out: an archetypal kind of chirpy student who cribs chat-up lines from lads mags and can do a wicked a cappella rendition of Soul II Soul’s “Back To Life” on cue; king of small and perhaps medium talk, but one who flounders when swimming out into deeper waters than that. Even while having a jacuzzi-and-wine tryst with the girl next door, he wonders if her parents “one day might approve?” People went wild. By 2001, with his home territory licked, it was time to crack North America. “7 Days” was an especial success, its PG-rated lyrics and clammy Latin flair perfect for a market still fat on the material gains of hits like Montell Jordan’s “Get It On Tonite” and Santana’s “Maria Maria.” The press were unconvinced, but he left a mark: Cup your ear to Drake’s 2007 mixtape cut “Closer” and hear him shout summers spent “Racin’ through the back streets/On my Craig David shit/The Artful Dodger, Shola Ama.” David was even invited by the Bush administration to perform at a White House concert. Glass eternally half-full, he accepted, though it never panned out. “I don’t know why it didn’t happen,” he later reflected. “I was doing something, I guess, and he was having a war.” While on this charm offensive, a dark cloud had rolled in over the sunny domain of UK garage. Rougher kids had entered the fray, typified by the sprawling collective So Solid Crew and associated bad-boy duo Oxide & Neutrino, bringing with them a genuine edge of danger. Committees—formal, mob-style sit-downs—had been set up as early as 1999 by older heads to settle disputes between rival promoters and feuding DJs. This time, their attempt to maintain stability failed. Paranoia took hold, shootings spiked, and the police rolled in heavy to stamp out the whole scene, treating UKG as a node of gangland activity. On the face of it, the pop phenom in a cream rollneck had nothing to do with any of this. If So Solid Crew were treated by the press as a local answer to NWA, then Craig David was MC Hammer. In an astonishingly patronizing skim-read of urban culture, members of the Labour government started parroting the term “gold chain and no brain” as they demonized UKG, which by this point was metamorphosing into grime anyway. David, never ashamed of an upbringing split between his Jewish-Anglo mother on the weekdays and his Grenadian father on the weekend, was being reduced to a set of faux-street catchphrases. The warning signs had been there: In late 2000, fading rockist rag Melody Maker published a cover declaring “UK Garage My Arse!”, calling for the sound to be outlawed and extending Born To Do It’s artwork to show a light-skinned black man who looked nothing like Craig David sitting on the toilet. The racial overtones weren’t exactly subtle. David led the field at the BRIT Awards in 2001, but he missed out on all six of his nominations, a failing greeted with barely suppressed mirth. Dane Bowers, one of commercial UKG’s other prominent faces, somehow managed to get changed into a T-shirt declaring “Craig Woz Robbed” in time for the afterparty. In 2002, an absurdist comedy called Bo Selecta! debuted on British television, its title taken from the call-and-response of “Re-Rewind.” This was the killer blow. At the show’s center lay a masked, mishap-prone version of Craig David featuring a doodled-on goatee and a hammed-up Northern English brogue that would be equivalent to giving Jerry Seinfeld a Down South drawl. The caricature was nothing like its target, yet withering all the same. His manager would explode in vein-popping rage any time it was invoked as an excuse for swooning sales. No matter how hard he had fought to escape the orbit of the garage world that had launched him, Bo Selecta! pulled David right back. David attempted to stare down the critics on the opener to his second album, 2002’s Slicker Than Your Average. He jettisoned any remnants of Hill’s 2-step signature, bragged about seven million records sold, and nabbed the standing-up gag from “The Real Slim Shady”—just two and a half years late. It was the outlier on an otherwise anodyne album, a gloop of Sting duets, club scenarios where the girls “bang like Dre instrumentals,” and, lessons unlearned, another nursery rhyme. Just one year after the U.S. release of Born To Do It, Slicker slunk in at No.32; the third LP was never released Stateside at all. The dream was over. To David’s credit, he at least managed to make his wilderness years memorable: He moved to Miami, got ripped, donned a watch whose face displayed only the word “NOW,” and spouted silly things in pursuit of profundity that kept him ticking over as a He Said What?! paragon of washed-up celeb. In the mid-2010s, another satirical show trained its lens on UK garage. People Just Do Nothing was centered around Kurupt FM, a bunch of pirate-radio wannabes in the armpit of suburban London, clinging to a faded blueprint for success. This time the series’ creators were genuine UKG diehards who wanted to bring it back as much as send it up. The show’s parodies were so acute, it provoked many to confront a dormant question: So what if the culture around garage can be daft? This was a national heritage too pure to be smuggled away as a guilty pleasure; UK garage should make us proud to be British. Come September 2015, a Kurupt FM-fronted radio takeover on BBC 1Xtra secured a major coup: Craig David would drop in for a live PA. In a clearly unrehearsed moment, you can barely hear “Fill Me In” above screams of joy as the show’s cast breaks character and mobs the returning prodigal son. David then glides into a freestyle over Jack Ü’s “Where Are Ü Now” with some typically wink-nudge lyrics—“Packin’ on muscle like bars of protein/Melodies for days, you know what I mean?”—but for once, people were laughing with him. The clip went supernova online. David had a simple message on social media: “This is what I live for.” Suddenly, impossibly, unstoppably, everything was coming up Craig. A record deal was inked off the back of the impromptu performance. Diplo ceded the stage at Major Lazer’s arena show in London toward the end of the year, letting David supplant Bieber and steal the thunder during his megasmash. By 2016, David was selling out arenas for his own comeback tour. Following My Intuition gave him his first No. 1 album since Born To Do It. The smirk on people’s faces had been replaced with an unforced smile. Watching Craig David at Glastonbury Festival 2017 was like witnessing a young Lionel Richie crossed with a high-rolling televangelist. Decked all in white, he sprinted across the stage with teenage vim, grinning wildly. After 20 minutes of armor-plated anthems, he announced he would give a little flava of his DJ origins—something no one was asking for. He wheeled out a stage riser with a laptop and a pair of decks, scatted over the Fugees, Eve, and House of Pain, and ended the set not with a hit, but with “16”: a recreation of that redemptive viral moment on the radio, freestyle and all, in case people had forgotten that he played the long game and won. No matter how close he danced to the edge of awfulness, how hard he tried to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, how much he willed us to walk away, the audience was there for him again. The anticipation when he took to the stage was choking. The assembled lunchtime crowd was larger than that for Radiohead the previous night: the size of a small city, stretching up and over the horizon. He took a breath and got straight into it. There was a lot to fill in.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Miss Colombia,Lido Pimienta,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e988b3b2eea7f00096658df/1:1/w_160/Miss%20Colombia_Lido%20Pimienta.jpg,2020-04-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lido-pimienta-miss-colombia/,Anti-,"When Lido Pimienta recorded her first EP, Color, in 2010, her then-husband produced every track and refused to teach her how. It was, she said, “a way of keeping me dependent on him.” Nine years and one divorce later, Pimienta does things differently. She recorded the majority of Miss Colombia in her home studio, wrote and arranged each song herself, and co-produced the album with fellow Torontonian Prince Nifty. The result is a staggering exhibition of her skill as a singer, songwriter, and shit-stirrer. Pimienta came to mainstream attention in 2017, when her debut LP La Papessa won the Polaris Prize, Canada’s highest musical honor. Self-released, funded by a $6,000 Ontario Arts Council grant, and nominated alongside albums by Leonard Cohen, Gord Downie, and Feist, La Papessa was the definition of a dark horse. Despite the global boom of reggaetón and cumbia, Latin genres remain critically underrepresented in Canadian music. Little wonder, then, that Pimienta’s Polaris victory, and her calls for “brown girls to the front,” rankled the alt-right. Named after Steve Harvey’s gaffe at the 2015 Miss Universe contest, Miss Colombia is Pimienta’s symbolic reclamation of her crown in an industry fraught with racism and misogyny. Crafted with deep passion and careful attention to detail, the record sounds like the full realization of a long-held dream, made possible at last by a wider platform and a bigger budget. Its palette is warmer, richer, and more reliant on traditional Colombian instrumentation than the chilly “digi-cumbia” (a label she shuns) of La Papessa. Pimienta places herself within a starry constellation of guests, including Colombian icons Sexteto Tabala and Bomba Estéreo’s Li Saumet, and outshines them all. These 11 songs form a full-throated declaration of mastery, all the more impressive for Pimienta’s insistence on prioritizing Afro-Colombian rhythms and instruments in an overwhelmingly white musical landscape. Sung almost entirely in Spanish, Miss Colombia conveys rage and solidarity more than chipper positivity. Pimienta often writes from the perspective of someone who has drunk deep from the poisonous wells of misogyny and racism. The funereal dirge “Nada” is an early, devastating exercise in this mode. Its narrator, a woman scorned, says that she does not fear death: “Soy mujer y llevo, el dolor adentro.” (“I’m a woman and carrying pain is what I do.”) On “Pelo Cucu,” a eugenics allegory à la Ham’s Redemption, a mother yearns for her “nappy-haired” daughter to marry a “niño blanco, de pelo bueno… pa mejorar la raza.” (“A white boy with that good hair… to improve our race.”) By laying hatred bare, in plain, unadorned language, Pimienta deftly exposes how people vulnerable to bigotry often absorb that bigotry, replicate it, and hurt others like themselves. The self-loathing in these songs is made all the more poignant by Pimienta’s irrepressible confidence. She refuses to rescue any more immature partners (“Coming Thru”), relaxes after escaping an emotional vampire (“Te Queria”), and rallies her listeners to fight anyone who makes them feel small (“Resisto Y Ya”). There is a pleasant, slippery ambiguity in these songs. On one level, Pimienta is recollecting intimate relationships; on another, she’s calling entire countries to task for their failure to protect black and brown women. Both Canada and her native Colombia are on the receiving end of her blistering critiques. Still, she’s optimistic about a future where she can live in these countries free from harm. “Ya llegó la oportunidad,” she sings on “Quiero Que Me Salves,” “para arreglar nuestro pasado.” (“The chance has arrived to fix our past.”) She might be singing to a lover; she might be singing to a head of state. In the three years since the Polaris Prize’s early vote of confidence, Pimienta has ably realized her potential and silenced those who doubted her deservingness. She has opened herself up both to collaboration and to mentorship, working with aspiring indigenous musicians and fundraising for Fuerza de Mujeres Wayuu. She is still an extreme rarity in Canadian music: an Afro-Colombian queer woman with indigenous Wayuu heritage, a single mother, a Spanish speaker. The great promise of Miss Colombia, and of her new leadership in a predominantly white scene, is that brown girls will hear it and be inspired to surge to the front.","The Colombian and Canadian musician’s second album is a symbolic reclamation of her crown.

Safe (Exits),Bryce Hackford,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e99d494b1cd0e00081a751b/1:1/w_160/bryce.jpg,2020-04-18 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bryce-hackford-safe-exits/,Spring Theory,"The six songs on Bryce Hackford’s 2013 debut album, Fair, could have been mistaken for the work of as many different artists. One loop-heavy house track evoked Moodymann; a fuzzy techno piece riffed on the Field; a song for drum machine, falsetto vocals, and slapback delay might as well have been Arthur Russell cosplay. Taken together, the album felt like a map of divergent paths, as though Hackford couldn’t bear to leave any route unexplored. On Safe (Exits), Hackford’s restlessness leads him to try his hand at collage, which turns out to be the perfect medium for a musician who tends to prefer and to or. The album encapsulates the best aspects of his magpie tendencies, avoiding the clutter that has sometimes plagued his work. Hackford gathered the album’s raw materials during a residency at the UK’s PRAH Foundation, a recording studio and creative hub in Margate, a seaside town some 90 minutes outside London. (The studio is an extension of PRAH Recordings, a small independent label whose most famous signee is the cellist Oliver Coates.) There, Hackford recorded contributions from 11 different instrumentalists, with one catch: He recorded all 11 musicians independently of one another, without any of them hearing the others’ parts, and then reworked choice bits and pieces of their playing into a coherent whole. The result is an appealingly loose, rangy record with a deep funk pulse, one that wraps a motley array of sounds—airy woodwinds, scuffed-up electric bass, mercurial Rhodes soloing—around Hackford’s skeletal, and often idiosyncratic, drum programming. The pacing is patient; the record opens with the 13-minute-long “Einmal,” a slow-motion approximation of ’00s minimal techno played mostly on acoustic percussion and overlaid with scraps of jazz. Flute, clavinet, and pitch-bending synths float in and out; it sounds less like a jam session than time-lapse footage of a house party. Their combined movements feel unplanned, but there’s a rhythm to the randomness. The first half mostly sticks to this mode of woozily controlled chaos. In “Fetish Present,” a lumpy drum-machine groove fights its way through a curtain of bells; “Zajal” is slow and atonal, its synths the color of an oil slick. Halfway through, a saxophone wafts into the frame, conjuring ’80s noir visions. “Holy Mountains” gently weaves contrapuntal lines in a way that suggests a chopped-and-screwed version of the Australian improvising trio the Necks, while “Deep Voices” takes a hard left into dubby post-punk. Throughout, the influence of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew looms large in the music’s freeform drift and inky dissonance. The album peaks with “After Sun,” a 14-minute meditation for Rhodes and synthesizer. It’s the record’s most successful fusion of groove, melody, and mood, but the final two cuts flesh out the picture of Hackford’s work in intriguing ways. Both are ambient in form and feel, extensions of the kinds of immersive, long-form pieces he’s been experimenting with since his first album. “Coast (Maybe)” arrays plaintive synth pads over white-noise hiss, while the even simpler “Harbor” sets dubbed-out Rhodes keys against a faint backdrop of street noise and the occasional seagull. Rather than a painstaking collage, it feels like someone sitting down at the keyboard in real time, poking idly at the keys for a quarter of an hour. On an album informed by others’ contributions, this contemplative closing makes for a welcome moment of solitude.","The New York-based electronic musician tries his hand at collage in an appealingly loose, rangy record that's ideally suited to his magpie tendencies.

Fetch the Bolt Cutters,Fiona Apple,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e98fd8b34830c0008097f47/1:1/w_160/FIONAAPPLECOVER.jpg,2020-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters/,Epic,"It happens to most of us at an early age: the realization that life will not follow a straight line on the path towards fulfillment. Instead, life spirals. The game is rigged, power corrupts, and society is, in a word, bullshit. Art can expose the lies. The early music of Fiona Apple was so much about grand betrayals by inadequate men and the patriarchal world. Did it teach you to hate yourself? Did it teach you to bury your pain, to let it calcify, to build a gate around your heart that quiets the reaches of your one and only voice? Fetch the bolt cutters. Fiona Apple’s fifth record is unbound. No music has ever sounded quite like it. Apple recorded Fetch the Bolt Cutters both in and with her Venice Beach home, banging on its walls, stomping on its ground. Self-reliance is its rule, curiosity is its key. Fetch the Bolt Cutters seems to almost completely turn the volume down on music history, while it cranks up raw, real life—handclaps, chants, and other makeshift percussion, in harmony with space, echoes, whispers, screams, breathing, jokes, so-called mistakes, and dog barks. (At least five dogs are credited: Mercy, Maddie, Leo, Little, and Alfie.) All of this debris orbits around the core of Apple’s music: her voice, her piano, and most of all her words, which have always been her primary instrument. It creates a wild symphony of the everyday. In the past, Apple has said John Lennon was her god, and she wrote lyrics and melodies on par with the finest pop songs ever recorded. But Fetch the Bolt Cutters feels more conceptually akin to the revolutionary risk-taking of saint Yoko Ono—a woman who once wrote, “I like to fight the establishment by using methods that are so far removed from establishment-type thinking that the establishment doesn’t know how to fight back.” Fetch the Bolt Cutters does something similar. It contains practically no conventional pop forms. Taken together, the notes of its found percussion and rattling blues are liberationist. Apple was moving towards all of this with 2012’s The Idler Wheel. Even after the fury and eloquence of her initial three-album run—manifestos from a voice of disenchantment who knew even as a teenager that she was “too smart” for the world—Idler Wheel still felt like a breakthrough. It was the first Apple record to realize the breadth of her potential in the ecstatic reach of the music itself. On the corporeal “Daredevil,” she sang of “gashes” that gave her “lift.” But on Fetch the Bolt Cutters she calls the gashes out by name: “bullies,” “it girls,” “wannabes,” and, above all, toxic masculinity. Apple said, in a recent profile in The New Yorker, that she worried she’d constructed “a record that can’t be made into a record,” but that shakiness was merely a symptom of a feat of total abandon. The whole album flies. The opening song, “I Want You to Love Me” seems to offer a thesis for the meaning of life: to love, to connect, to get “back in the pulse.” She sings, scats, lightly raps—and proceeds to curl her voice into an extended-vocal contortion à la Yoko or Meredith Monk, over a Reichian piano loop, signaling an avant-garde inclination. Apple sings about time and meaninglessness, and how “while I’m in this body I want somebody to want.” She sings about knowing that one day she will die. The song echoes the beautiful open letter she wrote in 2012 about her dog, Janet, who was then dying: “I know that I will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her [...] in the last moments.” Apple reportedly “tapped” on a box containing Janet’s bones during the recording of the album. There is a tendency among songwriters, as they get older, to refine—to use fewer words to allow for easier melodies. But to refine is to reel back, to withdraw. Apple does the opposite, reimagining her music to accommodate even more words, more of herself: “You’ve got to get what you want/How you want it/But so do I,” she sings on “Drumset,” grasping at every self-determined syllable. A number of Fetch the Bolt Cutters’ rough-hewn tracks sound like they might collapse at any moment, only to pick themselves up with a smirk of cool relief. The incantatory “Relay” includes a fluttering ambient noise jam recalling no one so much as O.G. punk band the Slits. Across four distinct movements, the madcap “For Her” pivots from a cabaret tune to a march to a swooping blues ballad to a one-woman choir of antagonizing angels. It is the definition of uncompromising. Apple’s indictments of men are also cutting as ever—“Your face ignites a fuse to my patience,” goes “Cosmonauts”—but her vulnerabilities are more daring, too. In a single word, her voice can dive from a ragged scream to a whisper so intimate that it barely exists outside of her. Fetch the Bolt Cutters can threaten the status quo and it can be outrageously funny, often at once. The long-reigning queen of self-isolation proclaims, “I told you I didn’t want to go to this dinner,” to open a song called “Under the Table,” as in: “Kick me under the table all you want/I won’t shut up.” “Rack of His” turns the experience of, well, getting played by a musician, into something hysterically subversive: “Check out that rack of his/Look at that row of guitar necks,” she daydreams, before cutting to the quick: “I thought you would wail on me like you wail on them.” And on “Relay,” after listing off a series of things she resents about an ex, she offers a critique of our hyper-socially-mediated world so savage it practically demands a standing ovation: “I resent you for presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure.” With her humor comes a playfulness that is still genuinely disarming to hear from a woman who wrote a song about herself and titled it “Sullen Girl.” The title track, and the album’s peak, is a work of musical bildungsroman, like a teenage girl’s diary, detailing the futility of fighting your way through a friendship, crying, and the secret power of a Kate Bush song. Apple sings of how the cool girls in school damaged her self-esteem, how the strength of your mind does not guarantee the fortitude of your heart. The energy centers of the song are reversed—the verses slink with gravity, the choruses are steadied and light. “Fetch the bolt cutters,” Apple sings like a spell, “I’ve been in here too long.” She has always strung words together like armor, but “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” feels designed to protect us. However you interpret it, the line, the song, and the album speak the language of transcendence. In 1996, on “The Child Is Gone,” Apple alluded to how the world can disconnect us from ourselves: “I’m a stranger to myself.” On “Fetch the Bolt Cutters,” Apple narrates this experience, reclaims it, and resists it—a revolt against the very idea of being controlled. Fetch the Bolt Cutters includes Apple’s first songs discernibly addressed to other women. “Shameika” also chronicles her formative years by way of a pep talk to herself and an ode to the middle-school classmate who emboldened her with only a few fleeting words: “Shameika said I had potential.” The torchy barroom burner “Ladies” is an anti-jealousy anthem and it is pure comic genius. “Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! Ladies!” Apple toasts, imploring the new girlfriend of her ex-boyfriend to “please be my guest!” to whatever she may have left in the back of his kitchen cupboards and bathroom cabinets: “There’s a dress in the closet/Don’t get rid of it/You look good in it/I didn’t fit in it/It was never mine/It belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine.” Fetch the Bolt Cutters is full of audacious scenes like this, where Apple narrates, in vivid detail, experiences we just don’t typically hear in songs. This is all in keeping with the feminist reckoning that has swept through culture in a post-#MeToo society. But Fetch the Bolt Cutters is never didactic, even on (the potentially triggering) “For Her,” which Apple wrote in the wake of the shameful Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings. For an artist whose early career existed under an all-seeing male eye, Apple wrote the song “Newspaper” from an unmistakable female gaze. In its lyrics, she feels “close” to another woman due to their shared past with an abusive man, as she observes his cruelty and lies from a distance. It’s a nuanced way of addressing a systemic problem. “It’s a shame because you and I didn’t get a witness,” she sings, but this song makes us all one, as do the brutal lyrics of “For Her.” “You know you should know but you don’t know what you did,” she sings, and later: “You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in.” This is another side of Fiona Apple. It is not easy to sing along. But it demands that you listen. She calls men out for refusing to show weakness, for treating their wives badly, for needing women to clean up their messes. Where The Idler Wheel explored a form of self-interrogation—“I’m too hard to know,” she crooned—on Fetch the Bolt Cutters, she unapologetically indicts the world around her. And she rejects its oppressive logic in every note. The very sound of Fetch the Bolt Cutters dismantles patriarchal ideas: professionalism, smoothness, competition, perfection—aesthetic standards that are tools of capitalism, used to warp our senses of self. Where someone else might erase a mistake—“Oh fuck it!” she chuckles on “On I Go”—she leaves it in. Where someone might put a bridge, she puts clatter. Where she once sang, “Hunger hurts but starving works,” here, in the devouring chorus of “Heavy Balloon,” she screams: “I spread like strawberries/I climb like peas and beans.” There is nothing top-down about the sound of Fetch the Bolt Cutters. “She wanted to start from the ground,” her guitarist David Garza told The New Yorker. “For her, the ground is rhythm.” There’s considerable power in how Apple entertains so many of these wild, inexhaustible impulses. “Don’t you, don’t you, don’t you, don’t you shush me!” she chips back on “Under the Table.” She will not be silenced. That’s patently clear from the start of Fetch the Bolt Cutters. In gnarled breaths on its opening song—feet on the ground and mind as her might—Apple articulates exactly what she wants: “Blast the music! Bang it! Bite it! Bruise it!” It’s not pretty. It’s free.

Garden of Lucid,Ambar Lucid,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e949b92936cf300086dad7c/1:1/w_160/Garden%20of%20Lucid_Ambar%20Lucid.jpg,2020-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ambar-lucid-garden-of-lucid/,self-released,"Ambar Lucid is 19, but she’s already lived through her father’s deportation, the naysayer who told her no one would listen to her music if it was in Spanish, and the move to Los Angeles to pursue that music anyway. Garden of Lucid, her defiant debut album, exudes confidence and experience. Her style of R&B is mystical and moody, a supernatural dream for anyone seeking to better understand the world and their place in it. It all builds to an image of a young woman who understands who she is and wants everyone else to understand, too. Because it’s tricky being a teenage girl. You’re either too much like a woman or too much like a child, always making other people uncomfortable or feeling uncomfortable yourself. As a teen in charge of her own art, Lucid shares her life without shame. “I belong to the universe/I don’t belong to anyone else,” she sings on “Universe,” a glittery, groovy song with a bassline like Tame Impala for girls who own tarot cards. Such trite lyrical moments serve as reminders that Lucid is a new adult—or put differently, they’re testaments to her earnestness. On “Story to Tell,” she sings plainly, “My art was awkward for you to tell,” and then, “Farewell.” On “Garden,” she adopts the same kind of droopy guitar loop you might hear in emo rap, with an indulgent, sinister vocal delivery to match. “Welcome to the garden,” Lucid sings, like she’s the ringleader of a weird dreamland circus. But then she says something unexpectedly sympathetic: “Please don’t be disheartened/Once you perceive insincerity,” dipping in and out of Spanish from there. Her voice is decadent, forming crystalline falsettos on “Cuando” and cutting through piano on “Shades of Blue.” She goes low and high, a vocal acrobat. It’s easy to hear the imprint of Odd Future associates like Kali Uchis and Steve Lacy on this album; Lucid has named both as influences. She shares their sense of darkness, lavishing in wonky, washed-out guitar, sticky basslines, and fuzzy background vocals. It’s alternative R&B with a wink, something always left a little strange. Yet Lucid’s lush, sweeping vocal performances and the assertive, spiritual self-compassion in her lyrics stand out from the rest of Odd Future’s disciples. She translates the anxious beauty of an artist like Lil Peep into a focused pain. You don’t often hear Spanish in the lyrics of an American artist making this sort of grungy R&B, which reaffirms that Lucid is no one’s token anything. For a generation of immigrants’ children, hearing Lucid, a 19-year-old girl with a Dominican mother and Mexican father, so easily integrate her culture with her musical identity feels like a personal homecoming. When I was younger, I never knew exactly how I felt about my own immigrant parents. I envied other neighborhood kids, the ones whose families were all-white, all-American, and uncomplicated. High school friends told me that I was white, even though my dad was from Bangladesh. Eventually, I stopped protesting—sure, I was white, too. Not until I was older did I realize how much denying my background severed me from my identity. On Garden of Lucid, the multifaceted teenage girl has control of her own narrative. Lucid is a burgeoning Latinx American pop star; her music is strange and luminous, sometimes in English and sometimes in Spanish, and almost always about herself. It tells everyone that immigrant kids are complicated and idiosyncratic, never conforming to the image that others (our parents, our neighbors) want to project on us. There’s no attempt to pander, to sing the kind of story about the tragedy or triumph of immigration that white Americans love to hear. Everyone is always telling teenagers what to do, but Lucid isn’t looking for help. She’s just waiting for everyone else to catch up.","The 19-year-old singer’s debut exudes confidence and experience.

In Another Life,Active Child,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90d8a21a3ea30008764f17/1:1/w_160/In%20Another%20Life_Active%20Child.jpg,2020-04-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/active-child-in-another-life/,Sony Masterworks,"On In Another Life, Active Child’s Pat Grossi offers cinematic strings, surging choral harmonies, and his dazzling harp as a kind of spiritual balm, a respite from the harsh outside world. Frequently, his new album sounds like church music (which comes as no surprise, given his roots as a choir boy). On the anthemic album closer, he urges us to “Hold your head up/Even though it’s a cruel world.” But Grossi never fully introduces the conflict or cruelty of that world into the realm of his compositions—there is no ugliness here, only affirmation, and sounds as pristine as the upholstering on the album cover. This is the Pasadena-based musician’s first release in five years, and his major-label debut for Sony. In a note shared to Twitter, he alluded to the fact that this release had been “with me for too long really”; he also mentions that he began composing it after the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015. These attacks were perhaps the impetus for the soothing, sympathetic offerings on In Another Life like “Cruel World,” and “Brighter Day,” though Grossi also cites death and the birth of his daughter as songwriting inspirations. The loosely circling themes feel almost irrelevant; the textures are what’s most striking. Grossi has largely ditched the soft-rock sheen of his 2015 album Mercy, returning to full-bodied strings and choral chamber-pop dotted with electronic flourishes. When he’s in this mode, Active Child sounds glorious. But perhaps even more impactful than the grandiose moments are the lower, more somber offerings. “Spirit Buoy” is a showcase for his delicate double-tracked vocal and harp, while he delivers a horror movie-worthy distorted vocal in his trembling higher register on “Color Me,” the record’s only thrillingly discordant moment. On lead single “Weightless,” the percussive hand claps resound viscerally in your eardrums and the dam-bursting strings lead to a dramatic payoff that feels earned. Elsewhere, Grossi creates moments of bombast that fall flat because of the platitudes at their center. “Weightless” is followed by “Brighter Day,” a dusky track that urges its listeners to “Love one another/Help your brother/Lean on each other.” These cliches are met with no tension; as with the sunny “keep your head up” hook on “Cruel World,” they shimmer earnestly over a bed of powerful drums and Hollywood strings, offering nothing but uplift for uplift’s sake. Grossi often hints at shadows in his lyrics, but shies away from looking directly at the objects casting these shadows. On “In Another Life,” he sings that we’re surrounded by “something bigger”; on “Cruel World,” he dedicates himself to “something richer,” but in both instances he swerves away from specificity. There’s a hollowness to this worship, though Grossi plugs the gap with distractingly beautiful arrangements. It is an unmistakably lovely record, which is occasionally stifled by its own loveliness.","On his first release in five years and his major-label debut, Pat Grossi offers his cinematic anthems as a sort of spiritual balm.

Varispeed Hydra,Evan Caminiti,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94ccdcecfafc0008428b58/1:1/w_160/Varispeed%20Hydra_Evan%20Caminiti.jpg,2020-04-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/evan-caminiti-varispeed-hydra/,Dust Editions,"Until the early 2010s, Evan Caminiti recorded towering drones in the Thrill Jockey duo Barn Owl with Jon Porras, conjuring images of grim skies over endless plains using a spartan two-guitar setup. In recent years, he’s broadened his instrumental palette and shifted his focus to urban landscapes. After Meridian’s focus on modular synthesizer, 2017’s Toxic City Music reintroduced guitar, often processed beyond recognizability, to create an oil-slick reflection of New York. That album felt like a breakthrough, balancing smog-belching industrial textures with hypnotic grooves that were threatening yet seductive. That grayscale sonic metropolis expands on Varispeed Hydra, where new stylistic alleyways lead Caminiti to fading remnants of the natural world. Some of the first sounds you hear on opener “Hand in Flame” are the cries of birds fluttering distantly above the murky low-end churn. They’re a consistent natural presence throughout Varispeed Hydra, but Caminiti uses these and other natural accents, like the water rushing through “Holo Dove,” to amplify his polluted electroacoustic atmospheres. Like the dense assemblages of Tim Hecker or Jefre-Cantu Ledesma (who appeared on Toxic City Music), Caminiti’s sounds are impossible to pick apart, but as his melted-together blend envelops the listener, inky patterns begin to appear. Some arrive in torrents, such as “Plume,” where a heavy ringing guitar tone rises and crashes in increasingly distorted waves. Others offer an eerie calm, like the bruised synth delicately looping through “Russian Palm”; “For Mika” opens with a jangling insect-like trill before revealing the ghostly echo of a club track buried under mountains of delay. That track in particular offers a pathway into Varispeed Hydra’s most exciting qualities. Caminiti’s first experiments with techno and dub music go back to the final Barn Owl albums, and Varispeed Hydra reconnects with club music in surprising ways. The grim “Radio Rome” and the laser-dappled “Morphogenesis” recall the icy experimental dub of UK producers like Parris. And much like Helm’s similarly nature-defiling Chemical Flowers, Caminiti’s album loops textures in ways that generate absorbing rhythms without necessarily creating beats. The album was inspired by performances at both the Tokyo nightclub Dommune and New York’s Issue Project Room, a haven for experimental music, and its ability to bridge those very different environments is one of its biggest strengths. Part of what makes Varispeed Hydra so potent is its relative brevity. Both the dramatic shifts and recurring sounds gain power over the album’s 35-minute span, but they stop short of overwhelming the listener. Caminiti seems aware of the momentum he’s creating as each track pulls you to the next; like a good improviser, he knows when to set up an ending. The closer, “Carnation,” reaches a surreal equilibrium: The synths flare like jazz horns, and the birds circle back. It’s an elegant finish, right down to the abrupt, plug-pulling cut to silence. Caminiti has developed a labyrinthine sound, and navigating it makes Varispeed Hydra a mysterious and enticing listen.","The Los Angeles musician, formerly of Barn Owl, fuses synthesizers and processed guitar into ominous, inky atmospheres that bridge experimental music and ambient dub.

Songs for Pierre Chuvin,The Mountain Goats,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94971d1a3ea30008764f25/1:1/w_160/Songs%20for%20Pierre%20Chuvin_The%20Mountain%20Goats.jpg,2020-04-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-mountain-goats-songs-for-pierre-chuvin/,Merge,"John Darnielle’s music has arrived so steadily and with such consistency that the changes the Mountain Goats have undergone can feel secondary to his own growth as a writer. Over the last three decades, a project with the loneliest of origins—a man at home with an acoustic guitar, a primitive tape recorder, and a pinched, inimitable voice—has grown into a full band with their own distinctive and expanding sound. Their albums from the past 10 years have seen an increased focus on the musicians around him: longtime bassist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster, multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, and collaborators that have ranged from a men’s choir to a metal producer, a symphony orchestra and a horn section. You could imagine a trajectory in which Darnielle blends deeper into this foreground, exploring how each new embellishment affects the cadence of his rich, referential storytelling. This was the plan as recently as a month ago, when the quartet gathered to work on the follow-up to 2019’s lush In League With Dragons. But as the effects of COVID-19 made it impossible to continue recording together, and as the material Darnielle prepared began to feel at odds with the escalating news cycle, he returned home and changed plans. In his bedroom, during 90-minute breaks away from his family, he wrote one new song a day, all inspired by A Chronicle of the Last Pagans, a dense text published in 1990 by the French historian Pierre Chuvin. For the sake of immediacy—and maybe familiarity—he recorded each song on the Panasonic RX-FT500 boombox that documented his earliest compositions. This very boombox, purchased in the late ’80s, served as Darnielle’s first essential collaborator, its harsh, unrelenting whirr once inseparable from his songwriting. It was so integral that a portion of his devoted fan base felt betrayed when he signed to 4AD after 2002’s classic All Hail West Texas and took to professional studios, adopted cleaner textures, and, eventually, recruited a band. For this contingent of fans, his new album, Songs for Pierre Chuvin, might signal a long-awaited return to form; it is a brief but thoughtful collection marked by old-school production, deep allusions to his songbook, and performances that could be placed among those early pillars. Yet it doesn’t feel like pandering. Despite the familiar sound and old-world setting (4th and 5th century, to be exact), these songs never look back for too long. They feel like another step forward. Over the years, Darnielle has become increasingly adept at summarizing the disparate worldviews of his characters in catchy, unlikely refrains. As with everything he puts to tape, there are a couple here that you could sing along with by the time the second verse starts. The chorus of the opening song, “Aulon Raid,” sets the tone: “We will deeeeal with you/Me and my paaaa-gan crew.” These observations from a collapsing society are at turns hopeful, wistful, and enraged. Alone, Darnielle takes audible delight in finding the right backdrop for each story, from the Casio hum of “The Wooded Hills Along the Black Sea” to the terse grind of “Until Olympius Returns.” Even if you have never been a member of a small community fearing extinction—say, ancient pagans at the hands of Christians, or lo-fi purists bemoaning a more polished technique—his words ring with righteous purpose. Amid the social distancing and mass cancellations of the past month, I had already been thinking about Darnielle’s music. His catalog is filled with odes to the small communities we build for ourselves: the divine congregations at rock concerts (“Satanic Messiah”) and wrestling matches (2015’s Beat the Champ); among people with similar dependencies (2004’s We Shall All Be Healed) and fashion choices (2017’s Goths). He has also written from pockets of deep isolation. His quiet 2006 album Get Lonely is devoted entirely to this subject, with an opening track that spends its runtime contemplating the inherent danger of leaving the house. Pierre Chuvin finds its place among these desperate stories. “Return the peace you took from me/Give me back my community,” he sings late in the album. In another song, a character casts a skeptical eye from his hillside exile: “Sometimes forget there’s cities down there,” he chants in a matter-of-fact verse, his tone somewhere between self-sufficiency and total alienation. In moments like these, Darnielle’s writing feels newly political and wide-reaching, a comforting shift from the more insular narratives of his last few concept albums. But he closes the record with a nod to his own mythology. On the climactic “Exegetic Chains,” Darnielle expresses gratitude for the faithful grind of his boombox and repurposes the chorus of his signature song: “Make it through this year,” he urges in a near-whisper, “if it kills us outright.” It’s the echo of a message that’s often shouted through tears at the end of his shows: a personal mantra turned outward, an old prayer sung like intimate advice. This, he suggests, is how we might get by. When he started writing songs, recording to tape was a necessity: a quick, inexpensive way to document his thoughts. Now it’s a gesture of faith. The proceeds from this release go to his bandmates and crew, the people who count on his work for income. The initial run sold out in minutes; it’s currently in its third pressing. He wants to make sure the people who need it can hear it, that they can hold it in their hands.","Recording on the same boombox that launched his career, John Darnielle returns to his lo-fi roots for an album of alienation, ancient pagans, and making it through the year together.

Along the way, his music has become sunnier and more melodic, while his songwriting, which has veered at times into the deeply depressive, has grown increasingly pared down and positive. EXETER is Bladee’s third studio album and the first time he’s worked significantly with Gud, the Sad Boys producer and close Yung Lean collaborator. Bladee has always had range—even on his first album, aggressive songs like “Rip” lived alongside ballads like “Skin”—but, here, he pushes even further towards blissful pop and strips down his lyrics to their most minimal extreme. The album’s intro, “MIRROR (HYMN),” serves as a blueprint for his approach. Over twinkling ascending notes, he repeats three phrases—“Mirror in the way,” “Follow all the way,” and “Window in the way”—in a circular pattern before adding something more concrete: “Ego in the way/I go all the way/I’m not in the way.” On “MERRY-GO-ROUND,” he examines the cycles of life, striking a satisfying balance between simple writing and catchy melody. But his less-is-more approach starts to feel hollow on “EVERY MOMENT SPECIAL,” a song with even simpler lyrics that consist of just two repeated phrases (“Every moment’s special, you make every moment special” and “Only one wish, baby, it has to be perfect”). Where the 18-minute project starts to feel shapeless, guest spots on “WONDERLAND” and “LOVESTORY” from Ecco2K, Bladee’s sweet-voiced Drain Gang compatriot, help anchor it. But it’s Gud’s production that glues the album together. Listening to the crinkly distortion effects on “RAIN3OW STAR (LOVE IS ALL)” with headphones on sounds like dialing out of the Matrix. More than ever before, Bladee uses his voice like another instrument and pays attention to blank space, allowing Gud’s sparkling melodies and muffled percussion to breathe. They meet perfectly on “DNA RAIN,” a glitchy, angelic song that’s a reminder of Bladee’s influence on the clipped vocal stylings of current internet darlings 100 gecs and the legion of artists that have already sprung up in their wake. Bladee’s music has always been about building alternate universes, and the one he creates with Gud on EXETER sounds like a warped version of Mario’s journey to save Princess Peach—but without a neat and predictable conclusion. Instead, he seems to be removing himself as much as possible and inviting listeners to grapple with their own interpretations. “I’m not special,” he emphasizes over and over on “OPEN SYMBOLS (PLAY) BE IN YOUR MIND.” For those that haven’t yet bought into Bladee, EXETER probably won’t be the turning point and, even among die-hard fans, it’s minimalism has already proven to be controversial. But it’s the sort of album that rewards you the closer you lean into it.","The enigmatic Swedish rapper strips back his hypnotic music until it’s nothing but AutoTuned crooning and chanted slogans.

Born Again,Ellis ,by: Emma Madden,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90e4e620b67c0009b3b2b0/1:1/w_160/Born%20Again_Ellis.jpg,2020-04-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ellis-born-again/,Fat Possum,"Hamilton, Ontario’s Linnea Siggelkow decided to learn guitar at age 12, when she saw the music video for Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated.” As the daughter of a piano teacher, it was her first departure from sheet music. When she began writing her own songs, she found herself drawn towards melancholy. That’s the mood that defines Ellis, the dream-pop project she started in her bedroom some four years ago. A series of early GarageBand demos attracted attention, earning her opening slots for Soccer Mommy and Palehound. Her debut LP, Born Again, is an opportunity to hear Ellis in her own right. But with sentimental lyrics and familiar emo-pop tropes—gentle guitar reverb, windswept synths, overblown crescendos—the album too often falls back on cliché. As the title suggests, Born Again charts Ellis’ disillusionment with her religious upbringing and its lingering effects on her state of mind. “In the pews I lost my hope/Where I was supposed to find it,” she sings in a soft, pining voice reminiscent of contemporaries like Nicole Dollanganger, Long Beard, and Tomberlin. She confesses to a shame “that I will carry ’til I’m dead,” but the feeling doesn’t grade into the music. There’s little specificity, nor much variation in mood, so that even songs with ambiguous, conflicted meanings are subsumed into echoey haze. The closing track takes a hopeful tone—“Had a dream I was a butterfly,” Ellis sings—but it relies on the same sparse guitar, synth overlay, and middle-eight upsurge as “Into the Trees,” a song about dysfunctional relationships and dread. When Ellis’ unique perspective does emerge, it offers beauty like “a brief gasp between one cliché and another,” in the words of Ezra Pound. “I thought I had found freedom/When I moved into the city/I was puking out the window/I was trying to be pretty,” she sings on the title track—an image so detailed and so arbitrary, it could only be her own. By contrast, lines like, “You’re the monster that still hides under my bed/You’re the words that I thought but never said” (from “Shame”) are so wholly reliant on cliché that there’s little hope of saying anything new. At other times, Ellis struggles to put words to her emotions. “I can’t explain the feeling,” she admits on “Happy”; “I don’t know why, I just feel like a mess,” she sings on “Into the Trees.” With nowhere else to go for emphasis or meaning, she simply gets louder, adding all-caps declarations of “I’m scared” that counteract the very feeling she wants to convey. Open-heartedness can act as a salve in an irony-hardened world, but the sweet kitsch of Born Again leaves little to latch onto. The songs are buttressed by predictable structures—soft, then bombastic, then soft again—with little room for surprise. The grungy, tuned-down guitar starts just when it’s expected; ditto the pitter-pattering drums and the starry synths that merge the other components together. All the soupy atmospherics wind up obscuring Ellis’ attempts at honest self-reflection. Uniformly and unashamedly sentimental, Born Again leaves too little to remember her by.","The Canadian songwriter’s full-length debut is sentimental and melancholy, allowing even songs with ambiguous, conflicted meanings to be subsumed into echoey haze.

Songs from The Golden One,Whitmer Thomas,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e909f1214d7100009d3fda5/1:1/w_160/whitmer.jpg,2020-04-16 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/whitmer-thomas-songs-from-the-golden-one/,Hardly Art,"At 18 years old, baby-faced skate punk Whitmer Thomas decided to chase a dream, moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Shortly after, tragedy struck: Thomas’ mother passed away due to complications from alcoholism. In her final moments, she dubbed her youngest son “the golden one,” which, Thomas notes in his debut HBO special of the same name, “was awkward, because my brother was standing right next to me.” The Golden One finds the now-30-year-old comedian returning to his hometown of Gulf Shores, Alabama to reckon with the unresolved familial trauma surrounding his mother’s death. Thomas filmed the special at the Flora-Bama Lounge, a beachside bar where his mother and her twin sister served as the house band under the name SynTwister, and he draws parallels between their artistic ambitions. Executive produced by Bo Burnham and co-directed by Thomas’ frequent collaborator Clay Tatum, The Golden One is one of the most unexpectedly moving comedy specials in recent memory and introduces Thomas, who has self-identified as a “pre-cum Jim Carrey,” as a bonafide star. Songs From the Golden One is a compilation of expanded versions of the songs Thomas performs in the one-hour show. Though the album is perhaps best experienced after watching the special for the sake of context, it also works as a collection of great standalone songs. It’s worth pointing out that Thomas was a musician before he was a comedian; When he was a kid his mother helped him learn his favorite Green Day songs and he later performed in a variety of emo and hardcore bands in Alabama. His imitation of Blink-182’s melodramatic angst is so skillful that he ended up playing in a one-night-only cover band with Mark Hoppus. Setting jokes to song ends painfully more often than not, but Thomas’ songwriting talent carries him through. Both Thomas’ comedy and music frequently go to dark places very quickly. The 10 songs on Songs From the Golden One cast him as a therapist’s pet project: he’s a codependent enabler laden with sexual performance anxiety and an abundance of trauma. But Thomas is self-aware, which saves his work from becoming self-pitying. “My identity is ‘my mother died’/Anything to distract from being straight and white,” he declares on opener “Hurts to Be Alive.” Though Thomas has a perfectly lovely natural singing voice, he tends to shift it down to the glowering, moody depths of Joy Division’s Ian Curtis or John Maus as a means of detachment. “Assuming the character of a rock’n’roll guy helps me get through it without having a meltdown,” he recently told AV Club with an uncomfortable chuckle. Perhaps Thomas’ greatest skill as a comic and musician is his ability to let the tragic and comedic coexist. The lyrics of “Partied to Death,” a song about the effect of his late mother’s addiction on his identity, are painfully blunt: “Mommy drank herself to death/I know she tried her very best/Now I can’t party because my mommy partied to death.” And yet, thanks to a bunch of MIDI effects and some AutoTune, the song becomes a morbid singalong. On “Dumb in Love,” which manages to evoke both “Strawberry Fields Forever”-era Beatles and landfill indie dance-punk, Thomas yearns for the blissful ignorance of a life unconcerned with the world at large. “Do I have to call my congressman?/I don’t even fucking know them…2016 didn’t affect me at all,” he sings with a snotty whine, sounding like a Peanuts character on MDMA. While the approach is obviously satirical—in The Golden One, Thomas performs this track after reminiscing about the often narrow-minded simplicity of Southern living—his delivery is earnest. “Hopes and Dreams,” a synthy surf-rock song about his father’s commitment to getting his act together and re-entering his sons’ lives, attests to the power of rehabilitation; It ends with the line “I hope my father knows he raised a little bitch,” just in case anyone was getting misty-eyed. The record’s understated highlight is the organ-driven “The Golden One,” a meditation on the comedian’s life. What Thomas sees is imperfect: a floundering, sentimental comedian with a broken car and an obsession with The Dark Knight. And yet, he manages to find something resembling acceptance in the cards he’s been dealt: “I wipe away the steam and look at me/I’m just no fun/My mother’s son.” Songs From the Golden One concludes with “He’s Hot,” a cover of SynTwister’s would-be hit about a staggeringly sexy stud. Thomas has said that he recently found the band’s original tapes and plans to remaster and release them as a means of giving his mom her long-overdue moment in the spotlight. With this moving tribute, Thomas hits home the heart of Songs From the Golden One: it’s a labor of love and reflection.","The comedian and musician’s breakthrough HBO special is full of songs about familial trauma that work just as well in an album format.

Negro,Pink Siifu,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90d39bac9e490008f40868/1:1/w_160/Negro_Pink%20Siifu.jpg,2020-04-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pink-siifu-negro/,self-released,"In 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., psychiatrists William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs wrote about the psychological toll of the moment. “People bear all they can, and if required, bear even more. But if they are black in present-day America they have been asked to shoulder too much. They have had all they can stand. They will be harried no more. Turning from their tormentors, they are filled with rage.” The words come from Black Rage, a text that remains potent nearly five decades later. “If racist hostility is to subside, and if we are to avoid open conﬂict on a nationwide scale, information is the most desperately needed commodity of our time. And of the things that need knowing, none is more important than that all blacks are angry.” These are the pillars upon which Alabama-born musician Pink Siifu presents NEGRO. Originally titled To Be Angry, the album siphons the repressed ire of Black America. “U are allowed to be angry,” he wrote in a description on Bandcamp. It is a bracing record that is at once crushing and liberating. NEGRO is about as bold a move as Pink Siifu could have made. It’s a dramatic sonic departure from his debut solo full-length, 2018’s lo-fi rap breakthrough ensley. The messages or politics won’t come as a shock to anyone who has paid close attention to his discography, but it is definitely gutsy to follow your most popular album with your most confrontational one. Siifu sounds nearly ready to explode. The album grabs from hardcore punk, free jazz, and noise music across songs that are fleeting and fervent; 14 of the 20 are under two minutes. In bursts, he performs in defense of looting, in opposition to police violence, and in support of black solidarity. Where ensley was nuanced and interior, NEGRO is intense and riotous. In a manifesto on the website negro.life, Siifu outlines the influences of NEGRO, some directly sampled, others a phantom presence in the room: Malcolm X, the proto-punk band Death, the Afrofuturist high priest Sun Ra, along with others like writer and activist Amiri Baraka and yogi MC Gonjasufi. This swirling mass of influence is palpable throughout and divergent songs like “.ON FIRE, PRAY!” and “Nation Tyme.” illustrate the vast scope and eclecticism of the project. Pink Siifu is a rapper, but there isn’t much “rapping” on NEGRO. (For anyone looking for that sort of thing, he released two projects at the end of 2019: Black Sand with Akai Solo and Bag Talk with Yungmorpheus.) Normally, Siifu raps like he’s trying to tell you something he doesn’t want anyone to overhear, but here, his mission is full guttural howling. On the Na-Kel Smith-assisted “Dirt,” he blurts out the verses as if through a megaphone, and “steal from the ENEMY” is a series of near-indecipherable grunts and squawks. NEGRO is best when Siifu’s fury is at its peak. The rumbling racket of “SMD” feels like hurtling toward a black hole. The heavy distortion of “homicide/genocide/ill die” scrubs away at you like a Brillo pad. The industrial rhythms of “bebe’s kids, APOLLO” feel like wandering into a rave at a Ford assembly plant. These songs attack the senses. Much of the album’s anger is aimed specifically at the police. “run pig run” and “Chris Dorner” take “copwatching” to the next level with fantasies of bringing the fight to them. “You have to shoot a pig, before they shoot you/Pig shoot, we shoot,” he yells on the former; in the latter, he references someone who did just that—the rampaging black officer who declared “unconventional and asymmetric warfare” on the LAPD before dying in a standoff. As if to preempt anyone who might dismiss these songs as “extreme,” there’s “ameriKKKa, try no pork.,” which opens with news clips from several racially motivated police murders before being washed out by white noise and an echoing news story of police violence warped beyond recognition. For many of us, this endless succession of incidents incites feelings of helplessness; NEGRO taps into our irrepressible desire to see a reckoning. The rage can be galvanizing, but it’s the expressions of tenderness between that have the most power—they are reminders that this frustration is merely a response to frequent injustice suffered at the hands of an oppressor, and that this is all in service of freeing a persecuted community. “we need mo color. Abundance” is hushed jazz with shimmering guitar in search of a less colorless world. The soulful “myheartHURT” is wedged between the most abrasive run of tracks like a reprieve. “Black Be Tha God, NEGRO. (wisdom.cipher),” which samples Eddie Kendricks’ enduring 1977 anthem “Intimate Friends,” is a dedication to the circle of family, friends, and collaborators from which Siifu draws his strength. This album couldn’t have been made without that community. The intro is dedicated to the late Los Angeles producer Ras G, who introduced him to Sun Ra. The Los Angeles rapper Zeroh mastered the album. Siifu credits Slauson Malone’s influence for the help with sequencing. Jeremiah Jae extends beyond his typical range as a beatmaker on the record, but still adds some of his signature flourishes. Roper Williams produces some of the album’s fiercest moments. Trumpeter Chris Williams pops in the margins. Producer Ted Kamal, self-proclaimed witch rapper Moor Mother, and theOGM, one half of punk-rap duo Ho99o9, all lend their voices to the maelstrom. Though rage is the most present thing, it is not the most important thing. By the end of the album, it is clear that the point is not the wrath but the bond shared by those expressing it. All blacks are angry. On NEGRO, there is some comfort to be found in experiencing that together.","The rapper’s second full-length is intense and riotous, tapping into the anger at the heart of Black America for an eclectic and captivating record.

Ever-Roving Eye,James Elkington,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94949a61bfa9000996ee88/1:1/w_160/Ever-Roving%20Eye_James%20Elkington.jpg,2020-04-15 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-elkington-ever-roving-eye/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Ever-Roving Eye, guitarist James Elkington’s second solo album, opens with a brief acoustic overture—a short melodic theme repeated just a few times, followed by a volley of deftly, delicately picked notes, barely a minute long altogether—that could be a holdover from his 2017 debut, the spare and thoughtful Wintres Woma. But then it’s interrupted by the sharp thwack of a snare drum from Spencer Tweedy, and “Nowhere Time” abruptly takes off in another direction: The tempo quickens, and Elkington’s acoustic is joined by a taut rhythm section and even an electric guitar tracing loops and spirals around his vocals. There’s a lot packed into that transition from solo to full band; it sets up one of Elkington’s most elaborate arrangements to date, allowing him to sound freer and looser than ever. It’s as if he’s trying to shed the expectations of folk guitar as a restrictive genre, one rooted deeply in the past. “Nowhere Time” sounds like Elkington and his small combo are more interested in the present. That moment also signals Elkington’s disparate musical influences. The intro is grounded in the stylings of UK folk players: the stateliness of John Renbourn, the directness of Davy Graham, the jazzy agility of John Martyn. But “Nowhere Time” is grounded in American soil—in particular Chicago, which Elkington has called home for some 20 years. After fronting the inventive indie-rock outfit the Zincs throughout most of the ’00s, he spent the ’10s entrenching himself in the local music scene and playing with pretty much everybody in town, including Jon Langford’s Skull Orchard, Eleventh Dream Day, and post-rock icons Tortoise as well as their offshoot Brokeback. He was the only member of Tweedy not named Tweedy. Lyrically, Elkington remains an eccentric songwriter, given to playful turns of phrase as ornate as they are cryptic. There’s a menagerie of animals roaming around Ever-Roving Eye, hyenas and leopards and wolves; at one point Elkington even declares himself a malamute. Such odd imagery doesn’t distract him from the mortal dread that seeps into these songs. Rather, it magnifies it, as though he’s staring down death with a chuckle. “You’ll be underground in no uncertain terms, and dozing with the worms,” he prophesies on “Nowhere Time.” “There’s a master plan somebody understands, and I wish that one was me.” The unstoppable passage of time is his primary theme, and he’s found an intriguing way of addressing it through his music: Ever-Roving Eye collapses time as Elkington combines elements from previous projects into his current folk palette, as though he’s playing in all the above groups all at once. That’s especially enlivening after Wintres Woma, whose combination of Albion folk and American Primitive occasionally sounded a little too tidy. The focus on that album was clearly on Elkington, but on Ever-Roving Eye he sounds more like a bandleader. These new songs savor a wider variety of sounds, like the prismatic strings and woodwinds that flutter just under the surface of “Tempering Moon,” or the pile-up of voices on the psychedelic title track. Even Elkington’s vocals, which don’t have the range or the texture of his playing, sound more commanding here. He devises new tricks of phrasing and layering on “Late Jim’s Lament” to complement the song’s pulse, rooting deep in his lower register like he’s digging into peat. In this setting, even a more straightforward folk instrumental like “Rendlesham Way,” written and recorded for Wintres Woma, sounds more pointed, more purposeful, maybe even pricklier—as though Elkington is pushing against some expectation he has for himself. Or, as he sings on “Nowhere Time,” “It is time for you to move. You’d better get somewhere to go.”","On the follow-up to his 2017 debut, the Chicago guitarist ventures beyond his folk roots, sounding looser and freer than ever. Despite the solo billing, he sounds more like a bandleader here.

Perception is/as/of Deception,ADULT.,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90de3a20b67c0009b3b2ae/1:1/w_160/Perception%20is:as:of%20Deception_ADULT..jpg,2020-04-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/adult-perception-isasof-deception/,Dais,"For over two decades, the married duo of multi-disciplinary artists Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller have used the guise of electro as an outlet for asking the big questions: Why do I feel so bad? What the hell is your problem? What’s wrong with our society? Now on their eighth studio album as ADULT., Perception is/as/of Deception, Kuperus and Miller turn that focus inward. Over prickly basslines and harsh noise spirals, they shoot off defiant one-liners that sound deep, but their assertions often boil down to that oft-memed adage, “Real eyes realize real lies.” Kuperus and Miller made a name for themselves during New York’s electroclash heyday, but the Detroit band have always sought to distance themselves from the term. (Miller said he felt “hate” for the signifier as early as 2002.) Still, one of the genre’s defining characteristics was a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and the duo have retained some of that. On its face, lead single “Why Always Why” is a coarse interrogation of thoughtless participation in late-stage capitalism (“Don’t you know consuming doesn’t make you exist?”). But then you watch the music video, where the pair don ostentatious sunglasses and leather jackets in a shopping mall and Kuperus pushes a shopping cart through the toilet aisle at Home Depot, and you notice the smirk. As a whole, Perception is more brash than 2018’s This Behavior. Save for the odd drone blast (“Controlled By”) or gliding lead synth (“Reconstruct the Construct”), drum machines and uneasily arpeggiating bass make up the bulk of each song, hearkening back to the early industrial minimalism of DAF or Front 242. The tools haven’t changed, but what they achieve with them has, if ever so slightly. “Second Nature” evokes the neon-drenched synthwave of Kavinsky and Carpenter Brut; the bruising saw wave undulations on “Untroubled Mind (Bring Me Back)” allow Kuperus the room to tap into her inner Ian Curtis. Kuperus is the human anchor that grounds the machine-driven madness, her melodramatic sneers and off-kilter affectations piercing through layers of oppressive atmosphere. “Truth in speech, in gesture, delivery, they persuade you,” she chants on “Total Total Damage,” delivering a miniature summary of Manufacturing Consent. Distrust of authority and the reality-warping tendencies of those who hold it make up some of the central themes of the album; you can just picture Kuperus baring her teeth to spit on the powerful, flanked by grinding textures and shuddering hi-hats. ADULT. have said they set out to create more of a philosophical record than an explicitly political declaration. In the artist statement for an accompanying exhibition, Kuperus and Miller namedrop Goethe, French existentialist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Aldous Huxley’s mescaline-fueled journal The Doors of Perception among the album’s esoteric influences. The result can be lyrics that rarely delve deeper than espousals of generalized wariness, like on “Have I Started At the End” where Kuperus intones, “We… we only see… we only see what we know.” She has a knack for telling stories just by looping memorable phrases. If you stop to notice, she’s just spouting slogans. But as long as the synths are clanging and the lighting is just right, ADULT. sound as dry and self-aware as ever.","On their eighth album, the electro outfit spouts defiant one-liners over prickly basslines and noise spirals, sounding as dry and self-aware as ever.

Growth & Development,22Gz,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e95eb951a3ea30008764f2d/1:1/w_160/Growth%20and%20Development_22Gz.jpeg,2020-04-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22gz-growth-and-development/,AtlanticSniper Gang,"Brooklyn’s drill rap scene began as a ripoff of Chicago’s movement, the sign of a borough that had lost its way. In late 2016, Flatbush’s 22Gz released “Suburban,” a song that sounds like it was made in Chicago’s summer of 2012—the flow is jacked from a teenage G Herbo and the beat might as well be ripped from DJ L’s hard drive. But despite its lack of originality, “Suburban” opened up the possibilities of what drill could become in New York. 22Gz injects the single with the cockiness and swagger that has forever pulsed through the veins of Brooklyn’s premier rappers. Within the next few months, as drill rap became inescapable in the city, 22Gz went to jail. In the spring of 2017, during a trip to Miami, 22Gz and his friends were involved in an argument over a parking spot. The disagreement resulted in the death of two people and 22Gz was arrested and charged with murder. After spending nearly half the year in jail, the case against him never came together, and he was released at the end of 2017. When 22Gz returned to Brooklyn’s drill scene, behind the force of fellow Flatbush rapper Sheff G, drill had progressed. Even as his visibility was raised through signing to Kodak Black’s Sniper Gang imprint, 22Gz’s style lagged behind. His 2019 mixtape, The Blixky Tapet, sounds like it’s from another era. On “Suburban Pt. 2,” the first single from 22Gz’s new mixtape Growth & Development, he makes up some lost ground. It follows the path set by the late Pop Smoke, who separated Brooklyn’s drill from the dead-eyed aggression more common in Chicago; instead, he talked cold-hearted shit while hitting a goofy dance, and without losing an ounce of his intimidation—a balancing act that’s essential in Brooklyn’s latest wave of drill rap. Like, yes, the centerpiece of 22Gz’s “Suburban Pt. 2” is a brutal threat (“Bust your piñata, open your māthā, shoot up the party”), but it’s still catchy and silly enough to have inspired infinite TikTok dance videos. But it becomes clear that the purpose of Growth & Development isn’t to be a good mixtape—it’s just 12 shots at finding a single to follow-up “Suburban Pt. 2.” He comes close with the effortless “No Questions,” like someone put a mic in his face and told him to cut a wrestling promo: “Don’t test us, have my yungin’ take his necklace/Got a temper, make a movie like Netflix.” Though 22Gz no longer has a definitive style of his own, often the songs on the project are dated. There are tracks on the project that sound like they could have landed on an early 2010s Troy Ave mixtape, specifically “ATB,” a reminder of a Brooklyn rap era that made an entire generation turn to Chicago drill in the first place. 22Gz’s attempt at a melody is forced, and “Twirl Girl” is the type of unbearable “modern” rap song you would hear on Empire. He takes another step backward with “The Oath” and “Careers,” both of which have none of Brooklyn’s signature flash and production reminiscent of the cheap Chicago imitations the scene was known for in its earliest days. It’s almost as if 22Gz is out of touch with his own borough, like he has never taken the time to scroll through the Raps & Hustles YouTube page—the unofficial home of Brooklyn drill. The irony is that it’s clear he’s struggling to keep pace with the rapid evolution of a Brooklyn drill scene built on the foundation he laid.","22Gz attempts to chase a hit on a melodic but stale mixtape that struggles to keep up with the drill scene the Brooklyn rapper helped originate.

The Loves of Your Life,Hamilton Leithauser,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8df0c397ffd9000938e29d/1:1/w_160/The%20Loves%20of%20Your%20Life_Hamilton%20Leithauser.jpg,2020-04-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hamilton-leithauser-the-loves-of-your-life/,Glassnote,"In a goofy teaser clip for his new album, Hamilton Leithauser seems to state the obvious: “Writing and recording music by yourself can be lonely.” This is only the former Walkman’s second solo record, following 2014’s Black Hours and a collaborative LP with Rostam. But The Loves of Your Life is far from a solitary work; it is filled with people—both those firmly planted in Leithauser’s world, and those who’ve wandered through by chance. Each of its 11 songs was written about a specific person, and while some names and details have changed, the album is a celebration of community and the relationships that make one possible. It’s an archive of memories that comes alive with the help of Leithauser’s elevated songcraft and dynamic voice. Leithauser’s recording process likewise embraced community. Alongside pros like pianist Jon Batiste and pedal steel player Jonathan Gregg, you’ll find Leithauser’s wife Anna Stumpf, their daughters Georgiana and Frederika, and the girls’ former preschool teacher, Lacrisha Brown, all credited for backing vocals. Leithauser layers their voices expertly throughout the record, in melodies that breeze around the songs and occasionally build into a full-bodied choir. He plays tricks with his own vocals as well, burying muted harmonies and delayed echoes around the edges of the mix. On the brooding “Til Your Ship Comes In,” his voice is in full force, hitting a high Rod Stewart rasp in the chorus and warbling out like warped tape elsewhere. The Loves of Your Life examines an assortment of relationships for which Leithauser conveys deep affection. He loves these characters and wants to understand them, even on “Here They Come,” about a friend hiding from reality in the darkness of the Union Square cinema, or “Isabella,” about a “wide-eyed” Manhattan party girl who dropped out of college long ago. The skyward melodies of “Isabella” mimic the muse: a hopeless romantic staving off adulthood with endless late nights. Leithauser doesn’t denounce Isabella, but attempts to comprehend her dreams, her loneliness. “I wanna be there with her,” he sings, “’til they all go riding home.” The coda grows and grows, Leithauser’s in-house choir lifting it up until it floats away. On “Til Your Ship Comes In,” the sense of being surrounded by familiar faces feels like an intervention; anyone who’s dealt with a self-destructive friend or relative will recognize the theme. “You’re kidding me, right?/With that dot in your eye,” Leithauser growls, watching police lights flash in the street. The layers of vocal tracks have an encircling effect: The subject is locked in a room with people who care too much to let them out. “Everybody wants you in a different way,” Leithauser sings. A dozen voices strong, the refrain feels particularly indicting: “We call you by a different name.” Leithauser’s knack for melody is stronger than ever, particularly on “Isabella” and the big, bittersweet “Wack Jack,” which chronicles an unresolved conflict that drove one party to walk out for good. Caleb Cressman sits in on pedal steel and Batiste lays down a nimble solo, but Leithauser does the rest: drums, bass, guitar, mandolin, synthesizers, Wurlitzer, and vocals. “‘Years from today, when your name is just a name/And my love is a couple candles, twinkling on your cake,’” Leithauser sings, quoting the lost friend’s parting words, “‘That burn won’t hurt you anymore/But I’ll still keep your picture lying in a drawer.’” It’s the kind of remark that ends fights instantly: calm, vicious, poignant. The Loves of Your Life feels like a neighborhood that’s deeply familiar, yet so packed with life that new details emerge on each stroll. You’ll find rainbows streaking through oily puddles, lipstick-kissed cups, breeze-blown magazines, a glossy red Silverado. If you walk long enough, you’ll also get to know the people that live there. Leithauser would like you to meet them.","The former Walkmen member wrote each of these songs about a specific person, forming an archive of memories that comes alive in his elevated songcraft and dynamic voice.

Lost in the Country,Trace Mountains,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8df38be21e4f0009eaf04b/1:1/w_160/Lost%20In%20The%20Country_Trace%20Mountains.jpg,2020-04-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trace-mountains-lost-in-the-country/,Lame-O,"What if the worries that keep you awake at night—fear of commitment, awareness of mortality, the inevitability of loss—could, instead, motivate you during the day? That is the gist of Trace Mountains’ Lost in the Country, a brisk indie rock record that bluntly addresses our deepest concerns and transmutes them into 10 winning anthems about persevering. In the worldview of Dave Benton, the Trace Mountains singer-songwriter who gathered a studio band to shape these songs, the cure is sometimes as simple as a long walk in the woods or a solitary cry in a foreign rock club. Or maybe it’s recognizing, as he does here more than once, that funneling your sadness into a tune just to make it through another day is perfectly acceptable. Lost in the Country responds to novel modern afflictions—the inadequacy that stems from witnessing everyone else’s glamour on social media, or the generational unease of a forsaken future—with Benton’s own survival guide, as comforting for its candor as it is accessible for its instant hooks. Benton is an acolyte of big-guitar indie rock, particularly records that counter the self-doubt and systemic confusion of early adulthood with the bliss of getting loud in a room with your pals. His sacred texts start somewhere around Dinosaur Jr.’s 1987 landmark You’re Living All Over Me, include Built to Spill’s 1994 opus There’s Nothing Wrong With Love, and run up to the War on Drugs’ 2014 breakthrough Lost in the Dream (cannily namechecked by this album’s very title). His devotion has been clear for nearly a decade, first on the hulking albums he made with the promising but departed LVL UP, and on his own as Trace Mountains. His lo-fi debut supplied pure Bright Eyes and Sebadoh pastiche. When he kicked on the amps for 2018’s A Partner to Lean On as LVL UP wound down, he seemed adrift, sad and searching for his own sound. Musically and emotionally, Lost in the Country is a decisive step forward. Those familiar references still abound—the title track might have fit on a turn-of-the-millennium Barsuk compilation, wedged somewhere between Death Cab and John Vanderslice, while the assured solo that ends “Rock & Roll” seems salvaged from A Deeper Understanding’s scrap heap. Benton name-checks that War on Drugs album on the title track, too, reinforcing his devotion to the romantic sweep of epic rock’n’roll, recast for the budgetary constraints of someone who recently quit his bigger band. There’s a newfound poise to these songs, an effortlessness in both conception and delivery that suggests Benton’s music can mirror his heroes while capturing his own experiences, too. Even when he gilds “Cooper’s Dream” with singing saw and glockenspiel or “I Am Leaving You” with blaring surges of bright organ lines, he turns his old loves into your new sing-alongs. That brightness lifts Benton through the darkest parts of these songs. On “Me & May” he considers the implications of a breakup, pondering the parallel universe where he’s still happy and satisfied. Benton acknowledges the regret of choosing one timeline instead of another, but incandescent harmonies and spring-loaded drums guide him to the realization that he did the best he could with what he knew—all any of us can do, he suggests, until we are “drifting into a dream.” Again contemplating the choices we’re forced to make during “Dog Country,” he reflects on leaving Brooklyn for the woods of the Hudson Valley, pondering what he might have lost or gained. Pedal steel and a bucolic shuffle comfort him like hands on his shoulders, tempering FOMO’s bittersweet sting. Lost in the Country’s sanguine mood and full embrace of its indie-rock predecessors run the risk of making Benton sound overly hopeful or naïve, the ostrich plunging its head beneath the surface to ignore the relentless bad news. But Benton is not above or apart from any of it. Especially near the album’s end, he reveals just how low he’s been. “Fallin’ Rain” opens with Benton at his most despondent, his tone furrowed over storm clouds of dark piano chords. And during “Absurdity,” he routes his voice through a tremolo pedal until it shakes like a dead leaf in a windstorm. “We are all on our own/There is no kindness/There is only violence—and smartphones,” he sings with a tremor that recalls Phil Elverum, tenderly rattling off a litany of existential laments. But Benton doesn’t wallow in these pits of self-pity. Instead, he uses them as opportunities to change his circumstances and outlook, to climb out and look at the world around him and tell us about the process. As he marvels at an infinite hillside during “Fallin’ Rain,” he gets lost in something bigger than himself, something that will outlast “this hopeless heartache.” An acoustic guitar and bright electronics sparkle like prisms in the sun, echoing his epiphany. Even then, Benton’s voice remains as fragile as the feelings of inadequacy and guilt he’s fighting. That vulnerability testifies to our daily battles with our deepest insecurities, even after those fleeting moments when it feels like we’ve won. And as it enters its second half, “Absurdity” steadily rises above its misery and torpor, a languid guitar solo leading to a verse that’s as life-affirming as indie rock gets. The most involved song in Benton’s catalog, it moves seamlessly through four distinct sections, like low-stakes prog-rock, to illustrate his lifting mood. It’s a testament to his broader musical and narrative ambitions, perhaps a suggestion of how far he can push his elemental indie rock lineage. Above a suddenly funky beat that suggests summer days spent listening to jam bands, Benton relays a breathless story about hiking among the evergreen trees on a canyon rim. He’s stunned by the sight and feels free, at least until his phone buzzes in his pocket, drawing him back into a world of “true absurdity.” But he remembers now that he’s happy to be here at all, blinking in the daylight. “I guess this means that I can be a part of the ever-unfolding daydream,” he sings, his voice betraying a wry smile. Sometimes, there’s no escaping the sense that we’re living in shit, he seems to say. But at least it means we’re alive, always with something left to fix."," On his solo breakthrough, the former LVL UP singer comes to terms with hard times by fully embracing the indie rock he loves.

Ritorno,Andrea,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e94928aecfafc0008428b4f/1:1/w_160/Ritorno_Andrea.jpg,2020-04-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/andrea-ritorno/,Ilian Tape,"The roster of Munich’s Ilian Tape may be headlined by locals like the Zenker Brothers and Skee Mask, but the label’s Italian contingent has long been one of its biggest strengths. Turin natives Stenny and Andrea first connected with the crew in 2011, when the former organized an Ilian Tape night and spent a couple of days driving the Zenker Brothers around his hometown. The following year, both Stenny and Andrea debuted on the imprint, and the two have been part of Ilian Tape’s core membership ever since, sharing similar trajectories and helping to solidify the label’s distinct brand of broken techno. In 2019, Stenny leveled up when he released his debut full-length, Upsurge, which impressively brought together angular breakbeats, dalliances with drum’n’bass, and headier ambient sounds. Now it’s Andrea’s turn to tackle the album format, with excellent results. His productions have always fallen toward the dreamier end of the spectrum, and he’s leaned into that here; it’s not often that Ilian Tape releases could be described as shimmering, but the album’s palette is a lot closer to Café del Mar than Cafe OTO. The sparkling arpeggios of aqueous opener “Attimo” and the dreamy synths that idle atop the peppy breakbeats of “LS September” are just two of the LP’s more Balearic elements, but golden hues and languid melodies drift and linger throughout. For a record coming out of a cold, post-industrial corner of northern Italy, Ritorno’s aesthetic is surprisingly luminous. Despite its sunny overtones, there’s plenty of low-end weight in the album’s foundation. The fluttering basslines of “TrackQY”—the LP’s most obviously club-ready tune—sound like something lifted from late-’90s drum’n’bass, while the crunchy wobble of “Liquid” is a classic dubstep throwback. There’s an abundance of DJ material, yet the album is practically devoid of staid, linear rhythms. Cribbing from house, techno, electro, breakbeat, jungle, trip-hop and IDM, Andrea’s hybrid creations have a lot in common with the more intriguing strands of bass music coming from UK outposts like Timedance and Livity Sound. From the soaring jungle mutation “Drumzzy” to the shuffling serenity of “Isabelle’s String,” the drum programming taps into a unique sort of organized chaos, with loose-limbed beats regularly teetering on the edge of collapse but somehow never losing the groove. Ritorno is Italian for “return,” and it’s easy to detect a ’90s vibe in its cosmic inclinations and freewheeling rhythms, which hark back to a sunnier, more lighthearted era when genre lines were less defined and the electronic music world wasn’t quite so balkanized. But Ritorno isn’t a strictly nostalgic effort, and the production is unmistakably modern, even as Andrea criss-crosses through numerous styles and eras. Outside of his long-running affiliation with Ilian Tape, he has never been locked into any particular trend or scene; instead, he has quietly developed his own artistic vision during years spent working in the background. That patience has paid off: Ritorno is a remarkably confident and cohesive work. Nearly a decade in the making, it’s Andrea’s first big statement, and proof that this low-key Italian producer has something valuable to add to the conversation.","This is the Italian electronic producer’s debut album for Munich’s Ilian Tape label; for a record coming out of post-industrial Turin, its aesthetic is surprisingly luminous.

Mas Amable,DJ Python ,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90a0a220b67c0009b3b2ac/1:1/w_160/python.jpg,2020-04-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-python-mas-amable/,Incienso,"DJ Python calls his music “deep reggaeton”: a fusion of reggaeton’s dembow rhythm with the ethereal electronics of ambient and classic IDM. Python—aka Brian Piñeyro, a New Yorker of Ecuadorean and Argentine extraction—spent part of his adolescence in Miami, where the ubiquitous reggaeton beat soundtracked a growing interest in his own Latinx heritage. Once he learned that his friend Anthony Naples, who runs the Incienso and Proibito labels, was a south Florida native, Piñeyro decided to make a reggaeton record for him, but one rooted in underground house and techno. The result was Python’s 2017 debut album, Dulce Compañia, which paired loping dembow cadences with wistful, watery synths; last year’s Derretirse ventured deeper into his imagined subgenre. He’s gotten a remarkable amount of mileage out of the marriage of the two styles, and on Mas Amable he breaks new ground by slowing the tempo further. By virtually any metric, this is Python’s simplest record yet. All eight tracks share a single tempo and palette—part tropical strut, part moonwalk—and they’ve been seamlessly mixed together in the manner of a DJ set or a live electronic performance. In fact, it’s debatable whether these could even be classified as distinct songs, or whether they simply constitute one very long composition. It feels in many ways like a 48-minute single, the kind of thing that used to seem so audacious in Ricardo Villalobos’ hands. But there’s nothing audacious about Mas Amable. It’s smooth. Python’s music has always been hypnotic, but Mas Amable is particularly spellbinding, interweaving contrasting synth parts and percussion patterns so subtly that you’re barely aware of the changes. The record begins with a beatless ambient introduction of gentle synth pads and soft, rainy rustling noises; the scene might be a distant forest clearing or just a backyard in Queens. There’s something appealing about the placelessness; the open-ended setting doesn’t impose a mood so much as invite you to project your own state of mind onto the scene. With the second track, “Pia,” the pensive atmospheres persist even as the drums kick in, tough and unadorned. For a time, the fog burns off, and wistful synths give way to sterner textures: scratchy, insect-like shakers and buzzing, bit-crushed croaks, like robotic frogs. Minimalist synth melodies evoke melancholy ’90s worksrecordings by Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Disjecta. Every so often, a forlorn whistle streaks through the frame, like a freight train in the dead of night. The album’s desolate centerpiece, “ADMSDP,” is even more evocative of witching-hour loneliness. Everything falls silent except for the drums, making room for a spooky monologue from the poet LA Warman. “Where was the place where you felt OK?” she murmurs, her voice slow and low, evoking an ASMR video. “Go to this place.” As guided meditations go, it is both bleak and empathic. It’s OK to sleep the entire day, she tells us—to cry on the train, to think life has no meaning but suffering. “It’s OK to feel hopeless, because the world is hopeless. It’s OK to think about dying.” It’s a striking moment, a strange fusion of death-metal nihilism with new-age textures and tropical rhythms, though it doesn’t last long: Soon she is urging us to reconnect with our bodies—“to feel how soft you are, how warm you are, how smooth your surfaces are.” As if in response, the music warms, too: rosy new chords rise in the mix, and the rhythm slackens, as though a pinched nerve had suddenly been massaged away. The remainder of the album is a gentle denouement, a return to the ambient overtones of the record’s introduction. That full-circle journey makes for a curious record: It doesn’t do much, yet it covers a surprising amount of ground. By stripping away everything extraneous, Piñeyro has further refined the sound of his invented genre. Deep reggaeton has never sounded deeper.","The smooth and hypnotic tracks on the Queens-based producer’s new album share a single tempo and palette—part tropical strut, part moonwalk.

Migration Stories,M. Ward,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e908221ac9e490008f40861/1:1/w_160/Migration%20Stories_M.%20Ward.jpg,2020-04-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/m-ward-migration-stories/,Anti-,"Under the Donald J. Trump administration, singing about migration is an explicitly political act. But M. Ward is constitutionally predisposed towards mystery and understatement, so his Migration Stories sidesteps protests and outrages. The album, Ward’s 10th as a solo artist, unfurls at a deliberate pace, luxuriating in a dreamworld conjured out of memories, shared stories, and flights of fancy. Though 21st-century headlines may have been Ward’s initial inspiration for Migration Stories, he declines to write about current controversies. Instead, they’re a context for Ward’s grander design, which is focused on the emotional and spiritual motivations for migration. Some of his intent stems from his own family history, specifically his grandfather’s journey from Mexico to the United States at the dawn of the 20th century. Ward doesn’t tackle this story directly. He instead evokes that era through a dreamy cover of “Along the Santa Fe Trail,” a tune written for the 1940 western film Santa Fe Trail, which he initially encountered in a version by the singing cowboy Jimmy Wakely. Ward moves “Along the Santa Fe Trail” away from its origins and toward the spacy, untethered roots-rock that’s been his calling card for the better part of two decades. He traveled to Montreal to work with producer Craig Silvey—the first time he’s cut an album with a co-producer—at Arcade Fire’s studio, recording with band members Richard Reed Parry and Tim Kingsbury. All the new collaborators don’t radically reshape Ward’s music so much as expand its parameters. The difference between the new and old is made clear by the handful of tracks Ward recorded and produced on his own. “Chamber Music,” along with the instrumentals “Stevens’ Snowman” and “Rio Drone,” are delicate and contained, where the rest of the record seems to spread out across a starry sky. Much of this picturesque quality stems from the subtle contributions of Parry and Kingsbury or, in the case of the album opener “Migration of Souls,” the spectral supporting vocals of the Lost Brothers. Harmonies float through the songs, intertwining with gossamer slides of synthesizers, the arrangements accentuating the dusty twang of Ward’s guitar and his whispered singing. Often, these sounds are felt as much as heard, adding depth and dimension to a collection of songs that suggest a faded nocturnal transmission from a mid-century radio station deep in the Southwest. Unlike 2016’s More Rain, the tempo never quite quickens (“Unreal City” is the only song with a propulsive pulse, but even that is muted) and the volume never rises. Nor is there a sense of levity—a quality that surfaced on 2018’s What a Wonderful Industry, Ward’s otherwise barbed letter to the music business. Migration Stories simply drifts along at its own lazy pace, letting its pretty textures become the connective tissue. Sometimes, Ward’s words break through the haze. Images of families and lovers striving to reconnect, either in this world or the next, float to the surface, as do visions of traveling shows, David Bowie’s Major Tom, and displaced wanderers searching for a home they’ve seen only in dreams. All these passages paint a picture of souls in transition, literally and spiritually, hinting at the reasons people choose to leave their country for another. Ward’s decision to not directly confront the immigration horrors of modern times isn’t cowardly; it’s entirely in character. As a singer and songwriter, he specializes in miniatures and suggestions, taking indirect routes to simple truths.","The dusty twang of M.

Live in Paris (1975),Pharoah Sanders,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e909b2385f3a70008b09d24/1:1/w_160/liveinparis.jpg,2020-04-13 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pharoah-sanders-live-in-paris-1975/,Transversales Disques,"When Pharoah Sanders played tenor saxophone with John Coltrane in the 1960s, his tone was harsh and wild. Soloing alongside Coltrane on records like Ascension, Om, and Live in Japan, Sanders’ horn would shriek and howl and cry, reaching a pitch of earth-shaking intensity on pieces that pushed jazz to the limits of legibility. But after Coltrane’s death in 1967, Sanders began exploring a different path. Playing with Alice Coltrane on Ptah, the El Daoud and Journey in Satchidananda, and on his own albums for the Impulse! label, his sound was still searching, but now it was lyrical, and his musical settings often included trance-inducing grooves. After a half-decade enduring the blast furnace of free jazz, Sanders’ style grew more spiritual and cosmic and started looking to music from around the globe for inspiration. The records Sanders made for Impulse! in the first half of the 1970s are marked by intensity and emotional focus but also by accessibility. Solos sometimes included intense overblowing, but sunny melodies and rich instrumental textures bent the music toward peace and light. This is where we find Sanders and his band when they played a show in Paris in 1975. His Impulse! period was behind him, and a few years away were the records for Clive Davis’ Arista, where he’d make deeper forays into R&B and even touch on disco. While he was in this in-between space, Sanders’ group rolled up all the best qualities from his early-1970s LPs into a set that bursts with joy and discovery, positive vibrations radiating in every direction. It captured a gig in a studio at the studios of Radio France with a capacity of about 800 people, the site of live albums by Cannonball Adderley, Freddie Hubbard, and Grant Green. The quality of the sound is exceptional. Given the sonics and the wide appeal of the set, this isn’t a bad place to start for someone new to his work. The essence of Sanders’ music in this period is the two-chord vamp. This wasn’t the only structure he used and he would occasionally take on standards or tunes by John Coltrane, but vamps undergirded a lot of his most memorable music. Most of the tunes on “Live in Paris (1975)” are built from simple basslines by Calvin Hill, and pianist Danny Mixon seesaws back and forth between two chords, with a few variations. Music that goes on for minutes on end with only two repeating chords creates a special mood. It’s not unlike listening to the sound of breathing. Tension builds and releases with each successive bar, but the feeling is open and easeful, bringing to mind dreamy images—trees moving outside a car window, waves crashing into a shore. A two-chord vamp suggests travel, but it never feels like it’s going anywhere in particular. The journey, rather than the destination, is what counts. Such a harmonic framework is perfect for Sanders, who stretches out on solos that are melodic and lyrical but still relatively simple, a triumph of tone and phrasing possible only when virtuosity is a given. “Love Is Here,” performed in two parts, mostly centers on a vamp, with Hill playing his bass high on the neck to give the groove an elastic propulsion, as if he’s in front pulling the band behind him. At times, Sanders goes into the fiery overblowing that he made his name with, but these eruptions never last long, and they seem celebratory rather than violent. He also sings through his horn, creating a beautiful bird-like yelp that blurs the lines between voice and instrument. Similar techniques are found in “Farrell Tune,” another classic-sound vamp that bears some resemblance to Sanders 1971 tune “Thembi.” Sanders’ reins in his most far-out musical conceptions here; it’s a set that sounds more like a party than a seance. The original version of “The Creator Has a Masterplan,” which debuted on Sanders’ 1969 album Karma, ran over 32 minutes. But this take is more focused, keeping the original’s searching melody but simplifying the arrangement. Mixon gets harp-like tones out of his piano, with quick trills on the upper keys that sound almost like strums, and he breaks out for a funky solo. “I Want to Talk About You” is a ballad closely associated with John Coltrane—it appears on both Soultrane and Live at Birdland—and it’s the one change-up on a set that is otherwise quite unified. Sanders gives it a yearning, though relatively straight reading, and the standard’s chord changes offer a welcome diversion from the consistent groove. Three of the six tracks feature the word “love” and another suggests that God knows what he’s doing, so the overriding mood here is one of comfort and bliss. On the closing “Love Is Everywhere” Sanders sings and chants as often as he plays his horn, sounding like a preacher at a revival leading a call-and-response. Hearing his rough vocals over the impossibly peppy and cheerful music compels the untrained singers among us to join in. The song’s false ending, taking a page out of James Brown’s book, is pure communal ecstasy, filled with an organ swell, crashing drums, and chants that seem to bring every Parisian in the room to their feet. It’s so stirring, it makes you want to look around wherever you are when listening to confirm what he’s singing: Love is everywhere. Could it be? Whatever contrary evidence exists elsewhere in the world, now or any other time in history, Sanders makes a convincing case for its omnipresence on this particular day 45 years ago.","Pharoah Sanders’ group rolled up all the best qualities from his early-1970s LPs into a newly reissued set that bursts with joy and discovery.

Jacqueline,Jackie Lynn,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8df5fdac9e490008f40854/1:1/w_160/Jacqueline_Jackie%20Lynn.jpg,2020-04-13 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jackie-lynn-jacqueline/,Drag City,"On Haley Fohr’s second album under the moniker Jackie Lynn, she lays out her rules for travelers. “Travel light, share your finds,” she starts out on “Traveler’s Code of Conduct,” doling out seemingly familiar instructions before the track slowly disintegrates, turning sinister and surreal. A low, electronic thrum engulfs Fohr’s voice as she begins firing off more complex, difficult thoughts—“I’m thinking of past lives/I’m thinking of having a kid”—the kind that might occur to you after long hours alone on the road. As with Fohr’s best songwriting, like her 2018 record as Circuit Des Yeux, what first appears simple or familiar soon reveals strange and surprising depths. When we first met Jackie Lynn, she was a drug kingpin telling an elaborate tale of revenge and redemption. Jacqueline, however, depicts the everyday inner life of a long-haul truck driver. It’s a shift in character, retaining the dramatic presence of Jackie Lynn while re-casting the specifics. By adding the element of long-distance travel, Fohr merges Jackie’s story more closely with her own: The album was conceived largely during time on the road as a touring musician. In her original iteration, Jackie Lynn came with a lot of baggage, but on Jacqueline, she’s stripped back to an archetype. Fohr describes her as “more of a costume than a figure... her wig looks like a wig. It doesn’t look like real hair. I want people to recognize that that’s someone dressed up. All you need is dirty wigs to find a new you.” Cut through with the scent of gasoline and hairspray, Jacqueline revels in the gritty glamour of its central concept. With the assistance of Cooper Crain, Rob Frye, and Dan Quinlivan (aka Bitchin Bajas), the ambitious, synthetic soundscapes have the feeling of trying on every gown in the closet. The record opens with the propulsive drum pattern and hyperactive synth melodies of “Casino Queen,” mimicking the forward motion of wheels on tarmac. “Shugar Water” is a bluesy, rambunctious bar sing-a-long, and “Odessa”—a seven-minute psychedelic jam—is a journey within itself. On the latter, Fohr carves out wide open spaces between her chopped-up vocal lines, using acidic sci-fi synths and urgent drums to evoke the near-spiritual loneliness of the solo traveler. Yet the isolation of Jackie Lynn is felt most deeply in the album’s meditative moments. On some of these more minimalist songs, like “Dream St.” and “Lenexa,” the structure can feel so slight and spacious that there’s little to grab onto. But on the album closer “Control,” a masterful slow release, Fohr evokes a very different side of her titular character. Here, the casino queen has mellowed and turned inwards, hands steady on the wheel as she drives into the sunset. Once again, Jackie’s experience seems to dovetail with Fohr’s own: Between extreme bursts of extroversion, the traveling performer must also find peace with her own thoughts. Fohr’s songwriting has always envisioned a vast emotional landscape, and in just a short time with Jackie Lynn/Jacqueline, she shows us a broad sweep of this driver’s isolated life. On the twinkling, sighing “Lenexa,” Fohr repeatedly intones: “I got everything you need.” The double-edged pronouncement encapsulates the mood of the record: On the one hand, it is an empowering statement of wholeness and self-sufficiency; and yet, in Fohr’s resonant voice, it is weighted with sadness.","Circuit Des Yeux’s Haley Fohr recasts her alter ego as a long-haul trucker against ambitious, synthetic soundscapes that evoke the near-spiritual loneliness of the solo traveler.

Annual Flowers in Color,Imaginary Softwoods,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e909d15e21e4f0009eaf05b/1:1/w_160/annualflowers.jpg,2020-04-13 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/imaginary-softwoods-annual-flowers-in-color/,Mineral Disk,"The cult-favorite trio Emeralds—comprised of John Elliott, Steve Hauschildt, and Mark McGuire—spent the late 2000s fusing drone, New Age and kosmiche better than any band of their time. Despite putting out more than 40 projects before disbanding in 2012, Emeralds left behind a lingering sense of unrealized possibilities—strands of which its members have been exploring in their solo careers. Though Elliott continued with projects like Mist and Outer Space, his focus has increasingly shifted to running his label Spectrum Spools, an off-shoot of Editions Mego that trades in the cutting-edge club sounds of Container and Second Woman and experimental gems like Donato Dozzy Plays Bee Mask and Motion Sickness of Time Travel. If Elliott’s own solo output slowed, the success of his label always felt like an understandable trade-off — but there may be another reason. Annual Flowers In Color is the album he has been writing, editing, living with and returning to since the final days of Emeralds. The album is credited to Imaginary Softwoods, a moniker that stretches back to 2008 and often explores the side of Elliott’s synth work that might have been crushed under the weight of Emeralds’ drones. The album originally surfaced in 2016 as a small-run cassette collecting unreleased material, but he kept pruning the recordings over the years. Now released in finished form nearly a decade after its earliest recordings, Annual Flowers emerges from its chrysalis a wounded, staggeringly beautiful statement that feels like a new high point in his career. This new edition is expanded by a lush remastering for vinyl, but it’s just as noteworthy for what’s removed—nearly a third of the original album. He trims some tracks to brief interludes and omits others altogether, but each decision enhances the original’s cathartic power. “Cloud Damage” opens with Angelo Badalamenti-style organ that swells before being swallowed up in a hard-cut instant by the chiming, chromatic synth loop of “Positive Ruin Court Garden.” The effect is jarring, but not unpleasant, like being awakened from a nightmare by birdsong. The pieces set the stage for “Aura Show,” the first of two epics, where Elliott generates synth waves so soothing that the pensive melody of its second half feels like a spontaneous discovery every time. It compliments “Another First/Sea Machine,” which builds hypnotic ripples of arpeggios over a nearly 11-minute arc that peaks with the kind of endorphin-pumping rush that defined Does It Look Like I’m Here’s best moments. What sticks out most is Elliott’s care in framing his tracks with the subtlest elements: the quiet rattle of what sounds like a stalling motor, a spoken-word snippet by Japanese artist Yuri, or the gentle room-shaking rumble of a passing train running through heartbreaking closer “The Imminent Collapse Department,” a haunting fusion of music-box melodies and crumbling sound design that recalls Broadcast’s final work with The Focus Group. Even the tracks cut from Annual Flowers (all of which are remastered and included as digital bonus tracks) are quite good, which only makes Elliott’s editing job more difficult. “Positive Ruin” and “Aura Show,” tracks that flow perfectly together, were originally separated by the lively “Multiple Discovery” and “Calendula,” but their absence ultimately strengths and focuses everything around it. Elsewhere, the mournful synth flickering through “The Geranium Room” is cut down to a minute-long interlude, a crucial choice that reframes it as the heart of the album. It all creates a gravity-shifting power that makes the album sound like it couldn’t have been constructed any other way. What may have begun as demos and sketches in 2011, and an overlooked highlight in 2016, has aged to perfection in 2020.","Originally released as a limited-run cassette, this collection of synth pieces from the former Emeralds member is a staggeringly beautiful career highlight.

Song for Our Daughter,Laura Marling,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e90912414d7100009d3fda2/1:1/w_160/Song%20for%20Our%20Daughter_Laura%20Marling.jpg,2020-04-11 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/laura-marling-song-for-our-daughter/,PartisanChrysalis,"There is a song on Laura Marling’s new album which bottles despair and keeps it airtight, like a storm cloud in a glass dome. “Fortune” is the kind of musical moment that can make you freeze in the deli aisle, rooted to the spot by Marling’s voice. It’s a spare lament about an unnamed woman who hopes to escape her unhappy life yet is powerless to make that change. The burden of sorrow is passed down from mother to child until, finally, the “unbearable pain” is absorbed by Marling herself, whose inspiration for the song was her mother’s never-used “running away fund.” Picture-perfect appearances, she seems to say, can hide a well of sadness deeper than we can imagine. On her Grammy-nominated 2017 album Semper Femina, Marling used Classical-era imagery to add mythos to women-focused stories, but Song for Our Daughter, her seventh album, is guided by its own kind of far-reaching lore. Marling does away with her previous record’s occasional blues-rock grit and peels her sound back to its gleaming bones: pristine acoustic guitar, textural hums, a metronome click. She doesn’t need much else to frame her quartz pendant of a voice, which can reach Alpine altitudes as well recall a troubadour singing through chewing tobacco. Marling has described Song for Our Daughter as a rumination on modern femininity, and her tendency to leave lyrical narratives open and unfinished adds an evocative elasticity to her new music. You may find yourself wanting to fill in the spaces as if playing a particularly soul-searching kind of Mad Libs. Marling—an avid reader who once visited her local book store several times a week—sketches her new heroines with a literary bent. The subject of the rousing album opener, “Alexandra,” is partially inspired by a Leonard Cohen song, an enigmatic woman who finds ”diamonds in the drain” and collects them with abandon. The metaphor implies the jewels are simple men that fall under Alexandra’s spell. “If she loved you like a woman,” Marling sings with a withering tone, “Did you feel like a man?” At other times, Marling is downright funny, rolling her eyes at the champagne socialism of the recently woke. “Girl, please,” she sings drily. “Don’t bullshit me.” Still, Marling has not quite forgotten her genteel upbringing in Berkshire, UK. “I won’t write a woman with a man on my mind,” she sings on the album, before worrying, “Hope that doesn’t sound too unkind.” At other times, Marling sounds delightfully carefree. She sings the upbeat, folk-rock tune “Strange Girl” with a swaggering tone and a full band, calling to mind a group of journeymen busking with a bashed-up guitar case open at their feet. At one point in the song, a laugh creeps into her voice, as if she’d caught the eye of a mugging band member mid-sentence. And while “Held Down” describes the cruelty of abandonment over trundling bass guitar, Marling sounds about as stressed as a flower child singing to the moon, her vocals bathed in psychedelic coos. As much as she sings of unrest, Marling's tone suggests a serene clairvoyance for the future, as if she has an 8-ball telling her everything will be okay. She’s even able to bring an optimistic outlook to the starkly beautiful break-up song “The End of the Affair,” a co-write with Blake Mills. “I love you goodbye,” she sings, her voice rising to a falsetto before putting a decisive cap on the relationship. “Now let me live my life.” Song for Our Daughter brims with peaceful reflections that, even though Marling herself is just grazing her 30s, could seem like the work of an artist in their twilight years. “I’ve lived my life in fits and spurts,” she sings at one point on the album; “Bruises all end up benign,” she offers elsewhere. She thinks about passing on that perspective to an imagined daughter in the elegant, bucolic title track, describing misogynist “bullshit” and predatory creeps. “You’ll cut your way through it somehow,” she sings with relief, a tone that suggests lessons learned the hard way. Marling caps the song by broadening its perspective further still, invoking the writers of “words that will outlive the dead.” It’s a class to which Marling also belongs.","The starkly beautiful seventh album from the venerable singer-songwriter reveals more of her aged wisdom through winding narratives rich with humor and despair.

Rock Sutra,Sun Araw,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8ce3ffecfafc0008428b2b/1:1/w_160/Rock%20Sutra_Sun%20Araw.jpg,2020-04-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sun-araw-rock-sutra/,Sun Ark,"At the age of 36, Cameron Stallones has released more than 20 albums—with Magic Lantern, Duppy Gun, and the Celebrate Music Synthesizer Group—but mostly under the name Sun Araw. A shockingly consistent electronic craftsman and guitar noodler who loves improvisation, Stallones’ songs are funny, rhythmic, never too danceable, and most obviously psychedelic, the first label to stick when the California-based artist arrived on the scene a decade ago. Now that he’s distanced himself from the reverb-heavy loops that marked his breakout, 2010’s On Patrol, it’s easier to understand Stallones in a wider world of spontaneous experimentation, one that extends to the adventurousness of mid-to-late century jazz and the heady treatments of technology-embracing classical composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez. Still, Stallones remains a beguiling figure because of just how eclectic his discography and persona have become. Often photographed with a mustache and trucker hat, he presents like an indie rocker, and his relationship with the label Drag City adds to his cred in the genre. Perhaps his most beloved album, Icon Give Thank, is a collaboration with reggae legends the Congos, and while his production style borrows from the Jamaican dub tradition, the fluid shifts in his dense arrangements suggest West African pop music of the 1970s. With Sun Araw, Stallones gives these transcontinental musical voyages an idiosyncratic vessel. His vocals sound canned and generic, as though sampled from non-musical sources. His lyrics have a sense of humor, a disarming quality in an artist who once described himself as a “recovering academic.” Stallones’ latest, Rock Sutra, is one of the best access points to his discography. While previous highlights On Patrol, Belomancie, and his recent The Saddle of the Increate stretched out over an hour-plus, Rock Sutra clocks in at a concise 40 minutes. Musically, the album picks up where Increate left off, with exclamatory vocals and swirling polyrhythms indebted to afrobeat. Yet for the first time, Stallones’ African influences sound doubly filtered through the western exposures of David Byrne and Brian Eno; the guitar on the rousing “Arrambe” functions as a bass, while the stormy basslines on “78 Sutra” and “Catalina” part in the middle to reveal soaring, short-lived melodies. On Sutra, Stallones is thinking in terms of instruments and how they relate to one another. His set-up now includes synthesizer player Marc Riordan and percussionist Jon Leland, and their interplay is unprecedentedly groovy. On opener “Roomboe,” Stallones commands “Half-step!” like a Bar Mitzvah DJ encouraging reluctant kids to dance. The live-to-MIDI recording process, too, shows that Stallones wants listeners to imagine this iteration of his act as a band playing together, reacting to the instincts of its members in real time—even if he ultimately exerts a perfectionist’s control over each pitch. Electronic music often sounds like the painstaking product of time in isolation. Mediated as it is by technology, Stallones’ experimentation acknowledges a social universe. The attentive way that he reacts to his collaborators, his influences, and his own ego indicates that he wants to talk to listeners, bygone musicians and—he would be the first to say—the cosmos. In these lonesome times, Rock Sutra captures Sun Araw at its most chatty: speaking to much that came before itself, and a whole galaxy outside.","One of the best access points to Cameron Stallones’ eclectic discography, Rock Sutra imagines his act as a band playing together, reacting to the instincts of its members in real time.

Shine,Joni Mitchell,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8f3a14ac9e490008f4085a/1:1/w_160/JoniMitchellShine.jpg,2020-04-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joni-mitchell-shine/,Craft,"In the summer of 2005, Joni Mitchell was at peace. She was 61 years old, three years into retirement, and leading a life that, in her words, consisted mostly of “being a granny and watching a lot of television.” One particular day, she was sitting outside the Vancouver home where she wrote ’70s masterpieces like For the Roses and Court and Spark. She watched the Pacific Ocean sprawl in the distance. Herons flew overhead; roses bloomed in the garden. When she came back inside, she sat at the piano and translated the view into a serene, sentimental melody. It was her first new composition in years. She wanted to call it “Gratitude.” She ended up going with “One Week Last Summer” and placing it as the opening track on 2007’s Shine, her first collection of new songs in over a decade and her last album to date. At the time of release, it was largely perceived as a response to turbulent times: the Bush administration, the Iraq War, the deterioration of our planet. Revisiting it now upon its first vinyl release, its songs still feel urgent, but they also sound untethered to any political moment. “I did a lot of weeping for what’s happening to the Earth when I was in my twenties,” Mitchell said at the time. “I could see a lot of things coming.” Even at its most hopeless, Shine observes chaos from a distance that feels centered and assured; these are protest songs delivered as solemn premonitions. Recorded mostly alone with engineer Dan Marnien, Shine has its own distinct atmosphere. Mitchell’s ’80s work was defined by a busy, glossy pop sound that purposefully contrasted with her darker worldview, while her ’90s albums returned her to the soft, sophisticated arrangements of her most celebrated era. With flourishes of MIDI orchestras and droning synth pads, peculiar jazz phrasings and muted horns, Shine feels akin to late-career work by her peers—somewhere between Leonard Cohen’s synthetic hymnals and Van Morrison’s smooth-jazz vision quests. Its most adventurous moment (“Hana”) lurches and grinds to skittering percussion, while its ballads feature little more than her worn-out vocals and downcast piano playing. Often Mitchell uses textures from throughout her catalog like Ghosts of Christmas Past: “When this place looks like a moonscape,” she sings over the acoustic coffeehouse strum of “This Place,” “Don’t say I didn’t warn ya.” The themes that dominate this album are ones that Mitchell had turned to over and over throughout her catalog. To prove her point that these modern worries are nothing new, she includes a revamped rendition of her 1970 hit “Big Yellow Taxi,” reorchestrating it with bursts of accordion and saxophone. Even if it’s one of the less essential inclusions on the record, its placement showcases the consistency and self-contained philosophy of her songbook. It also draws attention to what’s changed. Mitchell’s voice on Shine is a fascinating instrument: a yellowed photograph, frayed and fading. On Both Sides Now and Travelogue, early-’00s albums that felt like epilogues, Mitchell was backed by an orchestra, revisiting old songs in elegant settings. On Shine, she’s accompanied by sparse atmospheres that bring her strained, ghostly delivery into focus. This was by design: “I am closer to the singers I love,” she explained. “I never imagined I’d be able to sing like Edith Piaf.” It makes sense that she was thrilled by her transformation, by challenging expectations with each breath. By the time Mitchell released Shine in the fall of 2007, she had completed two equally ambitious artistic projects: an exhibit of her recent, apocalyptic photography and a sprawling narrative dance piece with the Alberta Ballet Company. She had originally been asked to collaborate on a biographical show soundtracked by her hits. She said no: “I’m not interested in escapist entertainment when the planet is at red alert.” She speaks to a similar desire in the album’s title track, where, over the span of seven and a half minutes, she casts a light on all corners of the earth, calling out people by name and profession, forecasting great destruction and confusion ahead. At times it sounds like a list of grievances, her tone purposefully unpoetic. But the implied message is that it’s not too late to turn around. “When the world becomes a massive mess with nobody at the helm,” she said, “It’s time for artists to make their mark.” On Shine, Mitchell sings with wisdom and grace, sadness and compassion. Her mark is indelible.","In its day, this 2007 album felt like a response to turbulent times. Revisiting the newly reissued LP, its songs feel untethered to any political moment: protest songs delivered as solemn premonitions.

The New Abnormal,The Strokes,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8ca8479a08f300084d48d7/1:1/w_160/The%20New%20Abnormal_The%20Strokes.jpg,2020-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-strokes-the-new-abnormal/,RCA,"Just as the clock struck midnight on a new decade, Julian Casablancas delivered the news that Strokes fans had been waiting to hear. “The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off,” he announced at the band’s New Year’s Eve show in Brooklyn. “And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back.” No matter where the last 10 years have left you—Angles defender, Voidz apologist, Meet Me in the Bathroom nostalgist who gave up hope a long time ago—it was easy to feel a trickle of excitement. After all, what Strokes fan wouldn’t want to believe this band’s spotty recent output was the result of a long-dormant period and not because, you know, they all hate each other and have a dozen other projects they’d rather focus on? And what better time to launch their comeback than a holiday marked by great expectations and even greater partying? The New Abnormal, the Strokes’ sixth album and first in seven years, mostly just feels like a hangover. It’s sluggish and slight, and the strongest hooks are so familiar that they require additional writing credits for the ’80s hits they copy note-for-note (Billy Idol’s “Dancing With Myself” in “Bad Decisions,” Psychedelic Furs’ “The Ghost in You” in “Eternal Summer”). Of course, the Strokes have never been subtle with their references—that’s part of the fun—but they’ve become increasingly uninterested in the tight, classic songcraft that once felt entirely their own. With producer Rick Rubin, a presence so hands-off as to feel merely symbolic, their signature sound is rendered as background music, a set of bleary-eyed mood pieces, all hovering around the five-minute mark before fizzling out with a shrug. A generous read is that it’s a style they have never attempted before: pushing their songs to their limits, maintaining a state of Zen in their machinelike interplay. In the nearly 20 years since Is This It, the Strokes have never quite found a way to successfully expand on their blueprint. There are the loungey, drum-less ballads you can expect to find about halfway through all their tracklists (“Ask Me Anything,” “Call Me Back,” this album’s first single “At the Door”). And then there are the proggy, metallic experiments that Casablancas now seems content to channel through Voidz, a project he has plainly admitted is where his passion lies. Historically, neither mode has led to anyone’s favorite Strokes songs. And so the best moments on The New Abnormal, like the genuinely pretty “Ode to the Mets,” feel like a step in the right direction. When everything locks into place, it’s like watching an old pinball machine light up, one level at a time. Another small victory is that Casablancas’ falsetto has improved. What once felt like a novelty (at best) actually leads to some striking moments. The verses of “Eternal Summer” are sleek and exciting—that is, until the unfortunate Austin Powers impression of a bridge waltzes in to kill everyone’s buzz. “The Adults Are Talking,” with its steady build and soaring climax, adds to their legacy of great album openers. After his distracted performances on Angles and Comedown Machine, Casablancas now sounds tasked with keeping spirits light; from the slurred Sinatra croon in “Not the Same Anymore” to his pop-punk sneer in “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus,” he seems up for the challenge. But the spark fades quickly, and you’re left with a set of promising ideas for Strokes songs with their fire stomped out. Casablancas has spoken about a politicized edge to his recent lyrics, but his allusions to the climate crisis (“Eternal Summer”) and body-shaming (“Selfless”) fail to inspire much urgency in his bandmates. And while their trademark fuzz once made their albums sound like well-loved mixtapes handed down through the decades, the same quality now makes you feel like they’re piecing together scraps. Disjointed songs like “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” and “Selfless” literally grind to a halt and start over after each chorus, like they tried to figure out a better transition and then just gave up. “You’re not the same anymore/Don’t want to play that game anymore,” Casablancas sings in a ballad near the end of the album. And why should he? No band deserves to be held to the standard they set in their twenties, and no fan should want to hear their heroes rehash old poses for a quick paycheck. The current democratic nature of the Strokes (the music is credited to “The Strokes,” while the first three records were credited exclusively to Casablancas) means that simply bringing ideas to fruition requires more compromise—that is to say, more work. It also means that a band who should be settling into their legacy is still suffering from growing pains. “There was never a feeling of: we fucking made it! Roll credits!”, Albert Hammond Jr. recently confessed about their rise to fame. “It was always this kind of half-anxious, half-exciting ‘What the hell is happening?’” For all its faults, The New Abnormal might capture how the Strokes are feeling: not ready to fade out, not primed for a comeback. Right now, they’re just way too tired.","The NYC band’s first album in seven years is sluggish and slight, rendering their signature sound as background music.

Friday Forever,Everything Is Recorded,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8caadc1a3ea30008764ef8/1:1/w_160/Friday%20Forever_Everything%20Is%20Recorded.jpg,2020-04-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/everything-is-recorded-friday-forever/,XL,"The second album from XL Recordings boss Richard Russell as Everything Is Recorded is obsessed with ending from the moment it starts. Friday Forever chronologically documents a Friday night out, with track titles time-stamped to mark the journey from Uber to bathroom stall to hangover. Near the beginning of the album, drone-folk artist Maria Somerville intones, “The night won’t last forever.” Moments later, London singer and rapper Berwyn flips her ominous warning into a more upbeat refrain. The words appear again throughout the album, an effect that seeks to capture the underlying nihilism and mortality of nightlife. Russell is an expert on the subject of raving, as his time in 1990s electronic duo Kicks Like a Mule attests. But Friday Forever never quite sheds its inhibitions to achieve euphoria. Russell’s obsession with the fleeting nature of time also influenced a new composition process, one more fluid and spontaneous than his 2018 self-titled debut. He generated percussion on “10:51PM/The Night” by banging on the floor and banister of his recording studio, and the result is loose and urgent. But as a noted crate-digger, DJ, and co-founder of the label that brought the world Adele, the Prodigy, and Dizzee Rascal, Russell’s greatest talent is his ability to spot and nurture talent in others. On Friday Forever, he doesn’t just collate voices, but brings out an unfiltered, unrehearsed freshness. On “02:56AM/I Don’t Want This Feeling to Stop,” the magnetic south London MC Flohio semi-improvises over a twisted sample of reggae singer Mikey Dread’s “Dizzy,” hyping herself with off-the-cuff ad-libs. Friday Forever’s talent roster is younger and lesser-known than that of Everything Is Recorded, and the album is bolder and brighter for it. When Ghostface Killah shows up for a comical verse on “03:15AM/Caviar,” the effect is mildly jarring—his voice is too familiar, too weighty. Flohio and Mancunian rapper Aitch are deft and charismatic, but the record’s breakout star is Berwyn, a Trinidad-born, London-raised artist who has yet to release his own debut. At the album’s peak, “1:32AM/Walk Alone,” he weaves between Infinite Coles’ futuristic R&B stylings and Russell’s blown-out bass with lithe precision. The sheer number of collaborators, however, can make the record feel crowded. Russell finds beauty in the dissonance between them—there’s a quiet poignancy when Ghostface appears on the same track as his son, Infinite Coles, one delivering straightforward bars, the other drifting melodically in and out of falsetto. But elsewhere, it can feel scattershot. The universality of the concept—that anyone and everyone loves a Friday night out—breeds a lack of specificity. Irish singer Kean Kavanagh’s bleary-eyed hangover song and skit are charming, thanks to his breezy and unaffected performance, but the over-conceived storytelling feels hollow. So while wistful strings and the warm voice of Crass co-founder Penny Rimbaud on “11:59AM/Circles (Outro)” fulfill the narrative function of an album closer, as a piece of music, it feels thin. Rimbaud’s final meditation on the passage of time (“temporal... yet eternal”) doesn’t hit as hard as it could, considering how often we’ve heard that “the night won’t last forever.” There’s nothing spontaneous about a constant reminder to carpe diem. Likewise, Russell’s take on nightlife feels studied. For a man who’s lived and breathed rave culture, his album about the experience is strangely lacking in highs.","XL founder Richard Russell’s collaborative project brings out an unfiltered, unrehearsed freshness in its guests that the album can’t quite manage for itself.

T.V. Sun,Mosses,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8cae591e0eb90008b0fbc9/1:1/w_160/T.V.%20Sun_Mosses.jpg,2020-04-10 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mosses-tv-sun/,Anyway,"Ryan Jewell is a first-call utility player in the rock underground who has long shown flashes of all-star potential. But neither his extensive list of collaborations with Ryley Walker, Neil Hagerty, Steve Gunn, Psychedelic Horseshit, et al., nor his micro-indie releases, whether solo or with his band Mosses, can totally prepare you for the eclectic excellence he flexes on T.V. Sun. Intimations of T.V. Sun can be heard in the transcendently twangy, Sandy Bull-like “Mono Lake Improvisation,” from Mosses’ 2014 album Attic Dundee, and in the cosmic pastoralia/space-rock klang of 2015’s Ouroboros. But Jewell and main musical partner Danette Bordenkircher—who contributes piano, vocals, and flute to the new record—have polished their variegated influences into compositions that show a deep appreciation of ’70s subterranean rock and electronic music while flooding the stereo field with their own distinctive sounds. Their inspirations may not be a mystery, but Jewell and Bordenkircher’s musical taste is impeccable, and Mosses’ inventive song structures and tonal palette swiftly rebut any charges of derivativeness. “Tall Bearded Iris Speckled” raises the curtain on a band frolicking in verdant British prog-folk fields. After an intro of disorienting cascades of guitar, keyboards, and martial paradiddles, Jewell and Bordenkircher’s vocals evoke the archness of Tyrannosaurus Rex and Six Organs of Admittance. “There’s a lightness on the dark side of light/There’s a darkness on the light side of dark,” they sing, establishing their paradoxical, nature-observing bona fides. Eve Lenker’s fuzz bass and Jewell’s churchy organ lend the song the air of a Soft Machine fantasia. With brilliant perversity, Mosses follow with “T.V. Sun,” whose introverted, methodical funk comes riddled with scat vocals and skeletal drum machine, bolstered by chunky funk beats from Troy Kunkler that hark back to Can timekeeper Jaki Liebezeit at his early-’70s peak. Over this, Jewell’s glinting guitars speak in elliptical tongues. The song’s frequent structural morphing and textural variety epitomize Mosses’ approach—not in an ADHD manner, but rather as the product of restless, organic creativity. Mosses may be based in Highmount, New York, but their minds often flash back to ’70s Germany—a sage decision, musically speaking. “Time in Yer Mind” boasts the frightening propulsion of Can’s “Mother Sky” while also throwing in hysterical ululations that pay homage to the main riff of Pink Floyd’s “Astronomy Domine.” For good measure, they close the song with the sort of calamitous clangor that’s made Acid Mothers Temple a household name among LSD devotees. If you ever wanted to hear a Teutonic facsimile of the Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner,” “MSR” will satisfy you with its orotund motorik drums and controlled euphoria. It’s the album’s obvious single, quasi-jokey vocals and all. On “Ahh Auspicious,” Mosses strive for the grandeur of German kosmische-volk ensembles such as Emtidi and Between, attaining blissful elevation via Arjun Kulharya’s sitar and Bordenkircher and Meg Baird’s drifting vocal harmonies. LP closer “You Can’t Fall Off a Mountain” is a tangent from all that’s preceded it, even before Robbie Lee contributes an alto-flute solo that veers into the psych-jazz territory of Kraftwerk’s Florian Schneider-Esleben. Coupling the regimented arpeggios of Harald Grosskopf with the carbonated burbles of analog-synth madman Conrad Schnitzler, “Mountain” feels like T.V. Sun’s obvious highlight, without being ostentatious about it. The radical tone shifts on this album suggest the musicians are having great fun, and that infectiousness translates to the listener. It helps that Jewell packs so many ingenious ideas into each song that he makes many of his contemporaries seem like underachievers. T.V. Sun proves that not all musical nostalgias are created equal. As highbrow and esoteric as Mosses’ reference points are, the songs that spring from them express a vitality that bridges eras.","New York psych rocker Ryan Jewell channels the subterranean sounds of the ’70s—kosmische, prog folk, space rock—into infectious, wildly inventive songs.

Self Hate Wraith,Ghostie,by: Mano Sundaresan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8cc6f21a3ea30008764ef9/1:1/w_160/Self%20Hate%20Wraith_Ghostie.jpg,2020-04-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ghostie-self-hate-wraith/, 1504190 Records,"There’s no point trying to classify Ghostie’s music. A Venn diagram of the Baltimore rapper-producer’s influences would look like a Rorschach test. It’s best described using signifiers: an infernal sludge, a stuffy studio apartment, a deep-fried meme that reveals more about humanity than any painting in a museum could. This is the work of an artist whose biggest stated inspiration is System of a Down, whose SoundCloud-based group Anti-World is credited with inventing something called Trap Metal and absolutely hates the distinction, whose daily life for the past presidential administration has consisted of nothing but furiously recording and absorbing music of all flavors like an overheating machine, input and output meters peaking well past the red. This is also the work of a human: a father, a renter, a former alcoholic, a stressed and anxious city-dweller. Nowhere is that humanity more apparent than on his latest album Self Hate Wraith. Thanks to Ghostie’s improved writing and continued refinement of his wide-ranging palette, it’s his strongest release to date. Ghostie is an outsider. He maintains an enigmatic presence—you’ll only find a few interviews with him online—and his music is noisy and challenging. But part of the thrill of his work comes from not knowing what the track playing through your headphones will sound like in the next 45 seconds. The loud, clipping choruses congeal into towering pop hooks that feel more in the spirit of Panic! At The Disco than anything from rap’s last decade (in “Eshuned,” one of the best moments on Self Hate Wraith, Ghostie indulgently interpolates “Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off”). Ghostie is daring and unpredictable in the manner of his friend and collaborator JPEGMAFIA. Every album is overwhelming, every song is a calculated risk. On Self Hate Wraith, he continues his scorched-earth campaign against rap norms. Drum’n’bass, synth pop, emo rap, and indie rock are among the countless genres he mines across these 24 self-produced songs. For the most part, this is experimentation done right; the genres all feel lived-in, not beamed in, and Ghostie’s production is top-flight. The album opens with a searing three-song run that quickly covers three genres while laying out the thesis. “Why must I try? Why must I work?” Ghostie croons on “Crazy,” a pounding pop rap track that splits the difference between WorkingOnDying and early-2010s Kid Cudi. The change-ups can be blinding, especially for listeners primed for traditional rap, but the longer you spend with them, the more they click into place. Ghostie has grown into an impressive bluesman, flipping simple phrases into glowing screeds with his powerful, heavily processed vocals. He writes about the realities that millions of Americans face on a daily basis: feeling alone, fearing eviction,  love and loss and drinking and dinner tonight. Listen to how he repeats a single line—“No matter how much hurt, sing your song you’ll be all right”—on “Shame,” turning it into a numbing chant you might hear during the graveyard shift on an asteroid mining plant. “Think Bout It All The Time” is another exercise in repetition, this time over four-on-the-floor synthpop: “I think ’bout it all the time, it won’t go away.” Ghostie’s writing has a strong populist streak: You don’t need to know what he’s thinking about to know that you’ve probably thought about it, too. It’s the moments of catharsis that shine brightest. On the brash centerpiece of the album “Sizzle (I’m In Hell),” Ghostie growls something about oranges and potatoes from Blue’s Clues before delving into some of his most harrowing thoughts: isolation, getting kicked out on the 31st, guzzling whiskey and tequila and Sprite. Then another Blue’s Clues chorus, and then the second verse, a stumbling freestyle. It’s messy and brilliant, weirder and more honest than any of the rap music clogging Spotify’s paid-placement arteries. The more traditional cuts like “Hard Soft Taco” and “Hatsu” pale in comparison to the experiments. They’re awkwardly sandwiched together in the tracklist, revealing a sequencing issue that turns the album bloated in the second half.

Fodder on My Wings,Nina Simone,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8c97a1ecfafc0008428b22/1:1/w_160/Fodder%20On%20My%20Wings_Nina%20Simone.jpg,2020-04-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nina-simone-fodder-on-my-wings/,Verve,"“I’ll tell you what freedom is to me,” Nina Simone once said: “No fear.” If many of the most important records of the soul icon’s career were about political freedom, her 1982 album Fodder on My Wings, newly reissued, was about personal freedom—about liberating herself from her past and finding the liberty to create as she pleased. It was Simone’s means of working through fear—of death, manipulation, discrimination—in search of joy and self-discovery. A marvel of self-expression, Fodder on My Wings is a culmination of Simone’s frustrations molded into a jarring personal statement. At times manic, at times depressive, she shares many different sides of herself in vignettes that make up a portrait both intimate and immense. Although it does not achieve the unrivaled brilliance of the performances on her albums for Philips, it marks her creative apex as an artist, somehow both her most worldly and her most introspective work. Even in Simone biographies, Fodder on My Wings is usually represented as an outlier in her career. But it is a strange, captivating document that helped capture what a complicated person she was, the tumultuous life she’d led, and the nature of her travels. Some songs she sang in English, some in French, and on others she alternated between the two languages. The album contains some of the most poignant ballads of her entire catalog, some songs that could double as rallying cries, and others that feel like fun sketches made for her own amusement. It is a record as unsteady, daring, damaged, and sensational as she was. For a while, it didn’t seem like Simone would be back in a studio again. Her 1978 album Baltimore had soured her on the recording process. She butted heads with CTI producer Creed Taylor, recording all that record’s vocals in a single hour-long session on the final day of taping. “The material was not my personal choice, and I had no say whatsoever in the selection of songs. It was all done before I could make any decisions,” she later claimed. Simone was not fond of the album’s reggae-tinged sounds and rhythms (“What is this corny stuff,” she asked CTI arranger Dave Matthews). The album recreated songs by Randy Newman, Judy Collins, and Hall & Oates, and while it is often hailed as a late-career highlight, Simone said that she felt forced into making it. After the experience with CTI, Simone sought greater authority in recording Fodder on My Wings. She always exercised some measure of control over what she recorded, but this was different. She was adamant about composing and arranging nearly every song, and she wanted it known that she had done just that. She played all of the piano parts. She enlisted African percussionists Paco Sery and Sydney Thaim—who played congas, bells, timpani, and woodblock—and bassist Sylvin Marc. All three men sang backup. This band produced what Simone liked to call black classical music, parlor music which drew on soul sounds and calypso rhythms. It was the sound of her recent travels. The album’s title track puts this odyssey into perspective. Simone portrays herself as a bird that fell to Earth, landed in human debris, and was irrevocably changed. “Although it was able to survive, it couldn’t fly. So it walks from country to country to see if people had forgotten how to live, how to give,” she explained. “Most of the people had forgotten.” The metaphor was reflective of how Simone saw herself (a damaged songbird), the world (ungiving), and the world’s impact on her (harmful to her fragile psyche). Many of the album’s songs carry stories or lessons from this journey, things she’d picked up living in Switzerland, Liberia, and France. Simone had enormous respect for France and French people. In her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You, she described them as a people with “a lot of respect for serious artists” and Paris as a safe haven for African exiles. “I would be able to create my own Africa in the heart of Europe, Africa in my mind,” she imagined. After a rejuvenating trip in the 1970s to Liberia, Simone’s ancestral home, which was settled and made independent by free blacks from the American South, the singer had reconnected with her romanticized idea of Africa. But that Liberian pilgrimage produced a difficult loss, too: After Simone left, there was a coup in 1980, and her former lover, the local community leader C.C. Dennis, died of a heart attack two weeks after his son Cecil was executed by the military. The album is deeply touched by the experiences of these trips, full of African spirituals sung in French, musings on black spirituality and the hereafter, and attempts to recalibrate and recapture a glow lost in the wake of personal losses. “Fodder in Her Wings” is a song about this meandering journey to Africa with “dust inside her brain.” Simone takes a second crack at the hymn “There Is a Balm in Gilead”; the version on Baltimore, performed leisurely in English and like reggae, sucked the character out of her voice. As if to spite Taylor, “Il y a un baume à Gilead” maintains the island sway of the original but lines its edges with a more nuanced vocal take. She reintroduces the spiritual “Thandewye,” first recorded for the 1974 live album It is Finished, pushing even deeper into divinity. Simone’s voice could open the sky or scorch the earth. Despite reports that her vocal cords were decaying, her contralto described as having “deepened into a mannish baritone,” she had lost little of her power. Her own characterization, as recorded in the 2015 Netflix documentary, What Happened, Miss Simone?, was still more accurate: “Sometimes I sound like gravel and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.” In the lighter moments, the feathery French of “Gilead” or the crescendos of “I Sing Just to Know That I’m Alive,” she exudes grace and poise. In the dark ones, like “Thandewye,” she plays into the harshness of her tone. She is a master of dynamics, knowing when to hurt and when to heal. “What I did on this album was try to get myself deep into joy,” she wrote in the liner notes. On the triumphant opener “I Sing Just to Know That I’m Alive,” she reaffirms her belief in the sacred power of performing. The repeated refrain of “Color Is a Beautiful Thing” feels like something she’s trying to internalize, a coda to 1969’s “To Be Young, Gifted, and Black.” “Liberian Calypso” channels the night she felt most free, naked and drunkenly blissful, table-dancing her way through an African discotheque. All of these effervescent songs feel like they’re swirling around the tragedy at the heart of the record. At the center of the reissued Fodder on My Wings is “Alone Again Naturally,” Simone’s stripped-down response to Gilbert O’Sullivan’s 1972 hit of the same name, in which she recounts the events surrounding her father’s death a decade earlier. (Its place on the tracklist has shifted over the years.) She was glad to learn he was dying: he had betrayed her when she needed him most, and in dying he’d taken her mother with him. Suddenly, the song grows somber, and in the closing minute, she reveals that losing this man was, in fact, a devastating blow. No one was closer to her. No one else understood her. She points to his loss as the impetus for all subsequent struggles. The specter of his death casts a pall over the album’s pursuit of joy. One moment, her father’s death makes her question God’s existence; the next, when singing a reassuring song her father introduced her to (“Heaven Belongs to You”), she embraces heavenly salvation. This is the push and pull throughout the album: the weight of pain and the beauty of faith. Together, all these songs become a memoir. She wasn’t just singing to know that she was alive; she sang also to reflect on how she’d lived and what she might learn from it. The haunting piano solo “Le peuple en Suisse” revisits her time in Switzerland, among a people she believed to be cold, but not before waxing poetic about moving forward. “Let no one deceive you/You have so little time/So let the corpses molder/To live your life is bolder/To waste it is a crime,” she sings, as though trying to convince herself. She didn’t want to be trapped, least of all in her role as performer. Nina Simone spent much of her life on stage, and it was in those moments that she really seemed to become the High Priestess of Soul, but by the 1980s, her shows had developed a reputation for devolving into chaos as much as for achieving excellence. “Her performances have the aura of sacramental rites, in which a priestess and her flock work to establish a mystical communion,” wrote the critic Stephen Holden in 1983, during her first show back in the States to perform songs from the album. As if cognizant of such a spiritual relationship with her audience, there’s “Vous êtes seuls, mais je désire être avec vous” (You are alone, but I want to be with you), a song that seemed to be an olive branch to crowds around the world. She chants the phrase over and over until the words completely disarm and overwhelm, until she felt exonerated. (Nicole Cerf-Hofstein wrote that, for many in attendance when Simone first performed the song at the New Morning, it was “a missed rendezvous.”) The song seems indicative of her ongoing battle to overcome both internal and external demons. Even her deepest explorations of self were made in conversation with her public. Simone was privy to the way the world at large saw her and sought to sideline her, as evidenced in songs like “I Was Just a Stupid Dog to Them” and “They Took My Hand,” but she was optimistic she could make a better future by learning from the past. “Now, everything will change!” she exclaims on the former; “You took my teeth/You took my brains/You try to drive me so insane/And now you’re trying to take my eyes/But it is finished/Because I’m too wise,” she sings on the latter. With Fodder on My Wings, she found new freedom in song, seeking out new heights as she left her fears far below.","Long considered an outlier in her catalog, Nina Simone’s newly reissued 1982 album is an intimate and immense portrait, a culmination of Nina Simone’s frustrations molded into a jarring personal statement.

Southside,Sam Hunt,by: Natalie Weiner,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b86ff7a26ca0008c5213b/1:1/w_160/SOUTHSIDE_Sam%20Hunt.jpg,2020-04-09 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-hunt-southside/,MCA Nashville ,"For a clean-cut white guy who plays acoustic guitar and sings commercial country, Sam Hunt has recently become one of the most polarizing artists to emerge from the Nashville machine. His coup began six years ago when he staged the velvetiest of revolutions, wresting country radio away from the bro-country tailgaters and hidebound schlock-slingers with his triple-platinum debut Montevallo. Brushed with hints of hip-hop, R&B, and Top-40 smooth country melodies, Montevallo was successful to the point of nearly paralyzing its star: It’s taken more than a half-decade for him to concoct a follow-up. The album also incited a backlash among country purists, which Hunt fueled with unthinkable provocations like wearing a flat-brimmed hat and singing Drake’s “Marvin’s Room” at his shows. Those alarmists had little to fear besides the onset of what some have called “boyfriend country”—mostly populated by saccharine artists who attempt to channel Hunt’s earnest charm without his flair for experimentation. But Hunt is, finally, back, seemingly aiming to both prove his country cred and guard his status as one of the genre’s innovators. Southside is a
variation on Montevallo’s theme, not a reinvention—but if anything, it shows a clarity of purpose that his debut lacked. Hunt pulls in both directions at once, building seemingly endless layers of traditional country cues (fiddle, banjo, dobro) over a syncopated pulse that permeates almost the entire album. The way he threads the country/hip-hop needle is enviably organic, a sly but effective repudiation of his critics. Southside’s first two songs establish the tension that makes the album so compelling. The mournful ballad “2016” is as traditional as they come, with its finger-picked guitar and talk of whiskey-laced sorrow. It’s the first of a few gutting tracks on the album about his now-wife Hannah Lee Fowler, whom he left to pursue music and then had to woo back—a situation that, unmediated, sounds like a country song in itself. He’s seen the error of his ways: “It turns out going out and chasing dreams and lonely women ain’t freedom after all,” he sings over a wailing pedal steel. But his self-serious balladry is immediately tempered by the lilting “Hard To Forget,” where samples of a classic country song (Webb Pierce’s 1953 hit “There Stands The Glass”) weave into a bouncy beat complete with stuttering hi-hats. It’s on “Hard To Forget” that Hunt lays out the album’s overall style. Instead of using the massive resources available to him as a marquee act on a major label to ramp up the accessibility and polish, he layers songs with pleasantly casual licks, countermelodies, and even muffled conversation. Additional vocal tracks occasionally make it sound like bystanders are singing along—maybe “Downtown’s Dead,” as he sings on one of the project’s early singles, but Southside still channels the ease and conviviality of a Broadway honky-tonk. Those experiments tie together moody R&B ballad “Nothing Lasts Forever” which features both Vocoder-like effects and a synthy guitar riff, and the raucous “Let It Down,” whose trap-bluegrass core was inspired in part, Hunt says, by Ken Burns’ Country Music docuseries. On “Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90’s,” one of the album’s highlights, that same hip-hop-dusted backbeat supports a fittingly retro country lament about a very 21st-century problem: trying to get over someone whose Instagram Stories you can’t stop watching (the “dying on my phone” flip is particularly smart). That it feels uncontrived is refreshing in a sea of ready-made Music City soundalikes. Hunt takes more risks when indulging his Drakiest tendencies. On “That Ain’t Beautiful,” he laments the decisions of some wayward but disarmingly familiar, woman (one would never imagine “You can split an Adderall with a stranger in a bathroom stall” crooned so sweetly) to a point that’s patronizing, if seemingly well-intentioned; on “Drinkin’ Too Much,” he apologizes to Fowler in an occasionally slurry monologue—she’s responsible for its conclusion, a simple piano rendition of the hymn “How Great Thou Art.” They’re odd songs, anomalies on an album that for all of its subtle risks remains mostly approachable enough for a country radio playlist. But a little off-center is exactly what commercial country, with its endless aesthetic complacency, so desperately needs. And Southside’s experiments are made with enviable effortlessness: It’s a little rough around the edges, not self-consciously provocative. Hunt doubled down on his initial mission—making hip-hop and R&B in country sound hip instead of hokey—and it paid off with this collection of songs that are, more than anything else, fun. He proved, once again, that those genres are only as disparate as music marketers would have you believe, and that there’s still plenty more fruit to be borne of their inevitable cross-pollination.","The Nashville star blends genres with charm and style on his first new album in five years, a marker of what modern commercial country can do at its heights.

Sigma Oasis,Phish,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8c9bc0e21e4f0009eaf043/1:1/w_160/Sigma%20Oasis_Phish.jpg,2020-04-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phish-sigma-oasis/,Jemp,"Something interesting happens halfway through “Everything’s Right,” a 12-minute track on Sigma Oasis. For a while, it’s everything you might expect from a Phish record nearly 40 years into their career: an intentionally mind-numbing chorus (“Everything’s right/So just hold tight”) set to a melody that cycles between sunny major chords like a beach ball infinitely bobbing through a crowd of outstretched arms. It’s light and goofy—sorta funky. But then it shifts. Around the five-minute mark, after Trey Anastasio finishes a polite vamp on the word “alright,” he kicks off a guitar solo. Page McConnell follows on the organ. Soon, the whole band is in on it, listening intently to one another and changing shape, one note at a time. Suddenly, Phish is jamming, and you’re right there with them. On a studio record by this band, it sounds like a total breakthrough. For longer than most groups have been around, the accepted wisdom was that Phish were unable to capture their spontaneous energy off the stage. Combined with their unremarkable songwriting, this failure has resulted in a discography that feels secondary to their actual legacy, best understood through decades of bootlegs, and even better by attending one of their inventive, Odyssean live shows. Maybe their last album, 2016’s obnoxious Big Boat, was rock bottom, the moment they knew something had to change. Maybe veteran producer Bob Ezrin, who departed after helming their past few releases, was to blame. Maybe Anastasio’s solo detour with Ghosts of the Forest was an actual creative reckoning as depicted in 2019’s fawning documentary, Between Me and My Mind. Whatever the case, Sigma Oasis is a pleasant surprise, a small joy, an unlikely course correction. Its success is also the result of several smart creative decisions. The first was to bring these songs on the road for a couple years before solidifying them. The practice shows; these performances are lived-in and confident, at turns adventurous and refined. The second good idea was to limit the tracklist to just nine songs, all contributions from Anastasio and lyricists Tom Marshall and Scott Herman, with none of the failed experiments and pastiches that drag down nearly all their other albums. The third good idea was to keep the sessions brief and in-house: the whole album was recorded in just one week at Anastasio’s Vermont studio. The plan was to rehearse for their upcoming tour but they quickly realized there was something worth documenting. They trusted their first takes. They had fun. Sigma Oasis cruises in the relaxed, muted groove this band has settled into over the past few years. None of these songs are new territory for them—the crunchy escapism of the title track, the rock opera Hallmark card of “A Life Beyond the Dream”—but they top anything they’ve recorded in the past decade-and-a-half by capturing their comfortable dynamic with a positivity that radiates from every note. Along the way, they nod to the stylistic diversions that pop up in their live shows: intricate prog (“Mercury”), Zappa freakouts (“Thread”), singing-in-the-shower balladry (“Leaves”), sci-fi atmospherics (the final moments of “Everything’s Right”). You can listen from beginning to end and get a sense of the buoyant, utopian universe they create when they’re playing at their best. And as jam band culture seeps into indie music and beyond, it’s a more concise introduction to their current state of euphoria than, say, a 36-disc box set. Of course, there will always be people for whom Phish are irredeemable—the punchline in the great joke that is music fandom. Maybe you will tap out by the third time Anastasio tells you that “the tomb of the red queen is painted in vermilion” in “Mercury.” Maybe it’ll be when Page grabs the mic to sing a sad little verse near the beginning of “Leaves.” Maybe it will be during the breakdown in “Thread” that sounds like the house band at a suburban planetarium soundtracking their Halloween light show. These moments are ridiculous—but there’s also triumph in them. Part of the joy in Sigma Oasis is how Phish have learned to bridge their absurd side and their tasteful side, acknowledging that their best ideas have always lurked just one measure ahead of their dumbest ones. Credit also goes to Vance Powell’s production that seems more influenced by soundboard recordings than the slick, big-budget rock albums that this band will never successfully make. Not everything works. The studio version of “Mercury” fails to live up to the marathon renditions they’ve been playing on tour. And at 11 minutes, “Thread” closes the album by overstaying its welcome with a lurching, menacing coda that punctuates an otherwise uplifting record like a question mark. Plus, there are those lyrics I mentioned earlier from “Everything’s Right” and plenty of others that wouldn’t fare much better printed out of context. But these are minor complaints. “When we recorded the album, we didn’t plan to release it this way,” Phish announced after debuting it with little warning during an April Fools livestream. “But today, because of the environment we’re all in, it just feels right.” This deep into their career, most bands could do a lot worse than sticking together, looking inward, and following their instincts. The rest, they have time to figure out.","Phish’s instinctive new studio album is a pleasant surprise, a small joy, and an unlikely course correction.

BRAT,NNAMDÏ,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8c9fefecfafc0008428b25/1:1/w_160/BRAT_Nnamdi%CC%88.jpg,2020-04-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nnamdi-brat/,Sooper,"The first thing to know about the music of NNAMDÏ is that he has a million vehicles for it. The multi-instrumentalist, singer, and rapper born (and formerly known as) Nnamdi Ogbonnaya jumps at every opportunity. He’s a label head. He’s a gifted instrumental polyglot. He’s stylistically ravenous: two of his many side gigs include drumming in mind-warping time signatures for an instrumental math-rock band and playing bass and singing backup in another known for plainspoken poignancy and extremely simple parts. His holistic hustle has earned him widespread admiration among DIY peers in Chicago; when Melkbelly got a call to open for Foo Fighters at Wrigley Field, their singer wore a NNAMDÏ T-shirt. The second thing to know about the music of NNAMDÏ is that he sings with the patternless precision of a Whac-A-Mole champion. He bounds deliriously between voices and phrasing styles, up and down his vocal register, as if alter egos are fighting over the controls. It’s a universal accelerant: It conveys both a sort of invincibility when he sounds ecstatic and of unraveling when he sounds tortured. On BRAT, the latest of several albums released under variations of his own name, his internal deliberations grapple over ego, selfishness, and the gift or indulgence of a life devoted to art. “I’m a big brat/I can’t pick a side,” he sings, with an audible grin. Hearing all of this materialize into NNAMDÏ’s most ambitious album is exciting, but not always fun. The moments when he sounds invincible give way to equally intense self-doubts, and his songs overflow with confessional lyrics. “Bullseye” lands the album’s first instant hook, a short blast of Vitamin D that exists on an astral plane inhabited by Tierra Whack and maybe no one else. But as quickly as it hits, it withdraws on “Everyone I Loved,” where NNAMDÏ laments drifting apart from his family, who are “all having trouble understanding why I chose this route.” (The son of Nigerian immigrants, including a double PhD holder, NNAMDÏ earned a degree in electrical engineering and has discussed in interviews how his restless ambition is connected to his upbringing.) “Everything I loved now turns me off,” he sings in an Earth, Wind & Fire falsetto, up until that last word, which he drops with a spiritless thud. BRAT opens acoustically, closes thunderously, and along the way squirms across ground-scraping beats, twinkling guitars, and most sounds in between. It’s sure to divide listeners who tend towards maximalism from those who don’t, and it certainly provokes questions about what gets lost in genre fusion. But NNAMDÏ’s constant dissatisfaction with any one sound leaves no question that his true colors are loud and clashing, and he’s not afraid to admit to uncertainty. This is what’s powerful about the final two tracks of BRAT, where a longer arc starts to take form. On “It’s OK” and “Salut,” he stands still, straightens his spine, and lets out an overdue exhale. “There’s no need to pretend you’re OK if you’re not,” he concludes, finally sounding satisfied. NNAMDÏ is a clear natural talent, and also a malfunctioning fountain of ideas spraying in every direction. In saying a million things, BRAT doesn’t quite say any one bold thing. Most of NNAMDÏ’s recorded work has sounded like this—occasionally overwhelming and alienating—but sooner or later, he’s likely to focus all of these ideas into a tighter-tuned vision and construct a masterpiece. The singular voice, the personal rawness, and the sheer skill for craft are all there on BRAT, ready to snap together.","The Chicago singer and multi-instrumentalist leaps fearlessly between voices and sounds.

I’m Your Empress Of,Empress Of,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b566be21e4f0009eaf03b/1:1/w_160/I%E2%80%99m%20Your%20Empress%20Of_Empress%20Of.jpg,2020-04-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/empress-of-im-your-empress-of/,Terrible,"Lorely Rodriguez has created an album that moves like oil in water. I’m Your Empress Of is more elegantly constructed and beats-focused, yet no less imaginative than the noise-pop wedgie she gave listeners on her 2015 debut Me. Muffled snatches of chatter, the voice of Rodriguez’s own mother, and a zesty club pulse bind the 12 tracks of her third album together to create a short, ambitious song cycle that reinstates Rodriguez among electronic pop’s auteurs. Empress Of’s scattered previous album, 2018’s Us, took two and a half years and a cast of collaborators to make. In contrast, all but two of I’m Your Empress Of’s songs were produced and written by Rodriguez alone over two feverish months. Reeling from a recent break-up and the zig-zagging adrenaline of a relentless tour schedule, Rodriguez would wake early and set to work in her home studio in Los Angeles, using songwriting to release trauma and confusion. In purging emotional extremes, Rodriguez rises from the embers of heartbreak to hit on a personal and artistic truth: She is better off alone. Thriving in solitude is cause for celebration, as a triumvirate of bangers makes clear. “Bit Of Rain,” the album’s first track proper, is a stormy flirtation with trap snares and imagistic fragments. “You closed your eyes/Heavy blinds to a house/I want everything inside to spill out,” she sings, like Pablo Neruda at the club. At other times, she is more direct. In the chorus, a forthright declaration is accompanied by a clap of thunder: “I want you under me.” Even more carefree is “Love Is A Drug,” a breathless, buoyant ode to carnal hedonism, while the dancefloor confection “U Give It Up” (produced by Jim-E Stack) feels like a poison-pinkie text dashed off to an ex on the way to the dancefloor. “When something bites/You pull back scared to fight,” Rodriguez intones. You can imagine her raising her hands to laser lights as she sings. I’m Your Empress Of is a vivisection of heartache, as if Rodriguez is working through the five stages of grief in real-time. She beats herself up for her choices in “Should’ve” among blasts of static and high-pitched squeaks that sound like a moth’s legs stuck in molten rubber. At its most extreme, her self-examination evokes violence. “I get off on being awful to myself,” Rodriguez sings plainly in the album closer “Awful,” in which sharp thwacks bring to mind the slam of flesh into metal. “I need some help.” It’s a chilling moment delivered with flair, the kind of eureka moment that could take a year of therapy to hit on. While poring over I’m Your Empress Of’s lyrics suggests an author with fresh wounds, the album is also a showcase for Rodriguez’s production abilities at this new peak. The lead single, “Give Me Another Chance,” is a rush of Eurodance, and in the balearic-inspired mid-tempo “Void,” Rodriguez Auto-Tunes her vocals to suggest weightlessness, her ennui dusted with clouds of powdered sugar. “What’s The Point,” is shot through with pitter-patters of drum’n’bass percussion, and you can imagine the song’s thick, creeping bass whipping crowds into a frenzy at a festival (failing that in the foreseeable future, your living room speakers will do the trick). In the hands of a less sure-handed artist the whiplash between emotional extremes could be jarring, but Rodriguez makes it feel delightfully dizzying. What is life in the digital age if not a constant pinball between joy and despair? One of Rodriguez’s earliest ambitions as Empress Of was to be “weird.” The first music she shared was a homemade series of wonky electronic oddities titled Color Minutes, but by the time of her second album, she was drawing from the high gloss hip-pop of Ariana Grande. Yet the creative furrow she finds on I’m Your Empress Of is enriched by Rodriguez looking closer to home, an impulse literalized with the inclusion of spoken-word passages delivered by her mom, Reina, a first-generation immigrant from Honduras. Reina’s unguided reflections move from proud messages of survival to love and femininity, providing a guiding light while foregrounding the album as in conversation with shared Latinx immigrant histories. “It was not easy speaking English,” Reina says on the album intro, after Rodriguez plays a bright salsa piano line that she learned from her father. “It was not easy having to learn it,” continues Reina. “But I got it.” I’m Your Empress Of vibrates with the contradictions that one person can contain: how mourning the loss of a partner is bound up with anger, the fatigue of resilience, and the pleasures to be found in escaping it all, if only for one lusty night. With unexpected production and left-field samples, Rodriguez’s album is powered by a heady rawness that bucks the trend for theatrical concepts in today’s electronic pop nonconformists, producing epiphanies like hot stones spat from a fire. You could say it is as addictive as modern love.","Lorely Rodriguez’s third album, largely written and produced alone, refocuses her voice into an emotionally and aesthetically rich album of heartbreak, family history, and pop delights.

Pray 4 Love,Rod Wave,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b8531ffd4cb0008aae7f0/1:1/w_160/Pray%204%20Love_Rod%20Wave.jpg,2020-04-08 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rod-wave-pray-4-love/,AlamoGeffen,"In the months since Rod Wave’s breakout album Ghetto Gospel, the St. Petersburg-born rapper’s life has changed. He went on tour with Kevin Gates; Meek Mill called him his therapist; and he released a Cole Bennett-directed music video. But even as his profile grows, his music remains drenched in misery; Pray 4 Love, his new album, is more bleak than anything he’s made before. In an interview discussing the recording process of the project, Rod Wave said he laid down the vocals in a dark hotel room with nobody else but his engineer. If you didn’t listen closely enough to his 2019 debut LP, you might think it was recorded in the piano room of a church. It’s a soulful record with constant mentions of faith, but it’s not exactly religious. Instead, he makes songs about pain, heartbreak, trauma, and turning to religion as a last resort, made digestible with catchy songwriting and choir-ready vocals that separate him from others in the South and Midwest making similarly hopeless music. But sometimes Pray 4 Love can be overwhelming. At its worst, it’s like reading someone’s college admission essay, where all of their life struggles are squeezed into a couple hundred words: On “I Remember,” his father goes to prison; he confesses his love to someone; he cries when it goes unreciprocated; he goes to prison; his mother cries; his friend stabs him in the back over money, and so on. It’s a running list of traumatic events with the goal of making you feel sorry for him, but pity is not what makes Rod Wave’s songs work. At their most effective, they have the raw immediacy of someone going to confession for the first time. Notably, at three and a half minutes, “I Remember” is the album’s longest song. Rod Wave’s best tracks rarely cross the three-minute mark, typically a single pain-filled verse bookended by an agonized chorus. “Fuck the World” follows that blueprint here, with Rod Wave biting off the ends of his consonants and sounding on the brink of a breakdown: “Said you wouldn’t leave, but you left like I expected/I opened up ’bout my pain, now I regret it,” he belts. If it weren’t for the trap drums, the melancholy pianos and gloomy electric riffs would land squarely in country-ballad territory. Rod Wave’s songwriting has its flaws. Occasionally it’s unnecessarily melodramatic: he acts like he’s scarred from having to wake up early to catch the school bus and working at a donut shop as a teenager. But when the writing is sharp, and often it is, his lyrics hit hard enough to bring your own buried pain right to the surface. “I need some happiness again, this life done beat on me/I caught a flight to ease the pain, I switched the scenery,” he sings bluntly on “Ribbon in the Sky.” It’s straightforward and complicated; unpolished and imperfect; all of which makes the painful emotion on Pray 4 Love feel genuine even as his life changes.","Even as the Floridian crooner becomes a breakout star, his music remains bleak and filled with pain.

1988,Knxwledge,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b8a9d743ae60008d9dde8/1:1/w_160/1988_Knxwledge.jpg,2020-04-08 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knxwledge-1988/,Stones Throw,"Knxwledge is known for his omnivorous sampling and a work ethic that’s produced a scrollbar-shrinking Bandcamp page, but the L.A. producer is also a lover of mischief. “I kinda just test limits on how funky or smooth you can make some, like, super hood rap shit about shooting people in the face,” he once summarized. That playful approach characterizes 1988, billed as Knxwledge’s second album despite being the latest splash in an ocean of releases. The record is a fog of samples and clips warped into peculiar shapes that defy recognition but prickle with familiarity, like memories from a past life. In terms of method, 1988 is virtually no different from the beat tapes and mixes Knxwledge releases with the regularity of software patches, but its warm, teasing aura sets it somewhat apart. Named after the year he was born and filled with pop culture ephemera like soundbites from Cooley High and radio interviews, 1988 celebrates Knxwledge’s origins and fixations. There’s always been a strong sense of nostalgia to his work, but he has an agnostic’s ability to cherish the past while shaping it to his needs. This is the mood throughout 1988. On opener “dont be afraid” Knxwledge snips ’90s R&B group Kut Klose’s “Surrender” into a sensuous, yearning loop. “Don’t be afraid of the way you feel,” the group sings, their voices altered to waft over snappy percussion. For “amansloveislife_keepon,” another Kut Klose flip, Knxwledge rearranges the groove of “Keep On” around the instrumentation instead of the group’s harmonies. It's a simple change, but it unlocks the funk embedded in the song, which itself samples Patrice Rushen’s “Remind Me.” It feels less like a tweak than a correction. While he’s clearly a student of J Dilla and Madlib, Knxwledge distinguishes himself with his special attention to the contours of the human voice. The feathery keys and faint percussion on “watchwhoukallyourhomie,” a flip of an old Meek Mill freestyle, trace the edges of Meek’s buoyant yelps, matching his bobs and weaves. Likewise, the soured horns of “solivelife” drift around a helium-laced Anderson .Paak vocal, freeing the crooner’s voice to drag and spill across measures. Knxwledge seems endlessly fascinated by the voice’s ability to spawn new rhythms or bind disparate ones together. That said, while the loops and beats of 1988 are as hypnotic and outre as ever, other than the cleared samples and elevated sense of personality, there’s not enough about 1988 that distinguishes it from, say, WT15.8_, released a week before, or that rises to the devil-may-care attitude of Knxwledge’s Vimeo page. Read in sequence, the song titles spell out a mission statement of sorts, but the music here is ultimately standard Knxwledge. Knxwledge remains a distinctive and prolific sculptor of sounds, but consistency alone feels like a low bar to clear, especially for an artist with such reverence for the infinite forms music can take.","The L.A. producer’s music is a fog of samples and clips warped into peculiar shapes that defy recognition but prickle with familiarity, like memories from a past life.

Hot and Flustered,Cold Meat,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8c8d34ffd4cb0008aae7f5/1:1/w_160/Hot%20and%20Flustered_Cold%20Meat.jpg,2020-04-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cold-meat-hot-and-flustered/,Static Shock,"The short catalog of Australian punks Cold Meat reads like a series of dirty little jokes. There’s the band name, which brings to mind damp bologna slices; their equally unappetizing 2018 EP Pork Sword Fever; and their 2016 7"" Jimmy’s Lipstick—Jimmy being drummer Charlotte Thorne’s dog, and his lipstick being… well, you can probably figure that out. But the Perth four-piece are advocates of rage as much as lewd humor. The band’s debut LP Hot and Flustered is 23 caustic minutes of punk rock so corrosive it threatens to melt your AirPods. Across 10 clipped tracks, lead screamer Ashley Ramsey takes aim at star signs, ZZ Top, and music industry execs—perhaps the kind that self-isolate on their superyachts. Backed by a simple triad of guitar, bass, and drums, Ramsey spares none of them. On “Women’s Work,” she weaponizes the fed-up housewife: “Morning tea and lunch is packed/Her husband is a lazy prat,” she shouts, spitting in his food for good measure. “She’s got better things to do than cook and clean up after you!” It’s as if Betty Draper had bulldozed her house and recorded a punk song standing atop the rubble. Ramsey has many bones to pick throughout Hot and Flustered, but on opening track “Piscies Crisies” her beef is with the astrology revival. She recalls being “lost in a fog” and weeping at the supermarket, wishing she had answers. When she cries “blame it on Mercury!/blame it on Jupiter!” she’s being sarcastic, mocking those who do put faith in the stars—yet she seems envious, too, of the calm that faith might offer. You just can picture her kicking over an entire rack of Cosmo in frustration. Cold Meat’s sense of humor is what saves them from the trappings of self-serious street punk, but it’s Ramsey’s outrage that keeps their blood pumping. Her voice—sometimes shrill and squeaky, otherwise coarse and phlegm-flecked—sets Cold Meat apart from the swarm of punk revivalists. It’s not that she’s pioneered a new style of singing (we might credit Ari Up and Crass’ Eve Libertine), but her fierce conviction makes it fresh. Cold Meat’s musical arrangement, however, doesn’t do much to rejuvenate the genre. Guitarist Kyle Gleadell and bassist Tim Guthrie deliver the requisite distortion and feedback in a capacity that doesn’t outshine Ramsey, but doesn’t exactly push the envelope, either. Cold Meat appear more interested in recording immediate, energetic punk rock than becoming experimentalists, and they’ve certainly nailed the former. Oddly enough, Hot and Flustered’s standout track is its most melodic and least expected. “Beach Photography” drags climate deniers and their bogus evidence: “If you have some time to browse my beach photography you’ll see the water levels aren’t on the rise,” Ramsey shouts, as if unveiling Exhibit A, her Instagram account. We’ve all met these people, whether online or at Thanksgiving, and Ramsey’s ability to personify an opposing political standpoint helps her steer clear of cheesy punk protest territory. It’s a surprising display of restraint from the band who recorded “Meat Joy”—but Cold Meat have much more than shock value on their mind.","The Perth punks are more interested in recording immediate, energetic punk rock than becoming experimentalists, and they’ve certainly nailed the former.

It Is What It Is,Thundercat,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b38abffd4cb0008aae7e9/1:1/w_160/It%20Is%20What%20It%20Is_Thundercat.jpg,2020-04-07 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thundercat-it-is-what-it-is/,Brainfeeder,"Thundercat the bassist and Thundercat the lyricist arise from separate sides of Stephen Bruner’s brain. The former is a fleet-fingered virtuoso, plucking out lines as dazzling and complex as a star system. The words on top of those basslines, meanwhile, are far less methodical, fraught with hazy existential questions, references to getting so smashed he can’t find his shoes, and shout-outs to his cat. Together, they form songs that sound equally enchanting and unfinished, frivolous and deep. Drunk, his 2017 opus, effortlessly toed the line between Bruner as mighty bandleader and introverted doodler, with immense funk grooves slotted next to sonnets about feeling strange. It Is What It Is could serve as a companion piece to Drunk, even though it arrives more than three years later. Bruner is still getting tipsy and pondering what waits for us in the beyond. There’s growth and acceptance in that wonder—the title suggests as much— but not necessarily in the songwriting. The album lacks the anchoring power of a full-bodied jam like “Them Changes,” “Heartbreaks + Setbacks,” or even his 2011 George Duke cover “For Love I Come,” leaving us lost inside Bruner’s mind. That isn’t always a bad place to be. “I Love Louis Cole” (featuring—who else?—Brainfeeder artist Louis Cole) could score the Willy Wonka Tunnel Of Terror with its ominous strings and increasingly wild-sounding drums. It ends abruptly, just as Wonka’s boat trip does, on an orchestral flourish. On the other end of the spectrum, “King Of The Hill” is the most pared-down we’ve heard Bruner in a while, as he hums over a refreshingly simple and spooky beat made with the help of Flying Lotus and BADBADNOTGOOD. His bass playing remains captivating. “Unrequited Love” opens with a swirl of strums and intricate jazz fills before giving way to a reverberant instrumental accentuated by heavy snares. “Funny Thing” highlights his trademark low-pass Moog tone, which he’s honed to imitate the croak of the oldest and nastiest-looking toad you could imagine. And “How Sway” is a masterclass in lightspeed chord changes. But “How Sway” also features two words total—“ayy” and “yo”—which indicates how unpolished some of these compositions feel. “How I Feel” starts off promising, with a subtle bass melody, lovely bell plinks, and a magnetic synth line, but it stays in place for the rest of its brief runtime. On “Overseas,” dippy lyrics about meeting up with a woman in Russia and joining the “mile-high club” on the plane ride stumble into a clip of comedian Zach Fox imitating an airline captain—funny, but not necessarily compelling. Singer Michael McDonald, who collaborated with Bruner and Kenny Loggins on 2017’s gleaming “Show You The Way,” recently told the New York Times that Bruner reminds him of Steely Dan’s Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, who were “Top 40 radio darlings” but also had songs that were “so strange, and so sophisticated.” Here, Bruner has the attitude and the aptitude, but he’s mostly missing the songs. “Fair Chance” comes close, with its weightless keyboards, gentle drums, and heartbroken hook about loving someone even though they’re not around—a reference to the late rapper Mac Miller, with whom Bruner was extremely close. But despite its sincerity and strong guest spot from Ty Dolla $ign, the song slides off the rails when a well-intentioned (but struggling) Lil B warbles out a shaky final verse. “Black Qualls” cooks along with a groove featuring ’80s boogie figurehead Steve Arrington, but loses its momentum midway through. Then there’s “Dragonball Durag,” the most effortless song here. Over a breezy beat featuring a billowing saxophone provided by longtime friend and collaborator Kamasi Washington, Bruner sings playfully to a girl about his silky headscarf. It’s undeniably silly (“I may be covered in cat hair, but I still smell good,” he purrs) but also feels complete, one of those moments where Bruner’s goofiness complements his musical prowess. There’s evidence to suggest he can do this when he wants; there’s also plenty to suggest the contrary.","Three years after his 2017 opus Drunk, Stephen Bruner returns with more fleet-fingered jams and abstracted musings, this time a little more unpolished.

If You’re Dreaming,Anna Burch,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b45ff7e389600087ed21f/1:1/w_160/If%20You%E2%80%99re%20Dreaming_Anna%20Burch.jpg,2020-04-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anna-burch-if-youre-dreaming/,Polyvinyl,"From the outset of If You’re Dreaming, Anna Burch sounds deliberate. The steady pace of opening track “Can’t Sleep” is a confident introduction to a new sound: one sparser, lonelier, and more patient than the jittery folk-pop songs of her 2018 solo debut, Quit the Curse. On her second album, Burch is more confident, even as her subject matter becomes more introspective. The wordless, uplifting chorus of “Can’t Sleep,” a song about insomnia, stretches out like a long road ahead. It’s a strong new direction for the Detroit singer-songwriter, though it doesn’t always maintain the same momentum. Where Burch’s debut often layered her vocals with scratchy guitar riffs to evoke 1960s girl-group harmonies, If You’re Dreaming mellows out the sound. Burch takes a more stripped-back approach, soaking her voice in echo. The image of her sitting beneath a spotlight, alone on stage—as in the Scorsese-inspired video for “Tell Me What’s True”—lingers in the mind’s eye. Over that song’s doleful electric piano, Burch leans into the foreground so that you can’t miss the candor of her lyrics: “When I used to hate myself/I saw things so clearly.” Likewise, the sense of social anxiety she evokes on the bluesy, mournful “Go It Alone” is heightened by how starkly her voice seems to stand on the fringes of the party. Just as spending a lot of time in your own company gives small interactions a feeling of outsize significance, the record’s pared-back palette allows the tiniest variations to feel startling and fresh. When the woodwind flutters on the interlude “Keep It Warm,” or when a second vocal track enters on “Every Feeling,” it hits like a stiff breeze. A subtle swell of saxophone lifts “Not So Bad,” a dreamy soft-rock tune about admitting you enjoy someone’s company; it might easily have tipped over into schmaltz, but Burch masterfully keeps the mood light-hearted and restrained. That deliberate simplicity doesn’t make for a consistently invigorating listen. The second half sinks into a slower pace after “Keep It Warm,” while Burch’s lyrics shift from dwelling on anxiety towards an acceptance of her lonely, quiet state. An extra interlude, the fuzzy “Picture Show,” only slows the momentum further. “Here With You,” the album closer, is serene and slight, and nowhere near as satisfying as the richer, angstier first half. But what resonates most is the clarity of Burch’s emotional world. The lyrics of her debut were tantalisingly guarded, offsetting the drama of her melodies with wry one-liners. That humor still lives in If You’re Dreaming—it’s there in the nonchalant shrug of the title “Not So Bad” and in her resigned cry of “I’m so tired” on the sunny “Party’s Over”—but like the overall tone of the record, it’s softer. In Burch’s minimalist musical landscape, each lyric she pushes to the foreground becomes loaded with meaning. It’s as though she’s smiling knowingly as she sings, while also feeling every word.","The Detroit singer-songwriter’s second album is sparser, lonelier, and more patient, allowing the candor of her lyrics to shine through.

Window In,Michael Vallera,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e875c537f98dd0008c3df41/1:1/w_160/Window%20In_Michael%20Vallera.jpg,2020-04-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/michael-vallera-window-in/,Denovali,"Michael Vallera’s Window In is the ambient-music equivalent of a mood ring. The Chicago guitarist tucks microcosms of disparate sounds inside each of these four amorphous pieces—warm drones that unravel like deep sighs, creepy clicks that haunt like ghosts, curdled riffs that rush like dangerous rivers. They reflect what you bring to them, whether anxiety or hope. As menacing or majestic as you like, Window In is a timely reminder that it’s OK if your feelings are complicated, confounding, and subject to change. They’re all right here, bound inside 43 mesmerizing minutes. In one form or another, Vallera has been pursuing a single idea—electric guitar processed to the point of oblivion—for at least a decade. He played on Rhys Chatham’s guitar-symphony masterpiece, A Crimson Grail, and formed the excellent duo Cleared with drummer Steven Hess, a fellow Chicago instrumentalist who fosters a sense of formless wonder. On his three previous solo albums, each more intriguing than the last, Vallera suspended bits of piano chords or broken beats inside clouds of brittle or beautiful guitar, shaping an unstable horizon that seemed always to inch nearer. For Window In, Vallera limits himself to the electric guitar and anything he can use to interrupt, augment, warp, or otherwise ruin its output. The restriction is a boon, as Vallera has never before elicited such a wealth of sophisticated and ingenious sounds—or found such novel uses for old ones. “Hours” opens with a high-end hiss and a low-end growl, the extreme registers of his guitar simultaneously pushed to their limits. “Blue Mind” peaks when Vallera interrupts a resplendent tone over and over, so it constantly collapses only to rise again. It’s as if, by casually flipping a switch, he’s accidentally stumbled upon the idea of rhythm itself. In the past, Vallera has followed a distinguished tradition of guitarists reimagining their instrument’s textural edges; with these discoveries, he becomes part of the vanguard, like Keith Rowe or Christian Fennesz before him. More important, though, is how Vallera nests, layers, and intertwines these elements, like Grouper or Kara-Lis Coverdale, so that they unspool in an emotionally rich listen; otherwise, they might remain arcane elements of mere sound design. During “Blue Mind,” Vallera conjures the pop of a guitar cable that refuses to stay plugged in, a mundane noise familiar to anyone who’s ever played an electric instrument. He surrounds those tiny jolts with coruscant notes and a purring hum. The effect is like staring out at a splendid ocean scene while reeling from seasickness. And midway through “Deep Sleeping Exit,” his guitar wafts like the smell of springtime lavender, at least until the amplifier seems to crumble beneath the signal’s power. It’s like watching a thunderhead cut short a picture-perfect picnic. Outside of music, Vallera is a photographer whose frames capture a subtly altered reality, recalling both the astute framing of Alfred Stieglitz’s pictures and the backyard surrealism of Georgia O’Keefe’s paintings in one shot. Stare at one of his exquisite stills long enough, and you’ll finally notice the distant threat of an approaching cloud, or the way shapes that seem orderly slowly reveal an underlying chaos. Window In captures the same essence—a seemingly simple image that asks more questions the longer you sit with it. There are times when Window In suspends you at the edge of an abyss, others when it lifts you skyward. Mostly, though, those states linger here together, ready to remind you that one feeling won’t last forever.","The Chicago guitarist and sound artist tucks worlds of deep feelings into these four immersive pieces, which seem to shift with your own mood.

I Feel Alive,TOPS,by: Adlan Jackson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8b3b23e21e4f0009eaf03a/1:1/w_160/I%20Feel%20Alive_TOPS.jpg,2020-04-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tops-i-feel-alive/,Musique Tops,"As of this writing, the pop quartet TOPS adorn the cover of Spotify’s “Montréal Chill” playlist. They look how I’d like to imagine myself looking when I’m chilling—pouty and photogenic, elegant and thin. Their music is a fitting soundtrack for the sort of glamorous melancholy that reliably passes for depth. TOPS’ songs are “big moods,” with their slow-blooming synthesizers and guitars and vocals from frontwoman Jane Penny, who always sounds somewhere between tender and disappointed. But they begin their new album sounding ready to push through that malaise and on to something weirder. On opening track “Direct Sunlight,” prancing keyboard lines eventually give way to a cascade of voices cooing “sunshine” and a flute solo from Penny. This is TOPS at their most ambitious, showing their knack for taking references that might otherwise be dismissed for their cheesiness or chintz and finding the sincerity in the cliché. Here, and on the call-and-response “show me love” chorus on “Drowning in Paradise,” they show their aptitude for excavating half-remembered pop oddities. TOPS are at their best when they keep digging. Elsewhere on the album, though, they’re just chilling. They’re as despondent and nostalgic as ever, but back to the kind of windswept indie rock that is their trademark. Their perennial reference point is Fleetwood Mac: “Witching Hour” has a churn worthy of Mick Fleetwood, and Penny sells her Nicksisms when she commits to them. But whereas on the best Fleetwood Mac tracks you can hear them stumble, baffled, into awkward truths, the wistfulness on I Feel Alive can seem reflexive rather than felt. Even the title track, with its vague verse imagery, undercuts its own nicely understated refrain. In these moments, the album threatens to collapse into a mood board. But sometimes it’s okay to be sad for no reason at all. The title of “Ballads and Sad Movies” may prompt eye rolls, but it’s the song in which I Feel Alive clicks into place. When Penny wails, at the song’s climax, that she doesn’t know who she is anymore, the familiarity and comfort of nostalgia is ruptured, exposing the hopelessness and confusion beneath. Self-mythologizing is a survival strategy, and sometimes you’ve just got to indulge yourself if you’re going to stay sane. And cliché as the spoken-word French interludes and lyrics about missing-something-but-not-knowing-what may be, TOPS’ songwriting remains intuitive and rewarding when the band is firing on all cylinders, validating our tendency to mythologize our own petty tragedies.","At their best, this Montreal quartet locate the aching sincerity in pop clichés.

What We Drew,Yaeji,by: Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8755fa6609a50008743c09/1:1/w_160/What%20We%20Drew_Yaeji.jpg,2020-04-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yaeji-what-we-drew/,XL,"To grow up in the Asian-American experience and still become an artist is an act of rebellion; it’s a demand to tell your own story despite society deeming you interchangeable and voiceless. It’s a dismissal of the “model minority” stereotype—a patronizing label conferred upon your people for your supposed diligence and submission—and a refusal to reckon with that reduction. To be an Asian American artist also requires an inherent concession: You know that even if you attempt to address the universals in the human experience, your face will always be part of the discussion. Yaeji, a bilingual Korean American producer living in Brooklyn, could not have known that her first full-length mixtape would be released into explosive social frictions, a spate of violence against Asian Americans that would prove the “model” myth a hollow gesture. And yet her music arrives as an openhearted counterpoint, making space for both anxiety and love, offering a timely reminder of the power in subverting expectations of others and appreciating community—the kind you’re born into and the kind you built yourself. In her short, already thrilling career as a producer, singer, and rapper, Yaeji has toyed with ideas of communication and opacity: She initially sang in Korean instead of English to obscure her lyrics, and still plays the languages like instruments with different timbres and intonations. Her warm, sparkling beats usually nod to deep house, though she often adds a glaze of icy trap languor; when she covered pop hits by Drake and Robyn, she tempered the mania with misty distortion and falsetto chirps. Across her two EPs for Godmode records, Yaeji’s songs were effortlessly chill yet reliably euphoric. Her bass drops and feathery vocals have had such nimble balance and satisfying velocity, they’ve felt purifying as only the best dance music can: between “raingurl,” “drink i’m sippin on,” and that humid cover of “passionfruit,” her 2017 EP2 remains a stalwart DJ cheat code. Even teetotalers know: Any night out is instantly more seductive upon hearing Yaeji murmur, “Mother Russia in my cup.” For What We Drew, Yaeji’s first release on the venerable UK label XL, the 26-year-old producer could have easily shipped out a full crate of stylish, bacchanal floor-fillers without breaking a sweat. Instead, What We Drew plays like a self-issued challenge to strip away the fluorescence, to find what’s underneath pop catharsis. As a result, it’s subtler yet more resonant, because its peaks have deeper valleys to climb back from; in the tradition of Frankie Knuckles, Sylvester, and other artists who used bright electronic music as conduits of pain, here Yaeji offers smaller, darker meditations on the paralysis of anxiety and the loneliness inside the revelry. “Waking Up Down,” the tape’s first single, is the soft landing from Yaeji’s past. In a sleight-of-hand, it deploys several Yaeji staples immediately: a rippling, entrancing synth intro; a quick and satiating bass drop; lyrics so laid-back they slouch. But there is friction, too: As she flatly sings an index of minor daily achievements—“I got waking up down/I got cooking down/I got making a list and checking down”—her production feels crooked. Her voice clashes with the synths in dissonant patches; the drums feel pushy, the bass skittish. Soon the chorus, in Korean, confesses how much is truly awry: “It’s not easy/There’s no such thing as easy/If I’m lazy/They all say it’s my fault,” she sings more somberly. Her earlier feats weren’t brags so much as self-affirmations of her ability to function, and that insistently repeated “down” is a plaintive suggestion of where she’s been. Unlike Yaeji’s singles past, it languishes in this unease; the momentum builds but never crests, instead skittering to a halt with nervous, spotlit drums, channeling the lack of resolution in the low, daily thrum of worry. The satisfying gloss of “Waking Up Down” makes it one of the heftiest dance tracks on What We Drew; elsewhere, Yaeji is even more insular. “In the Mirror” is a clubber’s lament amid the sea of bodies, accepted but alone; by the chorus, she sounds like she’s one tipple shy of following Sia aboard a chandelier. “Why doesn’t it feel the same when I’m in the air/When I look in the mirror/When I’m not a pair?” she sings dazedly over synths that seep outward like black puddles. “When I Grow Up” sounds like a K-pop anthem after a weekend in a Bushwick gutter; its pared-back, chipper synth beat stutters and feints as Yaeji sings in multiple guises—rapid chattering, wide-eyed lilt—about how she’s been “forgotten” and “exposed to the ones that shouldn’t know.” Elsewhere, What We Drew has a diffused energy befitting of a mixtape—or outtakes, depending on your appetite for circuitous performance art and surreal posse cuts. “The Th1ng” is the former, a meandering spoken-word piece by the London artist Victoria Sin, with a glassy garage beat that nods greatly to FKA twigs’ “Glass & Patron.” “Free Interlude” is the latter and, despite the title, a full-length spasm of a track—a riff on jealousy and neuroses with blips of made-up, Seussian slang. Riding a stormy trap beat, Yaeji has never sounded so afield from pop-house, her voice wrung through processors into a thin, metallic wisp. “My envy/Ripping and biting/Try me and try me,” she raps in Korean, before admitting, “My life is in a weird place.” A series of equally distorted rappers—Lil Fayo, trenchcoat, and Sweet Pea—swoop in like Dadaist motivational speakers: The most insistent, Sweet Pea, proclaims, “I like pink/I like purple/You’re a Shirple.” Some of her friends’ cameos are more elevating, though—and sincerely uplifting. “Money Can’t Buy,” with the rising Bay Area rapper Nappy Nina, is as satisfying as the quiet pleasures it extols: As Yaeji drawls in Korean, all she wants to do is “eat rice and soup” and then, secondly, “be friends with you,” as a rubbery, strutting beat cuts the cuteness with pure ego. On “Spell,” the Tokyo DJ/producer YonYon sings sweetly in Japanese of “you and I, the magic that binds us,” over a house beat that buzzes and flickers like streetlamps before dawn; Yaeji’s tone is brisker but no less awed as she revels in her life of performance, in being embraced in her purest form: “As if I cast a spell/I read out loud my diary/In front of people,” she marvels. But while What We Drew is more internalized than past releases, it is not conflicted; rather, Yaeji finds clarity in vulnerability, in the pendulum swing of her humanity. Crucially, the mixtape doesn’t turn its back on one of Yaeji’s strongest traits as an artist: Her music has always been deeply social, and now it is more gregarious than ever in its gratitude for those around her. Some of the best tracks are valentines to the friends and artists who fill Yaeji’s world—and she has been proactive building scenes, from New York to Seoul—and her appreciation for this community feels all the sweeter balanced with her revelations of struggle. Throughout What We Drew, it is a thrill to hear Yaeji sound so proud and connected to the artistic company she keeps and to the heritage that gives her singing even more eloquence. It is sobering to know her struggles, to hear her persevere through them; hearing her shun easier paths, insistent on sharing her complicated truth, makes the party all the better when it arrives. Through the dark, Yaeji reminds us that our narratives are ours alone.","Yaeji’s first full-length mixtape is a subtle, more insular turn for the producer.

925,Sorry  ,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84eb8bf5748c0008d08d52/1:1/w_160/925_Sorry.jpg,2020-04-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sorry-925/,Domino,"The Elvis Presley costume Asha Lorenz wears in the video for Sorry’s “Rock ’n’ Roll Star” is closer to a last-minute Halloween costume than a genuine impersonator. Dancing and skipping through rainy streets, Lorenz exudes the same combination of sarcasm, silliness, and begrudging cool that runs through her band’s debut album, 925. Though they’re barely famous yet, Sorry act like they’re already over it. The London band’s sound is omnivorous but austere, absorbing elements of post-punk, pop, and jazz into a tongue-in-cheek, deeply self-aware update on indie rock. Few new rock bands seek to telegraph their most cliché ambitions so clearly—they aren’t even the first to call a song “Rock ’n’ Roll Star”—but few bands are as ambitious as Sorry. Lorenz met Louis O’Bryen, the band’s co-founder, guitarist, and sometime vocalist, when they attended the same private school in central London. They formed Sorry (original name: Fish) with three additional live band members in 2016 and gained attention at events put on by the south London collective Slow Dance, an early supporter of futuristic prog rockers black midi. After releasing a string of woozy alt-rock songs on Domino, Lorenz and O’Bryen opted out of university to spend time honing their sound. The result is 925, an album Lorenz says is named after the percentage of precious metal in sterling silver (92.5). There’s room for other interpretations, too: the most obvious is “9 to 5,” the type of job Sorry have so far managed to avoid. The album is full of these slippery double entendres and onomatopoeic puns, like the howl-at-the-moon guitar on “Wolf.” On “Ode to Boy,” Lorenz’s self-conscious rhymes of “baby” with “maybe” are pitched up into a literal baby voice. Sorry don’t hesitate to add their own irreverent slant to familiar pop music tropes: the obstinately catchy opening track “Right Round the Clock” interpolates Tears for Fears’ “Mad World,” while “As the Sun Sets” twists Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World” into a nightmarish inversion. In a listless tone, Lorenz sings about running into an ex with someone new. What a wonderful world for them, she seems to say, as she sarcastically riffs on Armstrong’s timeless chorus. Lorenz’s nakedly honest voice, often uncomfortably close in the mix, is the most arresting and consistent feature of a chaotic record full of zany sound effects and saxophone riffs. The sparse, eerie “Snakes” showcases her prowling lower register, while the closing track—a polished-up rework of Sorry’s first single, “Lies”—hinges on her brittle performance, including a devastating half-laugh as she rips apart the line, “I make lies like we should be together.” But she’s just as good when she’s being silly, heaving “eurgh” on the strutting chorus of “Starstruck” or echoing O’Bryen’s vocal line by shrieking “a boy!” on the otherwise sweet and straightforward “Heather.” 925 is a strange and searing debut, worthy of being taken seriously even when it’s not serious. Occasionally, the band’s sardonic send-up of rock clichés overshoots and winds up sounding grating: “I want drugs and drugs and drugs and drugs,” insists “More.” Their parodic humor can feel like a defense mechanism, a strategy to hold the listener at arm’s length. But powerful songs like “Starstruck,” “Wolf,” and the delicate ’90s-style grunge duet “Perfect” lift the curtain to reveal genuinely inventive songwriting. On 925, Sorry lovingly poke fun at themselves and at rock history—but they also prove they’ve got the talent to go further than their gags.","The London band’s deeply self-aware debut is worthy of being taken seriously even when it’s not serious.

WOMB,Purity Ring,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e87602e49503a0009419c06/1:1/w_160/WOMB_Purity%20Ring.jpg,2020-04-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/purity-ring-womb/,4AD,"Purity Ring have always been obsessed with bodily viscera, with blood and guts and bone. Vocalist Megan James sings of love as a kind of vivisection, pleading with her partner to cut her open, to make a protective cradle of her skeleton. WOMB does not break this pattern, but it narrows the band’s focus to the eponymous organ. The blood they’ve always sung about is now a more specific kind: On “i like the devil,” it stains bedsheets; on “femia,” the narrator wakes “in a sea of dark liquid.” There is a sexual awakening afoot here, but equally, a reckoning with existence in a brand new sort of body. Over the course of these 10 glittering pieces of synth pop, Purity Ring experiment with a conceptual coming-of-age narrative. In each song we meet a young woman, feel her nascent passion and holy shame, and cast our eyes to the horizon as clouds gather, spitting lightning. We fear for her. We wonder if she’ll quell the storm or find herself swept away in it. By pure coincidence, I’d recently picked up Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex as a quarantine project. It can be a jarring read; for every piece of timeless insight, there is some startling mid-century slap in the face, something like, “Some women become homosexual after the trauma of abortion.” But listening to WOMB, I could think of nothing but de Beauvoir’s portrait of a young girl on the cusp of her first period, who feels “danger in her insides” and struggles to imagine herself the equal of the coming crisis. “She is surprised,” writes Beauvoir, “to be both that heroine and that flesh.” WOMB’s protagonists are bleeding, yes, but they are growing powerful, too: wreaking carnage, learning to fly. Taken together, WOMB’s songs begin to suggest the outline of a singular character: a girl coming to see herself as heroic, capable of rising to the challenges of her new body and her new role in the world, and subsumed by the weight of what that entails. Violence is abundant in these lyrics: cannibalism, death by drowning, blood coursing Shining-like through hallways. Corin Roddick’s production is no longer crystalline and clear, as it was on another eternity, but grittier and stormier, synths surging like the sea. The sleigh bells of “peacefall” become funereal, tolling as James sings of someone who rode a “bicycle into the light.” (She delivers the line so prettily you’d be forgiven for fondly imagining a scene from E.T. before the more tragic, literal interpretation arrives.) A gasp like an iron lung opens “vehemence,” foreboding bass bellows across “i like the devil,” and minor-key arrangements abound. If Purity Ring ever decide to launch a second career scoring horror films, WOMB would make for a compelling resumé. WOMB is some of Purity Ring’s strongest work, a confident and singular statement from a band often imitated over the past decade. James’ voice often sounds high and fluty, like a girl’s, save for a single verse, on “pink lightning,” where it is manipulated in the opposite direction—belly-deep, guttural, for once the monster instead of the damsel. It is a provocative moment on a record that imagines a young girl in flux, a heroine coming to grips with flesh. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this review inaccurately suggested that James’ voice had been digitally manipulated to sound higher. In fact, it was only pitch-shifted to a lower register.","The electro-pop duo’s first album in five years muses on bodies, blood, and a girl’s coming of age; it benefits from the group’s newfound musical maturity and more exacting editorial eye.

Second Language,Minor Science,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e711ef75d64430008c92fb1/1:1/w_160/Second%20Language_Minor%20Science.jpg,2020-04-06 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/minor-science-second-language/,Whities,"When Angus Finlayson began making dance music under the name Minor Science in the early 2010s, dirt was in vogue. Distortion was omnipresent; drum machines often sounded like they’d been dredged out of a canal, their circuits caked with rust. Finlayson’s debut EP, for London label the Trilogy Tapes, followed suit, slathering slow, sullen house beats in grit. But one song, “Hapless,” felt different. The bulk of the track, with its skulking drums and ominous spoken loop, was in keeping with the era’s lo-fi aesthetics. But at the center was a strange, slippery synthesizer pattern with a distinctly hi-def signature, its liquid textures and unsteady rhythms flickering like a coded message beamed across space and time. Finlayson, a former Pitchfork contributor, has spent the years since trying to catch up with that signal, with each successive release pushing a little further into unknown territory. By 2017’s “Volumes”/“Another Moon,” the third of a trio of annual 12""s for London’s Whities label, he had reached his destination. Gone were the blunted moods and busted sonics of his early work; in their place, glistening timbres and exhilaratingly precise programming whose swiveling movements were reminiscent of robotic arms. That record remains among the most futuristic-sounding dispatches from the past decade of electronic music. On his debut album, Finlayson keeps moving further outward, fashioning a distinctive take on club music that seems determined to wriggle free of linear structure. The first thing you notice about Second Language is its iridescent finish—on track after track, the synths have a vivid, shimmering quality—and the next is the force of its punch. The heaviest tracks hit harder than Minor Science ever has, shot through with concussive kicks, writhing basslines, and finely tooled drum work. But even at their most powerful, these songs are remarkably nimble. “Balconies” wraps footwork rhythms in a cushion of empty space, accentuating the springiness of the drums’ attack; “Gone Rouge,” another 170-BPM standout, takes earthbound rave tropes (dub sirens, Korg M1 organ basslines) and sends them darting through midair, deft as dragonflies. Like Jlin and Objekt, Finlayson is a masterful sound designer. His targeted use of reverb, delay, and, crucially, the absence of those often ubiquitous effects, paired with filter sweeps and sudden moments of silence, suggests wild, artificial spaces where the laws of the universe no longer hold sway. And his shape-shifting arrangements, full of fake-outs and hard lefts, contribute to the sense of being strapped into a four-dimensional roller coaster. It’s a short album, blazing through 10 tracks in 36 minutes. Even the club anthems, like “Polyglottal” and “For Want of Gelt,” don’t go much over four minutes; the tempos throughout are mostly breathtakingly fast, as though Finlayson felt he didn’t have a moment to waste. But the record has a unified palette, held together by bright synth melodies that occasionally hark back to Autechre’s wistful early albums. (Along with footwork, electro, and drum’n’bass, IDM is a major influence here.) Thanks to smart sequencing that balances bangers with pensive interludes, it feels less like a collection of club tracks than a suite broken into 10 interlocking movements. Occasionally, Finlayson’s fidgety tendencies get the better of him. He has a habit of building up to a drop, deploying a heart-in-mouth cue that things are about to kick off in earnest, and then abruptly changing course, leaving all that tension unresolved. Doubtless this is on purpose, though sometimes it feels like he’s deliberately moving two steps forward, one step back, and one giant pole vault back to the starting line. But his playful qualities are commendable: There’s an explosion of percussion at the climax of “For Want of Gelt” that sounds like an entire rack of drum machines jolted to life by a power surge. It’s so over the top that it’s almost laugh-out-loud funny, which is a nice change in a genre that can be awfully self-serious. The most exciting moments happen when Finlayson’s restlessness yields entirely new sounds, like the major chord that flashes out just once toward the end of “Balconies”; Finlayson seems to understand that repeating it even one more time would diminish its uniqueness exponentially. I’m particularly fond of a Durutti Column-like guitar that calls out and falls silent in the closing “Voiced and Unvoiced,” or the lo-fi, tape-warped guitar that pokes gingerly through the opening “Second Language (Intro).” That one’s even got a little distortion on it, a detail that stands out all the more vividly against the rest of the track’s pristine sonics. Perhaps, having mastered spotlessness, he’s ready to let a little dirt in again.","Angus Finlayson’s first LP is shot through with concussive kicks, writhing basslines, and finely tooled drum work.

Head Hunters,Herbie Hancock,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84ffabc2ed2400096ee289/1:1/w_160/Head%20Hunters_Herbie%20Hancock.jpg,2020-04-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/herbie-hancock-head-hunters/,Columbia,"In 1973, Herbie Hancock, a virtuosic jazz dissident, stomped out an entire history of sound when he walked out a bassline on a modular synthesizer. This was not someone’s upright acoustic bass played with calloused fingers, it was preprogrammed on a circuit board obscured inside a small wooden box, amplified by some hidden electrical process. And it wasn’t one bassline crawling out of the speakers, it was two, dubbed on top of each other, split across the stereo field, blasphemed onto what was ostensibly a jazz recording in post-production. For purists, it was just another heretical element on another album of heresy from yet another jazz pioneer turned iconoclast. The afterimages of Miles Davis’ blinding turn toward the electric music a few years earlier were still being processed by audiences, players, and critics alike. Hancock, having played keys for six years with Miles Davis’ Second Great Quintet, had his own gauntlet to throw. Inspired by the power he saw in James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone, Hancock wanted to quit wafting in the rarified air of acoustic and avant-garde jazz. “I was not trying to make a jazz record,” Hancock said later. He wanted to get low, down to the floor, through the earth. He wanted to make a pure funk record. Instead, he made Head Hunters. A year before Hancock plunked out that bassline, his woodwind player, Bennie Maupin, sat among the sold-out crowd at Los Angeles Coliseum for Wattstax, a 1972 benefit concert sometimes referred to as “Black Woodstock.” Every marquee artist from the iconic Memphis soul label Stax performed that August afternoon—from the Staple Singers to the Bar-Kays to Isaac Hayes, who closed the concert wearing a gold chainmail cape. The eight-hour show meant to “give back to the community” in the primarily black Watts neighborhood, which had been torn by riots seven years earlier. Tickets were $1, and the security force was entirely black and unarmed. With over 110,000 in attendance, it was then the largest gathering of African Americans in one place since the civil rights March on Washington in 1963. Maupin, a 32-year-old jazz woodwindist nonpareil from Detroit, had been playing with Hancock for the previous three years on a trilogy of experimental albums known as Hancock's Mwandishi period, from the Swahili name for “composer” that he had adopted at the time. Mwandishi (1971), Crossings (1972) and Sextant (1973) were lofty, sometimes electronic excursions, all influenced deeply by jazz’s big extinction event, Miles Davis’ 1970 album Bitches Brew. The Mwandishi group would sometimes sit in the tour bus and listen to records by German electronic music pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen at Hancock’s request. In the studio they were incorporating the vanguard production techniques of Bitches Brew, which were verboten in traditionalist jazz circles: extensive editing, amplified instruments, two drummers, overdubs, synth loops. Having played bass clarinet on Bitches Brew, Maupin served as real connective tissue from the most infamous jazz record to the second most infamous jazz record: Head Hunters. When Hancock disbanded the Mwandishi group in search of a new sound, Maupin was the only member he kept. The heady strains of the Mwandishi era were a lot more highfalutin than the music Maupin witnessed at Wattstax, though. As the bands grooved to soul, R&B, and funk onstage, Maupin watched a group of young kids dancing the funky robot, popping and locking their joints at right angles. “I just started to hear in my mind melodies centered around that kind of movement,” Maupin later said. The melody: two little hitches, a staccato double-tap, followed by a bluesy riff down a minor pentatonic scale. Tributaries of jazz history flowed through Maupin, who had played with hard bop greats like Lee Morgan and avant-garde pioneers like Pharoah Sanders in the previous decade. But at Wattstax, he was tapping into a broader, more popular, more body-focused black experience. The music Hancock was plotting, like the melody Maupin imagined, drew from the politics of the Watts Riots and Black Nationalism and the counterculture, but also the beat, the one, the groove that made kids want to free their mind and dance. When the concert let out, Maupin brought his riff idea based on the funky robot back to Hancock at a rehearsal space in Los Angeles, where he fed it to the newly assembled Head Hunters lineup. Maupin didn’t use the woozy timbre of the bass clarinet but rather the gritty R&B sound of the tenor sax. The upheaval of avant-garde and the donning of funk all poured into “Chameleon,” an indefatigable 15-minute track that staked a new epoch for jazz the minute Hancock plunked out its bassline. Nothing was what it seemed: the bassline was a synth; the guitar-sounding riff was a bass, played by Bay Area funk stylist Paul Jackson in the altissimo register. Hancock plays his clavinet like Hendrix comping time with a wah-wah pedal. The in-demand R&B session drummer Harvey Mason plays in a straight-eighth funk feel, like Clyde Stubblefield did behind James Brown. “Chameleon” slid in and out of the downbeat of ’70s funk, the looseness of cool jazz, the musical modes of R&B, all while drawing upon the rhythms of Anlo-Ewe and Afro-Cuban drumming, black counterculture, and the vanguard of modular synthesizers. All this blending of traditional instruments and technology, of black American and African sound, was reflected on the album’s cover: Next to Maupin, there’s Jackson holding a Fender bass; Mason clutching a snare; a virtually unknown percussionist from the Bay Area, Bill Summers, holding gourd rattles. Front and center is Hancock, his face covered with something resembling the ritual kple kple mask worn by the Baoulé people of the Ivory Coast—the eyes, however, are radio knobs, and the mouth is a VU meter, an electronic tool for measuring loudness. A satellite view of Head Hunters reveals a vast bazaar of cultures and genres, a complicated interchange of artistic and personal histories. Recorded in a single week and released shortly thereafter, on October 13, 1973, it spent 42 weeks on the Billboard chart, becoming the first platinum-selling jazz album, as it was being slammed by critics as a rapacious commercial move. It was an album that captured jazz as it broke out and mingled with America, appealing both to the Wattstax crowd and to white suburbia. “Sure I’m getting a bigger white audience,” Hancock said a year after the album’s release. “But I’m also getting a big black audience, which I never had...I’ve finally been able to come out with some music the general black public can relate to.” By 1973, rock, pop, and R&B had been cannibalizing the jazz audience for over a decade. In the wake of Miles’ electric albums, jazz fusion groups like the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, and Return to Forever tried to capture both sides of the aisle. The walls were crumbling between the haughty air of jazz and what was being played on commercial radio. Taking a cynical view, jazz historian Grover Sales put it this way: “Some bored rock artists had been gravitating towards jazz because they were bored, while jazz players dallied with rock to recapture their dwindling audience.” In the eyes of purists, fusion groups had poisoned the sanctity of jazz, for reasons ranging from crass commercialization of what was once a pure art form to something more pernicious. Head Hunters co-producer David Rubinson said that “jazz fusion meant... white people playing black music.” But Head Hunters avoids the fussy, technical chops of those fusion groups, and instead sinks deeply into funk. In a 1985 interview, Hancock revealed his mindset going into making a pure funk record: “When I heard [Sly & the Family Stone’s] “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” it just went to my core. I didn’t know what he was doing. I mean, I heard the chorus, but how could he think of that? I was afraid that was something I couldn’t do. And here I am, I call myself a musician. It bothered me…I decided to try my hand at funk.” Like jazz, funk was, at its genesis, a wholly black and political genre, tempered in the Black Power movement of the ’60s and carried forth into the Nixon era by Brown, Sly, George Clinton, Curtis Mayfield, and others. For all of funk’s nastiness and ecstasy, its subversive emancipation of mind and ass, its no-pretense elemental nature, Rickey Vincent, in his 1995 book on the history of funk, lands on a long-view definition. He writes that funk is “...an aesthetic of deliberate confusion, soulful behavior that remains viable because of a faith in instinct, a joy of self, and a joy of life, particularly unassimilated black American life.” The black roots of Head Hunters create this underground communion of joy, a funky celebration of all that is modern and ancient. Funk was psychedelic dance music, working-class rebellion, something elusive and unattainable to a mainstream white audience. And as always, mainstream America drank deep from this new well of underground black music. It made Hancock rich—and the numerous times “Chameleon” and “Watermelon Man” have been sampled in hip-hop only made him richer. But it was a sticking point for critics who called the great jazz piano player a pop sell-out. Members of the jazz cognoscenti did not want the hem of their garments sullied with the commercial slop of popular music. In conversation with famous jazz grouch Wynton Marsalis, Hancock defended Head Hunters not as an album that set out to make money, but an album that happened to make money. “Look I’d like to have a Rolls-Royce,” Hancock said, “but I’m not trying to set myself up to get a Rolls-Royce.” It is impossible to capture the whole external life of the galactically important Head Hunters, what it touched, how it functioned, its shape in society, its place on the great cosmic map (though musicologist Steven Pond approaches totality in his peerless 2005 book on the album). Truthfully, though, Head Hunters doesn’t confer great importance by the sound of it. It doesn’t scream “cash-grab,” or signal a fissure in jazz, or really exist in any of the contexts that surrounded its release almost five decades ago. The microbial funk of the album, its living power, lies below all that. Head Hunters states its intent in its name: The music will blow open your skull the second you press play, the instant the bassline from “Chameleon” comes out of the speakers in full stereo sound. And if that doesn’t move you, how about when Harvey Mason comes in with the funkiest drum part in the history of drumming, a groove even Hancock said he had never heard before in his life, that snare hit coming just before the two, the kick drum so dead and relaxed, are you kidding me? Head Hunters rightfully belongs to the Library of Congress as one of our nation's most treasured recordings, sitting there, smoking, untouchable, a factory of winces and hoooos. Hancock’s idea for Head Hunters involved making a funk album with players who brought many other worlds to the table. Mason was an R&B drummer who played deep in the pocket, but he didn’t just sit on one pattern, he tugged and pulled at it throughout the song, a tailor constantly adjusting the fit and feel. Then there’s Summers’ famous solo on beer bottles, pennywhistle, shekere, handclaps, and falsetto ad-libs at the beginning of “Watermelon Man,” a tune carried over and radically reinterpreted from Hancock’s earlier career as a more traditional jazz player. This section is an adaptation of the traditional calls of Ba-Benzélé pygmies of Central Africa, an effort by Summers “to bring up the level of appreciation of the African experience.” With a fat Fender sound, Jackson plays the best bassline on the album—better even than “Chameleon”—defining the one and creating the syncopation outside of Summers’ nest of percussion. Maupin doesn’t just riff around on the blues scale; on the vastly underappreciated “Sly,” he goes far out, squeaking and running high and low on the soprano sax, bringing his ’60s avant-gardism back into the soundscape, all on a song named after funk master Sly Stone himself. “Sly” may not have the cultural cachet of “Chameleon” or “Watermelon Man,” but it is the album’s true synthesis of funk texture and jazz feel. When the song shifts grooves around the two-minute mark, Hancock starts comping on his clavinet in stereo, Summers starts an Afro-Cuban groove on the conga, and Mason loosens his wrist on the snare to give Maupin as much room as he needs. By the time Hancock gets to his solo on his Rhodes, the song feels both impossibly free and tightly wound. Finally, Head Hunters cools down with “Vein Melter,” the corpse pose, a psalm on death written for a friend of Hancock’s who died of a heroin overdose. With Mason’s snare rolls every measure, it sounds like a funeral march, but Hancock doesn’t put anything to rights. He delays interment with a sneaky grin while comping on the Rhodes with preternatural chill. “Vein Melter” never succumbs to meditative repetition—you can hear the heaving breath, the residual energy of the first three songs pulsing behind it. Head Hunters is the bond that connects unnamable forces at the center of jazz and of funk, divine aspirations and base desires, head and body. It’s foolish to try to name the spark of music like this, a parlor game better left to the comedown of an acid trip or a street preacher on his last leg. Head Hunters isn’t the god, it’s just five consummate pros jamming, with a light amount of editing and production. It’s simple, really, even accidental. About six minutes and 55 seconds into “Chameleon,” as Hancock solos on his Arp Odyssey, he lands on a four-note phrase that’s about a half-step away from the key of the song. It is a phrase that pulls your shoulders up to your ears, makes you put your hands up to your face to block the punch. It is the single funkiest, unholiest, nastiest moment on the record, and it was a complete mistake. Hancock was futzing with the manual pitch bender on the synthesizer during his solo and didn’t realign it. He was playing the wrong notes, but the right notes were coming out.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Paris ,Paris Hilton,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84f3187f98dd0008c3df2c/1:1/w_160/Paris_Paris%20Hilton.jpg,2020-04-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/paris-hilton-paris-hilton/,Real Gone,"Picture it: You’re standing in the outdoor area of a bar, elbow-to-elbow with your fellow revelers. As it used to be, the proximity is perfectly safe. You aren’t even thinking about it. The temperature is perfect: 75 or 82 or 90, whatever you like. You’re having such a good time, you don’t even realize it—inoculated by the privilege of being able to take such things for granted. Whatever song is playing—you weren’t paying much attention to it—ends and the vague reggae intro of Paris Hilton’s Top 20 hit from 2006, “Stars Are Blind,” slinks on. Now you’re paying attention. The night’s sparkle brightens. The communal experience of a beloved pop song from yesteryear sounds so good right now. If you have any relationship with “Stars Are Blind,” the new vinyl reissue of Hilton’s first and, to date, only album might be the perfect serving of nostalgic comfort food. Go ahead and indulge: Pop music is a salve that can provide a respite from fixating on doom and even transcend the politics of its own creators. So, in the spirit of eating the rich—and looking back lovingly at any time other than the present—Paris is both an easy thing to tear into and a hard thing to deny. It is goofy and craven, ear candy and rotted commodity. It’s so simplistic that it could make you swear it’s a put-on, that it’s way savvier than it seems, that it’s so stridently bereft of having any there there that it must be intentional. “There,” Hilton mutters into your ears and smacks you over the head with maroon-and-blonde marbled vinyl containing an amalgamation of mid-aughts pop. At the time of its release, Paris seemed like a lark—a trifling vanity project from someone who was making a mint off of merely existing. Deadpan and clipped, Hilton didn’t seem even particularly engaged or enthusiastic about doing that. Already a tabloid staple, reality TV star, and absorber of paparazzi flashbulbs, Hilton was trying on pop stardom like a new pair of Louboutins that she’d soon discard. Little did we know that a reggae rip-off of Lord Creator’s 1970 cut “Kingston Town” would become the most enduring relic of her public reign. It couldn’t be anything else. It’s not like people are going to turn to her memoir Confessions of an Heiress, or one of her box-office bombs (The Hottie and the Nottie, anyone?), or DreamCatchers hair extensions to remember Hilton’s heyday by. For all the space Hilton sucked up and never gave anything of substance back to, “Stars Are Blind,” made it sort of worth it. There is something impressive in the synergy fueling Paris: A person who was famous for being famous turning to pop, a genre whose hits, it has been argued with data, tend to be popular because they’re popular. On the album, privilege is not merely flaunted; it is an adopted aesthetic. All over Paris, Hilton sings of her own appeal without any apparent impulse to illustrate or explain. Fat Joe and Jadakiss join her on “Fightin’ Over Me,” one of six tracks produced by Scott Storch just before he squandered $30 million in six months and his career effectively dried up. Neither Joe nor Jada put up much of a fight (Joe: “Yeah ma, you with the realest, how simple is that?”) despite Hilton’s insistence during the chorus, which is either deathly emphatic or creatively bankrupt: “Every time I turn around, the boys fightin’ over me/Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me/Maybe ’cause I’m hot to death, and I’m so, so, so sexy/All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me.” The persona Hilton adopts on the album is like a Sims version of herself: She pursues hot guys at the club, she gets pursued at the club, she loves, she bemoans, she says things like, “That’s hot!” and “I like attention!” in her whispery baby voice. There is something alluring about her deadpan—she’s so committed to its stillness that she might as well be meditating. Paris is a concept album whose concept is: What if Paris Hilton made an album? With absolutely no surprises to offer, it’s a committed extension of her brand, an album as giant and empty and theoretically iconic as a deflated Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. It seems consciously blank, like an answer to an interview question Hilton hates but is too poised to ignore. Hilton has writing credits on five of its ten original songs. (The album’s 11th is a cover of Rod Stewart’s “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy,” which is redundant coming from someone who is clearly convinced that the answer of each and every listener is yes.) “Excuse me for feeling,” she sings in “Stars,” and it’s like...yes! Exactly. It’s rare to detect her doing that. “Stars” is one of the few songs where her effort sounds convincing—during the second verse, she sings the word “be” so that it pours out of her mouth like cleavage from a dress. Elsewhere, Hilton’s voice sits somewhere between the doe-eyed wonder of Britney Spears and the vampy charisma of Gwen Stefani, with some of Janet Jackson’s muttering technique sprinkled in. She is by far lesser than each of these singers, though, and none of them are exactly powerhouses. In the synth ballad highlight “Heartbeat,” her voice presses on each note with the deliberation of a small child learning piano. It almost feels like a conscious statement on the extent to which pop can get away with being soulless. When she sings, “With you I feel the other half of my heartbeat,” the physiological shakiness of the metaphor doesn’t even register initially because her admission of half-heartedness makes so much sense. Her words are easy to take at face value. “Heartbeat” starts as a soft-focus synth-based ringer for Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time” before morphing into a retread of Stefani’s “Cool.” Dr. Luke handed Hilton a carbon copy of his “Since U Been Gone” with “Nothing in This World”—there’s also a taste of the Cure’s “Just Like Heaven” in the chorus’ guitar riff. Some of the rockier songs, like the rumored Nicole Richie diss track “Jealousy,” play as though everything Hilton knows about grunge, she learned from Ashlee Simpson. With all the money in the world, most of the time Paris simply can’t summon more than cubic zirconia pop, an ersatz take on the genuine article. Paris is a strange record of contradictions. It’s an exercise in noncommitment, an expression of indifference. Hilton emerged from this album a one-hit wonder, which is, all things considered, a fun thing to have under your belt when you have enough money that a career in music would never much affect your quality of life anyway. It’s not that she didn’t go for more in a spate of one-off singles released periodically in the nearly 14 years since Paris’ release (not to mention her seemingly fruitless signing to Cash Money in 2013). She also launched a successful career as a DJ, in which she claimed to receive more than $100,000 per gig. It is quite tempting to shit on Paris at a time when, in the words of the New York Times’ Amanda Hess, celebrity culture is burning as a result of a global crisis’ highlighting of the disparity between the haves and have nots. But so flagrant has been Hilton’s privilege all along that the resentment was always there for the taking. As a celebrity, her moderate musical success is more of a reinforcement of pop’s values than a problem she created. Stars are blind and also tone-deaf. After all, they’re people too.","The celebrity socialite’s alluringly empty 2006 debut gets a vinyl reissue. It’s a concept album whose concept is: What if Paris Hilton made an album?

You’ll Be Fine,Hot Mulligan,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84f81d1f638000081a6a50/1:1/w_160/You'll%20Be%20Fine_Hot%20Mulligan.jpg,2020-04-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hot-mulligan-youll-be-fine/,No Sleep,"Hot Mulligan are on that emo bullshit. All of it: alternate tunings, capos, and twinkle riffs dangling like loose cardigan threads, but also pick slides and power chords as slick and shiny as a Drive Thru sampler CD. Painfully earnest lyrics about cars, funerals, faded pictures, and cigarettes, but also non-sequitur in-joke song titles. Shouting matches between the yelpy guy and the guy who can sorta sing for real. And that’s all just in the opener of you’ll be fine, the Michigan band’s second full-length. Across the album, they bear the most telling quality of people who’ve given their life to emo: they hate it a little, too. Their targets include the self-aggrandizing scene police, the clout chasers, and the abusers, but most importantly, themselves. It’s a gift and a curse: Hot Mulligan have undeniable skills, but they lie in a style of music that is exceptionally well-suited to expressions of romantic failures, nonexistent job prospects, and the futility of self-medication. According to singer-guitarist Tades Sanville, he was inspired to write “Feal Like Crab” after taking stock of his career and realizing, “I have almost nothing worthwhile on my resume, and that’s not dope.” A few years ago, he might’ve just used that as a lyric, but Hot Mulligan may now aspire to something like thinking man’s pop-punk, as evinced by the unstoppable chorus: a life that ends “hiding deep in some depressing little hovel in the background of the show you’re watching,” a an exquisitely wrought passage that somehow manages to seem off-the-cuff. But “Feal Like Crab” isn’t going to serve as anyone’s anthem for rising above their station: when the band bursts into the bridge, their idea of orchestral uplift is a single dinky xylophone fighting for space with the saddest possible gang vocals. “*Equip Sunglasses*” casts its aspersions indiscriminately in all directions, as the rhythm section works the sort of percolating groove that might soundtrack a boy band’s pivot to real rock. Judging from their deadpanning and flexing in the video, they’re aware of the dissonance here, as a bunch of Midwestern dudes beating the Jonas Brothers and 5 Seconds of Summer at their own game. It gives Hot Mulligan the sense of a band out of time: In 2004, this could’ve been their “All the Small Things,” but today, there’s no Warped Tour, no Fuse TV, and Vagrant was last seen putting out Janet Jackson albums five years ago. You’ll be fine is a lot craftier than Hot Mulligan’s workmanlike debut Pilot, but its immediately pleasing familiarity can work against them. Sanville’s vocal range is almost identical to that of Jesse Lacey or Dan “Soupy” Campbell, with a resigned mutter on one end and a strangulated wail on the other. But Sanville uses the latter voice to begin most Hot Mulligan songs, and usually stays there. you’ll be fine leaves almost no room for ambiguity, and is likely to turn off anyone with even the slightest aversion to emo songwriting tropes. Though flecked with signifiers of artistic growth—some drum machines here, a little more reverb there—you’ll be fine isn’t exactly a leveling up. It documents a band at a crossroads that could only come along in their early twenties. “Analog Fade (New Bule Sky)” isn’t just about watching the love of your life walk away, but about watching them figure out where they want to go to grad school. “SPS” isn’t just about sinking into alcoholic despair, but about the guilt over how your drinking makes you a bad roommate. “BCKYRD,” the album’s thesis statement, essentially equates adulthood to giving up on your actual interests. “Things don’t get better, just different,” Sanville screams. It’s the closest thing to hope Hot Mulligan can find at this point: they’re certainly a better band than they were, and they seem ready to write about something different next time around.","The second album from the Michigan emo band feels like a product of another era: itching to cross over, but without anywhere to cross over to.

In Bank We Trust,Bankroll Fresh,by: Jackson Howard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84fd511c7d5e0008fee825/1:1/w_160/In%20Bank%20We%20Trust_Bankroll%20Fresh.jpg,2020-04-04 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bankroll-fresh-in-bank-we-trust/,Street Money Worldwide,"When Trentavious White, better known as the rapper Bankroll Fresh, was murdered on March 4, 2016, at Atlanta’s Street Execs studio, modern hip-hop’s capital city lost one of its most innovative stylists and authentic storytellers. Even in a city where new talent seemed to emerge daily, Bankroll’s peak was short. “Hot Boy,” his breakout hit, dropped in fall 2014, only 18 months before his death. Yet Bankroll was notably connected, and respected: he was a collaborator of 2 Chainz and Future, close friends with Zaytoven and Metro Boomin’, and he gave Jeezy his last hit, the thunderous “All There,” which owed its success to Bankroll’s sound. Before Migos and Young Thug asserted control of Atlanta, Bankroll was on his way to creating a lane of his own, linking micro-generations of Atlanta trap: Travis Porter’s club-ready bounce, T.I.’s menacing swagger, and frequent collaborator Gucci Mane’s warbly wordplay. A hardened, husky-voiced trap rapper, whose stories of life in Atlanta’s Zone 3 rang of pain and paranoia, Bankroll was blessed with the dexterity to switch between myriad flows and invent new ones seemingly on the spot; his go to ad-lib, fittingly, was “switch it up!” “ESPN,” a highlight from his best tape, 2015’s Life of a Hot Boy, has Bankroll approaching the beat from its side, rapping offbeat so forcefully that it creates its own pocket. He delighted in exploiting a beat’s open spaces: On the mesmerizing “Fuck is You Sayin,” released the same year, the rhymes tumble out of Bankroll as if involuntarily, like he’s on the verge of sputtering out. He rapped with the control and violence of a deranged puppet master, prefacing the irreverent, rhythm-warping flows of rappers like Lil Baby, Gunna, and Valee, and helping to set the stage for 21 Savage’s deadpan menace to break out into the mainstream. Bankroll’s rise and untimely crash happened so fast that he never got to release his debut album. In its place, after years of delays, we get In Bank We Trust, a collection of hard-hitting loosies, a feast of dizzying rhyme schemes and mournful trap synths that showcases Bankroll’s talent but never attempts anything more than that. In Bank We Trust isn’t a sappy, exploitative posthumous tribute, but a no-frills reminder of Bankroll’s gripping artistry. The record starts out blisteringly hot, punctuated by the brooding “Extra” and the regal “Quarter Million,” which starts with Bankroll nearly screaming, “I pull the trigger like MacGyver! Young nigga ballin, I got the eye of the tiger!” He changes gears three different times on the riot-starting “Right On,” and stretches and snaps his flow like a rubber band on the astounding opener “Mind Body Soul.” The beats, handled mostly by Atlanta stalwarts D. Rich and Shawty Fresh, are often bombastic, but they’re also dated and rudimentary, the stuff of mid-decade Gucci Mane tapes. Yet Bankroll still makes magic here, commanding trap numbers like “Feel Me,” the Boosie-featuring “Million Up,” and the highlight “Playin Wit a Check” with murderous precision. In Bank We trust is both grounded and limited by its avoidance of the outsized glitz and ambition that often accompany posthumous albums. It’s difficult not to imagine what a Zaytoven and Metro Boomin-helmed project, or an album featuring any grouping of Bankroll’s long list of admirers, would have sounded like instead. But there’s something fitting about the lack of pomp. This is a rapper who, despite his ridiculous talent, didn’t seem intent on making it as a rapper. “I want the fortune, motherfuck the fame,” he raps to begin the album. Industry acceptance and household-name status weren’t part of the plan. Listeners loved Bankroll because of the gritty authenticity that radiated from every verse, and his undeniable dedication to his people. As an album, In Bank We Trust is somewhat less than the sum of its mostly strong parts; it’s a tantalizing, yet unorganized and unrefined, look at a remarkable rapper. But it does what it needs to do, which is to allow Bankroll to continue sharing his life, despite its early end. “Tell em your story, bankroll fresh...” Erykah Badu tweeted two months before his death. Thankfully, that story isn't over quite yet.","A posthumous album showcases the late Atlanta rapper’s head-spinning dexterity without attempting anything more than that, both grounded and limited by its avoidance of the usual pomp.

Heaven to a Tortured Mind,Yves Tumor,by: Kevin Lozano,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84a2cee21e4f0009eaf016/1:1/w_160/Heaven%20to%20a%20Tortured%20Mind_Yves%20Tumor.jpg,2020-04-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yves-tumor-heaven-to-a-tortured-mind/,Warp,"Yves Tumor plays a sex god on their latest album, a carnal rock record called Heaven to a Tortured Mind. If you were only familiar with the experimental ambient and noise Tumor was making just four years ago, this might sound unlikely. But transformations and roleplaying are key to understanding why Tumor is among the most interesting artists working today. Genre-bending is an inadequate rubric for describing what makes Tumor’s sound so enticing; with each new record, they seem to embody a genre—its history, its texture, its tropes. The mutations and evolutions across their work are something closer to method acting. Every gesture or affect on display across Tumor’s previous albums represents an engrossing performance of whatever genre they’re studying at the moment. When Tumor became a darling of the experimental scene following 2016’s Serpent Music, they looked the part of a confrontational noise and ambient artist: decked out in chains, cowboy hats, and flowing robes. Their sound matched—a mix of influences that found common cause with the likes of Laraaji, William Basinski, and Dean Blunt. Then came 2018’s auteurist pop masterpiece Safe in the Hands of Love, Tumor’s most successful project to date, which transformed them into a charismatic bandleader and howling vocalist. When I saw them on that album’s tour, I was struck by the metamorphosis of Yves Tumor, dressed in a crushed velvet suit and flowing white blouson, carried themselves like the wayward son of Prince, bounding across the stage as explosions of percussion and guitar rattled behind them. The ardor of the performance demystified at least one mystery about this artist: Yves Tumor’s next project was learning to be a rock star. And with the glorious sonic smut we find on Heaven to a Tortured Mind, we get a sense for the very kind of star Tumor wants to be known as. While Heaven to a Tortured Mind, like past Yves Tumor records, is a collage of styles (there’s glam, psych rock, krautrock, Britpop, soul, and noise here), a distinct personality emerges—that of Yves the seducer. This plush and magisterial kind of rock—heavy on imperial horns and crashing drums and bodacious guitar solos—evokes the sensuousness of suede and cigarette smoke, conjuring an atmosphere of total, decadent vice. With its hellish brass instruments and prowling basslines, the album’s doozy of an opener, “Gospel for a New Century,” is a perfect distillation. Amid the indulgence, Tumor’s voice becomes a thing of beauty: A raspy, sometimes guttural instrument that howls of love, loss, and damnation. It suggests a time when rock music felt forbidden—played backwards on turntables to reveal messages from sexy heretics. Tumor is fascinated with blending disgust and pleasure, beauty and abjection. On “Medicine Burn,” they strike an unholy balance between gory imagery (“Severed heads on the mental guillotine/Life of blasphemy a room full of kings”) and a buoyant, bouncing vocal performance. A similar tension underlies “Identity Trade,” where the wonderfully schmaltzy squawk of what sounds like a clarinet accompanies a tale of murderous desire (“I saw my first lover clutching a dagger sunk beneath the water”). The study in contrast that’s been a motif of Tumor’s work from the start is magnified, given the swagger and attitude of music you would hear in a stadium. “Kerosene!”, a lovely and bracing duet with the singer Diana Gordon, builds to a towering, speaker-shattering guitar solo; the two-part “Romanticist/Dream Palette”—a collaboration with Sunflower Bean’s Julia Cumming and Kelsey Lu—swirls the voices together around pummeling drums and dueling guitars. These are not songs for the ascetic within us; this is music meant only for reverie. In that way, Heaven to a Tortured Mind is the most straightforward record in Tumor’s catalog. It’s an album with commercial, or at least mass, appeal in mind. And it seems to confirm something Tumor hinted at in a 2016 interview about their musical aspirations: “I only want to make hits. What else would I want to make?” The product of this ambition is a gratifying and intense record, one whose pleasures are viscerally immediate. Above all, it’s loads of fun to watch Tumor don the guise of a devilish rockstar. It’s not exactly a new archetype in our cultural imagination, but the ravishing delight Tumor brings to this character is what makes their music so affecting. Yves is a performer whose roles, played with the utmost rigor, always find a way to linger in the memory.

"New Me, Same Us",Little Dragon,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e7371fd3a8b0008fc4f4c/1:1/w_160/dragon.jpg,2020-04-03 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/little-dragon-new-me-same-us/,Ninja Tune,"The knock on Little Dragon has long been that their best work happens on other artists’ albums. Perhaps that’s an unfair standard to hold them to: After all, their collaborators tend to be some of the world’s most creative and forward-thinking artists, like Flying Lotus, Damon Albarn, and Dave Sitek, to name just a few. It might be their skillful use of negative space that pairs so well with such different compositional styles; maybe it’s the ultra-fine grit of Yukimi Nagano’s voice that serves as such an alluring foil for others to create their best work. But with a few exceptions, their most memorable songs have not been their own. On their own records, Little Dragon’s tendency to retread the retrofuturist aesthetic they’ve refined over the last 15 years has left much of their output feeling flat and uninspired. Part polished Brit R&B, part Swedish electro-pop, there’s an easy listening vibe to their oeuvre—think hi-fi beats to relax and study to—that feels like a waste of the potential they flashed on 2009’s Machine Dreams. But their new LP, New Me, Same Us—their first full-length for London’s Ninja Tune—is a welcome departure from their somewhat staid studio sessions, finally infusing their own work with the creative energy of their collaborations. New Me, Same Us doesn’t completely abandon their usual toolkit. Little Dragon still strike a delicate balance between the organic and the electronic, the danceable and the downtempo. They are at their best when they loosen up, forsaking technical precision in favor of a more free-flowing funk—led by Fredrik Wallin’s bass—that lets Nagano’s husky R&B vocals flow most naturally. Album standout “New Fiction” bottles this natural alchemy: Nagano’s voice and Wallin’s bass perform an elegant duet on the verses, intertwined like dance partners who’ve been waltzing together for years. And when Wallin is given free rein on the grand piano on the bridge, pummeling the high keys in a rare moment of unbridled expression, the band achieves a high-water mark that feels years in the making, injecting raw unpredictability into a sound typically defined by its slick studio sheen. In that sense, “New Fiction” is a bit of a tease; the rest of New Me, Same Us is relatively restrained. And while the record’s press materials tout the album as the band’s “most collaborative” yet, the creative exchange is mostly internal—the sole feature comes from Kali Uchis on “Are You Feeling Sad?”, a welcome if brief addition to the record’s tonal palette. But there’s evidence that their years assisting other artists, for so long an albatross they’ve sought to shed, have finally left an impression. “BULLETS,” their collaboration with Kaytranada, was one of 99.9%’s standouts, infusing Little Dragon’s glossy funk with Caribbean soul. The impact he made is evident from the first few minutes of New Me, Same Us, from the syncopated four-on-the-floor beat on “Hold On” to the jazzy swing of “Are You Feeling Sad?”, and even in the way Nagano’s voice fills the gaps left by the rhythm section on “New Fiction.” Their wider influences are also laid bare, to positive effect. They credit Massive Attack as a sonic ancestor to “Hold On,” and it’s easy to hear how Little Dragon’s swirling synths and clacking woodblock mirror the synthesized strings and staccato percussion of “Unfinished Sympathy.” Historically, Little Dragon albums have felt like collections of a band’s earnest attempts to find their groove, defined more by their failure to spark the magic than the few moments when they achieve it. And while New Me, Same Us is not entirely free of woe—the melancholy melody on “Every Rain” oozes existential ennui—for the most part, they sound like they’re having more fun than ever. Fifteen years in, they seem to have turned a corner, feeding off some of the inspiration that helped them stand out on other artists’ records. Perhaps they’ve finally discovered that they had as much to gain from their peers as they’ve been giving.","The Swedish electro-pop group’s first album for Ninja Tune is a welcome departure, finally infusing their own studio work with the creative energy of their collaborative sessions.

PITH,Melkbelly,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8642a6e21e4f0009eaf021/1:1/w_160/PITH_Melkbelly.jpg,2020-04-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/melkbelly-pith/,Wax NineCarpark,"Melkbelly—the project of married couple Miranda and Bart Winters, plus Bart’s brother Liam on bass and non-relative James Wetzel on drums—is a noise rock band on its surface, but a pop act at heart. Miranda and Bart met through the Chicago DIY scene, eventually forming Coffin Ships, a pop-oriented group that showcased Miranda’s sweet but firm delivery. Meanwhile, Wetzel took inspiration from Providence noise weirdos like Daughters and Lightning Bolt—his own project Ree-Yees suggests a truckload of drums swerving through traffic. On PITH, their second full-length, Melkbelly strike a robust and surprisingly warm balance between the spartan chaos of noise rock and the soft melodicism of bedroom pop. Melkbelly songs don’t so much expand the boundaries of these genres as shift between them. On “THC,” revving guitars and spoken-word vocals give way to circuitous chord progressions and honeyed sighs. It’s tempting to reduce these patterns to the “loud-quiet” dynamics that make grunge forebears like the Breeders so exhilarating. But where the Deal sisters delineate their modes with dramatic pauses and thick reverb, Melkbelly’s transitions are more freewheeling. When the guitars slow from a blitz to a meander, Miranda’s deadpan rasp fills the vacant space. By the time “THC” reaches the closest thing to a chorus, the band has traversed three time signatures. Miranda’s voice meets the challenge, sounding enraged and disaffected at once as her voice rises and falls to keep pace with the dense instrumentation. As they did on 2017’s Nothing Valley, Melkbelly set up daring rhythmic changes and layers of sludge—massive, overdriven guitars, sudden shifts in tempo—that find improbable reconciliation in driving counter-melodies. It can feel like the band is battling itself, goading one instrument (the drums on “Mr. Coda,” or the rhythm guitar on “Take H20”) to take the reigns. At the climax of “LCR,” Miranda’s vocals and Wetzel’s manic drumming both rise to a crescendo, wordless screams and razor-sharp snares each gaining power from the other, like two converging storms. But unlike Nothing Valley, which often came dangerously close to derailing, PITH reigns in its song structure, replacing the previous record’s instrumental drum tracks with tightly wound melodies. The overdriven guitars and reverberating vocals of “Season of the Goose” would sound at home beside post-punk revivalists like Interpol or the Strokes. Melkbelly expends so much energy ripping through verses, it can be easy to miss one of the band’s strongest assets: Miranda’s absurd and graphic lyrics, which address body horror and petty indie rock spats with equal ferocity. It’s her careful, almost precious delivery that keeps these topics—like food stuck between teeth and omelettes wedged under fingernails—from conjuring sheer disgust. On “Little Bug,” she sings the biography of an insect with the proudly precocious energy of an only child performing to an audience of dolls. When Melkbelly take aim at human pests, they’re less effective. “Kissing Under Some Bats” scolds a scene-going groupie: “Stop introducing yourself as ‘just a girlfriend’/Because it’s twee/And unnecessary.” From a band whose lyrics are typically so removed from reality, it comes across as cruel and bizarrely personal. “Humid Heart” similarly frays at its seams, the vocal breaking as the song stutters to a halt on what is ostensibly a chorus. On an album shrouded in such graphic and fantastical imagery, the lackluster moments stand out. But PITH always manages to regain traction. At its best, Miranda’s voice recalls the cutting dryness of fellow Chicagoan Liz Phair, sharing a wry intonation that lifts even the densest basslines to climactic peaks. When her performance matches the surrounding velocity, as on the pummeling “Stone Your Friends,” the militant intensity and drive resembles “Immigrant Song.” As an album, PITH begins to drag towards the end, closing with a track rightfully called “Flatness.” But as a series of singles, its meld of ’90s grunge and early-’00s noise is delightfully strange.","The Chicago band’s second album strikes a balance between the spartan chaos of noise rock and the soft melodicism of bedroom pop.

Three,The Necks,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84ef64ffd4cb0008aae7cd/1:1/w_160/Three_The%20Necks.jpg,2020-04-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-necks-three/,Northern Spy,"The Australian trio The Necks has spent over 30 years perfecting a strange sense of locomotion. Drawing on the intersecting traditions of jazz, improvisation, and ambient music, they’ve crafted an ultra-minimal music so obsessed with repetition it can feel like it’s standing still. Bassist Lloyd Swanton prefers a road-trip metaphor: Moving at high speed through a vast, unchanging landscape, it’s hard to notice the moment-to-moment differences in your surroundings. “But then you concentrate on something else for half an hour,” Swanton explains, “And when you look up you realize things have changed completely.” Their music makes the case for the virtues of patience and stillness as a listener. You can’t know exactly when or where the moments of novelty will come from, but there is a pleasure in knowing that they will eventually, and learning to love your surroundings until then. Three—a triptych of 20-plus minute tracks—does nothing to alter their approach. It is slow, winding, and meditative, composed almost entirely of piano, bass, and drums, and builds outwards from minimal meanderings to overgrown thickets of instrumentation. Though there are instrumental flourishes here and there—a bit of feedback, a synthesizer, and an organ or two—relative to the mutant-rock squalls of 2018’s Body, this is more familiar territory for the band. The closing track “Further” is in a lot of ways the prototypical Necks piece. It’s luxuriantly arranged, built around Chris Abrahams’ weightless piano lines that increase in density and intensity as the track goes on. There’s no post-rock catharsis or free-jazz climax, just a slow journey through parts unknown. It unfolds so gradually and delicately that you hardly notice that they eventually abandon the piano for the celestial hum of an organ, and then slowly phase both ideas together, into an arrangement more vibrant than you would have thought possible at the track’s plodding outset. Swanton has said that this track was a self-conscious attempt at evoking the band’s earlier albums, but each added layer and slow change still feels like an accident of physics more than any conscious choice. The record’s other two pieces, though different in tone, are united in approach. “Bloom” is more active, tense with snowballing momentum and potential energy. “Lovelock,” by contrast, is more sparse and distant, suffused with grief for the band’s friend Damien Lovelock of the band the Celibate Rifles, who died in 2019. Each is a slight variation on the themes that the band has explored over the course of their career, and it’s easy to look down on such single-mindedness. But when you get 15 minutes deep into one of these pieces and realize that a few aimless-feeling piano lines have suddenly coalesced into an impossibly lush environment, you can see why they’ve spent so long pursuing the same ideas. They’ve developed the ability to make the mundane feel miraculous.","More than 30 years into their career, the Australian experimental trio can still make the mundane feel miraculous.

PARTYMOBILE,PARTYNEXTDOOR,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e6f191f638000081a6a18/1:1/w_160/partymobile.jpg,2020-04-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/partynextdoor-partymobile/,OVO Sound,"There’s a running joke that PARTYNEXTDOOR only gets to release music once Drake passes on his records. If that’s true, Drake is doing him a favor by standing in his way, because almost every PARTYNEXTDOOR song would sound better if he weren’t the one singing. To PARTY’s credit, the appeal of his music has never been his bland and monotone vocals; he’s a writer. The Toronto-bred 26-year-old penned Rihanna’s “Work” and “Sex With Me”; his fingerprints are all over Drake’s arguable opus If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, and his early albums P1 and P2 are loaded with the hyper-specific writing that made him a breakout star. PARTY’s best music is all about the details. On  2014’s “Recognize,” PARTY’s signature record to this day, he doesn’t just tell us he’s obsessively in love, he shows it: he drives by his girlfriend’s condominium complex late at night to make sure she’s home safely. He even has conversations with the concierge about how she looks like a celebrity. He might seem like a great boyfriend checking in, but actually he’s paranoid she’s sleeping around just like he is. It’s like a good dark comedy—I’m sure Future has cracked a devilish smile to it at least once or twice. On PARTY’S new album, PARTYMOBILE, he’s no longer the writer he once was. His songs are impersonal and shallow, which is a bad pairing with his sleepy, robotic coos. “My girl’s bad like a kid that just eat candy,” he sings weakly on “Eye On It,” which will probably rack up streams at an Applebees looking for white noise. “Split Decision” has the makings of a classic PARTY track—a voicemail interlude and production that wouldn’t be out of place on So Far Gone—but PARTY’s writing has no color. “Just got back from a trip, caught me with another bitch,” he croons. We don’t learn where he went, how he got caught—none of the melodrama that would bring the track to life. “Savage Anthem” is a reminder of how great PARTY’s songwriting can be. Here, he gets caught cheating, not once, but three times—in a coupe, in his living room, in the VIP section of a strip club. But PARTY doesn’t apologize; instead he tries to manipulate his girl into thinking he’s a tortured soul that deserves pity. “I put the dirt into dirt bag/Still got your jacket in my bag/I stood you up, that was my bad/Gave me your heart, watch me break that,” he sings, as if enumerating his own flaws should equal forgiveness. He sounds like an over-dramatic slimeball, which is where he shines, but PARTYMOBILE doesn’t have nearly enough moments like this. Instead, most of the time PARTY sounds soulless. He rips the heart out of the light and bouncy island rhythm of “Touch Me.” Rihanna gets dragged into the mess on “Believe It.” She turned in her hook four days before the release of PARTYMOBILE and I’m surprised she did, given the formulaic acoustic guitar pop production made to die on the back half of a Khalid album. But once Rihanna settles into her pineapple-sweet melody the lyrics don’t sound so dry anymore and the beat suddenly becomes tolerable. Then PARTY starts to sing again and you realize how much better the songs on PARTYMOBILE would be in someone else’s hands.","The Toronto singer’s writing lacks the specificity that animates his best music this time around.

Before Love Came to Kill Us,Jessie Reyez,by: Kathryn St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e83770fe4c42e0008da7c7c/1:1/w_160/Before%20Love%20Came%20to%20Kill%20Us_Jessie%20Reyez.jpg,2020-04-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jessie-reyez-before-love-came-to-kill-us/,FMLYIsland,"The 2010s R&B renaissance gave rise to a lot of little renaissances, one of which is the R&B singer-songwriter. Their arrangements are acoustic and expensively dusty, like a piano whose warped keys are recorded from across an attic. Often the songs are R&B in name only; they sound like—and are intended as—alt-rock or folk. The lyrics might be florid, might be plainspoken, but will always be dead blunt. The first line will catch and bleed like a songwriting garrote, something like, “I should have fucked your friends.” Jessie Reyez’s Before Love Came to Kill Us begins with this hook. From there, she claws in deeper, addressing her ex in a deceptively sweet croon: “I’m the monster that you made, yeah, you made me/Now I’m just like you, so don’t complain.” She threatens to Goodfella them. On the axis from 0 to Kelis’ “Caught Out There,” Reyez is at the far furious end. And while Before Love Came to Kill Us is technically her debut, it follows several EPs of similarly unsparing music like “Gatekeeper,” a vicious, Clockwork Orange-referencing exposé of sexual harassment by a former producer (whom she later named as Detail). It’s the kind of thing young women are encouraged to quietly write out of their career narrative or else, and a genuine risk. Before Love Came to Kill Us showcases more of that high-stakes swagger. Reyez’s songwriting is extremely online—on one track she mentally Twitter-mutes a scrub—and extremely death-driven, whether she portrays herself as the death or the killer. Her voice is chameleonic and present in every guise: quirky lilt; delicate head voice; and, often and best, a blown-out, purposefully ragged belt that sounds like it’s trying to claw its way out of the recording. What’s most satisfying about Before Love Came to Kill Us isn’t that Reyez whizzes across multiple genres—these days, who doesn’t?—but the skill she displays at each. No matter the arrangement, she powers across it at full force. “Intruders,” with shades of Kali Uchis’ “Tyrant,” is as romantic as it is subtly unsettling: “a love song, a war song,” and a metaphor of love as colonialism, of scorching other people’s earth. Equally alluring and disturbing is the woozy 6LACK duet “Imported.” Reyez’s and 6LACK’s vocals slip from background to foreground on the chorus; Reyez’s verses dissolve mid-flirt into nothing. Both artists, though commanding presences, surrender to the anonymity of the affair, singing some variation on “my name is fuck it, ’cause my name is not important.” The album takes its title from “Kill Us,” a power ballad built atop guitar heroics, like something Miguel would do. Best of all is the glitchy, carefree party-starter “Dope,” full-to-bursting with slyly lewd vocals and whoops. Like all “debut” albums stitched together from various EPs—themselves stitched together from standalone singles and streaming-only tracks—the album has a cursory feel. Much of its best material has been around for years, like the radioactively angry “Kiddo” offcut “Deaf” and the breakout single “Figures,” or a newly remixed version of “Imported”. Sometimes it’s the other way around: Early versions of “Ankles” sent to streaming suggested the track was meant to feature Rico Nasty and Melii, which is either a metadata screwup or the reason the solo version on Before Love Came to Kill Us sounds a little unfinished and thin. Like many recent pop records, the album is overlong, and the extraneous material tends to be the kind of filler that Reyez is well above. “Love in the Dark” and “I Do” are fusty ballads, and while Reyez sings the hell out of them, she’s also mixed way to the front, as if her producers don’t trust her performance alone to elevate the song. Likewise, “Coffin” is the requisite doo-wop track many an R&B singer has done in the past few years. Reyez revels in its melodrama anyway, drawing up blueprints for coffins built for two—but then 2020 Eminem arrives, an entirely different kind of grim. (Gather ’round the coffin, kids, and let me tell you of a time when the average Eminem verse was at least as funny as 6LACK saying “Six-Lack.”) But all these flaws have less to do with Reyez than the industry she’s in. Throughout, she proves adept at cutting through its BS and noise—by being louder.","The powerhouse singer’s voice is chameleonic and present in every guise. Her debut is most satisfying not because she whizzes across multiple genres, but because of the skill she displays at each.

Forever Just Beyond,Clem Snide,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e84ae72e21e4f0009eaf017/1:1/w_160/Clem-Snide_Forever-Just-Beyond_COVER.jpg,2020-04-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clem-snide-forever-just-beyond/,Ramseur/Thirty Tigers,"Eef Barzelay has spent his career in a lonely spot. The Israeli-born singer-songwriter who records under the name Clem Snide has stumbled through all the trappings of alternative fame: a short-lived major-label deal, a tight-knit community of fans, a self-sustained schedule of crowd-sourced tours and new releases. But his timing has never quite worked. He was a buzz band before buzz bands existed, an early adopter who never cashed in. Put it this way—there are cult favorites and then there are the musicians who find themselves, two decades into their careers, performing at their fans’ family gatherings. “Thanks for coming? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to say in this situation,” Barzelay said, guitar strapped around his neck, greeting attendees of Kim and Carla and Jim and Mary’s joint anniversary party in 2014. This tragic, comic perseverance has long informed his music. When Clem Snide began in the mid ’90s, Barzelay’s work was lumped in with a wave of alt-country bands, mostly due to the distinctive sound of his voice: a hoarse, twangy grumble, pitched somewhere between Jeff Tweedy and Jeff Mangum. But from the beginning, Barzelay’s visions were more playful and absurd than his contemporaries’: “The Dairy Queen has melted/Having laid all her eggs,” went a typical opening couplet. As he soldiered on, his songwriting grew both more adventurous and more direct; as of late, he’s been offering to write specially commissioned biographical songs for his listeners. Our world is small and our time here is brief, he seems to say. Why not get to know each other? He opens up a bit on Forever Just Beyond, the first Clem Snide album in five years. After seeing a video of the Avett Brothers covering one of his songs, Barzelay reached out to Scott Avett to collaborate on new material and, possibly, help revitalize his career. Together they crafted a comeback album that feels both charmingly at ease and refreshingly ambitious. Like kindred spirits bonding over a packed bowl, they immediately turn to the big questions. Within the first three songs, they discuss the supposed final words of film critic Roger Ebert (“It’s all an elaborate hoax”), the nature of humanity itself (“We are a wave endlessly breaking”), and at least one man’s definition of the word “God” (deep breath: “God is simply that which lies forever just beyond the limit/Of what we already seem to know”). It’s heady stuff, and Avett is smart to pair Barzelay with the most natural, elegant production of his career. In the past, his best work has been artfully orchestrated (2001’s The Ghost of Fashion, 2005’s End of Love) or purposefully unadorned (2006’s solo album Bitter Honey). These songs split the difference with a healthy dose of reverb, layered acoustic guitar, campfire percussion, and background vocals that linger and dissipate like clouds of smoke. While the lyrics turn constantly toward the meaning of life and the inevitability of death, the music is content to simply float along, understated and picturesque. Or as Barzelay puts it in “Easy,” “We only see through keyholes/But maybe that’s all that our eyes can take.” Around the announcement of the record, Barzelay, who turns 50 this year, made a confession: “That this record even exists, as far as I’m concerned, is a genuine miracle.” He described his forties as being full of both “deep despair and amazing opportunities,” and the record draws on both types of experience with the same sense of wonder. In “Easy,” he explores the meaningless of the term “selling out” in a world where the personal stakes for making art seem unbearably high. Even more intense is “The Ballad of Eef Barzelay,” a dreamlike narrative that cycles through suicidal thoughts, self-help, and a memory of cooking lamb kebab for his weed guy. It’s as personal as any song he’s written, but it’s also, amid the album’s grand theorizing of the universe, just as profound—a story of survival that Barzelay sounds grateful just to be here singing.","This comeback album, assisted by Scott Avett, feels both charmingly at ease and refreshingly ambitious, grappling with life’s big questions over understated, easygoing production.

Yene Mircha,Hailu Mergia,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7b89f21f638000081a69f4/1:1/w_160/YENE.jpg,2020-04-02 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hailu-mergia-yene-mircha/,Awesome Tapes From Africa,"When Hailu Mergia left Ethiopia to tour America with the Walias Band in the 1980s, he decided to stick around. Moving to Washington D.C., he started a restaurant, managed a club, and formed The Zula band. Any of these ventures could swallow the energy of one person, but Mergia also rented a studio in order to reacquaint himself with the accordion, an instrument he played in his youth. What emerged from these sessions was Hailu Mergia & His Classical Instrument, a mesmerizing combination of drum machine and accordion improvisations. While the collection was an immediate hit in Ethiopia, it did not find an audience elsewhere, so Mergia quit music and started driving a cab, practicing his keyboard on his breaks. That was the end of the story until Awesome Tapes From Africa reissued the tape in 2013 to universal acclaim, and Mergia went on an international tour. It took time, but his devotion paid off. Two years ago, Mergia put out his first album in almost two decades, Lala Belu. Joined by Mike Majkowski on upright bass and Tony Buck on drums, Mergia showed his hypnotic powers had only grown during his time outside the spotlight. On his latest, Yene Mircha (My Choice), Mergia leads a larger group of collaborators on an inward journey. The flute-like rustle on the opening groove “Semen Ena Debub” comes from the masenqo, a bowed lute with one string, which merges nicely with Mergia’s accordion. They trade solos, creating a joyous waltz that breaks into a rousing jam toward the track’s end, and the effect is like emerging from an empty street into a friend’s home filled with familiar faces. Throughout, Mergia shifts comfortably between the elegiac and the ecstatic. The Rhodes solo that opens “Yene Mircha” seems like preparation for a low-key jazz standard, yet it erupts into raucous horns and dreamy guitar licks. “Bayine Lay Yihedal,” a lucid vamp interspersed with spaced-out snare, provides a brief respite from this outpouring. Mergia’s discipline makes for a series of constrained fireworks—small eruptions that pass you by on a first listen but become unforgettable the next. Mergia turns “Shemendefer,” a synth ballad by Ethopian pop artist Teddy Afro, into a low-octane burner, keeping only the chorus and surrounding it with light piano and organ and skating along its surface with his plaintive accordion solos. Elevated by his collaborators, Mergia displays the tenacious spirit you expect from a person who walked into a studio to practice the accordion and emerged with a masterpiece. Mergia’s power to transfix seems to grow with the more collaborators he has, and their addition does not detract from his resolute sound. The onetime lone wanderer now leads newfound followers up a trail he cut for himself.","The Ethiopian cult musician returns with a collaborative full-band exploration that is no less hypnotic than his celebrated earlier work.

Ghosts V: Together / Ghosts VI: Locusts,Nine Inch Nails,by: Sean T. Collins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e69a2fd3a8b0008fc4f47/1:1/w_160/ghostsv.jpg,2020-04-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nine-inch-nails-ghosts-v-together-ghosts-vi-locusts/,The Null CorporationThe Null Corporation,"It was right and proper of Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor to name his expansive, four-volume 2008 suite of instrumental work Ghosts; in the Dickensian sense, they foretold his future. Consisting more of sketches than songs—only six of the albums’ 36 tracks run over four minutes, often just barely—Ghosts presaged Reznor and his collaborator Atticus Ross’ work as soundtrack composers, a sideline that would soon compete with Nine Inch Nails as the pair’s creative outlet of choice. The music that resulted from this transition to instrumental recordings netted the pair an Oscar and often surpassed the quality of the films and television series it was written to accompany. The fifth and sixth volumes of Ghosts (subtitled Together and Locusts respectively) return to the atmospheric terrain now familiar from Reznor and Ross’ soundtrack work: buzzy ambience, simple melodic hooks, an emotional palette that vacillates between peace and dread. But rather than soundtracking an on-screen drama, they arise from the very real COVID-19 pandemic and its society-wide remedy, social distancing. The musicians say that the current crisis was the reason they completed the two records in the first place, “as a means of staying somewhat sane.” As such, Ghosts V-VI—released for free less than two months after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency—are very likely the first major albums to have been inspired by the coronavirus crisis. These two Ghosts volumes feel much more concrete and ambitious than the original quartet. Each has its own clear-cut identity, too: Volume five (Together) has a more hopeful sound, while volume six (Locusts) is where the dread creeps in. And while the 2008 iteration’s songs were short as a rule, many of the tracks here are uncharacteristically sprawling. This isn’t about getting ideas down on tape and shooting them into the world—this is about identifying an emotional angle and working it as long and as hard as possible. Maybe it’s because the tone better matches the animating spirit of the project, or maybe it’s simply because the pair have better ideas in a major key at the moment, but Ghosts V: Together is solidly the stronger of the two. Opening track “Letting Go While Holding On” begins with a woozy, eardrum-tickling buzz, adding a five-note melody and layered, synthesized vocals until it feels almost like a choral composition. It’s followed by “Together,” which employs the same basic structure to even stronger effect. The album’s subsequent tracks each introduce a novel element or two into that basic template. “Out in the Open” begins with a sort of faux string section, lending it a filmic feel; “Apart” brings in a flute midway through; “Your Touch” adds science-fictional bleeps, sweeps, and creeps. Throughout, there’s a vibe of quiet optimism. By the time the closing track, “Still Right Here,” rolls around, you’re so used to ambient uplift that when a full-fledged rhythm erupts around the 4:30 mark, it’s as bracing as cold water in the face. Ghosts VI: Locusts is Together’s opposite number. It’s anxious and anxiety-inducing, very much of a piece with Reznor and Ross’ Watchmen score; indeed, from its clockwork motif on down, the opening “The Cursed Clock” feels like an unused excerpt from that world of paranoid superheroes. To their credit, the composers introduce a slew of novel elements here—horns in “Around Every Corner” and “The Worriment Waltz,” a huge “The Perfect Drug”-style drum breakdown in “Run Like Hell,” the sound of some massive thing inhaling and exhaling in “Just Breathe,” a susurrus of sampled vocals in “Turn This Off Please,” a cyclical heartbeat in closing track “Almost Dawn.” Yet without Together’s relatively rousing melodic template and pacing to propel it, Locusts often feels like its titular swarm, devouring itself for 80-plus minutes until there’s not much left by the end. Ghosts V-VI speak to their moment in just the way Reznor and Ross intended. Trapped in homes and apartments with only ourselves for company, we can all use music that feels as alternately hopeful and despairing as we do—and consuming it in two-and-a-half-hour chunks is not nearly the tall task it might have been a month ago. With these albums in your ear, you can soar and/or jitter at your leisure.","Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross strike a tone similar to their soundtrack work, alternating between hope and dread in sprawling ambient meditations released in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Caretaker,Half Waif,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e71ff0adecd0008700e36/1:1/w_160/halfwaifcaretaker.jpg,2020-04-01 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/half-waif-the-caretaker/,Anti-,"There’s always been a sense of disquiet in Half Waif’s swirling electro-pop. Engulfed by clouds of synth and feverish beats, frontwoman Nandi Rose searches for resolution to her nebulous inner turmoil, a constant battle between her desire to be known and her suspicion that she never truly will be. On her last album, Lavender, she looked outwards, hoping to find meaning in the places and people around her. On songs like “Lavender Burning,” New York represented the permanent home and stability she longed for on the road. While writing her new album The Caretaker, Rose lived in one place (her home in the Hudson Valley) and wrote without a band. Though she grapples with the same turmoil as before—her hunger for love, her need for solitude, the loss of certain friendships—she is now coping alone. The other people on the album largely feel incidental, written into songs, as she says on “Siren,” only when she feels uninspired. Even falling in love, which she describes as “taking on the burn,” is an acquisition of someone else’s pain, a burden she carries by herself. An acutely self-aware writer, Rose realizes the emotional shortcomings of this approach. She renders a nuanced, deeply compelling portrait of a woman turning away from the world just when she needs help the most. When she finished writing the album, Rose realized the perspective was not hers, but that of a character, someone who has been “entrusted with taking care of this estate, taking care of the land, and she’s not doing a very good job. The weeds are growing everywhere, and she’s not taking care of herself.” There are sonic ties to her home, from the bug sounds in the mix on “Lapsing,” which were recorded in her backyard, to the introductory beat on “Halogen 2,” which incorporated the sound of a train she can hear from her porch. She often sings about her home, though more as a shelter than as an estate she's capable of caring for. On “Window Place,” she anticipates an oncoming winter, a dark period of pain and loneliness that she chooses to wait out from her room, watching her life pass by as if looking out of a window. This sense of passivity permeates throughout the album, often symbolized by the passing of the seasons. Instead of taking action to address her frustrations, on songs like “Blinking Light” she waits for summer, an imagined future when she will inevitably feel better. Rose’s best songs build into revelations, cracking the surface to reveal another truth buried deep inside. On The Caretaker, she uses this effect to portray the titular character as an unreliable narrator, someone who is trying to assert her independence, but who might be coming apart more than she acknowledges. Album highlight “Ordinary Talk” begins with a bold cry for independence: “Baby don’t worry about me/I don't worry about you.” Buoyed by a relentless drum beat, Rose sounds self-assured. But half-way through, the drums cut out and we’re introduced to her most bare emotional truths; she’s crying in her coffee and sitting in the dark. As the drums work back in and the vocals layer into an ethereal cocoon, she builds her loneliness into a spectacle, allowing it to intermingle beautifully with her desire for solitude. “Blinking Light” further heightens the tension between Rose’s self perception and reality. She sings with such resolution that she’ll be better by June that you’re genuinely startled when the chorus comes in, shepherded by her crystalline vocals: “I know what you’re thinking/I’m circling the drain.” As Rose paints an inept but tenacious character at its center, The Caretaker emerges as a deeply relatable portrayal of attempted self care. There’s a grandiosity, almost a theatricality, to these songs, from the layered vocals to the flourishes of ornate imagery—morning stars, bodies full of thorns — to the maturity of Rose’s voice, which soars on nearly every chorus on the album. But grounded in mundane moments, the music never feels overwrought; the sun sets, the laundry gets folded, winter comes and then summer does. The instrumentation also expertly mirrors the emotional tenor of the lyrics, like the chugging beat and distorted vocals “Halogen 2,” which convey Rose’s gnawing anxiety and loneliness. As a result, the rich orchestral compositions on The Caretaker sound effortless and fluid like cursive. In crafting such complex, accessible songs, Rose reveals just how ordinary it is to feel at war with yourself, to not know what you want or how to get it. The Caretaker is roughly divided in half by the improvised, droning synth interlude, “Lapsing,” which marks the distinction between the anxiety-ridden first half to the second half, which emits flickers of hope. Rose was listening to a lot of Robyn when writing this album and the emotional influence is clear; joy and despair intermingle beautifully on every song. The album opens with a wave of inky synth as Rose’s character endlessly runs uphill with no end to her frustration in sight. By contrast, album closer, “Window Place,” a cinematic ballad of piano, synth, and umpteen layers of reverberating vocals, sounds triumphant. She does not overcome her pain, but accepts it as transient, which feels freeing enough. The Caretaker’s fixation on the future and fumbling attempts at self care make it an eerily relevant quarantine listen. This is an album of waiting for things to get better but not knowing exactly how or why they will. At a time when our government has failed us so badly that the best response to a global pandemic is individual action, these songs validate the confusion and anxiety of tackling a colossal burden alone. But as Rose tries to comfort herself with visions of summertime, the Caretaker can ultimately provide some solace that a brighter future will come, and hope in our abilities to care for ourselves, no matter how messy the journey is.","Synth-pop auteur Nandi Rose renders a nuanced, deeply compelling portrait of a woman turning away from the world just when she needs help the most.

Snapshot of a Beginner,Nap Eyes,by: Rob Arcand,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e746f1f638000081a6a1c/1:1/w_160/snapshot.jpg,2020-04-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nap-eyes-snapshot-of-a-beginner/,Jagjaguwar,"Nigel Chapman spends a lot of time singing about his own inability to take action. Whether seated on the couch at a party or pacing the desolate streets of his hometown, the Nap Eyes frontman habitually falls back on restless indecision, spinning stories about his own passivity in the face of existential concerns. The best Nap Eyes songs offer a subtle shift to the active tense amid this anxious, wine-drunk detachment, with sparse, lo-fi arrangements that split the difference between the Velvet Underground and their many ’90s alt-rock descendants (Pavement, Sebadoh, Yo La Tengo). On Snapshot of a Beginner, their fourth studio album, Nap Eyes build on these moments of solipsistic brilliance, pairing a newfound lyrical confidence with sharper, more intentional arrangements that lend the project fresh weight. In the process, Nap Eyes take risks that would have once seemed at odds with their reputation for starry-eyed introversion. “Mark Zuckerberg,” a humble ode to the awkward tech overlord, bypasses the armchair critique of social media to cast the Facebook founder as a kind of folkloric legend: “Is Mark Zuckerberg a ghost? Maybe, maybe/Where are his hands? And why don’t you ever see them in public?” Chapman’s voice bears a startling resemblance to Soft Bulletin-era Wayne Coyne, while the band trades the sparseness of their early material for gentle guitar chords and gleaming Mellotron harmonies. Chapman’s songwriting, long the driving force of the project, finds new footing in the album’s emphasis on arrangement. “Primordial Soup” introduces a synthesizer into the mix as Chapman rehashes a familiar subtext of Darwinian evolution: If the entire universe is the result of a “billion simple molecules” combined in precisely the right way, where does that leave God? As clean guitar loops and synth pads give way to thundering distortion, Chapman inches closer toward a definitive answer. “Might feel frustrated but does it mean anything?/Might feel lonely but what’s the meaning?” he shouts. It’s a sentiment familiar to anyone who’s struggled to capture an emotion in words, yet one that’s representative of Chapman’s approach to songwriting, which finds an implicit universalism in these moments of clumsy ineptitude. Where earlier albums achieved this feeling through lyrics alone, Snapshot of a Beginner incorporates songwriting into a wider vision, one that feels truer to the band’s intentions. “Fool Thinking Ways” pulls the steady acoustic strum of earlier songs like “Boats Appear” into a hushed meditation that waxes and wanes with Chapman’s spirit, rising with the excitement of a breakthrough before deflating at the recognition of his own subconscious habits. “And that’s when it happened to me/That the change in my thinking set me free,” he sings, guitars soaring higher to match his mood. Like much of the album, the track feels like a concerted response to the occasional aimlessness of Nap Eyes’ previous material, even as they try—and mostly succeed in—maintaining the same lightness. “But now I think again/Because I’m sick of making my process the subject of my songs,” Chapman sings on album closer “Though I Wish I Could.” Yet for every moment of heady introspection, there’s an equal and opposite song about Zuckerberg or The Legend of Zelda, punctuating an album otherwise dominated by Chapman’s inner monologue with moments of genuine charm. It’s a testament to his songwriting versatility and a new benchmark for Nap Eyes at their most ambitious.","Gathering newfound lyrical confidence, the Halifax slack-rockers trade the sparseness of their early material for gentle guitar chords and gleaming Mellotron harmonies.

Love Is an Art,Vanessa Carlton,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7e6c6ce21e4f0009eaefe3/1:1/w_160/loveisanart.jpg,2020-04-01 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vanessa-carlton-love-is-an-art/,Dine Alone,"Having outlived the breathless infatuations of her early songbook, TRL survivor Vanessa Carlton now seeks transcendence in the interstices: midnight walks down cold city blocks, pregnant pauses, and marginal, hard-won absolution. Demarcated by 2011’s Rabbits on the Run, a foreboding record about turning 30 amidst Manhattan’s waning charms, Carlton’s late period is highlighted by 2015’s Liberman, an arresting work rife with gothic imagery delivered at an omniscient remove. All that remains of her first singles is a theatrical flair and plaintive abandon. While she’s scaled back on her meticulous string arrangements, she fills her songs with winding asides and interludes, confessionals which build to rapturous climaxes and end with stray bars or abandoned verses. “The Only Way to Love,” the centerpiece of her sixth full-length Love Is an Art, is a declaration which accretes in momentum and instrumental layers. The chorus surges in fits and starts; it has a bedeviling bridge and a hopeful coda. The symbolism is a bit overwritten—as ever, there’s an abundance of wayward soldiers and nautical expeditions—but the way Carlton vacillates between first and second person lends a worldly wisdom to her insights. Carlton’s lyrics are threaded with affirmative truisms, like teenaged diaries edited by an older, wiser life coach. “This place won’t bite, but it won’t save you either,” she sings on the otherwise intimate “Future Pain,” which swells with warm guitars before culminating in a stirring instrumental breakdown. The mid-album interlude “Patience” offers assurance from an opposite shore: “You will wait for it/You will know when it’s right/Please let go/When you can’t control.” On the more enigmatic songs, Carlton scales up her narrative scope by acting as an observer rather than the protagonist, an impressionistic technique she deployed successfully throughout Liberman. Between her allusive lyrics and percussion-free ballads, Carlton’s never quite approached easy listening, although Love Is an Art is her most ambient record to date. Since Rabbits on the Run, she’s applied a spacious reverb which burnishes her lilting voice and lends the piano a cascading effect, raising the dramatic stakes of her songs’ quiet moments. The sparse electronica and disembodied vocals of “I Can’t Stay the Same” evoke New Age, and the title track’s forceful piano chords stand in for the dizzying keyboard runs she once favored. On the songs with any drums to speak of—it’s about a 50/50 split—the snare advances at a slow, emphatic march. As an album artist, Carlton’s been deliberate: there’s the album about fleeing her life for New York, the one about fleeing New York for her life, and the suite of wry set pieces submitted as anonymous demos. These albums were tensely plotted, almost operatic, while Love Is an Art suffers a bit from a lack of stage direction. “Back to Life” and “Salesman” are lively arrangements with luminous melodies, but their placement at the record’s end underscores the more dirge-like pace of its first half. There are a few oblique paeans to motherhood, yet Carlton remains most inspired by the switchbacks of romantic love; the anthropomorphic metaphors of “Companion Star” and “I Know You Don’t Mean It” feel too much like abstractions. “Bad boys become sad boys, it’s only cute when you’re young,” she proclaims on “Future Pain.” By now Carlton understands the pull of self-pity, and on Love Is an Art melancholy is less an affliction than a depth to be plumbed. Coming from a songwriter who loves blindly and aches desperately, the silver linings count.","On her sixth studio album, the former TRL star writes and sings with worldly wisdom and plaintive abandon.

Cenizas,Nicolás Jaar,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7a730bcfc3810009cca530/1:1/w_160/a2503291994_10.jpg,2020-03-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nicolas-jaar-cenizas/,Other People,"Nicolás Jaar wrote much of his arresting third album in isolation, holed up in a remote corner of the world without booze, cigarettes, or caffeine. It was an attempt to rid himself of negativity, the electronic musician said, but the solitude didn’t work as he planned. Negativity haunted him, as did his ego, and eventually Jaar realized the only way out was through: that he’d have to face his flaws in order to heal. (Indeed, the optically deceptive cover art suggests a turn inward.) Cenizas latches onto this revelation and burns with suspense, fury, and sadness. It isn’t a work of clarity but of cleansing—of reckoning with constructive anger—and offers little relief aside from a few fleeting moments that are so vivid and lovely they almost hurt. It’s Jaar at his most interrogating and existential, exploring grim atmospheres that feel both hallucinatory and troublingly real—a relatable image in a disorienting time. Occasionally, the audacious way Jaar strings sounds together—warping melodies, skewing rhythms, stretching soundscapes into horizons of feeling—can make you question your perception. How can it sound both noisy and minimal, mournful and alive? Layer by layer, he reveals new dimensions and expands our understanding of what this album is: a cerebral study in sound design that insists upon asymmetry and atonality; a storm of texture and tension that refuses tidy resolution; a heady, meditative glimpse into Jaar’s widening third eye; a quietly radical political statement about inequality and resistance. It is a world in which future jazz, warped psychedelia, ambient noise, and monastic chanting coil together like vines–an example, perhaps, of the producer’s own vision of coexistence. Jaar, a Chilean American who grew up between Santiago and New York City, appears to be feeling a heightened sense of geopolitical dread. Both countries are in states of violent unrest, albeit of different forms—riots and uprisings across Chile, a slow and ugly unraveling in the U.S.—and it’s hard to find an interview where Jaar doesn’t sound distressed. (His father, the activist-artist Alfredo Jaar, looms in his work.) Over time, Jaar’s music has become increasingly confrontational and politically charged. His 2011 debut Space Is Only Noise introduced listeners to his disruptive spirit and global tastes. Sirens, his ambient-leaning follow-up, conceived partly in reaction to the rise of Donald Trump, illuminated the cyclical nature of power and the illusion of democracy. Jaar now runs a handful of musical operations—the excellent techno-club alias Against All Logic, the Dave Harrington team-up Darkside, and his own label, Other People—all of which delight in dissonance and rage against cliché. Outside of his solo projects, he’s worked with FKA twigs on her 2019 album MAGDALENE, crafted pipe organ compositions for a cathedral in the Netherlands, collaborated with sound artists in the West Bank, and performed through speakers buried in the Arabian desert for an installation about land rights and climate change. Jaar is determined, he’s often repeated, to explore electronica as a form of protest: “Can electronic music talk about the world around us? Can we get out of this abstract bubble? How can we resist?” All of these endeavors show up in Cenizas—the choir in “Hello, Chain,” the monastic humming in “Xerox,” the references to saints and sin in “Sunder”—but Jaar’s environmental efforts also trickle in. After completing an artist residency at Amsterdam’s Het HEM, he participated in an exhibit questioning the military’s use of local forests and quoted anthropologist Anna Tsing: “These livelihoods... show us how to look around, rather than ahead.” The line reappears in “Faith Made of Silk,” the album’s absorbing final track, where it doubles as a call to action. “A peak is just the way towards a descent,” he warns. “You have nowhere to look/Look around not ahead.” Given all the technical ground Cenizas covers, Jarr is an impressively meticulous guide. Every pluck, ping, buzz, scratch, and whistle is intentional, a bump in the tunnel as you slide down the rabbit hole. Once you’re there, he makes even the most discomfiting sounds—a frantic glissando after a tirade of keys, the squawk of a bow dragged across muted cello strings—feel natural. As these foreign environments begin to feel familiar, the less attached you become to your reality. Jaar seems eager to make you question your instincts. On “Gocce,” he plays with order and chaos, control and surrender, until you’ve suddenly forgotten which you prefer. Do you sink into the meditative loops of “Garden” and rock in its hammock of major-to-minor keys? Or do you prefer the spontaneous turbulence of “Rubble”? Your impressions might shift as you venture deeper. “Agosto” mystified me the first four or five listens, so fitful and deranged. Now, I’m dumbstruck by its strange, serpentine beauty. Every mysterious element of Cenizas—the prickly stimulations, slithering melodies, unnerving atmospheres, and imposing instrumentation—feels designed to get under your skin and stir you awake. Despite the urgency that permeates the album, it never feels sanctimonious or preachy. Jaar is subtle and ambiguous, sometimes frustratingly so; even his rage is rendered in mournful tones and heaving, negative space. “Mud,” one of the few tracks with a steady beat, marches right up to conflict but doesn’t engage, evaporating into high-pitched hums and electronic vibrations. You can’t help but wonder if Jaar is holding back, and if that in itself is a form of resistance. As he indicated on Sirens, his mission isn’t to further an agenda as much as it is to implore us to act—to speak truth to power, to save ourselves. Cenizas is an album for inner battles, where it’s even more important to keep the faith. Jaar uses the Spanish word for ashes because of its duality; it’s a reminder that destruction generates renewal.","The Chilean American producer’s latest album is his most probing and existential, taking influences from all over his career and placing them into grim atmospheres that slip in and out of reality.

Devotion,Margaret Glaspy,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e72807bba9c2b0009225090/1:1/w_160/Devotion_Margaret%20Glaspy.jpg,2020-03-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/margaret-glaspy-devotion/,ATO,"Margaret Glaspy’s 2016 debut Emotions & Math was effective and confident blues-rock, grounded in the strains of folk, and elevated by a bombastic Shawn Everett mix. Two years later, her Born Yesterday EP adopted a stripped-back live sound, allowing her songs to come together regardless of arrangement. After a brief hiatus, she reconvened with producer Tyler Chester and traded guitars for Ableton, becoming the latest folk musician to embrace electronics. But reinventions do not guarantee a satisfying record. Without the self-assurance of her debut, Glaspy’s follow-up, Devotion, is an album in search of an identity. Part lighthearted synth-pop, part mild-mannered MOR pop, it’s too slight to endanger a promising career but too bland to be an interesting misfire. With Devotion, Glaspy trades swagger for sincerity, risking corniness for the sake of honest expression. It should feel liberating—and writing it likely did—but on record it’s either unimaginative or baffling. With the exception of “You Amaze Me,” buried towards the end of the record, Glaspy strays away from the favorable Elliott Smith comparisons of her debut. As Devotion attempts to push in new directions, misguided stylistic choices turn into distractions. When Glaspy opens “Killing What Keeps Us Alive” with a garbled vocoder, it only recalls the sound Imogen Heap perfected 15 years ago. Nothing else is equally jarring, but the stylistic missteps continue throughout. “What’s the Point” leads with a dubstep synth before delving into an aimless imitation of John Congleton’s crunchy, flanged productions. Ballads like “Young Love” and “Without Him” are closer to Sara Bareilles territory, without the benefit of Bareilles’ extroversion and big choruses. Title track “Devotion” veers so far into adult-contemporary R&B that it begins to resemble Maroon 5’s “Sunday Morning.” When Glaspy and Chester do land on a memorable, sinuous groove with “You’ve Got My Number,” the song stumbles over ungainly lyrics like, “And if I had to choose just a few words to summarize you/‘Gorgeous’ and ‘true’ wouldn’t surprise you.” The simplistic couplets and labored aphorisms are the record’s biggest disappointment. Glaspy’s penchant for stringing together idioms turns whole verses into mush: “They say two halves make a whole/But I am half empty and you are half full,” she proclaims on “Without Him.” On the lone rocker “So Wrong It’s Right,” a series of dog puns abruptly turns maudlin: “Tonight I’m off the leash, running wild and free/And you just so happen to be right next to me.” Glaspy’s wordplay sometimes leaned on “fish in the sea”-style clichés in the past, but here the folksy turns of phrase become overwhelming. The preciousness muddles her ideas, like the non-dichotomy posed by “Stay With Me”: “When it all shakes down/Who’s the clown and who’s the savior?” Devotion is not a disaster, but the chasm between ambition and execution feels vast. The new ideas are ill-fitting, when they’re not derivative from the start. Beneath the processing, the album’s best moments sound oddly like a less polished version of Emotions & Math. Even “You Amaze Me,” a lovely intimate acoustic number, feels like a lesser “Somebody to Anybody,” a lovely intimate acoustic number from the last album. Otherwise, little on this record works with Glaspy’s strengths as a songwriter—or, due to the change in instrumentation, as a musician. There are still glimpses of her usual frank, heartfelt songwriting on Devotion, but they’re not worth seeking out in a package this dull.","Without the self-assurance of her debut, the New York songwriter’s second full-length is an album in search of an identity.

Abolition of the Royal Familia,The Orb,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7b8b2f2a26d50009079271/1:1/w_160/abolition.jpg,2020-03-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-orb-abolition-of-the-royal-familia/,Cooking Vinyl,"With Andrew Weatherall gone and the KLF occupied with conceptual art, the Orb are the last act standing from the magical moment in British music when house, reggae, and ambient collided with a mischievous sense of humor. Abolition of the Royal Familia, the Orb’s new studio album, is no match for Chill Out, Screamadelica or other landmarks of the post-acid-house era. But it feels like a guardian of the flame that Weatherall and his peers ignited: melodic, adventurous, and slyly political, a far-out dispatch from one of the most brilliantly infuriating sonic adventurers of the electronic age. After the rambling of 2018’s No Sounds Are Out of Bounds and the horizontal ambience of 2016’s COW / Chill Out, World!, the opening half of Abolition of the Royal Familia is a return to the pop-house Orb of “Toxygene” or “Perpetual Dawn,” where abstraction and atmosphere cede place to beats and hooks. The opening “Daze (Missing & Messed Up Mix)” and “House of Narcotics (Opium Wars Mix)” are both straight-up vocal house numbers whose mixdowns betray the slightest touch of the Orb’s dub influences. “Hawk Kings (Oseberg Buddhas Buttonhole)” is even more rambunctious, a pumping house gem that incorporates spinal-stretching string rushes and wistful robotic chatter in tribute to Orb fan Stephen Hawking. House isn’t the only element to come clattering to the fore on Abolition of the Royal Familia: At times, the album feels like the Orb are peeling back the layers to reveal their inspirations. Reggae has long been an influence, usually stretched out and dubbed off into the cosmos, in keeping with the band’s origins in London chill-out rooms. But tracks like “Shape Shifters (In Two Parts) [Coffee & Ghost Train Mix]” and “Say Cheese (Siberian Tiger Cookie Mix)” are notably earthbound, the work of dialed-in humans on actual instruments rather than smoked-out alien adventurers. On songs like these, the Orb don’t feel so far removed from similarly enduring musical travellers the Grateful Dead, albeit a Dead brought up on Scientist LPs and Monty Python specials, rather than Owsley and the blues. This touch of humor is important. For a band whose best moments—particularly their debut album, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld—are gorgeously otherworldly, this excursion into the human realm can feel a little too close to reality. But the free-spiritedness of Abolition of the Royal Familia, with preposterous samples stacked on top of each other in gleefully arranged collages, separates the Orb from their more po-faced peers while providing a through line to their gag-packed career. “Say Cheese” starts with what appears to be British actor/director Richard Ayoade talking about cheese, while the intro to “Ital Orb (Too Blessed to Be Stressed Mix)” features a news item about the effect of “killer dope” on a baby squirrel. Depending upon your tolerance for musical tomfoolery, you might be charmed, revolted, or bored stiff. Like good situationists, the Orb mix this absurdism with a political edge. The album is intended in part as a retrospective protest against the British royal family’s historical endorsement of the East India Company’s role in the opium trade, while “Slave Till U Die No Matter What U Buy (L’anse Aux Meadows Mix)” is a glistening ambient remake of Jello Biafra’s blistering spoken-word piece “Message From Our Sponsor.” On paper, this sounds ludicrous: politics meeting cheese on a reggae-influenced ambient-house album that dredges up the last 30 years of electronic music. But the Orb’s particular skill—much like the KLF before them—lies in stirring these ingredients into sweetly melodic stews that go down like honey, their silliness a feature rather than a bug. It’s not so much that no one else could make this ridiculous album, more that no one but the Orb would even think of it. Abolition of the Royal Familia is a testament to their sadly singular talent.","Alex Paterson and his band of merry pranksters pay tribute to the golden age of ambient house with subtlety, occasional silliness, and a slyly subversive edge.

Aporia,Sufjan StevensLowell Brams,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e79271bb4ebe100082623b2/1:1/w_160/Aporia_Sufjan%20Stevens%20&%20Lowell%20Brams.jpg,2020-03-30 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sufjan-stevens-lowell-brams-aporia/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Is there a class of family member more roundly despised than the stepparent? “Parents are Hallmark-sacrosanct,” wrote Maggie Nelson in The Argonauts, yet stepparents are seen as “interlopers, self-servers, poachers, pollutants, and child molesters.” Many a fairy tale hinges on the machinations of a wicked stepmother. A long-running horror franchise is called simply The Stepfather, title in red on the posters, oozing blood. To be a stepparent is a thankless task freighted with centuries of cultural baggage; it takes a special sort of person. To hear Sufjan Stevens tell it, Lowell Brams—his stepfather, immortalized in 2015’s Carrie & Lowell—is just such a person. As a very young child, Stevens spent summers in the Oregon home his mother, Carrie, shared with Brams, who proved a steady, soothing presence in a childhood of unremitting tumult. Years later, grieving the loss of his mother, Stevens recalled those summers as a “season of hope.” Brams recognized Stevens’ nascent talent, and he fed it—gave the boy mixtapes, introduced him to Bob Dylan, bought him his first keyboard and 4-track recorder. In 1999, when Stevens recorded his first album, Brams founded a record label to put it out. Now, with Brams retiring from the label, he and Stevens release Aporia, a synth-wave epic testifying to the love they’ve shared. Culled from jam sessions recorded over the past decade, this is a looser record than we’re used to from Stevens. These songs have an improvisatory feel that has been refined and polished, though not to a digital shine. The mood throughout is warm and familiar, like something from a half-remembered childhood Sunday morning, blocky gray video-game remote in hand. He credits Brams, with his “great ear and great instincts,” for capturing choice moments from their raw collaboration, like the warm wind that closes “The Red Desert” or the solemn strings that dart across “Determined Outcome.” Brams, for his part, has been bashful in promoting the record, saying, “It’s unusual to have someone with little or no talent collaborating with someone who’s got truckloads like Sufjan.” Stevens, though, has always cut a unique figure as a rock star, prioritizing his privacy and his personal relationships while pursuing offbeat, unshowy opportunities. He never capitalized on his moment of Oscars glory; he continues, instead, to make meaningful music with the people who’ve loved him longest. Though Aporia’s air is one of freewheeling collaboration, with many an old friend making an appearance—check those swooping Cat Martino vocal lines on “What It Takes” and “Conciliation”—there is a careful architecture to the record, a structure not unlike that of a science fiction soundtrack. The calm yoga-retreat swell of opening track “Ousia” builds quickly to a palpable sense of quest, in the electronic pulse of “Afterworld Alliance,” and danger, rippling high and insecure beneath the foreboding bass synth of “Conciliation.” The closest analogue would be a John Carpenter score, or perhaps one of the sprawling, crowd-sourced Homestuck soundtracks. Brams and Stevens were smart to seek out a unifying thread in the instruments of Dave Smith, the pioneering synthesizer designer. Smith’s Tempest drums and Prophet synths lend a warm, analog consistency to songs with an otherwise diverse palette—fairy-tale lightness in “Glorious You,” saw-toothed grit in “Matronymic.” Though Stevens is famously versatile—he played nearly two dozen instruments on Illinois, including four types of recorder—he once aspired to become an author, even earning an MFA in fiction from the New School, and his storytelling remains among the most compelling aspects of his work. This is to say that there is a sense of something lost when he’s not writing lyrics; hardly a fair critique, I know, of an almost entirely instrumental record. The titles, at least, serve as guides for the listener to create a story of their own making. They call on Greek philosophy (“The Lydian Ring,” “Agathon”), unsung composers (“For Raymond Scott”), and SAT vocabulary (“Ataraxia,” “Misology,” “Palinodes”), planting flickering neon signs for listeners curious enough to venture down Wikipedia rabbit holes. When Stevens does sing two verses’ worth of real, human words, nearly half an hour in, on “The Runaround,” the effect is almost shocking, a sharp tug back to the realm of language. The past several years have been a time of great upheaval in Stevens’ life. He has weathered tremendous personal tragedy and undergone a very public recovery. He has ascended to a level of stardom both stratospheric (the Oscars, Coachella) and cultic (the young queer people who have gone out and tattooed wasps on their arms) while embracing spontaneity and close connection. There is something profoundly lovely about seeing Stevens safe in such a strange, adventurous effort, supported by Brams and the rest of his found family.","Eleven years after Music for Insomnia, Stevens and his stepfather reunite on a collection of warm, improvisatory synth-wave epics; intimate and unvarnished, they double as a testament to the power of found family.

Far Enough,Cable Ties,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7b8c9faa8b4200088741a5/1:1/w_160/cable.jpg,2020-03-30 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cable-ties-far-enough/,MergePoison City,"Jenny McKechnie doesn’t mince words. After her Melbourne punk trio Wet Lips found themselves billed on a gig as the token “girl act,” the band unleashed her frustration on the fiery “Can’t Take It Anymore”: “Do you think you’re an individual? You're just another guy in a Bad Seeds t-shirt...You’re so rock and roll,” Wet Lips singer Grace Kindellan sneered, pointed disses splattering like drops of lye. But after their shudderingly short and loud self-titled LP and a few 7""s, Wet Lips declared an indefinite hiatus. Cable Ties—their tacit successor formed by McKechnie, along with bassist Nick Brown and drummer Shauna Boyle—turns the same acerbic fury outward, transforming hyper-specific callouts of a toxic, male-dominated scene into broader, more explicit calls to action on their second full-length Far Enough. Melbourne has become known for a thriving female-oriented rock community, with bands like Camp Cope, Chelsea Bleach, and Amyl and the Sniffers showcasing the city’s rowdy pub scene abroad. But by many accounts, this was a hard-won and recent development, one paved largely by McKechnie herself. With Wet Lips, she started WetFest, a festival that ran until 2018 showcasing female and gender non-conforming-led punk groups. That DIY ethos, one that promotes channeling rage into creativity, defines the spirit of Far Enough. That’s not to suggest there’s a lack of fury. It’s endemic in their sound—the rumbling bass that cuts through Boyle’s crackling drums; the guitars blown up with reverb. Though invigorating, the instrumentation is hardly novel; the record often leans on familiar garage-rock tropes, so much so that it often dips into homogeneity and predictability. But the band also leaves plenty of room for McKechnie’s booming vocals, by far the band’s most impactful instrument. At once pliable and willful, her voice might morph from a biting howl to a striking vibrato in the span of a verse. Like X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene, she occasionally wields it like a weapon, barking about “blood and theft and war” on “Anger’s Not Enough.” That palpable intensity makes the moments where she does regain control of pitch and melody, as on the surprisingly sweet “Lani,” all the more striking, a delicate counterbalance to the band’s grittiness. But where the vocals lend a sense of ingenuity and innovation, Cable Ties’ lyrics too often fall flat. For a group so ingrained in Melbourne’s feminist punk scene, it is disappointing and even a bit confusing to see the group grasp at dated tropes when trying to stir underrepresented groups to action. “Self-Made Man,” the band’s attempt at an anti-capitalist anthem, is juvenile in its hackneyed critiques, with statements like “He don’t make when he creates/When he takes, he takes away” so broad that they are rendered ineffectual. At times, the band’s attempt at fomenting revolution is so anachronistic that it runs the risk of being regressive. On “Tell Them Where to Go,” what is ostensibly meant to be a searing battle cry for non-male musicians, McKechnie tries to trace an origin story of feminist punk but again settles for obvious platitudes. “Why don’t you walk out your bedroom and steal your brother’s guitar?” she screams, seemingly unaware of the binaries this reinforces. It comes off as tone-deaf, a facile and unsubtle gesture at third-wave feminism that feels immediately outmoded. The record’s strongest moments instead track more personal politics, the unavoidable contradictions and anxieties that build up simply from participating in a capitalist, patriarchal system. “Hope,” which begins with just a guitar and McKechnie’s voice, takes a more stream-of-consciousness approach: “I’m getting asthma as I run for the train/Is it genetic from my family or is it just harder to breathe these days?” These quiet musings, which connect literal family history to broader political sentiments, paint a more nuanced picture of leftism: fighting with family members over political parties, grappling with feelings of guilt for not fighting hard enough. It also leaves room for more positive emotions, as tentative as they might be. “It might be hopeless but if I lose hope I bring on that ending,” she sings, wearily but determined. The surprisingly jaunty closer “Pillow” is similarly autobiographical, a sort of “Cat’s Cradle” or “100 Years” for the Doomer generation, tracking her 25th and 26th birthdays through rising sea levels and rising conservatism. The addition of a pounding piano progression and layered vocal accompaniment on the last verse lends weight to her frustrations. There’s a novel terror in admitting that individual radicalism cannot change the world. But Cable Ties succeed when they build collective strength out of that fear. Correction: An earlier version of this article contained inaccurate information about the band’s origins and songwriting credits. It has since been updated.","The Australian punk trio, birthed out of Melbourne’s feminist punk scene, are at their best channeling their political rage into small moments

Hold Space For Me,Orion Sun,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7269e35138f7000805348c/1:1/w_160/Hold%20Space%20For%20Me_Orion%20Sun.jpg,2020-03-30 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/orion-sun-hold-space-for-me/,Mom + Pop,"Tiffany Majette wanted to be an astronaut; instead, she turned to music. As Orion Sun, she writes songs that hover and drift along, tenderly excavating past traumas and recent relationships. The 24-year-old singer and producer has orbited the Philadelphia R&B scene in recent years, opening performances by neo-soul crooner Daniel Caesar and eclectic rapper Tierra Whack. A 2017 mixtape, A Collection of Fleeting Moments and Daydreams, floated between outer-space imagery and drum-heavy introspection. On her debut album, Hold Space for Me, she unfurls her personal history, singing about learning to fall in love while grieving and about losing her childhood home. She describes her writing process as tapping into a kind of “darkness,” but there’s an airiness to her glistening jazz samples, quasi-trap beats, and tossed-off raps about Kanye. The sparse production relies on Orion Sun’s voice to carry the emotional weight of each track. She’s most successful when she’s stark, frank, and lightly poetic: “I pray to God, wherever he resides/If loving her’s alright,” she sings in a soft, undulating voice on “Trying,” a glimmering ballad about a queer relationship. Her simplicity doesn’t always achieve its goal; after 10 repetitions of “it feels so good to know you,” you’re numbed to the romance of the words. The album wants to soothe, but its meandering vocals and slow, weary chords start to feel like a drain. So when Orion Sun suddenly bursts out with a rap, it’s a welcome change of pace. Her occasional verses are fun, though sort of corny: “I feel like A$AP Rocky, bitches on my jockey, all up in my face, hockey,” she raps on “El Camino.” On “Golden Hour,” she finds a staccato, sing-song flow, and while the lyrics are never as strong as her more straightforward ballads, the twinkling synth and shimmering production effects complement her delivery. Towards of the end of the song, she sighs, layered vocals reverberating as she revels in her new-found success. “They’re fucking with me now,” she murmurs, genuinely shocked. At times the album feels ill-equipped to handle the capital-E Emotions, performing metaphors so theatrical they invoke cliche. “Grim Reaper,” a song about a friend’s death (“Where do you go/When your soul leaves the physical?”), fades into the chirp of a disconnected phone line; the song ends with a fuzzy, shoveling sound, like someone scraping through dirt. At other points, she turns to underwhelmed interjections, like the “Oh shit” and “What the fuck’s going on?” of the opener. Each song builds a small space for raw emotions, splaying out their intimacies and contradictions. But once the feelings pass, they default to easy takeaways—love is cozy, death is sad, time is fleeting—and palatable chords. On the album’s best track, “Coffee for Dinner,” Orion Sun interpolates The Weeknd, lilting a G-rated take on the Canadian superstar’s clammy sex chronicle “Often.” With vivid imagery and yearning vocals, she carves a space for herself out of the up-ended song, responding to the hedonism of the original with a gentleness that anchors the record. Her songs search for a smoothness that feels like safety, always taking a breath before unfolding.","The Philadelphia R&B singer’s stark, lightly poetic songs splay out the intimacies and contradictions of her raw emotions.

Allegiance and Conviction,Windy & Carl,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7a706fd565cf00087e7e94/1:1/w_160/a0859851360_10.jpg,2020-03-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/windy-and-carl-allegiance-and-conviction/,Kranky,"Ambient and shoegaze musicians often like to cloak themselves in mystery, but Windy Weber and Carl Hultgren, who’ve been toiling at the seam between those genres for nearly three decades, are oracles of the ordinary. There’s no stylized anonymity, no attempt to persuade us that their drones are about the astronomical treatises of Johannes Kepler or whatever. They’re a married couple that runs a shop called Stormy Records in a suburb of Detroit, and while their music sounds enigmatic, it’s presented as a chronicle of domestic life at its most murky and poignant and, sometimes, quotidian: Blues for a UFO was framed by a text that might have been mistaken for a neighborhood-listserv rant. Refusing to put on esoteric airs, Windy & Carl reveal the complex, ambiguous timbre of even the plainest lives. They aren’t a duo you look to for startling turns. Their dozens of releases since 1993 consist of minutely varied, grayscale watercolor studies of rain on windows, as their current press photo, so on the nose it has to be 15 percent joking, illustrates. But their new record, Allegiance and Conviction, stands out in two ways. The first is that the nine-minute “Moth to Flame” is the exception, not the rule; the other songs are almost half that length, each getting to the point and moving on more briskly than usual. The second is that the majority of them feature Weber’s vocals, which are usually more elusive. It’s as close as Windy & Carl have come to making a pop record (don’t worry, it’s not that close), and it’s an ideal entry point into a sprawling catalog. Rather than relying on standard songwriting arrangements, Windy & Carl expertly draw out layer after layer from hulking yet delicate walls of quivering pitches and soft-edged shapes. Weber plays bass and sings; Hultgren uses delays, reverbs, and an EBow to multiply one electric guitar into an ambient orchestra, which he’s been doing since before it was a cliché. (He arguably helped invent that tactic, alongside contemporaries like Stars of the Lid.) The duo’s music has traces of 1980s dream pop and 1990s slowcore, particularly Low, another married-couple band. There’s more to the comparison than ink on a certificate. Marriage’s suffering and devotion breed a particular kind of intimacy. Windy & Carl often resemble an ambient version of Yo La Tengo, another group that centers on a long-wed duo and conveys a secret, profound sense of life beyond the music. The record starts with “The Stranger,” with Weber’s vocals unusually high and exposed in the mix. She affects an almost tuneless Nico style, and your response might change from “This is bad singing” to “This is interesting singing” to “I could listen to this singing forever” in the space of a few lines. The bass is like a growl coming out of a cave, and Weber’s voice is a trail to follow as Hultgren sends shimmering timbres and echoing tones vaulting above. “I’m in plain view/Out looking for you/In the underground/We’ve got a job to do,” Weber sings. She might be talking about her uncharacteristically unveiled performance, her band’s cult-favorite status, or both, but it makes for a sharper, more sinister song than we’ve heard from these peddlers of pure atmosphere in ages. From there, Weber’s voice sinks down, an unintelligible haunting, or a sound among sounds. But “The Stranger” incites a pressure that lasts through the giant, gentle pieces to follow. On the ravishing “Recon,” Hultgren patiently draws out a gently crying lead from sliding basses and slowly swirling plucks. “Alone” varies the graceful register with some tension, a tinge of desperation creeping into Weber’s voice amid the minor-key smears and anxious guitars. “Crossing Over” is the only time we hear anything resembling riffs, but even the supremely static “Moth to Flame” flickers with interior sparks. Though it’s as comforting as the whistle of a teapot, the music captures the feeling of storms—the atmospheric charge and churning motion—without resorting to volume or force. Being ordinary seldom seemed so wonderfully strange.","Turning their atmospheric soft focus on everyday life, this is as close as the Detroit dream-pop duo has come to making a pop record; it’s an ideal entry point into their sprawling catalog.

Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,Ol’ Dirty Bastard,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7cda1725a55d0008c62a1a/1:1/w_160/36%20Chambers_ODB.jpg,2020-03-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ol-dirty-bastard-return-to-the-36-chambers-the-dirty-version/,ElektraRhino,"Ol’ Dirty Bastard was meant for the stage. In 1993, he was the only fiend audacious enough to sideline Biggie at his own birthday show, taking over the set and turning one of the greatest rappers ever into a hype man. In 1998, he interrupted Shawn Colvin’s Grammy acceptance speech to protest Puff Daddy’s win for Best Rap Album before a national audience of 25 million people. In 2000, he escaped from a rehab facility in Los Angeles, went on the lam for a month, and popped up as a fugitive to perform at a Wu-Tang Clan release party in New York City. “I can’t stay on stage too long tonight, the cops is after me,” he told the elated and astounded crowd at Hammerstein Ballroom, after performing “Shame On a Nigga.” For Ol’ Dirty Bastard, the line between mania and lucidity was always razor-thin, a slapstick high-wire act that was as exhilarating as it was dangerous. ODB’s debut album, Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, is a masterclass in winging it. The spontaneity of his live stunts extended to his raps: You never knew what he was going to do or say next, and maybe he didn’t either. In The Wu-Tang Manual, RZA, the Wu’s producer, chief creative mastermind, and self-appointed abbot, dubbed him a “freelance rhyme terrorist.” Two forces are at war with each other on Return to the 36 Chambers: RZA’s diligence and ODB’s inconsistency. It’s an oxymoron, a work of orchestrated negligence, a makeshift classic. But beyond its place in the ODB mythology or in Wu-Tang lore, The Dirty Version is above all a brash indictment of American classism and respectability politics. Unapologetic and raw, he turned to Uncle Sam and hollered, this is the savage you created, and did it with a Cheshire grin. Wu-Tang’s 1993 debut Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was like a rift in the space-time continuum. Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe, RZA designed an epic franchise with a cast of outsized characters crossing over from one project to the next, and a rich cross-cultural history: Five-Percenter raps from cross-town New Yorkers drawing from ’70s and ’80s martial arts cinema, which itself drew on the mythology of ancient dynasties. (The Wu universe would come to include a comic series, an origin story TV show, and a one-of-a-kind million-dollar rap artifact purchased by the world’s most loathed pharmaceutical executive.) The Dirty Version kicked off a world-conquering year for the Wu, which included two other solo classics: Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx and GZA’s Liquid Swords. In 1995, the Wu-Tang Clan were forging their legend, and ODB was the crew’s madcap mascot. Wu-Tang’s world of Wuxia iconography, lifted from overdubbed kung fu flicks, was the result of an obsession RZA and ODB nourished with regular trips to watch triple features on 42nd Street. ODB took his name from the 1979 film Ol’ Dirty Kung Fu, which was given the title Ol’ Dirty & the Bastard in U.S. syndication. At the center of the plot is a drunken eccentric whose aberrant behavior never compromises his mastery of martial arts, and even seems inherent to his form. ODB was drawn to the character and others like him, often taking the moniker the Drunken Master, after the 1978 Jackie Chan movie that spawned the archetype. Method Man once proclaimed that there was no father to ODB’s style: Without musical precedents, he leaned into aberration, just like his namesake. RZA’s plan to divide and conquer the rap world began before Wu-Tang’s studio debut was even released. They’d amassed a buzz around town, the self-released single “Protect Ya Neck” brought suitors, and the most valuable Wu assets were divvied up quickly: Meth signed to Def Jam, ODB to Elektra, Raekwon to Loud, GZA to Geffen, and Ghostface to Epic. After Enter the Wu-Tang was released, ODB was supposed to be the first soloist, but he couldn’t finish his album. He spent a chunk of the money from his advance on a jalopy in North Carolina and would go AWOL for long stretches of time, taking impromptu drives and writing on the road. He would bail out of songs mid-recording, vanish for days at a time, and then pop up drunk, destructive, and unpredictable. He once took an LL Cool J plaque off the wall at Chung King Studios and pissed on it, ending up in a standoff with LL’s manager Chris Lighty. The album took nearly two years to make because of this fitful approach. ODB was surrounded by a small team doing its damndest to keep him recording, but he could not be collected and he would not be rushed. He couldn’t have been further from Method Man’s 1994 debut Tical, an undeniably solid album from the crew’s most consistent rapper, which broke the seal on individual Wu-Tang releases thanks to ODB’s delay. RZA’s grand design spelled out the differences between Meth and Dirty: Meth would sign to Def Jam because he had crossover appeal; at Elektra, ODB would join fellow iconoclasts like KMD and Busta Rhymes. Tical, which went platinum in less than a year and spawned a Grammy-winning Hot 100 hit, was the perfect springboard for an ODB belly flop. Years before linking with Pras and Mya, Dirty became the ghetto superstar. On The Dirty Version, he subscribed to the age-old Rakim proverb that MC meant “move the crowd”; star-power meant garnering fans, and garnering fans meant rallying people. He wanted to luxuriate in the rap-star lifestyle, to conjure the euphoria of karaoke. His verses were as irresistible as they were startling. It isn’t a coincidence “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” has been sampled and interpolated 92 times, and as recently as this year. It is fun to mimic. Method Man joked that the album’s repeated verses were the result of ODB’s absentmindedness during a long recording process, but, intentionally or not, that repetition turned his verses into hooks. “Brooklyn Zoo II (Tiger Crane)” has verse fragments from three other songs on the album, like a reprise in a musical. His raps wormed their way into the brain in unusual ways, the product of his unusual methods. Those methods required several measures to wring an entire album out of Dirty. RZA was the hands-off architect. Buddha Monk was the handler, body man, and engineer, tasked with getting ODB prepped and into the studio, and making sure his vocals sounded right. Mastering engineer Tom Coyne was dubbed “the referee” in the liner notes for breaking up fights. Elektra A&R Dante Ross had the demanding task of shepherding the album to completion amid chaos. “I knew I had to get it to the finish line because there are times in life when you know you only have that moment in time, and you gotta get there,” Ross said of the Dirty Version sessions. “I had to get there, ’cause I strongly suspected that would not happen again.” ODB’s volatility created only a small window for capturing his output. He was anti-prolific, so inefficient in his recording style that it made The Dirty Version even more of a marvel—not just catching lightning in a bottle but harnessing its electricity to power a generator. It’s impossible to overstate how much his jolting vocals jump out and strike you. On “Don’t U Know,” he lurches along, his singing barely adhering to melody and meter. On “Hippa to da Hoppa,” he punctuates every bar with a grunt, then becomes conversational, then does some straight-up showerhead crooning. Across chest-thumpers like “Brooklyn Zoo” and “Cuttin’ Headz,” he becomes a caricature, a monster of pure id born of New York City’s sordid underbelly. Whether deliberately performative or not, Dirty’s persona embraced what the rest of the world saw as undesirable. Chris Rock, in his 1999 HBO special Bigger and Blacker, used ODB to characterize the politicized distance between “black” and “nigger,” a distinction between the respectable and the disreputable, as noted by the writer and African-American studies professor Richard Iton. To Rock, as to many, ODB was a depiction of a kind of blackness that was obscene: ignorant, dependant, deviant, unkempt, unruly, and, worst of all, uncontrollable. He was a character that has persisted in the cultural lexicon decades later: the crazy black homeless man as personified in novels like Same Kind of Different as Me or the shabby, mentally ill virtuoso of films like The Soloist. Only ODB didn’t seek redemption. He was proud. ODB made the low life into the hallmark of his celebrity appeal. In the “Intro,” he crowns himself the greatest performer since James Brown before digressing into a story about how he got burned by gonorrhea twice. On “Brooklyn Zoo,” he raps that he was “In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines,” referencing a local Brooklyn psychiatric ward. He often rapped as if on hallucinogens. “Drunk Game (Sweet Sugar Pie)” has a sort of degenerate charm, a singsong diatribe that’s the closest this pick-up artist comes to a ballad. It wasn’t that he couldn’t sing, it was if the concept of singing was entirely alien. On “Baby C’mon,” amid ravings about Wu (and personal) supremacy, he blurts out, “When it come to the money, yo it ain’t funny/It’s what you gotta do, what you got to do.” He was never embarrassed by being poor, but ODB was very clear about wanting to get paid. Those two truths were at the core of his biggest scandal: In 1995, as promotion for the album, an MTV crew filmed ODB taking his family to cash a $375 welfare check in a limo. The image of a rap star claiming food stamps reeked of abuse of power to the public: To middle-class black Americans, he was taking food out of someone else’s mouth; to white America, he was proof of a community looking for handouts. In a sense, it was profiteering. But more so, it was a display of government incompetence. How could a member of rap’s biggest group, who’d pocketed $45,000 as an advance, get away with this? It wasn’t so much pulling a fast one as it was highlighting a design flaw. In retrospect, it played like a comedy bit, something Eric Andre might pull. ODB had already warned them on “Raw Hide.” He was the product of a broken system, and if he saw any opportunity to make that system’s failures work for him, he would take it. On “Snakes,” he ups the ante: “Fuck my name, who I be?/Fuck the game, it’s all about the moneyyyy!” It is obvious to anyone paying attention: ODB felt America owed him, and he planned to recoup by any means necessary. He saw slavery as time served and wanted back pay. “Why wouldn’t you want to get free money?” he told the MTV camera crew. “You owe me 40 acres and a mule anyway.” (ODB was about wealth redistribution, too: he gave his money away in the streets.) There aren’t many job prospects for a lecherous, cock-eyed knucklehead in body armor, and so he was going to take every opportunity available to him to cash in. He’d achieved implausible fame. He was high enough to stun an elephant. He felt indestructible. The no-fucks-given debauchery of the Ol’ Dirty Bastard persona, which Ta-Nehisi Coates once dubbed “misanthropic lunacy,” made him an easy punching bag. But ODB wasn’t just in on the joke. He was delivering the punchline. His songs wholeheartedly played into the characterization. It was in the foul way he described his own talent in them: “funky like a stink bomb,” “old like toe fungus mold,” “style is evil like a wicked witch”; in the banter on “Don’t U Know,” where two women argue whether he’s bummy or charming; in his choice to make his welfare card his album cover, and in the mockery of his very name. “See this ain’t somethin’ new that’s just gonna come out of nowhere,” he says on “Raw Hide.” “No! This is somethin’ old! And dirtayyy!” He was revolutionary in his embrace of all things broken-down and deteriorating. His music assembled the secondhand (interpolated lines from Jim Croce, salvaged battle raps), the second-rate (a straining singing voice), and the shoddy (ramble raps recorded with antiquated technology) into a freak’s manifesto on escaping squalor but staying funky. Being poor is often met with shame. Being crazy is often met with fear. ODB was defiantly unable to feel shame or fear, and so this poor, crazy bastard rebuked public disgust the only way he knew how: By doubling down on everything the civilized world hated about him. His songs harnessed the inexhaustible power of his fuckery. He stumbles around in them, on cuts like “Baby C’mon” and “Raw Hide,” as much ranting and he is rapping. Hearing ODB spit rhymes was like watching a delirious man wander into a busy intersection and, through sheer luck or divine intervention, avoid getting hit by oncoming traffic. With each daring escape, each narrow staving of catastrophe, it becomes harder and harder to dismiss his nimble maneuvers as chance. Before RZA, GZA, and ODB were in the Wu-Tang Clan, the cousins were in a trio called Force of the Imperial Master (later All in Together Now), and would travel around New York trading material and facing off with other rappers. ODB spent enough time going toe-to-toe with guys around town for respect to understand what would galvanize an audience. The rapper with the bigger energy, the more immediate and resounding material, and the more confrontational demeanor could command the corner, or the crowd, or the colosseum. He fought dirty. Every single verse on his debut activates the muscle memory of that sparring, as he rediscovers old battle-tested chemistry while shadowboxing with his earliest partners. ODB and GZA basically finish each other’s sentences on “Damage,” playing hard into the dichotomy of the genius and the fool. The closer, “Cuttin’ Headz,” is call-and-response melee, with RZA seemingly channeling Dirty: “Once I go berzerk, mad brothers got hurt.” It’s a great song to go out on—casual play fighting and banter between family—but RZA was far from done flexing. His beats have long been hailed for their texture and impact—gritty, murky, and audacious—and they are all of those things. But they are also carefully arrayed and suited to their performers, especially in the early days, and specifically on The Dirty Version. The production plays up the hostility and comedy of ODB’s performances. “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” and “Brooklyn Zoo” are among RZA’s best creations, and perfect for Dirty; alongside the slightly blemished but tightly wound loops, he seems emboldened to splatter them further, like a prankster graffiting the walls. It has become commonplace in modern hip-hop to declare someone a “weirdo rapper,” and Ol’ Dirty Bastard is the weirdo rap exemplar. He was more unbalanced than Danny Brown, as unrestrainable as Young Thug, and as antagonistic as JPEGMAFIA. In a thought experiment in 2018, writer Julian Kimble imagined how ODB would emerge as a contemporary star. But such a framework ignores his unique place in hip-hop lineage. It’s like removing a domino from the middle of a lineup and expecting the rest to still fall accordingly. The Dirty Version set the stage for all the weirdos that followed. With considerable help, ODB turned his weirdness into a kind of sorcery and conjured rap’s unlikeliest satire.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit ODB’s 1995 debut, a work of orchestrated negligence and a makeshift classic.

Gigaton,Pearl Jam,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7a54162a26d50009079258/1:1/w_160/gigaton.jpg,2020-03-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pearl-jam-gigaton/,MonkeywrenchRepublic,"Before they had anything—a legion of devoted fans, walls of platinum records, a destination festival—Pearl Jam had a community. In the Seattle grunge scene of the early ’90s, they emerged as part of a larger mosaic, members of a supergroup before their debut even came out. This support from contemporaries is likely what empowered Pearl Jam to find their voice, writing earnest, soaring rock songs inspired by punk but delivered as arena anthems in jam band-style marathon live sets. Now that they are an industry all to themselves, their origin story might seem like a footnote—especially in 2020, when they remain the last band intact from their particular scene. But this sense of uplift still defines their work. Communal goodwill is the saving grace of Gigaton, their eleventh studio album and first in nearly seven years. At 57 minutes, it’s their longest album, as well as the one that took the longest to complete. You feel the weight of both durations throughout. The ballads stretch out slowly, and the uptempo numbers are derailed by meandering build-ups, like stopping for a chat while running in place mid-jog. From the curveball disco-rock of first single “Dance of the Clairvoyants”—a portal into an alternate universe where David Byrne produced the Who to soundtrack an ’80s action film—the band immediately forecasted an attempt to revitalize its sound. In context, it’s more of an outlier: a reminder of their underdog mentality, that they have some fight left in them. From the sounds of it, Pearl Jam pieced Gigaton together from various sessions over several years, with Vedder adding vocals to the choice bits after the fact. It’s hard to imagine this process leading toward a unified statement from any band, let alone one that’s already been having trouble finding inspiration. After records like 2009’s Backspacer and 2013’s Lightning Bolt combatted their dearth of ideas with low-stakes thrashiness—a throwback to the rowdy garage band that they never actually were—Gigaton attempts to reinstate their ambition. Co-produced by the band and Josh Evans, it’s filled with all the markers of cerebral, studio-born rock music: drum loops and programmed synths, swirling keys and fretless bass, wide dynamics and spacey textures. For the first time in a while, the winning moments are the slower cuts: songs like “Retrograde” and “Seven O’Clock” that evolve patiently into their atmosphere, as opposed to pro-forma ragers like “Never Destination” that never quite find their groove. To unify this sprawling material, Vedder offers wordy, zoomed-out lyrics that directly address Trump, the climate crisis, and a growing sense of apocalyptic unease. And if his lyrics occasionally come out jumbled (“They giveth and they taketh/And you fight to keep that what you’ve earned”) or totally miss the mark (a reference to the title character of Sean Penn’s novel), his performance is as keyed-in and comforting as ever. For all the record’s studio experimentation, the moments that cut through are the subtle choices he makes as a vocalist: his anxious speak-sing in “Seven O’Clock,” the way he mimics the wordless refrain of the eerie “Buckle Up,” the seething cry of the chorus in “Quick Escape.” With songs contributed by each band member, Gigaton is an undeniably democratic statement, but Vedder remains their guiding light—the voice that allowed this particular band to outlast an entire generation of imitators. The artistic rejuvenation that Gigaton aims to provide still seems somewhat out of reach. In that sense, it reminds me of U2’s No Line on the Horizon—another late-career attempt at experimentation after a series of back-to-basic statements. Both records indulge an influential band’s artsier side in mostly superficial ways—longer songs, pasted-in ambience, grand attempts at state-of-the-union philosophizing—while backing away from the actual subversion that made them exciting in the first place. Like U2, Pearl Jam have been able to sustain their legacy even without vital new studio work. But unlike U2, Pearl Jam seem content to deliver their messages to the already converted, with no interest in the mainstream attention that once came naturally. Their self-awareness both grounds this music and confines its ambition. For a long time, Pearl Jam had an uncommon strength for asserting their individuality while pleasing the masses, looking to the future while staying true to their own history. On Gigaton, they admit they don’t know what happens next. Their message hits hardest in the closing tracks: the singalong strummer “Retrograde” and the fragile pump organ ballad “River Cross.” Both tracks forecast darker skies with calm, reassuring music. In the final moments of the record, Vedder offers a mantra: “Can’t hold me down.” As the music swells and his voice rises to the occasion, he switches from “me” to “us”—a last attempt to gather the community, to band together before the coming storm.","Eleven albums in, a band that has become an industry unto itself attempts an artistic rejuvenation that still seems out of reach.

We Are Sent Here by History,Shabaka and the Ancestors,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7284725138f70008053491/1:1/w_160/History_Shabaka%20Ancestors.jpg,2020-03-28 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shabaka-and-the-ancestors-we-are-sent-here-by-history/,Impulse!,"In West Africa, histories have been passed down through generations by griots, storytellers who collect the wisdom of the past in order to help shape our fates. Even after the advent of the written word, such storytellers were the safest manner of recording knowledge—scrolls could be lost, and libraries could burn, but oral histories were shared by the collective consciousness, written in our genes, able to survive individual tragedies to persist through time. In that sense, griots are more than just historians—they’re the library. We Are Sent Here by History, the second album from Shabaka Hutchings and the Ancestors, is a record steeped in that tradition, a living history looking backward in time from a not-too-distant future. Coincidentally released amid the proliferation of a global pandemic, it takes on new meanings: a collective record of the apocalypse, a sonic time capsule left to be found buried in the sand by some future explorer. The group’s first LP, Wisdom of the Elders, served as a warning of things to come, but this tale reads as a statement of fact, a record of the wrongs and missteps that led to our own demise. The Ancestors are just one of several projects helmed by Hutchings, arguably the brightest star of London’s surging jazz scene. This group, which mostly hails from South Africa, is a space-age jazz sextet that connects the dots between the various corners of the African diaspora. There’s evidence of Hutchings’ Afro-Caribbean heritage in his sax’s soca stylings (“They Who Must Die”), and Ariel Zamonsky’s double bass—the record’s backbone—claims ancestry from Hugh Masekela’s South African township jazz. The phrasing of the reeds, from Mthunzi Mvubu’s alto sax to Hutchings’ tenor and clarinet, often resembles a tag-team rap duo, with bars intertwined like twisted rope. The performances are virtuosic but sometimes primal, like the horns’ bestial screams on “The Beasts Too Spoke of Suffering” that extend the album’s scope beyond humankind. But the record is at its most compelling when it explores our humanity, whether examining the roots of misogyny (“We Will Work (On Redefining Manhood)”) or making space for plaintive introspection (“Teach Me How to Be Vulnerable”). At its heart lies the poetry of South African performance artist Siyabonga Mthembu; the song titles and concept are rooted in his words, which are sung in Zulu, Xhosa, and English. The lyrics are delivered calmly amid a storm of righteous rage, a calm narration to the immolation of Rome. “You’ve Been Called” opens with an extended verse from Mthembu: “We are sent here by history/The lighter gave fire, and was present at the burning/The burning of the republic/Burnt the names, burnt the records, burnt the archive, burnt the bills, burnt the mortgage, burnt the student loans, burnt the life insurance/An act of destruction became creation.” It’s less a metaphor than a recipe for a strong foundation, with the understanding that to build something new you must first excise what is rotten. We Are Sent Here by History is Hutchings’ third release for the Impulse! label, following Sons of Kemet’s Your Queen Is a Reptile and The Comet Is Coming’s Trust In The Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery. The label was responsible for putting out some of Hutchings’ formative influences in the 1960s and 1970s, including John Coltrane, Archie Shepp, and Pharoah Sanders. But this record lies in direct opposition to Sanders’ optimism. The Ancestors are no longer attempting to advise us on how to avoid the apocalypse; instead they ask, now that it has arrived, what will we do next? As the world reels from the repercussions of the novel coronavirus, We Are Sent Here by History might feel particularly timely, particularly for those in the West typically shielded from the brunt of capitalism and the brutality of colonialism. But the album, recorded in Johannesburg and Cape Town in 2019, is not so much prescient as it is broadly in tune with the plight of the marginalized. As Hutchings has said, “For those lives lost and cultures dismantled by centuries of western expansionism, capitalist thought and white supremist structural hegemony the end days have long been heralded as present with this world experienced as an embodiment of a living purgatory.” Despite its ominous tone, We Are Sent Here by History is only partially fatalist; even if it accepts the apocalypse as inevitable, it offers a path away from a “tragic defeat.” It’s a reminder that any redemption must first reconcile the lessons of our history, to learn from the mistakes that led to misfortune. It’s also a testament to the beauty of resilience; as an indictment of power, it elicits inspiration rather than depression. This is music that makes you feel less alone in your rage, a chorus to join with your anger and frustration, a funnel to channel that energy. Because as with any future, Hutchings’ foreordained outcome is merely one possible—if likely—fate. If our genes are a record of where we’ve been, then We Are Sent Here by History asks where we want to go. Because even viruses leave records in our genes; Hutchings and the Ancestors make the case that the future will be defined by what we do with them.","The British-Barbadian jazz saxophonist and his South African players narrate the apocalypse from a distant future, suggesting that in order to build anew, some things will first need to burn.

City on My Back,Rio Da Yung OG,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7a560a25a55d0008c629f9/1:1/w_160/cityontheback.jpg,2020-03-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rio-da-yung-og-city-on-my-back/,#Boyz Entertainment LLC,"Rio Da Yung OG raps like a teacher who has gathered all their students on the rug for storytime. It just so happens that the Flint, Michigan-based 25-year-old’s tales all concern drug dealing, drug addiction, and paranoia. He raps over anxious, piano-driven production similar to Detroit hip-hop, chronicling his past with reflective anecdotes that may or may not be lies: the time when his uncle took away his football as a kid and told him to sell drugs instead; when he ran into the guy who stole his bike back in elementary school, so he shot him in the leg; when his uncle was sentenced to life in jail, but received clemency from Barack Obama. Last year, Rio Da Yung OG’s hectic punchline-based rap found the ears of longtime Detroit staple Peezy. Before Peezy left to serve a jail sentence, he took Rio under his wing. Rio switched his focus from running around the streets of Flint to music, but he had legal troubles of his own, and soon, drug charges landed him on house arrest. The isolation turned into a blessing, allowing him to flood the internet with his chaotic and line-crossing take on the Detroit sound for the second half of 2019. His bedroom recordings were so colorful and brutal that the only reasonable response was to laugh at the absurdity: “Meet the plug, take everything while his son watching/Swear to God I ain’t stick that nigga up my gun robbed him,” he raps on “Legendary,” his biggest song to date. Filming his music videos on the same front lawn and rooms throughout his home, he became one of the premier street rappers in the Midwest in months. Rio keeps this momentum with City on My Back, 15 songs of straight shit-talking over funky beats that could have been made in any year since 2008. The appeal of Rio is simply in listening to him talk. Every line is detailed, as if pulled from a script: “Don’t say shit when I cook dope, I think the kitchen wired,” he says on the 50 Cent-sampling “Window Shopper.” He gives us a peek into his daily life on “Listen To Me”: “It’s nine in the morning I just woke up/Before I make an egg sandwich, I cook dope up.” His raps can go from dark comedy to bleak in one line: “Scared to close my eyes, I might die, I drunk a lot of syrup,” he says on “2020 Freestyle.” Even Rio’s missteps are never flatout failures. “City on My Back” is one of Rio’s first attempts at a hook, and it’s weak for sure, but his verse more than makes up for it: “Just a sold zip, he say it smell fresh that’s cause it really soap/Yeah, I’m a dirty person,” he cracks. Here are the instructions to “Dance Moves,” Rio’s attempt at crafting a viral dance challenge: “Look man, get on the ground, hump the floor, act like you fucking a bitch.” But Rio doesn’t need hooks or dance challenges. Listening to him rap on City on My Back is like being engrossed in an audiobook on a long drive. Whether he’s playing a dice game in Louis Vuitton, pouring a girl a cup of E&J and telling her that it’s Henneessy, or selling a customer fake pills, few can tell a story better than Rio.","After a year flooding the internet, this Michigan rapper collects 15 of his colorful and brutal raps, which split the difference between deadpan and dead serious.

Saint Cloud,Waxahatchee,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e726f3a5138f7000805348d/1:1/w_160/Saint%20Cloud_Waxahatchee.jpg,2020-03-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/waxahatchee-saint-cloud/,Merge,"With Katie Crutchfield’s fifth solo album comes the spring, its essence bottled so powerfully you could name a perfume after it: Saint Cloud, by Waxahatchee. Its sensory trigger has the power to replace the memory of whatever you call this atrophic season happening around us. Instead, Saint Cloud is all lilacs and creek beds, Memphis skylines and Manhattan subways, love and sobriety, the sound of a cherished songwriter thawing out under the sun. This transformative effect was absent on Crutchfield’s previous solo work. Don’t take that as a knock on her intimate, lo-fi 2012 debut American Weekend or 2013’s remarkable follow-up Cerulean Salt, whose songs of love and harm still land like a hundred little knicks to the flesh. Even as Crutchfield revved up the sound and the stakes on 2017’s searing Out in the Storm, finding darkness deep within her psyche, her songwriting remained bound up in grungy distortion, spare arrangements, and blocky rhythms. Three chords and the truth was always her credo, but Crutchfield needed more room for that credo to thrive. And so Crutchfield decided to build songs that she could stroll right into. Twirl, even. She resides inside a world that drapes over her like the sky-blue dress she wears on the album’s cover. If that sleeved dress and the old pickup truck didn’t clue you in, Saint Cloud is an album in the thrall of Americana and the country music of her childhood in Birmingham, Alabama: Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, George Jones. Produced with a warm and deft touch by Brad Cook (Bon Iver, Hiss Golden Messenger), the album never chugs or lurches into a rock groove. It’s made of simple blues patterns, nothing-fancy chords, and the steady backbeat of a band working only for the song. Every note rings and chimes: a light organ here, the slight twang of a Telecaster there, gently plucked leads on an acoustic back there, all perfectly appointed for Crutchfield’s songwriting. It feels like you’re in possession of a family heirloom. That ease comes in part because this is the first album Crutchfield wrote after getting sober in 2018. On the outstanding “Fire,” she sings that she’s “wiser, slower, and attuned,” words that also serve as the mood throughout Saint Cloud. Her lyrics wind around and corkscrew a bit more on this record than previous ones, but it’s a feat that Crutchfield pulls off with a daredevil command of verse. “Fire” rings of desperation and conquest, a promise to make oneself meek, small as a bird, even turn into liquid, just to live inside someone: “And when I turn back around/Will you drain me back out/Will you let me believe that I broke through?” Crutchfield told Rolling Stone that she had difficulty writing while sober, but these are some of the most careful and evocative lyrics she’s ever composed. There’s a subtle difference between writing that digs and writing that discovers. If her older records did the former—peeling back layers of innocence and isolation to get to the nerve-endings—Crutchfield is now a discoverer who sees the world anew. Much of Saint Cloud is wide-eyed and detailed; she sings as if amazed at what she feels. “The Eye” is all about being levitated in those dizzy moments of love. Crutchfield lets the lyrics tumble out of her in a litany, absolutely goofy that her partner will give her something “to think and sing and follow.” The song peaks as Crutchfield builds vocal harmonies that gather behind this image: “A scientific cryptogram lit up behind a jet stream,” and for just a second, as if to highlight the ear-to-ear grin behind the song, a bluegrass chorus of Crutchfields all pile into the words “lit up.” Because Saint Cloud is so fresh and budding on the outside, Crutchfield can hide her anger and fear inside it. This new contrast gives great dimension to her storytelling, allowing all the sourness and rot at the fringes of her songs to come and go at will. “War” takes on a rambling ’60s Dylan feel, that lets her talk about how she’s prone to “come in hot” and “fill up the room,” but she’s quick to add—as we all do in heated moments—that it has “nothing to do with you.” The trauma buried at the heart of “Arkadelphia” is so palpable that the slow-burn tempo makes it glow white. She sings softly, “If we make pleasant conversation/I hope you can’t see what’s burning in me.” Crutchfield is still the patron saint of emotional chaos, but her songs suggest that she’s becoming more of a protector, a homebody, looking to take everything out of storage and either throw it away or keep it safe in a home. The climax of the record, “Ruby Falls,” is where all of the ambition and aesthetics come together. As she walks down 7th Street in Manhattan, Crutchfield’s wisdom collects into buckets: “Real love don’t follow a straight line/It breaks your neck, it builds you a delicate shrine,” and, “You might mourn all that you wasted/That’s just part of the haul.” Her pen moves ornately across the page, the aperture of her songwriting flies open.

Future Nostalgia,Dua Lipa,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7bbf3cacea7700098b3843/1:1/w_160/Future%20Nostalgia_Dua%20Lipa.jpg,2020-03-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia/,Warner,"No 2017 pop release had legs like Dua Lipa’s self-titled debut. “New Rules,” the know-your-worth anthem that became her breakout, was actually the sixth single from an album delayed eight months past its original release date. While Dua Lipa’s long shelf life built the British and Kosovar Albanian singer’s fanbase, the trickle of new music she appeared on in the interim—a major hit with Calvin Harris’ “One Kiss,” the throwback house of Diplo and Mark Ronson’s “Electricity”—maintained her momentum. Three years later, the Dua Lipa release schedule looks very different: Her second record, Future Nostalgia, arrives a week early, ostensibly because of the coronavirus pandemic, though maybe because fans had already leaked it. Anchored by lead single “Don’t Start Now,” an instant staple of pop DJs and barre classes, Future Nostalgia is a collection of sophisticated, hard-bodied pop-funk that gradually gives way to slick, Kylie Minogue-inspired disco. Capitalizing on a love of ’80s pop and ’90s club culture, Lipa and a team of career producers (Stephen “Koz” Kozmeniuk, Ian Kirkpatrick, Stuart Price, Jeff Bhasker) tunnel deeper into retro-pop revival, a flashy dancefloor timewarp aimed at the type of pop fan who can’t hear Olivia Newton-John’s original 1981 hit “Physical” without imagining what it might sound like with the string sample from “Hung Up” chopped and layered on top. Future Nostalgia sounds like three Madonna eras at once, like Giorgio Moroder making blog house. Like all classic dance music, it’s more concerned with the thrill of new passion than with what happens after the sun rises. At 24, Lipa has been working towards this moment for almost 10 years, and her sights are set higher still. A false start in modeling impressed the importance of going where you’re wanted; in Lipa’s case, to Warner Records, who sought a female pop icon to compete with the Rihannas and Lady Gagas of the world. She leveraged her talent as a songwriter, developing an early Dua Lipa single, “Hotter Than Hell,” in the first session with her prospective management team. Her sly swagger and fashion-plate style gave her the presence of someone who’d achieved diva status already. “I’m a bit too far down the line for anyone to try and tell me something,” she said of her creative autonomy in 2017, even before the release of her first record. But where many of pop’s most recent stars are emphatically emotionally available, Lipa radiates blithe coolness. Her brand is style, competence, taste—this is, in a way perhaps not obvious to those who actually remember the ’80s, entirely tasteful pop music—and the sultry low voice that makes her the star of even a middling Martin Garrix collab. Future Nostalgia is nonstop, no ballads; for 10 tracks, the closest it comes to feeling vulnerable or revealing is “Pretty Please,” a plea for stress-relief sex with an ultra-thick bassline. When Lipa proclaims, “You got me losing all my cool/’Cause I’m burning up on you,” on the Tove Lo cowrite “Cool,” she rhymes it with, “In control of what I do.” It’s Lipa’s strongest stance: all-in on self-determination. The thrill of Future Nostalgia—the title itself a claim to modern classic status—is in hearing her tailor the retro-funk form to suit her commanding attitude. “No matter what you do, I’m gonna get it without ya/I know you ain’t used to a female alpha,” she proclaims on the title track. Which is why it’s a disappointment when the album’s confident strut falters, first with the “bad/mad/sad” rhymes on “Good in Bed” and finally with the awareness anthem “Boys Will Be Boys,” a funk-free flip of the sexist trope (“…but girls will be women”). Layered choral arrangements soften the ultra-literal writing, but as a closer, it brings the party to a screeching halt, with a serious tone that feels at odds with everything preceding it. What should be heartfelt and meaningful—a song to contrast Lipa’s aloofness and demonstrate her range—instead undermines what Future Nostalgia does best: proud, flawless bravado.","The ascendant singer’s star-making second album is a collection of sophisticated, hard-bodied pop-funk that gives way to slick, Kylie Minogue-inspired disco.

Colores,J Balvin,by: Jenzia Burgos,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e72665e5138f7000805348a/1:1/w_160/Colores_J%20Balvin.jpg,2020-03-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-balvin-colores/,Universal Music Latino,"J Balvin didn’t have to drop a concept album. He also didn’t have to include with it a series of “guided meditations,” or shoot a video for every song on the record. Already well into his global ascent, the Colombian juggernaut could have simply bundled Colores’ radio-ready hits and rode out the streaming wave. Yet Balvin has long outpaced that tactic, eschewing his earliest goals of mainstream reggaetón success for something greater. He recently told Vogue UK he wants to be a “living legend,” punto. So now, Balvin is in the business of crafting a lasting aesthetic—namaste hands and all. Colores’ concept is steeped in this earnest (if slightly indulgent) pursuit. Each of its 10 tracks corresponds to a different color, in a sort of sonic mood ring. “Rojo” deploys atmospheric synths to evoke romance; on “Gris,” a cumbia-derived guitar recalls the sound of Balvin’s Medellín atop a chunky beat. We even get an answer to fellow urbano upstart Bad Bunny’s “Safaera” with another nasty puro perreo cut (“Negro”). But through all of this, Balvin’s underlying mission remains clear. He telegraphed his commitment to his idea when he dropped the album’s final track, “Blanco,” as the lead single in late 2019, choosing it over surefire beach hit “Azul” or the rainbow of “Arcoíris” (featuring Oasis’ Afrobeats all-star, Mr. Eazi). In doing so, Balvin effectively slapped down a layer of primer, delivering an absence of color in preparation for the rest. Directed by frequent collaborator Colin Tilley (who oversaw every video for the album), the accompanying music video for “Blanco” signals the madness of a world gone blank. In it, we see Balvin clad in dystopic drip courtesy of Virgil Abloh’s Off-White brand, as the reggaetonero’s face quite literally drips in glossy alabaster paint. Beside him, bone breakers writhe in zero-gravity, cats go flying, and a polar bear gets X-ray visioned. The only thing left to hold onto is recurrent partner and producer Sky Rompiendo’s clomping bassline, as Balvin’s “ey” spreads into the sparse breaks between each beat. Given “Blanco’s” gaudiness, some likely chalked up the Colores concept as just Balvin’s latest playground. In some ways, it is: Album opener “Amarillo” (Yellow) teems with funhouse horns sampled from French hip-hop collective Saïan Supa Crew’s “Angela,” as Rompiendo pumps the sample into an addictingly—or, depending on your sensitivity, annoyingly—incessant loop. Overhead, Balvin croons, “¿Cómo te explico? No me complico (How can I explain? I don’t mess around)”/“A mí me gusta pasarla rico (I like to have a good time),” proving he’s still always up for a party. Yet it’s the minimalism of “Blanco”—both in its pared-down production and its spartan visuals—that makes its counterpart shine in equal measure. As an exercise in sequencing, these bookend tracks represent opposite poles of the Colores spectrum—Balvin’s playground, if it is that, has plenty of order. And that’s because Balvin has always organized his work along visual terms. His offbeat mix of influences has made way for neon dye jobs, Spongebob grills, and luminous tours like last year’s Arcoíris Tour (named for Colores’ penultimate track), where a leopard-haired Balvin centered himself in what can only be described as an army of kawaii Michelin Men and emoji-adjacent mascots, recalling the work of Japan’s matchless visual artist Takashi Murakami. Speaking of whom: Balvin’s latest cover art is credited to Murakami. It’s a big deal for Balvin, who had “dreams” of working with the artist for a better part of the last decade. In part for his shared whimsy, no doubt. But as it goes, a Murakami collaboration might as well be any nascent pop star’s christening. It puts Balvin in the same camp as fellow tastemakers Kanye and Pharrell, who have collaborated with Murakami to much renown. Now with his own seat at the table, J Balvin will no doubt sigue rompiendo.","Already a global star, reggaetón’s reigning hitmaker tries his hand at becoming an auteur with an audiovisual album.

Illusion of Time,Daniel AveryAlessandro Cortini,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7bc3ac0adecd0008700e1a/1:1/w_160/Illusion%20of%20Time_Daniel%20Avery%20and%20Alessandro%20Cortini.jpg,2020-03-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daniel-avery-alessandro-cortini-illusion-of-time/,MutePhantasy,"Apparently Song for Alpha wasn’t a fluke. Released in 2018, Daniel Avery’s second album sharply diverged from his rave-ready debut, Drone Logic, showcasing his more pensive, ambient side. At the time, it felt like a reaction, a document of Avery’s desire to linger in what quiet moments he could find in a life of endless touring and main-room DJ gigs. But Illusion of Time suggests that perhaps a more fundamental shift has taken place. On this album, Avery is working alongside Alessandro Cortini, an Italian synth guru who’s also a member of Nine Inch Nails. It’s not the first time the two have joined forces; in 2017, working remotely, they produced a limited-edition 7"" called Sun Draw Water. That record’s two songs both appear on Illusion of Time; the rest of the album was completed in 2018, when the two artists finally linked up in person while Avery was supporting Nine Inch Nails on tour. Avery may be the bigger name here, but the record has Cortini’s fingerprints all over it, especially when the album delves into the synth-gaze territory of his excellent Volume Massimo LP from last year. Although Illusion of Time lacks that album’s bright colors and wall-of-sound dimensions, there is a similar sense of synth-driven grandeur at work, albeit less polished and occasionally darker in tone. The menacing “Inside the Ruins” feels like something out of Ben Frost’s playbook, its glowering tones churning and crashing amid a thick soup of tape hiss and distorted ambience. Another epic is LP opener “Sun,” which unfurls towering waves of fuzz-laden drone while tapping into an almost devotional vibe; it sounds like something you’d hear at a yoga retreat scored by Stephen O’Malley. Despite Avery’s DJ pedigree, Illusion of Time has no real relationship with the club. There are no beats on the album, and though it’s not exactly ambient, the music does tend to drift and float along. Like Song for Alpha, it’s introspective, yet not nearly as insular. There isn’t a concrete narrative to speak of, but Avery and Cortini have clearly cast their gaze skyward; it’s a beautiful record that takes wonder as its defining characteristic. The crunchy “Enter Exit” feels like a luxuriously undulating sound bath, while “Water” offers an updated, albeit unvarnished take on shoegaze, with jagged melodies reminiscent of majestic post-rock outfits like Explosions in the Sky. More powerful still is “At First Sight,” a wide-angle track powered by the kind of guitar squall that would make the Jesus and Mary Chain proud; the song conjures the awe-struck sensation of  gazing down from the edge of a high cliff. That feeling of rapture also holds firm during the album’s quieter moments. “Space Channel” and “Interrupted by the Cloud of Light” are essentially interludes, but their dreamy atmospheres could have been crafted by the Cocteau Twins. The title track is one of the LP’s most low-key selections—and one of its obvious highlights—featuring a playful melody that sits somewhere between kosmische pioneers Neu! and Selected Ambient Works Volume II-era Aphex Twin. Illusion of Time may be doused in varying layers of crackle and distortion, but there’s no obscuring the tranquil elegance of “CC Pad” or the cinematic bloom of album closer “Stills."" Illusion of Time is a confidently relaxed listen: Created in a pressure-free situation by two artists with no road map and nothing in particular to prove, it is expansive in scope, charmingly rough around the edges, and brimming with possibility. Its hazy synth explorations may fit more naturally into Cortini’s catalog, but Avery’s role in Illusion of Time shouldn’t be overlooked; in the wake of Song for Alpha, he’s taken another step away from the confines of the dancefloor, and he’s done it without wobbling.","On their full-length debut together, the UK techno producer and the Italian synth guru conjure a mood of pulsing electronic grandeur.

3.15.20,Childish Gambino,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e79231f2a54c60008d8e38f/1:1/w_160/3.15.20_Childish%20Gambino.jpg,2020-03-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/childish-gambino-31520/,Wolf + RothsteinRCA,"About 40 minutes into his new album, Donald Glover asks a simple question: “Where are those subtle men?” At times, he’s totally unqualified to answer. The record’s first full song, which I swear is called “Algorhythm,” opens with an industrial groan, as Glover growls: “So very scary, so binary/Zero or one/Like or dislike, coal mine canary/I dream in color, not black and white.” It’s all very the regional manager just watched Blade Runner and wants to talk about it. But a few bars after that passage, “Algorhythm” opens up into its hook—bright, free, danceable in spite of itself. Like all of Childish Gambino’s music since 2013’s Because the Internet, 3.15.20 is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense. These songs, which were recorded over several years with the Inglewood producer DJ Dahi and Glover’s longtime collaborator, the Swedish composer Ludwig Goransson, move from pulsing four-on-the-floor exercises to Prince-lite. There are times (“32.22”) when he sounds like Travis Scott clearing his throat before breakfast, and others (the excellent “42.26,” previously released as “Feels Like Summer”) when Glover lulls you into a simmering hypnosis. So the album—titled after the date it was originally streamed online, most of its song titles mere timestamps—is not a clear retro pastiche like 2016’s “Awaken, My Love!”, which mined ’70s funk with occasionally dazzling results. But it’s not exactly tethered to the present, either. Dahi, unsurprisingly, says that some early versions of songs had a kind of “The Love Below energy”: “12.38,” which features a nearly four-minute documentation of a mushroom trip, is sort of a riff on André 3000’s “Vibrate.” 3.15.20 comes after a decade of unqualified success for Glover. The 36-year-old, who grew up a Jehovah’s Witness just outside of Atlanta and began writing for Tina Fey’s 30 Rock just as he was graduating from NYU, starred in another NBC sitcom, Community, before creating one of the decade’s most original screen projects in Atlanta. He released more music to increasing critical acclaim (or at least diminishing disdain). And contrary to internet rumor, he did not become the next Spider-Man, but he was cast in the Lion King remake and a Star Wars spinoff. He made the leap from sitcoms and mixtapes to superstardom, all while seeming to reject what superstardom requires. Yet it always feels as if Glover is in the middle of a game of tonal Russian roulette. He began the decade making clumsy post-Graduation rap, defensive and full of treacly confession. As time went on he became more withholding, on record and in public performance. He announced his departure from Community with a series of notes handwritten at a Residence Inn (“I’M SCARED PEOPLE WILL FIND OUT WHAT I MASTURBATE TO”). He released Because the Internet—a rewardingly messy album with a sly thematic complexity—alongside a bleak screenplay about the suddenness of death. His headlining set at last year’s Coachella felt stiff at first, but gave way to emotional monologue fragments about his father’s passing and about Nipsey Hussle’s, and some sincerely cathartic performances. Glover seems to toggle back and forth between not caring about the artifice of celebrity and mimicking the pose of someone who feels that way. He has learned to use this inscrutability to interesting effect on the screen, but very seldom, so far, on his studio albums. At its best, 3.15.20 Trojan horses some of that terror into happy surroundings. Played in the background, “47.48” sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love—sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition. Glover is not always successful at adding dimension to these songs. “24.19” opens with a condescending ode to a “sweet thing” who moves to Los Angeles and can “still believe in fairy tales”; it sounds like something that would get booed out of an open-mic night. The writing can be exasperating. On the way-too-arch “12.38,” he rhymes “tulips” with “two lips”; the hook of the Ariana Grande duet, “Time,” goes, “Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams/Maybe this world ain’t exactly what it seems.” All of this makes it surprising when Glover does land some of his more poetic bars. There’s something about the way, on “42.26,” he sings about the “men who made machines that want what they decide.” And on “19.10”—an album highlight, a grim song that’s given too much forward motion to brood—he says: “To be happy really means that someone else ain’t.” That last line is reminiscent of a quote Glover gave to the New Yorker in a 2018 profile. Riding in an SUV with the reporter, a bodyguard, and his Atlanta co-star, Zazie Beetz, Glover defends the trap music on the radio that the others are denigrating. “Y’all are forgetting what rap is,” he says. “Rap is ‘I don’t care what you think in society, wagging your finger at me for calling women “bitches”—when, for you to have two cars, I have to live in the projects.’” As far back as 2011, Glover was rapping about how hip-hop songs are seldom given more than superficial readings. In “Be Alone” he scoffs at how his music might be wilfully mistaken for Plies’ and, implicitly, at the very notion that that would be an insult. The first music cue in the Atlanta pilot is an OJ da Juiceman song; “35.31,” from this new album, sounds like a children’s version of another one. To be clear, this is an excellent thing. On that song, Glover is playful, knowing, leaning into his gifts for melody and charm—doing all this in service of something much darker or, if you prefer, finding what can be playful within that darkness.","Donald Glover’s got big hooks and big ideas, but his spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.

Empty Country,Empty Country,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e74e8222a54c60008d8e383/1:1/w_160/Empty%20Country_Empty%20Country.jpg,2020-03-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/empty-country-empty-country/,Get Better,"For a band that spent four albums fixating on demises, Cymbals Eat Guitars didn’t dwell too much on their own. The New Jersey indie rock band quietly confirmed their breakup after the fact, nearly two years after a trio of 2017 hometown farewell shows they hadn’t announced as such. The end came, in large part, out of recognition they’d hit their ceiling. After years of playing to shrinking crowds, the band once hyped as indie rock’s next big thing realized “there was nowhere else for us to go,” as frontman Joseph D’Agostino tells it. Even Cymbals Eat Guitars’ small cult of devotees would have a hard time arguing with that. They were a great band, but a niche one, their music too sour and anxious to sit alongside The National or Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros on one of Barack Obama’s playlists. They could conjure the rousing, go-for-broke sweep of Springsteen or The Clash, but where those artists’ big songs played liked triumphs, theirs sounded like panic attacks. Between D’Agostino’s squalid storytelling and shell-shocked voice, nobody was going to license a Cymbals Eat Guitars song for a car commercial. If there’s an upside to the band’s breakup, though, it’s that anything D’Agostino records is going to sound at least a little like Cymbals Eat Guitars, and so it is with the debut from his solo project Empty Country. Patched together with a lineup of friends and family, the self-titled record really isn’t much further removed from Cymbal Eat Guitars than any of that band’s albums were from their predecessors. It thunders a little less and wanders a little more, and although the arrangements are still dense and twisty, they clear room for chiming acoustic guitars, bright pedal steels and occasional strings. The album is vaguely indebted to Americana, but it’s a tourist’s fascination with country, not an aficionado’s. And D’Agostino’s driving muse, as if the cemetery on the album cover left any doubt, remains death. The glimmering “Marian” opens the record with a half-hopeful song about a 1960s miner who has a vision of his own death in a mine collapse, then foresees his daughter’s adulthood. Queasy and distressed even by Cymbals Eat Guitars’ standards, “Ultrasound” documents an anguished week waiting for his wife’s biopsy results: “Body horror, pace the hall, waiting for the morning call/We tried to sleep, we’re spinning ’round, a shadow on an ultrasound,” D’Agostino sings, sounding near hyperventilation over nerve-racking distortion. The sweeter the music becomes, the nastier the subject matter turns. Behind its uptempo strum and dulcet strings, the album’s jauntiest number “Becca” is essentially a horror story, a tale of a woman who tricks families into staring at the solar eclipse by handing out fake eclipse glasses. It ends on a note of sheer terror, as its narrative turns to her victims: “Waking in the darkness to their crying kids, feeling for the light switch, they will hear the ocean.” The album’s other great character sketch, the twangy “SWIM,” imagines a Sing Sing prisoner with an especially nihilistic tattoo on his rib cage “of the second plane hitting.” With some reluctance, he concedes his black-out behavior might have hurt someone, and while the character is fictitious, the song’s protest-too-much title (an acronym for “Someone Who Isn’t Me”) makes it clear D’Agostino sees at least a little of himself in his creation. If Empty Country is a shade less wondrous than Cymbals Eat Guitars’ final records, that’s more feature than defect. Those albums were grand statements, designed to resonate with a vast audience, even if that audience didn’t actually exist. What Empty Country lacks in wild swings for the bleachers, though, it makes up for with a rangy intimacy that buys it a different sort of goodwill. “Come and live it down with me,” D’Agostino beckons on the serene, string-kissed coda to “SWIM.” It’s unclear whether that’s an invite to find redemption or to join him in the slums, but it speaks to how sublime the music is that he makes either proposition sound alluring.","Former Cymbals Eat Guitars frontman Joseph D’Agostino’s solo debut is rangier and more intimate than his former band, but taps similar wells of grief and pain.

Through Water,Låpsley,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e70fa234b101700083a93d5/1:1/w_160/Through%20Water_La%CC%8Apsley.jpg,2020-03-26 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lapsley-through-water/,XL,"Låpsley’s debut, Long Way Home, slipped into enough corners of the music world that it might as well have been three albums, not one. The drifty adult-contemporary track “Hurt Me” anchored her to British radio; DJ Koze’s disco remix of “Operator”—which the German producer called a “unique and perfect” song—took her to the clubs. And Billie Eilish fashioned her breakout single, “Ocean Eyes,” after Låpsley’s “Station.” That’s a lot of possible directions to take; given that “Hurt Me” was her biggest hit, it would have been incredibly easy for the UK singer to start down the dismal path to becoming another Adele (a fellow XL signee) or Ed Sheeran. Fortunately, Låpsley is more interesting than that, and Through Water refines her sound: heavy piano chords; wistful, solipsistic duets with her own pitched-down voice; high, ethereal backing vocals; and low, mournful synth pads like artfully arranged clouds. The title track drifts and swirls around a recording of Låpsley reading a speech by her father, a sustainable-development and water engineer, chopped up and echoed. The effect is a little James Blake, a little Enigma, and more than a little evocative. Out of its original context, the speech’s science jargon is rather abstract—all “impacts,” “mitigation,” “adaptation”—and Låpsley’s own meditations on extreme weather events come couched in distance as well. It’s an unusual take on climate change, which artists more often make cyberpunk or grotesque. Låpsley’s version isn’t an apocalypse but a slow dissolution, which is more often how these things go; the accidental yet unavoidable subtext is that the planet is in its own crisis now, of the shut-in and quiet kind. Against this claustrophobia, the narcotic ASMR spell of Through Water is a comfort. Such aesthetic clarity is vital for an album that, judging from its credits, should be all over the place. Låpsley wrote and produced most of the record, but her collaborators include adult-contemporary linchpin Eg White (Adele, Florence and the Machine); while making the album, she says, she listened to “lots of WizKid, Drake, Robyn, [and] Ryuichi Sakamoto.” This isn’t a coherent sound so much as four playlists merged and shuffled, and it’s remarkable how Låpsley turns them into one. When Låpsley mentioned Robyn, she was talking about her own “My Love Was Like the Rain”: “I never really write at such a fast tempo, and I just remember shoving loads of, like, Robyn tracks on, and thinking, ‘I want to make a song that has this kind of energy!’” she told Apple Music. But what emerged was no Body Talk banger, nor (thank goodness) landfill alt-pop, but something more like a discotheque returned to the overgrowth. Sedate organs and synth pads flood it like water, and backing vocals and synth wind around it like vines; only the hollowed-out, crackling skeleton of a beat hints at what it once was. Elsewhere, the lush pastoralia of “Our Love Is a Garden” is Låpsley’s homage to 4AD in the days of Ivo Watts-Russell and This Mortal Coil. She follows it up with the stunning instrumental “Leeds Liverpool Canal,” fogged over by minor chords and underpinned by sounds of running water (Through Water at its most ASMR) that a delicate piano line hits like sunlight. The effect is haunting, almost post-apocalyptic, like morning after a disaster. The alchemy doesn’t work every time. The Afrobeats-inspired “First” is like hearing Drake and WizKid through stagnant water, less “One Dance” than one lilt. Her less inventive arrangements lapse into mundane ballads—“Speaking of the End,” or the first half of “Bonfire,” which fortunately does go places—and half-hearted dance, like “Womxn”; perhaps this one just needs its own disco mix. Låpsley’s songwriting, though formalist—full of tidy extended metaphors and twists on cliches—can be deceptively spiky. “My Love Was Like the Rain” turns an old Shakespearean conceit into an ex-partner’s litany of negs (“Remember when you said my love was like a rose/Not the sweet bloom, but the pain as it scratches your hand”). But the partner’s an afterthought, and their half-insults something to embrace: “I embody these elements; I wear them like a fragrance.” There’s a concealed bitterness to her voice on that chorus, but the rest of the track is shimmering and warm and alive. An aquatic rose-and-lily fragrance, after all, would be rather pleasant, actually, and soothing. And an album that embodies black skies, pulverizing rain, and cerebral, arctic chill can be quite compelling: winter, but the kind you can burrow into forever.","The UK singer refines her sound into something moody and aquatic, trading a narrowly escaped adult-contemporary fate for narcotic electronic pop with ASMR undertones.

Let It All In,Arbouretum,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7a597d723e070008e54f89/1:1/w_160/600x600bb%20(1).jpg,2020-03-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arbouretum-let-it-all-in/,Thrill Jockey,"Even when they were a young Baltimore band, Arbouretum felt proudly old. They emerged in the ’00s amidst a scene charged with youthful possibility —the electronic fantasias of Dan Deacon, the aptly named projections of Ecstatic Sunshine, the dream-pop diaries of Beach House. Arbouretum, meanwhile, mined Richard Thompson’s intricate British folk revivalism, Will Oldham’s stately country psychedelia, and the gnarled roots of both. The anachronism was alluring, a mysterious shade of gray lurking inside a kaleidoscopic city. In the years since, Arbouretum have methodically adjusted that formula, tweaking familiar elements like a baker adjusting the ratios of a sourdough starter. In the process, they have alternately seemed listless or impatient. Maybe they’ve finally found their perfect balance, because they have never sounded more settled—or more quietly electrifying—than they do on Let It All In, their seventh and most assured album. After nearly two decades, Arbouretum have grown into their age. Whether weaving intricate leads or exploding into Pentecostal solos, founder Dave Heumann has long been a rousing guitarist. But after 15 years, he helms a band that knows when to press him forward or let him roam. The gentle harmonies and surging chorus of “How Deep It Goes” lead to a bluesy and triumphant Heumann solo, while “Buffeted by Wind” channels the sublime warmth of the Byrds in their prime for a meditation about finding redemption in being deserted. As a songwriter, Heumann has sometimes been burdened by tradition, attempting to shoehorn his experiences into antiquated inspirations. But Let It All In feels lived-in and newly cut from his core. He finds meaning in the high peaks and deep ravines of the American West and forces himself to stay awake through the night just to remember we can be remade with the morning. His images are subtly evocative: “Shifting grids in dreamsight’s fracture-written key” he intones on “A Prism In Reverse,” while on “Headwaters II,” he howls “The river’s born high/Where the sky breaks to meet the divide.” The band, now in perfect lockstep, seems to understand him. They are as fragile as his gently crackling voice during the beautiful “Prism in Reverse,” as committed to overcoming doom as he is during “Headwaters II.” They crackle with the intensity of Television and the insistence of Endless Boogie throughout the title track, a 12-minute tirade about being overwhelmed by the world but trying to remain open to its wonder. For the second half, Heumann rabidly twists and turns through variations on a note or two, damning expectations of a guitar solo like Neil Young a half-century ago. The band cheers him on wordlessly. Arbouretum have never been concerned with being fashionable, but our times have changed to match their baseline anxiety. Heumann writes from the perspective of the perennially dispossessed, whether as the refugee of flooded coastal plains during the boogie-woogie thriller “High Water Song” or as ordinary folks seeking communion for the hypnotic “A Prism in Reverse.” Even when these songs are about fleeing some tough fix, Heumann documents the solidarity of our struggle for validation. “No Sanctuary Blues” captures the curse and hope many of us face daily—waking each morning to find a world so crowded with the noise of the news that madness seems a turn away. Heumann gets lost in his guitar, its notes like a tangle of briars, but reemerges to flee his “mounting sense of lack.” The band soon arrives to join him, repeating a simple little riff for two minutes like it’s a communal mantra. In that moment, everything else falls away.","The long-running Baltimore folk-rock band has never sounded so at ease, or so electrifying.

Fountain,Lyra Pramuk,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e72887e25a55d0008c629d3/1:1/w_160/Fountain_Lyra%20Pramuk.jpg,2020-03-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lyra-pramuk-fountain/,Bedroom Community,"When Lyra Pramuk was a child, her parents insisted she go to two different churches every Sunday. It made for a long day and so, as she explained on a recent podcast, she joined a choir at one of them as a way to kill time. Singing soon grew into a way of life and, as she got older, led her to classical training. At university, however, she felt conflicted by the expectation to pursue a traditional operatic or choral career path; inspired by the pop artists she listened to outside of class (Björk, M.I.A., Missy Elliott), she was interested in using her voice as an instrument in more experimental ways. Looking back at her time in children’s choirs, she realized that the archetype of the prepubescent child with a voice as pure as “a bell” represents a “fetishized sound.” On Fountain, the composer and producer’s debut album, Pramuk explores her voice—and her spirituality—with a considerably more holistic outlook. Each and every sound on Fountain sprang from the same source: Pramuk’s voice. The rhythms, the melodies, the textures—it’s all her, even the bits that don’t sound like her, or even human. Along with using recognizable performance techniques like vibrato and humming, Pramuk heavily processed many of her largely non-verbal vocals, manipulating and layering them to create an orchestra of herself—a technological excavation of her own body’s resonant possibilities inside a tender vision of a post-human future. On occasion, Pramuk leans toward the wistful meandering of Arthur Russell, albeit wordlessly (for example, in the warm glow of lead single “Tendril”); at other times, she evokes the primal world-making of Anna Homler, who devised her own non-verbal vocal technique that involved “exploring the body like a cave.” The voice, like the self, is fluid, not fixed. Depending on the time of day, the weather, your age, hormone levels, the amount of sleep you got, how you’re feeling, and countless other variables, your voice can sound different—sometimes marginally so, sometimes radically. Pramuk’s extensive vocal recordings and reimaginings, then, weave a spectrum of situational factors into the fabric of Fountain, rendering it the most personal of documents. The line “You say it best when you say nothing at all” comes to mind, a phrase that illuminates the emotional fluency of Pramuk’s often wordless vocals. “Xeno” sounds like a folktale. It builds from a vulnerable mew (like that of a young creature trying to feel its way through a new world) to a vibrating wall of sound; unscalable and ambiguous. On the austere yet grounding “Cradle,” Pramuk casts herself as a cello, using her computer to stretch her voice into the shape of a bow soberly meeting its strings. It’s the closest she gets to a chamber choir on the album, anchoring her creative progression in her musical beginnings. “Gossip,” on the other hand, feels like a playful tribute to her adopted home of Berlin. Dozens of vocal bits and bytes arrange themselves in crosshatch, creating a scene of harmony and happenings, of exchange and excitement. In spirit rather than sound, “Gossip” makes me think of Pramuk’s longtime collaborator Colin Self and his 2018 song “Quorum,” which features artists Martine Syms and Diamond Stingily enacting the exhilaration of a video chat with a close friend. Gossip is a bonding agent. It’s not only the information that knits people together, but the way it is shared: with laughter and in the kind of intimate tones reserved for one’s nearest and dearest. Not that anyone needs to be told that the voices of loved ones buoy the spirit. Or that spirituality is deeply rooted in one’s own being and experience. In form and in practice, Pramuk’s debut album generously looks inward to illuminate the multiplicity of the self. Fountain is too rich in scope and meaning to be reduced to just a salve, but there’s no doubt it’s an oh-so-timely reminder that the body is a site of infinite possibility. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.","On her debut album, the American musician works entirely with recordings of her own voice, processing and layering largely non-verbal sounds to explore the very fiber of her being.

I Am Not a Dog On a Chain,Morrissey,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e711d125d64430008c92fb0/1:1/w_160/Dog%20On%20a%20Chain_Morrissey.jpg,2020-03-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/morrissey-i-am-not-a-dog-on-a-chain/,BMG,"The intoxicating, mostly-celibate, square-jawed Steven Patrick Morrissey carries on. Crotchety and vegetarian, and here on the release of his 13th studio album, Moz remains a bitchy, fabulous sulk turned something of a red-pill pharmacist, dealing anyone within earshot a long list of forces to be wary of. Across the past few decades, these include, but aren’t limited to: Muslims, Britain’s immigration policy writ large, the editorial staff of The Guardian, global safety precautions surrounding COVID-19, allegiance toward political parties other than one headed by someone with the “guts to be honest about Islam,” et cetera, et cetera. Once known for perverting pop music by way of a beautiful, excessive and unsmiling universe of both art and devotee, Morrissey’s vistas have since shrunk. His present fanbase is survived by the morose, the nostalgic, the unaware, a large number of Latinxs, and those who have actively chosen to forgo Morrissey (the man) for Morrissey (the feeling). It’s the heaven you might find in misery, the forgiveness the heartbroken feels for the heartbreaker, the mental calculus one undergoes when realizing the hero who once made you cry and perhaps saved your life might, at some fundamental level, find your existence repugnant. “Imagine,” finishes a breathless review of a concert in late 2019, “being hit by the world’s most beautiful fist.” That fist, pink-knuckled and beefy, sails across I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, starting at its title and traveling across its tracklist. (You see, the dog is Morrissey and the chain is society.) As with all documents by obsessives fixated on their targets, the album can be frequently ridiculous, mildly captivating, and occasionally repetitive, pocked by moments of goofiness that come from the runoff of a man eager to chase old miseries and find new ones to berate. As if he could be anyone else, Morrissey is entirely Morrissey across the piece—relishing in characteristically aggro songwriting, taking decadent, hairpin turns from caustic to maudlin, and lyric sheets as funny and belligerent as the mind from which they flow. “Jim Jim Falls,” for instance, an electroclashy anthem about living life full-assed, climaxes sweetly with, “If you're gonna kill yourself, then for God's sake, just kill yourself.” Moz regularly points out what he dislikes in the world, much of it tinted with a contemporariness that somehow already feels stale. In “What Kind of People Live in These Houses?”—a track posed as a rhetorical question, a favorite Moz device—we find a “duckface in a duplex,” those who “look at television thinking it's their window to the world,” and those who “don't know how to change.” Elsewhere, as in the hammy “Knockabout World,” the tone swerves from an invective on how big and irritating society can be into a standard-issue Morrissean plunge into deliciously saccharine romance: “Congratulations, you’re still OK. I’d kiss your lips off any day.” The effect is, after all these years, still charming. Morrissey spends his time at odds with himself, unsure whether he is a decadent Wildean type, a devious free-thinker, or a shock dispensary here to alert the masses that their world is ugly, misshapen, and obscene. Nothing tires as quickly as shock. Some bits are wonderfully embarrassing: “Oh, maybe I'll be skinned alive...because of my views,” goes the title track, warningly, wincingly, waggingly. “Listen out for what’s not shown to you. And there you’ll find the truth.” Most songwriters dodge these tropes out of either decorum or boredom, but this is Moz’s vision of radical truth-telling. Victim to the inner rash that grows in many writerly men over a certain age and of a certain mind, Moz’s existential chafe against the world is not without good company. “I’ve grown entirely comfortable in being both liked and disliked, adored and despised,” author Bret Easton Ellis writes halfway through White, a book-length treatise that asserts how much he doesn’t care about his public perception in the wake of tedious, performative, and inflammatory claims. Or, it’s like Michel Houellebecq, French enfant terrible and bestselling writer whose novels veer indefatigably provocative and more than a little Islamophobic. “If I am notorious,” he notes, “it is because other people have decided that this is how I should be.” The three men—American, French, and English—are kin in their infamy for one reason.  It is an attitude that’s absolute, ancient, and marked by a peculiar, helpless assertiveness. The stuff of one who might, in any language, but in the same universally-understood shrug, note that they are “just being honest.” But “just being honest” is both an indulgent and tendentious idea. In reality, Morrissey would like you to know that he is still here, that his lifelong bile has not yet settled, and that his refusal to fall into wimpish modern orthodoxies remains unscathed. One has the right to nag—it’s part of the unspoken artistic birthright to provoke—and bitterness isn’t even necessarily unattractive. But Morrissey’s bitterness is firm and stolid, an adamance to self-righteousness that creates a moral and aesthetic compass by which to navigate a system that—as he wails in “Knockabout World,” the second single—turned him “into a public target.” In his fat, florid autobiography—hilariously published directly on Penguin Classics, a literary imprint that doesn’t normally canonize living authors—Moz describes a passion for the early punk band the New York Dolls as an ultimate and totalizing sum of everything he wanted to embody, both as performer and as a body. “Their eyes are indifferent,” he writes. “They have left the order of this world."" His admiration comes from their strange way of floating out of space, out of time, out of care—a freedom to exist entirely on their own terms. Morrissey, whose eyes are far from indifferent, has managed to achieve the total opposite: He has become exceptionally of this world.","Mildly captivating, occasionally repetitive, and frequently ridiculous, the 13th studio album from the fabulous sulk turned red-pill pharmacist is Moz’s vision of radical truth-telling.

Who Sent You?,Irreversible Entanglements,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7115dc4b101700083a93d7/1:1/w_160/Who%20Sent%20You?_Irreversible%20Entanglements.jpg,2020-03-25 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/irreversible-entanglements-who-sent-you/,International AnthemDon Giovanni,"Working as Moor Mother, the Philadelphia poet and musician Camae Ayewa styles her music for sensory overload. Compressing hip-hop, punk, industrial, electronic, and noise music into a siren blare, she thrusts hundreds of years of brutal injustices in our faces, as if hoping to cram as much information through as small an opening as possible. The brevity of her songs often reflects this exigency: In discussing the throttling 83 seconds of “Deadbeat Protest” (from her 2016 album Fetish Bones) during a Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Ayewa said such brevity was “to get all the information in a short amount of time.” As a member of the jazz ensemble Irreversible Entanglements, Ayewa’s approach to time has shifted. Within the expanse of the form, she knows she can convey the same urgent information at a much slower pace, allowing the group—horn players Keir Neuringer and Aquiles Navarro, bassist Luke Stewart, drummer Tcheser Holmes—to elevate her into new places. She picks her spots within the music accordingly, punctuating each of the album’s five expansive compositions. Space defines the album, the band evoking our American topography, both physically and psychologically, capturing what’s in the news and what’s been repressed underneath that surface. At times, their 2017 debut album felt like a travelogue, and “The Code Noir/ Amina” continues that trajectory, with Ayewa evoking the Deep South, Holy Hill, and South Carolina. Whereas a Moor Mother song would typically clock out well before the two-minute mark, here she’s only just getting started by then, conveying a stunning image of scorched earth: “A mountain ain’t nothin but a tombstone for fire.” Stewart’s bass and Holmes’ drums keep everything at a rolling boil as the horn lines rove, expand, and Ayewa’s focus widens. She speaks of the void, the African ancestors who actually built America and died nameless, then asks: “At what point do we give a shit, do we stand up and say something?” That’s not the only question she asks. The 15-minute title track begins by interrogating a beat cop, then expands to “stop and frisk” policies in general, and ultimately encompasses the sense that for most communities of color, the local police department is an occupying force at best. Ayewa, Neuringer, and Stewart first played together at a Musicians Against Police Brutality event, organized after the NYPD shot and killed Caribbean immigrant Akai Gurley, and as the band roars toward a furious climax, they even invoke Gurley’s name. Yet right at the peak, Ayewa’s voice vanishes and everything drops away to near-silence. Spare horn lines rise and evoke the eerie space of electric Miles, the mood changed entirely. Five minutes pass before she’s heard again, her voice contemplative now, speaking of a brief feeling of freedom that “tasted so good,” a joy measured in gasps. Perhaps the group’s most remarkable attribute is that while anger is ever-present, the fury is tempered, the music focused and controlled. As Ayewa’s inquisitive gaze turns inward on the sinewy Latin-tinged groove of “No Mas,” she remains resolved “to love ourselves fully.” Built from a walking bassline and clanging hand percussion, “Bread Out of Stone” never rises above a simmer to convey the message of resilience in the face of oppression. The shrieking, flailing properties of free jazz are often interpreted as unbridled anger, rising as it did during the heights of the Civil Rights era and inner-city unrest. And while Irreversible Entanglements draws on that tradition, they aren’t merely mimicking an older version of jazz. They are making it resonate now, emphasizing it as a music of ritual, much like Ayewa’s other loves, like gospel and blues. It conveys all of the urgency of her raw, earlier work now across a greater vista, untethered by time yet wholly in the present.","Led by the poet and musician Moor Mother, the jazz ensemble evokes our American topography, both physically and psychologically, by capturing what’s in the news and what’s underneath that surface.

It’s Just Like All the Clouds EP,Lily Konigsberg,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e70ffb281d1d3000863d891/1:1/w_160/All%20the%20Clouds_Lily%20Konigsberg.jpg,2020-03-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lily-konigsberg-its-just-like-all-the-clouds-ep/,Wharf Cat,"At the center of a Venn diagram containing haunted dolls, Arthur Russell, and Ariana Grande sits Lily Konigsberg. The idiosyncratic, shape-shifting Brooklyn musician’s boundless creativity animates a range of projects: the jagged experimental trio Palberta, the avant-pop duo Lily and Horn Horse, and a wide array of collaborations and solo releases under her own name. Konigsberg’s latest solo release, It’s Just Like All the Clouds, is a brief but charming EP of stripped-down indie rock. In four songs recorded by Paco Cathcart (The Cradle), she leans into her bubbliest impulses, enlivening well-worn sounds with earnest playfulness. In all of Konigsberg’s releases, even her most abstract, there is an implicit pop backbone. It’s Just Like All the Clouds takes that tendency and strips it to its essence, resulting in short, infectious songs with punchy hooks. Opener “At Best” dabbles in indie pop, thanks to Konigsberg’s cheery guitar and peppy drums performed by her Palberta bandmate Nina Ryser. “When I find it hard to relax/I fix myself and then/I’m okay/And then I punch my brother/I have a better day,” she sings blithely. Konigsberg has name-dropped Liz Phair as an influence, and the jangly warmth of “I Said” feels especially indebted to the indie-rock legend. “Crushing all the bugs that I find in my hairbrush/Crusty but harmless guys clustering in a circle,” she murmurs sweetly, her honeyed voice veiling the decay beneath. The EP’s title track, on the other hand, is a whimsical burst of Auto-Tune that’s closer to Lily and Horn Horse. It’s a small song that expands kaleidoscopically with zippy whimsy. Lyrically, Konigsberg leans toward minimalism, often relying on the repetition of simple observations. In this case, the message is vague but firm: “Now that you don’t want me I don’t need your time/I’m bound to stay away.” The freewheeling, flitting melodies underline the precision of Konigsberg’s songwriting: She knows what she wants to say and she is methodical about how much to reveal. It’s Just Like All the Clouds closes with the wistful “Summer in the City,” where Konigsberg is joined by frequent collaborators Andre Schiavelli on keys and Charlie Dore-Young on bass and backing vocals. It is an understated vision of nostalgia: As Matt Norman’s pensive horn weaves through the background, Konigsberg captures an elusive longing, letting the melody speak for her. Though the whole EP is over in seven and a half minutes, the warmth Konigsberg generates extends long after the record ends.","The Brooklyn musician, a member of Palberta and the duo Lily and Horn Horse, crafts whimsical, minimalist indie pop with a slippery lyrical sensibility.

After Hours,The Weeknd,by: Isabelia Herrera,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fcda64b101700083a93ce/1:1/w_160/After%20Hours_The%20Weeknd.jpg,2020-03-24 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-weeknd-after-hours/,XORepublic,"The Weeknd’s latest short film opens with the Toronto singer grinning maniacally onstage. He’s just finished a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and blood crawls down the side of his bandaged nose, threatening to drip onto his suit. As the audience cheers, Abel Tesfaye walks backstage, his artificial smile intact, until he reaches a hallway where it fades into a frigid stare. The character he plays is an exaggerated riff on the solipsistic-hedonist persona Tesfaye has been tunneling into since his 2011 mixtape trilogy, where he first introduced listeners to his brand of brooding nihilism. In 2020, he continues to revel in high drama; After Hours dives deep into the textures of pleasure, despair, and how we consciously distance ourselves from our interiors. After years of attempting to bring the spectral tones of his early mixtapes to a mainstream pop format, Tesfaye finally unites his two worlds. His major-label debut Kiss Land was a languid disappointment, and Beauty Behind the Madness failed to live up to the promise made by the Trilogy tapes. After Hours delivers on the most compelling aspects of Tesfaye’s vision; leveraging a self-loathing villain into an irresistible, cinematic narrative with his most satisfying collision of new wave, dream pop, and R&B. Even if he is singing about the same things—bacchanalian excess, loneliness as rapture, using women to rehabilitate his poor little life—the fresh vocals and production flourishes do the trick. On “Too Late,” his longtime producer Illangelo (alongside Lizzo producer Ricky Reed and DaHeala) mutate UK garage’s syncopated kicks and pitch-shifted echoes, drawing on the spirit of My Dear Melancholy,’s “Wasted Times.” “Hardest to Love” couples a sharp jungle break with Tesfaye’s longing whispers about remorse and a troubled partnership. Oneohtrix Point Never and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker also lend production on “Repeat After Me (Interlude)” a collage of psychedelic wooshes and Vocoder dubs, while the ghostly eulogy “Until I Bleed Out” uses liturgical synth arpeggios reminiscent of “Boring Angel” from OPN’s R Plus Seven. There’s always been a cinematic flair to Tesfaye’s music, as if he’s been chasing after his own Purple Rain moment—for now, he’ll have to settle for a cameo in the Safdie Brothers’ 2019 thriller Uncut Gems. He draws on synth-pop nostalgia to mirror the tragic glitz of ’80s Hollywood: “In Your Eyes” includes an arena-sized cheeseball sax solo, while the plinking synths and slick hand-claps of “Save Your Tears” evoke a long-lost Wham! track. Tesfaye can lean a little too hard on these Reagan-era signifiers, but his bleeding-heart melodies and donating an unforgettable hook to the synth player on “Blinding Lights” remind us why we keep listening in the first place. Like any good villain, Tesfaye is aware of the character he plays, dropping tongue-in-cheek one-liners like “Futuristic sex, give her Philip K. Dick” on “Snowchild.” Meanwhile, “Faith” cranks the gloomy dial up to 11, summoning a death drive reminiscent of the double-decker bus from The Smiths’ “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.” “But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me,” he sings. “I want you to follow right behind me.” Despite all these textbook Weekndisms, Tesfaye wants us to know he’s struggling to reconcile the sinner he once was with the man he’s trying to become. He may not be the dysfunctional addict of the Trilogy years, but he’s also not willing to be the partner a woman might need him to be. What more can you expect out of pop music’s antihero? There is not a single song on the album that colors outside the lines he established nine years ago, but his narrow focus has paid off: He’s finally found harmony between the enigmatic noir-pop that broke him to the blogs and the arena-worthy ambition that launched him into the mainstream. It’s hard to tell where the universe of listeners fixated on filling spiritual voids through sex, drugs, and romance ends and the universe of the Weeknd’s tortured, empty melancholy and drunken, devastating love begins. That’s the beautiful blur of After Hours.","Abel Tesfaye finally delivers on his long-running vision, leveraging a self-loathing villain into an irresistible, cinematic narrative with his most satisfying collision of new wave, dream pop, and R&B.

RIVEN,UMFANG,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e726c7e2a54c60008d8e374/1:1/w_160/Riven_Umfang.jpg,2020-03-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/umfang-riven/,Thanks for Enlightening Me,"Emma Burgess-Olson—the New York producer best known as UMFANG—has often emphasized the self-imposed limitations on her work. When she designs artwork for her albums and flyers, she often limits herself to the rudimentary tools pre-installed on her computer, rather than using something more powerful, like Photoshop. As she’s become one of New York’s most respected producers of both techno tracks and more obtuse experiments, she’s often forced herself to make music under similar constraints. Most of UMFANG’s 2017 album Symbolic Use of Light, for example, was made with a single drum machine that she bought off a friend for $50. She pitched up basslines from the device to make piercing lead melodies, finding a surprising lushness in her stripped-down setup. Even when she isn’t explicitly making records with a single piece of gear, her work is marked by stylistic restraint. Though she shirks ornamentation and excess, there’s a sort of sleight of hand embedded in her process. If she didn’t tell you, you might not notice that she’s working with such a limited palette. Her keen understanding of space and dynamics makes just a few overlapping rhythms and melodies feel unexpectedly expansive. Burgess-Olson hasn’t explained the specifics of the creation of RIVEN, the first release on her new label Thanks for Enlightening Me, but its eight tracks evince a similar philosophy. None are especially busy; it’s rare to hear more than a few layers of instrumentation going at once. Often, she’ll zero in on just a sound or two, letting them loop and mutate, and figuring out what feelings present themselves in the meditative repetition. “Rubber” is built around a single, spare synth phrase that echoes delicately as a percussive bass part thrums in the far distance. The song doesn’t change much after its oozy intro, but had she given in to the temptation to add more, its fragile beauty could have easily been shattered. This discipline isn’t necessarily a surprising approach for a producer schooled on techno, a genre that’s often austere by design. What makes RIVEN special is how diverse it manages to be, even with its relatively sparse parts. The record opens with an ambient yawn called “Flare,” which quickly gives way to prismatic keygen funk (“Glass Escalator”), dubby refractions (“2 Body Beat”), overcast techno (“Riven”), slowly unfolding kosmische (“Rubber”), and even ghostly approximations of grime instrumentals (“Baby Blue”). The tracks can be long and elliptical, but they don’t settle into a mood for longer than a song or two, which gives the record an ecstatic energy despite its low-key arrangements. UMFANG has shown this kind of range before, dipping into skeletal experimentation on records like Riffs and more straightforward floor-fillers on albums like OK, but she’s never tried out this many different sounds on one record. In that way, RIVEN feels like a testing ground for new ideas and forms that she wants to bring into the fold of the broader UMFANG project. Yet the relative minimalism of each piece lends the record a comforting uniformity. It’s like opening a sketchbook and seeing still lifes of all sorts of objects, each rendered in the same style: simple, stark, and elegant.","The Discwoman co-founder’s keen understanding of space and dynamics makes just a few overlapping rhythms and melodies feel unexpectedly expansive.

Lapse in Passage,Mute Duo,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fb7c581d1d3000863d885/1:1/w_160/Lapse%20In%20Passage_Mute%20Duo.jpg,2020-03-24 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mute-duo-lapse-in-passage/,American Dreams,"Mute Duo’s music is emblematic of their deep roots in Chicago. Pedal steel guitarist Sam Wagster and drummer/multi-instrumentalist Skyler Rowe draw on the city’s long legacy of omnivorous instrumental music, with a sound that is slow and wide open, incorporating elements of free improvisation, ambient music, and Americana. Many artists in Chicago’s underground music scene seek commonalities in seemingly divergent styles, inventing a new vernacular from their juxtaposition. Mute Duo’s list of local collaborators, ranging from folk-leaning mainstays Ryley Walker and Bill MacKay to up-and-coming jazz musicians Matthew Lux and Ben Lamar Gay, marks them as direct inheritors of that approach. Though the duo is similarly innovative, the results of their experimentations are mixed. Lapse In Passage, the group’s second album, alternates between languid improvisations and riff-centric pieces. Regardless of compositional method, each track feels dusty and ragged, unfolding at a pace that slips fluidly between measured and lethargic. The music’s doomy twang recalls the mellow late-period albums of drone metal pioneers Earth, and the occasional glissandos of Wagster’s pedal steel paired with Rowe’s expressive, untethered drumming bring it close to Australian trio Dirty Three. His inventive approach to the kit, which places equal weight on colorful flourishes and steady time-keeping, provides Lapse in Passage with much of its character. The duo configuration lends itself to a sparse and conversational atmosphere, with each member taking turns conjuring the smoky ambience and generating steady forward motion among the haze. The album arrives at a moment of pedal steel renaissance in experimental music, as Pitchfork contributor Jesse Jarnow pointed out in a recent essay. With its extended range and ability to slide between notes, the pedal steel has the capacity to create mystifying, idiosyncratic music. But Wagster only takes advantage of his instrument’s extraordinary potential for novelty in a few moments. It’s not that he plays into stereotypical Nashville tropes. Instead, with the exception of moments like the swelling rush of melody on the otherwise laid-back “Dallas In the Dog Days” or the subtly drifting chords that open “Canopy Bells,” much of the album sounds like it could have been written and realized on a standard six-string. It feels like a missed opportunity, as so many others develop new ways to make the instrument sing. This dynamic embodies a significant difference between Mute Duo and their brightest peers and forebears in Chicago. While Wagster and Rowe’s amalgam of styles is unique, they rarely deviate from that formula once they’ve established it. After you’ve eased into Mute Duo’s sound, it is hard to be surprised by anything that follows. Classic groups like Art Ensemble of Chicago and Gastr del Sol, and more recently standouts like ONO and Angel Bat Dawid, are constantly reinventing—not just weaving together various genre signifiers, but making a practice of breaking their own rules. Despite Rowe’s impressive improvisational skills and the creative way he and Wagster synthesize elements of different traditions, Mute Duo largely stay in the lane of their own making. This doesn’t make Lapse In Passage unpleasant, or even wholly uninteresting. There are moments, such as the climax of “Red-winged Blackbirds” when Rowe adds pounding atonal piano to the swirl of distorted pedal steel, that they tiptoe toward something like rapture. Opener “Derived from Retinas” is the album’s strongest song, moving through several different distinct movements: at first heavy, dour, and full of grit, then emerging triumphantly into a major key. But when they stretch out into looser, less defined structures, like the nearly 10-minute “Overland Line,” they drift into a comfort zone and stay there for the duration. The more purposeful and focused Wagster and Rowe are, the more enjoyable it is to get lost in their music.","The Chicago duo makes slow and wide-open instrumental music for drums and pedal steel guitar, creating its own lane and rarely straying from it.

He quite literally put the beat in Afrobeat. The legacy of the late Hugh Masekela, who died in 2018, is no less majestic. As a trumpeter he made his mark on every band he played with. Exiled from South Africa during apartheid, he spent much of the 1960s in London and New York, scoring a No.1 hit with “Grazing in the Grass” and making a name for himself on the Manhattan jazz scene. By 1984 he was in West Africa, where, through Fela, his friend and contemporary, he met Allen. Almost as soon as they connected, the two decided they should try to make music together, but it would be more than 25 years before they finally met up in London’s Livingston Studios. Those 2010 sessions flowed like a conversation, with Allen laying down a drum track, Tom Herbert or Mutale Chashi adding bass, and Masekela answering with melodies on his flugelhorn. The result is Rejoice, a collaborative record that Allen calls “a kind of South African-Nigerian swing-jazz stew,” a skeletal Afrobeat infused with the spirit of bebop, with lyrics in English, Yoruba, and Zulu reflective of the transatlantic exchange that has defined the African diaspora for centuries. Allen has been cooking up variations of this recipe for the past few years: It’s evident in the jazz stylings of his last solo LP, The Source, and in his tribute to bebop legend Art Blakey, who he credits as a major influence to his own style. His recordings with Masekela feel like old friends catching up after years apart. Masekela’s flugelhorn is the most expressive voice on the record, bright and nimble, piercing in tone but gentle in force, bearing passport stamps from Johannesburg, London, and New York. Allen’s touch is light, but he strikes with the confidence of a player who knows he doesn’t need to attack the drum to be heard. His snare drives the grooves, occasionally sputtering into micro-rolls, and the full-kit fills occupy the negative space in Masekela’s melodies. They’re effortlessly in sync, belying their limited experience collaborating with each other. The record’s session players are plucked from London’s contemporary jazz scene: the Ezra Collective’s Joe Armon-Jones on keys, Chashi (Kokoroko) and Herbert (Acoustic Ladyland) on bass, and Steve Williamson on tenor saxophone, among others. Each instrument is rendered in stunning detail; from a technical standpoint, Rejoice is a  remarkable feat of production from World Circuit’s Nick Gold. The record’s stereo imaging places you in Allen’s shoes, directly behind the kit. On “Coconut Jam,” as the hi-hat and snare keep time in one ear, the ride cymbal punctuates the beat in the other, and fills across the toms ripple across the soundstage from right to left, the echo of each strike as clear as if you were in the room. You’d be hard-pressed to find a cleaner, more elegantly mixed recording of Allen’s stick work. As much as Rejoice, Masekela’s first posthumous release, is about two musicians finding common musical ground, the specter of Fela also looms large. “Never” is their tribute to the late legend, a mournful celebration of the indelible mark he left on the city in which the pair met: “Lagos never gonna be the same/Without Fela/Never!” As danceable as any Fela song, it’s one of the few tracks on the album where Masekela sings, and his voice is filled with pride and joy and sorrow. It’s the voice of a man singing for his friend, a reflection of his memory. Similarly, Rejoice is a tribute to Allen’s friendship with Masekela, a record of their respect and admiration for one another. One can imagine Allen’s experience of combing through the sessions in the summer of 2019, not long after Masekela’s death, reliving their brief time together creating the record they had always imagined making. It’s all there in the groove: a love letter that could only be written by two masters at the peak of their powers, a fitting send-off to a friend. It’s also a record defined by wisdom and experience. As it celebrates the end of one journey, it looks hopefully upon the start of many new ones. When Masekela sings the refrain in Yoruba on “We’ve Landed”—“Ise lori lo fii nsere,” a sentiment that loosely translates as “your work begins”—he’s speaking to the youth of today, in both an acknowledgement of their newfound maturity and an encouragement of their self-awakening. It’s a subtle message from two elder statesmen closely intertwined with the political struggles of the African continent: Our time is passing, and it’s your turn to stand up.","Two years after the South African trumpeter’s death, this 2010 studio session with the legendary Nigerian drummer documents their unique fusion of Afrobeat and jazz.

Less Is Moor,Zebra Katz,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fc37c690af00008f80413/1:1/w_160/LESS%20IS%20MOOR_Zebra%20Katz.jpg,2020-03-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/zebra-katz-less-is-moor/,ZFK,"The seed for Less Is Moor, the razor-sharp debut album from rapper Zebra Katz, was planted over a decade ago. The Jamaican-American artist born Ojay Morgan studied liberal arts at Eugene Lang College in New York, where he took drama classes, and, as one of the few black people ever in the room, was consistently typecast for roles. Morgan designed a rebuke in the form of his 2007 senior thesis, “Moor Contradictions,” a brashly playful and incisive commentary on the Moorish characters in Shakespeare works, delivered as a one-man performance through different black identities. One of them was the sharp-witted Zebra Katz, a character who would create funny, off-the-cuff raps out of any subject the audience tossed out at him. After footage of the character picked up traction online, Morgan kept Katz alive by self-producing low-end-driven backdrops for his deep, hypnotizing flow. By 2012, Morgan had perfected the formula and forged a full-on queer cultural moment with “Ima Read,” a deadly ballroom cut picked up by Diplo’s Mad Decent label that remains the clearest vision of the Zebra Katz persona: club-ready, tongue-in-cheek, and perpetually willing and able to cut you down to size. After a minimalist mixtape in 2013 and a collaboration and tour with Gorillaz in 2017, Morgan hunkered down in Berlin to reflect on the Zebra Katz character five years after his breakout, and to plot his debut album. The resulting, independently released Less Is Moor is an unflagging statement on the complexities of Katz’ personality, arriving on a maelstrom of industrial, drum’n’bass, and noise production. The club remains Katz’ sanctum, but here he relishes different styles, whether emotively singing over an acoustic guitar on the wistful “Necklace” or slowing his breakneck pace down to match an unnerving metronomic rhythm on the spacious “Lousy.” The restless ethos, winding between high-energy club gems and sawtoothed electronic interludes, seems to rid Morgan of inhibitions, allowing him to experiment with free rein. Hearing Zebra Katz in his shit-talking element drives Less Is Moor’s most dynamic moments. On standout “In In In,” he traipses through his fashion credentials before adopting a Missy Elliott-style flow to make demands to the dancefloor, while sinister air horns and rolling drums from producer Tony Quattro feed his fire. The eerie, perfectly arrogant “Ish” injects Katz’s venom with humor: “Go off, fuck bitch/You don’t really know ish,” he raps in monotone over swells of distorted bass and anxious sirens. “First thing, own it/I’m the shit, you the piss.” It’s quintessential Zebra Katz: flexing, fanged, ready to throw clubgoers into delirium. Later he recruits London rapper Shygirl for the batshit “Lick It N Split,” where the two trade increasingly demented sex raps over gut-punching drums and carnivalesque synths from Sega Bodega. It sounds like a panic attack, but the giddy sense of humor throughout is like catching a buzz from a pair of extremely stoned friends. With back-to-back club songs, Less Is Moor can fall into a routine even as it explores the varying extremes of Katz’ persona. He spits over a keening whistle on the repetitive deep cut “Sleepn,” and stays on a similar autopilot for “Been Known” despite its delightfully screwy, bass-heavy backdrop. But the album’s highs far outnumber its lows. Katz reels off a merciless freestyle on “Zad Drums,” a highlight with pummeling subterranean drums and an echoing horror-movie vocal. “I got so fuckin’ high last night I kicked myself out of Berghain,” he growls, like he’s telling a story at an after-the-club house party where anything feels possible. That unbridled energy carries Less Is Moor and allows Katz to move wherever his curiosities allow, even in the direction of an indie ballad on “Necklace,” the album’s hushed centerpiece. “I keep on wishin’ I was next,” he sings in a gentle rasp, “Suffer through all of your sweet neglect/Took all my lovin’ for innocence.” It’s a bracing moment of respite between stark club tracks, revealing a vulnerability to the image of Zebra Katz that is both earned and unexpected.","Eight years after “Ima Read,” the club rapper’s debut album channels the ferocity of that breakout single across a maelstrom of different styles while keeping his central shit-talking identity intact.

Vernal Equinox,Jon Hassell,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6129795580e10008f9f3b1/1:1/w_160/Jon-Hassell-Vernal-Equinox-reissue.jpg,2020-03-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jon-hassell-vernal-equinox/,Ndeya,"When Jon Hassell coined the term “Fourth World” to describe his work, he fabricated a musical universe that new artists still call home. Melding the work of minimalists like La Monte Young and Terry Riley with non-Western folk, avant-garde classical and electronic, and early-’70s electric Miles Davis, the trumpeter and composer arrived more or less fully formed in 1977 with his solo debut Vernal Equinox. Originally released on Lovely Music, the label most famous for putting out the music of experimental composer-performer Robert Ashley, Vernal Equinox condensed everything Hassell had to offer the avant-garde of the late ‘70s in a petri dish. Despite his future decades of evolution, there is an uncanny narcotic power and elemental beauty to that first record, which is now being reissued on remastered vinyl and CD by Hassell’s Ndeya records imprint. Before releasing his album, Hassell studied for three years with the Indian vocalist Pandit Pran Nath. With his queasy and heavily manipulated trumpet figures, Hassell hoped to evoke the microtonal quality of Nath’s singing, but from the beginning, Hassell was careful to set his music apart from any discrete tradition. The record’s traditional folk instruments come from South Africa, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. The tambourine-like kanjira is the sole Indian instrument, turned to granular static by electronic processing (“Hex”). On opener “Toucan Ocean,” Brazilian percussionist Naná Vasconcelos introduces the primary rhythmic element on the album—the conga—in its first moments, keeping time with a lengthy, repeated rhythmic pattern and a simple shaker. Hassell’s ensemble introduces electric piano chords, grainy samples of ocean waves, and other effects to gradually build intensity. ”Toucan Ocean” is the only song on the album to which you can reasonably nod your head. Hassell’s music often feels propulsive, but its rhythmic architecture is deceptively fluid and unstable. On most tracks, flurries of percussion—sometimes acoustic, sometimes blurs of digital noise—cluster together into little pockets of free time and chaos. Instead of providing the music’s rhythmic backbone, the album’s percussionists create ambient sounds that match the music’s scrambled synth motifs and samples in importance. Texture becomes its own organizational principle; a slew of disparate elements combine to form one gently vibrating mass. Hassell’s trumpet is at the center of everything, as bent out of recognition as everything else. His elaborate effects chains create speech-like sounds, and his tone often becomes overwhelmed by the sound of his breath. On heavily processed tracks like “Hex” and “Viva Shona,” ping-ponging electronic dots and dashes nearly crowd him out of the mix. However, both “Blues Nile” and the album’s main event—the 21-minute long title track—distill Hassell’s artistry to its most fundamental elements: percussion, drone, and trumpet. He embellishes one or two notes insistently, creating tiny, detuned flutters that evoke a call to prayer for a non-existent religion. The simplicity and intimacy of these compositions is unusual in Hassell’s catalog. Hassell would dig into the more pop-friendly implications of his world-music-like experiments on his Earthquake Island album of the following year. His ensuing collaborations with Brian Eno (who contributes liner notes to this reissue), Peter Gabriel, and David Sylvian in the ‘80s would demonstrate how well Hassell’s style slotted in with other mini-movements in the electronic and art-rock music world. His discography of the ’90s and ’00s would evince restraint and control. But no other entry in Hassell’s catalog has Vernal Equinox’s sense of excitement and discovery, palpable with the introduction of each brilliant new sound.","The trumpeter and composer’s 1977 solo debut, reissued on remastered vinyl, retains its uncanny narcotic power and elemental beauty decades on.

Birthmarks,Hilary Woods,by: Emma Madden,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fab684b101700083a93c3/1:1/w_160/Birthmarks_Hilary%20Woods.jpg,2020-03-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hilary-woods-birthmarks/,Sacred Bones,"Hillary Woods made this record, her second, while she was pregnant. She recorded it between her home in Galway, Ireland and in the home of her producer—the Norwegian noisenik Lasse Marhaug—who has frequently collaborated with Woods’ labelmate Jenny Hval. Noise-folk of this kind is supposed to be more illusory than your traditional pop album, filling in the gaps between each sound so that it becomes its own Rorschach test. Unfortunately, Birthmarks seldom gives you the incentive to find yourself within the record. The conviction of its creators scarcely connects with the convictions of its perceiver. Woods’ previous album, Colt, which she self-produced, indicated that she was a musician with a visual artist’s approach—a patch-worker constructing layer upon layer. Her piano was her underpainting, which she built upon with synths, the occasional grain of microsounds, and foreboding drones. With the help of Marhaug, Birthmarks augments these sound-art elements, giving it a heavier noise-to-music ratio than its predecessor. Birthmarks becomes a minimalist-maximalist mishmash of field recordings, microsounds, maximalist drones without ever coming into focus. The elements are used too liberally and haphazardly, to the point where the album becomes an indecipherable well of sound that’s hard to unscramble. “The Mouth” begins in what sounds like a lonely, long-abandoned bunker, ready to be filled with sound, but it swiftly becomes overembellished with screaming gray noise, whooping saxophone, cinematic strings, horrific, body-convulsing beats (the kind that Zola Jesus used to exhilarating effect on Okovi). While it may have brought Woods “back into her body” while creating it, its overstimulation has the opposite effect. Birthmarks is at its best when its effects are more tempered. “Lay Bare” reaches for the sublime, as Woods’ voice—somewhere between Cocteau Twins’ Elizabeth Fraser and the Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan—abides by the same pitch and cadence as the gorgeous, delirious strings—it just stops short of being overwatered by beauty. By the song’s end, the music is converted back into noise, as a long, unaccompanied drone plays. These smaller moments make visible Woods’ internal and external environments. There could be more of them, as they help to make sense of the album’s more bombastic parts. The acoustic, musical, often beautiful elements of the album—Woods’ voice, repetitive sliding guitar riffs, occasional piano, frequent strings—could potentially signify and give meaning to its nonmusical elements. The core of Woods’ artistry is found in these quiet moments. “I am afraid it’s growing inside of me,” she sings on “Orange Tree,” “My body knows it can’t make it out.” Her voice becomes submerged; her body supposedly oppressed. If Birthmarks is Woods’ restless attempt at self-birth, her true emergence feels yet to come.","The Irish singer and composer’s second album of intimate, experimental folk is at its best when it is quiet and tempered.

Let’s Call It a Day,Move DBenjamin Brunn,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e7898a95455b90008d119a7/1:1/w_160/Let's%20Call%20It%20A%20Day_Move%20D%20Benjamin%20Brunn.jpg,2020-03-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/move-d-and-benjamin-brunn-lets-call-it-a-day/,Smallville,"One afternoon in 2007, the electronic musicians David Moufang (aka Move D) and Benjamin Brunn walked into the Smallville Records shop in Hamburg and heard their own music playing over the speakers. The record in question was Let’s Call It a Day, a one-off set of dubby ambient-techno improvisations that had been released the year before and then disappeared without much trace. In town for a rare duo performance together, they told the shop attendants that there was a bounty of unreleased material from the same sessions sitting on their hard drives, at which point the storekeepers pricked up their ears. The following year, some of those tracks would be released as Songs From the Beehive, the inaugural album on the fledgling Smallville label. Specializing in moody, minimalist house, Smallville was inspired by Dial Records, a Hamburg dance-music institution, even tapping Dial co-founder Peter Kersten for one of Smallville’s early singles. But after its early run of singles, Songs From the Beehive marked a turning point for the label. Instead of the crisp beats and clean lines of the minimal scene, these recordings were shrouded in gaseous abstraction, like architectural photographs shot on fogged film. The dancefloor tracks invoked heady dub-techno pioneers like Porter Ricks; the rest of the album slowed the tempos or eliminated beats altogether, sinking into a state of weightless bliss. There was nothing else like it around at the time, and it established Smallville’s reputation as an electronic music hub of uncommon depth. This reissue of Let’s Call It a Day marks the first time the 2006 album has ever appeared on vinyl or streaming services. It’s opportune timing; ambient music is enjoying a renaissance right now, and Move D and Brunn’s album, with its careful mix of pulse and atmosphere, still sounds unique. Even more than Songs From the Beehive, Let’s Call It a Day achieves an unusual balance between techno’s forward motion and ambient’s amniotic swirl. The album begins with its most sharply defined track. A listener hearing “On the Magic Bus” in 2006 wouldn’t have been completely befuddled; its steady kick drum and answering bursts of white noise approximate dance music’s familiar boom-tick rhythm, while rounded bass tones invoke deep-house pioneer Mr. Fingers. But the whole thing seems suspended in liquid, like the flakes of a snow globe. From there the duo leaves all semblance of the club behind. “Grains” is stirred by a buried dub-techno pulse and a hint of a ticking clock; the rest of the track is just a shimmering field of randomized rattle and squeal, as though a transistor radio had suddenly developed a keen interest in free jazz while the two musicians went on their lunch break. “A” and “Ω” are variations upon a single theme, hypnotically drawing out murky, burbling chords over rustling rhythms. Like Songs From the Beehive, all seven tracks were improvised across four days in Moufang’s studio, but the album’s two highlights show what different forms those freeform sessions could take. “Let’s Call It a Day” is the album’s most ethereal cut, with faint synth chords slowly morphing atop a soft bed of clicks, purrs, and sighs. Trying to trace its creators’ movements is like looking for a guiding hand behind the movements of a lava lamp; it feels like it could bubble along like that for eternity, generating infinite permutations of the same basic pattern. “Magnetically Levitated Train,” on the other hand, constitutes the record’s big emotional payoff: a patient series of jazz-indebted chord changes drawn out across 17 soothing minutes, played with unusual delicacy and imbued with an unmistakably human touch. At the end of a record that feels almost a self-regulating system—some fantastical Rube Goldberg contraption made from an aquarium pump, marbles, and Q-tips—this sweet, sentimental song finally reveals a glimpse of the two men behind the curtain, gently pulling strings.","The pieces on this reissued 2006 album blend techno’s forward motion with the swirl of ambient.

Funky Kingston,Toots and the Maytals,by: Wayne Marshall,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fbb5681d1d3000863d886/1:1/w_160/Funky%20Kingston_Toots%20&%20the%20Maytals.jpg,2020-03-22 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/toots-and-the-maytals-funky-kingston/,MangoIsland,"After a shuffling drum intro, a steady groove invites us to let down our guards and open our ears. With another drum roll, the band pivots to the “one-drop,” Jamaica’s reigning rhythm since the ska days. The kick drum and rimshot anchor the backbeat, often emphasized by an organ stab, while the bass moves a simple, sinuous pattern and the rhythm guitar chops chords between each beat. To heighten our appreciation of this interlocking ensemble texture, the instruments are panned across the stereo field, the lead guitar plucking a lightly bluesy, bubbling counterpoint across the room from the steady offbeat skank. Centered in the mix, Frederick “Toots” Hibbert begins to preach in terms downhome and direct, in a Jamaican country brogue plain enough for all to understand. Sleep won’t come. The rent is too high. Your brother can’t find a dollar, and neither can I. Time tough. In a sly inversion of hip slang, everything is out of sight, but not in a good way—life is so hard even the basics seem out of reach. Today is judgment day, so let us pray and all join in a rising refrain of higher and higher. But this isn’t about spiritual transcendence or ganja-fueled meditation. What’s getting higher is the cost of living. It’s 1974, and the future is unclear. Yet somehow this group playing secular church music in rubbery sync, with chapel-ready backup harmonies and a lead singer in the throes of ecstasy, lift the song itself up to show that deliverance is possible if we band together. “Time Tough” immediately frames Toots and the Maytals’ Funky Kingston as a wry testament to the shared circumstances of the black and working-class masses. It registers the depth of struggle, while offering grounds for celebrating the ways life can and does go on. As its title reveals, the album courted an international audience by nodding to what was then the latest form of black musical currency, a suggestion Toots received from Island Records’ Chris Blackwell, who was impressed by the unlikely crossover success of “Funky Nassau” (1971) by Bahamas-based band The Beginning of the End. Funky was a style Jamaican artists like Toots were proud to pull off with unique swagger. After all, if funk registered an earthy embrace of grit and sweat, Kingston had that in spades. And if funk’s minimalist syncopation of soul mirrored a shift in the Civil Rights movement from liberal reforms to militant demands, reggae was similarly emerging as rebel music, an insurgent expression of Jamaica’s urbanizing, disenfranchised masses—black and proud and loud. Inspired by the strides and styles of their African American brethren and sistren, reggae represented a bottom-up cultural turn in Jamaican music and society, as the Jamaican people voted with their feet to dance along in diaspora rather than have their national culture dictated from above by Eurocentric local elites. Consequently, reggae’s ongoing relationship with American pop is part of what has made it legible for foreign audiences, even when they interpret it on their own terms. An early review of Funky Kingston called it “Jamaican rock’n’roll.” Almost half a century later, in the shadow of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, and other luminaries, it can be hard to appreciate the impact of Toots and the Maytals as reggae found itself on the verge of worldwide exposure. By the early 1970s, the group had earned their place among the cream of the crop, having won over Jamaican audiences for a decade beginning in the ska era, continuing through rocksteady, and helping to cement yet another turn in style and nomenclature in 1968 with their local hit “Do the Reggay.” The Maytals won the annual national Festival Song Competition three times, including the inaugural year of 1966 with the anthemic and much-versioned “Bam Bam.” The Festival’s mission was to cultivate patriotic pride in Jamaican culture, and Toots knew how to ring that bell. Toots’ churchy, country upbringing was key to shaping his nationally resonant voice, but it was also central to his appeal abroad. Before moving to Kingston as a young man, Toots grew up in May Pen, Clarendon, a parish to the west of Kingston and part of the large swath of the island Jamaicans refer to as “country” (as in, anything outside of “town”). Learning to sing in what he described to journalist David Katz as “a clapping church,” the son of two Seventh Day Adventist preachers honed his voice like so many soul-singer counterparts in the U.S. At 13, Toots moved to Trench Town, the same downtown Kingston community that fostered Bob Marley. His prowess was quickly recognized by a couple local boys, Ralphus “Raleigh” Gordon and Nathaniel “Jerry” Matthias, and they formed a vocal trio named after Toots’ hometown. The Maytals’ early recordings and performances in 1963 and ’64 reveal a clear debt to the gospel quartet, their songs closer to revivalist hymns than Brill Building confections or bawdy blues. The trio recorded for such premier producers as Clement “Coxsone” Dodd and Prince Buster, but unsatisfied with the financial side of these ventures, they moved from studio to studio, eventually striking up a thriving partnership with producer Leslie Kong of Beverley’s Records, the label he named after his wife. An 18-month jail sentence for what Toots insists was a trumped-up charge temporarily derailed the Maytals just as the hot new sound of rocksteady—slower, groovier songs played by smaller, more electric ensembles—began to eclipse ska’s jazz-age pomp. Upon his release in 1968, the group reconvened and recorded a song about Toots’ imprisonment for Kong, “54-46 (That’s My Number),” which quickly became the Maytals’ biggest hit. Their success continued over the next few years, and when it was time to cast The Harder They Come, the 1972 cult-favorite film and breakthrough soundtrack that introduced the U.S. counterculture to a new wave of Jamaican music, the Maytals were an obvious choice. The trio steals a scene in the film, singing in the studio as the star-struck country-boy protagonist played by Jimmy Cliff looks on, and two of the dance hall favorites they recorded with Kong in 1969, “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop,” were standouts on the soundtrack. In a documentary about Toots, label exec Chris Blackwell describes him as “easily the biggest act in Jamaica” prior to the rise of Bob Marley. As with Marley’s international success, and the aesthetic calculus made to market him abroad, Blackwell looms large in the story of Funky Kingston. Blackwell signed the Maytals as they were riding reggae’s cresting wave, and as with Marley, he used his marketing savvy to expand the genre’s beachhead overseas. In addition to presenting the music on long-playing albums—not a common format in Jamaica’s single-driven market—he also remixed and overdubbed recordings to make them more sonically familiar to audiences accustomed to rock and pop, and he re-branded his biggest acts through rock’s established lead-man imagery. Under Blackwell’s direction, the Wailers became Bob Marley and the Wailers while the Maytals were recrowned Toots and the Maytals. They were less a group than a vocal trio sutured to the house band at Byron Lee’s Dynamic Sounds studio: Toots, Raleigh, and Jerry, and a group of players called the Beverley’s All-Stars would go on to play together for decades. Initially, Blackwell focused on the UK, a market where Jamaican artists like Millie Small and Desmond Dekker scored crossover pop hits in the 1960s, and where the Windrush generation had built a sound system culture to locally “broadcast” Jamaica’s latest hits. Under his Dragon Records imprint, a collaboration with Dynamic Sounds, Blackwell pushed two albums by Toots and the Maytals to the UK market: 1973’s Funky Kingston and 1974’s In the Dark. Sensing an opportunity in the U.S., Blackwell repackaged these recordings—along with 1969’s “Pressure Drop” for good measure—for a 1975 Mango/Island release that aimed to introduce Toots and the Maytals to the wider international audience quickly warming up to the sound of his country and countrymen. The Mango version of Funky Kingston was widely hailed by music critics as a remarkable achievement for reggae. Lester Bangs called it “perfection” in Stereo Review, and the album narrowly missed the top 10 in the Village Voice’s 1975 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, edged out by the Who by a single point. (To promote the album, Blackwell sent Toots and the Maytals on tour with the Who, as well as the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne.) Hot on the heels of The Harder They Come (1972) and Marley’s Catch a Fire (1973), Funky Kingston captured the group—and reggae—at a creative peak and offered another strategy for marketing Jamaican music to the wider world: letting it be itself. While Bob Marley’s music has succeeded in defining reggae through its massive popularity and influence, his best-known albums are less reflective of the core Jamaican sound at the time. Marley’s first album for Island, Catch a Fire (1973), was extensively re-recorded, remixed, and overdubbed in London. Under Blackwell’s direction, the rougher, darker sound of the Wailers’ Kingston-made multitracks were filtered, brightened, and adorned with Muscle Shoals blues licks and au courant clavinets. Verses were excised to make room for Clapton-esque guitar solos, the lower frequencies of Marley’s voice rolled off to set it apart from all the mid-range clutter. Funky Kingston may have been conceived by Blackwell to target the same overseas audiences, but it differs markedly in this regard. The most Blackwell seems to have meddled is by overdubbing occasional soul-style horns from the Sons of Jungle band, a group of Ghanaian musicians based in London. In contrast to the effects-laden dub approach then taking hold among more experimental reggae producers, or the over-the-top multitracking in the world of rock and pop, the audio engineering on Funky Kingston is meant to be invisible. This lack of aesthetic intervention seems all the more remarkable given how Funky Kingston is so musically invested in genre outreach. Proof of concept and point of pride, the title track offers the clearest example. Built around a one-chord bassline that would make Bootsy Collins grin, “Funky Kingston” carefully balances soul and funk with a solid foundation of one-drop drums and a steady offbeat skank from the piano and rhythm guitar. Eventually, the group indulges in a lightly pedantic James Brown-style breakdown, as Toots brings the instruments back in one by one: “Let me hear your funky guitar … now reggae.” There’s even a guitar solo, though it hardly approaches the blues-rock pyrotechnics that, say, Wayne Perkins added to Marley’s “Concrete Jungle.” The sax here, as with the other horn overdubs on the album, feels gratuitous, but it fits enough to fly. A fusion-forward experiment that could have fallen flat, the song manages to transcend gimmick by mining common ground. While Funky Kingston is often as cosmopolitan as Marley’s music, it is also more local in character and address. Toots’ sound is grounded in a rural Jamaican sensibility that runs parallel to other sites in the diaspora shaped by similar historical forces: legacies of slavery and colonialism, rural peasantry and urban migration, Afro-Christian approaches to worship, music, and dance. While the son of two preachers from May Pen enjoyed a certain privileged access to Jamaica’s “country soul,” as Charles Hughes might put it, Toots also admired such country-soul brethren as Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, and James Brown, all of whom he names as favorites. We might hear these godfathers of soul, however, less as novel influences Toots sought to emulate than as kindred contemporaries rooted in the same Afro-Christian traditions that encourage the spontaneous expression of sacred experience. In this musical communion, individuals develop distinctive voices that can sing along with others but still be heard as apart, producing an audible texture of integrative, community engagement. Like so many of his American peers and idols, Toots developed his broadly resonant voice in this sacred context, a medium for collective sentiment, drawing on the powers of fervor and faith, falsetto and distortion, ad-libbed interjection, wordless groans, and other sympathetic vibrations. Toots’ original, downhome hymns all have this character, of course, but his ability to be heard as an individual among the broader collective comes into starkest relief on Funky Kingston when he turns to cover songs. On “Louie Louie,” Toots and company bring an old I-IV-V cha-cha-chá back to the Caribbean, crisping up the Kingsmen’s sloppy rock version by re-infusing some of the staccato polyrhythms that initially inspired Richard Berry to rewrite a local hit by L.A.’s biggest Latin band. For his customized version of John Denver’s “Country Roads (Take Me Home),” Toots makes the song his own by resetting it in “West Jamaica,” seasoning with gospel interjections, and making a foreign “country” song seem utterly at home in the Jamaican countryside. Jackie Jackson adds a little oom-pah to his bassline, but otherwise, the band fully transforms the song into an easy-skanking one-drop. For all the nods to soul, funk, rock, and country—references that local audiences would have taken in stride as part of the modern Jamaican soundscape—Funky Kingston nevertheless sounds like an authentic, unadulterated expression of Toots’ and Jamaica’s country soul. With even greater hindsight, the album seems far more prophetic for Jamaica’s lane in the global mainstream than Marley’s exceptional reach. Despite being conceived as a sales pitch, Funky Kingston is, like the best Jamaican crossovers, full of songs geared first and foremost toward Jamaican listeners and local sound systems. From 1980 forward, as roots reggae gave ground to a next-generation style even more locally focused and coded—soon to be known simply as dancehall, after its primary site—the Jamaican artists, from Yellowman to Vybz Kartel, who have enjoyed the warmest embrace abroad have been those who, for all their winking nods to foreign musical kinfolk, insist on pleasing funky Kingston first.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Toots and the Maytals’ 1975 classic, which captured the country soul of roots reggae at its creative peak.

Oasis Nocturno,TOKiMONSTA,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fa3915d64430008c92fa2/1:1/w_160/Oasis%20Nocturno_TOKiMONSTA.jpg,2020-03-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tokimonsta-oasis-nocturno/,TOKiMONSTA MUSIC,"Electronic producer Jennifer Lee, better known as TOKiMONSTA, considers making beats the ultimate form of freedom. As a child learning piano, she resented having to play entire compositions written by someone else, preferring to play her favorite passages over and over—an experience she likens to an early foray into sampling. After teaching herself production in her college dorm room, she joined a community of musicians in L.A. who organized beat battles, a signal to the world that their work was complete without vocalists. It was almost philosophical in nature: While beats are often considered background, Lee and peers like Flying Lotus considered them the main event. But the beat-music world has changed in the past decade, and TOKiMONSTA’s sound has likewise opened up to incorporate sweeping arrangements, pop melodies, dance beats, and, notably, space for vocalists. On her last two albums, she has negotiated the process of making music on her own terms while accommodating an expanding roster of guest features. As she has worked vocals into the mix, she has also embraced more genres. Oasis Nocturno folds funk, rap, and R&B into a shape-shifting blend of styles that recalls Disclosure one moment, and Anderson .Paak the next. She also works extensively with house and house-adjacent beats for the first time, frequently slowing the tempo to a ruminative, heads-down pace. To branch out in so many different directions seems like the ultimate declaration of creative freedom, but it’s not clear that the strategy suits her; the album often feels like it’s on the brink of delving into a groove, only to be pulled in a new direction. And Lee’s beats frequently take a back seat to her guest vocalists’ voices and personalities. TOKiMONSTA’s previous album, Lune Rouge, was held together by an underlying narrative. “Because I’m making beats, it might not be as obvious, but each of these beats—all these songs I put together—tell a story,” Lee said. She had recorded the record in the wake of undergoing surgery for Moyamoya, a rare brain condition; while recovering, she temporarily lost her ability to understand speech or music. It was only after finishing the first song for the album, “I Wish I Could,” that she finally felt like everything was going to be OK. That sense of relief was palpable in the album’s layered vocals and crystalline production. Oasis Nocturno exists in the aftermath of that emotional catharsis. Compared to Lune Rouge, it is darker and more introspective, but it doesn’t have as explicit a narrative attached to it. The album’s song titles—“For My Eternal Love, Dream My Treasure,” “Love That Never,” “To Be Remote”—hint at stories Lee might be trying to tell; combined with the predominantly minor keys and slow, house-inspired grooves, they signal a newfound heaviness. But her frequent stylistic shifts and reliance on guest vocalists give the album a disjointed feel that contradicts her usual immersive sensibility. Lee’s background as a beatmaker is still the guiding force on Oasis Nocturno. The songs are strongest when they are purely instrumental and the production has space to shine, or, as on “Love That Never” and “To Be Remote,” when a human voice is warped and stretched until it becomes another layer of texture. “Up and Out,” a leisurely, house-flavored track, is sleek and soothing, like a handful of marbles. On “House of Dal,” the pulse quickens: A see-sawing beat propels inky keys and twangy synth to delightful, cosmic effect. In contrast, the vocals sound underdeveloped, and it often feels like Lee is holding back in order to make room for them, sacrificing complexity for glossy restraint. The more upbeat or empowering tracks feel out of place amid moody instrumentals. “One Day,” an anthemic self-love pop song, details the exes and doubters that vocalists Bibi Bourelly and Jean Deaux want to prove wrong. But the production—not much beyond a sparse drum beat and light keys—leaves you wondering how Lee’s vision for this otherwise morose and sedated album relates. Rosehardt’s echoey vocals are worked deeper in the mix on “Higher Hopes,” but the watery synth still feels aimless. “Fried for the Night,” a psychedelic party track about “those moments you feel fried and turnt,” is the lone case where the beats elevate the vocals: Atlanta hip-hop duo EARTHGANG’s jubilant, staccato flow and playful imagery (“Cotton candy in my cup/Sour Patches, pucker up”) sparkle over Lee’s warbling synths and rippling trap beats. You leave the album wishing for she had allowed herself to get a little weirder. A few songs are nearly there. Opener “Love That Never” masterfully mixes wavy, distorted vocals through a wash of rain sounds and water droplets, conveying an acute sense of yearning that’s missing from much of the album. The breadth of Oasis Nocturno is commendable, but you can’t help but wonder what these songs would sound like if she had let the grooves, and not her guests, be her guide. As her songs become more encumbered, you can tell that the beatmaker in Lee still longs to break free.","Producer Jennifer Lee’s latest album is darker and more introspective, but the innovative beats frequently take a back seat to her guest vocalists’ voices and personalities.

Calypso,Gigi Masin,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56b157230d040009b1ee99/1:1/w_160/Calypso_Gigi%20Masin.jpg,2020-03-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gigi-masin-calypso/,Apollo,"The Italian composer Gigi Masin’s music has long mirrored his fascination with the natural world. His 1986 debut, a collection of gentle, flowing pieces for piano and synthesizer, was simply called Wind. Many of his subsequent titles have referenced waves, clouds, and insects. In 2014, Music From Memory pulled together an archival collection of his music, with a title that underscored his music’s dialogue with the world around him: Talk to the Sea. His songs are largely wordless, but they nevertheless echo these sorts of images. The melodies are simple and slow-moving, but in a powerful, unpredictable way. There’s a placid joy in tracing the movements of songs like “Clouds,” watching textures and rhythms coalesce and dissolve like ripples on a lake. On his new album Calypso, Masin made his music’s connection to nature even more explicit. In a documentary about its creation, he explains that he retreated from his home in Venice to Gavdos, an island south of Crete that he’d wanted to visit for decades. The small isle has a mythical significance—legend has it that it’s the same island on which Odysseus was imprisoned by Calypso—but Masin was struck by its simple beauty. Being surrounded by sun, sea, and salty air was a way of escaping from the mundanities of life back home. It’s the kind of place, he says, “that regenerates, enlightens, [and] opens your mind.” Calypso echoes the emotional experience of Masin’s respite. At nearly 90 minutes long, it’s a leisurely paced album with a lot of repetition. Each piece is full of slowly sighing synth passages and languorous piano melodies that mimic the strange way time dilates when you remove yourself from the rhythms of the city, the way an afternoon alone at the beach can feel like a beautiful eternity. Masin has said that he’s accepted that his music is a sort of “non-idea.” He approaches the process of making music as intuitive and egoless; he’s more inclined to follow sounds where they lead him rather than dictate where he wants them to go. “This gives me the freedom to not have to make too [many] decisions,” he says. You can sense that approach in the wonderful biodiversity of Calypso. His music has always been varied, especially in the time since he’s returned to more active music-making, after spending most of the ’90s working an office job. Calypso is ambient in a broad sense, but it covers a lot of different moods and sounds. The album opens with a delicate flurry of strings and synthesizers, but it quickly moves into a sleepwalking rhythm that feels like equal parts Portishead and L.A. beat scene on “Bellamore”; the trumpet-draped ambiance of “Nefertiti” recalls Jon Hassell’s mystic experiments. Each of these first three tracks could be worth exploring for an entire record, but Masin moves quickly through each successive style. It continues like this over the course of the record, no song too similar to the last. And yet, because it’s designed to echo the feeling of the island that inspired it, each piece still nevertheless takes place in this beautiful shared universe of sunny synthesizers and delicately purring electronics. If the through line connecting these tracks sometimes becomes hard to follow, that’s probably part of the point. There is a certain pleasure in getting lost in paradise.

Music for Detuned Pianos,Max de Wardener,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fc69e969cde000892959e/1:1/w_160/Detuned%20Pianos_Max%20de%20Wardener.jpg,2020-03-21 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/max-de-wardener-music-for-detuned-pianos/,Village Green,"On Music for Detuned Pianos, the British composer Max de Wardener (best known for his work with Gazelle Twin and Mara Carlyle) shows he is not one to take the easy path. The ten pieces on this wonderfully stubborn album are performed by jazz pianist Kit Downes on acoustic piano, an instrument that is notoriously disinclined to unorthodox tuning. The painstaking process resulted in two years of technical challenges and constant re-tuning. De Wardener used four different types of detuned pianos, each detuning inspired by a different American composer, alongside those tuned to the conventional, equal-tempered scale. On two album highlights—“Doppelgänger” and “Deranged Landscape”— de Wardener tuned the same piano twice, in slightly different ways, then overlaid the recordings, emphasizing the music’s otherworldly feel. De Wardener later added a sprinkling of electronics—the synth washes on “Redshift,” the shade of distortion on “Color Cry”—to give body to the work without overwhelming the acoustic ambience. Perhaps the best compliment you can pay this hauntingly elegant record is that it never feels like the product of back-breaking toil. After laborious preparation, many of the pieces themselves were recorded in single solo takes, with de Wardener leaving the piano space to weave its unfussy melodies in a way that is reminiscent of Erik Satie’s deathless Gymnopédies. There’s something enchantingly dreamlike about Music for Detuned Pianos, as if the music has been nudged from reality rather than torn from the here and now. “Blueshift,” for example, starts with a jaunty, nautical piano motif which slowly sags out of tune like vinyl left in the sun. The shadow of Richard D. James hangs heavily over this album. Songs like “Foxtrot” and “Deranged Landscape” suggest the itchy horrors of Selected Ambient Works 2 rendered in echoing acoustics, the physical reality of the piano reinforcing the nature of the unease. “Bismuth Dream,” meanwhile, shares an air of unsettling melancholia with Aphex’s most straightforwardly beautiful piano piece, “Avril 14th.” At times—notably the slightly dull opening halves of “Spell” and “Star Song”—Music for Detuned Pianos sails too close to convention. But the album partly draws its weight from these oppositions: Music for Detuned Pianos is classical but experimental; relaxing but unnerving; background music that demands your attention. In leaving these discrepancies unresolved, de Wardener and Downes have created an album of immediate impact and lasting emotional depth, a pleasing mess of contradictions that is as beautiful as it is misshapen.","The British composer works with multiple detuned pianos on this hauntingly elegant record of dreamlike miniatures.

Mixing Colours,Roger EnoBrian Eno,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fb3b85d64430008c92fa3/1:1/w_160/Mixing%20Colours_Roger%20Brian%20Eno.jpg,2020-03-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roger-eno-brian-eno-mixing-colours/,Deutsche Grammophon,"Given Brian Eno’s experimental bona fides, there’s something uncharacteristically low-key, and even rather sweet, about this collaboration with his younger brother. Roger Eno, a well-known pianist in his own right, calls it “a back-and-forth conversation,” one that goes back 15 years: He would record musical sketches on his MIDI keyboard, then pass them on to Brian to manipulate. Yet you wonder if the album should have stayed within the family. Mixing Colours won’t harm the Enos’ elevated reputations, but it won’t enhance them, either. The album’s main problem: an unmistakable blandness that is at odds with the audacity of so much of Brian Eno’s catalog. Mixing Colours couldn’t have been made in the 1970s, when Brian Eno debuted his landmark ambient recordings; MIDI was first released in 1983, after all. But it sounds like it could have been, raising inevitable and ultimately unfavorable comparisons to Eno’s classic work. Ambient 1: Music for Airports was revolutionary in concept, offering music that was “as ignorable as it is interesting” in a way that defied 20th century popular music’s constant demands on our attention. But Mixing Colours is too often just ignorable: pretty, safe, and eminently forgettable. For all Brian Eno’s claims about Mixing Colours’ sonic palette—he has talked about using electronics to explore the spaces between the “islands” of classical instruments—the album’s musical texture is underwhelming, a world of wipe-clean surfaces and expensive echo that resembles a particularly laconic Air B-side. Most of the 18 songs rely on glowing synth patterns and treated piano, a mixture so subtly inviting you can almost forgive its bromidic surface. It doesn’t help that Mixing Colours begs comparison to Brian and Roger’s collaborative work on 1983’s Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, whose idiosyncratic character benefited from the metallic dash of steel guitar that Daniel Lanois added to tracks like “Deep Blue Day.” “Quicksilver,” in particular, seems to sport a hole where Lanois’ melodic edge should be. With stylistic and atmospheric surprises in short supply, Mixing Colours relies on melody to do the heavy lifting. There are some beautiful moments: The second half of “Celeste” has a gorgeous, rolling refrain that topples about like a boat in the breeze, its movements reminiscent of Pep Llopis’ Mediterranean classic Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes. “Desert Sand” is wonderful too, an unsettling piano figure introducing a feathery touch of dissonance, while “Obsidian” has the solemn, slightly pompous melancholy of the best church-organ music. At times like these, Mixing Colours merits its place on respected classical label Deutsche Grammophon. But on the whole, the album is too inoffensive to leave much lasting impression. Over 18 songs, its initially appealing tastefulness becomes cloying and monotonous. Instead of the dynamism of mixing colors, the album mostly yields just a uniform pastel wash.","The ambient icon and his younger brother, a well-known pianist in his own right, reveal the results of an intimate musical conversation stretching back 15 years.

LUV vs. The World 2,Lil Uzi Vert,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e70f09b690af00008f8041b/1:1/w_160/Eternal%20Atake%20(Deluxe)_Lil%20Uzi%20Vert.jpg,2020-03-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-uzi-vert-luv-vs-the-world-2/,Generation NowAtlantic,"It would have been crazy to expect more of Lil Uzi Vert after Eternal Atake. Uzi’s long-awaited third album didn’t just deliver an hour of new music, it felt like the best possible record he could have made, a dizzying showcase for his technique, charisma, and style. And yet, one week later, he’s already returned with Eternal Atake (Deluxe)—LUV vs. The World 2, which gives us 14 new tracks and more than 40 additional minutes from the endless Atake sessions. Despite its length and billing as the sequel to Uzi’s breakout 2016 mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World, the album hews to the standard “deluxe edition” blueprint: This is a cobbled-together collection of B-sides—good ones, but B-sides nonetheless. In many cases, it’s clear why these songs didn’t make the cut. That said, the high points are as thrilling as you’d expect from an artist who just hit his peak. LUV vs. The World 2’s crown jewel is “Bean (Kobe),” a Chief Keef collaboration that already enjoys legendary status in fan circles. The two rappers have been teasing the track on social media since 2017, and with good reason: the woozy song zeroes in on the sweet spot between Keef’s hard-charging flows and Uzi’s  impressionistic yelps. Over a Pi’erre Bourne instrumental whose smeared synths recall the producer’s work with Playboi Carti, the rappers stretch out: Uzi makes a Tony! Toni! Toné! joke while Keef uses the Swahili word for “blood.” The chorus is just Uzi breathlessly shouting the names of high-end Swiss watch brands over and over. It sounds incredible. There are a few other songs on LUV vs. The World 2 that approach this level, even if they are lesser executions of Eternal Atake ideas. “Lotus” resembles a transmission from a distant planet thanks to an Oogie Mane beat that sounds programmed on a haunted Game Boy. Uzi flexes the exhilarating acrobatic flows of Atake’s first half on “Myron.” And on the bubbly-trap rave of “Got the Guap,” Young Thug and Uzi melt their voices  into a delightfully gooey mess (we also get to hear Thug rap, “I put a fish on the wrist”). Uzi has always been a chameleon, but hearing him go toe-to-toe with rap’s most flamboyant stylist underscores just how versatile he’s become. Unfortunately, some of LUV vs. The World 2’s collaborations sounded better on paper. “Wassup” features a perfectly competent verse from Future in full HNDRXX crooner mode, but Uzi’s chorus feels unfinished and inert. Despite a surreal title and the combined efforts of Uzi, Young Thug, and Gunna, “Strawberry Peels” never gets off the ground. Uzi manages to elevate Nav’s soulless flexing on “Leaders,” but the song still feels like the result of Nav calling in a favor, not the other way around. The solo tracks that fill the record’s midsection—“Moon Relate,” “Come This Way”—feel half-baked. Still, even when the songs don’t click, you can’t help but marvel at all the expensive materials littering the cutting-room floor. Most rappers would kill for these features, or these producers. But Lil Uzi Vert isn’t most rappers. Eternal Atake maintains its momentum with just a single feature and a set of instrumentals that were largely sourced from one production collective; It’s the rare hour-long record that feels like the product of focus and restraint. The songs here reveal the very different record that Atake could have been: a label-friendly, guest-filled grab bag that probably still would have done massive numbers on streaming. Even if it isn’t equal in quality to Eternal Atake, LUV vs. The World 2 speaks to the strength of Uzi’s vision all the same: sometimes, what you take out is as important as what you leave in.","The Philly rapper’s Eternal Atake victory lap feels like a collection of outtakes, but the high points are thrilling.

Heartbreak Weather,Niall Horan,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6f99e581d1d3000863d87a/1:1/w_160/Heartbreak%20Weather_Niall%20Horan.jpg,2020-03-20 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/niall-horan-heartbreak-weather/,Capitol,"In 2010, a wee Niall Horan decided to test his vocal prowess by auditioning for the British singing competition The X Factor. After performing a neutered rendition of Ne-Yo’s “So Sick,” the 16-year-old Irishman was met with skepticism from guest judge Katy Perry, who sagely warned, “Likeableness is not gonna sell records.” Nevertheless, she let him advance and Horan was placed in the group One Direction alongside four other baby-faced fellows. As 1D became the biggest pop group in the world, it was apparent that likability (alongside teenage sex appeal, many genuinely good bops, and a rapidly obsessive fanbase) actually sells a lot of records. After One Direction announced an indefinite hiatus in 2015, Horan spun his role as the band’s guitar-playing Nice Guy into a pleasant-enough solo career. Three years after his folk-pop debut, Flicker, Horan’s biggest challenge as an artist is to harness his ordinariness into being an exceptional everyman à la Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi. So for his second record, the golf-loving, Eagles-obsessed wannabe boomer turned to a loose-concept album that explores every angle of a breakup through the most pitiful of conversation starters: the weather. Parting clouds, rising suns, cinematic rainstorms, Heartbreak Weather has everything, except soul. It’s quite a let down from the promise of Heartbreak Weather’s lead single, “Nice to Meet Ya.” Borrowing some strained swagger from former bandmate Liam Payne, Horan entices an elusive would-be lover over a dancey British alt-rock vibe. While the track employs some heavy-handed horniness—“I’m gonna take you somewhere warm, you know J’adore la mer,” Horan purrs because French makes everything sexier, oui?—it’s an easy guilty pleasure that is as charming as it is uncool. Unfortunately, the rest of the record never recaptures this little spark. On the title track, Horan posits that love has a magical, transformational power that can shift the cosmos and make lonely boys feel complete. He follows this disclosure with “Black and White,” a soaring declaration of eternal devotion. “I promise that I’ll love you for the rest of my life,” Horan belts, in between weepy visions of their wedding day and homely golden years. It’s difficult to feel moved by the stakes of these grandiose statements because their meanings are so cliché, and not in the way that feels refreshingly familiar. After these blasts of sunshine, storm clouds gather. Across the rest of Heartbreak Weather, Horan is stuck in two mindsets: bereft or coltish, either haunted by the memory of a lover, or desperately trying to scrub her away. There’s no explanation for why the relationship worthy of celestial exaltation dissipates other than that the music starts to move from generic anthems into a confusing mix of bleeding-heart ballads and Fleetwood Mac-indebted pop-rock. As on Flicker, Horan is a co-writer on every song and he is joined by Teddy Geiger, Tobias Jesso Jr., Greg Kurstin, Scott Harris, and 1D regular Julian Bunetta. Horan’s songwriting seemingly works only in unwavering extremes. When he’s blue, like on the painfully maudlin “Dear Patience” or the piano-driven breakup ballad “Put a Little Love on Me,” it’s as if the sky is falling. When he’s hurt by a lover, as on “Bend the Rules” he is the picture of gentlemanly restraint. “I pour myself a glass, it won’t be the last/Just our medicine for now,” he forlornly rumbles. (Confusingly, Horan has referred to this song as his “Streets of Philadelphia” moment, a song written in response to the AIDS epidemic.) When he’s frisky, as in say, “Small Talk,” he invokes feral wolves and roaring flames. Over and over again, he goes through the motions without ever really looking inward. In an interview with Apple Music, Horan said that despite his intention to cover a variety of perspectives, the songs will “probably still sound selfish.” It’s not exactly that Heartbreak Weather is selfish—Horan sounds too adrift for true narcissism—but it’s superficial. The women in his songs are painfully one-dimensional. Rather than defining them at all, Horan and his songwriters reduce them into faceless placeholders tasked with helping the singer move on. On the boogie-down track “New Angel,” a forsaken Horan craves a distraction from his lovesick psyche. “I need a new angel/A touch of someone else to save me from myself,” he croons, “....I’m hoping you get her out of my mind.” Horan repeatedly writes himself into similar emotional pickles, finding solace in the arms of a stranger while fixated with someone else. It’s a valid post-breakup experience, but it simultaneously limits the already narrow role women have on the record. After all the sentimental rigamarole, it’s tough to come away from Heartbreak Weather feeling any closer to Horan. He spends too much of the record bouncing between sounds and songwriting concepts to feel distinct. But on the record’s closer, the acoustic ballad “Still,” Horan sounds like he genuinely wants, or even needs an emotional reckoning. It’s the realest, rawest moment on the record and a small bit of proof that Horan has the potential to make it on his own.","For his catchy but charmless second solo album, the pop singer offers a loose-concept record that explores every angle of a breakup through the most pitiful of conversation starters: the weather.

A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling EP,Magdalena Bay,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fa52f4b101700083a93c2/1:1/w_160/A%20Little%20Rhythm_Magdalena%20Bay.jpg,2020-03-20 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/magdalena-bay-a-little-rhythm-and-a-wicked-feeling-ep/,Luminelle,"Magdalena Bay take pity on bubblegum. From their L.A. apartment, bandmates Mica Tenenbaum and Matt Lewin create the kind of pop songs that, at first pass, appear destined for radios and stadium tours the world over. As influences, they cite not only Gwen Stefani and Britney Spears, but celebrity pop songwriter Julia Michaels and the elaborate, pop-inspired production of Grimes’ Art Angels. Over the past three years, they’ve released a string of EPs and singles that embrace the bratty, shimmery sound of ’00s pop radio hits. On their latest EP, A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling, the band’s DIY approach culminates in their most confident project to date, a sensitive sort of bombastic pop that wants you to be sensitive, too. As bass-heavy as Charli XCX and as melodically minded as Carly Rae Jepsen, these songs are not unlike the hyperactive computer pop popularized by PC Music. What sets Magdalena Bay apart is the gentleness of their lyrics and spacious, mood-building production. “Airplane,” the EP’s balmiest moment, is about the pressure of the rat race: the craving for a hectic work week, the urge to “[bend] over backwards” as your “heart breaks.” Tenenbaum tries to detach, reassuring herself that “I’m breathing, I’m feeding my soul.” Such a sincere, thoughtful sentiment seems almost misplaced against the song’s irreverent synth fireworks, but the result is endearingly camp—the playful, theatrical sensibility that serves as a vehicle for genuine sensitivity. In the words of Susan Sontag, “Camp is a tender feeling.” Of course, the duo’s source material is more ostentatious: Their favorite eras of ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s pop were defined by incandescent production and ridiculously earnest style choices. Magdalena Bay’s self-conscious, homegrown approach is less interested in imitating bubblegum pop than pushing the limits of its meaning. “How to Get Physical” calls back to Olivia Newton-John’s legendary ’80s banger, which Dua Lipa also mined for her recent single “Physical.” But where those songs demanded that we “get physical,” Tenenbaum is more coy, wondering “how to get physical when you’re not made for dancing.” The track itself is sugary and ecstatic, like diving into a vat of fruit punch—you can hear the liquid sloshing as she sings about “cheap wine taking over me.” It’s that pairing of campiness with attention to detail that prevents these songs from sounding like flat emulations of No Doubt circa 2002. A Little Rhythm’s slick vocal hooks, glimmering synths, and final crescendos are the same tools Top 40 pop writers use to craft a hit—and the same conceits PC Music and its ilk aim to subvert—but here they’re used to different effect. “I feel your breathing in my bedroom when I’m by myself,” Tenenbaum murmurs on “Oh Hell,” against a backdrop of hovering synth and sticky 808 kicks. The lazy tempo, glittery flourishes, and washed-out, doubled vocals aren’t the stuff of mainstream radio. Magdalena Bay aren’t performing a simple genre flip, or attempting to appeal to the masses; they’re building something personal and seeing how big it can get. Rather than obscuring emotion, their manufactured sound invokes its own kind of nostalgic joy. A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling is a reminder that exaggeration or artificiality don’t have to mean soullessness; pop music is supposed to be a loud, flashy monument to earnest, embarrassing emotion. Listen to it shamelessly, euphorically, with love in your heart.","Citing Gwen Stefani and Grimes as influences, the L.A. duo’s heartfelt take on bubblegum is a sensitive sort of bombastic pop that wants you to be sensitive, too.

Ricky Music,Porches,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e601b1e40430a0008960679/1:1/w_160/Porches_Ricky_Music_album_art.jpg,2020-03-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/porches-ricky-music/,Domino,"Aaron Maine’s debut as Porches, 2013’s Slow Dance in the Cosmos, was perfect if you were young and falling in love for the first time. The album was an indie-rock dream sequence where Maine imagined himself kissing his best friends and going down on his girlfriend before she headed off to therapy. It was funny, earnest, and sweet; it felt like the start of a promising career helmed by a doe-eyed musician who knew a thing or two about writing scrappy rock songs. Porches’ latest, Ricky Music, is in some ways a return to those early days, albeit not through the lens of indie rock. Dealing largely with the idea of being in love at the very end of a relationship, the record is the most human piece of music Maine has released in years. He’s also never sounded so lost. The hardest part of ending things with someone is never the actual breakup. It’s what follows: Your bed suddenly feels too big, and you no longer have someone to blow off work and drink cheap beer on the roof with. This is the universe that Ricky Music evokes. As though meant to capture that sense of a world suddenly made strange, Maine’s arrangements here are his riskiest to date. He dabbles in Auto-Tune, turning his mopey tenor into something more chromatic, and he fleshes out his synths and drum machines with jarring patches of dissonance. At their best, 2016’s Pool and 2018’s The House were dance records; at their worst, they felt anonymous. Ricky Music is more diaristic, like it was written alone and in the dead of night. It’s also more ambitious, not sticking to any specific sound or mood. It dabbles in ballads, slap bass, house beats, and new-wave synths and guitars. But in reinventing himself as a songwriter, Maine hasn’t really fleshed out what he wants to say or what he wants to sound like. Opener “Patience” reads like a letter you write to an ex but then toss before putting in the mail. “I don’t think anything is fine/But I want you to know/I’ve been thinking about you now,” he bleats, heaping on the feelings. Lynchian synths balloon in the background, and Maine hides behind a layer of gauzy Auto-Tune and disorienting tempo changes. “Lipstick Song” feels equally monotonous. Maine looks back on the early days of his relationship. “Thought of you and your friends/Thought of the apartment/Thought of the make-up kit,” he sings, taking mental inventory of how things felt before it all went bad. It’s an evocative line that is washed out by its scenery. Sluggish and repetitive, the song’s chintzy bassline weighs down Maine’s vocals. That glacial pace characterizes the whole album: Its 26 minutes feel twice that. And where Maine aims for melodrama, too often the effect comes off as merely humdrum. Ricky Music borders on voyeuristic, like peeking into someone’s notebook and finding endless doodling in place of emotional revelation. “Hair” might be the album’s most straight-up beautiful moment, but the lyrics—“Loosen up/You’re always so fucking high-strung/Can you take me back”—are at odds with the sweetness of the melody. The only time Maine manages to rouse himself from his funk is “Madonna,” which dazzles like a night out on the town. Mitski sings hushed backing vocals, and synthesizers fan out like a royal flush. It’s too bad the rest of the record can’t match its energy. Still, even as a series of sketches and fragments, Ricky Music captures the essence of a breakup album. As he sings in “PFB,” “It’s looking bad/It’s looking bad/It’s looking pretty fucking bad.” After “Madonna,” it’s the album’s most upbeat song, and it cuts off after just 33 seconds. As anyone who has endured a broken heart can attest, sometimes there’s nothing else to be said.","On his latest record, Aaron Maine explores the feelings of confusion and numbness that follow the end of a relationship. It’s an ambitious record that can get a little lost in itself.

Sister,Ultraísta,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6f9edc10d14c0008e231ea/1:1/w_160/Sister_Ultrai%CC%81sta.jpg,2020-03-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ultraista-sister/,Partisan,"The second album from the experimental rock trio—producer emeritus Nigel Godrich, veteran drummer Joey Waronker, and singer Laura Bettinson—is mostly immaculate electronica. Listening to Ultraísta is like plunging underwater: a swift blast of relief, followed a need to get orientated. The vocals are muffled; the instruments gleam through burbled layers. This is music to swirl and splash around in, but it doesn’t leave you with much to remember when you come up for air. This may be, at least partly, because Ultraísta feel less like a holistic group with a distinct identity or purpose and more like a few extremely talented musicians messing around. The band came together through a shared love of Afrobeats, electronica, and art, piecing the album together from improvised sessions over the years that Godrich sculpted into songs. Eight years after their self-titled debut, the result is once again lovely-sounding, but a pristine blankness permeates the record. “Water in My Veins” teems with stretched-out synths and immersive lopped vocals and ends with the blare of the outside world—cars honking, the muted purr of engines, footsteps, like the song has scooped you from the street and deposited you back where you are standing. Ultraísta intend to transport you, but the world it creates is too easily punctured by weak lyrics. There is no narrative or structure to Sister’s writing, and Bettinson’s monotone doesn’t offer any clues as to what each song might be about. Are we meant to feel pensive while listening to her chant, “Be young, be hungry, be wiser” in “Mariella”? “If you wanna go, please don’t stay,” she croons over violins on “Anybody,” another statement tossed out for the sake of texture. “Lift me off the ground, so I can see/The twenty-first century,” she intones on closer “The Moon and Mercury.” The album’s production tends towards controlled distortion—blurred synths, twinkling mashes of drum and piano and violin—and the lyrics could be a foothold in all the intricate chaos. Instead, they just further confuse, or land as bleary platitudes to fill the space. For a project born out of improvisation, the record mostly stays within the boundaries it creates for itself. Even the most complicated drum patterns never devolve into anything frantic or surprising; the added layered vocals are too faint to become panoramic. These are tightly-wound songs that highlight the band member’s obvious gifts. Sister is never anything less than adroit, but it’s also never anything more.","The second album from producer Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker, and singer Laura Bettinson is immaculately composed electronica that never really leaves a strong impression.

Rainbow Doll,Joey Anderson,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fc9f54b101700083a93cc/1:1/w_160/Rainbow%20Doll_Joey%20Anderson.jpg,2020-03-19 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joey-anderson-rainbow-doll/,Acid TestAvenue 66,"Joey Anderson hails from New Jersey, but there’s always been something a bit alien about his house and techno creations. He's got a unique rhythmic sensibility—likely stemming, at least in part, from his background in the club scene as a house dancer—and his tracks often veer from dance music’s typical linear structures; they might start on an off beat, or embrace an unusually contemplative mood. Even those descriptors fail to capture the full complexity of Anderson’s singular production style, which is inherently soulful, but also dark, psychedelic, and a bit unsettling. Rainbow Doll, his third full-length, heads further down the proverbial rabbit hole. His work has always felt deeply personal, but the new album is the first to extensively feature Anderson’s own voice, which sounds nothing like the buttery crooning that often populates house music. The vocals recall someone like South African artist Portable, but Anderson’s pipes, while similarly affecting, are thinner and less polished. He’s more Robert Smith than Robert Owens, and much of his singing on Rainbow Doll resembles the gloomy goth and post-punk of the 1980s. “Beside Me” is one of the LP’s most prominent vocal cuts, a standout in which Anderson plaintively moans, “You’re always there/Beside me” amid galloping percussion and crystalline synth tones. It’s not a club track per se, but with its sci-fi undertones, it suggests David Bowie working with the sound palette of Chicago house. Anderson goes even bigger on the propulsive “Cindy,” which simultaneously feels like a string-saturated lover’s lament and a trippy, synth-soundtracked vision quest. Weirder still is “Live It,” where a dubby vocal snippet and funk-punk bassline calls back to the avant-garde, post-disco sound of early ’80s outfit Liquid Liquid. “Heaven Help Us” pulls from the same era, but this song—one of Rainbow Doll’s few instrumentals—references the hypnotic guitar loops and Krautrock chug of Manuel Göttsching’s influential E2-E4. An obvious highlight, it’s likely the first time one of his productions could be called twangy, and Anderson’s addition of warm pads gives the track a loosely Balearic sheen. Rainbow Doll does have a couple more straightforward dancefloor offerings. With clacking drums, a sturdy bassline, and tweaky acid blips, “Bounce With It” feels like an update on the classic Trax formula, and the sparkling melodies and jaunty rhythm of “Can Not” close the LP on a loose, lively note. Both would likely be effective club tools, but in the context of the album, they’re somewhat forgettable. Although Anderson has had a few breakout club tunes over the years—songs like “Press Play” and “Above the Cherry Moon”—none could be described as massive anthems. His music has never been overly concerned with hands-in-the-air revelry, as his tracks tend to be thoughtful, introspective, even a little sad. One gets the impression that he’s more concerned with excavating the inner recesses of the mind than triggering sensory overload. With Rainbow Doll, Anderson digs deeper than ever before.","The New Jersey producer’s third album is the first to extensively feature his own voice, which sounds nothing like the buttery crooning that often populates house music.

Heaven or Hell,Don Toliver,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6fa0935d64430008c92fa0/1:1/w_160/Heaven%20or%20Hell_Don%20Toliver.jpg,2020-03-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/don-toliver-heaven-or-hell/,Cactus JackAtlantic,"After becoming a fixture with Houston strip club and radio DJs, melodic Texas rapper Don Toliver was invited to a glass mansion on the water in Hawaii by Travis Scott. Together, the two made “Can’t Say,” a track on the back half of Astroworld that was Toliver’s breakout moment. Astroworld had something for everyone: Drake rapping about falling asleep after popping half a Xanax, Travis crooning over Tame Impala, a detour into the druggy haze of The Weeknd, Stevie Wonder harmonica lines. But Don Toliver pierced through the superstar glitz with his unique voice, which resembled a soulful robot. Nearly two years later, Don Toliver is still inseparable from Travis Scott. He signed to Scott’s Cactus Jack imprint, but outside of appearances on the group album JACKBOYS and snippets passed around by those who have yet to miss a Travis merch bundle, he didn’t release much music. Toliver’s debut album, Heaven or Hell, is his first real follow-up to his Astroworld moment, but most importantly, it’s an attempt to stand on his own. Unfortunately, listening to Heaven or Hell is like watching a younger brother mimic their older brother. Toliver’s album has all the makings of a typical Travis Scott project. It features the producers who precision-tooled his arena-ready sound (Wondagurl, Frank Dukes, and TM88), the unmistakable Mike Dean synthesizers, mailed-in guest verses from sundry Migos, and melody-heavy rap songs that can seamlessly blend into any playlist. It even has most of the same flaws: tracks like “After Party” come with verses that exist solely to fill time until the chorus. “Okay, I pull up, hop at the after party/You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty,” sings Don on the hook. It works just fine, and you can imagine it playing anywhere—a Soho boutique, a Jenner Instagram story, a Rolling Loud set—but it’s hard to forget that it’s simply Don Toliver in Scott’s spot. There’s a handful of good moments, all of which could have been reference tracks Travis passed on. “Cardigan” blends a perfectly crafted chorus with lush production; there’s a reason why fans were crying out for it after its YouTube snippet. Written out, some of Don Toliver’s hooks look like satire, “Don’t wa-wa-waste it/Don’t wa-wa-waste it,” he croons on “Wasted.” But over the grim Cássio production, reminiscent of an early Metro Boomin beat, it’s irresistible. And Don Toliver can sing; he’s spoken about the influence of R&B artists like Bobby Womack, and his 2018 mixtape was called Donny Womack. Though he rarely gets the chance to explore his emotional side, the stripped-down and soulful “Company” is the closest Don Toliver gets to staking out a style of his own. Still, we never learn anything about Don Toliver, or why we might be listening to him. On “Candy,” he sounds lost in the production, and it’s hard not to imagine that the song would have been better as an instrumental. There are no hints of his personality, his musical taste, his daily life. Does he just wake up, go to the club, stand behind the DJ, drink too much, go home, and repeat it the next day? It’s disappointing, because it’s clear that while there might be more to Don Toliver than this, for now he seems comfortable existing in Travis Scott’s shadow.","The melodic Texas rapper attempts to step out of Travis Scott's shadow with a debut that mimics Scott at every turn.

Sixteen Oceans,Four Tet,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bc2a67fdf86000850e29a/1:1/w_160/Sixteen%20Oceans_Four%20Tet.jpg,2020-03-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/four-tet-sixteen-oceans/,Text,"For two decades, Four Tet has stayed remarkably consistent. It’s hard to think of another electronic musician whose work feels so tactile: Sampling acoustic instruments from folk and jazz recordings, his music revels in the physicality of sound—the way a plucked string quivers in the air or a drum brush tickles a snare head. His touch is unmistakable, and while Sixteen Oceans is frequently gorgeous and sometimes gripping, there are signs he’s starting to repeat himself. Until now, Kieran Hebden has kept his music fresh by subtly tweaking his formula. Ten years ago, with There Is Love in You, he began channeling the energy of clubs like London’s Plastic People, a basement joint where dubstep and house were spawning mutant forms. With Pink and Beautiful Rewind, he pushed deeper into the dance floor, teasing the balance between his own vision and dance music’s collective spirit. Morning/Evening’s pair of hypnotic, 20-minute tracks took an extended detour into Indian devotional music and film soundtracks, and 2017’s New Energy synthesized all of his interests, looping back to the slow-motion bliss of his early work on songs like “Two Thousand and Seventeen” and reasserting his peak-time bona fides on floor-fillers like “SW9 9SL.” In sound and spirit, Sixteen Oceans feels like a companion to New Energy, a mix of club-ready barnstormers and downbeat daydreams, held together by field-recorded miniatures and ambient etudes. Four Tet shares a palette of muffled rimshots and flashing hi-hats with his occasional collaborator Burial, and his more forceful beats remain charged with the snap and swing of 2-step. Slower tracks, like “Teenage Birdsong” and “Romantics,” fall back on spaced-out hip-hop grooves. Regardless of tempo, they all share the same basic elements: acoustic instruments (harp, flute, bells, and harpsichord) interwoven with dreamy synthesizers that curl like wisps of colored smoke. The predominance of birdsong gives the album the feel of a stroll through an aviary; when there are voices, they are invariably wordless, pitch-shifted, and just this side of melancholy. Everything feels calibrated for a certain Goldilocks zone of wistful reverie—not too heavy, not too light, neither forlorn nor jubilant. Sixteen Oceans is best when Hebden disturbs the placid surface. “Insect Near Piha Beach” bumps along atop the sort of choppy drum groove that Hebden can write in his sleep, but its cascading pentatonic scales pile up in a way that sounds new, pouring down accelerating and decelerating runs in a way that threatens to overwhelm the rhythmic grid. “Love Salad” is virtually the platonic ideal of a Four Tet song, but as it gathers force, it begins to spill over into exciting dissonance. But “School” and Something in the Sadness,” which are virtually identical—same key, instrumentation, same tempo, practically the same beat—somehow never manage to spark the same sort of rapture. They tap out at “beautiful” rather than tipping over into the ecstatic. Sixteen Oceans is 16 tracks long, yet five of them are basically interludes—minute-or-two-long sketches made of watery synth pads, tape hiss, or rudimentary beats. Strangely, most of them fall toward the end of the album. In fact, after “Something in the Sadness,” the record’s driving climax, the album’s final six tracks all zigzag between marginally differentiated pastel dream states. From titles like “1993 Band Practice,” “Bubbles at Overlook 25th March 2019,” and “Mama Teaches Sanskrit,” one gets the sense that many of these pieces have personal meaning for Hebden, but these blurry snapshots don’t impart much more than a feeling of bittersweet serenity. Were they threaded more evenly through the album, they might serve as a kind of mood-stabilizing connective tissue between the more upfront songs; as it is, they feel mostly like an extended denouement, a slow drift into the doldrums. The same could be said for Sixteen Oceans as a whole: The view’s lovely, but for the moment, it feels like Hebden is sailing in circles.","Kieran Hebden’s latest album of club-ready barnstormers and downbeat daydreams feels like a companion to 2017’s New Energy.

Origens Da Luz,Priscilla Ermel,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6f9c46969cde0008929594/1:1/w_160/Origens%20Da%20Luz_Priscilla%20Ermel.jpg,2020-03-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/priscilla-ermel-origens-da-luz/,Music From Memory,"Even the most committed students of Brazilian music might not have been familiar with the work of composer Priscilla Ermel until 2017. That was when Music From Memory released Outro Tempo: Electronic and Contemporary Music From Brazil, 1978-1992, introducing a number of obscure Brazilian artists who were making music at the tail end of the country’s military regime. Ermel described that era as not just “another time” but “another tempo,” inspiring compiler John Gómez to title the anthology after her phrase. Ermel has called recordings from that period “portals through which stories, people, and cultures can be revealed.” It’s an apt metaphor for the uncanny soundworlds glimpsed in Origens Da Luz, a crucial compendium of Ermel’s singular work, drawn from the four albums she released between 1986 and 1992. Born and raised in São Paulo, Ermel, who studied cello and guitar, was reared on Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and bossa-nova master Tom Jobim, and both sensibilities filter down to her own music. Just as crucially, while researching for her master’s thesis, Ermel traveled to the Amazon rainforest to study the songs of the indigenous Cinta-Larga and Ikolem Gavião people, for whom music is inextricable from storytelling. A similar sensibility runs through Ermel’s astonishingly layered work, whose arrangements unfurl more like short stories than pop songs. “Luar,” which opens the compilation, begins with the sounds of birds and chirping insects, situating us in a twilit landscape. Ermel’s strong, clear voice crests at the midway point, and as she falls silent, her guitar and melodica are rejoined by the sounds of the rainforest. Those chirps and calls are present in many of the songs, turning any negative space in the music into an open window—as though to suggest that the natural world is ever-present, and one need only become silent to become aware of it. Even when she isn’t directly incorporating the ambient chatter of the wilderness, the rattles and bamboo flutes that Ermel deploys emulate natural sounds; on the title track, so does her own wordless voice, whose squawks, howls, and purrs sound almost primal. It often seems as if Ermel is striving for an equilibrium between her own music and the beautiful, chaotic density of the rainforest. But even in the absence of field recordings, her songs are strongly evocative of a sense of place—even if no such land exists anywhere but in her own music. “Meditação,” featuring her gorgeous cello, piano, and acoustic guitar, starts off like an English folk ballad before wandering further afield, while “Campo De Sonhos” conjures two worlds at once: The synth line moves like Indonesian court music while the cello is worthy of a modern classical recital. An elegant braiding of piano and keyboards, “Cristal De Fogo” toggles between smooth new age and soap-opera soundtrack. The gem of the original Outro Tempo, the masterwork “Corpo Do Vento” is also the highlight of Origens Da Luz. Translated as “Body of the Wind,” it remains the finest amalgam of Ermel’s classical upbringing and ethnographic studies. Atop bombo and cultrun drums, Ermel adds ocarina, Chilean chirimia, and Nepalese flute; after letting the piece build for five minutes, she introduces piano and viola caipira, a Brazilian 10-string guitar, playing themes redolent of modern classical composition. By the third act, the hand drums and woodwinds return, quickening to a ritualistic climax. It feels like a condensation of the Brazilian composer’s own story into 16 spell-binding minutes—and a portal to another world.","Following Music From Memory’s Outro Tempo, a collection of Brazilian obscurities, the label turns the spotlight on a forgotten composer who fused cello and guitar with the sounds of the rainforest.

Put the Shine On,CocoRosie,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bf877690af00008f803fe/1:1/w_160/Shine_CocoRosie.jpg,2020-03-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cocorosie-put-the-shine-on/,Marathon Artists,"For most of their 16-year tenure as CocoRosie, sisters Bianca and Sierra Casady have tried to untangle the complicated childhood history they share. Born in Iowa and Hawaii to a compulsively nomadic couple, they spent many of their early summers on Native reservations while their parents sat in on peyote circles. After a decade of estrangement, the sisters reunited as young adults in France, and began ruminating on their unusual family memories via a singular mix of twisted freak-folk and lo-fi hip-hop. Their catalog touts moments of sublime melody and atmosphere amid a lot of questionable artistic choices. Put the Shine On, their seventh album and first in five years, marks a return to CocoRosie’s more maximalist tendencies after a period of sparer work, piling on drum machines, chintzy synthesizers, over-the-top raps, and nu-metal guitars. The Casady sisters recorded much of Put the Shine On in San Francisco, working on the record between visits to their mother, who died 11 days after she tracked backing vocals for “Ruby Red,” a song about her own life and death. Despite its closeness to mortality, “Ruby Red” is more a celebration of life than a dirge. But that complicated tone—praising a parent newly passed as you survey how they’ve made you who you are—gets blunted in the record’s production. Stock hip-hop beats and clumsy synth bass take up outsize space in the mix, dominating the sound with rhythmic elements to which the sisters’ vocals never quite adhere. Generational trauma, mental illness, and sexual violence tumble through Shine’s lyrics, as they have on past CocoRosie albums, but the language used to approach these weighty themes tends towards the archetypal rather than the specific. Little girls sprint through the woods avoiding men and wolves; Biblical symbols of lamb and sheep populate multiple songs. When the images aren’t tired, they’re baffling. CocoRosie use “Britney Spears” as a verb on two different tracks, with little clarity about which aspect of that complicated figure they mean to deploy. Bianca and Sierra’s voices, whose tight harmonies and curdled edges comprised the most striking aspect of earlier CocoRosie records, tend to get lost in the surfeit of production elements on this one. Saloon piano, fuzz bass, and a scuffling snare crowd out lyrics about a woman roaming the country without a home on “Restless.” On “Smash My Head,” distorted power chords straight out of early 2000s alternative radio blare over a jittery IDM beat. Harp loops and field recordings of animals and warbling synth leads all compete for attention in the album’s busy jumble, burying its narrative elements in an incoherent melange. In a 2019 interview, CocoRosie admitted that they had never listened to Chance the Rapper before the Chicago artist approached them to contribute a feature to his album The Big Day. That a group who has availed itself of hip-hop elements for over a decade doesn’t keep up with some of its most ubiquitous players is maybe not all that surprising: CocoRosie tend to rap as if to highlight their own distance from the form, to play up its incongruousness with their position as white indie artists shielded by a heavy layer of quirk. On Put the Shine On, when they rap lines about familial abandonment in an aloof, sing-songy chirp, the effect of both their words and the way they choose to deliver them gets muddied. The pain behind the words is real, but its rendering starts to feel like a bit.","The Casady sisters’ first album in five years marks a return to their maximalist tendencies, piling on drum machines, chintzy synthesizers, over-the-top raps, and nu-metal guitars.

Like charm bracelets, miniature pastries, or Timothée Chalamet—everyone loves those. New Zealand band Yumi Zouma have been making pretty, soothing dream pop since 2014, and their newest album and first release on Polyvinyl, Truth or Consequences, is no exception. Enveloped in gauzy synth and vocal harmonies, their music is as sweetly tart as a ripe raspberry. But for all the technical perfection, the winsome aesthetics prove too insubstantial to stick. The highlights of Truth or Consequences are what one might call picnic disco: songs that feel lazy in the best way, like stretching out under a hot sun with only the occasional drum loop to gently poke you awake. On the bright “Right Track / Wrong Man,” vocalist Christie Simpson sings like she’s about to doze off, dreamily remembering a time when “we were bleeding sunset.” Simpson excels at this kind of sweet, sleepy delivery, which imbues her lines with heartache. When she sings the word “sad” on “Lie Like You Want Me Back,” it feels personal and specific. “I thought so hard about it,” she says of a lost relationship, turning the statement into an urgent plea for love to return. Yumi Zouma are very good at building these wistful, fleeting moods. “I’m hoping that you’ll catch me/Text me when you’re heading out,” Simpson sings over the crystalline arpeggios of “Mirror to the Fire,” a song that shares its nostalgic synth-pop sound with bands like Alvvays and the 1975. The echoey synths and billowy vocal layering of “Cool for a Second” are as rich and soft as butter in a hot pan. Even the title of “My Palms Are Your Reference to Hold to Your Heart” is full of saccharine melodrama—specific without being specific, like the painfully earnest message you might send to a crush after much deliberation and re-writing. Truth or Consequences is prime teen romance soundtrack fodder: unblushingly indulgent and emotional, deeply invested in truth, love, and reverb. But eventually, pure sentimentality wears thin. There can only be so much shimmering synth, ticking drum machine, and naptime vocals before it all begins to blend together. A truly great teen movie or 1975 track isn’t defined by an unwavering commitment to genre and form, but by the challenging of it. Even when an experiment comes up short, mistakes and failed attempts allow us to see others as the messy, raw, difficult humans we know ourselves to be. Truth or Consequences is more like a Valentine’s Day card—pleasantly sentimental, at times gratifying, and all too easy to forget.","The New Zealand band’s best songs are what one might call picnic disco: lazy in the best way, like stretching out under a hot sun with only the occasional drum loop to gently poke you awake.

A Written Testimony,Jay Electronica,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bba697fdf86000850e298/1:1/w_160/A%20Written%20Testimony_Jay%20Electronica.jpg,2020-03-17 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jay-electronica-a-written-testimony/,Roc Nation,"The myth of Jay Electronica has long outweighed the music—in part because there was so little of it. He’s been: touched by Erykah Badu juju; cozy with a Rothschild; a Nas ghostwriter. He got a thousand beats from J Dilla, was anointed by JAY-Z, and was the last man left standing after Kendrick Lamar put the rap world on notice during “Control.” He is a homeless drifter turned enigmatic spiritual guru who accepted a co-sign from notorious Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, met super-Christian Chance the Rapper halfway on Coloring Book’s “How Great,” and worshipped at Hindu and Buddhist temples in Nepal during personal pilgrimages. But he’s only officially put out one mixtape, two singles, and a handful of other songs since 2007, occasionally appearing out of thin air to guest on songs seemingly at random. And so with time, the myth grew. What was real and what was fiction began to blur, and what was real mattered less than what was interesting. The ghostwriting claims were disputed, he has never released a song with an original Dilla beat, and many count him as a footnote left in Kendrick’s wake, but he did actually end up between two of the wealthiest families in England. The selection of songs Jay Electronica has released over his career has drawn from all of this, only he’s put out as many of them in 13 years as some prolific rappers put out in a few months. The wait for his debut album has been so long that it became more of an ancient prophecy than a movable release date. But the album, A Written Testimony, has finally materialized. It is a mystical, distinctive work that nearly lives up to all the lore surrounding the rapper. First and foremost, it is a prayerful offering that expresses the many spiritual and communal virtues he has internalized. But it’s also a record about the scrutiny of an insatiable public, one that leans on higher powers amid self-doubt. In just under 40 minutes, Jay Electronica erects monuments to Allah, NOI founder Elijah Muhammad, and Roc Nation overseer JAY-Z, who is at his side for nearly the entire album serving as sergeant-at-arms. “From a hard place and a rock to the Roc Nation of Islam/I emerged on the wave that Tidal made to drop bombs,” he raps on “Ghost of Soulja Slim.” From this well of deep faith, he summons rap performances that seem to defy space-time. Like Dr. Dre scrapped the expectation-bogged Detox for Compton, Jay Elec (mostly) starts fresh here. An album called Act II: Patients Of Nobility (The Turn) had been in the offing since 2010, but a sequel three presidential terms in the making carries too much baggage. After waiting more than a decade for an album that will likely never come, fans instead received a brand new album only a few months after its announcement, one made in “40 days and 40 nights”—a period of great biblical significance (Jesus fasted, Moses waited on Mount Sinai for God’s law, Elijah fled in the wilderness). With the exception of “Shiny Suit Theory,” these are new songs, or, at least, previously unreleased ones. Whether the raps are from scribbled verses stashed away in Moleskines since the late 2000s or produced during the 40-day period of inspiration, the album sounds current because Jay Electronica’s rapping is immediate and immutable. A Written Testimony is largely defined by the space between every note and word. These beats have a subtle grandeur to them that suits the gravitas with which Jay Elec performs. He produced most of the album himself, but the Alchemist and No I.D. follow his lead with gorgeous, unadorned flips. The music of “A.P.I.D.T.A.” is so untouched that the sampled band, Khruangbin, is credited as the producer. The beats on “Ghost of Soulja Slim” and “Ezekiel’s Wheel” affix understated drum kits to fuzzy, lo-fi samples that sound culled directly from TCM standards. Even “The Blinding,” which is split between booming Swizz Beatz and AraabMuzik chant music and elegant Hit-Boy dinner party rap, finds its way onto this tapestry. The unobtrusive but marvelous production allows Jay Electronica to be heard with the greatest clarity; he enunciates each syllable as if etching it into stone. These are his 10 hotep commandments. Rap is no stranger to Five-Percenter rhetoric. It has touched artists from Wu-Tang Clan to Common, but Jay Electronica is curiously the rapper closest to the Nation of Islam and also the most cagey about his ideology. Through the NOI, as a young man, he found black power and unity, self-sufficiency and self-improvement. The teachings are his backbone and he uses them to lock horns with the devil. On “The Neverending Story,” he turns his origin story into a fable in which religious conviction saved him from destitution and hopelessness. Whether you take his faith at face value, the way he raps about it is mathematical—creating this impressive symmetry out of his life where there seemingly wasn’t any before. He weighs each word carefully and weaves in his own arcane theology. He is focused, convincing, and on message, even if that message is taking Biggie from Rap Mecca to actual Mecca, as Jay Elec flips a line from “Juicy” into one of the Five Pillars: “Remember Rappin’ Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha/You never thought we’d make it to Lā ilāha illā Allah.” It’s tempting to frame Jay Elec strictly as a mystic trying to fully unlock his chakras—and it’s hard not to when he’s rapping about the return of the Annunaki, calculating azimuths, or dragging his cross to Nazareth while wearing his crown of thorns—but he balances his mysticism with the down-to-earth perceptiveness of someone who has wandered the globe seeking refuge from sin. For all the time he spends consulting the universe in search of absolute truth, he spends just as much lingering in the traumas of the human condition. “I spent many nights bent off Woodford/Clutchin’ the bowl, stuffin’ my nose/Some of the cons I suffered for prose,” he raps on “Universal Soldier.” He mourns Flint, ICE breaking up families, and mortars striking Palestinians. His poignant verse on “A.P.I.D.T.A.” wrestles with the unceasing pain of experiencing death, even when you find comfort in the existence of the hereafter. The grandiosity is his sales pitch, but the real selling point is the empathy within. He is supported at nearly every turn by career-redefining performances from rap’s greatest careerist, his billionaire boss JAY-Z. Rappers tend to fall off the cliff at 50, not just losing touch with the culture but losing their grasp of swing, like an aging athlete succumbing to arthritic joints. Hov has been turning back the clock for a while now, but he does something far more impressive here than 4:44’s personal accounting: He contorts into whatever shape is required of him by his host. During his last real foray into tag-team rapping, 2011’s Watch the Throne, JAY-Z was a step slower than his protege Kanye, a disparity largely exposed by his own eagerness to dictate the pace. On A Written Testimony, the God MC seems to simply be ordaining another. JAY clearly loves rapping with Jay Elec. These circumstances give him the chance to set his competitiveness aside and become the conscious technician he always dreamed of being.  “My ancestors took old food, made soul food/Jim Crow’s a troll too, he stole the soul music/That’s the blood that goes through me, so you assumin’/I could never sell my soul, they sold they soul to me,” he raps right out of the gate on “Ghost of Soulja Slim.” JAY-Z, who is pretty familiar with the movement, is reanimated by purpose here. Together, the two Jays exchange epic pyramid raps, settling into a rhythm that would make Raekwon and Ghostface proud. On “Shiny Suit Theory,” JAY-Z raps, “In the world of no justice and black ladies on the back of buses/I’m the immaculate conception of rappers-slash-hustlers,” and that thread of divine providence as the key to overcoming black struggle continues here. JAY-Z and Jay Elec follow this train of thought from two different angles and meet in the middle: The Five-Percenter ideal that the black man is god and the idea that through Allah black people can be granted agency. This is where Jay Elec finds his strength. The dignity and earnestness through which he raps lend all his verses a certain authority. He isn’t asking for reverence, only for onlookers to heed his experience as a man who found religion and its power to transform. What you believe is up to you, Jay Electronica simply wants you to have a little faith. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.","After years of waiting and mounting hype, Jay Electronica’s fantastic debut is a mystical, distinctive work that nearly lives up to all the lore surrounding the rapper.

Underneath,Code Orange,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bbc138d6d4a000883fef1/1:1/w_160/Underneath_Code%20Orange.jpg,2020-03-17 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/code-orange-underneath/,Roadrunner,"Code Orange have been on the brink of a breakthrough since they were teenagers. A dozen years ago, the Pittsburgh kids rose from the local ranks to the taste-making Deathwish imprint before making their major-label debut with 2017’s Forever. Abrasive and volatile yet accessible, Forever became a consensus critical favorite, topping year-end lists at Rolling Stone and Revolver and prompting praise from The New York Times when it was nominated for a Grammy. They were a hit away, it seemed, from crossing over into whatever’s left of mainstream rock. But Code Orange’s second album for Roadrunner, the exhausting and uneven Underneath, lands like a glib attempt to do just that while forsaking the idiosyncrasies that made them interesting. Recorded with Nick Raskulinecz, who has spent 25 years helming consistently middling efforts from the likes of Ghost and Korn, Underneath aims to justify Code Orange’s major-label existence, from its rigorously high concept about the psychological damage of our digital reality to the warmed-over rock radio moves of its would-be hits. During “You and You Alone,” Jami Morgan seethes, “It’s killing me, every line you scribble on the page/In trying to be an amalgamation of everything you see.” It’s an unintentional encapsulation of Underneath, an album that wants to be so much it’s barely anything at all. The central idea is obvious enough: Our online lives cause dangerously wide divisions within our personalities. Code Orange call nomophobia—a neologism for the fear of being without your phone—by name and criticize the din of modern life as “crowded Technovision.” They take this theme to its violent extreme, painting technology as a parasite feeding off our energy and a tool that will drive us—“the guinea pigs of a generation”—to madness or death. They quote Ricardo López, the Björk stalker who committed suicide after mailing her a bomb, and assail the way we have become “brains in chains.” Underneath reads like the Twitter account of a paranoid friend you muted long ago, or the slapdash musings of someone who shouldn’t smoke sativa after morning coffee. The music itself prompts the same sort of shrug and chuckle. An overzealous pastiche full of inspirations but near-devoid of new ideas, Underneath is as goofy and garish as the worst of nu metal. Code Orange sprint between touchstones and subgenres as if they were running a Tough Mudder, trying to prove their versatility and grit. “Cold Metal Core” gilds grindcore with harsh noise, like Pig Destroyer with an unnecessarily big budget, while “Last Ones Left” founders in its attempt to find solid ground between Slipknot and Wolf Eyes. The metal riffs are more aluminum than iron, the industrial beats hilariously dated, and the power electronics too weak to stand on their own. Code Orange’s longtime enthusiasm for stop-time pauses—moments in which everything goes quiet, so they can redirect a song’s momentum—was once unpredictable and exhilarating. Now, it feels like a crutch. The radio-ready anthems here are hackneyed and awkward, like ’90s leftovers reheated with post-millennial white adolescent rage. With its sustained guitar squeals and whisper-to-roar dynamics, “Who I Am” sounds like a teenager experimenting with basic electronics while listening to the Deftones. “The Easy Way” springboards from cheesy industrial signifiers to a pandering hook that recalls Filter. “Underneath”—the closing track and first single—is the ugly crust that got stuck between Sirius XM’s Lithium and Octane. It’s so repetitive, at least, that you can turn it off after the first half and save yourself the last two minutes. Code Orange are proud practitioners of scene beef and self-aggrandizement. They seem to thrive on bombast and controversy, even telling Kerrang that “[Underneath] … is more relevant than anything that’s coming out in rock and metal this year. Period.” Underneath may indeed set them apart from the fray and push them to larger audiences, shouting back the chorus of “Who I Am” or grunting out some approximation of “Swallowing the Rabbit Whole.” But it will be at the expense of the very recent feeling that Code Orange could reshape the vanguard of popular metal.","At the edge of crossover success, the hardcore stalwarts sputter out with an overstuffed album of weak modern-rock imitations.

Satin Doll,Sam Gendel,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bf5757fdf86000850e29e/1:1/w_160/Satin%20Doll_Sam%20Gendel.jpg,2020-03-17 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-gendel-satin-doll/,Nonesuch,"Songbook standards can offer a blank canvas. Even straightforward renditions can reveal artists in a new light, like when Willie Nelson tackled the Great American Songbook on his immaculate Stardust at the height of outlaw country, or when John Coltrane countered claims of being “anti-jazz” with his luminous Ballads. They can serve as a bold statement, as when Oneohtrix Point Never deconstructed the Harry Warren/Al Dubin ballad “I Only Have Eyes for You.” After a few years bubbling under with work for Vampire Weekend, Ry Cooder, Lonnie Holley, and Atticus Ross, Los Angeles-based jazz saxophonist Sam Gendel takes the latter tack with his Nonesuch debut, Satin Doll. Recorded live over the course of three days with bassist Gabe Noel and electronic percussionist Philippe Melanson, Satin Doll pays tribute to everything from Duke Ellington to Hoagy Carmichael, with Gendel dismantling each standard and reassembling it. You’ve never heard so many glitches, hiccups, and pregnant pauses in “Afro Blue” before; Gendel's trio stretches the frame as far as it can go while keeping the tune recognizable. The result feels as weirdly expansive as Coltrane’s famous nine-minute exploration of the Mongo Santamaría original, even as it wraps up in just over three. Rather than extrapolate on the original melodies, Gendel’s group instead reveal alien qualities inside them. Gendel’s closest predecessors might be Jon Hassell and Ben Neill, but he also nods to the slurred aesthetic of West Coast and Southern rap. You only need to hear two notes—burred and squished though they may be—to perk up with recognition at “Freddie Freeloader,” which Gendel couches in the pneumatic wheeze of G-funk. His tactile playing reveals all manner of new textures within the title track: candy-paint gloss, soap bubbles, Jeff Koons’ balloon dogs. But beneath all that shine, his horn captures the swoon of the original. It doesn’t always work. Their sputtering take on Charles Mingus’ Lester Young homage “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat” is intriguing, but the synthesized vocals—delivering the lyrics that Joni Mitchell penned years later—feel like an A.I.’s attempt to “swing.” A better Young homage comes one song later with “Stardust;” Gendel’s buttery vibrato burrows beneath the track’s otherwise-impenetrable sheen, evoking the late tenor saxophonist’s essence. Gendel and group coyly slot original tunes like ""Glide Mode"" and ""Saxofone Funeral"" into the mix.  They melt the familiar timbres of horn, bass, and drums into blobs and add samples, making explicit their love for Madlib and chopped ‘n’ screwed music. That playful approach makes their rendition of “Cold Duck Time” feel even drunker than Eddie Harris’ woozy original (a tribute to the titular treacly fortified wine). Gendel and group pile on with UFO whooshes and garbled vocal samples. The trio lets loose, Noel’s bass propelling them into deeper, weirder space. Throughout, Satin Doll warps these standards delectably, leaving you pleasantly dizzy.","On his Nonesuch debut, the innovative saxophonist reinvents jazz standards with a psychedelic hip-hop touch.

Sorry You Couldn’t Make It,Swamp Dogg,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bc0157fdf86000850e299/1:1/w_160/Sorry_Swamp%20Dogg.jpg,2020-03-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/swamp-dogg-sorry-you-couldnt-make-it/,Joyful NoisePioneer Works Press,"Jerry Williams Jr. knows how to tell a colorful story because he’s lived one. Ever since a revelatory psychedelic experience in the late 1960s, the 77-year-old musician and producer has issued some two dozen volumes of far-out funk and soul explorations as his larger-than-life alter ego, Swamp Dogg. In 2018, Williams told Rolling Stone that he wanted to “shock the shit out of [listeners]” with Love, Loss, and Auto-Tune, an album that made heavy use of the titular audio program to warp his voice as he continued to reckon with the death of his wife, Yvonne, in 2003. His new album Sorry You Couldn’t Make It restores him to a more even keel, examining grief from greater distance while savoring life’s little sweetnesses. Billed as Williams’ country album, Sorry You Couldn’t Make It hits its thematic marks within funkified arrangements. “I’d Rather Be Your Used to Be” and “Sleeping Without You Is a Dragg” are exemplary tearjerkers; “Family Pain” addresses the intergenerational fractures of poverty and addiction. “A Good Song,” meanwhile, feels like a zoomed-in update to Tom T. Hall’s plainly gorgeous “I Love.” As on Love, Loss, and Auto-Tune, Williams is accompanied by a handful of guests. Justin Vernon and Poliça’s Ryan Olson, who helped Williams actualize his Auto-Tune landscapes, return to the fold; alongside them are Nashville titan John Prine, Jenny Lewis, and Olson’s Poliça bandmate Channy Leaneagh. Across the album, Vernon serves as an unobtrusive sideman on guitar. Prine first appears on “Memories,” but he and Williams find surer footing on closer “Please Let Me Go Round Again,” as they look back on life in wistful bewilderment. Prine’s affinity with Williams feels natural and immediate; set to a relaxed soul shuffle, their gentle ribbing makes a charming finale. The record’s only real derailment comes at the end of “Memories,” when the song begins to garble and warp as though recorded on damaged tape. The analogy to human memory is a familiar one; here, it feels like an overt effort to prevent the atmosphere from getting too warm and nostalgic. (God forbid those glowing, lightly goofy guitar ripples linger, lest we start trusting our own rose-tinted glasses.) The more muted instrumental reverberations in the back half of “Billy” pursue the same effect, tilting the song away from saccharine balladry. Williams has long been celebrated as a cult figure, sharing his generous appetite for experimentation only among those curious enough to tune in for themselves. Half a century later, he remains a broad-minded explorer whose genre-free approach to his craft reveals fresh curiosities. But, as Williams lays out across Sorry You Couldn’t Make It, even his creative victories are bittersweet: He must go on living without the people with whom he’d most like to celebrate.","Billed as a country album, the latest LP from the idiosyncratic soul artist born Jerry Williams Jr. examines grief from a distance, taking time to savor life’s little sweetnesses.

Melee,Dogleg,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6a5e427fdf86000850e289/1:1/w_160/Melee_Dogleg.png,2020-03-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dogleg-melee/,Triple Crown,"While the word “melee” would have been truth-in-advertising for the riotous post-hardcore battle royale of Dogleg’s debut album, it’s actually an homage to Super Smash Bros.—a video game as essential to their live show as frontman Alex Stoitsiadis’ onstage cartwheels. The Detroit, Michigan quartet offers free swag to anyone who can beat bassist Chase Macisnki on the Nintendo 64 emulator at their merch table and they haven’t lost a T-shirt yet. Despite their overt gaming references on the album to Pokemon and Star Fox, Dogleg aren’t interested in fantasy or world-building, just the sheer, rejuvenating physical pleasure of controlling a lifelike version of yourself capable of jumping higher, punching faster, and sustaining more damage than any human could. Though still self-produced and recorded in Stoitsiadis’ house, Melee levels up like Dogleg are clutching some kind of glowing orb that allows them to jump the gap between their rowdy live shows and 2015’s scrappy Remember Alderaan? EP. Dogleg guarantee hyperbolic energy, whether playing in front of a dozen onlookers in an unfamiliar DIY space or the jubilant hometown crowd at Bled Fest captured in the video for the atomic shout-along “Fox.” It’s a testament to their unwavering vitality that “Fox” isn’t an outlier, but surrounded by equally anthemic instances of fighting anxiety with more anxiety. There are still hints of the gateway bands that served as Dogleg’s early influences. “Wrist” does breakneck jumping jacks until Milwaukee’s Best sweats through its pores, as if the Strokes had spent their late teens in University of Michigan’s Metal Frat instead of a Swiss boarding school. As with most rock music that sounds truly youthful, Melee doesn’t invent new forms so much as connect bands once separated by subtle genre classification. The Gen-Z members of Dogleg use Melee as a synopsis of guitar music made in their short lifetime from bands whose aggression appeared completely at odds with prevailing tastes. In their sound are bands like ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead and At the Drive In who served as the violent wing of the New Rock Revolution; Cloud Nothings’ Attack on Memory and Japandroids’ Celebration Rock’s  referendum on chillwave; an entire decade of Midwestern emo raging against cosmopolitan lifestyle-indie. Melee effectively advocates for a binary of taste: There is rock music that slaps and rock music that does not, the latter of which should not be given any attention. Melee was more or less complete when Dogleg signed to Triple Crown in early 2019, and in the time since, they’ve tinkered with the mix only to settle on the most obvious production aesthetic: loud and, if possible, slightly louder. From the first engine-revving, “buckle up, motherfucker” riff of “Kawasaki Backflip,” Dogleg are fueled by the perpetually brick-walled waveform, whether through blunt force, sidelong strikes, or the kind of precise combinations of both that make them so formidable at Super Smash Bros. “Kawasaki Backflip” and “Hotlines” live in the exhilaratingly small space between floating and faceplanting. The vocal and guitar melodies chase each other across “Bueno” and “Wartortle,” as Stoitsiadis turns a harsh, melodic bark into an atonal scream every time the band tries to shake him off the trail. “Fox” ends in a full sprint, and after a brief snippet of laughter, “Headfirst” spends its duration somersaulting downhill, the thrill of victory and agony of defeat as one. While many of Melee’s thrills are similar to contact sports, Dogleg’s decision-making process is painstaking and considered, even if it mostly amounts to “play fast.” The blinkered dedication to velocity becomes an asset. For all of its immediate, point-and-shout, crowd-surfing appeal, the most impactful moments on “Fox” are an ankle-breaking hitch of a drum fill and a bass solo leading up to Stoitsiadis’ triumphant guitar-whee. In the video for “Kawasaki Backflip,” Dogleg break shit alone in a garage until Stoitsiadis takes a sledgehammer to his reflection during the rhythm section’s climactic slam on the brakes. Melee is filled with similarly counterintuitive hooks: put the beery group vocals at the front of the song, save the strings and horns for the loudest tracks, avoid the mid-album ballad and put the nastiest songs there instead. There are no quiet parts, no calm, no pauses for a group hug, even if there are 13 credited backup vocalists. In the rare moments when there’s any bit of space, someone in the band is still screaming off-mic before plunging back into the fray. There is no doubt that Melee is emo as hell—Stoitsiadis begins and ends the album lying on the floor in a state of abject depression, framing the choice of fighting back or giving up as the same kind of elemental, apocalyptic ultimatum that echoes through “Born to Run,” “A Praise Chorus,” and “Fire’s Highway.” But spiritually, it’s aligned with subgenres like crunk and happy hardcore, where the lyrics mostly function as prompts for its ultimate goal of sublimating pent-up aggression into physical liberation. If Dogleg’s scope is limited, it’s only in the service of blocking out anything that stands in the way of a singular, superhuman ambition to buck all assumptions about what an ambitious rock album is supposed to do in 2020. Dogleg aspires to nothing short of breaking the first law of thermodynamics: creating energy where none previously existed.","The thrilling debut from the Detroit rock band burns hot and bright. It’s a record that’s as melodic as it is physical, where pent-up aggression turns into physical liberation.

Kiss My Super Bowl Ring,The Garden,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6a63079aba22000834ea03/1:1/w_160/Kiss%20My_The%20Garden.jpg,2020-03-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-garden-kiss-my-super-bowl-ring/,Epitaph,"The Garden like to make a spectacle of themselves. At a release party celebrating their 2018 album Mirror Might Steal Your Charm, the striking rock duo made a French circus tent their stage; the band’s members, identical twins Wyatt and Fletcher Shears, performed the show’s first half in face paint and medieval jester garb, an image that’s replicated in many of their music videos. They’re not just a band, this campy aesthetic seems to claim—they’re entertainers. And whether it’s in their off-the-wall live performances, their side gigs modeling for designers like Saint Laurent, or their irreverent brand of experimental punk, the Garden want your attention. Convention has never been their intent, and their new album Kiss My Super Bowl Ring is their most unorthodox release to date. The Shears brothers formed the Garden as teenagers in 2011, taking early inspiration from eclectic ’80s punk group the Minutemen. They’ve since operated by a method they call “vada vada”: “total freedom of expression without boundaries or guidelines of any sort.” Kiss My Super Bowl Ring abides by that process, implementing unexpected electronic influences and enlisting left-field producers Dylan Brady of 100 gecs and WHARFWHIT of Kero Kero Bonito. Blown-out bass and jungle breakbeats give the album’s more computerized moments a clubbier feel, while the occasional thrashing drums and searing shrieks recall the band’s hardcore roots. Sprinkle in features from Ariel Pink and flashy New York rapper Le1f, and Super Bowl Ring attempts to wear many hats at once, a frenetic collection of songs that grapple with existential woes and cathartic rage. The Garden sound best at their most upbeat, on songs like the rip-roaring “AMPM Truck,” where Wyatt’s melodic basslines and Fletcher’s snappy drumming take the forefront. At the opposite end of the spectrum, “Sneaky Devil” is loaded with anxiety-ridden industrial elements to inspire freaky dancing and open mosh pits. Songs like these embody the restless anxiety the twins divulge in their lyrics: “A struggle, if you wanna call it that/Hate to burst your bubble, but it is that,” Wyatt sings in the bouncy chorus of “A Struggle,” as if to apologize for disconcerting themes to come. “Sneaky Devil” is just one name-drop away from a diss track: “Fuck you, kid, now I have your address/And in a second I could put your racist ass to bed,” he taunts, after unintelligibly listing things he’s “sick of”—politicians, carbon footprints—with a fury that makes you wonder how long he’s been keeping his anger concealed. “AMPM Truck” reckons with life’s futility after a near-fatal instance of nodding off behind the steering wheel. For a band whose earlier work has bordered on sheer absurdity, the distress and malevolence of Super Bowl Ring feels particularly unnerving. At times, the album can feel erratic. Its first tracks, “Clench to Stay Awake” and “A Struggle,” vacillate between multiple opposing themes with whiplash-inducing suddenness that ultimately sounds haphazard. Slower tracks like “A Fool’s Expedition” and “Lurkin’” plod along in comparison, lacking the frenzy of the album’s brighter moments. However uneven, Kiss My Super Bowl Ring is proudly defiant; the title, Wyatt has clarified, essentially means “kiss my ass.” But where deviation from the norm has spawned countless artistic geniuses, Super Bowl Ring too often comes off as just a hodgepodge of ideas. “Vada vada,” it seems, has hurt the Garden as much as it’s helped them.","Fusing ’80s-inspired hardcore with playful electronics, the Shears brothers’ bass-and-drums duo enlists a handful of high-profile collaborators in their mission for “total freedom of expression.”

Music From First Cow,William Tyler,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e67f886be35b2000813b0c9/1:1/w_160/Music%20from%20First%20Cow_William%20Tyler.jpg,2020-03-16 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/william-tyler-music-from-first-cow/,Merge,"American history has historically been painted on a large canvas. By purposeful contrast, Kelly Reichardt’s First Cow is very small, a frontier story you can hold in your hand—Reichardt renders her version of America’s emergence as the gentle intimacy between two men, a purposeful pushback against the grand narratives of our past. A quiet cook called Cookie (John Magaro) has made his way to Oregon with an outfit of fur trappers, where he encounters King Lu (Orion Lee), a widely traveled immigrant from China. Both men have no clear future, but no real home to return to; the only possible direction is forward, carving out a transient existence on the outposts of expansion. The town they find themselves in is home to the titular first cow in the territory, owned by the wealthy emissary of a British trading company (Toby Jones). With some simple ingredients and a little pilfered milk, Cookie and King Lu are able to make quick money selling cakes and pastries to settlers desperate for anything close to a creature comfort, but it’s only a matter of time before the jig is up, the cow is fenced off, and the newfound friends are run out of town. Reichardt occupies a unique position within American independent cinema; she’s a known name who regularly works with familiar faces, but the compass that orients her vision remains experimental. Films like Old Joy (scored by Yo La Tengo, and starring Will Oldham) and Certain Women are purposeful in their pacing, deliberate and meandering like a walk in the woods, but uniquely concerned with the organic beauty of Western American landscapes. In Japan, there’s a concept called shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing,” which means immersing yourself in the ambience of a wooded environment as you would soak in a tub—Kelly Reichardt’s movies always make me feel like I’ve taken a forest bath for a thousand years, renewed and revitalized like photosynthesis working its natural magic on a shriveled leaf. William Tyler similarly sits at the crossroads of accessible and avant-garde — he’s the son of the couple who wrote country standards for legends like The Oak Ridge Boys, but his instrumental Americana work approaches post-country. There’s an expansiveness to Tyler’s music that owes as much to ambient music as it does to John Fahey. Merge Records has released Tyler’s score for the film, along with snatches of dialogue, as Music From First Cow. Reichardt applies a tiny lens to an overwhelming subject, so it’s only fitting that Tyler reduces the scope of his work in turn. His score is only one small part of the movie’s audio track, a subtle human presence within Reichardt’s typically rich palette of natural sounds. Each cue builds on repeated themes, which Tyler introduces by way of lone electric guitar on “An Opening.” The film begins in the present day, but as a single cut takes us back over a century, Tyler’s signature instrument is swaddled with era-appropriate accompaniment, as a familiar tune is translated across varied timbres: toy piano on “Cookie’s Theme,” mandolins and banjos on “Arrival” and “A Clearing in the Field.” Emptiness and absence are key players; on “The Separation,” he lets the notes hang, the harsh slide of a guitar and faint piano keys suggesting the distance between human beings in this unknown landscape. The only time he is surrounded by a full ensemble is on “A Closing,” as our two drifters have been subsumed by a rigid world of capitalist civilization. Tyler and Reichardt are both artists who flirt with pop structure while remaining committed to a more experimental ethos. But they are more than stylistic kindred; each uses their work to push back against the coming reality First Cow gently warns of. The problem with being an artist on the avant-garde frontier is that frontiers exist to be closed—through their union, William Tyler and Kelly Reichardt express a continued commitment to a harmonious existence between humanity and the landscape it inhabits.","Guitarist William Tyler crafts a spare and meditative soundtrack for filmmaker Kelly Reichardt's quiet frontier story.

Hunted,Anna Calvi,by: Brodie Lancaster,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e67ef344c06390008485ee5/1:1/w_160/Hunted_Anna%20Calvi.jpg,2020-03-16 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anna-calvi-hunted/,Domino,"In his paintings Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the British artist David Hockney used the pretext of private pools as scenes for voyeurism. At a time when homosexuality was still criminalized in his native UK, the artist's adopted home of Los Angeles provided a sanctuary where he could express his desires, which were fueled by post-war ""beefcake"" magazines and Hollywood films. Anna Calvi has said Hockney's obsession with the pools he first noticed from his airplane window was a direct inspiration for the rippling guitars in “Swimming Pool,” a song from her 2018 record Hunter. On that album, she explored gender and sexuality and dove into her relationship to androgyny. Her swimming pool wasn’t vivid and clear like Hockney’s, but a shadowy and eerie space where desire could be contained. 18 months after its release, Calvi dug out her earliest recordings for Hunter, and saw that, in their rawest state, the tracks were a time capsule, vulnerable dispatches often whispered gingerly over her Telecaster. Resisting the impulse to remix or revisit the tracks herself, she sent four of them to artists she admires—Julia Holter, Courtney Barnett, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Joe Talbot—and has released their contributions, along with three tracks in their demo form, as the EP Hunted. Calvi’s preoccupation with gender roles and fluidity imprints itself on her collaborators here, as Barnett's trademark laconic drawl joins her on “Don't Beat the Girl Out of My Boy.” The addition of Talbot on “Wish” transforms the song from a pulsing encouragement to indulge in fatalist desires into a tense and sorrowful elegy. The IDLES frontman uses his grief and loss to transform the band’s live shows into punk rallies campaigning for joy and hope, but he’s more melancholy here. His and Calvi’s dueling voices evoke a primal need, born from the fear of knowing time is running out. At no point on the EP is Calvi's role in the proceedings made truly explicit: she is both the hunter and the prey, the quivering and the stalking. On the album cover, she appears drenched in sweat, her every pore and blood vessel visible. Tendrils of her dark hair are matted to her face in the aftermath of the ecstatic pose she assumed on Hunter's artwork. This is what comes after, she suggests: the steam from her exhaling nose distorts the mirror’s reflection of her smudged lipstick and running eyeliner. The makeup is a marker of traditional femininity, but there's something carnal and animalistic to her pose, a rejection of the ladylike and precious. Across Hunted’s seven tracks, Calvi contorts her dance along the spectrum of gender and sexuality into something more of a march, stomping between tenderness and brutality. On “Eden”, Gainsbourg echoes Calvi’s story of a formative queer romance, while Holter's otherworldly vocals rise up from the depths on “Swimming Pool.” Calvi's intention to share the frame with other artists on Hunted feels like a way to relinquish control while maintaining power, allowing her work to be a mirror more than one person can stand before. But even when she's hidden from view, there's no one else who could possibly be in charge.","The singer-songwriter revisits highlights from her magnetic 2018 LP with the help of guests like Charlotte Gainsbourg, Courtney Barnett, and Julia Holter.

Tragic Kingdom,No Doubt,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d39e919382e0008724eac/1:1/w_160/tragic%20kingdom.jpg,2020-03-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/no-doubt-tragic-kingdom/,TraumaInterscope,"In the mid-1990s, when alternative was the new pop, there were all sorts of subgenres duking it out for dominance. The success of grunge put everything from Bush to Blind Melon on the radio, but perhaps the most curious alt offshoot to emerge in one corner of the mainstream was the ska revival. The third-wave ska scene ran the gamut from Reel Big Fish’s cornball, horn-driven antics to Less Than Jake’s emo-tinged losercore to Rancid’s gritty take on the Specials to Sublime’s frat-boy-and-420-friendly strain, not to mention the peppy breakthrough of longtime stalwarts the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. But there was no ’90s ska figure quite like Gwen Stefani, the movement’s Dickies-clad poster-girl turned culturally roving ’00s hitmaker turned People Magazine staple. There is also no pop star origin story quite like hers. At the urging of Gwen’s keyboardist brother Eric, the Stefanis performed at a school talent show in their native Anaheim, California in the mid-’80s. Their song of choice was “On My Radio,” the 1979 hit by the two-tone ska band the Selecter. Gwen wore a homemade dress that resembled one worn by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, her favorite musical. Showtune theatrics and Selecter singer Pauline Black (who mixes a hyper-feminine chirp with an operatic warble) would go on to influence Gwen’s early vocal style, and set her on the path of pursuing hybrid sounds and aesthetics. In 1986, Gwen and Eric formed a band alongside John Spence, their classmate and co-worker at the local Dairy Queen. Spence, whose go-to response—“No doubt!”—gave the group its name, shared vocal duties with Gwen and served as her gruff-voiced foil. They were just kids in love with the way British bands like the Selecter, Madness, and the Specials made everyday frustrations feel lively, and they were trapped in sunny Orange County, the home of Disneyland and suburban punk ennui. No Doubt played the house-party circuit, quickly found a local following, and picked up members, including bassist Tony Kanal, who would soon start dating Gwen in secret. But tragedy struck when, in 1987, Spence took his own life. It was the first of three destabilizing events that would change the course of No Doubt, a band forever defined by its interpersonal drama. After trumpet-player-turned-co-vocalist Alan Meade exited No Doubt, Gwen was ready to front the band on her own. By 1990, the lineup was solidified with fan-turned-drummer Adrian Young, local metal guitarist Tom Dumont, and a robust horn section. Their popularity around Southern California clubs and colleges grew until finally, they caught the eye of Interscope A&R Tony Ferguson. In 1991, he brought famed record executive Jimmy Iovine to one of No Doubt’s shows, where “Jimmy told someone, ‘That girl will be a star in five years,’” recalled Gwen (and corroborated by Iovine) in a 1996 SPIN cover story. Over the next five years, Gwen would go from singing two-tone covers and her brother’s originals for devoted local crowds, to zig-zagging the globe with her own tales of heartache and rage. She would have to lose the two men closest to her first. No Doubt’s debut for Interscope, a 1992 self-titled LP, was mostly (but not entirely) devoid of hooks, and partially informed by Eric’s cabaret flair and goofy sense of humor (they gave away kazoos at the album release party, if that explains anything). Poor sales made Interscope hesitant to dive right into a follow-up, and the label took a stronger hand in guiding the group’s sound, namely with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric didn’t like that, and over time he isolated himself from the band, despite practice being held at his house. After he quit in 1994 to work as an animator on The Simpsons, the other members took over songwriting duties on the album that would become Tragic Kingdom. Right around the same time, Kanal called it off with Gwen, after seven years together. Gwen had never really written her own lyrics, but it helped that she was suddenly filled with pain and confusion. She was, in many ways, a girl with traditional values: In interviews from this era, she marveled at the fact that she got famous instead of starting a family, and her songs sometimes yearn for a “simple kind of life.” But this is perhaps not the impression you’d get from the initial wallop of Tragic Kingdom, featuring one of the decade’s fieriest opening four-song runs, all of which were singles: “Spiderwebs,” a new-wave rafter-shaker about a girl screening her calls; “Excuse Me Mr.”, a dramatic ska-punk number about a girl confronting a dude who’s avoiding her; “Just a Girl,” a fun-but-menacing-sounding hit about a girl just trying to live; and “Happy Now?”, an ever-shifting rock song about a girl chiding her ex. The point was made: girl mad. Following the surge of third-wave feminism in the early ’90s, the mid-’90s became the peak of the “angry white female” era in rock and pop. It was a time when feminized aggression—from Hole and riot grrrl to Liz Phair and Alanis Morissette—was suddenly perceived as being on-trend, as if women haven’t been furious forever. Stefani, girly tomboy ultra, arguably benefited from this kind of branding, even while she maintained the fun, energetic personality that led Courtney Love to dub her a “cheerleader” and others to call her the “anti-Courtney Love.” Lead single “Just a Girl” was Gwen’s bridge to planet angry. Upon its release in September 1995, it became a theme song for any girl fed up with living in a boy’s world—with the emphasis once again being on girl. Spice Girls would soon turn “girl power” into a full-on marketing technique, but “Just a Girl” was some kind of magic middle-ground in the context of ’90s pop-feminism: sassy, addictively sweet and sour, yet still accessible. Dumont’s indelible looping riff adds a taunting feeling, while the lyrics leave interpretation conveniently ajar with lines like “I’m just a girl/So don’t let me have any rights.” Never has Stefani’s vocal style—with its forays into babydoll voice and its breathless, swooping belts—felt more intentional as a performance technique meant to amplify her message. “Just a Girl” is not a subtle song, but what it’s doing is quietly masterful: The sarcasm subverts the underlying victimhood in a sneering way, but victimhood is also something girls (particularly white or privileged girls) quickly understand as a tool for getting what they want. Gwen’s Tragic Kingdom-era pain was incandescent because it felt off the cuff, uninhibited, and barely removed from its cause. You saw that up close in “Don’t Speak,” the breakup ballad that pushed No Doubt’s success over the edge, topping the Billboard airplay chart for 16 weeks. Starting in late 1996 and continuing for much of 1997, flutters of Spanish guitar and angelic whispers of “hush hush, darling” were inescapable; for those listening across radio formats or watching MTV at the time, the song’s ubiquity reached “if I hear this one more time…” levels. But people also could not look away from the saga of Gwen and Tony, SoCal ska’s Stevie and Lindsey. Every night they’d hit the stage and seemingly be forced to relive their split through “Don’t Speak,” a song musically at odds with nearly everything in their upbeat catalog. Not every song on Tragic Kingdom is overtly about the breakup or the frustrations of girlhood—this is ’90s California ska, after all, a few mostly positive chillers are required. But the album tracks skew cheesy, especially now. Ska bands of the era would sometimes show off their funk chops with a disco cut on their LPs, but No Doubt’s take, “You Can Do It,” is plagued by fake disco strings and a guitar jangle that borders on musical clip art. “Different People,” a brass-and-keyboard-led ska track about how the world is big and diverse, has the tension of a child’s picture book, and the depth of one too. Eric’s musical-theater-strikes-back closer “Tragic Kingdom” is cringeworthy in highly specific ways: the sampling of theme-park announcements, the egregiously drawn-out tempo changes, the fact that it seems to be about how evil Walt Disney is. (Besides, on an album like this, the most tragic of kingdoms is actually Gwen and Tony’s love story, not the suburbia surrounding Mickey’s castle.) The rush of energy you get from Tragic Kingdom’s opening run is enough to keep the album within spitting distance of the ’90s canon, emblematic of a specific time and place. Other highs include sixth single “Sunday Morning,” where the seasoned band easily finds the pocket with nimble, driving percussion, reggae rhythms, and overdubbed harmonies. “End It On This,” one of the only songs credited to Dumont, Kanal, and both Stefanis, is low-key pummeling: Gwen, in all her high-low vocal glory, recalls the last kiss with Tony while the band fires on all cylinders. Every player gets to show off a little with their “thing,” but Dumont is the secret all-star: His tough opening riff sets the song into intricate lockstep. Dumont, much like fellow unlikely-’90s-rock-star Rivers Cuomo, was a Kiss fan and longtime metalhead; you can hear that in his guitar hooks, which lent Tragic Kingdom a fizzy edge. If Weezer were politely challenging the post-grunge alternative landscape with moves copped from the Cars, No Doubt were more like Blondie: a band that came out of a distinct regional punk scene, hit it big with a hybrid new-wave sound, and faced both adoration and criticism largely centered around its platinum-blonde singer. This last factor became a central tension in the narrative of No Doubt once Tragic Kingdom began its long ascent up the charts (it was a diamond-seller by the decade’s end). There was this recursive interview cycle where the band would discuss how Stefani was always the solo cover star, which said magazine would also do; then the band would complain about that in their next interview. They portrayed the meta “photographer singles out Gwen” plotline in the “Don’t Speak” video, and to an extent did it themselves on the album cover, where Gwen poses in front offering up an orange while the guys scatter in the desolate grove behind her. But Gwen’s solo career was always more a question of when. After Tragic Kingdom’s follow-up, 2000’s new-wave coming-of-age Return of Saturn, Stefani struck out on her own with duets alongside techno star Moby and rapper Eve, which suggested she was defined less by a specific sound than a particular attitude. It would take years, well after she appropriated Japanese Harajuku street style and scored more hip-hop hits, for people to recognize the pattern: the Orange County girl with a bindi between her Chola eyebrows had always been borrowing from other cultures and using it to form her identity in messy ways. Taking its cues from two-tone, where Jamaican rhythms met a punk point of view, Tragic Kingdom was only the beginning for Gwen. Back then, she was just an It Grrrl full of contradictions, pulling a little from everywhere and figuring out where to land.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit No Doubt’s 1995 record, an icon of the ska revival and the auspicious beginning of Gwen Stefani’s pop stardom.

The Common Task,Horse Lords,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e67f1623efe060009390721/1:1/w_160/The%20Common%20Task_Horse%20Lords.jpg,2020-03-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/horse-lords-the-common-task/,Northern Spy,"Baltimore’s Horse Lords wield the familiar rock’n’roll toolkit of guitar, bass, drums, and saxophone, and they’ve cited ’70s Bo Diddley as an influence. But this is not a rock band in the traditional sense. Their lineage can be traced more directly to minimalist avant-garde experimentalists such as the Sonic Arts Union and La Monte Young; like Captain Beefheart, they gleefully corrupt the traditions of American blues and folk. Their music finds challenge and beauty in toying with the expectations that accompany familiar tools. Often the most pleasurable way to listen to a record like Horse Lords’ fourth LP, The Common Task, is to surrender, to shed those expectations and follow the music where it takes you. If it sounds similar to the way the human brain responds to certain psychedelics, it’s no accident—the band’s perspective was shaped in no small part by formative experiences with psychotropic drugs. The record’s tension is rooted in anticipation, the only relief the relinquishing of control. Album opener “Fanfare for Effective Freedom” tests this hypothesis almost immediately, stacking staccato harmonies so tightly they make a full arrangement sound sparse. This is drone music with a narrative, full of rising action that builds to an explosive climax and ultimate resolution. But none of the tracks on The Common Task adhere to any real pop song structure; they trace meandering paths that feel logical, even if they can’t quite be called melodic. The players strive for robotic perfection, knowing that, as humans, they are destined to fail. The beauty in a Horse Lords record lies in the results of that failure: intricate, methodical patterns that seem to pulse and shift the longer you stare at them. “After a show recently an audience member told me the music reminded her of weaving,” guitarist Owen Gardner told The Quietus in 2017. “I have never felt better understood.” Some of the band’s most memorable motifs and compositions started as rough sketches on their mixtapes. “Outer East,” the epic opener of 2014’s Hidden Cities, draws from their first mixtape; the spaceship engine hum that appears across The Common Task was first heard on their most recent tape. As their sound has evolved over the past decade, they’ve gradually moved from live-tracking their records with a full band to multi-track recording, a technique that offers more freedom to assemble jams into cohesive statements. And since 2016’s Interventions—their first multi-tracked project—they’ve stopped segregating their modular synthesis in discrete interludes and begun integrating them into their compositions. Their field recordings have also become more sophisticated; the crunchy, resonant textures on “Integral Accident” are so well-designed that in the right context they might pass as Foley art. Much has been made of Horse Lords’ predilection for just intonation tuning and microtonal harmonies (those notes that fall in between the keys of a piano), as well as Gardner’s Mauritanian guitar stylings, which reappear on tracks like “Against Gravity” and “People’s Park.” Their true energy, though, is derived from drummer Sam Haberman, who teeters on the precipice, veering back to the beat just before a song tumbles over the edge. The band has clearly studied percussion from across the African continent (Central Africa’s Aka and Banda music, and Tanzania’s Wagogo, in particular), and on “People’s Park,” they follow those rhythms across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, deconstructing and reimagining the reggaetón riddim far from its original context. “People’s Park,” a reference to Chicago’s revolutionary socialist organization the Young Lords and their community-run space in Lincoln Park, offers a glimpse at Horse Lords’ radical politics. It’s difficult to make political statements in wordless instrumental music; without a visual component, titles must do the heavy lifting. And while it’s nice to know their intent, The Common Task doesn’t scan as a political message. But even apart from its real-world context, the album succeeds as an abstraction. Given even a little bit of time, space, and intention, these compositions are an uncommonly rewarding experience.","Horse Lords songs are intricate, methodical patterns that seem to pulse and shift the longer you stare.

Free Drakeo,Drakeo the Ruler,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6a5ca5969cde000892957d/1:1/w_160/Free%20Drakeo_Drakeo%20The%20Ruler.jpg,2020-03-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drakeo-the-ruler-free-drakeo/,self-released,"After spending almost the entirety of 2017 at Men’s Central Jail in Los Angeles for unlawful possession of a firearm, one of the West Coast’s most exciting and innovative rappers, Drakeo the Ruler, was arrested again in early 2018, due to an alleged connection to a 2016 concert shooting. The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office has come after Drakeo’s entire Stinc Team crew with trumped-up conspiracy charges, the kind that were written into law in order to prosecute mobsters but are now mostly used as a loophole to go after rappers with alleged gang connections. Though Drakeo was found not guilty of murder and attempted murder, he remains behind bars; despite the acquittal, the District Attorney’s office has decided to refile several conspiracy-related charges in what’s clearly become an institutional vendetta against an artist who hasn’t been afraid to speak out and push back with the platform he has. Free Drakeo is Drakeo’s first project since 2017’s Cold Devil, as well as the first since his horrific and seemingly endless incarceration began. The album is culled mostly from scattered loosies, released online from 2016 to 2018. The criminal case has only raised his profile—the album opens with a long supercut of “Free Drakeo” shout-outs from the past two years, before Drakeo directly addresses the intermingling of fame and severe misfortune on “Crime Stoppers,” the only entirely new studio recording on the album (“Crime Stoppers made me famous”). Free Drakeo is bookended by two freestyles, delivered over the phone from prison, that express the kind of self-reflection Drakeo has been forced to do during his time in solitary: “Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill/The type of books a nigga read only in jail.” The compilation charts the evolution of his career in reverse, from something of a nationally-recognized folk hero, to the reigning monarch of his hometown scene, to a lesser-known local favorite itching to break out. The oldest track included is the song responsible for that breakout is “Mr. Get Dough,” a piano-driven Mustard production, featuring Choice & RJMrLa. The track is very of its time, only a few degrees away from 2 Chainz’s 2012 track “I’m Different,” with a club-friendly nursery rhyme rhythm that could be played by Tom Hanks jumping on a giant keyboard. Since then, Drakeo’s flow has developed a twisty complexity, the kind of hurried wordiness preferred by the current wave of rappers coming out of both California and Detroit, from Blueface to BabyTron. He’s racked up co-signing remixes from artists across the country—Shy Glizzy, Lil Yachty, Danny Brown—but this is Drakeo’s first full-length project to feature recruits from outside his home region on the roster: Maxo Kream turns in a verse on “Crime Stoppers,” and the Bay Area is represented by SOB X RBE on “I Could Never” and Yatta on “Fuck Being Humble.” It’s not surprising to hear Drakeo link up with Detroit natives like Rio Da Yung OG on “Black Holocaust” and BandGang Javar on “Touchin”—Detroit is maybe the only other place producing rappers precise and technically proficient enough to keep up with Drakeo bar-for-bar. His delivery is in the tradition of E-40 and Suga Free, but Drakeo lacks their colorful bounce and cartoonishness—his voice is a little more monotone, with a sandpapered edge that makes the playfulness of his rhymes hard to catch on the first listen. Drakeo’s immaculately packaged bars are more “magical realist” in their writing, imaginative and expressionist with the choice of analogies but still cloaked in grit: “I’m not with all that sneak dissing/Chopper rippin’ off limbs and all type of teeth missing/Grim reaper, street sweeper, boy, I'm knee-deep in/Green and red beams like I got these for Christmas.” Free Drakeo is practical in purpose, packaged together to satiate an emerging desire for more music from Drakeo and to assert his continued presence in the marketplace. But it’s also politically motivated, an album that exists as much to raise awareness about Stinc Team’s continued persecution as it does to turn uncollected singles into a streamable commodity. Drakeo is, after all, effectively a political prisoner, the latest example to be made by a carceral society intent on exacting the cruelest revenge against Black men who find success on their own terms. Though it might not offer much fresh material for the already initiated, Free Drakeo has value as a rallying cry, a call to action not just on the part of Drakeo, but of every incarcerated individual in this country who doesn’t have a microphone or streaming platform to reach us from.","The West Coast rapper’s first release since his incarceration is profile-raising look at his rise to folk hero status, culled mostly from scattered loosies released online from 2016 to 2018.

La Vita Nuova,Maria McKee,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6bbdd881d1d3000863d872/1:1/w_160/La%20Vita%20Nuova_Maria%20McKee.jpg,2020-03-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/maria-mckee-la-vita-nuova/,Fire,"In the 13 years since her last album, major changes altered Maria McKee’s approach to making music, along with her sense of self. Biggest among them was coming out as queer. She has become an advocate for queer and trans rights, and she has had to reassess and redefine many relationships, in particular her marriage to filmmaker Jim Akin. There were smaller changes, too: She began splitting her time between Los Angeles and London. She renewed her obsession with the Romantic poets, especially Keats and Swinburne, whose work had inspired her as a teenager. She read a lot of Dante, studied the occult and Western esotericism, and listened to a lot of English folk music. Taking its title from Dante’s 13th century meditation on unrequited love, La Vita Nuova depicts the profound upheaval as McKee embraces her new life and ponders what to do with the old one. Her past is the stuff of great rock memoirs. The daughter of California evangelists, she went to high school in Beverly Hills and mingled with future actors and rock stars. She started a band with her older brother Bryan MacLean, whose tenure with the ’60s band Love endeared his sister to aging hippies and record execs. In the mid ’80s, her band Lone Justice, labeled “cowpunk” at the time, scored a hit with “Ways to Be Wicked,” a song written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell that cast her in an overly sexualized light. As a solo artist she notched a No. 1 hit in the UK with “Show Me Heaven” and stepped into a new role as an alt-country heroine in the early ’90s. But she exploded that persona on 1996’s Life Is Sweet, a pivotal record that traded twang for glam guitars, towering vocals, and more artfully oblique songwriting. It ought to have redefined McKee as an art-rock auteur, but her label did little to promote it, more willing to let it flop than try to market her outside the country-rock market. Soured by such treatment, she was not nearly as prolific in the 21st century, recording only a handful of albums and acting in two of Akin’s films. But 2005’s Peddlin’ Dreams and 2007’s Late December sound weirdly distant and unengaged, as though she made them out of obligation rather than inspiration. Instead of a memoir, McKee has written an epic Romantic poem, although La Vita Nuova is less concerned with such professional travails and more interested in the person who endured them. Using Dante as her own Dylan, Blake as her Bowie, McKee adjusts her songwriting and singing to reflect these more recent changes, favoring a florid lyrical style and a dramatic vocal delivery that often verges on the operatic. This is her most commanding performance since Life Is Sweet, not to mention her most resourceful. On “Page of Cups,” which imports her older brother’s folk-rock philosophizing to the British countryside, she rattles off lines that on the page might appear anachronistic: “And I wonder, is it kind?” she chimes, her voice like a bell. “And will it understand that its provision as a practicality gave mechanism to a stunning bit of alchemy?” It’s bracing, even thrilling, to hear her fit all those syllables into such short melodic lines, rushing her phrasing and savoring the jamb of consonants in words like “practicality” and “mechanism.” Her lyrics as well as her performance may strike some listeners as overly literary, but there is method in these mannerisms. That unwieldiness becomes one of the album’s most appealing traits, especially considering that unwieldy desire is one of the primary themes of La Vita Nuova. “Courage,” the album’s seven-minute centerpiece, conjures a woman whom McKee calls Beatrice, after Dante’s beloved, and describes her as “so winsomely arranged” and “rooted to the earth in such an arresting way.” If the verses evoke the rush of sexual thrall, the chorus is all aching uncertainty: “And I will never have the courage to tell her.” McKee doesn’t belt that confession, although we know that she can. Instead, she turns it into a forceful sigh, which gives more power to her next line: “I must love suffering!” The physical sensation of unrequited desire can be just as powerful as its consummation. There is excitement over new possibilities in these songs, but there is also something like grief for those left behind. La Vita Nuova is an album full of goodbyes: to her brother on “I Just Want to Know That You’re Okay,” the song most rooted in the bright, generous melodies he brought to Love, and ostensibly to her husband (who co-produced the album with her) on the conflicted closer “However Worn.” But the biggest, if not the fondest, farewell is to her old self, to those parts of herself that weren’t compatible with what she calls her new “fanaticism of a daring kind.” McKee’s vita nuova is sweet, but contains just as many puzzles as her old life.","The former Lone Justice singer’s history is the stuff of great rock memoirs, but on her first album in 13 years she looks ahead, celebrating her new life as an out queer woman.

Every Bad,Porridge Radio,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e61297a5580e10008f9f3b2/1:1/w_160/EveryBad.jpg,2020-03-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/porridge-radio-every-bad/,Secretly Canadian,"When Dana Margolin repeats her lyrics like incantations—“I am charming, I am sweet,” “I’m bored to death, let’s argue,” “You will like me when you meet me”—it can be hard to gauge whether she wants to believe these facts, or decimate them with irony. This is among the frictions that power Every Bad, the sometimes twisted, often transcendent, always incendiary album from the Brighton four-piece Porridge Radio. The band’s once-minimal sound—reminiscent, back in 2015, of Frankie Cosmos’ witty Bandcamp-as-diary style—has scaled colossally, transforming into a fever dream that lifts every song. Where 2016’s Rice, Pasta and Other Fillers, recorded in their drummer’s shed, had a dark streak, Every Bad is unabashed sorcery. Margolin’s dusky voice and serrated riffs sometimes recall Polly Jean Harvey, sometimes the attack of early Karen O, but Porridge Radio has devised its own approach to guitar music. The songs balance stoicism with just enough cracked-open ache to feel human. In their quiet-loud dynamics are the exorcisms of a woman who knows that a whisper is often more tormenting than a scream. Every Bad is the sound of a band digging into itself: On the opener, Margolin asks, “What is going on with me?” and she spends 11 songs excavating answers, turning them into melodies that hang gracefully aloft. In three-and-a-half minutes, “Don’t Ask Me Twice” pivots from Lou Reed-style lyrical exposition, to an infernal screamo blast, to seasick balladeering and back. But Porridge Radio’s alchemy is equal parts severity and humor. By the end of “Born Confused,” as Margolin chants “Thank you for leaving me, thank you for making me happy,” her tone devolves from cheerful to deranged to completely shattered, gasping for air, like an absurdist deconstruction of Ariana Grande’s “thank u, next.” And there’s no shortage of attitude on the breezy “Give/Take”: “How do I say ‘no’ without sounding like a little bitch?” Margolin low-key snarls. “I want want want want want want want.” It’s this unwillingness to stick to one sonic or emotional truth that gives life to Porridge Radio’s music. A gothic grandeur courses through Every Bad, a reminder that Porridge Radio are from the same seaside England town where Nick Cave currently resides. Like Cave, Margolin channels vacancy and existential dread with flair—sometimes ornate, sometimes plainspoken—and Porridge Radio’s songs always reach at something just beyond their ending. On the expressive “Nephews,” Margolin sings of wanting to be unmoored like “two nephews under the sea” while watching another person “slip into unconsciousness.” She presents the sea as a place “where your head might explode, and the water is so dark you can’t feel your heart,” reflecting, as she does often across Every Bad, on the meaning of safety, family, and home. Porridge Radio achieve sinister, soul-cleansing extremes, and never more powerfully than on “Sweet.” The dour woman at the center of the song is, in the eyes of her mother, a “nervous wreck” who “bites her nails right down to the flesh”—she could be the protagonist of a bleak Ottessa Moshfegh story. Margolin voices these perceptions of herself with an eerie stillness, augmented by echoes from keyboardist and backing vocalist Georgie Stott, and then her bandmates set them ablaze, unleashing a maximally rendered noise-rock onslaught. It sounds like a call-and-response between Margolin’s internal monologue and thundering abrasion of Sonic Youth proportions, or metal. “And sometimes I am just a child, writing letters to myself,” she sings in calm measures, “Wishing out loud you were dead/And then taking it back.” What could be more brutal? “Sweet” seems to narrate a specifically feminine dynamic, sending up the self-hating expectations so often placed on young women, incinerating them to ash. Still, there’s a sense of togetherness in Porridge Radio’s arrangements—Stott was a fan singing all the words up front before Margolin asked her to join the band—and it adds levity to their heavy sound. A jagged post-punk dance banger, “Long” expresses the breathless agony of having someone waste your time, which is to say your life, but Margolin and Stott scream out “every bitter breath” until the tensions boil over, giving way to comfort: “I’m glad it’s not me.” And while the uncanny merry-go-round waltz that opens “Circling” seems to undermine its message that “everything’s fine,” it becomes a beautiful ode to the healing powers of the sea, which “takes me away/Puts me to sleep/Holds my hand and whispers gently.” “Lilac,” meanwhile, channels the desperation of trying to help someone, and its epic rave-up—“I don’t want to get bitter/I want us to get better/I want us to be kinder/To ourselves and to each other”—is, if didactic, a welcome feeling. For every savage truth on Every Bad, there’s an equal and opposite moment of hope. “Maybe I was born confused,” Margolin speak-sings on the opener, “but I’m not.” Every Bad is full of small self-possessed triumphs like this, a portrait of reality in which neither struggle nor joy is denied, where little is abstracted or prescribed. Using words and noise to create mantras and blow them up, Every Bad is the inspired result of a rock band finding itself in 2020, inhabiting many ways of being.","The second album from the Brighton four-piece is the sound of a band mercilessly digging into itself with a stunning, dynamic performance from singer-songwriter Dana Margolin.

Ferreira,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e62a4bc875ad20009c93d1c/1:1/w_160/purple%20moonlight_R.A.P.%20Ferreira.jpg,2020-03-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rap-ferreira-purple-moonlight-pages/,Ruby Yacht,"Rory Allen Philip Ferreira retired his milo alias in 2018, emerging in 2019 as R.A.P. Ferreira, a play on his name. Under the new moniker, he’s emphasized rapping as independence in action. His Biddeford, Maine storefront and his record label, Ruby Yacht, embody that ideal in structural ways, but his music has always been the proof of concept. On Purple Moonlight Pages he fully embraces his blueprint, rapping with an irresistible freedom and joy so that others may follow. He’s been a rigorous technician since his earliest releases, but as Ferreira he’s more free spirit than showboat. Produced by the Jefferson Park Boys, a Cali jazz trio comprised of producers Kenny Segal, Mike Parvizi, and Aaron Carmack, the record’s mood is beckoning and whimsical. Purple Moonlight Pages is an obstacle course of shifty rhythms, twinkly brass and keys, and gales of noise that Ferreira waltzes, bops, and struts through. Instead of loops, the Jefferson Park Boys provide lively dynamos that lurch and sway like Howl’s Moving Castle. Ferreira has worked closely with Segal for half a decade, and the Jefferson Park Boys provided a beat on his last album as milo, but the production here is wayward, more frayed. Ferreira tackles the implicit challenge with poise, dueling with horns, humming to chords, springing off the downbeat. There's always been a dexterity to his writing, which is intricately syllabic and layered, but here even the knottiest schemes feel casual and loose. “This beat sound like a long walk to the dumpster/Funk like nostrils of muenster/Made myself an apostle of wonder,” he raps on “OMENS & TOTEMS.” On “NONCIPHER,” he ties references to Aquemini and The Wire into a Dadaist bow: “Tell yo’self that ain’t odious, ock/It’s only obvious/That’s bogus whoadie, I’m Bodie Broadus/Singin’ Spottie Otie.” His rhymes have the zip of epiphanies, off-the-cuff yet fully composed. Ferreira’s raps feel built for private delight as much as public spectacle. When he raps something like “Mister lime rickey, tickin’ off beat/Parseltongue-like feet” or “In Tim Hortons, dressed like a Transformer/Talking ’bout Jacob Lawrence portraits,” his word choices are appreciable for both their meaning and their mouthfeel. He lacks the quantum unpredictability of Young Thug, but he feels equally unbothered, prioritizing fun and caprice over structure. “Ambiguity defeat the pattern recognition,” he says on “RO TALK.” and it’s the closest he comes to spelling out his strategy. One of the starkest shifts here is Ferreira’s warm and puckish demeanor. “LAUNDRY” is a bouncy ode to chores. Instead of the wife-guy strain of J. Cole’s “Folding Clothes,” Ferreira leans into the endearing corniness of domestic bliss: “I’m just humming in the kitchen/My son listening/He’s staring at me with them wide ole eyes.” On “LEAVING HELL,” he ambles out of meter to share an anecdote about a time he pooped at a gas station and read a two-part exchange about the purpose of life that was carved on the stall. As milo, he favored a cold deadpan that lent itself to searing humor and heady metaphysics but lacked the whimsy and joy on display here. His newfound warmth makes his sermonizing feel informal and intimate, like he’s sharing advice while cutting your hair. Purple Moonlight Pages follows in the footsteps of recent records like Some Rap Songs, Red Burns, and When I Get Home, which, to different ends, used jazz’s esoteric rhythms in service of fostering community and self-recognition. Jazz has long been an easy refuge for artists seeking to mine a sense of black authenticity or to signal a “refined” palette, but these records don't feel born of posturing. Instead, they are attempts to unspool and unlearn, to map the future by probing the past. What’s missing from the record is a sense of interaction with the larger world. Ferreira’s self-possession and nimbleness play out in his performances, but his acrobatics rarely engage with rap outside his indie sphere, in lingo or in form. Compared to JPEGMAFIA’s web trawling or even the anthropological noir of fellow Kenny Segal collaborator billy woods, Ferreira feels like he’s on an island. While he never claims himself the GOAT and has repeatedly said he’s happy to be underground, his freedom feels conditional. Purple Moonlight Pages shows him at ease. What does he sound like under pressure?","R.A.P. Ferreira (formerly milo) makes his most free-spirited project yet, rapping gleefully over lively and wayward production.

It’s Easy to Feel Like a Nobody When You’re Living in The City,Juiceboxxx,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e67f45fbe35b2000813b0c6/1:1/w_160/It's%20Easy%20to%20Feel..._Juiceboxxx.jpg,2020-03-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juiceboxxx-its-easy-to-feel-like-a-nobody-when-youre-living-in-the-city/,Dangerbird,"To his converts, Juiceboxxx is a DIY legend, celebrated for the intensely physical shows he’s been performing since the early ’00s, when he was a 14-year-old getting dropped off at gigs from the Milwaukee suburbs by his parents. One journalist was so moved by Juice’s devotion to his craft he penned an entire book about him. In other corners of the internet, though, Juiceboxxx is more infamous for a disastrous TV news performance that’s forever branded him in Google searches as “the worst rapper ever.” Bloggers ripped him mercilessly, and within weeks comedians Chelsea Handler and Chris Hardwick were dunking on him, too (“Yo, Pewaukee in the house!” Hardwick quipped on @midnight). Six years later, that fail footage is no less painful to watch, although in a certain light Juiceboxxx’s performance is also strangely inspiring. After offering the anchors a complimentary can of Thunder Zone, the energy drink he was hocking at the time, he doesn’t just bomb. He bombs with gusto, committing fully to his affable party-starter routine even as he wrestles with a sadistic sound mix and the sinking realization that an act that slays in a basement full of sweaty fans doesn’t translate to an empty stage of a news broadcast. That down-with-the-ship attitude has defined everything he’s recorded since—if public humiliation on that scale doesn’t shake your dedication, then maybe nothing can. These days Juiceboxxx no longer tours the country on a Greyhound with an iPod as his DJ, though. He’s traded it for a two-piece backing band, which conjured the guitar-drenched rap early Beastie Boys on his 2017 effort Freaked Out American Loser. His new It’s Easy To Feel Like a Nobody When You’re Living in The City goes one step further, ditching hip-hop almost entirely but keeping the guitars. Recorded with Wavves/Jay Reatard bassist Stephen Pope, it’s a brisk power-pop record about loving what you do but hating the toll it takes. “Have I wasted all my life in the basement?” Juiceboxxx wonders on the lifer’s lament “In The Basement,” a typically revved-up number featuring some unmistakable synths from The Rentals’ Matt Sharp. It’s Juiceboxxx’s catchiest song yet, though the album gives it some competition. Pitched somewhere between Sum 41 and the Ramones, opener “Coinstar Song” is all fist pumps, while “Running So Deep,” with its crunchy riff and giddy cowbell claps, plays like a mall-punk homage to ’80s John Mellencamp. These songs find Juiceboxxx down and out, surviving on frozen pizzas and the adulation of an audience that isn’t growing any bigger.
And while he mostly plays his defeats for entertainment, his lyrics make enough references to mental health to imply that it’s not only his career at stake. It’s Easy to Feel Like a Nobody walks a fine line, taking Juiceboxxx’s quandaries seriously without disrupting the stay-true-to-yourself positivity that’s always been the heart of his act. Even the title track, despite its bummer sentiment, plays out as uplifting Lou Reed-style testimonial about the rejuvenating power of rock ‘n’ roll. Throughout the album Juiceboxxx ponders trading it all in for something closer resembling a normal life, but always just as quickly rules out the option. “Kids Are Looking” speaks most directly to the heart of his decision to keep at it, an obligation to pay forward the feeling of belonging he found at punk shows as a teenager. “It’s like a call that’s telling us we’re not alone,” he sings. A touring artist’s life might not be glamorous, It’s Easy to Feel Like a Nobody argues, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t noble.","The revered and ridiculed DIY legend makes a brisk power-pop record about loving what you do but hating the toll it takes.

the One EP,HAWA,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e62b3bf875ad20009c93d57/1:1/w_160/the%20One_HAWA.jpg,2020-03-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hawa-the-one-ep/,b4,"There’s a moment in Hawa’s first music video, released in October 2018, when she pushes back the long sleeve of a baggy red tee to reveal her boney, brown wrist. “See these rocks on my wrist, yeah they real son,” she sing-raps in an accent that’s a melange of the Guinean, French, German, and American voices she’s heard growing up around the world. The thing about her wrist, though, is that it’s bare. She boasts about keeping $50 million in the safe and “a chopper tucked” in her waistband, but there’s no sign of wealth or a weapon. There’s just a rascally teenager having a good time. Now 19 years old and based in New York City, Hawa is releasing her debut EP, the One, with b4, an imprint of the venerable indie label 4AD. She’s still flexing, but across the eight-song collection, her boasts feel less real than her preoccupation with romance and lust. Her bars, swaggy but often unsurprising, aren’t what’s most impressive. Instead, it’s her commitment to escaping the trappings of popular rap and R&B with intricate melodies and lush soundscapes, helmed by producer Tony Seltzer and a small, eclectic group of beatmakers. In the fifth grade, Hawa intercepted a letter to her parents she feared was filled with bad news about her behavior. Instead, it was an invitation to join a New York Philharmonic composition program for children. She enrolled, and she excelled. By 15, ensembles in China and Venezuela were performing her pieces. Perhaps this is why Hawa’s low yet airy voice sounds made to be manipulated—to be pitched up, brought down, layered and harmonized. The One proves she’s a composer first and a songwriter second; lyrics about love and bad bitches eventually begin to feel repetitive. But Hawa’s melodies are so strong and so smooth that it’s easy for boring lines like, “I’m making her wet, wet like a sink” to go uninterrogated. The One sounds thoughtful and unified, a series of tiny worlds within the same universe of delicate keys, billowing synths, and subtle 808s. Producer Cadenza leans into his bashment and dancehall expertise on the sultry “My Love,” building record scratches, twinkles, and chimes into a tropical playground. Producer Carlos Truly, who plays guitar and synthesizer in the indie band Ava Luna, uses both with groove and restraint on the EP’s dreamy “Outro.” Hawa has predecessors in style and subject matter: When she makes threats, her droney sing-rapping calls to mind Dej Loaf. Her simple rhymes about loving women echo Kodie Shane’s Young HeartThrob. When she murmurs lines like, “She in love, but I just pretend,” her caddish tendencies resemble those of Brent Faiyaz. Yet, the One feels new because Hawa approaches these moments from different angles. It’s both tender and bold, both atmospheric and focused. Hawa’s classical training gives her a unique perspective on these contrasting elements, and her natural musical acuity allows her to navigate them with uncommon grace.","The classically trained 19-year-old musician stands out less for her bars than for intricate melodies and lush soundscapes that push the boundaries of popular rap and R&B.

The Long Goodbye,Riz Ahmed,by: Bhanuj Kappal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e62aca05efdff0008ac725f/1:1/w_160/The%20Long%20Goodbye_Riz%20Ahmed.jpg,2020-03-12 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/riz-ahmed-the-long-goodbye/,Mongrel,"There’s always been a fire in the work of the British-Pakistani actor, musician, and activist Riz Ahmed. In 2006, the same year in which he made his film debut in critically acclaimed docu-drama The Road To Guantanamo, he ruffled feathers in the UK as Riz MC with “Post 9/11 Blues,” a satirical rap song so caustic that it was temporarily banned from radio. On “I Ain’t Being Racist But…,” the spoken-word monologue that closes out his 2016 mixtape Englistan, he lampoons the hateful shibboleths of white supremacism with savage fury. His rise to Hollywood stardom did little to dampen the flames, as he took on roles/played characters like the coldly manipulative Omar in 2010’s Four Lions to his Emmy-award winning performance as Nasir Khan, a Muslim man accused of murder in HBO’s The Night Of. But rarely has his rage been as incandescent and pointed as on his second album, The Long Goodbye, his first project under his full name. The ambitious concept album reframes the UK’s relationship with British Asians as a “toxic and abusive” love affair that has reached its breaking point in the wake of Brexit and the rise of the far-right. On its face, equating the weight of colonial trauma with a fictional woman is a tough sell, and in less assured hands it could easily come off as insensitive. But it’s an inspired move for Ahmed, a rapper with a PPE (Philosophy, Politics, and Economics) degree from Oxford whose lyrics often read like they should come with footnotes. The break-up album format allows him to transform the political into the personal. The dispassionate, sanitizing gaze of academic history gives way to an intimate, heart-wrenching account of the human toll inflicted by the Empire on South Asia and its diaspora. Opener “The Break Up (Shikwa)”—set to a melismatic qawwali vocal sample—sets the tone with a monologue that traces the trauma caused by centuries of conquest, colonialism, and exploitation. The East India Company becomes a “stray pale chick” named Britney who “came to trade” but then refused to leave. The British Raj’s brutal policies are recast as acts of violence (“Beat me red and blue ’til I knew right was white and not brown”), and Partition becomes a parting act of spite (“Carved a scar down my middle just to leave me stretched out”). Ahmed’s voice turns increasingly frantic as he comes home one day to find himself locked out, his dreams of a multicultural future replaced by the grim reality of homelessness. “Britney, if you break up with me I might just break up,” he pleads, his voice cracking. “This will either be the end of me or be the wake-up.” That idea of finding oneself in a cultural “no man’s land” is a source of both anxiety and optimism throughout the record. The anxiety is self-explanatory, but the optimism comes from the possibility of staking claim to this middle ground between “us” and “them.” While Ahmed has played around with this idea of a “third culture” identity earlier, such as on Cashmere’s “Half Moghul Half Mowgli” (and much of Englistan), there’s a renewed sense of topical urgency here. “Toba Tek Singh” takes its name from a short story by celebrated Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto, about the absurdity of waking up to find that your country is no longer your own. Its central protagonist is a Sikh inmate of a “lunatic asylum” in Lahore who is being sent to India post-Partition. But he refuses to choose between the two new countries, falling to the ground in the “no man’s land” between the borders. It’s a story about the trauma of displacement, of being unmoored from your home and identity. Ahmed’s interpretation shares that pain, though he tries to put on a brave face. “Stranded, I’ll make a stand in one place,” he raps on the final verse. “I’ll dig my heels in, so what’s my damn name?” A similar blend of despair and bravado runs through “Fast Lava,” where Ahmed delivers rapid-fire verses over a fevered jungle beat hammered out of temple bells, chimtas (traditional musical tongs from South Asia), and a bone-rattling bass drum. “I spit my truth and it’s brown,” he declares, paying homage to his Pakistani heritage. “Can I Live” drops the history lessons in favor of a harrowing portrait of a community with its back against the wall. “Please just let me live for two minutes,” Ahmed sings, begging for a reprieve from the Islamophobia, the hate crimes, the exhausting pressures of being one of the Western world’s scariest bogeymen. But he already knows that it’s not going to happen. Lines like, “Hope my people don’t just end up as a memory,” and, “My people floating face down, sinking in sand,” land particularly hard, eerie echoes of the social media posts and news headlines emerging from New Delhi over the last few weeks, after Hindu nationalist mobs carried out a pogrom on Muslim communities in the Indian capital with the alleged complicity of the police. This is heavy stuff, but Ahmed’s wry wit and laser-focused delivery ensures that it doesn’t feel overwrought. He may be heartbroken but he’s no victim. The tide turns on the second half of the album, as Ahmed progresses from anger and bargaining to acceptance. The task of carrying on the break-up metaphor falls on the shoulders of the surprisingly fun skits peppered through the album—phoned-in messages of relationship advice from brown and black luminaries including Mindy Kaling, Hassan Minhaj, and Mahershala Ali. Ahmed regains some of his swagger on tracks like “Mogambo” and “Deal With It,” having a little more fun as he takes barbs thrown at British Muslims and turns them into thorny badges of honor. It’s reminiscent of the comic villainy of his rap duo with Heems, Swet Shop Boys, though the humor here has a darker, more brittle edge. That’s only natural, given everything that’s happened in the last four years. The early idealism of the #Resistance has curdled into bitterness and fatalism, the light at the end of the tunnel slips further and further away. Even the jokes have barbs now: “And my cock it just grow/When they kick us in the balls,” he raps on “Mogambo,” an iron fist wrapped in locker room banter. Swet Shop Boys producer Redinho’s production mirrors the anxiety—the shehnais, 808s, synth-sitars, and bhangra drums are now used to unsettle rather than uplift, stabbing and clashing bursts of sound to get your blood up. On the rare occasion that the record strays into more commercial territory, such as rhythm-and-bhangra cut “Any Day” (featuring a heavily Auto-Tuned Jay Sean), the attempt falls flat. The Long Goodbye is a compelling, unapologetic account of what it feels like to be brown and British in 2020—Mo Salah and “random” searches, bhangra nights and mosque stabbings, “the spoils and the scars.” Ahmed is open to the idea of a rapprochement with his country, but now on his terms, not those dictated by the erstwhile Empire or its UKIP heirs. He’s tired of playing the good immigrant just to claim a piece of what he’s already owed. While the sentiment is enough to make the album worth listening to, Ahmed’s ability to weave experience and cultural touchstones into an affecting tale of heartache, loss, and redemption is something of a marvel. After all, in these years of Brexit, pogroms, and “build the wall,” who doesn’t feel a little estranged from their country right now?","While walking a tightrope across a daring concept album, rapper Riz Ahmed offers compelling, unapologetic account of what it truly feels like to be brown and British in 2020.

CHILOMBO,Jhené Aiko,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e58124565d24e000822a370/1:1/w_160/CHILOMBO_Jhene%20Aiko.jpeg,2020-03-12 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jhene-aiko-chilombo/,Def Jam,"Jhené Aiko has a knack for smooth melodies that waft over wispy production like air kisses, lithe and sensual yet frictionless. Her calling card is clear-eyed storytelling that, like the wise best friend in a rom-com, pinpoints precisely why a romance failed or succeeded. Her best songs accent that clarity with narrative or vocal contrasts (often provided by guests, but sometimes Aiko herself), but on Chilombo the formula is pushed to its limit. Despite confident, freeform performances, Aiko’s music too often lacks a pulse. Compared to the multimedia odyssey of Trip, which was accompanied by a poetry book and short film, Chilombo is leaner and more grounded. Instead of heady explorations of grief, Aiko focuses on the standard peaks and valleys of life post-breakup. The record is loosely about a woman enduring heartbreak and emerging stronger, and the opening suite of songs wears that framework lightly. On “Triggered (Freestyle),” Aiko fumes over reminders of the old relationship: “Trying to let the time kill/All our memories/All you meant to me/All that history/All that’s history,” she croons, each riff on “all” cutting deeper. On “B.S.” she glows with self-satisfaction over a ticking hi-hat: “Flexin on my exes in my Model X/Pretty little skinny little bitty/Body Model X.” By the end of the song she’s so charged up that seeing her replacement “boosts her self-esteem.” This suite ends with “P*$$Y Fairy (OTW),” which opens with a yearning, bass-boosted intro then blossoms into a twinkling ode to Aiko’s sexual prowess. “I know you love fucking me,” she declares, turning a passive construction into a boast. The song is full of similarly odd flips in perspective (“That dick make me so proud”), blurring who is giving and receiving pleasure like a titillating funhouse mirror. Unfortunately, everything that makes that opening run charismatic and personable is abandoned as Chilombo stretches on. The jarring “Happiness over Everything (H.O.E.)” is a retread of “Hoe,” from her debut mixtape Sailing Souls. The verses are improved from the hokey original, but it’s weird to hear the self-proclaimed “pussy fairy” turn coy and inert. “Just don’t get the wrong impression,” Aiko pleads, her charm suddenly depleted like Cinderella at midnight. On “10k Hours,” Aiko and Nas turn Malcolm Gladwell’s magic number into a dry index of personal history. “Ten thousand hours turned to ten thousand bridal flowers,” Nas raps flatly about his marriage to Kelis, sounding bored of his own story. Against her feathery melodies, there’s no traction, no dynamism. The production plays a huge role in that inertia. Produced almost entirely by Lejkeys and the duo Fisticuffs, the album is soft and hushed, dulled percussion and starry keys drifting in a vacuum. Aiko is clearly a student of Quiet Storm, a format that gives the voice space to contract and expand in carnal waves. And her voice certainly has that power; the vocal runs on “Surrender” are variously controlled and indulgent, evaporating into the cloudy synths and condensing beneath them as a breathy purr. But the tempo never rises above a resting heart rate, the acoustic flourishes never dictate the shapes of songs, and Aiko’s performances aren’t consistently magnetic. There’s an audience and a market for Aiko’s atmospheric take on R&B, but the most interesting aspects of her music have always been rooted in her malleability. Like Jeremih, Ty Dolla $ign, and other R&B artists who straddle genres, she’s got the fluency to provide more than a big hook or play foil to another star. Whether she’s cooing, humming, or rapping, she brings an easygoing grace and playfulness that tends to open up songs. Chilombo gestures at this larger skill set, but settles for good vibes. It’s very chill, and nothing else.

Silver Landings,Mandy Moore,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e67ed615efdff0008ac762e/1:1/w_160/Silver%20Landings_Mandy%20Moore.jpg,2020-03-12 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mandy-moore-silver-landings/,Verve Forecast,"At the start of the last decade, Mandy Moore began working on her seventh album with her then-husband Ryan Adams. It never materialized. Moore said that she and Adams wrote songs together that Adams never scheduled the studio time to record. He allegedly prevented her from trying to hire other producers to help complete the album, and would tell her she wasn’t a real musician because she couldn’t play an instrument. She didn’t finish the record, and her music career stalled out; she was writing, she was working, yet nothing was happening. The years got swallowed up. Moore and Adams divorced in 2016, and that year she joined the cast of the time-jumping romantic drama This is Us. As the show’s success grew astronomically, Moore’s music seemed to shrink to an equally distant point in the rearview mirror. Where do our past selves go? How can we possibly start all over again, when so much time has passed and the world around us has warped out of recognition? These are the questions that stir like dust through the air of Moore’s seventh album and first in almost 11 years, Silver Landings. She abandoned the material she wrote with Adams and instead co-wrote every song on the record with Dawes’ Taylor Goldsmith, whom she married in 2018. She also brought back producer Mike Viola, who helmed her previous album, 2009’s Amanda Leigh. Surrounding herself with this adopted musical family gives the album a feeling of domestic warmth and security. But Moore’s lyrics speak from a shakier place; she can’t experience the security of the present moment without also seeing it crash into the insecurity of the next. That’s where the album’s lead single, “When I Wasn’t Watching,” finds her. “Where was I when this was going down?” Moore sighs. “Maybe sleeping in/Maybe out of town.” Potential lives she could’ve lived flicker across her mind: “How do I start to retrace the steps I haven’t even taken yet?” Moore captures this stranded, disembodied feeling with remarkable economy and clarity, and the music sounds as brimming with shadow-selves as she is. “My favorite version of me disappeared/Through longer days and shorter years”—If she’s not singing or acting, Moore seems to ask, if instead she remains anchored forever to the current second, who, or what, is left over? If there’s a shared theme among the songs on Silver Landings, it’s who you become when the life around you falls apart and you have to build a new one from the ruins of the last. She never focuses on the damage directly, but instead on the first, tentative steps one takes afterwards, when at any minute it feels like the ground might crumble away beneath you. “Easy Target,” co-written with former Death Cab for Cutie member Chris Walla, could be a sequel to “When I Wasn’t Watching” even though it precedes it in the track list, Moore trying to reenter the world with all of her vulnerability intact. “Through all of the noise,” she sings, “going out on a limb again,” the instruments glittering around her as they would in a Fleetwood Mac song. The whole album kind of sounds like Fleetwood Mac, or at least descended from the same 1970s Los Angeles studios that incubated similarly crisp records by Jackson Browne and The Eagles, glassy marbles of sound with storm clouds of color swirling inside. Guitars ripple, organs pour into the ear. The kick drum is a soft implosion. The recording is so clear you can hear acoustic guitar strings creak like door hinges as fingers shift around on them in “Forgiveness,” the closest the record comes to expressing bitterness. “I wanted to be good enough for you,” she sings, “until it wasn’t good enough for me.” The song moves patiently beneath her as her resentment slowly thickens over four minutes. But just as the past has a way of clarifying the degree to which someone hurt you, it can make your feelings toward other parts of your life more tangled and unfocused. On “Fifteen,” Moore attempts to survey the early teen-pop career she gradually left behind. When she debuted in 1999 with the single “Candy,” Moore entered the teen-pop cosmos alongside Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, and Christina Aguilera. Her life changed very rapidly. “Missed prom/Missed graduation/No college in the fall,” she sings—as if she both longs for and can’t imagine having the normal life she didn’t get to live—“On the road with a boy band singing for the people in the mall.” The deadpan quality of these details would come off as cynical and embarrassed about this phase in her life if she didn’t also seem to feel affection for her own naivete: “No regrets, with a few exceptions/Every wrong turn was the right direction.” If anything “Fifteen” embodies the true purpose of Moore’s new music: to extend her hand backwards through time to love and forgive herself.","The former teen-pop star’s rueful new album explores who you become when the life around you falls apart and you have to build a new one from the ruins of the last.

Youth Pastoral,Ben Seretan,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e62a7023efe06000939038b/1:1/w_160/Youth%20Pastoral_Ben%20Seretan.jpg,2020-03-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ben-seretan-youth-pastoral/,Whatever's Clever,"Breakup albums leave their creator in the awkward, ironic position of putting the source of their pain on a pedestal. The greater the heartbreak, the greater the catharsis, and all of it—the self-examination, the inventory of shortcomings, the mourning, the acceptance, the hope—is contingent on understanding why someone willingly invested so much in a relationship in the first place. There’s a fairly traditional story of codependence couched within Youth Pastoral, but it’s secondary to Ben Seretan’s larger reckoning of his break from evangelical Christianity, a lifestyle that guides every moment of a person’s life and leaves a gaping void when it’s gone. More than a simple breakup album, Youth Pastoral fits into a small ex-religious subgenre typified by the Heathen podcast, Jamie Lee Finch’s book You Are Your Own, and David Bazan’s Strange Negotiations documentary. You can’t just go on Tinder and find a rebound spirituality. A traditional, solo-credited singer-songwriter album wasn’t necessarily a given for Seretan. After years of personal upheaval following the release of 2016’s Bowl of Plums, Seretan bounced back with My Life’s Work, a 24-hour, 48-track collection of vividly titled ambient pieces (“Stoned and Slackjawed Under the Ferris Wheel, “I Want to Taste the Pondwater on You”). His writing on Youth Pastoral doesn’t mimic the breathless essays that accompanied My Life’s Work, which captured a man trying to make up for an entire circumspect youth in a couple of years. But he does capture the spirit of self-rediscovery: “Filled to the brim with something fine, one spark and I’ll explode,” he coos in the first line. Throughout Youth Pastoral, Seretan recognizes the conflation of profane and sacred desires that turned lovers into gods and vice versa. His confessions (“I remade myself to your taste,” “I’m your good boy, am I your good boy?”) are intentionally open-ended, speaking in overtly religious terms of surrender and supplication. No longer willing to make a single entity his higher power, Seretan finds salvation in community and earthly, platonic friendship. His vulnerable, keening voice is the primary emotional vessel on Youth Pastoral, but not its only one: Devra Freelander, a multimedia artist who was tragically killed before the album’s release, provides harmony vocals throughout. The core of the new album is similar to that of Bowl of Plums or Seretan’s self-titled debut: full of variously wooly and weary songs with freak-folk melodies vining over gnarled, knuckled guitar, as if Devendra Banhart and Mark Kozelek had become drinking buddies for a spell in 2003. Abetted by more than a dozen contributors adding heraldic horns, trilling flutes, and theater-troupe harmonies, Youth Pastoral hews towards the potluck folk of the mid-’00s, dabbling in stoned soft-rock, Laurel Canyon revivalism, and an avowed psychic connection to Phantom Planet. Seretan doesn’t set out to completely negate his evangelical upbringing; in Youth Pastoral’s most captivating moments, he seems to honor it. In the album’s pivotal scene, he’s baptized in the Pacific Ocean as a teen, and much of the record sounds as if it’s been exfoliated by a sea salt bath. The insistent ticking of cymbals on “1 Of” and “Holding Up the Sun” evoke a state of weightlessness, as if anticipating the same release from inhibitions typically associated with religious transformation. “Everything’s gonna be alright/You shine a little light for me… Shine a light!” Seretan screams towards the end of “Holding Up the Sun,” and whether the mimicry of a praise chorus is meant as homage or sarcasm, it doesn’t really matter. Seretan once found purpose in fundamentalism. Now he’s found freedom in the realization that heaven is what you make it.","With his vulnerable, keening voice as the primary emotional vessel, the New York-based songwriter reckons with his break from evangelical Christianity.

Suga,Megan Thee Stallion,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6293273efe060009390388/1:1/w_160/Suga_Megan%20Thee%20Stallion.jpg,2020-03-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/megan-thee-stallion-suga/,1501 Certified 300,"Megan Thee Stallion did not originally intend to put out Suga last week. She had hoped to drop the project on May 2—her late mother’s birthday—and claim it as her debut album after last summer’s breakout mixtape Fever. Draped in a dark, pillowy fur on The Breakfast Club last Friday morning, she course-corrected. “I’m still working on my ‘album,’” she said, curling her fingers into air quotes. “I had to hurry up and put out an EP.” Why? Potentially because her next opportunity to release music on her own terms was foggy. On March 1, Megan claimed that her label, 1501 Certified Entertainment, was blocking her from putting out songs. The next day, she sued 1501, seeking to terminate her deal; a Texas judge granted her a temporary restraining order against the label, allowing the album to be released. Tight and satisfying, Suga is a reminder that Megan is who she’s always told us she was, even as she grapples with what it means to be herself in public. When Megan Thee Stallion first caught eyes in 2017 with her bombastic “Stalli Freestyle,” she declared herself a money-making, man-taking, sex-positive powerhouse. In just two years, her cutthroat bars and candid nature turned her into a lyrical frontrunner in hip-hop and a viral sensation. Suga takes stock of all the things that have changed for the 25-year-old, with millions “tuned the fuck in” to her professional and personal lives as she navigates business, pleasure, and loss. Like Lil Kim, Beyoncé, and Nicki Minaj before her, Megan channels rage, pomp, and sensuality through alter egos. If her alter ego Tina Snow was a boss—grown, sexy, and intimidating—and Hot Girl Meg was her more debaucherous side, Suga is “a girl who’s going through it but getting through it.” Megan tackles fame and pain with sharp, clear raps. Album starter “Ain’t Equal” jumps into her new circumstances: life under the microscope, without her mother or great-grandmother’s support. Though she spent the past year getting friendly with lots of women across entertainment, pouring dark liquor down the throats of Doja Cat, Lizzo, and Summer Walker, Megan is skeptical of new friends on Suga: “You bitches is weird, I don’t wanna hang,” she cooly raps on the chorus of “Stop Playing.” She’s also spent the year being romantically linked to musicians, an athlete, and an actor. But she embraces her sexuality, even if she resents the constant speculation around it. On “Captain Hook,” she spells it out simply: “I like to drink and I like to have sex.” The song is a showcase everything Megan has built her career on: energy, humor, brashness. “Dance on the dick, now you been served/I like a dick with a little bit of curve/Hit this pussy with an uppercut/Call that nigga Captain Hook!” she says, over swashbuckling sound effects. Though when she emulates Gunna’s flow on “Stop Playing,” it turns into a new, infectious kind of experimentation. The Neptunes-produced track is one of several moments where Megan dabbles with something calmer and more plush. On Suga, she shakes out of the comfort zone that found her frequently sampling down-south acts, and instead heads west. She enlists Kehlani on the upbeat G-funk track “Hit My Phone” and interpolates Tupac’s “Rather Be Ya Nigga” on the vulnerable “B.I.T.C.H.” Megan also commits to more melodic overtones, in contrast to the straightforward spitting on her more recognized songs. Fully outfitted in Auto-Tune and complemented by a choir sample, Megan gives herself a lightly profane pep talk and sends up a prayer on “Crying in the Car,” a tender earworm. R&B isn’t where Meg shines brightest—it can sound basic—but together, “Crying in the Car,” “B.I.T.C.H.,” and “What I Need” illustrate that Megan Thee Stallion is becoming more than a sex symbol, wig-splitter, and party starter. Megan occasionally struggles to package new truths about her social status in the whip-smart ways she did her old ones. As far as calling someone corny goes, “Had to X some cheesy niggas out my circle like a pizza” (from “Savage”) is no “Bitch, keep talking that shit from your Honda.” But at only 24 minutes long, Suga avoids the bloating that plagued Fever, and a good-not-great song like “Rich” is over too quickly to complain much. Suga may not be remembered as a keystone in Megan Thee Stallion’s catalog, but it’s a fine portrait of an artist embracing her full self as her world changes drastically.","The relatively short project from the Houston rapper reasserts her absolute domination on the mic and takes her to new melodic spaces to mixed effect.

Wave Pack,Max B,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e62afd0a967e20009bdb184/1:1/w_160/Wave%20Pack_Max%20B.jpg,2020-03-11 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/max-b-wave-pack/,EMGPhase One Network,"Max B grew up in a Harlem apartment building, a few floors beneath Cam’ron. When he was still a teenager, he was locked up on a robbery charge. He came home eight years later, in 2005, to a Harlem that Cam had refitted with after-market Range Rover paint and furs that looked like Easter decorations. Cam hooked Max up with Jim Jones; Max rapped with Jones and wrote for him; his own music quickly emerged as some of the strangest and most irresistible rap that New York had produced in the new century. On September 21, 2006, a man was shot and killed during a botched robbery in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Max was alleged to have helped plan the heist and was charged with murder. He sat in jail for months until the summer of 2007, when Max sold his publishing to Jones to pay his bail. Once out, he began writing and recording at a delirious clip. Two summers later, in 2009, he was found guilty on nine of 11 counts. In September of that year, he was sentenced to 75 years in prison. Wave Pack, a 26-song compilation released by EMG last week, functions mostly as a survey of Max’s work in the period between his release on bail and his 2009 conviction, songs which he had released nearly as soon as they were recorded. (Five of the tracks compiled here are taken from Vigilante Season, the album Amalgam Digital issued in 2011.) The effect is to create an immersive 101-minute block that includes none of Max’s formative work, inasmuch as Max has formative work: more than any of his New York contemporaries, he seemed to have been beamed in fully formed, from a wavier place. Most of the songs here have been smartly remastered, in a way that makes them clearer and more punishing but retains the atonal muddiness that’s central to his aesthetic. As Guru said, it’s mostly the voice: Max’s vocals are often drowned in distortion and/or doubled until they sound like he’s singing through a breathing machine. Together with the producer Dame Grease, he built a style that imagines lullabies filtered through hell, or at least through a cell block.  There are hints in Max’s catalog of the Auto-Tuned pop-rap that dominated radio in the late ’00s (for an example, see Vigilante Season’s “Baby I Need More,” which is not included here) but for most of this 2007-09 period, he was mutating the sounds of early-’00s New York street rappers like 50 Cent into something both grimier and poppier. Listening to Max feels like being on downers in your most expensive clothes. Everything is pained; he sounds as mournful recalling “very nice girls” on “Porno Muzik” as he does lamenting the injustice of his verdict (from “Lord Is Tryin’ To Tell You Something”: “I’m innocent! Wasn’t even there”). While it skews toward songs from the latter half of his brief period of freedom, Wave Pack still functions as a near-comprehensive primer on Max’s sound. There are the acidic hits from his beloved San Diego sessions (“Try Me,” “Blow Me a Dub”) and playful taunts from his series of Public Domain tapes. And save for one verse from Mak Mustard, Wave Pack smartly eschews features. Max was a prolific collaborator—his mixtapes with French Montana are famous, and even those pale in comparison to his work with the late Stack Bundles—but the best road into his world is exposure therapy, letting the wave wash over you. Wave Pack opens with two new songs: a shimmering bit of funk called ”Phenomenon” and “Run Homeboy Run,” which under different circumstances might play as a defiant first-day-out dispatch. (It is an unbelievable feat of tonal control to describe a 75-year sentence as a judge throwing you an elbow, and then to rap that line cockily through a jail phone.) Last summer, Max announced that his sentence has been reduced, and that he could be released some time in 2021. He’ll return to a rap industry that has never successfully recreated him, despite the traces of his DNA that can be found in many rappers who have debuted in his absence. But in revisiting Max’s music, you find that it’s harder to draw direct lines of influence than it is to see his work as something mostly alien, ahead of its time but mostly unconcerned with time in the first place.","This 26-song compilation surveys the brief period, between 2007 and 2009, when the Harlem rapper remolded rap in his wavy image.

Ceremony,Phantogram,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5fdb6d58ffb900080a47a5/1:1/w_160/Phantogram%20ceremony.jpg,2020-03-11 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phantogram-ceremony/,Republic,"Phantogram thrive on discomfort. The New York duo’s 2010 debut Eyelid Movies revealed them as masters of tension: their prickly, minimalist trip-hop moved at its own pace, their lyrics full of barbed, abstract images that hinted at bigger stories the band refused to tell. As they’ve crossed over into a mainstream space via Republic Records, Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter have remained at their best when they’ve refused to let go of this strangeness—as with their excellent, twisted 2016 single “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore,” a pop song about addiction that opens with a line about teeth falling out of your head. But on their bombastic fourth studio album, Ceremony, the band sound thoroughly comfortable. The album bounds into life with the soul-sampling “Dear God,” perhaps the closest thing there’s ever been to a happy Phantogram song. It’s followed by a run of short, sharp singles, each burying a streak of sorrow below shiny surfaces. The synth-dazzled “Into Happiness,” the best of the bunch, beautifully undercuts its own hook (“Fall into happiness”) with the next line (“Wish you could be here”). Mostly, though, these songs feel impatient, front-loaded with choruses and stacked on top of one another. Perhaps Barthel is catering to the streaming-age trend towards shorter songs and swifter hooks, but she flattens the nuance of her non-linear, evocative songwriting. On the jagged “In A Spiral,” she delivers the non-committal social commentary “I’m a meme/On a feed/In a spiral”; “Love Me Now,” a brass-driven song at the heart of the record, leans too heavily into the repetition of its hook. The record’s most powerful moments come in its second, stranger half. On “Glowing,” Barthel leans uncomfortably close to the microphone, her voice ringing in the listener’s skull like ASMR over a backdrop of underwater ambience; that’s followed by “Gaunt Kids,” a prowling, visceral spoken word track spliced with an eerie piano ballad. The title track provides the record’s most gratifying moment, building from a barely-there, moonlit song about insomnia and skinny-dipping into a furious rock jam over nearly six minutes. The tension is thrilling, and a reminder of what this band are capable of when they go to darker, weirder places. In early 2019, Billie Eilish performed a cover of Phantogram’s “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore” on BBC Radio 1, referring to it as one of her “favorite songs.” It’s clear that, along with indie bands like The xx, Phantogram laid the groundwork for the whispered, gothic sound of mainstream pop today. It's a shame, then, that on their own album, Phantogram foreground their most conventional, clipped pop selves, when their quietest moments are often the loudest of all.","The duo foreground their most conventional pop sounds on their fourth album, but remain at their best at their strangest.

~how i’m feeling~,Lauv,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5814fb19382e00087249c7/1:1/w_160/how%20i'm%20feeling_Lauv.jpg,2020-03-11 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lauv-how-im-feeling/,AWAL,"Bebe Rexha is “Sad.” Olivia O’Brien wants to be “Sad Together.” Chelsea Cutler is “Sad Tonight.” All of Snakehips and Tinashe’s friends are wasted; all of Tate McRae’s friends are fake; all the kids Jeremy Zucker knows are depressed. The 25-year-old pop singer Lauv—who’s written for Charli XCX and toured with Ed Sheeran—is already well-versed in this very bummed, very online state of a generation. His debut album, ~how i’m feeling~, is a wholly sincere look at angst in the age of social media. “We’re never alone, but always depressed, yeah,” he laments on the closer “Modern Loneliness.” Pop’s pivot to melancholy attests to a certain progress: People on the internet—teenagers especially—are more willing than ever to open up about mental health. Yet the language that’s meted out to talk about it, to really talk about it, is still so limited that what looks like relief often serves to slot our emotions into familiar and digestible templates. (“im like ~~~anxiettyyyy, and then never see a therapist,” a friend joked recently.) The conspicuous text-message stylization of ~how i’m feeling~ makes the tension clear. In contemporary lexicon, bracketing your message in tildes is a form of hedging, of preemptively undercutting the seriousness of what you’re about to say; all-lowercase lettering is another method of shrinking things down. But Lauv wants to cut out the posturing. “We live in a world where a lot of people are afraid of really expressing themselves,” he’s said. “I want you to hear my music and feel, ‘I can be honest and vulnerable with the people around me.’” One obstacle to expressing yourself is working up the courage to do so; another is figuring out, on your own terms, who that self really is. As a public figure, Lauv advocates powerfully for being forthright about your feelings, but his album’s whopping 21-song tracklist is underwhelming and repetitive. Lauv calls it “diverse, emotional, and lit,” but ~how i’m feeling~ is mostly temperate, EDM-lite affairs jumbled with piano ballads and Sheeran-style nice-guy folk, plus one blatant bid for a Latin-pop hit (the Sofía Reyes-assisted “El Tejano”). Much of the emotional substance is laid out in the titles: feelings are hard (“Feelings”), I’m lonely as fuck (“fuck, i’m lonely”), I’m so tired of love songs (“i’m so tired”). These are Tumblr posts adapted as studio hits. When Lauv leaps into a pained falsetto on ballads like “Julia” and “Sad Forever,” you feel the pang of his isolation. But his few moments of existential elegance are undermined by tonally mismatched production. “I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am,” he quavers on “Drugs & the Internet,” before a jarring drop turns the song into a schoolyard stomp. Elsewhere, serious themes are almost completely obscured by mild, Spotify-friendly vibes. “fuck, i’m lonely” features on the soundtrack of the teen-suicide drama 13 Reasons Why, but with its staticky, air-fried finger snaps and tropical ambiance, the Anne-Marie duet is more fit for a flirty island romp. More often than not, Lauv’s attempts to be all-inclusive dilute his message. When he says “we’re never alone, but always depressed,” “depressed” could encompass everything from one-time alienation at a party to life-threatening imbalances in brain chemistry. “I’m lonely just like you,” he repeats on the moody, stadium-ready “Lonely Eyes.” The girl to whom Lauv confesses this fact is so curiously blank that she has few features apart from her “lonely eyes” and her proclivity for expensive vacations. Other characters are even more laughably one-dimensional: “Billy” is a juvenile redemption story about a misfit who grew up in poverty, then “woke up in a Tesla at 23.” (Billy is also the name of Lauv’s dog.) On social media, as in pop music, it’s become increasingly fashionable to display one’s authentic, imperfect self. But the rush to “get real” hasn’t really removed the filter on our expression, only altered its tint. Likewise, the six “Little Lauvs” on the album cover, each wearing a different color of the rainbow, supposedly represent divergent facets of the artist’s personality, a bit like the dueling emotions of Pixar’s Inside Out. As with so much of ~how i’m feeling~, the concept seems simultaneously over- and under-developed: There may be six different versions of Lauv pulling the strings, but in the end, they all sound alike.","Pop singer Ari Leff advocates powerfully for being forthright about your feelings, but his album’s whopping 21-song tracklist is underwhelming and repetitive.

Eternal Atake,Lil Uzi Vert,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e6290565efdff0008ac725b/1:1/w_160/Eternal%20Atake_Lil%20Uzi%20Vert.jpg,2020-03-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-uzi-vert-eternal-atake/,Generation NowAtlantic,"A typical Lil Uzi Vert song boils down to a few core topics: the millions in his bank account, the cars an average person wouldn’t know how to start, jewelry that wouldn’t shine on anyone else, clothing brands that most can’t pronounce, and girls who would never bat an eyelash at someone other than Uzi. But a typical Lil Uzi Vert song also sounds like it was ripped from a harddrive that fell out of the back of a spaceship, all delivered with a medley of influences from the generations that came before him. There’s the spirit of Meek Mill freestyling on Philadelphia street corners, the breakneck pace of G Herbo, the melodic designer-brand fever dream of a True Religion-wearing era Chief Keef, injected slightly with the pint-sized angst of punk-pop heroines like Hayley Williams of Paramore. There’s a reason why the Philly rapper’s leaks and snippets are traded like rare baseball cards in corners of the internet that stream more YouTube than Spotify. There’s nothing else like it. But in the last two years, Lil Uzi Vert songs have become scarce. Shortly after the release of Luv Is Rage 2, the 2017 album that made Uzi a star, he entered label purgatory. Beginning in January 2018, Uzi began to vaguely hint that his Generation Now label bosses DJ Drama and Don Cannon were preventing him from releasing new music—he only dropped one solo song in 2018. In the meantime, while Uzi beefed with a suicide cult, squared up with Rich the Kid in a coffee shop, had a short-lived retirement, and became a semi-professional Triller dancer, his delayed third album, Eternal Atake, developed a mythical aura. It became known by fans as the Uzi opus forever locked away by greedy label heads, but, if it ever did find its way out into the world, it would be a landmark moment for an entire generation. The expectations were otherworldly. And somehow, Uzi met those expectations. Eternal Atake is Uzi’s greatest album to date, a scope-defying hour-long epic that couldn’t be made by anyone else. It’s a seamless blend of drill-influenced rapping, melodic crooning, and beats that are aware of hip-hop’s trends, but stretch them to places unimaginable. A high-stakes feat, accomplished through a creative kinship with the Philly production collective Working On Dying and Uzi’s increased attention to detail—in the world of Eternal Atake, every spaced-out sample is just as important as any animated punchline. Eternal Atake has a loose concept—something about abductions, aliens, and space, alluded to with a few skits and an album trailer—but none of that really matters. The album is 18 Lil Uzi songs about money, the luxury that money buys, the girls attracted to that luxury, and the heartache brought on by those girls, a feeling that has always inspired his music. Except, this time, his detail is richer. Uzi is not just compiling a list of brands; he paints colorful scenes down to the specificity of his Air Forces or a tag on his beanie. Lil Uzi Vert has never rapped this well. He has always been capable, but much of his breakout mixtapes took a bright and singsongy approach to pair with his lovestruck personality. On “Silly Watch,” Uzi’s pace is relentless: It’s like sitting in the passenger seat while Uzi, head barely over the steering wheel, cruises into triple digits. “She look good, but she wear Fashion Nova/Took her shoppin’, put her right in some Vetements,” says Uzi, like every line is stepping on the one before it. “You Better Move” is similar, as Uzi fires off puns referencing forgotten pop culture tokens from his past—Blue Eyes White Dragon, Zoom, a Microsoft Zune—over a freakish Working On Dying beat, sampling sounds from “Space Cadet 3D Pinball,” which used to come pre-loaded with Windows. Uzi switches flows with ease, takes pauses that feel like a sudden pull of the emergency brake, and finishes every line with a high-pitch squeal that rivals Future on “King’s Dead.” Uzi and Working On Dying really gel on “POP.” On a beat that sounds like it’s from the dystopian world of The Terminator, Uzi goes on the most intense Soho shopping spree: “I went to the store and got me some Vetements/Pradas and Balenci’, Balenci’, Balenci’,” he says like his voice is near-breaking. He goes on to name the brand “Balenci’” another 15 times, one of the countless unexpected moments that are not over-thought—the maximized version of the Uzi persona. Listening to Uzi rap this free is like watching an Olympic swimmer: He’s flying and I’m exhausted for him. Eventually, Uzi takes his foot off the gas and weaves a melody in between his bars. “Celebration Station” is near-perfect, as Uzi sings and rolls his Rs: “And I can’t do my dance cause my pants, they from France,” he says, not joking. Then, there’s the delirious ballad “Chrome Heart Tags.” It’s bigger, but Uzi is still rapping about heartache and brands few can afford. The glorious mess of a beat is by Chief Keef, who wields drums that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Flockaveli-era Lux Luger beat paired with vocal samples that make it sound like a nightmare influenced by hallucinogens. Uzi and his producers aren’t reinventing the genre, but reimagining it, blending production and melodies of the last decade in hip-hop, while pushing it forward. At once, it feels like both the past and future. On Eternal Atake you won’t find any pop songs—even a Backstreet Boys interpolation gets flipped on its head—or any attempts at being a rockstar—it’s a rap album. For a while, in the 2010s, many of Uzi’s SoundCloud peers were fed the nonsense that for a rapper to reach superstardom, they had to break down the genre’s barriers. But that was wrong: Hip-hop is limitless. Lil Uzi Vert made an event album, where the main attraction is flex raps and production that builds on its roots. Not even two years (an eternity in rap) was able to hold back Eternal Atake, an album that will be chased for years to come.","The Philly rapper has evolved into an untouchable pop artist in sound and style. With deliriously good rapping and immaculate production, Uzi makes an event album live up to its name.

Conference of Trees,Pantha du Prince,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5e8a2ee721440008a6cffa/1:1/w_160/Trees_Pantha%20du%20Prince.jpg,2020-03-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pantha-du-prince-conference-of-trees/,Modern Recordings,"Did you know there’s a map of all the street trees in New York? The one outside my apartment that’s been looking a bit sheepish lately is a Norway maple, I discovered. It’s not its seasonal nudity that’s lending it an awkward edge, but a crop of fresh, blond scars—round-shaped reminders of branches that once were. Along with many other trees in the area, the Norway maple recently received the chainsaw treatment because some of its limbs had become entangled with the electrical wires strung along the street, causing power outages. While my neighbors and I celebrated the end of our brief disconnection to the grid by logging back into our internet of choice, the trees along our street were probably engaged in their own kind of networking, deep beneath the concrete. Scientific research has shown that, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with fungi, a tree’s root system allows for the exchange of nutrients and distress signals (for example, during an insect attack) with other trees nearby, effectively rendering them a community. All this is to say that thinking about the secret lives of trees seems bound to land a curious mind in fertile ground. German producer and composer Hendrik Weber, who is approaching two decades of releasing music as Pantha du Prince, would no doubt agree. His new album, Conference of Trees, is driven by a related, and self-directed, question: What does it sound like when trees communicate? Weber answers his own question in a folkloric, rather than a scientific, way. Humans have looked to the tree as a source of music for millennia, mining culture from fallen trunks. Our ancestors carved resonant bodies from its lumber to create string instruments, and sliced into planks of wood to shake out all manner of sonic possibilities. In that tradition, Weber created his own set of wooden percussion instruments; I can almost smell the sweet and earthy sawdust in the stop-frame ambience of the album’s first few tracks. Throughout Conference of Trees, the forest’s dappled light is conjured by wood blocks and xylophones, while cello—played by French jazz musician Friedrich Paravicini—and monochord call to mind the rich, vibrating soil through which the roots must wind their way. When Weber’s composition is led by a sense of density—multiple musical voices all intertwining to create a sense of vibrant dialogue—it is at its most engrossing. There is solace to be found in the gentle world-building of “Pius in Tacet,” and the pensive pace of “Lichtung,” which swells and evaporates like early morning mist. Even the echoey energy of “Roots Making Family” feels like a salve; in lesser hands, it could’ve come off chaotic, but instead it pulls focus, inviting the listener along on its search. Where Conference of Trees falls down is when its electronic elements talk over its organic ones. The perky lead melody of “The Crown Territory” strays into twee territory, and in the context of countless ambient techno albums that have turned to nature for inspiration, “Supernova Space Time Drift” feels overly familiar and overdone. It might be sacrilege to die-hard Pantha du Prince fans, but I can’t help but wonder what the album would have sounded like if Weber hadn’t relied so heavily on his trademark bells. That’s not to say there’s no place for bells under the canopy of Conference of Trees. When used subtly, as a shadow to the xylophone tones on “When We Talk,” they lift the whole mood. It’s compelling, too, to hear Weber take on a rambling Robert Wyatt-ish vocal here; a foreshadowing, perhaps, of his nearing elder statesman role. Where Conference of Trees ultimately takes me is back to the woods I walked through as a child, twigs snapping underfoot and sunlight filtering through a thousand shades of green. In turn, that makes me think of the Norway maple, planted in a sea of concrete to suck up the carbon dioxide we spit out, and leaves me wondering about the kin it’s making in the deep, damp soil.","With strings, xylophone, and homemade wooden percussion in addition to his usual synths and bells, the German musician ponders the secret life of trees.

U-Void Synthesizer,Machine Girl,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e66675ca967e20009bdb362/1:1/w_160/Machine%20Girl%20-%20U-Void%20Synthesizer.jpg,2020-03-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/machine-girl-u-void-synthesizer/,Machine Girl,"Since their inception, the Pittsburgh duo Machine Girl have put upsetting images of dogs at the heart of their symbology. Some of their album covers are straightforwardly terrifying—their 2014 album WLFGRL features a blown-out image of a snarling beast, fangs bared, poised for attack. Others are more surreal, like ...BECAUSE IM YOUNG ARROGANT AND HATE EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR, which trains a video-game firearm on the face of a canine. For the cover of 2018’s The Ugly Art, vocalist and producer Matt Stephenson said he wanted to make “a fucked up Deep Dream sort of image but with dogs,” and so he stitched together a bunch of pictures of gnarled beasts to make a dizzying collage in the shape of an even bigger dog. U-Void Synthesizer, the duo’s newest album, continues this tradition, editing a regal image of a pup into a demonoid monster wearing a spiked collar that reads “GOODBOY.” The music has changed a lot over the years—from Stephenson’s solo experiments in the early days of the project to the crushing noise and shredded EBM punk he started making once drummer Sean Kelly joined the band—but the dogs on the covers hint at the spirit that’s united all of Machine Girl’s mutations. No matter the style, their music is designed to be unpredictable and dangerous, full of animalistic rage and uncontrollable energy. You’re meant to be afraid of its bite. Even with volatility as one of the band’s core values, however, they’ve rarely felt as wonderfully feral as on U-Void Synthesizer. The music that Stephenson and Kelly make together has always been chaotic, but they try out more sounds and styles across these 11 tracks than seems possible. Take the immense first track, “The Fortress [The Blood Inside]”: In just under four minutes, Stephenson and Kelly squeeze in ecstatic trance synths, grinding noise-punk passages, open-hearted sacred-music harmonies, gargly grindcore vocals, half-stuttered rapping, and, yes, the sound of a barking dog. Most of the record operates at this blistering pace. Other tracks meld together mutant dance music with cacophonous noise (“Scroll of Sorrow”) or slam samples from bad translations of the Star Wars prequels with glitchy metal refractions (“Batsu Forever”). Even more straightforward songs, like the minute-and-a-half blitz of “Kill All Borders,” are arranged in such a way that they’re blurry and bewildering too. Kelly plays his kit with a sweaty intensity that has often invited comparisons to Lightning Bolt’s tunnel-vision pummeling, and Stephenson’s in-the-red electronics leave little room in the margins of the tracks for any stray thoughts.

Avant-minded metal acts like Liturgy have often experimented with deliberately overwhelming arrangements, as have artists like Bonnie Baxter, Deli Girls, and many of their other contemporaries in New York’s punk-minded scene of self-described “mutants.” But U-Void Synthesizer is unique in the way it echoes the cruel momentum of the modern world. Machine Girl have said that this is largely the point of their music. “I think most of what dictates our taste is pretty maximum shit because we’ve just consumed so much media in our lives,” Kelly said in an interview last year. “So for us to really relate to anything it has to be over the top.” In their mile-a-minute music, there’s little hope for rest—just pure fear, momentum, and adrenaline for a society that demands it.","Relentlessly smashing together bits of punk, grindcore, rave, industrial, and more, the Pittsburgh duo’s maximalist music echoes the cruel momentum of the modern world.

Mother’s Finest Compilation,Various Artists,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5ec10358ffb900080a46ca/1:1/w_160/Mother's%20Finest_Various%20Artists.jpg,2020-03-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-mothers-finest-compilation/,Mother's Finest,"Berlin is often touted as the techno capital of the world, but the city’s music scene goes deeper than the steadily thudding kick drums emanating from clubs like Berghain and Tresor. The German capital has always been a musically diverse place, particularly for those interested in leftfield and experimental sounds, and in recent years, a variety of styles have taken root across the city’s many dancefloors. Until last month, several of those dancefloors could be found at Griessmuehle, a former grain mill-turned-nightclub that was a beloved hub for a myriad of non-techno styles: house, disco, electro, UK bass, and more. The club closed in early February after the property’s owner chose not to renew the venue’s lease, but while the place was still open, its roster of regular parties included Mother’s Finest, with German artist Franklin De Costa at the helm. During the series’ seven-year run—for now, its events are part of the “Griessmuehle im Exil” series at Alte Münze, with a new permanent home coming later in the year—De Costa has established himself as one of Berlin’s most trusted nightlife curators, especially for those who gravitate toward heavy bass and the more adventurous varieties of house and techno. He now applies those curatorial skills to a new record label, which kicks off with the simply titled Mother’s Finest Compilation. A 15-track collection put together by De Costa and Bristol artist Hodge—a Mother’s Finest resident since 2016—it’s an impressive assemblage of talent that places established artists like Batu, Laurel Halo, and Mosca alongside hotly tipped up-and-comers like Anunaku (aka TSVI), Otik, and Karima F. Although Berlin and the UK are heavily represented, the record does reach beyond the usual electronic music hotspots, gathering tracks from Portugal’s Violet, Mexico’s Nico, and Italy’s Katatonic Silentio. Stylistically, the compilation resides mostly in the hard-to-categorize nether region between bass music and techno, making additional forays into ambient, breakbeat, electro, and jungle. Similar to the output of labels like Timedance, Livity Sound, and Hessle Audio, the music marries the potent basslines and adventurous drum programming of the UK hardcore continuum to a more focused techno framework, resulting in a hybrid sound that’s remarkably potent. Mother’s Finest Compilation is loaded with formidable club tracks. Hodge’s “Silo” is a particularly animated drum workout, while Nico’s “Common Drum” blends percussive acrobatics with delicate melodies and a more introspective mood. The North African palette and rambunctious spirit of Anunaku’s “Nascent” make it one of liveliest offerings, although it’s rivaled by the breakbeat-infused ghetto house of Nasty King Kurl’s “Complicated” and the booming basslines of Violet’s “Infinite Source,” which brilliantly captures the raucous, rave-ready vibe of ’90s jungle. Dynamo Dreesen’s hypnotic “From This Era” pursues a more linear path; wonky, off-kilter rhythms fuel the seasick glitch of Mosca’s “Swann Morton,” the serpentine groove of Batu’s “High Press,” and the alien stomp of Franklin De Costa’s “Rage.” If there’s one drawback, it’s a lack of narrative. Mother’s Finest Compilation may be stuffed with top-shelf tunes, but its larger purpose is unclear. Most of the artists featured have played at Mother’s Finest before (some several times), so perhaps it works as a sort of overview of the party’s history, but only Hodge and De Costa are actually residents, and most of the producers don’t even live in Berlin. Without knowing the label’s future plans, it’s possible to see this compilation as a sort of public branding exercise—a practice that’s become common in the electronic music realm. Especially for a new label, it’s a lot easier to market and sell a record with 15 different artists, all of who have their own fan bases and social media channels, than it is to find an audience for an EP or album from a single act, particularly one that’s relatively unknown. Fortunately, while many artists aren’t naturally inclined to offer up their best stuff for a random compilation, Mother’s Finest Compilation hardly feels inconsequential. It’s clear that De Costa and Hodge made sure to accept only high-quality material, and as first releases go, Mother’s Finest Compilation makes an impressive statement. Its storyline may not extend much beyond, “Here’s a bunch of tunes from artists we like,” but when the music is this good, perhaps that doesn’t matter.","On a new label spun off from the eponymous Berlin party series, Franklin De Costa and Hodge curate a strong selection of formidable bass/techno hybrids from acts like Laurel Halo, Batu, and Violet.

Heavy Light,U.S. Girls,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5801cb0e27b00008f7b925/1:1/w_160/Heavy%20Light_U.S.%20Girls.jpg,2020-03-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/us-girls-heavy-light/,4ADRoyal Mountain,"In her long career as a sound collagist and pop music obsessive, Meg Remy has thrived in moments of feminized vitriol. The women of Remy’s songs are so often threatening to asphyxiate themselves, on the verge of suicide, and mad as hell. For much of her career, U.S. Girls has been an exploration of female violence and rage. But Heavy Light, Remy’s seventh album, lives in that period of emptiness that comes after. Like 2018’s In a Poem Unlimited, Heavy Light is a sideways look at the history of pop music and the capitalist world in which it thrives. What’s different here is how it sounds, and how it feels. These songs capture the watershed moment when your throat closes up, your head cools off, and your tears run dry: It is when you enter what can only be described as a zone of weightless grief. It’s dense, heady, hard to grasp, but that’s what makes her music so rich. Remy casts herself as a pop star and reflects on the traumas of childhood and earth through parables and the music we grew up on. Heavy Light taps into a deep well of pop music, the product of someone who listens to ’60s girl groups and Bruce Springsteen records with equal passion. The slick disco song “4 American Dollars,” with all of its vocal harmonies and synthesizer freakouts, feels indebted to the plastic soul of David Bowie’s Young Americans. Remy includes words of advice that she lifts from a Martin Luther King Jr. quote: “You gotta have boots/If you wanna lift those bootstraps.” “State House (It’s a Man’s World),” is a soured reimagining of the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby,” with a hallucinatory kick drum and a layer of dense noise that feels like watching the third rail on the subway catch fire in half-time. “But it’s just a man’s world, we just breed here,” Remy and her backing choir sing. Heavy Light thrives in this sort of dissociative blaze where gender politics, grief, and deeply fucked-up pop hooks slam into one another. So much of Heavy Light exists in this emotional space that feels like an exquisite freefall. Listening to “Born to Lose”—with its surreal nod to Sam the Sham’s “Wooly Bully”—feels like walking out of your body; a vibraphone solo spirals into dissonance and congas float like debris after a hurricane. Remy’s mezzo-soprano is emotive and clear, like someone doing Patti Smith karaoke to an empty room. On the emotional heavyweight “IOU,” she muses about the idea that no one chooses to be born. She is art-pop’s own Orpheus, singing about the end of the world as she watches everyone she knew and loved disappear from her field of vision. The album reaches its highest altitudes on “The Quiver to the Bomb,” a sweeping anthem about the birth of humanity and the environmental disaster that has followed. The pain you hear in Remy’s voice is drawn from the terror humanity has inflicted upon the earth. We are not just killing one another through our bottomless hunger for violence: we are mutilating our planet, too. “Accretion speaks louder than words,” she sings, flatly, banging the gavel on the trial of our species. Peppered through the record are three potent sound collages, fugues of overlapping voices that speak about the experiences they had when they were young and malleable. “I would tell her that I loved her, and that life is long,” one voice says on “Advice to Teenage Self.” “The Most Hurtful Thing” takes a headlong dive into the pain of being young, reminiscing about a parent who tells you that they fucked up raising you, and the sensation of being called insane to your face. So much of being alive is an exercise in denying the existence of personal trauma. Collective trauma, Remy seems to suggest, is the reason for the fracturing of our society. We carry our pain everywhere; it molds and destroys our environment. If so much of living with trauma is about needing to find a path ahead, Heavy Light shines the way.

Don’t Let Get You Down,Wajatta,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e57fed70e27b00008f7b922/1:1/w_160/Don't%20Let_Wajatta.jpg,2020-03-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wajatta-dont-let-get-you-down/,Brainfeeder,"On paper, Reggie Watts and John Tejada make a strange pair. Watts is now a household name to millions of Americans, after his virtuosic beatboxing and stand-up comedy landed him a regular gig as bandleader on The Late Late Show with James Corden. By contrast, John Tejada is a beloved techno legend whose reticent nature would make it difficult for even the most ardent raver to pick him out in a lineup. What they have in common is casual mastery of their respective crafts: performance and production. With their joint project Wajatta, the two Los Angelenos stretch out and show off that formidable musicianship. While their 2018 debut Casual High Technology was haphazard, showing off its makers’ respective talents without ever synthesizing them, Don’t Let Get You Down feels more refined. It places Watts firmly in the role of lead singer, but also percussionist, lead synthesizer, and master of ceremonies. The album’s title might look like it’s missing a word, but the absence of the noun summarizes the duo’s studio ethos: Throw stuff at the wall, see what sticks, don’t sweat the details, have fun. Wajatta certainly deliver on that last principle. The title track—described by Watts as “the poppiest song we’ve ever done”—opens with a whistled melody that’s wince-inducing at first, but becomes pleasant when Watts counters it with a falsetto. So much of Watts’ artistry is wrapped up in deft improvisation that it feels somehow natural when he slips into different accents or goes on an extended riff about the cool features on his new refrigerator, as he does on “Marmite.” On that same tune, Tejada loops a segment of his bandmate’s scatting voice until it resembles a maraca. Watt’s effects-pedal-centric live show, with its vocal looping and chopping, exerts a tremendous influence on the structure of the songs. On the opening moments of “Renegade,” murmured syllables patter against Tejada’s immaculate drums; on the loping, arpeggio-heavy “Another Sun,” Watts flexes his vocal range atop his own beatboxing. He makes a refreshing sparring partner for Tejada, whose 2019 Performance Review EP only hinted at the bright, punchy house music they coalesce around on “Tonight” or “138.” Lest we forget Tejada’s years spent dabbling in hip-hop and electro, Wajatta also bring the BPM down for a few songs. Watts channels Moodymann over a subby, minimal track on “Little Man,” but neither he nor the production are quite as menacing or seductive as they could be. “Depth Has a Focus” makes great use of Watts’ versatility, but the track as a whole falls apart any time the vocal loops become focal points rather than auxiliary percussion. The most memorable song to stray from four-on-the-floor is “January,” with synth-funk grooves and R&B coos that Watts builds into stacks of lovely background vocals. Ultimately, Wajatta find the most success when they both play to their strengths, as they do on the album closer “All I Need Is You.” Watts crosses over from imitating a house diva to embodying one—dancefloor callouts and all—while Tejada shakes off any pretension to unleash some deeply satisfying tech house. Just as Tejada’s meticulous productions are a boon to Watts’ voice, the comedian-singer’s unique character and energy give Don’t Let Get You Down an ebullience. They might not be innovating the form, but their shared creative spirit has its own irresistible charm.

"Songs & Melodies, 1973-1977",Jon Gibson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d8e2e230d040009b1f406/1:1/w_160/Songs%20&%20Melodies_Jon%20Gibson.jpg,2020-03-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jon-gibson-songs-and-melodies-1973-1977/,Superior Viaduct,"Jon Gibson’s saxophone, flute, and clarinet are the connective tissue of the 20th century American minimalist canon. He appeared on a number of Philip Glass’ key recordings, including Music With Changing Parts, Einstein on the Beach, and Koyaanisqatsi, as well as Steve Reich’s Drumming and Phase Patterns; he also spent time as a member in La Monte Young’s Theatre of Eternal Music and worked with Terry Riley. Yet Gibson’s own music has been relegated to the footnotes of the period. But, like Arthur Russell and Julius Eastman—unslottable artists whose output resisted the easy categorization of minimalism, and suffered accordingly—Gibson has belatedly begun to receive his due, although he is still alive, and able to reap the benefits of his rising profile. You can hear the influence of his distilled and detailed pattern music—like his 1977 album Two Solo Pieces—filtering down to a new generation of composers like Kali Malone, Ellen Arkbro, and Sarah Davachi. After reissuing his 1970s albums, Superior Viaduct now goes into the archives for Songs & Melodies, filling in the gaps between 1973’s Visitations and Two Solo Pieces. What they’ve gathered ranges from Gibson’s solo recordings to minimalistic pattern music rendered with an 11-piece ensemble. The former suggest multitudes; the latter moves as a single entity. Some of the selections gathered here falter, struggling to break out of the strictures of minimalism, while other moments approach the transcendence of his better known material. Both Russell and Eastman appear, on cello and piano, respectively, and just as Gibson disappears completely in the work of others, so do his friends here. If only the release included notes of some sort to help illuminate Gibson’s thought process during this era and better situate him in the New York scene, like the excellent 1992 set In Good Company did. “Song I” pits Gibson’s soprano saxophone against a backdrop of violin and cellos; its opening section is deeply hypnotic and evocative, firmly aligned with early New York minimalism. But when it suddenly breaks into “song”—something strangely like an Irish jig—it has the jarring effect of a car veering off into the ditch. Deliberately following repetition with moments of rupture could make for a bracing and effective strategy, if only the melody were strong enough to pull it off. By contrast, “Song II” is smoother in its transitions, adding marimba and contrabass to the strings to create a piece at once fidgety yet as enveloping as early Philip Glass. In “Melody,” a tape experiment from 1973, Gibson nudges a steady pattern of piano figures toward a more expansive view of minimalism. But unlike Gibson’s dense, percussive, gamelan-like “Visitations,” also from that year, the 15-minute “Melody” meanders rather than immerses. The live “Solo for Saxophone” sits in a similar purgatory: Gibson moves through numerous lines and figures in its concise four minutes, but it never coalesces, instead coming across more like a player warming up. But it’s worth it all to arrive at the banks of the gorgeous “Melody IV,” scored for 11-piece ensemble. Performed in Buffalo in 1977, it’s one of Gibson’s most moving compositions, hushed and slow blooming, anticipating by a few decades the sort of assured pacing you hear in composers like Jóhann Jóhannsson or bands like Stars of the Lid and Natural Information Society. The strings—with quivering accents courtesy of the vibraphone—are drawn out, invinting listeners to luxuriate in their suspended tones, and imparting an air of wistfulness. It’s not memorable in the same way that a pop song is, yet that emotional resonance lingers in your heart long after the composition draws to a close.

Not Fire,Dean Roberts,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56e1640db1200009923972/1:1/w_160/Not%20Fire_Dean%20Roberts.jpg,2020-03-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dean-roberts-not-fire/,Erstwhile,"Not Fire is the first album from Berlin-based songwriter Dean Roberts in 12 years, and his comeback arrives during apocalyptic times. It’s not an album about someone who’s found hope or love despite everything; Roberts sounds exhausted, and his album is as ugly and as bleak as life often is. For those who’ve been in the pits and succumbed to self-destructive nihilism, Not Fire is a reminder of how hellish it all can be. Sonically, Not Fire is murky and battered and melancholy. Guitars clang incessantly, drums lurch without vigor—there’s hardly a moment where one doesn’t feel placed in a barren wasteland, left to wander aimlessly. On “Say After Me,” a melange of noisy guitar strums and plucks constantly ring out without any impression of oncoming closure. In the song’s final passage, Roberts slides his pick down a guitar string, the resulting sound a thunderous roar, the final bellowing of bottled-up feelings. Not Fire can sound a lot like a pained desire for release, a wish to scream into the emptiness like Roberts does on the album cover. Nothing here feels cathartic, however. If anything, every note just propagates uneasiness, something that’s fiercely evident on the nearly 10-minute centerpiece “Heron.” Reed instruments and wolf-like howls imbue the piece with anxious tension. Frightening as the music may sound, Roberts sings of acceptance (“There is no blistering sun ’cause the summer’s just gone”). The song’s final third is wordless, but you can still sense his mournful presence. Even when the songs aren’t harrowing, Roberts’ weariness and irascibility are clear. On the bluesy folk song “Paul,” he speaks of the titular person as a thorn in his side—a burdensome figure who’s always there at the worst of times. He concludes with a confession: “I always run into you Paul/And say I’ll call/But I don’t want to.” This longing for solitude becomes an unwelcome reality on “Kids,” where he talks about the crumbling of a long-term relationship. “Would it have changed anything if we’d had kids?” he wonders. You can tell, from his wavering voice, that he doesn’t think so. Throughout Not Fire, Roberts feels numb. A summation of his downward spiral appears on the title track. “It’s not fire; love is something else” he moans. His voice quivers amidst droning feedback and heaving drums, the song exuding the shut-in mystique of Jandek’s early works. As the song builds, Roberts never finds healing; he only sounds tormented, broken. There is one hopeful song on Not Fire. With “My Diviner,” Roberts delivers anguished expressions of gratitude. The mythical figure of the title leads him to water in a period of drought, and proves to be a steady light in his life (“You’re not one to quit, that ain’t how you live”). The sweetness is a salve from the misery that looms over everything else. In a time when gods feel ever-absent, when futures seem increasingly dim, “My Diviner” serves as a thoughtful reminder: life’s shittiness is promised, but so is the nourishing comfort that comes when receiving persistent care. It sounds like a call to hold fast and love hard.","The Berlin-based songwriter’s bleak and coruscating new album feels like a call to hold fast and love hard.

Post,Björk,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5819bc0db1200009923a5f/1:1/w_160/Post_Bjork.jpg,2020-03-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bjork-post/,Elektra,"Inspecting the inner mechanics of her television set, Björk’s face lit up with wonder. “It looks like a little model of a city, all the houses and trees, and here are the wires, they really take care of all the electrons…” It was 1988, and Björk was two years removed from the dissolution of her gothy post-punk band KUKL, which released music on the UK punk label Crass. But as the lead singer of art-rock tricksters the Sugarcubes, she still looked the part. In the interview clip, Björk explains that an Icelandic poet once made her painfully afraid of her television—a TV program can hypnotize you, the poet said, going “directly into your brain and you stop judging if it’s right or not, you just swallow and swallow.” When she read the scientific truth about television in a Danish book, she was much more calm. As the segment concludes, Björk looks into the camera: “You shouldn’t let poets lie to you.” Not unlike the music Björk would proceed to make—going solo with 1993’s Debut—the effect of this footage is a little bemusing, quite soothing, entirely spellbinding. Björk is fearless, funny, slyly political, absurd. She is drawing an unlikely intersection of technology and intimacy, embodying what would become her eternal promise: It is possible to be both weird and understood. By her second record, 1995’s Post, Björk had become well-acquainted with the bustling cosmopolitan energy of cities. She had relocated from Iceland to London in the early 1990s as a 27-year-old mother of a 6-year-old son, but her Arctic home was always with her. Björk attended music school in Reykjavík from ages 5 to 14—her precocious introduction to experimental electronic composers such as Stockhausen and John Cage—and released her first album at 11; her “hardcore hippie” mother did the psychedelic cover art. But nature was her ultimate teacher. Björk said Iceland itself, not other singers, shaped her voice. It is an extreme landscape of glaciers and volcanoes, of barrenness and eruptions, endless daylight in summer and mostly darkness in winter. Walking 40 minutes to school, a young Björk entertained herself by singing: sneaking down to the moss on the ground to whisper a verse, running up a hill to unleash a chorus loudly against the wind. Björk absorbed the peaks and valleys, light and dark, twists and turns of her reality, arriving nowhere conventional. When she sang in accordance to the moss and the hills, perhaps it was a result of studying Cage in school: music was everywhere. Instinct became Björk’s personal law, and boundlessness became her key. Maybe it was the punk-surrealist in her, saying doors are only locked if you believe them to be, that what exists inside your mind is already real. “I’m going hunting for mysteries [...] I’m going to prove the impossible really exists,” Bjork sings on Post’s austere “Cover Me,” each note aglow with a sense of discovery. Björk saw Debut and Post “like twins, the first and second born,” as Rolling Stone reported in ’95, and she said both were “a celebration of the unpredictability of life,” like a “greatest hits of [her] musical passions” to that point. They could together be called The London Years, existing in the historical lineage of art reflecting the experiences of women in cities, seeking adventures: Björk called the protagonist of Post “that wide-eyed girl from the country, but she’s been in the city for a while… she’s consuming the city and the city is consuming her.” Having previously played with rock bands—the Sugarcubes toured with U2 and Public Image Ltd—Björk found “there was absolutely no creativity in rock venues.” Yearning to meet artists pushing sound to reflect the moment, she ventured into rapt underground London dance clubs, where she found collaborators in Nellee Hooper, Graham Massey of 808 State, Howie B, and Tricky of the Massive Attack milieu. Björk fused the abstracted atmospherics of this avant-dance zeitgeist—IDM, trip-hop, techno, house—with all the parts of herself: the episodic melodies of late-’70s Joni Mitchell, the guttural edges of Meredith Monk’s extended vocal techniques, a voice on par with the supreme emotional greats of history, Edith Piaf on ecstasy. The Post sessions began at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. There, Björk could sing outside the way she did as a child: snaking the long wires of her microphone and headphones down to the ocean, into caves, or under a bush beneath the stars. Electricity communed with Earth. “I was crying my eyes out with joy,” Björk once said of the Bahamas sessions. “It was completely outrageous.” Upon returning to London, Bjork went on her own mission to “bring the album alive,” adding bagpipes, trumpet, saxophones, dulcimers, harp, an orchestra, and a brass band to the productions, re-recording some songs entirely. She wanted every song to be a shock, to work in wildly contrasting styles. “My musical heart was scattered at the time,” Björk once said, “and I wanted the album to show that.” Post is far greater than the sum of its parts—the sensory rush of dance music meeting pop storytelling, spontaneity mixed with ambition. Björk explodes her interior world into the role of the extrovert. If you took the “punk” out of “post-punk” that Björk previously made, but retained its ethos of eclecticism; if you left the “modern” off “postmodern,” but kept its spirit of bricolage; you arrive here: Björk, singular, Post. Maybe the only appropriate modifier is an absence of one, a Cagean blank space, a gesture towards possibility. Although Post contains some old-fashioned heartache, its defining romance is an unconventional one: a pure love for music. The somnambulant dream song, Post’s closer “Headphones,” chronicles in real time all the ways music can rearrange a person—in its lyrics as well as in the euphoric fracturing of its dubby production by Tricky, who was especially close to the “headphone” music of his Bristol hometown (à la Massive Attack, Portishead). “I like this resonance/It elevates me/I don’t recognize myself/This is very interesting,” Björk intones. “My headphones/They saved my life.” Björk wrote “Headphones” about falling asleep to mixtapes from her collaborator, Graham Massey; she pulled the words from her diary. This uncanny passion for sound is felt everywhere on Post. It’s in the scorched industrial march of “Enjoy,” in the grandeur of the strings on “You’ve Been Flirting Again.” It’s in the crackling trip-hop melancholy of “Possibly Maybe,” in the cool free jazz that rustles beneath “The Modern Things,” in the gleaming harpsichord of “Cover Me” (the vocals of which were recorded in a cave full of bats). And it’s especially present in the deliriously fun big-band blast of “It’s Oh So Quiet”—Björk’s madcap cover of the wartime tune from Hollywood star Betty Hutton, which she recorded with a 20-piece orchestra, manifesting her deep-rooted love for musicals. In a 1995 “AOL Chat” interview, a fan asked Björk where the idea for “It’s Oh So Quiet” came from, and she said that her live music director Guy Sigsworth “found it in a truck stop”—on a cassette comp—“and it became the tour anthem of last tour. Turned us on before the gigs.” It’s a cover that only a true pop maniac would go through with and only a pop maestro could pull off. The song explodes from Björk’s pin-drop whispers to throat-shredding wails—alongside blaring brass, the sheer loudness of Björk’s singing is a visceral delight. “Oh, what’s the use of falling in love?” Björk sings on the comedown, before raving up with an answer again. Björk has called her work “modern folk songs,” and each one tells a story. This idea keeps in the Icelandic tradition of sagas. “Isobel” is one of Björk’s most epic tales, gesturing towards introspection and self-knowledge. The folkloric lyrics—“My name Isobel/Married to myself”—were written with Björk’s frequent collaborator, the Icelandic poet Sjón, a man who was inspired to refine his English to better understand David Bowie’s lyrics. In the documentary Inside Björk, she describes the titular Isobel—named so to echo “isolation”—as a force of a woman who retreats completely from the muchness of the world. Growing up in a forest, she comes to see that “the pebbles on the forest floor were actually baby skyscrapers.” As Isobel becomes a woman, she finds herself in the big city, where she clashes with civilization and returns to the forest. “There she would collect moths and train them to send out her message [...] a message of instinct,” Björk said. The moths flew before the faces of people “functioning with too much logic [...] and go, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no’ til people click out of this state of being sensible.” Of course, Björk’s music is a testament to what is possible when logic and practical sense are not guiding principles. But she hardly withdrew. Björk said she had a total of three days off in 1993 and 1994 combined—she had become a legitimate star. In the face of the chaos of fame, “Army of Me” summons resilience, as if Björk knew exactly what she would be up against in the years to come. (In 1996, a fan tried to mail a bomb to her house.) She said “Army of Me” was written as an ultimatum to her own brother, to regain control of his life, lest he “meet an army of me.” Björk scratches at the depths of her voice, and the industrial backbone of the song, the crashes and shrapnel, fortify the task. “Army of Me” is proof that being the most obvious misfit in the room often requires being the toughest, too. The double-time techno of “Hyperballad” begins with a glint. But it hones its strength. It’s a work of surrealism, narrating the tale of a woman who wakes up early at the top of a mountain, and throws “car parts, bottles, and cutlery” off its edge. She wonders what it would be like to throw herself off, too, her body slamming against the rocks, her eyes open all along—as a kind of catharsis, an emotional purging, in order to deal with people later: “I go through all this/Before you wake up/So I can feel happier/To be safe up here with you.” Her melody rises and tumbles, a slow spiral; the suspended rapture of the beat catches her in air. If Debut’s “Human Behavior” was an ultimate outcast anthem—“If you ever get close to a human and human behavior, be ready, be ready to get confused”—then “Hyperballad” feels like a triumphant appeal to exist cooperatively alongside other people. Björk did this not only in her hyper-collaborative albums but in her entire project of making pop music, trying to reach all kinds of people at once. “Everything’s geared toward self-sufficiency. Fuck that,” Björk told punk historian Jon Savage in Interview. “For me, the target is to learn how to communicate with other people, which is the hardest thing, after all. What you should be doing is learning how to live with other human beings.” Car parts, bottles, cutlery, technology, and political superpowers are no match against this outreaching feeling, this ethos of interconnectedness that lives inside “Hyperballad,” inside of Björk in general, and it is an instinct inherent, ever crucially, in the survival of humanity. “All the modern things/Like cars and such/Have always existed,” Björk sings on “The Modern Things.” “They’ve just been waiting in a mountain/For the right moment.” Not unlike the 23-year-old who dissected a television with love and awe, there’s a fantastic tinge of hope to this idea and to the whole of Post, an invitation into her profound exploration of places not yet traveled, to acknowledge the magic in the fact that there are sounds you might love that you can’t currently fathom. Twenty-five years later, you don’t need to scroll far through Björk’s Instagram feed to find the most audacious young popular artists alive, the likes of Arca and Rosalía, heeding that call, crowning her “queen.” With Post, Björk set the bionic foundation for one of the most consequential careers in pop history. Here is where Björk became a perennial gateway drug, not to one sound but to the unknown, which is to say the future. She would soon leave London for the south of Spain and then New York, recording her two towering masterpieces—1997’s Homogenic, which Missy Elliott once gleefully likened to “Mozart at a rap show,” and the introverted microbeats of 2001’s Vespertine—crystallizing the totality of her vision. What other artist could successively collaborate with Wu-Tang Clan, interview Estonian minimalist legend Arvo Pärt, and appear on “MTV Unplugged” accompanied by a man playing a table of drinking glasses? In another era, maybe Bowie, which is just right—it was Bowie, after all, who inspired Björk’s immortal swan dress. By the end of the ’90s, the world would know the only answer: Björk.

Superstar,Caroline Rose,by: Abigail Covington,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d8c5d0db1200009923f7f/1:1/w_160/Superstar_Caroline%20Rose.jpg,2020-03-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caroline-rose-superstar/,New West,"In the opening scenes of her video for “Feel the Way I Want,” New York singer-songwriter Caroline Rose stands outside a Ripley’s Believe It or Not! in Hollywood, California, and receives a phone call. It’s her agent. That audition she has? It’s in Hollywood, Florida. Off she goes on a cross-country dance trip to Florida, where she nails her audition for the role of a bug-eyed lobster. This is the beginning of a gag Rose sees all the way through her fourth album, Superstar, which tells the story of a character based off an exaggerated version of herself, mixed with bits of Kanye West and 2007 Britney Spears. This character, or “anti-hero” as Rose often calls them, is a study in contradictions—confident and insecure, anxious and optimistic, ambitious to the point of delusion—who, having recently experienced the rush of success, now craves fame and riches. Looking back, it seems obvious Rose would make such a character-driven album. By the time of her breakout third LP Loner in 2018, she had already started dressing in all red and refining an irreverent onstage persona. Loner was a hybrid offering: Americana-esque stories that played out from multiple perspectives, told through indie-pop melodies that carefully folded in programmatic drums and synthesizers. By contrast, Superstar is a single narrative. Chronological storytelling means the album has only one direction to travel; it’s easy to predict the main character’s impending undoing. Like a book whose author has overcommitted to her outline, the album’s linear structure sacrifices opportunities for spontaneity along the way. Superstar also lacks some of the musical restraint that made Loner such a balanced listen. Armed with new studio tricks and the desire to create something from scratch, Rose played every position—songwriter, producer, engineer, guitarist, flutist, field recording supervisor. While her intentions are admirable, Superstar suffers from an excess of overwrought effects (reverb! panning!) that an outside collaborator might’ve trimmed. Still, when Rose manages to find the right balance on her own, as on lead single “Feel the Way I Want,” it’s clear she’s a fiercely talented artist with omnivorous taste that extends from the hyper-pop of Grimes to the abstract electronic music of Suzanne Ciani. The opening riff of “Back at the Beginning” recalls the wiry guitar solo from Dandy Warhols’ “We Used to Be Friends.” Given her wide range of source material, it’s easy to understand how Rose could struggle in the editing process. What remains strong throughout the album are the lyrics. Rose is an undeniably gifted songwriter, capable of cleverness without sacrificing clarity. Her sense of humor is strong as ever, especially on “Do You Think We’ll Last Forever,” a sparse dance track about new-relationship anxiety. “I’m alright, I’m alright, I’m alright/It’s just a heart attack,” Rose insists. Later, on the standout “Freak Like Me,” she describes the object of her affection as a “split-level home,” a “brick through a broken window,” a “skin-tight suit,” a “vicious dom,” and a “drunk conversation.” Cobbled together, the evocative descriptions reveal a person ready to relish their freakiness in front of a lover who’s equally down. These personal-feeling moments are the album’s strongest, and Superstar could use more of them. By clinging to the never-ending blank page of the bit, Rose winds up in shallower waters. Her previous albums demonstrate her gift for thinking critically about knotty concepts and turning heady observations on subjects like monotony and loneliness into indie-pop gold. Here, each song is a variation on the same ultimate theme: the fine line between aspiration and delusion. And while Rose mines the topic for all it’s worth—exploring the many side-effects and surprises that stem from unchecked ambition—her reluctance to explore perspectives beyond that of her neurotic anti-hero limit the experience.

We Had a Good Time,Bullion,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56d81dba238a0008308298/1:1/w_160/We%20Had%20A%20Good%20Time_Bullion.jpg,2020-03-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bullion-we-had-a-good-time/,Deek,"Over the last decade, the Lisbon-based Nathan Jenkins, who goes by the name Bullion, has created epic songs in miniature. Before moving to Portugal, he hosted a show on London’s NTS online radio station, presenting songs by sophisti-pop stalwarts like the Blue Nile and Prefab Sprout alongside synth-rock ballads by John Martyn and Robert Wyatt. With 2011’s You Drive Me to Plastic and 2012’s Love Me Oh Please Love Me, he made early,  sample-heavy attempts to fuse these influences. On his 2016 album Loop the Loop, which he’s described as being about “making changes rather than going over and over on the same old path,” he perfected his own flavor of contemplative pop. We Had a Good Time, his newest collection of songs, explores repetition’s ability to find the novel in the ordinary. On We Had a Good Time, Bullion uses guitar, synth pads, and reverb for a mellow set of songs that center around memories of the mundane, finding the sublime in the banal. Opener “O Vermona” is made up of an Emeralds-like drone and Bullion’s lightly doubled vocals: “I’ll never go quiet on you.” He cuts the phrase into fragments and layers the pieces, turning a simple declaration into an arresting hook. When he allows the line to play out again before the song goes silent, it has obtained a peculiar power. The most daring display of repetition-as-technique is the decision to record two versions of one song: “Hula,” which appears halfway through the EP, and “Hula Hula,” the record’s closer. If you aren’t paying attention, you might imagine you are hearing “Hula” a second time. But the subtle additions to “Hula, Hula”—more echo, a new guitar solo, extra bleeps—become evident on closer listening. Only a cryptic lyrical fragment remains the same: “Are people in pain where you are?” In the ebullient “Hula,” the question seems rhetorical, like a public service announcement attempting to make you more aware of your fellow citizens. In the spectral “Hula Hula,” the query evokes a deeper, more existential line of thought: Is there anything you might have missed? We Had a Good Time is acutely conscious of the fact that memories fade. The elegiac title track, co-written by Diego Herrera (aka Suzanne Kraft), seemingly mourns a past relationship. Though each wash of ambient sound, artificial clap, and synthetic organ is calculated, the cumulative effect is one of real regret. The present will someday be lost; that’s why Bullion is fascinated by the quotidian. We may tire of our everyday surroundings, but if we fail to note them, we dull ourselves to the phenomena of our lives. Bullion’s music is a reminder to look for the momentous in the familiar.","The Lisbon-based producer’s soft, contemplative pop centers around everyday memories, embracing repetition as a technique to reveal the novel in the ordinary.

Flood Dream,LEYA,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5e8b9de721440008a6cffc/1:1/w_160/Flood%20Dream_LEYA.jpg,2020-03-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leya-flood-dream/,NNA Tapes,"LEYA, the Brooklyn-based duo of harpist Marilu Donovan and violinist Adam Markiewicz, make purposefully ambiguous music and place themselves in an ambiguous context. The duo traverses the art world and DIY noise scenes, and their music revels in the tension between elegance and disquiet, subverting the stereotypes associated with their chosen instruments. It can sound equally gorgeous or unsettling, depending on mindset and circumstance; it asks more questions than it answers. LEYA’s second album, Flood Dream, is a refinement of the approach they introduced on their debut cassette, The Fool, in 2018. At its center is a tenuous relationship with beauty, highlighting the shifting, subjective nature of the concept itself. The duo renders beauty as it’s depicted in horror films—something that reveals a deep layer of foreboding, that foreshadows its own inevitable demise. Donovan’s harp, which she detunes at inconsistent intervals, places dissonance at the heart of every song on the album, even as Markiewicz traces long, aching melodies with his voice and violin. Each pluck of a string subtly destabilizes the song’s tonal center. The effect is visceral, like being tucked into soft bedding only to feel a spider slowly crawling up your leg. Though their music is rooted in classical traditions, at times sounding like a fractured half-remembrance of pre-Baroque chamber music, Flood Dream is structured like popular music. These are three- to four-minute songs, not extended compositions, with Markiewicz’s voice providing melody and momentum. He cites Cocteau Twins, specifically Elizabeth Fraser’s impressionistic, purely ornamental lyrical approach, as a key influence. The focus is on the sound of his voice, its tone and emotive qualities, rather than what he’s actually saying, adding to the album’s ambiguous nature. The harp and violin have heavy poetic associations, the harp especially symbolizing purity, grace, and refinement. Donovan’s approach to the instrument undermines those implications not only by introducing imperfection through microtonal dissonance, but also through the often-grave manner in which she plays and the way many of her phrases dissipate unresolved. “Mariah,” appearing near the end of the album, opens with Donovan’s harp surrounded by empty space as she slowly repeats four tone clusters, giving space for the wavering pulses of disharmony to reveal themselves. Album closer “Mary” ends as she traces an arpeggio upwards, leaving it hanging in the air without the final return to the root. LEYA’s work on the 2018 PornHub exclusive I Love You, directed by Brooke Candy, points to the fact that they have little interest in traditional notions of purity. Flood Dream is bewildering, and even after many times through, listening to it can still feel disorienting. By putting beauty and discomfort on equal footing, LEYA allows for transgressive perceptions of ecstasy to emerge. This is not inviting music, but it is remarkably open, like a door left ajar to a ravaged house, eerie and beckoning.

Traditional Techniques,Stephen Malkmus,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5e80180e27b00008f7bdae/1:1/w_160/Traditional%20Techniques_Malkmus.jpg,2020-03-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stephen-malkmus-traditional-techniques/,Matador,"Later this year, Stephen Malkmus will take part in a pair of Pavement reunion shows where, if the band’s reunion tour a decade ago is any predictor, he’ll dutifully play the songs fans expect to hear the way they want to hear them, then move on. Malkmus has never been subtle about his disinterest in nostalgia, but in truth, he’s never seemed especially interested in shaking things up, either. Since unshackling from Pavement, his solo albums with the Jicks have offered only the most minor variations on his wry, guitar-forward indie rock. Sure, one of them was produced by Beck, but could you really tell? Recently, something changed. With 2018’s beguiling Sparkle Hard, Malkmus delighted in unexpected whims, deploying string sections and digital vocal manipulation so skillfully you could almost forget they weren’t always part of Malkmus’s toolkit. And if that album’s one-and-done stylistic detours felt like a lark, then 2019’s Jicks-less Groove Denied, a laptop-driven tribute to early electronic music and post-punk, proved he could really commit. For Traditional Techniques, Malkmus once again picks a muse and sticks with it. It’s a folk album, an unexpectedly deft and learned one at that. Recorded with Decemberists multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk, Chavez/Zwan guitarist Matt Sweeney, and Afghan musician Qais Essar, among others, the project was devised as an excuse to toy around with all the acoustic instruments Malkmus observed in Portland’s Halfling Studio while recording Sparkle Hard. That’s the official telling, at least, but the final product suggests a long-simmering fascination with the sounds of the Middle East and a deeper reverence for psych-folk than anything hinted at by the stray Pavement folk jam or B-side. Malkmus is just as committed to stringed instruments as he was the bleating electronics of Groove Denied. But on that album, Malkmus was moonlighting; here he’s a devoted student of the craft. In addition to sounding gorgeous, all these mesmerizing dirges and close-mic’d 12-string guitars are a novel vehicle for Malkmus’s sublime shit talk. Over the balmy raga of opener “ACC Kirtan,” his lyrics defuse any suggestion of New Age mysticism with first-world problems. “The Duraflame’s wet/The ganache won’t set/Where are the rings for my sweet serviettes?” he yowls, alongside accompanist Joy Pearson. “Shadowbanned” lathers its cosmic drones into a heady psych jam, as Malkmus spray-bombs modern lingo inspired by the internet’s deepest, most conspiratorial corners. In the custom of so many of Malkmus’ best songs, it disguises its barbed prose behind an unassuming veneer of aloofness. Like Groove Denied, Traditional Techniques front-loads its most form-breaking statements. In its second half, the psychedelic edge softens, the woodwinds and sitars fade away, and what’s left is something resembling the straightforward acoustic album Malkmus never seemed interested in making. The songs aren’t flashy, but they’re tender and serene, and they center Malkmus’ voice in a way his previous records rarely did, especially “What Kind of Person,” maybe the most vulnerable song he’s written since “Church on White.” It’s not often Malkmus lets his guard down like this. Traditional Techniques has been retroactively billed as the third part in a trilogy alongside Sparkle Hard and Groove Denied. On the surface, the three albums have little to do with each other—each was recorded with a different lineup—but collectively they represent a shift in mindset. After years of arch relaxation at the indie rock spa, Malkmus has suddenly started recording like a man with a sprawling bucket list. And while Traditional Techniques easily succeeds as a curiosity, its songs continue to delight after the novelty wears off. The most surprising thing about the album isn’t how far Malkmus has strayed from his comfort zone. It’s how at home he sounds there.

I Think I’m Good,Kassa Overall,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e58039b19382e00087249c4/1:1/w_160/I%20Think%20I'm%20Good_Kassa%20Overall.jpg,2020-03-06 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kassa-overall-i-think-im-good/,Brownswood,"We live in a golden age of storytelling, however chaotic it may feel. Despite social fractures, amoral media platforms, and historical blindness (willful and otherwise), more individuals are telling their stories—in audio, video, words, images, sounds, computer programs, and new combinations—than ever before. Challenging assumptions about who is empowered to tell these stories and how, a more thorough picture of the world emerges, including truths that long lay unacknowledged. With access to a growing range of narrative tools and methods of distribution, the floodgates of rumination have opened—algorithms, copyright restrictions, and genre quarantines be damned. So it’s hard to imagine Kassa Overall’s I Think I’m Good as the product of any other age but this one, yet it’s also a timeless tale. A high-gloss, trap-jazz, Auto-Tuned singer-songwriter cycle about multiple consciousness, it’s a fragile diary of a young artist’s escape from the comforts of fear, aided by an incredible community of musicians who have his back. More broadly, it’s a kaleidoscopic cut’n’paste opus that bypasses prior, drier conversations about jazz and hip-hop sharing space—even Overall’s masterful 2019 debut, Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz—to express something much more personal, yet also universally relatable. Some of the greatness of I Think I’m Good comes in the blending of its design and function. The story that 36-year-old Kassa tells, integrating his own lifelong mental-health struggles with the incarceration and subjugation of black America, is in many ways completely novel; even more so is the way he tells it, in expansive song-rap compositions that have the intimacy of bedroom indie-folk murmurs. Until recently, Kassa’s rep rested on being a great young jazz drummer (with an overflow of credits—Geri Allen, Christian McBride, and Arto Lindsay, to name a few—and a stint in Jon Batiste’s band on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert). He also dabbled as a rapper and producer, including collaborations with Francis and the Lights and Das Racist. But his desire to synthesize collective improvisation, electronic production, and rap vocals has been the core of his recent live residencies at New York’s Zinc Bar and the Jazz Gallery, and Go Get Ice Cream approached the jazz/hip-hop discourse from this holistic live-playing-with-rapping-and-electronics direction. It also featured a great song called “Prison and Pharmaceuticals” (chorus: “What’s the best stocks?”) that is a direct thematic harbinger of I Think I’m Good. Another key precursor was the series of panic attacks that Overall experienced as a young Oberlin Conservatory student in the mid-’00s—one led to his temporary institutionalization—and his subsequent overmedication that went from stabilizer to long-term crutch. I Think I’m Good soundtracks this quiet, numbing struggle in tones both unsettled and empathetic. Beyond simply documenting his own interior dialogues, the album connects them—lyrically, but also sonically—to those of black men’s realities in dealing with Amerikkka’s criminal-justice system. Kassa’s narrative takes the shape of a hallucinatory collage, an almost-old-school mega-mixtape where themes and visions—of personal memories and familiar melody lines, song and sound fragments, a list of confidants from his life and career—flow effortlessly into one another. The blurring of his own medical experience with notions of incarceration begins with Kassa’s opening line: “I hope they let me go tonight,” he intones on “Visible Walls,” as Brandee Younger’s harp, Jay Gandhi’s bansuri flute, Courtney Bryan’s piano, and a chopped, hummed Auto-Tune melody set up an ominously hushed new-age mood. The childlike delivery of his opening plea in the follow-up (“Please don’t kill me in your sleep”) lands into the same unnerving atmosphere; Joel Ross’ vibraphone adds both melodic beauty and further textural destabilization, compounding Kassa’s chilling words that conflate the real and surreal (“Please don’t mind those chalk lines/They don’t know what’s inside of you and I”). Yet the songs also have musical escape hatches arranged into the claustrophobia. When Younger and Ross play short lead solo lines—the latter in a quick conversation with Theo Croker’s flugelhorn—the spaces unlock in ways that one can imagine growing expansive on stage, supporting evidence that, like the hesitant blues of the album title, Kassa doesn’t mean for it to be a completely dark ride. One thing that makes such glimmers of hope feel so poignant is the work’s insistence on biography, which grounds it as proof that, despite the lures set by society and individual minds, solutions are also within our grasp. There’s a personal touch in the disassociated and affected voices that litter the album’s landscape, and on the trap production strategies that simultaneously communalize the experience and compound the theme of schizophrenia, whether they take the form of nightmarish asides, philosophical musings, or in-studio instructions to musicians. There’s also a kind of natural narrative flow between the parts of I Think I’m Good that really are diary entries (young Kassa’s cover portrait, or “Landline,” a poetic youthful reminiscence of a kid wondering about “normal,” featuring his brother Carlos on the tenor) and those that are out-and-out role-playing. “Show Me a Prison,” a cautionary tale of the prison industrial complex, features an inmate character named Kassa, a guest turn by activist Angela Davis, and one of the album’s key role-switching lyrics, “There but for fortune, may go you and I,” courtesy of Phil Ochs. In the final biographical projection, “Was She Happy (for Geri Allen),” Kassa and Vijay Iyer eulogize the late pianist, who passed away in 2018 and who collaborated with both men. It closes the album on a psychedelic note, a light drone guiding their Rhodes-drums duet, punctuated by the answer to the songtitle’s question: “Was she happy?” “She was on a quest!” And what are quests but stories we construct ourselves, for ourselves, even if just by clicking “record” on a smartphone—or in Kassa’s words, on a “backpacker producer” setup he used to document a lion’s share of the raw materials here. It’s heartening that, even in what seems like a limited category, he’s hardly alone in doing this. It’s curious that I Think I’m Good is one of three extraordinarily ambitious recent albums by artists initially recognized as jazz drummers—alongside Moses Boyd’s Dark Matter and Jeremy Cunningham’s The Weather Up There—that combine internal monologues about their own lives with reflections on the social breakdowns happening all around them. In doing so, they have produced musical therapy sessions that chronicle the world as it actually is, and not as it is sold to us.

Anyways,Young Nudy,by: Israel Daramola,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4f085bf98c800008cf6820/1:1/w_160/Anyways_Young%20Nudy.jpg,2020-03-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-nudy-anyways/,Paradise EastRCASame Plate,"During his brief career, the Atlanta rapper Young Nudy has managed to stay both versatile and consistent. His demented, hypnotic rhymes, full of violence and drugs, initially made him seem a kindred spirit to his cousin 21 Savage. But just as 21 Savage has broadened his appeal, Nudy has also pushed against the borders of his trap sound. He might not boast the flash or obvious eccentricities of his peers, but the rapper born Quantavious Thomas is quietly one of the more unique artists to emerge from his city in years. His first tape, Paradise City, appeared in 2014, but his ascendance began in earnest in 2016 with his Slimeball series. Last year, he made his biggest splash yet with the feature-free surprise mixtape Faded In The Booth and Sli’merre, his collaborative project with producer wunderkind Pi’erre Bourne. The chemistry between Nudy and Pi’erre proved electric, and his new project Anyways expands on that mixtape’s jubilant bounce with some of the darker subject matter of his early work. Young Nudy's taste for experimental production helps distinguish him. The dreamy, cartoonish beat for “Blue Cheese Salad” and the stoned stupor of “A Nudy Story” add unexpected shades to Nudy’s villain mystique, while “Cap Dem” sounds like it was made for Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y rather than a trap artist. These counter-intuitive choices might be off-putting to those who prefer a murkier atmosphere with their street raps, but they keep his music feeling nimble and surprising. It helps that he raps his ass off. Anyways might be Nudy’s best technical performance, both in the variety of his flows and the calmness with which he croaks them out. On “No Go,” he manages to make giving directions to his frequent East Atlanta hangouts sound exciting. His rhymes bristle with energy, confidence, and vivid imagery (“Yellow tape surrounding you and your team/ I’m Majin Buu with the smoke, I blow the steam” he says on “Deeper Than Rap”). The trance-like quality of the production on the album lures you in, but Nudy’s commanding presence keeps you there. Anyways likely won’t drastically alter the arc of Nudy’s career or skyrocket him to success. It’s a quality street-rap record, one that should please his fans and maybe convert a few interested parties. But there’s something undeniable about the devotion with which he chisels away at his craft, like a sculptor obsessing over the curves and crevices of his work. He might never hit superstardom like some of his peers, but he keeps finding something worthwhile to say, and surprising ways to say it.","The Atlanta rapper shows off his ear for vivid imagery and counter-intuitive production on his new project.

Your Life Is a Record,Brandy Clark,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e580568ba238a00083083b1/1:1/w_160/Your%20Life%20Is%20a%20Record_Brandy%20Clark.jpg,2020-03-06 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brandy-clark-your-life-is-a-record/,Warner,"Plenty of songwriters could find pathos in a pawn shop. A small-town staple full of other people’s heirlooms, hawked at bargain prices—it’s an easy vessel for tugging heartstrings. Brandy Clark understands this. “No one goes into a pawn shop on the best day of their life,” she joked while introducing a new song, called “Pawn Shop,” at a recent concert. And yet, her ballad pleasantly averts expectations. It’s at once tragic and kind of pathetic, filled with conversational asides to remind you that this isn’t just any pawn shop: it’s a specific one, with a specific address (Charlotte Avenue) where her characters—a recent divorcee and a failed musician—choose to unload their well-loved possessions. “Someone told me it costs a lot,” she sings. “Man, ain’t that the truth.” A dejected mumble turned into a sweeping chorus, it’s a prime example of the Washington-born country songwriter’s gifts. Her lyrics are so sharp and conversational that it often takes a minute to realize just how much she’s saying. Take, for example, her 2013 song “Stripes,” where a woman assures her cheating partner that she’d risk spending the rest of her life behind bars to enact her revenge—only thing is, she’s not crazy about the wardrobe change: “I hate stripes,” she muses, “and orange ain’t my color.” Clark’s characters often find themselves in these situations, caught between fantasy and humdrum reality, rehearsing their comebacks as they study their own disappointed expression in the mirror.  Even when she worked behind the scenes, penning songs with artists like Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves, her distinct voice always came through: “This ain’t my mama’s broken heart” went the chorus to Lambert’s hit single co-written with Clark, and the message was clear: that song had already been written. It was her turn now. Clark’s third album as a solo artist, Your Life Is a Record, furthers her search for new stories, even if the emotional territory is more familiar. It’s a break-up album, less focused on wordplay and punchlines than universal truths. And while her songwriting continues to avoid the obvious path, her arrangements decidedly do not. Produced by Jay Joyce, an in-demand Nashville figure who’s worked with Eric Church and Keith Urban among many others, the album bursts with orchestral flourishes and horn sections, swelling to symphonic extremes that can feel distracting during the ballads and pointedly ironic on the lighter fare. The latter approach suggests the ornate, tragicomic work of Randy Newman, and indeed, the man himself lends vocals to a song called “Bigger Boat” that would fit seamlessly in his own repertoire. For Clark, it’s more of a stretch, especially considering the way her two previous albums—2013’s 12 Stories and 2016’s Big Day in a Small Town—paired intimate stories with textures to match. She now challenges herself to locate her characters in more dramatic settings, where their small-town worries feel colossal and cinematic. It’s a goal she alludes to in the opening “I’ll Be the Sad Song,” where she introduces the metaphor of life as a long but purposefully structured album. In that context, many of these songs might represent those moments when you just need to lose yourself in the sound. Even more than the attempts to soundtrack those helpless feelings (“Love Is a Fire,” “Apologies”), the best moments are when Clark fights through the heartbreak to find her own footing again. In a standout called “Can We Be Strangers” (as in, “We struck out as lovers/We struck out as friends”), she sings over a lush, easygoing groove about the perspective that comes once you’ve moved past missing the good times and you’re just trudging through the bad ones. Clear-eyed and defiant, it’s a breakup song for when you’ve worn out all the old breakup songs and you’re just ready to get moving again. A similar epiphany takes place in “Who You Thought I Was,” the album’s glowing centerpiece and one of Clark’s finest songs to date. It was inspired by an award-show speech from John Prine—another idiomatic writer concerned with our least romantic types of tragedies. When the 73-year-old icon found himself faced with a standing ovation, he addressed the crowd: “Well, I’m John Prine…but I’d like to go back to being who you thought I was.” His joke suggested a career-long discomfort with acclaim, but Clark sings of a more intimate dynamic. In the verses, she unfolds a lifetime’s worth of aspirations—to be a rock star, to stay young forever—and realizes that the closest she came was simply being in the presence of somebody who saw the best in her. It’s a sad realization, sung in the aftermath of a breakup, but she pairs it with the record’s most surprising and uplifting arrangement. Even when the words sound like the end of the road, the music pushes her to believe that maybe next time, she’ll get it right.

YHLQMDLG,Bad Bunny,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d895d19382e0008724f89/1:1/w_160/YHLQMDLG_Bad%20Bunny.jpg,2020-03-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-bunny-yhlqmdlg/,Rimas,"Not many parties start with someone contemplating suicide. Yet that’s how Bad Bunny chose to begin the video for “Si Veo a Tu Mamá,” the opening track of his second album, YHLQMDLG. We see a close-up of a despondent young man, standing on a stool and staring through a noose, ready to hang himself as a party buzzes around him. He’s saved by an empathetic little boy who understands his pain, and introduces him to the cure: Listening to Bad Bunny. It’s a macabre choice for a dance record, a collection of distinctly Puerto Rican party beats that pays homage to reggaetón’s past and future. And on its surface, the song, built atop a morose, Casiotoned version of the “Girl From Ipanema” bossa nova melody, might seem more suited for the elevator of a Florida nursing home than the club. But it’s also firmly aligned with the somewhat paradoxical ethos of YHLQMDLG (an acronym for Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana, or “I do whatever I want”). Bad Bunny might know what it feels like to be sad, but he also knows the path to salvation is believing in himself, and with that, he can do whatever he wants—and pull it off with swagger. Bad Bunny rose to stardom riding the Latin trap wave, crooning over beats constructed with 808 drums, bleeding synth bass, and narcotized atmospherics. It all borrowed heavily from the sounds of late-’00s Southern hip-hop, adding the idiosyncrasies of the flow en Español and a Caribbean POV. For YHLQMDLG, he reaches back even further to the glory days of reggaetón, sidelining Anglo guest stars for OGs like Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Ñengo Flow, and Jowell y Randy. YHLQMDLG plays like a mixtape for a San Juan marquesina—the underground garage parties Bad Bunny referenced on X 100PRE’s “Cuando Perriabas.” He curates a playlist of diverse perreo jams with a singular, unwavering focus: having fun. Where X 100PRE felt like a tightly sequenced statement of identity, YHLQMDLG is both looser and freer, a party record made by a young star with nothing to prove. The highlights are plentiful; early singles “Vete” and “Ignorantes” occupy the suave sadboi lane he’s best known for, but “Yo Perreo Sola” and “Bichiyal” rock raw, stripped-down reggaetón beats evocative of the genre’s “Gasolina” era. And he doesn’t completely abandon the sounds of the trap, either: The Anuel AA collab “Está Cabrón Ser Yo” could just have easily found itself on the Migos’ Culture III. From a production standpoint, the record is nearly flawless. The bulk of YHLQMDLG strikes a balance between reggaetón’s dembow riddim and an island-influenced Latin trap palette. Bad Bunny leans heavily on the production duo Subelo NEO, but also taps former Luny Tunes protege Tainy for a handful of songs. And even his dabbles in rock are expertly engineered—the emocore breakdown on “Hablamos Mañana” is so epic one might forget the tinny production that almost ruined X 100PRE’s otherwise catchy pop-punk foray, “Tenemos Que Hablar.” The mood is joyful throughout YHLQMDLG, updating some of early reggaetón’s darker, grittier textures with a bright tropical sheen better suited to Bad Bunny’s personality. The sequencing is a bit scattershot, but rather than distract, it keeps the classic reggaetón riddim sounding fresh across the album’s sprawling 20-song tracklist. A perfect example is the album’s centerpiece, “Safaera,” a self-contained microcosm of YHLQMDLG’s collage aesthetic. More suite than song, the five-minute reggaetón symphony changes tempos eight times and features a new beat nearly every verse. It seamlessly integrates recognizable hits—Alexis y Fido and Baby Ranks’ “El Tiburón” and Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On,” among others—without ever sounding stale. To find anything remotely like it you’d have to dig up one of DJ Playero’s mixtapes from The Noise era of reggaetón, which blended dancehall, reggae, and rap en Español into a sound that would ultimately coalesce into the reggaetón we know today. That these shadows of the genre’s history—from a time when it was so underground it was literally criminalized—have such a prominent place on one of the most anticipated pop records of the year is nothing short of remarkable. His ability to push reggaetón forward while paying homage to its past is commendable, but the way he uses visuals is of equal importance to his evolution into a pop star. On its surface, “La Difícil” is about a hard-to-get video vixen, a girl who knows that everyone wants her and uses it to her advantage. Yet the video itself feels infinitely more empathetic, giving a backstory to the women typically used as one-dimensional scenery in nearly every urbano video—in this case, a single mom who’s doing her best for her daughter. This is no aberration; as Bad Bunny’s budgets have swollen and his creative control solidified, he’s used the medium to flip the script on tropes that have made urbano feel stale, offering visibility to the underrepresented, or placing himself firmly in opposition to misogyny and homophobia. Genesis “Nesi” Rios’ missing performance credit on “Yo Perreo Sola”—a song defined by her hook—proves he still has some work to do. But even if he makes some of the same mistakes as his reggaetón forebears, he’s still doing more than most to bring progressive politics into the Latin mainstream. And when urbano’s brightest young star wears a skirt and nail polish on the Tonight Show, silently demanding we put respect on a murdered woman’s name, it brings us one step closer to a new standard of inclusion, and encourages marginalized people to live their truth in the face of oppression. Musically, one need look no farther than J Balvin’s post-2016 work for evidence of Bad Bunny’s influence on his peers, and while he looks up to his senior contemporary, he left a significantly larger impression on their collaborative LP Oasis. So even if he follows through on his threat from the album’s closing track “<3” —(“Y en nueve meses vuelvo y saco otro/Pa' retirarme tranquilo como Miguel Cotto” or “And in nine months I’ll return and drop one more/Then I’ll quietly retire like Miguel Cotto”)—not only will he have left behind a career’s worth of hits in just four short years, he’ll have reshaped urbano in his own image. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.","Bad Bunny’s second album is outstanding. It’s a big party record that pushes boundaries and pays homage to reggaetón’s past and future, all made by a swaggering star with absolutely nothing to prove.

PTSD,G Herbo,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d8aa3230d040009b1f403/1:1/w_160/PTSD_G%20Herbo.jpg,2020-03-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/g-herbo-ptsd/,Machine Entertainment GroupEpic,"G Herbo lives two lives. To some, the 24-year-old is simply a famous ex-boyfriend, an inescapable figure in the culture surrounding the Instagram-based rumor mill The Shade Room, which has closely documented his messy and complicated relationship with the IG-famous influencer Ari Fletcher (he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery earlier this year). At this point, I’m sure VH1’s Love & Hip-Hop would write Herb a blank check to let cameras into his life. But G Herbo doesn’t need reality television—at least, not right now—because he also happens to be a rapper that has helped shape the last decade of hip-hop. In 2012, a 16-year-old Herb released “Kill Shit” alongside Lil Bibby, a breathless marathon about trauma, pain, and Chicago life that helped lay the foundation for drill, arguably rap’s premier subgenre of the 2010s. By the time Herb was 18 years old, he had a classic Chicago mixtape and multiple street-level hits—his 2012 single “Gangway” has become timeless, so much so that Lil Uzi Vert flipped it into his comeback track “Free Uzi” last year. If Herb didn’t release another song past his teenage years, his legacy would remain, but his transition into the major-label rap cycle has been seamless. PTSD, G Herbo’s latest album, is proof that of his two lives, his rap half still takes precedent. Over glossier, high-budget production than usual and alongside a handful of rap’s biggest names, PTSD stays true to Herb’s core: first-hand tales of living with trauma and paranoia and failing to overcome that trauma and paranoia with drugs and success. He tells his stories in a fiery, deep voice, emphasized by a chilling album cover, which replaces the American flag’s 50 stars with faces of friends that he’s lost. From the Don Cannon-produced intro, which samples JAY-Z’s classic (and basement freestyle standard) intro to The Dynasty, Herb learns that the hardest battle is with himself. “Ain’t no lil bitty pill just gon’ heal a man/He can’t chill, he need a pill, guess he too militant/Oh, you just like us, they robbed you of your innocence, huh?” he raps, in a rapid-fire delivery that could be air-dropped into ’00s Harlem. Listening to Herb on the intro (and for much of the album) is like watching him argue with a therapist through a crack in the door. But Herb’s stories come to life when he has a partner to bounce off of. On “Party in Heaven,” alongside fellow former drill staple Lil Durk, the pair reflect over a beat chilly enough for a Drake time-and-location track. On “Lawyer Fees,” his rapping is so passionate he begins to swerve offbeat, interrupted only by Polo G’s grim hook: “Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak.” Eeriest of all is the Juice WRLD-assisted “PTSD”: “I made it on my own, they said I’d be in jail or dead/I’ve seen my brothers fall over and over again/Don’t stand too close to me, I got PTSD,” wails Juice. It’s a bleak song made even more so by Juice WRLD’s recent death, but there’s still a world where you can imagine it being catchy enough to fit within Hot 97’s daily rotation. PTSD’s missteps arrive when the album jettisons Herb’s rawness and begins to feel like any other album with access to major-label pockets. “Shooter” doesn’t sound like a G Herbo song; it’s like a record executive pieced together his vocals and tacked on a Jacquees chorus without Herb’s knowledge. The same could be said for the BJ the Chicago Kid-featuring “Gangstas Cry,” which is sappy, a tone Herb normally avoids. “Feelings” feels like the unification of Herb’s two worlds. He balances his demons (“I got diagnosed but I don’t want no crazy pills,” he admits) with reflections on his highly publicized relationship. “Talked to my kid mom today, that was kinda hard/Sick of all the drama in my life, we ain’t gotta start,” says Herb. It’s the type of honest and thoughtful song that directly connects PTSD to his early raps like “Kill Shit,” as Herb refuses to become yet another artist known more for headlines than their music.","The drill legend stays true to his core: tales of trauma and paranoia that feel like watching him argue with a therapist through a crack in the door.

World War,Davey Harms,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5817a8230d040009b1f01c/1:1/w_160/World%20War_Davey%20Harms.jpg,2020-03-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/davey-harms-world-war/,Hausu Mountain,"When Providence producer Davey Harms began releasing music, originally under the name Mincemeat or Tenspeed, he was a beat-driven outlier in the 2000s noise scene. Armed with only a looper and a phalanx of distortion pedals, Harms triggered pugilistic flurries of locked-groove beats. Dan Deacon was an early champion, telling Pitchfork in 2007 that Harms is “my favorite performer right now.” But when Zum Records boss George Chen spoke to the site in 2010 about releasing Mincemeat’s breakthrough, Strange Gods, he admitted that “hardcore noise people might not be inclined to include [it], because it’s fun and has a beat to it.” A decade later, Harms hasn’t changed his approach, but the noise landscape has undergone a tectonic shift towards club music. With his new album, World War, Harms taps into both contemporary noise and techno, combining their feverish energy in a thrilling, off-the-rails collision. Like Providence contemporaries Lightning Bolt and Container, Harms’ music is built on aggressive repetitions that amplify subtle variations. This quality intensified after Harms began releasing music on Hausu Mountain, the genre-melting Chicago label whose founders Maxwell Allison and Doug Kaplan were among Mincemeat’s early fans. On 2016’s Cables, released under his own name, Harms loosened his pedal-only set-up without compromising that barreling intensity. On Soundsystem, a 2017 follow-up credited to World War, Harms broke further from his comfort zone with dynamic rhythms to compliment his expanding instrumentation. Appropriate for an album named after one moniker and credited to his other, World War takes the best qualities from each release and produces a leaner, meaner fusion. At under 28 minutes, it’s Harms’ shortest and most potent release yet. World War snakes and soars over six tracks like the strange creature on its cover, half B-52 bomber and half Beetlejuice sandworm. “Dealer’s Choice” kicks into gear with thudding bass notes and an onslaught of drums, until a whining synth slithers into the frame. Harms’ favorite method of gradually piling on noise and polyrhythms persists, but with a small adjustment of trajectory, he manages to land in new destinations. “Position True” reaches in-the-red altitude only to navigate new peaks and valleys: Rattling drum loops and noise hit early, but by the halfway point the song reorients around a spartan synth rhythm as focused and insistent as minimal techno pioneer Robert Hood.  Still, there’s nothing wrong with hammering a beat into oblivion, and on “March of the Hoopleheads,” every brittle drum hit and grinding synth only provides more gas for the 4/4 juggernaut. In spite of the harshness, it sounds designed to tear through a techno set. Harms compliments World War’s bracing first half by entering his spaciest territory yet on its B-side. “Knowing Hand” adds trembling, tabla-like percussion and hovering synths that sound like a swarm of UFOs, while “Little Brother” builds to a loping techno groove that’s pleasantly loose compared to its tightly wound neighbors. The best surprise is closer “Survival,” a polyrhythmic swirl of spindly synths made all the more dramatic by its lack of momentum. After building pressure its entire run, World War finds a surprising payoff in this delicate final flourish. Harms’ cult classics hinged on endlessly ratcheting up the tension; World War shows he can refine his style while still searching for a new extreme.","The producer also known as Mincemeat or Tenspeed collides the feverish energy of contemporary noise and techno for his shortest and most potent release yet.

Rushing EP,Lucy Gooch,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e581d9dba238a00083083b6/1:1/w_160/Rushing_Lucy%20Gooch.jpg,2020-03-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucy-gooch-rushing-ep/,Past Inside the Present,"Reverb can be like a drug. It’s easy to overdo it, easy to become dependent upon it. Everything becomes beautiful inside its velvet cocoon; everything feels profound. A few years ago, there was a brief trend for remixes that electronically “stretched” songs into gaseous abstractions many times longer than the original versions, freezing them in a seemingly endless shimmer. The output invariably sounded substantial, no matter how lightweight the source material: A reworking of Justin Bieber’s “U Smile” turned the 16-year-old pop star into a “celestial choirboy.” But what sounded like magic was really just simple number-crunching. The technique involved digitally pulverizing an audio file and sustaining each grain of sound in cathedral-grade reverb, like so many dust motes floating in mid-air. The ease with which this simulacrum of grandeur could be attained demonstrates how easily artifice can become a gimmick, a cheap high. But newcomer Lucy Gooch belongs to a select list of musicians (Juliana Barwick, Grouper, Mary Lattimore) putting reverb to more artful ends—not simply painting on a veneer of readymade emotion, but using the technique to suggest a dimension beyond our ken. Rushing is the Bristol, UK musician’s debut release, and its five tracks are evidence of an unusually developed aesthetic vision, one that joins the atmospheric quality of ambient music with the structure of choral composition and the seeming effortlessness of pop. Gooch’s music sounds simple on the surface but teems with complexity underneath. “My Lights Kiss Your Thoughts Every Moment,” which opens the record, begins with airy sounds: the glimmer of what might be church bells, the echo of her voice wafting up to the arches of the nave. Below, a seismic synthesized bass tone rumbles the earth beneath our feet. In between those two poles shimmers a world of echo, masking the sources of her sounds. Turn it up loud enough and mercurial details flash out, like what might be the scrape of electric-guitar strings—part of the arrangement or just a trick of the mixdown? Who’s to say? The song’s lyrics are drawn from the poems of Rabindranath Tagore: “I have kissed this world/With my eyes and limbs/My life when young was like a flower/That loosens a petal or two/They flock around him like bees.” Gooch’s soft, clear voice is trailed by ghosts of itself; the music is rich with color and alive with movement, as layers of wordless singing swarm around her in slow motion. The feeling of weightless rapture recalls A Feather on the Breath of God, a classic recording of choral work by the 12th century Christian mystic Hildegard of Bingen. “Sun,” darker and heavier, is reminiscent of gloomy This Mortal Coil songs like “Waves Become Wings.” Once again, a sustained clanging sound hints at church bells in the distance; Gooch sings ominously of a disappearing sun, of arid fields, her voice turned thick and close, as though bouncing off the walls of a dry well: “All the water’s gone to drain.” She returns to the idea of water on “Stalagmites & Helictites,” whose title invokes surreal, biomorphic-looking cave formations formed by dripping water. Sonically, it’s the record’s simplest cut, just a series of stair-stepping vocal harmonies that fade into lengthy shadows, but it may also indicate a well-developed sense of self-awareness, if not outright irony: a song about caverns that sounds like it was actually recorded in one. The song that might be the record’s best actually downplays Gooch’s favored effect. In “Rushing,” her close-harmonized vocal loops spin in place while she solos on top of them; buzzing organ tones lend a liturgical atmosphere, but this time her voice is dry and untreated, almost as if she were in the same room as you. The lyrics are psalms taken from the Old Testament and rearranged into song form: “In his hands are the depth of the earth/And unfailing love/Do you know how the clouds hang poised?/The skies proclaim the work of his hands.” The subject matter hints at vastness, but Gooch’s songwriting is marked by its ease and intimacy; the arrangement is fleet of foot in a way that feels closer to pop music than ambient bombast. There’s always the risk of overreaching when trying to capture this kind of boundless yearning. But with “Rushing,” Gooch breaks off a small piece of the sublime and cups it in her hands.","On her beguiling debut release, the UK musician joins the atmosphere of ambient music with the structure of choral composition and the seeming effortlessness of pop.

The Main Thing,Real Estate,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e556b218f80bb000971ec63/1:1/w_160/The%20Main%20Thing_Real%20Estate.jpg,2020-03-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/real-estate-the-main-thing/,Domino,"When a rock band enters its second decade, fatigue sets in, no matter how successful their previous albums. It’s an existential problem most groups don’t live long enough to face; many that do choose to disband, finding they’ve run out of important things to say or interesting ways to say them. Some veteran acts take a collaborative approach, bringing in outsiders to expand their sound—Yo La Tengo’s annual Hanukkah performances have become a kind of indie-rock showcase, featuring younger artists like Snail Mail, while Conor Oberst found inspiration in kindred spirit Phoebe Bridgers. For Real Estate frontman Martin Courtney, survival similarly required ceding control to new contributors. Their resulting fifth album, The Main Thing, coats their suburban ennui in plush arrangements. The new vastness of their sound—the sweeping synth that opens the album on “Friday,” not dissimilar to the boot-up chimes of a MacBook; the shrieking strings that introduce “Paper Cup”—reflects not only their outsized ambitions (“We were trying to accomplish making the best record we’ve ever made,” Courtney said), but the physical distance separating the members. As he did on 2017’s In Mind, Courtney recorded their demos from hundreds of miles from most of the band, with only percussionist Jackson Pollis and keyboardist Matt Kallman remaining in their adoptive city of New York. Sylvan Esso’s Amelia Meath, a featured vocalist on “Paper Cup,” composed her own harmony for the part, further broadening the album’s palette. As a result, the The Main Thing has an ensemble feel, a give-and-take between the musicians that feels more like jam bands than indie rock. The title track—with its freewheeling drum fills and little jazz-fusion-inspired guitar solo—focuses on each player, rather than melting into hazy harmonies. The jammier moments come across as alternately goofy and genuinely self-serious, an appropriate mix for a band helmed by a father of three. Parenthood is at the forefront of Courtney’s lyrics here. Real Estate has always looked backward; even songs written ostensibly in the present tense were weighted with autumnal melancholia. There’s a slight twist to that formulation on “You,” in which Courtney bemoans the eventual anxieties his children will have to face: “Just dream your time away/I see no better use for it/For soon you’ll be awake/Then you’ll have to get used to it.” Sung dreamily over glassy guitar, it comes off like an oddly practical lullaby, a childhood cautionary tale filtered through the inevitability of adulthood. On “Silent World,” he speaks in harsher terms about his Catcher In The Rye-like desire to protect his children: “Can’t let you wander off/Out in this wicked world.” Courtney has mentioned a desire to be more outwardly political in his lyrics, in part to justify his band’s continued output during times of national strife. It’s a stretch to say that poeticized anxieties about adulthood, laid out by a pacifying tenor and backed by ornate arpeggios, rise to the level of protest music. But his lyrics instead touch upon a cognitive dissonance—between the personal nature of restless anguish and the broader societal forces that underpin it—that fits nicely with the band’s graceful guitars and rounded basslines. Elsewhere, despite the band’s claim that producer Kevin MacMahon asked them to carefully consider each word, the writing falls a bit flat. On the Lynch-penned “Also A But,” the glacial track references natural disaster through nuclear war metaphors that sound immediately dated (“Floating atop a mushroom cloud,” he sings as the song peters out). “Falling Down” traffics in shallow witticisms (“The wind’s the only thing that’s fully free”), redeemed only by Courtney’s tranquil delivery. Growth, on an album-to-album basis, can be difficult to measure for a band like Real Estate. Despite novel collaborations and a lush cornucopia of additional instruments, their basic patterns—open chords, lilting vocals—ground The Main Thing in a familiar context. The most memorable moments come with the small flourishes—a folksy piano accompaniment on “November,” pizzicato violins that swirl into a dramatic crescendo on “Falling Down,” programmed drum beats that blend the outro of “Sting” into “Silent World.” Interviews with the band evoke a palpable pressure to leave an imprint on the world, to make a new record feel necessary, and not simply obligatory. Real Estate doesn’t upend their own foundation; they instead find beauty in filling in its empty spaces.

Rakka,Vladislav Delay,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56d69a0db120000992396e/1:1/w_160/Rakka_Vladislav%20Delay.jpg,2020-03-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vladislav-delay-rakka/,Cosmo Rhythmatic,"An imagined pandemic salvaged the career of the elusive Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti. For nearly two decades as Vladislav Delay, Ripatti pulled together strands of minimal techno and beat-driven bombast, ambient glow and gnarly dissonance, making strange chimeras of oppositional moods. Delay’s best work, like 2000’s Multila, suggested hearing the thrum of a distant nightclub in some dangerous, unfamiliar land—enticing but ominous, as though reaching the source would be more trouble than it was worth. After 2014’s sublime Visa earned his music a role alongside the likes of Ryuichi Sakamoto and Hildur Guðnadóttir in the soundtrack to The Revenant, Ripatti disappeared. As if balking at the prospect of wider success, he sold most of his studio equipment and retreated into isolated experimentation. “I seem to self-destruct,” he later admitted. During the last few years, though, Ripatti repeatedly ventured far above the Arctic Circle, to locations so remote the sun sometimes doesn’t rise or set for days or months on end. Those arctic hikes helped inform his score for Ivalo, a Finnish television series where a mysterious virus that makes people exceptionally evil takes root in the icy region and spreads. Ripatti’s motifs for the show are what you might expect, like haunting electronic passages that suggest something monstrous and unspeakable or a curious pattern that reflects an investigator’s unresolved questions. But his experiences in the far North prompted Ripatti to consider the impact that such a harsh climate can have on a body and mind, how it can make simply living resemble an endless war, a struggle you will eventually lose. Rakka—his first album of new material in six years and the most compelling work of his career—is a breathless, terrifying newsreel about those battles with nature. In recent years, a horde of producers have approximated the sensations of black metal, originally a bristling response to the pleasantries of Scandinavian society and the perils of its environment. From WIFE to Ben Frost and even Fuck Buttons, these experiments have often been fascinating and occasionally thrilling. But with Rakka, Delay comes closest to replicating the form’s primal frisson—that is, music that feels as ecstatic as it does existentially doomed. He harnesses the power of blast beats without actually using them and mines the urgency of screams without ever opening his mouth, getting to the core of black metal’s function without co-opting its form. From end to end, Rakka thrives on instability and the fear it fosters. Its beats lock into a grid for only a minute or so at a time, allowing you just enough space to settle into a groove before dropping you into some cacophonous abyss. And its tones are so brittle that the sounds sometimes crumble like iron gone to rust, flaking into dust. “Rampa” slams between a minimal techno tick-tock and drum’n’bass bedlam during one 30-second span, between a rapturous nod to reggaeton and an industrial rush so acerbic it might make Prurient squirm during another. “Raajat” begins in a trance, its fluorescent hums swaddling arrhythmic paroxysms. But Delay slowly makes each element more severe, until the long tones suggest suffocation, the rhythms a fistfight. You fret over what comes next. This unpredictability is a simulacrum for the harshest aspects of nature, the sort that threaten human survival in a million different ways. During “Raataja,” concussive bursts of jungle drums and sudden surges of curdled static cut across a pretty loop of pink noise, like barbaric gusts of wind during a snowstorm. Just when you adjust to the cycle, Delay sustains the fusillade, a tireless series of body blows. But they vanish in an instant, leaving you to reel from the whiplash. In the two seconds of silence before closer “Rasite” begins, you recognize just how severe and exhausting those six minutes had been. Even “Rasite,” which wants you to believe it is a comedown, is a feint, emitting slow sighs of placid sound that ultimately coil, like a snake ready to strike. Delay offers reprieves only for the glee of taking them away. Many of the sounds here—eerie drones that hover like shadows, beats that are too big for their surroundings—recall Wolfgang Voigt’s recent work as GAS, especially 2018’s sprawling Rausch. But GAS’ records are forest baths in the dark, an invitation for immersion even if the night can seem a little scary. The environment that Rakka frames, however, wants to expel you without warning, pause, or mercy, if it cares about you at all. Here, nature’s very existence is a threat to your own. Rakka is compelling no matter the context, a breathless cycle of terror and retreat that mirrors stresses as ancient as extreme climates and as modern as our frenetic news cycle. But it’s also accurate. I’ve spent extended chunks of the last five years in the woods—sometimes above the Arctic Circle, sometimes trudging through feet of snow on the rim of the Grand Canyon. I listened to Rakka for the first time without knowing anything about it and immediately found myself transported beyond my headphones and back to those wild places, intoxicated by the rush of circumstances that could have killed me. Thanks to the ubiquity of cameras capturing the world’s most isolated locales, you can now see what the world looks like from the side of some razor-thin, windswept perch in the Rockies; turn up Rakka and close your eyes, and I swear you can also understand how electrifying it feels.","After selling his gear and nearly abandoning music, the Finnish producer returns from the Arctic tundra with a terrifying portrayal of nature’s violence.

My Turn,Lil Baby,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56ce610e27b00008f7b845/1:1/w_160/My%20Turn_Lil%20Baby.jpg,2020-03-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-baby-my-turn/,Quality ControlWolfpack GlobalMotownCapitol,"Lil Baby fell backward into music and made the most of it. Before 2016, he’d never rapped a word, but after serving a two-year prison sentence, he decided to give it a try, thanks to the prodding of Quality Control executives Coach K and Pierre “Pee” Thomas and his former classmate Young Thug, who paid him to leave his hood and go to the studio. After releasing seven projects in two years, the Atlanta artist took a year off and returns on his new album My Turn as something approaching a marquee act. The album title’s message is obvious: He is stepping into his star moment, but while his songs are pleasantly steady and well-balanced, he still has yet to really command attention on his own. Lil Baby is like the inverse of Young Thug. Where Thug is explosively unpredictable, Baby is reliably inert. His mellow, lilting raps have poise, but when they lock into a groove they lose all momentum. There are songs called “Solid” and “Consistent” here, and that tells you almost everything you need to know. The album is only saved by his minor improvement as a songwriter and lyricist. He is ready to embrace his notoriety, albeit cautiously. “I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people,” he hedges on “Emotionally Scarred,” a claim that seems to contradict the album’s baby goat-covered artwork. Much of My Turn concerns the familiar calls of street life and the uncertainty that comes with pursuing a rap dream at full tilt. “They want me catch a murder, I ain’t goin’ back,” he vows on “Commercial.” Baby keeps glimpsing the world he left behind in his periphery, and his most evocative writing finds him in between worlds; on “Same Thing,” he goes plain jane because the public associates bling with thugs, and on “Gang Signs” he returns home as a philanthropist and local legend. He’s trying to tell a story here, but he’s just not much of a storyteller—his bars keep the narrative going, but he doesn’t offer enough arresting imagery to make his scenes come to life. His supporting cast doesn’t do him any favors. Exchanges with Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, and Future can feel like adjusting from blurriness to the clarity of corrective lenses. Uzi is reading horoscopes on long flights and trying to spend enough money to bring Kobe Bryant back to life on “Commercial.” Baby loses a shop-off to the superior showman Future on “Live Off My Closet.” Even Baby’s best bar on “We Should” (“My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I’m God”) isn’t enough to outshine Thug’s Technicolor absurdity. It isn’t that Baby underperforms in any of these duets; on the contrary, he gives everything he has. But he doesn’t really have any charisma, or flavor, or personality. Sonically, the album has the same architects as his last two solo projects: in-house QC producer Quay Global, Tay Keith, and Wheezy. There’s additional production from Murda Beatz, DJ Paul, and Buddah Bless, most up to their usual tricks. The primary new contributor is recent Quality Control signee Twysted Genius, but he doesn’t have anything fresh to offer. With nine beats between them, Quay and Twysted Genius build out the bulk of the album, and they often sound like they’re working the same sample packs of synths, keys, hi-hats, and 808. Outside of the always-surprising Tay Keith (“Same Thing, “Commercial”), the refreshing DJ Paul (“Gang Signs”), and a soundtrack holdover (Queen & Slim’s Hit-Boy-produced “Catch the Sun”), the producers usually encourage Baby to color inside the lines. My Turn gets the most out of Lil Baby when he plays up the stakes, or as he puts it on “Sum 2 Prove”: “They don’t wan’ see us on TV unless it’s the news/I got somethin' to prove/Yeah, I’m young, but got somethin’ to lose.” “Hurtin” lingers in the losses he’s suffered but doesn’t succumb to them. “I’ve been bustin’ on that glizzy ever since I had got robbed/I done really beat the odds,” he realizes. On “Forgot That,” his song with his 4 Pockets Full signee Rylo Rodriguez, the raps come tumbling out of him, as he attempts to illustrate the work ethic he raps about through sheer exertion. It’s that same understated diligence that has fueled his star turn. But the album is all work and no inspiration.","The Atlanta rapper tries to tell the story of his rise to fame on his guest star-packed new album, but the music is all work and no inspiration.

Simulcast,Tycho,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56e7e90db1200009923974/1:1/w_160/Simulcast_Tycho.jpg,2020-03-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tycho-simulcast/,Mom + PopNinja Tune,"“Morale, like anything, is just another problem to be solved,” begins a chewy chapter in Anna Wiener’s Uncanny Valley, a memoir about the author’s time spent working in the neo-capitalist Platonic cave of San Francisco’s Silicon Valley. Heavy with the weight of corporate hubris, unchecked male ambition, and free nut mix, Wiener’s writing is an otherwise zippy babe-in-the-(Muir)-woods account, partway between a tell-all and a long piece of gonzo journalism, describing the dawn of the start-up bubble. Aside from detailing the morally ugly and aesthetically corny consequences of the Valley’s quick rise to becoming a living diorama of late-stage gentrification, the thrill of the book lies in watching a mass cultural movement assume a near-spiritual reverence for work. This is work as eternal pursuit of validation, work as shorthand for identity, work as a means for self-actualization and self-escape—work as a (if not the) justification for being alive at all. “They talked about achieving flow,” writes Wiener of her superiors, who RipStik gently around the office while taking conference calls and making insulting amounts of money, “a sustained state of mental absorption and joyful focus, like a runner’s high.” The idea of flow, a key tenet of corporate garbagespeak, is a fulcrum of the San Francisco-based musician Scott Hansen’s latest and most explicitly San Franciscan album, Simulcast. Operating under the Tycho banner, Hansen’s project—or, depending on your proximity to the creative class, entire brand identity—has become synonymous with a style of electronic patter so easily digestible that it approaches a degree of utility. Non-offensive, near-benign, and as if custom-built for the provocations of doing something else, Simulcast, like many Tycho works, is a reliably egoless experience, an art that approaches productivity-enhancing apparatus. Part of the pleasure of determining the breadth and scale of an artist’s hugeness is in scouting where their music proliferates and who it’s for. In Tycho’s universe, there are listeners, and there are use-cases. He exists in perfect symbiosis with streaming services’ mood-based offerings: Whether on a bevy of ready-made playlists from Spotify (“Chilled Vibes,” “Atmospheric Calm”) or across hundreds of user-made playlists titled with terms like “chill,” “study,” or, beautifully, “Adderall,” Tycho’s music has reached a state of ubiquity for the way that it softens or amplifies the blows of a daily rhythm. Much like the inescapable 24/7 streams by a YouTube channel titled ChilledCow, who owns the “lofi hip-hop radio” multiverse, Tycho’s work makes its implicit purpose to support, sustain, or beautify a brainspace. “I like how this music accompanies your mood, rather than strongly impose some emotions,” reads a top-upvoted comment on a YouTube upload of 2011’s Dive, whose viewership currently clocks 33 million views. But Tycho’s music lies just this side of the utter artistic facelessness baked into the “beats to relax/study to” or “beats to sleep/chill to” streams; there will always be a small fistful of flags that alert you to the fact that you’re experiencing a Tycho song. There will be soft exhalations, pillowy radar loopings, cottony breakbeats, and extremely liberal inspiration from Boards of Canada. There will be album art with high-contrast sunsets. There will be warm electro-acoustic mist. There will be tabletop synth patterning that bobs harmlessly up and down a scale. Simulcast blankets all of these suggestives under a weighted duvet: The album is an instrumental companion to 2019’s Grammy-nominated Weather in which each track carries the satisfying airtightness of a meditation app with deluxe features. (Cannily, the album announcement for Weather was accompanied by a literal web app.) Simulcast—a portmanteau of “simultaneous” and “broadcast,” like a live feed of a presentation played on several screens across a multi-bureau organization, is actively inspired by Hansen’s three-fold vision to strip the vocals from his last album, find peace in a chaotic world, and honor San Francisco’s beaches. As a result, the whole thing is not unlike finding yourself transfixed by a desktop screensaver of an ocean. The work provides brief moments of happy fizz that unquestionably belong to Hansen’s hand. Tracks crescendo and decrescendo with peak points at equidistance on nearly every track. “PCH,” named after the sinewy highway that crescents California, is like easy-listening IDM; “Alright,” with its dilating snare buildups, is post-rock-on-the-sea; “Stress,” whose title suggests the thing one is dodging, is a beautifully limp exercise in motivational drum progressions that seem calibrated for the cubicle. As Hansen notes on a post of his handmade artwork for the track, “if you’re going to be stuck in a room, might as well put up some nice wallpaper.” That Tycho’s music functions as a mental masseuse for the 21st century open-office drone, or a mood stabilizer for the nervous, is a fundamentally benevolent thing. Hansen, who has spoken with gravity, candor, and self-awareness about his music as an aid—whether of concentration or attitude—offers, in his own way, a mildly noble service. Here, it’s difficult not to summon the mother of all sound-as-motivational-mechanisms—the much-maligned Muzak Corporation, founded in 1934—and their Stimulus Progression series: fifteen-minute tracks of background instrumentals meant to give the listener a boost of productivity over the course of an hour. Early emissions of Muzak were billed as “functional music,” responding to the need to “fill the deadly silences” of the office, there to drown out human complexity for the sake of getting something done. But human complexity often demands volume. Simulcast, in contrast, could be confused for interstitial podcast filler tagged “uplifting” and “electronic.” It might be background music for prescription drug commercials or a public university’s sizzle reel; music to soundtrack health food emporia, CBD dispensaries, entire theatres of retail operations with target audiences of Instagram users between the ages of 20 and 35. Tycho suggests a host of signifiers that spool into one another like a lorem ipsum of a certain type of contemporary aesthetics: kaleidoscopes, foliage, triangles; hand-lettered typography, galaxy prints, stickered Nalgenes, new bars in newly named neighborhoods. These things are not inherently bad, but they proliferate, at this point, almost to a point of unmeaning. I fear—as Wiener writes of San Francisco, smoothed by all that flow—that it is “all beginning to look like a generic idea.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","This instrumental companion to the San Francisco electronic musician’s 2019 album Weather is unfailingly mood-stabilizing and office-friendly, like a desktop screensaver of an ocean.

La vita nuova EP,Christine and the Queens,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e599abf0e27b00008f7bbb5/1:1/w_160/La%20vita%20nuova_Christine.jpg,2020-03-03 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/christine-and-the-queens-la-vita-nuova-ep/,Because Music,"Chris is gentle and tough, masculine and feminine, subtle and direct, a pop singer with high-art ambitions. La vita nuova, a five-song EP and its accompanying short film, is about the psychic effort required to maintain the balance. On the cover, Chris appears pensive, part Ziggy Stardust, part Degas portrait. She calls it a project about vulnerability, though it’s also about grace and interiority and the illusion of effortlessness, the same attributes that mark her as a true star. If you’re looking for the party, you’re in the wrong place: Shorter and sadder than 2018’s Chris, La vita nuova has fewer big synth swoops and slower tempos. Produced by Chris alongside debut album collaborator Ash Workman, its cool, aquatic surface ripples with subtle vocal manipulations and whispery background samples. “People, I’ve been sad” is an open apology to a world its author can’t bear to face, like a note from the friend who misses you but still won’t return your calls. “You know the feeling,” Chris offers, opening a door within herself to reveal a mirror. Her imagistic writing remains spare as ever, making a game of revealing concealed emotion by rendering it in multiple languages. Last year was the year of “Gone,” Chris and Charli XCX’s duet about sadness and sexual tension; the Caroline Polachek duet “La vita nuova” is a worthy successor. Their verses in Italian are a mutual affirmation of passion, but the chorus, in English, mourns the partner who won’t dare to show their love. “Heartbreakers,” Chris cries, “I never take their answer for sure.” Throughout, she seems like someone who’s just emerged from a breakup, still sorting through the raw emotion. “Do you think there’s only one thing to do/To write a song about you?” she asks on “Mountains,” a wistful sketch of a lapsed connection. Other times her stance is not so clear-cut: Perhaps the selfish, possessive lover she addresses in “Je disparais dans tes bras” is not a lover, but the flattening gaze of fame—not merely the pain of unrequited love, but of the impossibility of being her full self in the eyes of others. Most spectacular is the accompanying short film, a five-song music-video narrative set in Paris’ sumptuous Palais Garnier opera house. Directed by Colin Solal Cardo, the story is a supernatural drama of a performer’s life, following Chris through a rooftop dance solo and a group rehearsal to a climactic vampire ball that pairs her with Polachek for a lusty duet. Chris appears in virginal white and then in shiny black pleather, a heavily symbolic heroine uniting the sacred and profane. It is astounding to watch Chris’ particular vision play out in this location—a genre iconoclast defining her own scene in a lavish 19th-century Parisian theater. It recalls a story from her youth that she relayed to The Guardian a few years ago, how once, at drama school where only boys were permitted to direct plays, she defied the administration by staging her own. With its Thriller-esque flash and tomato-red fake blood, the film La vita nuova looks like a kind of theater-kid fever dream. But that’s what theater is for: The emotions that feel too unruly, too ambiguous, to survive in the real world. They need space, just as dancers do, and Chris’ could fill the house.

Ordinary Man,Ozzy Osbourne,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56cbdf0db1200009923969/1:1/w_160/Ordinary%20Man_Ozzy%20Osbourne.jpg,2020-03-03 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ozzy-osbourne-ordinary-man/,Epic,"Since the mid-’90s, Ozzy Osbourne has been so famous he only needed to show up. In 1996, by then years removed from his last great album, he launched the annual metal circus that borrowed his name. He soon became an early star of reality television, a lovably mumbling patriarch in a family of salacious misfits. He no longer needed to strive to make great music; he just had to be on time for an annual summer of sets and, like, get really bummed about jogging on his birthday. Despite becoming a global brand, Osbourne’s solo records have always been surprisingly audacious, as if the man most synonymous with heavy metal itself still had something to prove. And so it goes with Ordinary Man, his first LP in a decade and his finest in two. Produced and co-written by Andrew Watt, the name behind recent pop hits by Cardi B and Justin Bieber, and featuring a murderers’ row of veteran hired guns like Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and Guns N’ Roses bassist Duff McKagan, Ordinary Man is an enormous record. Full of gospel roars, symphonic swells, and massive hooks, the music cuts between doom, pop-punk, and even a little hair metal. Even as Osbourne, now 71 and recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, croons “When I speak my final words/What will it feel like,” he sounds as ambitious as he’s been for half a century. Osbourne has often flirted with trends without actually chasing them. For 1995’s Ozzmosis, he mined the same sad soulfulness as one of his acolytes, Chris Cornell, whose own more tensile version of Osbourne’s yearning voice made him a superstar. And 2010’s Scream—his most recent studio album, as uneven as a season of The Osbournes—reimagined him for audiences that loved Disturbed or alternative rock. (Aiming for Foo Fighters, he only got close to Collective Soul.) For Ordinary Man, Osbourne and his coterie of co-writers pursue a more conceptual trend: the playlist. These 11 songs feel like a loose mixtape, flitting among a half-dozen moods and motifs in what feels like a methodical quest for streaming placement. For most of Ordinary Man, that approach provides inspiration for the restless Osbourne. As unlikely as it seems, “Under the Graveyard” is one of the most memorable doom spirituals ever from the singer who practically invented them, the lamentations of a lost soul coiling into a triumphant chorus. Half a plea for the release of death and half a reckoning with the solitude he imagines it will entail, it is a paean to perpetual dissatisfaction—with sobriety or indulgence, life or death, heaven or hell. Despite the shadow of age, disease, and mortality, there’s childlike glee here, too. “It’s a Raid,” a thrashing hardcore tirade about state surveillance featuring Post Malone, explodes in an ecstasy of rebellion. The irrepressible boast “Straight to Hell” is delightful, if only because of the way Osbourne rhymes “celebrate” with his vow to make you “defecate.” Resist all you’d like, but it’s hard not to smile when he mutters “I’m on the menu/Are you hungry?” like some impudent schoolboy during “Eat Me.” Mining the bluesy sway of Down and a dozen other Sabbath-loving Southerners, the band matches this bravado line by line. But the lack of focus means that the misses—when Osbourne aims for “November Rain” grandeur or “Iron Man” menace, for instance—are flagrant. A duet with Elton John, the title track is a maudlin ballad about surviving the excesses of fame only to realize you’re going to die, anyway. “I don’t wanna say goodbye/When I do you’ll be all right,” Sir Elton solemnly swears. Pompous and overwrought, the song is so self-serious it mostly makes you glad you’re not a frail old rock star, too, anticipating your own eulogies. “Scary Little Green Men”—a paranoid tantrum about how the aliens are creeping into your mind, bro—awkwardly seesaws between Foreigner-style rhapsodizing and Motörhead-lite browbeating. Noncommittal and unconvincing, this is Ozzy, desperate for topical #content. That quest for relevance highlights the deepest issue with Ordinary Man, the feeling that haunts you even as you enjoy it. Osbourne has struggled with intelligibility for decades, but he somehow sounds like he’s 25 here, flying and diving inside his historic range like the drinks and drugs never happened. You can’t help but remember the way Rick Rubin captured Johnny Cash or Joe Henry showcased Solomon Burke, showing the wrinkles inside their legendary voices during their final years. Ordinary Man instead feels like a preemptive holographic interpretation of Ozzy, a digital patchwork of his voice standing in for the real thing. He sings about decades of hard living and the nearness of death, but his voice bears no evidence of that wear and tear. Yes, Ozzy sounds great, but that sound leaves you wondering, once again, if he had to show up at all.

Expectations,Katie Pruitt,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5d6bf965d24e000822a762/1:1/w_160/Expectations_Katie%20Pruitt.jpg,2020-03-03 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katie-pruitt-expectations/,Rounder,"Katie Pruitt wrote her debut album alone, but her music summons a community: bursting with drama, flourished with strings and organs, gathering to emotional crescendos that seem designed to draw a crowd. In a recent interview with The Boot, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter described how each track represents a turning point in her life: the moment she came out as gay, the hard conversations that followed, the resulting discomfort in the suburban Georgia Christian community where she grew up, the way it all affected her relationship with her girlfriend. The music reflects these personal trajectories. Her songs are patient but determined, navigating serious subjects with quiet familiarity. Although she came up around Nashville country venues, Pruitt writes songs that feel more aligned with the last few years of indie rock. Her penchant for stately ballads with choruses to shatter glass recalls similarly introspective but explosive work by Julien Baker, while the title track pulses with the roller-rink soft rock of Jenny Lewis’ latest records. Though the label offered to pair her with bigger names, Pruitt chose to produce the album with her friend Michael Robinson, a collaborator dating back to her days playing the weddings-and-parties circuit in college. You can sense their trust in each other: Every track is given space to unfold, building into a record that feels deeply thoughtful and unified, in step with her contemporaries yet detached from any particular scene. Along with the grand arrangements, Pruitt’s lyrics, written over four years, bind the album together. At times, she seems to respond to herself with a momentum that feels almost chronological. To the listless narrator in “My Mind’s a Ship (That’s Going Down),” there’s the casual pep talk in “Expectations.” For the painful dissonance that drives her to resent herself in “Normal,” there’s the emboldened push to follow her intuition in “Loving Her.” Giving voice to characters who feel left out by society, Pruitt occasionally runs into the same clichés that tend to box them in. But as soon as she echoes that received wisdom—say, a refrain about how the truth can set you free in “Searching for the Truth”—she exerts her own skepticism: “Everybody’s full of shit, there’s no denying,” she sings in the chorus. Many of her lyrics proceed this way, comparing lessons she thinks she should have learned by now to the ones she’s actually living day-to-day. “I used to be ashamed to write a song that said her name,” Pruitt sings of a partner in her breakout single “Loving Her.” One of several songs that describes a struggle to feel comfortable around her own family and friends, it reckons the need to be heard against the lingering desire to hide. Her songwriting now makes no such concessions, and even her singing expresses a surging confidence; her voice could carry pop songs and torch ballads, but she instead pairs it with starker, slower narratives, highlighting characters whose doubt drives them as much as their convictions. It’s complicated subject matter from a young songwriter, and Expectations arrives with the great unburdening of saying how you feel after years of keeping it inside.

Everlasting Spring,Matt LaJoie,by: Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56d045230d040009b1eed0/1:1/w_160/Everlasting%20Spring_Matt%20LaJoie.jpg,2020-03-03 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/matt-lajoie-everlasting-spring/,Flower Room,"If the word “stream” hadn’t been so normalized by how everyone listens to music these days, it would be exactly the perfect word to describe Matt LaJoie’s new album. In both its effect and its creation, the gorgeous new Everlasting Spring is streaming. The music feels like an afternoon by a slow-moving creek, surface reflections peacefully changing with the light. Across four one-take improvisations on 10-string acoustic guitar run through a delay loop pedal and reverb, LaJoie’s extended pieces ripple and cascade, grow intricate, and thin out again. As co-proprietors of Brunswick, Maine-based Flower Room Records, either LaJoie or his partner Ash Brooks have been participants in each of 39 releases they’ve put out since 2017. Between the custom cassettes based on star charts and Bandcamp shots depicting tapes next to crystals, it’s tempting to fold LaJoie and Flower Room’s output into some corner of the New Age revival. But not only does LaJoie display commanding technique on Everlasting Spring, he also evolves his creative voice. There’s nothing raw or folkie about Everlasting Spring—it might be more accurate to file LaJoie’s solo playing under American Progressivist. There is a lightness of step behind LaJoie’s loops. It’s celestial without being sleepy, and rarely stays still. During the 13-and-half-minute “Showers Over Birch Point,” LaJoie plays in several modes at once to create the sensation of multiple currents. Occasional muted notes on the bass strings make slow ambient bursts of rhythm, mid-range harmonic dots follow at their own pace, and LaJoie solos gently on the highest strings. All accumulate to keep the piece in motion. The 16-minute album-closing “River’s Breadth” is slightly more minimalist, building to a quiet conclusion, in which LaJoie juggles two lead lines, one fast, one slow, each gorgeous. In part because of the improvised nature of the music, and in part because of Flower Room’s prolific release schedule, there is the sense that one could wander away from the label and new records would just spring eternal without ears to hear them. Dipping further back into the Flower Room’s catalog, LaJoie’s earlier solo releases over the past two-plus years do sound like the same mood altered slightly, depending on the weather. But that underlying source, LaJoie, is the core of these ever-changing permutations throughout the rest of the Flower Room catalog. And while Everlasting Spring is atmospheric, it’s not necessarily background music. It’s proper foreground company, an album to hang out with and fill the room like any other. As blissed-out as Flower Room’s total output is, it changes session by session, moving somewhere between mountain and ocean, with a long way yet to go.","The solo guitarist’s latest album on the prolific Flower Room label is subtly progressive.

Suddenly,Caribou,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5402da0db12000099236a2/1:1/w_160/Suddenly_Caribou.jpg,2020-03-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caribou-suddenly/,Merge,"Over the past decade, Caribou has been whittling down his music. Dan Snaith’s songs were once a constant swirl of brightly colored baubles, as pleasingly jumbled as the view through a kaleidoscope. With 2010’s Swim, the muddle began coming into focus. The melodies were brighter, the beats more direct. Things got sharper still on 2014’s Our Love, which filtered the pleasures and anxieties of domesticity through the prism of house music at its most ebullient. That simple title spoke to Snaith’s growing interest in getting at the essence of things. The emotions he was grappling with were complicated—in interviews, he spoke eloquently about the trials of marriage and fatherhood—but he had a way of framing messy feelings in bold strokes. The album’s biggest song, “Can’t Do Without You,” featured few lyrics save its titular refrain, repeated over and over, turning its ambiguous double negative into a mantra-like affirmation. Suddenly is more stylistically varied than Our Love or Swim, but it’s also the most direct that Snaith has sounded. Many of its standout songs are just two or three minutes long, perfect models of pop economy. The anthems are punchier: The dusty boom-bap of “Home” is the platonic ideal of a rare-groove edit, “Never Come Back” the epitome of a piano-house barnstormer. There’s nothing generic about even his most exacting genre studies: A Caribou song will always sound first and foremost like a Caribou song, thanks in part to Snaith’s distinctive falsetto, which graces every song here. There are no bum notes, no wasted motions, no corners of the audio spectrum left untouched. Snaith’s beat-making has gotten more adventurous, too. He flits between rock, trap, UK garage, disco, and more, sometimes touching on two or three styles in the course of a single song. His drums are sharp and every hi-hat and cowbell is rendered in crisp hi-def and seems to hover in mid-air, like a 3D image. In this heady precision, Suddenly can be an almost dizzying listen. Caribou’s music has never leaped from the speakers quite the way it does here. That outward clarity masks the growth in Caribou’s songwriting. Snaith has rarely been a strictly autobiographical lyricist, but not all of Our Love’s tales were as elegant as “Can’t Do Without You”. He has said that he’s the kind of person who might not know the lyrics to his favorite song, and on Our Love, you could tell. The lyrics felt more like placeholders, cue points where listeners might project their own more detailed experiences. Suddenly follows a period of turmoil in his extended family—a string of death, divorce, and other assorted shrapnel that falls within the blast radius of middle age—and, coincidentally or no, his writing has improved greatly. The stories he’s telling feel more substantial, as does his ability to assume the voices of a wider cast of characters. He still has a hard time resisting the pull of an easy couplet; the album is peppered with rhymes like “know” and “grow,” “in the past” and “here to last.” But he tends to use his voice as just another source of tone color. It is, truly, a lovely instrument, as limpid and azure as the photograph of water on the album’s cover. Snaith’s principal strength remains his skill as a musician and producer. He’s got hooks for days, and you could heat a single-family home by the warmth of his chord progressions. Virtually every song has some little detail that makes you lean in closer. There’s a marvelous moment in the opening “Sister,” in which the synthesizer detunes by just a few cents, almost imperceptibly, just enough to change the temperature in the room. “Like I Loved You” features a rippling jazz-guitar solo from Colin Fisher, the album’s only guest musician, that rolls like marbles on the deck of a boat. In “Sunny’s Time,” tape-warp effects give the song’s central piano melody the texture of shirred silk, while a gruff hip-hop sample is chopped to ribbons and filtered in a way that accentuates the grain of the rapper’s voice, which is rendered all but unintelligible. It’s a fresh, surprising choice: Producers have been cribbing funk breaks like the one Snaith grabs for “Home” for decades. But by zeroing in on that gravelly vocal texture, “Sunny’s Time” gives Suddenly the feel of being in conversation with mainstream popular music—or eavesdropping on it, anyway. Listen through enough times, and you may think you hear more songs than are listed on the sleeve. Time and again, songs feint left in their final minute or two. “New Jade,” a kind of psychedelic, maximalist R&B, suddenly flips into a gothic snippet of synth and flanged guitar, like something off the Cure’s 1980 album Seventeen Seconds. The chunky soul of “Home” gives way to fingerpicked folk guitar. And “Lime,” a jazzy house tune in the vein of Theo Parrish, abruptly stops and cuts to a much slower sample of Black Soul’s “The Sphynx,” a dirge-like meditation from 1975. This collage-like construction most likely reflects the way the record came together: Snaith has said that in the five years since Our Love, he amassed an archive of 900 loops and sketches, the products of his daily studio practice. The stragglers that seem to have snuck in here, under cover of the completed songs, are a big part of the record’s charm: They enliven the mood and keep things moving. All these trap doors sometimes give the impression that there’s another album hiding in the shadows of Suddenly, like those vinyl records that have a secret track carved between the grooves of another song. It can be tempting to wonder what that hypothetical album might have sounded like, and where Snaith might have wandered had he given free rein to his experimental instincts. The mood throughout is so sweet, the harmonies so reassuringly consonant, that I occasionally long for a little more discord. In paring back, it sometimes feels like Snaith is holding back; I miss the occasional overload of Swim, where Caribou’s newfound discipline gave way to his psychedelic second nature, and it felt as if the tape couldn’t take all the input that he was throwing at it. Suddenly, in contrast, is almost all business—with a few salient exceptions, the most moving of which comes right at the end. Album closer “Cloud Song” begins as a meditation for voice and unaccompanied synth, but it builds and builds—layers accruing, waveforms morphing, harmonies slipping out of tune. “I’m broken, so tired of crying/Just hold me close to you,” he sings, as a flood of frequencies gushes forth from his electronics. In this brief moment, all the control of the previous 40-odd minutes is washed away. Witnessing Snaith in full command of his talents is gratifying. But this moment where it all threatens to fall apart is what makes his music feel not just relatable but consequential.

Fungus II,Wasted Shirt,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56c7640e27b00008f7b841/1:1/w_160/Fungus%20II_Wasted%20Shirt.jpg,2020-03-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wasted-shirt-fungus-ii/,Famous Class,"Ty Segall has never been a wallflower. The Southern California garage-rock prodigy rivals fellow scene members (Thee) Oh Sees in prolific output, producing a wealth of records and side projects that, in aggregate, form a wall of brash, defiant noise. His cover of Funkadelic’s “Hit It and Quit It,” from 2018’s excellent Fudge Sandwich, is emblematic of both his playfulness and his gnarly psychedelia: Popular music goes in one side of Segall’s reverse-exorcism machine and comes back fast, screechy, and rude. Wasted Shirt, Segall’s joint project with noise rock iconoclast Brian Chippendale of Lightning Bolt, takes the alchemy a step further. The duo’s individual efforts have earned them well-deserved reputations as devoted experimentalists; their collaboration on Fungus II (they skipped right over installment I) represents two artists pulling each other closer to dangerous, interesting edges. Their brand of amelodic pandemonium has the same risky yet satisfying quality of watching acid burn through steel. The majority of the 12 songs on Fungus II clock in around three and a half minutes, brisk heirs apparent to Black Sabbath that sound ready to soundtrack skate videos. They’re abrasive, but like so much of Segall’s oeuvre they also telegraph a kind of fanboy earnestness—the baroque, metalhead shredding that might imply an inferiority complex in the hands of a lesser musician instead reads like homage, a love letter to blown-out speakers and the hours after a killer session of “Magic: The Gathering.” Some tracks accomplish this bombast more successfully than others. On “Double the Dream,” reverb pings in each ear as Chippendale attacks the kit and and Segall shrieks: “Dream, dream!” The song ends with the sound of tape unspooling, racing towards the next set of ears. This propulsive quality owes a great deal to Chippendale’s rabid snares and cymbals, and it’s what makes many of these tracks so bracing. “I’m my own man/Yes, I am a hostage,” Segall groans on “Fist Is My Ward,” sounding positively deranged as Chippendale’s rhythms skitter behind with frightening speed. When every song attempts the same jaws-of-life intensity, though, a few are bound to feel comparatively dim. “Harsho,” a midtempo vision of driving with “blood on the highway/blood on the wheel,” doesn’t accomplish the same menace as the songs surrounding it. The wild acoustic strumming and heavy ramp-up two-thirds of the way through “The Purple One” would stand out on another record, but beside Wasted Shirt’s weirder, wilder fare, they’re less remarkable. On the seven-minute closer “Four Strangers Enter the Cement at Dusk,” the pair takes another approach: a deliberately plodding, reverberating walk-up to the cataclysmic moment when both musicians let loose and embrace basement-show chaos. Lengthy, instrumental indulgence is the point; the song showcases Segall and Chippendale’s adept interplay, balancing one’s fever with the other’s sanguinity, and then trading those roles or abandoning them altogether. Their chemistry is unmistakable. Fungus II is its alien-baby result.

Printer’s Devil,Ratboys,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5060655d1a220008b9043a/1:1/w_160/Printer%E2%80%99s%20Devil_Ratboys.jpg,2020-03-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ratboys-printers-devil/,Topshelf,"On their earliest releases Ratboys tagged their sound “post-country,” but you really had to squint to hear the country. The twang on their 2017 album GN was more implied than explicit, and the music cozily straddled the line between woozy guitar pop and homespun folk. The whole album seemed to exist in a blissful state of in-between. GN was a gem, the kind of album that’s hard to replicate, and on their follow-up Printer’s Devil, Ratboys don’t even really try. Years of sharing stages with punkier bands like PUP and Dowsing has thickened and toughened their sound, as has the solidification of a full-time rhythm section after years of touring with rotating drummers. Printer’s Devil is Ratboys’ first album as a four-piece, and there’s no mistaking the difference. That riff-forward makeover brings them closer to the alt-pop of bands like Charly Bliss and Speedy Ortiz. On the surface that’s a step toward anonymity—not a lot of bands shared GN’s tender, ephemeral reimagining of Americana, while plenty share Printer’s Devil’s debt to the Veruca Salt lane of ’90s alternative. But it rips convincingly: The classic rock-spiked “Look To” is pure speaker candy, the kind of unabashed windows-down moment that GN’s muted production didn’t allow, while the guitars on “Anj” sizzle like early Paramore. Even when working with less-novel sounds, singer Julia Steiner has individuality to spare, both as a vocalist and a songwriter. She’s not a howler. Instead she works her frayed voice like a pair of kitchen shears, doing her damage not through broad swipes but well-placed snips. Her warmth and whimsy seeps through even Printer’s Devil’s grungiest songs. Like Doug Martsch, Jenny Lewis, and David Byrne before her, she captures how childhood confusions linger into adulthood. And like those songwriters, her cleverness never masks her vulnerability. On “I Go Out at Night,” one of the record’s rare softer numbers, she pictures herself in “a job uninstalling ’90s payphones,” a wry image but also a wistful metaphor for growing up. Ratboys demoed the album in Steiner’s empty childhood home just after it had been sold, which she’s said was as emotionally taxing as you’d expect. That experience may account for the extra ache in these songs. Steiner fills Printer’s Devil with half-remembered snapshots of adolescence—sprints down hills in the summertime, a ride on an airplane simulator at the mall—juxtaposed with images of overgrown grass, vacated lots and other innocuous signifiers of the passage of time that carry weight only in the rare moments we pause to consider them. The effect is comforting and sobering all at once, like revisiting your elementary school’s playground as an adult. The swings are still there; you can sit on them, even. But whatever you’re hoping to reclaim is long gone.

The Weather Up There,Jeremy Cunningham,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e56af9f65d24e000822a21c/1:1/w_160/The%20Weather_Jeremy%20Cunningham.jpg,2020-03-02 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeremy-cunningham-the-weather-up-there/,Northern Spy,"The Weather Up There, drummer Jeremy Cunningham’s second album as a bandleader, is part of a lineage of jazz that uses diverse musical forms to contemplate death and bereavement. Grief, to cite a famous example, prompted Alice Coltrane to turn to the tamboura and oud after the death of her husband, John. More recently, it led the pianist Kenny Werner to mix orchestra and choir on No Beginning, No End, and trumpeter Dave Douglas to synthesize bluegrass, traditional hymns, and Sibelius on Be Still. After suffering a loss, jazz history suggests, musicians look beyond their immediate surroundings, as though seeking beauty in parts of the world they might have missed before. In 2008, Cunningham was a straight-ahead player in his native Cincinnati, almost finished with college and hoping to enroll at the Manhattan School of Music. His younger brother Andrew was playing video games at home when two men, carrying AK-47s, broke down the door. Having mistaken Andrew for his roommate, Tyler, they beat Andrew with their gun butts and robbed the house. Tyler, who was in the shower, managed to run across the lawn and call for help; the two men shot and killed Andrew. In shock, Cunningham bombed his graduate school audition and moved to Chicago, where straight-ahead became another color in a wide musical palette. Over the course of the next decade, he became close with some of the city’s most forward-thinking virtuosos: guitarist Jeff Parker, cellist Tomeka Reid, and drummer Makaya McCraven, all of whom play on The Weather Up There. The record is cut with the voices of family and friends from back home, who recount his brother’s murder. The emotionally complex interplay between these spoken samples and the shifting ambiance of Cunningham’s jazz fusion makes for a story of mourning that simultaneously illuminates the strangeness of life after tragedy. Opener “Sleep” begins with elegiac OP-1 synthesizer textures as Cunningham’s aunt describes a dream about Andrew. “All of my dreams from people who have died,” she says, the song slipping into Reid’s sentimental strings and Josh Johnson’s saxophone swells, “all take place in my kitchen, for some reason.” The music’s doleful mood breaks abruptly. The exuberant half-note pulses that begin “1985” evoke the pop of “Bennie and the Jets” or “Super Rich Kids,” and then Cunningham and his collaborators loosen their playing styles to match Parker’s guitar heroics: a light skein of feedback and a couple solos. With Parker producing, alongside New Breed bandmate Paul Bryan, the album’s construction is imbued with a sensitive, meticulous studio wizardry. That’s particularly true of “Elegy,” a harrowing voice collage: Recordings Cunningham made of his Cincinnati community—his sister, his ex-girlfriend, his brother’s best friend—speak with each other about Andrew, join together like a choir, and discuss the need for gun control. They’re accompanied by the “drum choir” Cunninghman formed to play on the track, an assemblage of Chicago percussion talent whose potentially climactic inclusion on the album he idiosyncratically buries under his hometown’s memories of tragedy. The spoken sections ground Cunningham’s vision in its subject matter, distinguishing his unique way of processing grief; it’s impossible to mistake the album’s sorrowful origins. The Weather Up There is taut and well-sequenced enough to occasionally risk becoming background music, but its long monologues snap the listener to attention. They grate with their unmusicality, and sometimes delve too deep into exposition about that awful night in 2008. They also allow for a record of dualities that plucks the listener out of the march of ordinary habit and into the pain of another, before revealing the many ways that life can become new again. Daily concerns seem to fall away during Cunningham’s collective emotional journey—even the act of criticism itself.

F♯ A♯ ∞,Godspeed You! Black Emperor,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c3426159e01000820c835/1:1/w_160/F%E2%99%AF%20A%E2%99%AF%20%E2%88%9E_Godspeed%20You!%20Black%20Emperor.jpg,2020-03-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/godspeed-you-black-emperor-f-a-infinity/,ConstellationKranky,"The grizzled voice could be that of God. “The car’s on fire and there’s no driver at the wheel,” he begins over a ground-shaking rumble of drone, before surveying the horrifying landscape: The government is corrupt, buildings are imploding, the skyline is ablaze while a populace hides indoors, numbed by chemicals and drowning out the screams with the radio. The voice continues as mournful strings enter, playing a theme wracked by sadness and loss, the sound of the band on the deck as the ship goes down. Do we hear hope as a fragile guitar enters and repeats those lines? I think so. And once we sense that feeling of being crushed by despair while seeing a flicker of possibility, we’re fully inside of the universe of Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s 1997 debut, F♯ A♯ ∞. The piece, which came to be called “Dead Flag Blues,” is a career-defining debut album-opener to rival Patti Smith’s “Gloria: In Excelsis Deo,” the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey,” and Black Sabbath’s “Black Sabbath.” Everything you need to know about Godspeed was foretold by the words and music of this first track, which occupies the album’s entire first side. They would eventually become one of the key bands in what we’d call post-rock. Through the first decade of the 21st century, more than a few groups would copy their soft/loud crashing orchestral style. All of their music takes place in the world described by that voice, a place where those buried by calamity are on the verge of breaking free. The words on “Dead Flag Blues” were written by Efrim Menuck, who was born in Montreal and grew up in Toronto before returning to the city of his birth in his early 20s. They came from a script for an unfinished film called “Incomplete Movie About Jail” and were read by an unidentified friend. Menuck, like many in his circle, had grown up listening to punk and hardcore, but after moving to Montreal he started making music of his own in a very different style. In 1994, he and his friend Mauro Pezzente, who played bass, recorded a tape they called All Lights Fucked On The Hairy Amp Drooling and made 33 copies, giving them to friends. The project’s name, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, came from the title of a Japanese documentary about a motorcycle gang. (The band would relocate the exclamation point in 2002.) Twenty-five years later, All Lights remains a rumor—there have been no confirmed leaks of the music, not even a photo of the cassette. But after recording it and playing a few live shows, the band, joined by guitarist Mike Moya, began to take shape. Pezzente moved into a warehouse space near the train tracks in Montreal’s Mile End neighborhood, and it became a place to practice, to hang out, and to scheme. When Menuck took over the lease, they called the space Hotel2Tango, translating part of the local postal code—H2T—to its military call sign. Soon they were hosting shows, and Godspeed became a kind of collective, with a swelling lineup that changed from one gig to the next. Cellist Norsola Johnson was another early member, and years later she’d articulate the ethos at work. “I think a lot of that just came from punk rock backgrounds,” she told Lucinda Catchlove in a 2016 interview. “You want to make something happen, you have to do it yourself.” For Montreal art kids in the 1990s, there was no other way. Godspeed’s dark and foreboding sound suggests civilization heading toward collapse, and conjuring such a world wasn’t an act of imagination. They could see it around them. In April 1996, right around the time things were heating up at Hotel2Tango, an article appeared in the International Herald Tribune called “Montreal’s Deep Malaise,” in which reporter Anne Swardsoa described a city on the brink. On the ballot the previous year was a referendum on Quebec’s independence, and it was defeated by less than a single percentage point. Conflict and uncertainty were rife, and many English-speaking Montreal residents fled the city during the campaign. “The city that once was Canada’s financial and cultural center is in serious trouble,” Swardsoa wrote. “Its tax base is eroding, poverty is increasing, roads are deteriorating and, most important, citizens are leaving.” As 1996 turned into 1997, a community was growing in these grim surroundings. Hotel2Tango, where a number of musicians lived and played, was a hub of activity, and a new label, Constellation, was on hand to document it. Constellation cofounder Ian Ilavsky played guitar with Sofa, a local band that made grimy post-punk—a 7"" and album by the group were the first two releases by the imprint. F♯ A♯ ∞, on vinyl only, was the third. Godspeed recorded the album in Hotel2Tango, with a group of musicians that had more or less solidified into a band. No single element in Godspeed was new, but their particular fusion of sounds didn’t sound like much else. For string-led drama over loose, stumbling rhythms, you could look to Australia’s Dirty Three, particularly their 1996 album Horse Stories. The twangy guitars, sometimes played with slide, brought to mind the high-plains drama of Ennio Morricone’s scores and the lonesome tumbleweeds of Ry Cooder’s soundtrack for Paris, Texas, a vein the more ambient-leaning Richmond band Labradford was exploring around the same time. And the gradual builds to crushing climaxes that brought the whole history of rock to bear were something Mogwai were exploring in Scotland, on their 1997 debut Young Team. It wasn’t hard to draw lines connecting these sounds and scenes, but Godspeed were operating in a world of their own. Perhaps owing to Menuck’s interest in film, the album feels like a product of editing as much as playing, stitching together composed ensemble sections, field recordings, samples, and more abstract sound design. Over time, Godspeed would perfect the kind of pieces that go from soft opening to gradual build to thundering crescendo. But F♯ A♯ ∞ is a different beast, one more fragile and less tied to idiom. So after the opening monologue concludes, “Dead Flag Blues” drifts—first come the screeching wheels and chugging motor of a steam train, and then gossamer slide guitar tones so quiet you begin to notice the ambient noise in the room you’re hearing them in. These are the album’s two essential features. The vibrating string sound—whether made by guitar, violin, or cello—evokes cables snaking down brick buildings, power lines framing the horizon as the sun sets, flaccid balloons snagged in barren trees. And the train sounds remind us of what the machines carry away, whether it’s a product of industry or the people who worked to create it. The edits keep coming, as the band stitches together fragments, only some of which sound as if they were initially designed to fit together. After a middle section of “Dead Flag Blues” that’s as close as F♯ A♯ ∞ comes to a spaghetti western soundtrack, the piece shifts back to hammered guitar strings, like the sounds you get when you strike a cable that keeps a telephone pole upright. The first side then shifts to a tuneful vignette led by glockenspiel, a jaunty melody you might find in a music box, the sort that people decades ago put on to forget their problems. And then it concludes with what sounds like an improvised piece for voice and banjo, where the player asks “What’s my motivation?” as if speaking to a director as the camera is about to roll. It turned out that the elaborate structure of the original LP was only one possibility among many. After the Constellation release of  F♯ A♯ ∞, Godspeed contacted the Chicago label Kranky because they were playing shows in the U.S. for the first time. The Chicago imprint—home to Labradford, Stars of the Lid, and several other bands whose music was situated in the same general universe—wanted to put the record out on CD, and for a wider audience than Constellation’s limited distribution allowed. But rather than reissuing the LP as is, the band made a new version of the record to take advantage of the CD’s longer runtime. They re-edited and re-configured the material, shuffling the sections and adding music, a large chunk of which wound up on a new, third track, called “Providence.” The album, released in multiple formats with different tracklists, broken with long overarching suites divided into sub-titled sections, can be difficult to parse on paper. It’s an unusual situation for such a defining record—two competing versions, quite different from one another, on two different formats, put out by two different labels. The additional material is excellent, but for my money, the definitive version of the record is the Constellation vinyl LP. Regardless, “East Hastings,” from the CD version, would contain the most-heard piece of music in Godspeed’s oeuvre, after Danny Boyle used the section titled “The Sad Mafioso” in his 2002 post-apocalyptic zombie film 28 Days Later. The side opens with a man’s voice yelling on the street, and then a bagpipe plays the theme from “Dead Flag Blues,” easing us back into landscape established by the first side. From its desolate opening section, “The Sad Mafioso” builds piece by piece into the sort of wall of sound that Godspeed would later become famous for. In Boyle’s film, the opening section of “The Sad Mafioso” plays as the main character, Jim, leaves the hospital and discovers a deserted London. “For me, the soundtrack to 28 Days Later was Godspeed,” the director told The Guardian. “The whole film was cut to Godspeed in my head.” It’s easy to understand why: Boyle had the means to create a film with a scene—gazing out over desolation, feeling completely alone—that was familiar to those who listened to F♯ A♯ ∞ and dreamt up their own pictures. Besides the quintessential Godspeed builder, the second side of the LP has several abstract sections, some built from manipulated samples. The final movement of the album proper, called “String Loop Manufactured During Downpour...,” begins with a warped recording of a haunting voice sourced from the early-’70s musical Godspell. The voice floats into a whining drone that whines and hisses and quakes, until, on the vinyl version, it slides into a locked groove and plays for as long as you want it to. Godspeed had good timing. As the 20th century was winding down, there was an uneasiness in the air that sometimes became outright paranoia. Any calendar change this significant will bring with it people who think the end of the world is nigh. In this case, there was the Y2k bug, which suggested that the computers that now powered so much of the world’s infrastructure might stop working properly when the clock struck midnight on New Year’s Eve 1999. “Dead Flag Blues” describes being trapped inside the belly of a horrible machine that’s bleeding to death. At the end of the millennium, in more despairing moments, it seemed as though a simple programming glitch might open that vein. Godspeed’s avoidance of the trappings of the music industry only enhanced their prophetic aura in the year after the release of F♯ A♯ ∞. They issued no photos, sold no t-shirts, and gave very few interviews. Given all the mysteries surrounding the record itself, and the openness to interpretation of the mostly instrumental music, that contextual void left a lot of room for the imagination. The band did provide a few clues. Within each LP copy is a print showing a train with a tribute to the Reverend Gary Davis, a show flyer, a small envelope that contains an intricate blueprint called “Faulty Schematics of a Ruined Machine,” and, most famously, a single Canadian penny that has been crushed by a train. The coin is a potent symbol that connects so many of the album’s threads—the proximity of violence to money, the surprising endurance of supposedly obsolete technology, the intensely local nature of the entire enterprise, and, above all, the simple childlike joy of knowing a giant machine turned such a common object into a copper pancake. The vinyl version of F♯ A♯ ∞ has to rank with the greatest packages in the history of the LP, but not because it’s especially elaborate. Its ultimate triumph is that each copy still comes with its own sleeve of goodies, including the penny, while the record itself is still comparatively inexpensive. Where most labels create special editions that become valuable because of scarcity, Constellation, 23 years and almost 50 pressings later (some runs numbered in the thousands), makes this one available to all for a modest price. Which brings us back to community, and that dirty loft by the railroad tracks, and a word that crops up a lot with Godspeed: hope—you don’t start a long-term project with people you care about unless you’re driven by it. As dark as this band’s music gets and as deeply fucked as the world it portrays may be, it always contains a glimmer of catharsis, some moment that suggests there’s a future worth struggling for. “When you live in the city, railway tracks are the most open space you can find,” Menuck told the Montreal publication AMAZEzine in 1998. “There’s usually no high buildings around and it’s the place where you can see the most sky.” That’s what those massive major-key resolutions point to—they suggest that if we’re creative, we might band together with others and find possibility in what surrounds us, even in places the rest of the world has abandoned.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Everything Is Beautiful / Everything Sucks,Princess Nokia,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e568a1219382e0008724875/1:1/w_160/Beautiful_Princess%20Nokia.jpg,2020-02-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/princess-nokia-everything-is-beautiful-everything-sucks/,Platoon,"The comedian Hannah Berner recently posed a question on Twitter: “Does anyone else feel like they are a lazy perfectionist with ADHD and chronic fatigue who is pretty chill besides the occasional panic attack and loves their friends but hates people?” The answer, at least among the many people I know who shared the tweet, seems to be a resounding yes. In a climate of absolutist cultural politics and rigid personal-brand guidelines, it can feel risky to embody harmless contradictions in public. Princess Nokia’s two new albums are presented as a response to this paradigm; on the jointly released Everything Sucks and Everything is Beautiful, the artist stakes her right to duality, no matter how seemingly oppositional. There may be something in the air: Moses Sumney has described his new album as an expression of multiplicity. Noname recently announced a mini-run of shows pointedly called the Hypocrite Tour. If anyone would take the mantle of divergence as ethos, it’s Nokia, who has proudly and loudly collected a number of identities over the years. “I’m a weird kid. I’ve got so many personalities eatin’ me up inside. And I think that’s the basis of the music and my whole identity,” she said in a 2017 interview. The albums funnel some of those identities and their respective musical styles into two distinct modes. Press materials describe Everything Sucks as “a brash, ruthless and insistent collection,” and Everything is Beautiful as “a representation of the sensitive, feminine side of the gender fluid artist.” It’s almost a little too on the nose. Everything Sucks was made primarily in the span of one intense week in New York, with friend and producer Chris Lare (aka owwwls), and that tight turnaround is evident. Its 10 songs are a locust swarm of angst, restless and frantic, as one can become in a city so densely populated. The first four tracks are zealous fight songs with lyrics like, “I’m the monster under your bed/I’m the goblin from the dead” and “Who dat, who dat, who dat?/The bitch is back/Who dat, who dat, who dat?/I will attack.” You can practically see a moshpit forming while a devil circles her left shoulder. There’s a preemptive, almost B.Rabbit-esque listing of her flaws: she’s crazy, she’s gross, she’s generally a mess, and what of it? The closer “Just a Kid” is an exception to the aggression, an awkwardly delivered but vulnerable story of the traumas of her early years, including a stretch in foster care. Nokia finds more success on Everything is Beautiful, which, in comparison, is warm and expansive. Made over a span of two years, including some time in Puerto Rico, it has the optimism and groundedness of being in a place where you can occasionally look up and see a wide sky. The production, with beats primarily by Tony Seltzer and 1-900, are peppy and bright, and the themes spiritual and forward-looking, like an antidote to the hellishness explored on Everything Sucks. The jazzy sounds that have shown up in segments of New York’s reinvigorated independent rap scene offer a welcome complement—via the downtown crew Onyx Collective and Los Angeles saxophonistTerrace Martin—to Nokia’s experiments with effective but technically imperfect vocal styles. One song, the gentle and self-deprecating “Heart,” is ready-made for a sync on a future season of Insecure: “I hate social media, I wish it all would end/I’m not like those other girls, in fact I’m fucking worse,” she raps. This is Nokia at her best, a relatable, unpretentious narrator of her own growth. For someone proud to have resisted the industry machine, both albums show that Nokia is adept at making music that fits neatly within its bounds. There are familiar flows and familiar sounds throughout: she out-Chances Chance the Rapper with a version of his signature sing-songy delivery, snarls in Cardi B’s clipped flow, and resuscitates the plonking piano that gave OG Maco a hit some years back. It’s easy to grow tired of her insistence that she’s a misfit, until you consider that scores of artists have built careers on similar narratives with far less self-awareness. And yet the album’s best moment comes in the form of a poem on an outro track: “I survived from trauma and I’m living out my purpose/And I’m sure you are too, we’re really not that different.”","On a double-set of albums, the New York rapper stakes a claim to life’s dualities, exploring the many layers of her personality with style and vulnerability.

Milkteeth,Douglas Dare,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e556d790e27b00008f7b724/1:1/w_160/Milkteeth_Douglas%20Dare.jpg,2020-02-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/douglas-dare-milkteeth/,Erased Tapes,"English singer-songwriter Douglas Dare recorded his new album Milkteeth in Margate, an eccentric seaside town roughly 200 miles from his native Dorset, where he was raised on a dairy farm. Dare is currently based in London, but Milkteeth bears no trace of city life. Instead, it is filled with pastoral imagery from childhood. With subtle production from Tunng’s Mike Lindsay, Milkteeth stands apart from Dare’s previous, more conventional records. Here, he mines the mysteries of memory, family, and the ghosts of his hometown. Dare doesn’t find a concrete answer to any of them, but he arranges the remnants into gorgeous compositions that borrow from English folksong, baroque pop, and piano balladry. Milkteeth is Dare’s third studio album, following 2014’s Whelm and 2016’s Aforger, both of which were hindered by their safe, electro-classical production and hemmed-in songwriting. Dare’s talents as a vocalist and composer have never been in question, but there seemed to be an invisible wall holding him back. On Milkteeth, Dare has managed to break free. He makes earthly experiences sound otherworldly, owing in part to Lindsay’s light touches and Dare’s autoharp, his new tool of choice. On standout track “The Joy in Sarah’s Eyes,” Dare strums said autoharp while speaking to the phantom of a young girl. “Sarah, you were five years old/When the ceiling fell from its walls” he sings, as if guiding her through the halls of their childhood home. His voice crackles over a lattice of tambourine and spectral percussion as he asks, “Do you remember your height on the wall?/You’d be taller now with further to fall.” It’s not clear if Dare is recounting fact or fable, but his sense of loss is weighty as we imagine a crumbled structure marked by the height of a child who never lived to outgrow it. Dare takes on the role of bard on Milkteeth, celebrating the wonders of childhood on “The Playground.” He likens youth to a luminous fairground, his voice riding a circular piano riff like a kid on a carousel over synthesizer arpeggios and pulses of horn. “Red Arrows” explores similar subject matter in a sparser presentation. Dare sings in the round about running with his mother up Denhay Hill, a grassy mound in Dorset. The song recalls traditional English folk music, updated with tasteful pangs of drone. Milkteeth may be Dare’s most stripped-back album, but it is also his richest, a loose tapestry of memories both painful and cherished. In “Silly Games,” Dare recalls the loneliness of his rural upbringing. “Mother’s in the kitchen washing plates,” he sings. “Brother, cousin won’t play with me/Uncle, auntie they’re not free.” Dare’s solace, however, lies in an unnamed figure that is plenty willing to join him. The album is full of nebulous renderings like this, where we’re left to interpret Dare’s personal mythology. It makes Milkteeth feel suspended in time, more dream than recollection.

Full Hand,Kevin Krauter,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e53fed55d1a220008b90454/1:1/w_160/Full%20Hand_Kevin%20Krauter.jpg,2020-02-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kevin-krauter-full-hand/,Bayonet,"Kevin Krauter makes soft, well-worn shoegaze music, kind of like that old sweater from high school you still keep around. The Indiana musician and Hoops bassist’s second album, Full Hand, is first and foremost a spring record; it makes for nice background noise as the sun stays out longer and the grass gets greener. The 12 songs are breezy and genteel, with very little brewing below the surface. Krauter doesn’t make sweeping statements in the lyrics or arrangements. Instead, what we hear is weightless and bucolic, even blissful. Full Hand cherry-picks and subverts elements of ’70s soft-rock and R&B. Where it would feel obvious to have live drums, Krauter will play with drum machines. When it would make more sense for a song to fade out quietly, Krauter will write an off-kilter synthesizer arrangement. Take “Opportunity,” a honey-coated song about the light coming in from his bedroom window. Resonant keys linger gently, and a drum machine shuffles like a bike on an unpaved road. The song unfolds methodically until the end, where Krauter shakes things up with a left-of-center, vaguely baroque keyboard part. If not for that quiet bait-and-switch at the end, this song would be innocuous: lovely, but not particularly memorable. It’s easy to miss Krauter’s compelling and complicated arrangements; the record is subdued almost to a fault. You have to put in work to feel drawn into Krauter’s world. A song like “Kept”  feels more aligned with Swedish dream-pop bands like the Radio Dept than it does with polished indie rock from the early 2010s that feels like its more obvious analog. What at first seems like chilled-out disaffection is actually closer to pure melancholy. When he writes about his experiences, he almost always does so cryptically, taking great care to keep things out of view as he sees fit. The title track is the album’s most fully realized. It sounds like an  AM-radio gold supercut, guitars building to a pool of noise you want to float atop forever over a tight drum groove. Krauter is at his best when he writes these sunny, nostalgic arrangements. A stellar groove doesn’t make an album, though. Krauter writes pretty, deceptively complex melodies, but offers very little substance. Full Hand is a house with no insulation: nice on the outside, but not really a place to call home.

color theory,Soccer Mommy,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e505f07ba238a0008307f4b/1:1/w_160/color%20theory_Soccer%20Mommy.jpg,2020-02-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soccer-mommy-color-theory/,Loma Vista,"When Sophie Allison sings, she sounds wide-open and guarded, casual and intense, intimate and coolly removed. In her best songs as Soccer Mommy, a piercing line —“I don’t wanna be your fucking dog,” for example, from “Your Dog”—wriggles away from direct interpretation as she delivers it, turning from declaration to hypothesis. Some of the magnetism of her pop-inflected indie rock comes from the winding shape of her melodies; in their unpredictable motion, they often resemble counterpoint written to a root melody that’s been erased. But a lot of her power derives from the immediacy of her voice—when she opens her mouth it’s as if a spotlight appears. The songwriting of her earliest direct-to-Bandcamp material was still hazy at the edges, but by her 2018 studio debut Clean, a world-class indie rock singer-songwriter was standing in her place. It doesn’t always happen this way, but the acclaim followed her swiftly and her fanbase multiplied. She toured with Vampire Weekend and Wilco, with Liz Phair and Paramore and Kacey Musgraves. In another era, Clean might have landed her a lucrative major-label contract. In this era, she enters the low-level managerial world of a successful indie rock band, one in which you become your own manager and booker and agent, even if you also hire and pay those people. “I’m touring for a living and I run a small business, basically,” she told the New York Times last month. “It’s a very isolating existence.” color theory exhibits much of the growth—and some of the growing pains—that usually attend massive transformations. She’s on Loma Vista now, home to fellow indie-label graduates like St. Vincent and Andrew Bird. It might not be Caroline or DreamWorks in the ’90s, but Allison makes the most of her opportunity, and the songs feel like a response to an exponential leap in platform and possibility. As she did on Clean, she worked with producer Gabe Wax, who has also helmed projects by the War on Drugs, Deerhunter, and other indie A-listers. Where Clean was warm and rough-hewn, the product of a careful microphone set-up and mutual trust, color theory feels dazzled with the endless creative possibilities of the studio. The drizzle of acoustic and electric guitars on “lucy” feels fine-tuned to evoke memories of The Bends-era Radiohead. On the seven-minute-plus “yellow is the color of her eyes,” layers of Mellotron, Wurlitzer, and Prophet synthesizer (all played by Allison) lend the song the sleepy-eyed sheen of shoegaze. The drums on “circle the drain” are subtly sweetened by drum machine à la the work of ’00s pop hitmakers The Matrix, and its edges shimmer with drones and synths until it resembles one of the billowing soap bubbles in the video for Sheryl Crow’s “Everyday Is a Winding Road.” In deliberate contrast to the bright sound, the mood is grimmer, the emotional truths darker. Allison has said the album depicts three states of being, represented by three colors: blue for depression, yellow for mental and physical illness, gray for mortality. Clean began with the urgency of youth, in the moment of a break-up; the first lyric of color theory opener “bloodstream” is wearier. Observing the “pale girl staring through the mirror,” she remembers the way blood used to flow “into my rosy cheeks” before she looks down: “Now a river runs red from my knuckles into the sink,” she sings, her voice flat and resigned. She is quick to qualify and complicate the alarming image (“Maybe it’s just a dream”) but the feeling resounds: color theory pitches headlong into the anomie of early-20s depression—the moment in adulthood when the bright colors of adolescence start to dim for the first time and it occurs to you, with dull alarm, that the rest of it might be like this. As a lyricist, Allison keeps her footing in this more internal landscape. She has a skill for following winding syntax to a sharp point: “I am fake it till you make it in a can/And you have a calmness that I could never understand,” she sings on “Royal Screw Up,” a song that also includes the frank admission, “I am the problem for me/Now and always.” You can trace her admiration of Taylor Swift in how she follows a standard-issue pop-song metaphor until it yields a moment of truth: “I try to break your walls but all I ever end up breaking is your bones/And the bruises show/Standing in the living room talking as you’re staring at your phone/It’s a cold I’ve known,” she sings on “Nightswimming.” The paired couplets are neat as a folded napkin, and the alienation—who hasn’t felt dismissed by a brandished smartphone?—is palpable. If there is anything missing from color theory, it’s a sense of intensity and surprise. Many of the songs chug along around the same midtempo, with a similar first-drum-lesson beat. Her choices are intentional; Allison has cited “bops” from her childhood like Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn,” Sheryl Crow’s “If It Makes You Happy” and Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated” as inspiration, and she has borrowed some of these songs’ chunky simplicity for her arrangements. The varied strum patterns that gave Clean’s songs their sinuous, lived-in feel have given way mostly to chugging down-stroked power chords, and the palette is bright, clean, and uncluttered. But she doesn’t tap into these anthems’ urge to shout from the rafters, even if what you’re shouting is that you’re desperate, rock-bottom, about to give up: The songs on color theory sometimes feels like a series of 8-point-font text messages projected onto highway billboards. On the penultimate song “stain,” she casts off most of the instruments and leans into the microphone again, just her fingers gripping a pick and a backing of tense silence. The music instantly becomes corporeal, urgent—she has yet to locate this power within the glossy peaks of new sound she has churned up. “Now I’m always stained, like the sheets in my parents’ house/Yeah I’m always stained/And it’s never coming out,” she sings, and as the song cuts out—neatly, at exactly three minutes, one of the album’s shortest—your nerves jangle with the humming of the strings, your gut churns in simpatico with Allison’s. Correction: An earlier version of this review mistakenly referenced New Pornographers and Barenaked Ladies as being signed to Loma Vista. They have since been removed.

Red Paint Reverend,ShooterGang Kony,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e500ac0b68dd500080f7afe/1:1/w_160/Red%20Paint%20Reverend_ShooterGang%20Kony.jpg,2020-02-28 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shootergang-kony-red-paint-reverend/,self-releasedEMPIRE,"To hear ShooterGang Kony tell it, he never thought about rapping until he was sitting in a jail cell. The 21-year-old native of Sacramento’s Oak Park was first sentenced to probation at 13 and began bouncing in and out of lockup a couple years later; his music, buoyant but threatening, sometimes recalls these jail cells as portals to hell, on other songs as minor inconveniences. On Red Paint Reverend, his excellent new album, Kony is meaner and funnier than ever, but also delves deeper into the psychic pain of those incarcerations, rapping evocatively about the way he would dial number after number on the jail phones that led him to his friends’ voicemails, as he imagined the fun they were having without him. That he does this without surrendering any of the freewheeling chaos of his early work makes Reverend a marked leap forward for one of California’s most exciting young rap artists. The cliché goes that by the turn of the century, major-label rap albums were built by rubric: four songs for “the streets,” three for “the club,” two for “the girls,” and so on. Still today, many artist backload their albums with their more somber, most overtly personal songs, as a way to give the records a veneer of seriousness and a sense of emotional heft. Kony has always been a little more slippery in this regard. His album from last summer, Second Hand Smoke, opens with a strange two-step: first a minor-key elegy called “Off the Dribble,” which is followed by “Charlie,” a song that’s bright and breezy but still—to be absolutely clear—about weapons. The forward motion on Kony’s albums comes from variations in tone and execution rather than in subject matter. This means that the sober songs are injected with unsettling humor and the bouncy ones are girded by murder. Kony doesn’t foreground the technical aspects of rapping, but he’s more than capable: see the way he finds the beat’s pocket on the intro as the drums fall in around the 80-second mark, then compare that to songs like “Veteran’s Day,” where he gestures toward the jagged flows that his contemporaries nearer the Bay and down in Los Angeles have been using, the ones that always teeter on the back edge of the measure, threatening to fall off. While he never gets quite as unmoored from the beat as AzChike or the guys in SOB x RBE, Kony’s slightly muted version of the style puts his work in conversation with other California rappers––and in turn highlights the comparatively classicist streak to his writing. The most affecting song on Reverend is “A Sinner’s Story,” where he recalls those jail phones and talks about the rapid psychological shift that happens between pulling your first trigger and examining your first exit wound. It is also a shock to hear someone whose writing is so often qualified with winks and asides rap as naked a four-bar passage as: Ever had your close friend put your name in the case?
Wanna kill him, but you can’t, ‘cause you loved him under the hate.
Ever had your close friend coil into a snake?
He was shedding in my house, it was right in front of my face. Between “A Sinner’s Story” and “Dearly Departed,” a duet with Oak Park elder statesman Mozzy, Reverend showcases Kony’s ability to write straightforwardly about the grim realities of life in Sacramento. But as mentioned, he’s just as likely to cover the same subject matter with a smile on his face. At various points on the album Kony cracks jokes about industry people telling him to change his stage name (“But I still sleep with the thing”) and about someone who could end up snitching (“Cops had him singing and pointing like it’s the ‘70s”). And then there’s the delayed cause-and-effect of him rapping, on one song, “I prefer the Glock over the chopper, I like to know who I be shooting” and then, on the next track, “I hit his homie on a fluke––he was actually kind of cool,” shrugging off the latter murder like a cackling Oak Park Chekhov. By the time Reverend settles into its slick closer, “Street Talk,” Kony is cemented as a fresh voice for California: of his generation but informed by his elders, untangling the tragedies of his life when he isn’t too busy having fun.","The Oak Park rapper’s new album is one of his meanest and funniest, cementing him as a fresh voice in California rap.

Everyday Nothing,Brooke Bentham,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e55680a0db120000992384f/1:1/w_160/Everyday%20Nothing_Brooke%20Bentham.jpg,2020-02-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brooke-bentham-everyday-nothing/,AllPoints,"What happens when a precocious youth becomes just another adult? As a college student in London, Brooke Bentham’s early singles attracted buzz and earned her a deal with British indie label AllPoints. But when it came time to write a debut album post-graduation, she was burned out: “I was just lying in bed every day and just watching television,” she told NME. “I couldn’t write and I felt like a piece of shit.” She worked two retail jobs to make ends meet, drawing on the non-musical experience for lyrical inspiration. The eventual album, Everyday Nothing, is not exactly about finding beauty in the mundane; while the music is frequently beautiful, it doesn’t glorify stasis. If it celebrates anything, it’s self-sufficiency—fitting for an artist who, after spending her formative years settling on a sound, has found her niche. To achieve this, Bentham trades art-pop producer Ben Baptie for singer-songwriter Bill-Ryder Jones. The production on Bentham’s early EPs often drowned her voice in psychedelic effects or heavy synths that didn’t necessarily complement her music, except to mirror the intoxication of her narrators on songs like “I Need Your Body.” Many lyrics on the new record are about not being intoxicated: “All my friends are drunk/I haven’t been wasted in months,” for example, or, “I don’t smoke, ’cause I dont wanna die anymore.” Ryder-Jones’ production reflects this newfound lucidity. Though there are experimental touches, like the drum machines and e-bow of opener “With Love,” Bentham’s voice is at the center. The tasteful restraint can be weirdly thrilling: “Telling Lies” combines the intimacy of a rehearsal session with what sounds like a My Bloody Valentine song playing in the background  while Bentham was recording. Other reference points include ’90s indie rock staples Yo La Tengo and Sparklehorse; younger listeners might picture Phoebe Bridgers fronting Alvvays. If the music has obvious ancestry, Bentham’s lyrics can be harder to trace. “Blue Light” concerns itself with keeping love alive, though a line like, “You brush your teeth more than me/I feel so ashamed” suggests a deeper, self-conscious kind of fear. On “Men I Don’t Know” and “Keep It Near,” Bentham reveals exhaustion at the idea of being a full-time musician, asking why she’s “burdended herself” doing what she loves when the rewards are few and far between. When she does get sentimental, she’s restrained, as on the unexpected late-album love song “Without,” which recalls the Jo March monologue from Greta Gerwig’s Little Women adaptation: Like Jo, Bentham asserts her love and independence while simultaneously admitting that she’s unhappy. Because the album’s scale and ambitions are modest, some of its songs blend together. It’s easy to mentally segue from the verses of “All My Friends Are Drunk” to the chorus of “Blue Light,” or to conflate mid-tempo advance singles “Perform for You” and “Control.” Still, the individual songs are strong enough that obsessing over their similarity feels like nitpicking. It was never Bentham’s intention to laugh defiantly in the face of malaise, or to talk about her coming-of-age journey as an unqualified triumph. All she meant to do was find reasons to keep writing.","The British singer and songwriter finds her niche, setting her voice at the center of modest, forthright songs that celebrate self-sufficiency and restraint.

Companion Rises,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e5404d55d1a220008b9048c/1:1/w_160/Companion%20Rises_Six%20Organs.jpg,2020-02-28 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/six-organs-of-admittance-companion-rises/,Drag City,"Despite his career tenure in the reductive order of “freak-folk,” Ben Chasny has never been easy to track. For nearly a quarter-century as Six Organs of Admittance, Chasny—perhaps the most consistently exploratory figure in what was once dubbed New Weird America—has moved in fits, starts, and left turns. He has been a high-flying guitarist and a hypnotic singer-songwriter, a curdled noise enthusiast and an aspiring poet. And just when he seemed to settle, Chasny developed his own system of speculative music, Hexadic, in which a deck of cards prompted the notes he played for a pair of challenging 2015 albums. And then, of course, he pivoted to his most serene music ever. Companion Rises offers a few more unforeseen forks in this riverine path. Chasny has earned a reputation as an ardent collaborator, but he wrote, recorded, and played everything here alone. What’s more, he generated many of these rhythms—and there are lots of them, layered like intricate strata of ancient stones—with computer programs he designed. That sounds complicated, but Six Organs have actually never made an album that maintains such momentum or delivers so many compulsive hooks at once. “I don’t know what kind of music it is,” Chasny wrote while mixing Companion Rises last summer. After all this time, it’s music that suggests wholesale new frontiers for what Six Organs might become. A keen melody or stunning detail anchors every song on Companion Rises. The title track—a tender astrological ballad, where synthesizer rays suggest the rising or setting sun—is one of the most beautiful, disarming songs Chasny’s ever recorded. “The 101,” meanwhile, reimagines the Six Organs aesthetic of muttered vocals and byzantine guitars as garage rock, as though Chasny suddenly stepped into the Fun House. Electrifying and jarring, the song and its jagged solo drag Chasny back toward the psych-rock roar of Comets on Fire, a band he left a dozen years ago. It’s thrilling to witness. Whenever Chasny burrows inside some particularly contemplative tune, he eventually claws back toward the light. When his cooing voice finally lifts over the fluorescent electronic washes of “Black Tea,” it’s like watching clouds break. “Haunted and Known” drifts through three minutes of acoustic guitar and fragile falsetto before squelching electronics start to roar, ultimately overpowering everything. What’s most remarkable about Companion Rises, though, is a trio of songs—“Two Forms Moving,” “The Scout Is Here,” and “Mark Yourself”—that suggest a new future for Six Organs. Chasny has often favored meticulous arrangements, where each sound gets its own distinct space; these songs could get tedious, mazelike. But on these songs, Chasny wedges the flotsam of brittle guitars and the jetsam of distorted electronics closely together, shaping a warped sort of composite folk-pop. It recalls the most essential work of Califone, a band at their best when building something new by mining the junkyard of American folk. Chasny has rarely sounded so tuneful or focused. In recent years, following Chasny has meant diving with him into esoterica, where the animating ideas for a piece of music, from the Tarot to the desert, could feel more important than the songs themselves. The results were fascinating, if vexing. Based on theories about aliens, astronomy, and the occult, the writing on Companion Rises is still thematically obscure. But, at least temporarily, Chasny has resurfaced in search of a more immediate connection, letting heavy notions push his songs upward rather than drag them apart.

Got It Made,Kamaiyah,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4ffe326851210009c687df/1:1/w_160/Got%20It%20Made_Kamaiyah.jpg,2020-02-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kamaiyah-got-it-made/,GRND.WRKEMPIRE,"Kamaiyah has had a tumultuous time since her Good Night in the Ghetto. In 2016, the Oakland rapper’s vibrant debut mixtape seemed to announce a star in the making. She signed to Interscope later that year, but her album was repeatedly delayed, and eventually shelved entirely. By the following year, she’d self-released the mixtape Before I Wake in mutiny against the label, a move she now calls a mistake. She was arrested after a TSA altercation, and for firing a gun in a private movie screening room. On her new mixtape Got It Made, released independently on her own Grnd.Wrk label after her departure from Interscope, Kamaiyah sounds newly refreshed and self-reliant. Half act of self-care, half immeasurable flex, it places her in the lineage of Oakland mack rappers like Too Short and Dru Down. The tape is a multifaceted consideration of self-sufficiency—escaping the thumb of domineering labels, ignoring bad boyfriends, and confronting haters. As she puts it on “Pressure,” “I love myself, yeah, I trust myself/Don’t need nobody else/I don’t need nobody’s help.” She does get some help from a crack team of local producers familiar with her uncomplicated, optimistic, and referential style. Produced primarily by Oakland’s CT Beats, the mastermind behind her biggest hit, 2016’s “Why You Always Hatin’?” with YG and Drake, and featuring additional production by Swish, DJ Banks, DJ Official, Trackademics, and more, Got It Made builds upon her established sound, which brings local music of the past into the present day. She slides through minimalist, oscillating reanimations of classic Bay Area rap forms, ghost riding the whip through the town she still has every intention of taking over. Kamaiyah is far less melodic than on past releases here—the only way she seems to be holding back on Got It Made. For about half the tape, she is bars first, and for the rest, she isn’t singing so much as chanting, one note at a time. On A Good Night in the Ghetto, her buoyant singsong made casual moments of hood escapism sound like bliss, elevating Dionysian songs about staying out all night, cruising around, and emptying bottles. This time around, she takes a bare-knuckle approach, allowing you to feel the impact of every punch. “No you ain’t active/You just pop off the lips and that’ll get yo ass smacked quick/I’m relaxin’, big maxin’/And I talk my shit ’cause I can back it/That’s facts, bitch,” she snaps on “Intro,” absolutely swaggering. “Still I Am” is a post-separation reestablishment of personal identity. “I done took plenty losses/That’s why I feel like I deserve to keep flossin’/This shit is exhausting/When you boss up and run your own office,” she raps. In her estimation, being independent isn’t just valuable for the freedom it provides, but also the ability to take responsibility for oneself. That’s the subtext of “Whatever Whenever,” a slow-rolling slapper about having a plan, executing it, and defending your position. She raps like a woman ready to bury anyone trying to take the plot of land she’s worked for. “Mood Swings” is trapped in an argument spiral with a toxic partner; “Set It Up,” a vengeful team-up with Trina, is about getting the compensation owed from a boyfriend’s cheating by robbing him. At nearly every turn on the mixtape, she reevaluates what it means to be reliant on others, and she sounds liberated doing it. Got It Made is at its best when it shows its reverence for Oakland. Kamaiyah gets J. Espinosa, the official DJ of the Oakland Raiders, to scratch all over the bass-propelled “Get Ratchet,” an incredible twerk song. She matches the tune and tone of rising local yowler Capolow on the strutting, pick-up-line-filled “Digits.” On the mixtape’s centerpiece “1-800-IM-Horny,” she gets twerk expert and forefather Too Short to talk his shit over an interpolation of his own classic 2003 track “Shake That Monkey.” It feels like a passing of the baton: Oakland’s longest-reigning mack inducting the next great one.","Free of her stifling major-label contract, the Bay Area rapper sounds rejuvenated, delivering fiery screeds on self-reliance of all sorts.

Street rap narratives often involve a come-up, but this NYC laureate of dread raps like a young man living moment-to-moment, day-to-day, check-to-check. With no expectation that music will deliver riches, the only sense of purpose he derives is from the people who surround him. This darkness is palpable in Medhane’s uncompromising aesthetics. It’s fair to say the Brooklynite arrived in the shadow of Earl Sweatshirt, but the comparisons no longer serve him. At eight tracks and just 15 minutes, Full Circle feels lower-stakes than last year’s debut album Own Pace, but it finds Medhane further disappearing into his singular style: gritty samples, low-key rhymes, and no real hooks. Medhane’s bars have always been economical, and here they feel shorter and more clipped than ever before. You can picture him paging through his rhymes with a red pen, crossing out unnecessary words. Or perhaps his scattered wordplay just reflects a stream-of-consciousness thought process. Take the 82-second “Big38” (one of six songs that come in under two minutes): With no wasted motions, Medhane declares his love for his kin, muses on astrology, and asserts he has “sent the hurt away” with the forlornness of someone just pretending to be ok. While his flow in the past felt spectral, Medhane has modified his voice into something more forceful. Rather than letting his rhymes gently float through the mix, he now regularly thumps out his syllables, sounding more confident on the mic than earlier recordings. There are other surprises on Full Circle. The screwed sample and militant tone of “I Was Just In the Mara” resembles Kanye West’s Wyoming sessions work, and rising rapper maassai almost steals the spotlight as she viscerally describes “running from hearses” as “cardio.” “4Evafaded” closes the album with an old soul loop that would instantly turn the head of Griselda Gang, prompting Medhane to sign off with some positivity: “Why relish the hurt?” he asks, taking a nostalgic beat to remember his grandmother palming him some cash and advising that he save rather than spend it. Mostly, though, Medhane traverses a chilly version of New York. On “No More Tequila,” he recalls a three-day bender; the pensive “Redline” details a winter’s day in the life as he moves through the city with friends, jumping subway turnstiles, buying weed, and facing wind and rain in just a grey hoodie. Medhane exists in this realm not on his own, but alongside compatriots MIKE, Adé Hakim (formerly known as Sixpress), Caleb Giles, and Slauson Malone. Together, they are creating a new ripple of the New York rap canon, offering a murky and ghostlike vision of one of rap’s most well-painted cities.

The lyric has since been removed for clarity.","The mesmerizing Brooklyn rapper’s latest release finds him disappearing further into his singular style: gritty samples, low-key rhymes, no real hooks.

Cape God,Allie X,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e500f480e27b00008f7b487/1:1/w_160/Cape%20God_Allie%20X.jpg,2020-02-27 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/allie-x-cape-god/,Twin Music,"The glassine synthpop Allie Hughes crafts as Allie X often serves as a Trojan horse for the eccentric personas she invents. A classically trained singer, Hughes prefers characters and costumes, often donning bug-eyed sunglasses while performing songs that relish or wallow in being the outsider. On 2018’s Super Sunset, she vivisected life in image-obsessed L.A. through different female archetypes, resulting in a deft if interchangeable set that favored effervescent, ’80s-inspired pop. On its spirited follow-up, Cape God, Hughes heads to the East Coast for a more striking emotional reckoning, abandoning past alter egos and inserting herself in the troubles of a gloomy, fictionalized shoreline town. Cape God was inspired by Heroin: Cape Cod USA, a harrowing 2015 HBO documentary about the effects of the opioid crisis on young people living in the seemingly idyllic Massachusetts vacation destination. The horrors of addiction surface in oblique ways here, but Hughes largely uses the documentary’s subjects as ciphers to reflect on memories of the inner turmoil she experienced growing up between Ontario and northwest Michigan. Cape God’s grim fables play out like a TV drama about debauched teens set to springy Max Martin-style production, setting stories of suburban excess to gothy synthpop and dramatic ballads. The album’s fatalistic streak is familiar but compelling: Hughes dreams up a place where decadence is fueled by deep-rooted melancholia. She gets blackout drunk over handclaps and heavy synths on “Life of the Party,” where the propulsive backdrop feels at odds with the disturbing details: “Even when I nodded out,” she deadpans, “I was center of the action.” That kind of unflinching look at the abuse and depression borne of suburban ennui is a potent creative source for Hughes and makes for some of her most exciting work. “June Gloom” depicts the cold isolation of depression through fizzy electropop, and the swooning “Susie Save Your Love” zooms in on a main character who’s “too drunk to drive” and pining after a guy who doesn’t reciprocate. “Susie” is an especially bright highlight that features Mitski on vocals, though the two harmonize so closely that her appearance becomes almost anonymous. When Hughes tries out more rote pop songs, Cape God can get a little dry. “Love Me Wrong” employs an acoustic guitar, a choir, and a sleepy-sounding Troye Sivan to sing about double-edged romance, but the belabored song comes off like an underwritten B-side. The self-effacing “Devil I Know” and “Regulars” are the most anodyne of the bunch, with similar plucked guitar lines and repetitive choruses—and worse, they’re sequenced back to back. Still, the sad world of Cape God is an alluring one, and Hughes’ vocal range is its unequivocal linchpin. She shoots off staccato spoken word on the ironic “Super Duper Party People,” hopscotches over drums with a featherlight touch on the catchy “Sarah Come Home,” and drops to a smoky lower register on the cinematic “Madame X.” The latter song is where she makes the clearest gesture at the grim, all-consuming power of addiction: “Take my money, my self respect,” she sings over a swell of strings. “You fill me up with your emptiness and it’s the first thing I’ve ever felt.” It’s a despairing note, but it’s also one of Hughes’ starkest—a vivid rendering that establishes Cape God as the strongest concept in her catalog to date.","Inspired by a documentary about the opioid crisis, the pop singer and songwriter dreams up a fictionalized shoreline town where decadence is fueled by deep-rooted melancholia.

The Allegory,Royce 5'9'',by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e53fcbf65d24e0008229f15/1:1/w_160/The%20Allegory_Royce%20da%205'9.jpg,2020-02-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/royce-59-the-allegory/,"eOneHeaven Studios, Inc.","From Eminem sidekick to Dr. Dre ghostwriter, from major-label hit-chaser to backpack powerhouse, from deliriously drunk shit-talker to soberingly woke preacher, Royce 5’9” has played them all. In his 20 years of funneling characters into hip-hop, there’s never been a stretch of track where the Detroit rapper couldn’t outrap anyone around him. All of which puts Royce beyond a certain type of criticism. He has made great music many times before, but sometimes the issue is everything but the rapping. His last solo album, 2018’s The Book of Ryan, was more inwardly focused, a self-aware autobiography that also functioned as a late-career reckoning. His latest, The Allegory, doesn’t coast on that same goodwill. Instead, Royce looks outward as a heavy-handed attempt at converting his listeners to woke enlightenment. There are plenty of redeeming moments here, but it’s hard to shake some of the straight-faced proselytizing. The anti-vaccination lines on The Allegory—and there are several—might have been chalked up as trivial goofy-horrorcore lyrics on an old Royce mixtape, but that’s a luxury he abandons here early on, staring into the camera at the beginning of the album to declare: “This is the allegory of the cave theory by Plato, this is the first chapter.” On one hand, you can’t take that seriously; on the other, he’s taking himself seriously—too seriously. Still, Royce wants it both ways. “Present picture: a guy battles sexuality in tight apparel, eyeshadow/That’s not deep, I’m shallow,” he raps on that same introduction. In other words: here’s something vaguely offensive, but I don’t really mean it. Right? Wink. Yikes. Not everything is this clunky. If anything, the album is so dense that it’s best moments can feel buried. The many guest spots help lighten things up, even when they’re grimy. On “FUBU,” Conway the Machine shit-talk sounds breezy over a sinisterly kooky boom-bap beat alongside Royce’s complexity. On “Overcomer” Westside Gunn raps chilling street raps like “Where I’m from driveby’s overrated/If you got five bodies then you famous” that require no decoding. Vince Staples and G Perico inject their own nasally, jumpy energy on “Young World.” Royce also produced every bit of music on The Allegory, a first for his career. His beats are generally chunky sample flips and simple loops, but he also has an ear for a good sound. But if you’re listening to a Royce album it’s because you want to hear the guy rap. To his credit, Royce has the rare effect of a rapper’s extreme technical ability making him seem limber instead of rigid. There a handful of moments on The Allegory of sheer delight where Royce barrels both forcefully and elegantly into a complex rhyme scheme and makes it seem easy. You’ll have to brush aside some of the missteps (a well-intentioned Eminem skit is a clumsy grappling with white privilege and hip-hop as a Black art), but you’ll hear vulnerable catharsis about his father on songs like “Hero” alongside the more steely lyrical attacks. The best moment on the album might be the most light-hearted, when Royce pokes fun at a career misstep on a song called “Rhinestone Doo Rag.” (He tells his younger listeners they’ll have to Google it.) It’s an exercise in humility from a guy often pointing a finger and seriously overexplaining. It’s funny and lands better when he’s the butt of the joke. Plus, he’s rapping his ass off.","The latest from the Detroit rapper is impressively self-produced and features as many showy passages as clunky stumbling blocks.

@@@@@,Arca,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4f1040b68dd500080f7abe/1:1/w_160/@@@@@_Arca.jpg,2020-02-26 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arca-aaaaa/,XL,"Since releasing her initial solo EPs in 2012 and working in the producers’ room for Kanye West’s 2013 album Yeezus, the Venezuelan-born artist Arca has made a name for herself using  dextrous and playful mutations of electronic music’s familiar forms. Vocals appear on nearly all of her full-length works, but until her self-titled 2017 album, they were shrouded in icy digital effects. Arca allowed her to stake new ground as a singer, an artist who used the (mostly) unmodified sound of her voice to great effect alongside carefully orchestrated synthesizer production. Arca’s latest, a 62-minute single titled “@@@@@,” calls back to her early music both in its name and its slippery, wandering structure. But it integrates what she learned from molding raw vocals to her unmistakable sonics, resulting in some of her most delicate and astonishing work. Framed as a radio broadcast by a character named Diva Experimental, “@@@@@” corrupts the listening environments into which it was released. Though it moves much like a mixtape, flitting from sequence to recognizable sequence (Arca calls them “quantums” and has named and demarcated them with timestamps), the song appears on streaming services as a solid hour of sound. If an algorithm eats it up and sorts it into a playlist, it will profoundly disturb the usual automated flow. If a listener hopes to hear a specific moment in the outsized track, they’ll have to pan through its length by hand, dropping their cursor in a precise spot on the progress bar like aiming the needle of a record player at a specific groove. By its nature, “@@@@@” reintroduces some measure of physicality to the listening process, disrupting the inscribed habit of letting Spotify’s impartial code do all the work. Throughout the piece, moments of turbulence—stuttering drum beats, chopped and looped vocals, detuned synth leads, all familiar gestures in Arca’s music—give way to serene oases. The conceit behind the music proposes a world surveilled by omnipotent AI, a dystopian future that feels a heartbeat away from our own technocratic present. Fear courses through the music, punctuated by palpable relief. An ominous background drone gets crowded out by a sample of near-maniacal laughter; the panopticon looms, and the Diva frolics away from its gaze. Arca invites moments of play and serenity even within the piece’s most oppressive tones. Her voice, muted and processed but recognizable in its grain, coos from beneath the roar of an electric guitar or a cascade of irregular beats. During the quantum “Psychosexual” (around the 23-minute mark), a digitally deepened and abraded voice invites the listener to “shake that pussy, bitch...I don’t care what genital you were born with/You can shake that pussy.” Pussy is rendered as a construct, a state of mind rather than of biology. As in her previous work, the most compelling moments on “@@@@@” are also its most mournful. “No me lo digas, no lo digas,” Arca repeats near the track’s halfway point—don’t tell me that, don’t say that. Her voice is pitched up to an icy soprano, but unmistakable in rhythm and phrasing. Beneath her words, a chorus of background voices hums and a sparse beat lurches forward. “No lo digas/No lo digas/A menos que lo sientas/Porque no quiero que haya resentimiento.” Don’t say it unless you feel it, because I don’t want resentment. Her voice warps in the tangles of the machine she’s using to manipulate it. The quantum builds to an emotional peak, never losing its charred undertones but finding in them an opportunity for romantic vulnerability, a place to beg a partner not to dissemble, to lay bare their needs. In the stunning climactic quanta, “Form,” Arca’s voice slithers beneath a membrane of effects—garbled, bedazzled, and Auto-Tuned. Her words come through only in glimpses, language forming and then dissipating. No percussion accompanies her, only languid washes of synthesizer. Her voice, in all its processing, shines through with immense tenderness. Her music has never sounded so warm or so intimate; never before has she beckoned quite like this. Under seemingly omniscient surveillance, the question arises of how to communicate with others while remaining unintelligible to the hostile infrastructure that hosts our words. How do we find each other across gulfs that want us separate, alienated, desperate? Music, especially future-tuned music like Arca’s, slips beneath language. Its structures can be algorithmically analyzed, its emotional overtones guessed at by machines, but what it does to people, how it moves them and binds them to each other, can be unpredictable, harder for a computer to grasp. How do you survive in an environment spilling over with the stress of being watched? You look for what surprises you, for confusion, for those moments and objects which feel as if they hold the power to repel the gaze of the watcher.","The Venezuelan artist's latest piece, released as one 62-minute track, contains some of her most delicate and astonishing work.

Look At Us Now Dad,Banoffee,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e50060794f6ea0009d3f367/1:1/w_160/Look%20At%20Us%20Now%20Dad_Banoffee.jpg,2020-02-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/banoffee-look-at-us-now-dad/,CascineDot Dash,"Before she played synths for Charli XCX on Taylor Swift’s 2018 Reputation tour, Martha Brown was failing to get by in Los Angeles as a musician transplanted from Melbourne. Her career-aiding spot in Charli’s band saved her from moving home, and she used what she earned from the tour to finance her debut LP, Look At Us Now Dad. Although the title might evoke the image of a daughter beaming with pride at having made it, Brown, who performs as Banoffee, actually uses parts of her debut to examine deeper concepts, like intergenerational trauma and the painful path to self-understanding. Enlisting features from electro-pop singer Empress Of and rapper CupcakKe, Brown aims for a melodic bubblegum pop sound with industrial undertones—a well-established trend in queer music. On “Chevron,” a downtempo lament sung at rock bottom, she asks the album’s persistent questions: “What am I doing? Why am I here?” The song arrives at the album’s midpoint, rejecting an easy redemptive arc in favor of a steady landscape of ups and downs. To her credit, Banoffee never settles on answers to those questions but never gives up the pursuit of them, either. The interludes “I Lied” and “I Let You Down” offer a graceful view into the album’s focus on reconciliation—with relationships, with the self, and with the past. Bookending the album, they contain the same lyrics: Banoffee sings about lying to a dying loved one, telling them that she’s doing well in an effort to spare them worry. While “I Lied” introduces deception into Banoffee’s role as a narrator, “I Let You Down” reframes her lies as promises to herself. Over synths that buzz like insects circling a light, she allows herself the possibility that one day those lies might become truth. On the album’s second half, Banoffee probes the connection between her own psychological battles and her father’s, whose tumultuous childhood included a forced separation from his alcoholic parents. “Permission” is an intensely Auto-Tuned account of assault, and Banoffee’s quivering voice rises to a broken yell as she flips perspectives from perpetrator to victim. “I was young and never wanted/To touch a man or be a woman.” Despite the cyborgian vocals, the song has a shuddering, human ache, taking a cue from similarly produced tracks on Charli XCX’s Pop 2 mixtape like “Backseat” and “Lucky.” On the closing title track, she attempts to wind her own emotional experiences together with her father’s. The song, the longest on the album, addresses her father directly as well as the suffering he inherited: “What was theirs is yours, and now it’s mine.” The placement implies closure, as if the song proves that there’s some new way forward for the two of them. Instead, it introduces the album’s most interesting material right at the end. If she had threaded it more steadily throughout, the album would have been a more keen statement than the respectable pop offering that it is.

Slap Happy,Delroy Edwards,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e50121d0db12000099234bd/1:1/w_160/Slap%20Happy_Delroy%20Edwards.jpg,2020-02-26 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/delroy-edwards-slap-happy/,L.I.E.S.,"Brandon Perlman is one of dance music’s most enigmatic characters. With an attitude that’s equal parts punk rock and gangster rap, the L.A. lo-fi producer better known as Delroy Edwards has often proven to be a cagey (and occasionally combative) figure, happy to take public potshots at his doubters. His aesthetics are heavily informed by classic Chicago house and vintage rap tropes; his alias’ namesake may or may not be a notorious Brooklyn gangster. That he is the son of veteran Hollywood actor Ron Perlman—a fact he didn’t publicly acknowledge until 2016—has only deepened the sense of mystery. His music hasn’t typically been much more forthcoming: Running from chopped-and-screwed rap to murky house and techno, it wears its tape hiss like a defensive shield. Slap Happy doesn’t shed any new light on the Delroy Edwards persona. At its core, it’s a showcase of Perlman doing what he does best: making raw, stripped-down house tracks that strongly recall late-’80s/early-’90s Chicago house. For fans of his early output, such as his 2012 debut EP, 4 Club Use Only—a record that still stands as one of the defining releases of the L.I.E.S. label’s decade-long run—this will be fantastic news. Slap Happy incorporates a bit more R&B swing than we’ve come to expect from Perlman, but its eight tracks are linear, functional dancefloor cuts that lean heavily on vintage drum machines and classic house formulas. It’s easily  one of the most functional and DJ-focused records he’s ever done. But Slap Happy is also one of Perlman’s least innovative releases in quite some time. That’s not necessarily a bad thing—DJs need their tools—but it does represent a change for Perlman, who’s done all sorts of stylistic zig-zagging in recent years. Back in 2016, he released his long-awaited debut album, Hangin’ at the Beach, an ambitious 30-track odyssey through lo-fi rhythms and West Coast psychedelia. Since then, he’s dropped two more solo full-lengths (Rio Grande and Aftershock) and a couple of EPs, plus a desert-inspired experimental synth album with Dean Blunt, a collaborative EP of breezily funky house with fellow Angeleno Benedek (under the name Trackstars) and another collaborative record, Earth to Mickey, where he crafted synth pop alongside vocalist Mickey van Seenus. Slap Happy doesn’t offer any intriguing collaborations, and half of its songs are essentially just drum tracks, yet the album has its charms. “Nitemare House” lives up to its title, its spooky synth line rising and falling over a sturdy (if unpolished) house rhythm as an ominous vocal sample (“You die”) repeatedly pops in and out of the mix. Much bubblier is “Rock This Beat,” a jaunty piano-house cut with a strutting bassline and enough canned horn and string sounds to give the whole thing a little symphonic flair. Album closer “I Am the One” might be one of Perlman’s goofiest tracks yet, although its rubbery, almost cartoonish bassline is held in check by the song’s insistently stamping beat. If Slap Happy has one defining trait, it’s that the rhythms feel noticeably loose. While Perlman has never been the sort of producer who rigidly adheres to the grid, a lot of his past work has been strident, even aggressive. Here, however, the music feels more relaxed; even when the drums are hitting, there’s a laid-back sense of cool at work, most notably on the LP’s title track. On “Slap Happy,” Perlman does his best Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis impression, nodding to Janet Jackson’s 1986 hit “When I Think of You.” It’s still a house cut, but those silky synths and sweeping horn stabs just might constitute Perlman’s most pop moment yet. Like many Delroy Edwards releases, Slap Happy is light on narrative, which likely limits its potential appeal, at least for those who don’t have a keen interest in gritty drum workouts. Depending on your perspective, it might be a slapped-together collection of underdeveloped sketches or an unedited creative burst from an artist ruled by instinct. What’s clear is that Perlman is in the midst of arguably the most prolific streak of his entire career, and seems content to simply follow his muse. For the rest of us, there’s pleasure to be found in sitting back and watching him work.","The Los Angeles producer sticks to his habitual turf, crafting lo-fi drum workouts rooted in vintage house.

Myopia,Agnes Obel,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e500cf70e27b00008f7b483/1:1/w_160/Myopia_Agnes%20Obel.jpg,2020-02-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/agnes-obel-myopia/,Blue NoteDeutsche Grammophon,"Since 2010, Danish songwriter Agnes Obel has produced ghostly, moody chamber pop with configurations of piano, strings, and her own voice. Myopia, her fourth album, represents a new peak for her lush melancholy. Raised in Copenhagen by musical parents (her father was an instrument collector and former jazz guitarist, her mother a talented pianist), Obel studied music in high school, eventually dropping out to attend a program for budding producers. As with her three previous albums, she wrote, recorded, mixed, and produced Myopia at her home studio in Berlin. Myopia means “nearsightedness,” a title Obel chose to reflect her insular approach to music. Where some children might keep a private diary, Obel played solo piano: “I always had a different style of music I liked to play just by myself,” she’s said. Myopia lives in this solitude, inviting you into a creeping mist where vocals and piano smear together. Myopia uses vocal manipulation and murky instrumentation for ambient effect, painting the gloom in hues of rich blue and grey. The effect is present from earliest moments on the album, as on “Broken Sleep,” where Obel’s voice dips in and around plucked strings as she instructs, “Dream me a dream soft as a pillow.” She passes the phrase “dream me a dream” back and forth with herself, alternating between a long e, like dreem, and a short e, like drem. Elsewhere she experiments with textured vocal layering and muddled, rippling warbles. On “Promise Keeper,” pronunciation takes a backseat in favor of delicate vocalizations. At times her voice leaps over itself, like cresting dolphins. When Obel sings the album’s title on “Myopia,” the word simply melts into the rain of compressed drums and strings, barely detectable. Myopia recalls the gauziness of Grouper, or the poetry of Kate Bush, but the way the album forms its own strange landscape suggests that Obel is more interested in her own musical planet than any shared reality. She’s motivated, perhaps, by what she’s described as a discomfort with social media and the pressure of a culture where “we expect everyone to be open and made of glass.” Myopia, with its atmospheric piano, shadowy vocal effects, and persistent tension, resists this kind of visibility. These songs are obscured like frosted glass, as meticulously pretty and faintly unnerving as a porcelain doll. Though the album ends almost as quietly as it began, Obel’s whispery ambient fog lingers far longer.

Map of the Soul: 7,BTS,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e53ea3a5d1a220008b9044f/1:1/w_160/Map%20of%20the%20Soul_BTS.jpg,2020-02-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bts-map-of-the-soul-7/,Big Hit Entertainment,"The BTS brand has never been stronger. The seven Bangtan Boys have already parlayed their massive fanbase into a merch and media empire that includes a Mattel toy collection, a mobile game, and a soundtrack doubling as a collaborative EP. Their new album, Map of the Soul: 7, is already a huge global hit. It sold two million copies in its first two hours in South Korea and is projected to do bigger first-week numbers stateside than Justin Bieber did. The shareholders are satiated. The Army is spoken for. The K-pop superstars have emerged as the product arm of a worldwide commercial apparatus that’d make the Svengalis behind turn-of-the-millenium teen-pop salivate. Except the members of BTS maintain that there’s still a beating heart at the core of the machine. Authenticity is part of their appeal, and they use vaguely philosophical, Jungian blueprints to make music about being true to one’s self. 7, which follows (and includes much of) the 2019 mini-album Persona, is part memoir, part fan service, part amateur psych eval. Though the music is flattened enough to appeal to just about everyone, it can still tap into something enchanting, but the glimpses of personality are fleeting. The “seven” in the title is an obvious reference to the number of members in the group and the number of years they’ve been performing together. Fittingly, the album is dedicated to their group arc and highlighting their individual journeys within. 7 is highly self-referential, with new songs sampling old songs and alluding to others dating back to their 2013 debut. It is tasked with doing a lot—not only chronicling the group’s path to this point but also unpacking the rest of their ambitious yet hard to parse concept: an exploration of the relationship between the persona and the shadow. There is some obvious overlap between the two: the negativity we unconsciously bear and its correspondence with the masks we all wear mirrors the dichotomy of managing a public face amid the looming private pressures of being a famous K-pop star. Because the album repurposes Persona as a five-song preface, 7 really begins with the interlude “Shadow,” performed by Suga. “One message that penetrates the album as a whole is that you must face your inner shadow, but resist becoming submerged into its depths,” he explained during the album’s seemingly endless press junket. “Shadow” is supposed to set the tone for a more intense exploration of self from the Boys, together and individually, but it turns out to be the most thoughtful moment on an album that is unnecessarily drawn-out, jumbled, and uneven. Persona lacked the natural fluidity and chicness of their best music. Those problems aren’t exactly mitigated here, since most of those songs appear on this album too, but within this new context, they feel like a flashback before the saga continues. Many of the new songs are better about balancing Easter eggs for day-ones with new entry points for more casual listeners. J-Hope’s solo cut “Outro : Ego” flips the boom-bap sample from their first intro “2 Cool 4 Skool” into a vibrant dembow groove, and this sonic convergence of the band’s past and present traces its musical history, as he traces his personal one in the lyrics. Conversely, “Louder Than Bombs,” co-written by Troye Sivan, is moody synth-pop that represents the group they’re transforming into—one less reliant on rapping. Unlike most of their K-pop peers, the BTS prototype was constructed specifically around rap. “I had considered putting together a hip-hop crew, not an idol group,” Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk, also known as group producer Hitman Bang, told Time last year. “But when I considered the business context, I thought a K-pop idol model made more sense.” BTS rappers RM, Suga, and J-Hope were the holdover trainees from that original vision; Bang Si-hyuk refers to them as the group’s “musical pillars.” Tiger JK, of the trailblazing Korean rap group Drunken Tiger, has claimed that BTS cornerstone RM broke the stigma of idol-group MCs as mere roleplaying puppets. Rap-laden art-pop is still what they do best, but they’ve diverted their focus of late. In its attempt to placate every type of BTS fan, 7 sacrifices what’s most effective about the unit. There are a few reminders. On the lyrical speed run “UGH!” the group’s trio of MCs place themselves among the best Korean rappers, lashing out at haters in the process, with J-Hope putting on a cartoonish display to rival a kook like Danny Brown. With trap drums and heavily Auto-Tuned vox, “Black Swan” sounds like the kind of SoundCloud rap novelty that, in an alternate reality, would land the posh crew on a No Jumper pod. And when solo, Suga and J-Hope each sound comfortable in their elements. As on 2016’s Wings, the members of BTS separate for solo turns on 7, and those can be more illuminating than their characterless crossovers with Halsey and Sia. Jimin glides throughout the sanitized, Latin-leaning “Filter,” bringing some color to its convoluted concept and tapping into music’s hottest market. Jungkook’s “My Time” uses a strobing R&B template usually reserved for professing love to capture the overwhelming pace of his career like a nostalgic time-lapse video. But for every moment on 7 that feels revelatory, there’s another that is regressive. On the spectrum of transitional, autobiographical pop, it’s closer to Bieber’s flavorless Changes than Ariana Grande’s vibrant thank u, next. No genre courts extramusical interest quite like K-pop. There’s a blood pact between stans and idols that complete devotion to the product may sometimes have a dehumanizing effect. As the biggest act working in the industry, it’s interesting that the members of BTS seem to have at least a surface-level desire to maintain the humanity within their cash machine. But their conception of the shadow is personified so literally (as a swallowing black mass of negativity) and so vaguely (rarely speaking to the being of any individual specifically) that it lacks pointedness. If the most personal is indeed the most creative, then 7 could have benefitted from a bit more personality. V has been open about how “scary” it is to be stalked by fans and Suga has rapped about depression before, but that kind of candor and complication doesn’t factor much into this, their album about the dark side of the psyche and the BTS journey. They could’ve gone deeper and used this psychoanalytic framework to say more about the joys and terrors of all-consuming celebrity—about what it does to the soul. Much has been made of BTS’ autonomy as creators, but their album feels like a brand activation, the latest petition for everyone to like and subscribe.

Kulør 006,Various Artists,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4f0a4a159f9400097eb933/1:1/w_160/Kul%C3%B8r%20006_Various%20Artists.jpg,2020-02-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-kulor-006/,Kulør,"Humor and heartbreak are two sides of the same coin; both invoke the absurdity of being alive. At least, that’s what Kulør 006 has me feeling. The second compilation on Danish DJ and creative director Courtesy’s label Kulør, it showcases the work of local producers and musicians from her hometown, Copenhagen. The first, Kulør 001, was a snapshot of the city’s “fast techno” scene, which has more in common with trance motifs and rave aesthetics than it does Berlin’s minimal take on the Detroit sound. Courtesy used to co-run another label, Ectotherm, that centered on this particular facet of Copenhagen dance music, but it wound down in 2018. She started Kulør the same year with the intention of exploring a wider sonic palette, which is where Kulør 006 steps in. Kulør, she explained in an interview, is “like a living organism that can grow and morph into things that I can’t even imagine now.” If that description could peel itself off this page and make a home inside your ears, it might sound a lot like Minais B’s delightfully eccentric “To Levende Væsener” (or in translation, “Two Living Beings”). Seesawing synthesized strings make way for a chorus of digital mouth sounds that land somewhere between the croak of a frog and the yap of a small dog. While sonically distinct, they tickle the senses in a not dissimilar way to a particularly squelchy acid line. Purists like to paint electronic music as a wholly serious endeavor, but wise practitioners know that a spot of ludicrousness can light up a dance floor like nothing else. The sense of humor that Varnrable wields on “Cold Bright Hard Light” is dry to the point of brittle, but just as effective. Filtering post-punk energy through sharp synths, the artist narrates a desire to escape to the countryside, anticipating a cold welcome, before deadpanning the quintessential millennial stance: “Thank god for good Wi-Fi connection, right?” Laughter’s the best medicine, they say, but tears also clear a path for healing. Interestingly, the only two artists on Kulør 006 who also appeared on the hedonistic first compilation—Schacke and IBON—are also the ones who dig deepest into the comedown zone. Schacke spells it out with “The End of Ecstasy,” a subdued looping melody that feels in conversation with “Smokebelch II (Beatless Mix)” by Sabres of Paradise, an association I’m perhaps more sensitive to given Andrew Weatherall’s recent passing. Where “Smokebelch II” is tinged with joy, “The End of Ecstasy” has a curled-up and contemplative energy, characterized instead by burnt textures and feelings alike. IBON’s contribution, a watercolor synth track called “Sorgpad,” also exists in the lonely hours that stretch out between the last record of the night and the relief of a new day.

There’s plenty more for curious ears to explore, and it is nothing if not surprising. On the vinyl version, the A-side has a scrapbook pop moment with Sofie Birch’s “Look,” which recalls the sweetly scruffy production of London in the early 2010s (think early Sampha, Micachu, and Kwes), and a slice of polyrhythmic heaven in Astrid Sonne’s “Swirl,” which performs an endless build without losing traction. Over on side B, “Never Rest” by Lyra Valenza traverses ambient, industrial, and trance territories, while “Dares Soar” by X & Yde combines spoken word, slabs of bass, and squiggly sax.

Wild Wild East,Sunny Jain,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e53eb8965d24e0008229ee0/1:1/w_160/Wild%20Wild%20East_Sunny%20Jain.jpg,2020-02-25 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sunny-jain-wild-wild-east/,Smithsonian Folkways,"On January 23, fire engulfed the archives of the Museum of Chinese in America. Over a century of accumulated history—some 85,000 artifacts—could have been swept away like dust: film reels, old records, typewriters, wedding dresses, copies of the first English-language Chinese American newspaper. About a third of its archive was eventually recovered, but the disaster underscored the collection’s irreplaceability. MOCA’s founders, Jack Tchen and Charlie Lai, had initially salvaged items from dumpsters; apparently, the owners didn’t view their junk as worthy of preservation. As the cultural critic Hua Hsu observed last year, “Immigrants have not tended to regard their own lives as rising to the status of history.” Something of the museum’s humble approach to memorializing—accumulating the residue of ordinary life, building it into something consequential—is expressed in Sunny Jain’s Wild Wild East, the first release in the Smithsonian Folkways’ Asian Pacific America series. Like several recent albums by artists of color that reimagine the American cowboy, it discards the romantic myth of a white gunslinger galloping across Western plains. Instead, it claims that the true spirit of the cowboy—his courage, resilience, and relentless pursuit of freedom—is embodied by immigrants. Jain’s ancestors migrated from Rajasthan to Western Punjab, and then during the 1947 partition of India, fled to Eastern Punjab in one of the largest mass migrations in history. In the 1970s his parents emigrated to Rochester, New York, where he absorbed his siblings’ fervor for “Rush, Ice-T, and guitar ‘gods’”; he listened to his mother’s Jain bhajans (devotional songs); he discovered jazz legends like Max Roach and John Coltrane. Since then, Jain has become part of a rich heritage of South Asian American artists—and Asian American artists more broadly—who put Western jazz and other black music in dialogue with Eastern classical traditions. Wild Wild East, which combines influences from Bollywood music to surf rock, testifies to how second-generation immigrants form their own distinctly American identity. Plunging into the cowboy theme, the album immediately conjures the arid frontiers of Ennio Morricone, the composer behind some of the world’s most iconic spaghetti western scores. Wild Wild East’s opening track, “Immigrant Warrior,” is cinematic almost unto parody, triumphant horns galloping with heroic resolve. But after a minute, the narrative begins to fray. Electric guitar whines and sputters, unchaining itself from the melody, until the composition snaps back to the victorious march. Other disturbances come later in a sensuous saxophone passage that flows into low, accelerating drum beats. Jain seems to suggest that there are spaces of possibility within these ruptures, signs of trouble within the smooth continuum of history. Many of these compositions are intellectually thrilling to unravel, even while stifled by the album’s lofty concept. Wild Wild East is indebted to R.D. Burman’s vibrant, Morricone-influenced soundtrack for the 1975 “curry western” Sholay, but Sholay is imbued with a sprightly mischief and whimsy that Wild Wild East doesn’t quite reach. It’s really that the omnipresence of Morricone’s ghost can grow tiresome. “Wild Wild East” and “Aye Mere Dil Kahin Aur Chal” are invigorated by Ganavya’s wistful singing and Jain’s electrifying dhol rhythms respectively, but they would have benefited further from the sort of jubilance Jain unleashes with his dhol-and-brass band Red Baraat. The album’s most frustrating song is “Red, Brown, Black.” Its opening cymbal crash is akin to the protagonist of a teen drama plugging his guitar into an amp to signal that he’s about to rock the high school auditorium. “Embarrassed of my culture from the get-go/Hip-hop raised me with best flows,” L.A. based rapper HASEEB boasts. Though well-intentioned, his subsequent acknowledgment that “black culture taught me how to say it with my chest though” is a superficial bid for cross-racial connection. As the album’s only English language-based song, it becomes an overly simplified attempt to summarize the release’s 42-pages of meticulously written liner notes on personal and global history. Then again, this record’s geographic and historical scope is so ambitious that its flaws reveal the difficulty of balancing cultural rigor with accessibility. It’s worth remembering that the cowboy—tall, imposing—is revered not for who he is, but what he represents. Lionizing the immigrant in his place may be, on one hand, a long-overdue recognition of those who have been overlooked by history. But, more cynically, it can be a shiny valorization of one overbearing ideal for another. The most sincere moments on Wild Wild East are the ones least weighed down with meaning: After Pawan Benjamin’s solemn reflection on the bansuri flute in “Blackwell,” Alam Khan loosens the mood on the sarod. In “Wild Wild East,” shimmering walls of sound feel like floating face-down in a pool and watching light patterns dance on the floor. These small moments of peace feel more radical than any grand statement.","The composer and jazz multi-instrumentalist explores the myth of the American cowboy through an immigrant's lens on his genre-blending latest.

A New Dawn,AceMoMA,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4f0dd794f6ea0009d3f2c3/1:1/w_160/A%20New%20Dawn_AceMoMA.jpg,2020-02-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/acemoma-a-new-dawn/,HAUS of ALTR,"The ’90s was a particularly fecund time on New York City dancefloors. The heyday of Todd Terry, Masters at Work, and imprints like Strictly Rhythm was a fount of ecstatic, pounding, and brazenly sample-heavy tracks. New NYC producers AceMo and MoMA Ready (Adrian Mojica and Wyatt Stevens, respectively) are actively inspired by that era of dance music, even thought they’re cognizant of working at a distance from it. “There’s been nobody to pass the torch to us since the mid-’90s,” Stevens recently told the zine Love Injection. “There’s a ginormous age gap between the last generation of Black and Latin music producers and the current generation.” But they have been so prolific, it’s as though they are intent upon filling the gap all by themselves. Since the beginning of 2019, the two have put out some 15 releases between them (not counting loosies like this bananas beatdown of an R&B classic). After a house- and jungle-heavy EP last year, A New Dawn is AceMoMA’s first proper collaborative full-length. As on so much of their recent output, they work assuredly fast —even ludicrously so—as they fidget between house, acid, rave, breakcore, techno, and ’90s hip-hop. Beats gleefully push into the red and samples ride roughshod over programmed drums . But their confidence never wavers, and as raw as the 12-track set can get, every imperfect element sounds perfect. The bell-laced “The Elder Trance” contains both woozy ambient, destabilized by echo and delay, and whiplash-fast jungle, toggling between neutral and overdrive at a second’s notice. “Rubber Band Man” is dramatic and dark, full of skin-prickling minor-key tones and claustrophobic atmosphere, with each menacing, blown-out kick and too-close woodblock clop making it feel like the walls are closing in on an unlit corridor. “Amen 2 Swing” sounds like a shout-out to the revered duo Mood II Swing: The first half is furious, coarsely chopping hi-hats and breakbeats; then they introduce a cartoonish rave keyboard line and knock the two elements together, making for a drunken anthem. “Disrupt the System” tops 144 BPM and still the two producers decide that’s not hectic enough, pouring all manner of alarm tones, claps, and laser effects into the slivers of space between the beats. Only the eponymous (and hilariously cheesy) vocal sample of “Start the Riot” and the repetitive, cut-to-ribbons chorus of “Breathe In” fail to make much of an impact. The title track has all the makings of a 3 a.m. anthem (preferably at their unofficial home, Bossa Nova Civic Club). Gloriously fast and careening nearly out of control, it feels at once familiar and totally fresh. When the walloping kick bursts back in after an anxious, tingling build, it makes for a genuinely hands-up moment. AceMoMA connect back to their NYC forefathers (with nods to techno dons Derrick May and Jeff Mills), while also keeping a healthy disregard for the past, pushing ahead with palpable enthusiasm and energy. As Stevens explained in that same interview, “[As] brown people making dance music… we needed to create context for what we were doing. So we did.” Like the best moments of a night out, A New Dawn feels like instant history and an instant party.","Rising New York fixtures AceMo and MoMA Ready team up on a collaborative album that pays homage to the fast-and-loose aesthetics of ’90s underground dance music.

The Price of Tea in China,Boldy James,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c319b7fe1550008882db5/1:1/w_160/Tea%20in%20China_Boldy%20James.jpg,2020-02-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boldy-james-the-price-of-tea-in-china/,ALC,"The chronically overlooked Detroit rapper Boldy James has been making excellent street rap for a decade. His 2011 mixtape, Trappers Alley: Pros and Cons, sprawls across 28 tracks and improbably holds attention with quick cuts in mood and tempo. Boldy fits into a broad idea of his city’s grimy rap lineage, but owes little to the stylistic trends that have emerged from there in the 2010s—you will find in him little of Doughboyz Cashout’s manic dread or Danny Brown’s eccentricity. While the 2015 Trapper’s Alley sequel and his 2017 mixtape House of Blues dabbled in faster, more maximalist production, he works best when he works methodically, finding crevices in a skeletal frame. Boldy writes without show, in short vignettes or standalone thoughts. Ninety seconds into The Price of Tea in China, his excellent new album with the producer Alchemist, he recalls his grandmother “cussin’ me out/‘Quit running in and out the house/What’s all the fuss about? It’s either cut me in or cut it out.’” His verses build tension slowly and resist the urge toward melodrama or moralizing; his voice is deep enough to project menace or instill calm without ever seeming to strain or slide out of pocket. Having worked twice before with Alchemist, this is familiar ground—or as familiar as Alchemist’s beats can ever be, as they molt from lush to serrated. Boldy responds by delivering what is one of the best, most immersive rap albums of the year so far. As underground rap producers go, the Beverly Hills-bred Alchemist is this century’s great album-length auteur. He reinvigorated the late Mobb Deep legend Prodigy’s career with 2007’s minor masterpiece Return of the Mac. He was responsible for Curren$y’s 2011 Covert Coup, one of the prolific New Orleans rapper’s most celebrated releases. Boldy and Alchemist teamed up in 2013 for the well-received My 1st Chemistry Set, and again last year for the brief Boldface EP. Even as the economic (dis)incentives for sampling keep mutating, Alchemist crate-digs aggressively, turning out fascinatingly textured, sample-based records at a daunting rate. On China his beats vary from the vaguely wistful (“Pinto”) to the skull-rattling (“Giant Slide”); some songs sound like slow creeps through mud (“Mustard”) and others recall the rhythmic creaking of a hotel bed frame (“Run-Ins”). Crucially, they make space for Boldy, who raps here with a disarming poise whether he’s quipping that a rival crew’s members “look like a boy band” or dispensing quasi-military wisdom like “The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.” His voice at times recalls the Gary native Freddie Gibbs, who appears here on “S.N.O.R.T.” But where Gibbs likes to lapse into quick, technical passages of double-time (he does so here), Boldy centers himself at a midtempo, giving his verses a complexity that emerges only on repeat listens. For a lesser writer or vocalist, that might be a recipe for dry songs, but China is mesmerizing in its minimalism. His near-metronomic control also means that, when Boldy for once turns to a more ostentatious style—the extraordinary Vince Staples duet “Surf & Turf,” where he raps entirely in a cascading, tightly wound meter—it doubles as a reminder of the careful construction elsewhere. Boldy’s verses are webs of evocative detail: jail tats that linger from teenage years, insomniac drives down to Kentucky, gloved hands clutching guns, dealers huddled outside in Nike tech fabrics, a son who thinks his road-tripping dad doesn’t love him, Pyrexes full of dope that looks like oatmeal, stolen pills to salve a grandmother’s throat cancer, cars set to cruise control to eliminate variables, half-kilos of coke stuffed under mattresses like grain in a silo. These fragmented scenes are littered with enough Detroit street names that you become sure you could find the Citgo or Kroger in question. In fact, the bulk of China is so richly specific that Boldy earns the latitude to yada-yada an entire murder, to chilling effect. On “Giant Slide,” he wraps up a man’s story like this: “Now he out in Memphis, Tenn., future looking bleak/It took a week, but when they caught up to him, he got put to sleep.” The Price of Tea in China is not a creative breakthrough marked by a new production palette or a leap in writing style. It’s the result of two superb technicians slowly whittling away the excess material from what was already a singular sound. It opens with an isolated piano and no drums and ends with what sounds like a villain’s theme from a B-movie mafia thriller; its great trick is to be so expertly crafted that you scarcely notice the jaw-clenching stakes until it’s already too late.","On their latest collaboration, the Detroit rapper and the Beverly Hills producer turn out one of the year’s most immersive rap albums.

The Rising / Devils & Dust / Live in New York City / Live in Dublin / 18 Tracks,Bruce SpringsteenThe E Street Band,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4ee7a0f98c800008cf67ab/1:1/w_160/The%20Rising_Springsteen.jpg,2020-02-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bruce-springsteen-the-e-street-band-the-rising-devils-and-dust-live-in-new-york-city-live-in-dublin-18-tracks/,Columbia,"At the end of the ’90s, as he entered his fourth decade as a recording artist, Bruce Springsteen was thinking about resurrections. The first order of business was returning to New Jersey with his wife and bandmate Patti Scialfa, and their three children, after a few years in Los Angeles. He also reunited the E Street Band, the loyal crew he’d disassembled following his commercial peak in the ’80s, which had left him feeling, as he put it, “Bruced out.” His best work as a solo artist in the ’90s (“The Ghost of Tom Joad,” “Streets of Philadelphia”) found inspiration in understated outsider stories that he delivered like eulogies, miles away from the arena catharsis that audiences had come to expect from him. With his most famous band reunited, Springsteen began writing for the masses again. The first new song he premiered during 1999’s reunion tour was “Land of Hope and Dreams.” To a steady, relaxed drumbeat, his bandmates reintroduced themselves—a glorious saxophone solo from Clarence Clemons, a sweeping mandolin refrain by Steve Van Zandt—while Springsteen conducted a spiritual roll call to kickstart this new era. “You’ll need a good companion,” he sang, “For this part of the ride.” Less optimistic but equally pivotal was “American Skin (41 Shots),” a ballad written for Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old who was brutally killed by New York City police officers. In its lyrics, Springsteen juggled feelings of hopelessness, fear, and complicity; in live performances, he requested silence so that you could hear every word. Although he later attempted both in the studio, the definitive versions of these songs appear on 2001’s Live in New York City, recorded during the final nights of the E Street Band’s reunion tour. (Compiled from various shows, it is a triumphant but inessential collection: for the full experience, hit the bootlegs.) That album is among five new installments in Springsteen’s ongoing vinyl reissue series. This time around, he’s highlighting a series of recent albums that have become nearly impossible to find on vinyl, with one of them (2007’s Live in Dublin) making its first appearance on the format. Compared to the first run of reissues, which highlighted his iconic run from his 1973 debut Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. through 1984’s Born in the U.S.A., and a second that collected his mid-career wilderness period, these reissues serve a more functional role. For record collectors and completists, it might be your first opportunity to own any of them. For the uninitiated, there’s plenty of gold to discover. Without a new album to promote, Springsteen prefaced the 1999 reunion tour by releasing Tracks, a fascinating box set that unloaded a quarter-century of studio outtakes and offered an alternate route through his history as a songwriter. A few months after its release came 18 Tracks, the abridged collection included in this set that acts as a sort of anti-greatest hits. In the streaming era, I’d recommend spending time with the complete edition, where you can hear the full range of his experiments and skip around based on what period of his career interests you most. Epics like “Thundercrack” and “Frankie” are among its classics, and both are excluded from this set, I imagine, for purposes of brevity. Still, 18 Tracks provides a solid-enough representation of his strengths, and this edition marks a good opportunity to revisit his lost gems (at least until Tracks gets a vinyl reissue). Similar to Tracks, the music on Springsteen’s 2005 solo album Devils & Dust was salvaged from abandoned studio recordings. After 1995’s stripped-down The Ghost of Tom Joad and its resulting tour—his first time performing live without a band—Springsteen felt inspired to continue in this acoustic, folk setting. The hushed songs of Devils & Dust tell stories of men and women that range from biblical (“Jesus Was an Only Son”) to pornographic (“Reno,” which almost single-handedly earned this album his first Parental Advisory sticker) and personal (“Long Time Comin’,” one of the best songs of this era). Springsteen initially shelved the project in favor of the E Street reunion tour, but he returned to it a few years later after writing a mournful protest song about the Iraq War. Bringing to mind the darker songs he had left behind, it became this album’s title track and introduces one of the most challenging and detailed albums in Springsteen’s catalog, one more akin to moodier sets like Nebraska and Tunnel of Love than his more electric work through the rest of the 2000s. He followed Devils & Dust with another left-turn, recording centuries-old folk songs with a group of musicians he dubbed the Sessions Band. We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, from 2006, was a pleasant surprise, and its resulting tour was even better. Their opening night in New Orleans is often remembered as their peak, delivered as a tribute to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but revisiting Live in Dublin has proven it to be an equally thrilling document. For starters, it is one of Springsteen’s most pristine-sounding live albums, capturing his energy as a frontman but also showcasing the dynamic among his band—their banjos and fiddles, horns and strings, all arranged in joyful chaos. The material itself is equally wide-ranging. An almost unrecognizable rendition of “Atlantic City” opens the set, and the traditional folk music (“How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live,” “O Mary Don’t You Weep”) rings just as true as his own deep cuts. Time has been good to this era of Springsteen’s career, and Live in Dublin captures its peak. Part of the reason why We Shall Overcome felt like such a breakthrough upon release in 2006 was its loose, live-sounding production. A common complaint about Springsteen’s records in the 21st century has been their sound, and while they all fare better on vinyl, the issue was beginning to show its head here. In his 2016 memoir, Springsteen discusses his attempts to self-produce the E Street Band’s comeback album after their reunion tour. (“WE WERE DULL,” he laments of the sessions, in all-caps.) And so he hired Brendan O’Brien, a producer who worked with grunge bands like Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots. His signature trick for Springsteen involved compressing the music and backing him with low drones: cellos, hurdy-gurdy, layers of tinny, distorted electric guitar. The goal might have been to summon the epic swell of his live shows, but it often muddied the sound of his band. Still, when the material sang, the production was easy to forgive. Such was the case on 2002’s The Rising, a pivotal record often generalized as Springsteen’s response to 9/11. Stories have since circulated about him making phone calls to survivors shortly after the attacks to help find a sense of community, to understand the quieter stories behind the big, looming one. Many of these songs serve similar purposes for him as a writer, as he fills the album’s 70-plus minute runtime with choruses that sound like prayers and love songs that double as long goodbyes. It spanned material that directly referenced the tragedy (“The Rising,” “Empty Sky”) and others that dated back to the ’90s (“Nothing Man,” “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day”). Near The Rising’s completion, O’Brien suggested Springsteen cut down the tracklist to help clarify the message. No, he responded, the sprawl is the point. An early song he wrote for the album is its closing track, “My City of Ruins.” While this era of Springsteen’s career collects several of his most heartbreaking songs—Devils & Dust’s “Matamoras Bank,” The Rising’s “Paradise”—this one feels especially personal. He began writing it at the end of 2000 about the economic decline in his hometown of Asbury Park. The setting that provided the magic and electricity in so much of his early work now appeared in bleak fragments, with Springsteen’s own history folded into its faded scenery. To a soulful melody, he acts as a tour guide before bringing it back home: “There’s tears on the pillow, darling, where we slept/You took my heart when you left.” Just before the final chorus, he asks, “Tell me how do I begin again?” In the same place where he started, finding his footing in the community that both inspired and boxed him in, he was posing a new challenge to himself, coming to terms with those things that die and don’t come back. But for now, he felt inspired and alive. So he got back to work. Buy:

Salvador,Sega Bodega,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c2d2f7fe1550008882db1/1:1/w_160/Salvador_Sega%20Bodega.jpg,2020-02-24 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sega-bodega-salvador/,NUXXE,"Until now, Sega Bodega, aka Salvador Navarette, has tended to work on the sidelines. He co-runs the label NUXXE with Coucou Chloe, Shygirl, and Oklou; he’s been busy producing for singers like London’s Cosima; and he contributed sound design to Brooke Candy’s ambitious PornHub film I Love You. On 2018’s self*care, Sega Bodega’s last sizeable solo release, he was bright, brash, lashing outwards; on Salvador, his debut album, he has grown up and also grown more unsure of himself. Shedding the hard shell of youthful self-confidence, he has become lost and self-doubting—an all-too-recognisable condition of one’s mid-twenties. Having titled Salvador after himself, he embarks upon a far more personal project than his previous ones. It’s a raw album, emotionally and psychologically, and it masks sincerity with production that is hard and experimental. Utilizing a production style similar to his work on Shygirl’s recent single “BB”—overdriven rhythms inspired by rap, R&B, and UK bass; vocals processed to disorienting extremes—Navarette deliberately cloaks his self-contradiction and ugly thoughts with deceptively danceable electronic beats. The album is a trippy descent into Sega Bodega’s dark side. In his lyrics, Navarette delves into the destructive patterns we allow ourselves to fall into in the name of self-preservation. This comes to the fore on lead single “U Suck.” Upon first listen, it’s the album’s most unsparing song (“I don’t mean to be rude but honestly/Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.../I can list the ways you suck/You suck, you suck, you suck”). But his singing is soft rather than accusatory, the chords gentle; the major-key outro is so subtle that it’s easy to miss the final twist: “Sometimes you don’t see it but I love you.” Pitched up, his vocals are childlike and coy, shying away from a truth that is hard to acknowledge. The album, as a whole, is better than its singles. “U Got the Fever” is a swirling dreamscape that switches to double time, mimicking the compelling anxiety of a codependent love affair. “Heaven Knows” flicks easily between major and minor chords, mirroring the lyrics’ conflation of pleasure and pain (“Keep your hands around my neck/Cut me with glass”). “Masochism” contrasts harsh beats with soft, closely recorded vocals. Layered on top of each other, the vocals create the sense of an inner dialogue that, combined with the pulsing, fast-strummed guitar towards the end of the track, show an unhealthy cycle beginning again. Navarette’s keen ear for pop and rock blends well with his electronic experiments. The short “Know (Interlude)” is the only place he allows himself to let loose with more abrasive beats; the album’s last two songs “Calvin” and “11 Kuvasz in Snow,” are led by piano melodies—an unexpected choice, given the way the rest of the album foregrounds such an aggressively digital palette. The piano suggests a newfound vulnerability, as if he’s finally dropping his guard and letting in both his listeners and the “you” addressed in most of his lyrics. If self*care showed someone in youthful fluctuation, searching for his identity, Salvador is a self-portrait of an artist in turmoil. What makes the record click is that it feels relatable, yet entirely on Sega Bodega’s terms: ambitious, lonely, and aching for intimacy.","On his solo album, the London producer cloaks his self-doubt in deceptively danceable electronic beats that fuse elements of rap, pop, and UK bass in unexpected ways.

Before the Age of Mirrors,Raspberry Bulbs,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4ede99159f9400097eb8f4/1:1/w_160/Raspberry%20Bulbs_Mirrors.jpg,2020-02-24 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/raspberry-bulbs-before-the-age-of-mirrors/,Relapse,"Even after a long career making creeping heavy music in projects like Bone Awl and He Who Crushes Teeth, the music that Marco del Rio has made over the past decade as Raspberry Bulbs is uniquely unsettling. First on his own and then with a shifting cast of collaborators, he’s mined the most curdled corners of punk and metal to make both tortured no-fi efforts and more recent full-band recordings that feel cosmically off-balance. His songs are full of riffs that become more nauseating the longer you listen to them. At their best, the songs are autostereograms in reverse: They start out looking like something you’ve encountered before, then dissolve into unparsable, overwhelming noise. Before the Age of Mirrors is the first Raspberry Bulbs full-length since 2014, but it picks up these threads right where the last, Privacy, left off. Across eight proper tracks and four shorter interludes, del Rio and his band—guitarist Nick Forte and drummer Jim Ning Nong—lead listeners to a world of sharp edges, sudden pitfalls, and hidden dangers. As devotees of raw punk and deathrock, they sometimes channel those familiar shuddering sounds, but there’s something even more sinister in pieces like “They’re After Me,” a burst of paranoid desperation scoured by feedback. As ever, del Rio tops the track with his distinctive vocals—which, scraped by distortion and noise, are the sort of sounds you might hear echoing from behind a dumpster in a David Lynch film. It all sounds wrong, in the most menacing possible way. Because of del Rio’s caustic bark and the general haze of Raspberry Bulbs’ self-engineered recordings, their lyrics have traditionally been tough to decipher. The specifics still sometimes get garbled in the fuzz, but on Before the Age of Mirrors, you can make out a little more about the otherworldly spaces these songs explore. Del Rio’s characters are overwhelmed and at the brink, doing whatever they can to outrun the mysterious forces clawing at their heels. “Doggerel” blurs together military commands and the violence of the natural world, meditating on the grim image of a dog torn to shreds by a wild boar. Elsewhere del Rio’s characters contemplate eternity, confront old gods, and strain in pursuit of truth that’s always just out of reach. He occasionally comes off as a harried street preacher, offering small wisdoms and impressionistic proverbs, like the one that closes “Reclaimed Church”: “The man who appears as a dog/Has the blood of a dog.” If you don’t know exactly what he’s going on about, that’s probably the point. Del Rio has often spoken about his music’s adherence to the ideals of the speculative, surreal genre of prose called “weird fiction.” That term is a broad umbrella, linking literature across eras and continents, but its most famous practitioners create worlds both monstrous and mysterious, full of shadowy corners and distressing symbology. Writing in The Atlantic about an anthology of the genre that he co-edited a few years ago, the author Jeff VanderMeer theorized that its appeal stems from the way the real world often feels just as upsetting and unknowable as the ones in the stories. Weird fiction, he wrote, has a way of “showing us as we truly are. Unruly. Unruled. Superstitious. Absurd.” Before the Age of Mirrors does the same. Unhinged as it is, it’s a cathartic expression of the way the world is: messy, ugly, and real.

Bloody Kisses,Type O Negative,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4ec5b3b68dd500080f7a4a/1:1/w_160/Bloody%20Kisses_Type%20O%20Negative.jpg,2020-02-23 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/type-o-negative-bloody-kisses/,Roadrunner,"One day in the early 1990s, Peter Steele crammed his monstrous frame into a New York City Parks Department truck and set out for the Hamilton Avenue Marine Transfer Station. Located on the banks of the Gowanus Canal, it was a holding ground for thousands of tons of trash before the trash was ferried to Staten Island’s Fresh Kills landfill. He was hauling 40 cubic yards of human waste, and there was a backup at the station, a line of garbage trucks stopped along the road. He liked the job—it paid $40,000 a year—and it gave the Type O Negative bassist and lead singer time to write. Steele looked like a more Nordic Undertaker, or Glenn Danzig but a foot taller. He was an archetype for the brooding, hypermasculine metalhead that crawled out of the primordial ooze. And for three hours, while sitting in traffic waiting to unload a truckful of excrement, he composed a song in his head. It was, he later told an interviewer for the deluxe reissue of his band Type O Negative’s landmark third album, Bloody Kisses, about “the ultimate goth girl” who was “in love with herself.” The vampire of South Brooklyn, who shoveled shit between band practices, cut both a relatable and controversial figure. “Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All)” is a send-up of the goth-girl archetype (”She’s got a date at midnight with Nosferatu/Oh, baby, Lily Munster ain’t got nothing on you”), the title referring to the only thing a Little Miss Scare-All could ever truly fear: the roots of her hair showing. But Steele made an industry of synthesizing the ironic with the sublimely earnest. In that same interview, he reveals that the song has some verisimilitude: “It’s about the girl I fucking slashed my wrists over,” a reference to his 1989 suicide attempt. Goth metal, then still in its infancy, was made popular in the early ’90s by “The Peaceville Three,” which included My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, and Anathema, all from Northern England. The genre was a self-serious mashup of death metal and doom that left little room for outsized personalities like Steele. But Steele didn’t care about the death metal part; he just wanted the doom. Coming out of the 1980s as an all-star in the New York City thrash metal world—a scene that bred bands like Anthrax, Overkill, and Nuclear Assault—he entered the next decade with that same brash attitude, but with an urge to slow things down. In creating Bloody Kisses, Steele re-invented goth metal by grasping on to influences like Black Sabbath and the Beatles, and creating a lane for mainstream goth-influenced bands from Finland’s HIM to Evanescence. Never again would Steele make an album that straddled these two worlds, with one foot in a mud-flecked work boot, the other in pristine black leather. Steele hinted at Type O Negative’s style back in 1987, the same year he started in the Parks Department and released his thrash band Carnivore’s second and final album, Retaliation. Glancing merely at the tracklist, Retaliation anticipates most Type O Negative albums: a joke opener (“Jack Daniel’s and Pizza”), classic rock cover halfway through (Jimi Hendrix’s “Manic Depression”), and a smattering of offensive song titles (honestly, take your pick). The album is good, if musically unremarkable, crossover thrash. What Steele became infamous for in the mid-’80s, though, was his racist and misogynistic lyrics—written off by fans and hagiographers as “sarcastic”—and by extension, his perceived worldview. He penned the words for fellow New York hardcore band Agnostic Front on their 1986 song “Public Assistance,” a racist screed against so-called welfare queens. He’d repeat this theme on Type O Negative’s debut, Slow, Deep and Hard, in the lyrics to the song “Der Untermensch,” and in interviews throughout his career. Originally called Repulsion, Type O Negative emerged in 1990 after the grindcore pioneers with the same name enlisted a lawyer. Steele, along with childhood friends guitarist Kenny Hickey, keyboardist Josh Silver, and drummer Sal Abruscato, settled on naming their gothic doom project Type O Negative—after a short stint as Sub-Zero, also taken—because “it didn’t sound too metal.” According to Silver, the band preferred ambiguity, so that “you couldn’t tell what kind of band, what type of music it would be.” Steele had a reputation from his time in Carnivore, and the band didn’t want to be pigeonholed as just another thrash act, a genre that broke into the mainstream that year with landmark albums from Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, and Suicidal Tendencies. The first two Type O Negative albums, though, were indications that Steele wasn’t quite ready to leave the past behind. They were still being booked at Carnivore’s old stomping grounds, in the East Village at The Ritz and in Brooklyn at L’Amour. And his crude sense of humor carried over from the ’80s. The cover of 1991’s Slow, Deep and Hard featured a blurred image of a penis (maybe Steele’s) and the follow-up, a “live” album—versions of songs from their first LP with fictionalized stage banter and a fabricated booing crowd overdubbed—released the following year, The Origin of the Feces, is famous mostly for the cover depiction of his anus (definitely Steele’s). Carnivore’s speedy thrash riffs and howling vocals have survived, but midway through, songs slow to a crawl, infused with foreboding synthesizers and mournful church organs. Both records are mixed bags, as if the band is a chimera struggling to become something not entirely unsettling. Type O Negative found their true form when they retreated to Silver’s home studio in Brooklyn to record demos of what would become Bloody Kisses. Roadrunner, Carnivore’s label, stuck with Steele after he formed Type O Negative, and when VP of A&R Monte Conner heard what the band had come up with, he was blown away, recalling that it sounded like “nothing before and nothing after.” The tape contained the majority of what would eventually become Bloody Kisses, including a complete version of “Christian Woman,” which crystalized their new musical identity. Instead of a tossed-off hardcore song with slow parts thrown in, Conner heard Sisters of Mercy gloom, Sabbath riffs, and Beatles harmonies underneath Steele’s new baritone delivery, which weaves together sexual and divine themes. With four tracks over seven minutes long and four instrumental interludes, Conner heard a cinematic epic, importantly, one that would cross over to fans in multiple genres: goth kids, metalheads, maybe even soft-rock fans, who would get a doom-laden cover of Seals and Crofts’ “Summer Breeze.” Roadrunner sent the demo to Jim Steinman, a producer on Sisters of Mercy’s 1987 album Floodland, who remarked, “There’s nothing I can add to this.” The label never again insisted on a producer for the band. Once they could reinvent a genre whole cloth by themselves, they never again had to answer to a label. While “Black No. 1” is the band’s trademark song, the 11-minute, organ-drenched dirge “Bloody Kisses (A Death in the Family)” is the album’s emotional centerpiece. Ostensibly about a woman who died by suicide, it’s actually a veiled tribute to Steele’s elderly cat Venus, who died while he was writing the album. It’s also Steele’s first stab at describing emotional pain without couching it in humor or veiled misogyny—a heartbreaking ode to a creature he adored, one who used to sit on his chest while he did bench presses. “No one wants to hear a guy who’s six-foot-eight with long black hair and fangs crying about his fuckin’ cat,” Steele said, “so I had to make it extremely metaphorical.” The title track is a characterization of Steele as a person to this point in his life: deeply emotional and sentimental, struggling to convey his humanity. For the first time, fans were exposed to how raw Steele could be when he really tried. However, this is not the case throughout the album. Steele would still hedge his real misanthropy and pain with tongue-in-cheek New York brashness. Even the cover of the album, a pair of goth women, with parted bloodied lips and closed eyes in apparent ecstasy, is difficult to take seriously, especially knowing the two album covers that preceded Bloody Kisses. Is Steele skewering goth girls, as he does on “Black No. 1”? Did he tire of producing albums that would be judged, quite harshly, by their covers? Steele never gave a definitive answer, and the band later complained that they hated the finished product. Steele, obsessed with the color green, complained that the particular shade of green was all wrong, after spending hours rifling through color swatches that designers use. It was also around this time that Steele began to employ a type of vampiric affect in his vocal delivery. In the first verse of “Black No. 1,” he stresses final consonants in “dark,” and “milk,” trilling the “t’s” on the phrase “trick or treat,” sucking air through his fangs before cooing, “Happy Halloween, baby.” Left to their own devices, Silver and Steele purposefully added a layer of sensuality to the vocals, putting Steele front-and-center. Silver added more compression than usual to the microphone, which is, according to Conner, “why you can hear every time Peter smacks his lips.” The intended effect was to go a step beyond what forebears like Sisters of Mercy were doing in creating a sense of mystique and sexuality—and it worked. “It’s like you’re inside his mouth,” Conner said. “It’s all so immediate.” Doing press for the Bloody Kisses tour, Steele was asked about this vocal transformation, and in typical fashion, he couldn’t describe his art in a straightforward or neutral manner. “I’ve really gotten sick and tired of all these male vocalists with low testosterone levels that sound like little girls having their feet tickled,” Steele said. “I think men should sound like men.” This is a hill Steele would die on. From his time in the New York hardcore and thrash scenes through Bloody Kisses, and even near the end of his life, he spoke in a heteronormative, gender-biased tongue. In his final interview, in 2010, he said, “I admit, I am a sexist,” before throwing off another one-liner about being sexist against men only, but there is truth in humor. He didn’t appear to care that people thought of him this way either, which, in addition to the publicity these interviews would create—without any truly negative consequences—is why he kept giving them. Metal and punk bands are rightfully called to account by fans, critics, and artists in these subcultures for a fraction of what Steele has said into a microphone or tape recorder. Part of the reason Steele has gotten a pass is a longstanding narrative that frames him as a wan, unreliable narrator who is maybe-maybe-not just stirring the pot. After all, his recipe for most things was half-sincere, half-ironic, as if he could never really commit fully to one genre. The closer, “Can’t Lose You,” is a sitar-laden dirge that features Steele crooning “I can’t lose you” repeatedly. It appears as an unironic plea to a lost love for five minutes, until fading out with the so-called Bensonhoist Lesbian Choir—e.g. his bandmates and friends from Brooklyn who would hang out in the studio—chanting, barely audible, “Everybody smokes pot/Monte Conner sucks cock.” (Conner would later brush the intended insult off, saying, “It wasn’t meant to be mean.”) Type O Negative would evolve further into the goth rock side of gothic metal. Though the music would never be better than it was on Bloody Kisses, the band eventually took (overt) homophobia and misogyny off the records. For what it’s worth, Steele tried to walk back some of his words in that final interview, speaking of “I Know You’re Fucking Someone Else,” from Slow, Deep and Hard: “When I used the words ‘slut,’ ‘whore,’ and, ‘cunt’… I’m not proud of that language.” After Bloody Kisses was released in August 1993, Type O Negative, by association, became both a beneficiary—and a casualty—of the 1990s goth and nu-metal subculture, no doubt reinvigorated by the films of Tim Burton, the rise of Marilyn Manson, and the ubiquitousness of Hot Topic, which specialized in merchandise depicting the films of Tim Burton and the music of Marilyn Manson. Type O Negative also shared bills with labelmates Coal Chamber, Fear Factory, and Spineshank as Roadrunner shifted its focus to nu-metal near the end of the decade. They no doubt made converts out of fans of their sleeker industrial and nu-metal openers, but along the way became lumped in with the black JNCOs set. And that’s despite Type O Negative hitting on a mid-90s pop-culture trifecta in the wake of Bloody Kisses. Beavis and Butthead, watching the “Black No. 1” video, gave a rare favorable review, calling the sound, “A cross between Danzig and Megadeth.” Steele appeared on a 1995 The Jerry Springer Show episode called “Sexy Groupie Girls Tell All!” where a woman with a crude tattoo of the Type O logo on her shoulder calls him “the most beautiful man she’s ever seen.” And, infamously, eager goths opened that year’s August issue of Playgirl to see a fully nude Steele unfurl from the centerfold. Today, you can still buy a Bloody Kisses T-shirt at Hot Topic, just as you can purchase an officially licensed Jack Skellington oven mitt. But you can also find numerous editions of obscure Type O Negative designs from any number of bootleg T-shirt makers on Instagram alongside ones for well-regarded metal bands like Bolt Thrower and Obituary. On Halloween 2017, I sipped bourbon at an Austin dive bar as metalheads chanted the chorus from “Christian Woman” as if at a revival church. The Type O Negative logo—a negative symbol inside a circle, both green—is newly iconic, like the Crass cross or the Black Flag bars. It has become a token of both goth and metal culture, not just because of its austere radioactive design, but because Bloody Kisses remains a unifier of goth and metal, an uncut gem stuck between the dump and the landfill. When Peter Steele died from sepsis on April 14, 2010, the most revealing tribute for Steele came from Julius Spiegel, Brooklyn Commissioner of Parks: I remember Pete Ratajczyk [Steele’s real name] not at all like the dark character some of the blogs have portrayed, but as a very hard-working, sweet and respectful guy, always eager to please. Even after he had achieved notoriety, he would visit us, occasionally even coming to our hokey dinner-dances, just to reminisce. He often joked (at least I thought he was joking) about coming back to work at the Parks Dept. Spiegel nails Steele in three sentences: the blue-collar mentality, Steele’s penchant for nostalgia, his cryptic sense of humor, and, importantly, the dichotomy between Steele’s public and private personas that came to fruition during the making of Bloody Kisses. The self-described “monster” and “psychopath” was really a sweet lunch-pail-type guy, according to a coworker who knew him pretty well—a braggadocious behemoth with prehistoric views, who swigged red wine by the bottle when he performed to combat stage fright. It was that duality that forever cast himself and his band in that absurd, singular, toxic green light.

Always Tomorrow,Best Coast,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c2b18a5496f0009129779/1:1/w_160/Always%20Tomorrow_Best%20Coast.jpg,2020-02-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/best-coast-always-tomorrow/,Concord,"The Best Coast narrative was simple—cats, California, crushes, weed, all sung over sun-drenched guitars. But a closer read of the band’s output can be disconcerting: “Look to the future, nothing’s there,” Bethany Cosentino sang over tambourine hits on 2012’s The Only Place. On her 2015 follow-up California Nights, her tone was similarly ebullient as she sang, “I have no reason to be sad/But I find a way/Almost every day.” The song was titled “When Will I Change.” Fuzz pedals and spacious vocal reverb cast a warm sepia tone, but on their own, some of her words sooner evoked dead-end depression than playful slacktivism. Cosentino’s work met plenty of criticism, much of it openly sexist, but the troubling emotional undercurrents were dismissed as growing pains, if they were mentioned at all. Sameness, both sonically and lyrically, was treated as an artistic block, rather than a psychological one. Always Tomorrow—Best Coast’s first LP in five years, setting aside their 2018 children’s album—is a dispatch from a better place. In that span of time, Cosentino made a number of moves toward personal growth. She’s become one of the most prominent figures to speak out about sexual misconduct in the music industry, finding a new way of using her voice and platform to inspire change. And crucially, she began to pursue sobriety. She took inspiration in part from Jennifer Clavin of Bleached, another SoCal band that turned a new leaf after years of hard partying. The idea of public sobriety is relatively new; only a decade ago, stints in rehab and admissions of struggles with substance abuse might, at best, warrant a mawkish tour of the talk show circuit. But in the era of confessional media, musicians like Cosentino, Clavin, and Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield, as well as higher-profile celebrities like Ben Affleck and Courtney Love, are speaking openly about getting clean. With the newfound visibility comes a breadth of approaches to creating art while sober. For Crutchfield, sobriety has meant a return “to my roots, musically,” a pared-back, folk-inspired approach to songwriting that feels like a refresh. Bleached’s post-sobriety album Don’t You Think You’ve Had Enough took a more direct approach, while still keeping sobriety itself at arm’s length. Cosentino’s preferred songwriting mode is more explicit. “Took away substances, that’s the only change I see,” she sings on “Rollercoaster.” “Different Light” makes no direct reference to drugs or alcohol, but emphatically encourages its subject to embark on a similar journey. “Who am I to judge if you still see things in a different light?” she sings, her lack of judgement slightly unconvincing. Even when ruminating on anxiety, she holds fast to a positive outlook: “Finally I’ve seen the light/Finally I’m the master of my own mind,” she sings on “Master of My Own Mind.” It’s not a surprise to hear direct inspiration from Cosentino’s personal life—she’s never been one to take poetic license when it’s just as easy to say, “I’m crying.” Where previous records translated that candidness into empathy, here her singular focus comes across as self-satisfied. It’s not that sobriety itself is boring or smug; it’s that Cosentino has seemingly started at the finish line. “I guess this is what they mean when they say, ‘people can change,’” she sings on “For the First Time.” She is even more straightforward on “Everything Has Changed,” recounting old insecurities and bad habits before belting the chorus’ affirmation: “Everything has changed, and I like it this way.” If it sounds like a motivational after-school special, it might be because Cosentino wrote the lyrics a year prior to kicking substances, imagining an ideal world before she began to occupy it. That’s a testament to the power of self-actualization—but it can also scan as superficial, treating sobriety as a silver bullet. While the songwriting can be simplistic, Always Tomorrow also showcases Cosentino’s expanding range as a vocalist and songwriter. There’s a chiming richness to her voice; bright, and clean, it cuts above the thick reverb of the instrumentation without turning to syrup. Working with producers Carlos de la Garza and Justin Meldal-Johnsen, who’ve elevated powerhouse vocalists for bands like Paramore, Charly Bliss, and Cherry Glazerr, Cosentino uses her voice to set the moods to match the album’s more adventurous compositional modes. There’s a clear effort to differentiate Best Coast’s songs from their presumed mold of surf rock and hazy power-pop. Small flourishes, like the synths that introduce “Seeing Red” or the soaring chords on “Used to Be,” help to break away from uniformity. On “True,” an uncharacteristically slow and twangy love song, her elongated vowels exude a lonesome sweetness that recalls Roy Orbison. As easy as it might be to discard Cosentino’s platitudes about personal growth, it’s tough to ignore the obvious strides she’s made as a vocalist. Best Coast spent years chasing highs and documenting the lows with impressive, if often prosaic, frankness. And though they’ve finally found the optimism to match their sun-washed disposition, it’s Cosentino’s musicianship and knack for melody that prevents these songs from turning to fluff. Still, the record often slips into performative positivity; worthy ideas about overcoming challenges are subsumed by her rosy outlook. Despite the sheen of self-reflection, Always Tomorrow feels designed to convince everyone else as much as herself.

Soakie,Soakie,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c22fda5496f0009129776/1:1/w_160/Soakie_Soakie.jpg,2020-02-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soakie-soakie/,La Vida Es Un Mus,"Soakie make breakneck rippers. The hardcore quartet, with members stretched between Australia and New York City, confront abuses of power, unchecked male privilege, and capitalist complacency at tornado speed. The band formed in 2018 when drummer Austin and vocalist Summer befriended guitarist Chumz and bassist Nellie in Melbourne. With visas dangerously close to expiration, the band held their first practice, played their first show, and recorded a demo all under two weeks. Subsequent songs were played hard and loud, with an urgency that suggested that the ground beneath the band was being swallowed by lava. Two years later, Soakie’s searing self-titled debut maintains that anarchic defiance. Opener “Nuke the Frats” is a blast of thick reverb, shredding, and unrestrained spite. Summer, whose caustic, deep-fried snarl evokes punk greats like Vi Subversa and Kathleen Hanna at her most feral, uses her voice as a tool to mimic and ridicule convention. On the fiery “Or You Or You,” she snaps from childish innocence to a gnarly, face-melting howl while breathlessly yelping a curt dismissal: “I don’t want to talk to you!” “Power Tool” is as jagged and incisive as a chainsaw. Built off a gloriously sneering chorus—“Football, red meat, power tools!”—it is a compelling demand to open up this fucking pit. A good chunk of these tracks are sharpened and beefed-up versions of songs that first appeared on the 2018 demo. Though the band continues to skewer and satirize the mainstream, Soakie’s new screeds signal an increasingly nuanced writing approach with an explicitly political focus. “Ditch the Rich” is a rallying cry that demands “all the rich get in a ditch,” while quietly pointing out the dismal reality of wealth inequality: “I don’t see any dream, all I see is Mickey D’s.” “I’m sick of fascist politics,” Summer screams on closer “Don’t Talk Back” over her bandmates’ thrashing. “What’s Your Gender” questions the value of binaries and social conventions atop a wall of crashing cymbals and dense riffing. While it ends on a doggedly resilient note (“I am happy, love myself/And you can all just go to hell”), the song emphasizes that this hopefulness is a hard-won in a world hellbent on self-destruction. Soakie’s greatest moment laments a headache as old as time: “There are too many fucking boys on stage!” “Boys on Stage,” a furious indictment of gender inequality in music scenes large and small, is a crucial anthem on a sadly evergreen topic. Summer mocks badges of masculinity and scene cred like emo lyrics and studded leather jackets with oozing sarcasm: “I see you man, you’re real hardcore!” she cheers, eyes rolling out of her head. “Boys on Stage” concludes with an exuberant declaration: “It’s not just only boys!/There’s girls here now!” It’s a vision of inclusion, a symbol of why listening to Soakie feels so exhilarating. Frustration and anger can leave you listless; these seven songs transform the feeling into pogoing, throat-ripping liberation.

I Let It In and It Took Everything,Loathe,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c12257fe1550008882dab/1:1/w_160/I%20Let%20It%20In_Loathe.jpg,2020-02-22 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loathe-i-let-it-in-and-it-took-everything/,SharpTone,"On their second album I Let It In and It Took Everything, the Liverpudlian band Loathe probe the connection between heavy music and ambient, intertwining prog-metal breakdowns with sweeping synthesizers and shoegaze textures. In the same way Deafheaven’s Sunbather served as an effective entry point to black metal for the uninitiated, this album expands the borders of what a metalcore band can sound like, and they do it while writing evocative choruses and fierce breakdowns in equal measure. Loathe have greatly evolved from the aspirational yet occasionally timid metalcore band they were on their 2017 debut The Cold Sun. Now, nothing is off-limits, from the sample of a Nina Simone interview on the ambient interlude “451 Days” to the catchy nu-metal sludge of “Screaming.” When “New Faces In the Dark” makes an abrupt left turn from a Smiths-style guitar lick to feedback spirals and djent-y riffs, the contrast hits like a fist to the jaw. On “A Sad Cartoon,” they even channel early-’00s emo, juggling clean-toned guitars and dueling vocals. Deftones diehards will immediately spot the influence of Chino Moreno’s lovesick vocals on lead vocalist Kadeem France—Moreno counts himself a fan of the band—while guitarists Erik Bickerstaffe and Connor Sweeney tap into both the sweeping magnificence of Slowdive and the visceral pulse of more extreme groups like Meshuggah. They balance all of these competing influences with meticulous precision; on “Broken Vision Rhythm,” drummer Sean Radcliffe stuffs a miniature history of prog drumming into a song that doesn’t even crack three minutes. It’s immediately followed by the gauzy epic “Two-Way Mirror,” Loathe’s closest thing to a potential crossover hit. Bickerstaffe is hardly the first metal musician to use (or abuse) the lower tones of a baritone guitar, but he’s able to conjure titanic slabs of distortion that never sound overwrought. The members of Loathe have bonafides in the UK underground metal scene, having come up in various Liverpool bands before they started playing together in 2014. But the songwriting throughout I Let It In hints at a band more focused on bringing new fans into the fold than appeasing old ones. During a recent interview discussing “Red Room” and “Gored”—two of the more aggressive tracks here, which see France dig deep into his larynx for guttural, inhuman tones—the frontman touched on the all-encompassing ambition of their new record. “If it comes naturally to us, we want to do it,” he said. In the past, France has referred to Loathe as a collective—a single unit defined by their shared passion, and not their instruments. The songs bear out this ideology; France might handle most of the screaming and singing in Loathe, but he and Bickerstaffe trade off clean vocals for certain songs. The two have similar enough timbres that they can blend effortlessly. Harmonizing at the apex of “Two-Way Mirror,” they put a human stamp on the surrounding walls of distortion, grounding themselves to a shared emotional bond that transcends genre.","On their second album, the metalcore band widens the limits of its genre, incorporating nu-metal, shoegaze, and even early-’00s emo.

Miss Anthropocene,Grimes,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c156ca5496f0009129773/1:1/w_160/Miss%20Anthropocene_Grimes.jpg,2020-02-21 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grimes-miss-anthropocene/,4AD,"In 2011, Grimes was eager to say in an interview that she had “been studying pop stars.” Since emerging 10 years ago as a DIY ingénue out of Montreal’s freewheeling music scene, Claire Boucher has become known for her experimental production that often traded discernible lyrics for otherworldly and synthetic vocal textures. The words she sang didn’t figure into what made her music so fascinating—it was how she used her vocals to mimic whalesong or aliensong, a futurist reimagining of the transfixing voices of Enya and Mariah Carey, over irresistible melodies. Yes, Grimes always wanted to be a pop star, but on her own creative terms. Miss Anthropocene is Grimes’ fifth album and her first as that bona fide pop star—the result of widespread acclaim for both 2012’s Visions and 2015’s addictive and upbeat Art Angels. With this new celebrity, accelerated by her relationship with tech billionaire Elon Musk, Grimes wants to talk about the climate crisis—although she doesn’t use that more accurate phrasing herself. “I wanted to make climate change fun,” she’s said in interviews and on her Instagram. Meaning, Grimes is using her preferred lenses of fantasy, villainy, and pop iconography to attempt to engage with reality. The result is a record that’s more morose than her previous work, but no less camp. Art Angels was the result of a decade spent feverishly honing the tenets of songwriting, production, and engineering in order to show listeners who she was, and what she could do (be a pop star). Miss Anthropocene is the willful destruction of that self-conception. Grimes calls the sound “ethereal nu metal,” and the vibe is more honest to the pensive, sometimes cynical, public persona Grimes has shared in public over the last decade. In November 2018, Grimes released “We Appreciate Power,” a collaboration with her best friend HANA, and a cunningly meta prelude to Miss Anthropocene. Though the propulsive, guitar-driven track didn’t end up on the album, it reveals the aesthetic cynicism behind it: a beckoning chant about capitulating to A.I. supremacy from the perspective of a girl group, the ultimate vessel for artifice and propaganda. Surprisingly—or not, given Grimes’ track record of being more outspoken on Twitter and Tumblr—the 10 tracks that make up Miss Anthropocene, are lyrically more ambiguous about this ambitious theme. Instead, we’re left with a convoluted  narrative about personifying climate change through a fictional cosmology of demons and villainesses giddily celebrating global warming as a force of good. In that sense, Miss Anthropocene reflects the creative state in which it was made: “negative, aggressive, and isolating.” When Grimes veers away from high concept toward examining intimate and relational forms of human erosion, Miss Anthropocene finds some clarity. “We don’t love our bodies anymore,” she intones over the droning wasteland of “Darkseid,” which also features metallic vocals by the Taiwanese-rapper 潘PAN (formerly Aristophanes). “So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth,” introduces this conceit, weighed down by a simple drum pattern. It’s a lament about the ways in which women are domesticated through patriarchal forms of control. “Specifically how when a dude cums inside you, you become in their thrall,” she said in an April 2019 interview, alluding to her relationship with Musk, who is now thought to be the father of her expected child. “Love can be this beautiful thing, but then love is the thing that’s fucking up my career. The biggest change … is losing my hardcore masculinity. I used to just be free of all this bullshit all the other girls were going through, and now I feel like I’m not.” (She’s more besotted, jubilant even, on the winsome closer “IDORU.”) And on “Delete Forever,” she shifts focus to addiction, vocals high and clear in the mix as she sings over a freakin’ banjo: “I can’t see above it, guess I fuckin’ love it.” It’s a sublime, mood-perfect vignette of self-destructive nihilism. Grimes wrote it the night Lil Peep died of an accidental overdose. Miss Anthropocene thrills when it reveals a refined, linear evolution of Grimes’ long-standing interest in rave nostalgia and alluring pop music from around the world. On “Violence,” a vocal trance banger co-produced by Deadmau5 affiliate i_o that’s destined for a RuPaul’s Drag Race lip-sync, Grimes gives one of her most dynamic performances. Through gauzy overdubs and steady four-on-the-floor drums, she flips between whimpering and a snarl to delineate perspectives of an abusive relationship. And “4ÆM,” which she teased two years ago as an “ethereal chav jam that’s like a cyberpunk interpretation of the [Bollywood historical fantasy blockbuster] Bajirao Mastani,” delivers on the mind-bogglingly referential impulse. It’s Hollywood futurism: an Orientalist fantasia colliding with a revved-up hook; the soundtrack to a John Wick fight scene. So much about the actual music of Miss Anthropocene succeeds that the choice to bury it below a warped—and yes, misanthropic—concept about “The Environment” makes it hard to connect with who Grimes is as an artist today. Standing in the way of humans reckoning with climate emergency are multiple delusions: that wealth brings freedom, that boundless acquisition and unchecked growth remain tenable, and that political and economic institutions are inherently trustworthy actors. Grimes sounds like the pop star she’s worked very hard to become, but her imagination seems diminished—or, like many of her celebrity ilk, is cordoned off in a bubble floating above the rest of humanity. In 2020, revolutionary pop stardom might try to clarify, rather than obscure, the havoc that systems wreak when it comes to, say, gender roles and social compliance, technology and surveillance capitalism, nationalism and land exploitation, or whiteness and pathological denial. And that’s the obstacle, the slimy mouthfeel, standing in the way of Miss Anthropocene offering genuine catharsis: Grimes, the self-taught, self-possessed iconoclast, as insincere. In this very specific political moment rendering climate crisis as dystopian aesthetic is privileged and indulgent, and perhaps even more frustrating given Grimes’ stage wink of an album title. Who exactly is the subject of her misanthropy? Having achieved recognition and acclaim for what she can do with Visions and Art Angels, the question remains: Who is she now? And so, some footnotes from Grimes’ life feel useful here: childhood ballerina, daughter of a former accountant and former Crown prosecutor-turned-journalist, and in a relationship with a man whose real-time net worth literally jumped from $41 billion to $44.2 billion between drafts of this review. Sometimes it is important to be reminded that celebrity is also a system, a way of distracting the powerless and nurturing ruling class values through notions of exceptionalism and vanity. Perhaps, before she was a pop star, Grimes might have made a statement with this album—but what the world needs now is less obfuscation, not more. Correction: An earlier version of this review erroneously stated that Grimes was managed by Roc Nation, a company that had ties to the National Football League. This reference has been excised. The review has also been updated to clarify the career of Claire Boucher’s father. He is a former accountant. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.

White Ladder (20th Anniversary Edition),David Gray,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e46d8f0159e01000820c5dc/1:1/w_160/White%20Ladder_David%20Gray.jpg,2020-02-21 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-gray-white-ladder-20th-anniversary-edition/,AWALIHT,"David Gray was once renowned for how famous he wasn’t—a singer-songwriter’s singer-songwriter, denied mainstream success in a way that registered as injustice by his cult of fans and admirers. Abandoned by EMI after 1996’s self-deprecatingly titled Sell, Sell, Sell did the exact opposite, the British musician recorded his fourth album, White Ladder, in his apartment and released it on his own IHT label; the record subsequently achieved the rarefied level of ubiquity where its omnipresence became one of its defining characteristics. In a snide yet mostly positive review of White Ladder’s 2000 reissue, NME imagined Gray’s “eyes-closed sincerity” soundtracking mortgage ads until the end of time. “A whole generation of couples stared meaningfully into each other’s eyes as they performed their first wedding dance to ‘This Year’s Love,’” The Guardian quipped in 2010. “Without reverting to excessive hyperbole, there wasn't a home in Ireland that didn't own a copy of David Gray's breakthrough album,” one local paper claimed. In a nation that produced U2, the Corrs, and Clannad, White Ladder remains the best-selling album of all time. By 2001, Gray was on a level with Eminem and Britney Spears—at least in the sense that his music was used alongside theirs to torture prisoners at Guantanamo; Haj Ali, photographed as a hooded prisoner of war in Abu Ghraib, claimed that he was stripped, handcuffed and forced to hear a loop of “Babylon” so loud that he feared his head would burst. Twenty years later, that Gray never really felt as famous or infamous as Eminem or Britney Spears only enhances White Ladder’s aura as an isolated incident that defies explanation: a modest collection of songs about lost love, drinking, and drinking over lost love, by an Everyman who was soon Everywhere. Adding 1998’s state-of-the-art electronic beats to his sturdy, occasionally sappy folk-pop gave White Ladder an air of novelty, even if it was hardly anomalous during a time when the coffee house and the club converged into a veritable subgenre: Think, for instance, of Everything But the Girl’s Walking Wounded, or Beth Orton collaborating with William Orbit. Though “Sail Away” featured production from Marius de Vries, a collaborator of Bjork and Madonna, White Ladder wasn’t intended as a reinvention. The newly aerodynamic production contrasted with Gray’s endearingly po-faced image, emphasizing what he already was: a self-described sincere guy with a guitar, and also a man slightly out of time, someone watching from the periphery as others less burdened by regret lived, laughed, and danced without care. Paul Hartnoll of Orbital weaponized the four-on-the-floor thump that brings “Please Forgive Me” to a climax into an unlikely Ibiza smash, while the single “Babylon” was given an industrial remake. But on White Ladder, these underlying elements of dance music sounded like they were being experienced from a safe and sad distance, a drum’n’bass track muffled by a midnight cab’s dull engine roar. The synthetic percussion of White Ladder betrays its origins as a home-recorded folktronica album—the hollowed-out trip-hop drums of “Nightblindness” bear the requisite influence of Radiohead’s “Climbing Up the Walls,” while the lightly carbonated shuffle of “Silver Lining” makes Gray sound like he’s suspended in a glass of OK Cola for six minutes. “Please Forgive Me” was also included in the pilot of Scrubs, more indicative than its club cameos of the album’s future in meet-cute media. Half of its 10 songs were released as singles, so White Ladder clearly worked as a collection of episodes that could be experienced discretely and repeatedly. There’s no linguistic subtext to any song on White Ladder: Recall that Gray’s sincerity and plainspokenness are his main selling points, but the lack of specificity leaves space for emotional interpretation. “This Year’s Love” likely did soundtrack countless wedding dances and many drank alone to it. The pleas of “Sail Away” are either bravely passionate or absolutely desperate; “We’re Not Right” can either be a blithe acceptance of alcoholism’s grim fate or an agent for change. “Babylon” tells a story with a clear conflict and resolution that still leaves room for projection—to tell someone you love them or that you loved them or even that you wish you had told them these things. “If you want it, come and get it for crying out loud,” and whatever it was, you could get it: “Babylon” was a festival anthem disguised as a counterbalance to the monsters of Glastonbury. The frontloading of its biggest, most unabashedly optimistic hits lends White Ladder a narrative thread: As I always imagined it, here was a skeptical romantic hitting the bars with a precarious hope of finding connection; slowly sulking into the corner while his friends laughed and flirted; bitterly going home to commiserate with his favorite records. It all ends with an unfathomably sad, nine-minute cover of Soft Cell’s “Say Hello, Wave Goodbye” that interpolates Van Morrison’s “Madame George” and “Into the Mystic.” White Ladder might not exist without Dave Matthews; Gray promoted the album while opening for Matthews, a close friend and a notable influence on White Ladder’s more grating vocal tics—on the title track, when Gray wheezes, “There’s no rhyme or reeeeeason,” a John Popper harmonica solo wouldn’t be entirely unexpected. Eventually, Gray made the relationship officially symbiotic when White Ladder became the inaugural release on Matthew’s ATO Records, the eventual launchpad for similarly rootsy sensations like My Morning Jacket and Alabama Shakes. A curious thing happened: Gray’s album, clearly adult-contemporary in both sound and subject matter, became a hit with people a decade younger than the 30-something singer-songwriter. “Gap-year students mouthed the lyrics to ‘Sail Away’ as they backpacked around Nepal. Young professionals listened to ‘Babylon’ as they assembled Ikea furniture in their riverside development flats,” The Guardian observed; in the same article, Gray groused at the way White Ladder’s commercial success had led him to be “dismissed as slight.” To counter that dismissal, the subsequent compilations The EPs 1992-1994 and Lost Songs 95-98 wisely capitalized on Gray’s sudden fame while reminding new fans of his humble origins. The right-sizing of his public persona was made explicit by 2002’s muted and morose A New Day at Midnight, which began with a song called “Dead in the Water.” A New Day at Midnight still sold well, if not quite at White Ladder levels: 4x platinum in the UK instead of 10x, and in America, gold instead of platinum; likewise, the chart success of 2005’s Life in Slow Motion could only be considered disappointing by the standards of White Ladder. Life in Slow Motion was Gray’s last major-label album before Draw the Line brought him full circle four years later, without a label and recording in his own studio (albeit an upgrade from his apartment to a studio once owned by the Eurythmics). While White Ladder was virtually inescapable in public spaces during the early 2000s, its influence has dissipated in the time since, though it is audible in the crystalline, cosmic folk of Amen Dunes’ 2018 album Freedom. Gray himself suggested that he had paved the way for folk-pop idols like Ed Sheeran and James Blunt. “When I started out, a man with a guitar baring his soul wasn't in vogue at all. Suddenly, it's everywhere!” Gray exclaimed in 2011, despite soul-bearing guitar men being the primary vessel for acclaimed rock music for the past 50 years. Yet he’s not totally wrong. Man or woman, guitar or no guitar, the world will always be full of people who believe that they’re the only ones truly baring their soul, doing so in a way that brings them constant misunderstanding and disappointment at their jobs and relationships, an exception in a world where dishonesty and artifice are the rule and guys like David Gray get dropped from their label. And then an album like White Ladder comes along to sell millions of copies and offer the hope that living the exact same way can be the best revenge.

Random Desire,Greg Dulli,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c17d9159e01000820c7fa/1:1/w_160/Random%20Desire_Greg%20Dulli.jpg,2020-02-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/greg-dulli-random-desire/,Royal CreamBMG,"Greg Dulli closes his first official solo album with a richly atmospheric, slowly unfurling ballad called “Slow Pan”—a fitting move for an artist who approaches rock’n’roll with the methodical gaze of a cinematographer. Over the past 30 years, the ensembles Dulli has fronted have assumed different names—first, the Afghan Whigs, then The Twilight Singers, and then back to the Whigs— but his widescreen sensibility has never wavered. Usually, the term “cinematic” is reserved for instrumental music suggesting grandeur and gravitas, but Dulli prefers to drop you into the thick of the action. His records are like romantic thrillers with all the exposition and character development stripped out, leaving only moments of heated conflict and disarming confessions. Random Desire further affirms Dulli’s vision, even in the absence of his trusty bands behind him. With the Afghan Whigs once again on hiatus—following bassist/co-founder John Curley’s return to school and the 2017 death of guitarist Dave Rosser from colon cancer—Dulli conceived Random Desire as a one-man operation, but ended up pulling in various longtime associates in for guest spots. The branding and methodology have changed, but the intent and effect are ultimately the same. Like pretty much every record Dulli has made since the Whigs left Sub Pop in the early ‘90s, Random Desire deftly mediates between guitar-slashing catharsis and candelabra-lit elegance. It is filled with the nocturnal ambiance, climactic crescendos, and savvy musical references we have come to expect from a Greg Dulli product. The instant you hear the tensely tapped piano pulses of “Sempre” and “The Tide,” you know it’s only a matter of time before the songs erupt into Joshua Tree-toppling surges, with Dulli engaging the most ravaged register of his voice like a guitarist kicking on an effects pedal. Random Desire also abounds with nods to Dulli’s omnivorous musical taste. He was once the only ‘90s indie-rocker to drop Lauryn Hill covers covers in his sets; now he’s practically adopting a triplet flow on the shuffling slow jam “Scorpio.” The Nick Cave-esque “A Ghost” invokes enough New Orleans voodoo vibes to yield Dulli’s very own “Red Right Hand.”  The album’s most devastating song requires no such theater: ""Marry Me,"" a mournful acoustic ballad, is a mea culpa from a non-committal cad who never worked up the courage to say those words to the one who just walked out on him. As much as it draws from Dulli’s dog-eared little black book, Random Desire features its share of inspired tangents, when he forgoes the elaborate full-band effect to embrace the mad-scientist possibilities of his solo set-up. The trip-hoppy lament “Lockless” features the album’s most pronounced use of electronics, and a brass fanfare that jolts the song back to life after Dulli powers down into a slow-motion slur. But the album’s biggest surprise is less musical than spiritual. On the bass-driven gospel sprint “Pantomima,” Dulli’s flair for heart-racing hysterics is reoriented around a feeling you rarely encounter in his discography: joy. “Desolation, come and get it!,” he beckons ironically, sounding more like a carnival barker than a prophet of doom. He seems to relish the irony: after 30 years, he needed to make a Greg Dulli record in order to sound a little less like Greg Dulli.

Molocular Meditation,Jan St. Werner,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4ec92594f6ea0009d3f255/1:1/w_160/Molocular%20Meditation_Jan%20St.%20Werner.jpg,2020-02-21 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jan-st-werner-molocular-meditation/,Editions Mego,"The final words that Mark E. Smith speaks on Jan St. Werner’s Molocular Meditation might be the most mundane thing that the phlegmatic leader of post-punk legends the Fall ever recorded: “I think that’s the lot, Jan. Thanks.” The comment was directed at St. Werner, the producer and musician known best as one half of electronic duo Mouse on Mars, letting him know that Smith was done recording. Arriving after nearly three minutes of synthesized clangs and what sound like faulty oscillators having a heated debate, it’s an odd postscript from a singer and poet known for fiery invective and grumbling insults. Everything else leading up to that aside is pure Smith. His coda comes at the end of “VS Cancelled,” a gentle nose-thumbing at Domino Records, the label that released the sole full-length by Von Südenfed, a collaborative project between Smith and Mouse on Mars. In the song, Smith reads an email from Domino’s general manager Jonny Bradshaw, who is dropping the group from the label. “I’m afraid it looks like we won’t be able to pick up the option. I told you times were tough.” Smith punctuates that last sentence with a rueful laugh. One trait Smith shared with St. Werner was a penchant for reinvention. That was often by necessity for the Fall founder, considering the dozens of people who logged time in his band during its 40-year existence. But throughout the respective careers of both men, each project often seemed to begin with a clean slate, completely ignoring what came before. Likewise, Molocular Meditation has little precedent in the discographies of either artist, whether separately or together. The album’s centerpiece is its title track, a re-edited version of a sound piece commissioned by Manchester, England’s Cornerhouse that premiered in 2014. The 20-minute work was originally conceived for multi-channel sound, which meant being in a room surrounded by St. Werner’s freeform electronic trills and hums while Smith’s growling voice spat out blank-verse poetry: “The first problem of young American males/Public speaking according to the talking ducks of Russian television/You can throw all this behind you/This is a better life here.” Even in this mixed-down version, St. Werner’s music is enveloping and exciting. He responds to Smith’s word spouts by either buttressing them with synth wobbles or matching a frizzy melody to the rhythm of the speech, in the vein of the Books’ “Be Good to Them Always.” Or he will help punctuate a word by hitting it with an extra jolt of sound, so that when Smith draws out the syllables saying “immobile,” he’s paired with a groaning keyboard line. Smith’s work here is more lucid than anything he did on the last few Fall albums or his guest appearance on Gorillaz’ Plastic Beach. Maybe that has to do with not having to worry about melody or keeping up with a band, but he sounds hale and inspired, evoking the spirit of William S. Burroughs’ recorded work in his delivery and unmistakable drawl. The rest of Molocular Meditation comes from work that St. Werner was doing around the same time that he was constructing the Cornerhouse piece. Smith is also a central part of “Back to Animals,” but laid beneath waves of bioluminescent sound and rhythm. “On the Infinite of Universe and Worlds,” a commission by Finnish festival Music Nova, is less interesting: an array of arpeggiated patterns that leaves an itchy, unresolved feeling inside. St. Werner kindly lets the late Smith have the last words on this album, and it is, again, the ideal farewell for the singer and poet. He sounds positively tickled to be throwing up two fingers at Domino Records and mocking the superfluous details in the email (“I’m in Switzerland at the moment”). It’s the perfect punctuation mark to finish the story of a truly unique collaboration.","Assisted by the Fall’s late Mark E. Smith, the German experimental musician explores a fusion of abstract electronics and spoken word that has little precedent in his work with Mouse on Mars.

Man Alive!,King Krule,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4d5209f98c800008cf6620/1:1/w_160/King-Krule-Man-Alive.jpg,2020-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/king-krule-man-alive/,True Panther / Matador,"The man behind King Krule’s barbarian howl is a lover, not a fighter, but lean in close and the boundary gets foggy. The violence in Archy Marshall’s music arises from a romantic pathology—one that Marshall, who sings love songs the way Johnny Rotten sang “Anarchy in the UK,” knows intimately. “There’s a love in me to kill good things,” he once told an interviewer. Affection, fear, abandonment, fury—they’re all elements of Krule’s misery. On his best albums to date, The Ooz and A New Place 2 Drown, the South London songwriter turned troubled waters into exquisite fountains. Aquatic symbolism, meticulous production, and pearly embellishments made his grotto feel, for a while, like somewhere you could bathe. His third album as King Krule sounds like what it is, which is anguish. The putrid air of Man Alive! turns even the sweetest songs sour, as if they were stowed inside his body so long they became dank and light-fearing. That’s unlikely to alienate the fanbase for whom Marshall scoops out his guts. In a recent video for the narcotic lament “Don’t Let the Dragon (Draag On),” Marshall burns at the stake, martyring himself. Down in the comment section lurks his attendant brood of fatalists (“Clinical depression season is upon us, lads”), apostles (“If the moon could listen to music, he would listen to King Krule”), and solemn connoisseurs (“Like all great poetry, only a few will appreciate it”). Little surprise that this cult, formed during his teen explorations as Zoo Kid, has endured: The lanky London outlaw with cement-mixer lungs and a disastrous report card, redeemed by a volatile and monstrous talent, has a cute fairy-tale ring to it. Into this mythos steps Man Alive!, aesthetically dire and fatefully timed. The record was halfway finished when, during a spell of habitual boozing, Marshall learned that his partner, Charlotte Patmore, was pregnant. Moving with her to North West England, he dredged his blues and completed the album as a requiem to urban ennui. It plays as a sort of diptych: First the wily escapades—four steely, corrupted punk blasts—then a trove of laments filled with despair, despondency, and occasional knives of light. Marshall played and recorded nearly every instrument on Man Alive!—saxophonist Ignacio Salvadores also howls away—and the hollowed-out sound turns the darkness chilly. The opening suite’s Martin Hannett-style drums and weathered ambience evoke first-wave post-punk, when warped effects and dub spaciousness hinted at new worlds. But these songs are hammered into reality. In the barrens of “Comet Face” we encounter Marshall groggy, bloodied, and half-naked after being ambushed in a park in Peckham. But rather than seek vengeance, he mulls his hometown’s social cleansing, comparing London undesirables to “the pesticides in your vegetables”: Both have been erased in the quest for an organic utopia. A vaporous interlude called “The Dream” partitions the album; after that, Marshall retreats into his head. On the luminous folk of “Slinky,” he takes an emotional pounding before flashing back to the “Comet Face” assault in a nightmare. Dial tones and answering-machine messages drift in and out, suggesting crossed wires and deferred responsibilities. A devotee of sound-art tinkerers like Dean Blunt, Marshall has a skill for collage that subtly points you beyond the song. If it all sounds exhaustingly conceptual, consider a recent playlist pick that, like Man Alive!, begins with grim newscasts, dips in and out of dream scenes, and hinges on a dramatic narrative lurch. It’s not some Lynchian exercise in obscurity; it’s “A Day in the Life,” by the Beatles. Holding to Marshall’s wavelength requires a little more investment than the dingy music asks for, but that’s not to say his shadowland of the heart lacks nuance. The profound love—or perhaps addiction—described on “Perfecto Miserable” is double-edged, promising salvation by bottling up unresolved rage. Even the therapeutic mantras of “Alone, Omen 3” devolve, as an ambient fog descends, into nightmarish ravings. Impending parenthood stabilizes Marshall, or at least offers relief from his exhausting lifestyle. “Passport in my pocket’s getting old/Feel the weight of the world dissolve,” he riddles on “Airport Antenatal Airplane.” Amid his innate playfulness, I’m often struck by Marshall’s intensity with words, the way he threads and knots them like jute rope to hoist himself out of psychic craters. As for Man Alive!, Marshall has framed the title as a reaction to our diabolical political landscape. Given his fondness for aquatic metaphor, it could just as well herald a person saved. On this album of shipwrecking, there is a brief final act—played out in songs like the beseeching “Please Complete Thee”—that hints at this rescue, a dipping of toes into domesticity. Indeed, in a glowing photograph last March, Marshall and Patmore introduced us to their newborn daughter, Marina. Man Alive! maps an underworld of new places to drown; next time, he’ll finally have somewhere to dock.","The lanky London outlaw with cement-mixer lungs delivers his most anguished album yet, in which impending fatherhood collides with his habitual torments.

Swimmer,Tennis,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e46cdd97fe1550008882be0/1:1/w_160/SWIMMER_Tennis.jpg,2020-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tennis-swimmer/,Mutually Detrimental,"Tennis have never shied from kitsch. The duo founded their sound on a mix of nostalgic ’60s pop and schlocky soft-rock, and packaged it with album covers styled like art from a ’70s hair salon. Even their backstory was like a relic from a bygone era: Lovers Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley spent seven months sailing the Atlantic, and documented their leisure voyage on their 2011 debut album Cape Dory. That Seinfeld quip about nobody liking a kid with a pony applies doubly to adults with sailboats: In another world, the perfectly prim and preppy couple could’ve been antagonists from an ’80s summer camp movie. In their telling, they were the stars of their own paperback romance. It’s better to be a divisive band than a forgettable one, though. And exempting Vampire Weekend, no 2010s indie act weaponized their own privilege quite so provocatively. Tennis have outlasted most acts from the mp3 blog era in part because they were more audacious than most of them, but also because they’ve had the songwriting craft to back up all the shtick. Each record since Cape Dory has introduced new ripples to their fundamentally breezy sound, with producers like Richard Swift, Spoon’s Jim Eno and Black Keys’ Patrick Carney challenging the duo just enough to keep things interesting without upsetting their escapist appeal. Swimmer, Tennis’ fifth album, is self-produced, but even more voluptuous than anything they’ve recorded with a name producer, continuing their drift from reverby lo-fi throwbacks toward crisp R&B-laced pop. It’s not exactly a scarce sound—from Grimes to Tei Shi to Haim, plenty of DIY acts have channeled their humble inner Mariah Carey over the last decade or so—but Tennis’ take has moxie, and Moore’s deceptively pliable voice stands up to Swimmer’s production-driven aesthetic. The snappy “How to Forgive” is pure bubblegum, dreamy and limber, while “Need Your Love,” with its halting stop/starts and vampy pianos, is the catchiest track the duo has ever recorded, the showstopper that even Cape Dory didn’t deliver. Where 2017’s Yours Conditionally teased fissures in Moore and Riley’s once-faultless romance, Swimmer’s conflicts stem from external forces: toxic presences, aging parents, failing bodies. “Once I was young, those days are long gone, suddenly I’m 33 and on a gurney,” Moore sings on the album’s centerpiece “Echoes,” recounting the hospitalization that nearly derailed the group’s 2018 tour. The song is bright and peppy, with a tropical lilt—the good-humored response to the situation that Moore was apparently unable to muster in the moment. As her panicked husband rushes her to the hospital, she tries to lighten the mood with a quip and realizes she can’t. “It looks like I won’t be going down stoically,” she concedes. Tennis’ privileged worldview periodically bleeds through in offputting ways (Moore scoffs at “all the tourists as they flock to the sea” on the title track), but Swimmer is mostly sweet and personable. Any listener who’s followed Moore and Riley for five albums running is probably somewhat invested in their relationship, and once again, they’ve rewarded that interest. “I only have certainty when you hold my hand,” Moore sings tenderly on the closer “Matrimony II.” Domestic bliss may not be the flashiest muse, but Tennis commit to documenting it lovingly.

Duo Exchange: Complete Sessions / First Time Out: Live at Slugs 1967,Rashied AliFrank LoweRashied Ali Quintet,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e46ddce20256b00096ba8b1/1:1/w_160/Duo%20Exchange_Rashied%20Ali.jpg,2020-02-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rashied-ali-quintet-rashied-ali-fran-first-time-out-live-at-slugs-1967-duo-exchange-complete-sessions/,Survival Records,"When Elvin Jones left the John Coltrane Quartet in March 1966, signaling the end of the postwar era’s most formidable jazz band, Rashied Ali found himself in an enviable position, as Coltrane’s sole drummer. Ali was a 32-year-old with strong avant-garde credentials but little mainstream name recognition when Coltrane brought him into the fold for the Meditations sessions the year prior, as a second drummer to deepen the foundation for the saxophone titan’s late-career explorations in free rhythm and tonality. “I can really choose just about any direction at just about any time in the confidence that it will be compatible with what he’s doing,” Coltrane said of the young drummer, who favored a non-linear approach to time-keeping. If Jones was as dynamic and powerful as a freight train, Ali roved at will like a forcefield, protean and ever-shifting. One day in February 1967, just 5 months before Coltrane’s death, the saxophonist took Ali to New Jersey’s storied Van Gelder Studio to record, without any other members of the band. The stark horn-and-drums-only format was all but unimaginable at the time, and the resulting album, Interstellar Space, sat on the shelf for seven years before its first release in 1974. But the dizzying and intense music the duo recorded that day would prove highly influential in the decades to come, inspiring the next generation of free jazz musicians to turn the duo into a sort of standard format for the genre. When the New York Times’ Ben Ratliff asked free jazz pianist Borah Bergman why this duo format became so prevalent over the years, he deliberated over his answer for days, then responded via fax with one word: “economics.” The economics of jazz shifted as the ‘60s neared its end, as the music was beset on all sides by popular genres like rock and soul, and a club culture that didn’t always support musically progressive artists. Ali saw the tide turning, understanding that jazz artists would need to be self-reliant if they were to survive. He established his own infrastructure for the lean years to come, including a venue, Ali’s Alley in New York, and a label, tellingly called Survival Records. The imprint’s first release was Duo Exchange, an incandescent session between Ali and tenor saxophonist Frank Lowe, recorded after Interstellar Space but released a year before. After shuttering in 2009 and relaunching last year, Survival is reissuing Duo Exchange with an hour of additional material from the original session, and a heretofore unknown recording of Ali performing live with an ad hoc group in 1967. Duo Exchange’s status as one of the most caustic free jazz albums was assured well before Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore put it in his personal top ten for Grand Royal magazine in 1996. Lowe might have been new on the scene in the early ‘70s, but his afterburner of a horn on recording sessions for Alice Coltrane and Don Cherry showed he was a formidable sparring partner. For long stretches of the set, Ali and Lowe burn like a dragon dueling with a flamethrower. When Lowe’s needling high frequencies strafe across an alternate take of “Movement III,” it suggests a durational outpouring of fury. But the reissue also reveals moments of quiet and nuance from the sessions, presented here in their entirety. Amid his piercing overtones, Lowe’s reed playing sometimes brings to mind Coltrane’s famous “sheets of sound,” working to exhaust every possibility in his cascading runs. He seems to reach for a pure sound beyond notes per se, reflecting the squalor of early-‘70s New York through his horn. His tone is piercing, jarring, wearying, like the brakes on a train, an overheated tea kettle, a feverish baby. Ali is there with Lowe’s every breath, shattering the rhythm around him and propelling him to even greater extremes. Work your way past the shrieks and squeals and other qualities come to the fore—like Lowe’s hushed, vibrato-heavy tone midway through “Movement I,” or his fluttering against Ali’s shaken bells on the tranquil “Movement IV,” an oasis from the onslaught. Lowe even does his best ballad playing on the subtle “Movement V,” with Ali slipping in and around him, elbowing the drum skin to elicit strange new tones. After all the searing music that has come before, it makes for a sweet finale. Ali worked at the physical boundaries of the music, as he once told the Jazz Times: “Say we play a standard...we try to exhaust the tune. It's like all of a sudden gravity don't work no more.” Duo Exchange is a study in exhaustion, of that last two miles of the New York marathon, the 12th round of a heavyweight fight. It’s intense and cathartic, with little to diminish its harshness some forty years on. But it also has a sense of reverence: the sound of two men fighting against the city around them and pushing toward something new. The exhaustive quality of Duo Exchange also comes into play with First Time Out: Live at Slugs 1967. Found on two 7” reels of tape in Ali’s archive, it’s the lone evidence of a May 1967 performance at a notorious downtown Manhattan jazz dive. The liner notes suggest it was a last-minute booking, perhaps even unrehearsed. There’s no photo of the quintet that convened that night, and nothing to suggest they ever played together again. Live at Slugs is only the third known recording of Dewey Johnson, who played trumpet, in existence anywhere. Saxophonist Ramon Morris would later record a jazz-funk album, but here he is in Coltrane mode, taking long, winding solos. If you’re familiar with Ali in the context of iconoclastic giants like Coltrane or Keiji Haino, hearing him in a more relaxed and supportive role on Live at Slugs is startling. His cymbal work skitters and creates waves around the tunes, and he lays back frequently. Rather than the breathless sprints of Duo, the group exhausts each tune at a flâneur’s pace, offering only brief glimpses of the incandescence of Duo Sessions. The drunken meander of “Ballade” would remain in Ali’s repertoire for decades to come, while “Study For As-Salaam Alikum” would reappear in a tighter, transfigured form on another Ali album from the early ‘70s. But most of the other music would not be heard again. The tapes suggest that the recorder was set near Ali’s kit, as there’s times when the pianist Stanley Cowell and bassist Reggie Johnson can scarcely be made out. Murkiness aside, Live at Slugs is a fascinating snapshot of what turned out to be an idyllic moment in jazz history. The brutal race riots of Newark and Detroit and the “Long, Hot Summer” were still two months away, a string of cataclysmic events in urban epicenters that would undermine black communities and hasten “white flight.” Coltrane was still alive, as was his fellow free jazz firebrand Albert Ayler. It would be another 5 years before Lee Morgan was shot to death inside of Slugs’ Saloon. These two reissues capture that hard shift in economics: a quintet in the summer of ‘67 exploring at its own pace and a lean, snarling jazz duo just five years on, fighting for survival.

Demonstrating Visible Differences of Height EP,Babehoven,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e46d0b120256b00096ba879/1:1/w_160/Differences%20of%20Height_Babehoven.jpg,2020-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/babehoven-demonstrating-visible-differences-of-height-ep/,self-released,"Babehoven, the Philadelphia-via-Los Angeles band helmed by Maya Bon, saturates the listener in particulars. Her latest release, Demonstrating Visible Differences of Height, is a diaristic EP that charts attraction, loneliness, neuroses, and late capitalism in winsome, pointillist detail. Its appeal stems from highly personal textures, references, and ephemera—a view as intimate and up-close as a goldfish’s, and equally as frustrated by glass walls. These five songs get their emotional traction from Bon’s ambivalent, deadpan delivery, set against syrupy electric guitar and drums as slack as a morning-after fugue. On album standout “Asshole,” she sings, “If I always dick around, in the morning will I be an asshole?/While I’m laying on the ground/In the morning I wanna see your asshole.” Though the peculiar mix of self-loathing and lust feels very au courant, the backing instrumentation could’ve been a Slanted & Enchanted demo track. The song toggles between this central question and sensory bits and pieces: missing socks, chilly air conditioning, an exhortation to “Keep them coming, I can’t feel anything anyway.” As any noon-riser knows, there’s no separating the visible detritus from the feeling that you, too, might be lost and made partly of garbage. Where “Asshole” languishes, “Confident and Kind” hums along, the sort of ambling meditation that might soundtrack an episode of “Gilmore Girls.” “I’m wearing shorts for the very first time in my life, feeling confident and cute, confident and kind,” Bon sings unconvincingly, a half-hearted pep talk. Behind her, acoustic guitar strums like a nodding friend as she narrates the discovery of a pollen allergy, ensuing sickness, and a $500 salon visit she describes as “a narcissistic treat as the world is depleted.” In the course of a day, she covers climate guilt, the body’s treachery, and gender troubles, singing, “Having short hair as a femme in 2019/Feels like I don’t know my body/Feel like I am just nobody/Unless I have some silky soft hair.” The body is a cage; “Confident and Kind” describes the feeling of realizing its dimensions. There’s an urgency to Demonstrating Visible Differences of Height that’s belied by its mellow tempos, yet evident in the way Bon’s voice occasionally becomes fevered, panic setting in. The generality that unites the EP’s many specificities—the hair treatments, the Tuesdays, the self-doubt—is the recognition of our own limitations. Some walls close in from the outside, and some we build for ourselves, but confinement is confinement. Discouraged but not defeated, Babehoven soundtrack the feeling.","Maya Bon’s diaristic bedroom rock charts attraction, loneliness, neuroses, and late capitalism in winsome, pointillist detail.

Mercy,The Men,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e45caf07fe1550008882b3f/1:1/w_160/Mercy_The%20Men.jpg,2020-02-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-men-mercy/,Sacred Bones,"The music of the Men is defined by perpetual unrest, impulsive 180s, and an insistence on questioning assumptions. That quality has only become more entrenched in recent years: Where they spent the first half of the 2010s gradually drifting from the left to the right of the dial, 2018’s Drift ricocheted from industrial stompers to psych-folk hymns like some random sampler CD that’s glue-gunned to a pricey imported British music periodical. With each grab-bag of a record, it’s become clearer that the Men’s attraction to aesthetic chaos is motivated by a desire for inner peace, a musical analog to the process of cutting through the noise of modern life. The group’s eighth album in 10 years, Mercy, is arguably the clearest articulation of that mission: If the Men started out as a murderous post-hardcore band with latent classic-rock affinities, they’re now a frazzled country-rock act trying to control their periodic lapses into aggression. Like Drift, Mercy is an album of wild stylistic shifts, though it’s plotted along a more predictable course. And while this band can still flex its punk muscle when it wants to, the Men are writing better songs in more serene settings these days. With its binary mix of rustic lullabies and blown-out rockers, Mercy feels like a spiritual companion to 2013’s New Moon, the record where the Men’s mellower inclinations first came to the fore. And like that album’s genteel introduction, “Open the Door,” Mercy’s “Cool Water” welcomes you in with a pastoral serenade that functions as a balm. “I’m a pool of sweat, a canyon of regret, this bottle is my only friend,” Nick Chiericozzi sings, and when the song’s chorus mantra takes over three minutes in, it feels like a baptism. With its air of redemption, “Cool Water” is the rare opening track that would make an equally effective closer—an expression of hard-won salvation that usually follows a period of struggle. But the Men have always been proudly counter-intuitive, so they follow the record’s most comforting song with its most demanding. Though it shares the preceding track’s gospel-inspired imagery, “Wading in Dirty Water” is a 10-minute acid-blues workout that feels excerpted from an even longer piece—when the song fades in, it sounds as though the band have been riding its groove for hours already. Once they’ve proven they can out-choogle a Canned Heat cover band, they push the track into a more spectral space with a blast of discordant guitar. After erecting these two distinct poles, the Men spend the rest of Mercy bouncing between them. This is the first Men record to feature Chiericozzi singing lead on every song, easing the sense of whiplash between the finger-pickin’ outlaw yarn “Call the Dr.” and the adrenalized rave-up “Breeze” (which outfits the blatant Buzzcocks love of 2012’s “Open Your Heart” with a liberal quote of Golden Earring’s ’70s classic “Radar Love”). And while he’s always seemed like more of a sentimental traditionalist compared to his usual foil, Mark Perro, Chiericozzi pushes the Men to new extremes of simplicity and vulnerability on ballads like “Fallin’ Thru” and the title track, filling the open spaces in their skeletal piano and acoustic arrangements with his resonant rasp. But though the Men may be circling back to the roots/rager axis they orbited in the mid-2010s, they’re still punching into uncharted territory. Nothing in the band’s eclectic catalog can prepare you for “Children All Over the World,” a synthy fist-pumper that sounds like it should accompany the training montage in a Reagan-era sports flick. (Only a freakish, squealing guitar solo reminds you that this is a band recording for Sacred Bones in 2020 and not Chrysalis Records in 1985.) Yet even this garish anomaly betrays a certain consistency in transgressive spirit: If the Men’s earlier output showed how noisy garage-punk could be molded into accessible anthems, now they’re demonstrating how slick, ’80s-styled corporate rock can be repackaged as an underground DIY oddity.

Planet Swajjur,10k.Caash,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4c2165a7a4ee000800ba3e/1:1/w_160/Planet%20Swajjur_10k.Caash.jpg,2020-02-19 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10kcaash-planet-swajjur/,Def Jam,"In a recent profile of his hometown scene, the rapper Mel (of duo The Outfit, TX) describes Dallas as the Bay Area of Texas rap: Both regions are the weirder, more undersung counterparts of their respective states’ dominant hip-hop metropolises. The comparison with California offers a useful paradigm for thinking about the differing sounds of the Lone Star State’s first and third-largest cities. L.A. and Houston rappers have, historically speaking, made music for car speakers: Houston is laid-back and poured up, recorded with your Cadillac in mind. But in the Bay and Dallas, hip-hop is dance music—it’s made for the club. The so-called Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex pumps out more viral dance moves than oil barrels; the DFW is home to the Dougie, popularized by Lil Wil’s “My Dougie” before L.A.’s Cali Swag District taught the whole country how to do it, and the Stanky Legg, as made famous by GS Boyz. Though the area has produced superstars like Erykah Badu and regional legends like Dirty South Rydaz and Big Tuck, its biggest breakthroughs have been relatively short-lived. Dallas today offers an entire spectrum of styles: the strip-club trippiness of The Outfit, TX; the chart-ready soulfulness of Yella Beezy and Boosie affiliate Mo3; the made-for-the-mosh-pit bars of SPLURGE and Emotional Xan. But on a national scale, it’s still most influential as a source of novelty dances. The latest descendant of the Dougie is the Woah. After a boost from Lil Uzi Vert, the Woah was picked up by the likes of Drake and Travis Scott, but Dallas is making sure to take credit for its latest creation. Though its origins are contested, Def Jam signee 10k.Caash established himself as the authority on all things Woah with last year’s mixtape The Creator. As its cover art suggests, The Creator was largely educational in nature, staking 10k’s claim as the authentic originator of the Woah. Planet Swajjur (which takes its name from 10k’s intentional mispronunciation of the word “swagger”) attempts to prove that 10k.Caash is more than his most famous creation: not just a viral phenomenon, but a bona fide pop artist with a viable aesthetic universe of his own. Yet memes and other forms of online currency remain his stock in trade. His songs are bite-sized, accompanied on Spotify by looping cell-phone footage—mostly edited on the app Triller—of 10k and friends doing various dance moves. The project’s 10 tracks are designed with virality in mind: not much longer than your average TikTok, with repetitive basslines built for looping. Former Raider Klan affiliate and prolific beatsmith Ronny J lends his producer tag to songs like “Flip Flop” and “Hop Out,” but it’s hardly his most cutting-edge work. 10k’s beats often feel like they’re built from digital Lego bricks: loads of crunchy and compressed bass, colorful synth lines, and a few loops that sound like GarageBand presets. The Creator showcased co-signs from a menagerie of very online rappers—Rico Nasty, RiFF RAFF, Famous Dex, Lil Yachty, Matt Ox—but 10k.Caash is now using his newfound clout to raise the profiles of other emerging artists. In addition to Dallas comrades GUN40 and DSmooth66, Planet Swajjur features appearances from L.A.’s Sexton, Maryland’s TyFontaine, and upstate New York’s Young Jordan, as well as more established guests like Zoey Dollaz and fellow Texan TikTok star TisaKorean. It’s a lineup that’s as regionally diverse as it is stylistically varied, from Sexton’s half-sung, trilling raps to TyFontaine’s bright and exuberant choruses. But these contributions are so brief as to be rendered largely unmemorable. The only real heavyweight this time around is Chance the Rapper, with a guest verse on “Me And My Friends” that’s the hip-hop equivalent of a Cameo shout-out. In both sound and presentation, 10k’s most formative influence is Soulja Boy, the original internet rapper. DeAndre Way might still be considered a novelty by some, but there’s no denying the untouchable effect he’s had on the last decade of hip-hop: an early pioneer of FruityLoops and digital production, one of the first to figure out how to use social media to his advantage, and the original otaku rapper before everybody and their mother was name-dropping One Punch Man. Like his stylistic forefather, 10k has the signature trend, but he’s got a bit further to go if he wants to reach Soulja Boy levels of saturation. 10k has proved his musical planet is worth visiting; whether or not he’s more than the sum of his viral dance videos remains to be seen.","After a mixtape staking his claim to the Woah, a viral dance, the Dallas rapper looks to present himself as a bona fide pop artist with an aesthetic universe of his own.

Sea to Sea,Sign Libra,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e41b9d3af0b890008c9819d/1:1/w_160/Sea%20to%20Sea_Sign%20Libra.jpg,2020-02-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sign-libra-sea-to-sea/,Rvng Intl.,"Agata Melnikova is a dreamer. Back when she was putting together Closer to the Equator, her 2016 debut as Sign Libra, she longed to get out of her native Latvia and visit the tropical climates that inspired the music she was making. Lacking the money to travel, she found alternate sources of creative stimulus: BBC nature documentaries and rainforest sounds on YouTube. On Sea to Sea, Melnikova’s second album, her gaze drifts toward a destination that’s even more remote: the moon—specifically, its “seas.” Collectively known as the Lunar Maria, these volcanic plains have likely captivated people ever since primitive humans looked up at the night sky and first noticed those giant dark patches on the moon’s surface. A similar sense of wonder runs through Sea to Sea. Each of its nine tracks is named after a different lunar mare, and although we now know the moon to be a place that’s cold, gray, and devoid of life, Melnikova takes a more fantastical approach, evoking a time when people imagined that little green men were roaming around up there. Sign Libra’s music is bright and colorful, though she’s largely abandoned the woozy Balearic sounds of Closer to the Equator. Instead, she’s tapped into the same sort of dreamy, high-gloss new-age palette that artists like CFCF have successfully utilized in recent years. There’s a faint sense of ridiculousness inherent in Sea to Sea’s chintzy synth melodies, plucked strings, and faux woodwinds—even when they're channeling early Ryuichi Sakamoto—but Melnikova’s embrace of their campy overtones is clearly purposeful. In the video for lead single “Sea of Islands,” she charmingly mugs for the camera, intermittently playing her keyboard and gliding around a surreal, almost Dali-esque set with moves that are somewhere between performance art and ’60s dance crazes like the Swim. The clip for “Sea of Nectar” is even more absurd, as Melnikova, decked out in a beret and white gloves, goofily struts her way through a hypnagogic rave for one, occasionally joined by a disembodied saxophone player. There’s no guile and no cynicism, just a childlike whimsy that makes the music feel almost impossibly light on its feet. Adding to the otherworldliness is Melnikova’s voice, which is one of the album’s most compelling elements. Rarely using actual words, Melnikova mostly communicates in billowing melodies and shadowy whispers, although she’s not above the occasional burst of baritone or rhythmic nonsense. On “Sea of Islands,” snippets of her voice have been tweaked to sound almost guttural, resembling a didgeridoo or Tuvan throat singer. In contrast, on “Sea of Cleverness” she takes a soulful pop turn whose vocal melody is reminiscent, however coincidentally, of La Roux’s 2009 smash “In for the Kill,” as remixed by Skream. Overall, though, Melnikova’s presence is a soothing one. Whether she’s gently cooing (“Sea of Tranquility”), getting weird and witchy (“Sea of Serenity”) or spinning her voice into a multi-part devotional choir (“Sea of Fecundity”), there’s something alluring about her voice and its many manipulations. Comparisons to artists like Enya and Kate Bush are tempting, but Melnikova’s choices also recall the mischievous spirit of Grimes’ early work. That playfulness is ultimately what makes Sea to Sea such a rewarding listen. Although Melnikova certainly isn’t the first artist to revisit ’80s new age and globe-trotting postmodernism, she is one of the few who’s approached them with a genuine sense of humor. Sea to Sea isn’t a joke, but it has been made by someone who seems to realize that there’s a limit to just how serious someone can be while singing atop a spa-friendly suite of pan flutes and gauzy synths. There’s a lot of glee in this music, and Sign Libra seems more than willing to share it.

Fluids of Emotion,Eris Drew,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e45c6bd0ad70b00084a065e/1:1/w_160/Fluids%20of%20Emotion_Eris%20Drew.jpg,2020-02-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eris-drew-fluids-of-emotion/,Interdimensional Transmissions,"Sweat, saliva, tears—at peak time, the dancefloor brings all fluids to the fore. For Eris Drew, whose adolescence was soundtracked by the distinct mix of industrial, house, garage, and trance at mid-’90s Chicago raves, the scene behind the DJ booth is similarly visceral. As a primarily vinyl DJ, Drew leans into the physicality of mixing—dragging a record across the needle to scratch; pressing, with some force, to pitch-match tracks on the fly. Her ideal live setup involves decks stacked on top of cinder blocks. But for all her visceral performances, Drew speaks with effusive sensitivity about crying while mixing. To Drew, certain songs carry deep-seated traces of former lovers and past traumas. On Fluids of Emotion, the veteran DJ’s first solo EP, she confidently navigates that spectrum of sentiments, imbuing her tracks with a similar sense of wonder. In a world of high-fidelity dance parties and listening bars, Drew stands defiantly against audiophile puritanism. To her, raving is about pushing one’s body past its healthy breaking point—“Every soundsystem that I heard in Chicago was made to crack you open,” she’s remarked. That raw intensity is evident from the first snare hit on the titular opening track. Powered by a shuffling breakbeat so taut it sounds like it might snap, “Fluids of Emotion” carries the tactile qualities of live mixing—the drums might cut out entirely for a four-count, leaving a bouncing synthesizer to hang in the air playfully, before an exaggerated scratch brings the drum record back in. By reproducing the patterns of turntablism—scratching, doubling, pitch manipulation—in the controlled environment of a recording studio, small imperfections become intentional. The track’s vocal sample—a flat, alien-like voice that names various reasons for crying (“joy...pain”)—vacillates between emotional extremes, further distancing Drew from traditional hierarchies of taste and restraint. “Transcendental Access Point,” with its locomotive synths and snappy four-on-the-floor beat, initially plays things a bit closer to the vest. But then, just as the synthesizers begin to build to a crescendo, Drew removes the melody, and an extended spoken passage takes center stage. In a soft, even tone, ethnobotanist Kathleen Harris describes bearing witness to “a beautiful storm of harpsichord notes that were moving and dancing with an apparent individual and collective will.” We soon discover she’s under the influence of DMT; she tries the “pure substance” again in 1975, the year of Drew’s birth, nodding to the DJ’s belief in divine symbols and patterns. “You can choose to ignore the coincidences in your life, or you choose to let them give it meaning, kind of like dreams,” Drew has said, describing her almost devotional commitment to certain beliefs. Drew’s work is informed by an interwoven series of faith systems, some self-generated and others more widely known. Her concept of a divine feminine rhythm called The Motherbeat stands at the center of her work; for Drew, this LSD-induced realization came to represent the healing qualities of music more broadly. She also espouses Discordianism, a belief in chaos as the guiding force of society. These ideas coalesce on the EP’s only B-side track, the slow-burning “So Much Love to Give.” With soaring Orbital synths, a deep, diva-esque vocal, and a wooden beat that seems ready to collapse on itself, the track is at once spacious and precarious. In a vacuum, those heady dogmas might overshadow the understated elegance that Drew hones on Fluids of Emotion—seamlessly connecting genres like trance and jungle with a playfulness that speaks to her love for underground dance music and deep roots in the community. There’s no esoteric belief system required to appreciate a moment of unexpected brightness like the bird calls that close the album, evoking the euphoric exhaustion of leaving the club at dawn. Her aggressive style of mixing may alienate listeners accustomed to subtle fade-ins and precise beat-matching. But those comfortable with the sweaty, porous, chaotic nature of the rave will find moments of transcendence in its flaws.","The veteran DJ’s first solo EP confidently navigates a full spectrum of emotion, imbuing her tracks with a sense of wonder.

Changes,Justin Bieber,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e42edb3159e01000820c2a2/1:1/w_160/Changes_Justin%20Bieber.jpg,2020-02-18 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/justin-bieber-changes/,RBMGDef Jam,"At some point in the endless world tour supporting his 2015 album Purpose, Justin Bieber stared into a sea of fans and pleaded with them to quiet down. “When you guys are screaming... it’s hard for me,” he muttered, pacing in front of his own JumboTron double in the opening montage of his new promotional documentary Seasons. In 2017, he canceled the remaining 14 dates of his tour. His team cited “unforeseen circumstances,” and for a while, the Bieber machine fell eerily silent. Now, as it fires back up again, his management is busily filling in the blanks. In one episode of the docuseries, Bieber discusses the severity of his former drug use; he smoked weed for the first time at age 13, he tells us, and by the time he entered his 20s, he had progressed to pills and lean: “My security... were coming into the room at night to check my pulse,” he admits. He also discusses his struggles with anxiety and his diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease. “No one’s ever grown up in the history of humanity like Justin Bieber,” his manager Scooter Braun adds. At the center of this whirlwind lies Changes, his first album in four years. On it, Bieber returns to us a wiser man—the emphasis, here, strenuously, on “man.” As of 2018, he is happily married to Hailey Bieber, née Baldwin, model and daughter of Stephen. Bieber is newly sober, newly wed. Now is the time for stubbly beards stroked fondly, for wry smiles at the memories of youthful folly, for a sharp decline in public-urination incidents. But above all, now is time for sex. More precisely, for love-making, of the most grown-up and responsible variety—no giggling, constant eye contact. His fifth studio album is pitched as an invitation to bask in Bieber’s newfound domestic bliss, but while his contentment might be heaven for him and his managers, the resulting album has all the glow and eroticism of an airport terminal. Bieber recorded Changes mostly with his main writing collaborator Poo Bear and Josh Gudwin, his trusted producer and engineer. Without the animating presence of someone like Skrillex (who helmed six songs on 2015’s Purpose), Changes settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious. Its 16 songs (plus a remix) are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat. Married-sex songs can be some of the most provocative: see “Rocket” or “Partition” from Beyoncé’s self-titled album for a few minutes’ evidence. But the language here is off-putting and sanitized, and the music has none of the bright syncopation or rhythmic surprise of the Purpose singles. Nearly every song on Changes resembles every other in tempo, arrangement, and often in lyrics, which seem to be sourced from the same 10 or 15 pastel candy hearts. Some lines would be fascinating in their distance from human communication (“Let’s get it in expeditiously,” he proposes on “Come Around Me”) if they weren’t so dull (“Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin’ you/Standin’ ovation, they did a great job raisin’ you,” he bleats on “Intentions”). As that last line hints, there is a creepy patriarchal blankness to the devotion displayed here. In Seasons, Hailey is almost exclusively discussed in terms of what she provides for Justin: “She loves her man.... She’s so caring, so giving, so loyal,” says Braun. “If I could handpick a girl from the stars, it would be Hailey,” his manager Allison Kaye insists. That kind of anti-erotic ownership language permeates Changes and is never quite as pointedly apparent as when Bieber sings “Heart full of equity, you’re an asset” right after an ill-advised reference to “the kitchen” on “Intentions.” Now, Hailey and Justin have entered into marital communion—and they’d like you to know that they enter into it eagerly, and often. If Bieber whispering “You got that yummy yum” doesn’t make you want to dart away like a cat up a tree, maybe his ecstasy over “the way you motion, motion in my lap” will do it. Changes is a baby-making album if you find Lil Dicky ogling underage girls on Instagram and rapping, “I’ll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what’s up,” stimulating. It is a celebration of marriage if you consider “Do you wanna look at me forever?” an acceptable proposal. On “Habitual,” Bieber sings, “Flowers open when they feel the sunlight,” a sentiment which is really only a few degrees removed from The Handmaid’s Tale’s dystopian catchphrase, “Blessed be the fruit/May the Lord open.” In fairness, some of this language might result from the whittled-down phrasing, which seeks to emulate current pop/R&B trends. This truncated, staccato delivery generally suits outsized performers, who can fill a vacuum left by song structures with their personality, with their quirks, with their wit. Putting it mildly: personality, quirks, and wit are not Bieber’s strengths. He is a traditional entertainer, a people-pleaser who works best as the wholesome center of a wilder party. “Sorry,” his biggest-ever hit, placed a rowdy dancehall beat behind old-fashioned eight-bar melodies; the top line was as bright as it was sophisticated, and Bieber sounded at home. Lost in the midtempo grayscale of Changes, he suffers from a terminal wholesomeness that loops back around to unsettling. Scattered bright spots come from guests—on “Forever,” Post Malone injects his destabilizing energy, singing with the urgency of someone in dire need of a bathroom. Kehlani’s appearance on “Get Me” enlivens the muted, Noah “40” Shebib-type beat. Otherwise, the only appealing moments appear in the last third, when Bieber sings over minimal accompaniment. “That’s What Love Is” features nothing but an acoustic guitar, capo’d high and twinkling like a music box. The words redefine “sweet nothings” (“Don’t nobody else deserve my eyes,” he avows) but they dissolve in the sunlight of Bieber’s falsetto. The way he capers between chest and head voice is effortless and dazzling, like watching a figure skater land triple lutzes, one after the other. For exactly two minutes and forty-five seconds, the joy he takes in his talent is palpable.

NEVAEH,Mhysa,by: Ann-Derrick Gaillot,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e45c36b159e01000820c467/1:1/w_160/NEVAEH_MHYSA.jpg,2020-02-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mhysa-nevaeh/,Hyperdub,"When it comes to reinterpreting songs, how you sing matters just as much as what you’re singing. Louis Armstrong turned an apocalyptic dirge into a celebration of new life and a New Orleans jazz funeral standard with his recording of “When the Saints Go Marching In.” Whitney Houston transformed a limping nationalist anthem into a tear-jerking ballad of resilience with her 1991 performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at that year’s Super Bowl. Excavating new meanings from old work and stirring new emotions: This is the talent electronic artist Mhysa brings to her latest album, Nevaeh, as she plants seeds of R&B, pop, and spiritual hits and allows them to bloom over crashing beats, twinkling chimes, and playful synths. Mhysa is the musical alter ego of New York City-based conceptual and visual artist E. Jane. In her experimental club tracks, she channels the legacies of black women icons into visions of utopias. As she did on her 2017 debut fantasii, on Nevaeh Mhysa borrows sentiments from cultural greats like Lucille Clifton and Janet Jackson, translating and interpolating them with an ear for industrial sounds and unorthodox compositions. On the minimalist “breaker of chains,” Mhysa repurposes Lauryn Hill’s smoldering hooks from Nas’ 1996 track “If I Ruled the World,” her crisp, airy soprano infusing the declarations of world change with delicate hope. Accompanied by a quiet tambourine and a cavern of reverb, she replaces any suggestion of Nas—who allegedly abused singer Kelis, one of Mhysa’s inspirations, during their four-year marriage—with an expansive silence. She accomplishes a similar transformation in her own repeated renditions of “When the Saints Go Marching In,” breathing passion into every line. Throughout Nevaeh, Mhysa offers up the lone black woman’s voice as a conduit for an age-old dream of heaven, or the album’s title spelled backwards. For many, there’s no greater utopia than the crush and ecstasy of a dancefloor. And since Mhysa’s beginning in 2015, she’s proven she knows the way around a club banger. Despite that track record, Nevaeh includes just one all-out dance track, “Sanaa Lathan.” The song’s braided textures link it to the rest of the album, which is more ethereal. Instrumental track “Float” alternates sped-up and slowed-down samples that evoke the solemnity and resonance of a cathedral organ. Meanwhile, “sad slutty baby wants more for the world” features an R&B vocal sample that delays and dissolves on loop into a ghostly chorus approaching white noise. When Mhysa appears as a vocalist and lyricist, it’s with all rough edges exposed. Rather than masking vocal aberrations, Nevaeh’s lo-fi production and embrace of background sounds—like a door slam or a sharp inhale before speaking—highlight occasions when Mhysa’s gospel-rooted melismas go flat or stray from buttoned-up convention. Her unguarded presentation, along with the embrace of sexual desire in her lyrics, presents an unvarnished vulnerability often left out of the current bedroom pop umbrella. Softness and vulnerability, Mhysa reminds us, is not without its jolts, snags, and base desires. Hope and intimacy can be relayed through lo-fi production that flirts with the grittiness of field recordings. Though in rare moments on Nevaeh, that style approaches detachment rather than transportation, as on the meandering, minimalist ballad “bbygurl.” Similar to the gospel pioneers who channeled heavenly praise through devil’s music, Mhysa offers promises of peace and salvation via seemingly opposed aesthetics like manipulated found sounds and striking production. Though Nevaeh centers on the idea of an ideal destination, its focus on journey and transportation is what makes it captivating. By its closing songs, dreamy contentment gives way to urgency, as if heaven is drifting away. “I want to fucking believe, I want you to make it better,” Mhysa sings repeatedly on “BELIEVE Interlude,” gradually curling the plea into a challenge. On Nevaeh, Mhysa draws strength from creeping change, where most others would only find dread.

The Storm Sessions,Elkhorn,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e42e5f7159e01000820c29d/1:1/w_160/The%20Storm%20Sessions_Elkhorn.jpg,2020-02-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elkhorn-the-storm-sessions/,Beyond Beyond is Beyond,"Many inspired albums rise from the ashes of foiled life plans. Elkhorn’s sixth LP in five years is the rare example of the album that rose from the ashes of “plans tonight”: On the evening of an important gig opportunity, the instrumental duo of 12-string acoustic player Jesse Sheppard and electric guitarist Drew Gardner, along with collaborator Turner Williams Jr., found themselves snowed in and unable to make it to the venue. Rather than let their creative energy go to waste, the three set up shop in Gardner’s Harlem home studio, pressed record, and channeled the forces of weather into two side-length jams, hoping to salvage something. By the end of the night, they had The Storm Sessions. It’s important to know The Storm Sessions is an improvised album before hearing it—even coming from a band that’s always leaned heavily on improvisation. It contextualizes its shortcomings, and in a way, it’s the most Elkhorn thing Sheppard and Gardner could do (besides organizing an American primitive guitar festival in John Fahey’s hometown): going all-in on the possibilities of their raw steel-string chemistry to the point of publishing an unplanned session straight to wax. Both halves of the album, “Electric One” and “Electric Two,” run a little over 20 minutes and are divided into three parts each. They add up to a pair of space-out marathons that don’t wind as much as they loiter on the same chord and notes for several minutes at a time, like they’re waiting to pounce on prey that never really appears. Sheppard’s 12-string is the anchor; he wields his lowest strings like a giant staff, striking them sparingly and deliberately as if they could vibrate the earth beneath his feet. Gardner plays above and more freely, while Turner is the wildcard third wheel, adding jagged texture with his electric bouzouki and his shahi baaja, an electrified Indian zither. Their crescendos don’t always feel earned. The final surge of “Electric One (Part C),” for example, takes almost 20 minutes to set up, but the rise is awkward, like a live studio audience responding to the “applause” sign. When it lands, it lands well: Gardner and Turner’s crackling noise envelops them and flutters onto the tender ground of Sheppard’s acoustic like a thick, windless snowfall. It’s really nice; it just doesn’t justify the journey of a full LP side to get there. The predictability and sheer length of these routes mean The Storm Sessions works best for passive listening—not the kind of qualified compliment to which bands generally aspire, but one with plenty of value nonetheless. Hearing The Storm Sessions repeatedly bump up against these limitations might tempt you to throw on a different expeditionary steel-string album with the benefit of plotting and execution—like Jim O’Rourke’s Bad Timing, a masterclass in both building a scenic journey and setting trap doors. Or, for that matter, another Elkhorn record: Their double album from last year, Sun Cycle / Elk Jam, was their first to prominently feature drumming (with beautiful results), and there’s a surprising amount of contrast between those records and this one. There, Elkhorn hired someone to keep time; here, they’re less concerned. The Storm Sessions’ improvisation has the spirit of adventure, but the album winds up feeling stuck at home.

LP5,John Moreland,by: Jason P. Woodbury,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e459ca77fe1550008882b33/1:1/w_160/LP5_John%20Moreland.jpg,2020-02-18 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-moreland-lp5/,Old Omens,"John Moreland’s enormous voice never overshadows the small moments documented in his songs. In the past, his lyrical terrain—busted faith, regret, the losers in every fight—read as textbook “country,” earning him an opening spot for Jason Isbell and praise from Miranda Lambert. But the y’alternative marketing sometimes overpowered his increasingly experimental and genre-resistant songbook. On LP5, there’s no mistaking it, with its resulting mix of swamp-dunked soul, elevated AOR chords, thick grooves, multi-tracked vocals, drum machine clicks, and hovering ambient synths. Moreland’s heartland visions of devils, heretics, and existential discomfort were already kaleidoscopic; LP5 mutates his sound to match. Opener “Harder Dreams” starts by zooming as far out on the map as the screen will go, to a celestial kingdom where gods watch human drama on TV, placing bets on the outcomes of wars and other mortal complications. Moreland’s last album, 2017’s Big Bad Luv, released by British indie label 4AD, seemed to reflect the mood of a country disillusioned by its institutions. “Harder Dreams” picks up the conversation, forgoing any exposition about the state of the nation to cut directly to the disconnect. “What good’s a letter in a language you can’t read,” Moreland asks, baffled as to how to communicate across the vastness. It’s not the only time the gods, or just the Christian one, appear. Moreland was raised in the church, and though he doesn’t consider himself religious, the language of the faith you grew up in is hard to shake, and it dots these songs like little black circles. There’s a strain of Christianity that effectively teaches a person how to hate themselves, cementing a feeling of worthlessness and a distrust of your own body. Moreland recognizes its manifestation from a mile away: “You gave me a restlessness/Lives deep down in my soul/And a pretty good reason to keep right on being alone,” he sings on “Terrestrial.” Moreland’s no stranger to mining his woes for good songs, and that kind of pain and apostate self-hatred could fill an entire album. But recognizing the damage wrought by toxic theology is just his starting point. “As a child, I repented my nature,” Moreland sings. As an adult, he suggests we leave that kind of thinking behind. Is hell all we can imagine for others because it’s all we can imagine for ourselves? Moreland thinks we might be capable of telling a better, more helpful story. A few of Moreland’s best songs here grapple with the struggle to excise damnation from his personal lexicon. Over the the funky choogle of “A Thought Is Just a Passing Train,” he describes shame as a cancer. “Go easy on your heart,” he adds, following up that sentiment with “I’m Learning How to Tell Myself the Truth,” a composition about untangling infernal knots. It might not be possible to let go of the ache completely, Moreland admits on “When My Fever Breaks,” a gorgeous love song he began writing while dating visual artist Pearl Rachinsky, and finished years later, after their marriage. “But darling when you reach for me/It feels just like infinity,” Moreland sings, able to forgo his propensity for “howling at the universe” long enough to allow a moment of transcendence. Moreland’s songs have long dwelled in the contested middle ground between doing the right thing and not being able to figure out what the right thing is. On LP5, he articulates what it feels like to get it, however briefly, and let go. And he doesn’t always need words to do so. Near the end of the album sits a stirring instrumental, “For Ichiro,” an ode to outfielder Ichiro Suzuki. Though less than two minutes long, its bubbling synths and plinking piano—part Satie, part Japanese “environmental music,” part Joe Jackson “Steppin’ Out” sparkle—evoke the feeling of uplift. Moreland follows it with the record’s most overt country song, the acoustic guitar, harmonica, and organ reverie “Let Me Be Understood.” The song coasts on “For Ichiro”’s trade winds: “Friend I’ve been restless/I’ve been unwell/But I have a heartbeat and a trial to tell,” he sings. The mysteries of the “monumental yonder” will still be here tomorrow. Sometimes salvation means just staying alive and never giving up on those trying to do the same.

Chill Out,The KLF,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e42e82eaf0b890008c98345/1:1/w_160/Chill%20Out_The%20KLF.jpg,2020-02-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-klf-chill-out/,KLF Communications,"In 1959, a young composer named James Tenney enrolled at the University of Illinois, one of the few places in the United States where an aspiring iconoclast could study electronic music. The form was still in its infancy; oscillators and magnetic tape promised a doorway to new worlds. When Tenney sat down to compose with these unfamiliar materials, he was stymied. It wasn’t until 1961, in an act of sheer desperation, that Tenney started futzing around with a piece of music that was a world away from his classical upbringing: a recording of Elvis Presley’s “Blue Suede Shoes,” which had come out just five years before. He sped it up, slowed it down, cut it to ribbons. One “feverish” week later, he had completed a landmark work of appropriation art: “Collage #1,” an alien stew of chirps and gurgles in which Presley’s voice floats in dreamlike fragments, barely discernible. Decades later, in 1985, when John Oswald took the stage at a Toronto conference of electro-acoustic musicians to deliver a provocative lecture titled “Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative,” a tremor was shaking the music industry—the sustained aftershock of DJ Kool Herc’s invention of breakbeat DJing at Bronx block parties. As scratching and its digital cousin, sampling, had migrated from community rec centers to recording studios, it had become clear that copyright laws were ill-equipped to answer the question implicit in these new technologies: What if commercial recordings were not just products to be owned, but also the raw materials, anarchic and free, for new creative works? “A phonograph in the hands of a hip hop/scratch artist… becomes a musical instrument,” declared Oswald, who saw in the turntable and the sampler the birth of a new folk music. Oswald believed that creative sampling does not eclipse prior works; it builds upon them. He cited the English poet John Milton’s view that borrowing becomes plagiarism only if the object “is not bettered by the borrower,” and quoted Stravinsky’s oft-repeated epigram, “A good composer does not imitate; he steals.” Tenney’s “Collage #1,” Oswald said, was an example of that “better borrowing,” precisely for the way it expanded upon the original recording while preserving its essence: “Tenney took an everyday music and allowed us to hear it differently. At the same time, all that was inherently Elvis radically influenced our perception of Jim’s piece.” What was the point of copyright law in a world that could produce such profound results? Why police creation? Art, like people, yearned to be free, to go forth and multiply. Two years later, in 1987, as the sun came up over a remote Swedish field at the end of a long dirt road, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty watched—maybe ruefully, maybe gleefully—as a small bonfire turned the remaining copies of their debut album into a column of acrid smoke. It was not the last time the two would incinerate what they made. In 1994, flush with cash from becoming one of the best-selling bands in the UK, their band known as the KLF would set fire to £1 million—just torch it, hidden away in a deserted boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura, tossing bundle after bundle of £50 notes into the fireplace, until the suitcase they’d brought it in was empty. Episodes like that made the pair as famous for their hijinks as for the music they recorded—maybe more so. Today, they’re best known as the band that set fire to a small fortune, shortly after giving up music for good. But before they called it quits, in between the provocations, court injunctions, and unexpected hits, they snuck out Chill Out: a strange, idiosyncratic album that would alter the course of ambient music for decades to come—and prove that even their quietest, most cryptic statements could be as powerful as their most anarchic stunts. Formed on New Year’s Day, 1987, the KLF had quickly become one of the most audacious acts in British pop music. Before they became the KLF, they started out using a name they borrowed—something they would do a lot of in the coming years—from Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson’s The Illuminatus! Trilogy, a series of sci-fi novels about a group of shadowy agents of chaos: the Justified Ancients of Mummu, or the JAMs. Drummond and Cauty’s Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the misspelling was unintentional) released their first single, “All You Need Is Love,” just three months after forming. It began with an extensive, unauthorized excerpt of the Beatles’ song of the same name, then cut abruptly to the MC5’s infamous “Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!”—a sly reference to the Illuminatus! books. The rest of the song was similarly loaded with uncleared samples. “Touch me, touch me,” chirped Samantha Fox, best known to British audiences as a tabloid pin-up model; “Sexual intercourse/No known cure,” warned the actor John Hurt, whose voice had been lifted from newly implemented government AIDS-prevention PSAs. Its jagged scratching and anvil-drop guitars were a clumsy pastiche of Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys; it was, frankly, kind of a mess. Sounds magazine declared it “the first single to capture realistically the musical and social climate of 1987.” The DJs at the BBC refused to touch the single, but “All You Need Is Love” nevertheless attracted scads of attention, from the press and lawyers alike. A court ordered that all remaining copies of the record be destroyed; lucky for the JAMs, the single-sided pressing of 500 had already sold out. Undeterred, they rushed out their debut album, 1987 What the Fuck’s Going On?, which was similarly chock-a-block with pilfered sounds—bits from ABBA’s “Dancing Queen,” Dave Brubeck’s “Take Five,” Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti,” Sex Pistols’ “Anarchy in the U.K.,” etc.—over rudimentary hip-hop beats. They flaunted their stolen goods, making no attempt to hide the samples’ sources. (The title of the Dave Brubeck song: “Don’t Take Five (Take What You Want).”) That same year, underground rockers Negativland and the one-off dance-pop project M/A/R/R/S both put out career-defining records that shared with the KLF’s output one central tenet: It’s easier to ask forgiveness than get permission. Another court ordered that all remaining copies of 1987 What the Fuck’s Going On? be destroyed. This time it was an unlicensed ABBA sample that got Drummond and Cauty into trouble—which is how they found themselves in Stockholm, hoping to convince the Swedish superstars to reconsider their demand. After failing to get a meeting, the duo kept the letter of the law, dutifully if somewhat petulantly, and burned most of the records in that Swedish field; the rest they dumped overboard on the ferry ride home. Presumably, a mass of black wax discs lies there still, smoothed by the waves and covered in mollusks, a misshapen mile-marker on that North Sea whale-road, an underwater monument to artistic stubbornness. Drummond and Cauty went on like that for another year or so, releasing trouble-making records, taunting the industry, and nurturing a reputation for perpetual reinvention. In 1988, they killed off the JAMs and adopted various new aliases. As the Timelords, they stumbled into a No. 1 hit, “Doctorin’ the Tardis,” by shamelessly mashing up the Doctor Who theme song with glam-rock stomps from Sweet and Gary Glitter. A month later, they reached No. 5 with “What Time Is Love,” a sinister seven-minute techno anthem that marked their arrival to the nascent rave scene. The alias they used for that record was the KLF—a name rumored, though never confirmed, to stand for “Kopyright Liberation Front.” The musical thread that had defined the duo’s work up to this point was its abrasiveness. Yet in February 1990, they set aside the jarring edits and jagged rave stabs and released Chill Out: an unbroken 44-minute collage of synthesizer, steel guitar, railway noises, bleating sheep, found sounds, and samples—some half-buried, some plain as day—of Fleetwood Mac, jazz clarinetist Acker Bilk, and even James Tenney’s old muse, Elvis Presley. Chill Out offered a whole new way of thinking about ambient music. Brian Eno had codified the idea of ambient with his 1978 album Ambient 1: Music for Airports, and there was a long tradition of dreamy, psychedelic synthesizer music in bands like Tangerine Dream, but that stuff was the province of beard-stroking hippies, while the new-age-adjacent drones of Steve Roach and Robert Rich were found mainly in the cassette racks of crystal emporiums. After the explosion of rave, old-school ambient didn’t just belong to another generation; it might as well have come from a different planet. The canonical albums of ambient’s next generation, meanwhile—artists like Aphex Twin, Pete Namlook, and Global Communication—lay several years in the future. In a press release, the KLF announced Chill Out as the birth of a new subgenre: ambient house. At the time, its name sounded like a paradox: House music is about rhythm, movement, bodies in motion; ambient is amorphous, atmospheric, fundamentally disembodied. In fact, they said, the fusion was a natural response to the physiological and chemical stresses of rave culture, a format grown “out of spending 12 hours at a rave, dancing nonstop all night, and then needing something to ease back into the reality of Sunday morning.” As the first generation of ravers was still discovering the effects (and aftereffects) of watching the sun come up over muddy fields, the idea of music tailor-made to soothe fragile synapses was still a novel concept. In typical KLF fashion, it was hard to know to what extent they were actually serious about any of this; half the press release was unabashedly tongue-in-cheek, a none-too-subtle sendup of new-age woo (“Ambient house makes love with the wind and talks to the stars”). And then there were those sheep on the album’s cover art—inspired by the cow on the cover of Pink Floyd’s Atom Heart Mother, according to Drummond. The sleeve, he said, captured the feeling of daybreak in a grassy field full of sleepy-eyed ruminants; there was something deeply English and deeply rural about the whole raving phenomenon. The sheep, the KLF explained, represented  “spiritually highly-evolved creatures who are totally at one with their universe. If you doubt this, just gaze at the cover of Chill Out whilst listening to it and share the serenity.” Far from the gonzo antics and heavy-handed satire of the KLF’s early work, Chill Out is subtle, hypnotic, and mysterious, with nary a shred of smugness or snark. The baaing sheep might once have been purely farcical, but here their purpose is more ambiguous—a subliminally pastoral chorus barely perceptible within the overall mix. From Chill Out’s very opening moments, the listener descends into an unfamiliar swirl of sensations—by turns lulling, lyrical, and deeply unsettling—and doesn’t come up for air until nearly 45 minutes later. The album begins with the sounds of crickets and rushing water, then sinewave bleeps and a momentary snatch of Spanish-language radio, all run through a pleasantly disorienting wash of dub delay. The chorus of what will later be released as the KLF’s 1991 single “Justified and Ancient” floats dreamily through the mix and quickly dissipates, a fleeting (and cheekily meta) point of reference in a landscape where the compass needle mostly spins willy-nilly. After a minute, a freight train’s rumble rises and falls, followed by the liquid peal of pedal-steel guitar. Both are deeply coded sounds, inextricable from the idea of rural America, which seemed to fascinate the KLF as much as the pastures of their own country did. They provide crucial scene-setting for the album’s road-trip theme, which plays out in its sound effects and freeform radio-dial spin. The track titles, which loosely organize Chill Out’s continuous stream of music, reinforce the impression that this is an all-night drive along secondary highways: “Brownsville Turnaround on the Tex-Mex Border,” “Pulling Out of Ricardo and the Dusk Is Falling Fast,” and “Six Hours to Louisiana, Black Coffee Going Cold.” Beneath its tranquil surface, the album teems with activity. There are jangling cowbells, car engines, honking horns, the chop of what might be an outboard motor. Car doors slam, birds chirp, dogs bark, sirens wail. The principal through line, along with that pedal steel, is a handful of drawn-out synthesizer chords—otherworldly echoes of a high, lonesome train whistle. All these sounds glide by so swiftly and softly that you don’t realize how many discrete elements are in play; they proceed like a stream of down feathers gushing from a firehose. But it’s the voices that really bring this virtual world to life. A Long Island news announcer reports the death of a 17-year-old boy, killed in a drag-racing accident after finishing work at his father’s diner. A boisterous man, frequently identified by fans as one Dr. Williams, serves as a kind of Greek chorus, peppering track after track with gravelly running commentary: “Come get your mojo, hey! Go down to Atlantic City, come back fat as a rat!” Invoking the Christian broadcasts found all over the American airwaves, the KLF sample a jubilant pastor raving about Matthew 9. One wonders if Drummond and Cauty simply liked the sound of his evangelical bellow, or if they were also familiar with the contents of Matthew 9:36: “When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.” The interwoven pieces play out like a radio broadcast heard while half asleep, tapping into the same surreal aesthetic that David Lynch would explore in Twin Peaks’ debut just a few months later. Call it the American uncanny, in which familiar tropes are turned strange, and tantalizing snippets suggest hidden narratives—root systems of stories burrowing deep underground. Like the Swiss heritage of photographer Robert Frank, another eagle-eyed traveler of America’s backroads, the KLF’s foreignness gave them special purchase on American myths. It was all a product of the duo’s imagination; Drummond had never even been to the places they were evoking, and they only settled on the titles after recording. “We thought that it had the feeling of that sort of trip,” Drummond told X Magazine in 1991. “I love maps and atlases and I love place names, and I just sat down with the atlas and picked, you know, and saw the journey that it was and it all seemed to fit.” The KLF’s sensibilities might have softened since the days of “All You Need Is Love,” but their Plunderphonic instincts had not waned. A compendium of songs sampled by the KLF, posted in 1994 to the Trancentral listserv, cites Pink Floyd’s “On the Run” and “Echoes,” Brian Eno’s Ambient 4: On Land, Fleetwood Mac’s “Albatross,” and the Boy George group Jesus Loves You’s “After the Love Has Gone,” among other borrowings. (The fact that so much of their source material was British in origin only underscores the purely imaginary nature of their Deep South sojourn.) The shimmering overtones of Tuvan throat singing offer an eerie pre-echo of acid house’s TB-303. Peppy chamber music, the kind once encountered in all-night grocery stores, lends a whiff of air-freshened kitsch. The most unexpected detour, shortly before the end, is a mercilessly garbled edit of Eddie Van Halen’s pyrotechnic guitar solo from “Eruption”: a veritable tornado of pick slides and whammy bar that probably scared the hell out of the loved-up clubbers who had come to the album in search of nothing more than a landing pad after a long night out. For what was supposed to be an ambient house record, there was precious little house at all—just an E’d-up preview of their 1991 single “Last Train to Trancentral” in the pumping keyboards of “Trancentral Lost in My Mind,” and then, barely audible, amphetamine-laced hi-hats set against a drowsy clarinet in “A Melody From a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back.” Every time that melancholy refrain appears, I think of the scene from Terry Gilliam’s 1995 film 12 Monkeys where Bruce Willis’ time-traveling character encounters Fats Domino’s hit “Blueberry Hill” intermingled with a beach-resort ad on a car radio. Accidentally or otherwise, that scene distills the feeling of Chill Out: an overwhelming mix of sounds, voices, and emotions that seems to move simultaneously backward and forward in time. Even in the absence of beats, the album blurs the line between composition and DJ mix. Drummond and Cauty assembled it using two DAT players, a turntable, a couple of cassette decks, and a mixer; they started off by jamming out 20 minutes of synth pads and began building from there, bouncing from DAT to DAT, pulling variously from records and tapes as they went, sampling in real time. The final mix was recorded live, and followed a handful of aborted takes where they screwed something up just as they reached the end and had to start over. “It’s not just bits and pieces thrown in, every bit is exactly how we wanted it to be,” Drummond told i-D in 1990, shortly after the record’s release. But the recording session was nevertheless guided by a characteristically anarchic spirit. One morning, Drummond’s clock radio awakened him to the sound of Elvis Presley; he promptly ran out and bought the King’s greatest hits, which he and Cauty sampled that very day, working 1969’s “In the Ghetto” into “Elvis on the Radio, Steel Guitar in My Soul.” The genius of Plunderphonics reveals itself here. It’s perfectly easy to imagine Chill Out without the sample, but once you’ve heard it—the way Elvis’ voice intermingles with the chugging of the railway and the dubbed-out curlicues of pedal steel, perfectly in key—it’s impossible to un-hear it. It completes the album, becomes an essential part. The KLF’s slapstick early singles represented a kind of culture jamming—Negativland’s term—that used hip-hop’s techniques to lampoon pop music and, by extension, pop culture. Chill Out turned those same techniques toward different ends: gentler, stranger, more psychedelic—a nebulous fog in which the source material flickered like a lenticular image. Where the JAMs would have highlighted Elvis’ thrusting hips, his gaudy outfits, his drug use—all the things that made the King a garish, larger-than-life pop spectacle—Chill Out homes in on his voice, his pathos, the otherworldly quality that haunted his music. The KLF’s idea of chilling out isn’t a passive stupor—it’s a kind of heightened awareness, the clarity that comes from fixing one’s gaze on the center line as it bobs in the headlights, throwing up phantom shapes. It’s hard to overstate the impact of Chill Out. Ambient music has gone from being a niche concern to a widespread way of interacting with the world through sound, from sleep playlists to sound baths. And the idea of chill is even more widespread, though it’s a good bet that neither Drummond nor Cauty would be particularly enamored of its passivity, its packaging of mood as lifestyle. (A few years ago, Drummond said that the era of recorded music had itself worn out its welcome.) It is, of course, entirely possible that ambient house and techno would have happened without the KLF—the idea was in the air, and Cauty's onetime DJ partner Alex Patterson and his group the Orb would have taken up the torch. But the KLF set the tone for a particular fusion of texture, tone, and attitude. They may not have invented ambient house, but they channeled it, midwifed it, dowsed it: They felt something coursing through pop culture and brought it to the surface, gave it a name and a shape. Chill Out isn’t available on any streaming service (except YouTube), and you can’t purchase a download of it. The KLF took their album off the market, along with the rest of their back catalog, when they called it quits in 1992, yet another immolation of sorts. But it feels fitting that this definitive album from the most lawless of groups wouldn’t circulate within established channels. Whatever copyright law might have to say about it, Chill Out is an idea that can’t be stopped. Its essence lives on in artworks like this tribute mix—an element-for-element cover version, essentially, of the entire album, swapping in all-new samples that capture the mood and feel of the original pieces. It belongs to anyone who has ever stared at the vanishing point driving down an unfamiliar stretch of highway, the thrumming motor an accidental techno counterpart to Elvis’ voice as it comes warbling across the years and through the speakers, a shepherd leading his flock toward the dawn.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

The 24-year-old won’t be found crawling on his knees begging for his ex back, or making sugary love songs for lifestyle-advertising mood boards or direct-to-Netflix rom-coms. If you listen to the dreamy soul of his new album Fuck the World long enough, it starts to sound like a horror story. In his world, sex is a game and there are no consequences for anything. Faiyaz is at his best when he’s cold-hearted, like Future minus the bleak outlook. “Rehab (Winter in Paris)” is unsympathetic from the opening line: “I got too many hoes/But they ain’t you,” he sings warmly over neo-soul ready strings and finger snaps—so warmly, in fact, that you forget that he’s actually telling the girl he’s supposed to be in love with that he’s sleeping around. The stripped-down, self-produced “Fuck the World (Summer in London)” is similar, with countless bars that make him sound like a demon (“Your nigga caught us texting/You said ‘Baby don’t be mad you know how Brent is’”) or stand out for the wrong reasons (on the hook he calls himself a “walkin’ erection”). Both songs are minimal in their approach, but layered, with small tweaks—like his slowed vocals on “Fuck the World (Summer in London)”—that elevate it all. It’s worth noting that Brent Faiyaz is a savant at caption-worthy one-liners—“I’d probably be dead if I was basic,” “If you ain’t nasty don’t at me.” But there’s more to Fuck the World than Faiyaz’s ability to provide content for fit pics. He’s remarkably consistent as a songwriter; the weakest point over 10 songs is “Soon Az I Get Home (Interlude),” mostly because of its brevity. On “Let Me Know” he shows off his sweet (and under-used) falsetto, adding a coating of earnest gloom: “Who can I love when they tell me I can’t love myself?/How in the hell, could I possibly love someone else?” he croons. True to Fuck the World’s title, Faiyaz spends most of his time shrugging, and his looseness separates him from his more self-serious R&B peers. The ethereal “Clouded” is an exception. For a moment, he wonders about his legacy: “Is anybody gon’ remember me?/If I go tonight I doubt the world would change.” Then, the moment passes, and he instantly returns to his comfort zone: too much sex, destroying relationships that aren’t his, and breaking hearts without remorse.","The Maryland crooner’s dreamy R&B portrays a world where sex is a game and there are no consequences for anything.

And It’s Still Alright,Nathaniel Rateliff,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e4596210ad70b00084a05bc/1:1/w_160/And%20It%E2%80%99s%20Still%20Alright_Nathaniel%20Rateliff.jpg,2020-02-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nathaniel-rateliff-and-its-still-alright/,Stax,"It’s a tale as old as time: When a singer-songwriter wants to plumb the depths of his soul, he needs to step away from his main gig so he can get down to what’s real. Nathaniel Rateliff adheres to this weathered cliche with And It’s Still Alright, his first album without the Night Sweats since 2015 but not his first solo album, not by a long shot. The Night Sweats was his last-gasp attempt at the big time, a neo-soul combo that helped reposition the Denver troubadour as a soul man—a transition aided by producer Richard Swift, who became a friend and a trusted collaborator. Swift died unexpectedly in 2018, the same year Rateliff divorced his wife after a “tumultuous” relationship. The twin losses inspired the singer/songwriter to record the melancholy, meditative And It’s Still Alright, an album designed to be everything a Night Sweats record is not: intimate, confessional, bittersweet. Rateliff cut the album in part to fulfill a promise to Swift, who told the songwriter, “Keep pushing for those Harry Nilsson tunes, man”—to which Rateliff responded, “Well, we’ll see how Nilsson I can get.” The answer is, not very Nilsson at all, not even when Rateliff takes pains to stage his own Pandemonium Shadow Show—laboring to replicate the iconic songwriter’s whimsical melodies on “All or Nothing,” or giving “Expecting to Lose” a swaying sing-song bridge. In any case, evoking the ghost of Harry Nilsson is a particularly odd move from Rateliff, since Nilsson—one of pop’s great eccentrics, who recently received a boost when his “Gotta Get Up” was featured in Natasha Lyonne’s Netflix series Russian Doll— was never exactly a paragon of sincerity. Even at his quietest moments, Nilsson favored a bit of the old razzle-dazzle: His celebrated 1970 LP Nilsson Sings Newman doubles as an interpretive masterstroke and a display of studio wizardry, where he proved his vocal virtuosity by overdubbing every harmony part. If Rateliff is anything, it’s doggedly earnest. Whether he’s grinding out old-school soul with the Night Sweats or flying solo, he’s obsessed with the idea of authenticity: the idea that a song isn’t a song unless it can be convincingly played alone on an acoustic guitar. Ultimately, this old folkie notion of purity triumphs over Rateliff’s composerly aspirations. The lion’s share of And It’s Still Alright backslides to the gormless balladeering of his decade-old Rounder debut, In Memory of Loss—a record made when he was under the spell of M. Ward, peddling himself as “bi-curious, redneck indie-folk” and touring with Bon Iver. Set aside the Nilsson pastiche and a lingering echo of the Lumineers—most prominent on “Mavis,” which he stresses is not named after Mavis Staples, even though that’s the first Mavis that would come to most listeners’ minds—and Alright can seem like a collection of artifacts excavated from Rateliff’s early years. He strums and he mumbles, twisting in his melancholy without bothering to shape his mood into melodies. If he’s baring his soul, his revelations are buried within his slurred, mangled phrasing, a delivery that repels the close listen it’s intended to invite. That mush mouth is supposed to be the opposite of the retro R&B bluster that Rateliff hauls out for the Night Sweats, but the two extremes are really just different expressions of the same affectation. Rateliff bends his vocal attack to suit his chosen musical style. With the Night Sweats, he’s elevated with grit and muscle, but strumming solo on And’s Still Alright, he gets bogged down in a melancholy murk.

The Slow Rush,Tame Impala,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e41992daf0b890008c98164/1:1/w_160/The%20Slow%20Rush_Tame%20Impala.jpg,2020-02-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tame-impala-the-slow-rush/,InterscopeFiction,"For Kevin Parker, perfectionism is a lonely thing. The fastidious Tame Impala mastermind often copes with his self-isolation and doubt through stonerisms, highly portable mantras like “let it happen” and “yes I’m changing” and “gotta be above it” (said three times fast to ward off bad vibes). Their inverse is the negativity Parker’s trying to keep at bay in his head: “It feels like we only go backwards,” “But you’ll make the same old mistakes,” “You will never come close to how I feel.” It is easy to get lost in all the layers of groovy, time-traveling technicolor surround sound, particularly because Parker isn’t really trying to be clever or literary, but the internal tug of war within the Australian musician’s lyrics—between trying to better yourself and stay present, or succumbing to your own worst thoughts—is part of what keeps fans faithfully returning to Tame’s three albums, perhaps subconsciously. The repetition of phrases pairs well with the dubby, trance-like aspects of the music. Think of it as psychedelia for people with meditation apps and vape pens: Instead of opening your mind, you’re just trying to silence it. On Tame Impala’s fourth album, Parker addresses the eternal enemy of perfectionists everywhere: time. He struggled with it himself, considering The Slow Rush arrives five years after Currents, the album that made his one-man band more famous than he could’ve imagined. Parker has toured arenas, headlined mega-festivals, worked with Travis Scott and Kanye West, more or less ditched the skinny scarves, and had the rare honor of being covered by Rihanna (and making her dance like this). He intended to release The Slow Rush just before headlining Coachella last April, but he didn’t feel like it was ready yet. You could sense that flux in the album rollout: First single “Patience” hinted at a yacht-rock direction but ultimately didn’t make the cut; second single “Borderline” was trimmed and beefed up for the LP; and the whole thing was remastered following a November 2019 listening party, where he couldn’t stop noticing things he wanted to tweak. Given time, Parker will tinker. Clearly, all the tinkering paid off. The Slow Rush is an extraordinarily detailed opus whose influences reach into specific corners of the past six decades, from Philly soul and early prog to acid house, adult-contemporary R&B, and Late Registration. I have to marvel that all this sound and history comes from Parker alone, picking every string and twisting every knob. He’s always used strong melodies and riffs to anchor his more unconventional structures, but there seems to have been a slight shift in perspective: Working with hip-hop producers got him thinking more about samples—how they unite music of different eras and genres under one roof. But Parker, with his vast knowledge of tools and techniques, doesn’t need to sample—he creates the kind of music that other people like to sample. He can make his own instrumental loops that sound like Daryl Hall (the bittersweet keyboard in “On Track”), or Jimmy Page (the riff throughout the first part of “Posthumous Forgiveness”), or Quincy Jones (the “Ironside”-esque siren that lends panic in “It Might Be Time,” an ode to feeling washed). You might think you recognize the acoustic riff circling early-’70s soul-cruiser “Tomorrow’s Dust,” or the ascendant piano line in the ’90s-via-the-’70s R&B jam “Breathe Deeper,” but what you are most likely hearing is Parker’s gift for crafting classic parts. This “sampled but not” sensibility, along with Parker’s constant use of boom-bap-style drums, is one of the ways that Tame Impala makes rock music that feels in conversation with hip-hop. And while Parker employs more acoustic instrumentation here than on Currents, The Slow Rush is also shot through with the effortless pulse of house music—the kind of grooves that dare you not to dance. On the kinetic opener “One More Year,” the record’s initial beat sneaks up from behind a robot chorus with a tremolo effect and doesn’t let up until everyone’s had a chance to strut and pose through the bass and conga breakdowns, and Parker’s made his little coach’s speech (“We got a whole year! 52 weeks! Seven days each...”). This is a decidedly more upbeat Parker. There’s another person firmly in the frame with him now, an implied “we” as the newly wed Parker sees the next 50-ish years spread out in front of him—imagining kids, coming to terms with the choices he’s made, the whole bit. The Slow Rush seems to work from the present forward, maintaining the “fuck it, let’s do this” energy of “One More Year” with “Instant Destiny,” a swirling start-stop of a victory lap where he threatens to do something crazy, like buy a house in Miami. Almost immediately he regrets his impulses: “Gone a little far,” starts “Borderline,” with its mournful keyboards. Later, on a sentimental semi-ballad about keeping pace (“On Track”), he seems to wonder if that purchase is such a good idea: “Babe, can we afford this?” Parker toggles between positive and negative thoughts as usual, but at least he sounds like he’s genuinely having some fun. The worst you can say for The Slow Rush is that when you offer multipart epics on multipart epics, you’re bound to have some sections that feel less crucial by comparison. “Posthumous Forgiveness” and “Tomorrow’s Dust” both go on a passage or two longer than they should. The falsetto-led melody that opens early-album victory lap, “Instant Destiny,” feels incessant and cloistered until the song opens up a bit, thanks in part to a luxe xylophone break. “Lost in Yesterday” tries to edge up an aggressively beachy vibe with Daft Punk vocals and dub effects, and ends up feeling a little dated; then again, I could see it killing at all those big festivals the band will headline over the next few years. Parker may want to be a Max Martin type in another facet of his career, but in his own band, he’s still a sonic-maximalist introvert searching for inner peace. He seems to locate it in the quietest moments of the album’s show-stopping seven-minute closer, “One More Hour.” “As long as I can, as long as I can spend some time alone,” he sings atop steady piano chords, the barest he’s sounded all record (and still drowning in echo). Suddenly there are tense, fluttering strings and an apocalyptic, heavily phased guitar, then another gnarly riff, crashing drums, and Moog synths firing in all directions. The effect is something like multiple YouTube videos accidentally playing at once, a restless mind making gorgeous chaos—the work of a true perfectionist.

Ecstatic Science,yMusic,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e42e463af0b890008c98342/1:1/w_160/Ecstatic%20Science_yMusic.jpg,2020-02-14 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ymusic-ecstatic-science/,New Amsterdam,"The yMusic ensemble has a long track record of reaching out to new audiences for contemporary classical music, collaborating with pop stars like Paul Simon and playing pieces written by artists such as Son Lux. Yet the group’s appeal is not limited to its crossover cachet. The sextet—for string trio, flute, clarinet, and trumpet—has also shown excellent taste in collaborating with composers known primarily to classical specialists. They’re adept at playing to both sides of the aisle. On its debut album, the ensemble balanced work by Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent) with that of the New Amsterdam label co-founder Judd Greenstein. The follow-up included pieces by Sufjan Stevens as well as Andrew Norman (whose major work “Sustain” recently helped the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel pick up a Grammy). For its fourth full-length recording, the band’s contributor list is less pop-adjacent than it’s ever been, though it’s no less compelling for that fact. The 40-minute program begins and ends with pieces by the young composer Gabriella Smith—a smart programming move, as Smith’s pieces help define the album’s overall sense of serene locomotion. Her opener, “Tessellations,” boasts a jaunty percussive pattern tapped out on the cello during its early going. Subsequent, soaring lines for flutist and occasional singer Alex Sopp provide a feeling of liftoff. At other points, the trumpet and clarinet collaborate on nimble staccato patterns, creating a regal quality that also seems casually assured. At the piece’s close, the reappearance of the cello beat underlines the significant round-trip distance traveled, with a minimum of turbulence. That smooth-flight sensibility is a reliable constant on the album, even during pieces that have more dissonant harmonies, like Paul Wiancko’s richly textured “Thous&ths.” Ecstatic Science wasn’t entirely written by up-and-comers. Missy Mazzoli has broken ground with her upcoming Metropolitan Opera commission; she is also an expert with shorter forms. On this album, her title track suits the group’s expressive range of performance styles. After initially toggling between blitzing melody and languid droning, Mazzoli’s composition bridges these divergent states without any hint of rough edges. Perhaps the best known artist on this set is Caroline Shaw, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who has collaborated with Kanye West, but whose reputation has been primarily built on the basis of her own warmly experimental compositions. Her three-movement work “Draft of a High Rise” begins with hooky melodic fragments that feel as though they’re begging to be sung (perhaps by the vocal group Roomful of Teeth, which Shaw often works with). This gift for melody is rarely the only winning element of her music; surprising pivots of harmony and new rhythmic patterns keep coming with a steadiness that might throw unseasoned interpreters. Thankfully, yMusic know this terrain so well that their performances have an untroubled gait—one that reflects their commitment to making new-classical music accessible to varied audiences. Programs of music that are this fluidly engaging aren’t in much need of pop-world assistance.","A new-classical sextet known for pop-adjacent collaborations tackles a set of pieces that highlight its mission to convert new listeners to contemporary composition.

What’s Tonight to Eternity,Cindy Lee,by: Jack Denton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e45b3e37fe1550008882b3b/1:1/w_160/What%E2%80%99s%20Tonight%20to%20Eternity_Cindy%20Lee.jpg,2020-02-14 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cindy-lee-whats-tonight-to-eternity/,W.25THSuperior Viaduct,"Two-thirds of the way through What’s Tonight to Eternity, the stakes are laid plain. In a spoken-word sample of religious testimony, a woman describes finding herself abandoned by Jesus, stuck in a kind of purgatory where she can neither live nor die. Fed up, she resolves to reject Satan, even if that means being cast into the ether. “I would rather spend eternity in nothing,” she declares, “than to spend eternity with you.” On their fourth solo release as Cindy Lee in three years, Patrick Flegel sounds far more ambivalent. Equally seduced by shrieking noise and devotional beauty, What’s Tonight seesaws between joy and despair, body and spirit, heaven and hell. Many of its most infernal songs are also its most corporeal, grounded by throbbing baritone synths and bodily basslines. More optimistic tracks are either falling apart at the seams or sound as if a breeze might turn them into dust. It is a vision of two similarly unappealing choices: a physical world suffused with evil, and a spiritual escape that threatens to obliterate the self. Cindy Lee emerged from the ashes of the Calgary quartet Women, which at the end of the aughts put out two workmanlike albums of psych-friendly lo-fi that sailed on the prevailing winds blowing out of Georgia and Montreal. Flegel eventually picked up the gender play of Women's name and ran with it, with a new musical identity to match. “Ugh, I’m so bored of being a boy in a fuckin’ guitar band,” they’ve said about the birth of Cindy Lee, a project that sounds haunted by guitars, rather than built around them. “Last couple years it’s been just me, traditional drag-style.” Women sometimes flirted with oppositional elements, shimmering guitar melodies joined by feedback glare. But as Cindy Lee, Flegel has vastly expanded these countervailing palettes of divine harmony and clamorous decay. With their brother Andrew joining on drums, What’s Tonight delivers these sonic qualities with more precision and more instability than any Cindy Lee record yet, refusing to settle for the reductive conclusion of an easy extreme. What’s Tonight begins in Youth Lagoon-esque territory of lightly psychedelic whimsy, with blooping whale sounds over serene keyboards and a dash of smooth-jazz saxophone beamed straight from some 6-CD changer. Soon, though, the already decaying audio will be overwhelmed by shrieking static and aggressive squawks that, with an added beat, sound like they could go viral on TikTok—as if the placid recording studio were suddenly torn apart by a tornado. But, like Dorothy being whisked away to Oz, the storms that pepper the album lead somewhere fantastical. The epic “I Want You to Suffer” is a capsule of the album in song, with cherubic backing vocals that heel-turn into screams of trauma before ultimately dissolving into ecclesiastical organ. Another, non-biblical carpenter has provided salve and solidarity for many who feel excluded and abandoned by the powers that be. As Karen Tongson wrote in Why Karen Carpenter Matters, the “profound despair underlying an intense California sunniness” in Karen Carpenter’s music, and her personal struggle with the anorexia that eventually claimed her life, turned her into an unlikely icon for many people who might feel otherwise alienated by the mainstream culture she was supposed to personify. This includes Flegel, who cites her story, artistry, and the musical magic she conjures “in the negative space, out of exclusion” as an inspiration for Cindy Lee. The characteristic intimacy of Karen Carpenter’s voice is absent here, with Flegel’s earnest falsetto often rendered as a galactically distant echo. Instead, the singer’s presence is felt through other aesthetics often associated with her, like Richard Carpenter’s saccharine string arrangements and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals. Flegel has spoken about the way that performing in drag as Cindy Lee allows them to adopt a “diva fantasy,” and perhaps a protective costume of sorts is the key to surviving What’s Tonight’s hellish world. “Plastic raincoat,” they sing on the opening track, “protect me from rot.” But the retro fetishism here isn’t only limited to the cheerful. Cindy Lee also dabbles in the baroque horror-show affectations popular throughout the 1960s, with clomping harpsichord parts both baleful and strident. Though suspicious of pat closure, the album’s final third ultimately realizes a middle path between nothingness and the pain of the world. The ruminative electric piano on “Speaking From Above” sutures the song’s harsh distortion to its fleshy bass, finding a satisfied groove amid the ongoing discomforts of being alive. And “Heavy Metal” filters this internal conflict through a parodic costume of girl-group fadeout, reaching a tentative rapprochement between these many selves. All dolled up in the past, the sacred and sinister can coexist—for now.

Loom,Katie Gately,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e41b692a42e4e000882e488/1:1/w_160/Loom_Katie%20Gately.jpg,2020-02-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katie-gately-loom/,Houndstooth,"Katie Gately’s second album wasn’t supposed to sound like this. The Los Angeles artist had nearly finished an entirely different record, with a different working title, but after receiving the devastating news that her mother had been diagnosed with a rare form of terminal cancer, Gately left that album behind. For a while, she left her life in L.A. behind too, moving back to her family home in Brooklyn to help care for her mother. Wracked with grief and suffering from insomnia as she watched her mom slowly slip away, Gately began work on a new album, one centered around “Bracer,” a song that her mother had identified as a favorite. Gately’s mother passed away in 2018, and Loom was finished in the months that followed. It’s an album about death, loss, and saying goodbye; it’s also the finest thing that Gately has ever done. The new LP takes a dramatic turn away from Color, her impressive 2016 full-length debut for Tri Angle. That record was a ball of kinetic energy, a collection of brightly shaded, hyperactive pop flirtations that reflected her background as a sound designer. Rapidly cycling through various moods, samples, effects, and sound palettes, Color at times sounded like Gately doing her best to express 10 different ideas simultaneously, but there was something inviting about its mania. Loom is noticeably more focused, although it’s not without its twists and turns. Sound design still plays a major role; the LP features samples—many of them heavily manipulated—of earthquakes, screaming peacocks, howling wolves, a car crash, shaking pill bottles, a coffin closing, a shovel digging, and more. There’s even audio from her parents’ wedding. Gately’s compositional approach is just as idiosyncratic. “Bracer,” the album’s centerpiece, clocks in at more than 10 minutes and is something of a rollercoaster, opening with little more than her solemn voice and ending with a towering, grief-stricken crescendo of soaring synths and hammering percussion. Along the way, it also winds through a passage of what sounds like haunted carnival music and another movement that evokes the brooding piano lounge of bands like Black Heart Procession. This could make for a disjointed listen, but “Bracer” (like Loom in general) has the advantage of following a very specific vision. Where Color was fueled by a playfully experimental spirit—listening to the album, it’s easy to imagine her repeatedly asking, “What would happen if I tried this?""—Loom puts her personal narrative front and center. Her production chops and intense attention to detail are still there, but they’re no longer ends in themselves; instead, they act in service of both the music’s heavy emotional core and Gately’s vocals, which have become more prominent in the mix. It’s easy to draw comparisons between Gately and contemporaries like Zola Jesus and Holly Herndon, but on Loom her voice sounds a lot more like Kate Bush or PJ Harvey. She’s not a trained singer, but there’s a dark, bedazzling quality to her vocals; during the closing passage of “Waltz,” Gately almost seems to be channeling the famous “Song of the Witches” from Shakespeare’s Macbeth. A similar sort of necromancer vibe emanates from the swirling chorus of “Tower,” a pomp-filled song written from the perspective of her mother’s cancer medicine. Elsewhere, Gately’s voice takes on a reverent, almost religious timbre, most prominently on “Allay” and “Flow,” both of which weave her vocals into rich, soaring choirs. Sacred music was a familiar part of Gately’s upbringing. Her mother was a former nun, and though she’d left her calling (and religion in general) after meeting Gately’s father and growing disillusioned with the Catholic church, she nonetheless filled their household with Gregorian chants and other spiritual sounds. Some of that aesthetic has clearly seeped into Loom, which contains numerous nods to religion (and her mother’s former life). Interludes “Ritual,” “Rite,” and “Rest” form a sort of devotional triptych, while “Bracer” gets a bit more literal with refrains like, “Sin sin sin sin sin for the win” and “Take my sin and shove it into yours."" Gately has often commented on her struggles with depression and anxiety, but on Loom she sounds confident and self-assured. Her mother is all over the album, but Gately herself is the main character here, and the journey she takes is riveting. It’s her pain, her sorrow, and her memories—both good and bad—that fuel the record, and though the experience of her mother’s passing must have been harrowing, death does have a way of underlining what’s really important. Loom feels like the first time that Gateley’s technical prowess and songwriting are fully on the same page. The album may be rooted in loss, but Loom’s success lies in the clarity of vision that she has found.

Unlocked,Denzel CurryKenny Beats,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e418e89159e01000820c1e8/1:1/w_160/Unlocked_Denzel%20Curry_Kenny%20Beats.jpg,2020-02-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/denzel-curry-kenny-beats-unlocked/,Loma Vista,"Rappers love Kenny Beats. They can pull up to his L.A. studio, find a comfy spot in the room to roll up a little weed, and wait for the producer to make a beat perfectly tailored to their taste. In minutes, the Connecticut-born beatmaker will have their fantasies cooked up—maybe they’ll even get a comical social media post or their own episode of his YouTube series The Cave. After leaving the touring EDM duo LOUDPVCK, he immersed himself in hip-hop, and now his range is nearly limitless. Kenny can make hyphy Bay Area anthems for ALLBLACK; he can capture the headbanging punk-inspired rage of Rico Nasty; Sada Baby can hit his best gyrating two-step to one of his funky Detroit instrumentals; his West Coast beats are breezy enough for 03 Greedo’s hair to sway in the Cali wind. Kenny Beats can do it all. For Denzel Curry, blurring regional lines is the norm. As a teenager he was a member of Raider Klan, a South Florida-based rap clique obsessed with Memphis crunk and Houston screw. But even as he ventured outside of his area code, the throughline of his music has always been his Miami home. In 2019, Curry released ZUU, which used his city’s rich musical history as a foundation: beat breakdowns ready for an Uncle Luke night at a strip club, grimy Trick Daddy-influenced verses, and a guest spot from Rick Ross, rapping about cocaine. Unlocked is a curveball; for the first time he completely upends his roots, with the help of Kenny Beats. Unlocked sounds like a descendant of outer-borough New York City rap sometime between Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and EL-P’s Fantastic Damage. Over the course of the brief eight-track album, Curry’s appreciation for the era comes across as genuine. He retrofits his manic and messy Miami Gardens-bred rapping style into cadences that pay homage to unhinged hip-hop personalities like DMX and Ol’ Dirty Bastard. On “So.Incredible.pkg,” maybe the album’s best, he says, “It’s the man of the hour/Super confident and my clothes yell it louder,” not quite reaching the drunken chaos of the beloved ODB, but coming close. Curry’s energy is unpredictable enough to prevent the homage from feeling stale. Similar to early DMX, Curry’s gifted at causing mayhem while remaining fully in control. “Lay_Up.m4a” gradually builds to the disarray, delivered over a Kenny standout that’s grim enough for an after hours bus ride to the deepest corner of Queens. “Take_It_Back_v2” blends his slowed vocals with chipmunk-high ones, a refreshingly cartoonish track that fits alongside the short animated film released with the album. But for the most part, Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats are on different wavelengths. Where Curry is chaotic, Kenny is too neat. The producer approaches the intro to the project like he’s following a step-by-step guide titled “How to make a RZA beat”—the video clip sample is placed too cleanly and the beat drop is glossier than anything that would ever leave RZA’s mid-’90s basement studio.“‘Cosmic’.m4a” wants to capture the grime of New York’s former underground, but it’s smooth around the edges instead of sounding like it was made in the sewer. “So.Incredible.pkg” features sharp rapping by Curry, but the production is like an early Pro Era record without the feeling of teenage sincerity and discovery. Any excuse to hear Denzel rapping right now is a good one. But Unlocked feels like it was made out of convenience—like going to Chipotle instead of the corner Mexican spot because it’ll save you 20 minutes. It’s good, sure. Curry is rapping his ass off. But Kenny Beats’ production isn’t anything new. There are no imperfections, no colors outside of the lines, and with that, it misses some of the heart that makes regional rap special.","On his collaboration with Kenny Beats, the Miami rapper pays tribute to unbridled rap personas like DMX and ODB.

Meet the Woo Vol. 2,Pop Smoke,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3dec51a42e4e000882e43c/1:1/w_160/Meet%20the%20Woo%20Vol.%202_Pop%20Smoke.jpg,2020-02-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pop-smoke-meet-the-woo-vol-2/,Victor Victor WorldwideRepublic,"You couldn’t get far in Brooklyn last summer without hearing Pop Smoke’s “Welcome to the Party.” The Canarsie MC’s window-quaking single gave the borough a bonafide hit and signified the arrival of its burgeoning drill scene on the charts. Much of the excitement stemmed from Pop’s alpha-dog charisma, manifested in a voice that sounds like he gargles gravel every morning. His swagger has only grown since then; he’s already proclaimed himself the king of New York on record despite being a total unknown before last year. The 20-year-old has managed to back it all up thus far; he dropped a thrilling debut in July and its follow-up, Meet the Woo 2, provides more gritty drill music you can clench your jaw to. It all sort of sounds like “Party,” but it gets over on sheer maximalism like its predecessor did, with just enough deft touches to keep things exciting. A perfect example of this is the opener “Invincible,” a fierce slab of bravado over a teetering violin beat. With his gruff bark, Pop paints himself as a warrior à la 300, except he’s marching through a room full of unfamiliar dudes somewhere deep in Brooklyn. As with most of his work, the song contains a few shaky lines (“I’m feeling horny, and I shoot like Robert Horry” stands out here), but Pop’s lyrics aren’t built for close inspection; they work best hurling out of a big speaker system. He says as much himself on the following track, a collaboration with Migos frontman Quavo, when he threatens on the chorus, “How about I shake the room?” The song’s heavy beat, supplied by “Party” producer 808Melo, demonstrates the UK beatmaker’s sonic growth; a soft vocal sample and a swerving bass line fill space more subtly than the brazen bass hits of their breakthrough. The energy is more haunting and meditative than the the white-knuckle ride of Vol. 1. But it’s all centered around aggression, of course. On his verses, Pop usually can be heard asking some poor soul to take things outside or threatening more sinister acts of violence, like on “Christopher Walking,” when he declares that he’s going to “tie that boy up like a cowboy.” His grim boasts are usually delivered without wit, but Pop’s bluntness occasionally leads to slivers of humor, as on “Get Back,” where a judge snaps, “Why you actin’ like a dick?” at him. Meet the Woo 2 starts to slow on the back half, which is made up of more bare-bone instrumentals, as well as material that’s already been released, including, inexplicably, “Dior,” a single off Vol. 1. Pop’s voice holds more than enough weight to carry a track, but he operates at one breakneck speed, never adding much variance to his flow. Thus his songs typically need something—a melodic layer, a unique bassline—or they start to bleed together. That’s the case with songs like “Mannequin,” which is fabricated around a paper-thin sample and runs out of momentum midway through, and “Dreaming,” a song that’s almost entirely low end with no hint of a melody. Pop’s detractors on social media often point out how his songs sound too sparse or similar. But if they were to step outside in NYC, chances are they’d encounter a car nearly rattling its rims off with his music. That means the drums and bass will continue to sit high in the mix, his flow will remain militant. For the most part, the recipe still works brilliantly.","The rising Brooklyn rapper’s new mixtape gets over on sheer maximalism just like its predecessor, with enough deft touches to keep things exciting.

Honeymoon,Beach Bunny,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e419e38159e01000820c1ed/1:1/w_160/Honeymoon_Beach%20Bunny.jpg,2020-02-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beach-bunny-honeymoon/,Mom + Pop,"Beach Bunny’s Lili Trifilio wasn’t familiar with TikTok until after her song went viral on the video-sharing app last summer. The self-released “Prom Queen,” a protest of Euro-centric beauty standards, has soundtracked hundreds of thousands of TikToks, many of which feature a girl posing in front of a phone camera to illustrate Trifilio’s opening lines: “Shut up, count your calories/I never looked good in mom jeans.” Those lyrics distill the Beach Bunny formula: sentimental and wistful, with a plainspokenness that prompts immediate sympathy. TikTok is better known for surfacing meme-ready rap bangers than indie rock, but Trifilio’s heavyhearted charm struck a nerve. For almost two years, Trifilio was Beach Bunny’s only member. In 2017, eager to compete in a battle of the bands competition near her home in Chicago, she began putting together a group. On “Prom Queen” and its eponymous 2018 EP, she delivered teen-diary anecdotes in a bright voice that complimented the sticky hooks of her band’s twee-leaning pop-punk. With Beach Bunny’s debut LP, Honeymoon, Trifilio—now 23—levels up from Prom Queen’s wide-eyed stories of heartbreak, though the fears instilled by past romantic blunders continue to creep in. “You stay, you go, you say ‘I’m sorry’/I’m sorry too, for wanting you,” she hollers in “Colorblind.” “I’ll change the channel/I’ve seen this show before.” Trifilio cites Marina Diamandis as a songwriting inspiration, though Beach Bunny’s sound more often echoes the sun-kissed garage rock of Best Coast or the fired-up power-pop of Charly Bliss. While Prom Queen often luxuriated in grief and resisted the notion of moving on, Honeymoon’s most rewarding moments come when Trifilio swaps the insecurities for a newfound assurance: “If you’re gonna love me, make sure that you do it right,” goes the chorus of early single “Dream Boy.” “Cuffing Season” combines a therapy session and a pep talk as Trifilio’s narrator attempts to remain resolute in a case of “are we, or aren’t we?” At other times, Honeymoon’s lyricism can feel too slight: “She’s your girl, she’s in all your pictures/California girl, I wish I was her,” Trifilio laments in “Ms. California,” rehashing a tired trope of female jealousy. “But I’m confident when I’m with you… When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody,” she sings in closer “Cloud 9,” lines that feel superficial even as the insecurities they describe ring true. Thankfully, the rich, surfy melodies help to distract from the weak points. Like Crazy For You before it, Honeymoon isn’t especially singular or groundbreaking—but Beach Bunny’s raucous spirit means it never goes stale, either. Trifilio excels in straightforward, recognizable experiences of heartache, while still leaving space for listeners to attach their own nuance. Even as we get a little older, Honeymoon suggests, the adolescent anxieties of earlier Beach Bunny songs never fully wane; we just get a little better at handling them. As long as there are heartbreaks and insecurities, albums like this will have purpose. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of TikTok videos to feature Beach Bunny’s “Prom Queen.” It has been updated with the correct number.

soaring wayne phoenix story the earth,Wayne Phoenix,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e41b1b7ee3f2e0008bc8172/1:1/w_160/soaring_Wayne%20Phoenix.jpg,2020-02-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wayne-phoenix-soaring-wayne-phoenix-story-the-earth/,Halcyon Veil,"In the hushed monologues that fill Wayne Phoenix’s debut album, the pianist, composer, and producer describes his stormy inner life with halting half-thoughts. He “doesn’t know what it means to be secure.” He’s “been living without the earth beneath [him].” He rejects the grandiosity of romantic love; he mulls the nature of loneliness. He doesn’t expand much on the circumstances that inspired these ruminations—nor has he publicly offered much biographical information about himself—which lends the record a ghostly quality. It’s a bit like finding an old photo album with most of its pages torn out. Phoenix trusts you to fill in the empty spaces. soaring wayne phoenix story the earth is mostly muted and forlorn. Phoenix intones gravely at the start of the opening track “Mood” that he’s “singing the story of my life so far,” accompanied by washes of white noise, lapping electronics, and a vocal sample stretched and warped into an inhuman wail. Occasionally, he evokes the rain-slicked desperation of Leyland Kirby, and some of the synth work feels as cold and gleaming as those of his compatriots on Rabit’s Halcyon Veil label. But the way Phoenix treats his samples and sounds, swaddling them in blankets of hiss or warping them into unrecognizable forms, makes them feel personal and unique. Only three of the record’s nine tracks are longer than two minutes, which lends the record a flickering, quicksilver energy, as if Phoenix’s mind is working too quickly to stick to a single thought. You can hear this restlessness in his vocal passages, the way he gives up on sentences halfway through, grasping for the right ideas, then undercutting himself by fading the volume in moments where it seems like words might fail him. This energy is what separates soaring wayne phoenix from ambient music; for as much meditating as Phoenix does on this record, he rarely sits still. This approach allows Phoenix to try out more emotions than the overwhelming sadness of these compositions might suggest. While his spoken-word pieces often mirror the music, he also strikes notes of peace and hope. “Burn False Messages” opens with the assertion that he doesn’t “want to be anyone’s beloved,” but it closes with a reflection on the necessity of interdependence and the endurance of the human spirit. “Alone,” surprisingly, considers the happiness and sense of ease one can find in isolation. According to an account provided to Boomkat, this music spent 10 years “filed away in a drawer.” Whether this was meant literally or not, there’s something poetic about these pieces sitting forgotten for so long. They are full of the complicated wisdom that only reveals itself with time. It’s the sound of a person slowly figuring the world out for themselves.","Originally recorded a decade ago, these quiet, sometimes spoken-word sketches are full of the complicated wisdom that only comes with time.

Workaround,Beatrice Dillon,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3de8a4af0b890008c97f7d/1:1/w_160/Workaround_Beatrice%20Dillon.jpg,2020-02-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beatrice-dillon-workaround/,Pan,"Most producers in electronic music tend to work in a linear fashion: They start with a chosen style or set of ideas and move gradually forward with them, making incremental progress toward their larger vision. Not Beatrice Dillon. An unsuspecting listener presented with a half dozen of the London musician’s releases might easily assume they were the work of six different people. A 20-minute cassette with Germany’s Gunnar Wendel collected fragments of a noise performance; a pair of albums with composer Rupert Clervaux alternated percussive concision with freeform drift. Themed mixtapes—like a journey through Smithsonian Folkways’ archives or a guided tour of RVNG Intl.’s idiosyncratic catalog—comprise a surprising proportion of her discography. In the absence of anything like an identifiable sound, she has developed a singular sensibility: inquisitive, inventive, attuned to textural nuance and the power of a well-timed surprise. She may be everywhere and nowhere at once, but her catalog suggests its own hidden logic when taken together. Workaround, her debut album, doesn’t sound much like anything she has done before—which is to be expected—but it’s readily apparent that this is her most ambitious record yet. Putting her rhythmic instincts front and center without bowing to convention, she reconciles her fondness for dance music with the more esoteric tastes she developed working at London’s Sounds of the Universe, a record store with deep holdings in global rarities. Though the 14 tracks range in style and duration, from hypnotic club cuts to brief, abstracted etudes, they all share a palette of scratchy drum machine and glistening FM synths; virtually all are paced at roughly 150 beats per minute, so that they feel less like standalone compositions than variations upon a single, overarching theme. That uncommon tempo, pitched somewhere between techno and drum’n’bass, is an inspired choice. For one, it removes Dillon’s music from the workaday context of most contemporary dance music; the body registers the beats’ power, but the brain struggles to find a precedent. It’s also an unusually flexible tempo, conducive to both quick syncopations and laid-back, half-time grooves. Informed by dancehall reggae’s lurching cadence, her rhythms lunge and snap, complementing the synthesizers’ staccato attack. And even at such comparatively high speeds, the machine-tooled drums and electronics leave plenty of negative space. This all results in a marvelous paradox: Despite the music’s rigidity, it breathes like a living thing. Over this skeletal rhythmic framework, Dillon drapes a surprising array of sounds sourced from friends and collaborators: the liquid bounce of UK bhangra musician Kuljit Bhamra’s tabla; scraped strings from cellist Lucy Railton, who played on Mica Levi’s Jackie score; rainbow-streaked pedal steel from Jonny Lam, whose CV includes credits with Norah Jones and Pharaoh Sanders. On “Workaround Two,” Laurel Halo’s vocoder and synths intertwine with Verity Susman’s airy saxophone contrails; UK bass musicians Batu and Untold also turn up in the credits, along with Senegalese griot Kadialy Kouyaté. But the form these pieces take is more like collage than real-time collaboration: With the exception of “Workaround Two,” in which Dillon dictated exactly what she wanted from her players, most of her guests’ contributions were created around a pair of demo tracks that Dillon eventually scrapped, freeing her to edit, manipulate, and recontextualize their parts as she would any other sample. Those dueling processes—improvisation vs. cut-and-paste, real-time exchange vs. the infinite possibilities of digital editing—are the unspoken theme at the heart of Workaround: It’s a record about control. “The computer always wins, that was my phrase,” Dillon told The Guardian of her philosophy going into the record. The album’s noticeable lack of reverb, she pointed out, banishes any illusion of musicians jamming together in real time, in a single room. Instead, the album’s airless, clinical atmospheres intentionally suggest the pristine, brushed-metal gleam of a brand-new laptop, fresh from the box. At a time when so many dance musicians strive to emulate vintage sounds (whether by means of battered analog equipment or digital plugins that emulate effects like tube distortion and tape warble), the album’s unsentimental polish is all the more exciting. It’s that rarest of creatures in electronic music: something we haven’t actually heard before. Dillon cites the influence of visual artists Tomma Abts and Jorinde Voigt on the album’s interplay of shape and hue, an inspiration that can be detected in the music’s flattened, two-dimensional quality. Individual sounds like kora and standup bass become severed from their origins and reduced to abstractions—blocks of color, shapes on a page, forms being dragged about within the empty white rectangle of a computer screen. There, detached from the messiness of meatspace, Dillon can make the most of their contrasting textures: the graceful curl of the pedal steel set against the unerring linearity of digital drums; crisp, “Diwali”-like claps cushioned by dub-techno memory foam. Despite the nimble rhythms, there’s a prevailing sense of patience, even stasis. It’s a factor of the music’s repetitive nature, both within individual tracks and across the album as a whole. But that lulling serves a secret purpose, setting you up for a surprise when a particularly captivating sonic object comes rolling across the stereo field. There’s a four-note riff in “Workaround Two” that sounds like a cross between Japanese city pop and a smartphone ringtone, and the fact that it happens just once and disappears in the blink of an eye only makes it that much more riveting. Though Workaround’s second half is anchored by one of the album’s highlights—“Square Fifths,” a fractal waterfall of icy rave stabs over tabla and a groove that hints at dembow—that song is followed by a sequence of short, largely interchangeable percussion sketches that all sound like minor variations on the same basic idea. In another context, those might be taken for DJ tools—rhythmic loops for DJs to juggle to their hearts’ content. But even that nod to club functionalism seems appropriate for this curious and captivating record. In an album as intentional as this one is, the choice to include these passages is surely significant: they feel like pages torn from Dillon’s notebook, equations worked out in pursuit of electronic music’s version of a theory of everything.

Àdá Irin,Navy Blue,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3ddc1b20256b00096ba21a/1:1/w_160/A%CC%80da%CC%81%20Irin_Navy%20Blue.jpg,2020-02-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/navy-blue-ada-irin/,self-released,"Last December, rapper Navy Blue graced the stage for a rare live performance at a small venue in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Gripping the microphone, he paced the stage in snow white Stone Island sweats, rapping over tense, jazz-infused loops with his eyes shut, only opening them to glance over at his friends following along. By the end of his set, I couldn’t tell if he was holding back tears. It felt uncomfortable, like eavesdropping, but that discomfort is integral to Navy Blue’s music. Born Sage Elsesser, Navy Blue is a former skating phenom turned recording artist who began posting his music to Soundcloud in 2015 without disclosing his identity. This wound up being wise, since his earliest raps were raw, incomplete, and bordered on spoken-word. But through sporadic EPs, guest verses, and producing beats for frequent collaborators, he got to polish his style without the pressure of scrutiny from fans who knew him as their favorite skateboarder or style guru. Àdá Irin, the 23-year-old’s debut album, is the result of his earnest labors. It’s an honest and optimistic coming-of-age story about overcoming pain with the guidance of loved ones, and there’s a starry-eyed passion ingrained in every line, even the ones that are hard to interpret. Several track titles end in exclamation points (“Crash!” and “22!”), and his urgent need to communicate comes through even when his message is abstract. Compared to his older music, Àdá Irin is more straightforward; he’s less likely to use poetic language, which makes it special when he does: “Plummet in the earth, my body’s underneath/My papa in the wall, my worries in the creek,” he says on “Hari Kari.” Even when he’s baring his soul, Navy Blue remains elusive. “Trickle-down effect, my mother made a soldier/Shoulders ain’t for crying on, my brother know/Hold ’em close, privately we cope,” he murmurs on “Simultaneously Bleeding.” The snapshots are blurry but their intimacy is clear. Songs will often feature muffled drums and lyrics that stream past, but occasionally something piercing emerges from the fog: “Another face like mine on the news,” he says somberly on “Life’s Riddle,” freezing you in place. Most songs run under three minutes; if they were any longer they might have sounded like monologues over woozy loops. The exception, the self-produced “Hari Kari,” is a moment when he connects to his roots, as he blends a jazzy piano with funky percussion; it feels like a tribute to his father, who he describes in a 2017 interview as “a rastafarian drummer who’s initiated in Santeria.” Navy Blue strings a sense of fragile hope through the album, even as he grapples with feelings that would defeat most of us—pain, anxiety, fear. “22!” is the high-energy centerpiece, with rattling hi-hats and a pounding bass. His optimism shines through: “Bleed and I replenish/Demons on my Achilles/I give more than I am given,” he says, realizing that his pain has purpose. “To Give Praise!” ends the project like a fairytale. As the horns blare and a graceful melody settles in, he gives thanks to his family and friends, who guided him so he could grow and make an album like Àdá Irin. “If you got ’em both, you better check your mom and dad/Tell ’em that you love ’em, some would kill for what we have,” he states, breaking through the gloom. It feels like a hand on your shoulder.","The enigmatic rapper’s debut LP is an honest and optimistic coming-of-age story about overcoming pain with the guidance of loved ones.

No One Else Can Wear Your Crown,Oh Wonder,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e419759a42e4e000882e483/1:1/w_160/Crown_Oh%20Wonder.jpg,2020-02-12 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oh-wonder-no-one-else-can-wear-your-crown/,Island,"On the best-known song to feature Oh Wonder, you can barely hear them. The London duo lilt under the chorus of Lil Uzi Vert’s “The Way Life Goes,” a sample that morphs their original track “Landslide” from a hazy flicker into a surging, snaking beat. It’s a reminder of what’s missing in a lot of Oh Wonder’s own music. They engineer delicate vocal electro-pop tracks, sleeker than bedroom pop, with an earnestness that separates them from algorithmic chillwave. On their latest album, No One Else Can Wear Your Crown, their elegant, muted production seems destined to be background noise; the stray lyrics that do catch the attention can be treacly. Each song is a pleasant listen that dissolves forgettably into the next. This may be because the singers fail to translate their intentions. “Dust,” the album’s opener, is meant to represent “the state of the world and the craziness of capitalism,” the duo told Billboard. Instead, the lyrics sound like a hotboxed dorm room: “Don’t you think it’s kind of funny, the way we spin across the sun?” they sing. “We’re all made up of each other, from dust to dust to dust.” “Hallelujah” builds on yawning violins, ready to soundtrack Disney’s next princess movie: “There’s a crown, covered in glitter and gold/I’m going to wear it, whether you like it or not.” The cloying statements make you want to tune out, and the liquified pianos and fluttering drums don’t offer much interest, either. That spareness is intentional: These songs aren’t hollowed out, but purposefully small. “We will write a song on the piano, take it into the studio, and then layer it up with as many as 200 sounds, strip it back to maybe 10 and that’s the finished album,” band member Josephine Vander Gucht once said of their songwriting process. The impulse to pare down seems admirable, but the songs can be monotonous—tightly constructed loops of synth and kick drums, skeletal pulses that brace flurries of light instruments. The record swishes from track to track, building the kind of soundscape most often associated with coffeeshops or lo-fi beats playlists. When the synthetic strings do break through, they can overpower the dominating quiet: “I Wish I Never Met You” and “Happy” suffer from similar onslaughts of violin. The best moments of songwriting reach for nuance and maturity. “Happy” is a gauzy, piano-flecked ode to an ex’s new relationship: “It’s good to see you loved/Let’s call it even,” the duo coo. “Better Now” conjures concrete images to tell the story of a family member awaiting a difficult childbirth: a hospital vending machine, cups of cold coffee, the endless bleeps of machines. Oh Wonder’s musical project works when the simplicity of the writing matches the simplicity of the sound. When the former element tilts out of sync—gaudy, cliché lyrics about holding cards to chests and feeling “blindsided by love”—the record caves in on itself.","The London pop duo’s impulse to pare down seems admirable, but the songs can be monotonous.

i am gambling with my life,draag me,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3df04e0ad70b00084a004c/1:1/w_160/i%20am%20gambling%20with%20my%20life_draag%20me.jpg,2020-02-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/draag-me-i-am-gambling-with-my-life/,self-released,"As leader and guitarist of Spirit of the Beehive, Zack Schwartz constructs densely layered indie rock that teeters between throbbing distortion and uneasy calm. Listening to their last record, 2018’s Hypnic Jerks, can feel like free-falling down the rabbit hole, post-punk guitars shredding through tape loops. On i am gambling with my life, his first album under the name draag me, Schwartz doubles down on that genre-agnostic ethos, applying his chaotic DIY production style to chillwave, rap beats, club music, punk, and seemingly whatever else he wants. i am gambling with my life is functionally a solo album; Schwartz handled nearly every aspect of its creation—writing, recording, mixing, and mastering—on his own. Culled from dozens of drafts, the album was completed after he returned home from Spirit of the Beehive’s fall tour last year. The most noticeable fingerprint is a palpable sense of anxiety, one that permeates every groggy chord and Auto-Tuned performance with malaise. (There are appearances by other artists, such as Isaac Eiger of Strange Ranger and fellow Philadelphians Body Meat and Pedazo De Carne Con Ojo, but their voices are, for the most part, subsumed within the greater draag me universe.) Like Toro y Moi, another musical polyglot who has thrown himself into various styles over the course of his career, Schwartz is knowledgeable enough to know when to subvert different subgenre tropes and when to indulge in them, sometimes over the span of a single track. “there is a party where i’m going” starts out like a scuzzy ballad in the vein of Yung Lean affiliate Bladee before it gradually disintegrates, leaving only eerie synth drones in its wake. Songs like “the curve” and “form” flirt with house music and vaporwave while retaining similarly strung-out atmospheres. There’s a surprising amount of detail. Save for some scattered exceptions (like the closing “i want to go first,” which unfortunately devolves into ’80s pastiche), the album comes across as the handiwork of a deep listener, not the demo of a dilettante. Textures dance around the stereo field while guitars glitch and warble in unexpected ways. Such production tricks might be tougher to implement in a band setting, but devoid of any such constraints, Schwartz is free to flex his chameleonic prowess across these 19 bite-sized songs. Still, Schwartz’s voice can get lost in the haze, his words ghostly and indecipherable. But when the lyrics peek through, they reveal an insightful writer who’s writhing in self-reflection, observing his own internal battles and the way his inner conflicts are projected onto the world around him. He can be a gifted storyteller, too. On “lie,” probably the closest Schwartz comes to the sound of his primary band, he quietly ruminates on his role in a toxic relationship. “Paid for damages/You crashed our car into,” he mutters. “Both our lives are wrecked/I still lie for you.” While his artistic identity can be murky, Schwartz’s studio ability is undeniable. In an alternate universe, he could easily have been a reliable behind-the-scenes Los Angeles hitmaker turning out catchy bedroom pop and niche genre revivals. Instead, he’s a beloved figure in the Philadelphia indie scene, and as his solo debut makes clear, he’s got even more to give the world than Spirit of the Beehive has let on.","On his debut solo album under a new alias, Spirit of the Beehive’s Zack Schwartz runs with his band’s genre-agnostic ethos, applying his hyperactive style to chillwave, rap beats, punk, and more.

2017 – 2019,Against All Logic,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3dd93620256b00096ba218/1:1/w_160/2017%20%E2%80%93%202019_AAL.jpg,2020-02-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/against-all-logic-2017-2019/,Other People,"Under his Against All Logic alias, Nicolas Jaar writes music that sounds like it’s trying to break out of itself. Textures undulate and basses overwhelm, while vocals flutter in and out of focus as if someone were flicking through channels on a decrepit television. The project’s first LP, quietly released on his Other People label at the beginning of 2018, folded half a decade’s work into one of the most accessible albums of his career. Now that A.A.L. is a known quantity, Jaar returns with 2017 - 2019, trading the warmer house music of his debut for a warped techno counterpart. “Fantasy,” the opener, is all crunchy transients and harsh digital noise and—is that Beyoncé? Success has only further emboldened Jaar, who twists snippets of Bey’s classic Sean Paul collaboration “Baby Boy” into a hypnotic, mangled hook. But this sample is a red herring, as is the laidback gait of “If Loving You Is Wrong,” which follows. The classic soul flips that defined 2012 - 2017 are largely absent from that point on, replaced by frenetic clangs and extended, bristling percussion workouts like “With an Addict.” 2017 - 2019 has been rendered more purposefully than its predecessor, each track flowing into the next. It presents an identity for Against All Logic that transcends the previous mid-tempo crowd-pleasers, one that’s unafraid to draw from various club subgenres while injecting Jaar’s customary washed-out tape atmospheres. The harsh spirals of noise and pneumatic hi-hats of “Deeeeeeefers” sound like they’re pulled from a revised Justice cut or Thomas Bangalter edit, while “Penny” makes the case that “lo-fi house” might not be dead after all. The most exhilarating moment on the album appears courtesy of its sole feature, Lydia Lunch, whose voice and philosophy Jaar borrows for “If You Can’t Do It Good, Do It Hard.” A longtime advocate of her work—he reissued her 1990 spoken-word piece Conspiracy of Women (C.O.W.) after layering clips from the recording into his live show for years—Jaar recontextualizes the no-wave icon’s uncompromising ferocity using brash distortion loops that make Yeezus sound tame by comparison. “Because you can’t beat ’em, kill ’em/If you can’t kill ’em, fuck ’em/If you can’t fuck ’em, kill ’em/If you can’t do it good, do it hard,” Lunch snarls amid waves of mutilated feedback. It’s not the first time Jaar has remixed her, but “If You Can’t Do It Good, Do It Hard” turns what would otherwise be an intriguing experiment into a bona fide floor-filler. When the beat comes crashing down and Lunch’s manifesto echoes across a cacophonous explosion of drum machines, her brusque chant transforms into a menacing clarion call for the dancefloor. For the rest of the album, Jaar channels that same energy. The tracks pulsate with chaos and—on the introspective closer “You (forever)”—an occasional glimmer of hope.","Nicolas Jaar returns to his dancefloor alias, swapping out the mid-tempo crowd-pleasers for a set of surprisingly stern techno that bristles with distortion.

The Unraveling ,Drive-By Truckers,by: Chris Randle,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3add5dee3f2e0008bc7d77/1:1/w_160/THE%20UNRAVELING_Drive-By%20Truckers.jpg,2020-02-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drive-by-truckers-the-unraveling/,ATO,"Venturing north for his 1964 presidential campaign, Alabama demagogue George Wallace gleefully shocked the intellectuals and hippies by quoting Martin Luther King Jr.’s observation that Chicago was “the most segregated city in America.” The Drive-By Truckers abhor their home state’s former governor, but they do share his eye for contradiction. Their 2001 album Southern Rock Opera noted how Wallace ended his life of opportunism courting black voters, theatrically begging forgiveness: “Such is the duality of the Southern thing.” You can hear that duality in so much country music, where passion vies against duty in songs of strained devotion. Instead of reactionary fables, the Truckers have spent their career writing character studies, describing the serpentine routes Southern people cut through capitalism’s wreckage. The group’s previous record, American Band, arrived alongside the 2016 election, its subjects bluntly topical: “Ramon Casiano” told the story of a Texas teenager murdered in 1931, whose killer later became a border patrol cop and NRA lobbyist. The Unraveling turns political anxiety inwards. The mood of mounting disaster recalls 2008’s Brighter Than Creation’s Dark, perhaps the greatest Drive-By Truckers album—released just after guitarist Jason Isbell left the band, with bassist Shonna Tucker's 2011 departure leaving founding members Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley as the lone remaining songwriters. Aside from opening track “Rosemary with a Bible and a Gun,” which conveys a drifter’s flight with spiraling internal rhymes, there are no lingering portraits here. The new songs move like anguished monologues, probing for a source of horror, as if Hood and Cooley decided that narrative distance would amount to emotional abdication. The Unraveling takes meticulous care with each mix. From “Rosemary” onwards, the vocals sit a touch lower than usual. Distorted electric washboard blares through “Babies in Cages,” a consuming echo, as Hood writes ICE detention centers into the Book of Revelation: “Standing in the darkness to answer for our sins/Children changing each other’s diapers in a pen.” His first image in “Thoughts and Prayers” is equally unnerving—gruesome stillness hovers over a mass shooting, screens aglow with news of the violence surrounding them. Hood falters after that, mocking the bromides applied to mass murder; there’s a moment of catharsis, some deserved disdain, but he ends up landing halfway between satire and jeremiad, dependent on the same hollowed-out language he criticizes. A few disarming passages of The Unraveling reconsider the lyrical modes the Truckers have come to lean on. Mike Cooley was always the more conversational singer, an unhurried narrator; “Grievance Merchants” uses that style to expose the psyche of a far-right creep. Acid curdles Cooley’s wry voice as he mutters about “a conspiracy to water down his blood/And it’s all the fault of it, or them, or they.” The final track “Awaiting Resurrection” finds Hood overwhelmed by religious imagery, seeking some glimmer of illumination. He wonders whether he’ll get reincarnated as a dog, a bleak joke worthy of Leonard Cohen, the vaudeville penitent. Nearly nine minutes long, its empty spaces marked only by faint and shadowy instruments, “Awaiting Resurrection” bears little resemblance to the Southern rock that Drive-By Truckers long invoked. Heaven or hell, they each have their house bands—this could be the theme song for purgatory. Back in 2015, Patterson Hood published an essay in the New York Times Magazine expressing the disgust he felt after seeing people wave the Confederate flag at a Drive-By Truckers concert. He urged them all to burn the old rag: “It is time for the South to—dare I say it?—rise up and show our nation what a beautiful place our region is, and what more it could become.” Condescending northerners would always say that the South needed to become like the rest of the country. George Wallace shocked them again when the 1960s lurched rightwards, piling up votes in some of their own enclaves. You can find a constituency for white identity politics and its gothic resentments all across America. On Southern Rock Opera Hood imagined the Devil, “who is also a Southerner,” brewing up sweet tea for his new tenant George. The Unraveling has the despair of a wish granted hideously wrong.

Houses,Steve Spacek,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3ddecca42e4e000882e433/1:1/w_160/Houses_Steve%20Spacek.jpg,2020-02-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steve-spacek-houses/,Black Focus,"Steve Spacek’s career has never made many waves in the mainstream, but he’s a hero to the kind of music fan who worships Gilles Peterson and rare Japanese jazz records. In 2000 his band Spacek scored an underground hit with “Eve,” which was remixed by J Dilla and later sampled by the Roots, snagging the UK group an unlikely major-label deal. But their futuristic soul was too idiosyncratic to work in such a risk-averse setting, and the association was short-lived. Two decades on, Houses is a record you could imagine a major label might happily work with. A distant cousin of Spacek’s smoke-infused psychedelia, Houses is a painless, largely unfussy album in which Spacek returns to the house and techno of his youth. The album’s 13 tracks play out over the steady tick of 4/4 drums; you can hear the influence of deep-house pioneer Larry Heard in the airy chords and spidery bassline of “Waiting 4 You” and Detroit techno originator Kevin Saunderson in the mottled, gnarly riff of “Love 4 Nano.” Simplicity is baked into Houses’ production. Spacek recorded the album entirely on iPhone and iPad apps, and you can tell, for good and for bad. Bad because Houses at times feels oddly thin and underworked, more demo than finished article; and good because the album has an undemanding, even liberating, lightness that isn’t always present in Spacek’s more convoluted work. What sets Spacek apart from a legion of bedroom producers and their iPad presets is his distinctive voice, which occupies the glorious interzone between Marvin Gaye’s silky croon and Robert Wyatt’s troubled falsetto. Lead single “Rawl Aredo” features a Latin-accented house shuffle and keyboard stabs—a not overtly challenging blend that legions of budding producers have created then discarded as they get to grips with their machinery—which he marries to jazz-influenced chords and a gloriously carefree vocal, the kind of semi-scat scamper someone might croon as they cycle down a sunny street. The vocal hook of “Waiting 4 You,” which follows, is absolutely undemanding and entirely catchy, a “Wild Thing” for the bedroom deep-house set. This approach doesn’t always come off. “African Dream” sets a meandering, rather tuneless vocal against annoyingly stuttering production that even Spacek’s angelic tones can’t rescue, while the instrumental “Songlife” is far too flimsy, a collection of vaguely swinging electronic elements that have nowhere to go and no great hurry to go there. At times like these, you wish the album’s rare moments of eccentricity—the devilishly psychedelic ending to “Where We Go,” where the production sounds like it is being flushed down the drain—could have been more frequent. And that’s the problem: Houses feels unadventurous by design. With judicious editing, the record’s frustratingly almost-there mix of unfiltered inspiration and sketchy production might have made a great EP; with more work it could have led to a decent LP. As it is, Houses disappoints as often as it delights.

Countless Branches,Bill Fay,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3de632ee3f2e0008bc7f52/1:1/w_160/Countless%20Branches_Bill%20Fay.jpg,2020-02-11 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-fay-countless-branches/,Dead Oceans,"After his first two albums sold next to nothing and his music career sputtered out in the early 1970s, Bill Fay settled into what you might call a normal life. He worked as a groundskeeper for a London park, then as a fish packer in a supermarket, all the while raising his children. He never tried to launch a comeback, but he did keep writing and recording songs with a keyboard and a small 8-track. Between Tomorrow Tomorrow and Tomorrow, his unreleased studio album from the late ’70s, and Life Is People, his comeback album in 2012, Fay wrote hundreds if not thousands of spare hymns about the world around him and his place in it, with no other audience in mind beyond himself. “I’m thankful that side of my life has continued for all my life,” he told the New York Times recently, “finding songs in the corner of the room.” Countless Branches, his third album since being coaxed back into releasing music, hints at what those unreleased recordings might sound like. Compared to Life Is People and 2015’s Who Is the Sender?, both of which fleshed out his songs with folk-rock accompaniment, this album adds so little that when a simple timekeeping beat arrives on “Your Little Face,” it feels almost deafening. The palette recalls Nick Cave’s The Boatman’s Call, another album whose austerity makes the songs sound louder, their sentiments thornier, their melodies more elegant. Producer Joshua Henry, who brought Fay out of obscurity nearly 10 years ago, keeps the focus squarely on the singer-songwriter himself and his troubled relationship with the world. His time-tempered voice may have lost the accusatory power it had on 1971’s Time of Last Persecution, but it has gained a tenderness that imbues even the smallest moments with immense gravity. The spare palette also heightens the conflicts Fay addresses in his lyrics. They’re essentially the same ones he’s been singing about his entire life, at least on the songs that he has released: the individual versus the community, the draw of other people versus the need to escape in nature and solitude, and his own wavering faith in humanity. “Yeah, everyone knows it, it’s self-evident,” he sings on opener “In Human Hands,” “this world ain’t safe in human hands.” And when he’s overcome with awe on “Filled with Wonder Once Again,” it’s accompanied by the horror of “how this world sure can keep a man in chains.” The album is beautifully and judiciously arranged, but a collection of bonus tracks on the expanded edition show how Countless Branches might have sounded with more instruments and more people. The music is lovely and lush, but these band versions of “How Long, How Long” and “Love Will Remain” point more to Henry as a producer than to Fay as an artist. They’re a useful point of comparison, showing just how complex this album is, how tender and forgiving and wonderstruck. That quiet corner of the room affords him an inspiring view of the world.

Deep Listening,Pauline OliverosStuart DempsterPanaiotis,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3d93f020256b00096ba175/1:1/w_160/Deep%20Listening_Oliveros.jpg,2020-02-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pauline-oliveros-stuart-dempster-pan-deep-listening/,Important,"Listening is an inherently empathetic act, requiring receptivity to the intentions of others and the natural world. Composer Pauline Oliveros wrote frequently about what it means to listen throughout her career, which spanned over half a century and encompassed electronic works, compositions for magnetic tape, improvisation, and exercises in focus and reflection designed to deepen everyday engagement with sound. She considered sound not only to be the audible vibrations of the air around us, but the totality of many vibrational energies throughout the universe. To listen is to be aware of one’s self in that collective whole. Since her death in 2016, Oliveros’ ideas about what she called “Deep Listening” (which she described as “a practice that is intended to heighten and expand consciousness of sound in as many dimensions of awareness and attentional dynamics as humanly possible”) have become increasingly popular. In her 2019 book How To Do Nothing, Jenny Odell returns several times to Oliveros’ Deep Listening techniques as a salve to the increasingly chaotic flow of information in the Internet age. A 2016 article in The New Yorker brought her Sonic Meditations to a wide audience, saying they “make a timely case for listening as a form of activism.” Events have been staged throughout the country, from Houston to St. Paul to Washington, DC, celebrating her sonic legacy. The salience of Deep Listening resides in its contrast to mainstream culture’s riptide trajectory towards distraction and saturation, towards siloed media and political environments. It also stands in opposition to the numbing listening habits encouraged by streaming, which positions music as a utilitarian tool for productivity, something to be ignored while your concentration rests elsewhere. Oliveros provided a secular alternative to the increasingly commodified mindfulness movement that paradoxically co-opts the posturing of meditative practice in the service of productivity and capital. Deep Listening exists as its own end, without a pretense of functionality. Oliveros coined the term Deep Listening in 1989 to describe her collected improvisations with trombonist Stuart Dempster and vocalist Panaiotis, it would go on to become the name of the album released that same year on the under-appreciated avant-garde classical label New Albion. Important Records, which has spent nearly a decade producing impressive new editions of an array of Oliveros’ recordings, has collected the entirety of that seminal album in a new double LP, augmented by related material from a follow-up of sorts, 1991’s The Ready Made Boomerang, credited to the Deep Listening Band. The release is a remarkable realization of her ideas and demonstrates the sensitivity of the musicians to their physical environment, as well her profoundly expressive accordion playing and singing. Both Deep Listening and The Ready Made Boomerang were recorded in a massive underground cistern in Washington State that Dempster had discovered some years before. The space, which once held two million gallons of water, has a 45-second reverberation time, and the recordings are defined by a surreal smearing of tones. Like much of Oliveros’ and Dempster’s work around this time, most of these improvisations are focused around extended drones, with Dempster’s trombone and didjeridu providing the backbone. Far from evoking any sort of stasis, these tones swell and resonate actively throughout the space, and the effect is hallucinatory. Melodic lines intertwine as they ripple and decay, and momentarily raised voices seemingly emerge from within the insistent, omnipresent root. “The cistern space, in effect, is an instrument being played simultaneously by all three composers,” Oliveros stated in the album’s original liner notes. With the exception of “Nike,” which consists of the reverberant clang of metal on metal segueing into extemporaneous vocalizations and discordant trombone interjections, this collection is largely consonant, reveling in the resonances produced by the careful tuning of the instruments to just intonation. It would be inaccurate to describe music produced with such intensity as strictly pleasant, but there is a quality about it that feels centered and calming in a strange, otherworldly way. Pieces like “Lear” and “Ione” are meditative without falling into the trappings of new age music; instead, they enact core tenets of meditative practice—reflection, attentiveness, an openness to one’s surroundings—in a musical framework. Each musician is listening intently and reacting in kind not only to each other but to the space around them. The cistern stands in for the world, the entire universe, as they listen to its contours. In a contemporary context, Deep Listening still sounds revolutionary. While drone, minimalism, and ambient music have proliferated in the intervening decades, few albums in those fields are as rich texturally and harmonically or have such a clarity of vision. The album remains vital largely because it embodies Oliveros’ ideas, which have themselves resurfaced as a corrective to the sinister undercurrents of social and technological advancement. If art is a way to grapple with philosophical and societal hardships, Deep Listening may resound with just as much, if not more, clarity now than when it was created.

Yellow Tape,Key Glock,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3462810e7e92000921e054/1:1/w_160/keyglock_yellowtape.png,2020-02-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/key-glock-yellow-tape/,Paper Route EMPIRE,"Forged in the fires of South Memphis, Markeyvius Cathey (aka Key Glock) was brought up by his grandmother and great-grandmother; his father was mostly not around, and his mother spent much of his childhood in prison. “It has been times where she in jail and I’m not, I’m in jail and she not,” he once told The Fader with a candor that’s becoming his calling card. His latest mixtape, Yellow Tape, is a street-rap saga peppered with such trenchant insights, narrating the lonely world of a 22-year-old who has been through more bad times than any 22-year-old deserves. This chronicle begins with Key Glock’s birth. “I came in this world flexin’,” he says on opener “1997” before detailing his reckless existence in what he calls the “trenches.” Over the mournful piano keys and guitar riffs of “What Goes Around Comes Around,” Glock links life lessons from his elders to his dedication to rapping: “My granny told me what’s done in the dark must come to light/I recorded every night, now I got hella ice.” Detailing your come-up is pretty standard street-rap fare, but Glock’s rich use of language and slyly spiritual edge distinguish him. To be sure, Yellow Tape is a brutal record, lyrically and musically. You won’t find a viral hit or lame commercial compromise; there are zero guest rappers diluting Glock’s energy. Even “Amen,” the album’s most obvious reference to faith, finds Glock calling on God not for moral guidance, but to give thanks for his expensive chains, cars and the strength to turn the blocks where his enemies roam into “a morgue.” This autobiography has no sentimental moments. Production is mostly handled by a group of rising beatmakers who serve up moody instrumentals rippling with muscle. Sledgren’s horror-movie orchestration scores a drug-slinging tale on “Mr. Glock”; traditionalists will delight in hearing the young rapper reference old Snoop Dogg bars over BANDPLAY’s hard-hitting drums and swampy bassline on “Dough.” On “Crash,” Glock teams up with seasoned pro Southside, using vocal processing effects to render his voice dank and spectral. As a rapper, Glock’s accent is identifiably Memphis, if not quite the thick drawl of regional forefathers Three 6 Mafia. But like Juicy J, he can be a walking hook machine, coating every bar on songs like “Flyest Highest Coolest Smoothest” with swagger. Glock does have some growing up to do. It’s fair to say that there are occasions when his similes can sound off the shelf—there’s countless references to not letting a woman get between him and his money. But these are small grumbles in a grand scheme. A focused vision of what Glock is capable of, Yellow Tape is a work of wicked truths and unfiltered confidence, a book of genesis that feels like a post-mortem.","The Memphis rapper offers hard truths and effortless swagger on his uncompromising new mixtape.

Try Again,ovrkast.,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3d9757ee3f2e0008bc7e72/1:1/w_160/Try%20Again_ovrkast..jpg,2020-02-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ovrkast-try-again/,self-released,"The artist known as ovrkast. emerged seemingly out of nowhere last year with a producer credit on Earl Sweatshirt’s FEET OF CLAY. The Oakland-based producer’s sole contribution to the project, “EL TORO COMBO MEAL,” is a static-heavy slice of chopped-up sampledelia: rumbling drums, a scattered piano line, and cooing, soulful voices. Ovrkast. would probably be familiar only if you’d spent a lot of time digging on Bandcamp, as I’m sure Earl Sweatshirt has. He’s been posting beats there since at least 2016—jazzy and Nujabes-like in their sound, scavenged a capellas woven in and out, with track titles like “.08lamplites[recipe]” and “shouldaz[dust]” that recall of lo-fi beat mastermind Knxwldge’s method of stylizing song names. He’s kept a humble profile in the months since his professional debut, but ovrkast. makes his official introduction with the mixtape Try Again. Ovrkast. came onto the radar as a producer, but here he also expresses himself lyrically—he began writing bars even before he started making beats, according to a recent Twitter Q&A. His production has an ever-so-light jazz texture, and his rapping does too: not flashy, but bouncy and dense, with a slight monotone edge that demands extra attention to take stock of what he’s saying. There’s a track entitled “2 Minute Bars,” and hardly a song stretches beyond that length. Ovrkast.’s compositions are breakfast nooks, not big rooms—he fits a wealth of words into a small space without making it feel like too many words, not the easiest balance for any backpack-friendly rapper to strike. He doesn’t sound unconfident, but there is an almost intentional shyness to his delivery, a quiet moodiness or restraint, and his voice often comes at us through the sound of tape crackle. There’s a consistent tone across the album’s nine beats, and ovrkast. carefully curates his guest features too, surrounding himself with acclaimed and esoteric lyricists like Mavi and Pink Siifu. Try Again shows us an artist’s struggle to show himself—as his moniker suggests, ovrkast.’s persona remains cloudy and obscured. His identity-related dilemmas are most explicit on “Face,” featuring the Earl Sweatshirt-affiliated Navy Blue (aka professional skater Sage Elsesser), where his anguish forms the song’s chorus: “Everywhere, like I don’t know my place/I got people waitin’ on me/Still though, I can’t show my face.” At times, like on the tape’s title track, the mood approaches upbeat, but confidence and anxiety are two sides of the same coin—the drums soften and slow, and the song’s central call to “do it all over, try again” mutates from an affirmational mantra into a self-critical monologue, ovrkast. overwhelmed at the blank pages in front of him and the words waiting to be written. On “Interlude,” ovrkast. lets an audio clip of painter Kerry James Marshall talking about Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man outline the thesis of his tape. Marshall reflects on Ellison’s notion of the “simultaneity” of African American life, a kind of dually felt “presence and absence,” which inspired Marshall’s play with different values of black in his own work. Presence and absence offers a useful paradigm for approaching ovrkast.—we see inside his mind, but he still finds a way to keep his distance. Like Kerry James Marshall, ovrkast. is working with color temperature, crafting his sounds in grayscale. He writes bars that require unpacking, but even when rapping, ovrkast. thinks like a producer, as concerned with texture as he is with text. The shades he works in are primarily charcoal and silver, but the spectrum of cool feelings is rich.","The Earl Sweatshirt collaborator’s curated, understated mixtape fits a wealth of words into a small space.

All or Nothing,Shopping,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e31d9999cce1d0008d843da/1:1/w_160/allornothing_shopping.jpg,2020-02-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shopping-all-or-nothing/,Fat Cat,"The members of Shopping would be ideal candidates for fitness instructors. On their three albums to date, the U.K. disco-punk trio have proven themselves more than qualified for the job: Their music is all sweat and swagger, a breathless regimen of pulse-pounding rhythm and hectoring directives that both berate you into thinking you’re not doing enough while inspiring you to do better. And after subtly upgrading their scrappy sound on 2018’s The Official Body—and graduating from the DIY circuit to international festival stages—Shopping are more vigorously shaking up their program. But while the group’s fourth album, All of Nothing, bears all the surface sparkle and smooth contours of a brand new elliptical apparatus, the workout is every bit as demanding as before. Shopping have reached the same crossroads many of their post-punk forbears hit around the mid-’80s—i.e., the choice between wrapping their polemical discourse in more pop-friendly packaging to win over the masses, or resigning themselves to a life on the fringes spent preaching to the choir. All or Nothing attempts to have it both ways, amplifying and revelling in the perennial tension between escapist pleasure and anti-capitalist critique at the core of so much classic post-punk. The new record leans more heavily on synthesizers and drum pads than any previous Shopping album, but stops just shy of redefining them as a synth-pop band. After all, this group has always functioned as a pure musical democracy, its constituent parts—Andrew Milk’s piston-like drumming, Billy Easter’s deep, juddering bass, Rachel Aggs’ wonderfully squiggly guitar—locking together like a jigsaw puzzle, with no single component overwhelming the others. But the added textures invest the group’s invectives with heightened drama. When Aggs demands, “Why don’t you show some initiative?” on the prickly “Initiative,” she seems to implicate herself—so the group puts her words into action and redirects the song skyward on a synth-powered motorik thrust. A big reason why Shopping adapt so easily to their new surroundings is that they’ve never been an angry, confrontational sort of post-punk band. For all their wiry energy and staccato sloganeering, Shopping have always embraced pop melody and absurdist humor, and All or Nothing’s more polished production pushes those qualities to the fore: On “Follow Me,” Aggs combats surveillance culture by cheekily seducing a CCTV camera (“Follow me/I’ll make it worth it!”), while the consumerist blues of “For Your Pleasure” imagines an alternate ’80s where the B-52’s steered clear of the Love Shack. But even in the absence of electronic embellishments, Shopping remain a marvel of human technology: Layering no fewer than three different competing chorus lines atop its hand-clapped punk-funk beat, “Expert Advice” is both an emblem of information-overload culture and a model of spartan efficiency. And on the equally lean and propulsive “Body Clock,” the band approach peak intensity while addressing the sheer exhaustion of staying alive in 2020: “I need something to calm my nerves,” Aggs sings, “I’ve just got to keep up the pace.” It’s the sort of admission that suggests the onset of a panic attack, or a full-on nervous breakdown. But as the song’s incessant rhythm affirms, relief is just a dancefloor away.

Illuminations,Buffy Sainte-Marie,by: Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f16831eea270008127734/1:1/w_160/illuminations.jpg,2020-02-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/buffy-sainte-marie-illuminations/,Vanguard,"In 1977, on an episode of Sesame Street, Buffy Sainte-Marie became the first person to breastfeed on national broadcast television (“Lots of mothers feed their babies this way,” she explained to a very curious Big Bird.) She was the first person to record a song by a then-unknown songwriter named Joni Mitchell (“The Circle Game,” on Sainte-Marie’s 1967 album Fire & Fleet & Candlelight, released almost a year before Mitchell’s own debut). When she decided she’d rather record her 1992 album Coincidence and Likely Stories at home in serene Hawaii than travel to her producer’s studio in chaotic London, Sainte-Marie became the first person ever to make an album by sending files across what was then still being earnestly called “the World Wide Web.” Being one of the mainstream’s most visible indigenous entertainers in the 1960s and beyond, Buffy Sainte-Marie was the first Native woman to do quite a few things, among them win a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. She is presumably the only person to have written songs that have been covered by the unholy trinity of Elvis, Morrissey, and Courtney Love. And in 1969, when she unleashed her astounding, trailblazing sixth LP Illuminations, she became the first musician not only to release an album with vocals processed through a Buchla 100 synthesizer (the very same unit that the electronic music legend Morton Subotnik had used to compose his landmark 1967 album Silver Apples of the Moon), but the first person ever to make an album recorded using quadraphonic technology, an early precursor to surround-sound. Here is a brief pause, to let your brain try to catch up with Buffy Sainte-Marie. And yet, Sainte-Marie has always been suspicious of “firsts”—something about the word itself connotes a narrow-sighted narrative of conquest. She still dismisses hierarchies and what she derisively calls “pecking orders” as rigidly Euro-centric, reeking of colonial absurdity and woefully lacking in imagination. Over and over, she has learned that being ahead of one’s time can be a liability when one does not look the way a vanguard is “supposed to,” which is usually like a white man. “I was real early with electronics, and I just got used to this typical music-biz resistance,” she recalls in Andrea Warner’s 2018 book Buffy Sainte-Marie: The Authorized Biography. “Most of these boys—whether musicians or record company guys—did not want to seem old-fashioned or out of the loop. They didn’t want somebody else—a girl like me—to be ahead of them.” But she was. Illuminations is a potent artifact from those early days when the synthesizer conjured audible awe and limitless possibility. (Even Giorgio Moroder’s first Moog-driven hit, “Son of My Father,” was not released until 1972.) Illuminations would have been a tough sell in 1969 regardless, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that Sainte-Marie learned another factor in its commercial failure: Because of her activism with the recently formed American Indian Movement (AIM) and her outspoken Vietnam-era pacifism, the Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations had both led campaigns to blacklist her music from American radio stations and record stores. “Buffy thought that the decline of her record sales was just part of legitimate changes in American public taste,” her biographer Blair Stonechild wrote in 2012’s Buffy Sainte-Marie: It’s My Way. But years after the release of Illuminations, when an American radio DJ was interviewing Sainte-Marie, he shocked her by apologizing for abiding by a government mandate to stop spinning her tunes. She recalled, “He had a letter on White House stationery commending him for suppressing this music, which deserved to be suppressed.” As the years went by, Illuminations developed something of a cult following; in 1998, the experimental music magazine The Wire put it on a list of “100 Records That Set the World on Fire When Nobody Was Listening.” (“If Dylan going electric in 1965 would have turned folk purists into baying hyenas,” they wrote, “Buffy Sainte-Marie going electronic would have turned them into kill-hungry wolves.”) But, like Sainte-Marie herself, the bewitching, utterly transporting Illuminations has still not gotten a fraction of its due. It is a record overripe for reevaluation—for reasons not limited to but certainly including pissing off the ghost of Richard Nixon. From the Greenwich Village coffeehouses of the early 1960s up through her Polaris Prize-winning 2015 album Power in the Blood, Sainte-Marie has always moved through the world as though she can peer into a fourth dimension. In the 1960s, she drew equal inspiration from some of the world’s oldest instruments—one of her signature tools was the mouth bow, made from the bark of a chokecherry tree—and some of the most cutting-edge recording technology. Her early version of that Joni Mitchell song was a fitting personal anthem: Where others see straight lines, Buffy has always seen circles; connections instead of divisions. At the end of her book, Warner recalls a telling suggestion Sainte-Marie had made on an early draft of her manuscript: She’d crossed out the phrase “tearing down” and written in its place “creating—in spite of and beyond.” In the early years of her life, Sainte-Marie experienced much to work in spite of, much to travel beyond. She was born on a Cree reservation in Saskatchewan, though she’s not sure when, or under what circumstances she ended up in an adoption agency. She knows, at least, that she was born sometime in the early 1940s, and that the traumatic practice of ripping indigenous babies from their homes would continue to be common practice in Canada for decades; the phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “Sixties Scoop.” She was adopted by a white family in Wakefield, Massachusetts and given the name Beverley Sainte-Marie. Buffy had a creative and encouraging mother, but through the Sainte-Marie family she also came in contact with several male relatives, including her adoptive brother, who inflicted upon her years of sexual and emotional abuse. Her internal life became a place of refuge. “I wasn’t only some traumatized, scared little kid hiding under the bed—which I was—but I was also this other person who had an inner world that was really, really good,” she told Warner. She recalled her daily after-school routine, during the long Massachusetts winters: “I’d drop my books at home, grab my skates, go down the hill to the lake, and skate until dark, Tchaikovsky in my head… as well as Fats Domino, Little Richard, Jerry Lee, LaVern Baker, and Chuck Berry. I don’t know if anybody else was skating to ‘Maybelline’ in their heads, but I was.” Soon enough her own songs began to flood her head; “inner media,” she called them. She taught herself how to translate the melodies onto the piano; she twirled knobs and invented wild tunings on her guitar. She “[sang] her guts out,” like her cross-cultural heroines Édith Piaf and the flamenco artist Carmen Amaya, skeptics be damned (“If I’d been a flamenco performer or a chanteuse in Paris, maybe everybody would have understood. But it was quite unusual to sing with that kind of passion in the USA.”) She didn’t feel bold enough to play her compositions for other people until she went away to college, but at UMass Amherst in the early 1960s, she found a like-minded crew of young folkies. The future blues musician Taj Mahal liked to jam with her in the echoing stairwells, where they could play as loudly as they wanted, reveling in natural reverb. Her first album in 1964, It’s My Way!, remains one of the most revelatory debut albums of the 1960s, a decade with no shortage of them. It’s stark, clarion: Just a banshee voice and brutally strummed guitar emerging from some dark ether. Her sturdily crafted songs told tales of injustices that were years away from mainstream attention: The escalating conflict in Vietnam (“Universal Soldier”), the agony of opiate addiction (“Cod’ine”), the native lands and populations that were being displaced by corporate greed (“Now That the Buffalo’s Gone”). Her arrangements were relatively traditional, but in her subject matter, Buffy already seemed to possess a glowing portal into the future. The liner notes called her “an Indian Cassandra.” For much of the 1960s, she was indiscriminately lumped in with the luminaries of the folk scene—Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Bob Dylan—but even within the burgeoning counterculture, Sainte-Marie still felt like an outsider. Always had: Back in college she turned down every opportunity to join a sorority, and in Wakefield, she somehow “flunked” Girl Scouts. As a recording artist, though, the creatively restless Sainte-Marie was cutting her own way—through the mystical devotions of 1966’s Little Wheel, Spin and Spin to the playful country-western drag of 1968’s I’m Gonna Be A Country Girl Again. But by 1969, her “inner media” was crying out for stranger manifestations. In the late 1960s, what would eventually come to be known as “electronic music” was still, to most casual music listeners, a vaguely threatening abstraction. “The anxiety around automation became attached to the synthesizer in the mid-20th century,” Roshanak Kheshti writes in her recent 33 1/3 book on Wendy Carlos’ Switched-On Bach, an album that was enjoying unexpected chart success the same year that Buffy Sainte-Marie released Illuminations. “The Twilight Zone of a post-nuclear world seemed to be descending in the form of the synthesizer, an electrical instrument with the power to shift shape.” The old guard didn’t trust this impersonal, space-age version of the electricity in Elvis’ hips. Switched-On Bach was comprised of 12 well-known Bach pieces performed by Carlos on a Moog synthesizer—a playful yet meticulously executed meeting of past and future. The familiar respectability of Bach offered a plush welcome mat for those curious about this “Twilight Zone”-esque new instrument, and Switched-On Bach became a surprise hit, garnering three Grammys and breaking into the Top 10 on the Billboard album chart. As with any sudden commercial success, novelty copycats soon followed: Switched-On Rock; Switched on Nashville; Moog Plays the Beatles. Because it had the familiar feature of a black-and-white keyboard, the Moog was the most popular and musician-friendly of the early synthesizers. The Buchla, which would become Sainte-Marie’s instrument, was another beast entirely. “It wasn’t even as though there was an electric keyboard, it was too early,” she recalled. “We just called it a matrix, a bunch of possibilities you could connect in various ways to modify sound waves.” Subotnik and Don Buchla, who developed the Buchla 100 together in the mid-1960s, were less interested in futurizing recognizable instruments like the piano than they were giving people a blank slate to create new forms. “My basic thought was to be creative with this new instrument,” Subotnik said in a 2017 interview, “to show people how, without black and white keyboards, you could create a new kind of music.” Sainte-Marie—an artist who’d always seen beyond simple binaries—was enamored of this strange new machine. The Buchla announces its stirring presence in the opening seconds of Illuminations: Sainte-Marie’s voice is patched through and manipulated in such a way that it sounds like a reflection rippling in water. “God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot” takes all its lyrics from Leonard Cohen’s hallucinatory 1966 novel Beautiful Losers, and it unfurls like an increasingly impassioned rebuttal to Nietzsche’s most notorious claim. “Magic is alive,” Sainte-Marie sings with trembling resolve. “Though his death was pardoned, round and round the world, the heart would not believe.” It is a timeless parable of resilience and the necessity of wonder, placed within a modern frame: It’s easy to hear the connection between “magic” and the otherworldly electronic sounds itching at the foundation of this song. For an ostensibly forward-marching record, there’s quite a bit of ancient Biblical imagery on Illuminations: Song titles include “Adam,” “Mary,” and “Suffer the Little Children.” (The Smiths would, of course, write their own track bearing a similar title 15 years later, and Morrissey also covered a song from Illuminations on his most recent album, 2019’s California Son.) But this is one of those records that collapses the distance between seeming opposites. The mesmerizing aurora borealis of “The Vampire” and the shooting stars that streak across the coda of psych-rocker “Better to Find Out For Yourself” both depict the cosmos as something enduring and eternal, rather than just a lazy space-age motif. Where were the Magi looking for the Star of Bethlehem, if not on the astral plane? Again, Sainte-Marie is attuned to the interconnectedness of all things: Though they toggle from the Old Testament to New Weird America, the stellar sounds of Illuminations suggest that all these songs take place beneath the same sky. The pain depicted on this record, though, coexists peacefully with Sainte-Marie’s open-hearted pursuit of pleasure. Illuminations contains a few of the most assertively sensual songs she’s ever recorded, like the rollicking “With You, Honey” (“It’s about your potty mouth, and the way you stand”) and the blazing groove “He’s a Keeper of the Fire,” which ends with Sainte-Marie so overcome that she begins howling at the moon. Her music always has a fierce independent streak—her debut album, after all, was called It’s My Way!—but within it there is also the ever-present possibility of surrendering to love, to tenderness, or maybe just to fleeting satisfaction. Though it’s rare to find a Buffy Sainte-Marie song on which she’s not singing with wild abandon, Illuminations features some of the most moving vocal performances in her entire catalog. “The Dream Tree”—one of the few songs that does not seem to feature any sounds processed through the Buchla—is a kind of domestic sequel to “Universal Soldier,” an emotionally vivid portrait of wives left lonely and widowed by war. Beneath it all, a nervously finger-picked arpeggio moves like anxious hands knitting to keep themselves busy. The track on Illuminations that most frequently moves me to tears, though, is “The Angel.” The song is, quite literally, an ascension, with Sainte-Marie’s gravity-defying voice mimicking a soul’s heavenward release from its body. “Give up your treasured wounds, let go the temping memory of the pain,” she sings. “And you will live, and you will learn to fly again.” Like many albums lightyears ahead of their time, Illuminations was a commercial disaster when it was first released. “People were more in love with the Pocahontas-with-a-guitar image,” she once said when asked why she thought Illuminations failed to find a contemporary audience. She’d later learn about the American blacklist, the government suppression, and the reason why she continued to be better-known in other countries started to make sense. “They only have to hold you under water for about four minutes and you’re dead for a long time, when it comes to radio airplay,” she has said. “Things changed. But they didn’t change internally for me. I continued to record better and better songs, production-wise, I think. You just didn’t hear them in the States.” The ability to harness new technology, of course, is a mighty power. That Buffy Sainte-Marie was using synthesizers and quadraphonic sound to upend conventional narratives about North American colonialism only made her more terrifying to the status quo. Perhaps that is why she has continued to make her life’s work bringing computers and digital technology to indigenous communities, as she has done with her Cradleboard Teaching Project or her 1999 manifesto “Cyberskins.” Emerging technology, she writes, can “counterbalance past misinterpretations with positive realities, and past exploitations with future opportunities. The reality of the situation is that [indigenous people] are not all dead and stuffed in some museum with the dinosaurs: we are here in this digital age.” Fifty years ago, Illuminations was a declaration of that same life-affirming truth, and so it remains. It’s a portal to another world, as full of possibilities and alternative realities as that telephone-switchboard-like matrix into which Sainte-Marie plugged cord after cord. Lay down your cool cynicism, your rationality, your linear Western thinking, Illuminations instructs, before leaning close to whisper its secret: “Magic is alive.”","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Texas Sun EP,KhruangbinLeon Bridges,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3adad60ad70b000849fbcf/1:1/w_160/Texas%20Sun_Khruangbin_Bridges.jpg,2020-02-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khruangbin-leon-bridges-texas-sun-ep/,Dead OceansColumbiaNight Time Stories Ltd.,"From their respective metropolises, Khruangbin and Leon Bridges offer fascinating variations on the notion of “Texas music.” The Fort Worth-based Bridges explores a strain of soul that is more closely associated with Mississippi and Chicago than the Lone Star State, while Houston trio Khruangbin dabbles in a strain of globally minded, stoner-friendly psychedelia that authorities didn’t always look upon so kindly. Today, both artists find themselves rising stars, garnering millions of streams and promoting the vision of a more diverse and open-minded Texas, the one that leads to headlines like this. The two teamed up for a joint North American tour in 2018, but heading into the studio together wasn’t an obvious next step. Their partnership might pay dividends down the road, but at four songs in 20 minutes, Texas Sun is both tantalizing and a little half-baked. The title track gives a glimpse of how each party might bolster the other: Khruangbin bassist Laura Lee, guitarist Mark Speer, and drummer Donald Johnson impart some much-needed looseness and pliancy to Bridges’ vocals, while the singer in turn grounds their wandering with song structures and sturdy vocals. “Texas Sun” is a simmering road-trip number, with Bridges’ delivery rendering that oppressive sun into something more mellow. Khruangbin provides a head-nodding beat, but for all of their synergy, the result still resembles boilerplate Bob Seger. The slinky “Midnight” could have been cribbed from a Numero Group Eccentric Soul compilation. Bridges’ lyrics again situate us in a moving vehicle, this time at night instead of the sweltering midday heat. They conjure a wistful mood, with lyrics that detail a new love in the passenger seat, cruising around with no particular destination in mind, smoking with the windows down, the backseat beckoning from the rearview mirror. “Put on your lavender/Perfume and a nice dress,” Bridges croons sweetly. “C-Side” boasts the sultriest groove, with Lee’s loping bassline riding behind a clopping cowbell and mallet percussion. But Bridges’ chorus is diffuse and unmemorable, and the percolating beat lingers in the mind for longer than the words. The smoky minor-key ballad “Conversion” (which has its roots in the gospel hymn “At the Cross”) showcases Bridges’ honeyed, unhurried delivery at its most effective. If anything, the four songs leave you wanting more from this collaboration, offering up brief, blurry glimpses of their Texas landscape rather than the expansive vistas that they might arrive at should they ride together a little longer.

"Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974",Bryan Ferry,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e31d7497f4bab000806e11f/1:1/w_160/bryanferry_live.jpg,2020-02-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bryan-ferry-live-at-the-royal-albert-hall-1974/,BMG,"To be Bryan Ferry in 1974 was like being Bob Dylan in 1965, Clark Gable in 1939, and Oscar Wilde in 1895. He commanded his space, he bulldozed the rickety fence between sincerity and irony for a generation of acolytes, and his hair was fabulous. Running a parallel solo career while singer-songwriter-keyboardist for Roxy Music, Ferry released six albums in just two years. This solo live performance, recorded weeks after the release of Roxy’s fourth album Country Life and six months after his second covers collection Another Time, Another Place, captures Ferry and backing band in top form. No audible laryngitis here—Ferry’s vocal attack shakes the rafters. Expect improvisation and Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974 will disappoint. Novelty, though, it’s got—Ferry sounded like no singer in rock. Leading the album with his cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil” works as manifesto and adrenaline pumper. On 1973’s These Foolish Things, the song was fit for a Las Vegas floor show, stuffed with frantic brass and fruity backup vocals; the performance is a dissertation on finding the Mel Tormé in Mick Jagger. The Royal Albert Hall version applies a gutbucket rock approach, thanks to bassist John Wetton and drummer Paul Thompson. Always the art student, Ferry reveled in the contrast: the white tuxedo-clad dandy arching languorous quotation marks around the devil’s music. Yet he cared too. Over Eddie Jobson’s watery Fender Rhodes—one of the few concessions to the times—Ferry unleashes his most empathetic high notes on the first third of Another Time, Another Place’s self-written title track: a valentine to the records he grew up loving and whose rebellious spirit he’d honor by rewiring them. But Ferry also possessed an actor’s instinct for understatement. Girl group and Motown hits moved him as much as the rock numbers. Although the live takes on the Paris Sisters’ “I Love How You Love Me” and Smokey Robinson’s “The Tracks of My Tears” don’t differ much from his studio ones, their professions of vulnerability aren’t what audiences expected from white male rock singers. Most impressive is his insistence on keeping the feminine pronouns intact on Lesley Gore’s “It’s My Party”; David Bowie may have proclaimed the Church of Man-Love a holy place to be, but Ferry’s identification with the desires of young women went beyond queerness into symbiosis; for the length of a 45 rpm single, Ferry and those female characters share a commonality. Concluding with the title track of his first solo album, an English standard from the 1930s, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974 captures an artist reclaiming an earlier era’s detritus as his own. Ferry opened his mouth and dozens of heirs spilled out, few with his knowledge of R&B and fewer with the wisdom to posit themselves as the essential secondhand man: a conduit for a generation’s teenage pop dreams. He revolutionized the pop song by remaking/remodeling it as Pop Art: a readymade comprised of avant-garde electronic stylings, effects-laden guitars, mournful oboes, and lyrics that embraced romantic obsession by mocking it. So much labor because he believed obsession deserves cool appraisal, too. Singing about foolish things meant he believed in them.","With cover songs and a couple of originals, this solo live performance captures the prolific Roxy Music leader in top form: the weirdo conduit for a generation’s teenage pop dreams.

We’re New Again: A Reimagining by Makaya McCraven,Gil Scott-HeronMakaya McCraven,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7c1e59eef880008cd1277/1:1/w_160/Gil-Scott-Heron.jpg,2020-02-07 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gil-scott-heron-makaya-mccraven-were-new-again-a-reimagining-by-makaya-mccraven/,XL,"Gil Scott-Heron’s final album, 2010’s I’m New Here, was a moving but unfinished statement from an important but overlooked artist. By the mid-’00s, the writer, poet, and singer had a long and storied career behind him, with more than a dozen albums of word-dense soul and R&B, two novels, and one phrase, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,” taken from his song of the same name, that echoed through culture and became more famous than he would ever be. He was a crucial voice of protest who deeply influenced black music across genres—hip-hop especially—but he hadn’t done much in a while. His last LP had been released more than a decade earlier. In the years between, he’d had drug problems, which led to health problems and legal problems, including an extended stretch incarcerated at Riker’s Island. A lot of people had forgotten about Scott-Heron, but Richard Russell, who founded the label XL, remembered, and he got in touch. Scott-Heron wasn’t in a place where he could offer much creative input, but Russell persuaded him to make a record, a little at a time, and he built I’m New Here from fragments. In a New Yorker profile of Scott-Heron that ran six months after the album’s release, the writer and singer, then 61, said that he didn’t think of the album as his creation. “This is Richard’s CD,” he told Alec Wilkinson. “My only knowledge when I got to the studio was how he seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You’re in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.” A decade later, the songs, poems, and conversational snippets Scott-Heron recorded with Russell are showing up in another dream, this one imagined by Chicago drummer and producer Makaya McCraven. It’s the second album-length reworking of the I’m New Here material, following Jamie xx’s 2011 collection We’re New Here, but this one feels definitive. Though Jamie xx assembled a fantastic record, one thick with hypnotic samples and irresistible beats, We’re New Again brings us closer to Scott-Heron’s world.

Working with his regular circle of collaborators, many of whom have made highly regarded albums of their own in recent years (Jeff Parker on guitar, Brandee Younger on harp, Junius Paul on bass, Ben Lamar Gay on instruments and percussion), McCraven brings Scott-Heron’s work down to earth and situates it in a milieu the elder artist would have recognized. With arrangements that move between dirty blues, angelic spiritual jazz, and free-form drumming, McCraven has created a kind of survey of 20th-century black music that doesn’t draw undue attention to itself, one in which every piece fits together. McCraven is both a player and a collagist, splicing together long jams and improvisations into structured pieces. Everything on his records feels close—you hear the instruments more than the rooms they’re recorded in, which can make individual parts sound simultaneously machine-like and deeply funky. He likes compression and uses it artfully, and his beats radiate force and muscle. They’re like a layer of armor behind which his more subtle and delicate musical ideas can develop and grow. On We’re New Again, McCraven takes Scott-Heron’s primary themes from his sessions with Russell—what it means to live in fear, the idea of home, how we confront our mortality, the mysterious and transformative power of familial love—and channels them into a concept record. His sources speak to his big-picture ambitions. Via samples, he incorporates music played by both of his parents—his father Stephen McCraven, a drummer, worked with Archie Shepp, the Last Poets, and many others, and his mother, Ágnes Zsigmondi, is a singer—to connect this music to his own history, reinforcing the album’s central concerns of place and lineage. The work Scott-Heron recorded for I’m New Here was connected to his memoir, The Last Holiday, which he’d been tinkering with for years and was published the year after his death. The book finds Scott-Heron making history—he was one of the first black students to integrate white schools in Tennessee, and its final sections focus on his desire, alongside Stevie Wonder, to make Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday a national holiday—but many of its most moving passages are simpler scenes drawn from his childhood. And many of these detail his relationships with his mother and grandmother. Even if they didn’t read the memoir, fans of I’m New Here know his grandmother’s name, Lily Scott, because Scott-Heron mentions her in the track “On Coming From a Broken Home.” It’s a piece about not just her love but also the ways a seemingly dysfunctional family can provide all the emotional nourishment a kid might need. McCraven splits “On Coming From a Broken Home” into four parts, ensuring that its words are never far from our minds. “But Lily Scott was absolutely not your mail-order, room-service, typecast, black grandmother,” Scott-Heron speaks, adding later, “I loved her from the absolute marrow of my bones/And we was holdin’ on.” McCraven finds a different setting for each section of the poem—the album-opening part one is floating and spacey, part two is a throbbing acoustic blues drone, part three emits the glow of ’70s AM radio, and part four has percussive textures from West Africa—and that eclecticism carries through the rest of the record. “Running,” a powerful incantation about the desire to keep moving even when you know nothing will change, is driven by a propulsive drum break. McCraven turns “New York Is Killing Me” into a dense piano arrangement that sounds like an early-’60s Blue Note recording, with a layer of voices from the Harlem Gospel Choir on the “Lord Have Mercy on Me” refrain that underscores its connection to soul-jazz. The record’s cover songs are, in their own way, just as autobiographical. Bill Callahan’s “I’m New Here” suggests scenes from Scott-Heron’s itinerant life. Its narrator is both confident and vulnerable, taking in his surroundings and feeling reborn but also aware that he’ll need human communication to make it through. McCraven gives it his most relaxed and gentle arrangement, as if the hopeful chorus, “No matter how far wrong you’ve gone, you can always turn around,” might actually be true. The exceedingly spare rendition of “I’ll Take Care of You,” by R&B singer Brook Benton, could be an expression of a desire that Scott-Heron could never quite manifest, to be someone else’s place of safety. And Robert Johnson’s “Me and the Devil,” featuring a horn sample from one of McCraven’s father’s recordings, is a dark anthem for a man whose demons were never far behind. Early on, Scott-Heron wrote songs about alcoholism (“The Bottle”) and drugs (“Home Is Where the Hatred Is”), but “The Crutch,” which McCraven backs with a filthy electrified blues vamp, feels especially autobiographical. The song is about heroin (“His eyes half-closed revealed his world of nod/A world of lonely men and no love, no god”) but as the harrowing New Yorker profile made clear, by the time Scott-Heron recorded it, he was addicted to crack cocaine. His words and songs showed compassion for addicts and framed chemicals as a way to cope with pain and loneliness. They also turned the concept of “home” found elsewhere on the album inside-out—sometimes, a place of salvation becomes one of torment. The ability to live with such contradictions and give them life with his words is part of what made Scott-Heron’s work special, and McCraven’s music inhabits that complicated space and keeps its sharp edges intact. It’s odd to draw lessons about survival from someone in trouble who is facing the end, but that’s another paradox the album negotiates. McCraven helps us feel it: For a little longer, anyway, Gil Scott-Heron was still here, and he was holding on. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music.

27 Miles Underwater,Higher Power,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e31d46f1620320008ffb51e/1:1/w_160/higherpower.jpg,2020-02-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/higher-power-27-miles-underwater/,Roadrunner,"27 Miles Underwater is the most 1995 rock album of 2020, sounding and feeling like a DGC million-dollar advance. The Leeds band’s influences are almost exclusively drawn from the credibility void between Nevermind and Is This It, and they treat ’90s alt-rock with the reverence usually afforded to classic rock. It makes sense: The last time I listened to my local alternative station, they were playing “Get Lucky,” and any song that sounded remotely like Higher Power was about as old as frontman Jimmy Wizard—his age is one year for every mile underwater in the album title. Even the cover’s grungy, grey-green-orange color scheme is a period piece, recalling countless Buzz Bin casualties clogging Sam Goody racks. 2017’s Soul Structure was tuneful enough to suggest Wizard’s yelp could travel from dingy bars to Midwest fairgrounds with the right guidance, and Higher Power is the latest post-hardcore act to get called up to Roadrunner, which boasts an unparalleled track record helping heavy guitar bands achieve the more modern, modest definition of success—Turnstile, Creeper and Code Orange all worked their way up from raw, uncommercial beginnings to the bigger fonts on festival posters topped by their labelmates Korn and Slipknot. Higher Power is by far the most accessible of the bunch, which likely explains why they called on UK vet Gil Norton for production rather than Roadrunner Loudness War-mongers Will Yip or Ross Robinson; Norton practically invented the sound of commercial alt-rock on the Pixies’ post-Albini albums, perfected it on Foo Fighters’ The Colour and the Shape and was behind the boards when Jimmy Eat World, Counting Crows, Dashboard Confessional, and Catherine Wheel wanted to make their slickest, sharpest albums. 27 Miles Underwater’s resulting games of “spot the riff” are fun for all ages—depending on whether you got your Carhartt hoodie from Goodwill or the WIP holiday sale, “Seamless” might variously recall Jane’s Addiction, Glassjaw or a more radio-friendly Turnstile. As with Deftones when they first started to experiment with these funny little things called “melodies,” Higher Power link atonal riffs to polished choruses with transitions so jarring they become hooks on their own. As with many of their peers, Higher Power’s idea of psychedelia is sourced from the woozier moments of Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, and Hum, and they’re maybe the only one that remembers those bands could groove, too. While nearly every single part of a Higher Power song has an identifiable source, they cycle through ideas quick enough to avoid any charges of grand larceny even when they get caught stealing. But ultimately, Higher Power’s Case Logic binders give more insight into their lives than their lyrics book. Wizard’s purview extends to what he calls “relationships and issues,” gut-level concerns that keep Higher Power grounded in hardcore but denies 27 Miles Underwater a perspective to match its grand sonic ambitions, something as distinctive as Matt Talbot’s sci-fi affinities, Page Hamilton’s stoicism or Chino Moreno’s bloodthirst. This isn’t helped by the tracklist, which shares titles with actual Pantera, Helmet and Deftones songs. The Headbanger’s Ball cosplay is less of a concern if Higher Power is your idea of fun, but there's not much to linger on here, and no matter how you look at it, once you break the surface of 27 Miles Underwater, it ain’t that deep.","Alongside producer Gil Norton, whose work defined commercial alt-rock, the Leeds hardcore band reanimates the sound of 1995 with eerie accuracy.

Crashed My Car,HookNedarb,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3ad7570ad70b000849fbcc/1:1/w_160/Crashed%20My%20Car_Hook.jpg,2020-02-07 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hook-nedarb-crashed-my-car/,GC,"Hook sucker-punched her way into the world with last year’s Bully, which flipped the controversial Rockstar video game of the same name to introduce the Riverside, California rapper as a cut-throat queen bee with acrylic nails and clout goggles. She came across as the toughest kid in the schoolyard, the one who taunted the other kids into fighting but wasn’t afraid to throw down herself—her rap name evokes a punch to the face as much as a tightly written chorus. Hook finds a natural partner in Nedarb, who executive-produced Bully and shares the billing with her on Crashed My Car. One of the contemporary rap underground’s most prolific producers, Nedarb is a relentless workhorse and hustler, as skilled at finding new talent as he is at crafting beats. Before he produced, Braden Morgan (his producer tag is his name backwards) played in hardcore bands, and his most influential collaborations have been with the members of the emo rap outfit Goth Boi Clique. Ned’s most famous beat is an emotional banger that flips a Microphones song, but his music resists being simplified as “SoundCloud rap”—he’s collaborated with artists as varied as Open Mike Eagle and Alice Glass. He pulls equally from alternative rock, experimental electronic music, and various strains of California rap, but the end result is more mutation than mash-up, synthesizing disparate sources into a distinct and singular sound. Ned was born in Alberta, Canada, but he lives in Los Angeles, and his production for Hook is distinctly West Coast. These beats are heavy and hyphy, a hard-hitting mix of 808s and deep bass designed to make trunks resound and asses shake. The album’s title offers a sonic motif across 10 tracks—wailing sirens, shattered windshields, frenetic voicemail messages—that keeps the listener on a perpetual razor’s edge. Hook’s Riverside homebase is located in California’s Inland Empire, an area she describes as “nothing.” As she puts it in an interview with The Fader, “the IE” revolves around house parties, not shows: “If you go to a party in the IE, you’re going to hear a lot of ratchet shit, a little bit a hyphy, a lot of L.A. shit. Basically a lot of shaking your ass music.” That Inland Empire influence spills out of Crashed My Car; the album feels like a house party at its peak, threatening to get shut down at any moment. Hook and Nedarb ride that dangerous line when you’re still having a great time but can sense the paranoia starting to creep in, as the clock counts down on one of your neighbors inevitably calling the cops. Hook’s delivery is staccato and precise, with little distinction between verse and chorus—as her name implies, her bars are all hook, no filler. Her flow is flanked by overdubs and ad-libs, a cacophonous clone army of chattering voices that mimics the imitators she calls out on “Wanna Be”: “I’m who your sister wanna be/That’s not Hook, she a wannabe.” Up front, she’s confident and calculated, but her vocal parts on the edges sound exasperated, overrun with anxiety and gasping for breath. When she ends “Yes Man” just chanting the words “shit” and “fucking ow” over and over again, it sounds not like a Playboi Carti-esque affectation but like somebody going through a crisis. The features on Bully felt like overhearing an after-school shit-talking session with the kids you weren’t cool enough to hang with; Hook’s guests on Crashed My Car mostly serve to make her look better. Professional shitposter Zack Fox shows up on the title track for a serviceable, punchline-heavy verse that’s overshadowed by Hook’s more distinctive delivery. When she makes jokes, by comparison, they’re more subdued and don’t sound like rough drafts of tweets—“She said she wanna meet up around noon/But I don’t fuck with 12, so I told her 2.” Minnesota’s Lerado lends a spaced-out drawl to “Awesome,” and LA’s Almighty Suspect appears on “Onion” with a flow as unbridled as Hook’s is bottled. “Onion” sounds like something Sada Baby would spit over, but Sada raps like he’s in a shouting match with the instrumental — Hook is equal parts honey and vinegar, and only needs a whisper to command a beat to do her bidding. Like a car crash or the biggest bully in school, Hook demands you give her your attention—if you don’t, she just might drag you on her next tape.","Working with Lil Peep collaborator Nedarb, the Riverside rapper makes 10 songs feel like a great house party right before someone calls the cops.

Which Way Is Forward? EP,Obongjayar,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3d4695ee3f2e0008bc7e05/1:1/w_160/WHICH%20WAY%20IS%20FORWARD.%20BLANK%20LEGS.jpg,2020-02-07 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/obongjayar-which-way-is-forward-ep/,September Recordings,"Obongjayar is a musician taking his time. After releasing a clutch of EPs in 2016 and 2017, and then a handful of singles and collaborations (with Danny Brown, Wiki, Jesse James Solomon, and Richard Russell) in the intervening years, he returns with his most accomplished work to date. Slightly longer than his previous records, it’s still relatively compact—running to just seven tracks and a shade over 20 minutes in total—but finds him exploring new, more fruitful ground that goes beyond the art-school spoken word and deconstructed, Frank Ocean-via-James Blake instrumentals of 2017’s Bassey EP. What’s most striking about this growth is that the Nigerian-born, London-based musician’s voice has become more instrument than deliverer of sermons. His vocals have a magnetic, elastic quality: Half coo, half gravelly, wizened intonation. The resulting juxtaposition simultaneously suggests both naivete and long-toothed wisdom as he navigates issues of identity, racial politics, and belonging. “Our fathers put us in the sand [...] we’ve been paying for it ever since,” Obongjayar hisses on “Soldier Ant,” interrogating what it is to be a black man in the modern world. He reflects on a society that serves constant reminders of his skin color—“I get it everywhere/From the bobbies on the beat/To the airport security”—and uses the shifting register of his voice to wrestle with conflicting portrayals of black masculinity. Ultimately his message is one of defiance. “Keep your head up, press your weight against the winds that try to throw you,” he murmurs on “God’s Own Children,” before launching into a full-throated refrain: “It’s your world now, can you feel it?” Just as his songs explore a sense of being, the music feels lived in. It’s sonorous, enveloping stuff. There’s a meditative quality to the interaction between his voice and the arrangements it inhabits. As a performer, Obongjayar offers an enormous sense of presence, too, channelling the traditions of Afrobeat bandleaders like Bola Johnson and Fela Kuti. Yes, Kuti is an obvious reference point—perhaps too obvious—but Obongjayar shares an undeniable sense of both gravity and drive with the activist Afrobeat pioneer. The songs’ textural depth belies the fact that they are the work, for the most part, of a solo artist. Writing and producing all the tracks himself, with assistance from multi-instrumentalist Barney Lister (and Oli Barton-Wood on “Soldier Ant”), Obongjayar pulls from a vast instrumental palette: slinky guitars rubbing against space-age synths; sharp, disembodied yelps; a railway rattle of hand drums. Sonically, Which Way Is Forward? sits somewhere between the mystic expansionism of Kamasi Washington and the colloquial, upbeat grooves of the Dur-Dur Band. He borrows the clipped, precise percussion of any drummer who’s tried to emulate Tony Allen and the tight songcraft of contemporaries like Moses Boyd or Sampa the Great. If there is any complaint, it’s that Obongjayar hasn’t allowed Which Way Is Forward? to spill out into a full-length album. With a little extra room to stretch out, the songs’ tempos and densities might not feel so uniform. But there’s reassurance for those left wanting to hear more, as he purrs on “Still Sun”: “I know who I am/This is not the end.”","The Nigerian-born, London-based artist returns with his strongest work yet, celebrating black selfhood in expansive, richly textured songs rooted in Afrobeat and electronic soul.

Father of All...,Green Day,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e39f5e4a42e4e000882e08c/1:1/w_160/Father%20of%20All_Green%20Day.jpg,2020-02-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/green-day-father-of-all/,RepriseWarner,"Green Day have spent the last decade trying to shake the burden of importance. The trio’s 2004 smash American Idiot didn’t just reinvigorate their career, it elevated them from fading ’90s alt-rock holdovers to a big-tent attraction with voice-of-their-generation prestige. Sixteen years later, it’s still astounding to think that Green Day somehow recorded one of the defining rock albums of the George W. Bush era. But that critical breakthrough also created stifling expectations for the records that followed. Rock-opera grandeur and solemn political protest were never the most natural fit for a pop-punk act whose breakout hit was about masturbating out of sheer boredom. Save for 2009’s spiritual sequel 21st Century Breakdown, everything Green Day has recorded since has been an attempt to reclaim some of their former irreverence, starting with their low-stakes 2012 trilogy ¡UNO!, ¡DOS!, and ¡TRÉ! and continuing with 2016’s tepid Revolution Radio. Each of those records attempted a leaner, meaner reboot of the band, yet they all stopped well short of Father of All Motherfuckers, the most convincingly carefree Green Day record of the new millennium. At just 26 minutes, it’s the band’s briefest album ever—a full five minutes shorter than even 39/Smooth—and it pointedly resists political commentary on the times, as prime for comment as the times may be. It’s as if the band imagined what shape an American Idiot: Trump Edition might take, then made the exact opposite of it. In its early stretch, Father of All... is sometimes barely even recognizable as Green Day. On the title track, a bluesy retro-stomper in the Black Keys mold, Billie Joe Armstrong trades his lippy sneer for a Jack White falsetto, while the Hives-esque “Fire, Ready, Aim” imagines the kind of rock-revival makeover Green Day might have attempted in the mid-’00s if their rock-opera muse never struck. From the candied guitar compression of Dookie to the Blu-Ray clarity of American Idiot, top-dollar production has always been Green Day’s secret weapon, and here, as ever, they aren’t shy about deploying it. “Oh Yeah” plays directly to hockey arenas (it can’t be a coincidence that the band just inked a two-year partnership with the NHL). But Father of All... really comes to life when it stops giving its throwback rock the beer commercial treatment and just plays it for straightforward kicks. Lots of bands channel Big Star and the Replacements, but few do it with the verve of “Meet Me On The Roof” and “I Was a Teenage Teenager,” Green Day’s most fetching and youthful songs in ages. The trio sounds reinvigorated, more like hungry newcomers staking their claim than a band a quarter-century removed from their major-label debut. It’s a genuine blast hearing Green Day lock-in with music this peppy and spirited, at least for a little while. The album aims for instant gratification and achieves it so efficiently that it can’t help but burn fast. They band have no secrets to share; they reveal them all upfront, and its most eager hooks can begin to grate after just a few spins. But there are worse things than a record that doesn’t play the long game. Father of All Motherfuckers asks for almost none of your time and makes good on it. Who knew Green Day had a record this humble left in them?

Treat Myself,Meghan Trainor,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3c36af0ad70b000849fd50/1:1/w_160/MeghanTrainor_TreatMyself.jpg,2020-02-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/meghan-trainor-treat-myself/,Epic,"Meghan Trainor’s latest album, Treat Myself, includes the tapping sound of a coconut opener used as an instrument, the word “genetics” spelled out in a chant, and a children’s choir. It does not include the song “Treat Myself,” a jangly slew of saccharine self-indulgence released in a blitz of singles that preceded the album. For that, you’ll have to buy the extended version, available only at Target. Treat Myself was originally scheduled for release back in August 2018, but Trainor pushed it back because she couldn’t stop writing songs, vowing not to release it “until I get everything out of my head and recorded in the studio.” The result is an album that tries to be all things to all people, a sonic overload that bludgeons the listener with bastardized “empowerment” for 15 songs. Treat Myself is clogged with oozing ballads, contaminated funk, and garish shudders of EDM. The closest thing to a mission statement is “Babygirl,” a glitchy, throbbing wail whose chorus goes “Love yourself! Love yourself! Love yourself! Love yourself! AHHH!” If you ask Meghan Trainor, she might say she makes feel-good songs, anthems for boss-bitches-in-training who yearn to “have it all,” as she croons. But in Trainor’s world, having it all tends to center around male approval. She catapulted to fame in 2014 with “All About That Bass,” a catchy-enough jingle assuring the masses that men do, in fact, like butts. Feminists condemned the song for its not-so-subtle messaging (your body is acceptable, but only because men want to fuck it), and Trainor later announced that she didn’t consider herself a feminist—a sentiment she doubled down on with followup single “Dear Future Husband,” which painted a housewife fantasy in which marital happiness hinges on the wife buying groceries. (Two years later, with a new album to promote, she changed her mind.) Much of Treat Myself relies on the idea of female duplicity; instead of dismantling the trope, Trainor’s lyrics capitulate to it. “I’m crazy but I’m sweet,” she warbles on “Blink.” “Evil Twin” is more explicit: an apology from Trainor for the “crazy bitch” side of her, which makes her “make my bad decisions, but I’m innocent.” Where Lizzo and other pop stars who capitalize on the commodification of female empowerment have embraced the unruly, unlikable woman—“100% that bitch, even when I’m crying, crazy”—Trainor is left constantly placating: for hesitating to take a compliment, for daring to get drunk, for being both too much and too little. This is self-flagellation disguised as motivation, a Peloton instructor prompting you to pedal faster until you hurl. Confusing production choices make the album even more exhausting. “Nice to Meet Ya”, the most tolerable track, is engineered to be a banger, with tingling drums and a mediocre Nicki Minaj verse, but its whisper of a chorus is harsh and irritating. “Wave” starts off with panoramic piano and titanic vocals before a gaudy EDM pulse kicks in, turning it into something like a Cascada remix for a middle school dance in a sweaty gym. Trainor relies on ostentatious background vocals throughout, which oscillate between gospel-inflected harmonies and cartoonish carols. (She’s said they were inspired by visits to Kanye West’s Sunday Services.) Droning “dum dum dum”s grate against bass drops; choruses droop under the weight of so many voices. “I miss the way we used to funk,” Trainor chirps over “Disney on Ice”–meets–disco beats, in “Funk,” a song so charmed by its ability to substitute “fuck” for “funk” that it repeats the sentence six times in the first twenty seconds. The oddest moment on the album is the song “Genetics,” which seems designed to provoke controversy. “How you get that bod? Is it from God?” Trainor trills alongside The Pussycat Dolls, then spells out the titular word like a cheerleader for eugenics. It’s especially jarring after a string of songs about how earnestly Trainor is working to improve herself (including “Workin’ on It,” a muted song that seems genuinely well-intentioned). You want to root for her throughout the record, hearing her croon about lost love and never being asked to dance; you want her to love herself for something other than the sake of attracting someone. Aiming to uplift women is an obvious good. But maybe true empowerment means we can demand more from those who claim to speak for us.","The pop star attempts to be all things to all people, offering an overstimulating mix of sounds and a message of self-flagellation disguised as empowerment.

There Is No Other,Isobel Campbell,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e346828c5b25400082db121/1:1/w_160/There%20Is%20No%20Other_Isobel.jpg,2020-02-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/isobel-campbell-there-is-no-other/,Cooking Vinyl,"Twelve months ago you would have gotten long odds on Isobel Campbell returning in 2020 with an album of dashing, adventurous, and even rather funky indie pop. The former Belle and Sebastian singer may have scuffed up her musical palette in the 2000s with a trio of releases alongside onetime Screaming Tree Mark Lanegan, but she nevertheless remained frozen in the public eye as the ethereal voice of cardigan indie, an impression hardly helped by the two so-gentle-they’re-almost-not-there albums she recorded as the Gentle Waves. But Los Angeles, where Campbell now lives, loves a comeback, particularly one as unlikely and triumphant as There Is No Other, Campbell’s first solo album in 14 years and among the best things she has put her name to since leaving Belle and Sebastian. There Is No Other may remind listeners of Campbell’s illustrious past—her nebulous whisper of a voice has the effect of Proust’s madeleine on a certain breed of indie-pop fan—but it also suggests the hitherto untapped potential of a musical magpie, taking in everything from synthesizer sleaze to gospel-infused soul. Psychedelia is a touchstone—Campbell has spoken of the record’s “dreamy, otherworldly feel”—but she taps the gentle Californian psychedelia of “Incense and Peppermints” and Friends-era Beach Boys rather than the acid freak-out of Syd Barrett’s solo career; the kind of psychedelia you could take home to meet your parents for tea, muffins, and meditation. Indeed, the gilded specter of California hangs heavy over There Is No Other. But this is the California of dreamy sunsets and Laurel Canyon bongos, as seen through the eyes of an outsider, rather than the more humdrum reality of America’s most populous state. “City of Angels” is an ode to a city Campbell finds “seductive yet overwhelming,” while “Boulevard” is her reaction to L.A.’s homeless crisis—not that you would notice the angst amid the two songs’ campfire-and-red-wine vibe. The former is particularly lush, a mixture of gently picked acoustic guitar, finger cymbals, and chirping cicadas, the melodic warmth inviting you to pull up a seat and toast a marshmallow. Elsewhere, the vibe is closer to Glasgow-gone-American. “The Heart of It All” and “Hey World” add sweet gospel vocals to Campbell’s pastel tones, bringing to mind Primal Scream’s experiments on Screamadelica—sincere and evocative if not entirely convincing. In the album’s most unlikely move, Campbell covers Tom Petty’s “Runnin’ Down a Dream,” replacing the song’s signature guitar riff and driving rock drums with lightly distorted synth and drum machine, bringing a delicious nonchalance to Petty’s automotive anthem. That Campbell gets away with this broad palette is thanks to her empathetic arrangements and clever songwriting—the pocket chorus of “Ant Life” has the kind of understatement that only experienced writers would dare. She has a knack for making everything sound utterly effortless, as if the songs came to her during an afternoon nap. A 14-year gap between solo albums might suggest struggle and toil, but perhaps the best compliment you could pay this picture postcard of a release is that you would never suspect how long its creator had been away.

Some Music for Robby Müller,SQÜRL,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3ad1c220256b00096b9e7d/1:1/w_160/Robby%20Mu%CC%88ller_SQURL.jpg,2020-02-06 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/squrl-some-music-for-robby-muller/,Sacred Bones,"It would be easy to understand SQÜRL, a collaboration between Carter Logan and the director Jim Jarmusch, as the musical pet project of a famous filmmaker. The duo formed a decade ago, to score Jarmusch’s movie The Limits of Control, and now SQÜRL market themselves as an “enthusiastically marginal band from New York City,” an image so coy it might make you want to bang your head on the limits of pretension. Yet music is not a new passion for Jarmusch, whose pedigree reaches back to his days manning the synths for the enthusiastically marginal Del-Byzanteens in the early 1980s—when everyone in New York had a band, as he once told The Washington Post. Like Jarmusch’s recent films, among them Only Lovers Left Alive and Paterson, his music’s ease and self-assuredness question why the knee-jerk reaction of our time is to treat earnest cultural voraciousness with cynicism. Jarmusch, after all, is nothing if not earnest. Even the focus on material objects that pervades his recent features is less a social commentary than a reflection of its creator. SQÜRL’s new album, Some Music for Robby Müller, was developed as the score to Claire Pijman’s 2018 documentary Living the Light – Robby Müller, about the titular Dutch cinematographer; one scene features Jarmusch at a guitar store in Bushwick, searching for an instrument that “relates to Robby in some way.” (He settles on a mid-1960s Teisco Spectrum IV with a Bigsby vibrato, used on the album.) Trying to capture a person’s essence with a new guitar seems the province of an advertisement, not a filmmaker, but such is the ambiguity of Jarmusch’s recent universe: Music, film, objects, human beings, and cities all exist on the same plane, equalized by his conviction in the eternality of beautifully made things. He conjures Müller, a friend and frequent collaborator, by using a warm guitar tone, often laden with reverb. Some Music consists of a series of sun-kissed instrumentals, bound by a song called “Robby’s Theme” and a single variation. Müller was resourceful, hated excess, and loved natural, minimal lighting sources; appropriately, Some Music is a spare record based on a few precise shifts in atmosphere. The album is SQÜRL’s prettiest, and because of its surprising simplicity, among their best. Jarmusch and Logan strip their arrangements of all past accoutrements—gone are Jozef van Wissem’s powerful lute playing, the crunch and feedback of heavy distortion, the glass harmonica, bass guitar, and Jarmusch’s buried, punkish vocals. What’s left is a sound so direct and meditative that you can hear SQÜRL considering light’s filmic properties while they make music. Logan’s drums appear only once, on “In a Lonely Place,” their tom-heavy menace a well-chosen contrast to the album’s Americana-drenched hues. “While Vermeer Was Sleeping” evokes a lonesome mood that echoes Müller’s life—many of his movies, including the ones he made with Jarmusch, were shot on the road in the United States, fixated on the simultaneous dislocation and enchantment of the itinerant traveler. It’s been a long time since Jarmusch sounded dislocated, on either record or film. Müller died in 2018, and maybe this album captures a feeling they once shared, or perhaps it’s a sign of what’s next for Jarmusch and SQÜRL. More than a band, SQÜRL are an idea about how music and film interact, and their enthusiasm for both mediums is as palpable as a vintage instrument. Inside the brief 30 minutes of Some Music for Robby Müller are real feelings that will outlast the fame of its creators, and all of the guitars, pedals, and vibratos that went into its creation.

Likewise,Frances Quinlan,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e38383a5a872f00088e3721/1:1/w_160/Likewise_Frances%20Quinlan.jpg,2020-02-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/frances-quinlan-likewise/,Saddle Creek,"Frances Quinlan has spent the past 10 years unleashing an indie-rock shout so ecstatic and alive that it seems to tear into the limits of singing whenever it appears. You will never hear someone holler with such grace and exactitude as Quinlan, in 2012, exploding the final moments of her band Hop Along’s second album, Get Disowned, as if her life, and perhaps the lives of countless others, depended on it. Scratching at the reaches of her power on a syllabic level—“Me-te-or, MAKE me YOUNG”—her rave-up crests and falls like the chart of a haywire heart monitor, as if she is wishing on a star not for herself, but for all of us. Her empathy is delivered with so much force that it could induce vertigo. Quinlan started Hop Along solo as a teenager in 2004. As a child, she dreamed of writing short stories; she learned to sing from a woman in a castle in New Jersey. Behind the mic, Quinlan summons the high-and-wild electricity of freak folk à la Joanna Newsom, if powered by the shout-along catharsis of emo and grounded by the every-person storytelling of folk in general. When Hop Along solidified into a loud Philadelphia rock band in 2010, Quinlan’s voice scaled with it, perhaps to be heard above such maximal volume. She composed her first record under her own name, Likewise, with the intention of keeping her songs—which, in Hop Along, are arranged collectively—“closer to their original forms.” Likewise is more minimal and elegant than any Hop Along record. There’s a lightness to the instrumentation as Quinlan broadens her sound to include synthesizers, strings, jaunty piano, the glittery clack of programmed beats, and harp from Mary Lattimore. Its highlights are two songs that Quinlan has said were first recorded but not used for Hop Along’s 2018 album Bark Your Head Off, Dog, called “A Secret” and “Went to LA”; she wrote Likewise around them. In both, you can hear the brittle surfaces of her acoustic strumming—like the cover art she painted, it feels unusually tactile—as well as unsentimental jolts of resilience. Her melodies wander inquisitively and move forward in unconventional ways. Quinlan also finds original nuances in her voice, like the sense of flight in how she sings an elongated “aaa” in “A Secret,” or the cleverly sputtered “no” that hangs off the edge of a chorus to “Your Reply.” Where previously her performances felt breathless, here there’s room to breathe. Quinlan’s Hop Along lyrics typically narrate the possibly unheard stories of regular people (a waitress, an abused child, a huge family inhabiting a tiny apartment) in near-journalistic detail. Her project can feel like an exercise in exploding the ego, in effacing the “I” in favor of selfless curiosity and compassion for the world. This writerly flair lives on here: “I know it isn’t fair/Stories struggle for air,” she sings on the solemn “Lean,” and on “Now That I’m Back,” she details the gnarly profile of a woman who had a roach surgically removed from the inside of her skull, “and one night, ate Raid-seasoned spaghetti.” But on Likewise, Quinlan more often presents these observations as fragments. The death of Czech author Bohumil Hrabal, who fell from a window (the details vary, she sings, “depending on the website”), makes its way into “Your Reply,” like a stray reflection in a diary before she continues on towards the personal. Filled with words that shouldn’t make sense in pop music—“wheelbarrow,” “orangutan,” “lemmings,” “cannibal” and “cannibalistic” both—her songs marvel in the obliqueness of language. “Somebody wrote ‘tender’/In the novel’s margins,” she sings on “Your Reply,” which really is peak Frances Quinlan. It can be difficult to pinpoint just what Quinlan’s songs on Likewise might be about in a linear or narrative sense. But through her Dylanesque collages of dialogue, literary references, interiority, and mundanity, these central frictions emerge: between a scream and a lull, confession and abstraction, the poetic and the colloquial—ultimately, between people failing to communicate. “There just doesn’t seem to be much room for a reply,” she sings on “Your Reply.” “You were mid-sentence when I had to interrupt you in order to relate,” goes “Detroit Lake.” There’s something profound in how the album starts with “Piltdown Man,” a clinical reflection on an archaeologist, and concludes with an open-hearted appeal: “Now that I’m back/We should try again to talk.” The whole of Likewise—maybe of Quinlan’s catalogue—seems to probe this universal dilemma: our struggle to reach each other, to speak honestly and unguardedly. Likewise’s nine songs often eschew the blown-out euphoria of Hop Along—even its synth-pop cover of Built to Spill’s eternally arresting “Carry the Zero” sounds a bit tempered. But the album draws you close with repeat listens. At its center is the miraculous, ferociously strummed “Went to LA,” which contains enough spark and awe to power a record twice as long. In her lyrics, Quinlan again negotiates the private and the public, pivoting from statements of personal desperation to pure exposition (“The owner of the laundromat gave me a ride home/She said she saw me come in alone”). As she carves, line by line, into the exquisite breaks of her singing, she finds clarity. “Oh the humiliation of having been/Perfectly understood,” she intones, giving way to a transcendent refrain—“Heaven is a second chance”—and clenching her words into screams before letting them free. These are felt lessons in vulnerability, and perhaps in the “self-preservation” she also sings of. In telling the stories of other people, Quinlan created one for herself; in the cracks of her colossal voice, it’s already a legend.

Walls,Louis Tomlinson,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e383b55252de300089028c3/1:1/w_160/Walls_Louis%20Tomlinson.jpg,2020-02-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/louis-tomlinson-walls/,Sony,"The years following One Direction’s dissolution have reshaped Louis Tomlinson. More than just rich-people problems, his life has tumbled into real tragedies and triumphs, like the death of both his mother and 18-year-old sister, as well as the birth of his son. Of course, now he wants to tear down his barriers and emerge fresh, raw, and newly sensitive, like the many references to roadblocks and changing on his debut album Walls suggest. Something isn’t right, though. The heart he so desperately wants to present is missing. Unfortunately, Walls is just as maddeningly uninteresting as its slate grey, cuffed-light-wash-jeans album cover suggests. The appropriately named album opener “Kill My Mind” is a feeble attempt to create stadium pop-rock, droning on with faux bad-boy guitar while Tomlinson limply delivers, “You’re a nightmare on the dancefloor/And you hate me, and I want more.” “Too Young” is an explicit introduction to the album’s running preoccupation with youth; like many of Walls’ folkier moments, the song is flat coffee-shop music. “Habit” features this same mood but adds in sleepy drumming. “Don’t Let It Break Your Heart” subtracts the drumming and adds in wistful vocal layering, reminding us that “life gets hard and it gets messed up.” Brian Eno had Music for Airports; this is Music for Your John Mayer Cover Band. When I was in high school, I owned a limited edition Harry Styles doll and read tawdry fanfiction about our favorite Frankenstein, Mr. Larry Stylinson. This was how you engaged in the fandom of One Direction, and fans knew that every One Direction member had an archetype. Harry Styles was the heartbreaker, Zayn Malik the mysterious (read: ethnic) one, Niall Horan the cute one, and Liam Payne was unlucky enough to receive the nickname “Daddy Directioner.” Tomlinson was the “sassy” one who couldn’t sing, which didn’t add up to much. Now on his own, Tomlinson is left with exactly what he is: someone who received massive success when flanked by other, more interesting people. Walls is filled with the kind of dead-eyed vocal delivery and lazy drumming, strumming, and writing that all pop stars fear. There is no attempt to scrape at the soul, to dig deep. The result is a depressing Xerox of people like Coldplay and Oasis, who managed to make soft Britpop with a little more charm and ingenuity. Tomlinson is best on “We Made It,” where his imitation begins to sound more like a sincere attempt at invention. The dreamy acoustic guitar sounds like the backdrop to the silliest, prettiest, slow-motion Instagram video of a sunset on the beach. Reminiscing about how he used to “share a single bed and tell each other what we dream about,” Tomlinson captures the essence of youth with one line. You can’t hear the stars in his eyes, but you know that they’re there. The rest of the album could have used this tenderness and lyrical specificity, but it’s mostly abandoned in favor of the pop conventions that Tomlinson pledges himself to, remembering how he used to sing “something pop-y on the same four chords/used to worry 'bout it but I don't no more.” It’s difficult to tell whether Tomlinson is even trying to make music different from his time in One Direction. On “Fearless,” he constructs an entire chorus around the question, “Do you still remember feeling young?” like he can’t quite get himself to move on from the golden days. “Perfect Now” is basically a low-quality rewrite of One Direction’s “Little Things,” featuring galaxy-brain observations of an insecure lover like, “You say to me your jeans don’t fit/You don’t feel pretty and it’s hard to miss.” Tomlinson himself calls this song a “kind of” lyrical extension of “What Makes You Beautiful,” One Direction’s legendary breakout single. Try as he may, Tomlinson has not quite progressed from featured voice to solo artist. For all the major changes in his life, his music seems to be stuck in place. You can take the boy out of the boyband, but not the boyband out of the boy.

Parasite: Original Motion Picture Score,Jung Jae-il,by: Vanessa Ague,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f4bc88122fc000882d071/1:1/w_160/Parasite2_Jung%20Jae%20Il.jpg,2020-02-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jung-jae-il-parasite-original-motion-picture-score/,Sacred Bones,"Sunlight streaks into a low beige room, where rumpled socks hang from the ceiling as Kim Ki-woo learns that his family’s free WiFi hookup has been locked with a password. Bouncy pianos and bells lend a playful air to the discovery. This is our first taste of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, a stark, genre-blending satirical film that paints a harrowing picture of class divide through the impoverished Kim family’s attempt to infiltrate a wealthy household. Composer Jung Jae-il’s score strikes a delicate balance between gentleness and severity, creating unexpected musical contrasts that evoke a constant sense of uncertainty. Jung previously scored Bong’s 2017 drama Okja, providing a bustling backdrop to the story of a girl’s quest to save her beloved companion animal from the clutches of a greedy corporation. Both films spotlight the inequities of capitalism, but with the Parasite soundtrack, Jung emphasizes disparate styles. As the film’s chaotic trajectory gets underway, the sense of hope from “Opening” soon dwindles. Juxtaposing exultant orchestral passages with gloomy piano ballads and rich melodies with spine-tingling violin glissandi, Jung uses sinister sounds to hint at what lies beneath the characters’ superficial appearances. As the score proceeds from lighthearted early pieces like “Mr. Yoon and Park” to the horror-movie pandemonium of “The Hellgate,” sly humor gives way to discord. The early stretches of the score feel too sparse without their accompanying visuals, more texture than melody. “Conciliation I” lacks forward motion; the heavy pizzicato of “Plum Juice” serves little dramatic purpose on its own. But with “The Belt of Faith,” a lavish suite that alternates between grand orchestral statements and solos, the score finds its voice. A baroque-sounding theme recalls Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, building towards a melodramatic climax. Immediately the score shifts to a moody piano ballad, “Moon Gwang Left,” sinking back into a darker reality. Contrasting styles inch into closer proximity as catastrophe looms. “The Frontal Lobe of Ki Taek” first appears placid, but its ominous blend of piano and strings shivers with nervous energy. “It Is Sunday Morning” presents a nostalgic vocal melody with a powerful sense of irony, until strings enter with alarming dissonance. With “Blood and Sword,” the music at last succumbs to fear. A pained cello melody echoes over a drone, while strings accompany with searing tone clusters reminiscent of Penderecki and prickling col legno as the Kim family meets tragedy. As the credits roll, we get one final glimpse into the daily life of Ki-woo. On “Soju One Glass,” actor Choi Woo-shik sings lyrics—written by Bong—that describe his character’s daily struggle. Cheery acoustic strums and an arena-ready electric guitar solo lighten the mood as he describes his unfortunate circumstances. It could be considered a musical mismatch—but it’s merely one final reminder of the way relentless positivity has a tendency of giving way to blunt reality. Like the plot of Bong’s film, the twists and turns of Jung’s score turn out to be circular path back to an uncannily familiar place.

The World at Night,Walter Martin,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e305cc71620320008ffb50e/1:1/w_160/World%20at%20Night_Walter%20Martin.jpg,2020-02-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/walter-martin-the-world-at-night/,Ile Flottante,"When Jonathan Fire*Eater lead vocalist Stewart Lupton passed away in 2018, the Walkmen bassist and keyboard player Walter Martin grieved his dear friend with a note memorializing his work. “Whatever the hell that thing is that happens when you see the best art or hear the best music or read the best lines—that other-worldly beauty and that feeling that you are in the presence of something that is magical and real,” he wrote, “Stew’s poems had that.” Martin and Lupton met in middle school at age 11 and the two quickly bonded, writing music together for the band that would become Fire*Eater and staying in touch long after it disbanded. So it was obvious the inspiration for The World at Night, Martin’s fifth solo album, should come from Lupton, by way of a handmade collage still hanging above Martin’s writing desk. The World at Night examines the symbiotic relationship between sorrow and hope. For every song grappling with loss, there are two marveling at life’s uncertainty. On the title track, Martin gazes at a starry sky: “Gee, is that you whispering to me?/Well I know I shouldn’t believe what I can’t see/But oh my, with each flicker in the sky/A ghost goes ghosting by.” It’s followed by the heartfelt “Little Summer Fly,” about delighting in each day’s fleeting pleasures, and “To the Moon,” an escapist ballad about following foolish dreams. No matter the circumstances, Martin refuses to hide the sparkle in his eye. Instead of dragging listeners through secondhand grief, he invites them to sit beside him at a New York City dive, raise their cocktail glasses in a toast to irrepressibility, and take to the dance floor to celebrate dodging life’s unrelenting punches. Here, Martin’s optimism flourishes in the best arrangements of his career. Flutes, clarinets, upright bass, baritone sax—his childlike orchestrations in “October” and “First Thing I Remember” somehow avoid crossing into gratingly twee, perhaps because he does write music for children: Cheerios commercial soundtracks, family-friendly solo albums like We’re All Young Together and My Kinda Music, the theme to the Golden Globe-winning animated film Missing Link. And yet that side gig might be to blame for the moments in The World at Night where Martin sounds like he’s singing to his kids instead of his peers. This oversimplification appears in flashes, but it’s hard to miss: listing presents a toddler might want in “That’s All I Need,” or conversing with a bird in “Hey Joe.” In interviews, Martin jokes that he can’t sing, but his raspy voice makes for a charmingly suave and despondent narrator in “The Soldier,” the real story of Martin’s grandfather-in-law shipping off to World War II. It’s a gutting listen, the kind that looks backwards with unflinching clarity. That might be The World at Night’s biggest strength. Martin isn’t naive; he’s just a romantic. At its best, The World at Night evokes the strangest part of mourning: when your eyes fill with tears but they catch the light, making everything look brighter anyway.

Funeral,Lil Wayne,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3833e3252de30008902889/1:1/w_160/Funeral_Lil%20Wayne.jpg,2020-02-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-wayne-funeral/,Young Money EntertainmentRepublic,"Lil Wayne has been rapping so long that the protégés of his protégés have protégés. A teen prodigy turned megastar turned cautionary tale turned comeback king, Wayne has led about as many lives as anyone in rap: From Best Rapper Alive to “flash without the fire” and back again. Now, at 37, free of the colossal stakes hanging over his oft-delayed legacy album, Tha Carter V, Wayne has settled in and rediscovered his looseness. An album title like Funeral had fans speculating that this one might be his last, a requiem for his career. That idea seems ridiculous now. Why would one of the great rappers of this millennium retire just as he’s returning to form? Tha Carter V reestablished Lil Wayne as a force, answering many longstanding questions about his viability as an artist. Released at the conclusion of legal battles with his surrogate father and lifelong mentor Birdman, the album felt like the beginning of a second (or third) act. Wayne has said Carter albums are the only projects that require any specific preparation and focus, and that his other albums and mixtapes are simply born from his marathon recording sessions. With his rebound record finally liberated and the pressure alleviated, Funeral gets back to business as usual for Wayne. Which is to say: funneling what is likely countless hours in the booth spitballing and freestyling into something coherent. Wayne’s down years were largely the product of a diminishing punchline-to-clunker ratio. He’s still a volume shooter, but like Rockets guard James Harden (who gets a song named after him here), his low-percentage play is offset by his high degree of difficulty, his ability to break the game with crafty maneuvers and extreme skill. On the Mannie Fresh-produced “Mahogany,” which warps lyric fragments from Eryn Allen Kane’s “Bass Song” into jazz scatting, Wayne bends in and out of shape around her interjections. His “Ball Hard” verse is a free-associative word game, bouncing from one character to the next until they begin to blur together. Listening to Wayne on Funeral is a bit like watching a skateboard trick compilation: He wipes out a few times but it’s always in service of some epic stunt and when he does land one, it can be awe-inspiring. Just take a look at this perfectly absurd sequence from the opener: “Drive-bys in a Winnebago/Snipers never hit a baby, crib, or cradle/Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes/From a hundred feet away, now it’s a halo.” There is a breakneck speed to many of these verses, as if Wayne is so anxious to keep rapping that he can’t wait to get into the next one. The songs where he stops to catch his breath and gather his thoughts tend to venture toward the vaguely introspective, considering isolation, distrust, and love, and they produce most of the album’s sleepier moments. On “Trust Nobody,” which leans into a flatlining Adam Levine hook about not even being able to trust oneself, Wayne sounds both bored and boring. Wayne, The-Dream, and Mike WiLL Made-It should be an ideal trio, but “Sights and Silencers” is an inert ballad with an ill-defined concept. Like most Wayne albums, it is longer than it needs to be and thus prone to dry spells. For years, it has been easy to find trace amounts of Lil Wayne’s style from pop-rap’s center to well out along the weirder edges of the rap internet. The thought experiment “Dreams” is reminiscent of the best of Auto-Tune Wayne. “I Don’t Sleep” sounds like something Pi’erre Bourne might produce for Playboi Carti, the fluttering flutes and springy synths suiting Wayne’s half-sung cadences well. “Darkside” hedges closer to the sounds of SoundCloud gloomcasters like Trippie Redd, and he stalks through it with whiny tumbling phrases. Wayne mashes through every song with such reckless abandon it’s hard to tell where he draws influence these days. But it doesn’t take long for a song to get jump-started, and when it does, it’s thrilling to hear him romp about. Wayne raps with a lightning ferocity that will often conceal his more direct revelations. Lyrics about longevity (“I had a Benz when you had a bike”) and his artistic slump (“Safe to say I lost my way but I never lost the lead/Safe to say I lost the brakes but I never lost the speed”) are snuck in behind cartoonishly vivid sequences (“She say I got a vanilla aftertaste/Cut his face, let him use his blood for his aftershave”). There is decidedly less storytelling on this record than Tha Carter V, but there is still plenty of clever and unpredictable writing. “I’m on Cloud 9, nigga, you just on iCloud/I’m a icon, I shine and burn your eyes out,” he raps on “Piano Trap.” Across the hour, Funeral sounds less like last rites for Wayne and more like a resurrection.","With his big legacy album Tha Carter V out of the way, Weezy is back in the booth and cruising, experimenting with an array of styles and a dizzying maze of wordplay.

When We Stay Alive,Poliça,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e3835b11054520009103050/1:1/w_160/Stay%20Alive_Polic%CC%A7a.jpg,2020-02-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/polica-when-we-stay-alive/,Memphis Industries,"In the winter of 2018, Poliça singer Channy Leaneagh was clearing ice off her roof when she slipped and fell 10 feet to the ground. The landing broke a vertebra, damaged her spine, and left her unable to walk. What at first seemed like a curse—being stuck in a brace prevented her from working or taking care of her children—quickly became an opportunity, giving Leaneagh time to sit with her thoughts and confront traumas old and new. Poliça’s fifth album, When We Stay Alive, features some of the most piercing lyrics of Leaneagh’s career, half of which were written after the accident. But the rest of the Minneapolis electro-pop group doesn’t sound emotionally invested in their performance. As a result, the album is less a humanistic look at what it’s like to be given a second chance at life than it is an example of what happens when your bandmates leave you hanging. Filled with a renewed appreciation for life, Leaneagh found herself writing songs about her daily lived experience—the chase for stability in parenting, her experience protesting pollution in her neighborhood—which draw empathy from small details rather than grand gestures. She sounds newly raw when wrestling with her post-injury demons, as on the glossy “Feel Life.” “Screaming at death/‘Why won’t you stick?’/To feel I’ve failed, and I felt it,” she sings gracefully, despite the audible fear lingering on her tongue. Her voice alternates between soothing coos and a downtrodden lilt as if she’s breaking bad news gently, a singer finding her form in undesirable circumstances. But the rest of the band—producer Ryan Olson, bassist Chris Bierdenand, and drummers Ben Ivascu and Drew Christopherson—can’t keep up with Leaneagh. They dial the production in to the point of sterile perfection, sounding occasionally like a pre-loaded backing track, divorced from the meaning of Leaneagh’s words. The percussion is hollow, and the synths are like afterthoughts; on songs like “Be Again” and “Steady,” unexpected samples pierce the atmosphere like the blade of a pocketknife accidentally swinging open, distracting and damaging instead of flashy or fun. Poliça’s members recorded the parts of When We Stay Alive separately, exchanging files over the internet, and the isolation of that process is discernible. The band also invited a cast of dance and hip-hop producer pals to tinker with the tracks as they saw fit, which may have exacerbated the emotionless feel of the instrumentation. Poliça intended for this to be a form of musical collaging: a little cello here, some extra keys there. But the end results resemble a boardroom’s out-of-touch predictions for what cool music sounds like right now. For a band that found fame with live shows verging on jam sessions, Poliça strangely embrace the opposite now: impassiveness, rigidity, disconnectedness. When We Stay Alive finds a certain stride when it emphasizes that mechanical tendency. “Fold Up,” moored by electronic drums and croaking synths, flourishes by upping the tempo, veering toward the pleasantly mysterious territory of Thom Yorke’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. A few other tracks start off similarly strong, like the sweeping “Sea Without Blue” and the aptly titled “Driving,” but eventually lose steam, leaving Leaneagh adrift in tepid beats. For a record born from a second chance at life, When We Stay Alive sounds disenchanted with its own message.

Laughing Gas EP,Wild Nothing,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f5e948122fc000882d0a7/1:1/w_160/Laughing%20Gas_Wild%20Nothing.jpg,2020-02-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wild-nothing-laughing-gas/,Captured Tracks,"This year marks a decade since Gemini, the self-recorded debut that catapulted Virginia Tech senior Jack Tatum into contemporary dream pop canon. As his project Wild Nothing took off, Tatum’s music drew as many comparisons to 4AD royalty like the Cocteau Twins as it did to contemporaries like the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Over time, as Tatum gathered confidence, Wild Nothing’s sound became glossier, steering away from lo-fi guitars to embrace an exactingly produced vision of chillwave. With each subsequent release, the ethereal haze gradually cleared, putting Tatum’s wistful melodies and insubstantial lyricism in clearer view. By 2018’s Indigo, he seemed so focused on aesthetics that any potential for emotional connection withered. The new Laughing Gas EP—a handful of tracks recorded during the Indigo sessions—suggest an artist more concerned with creating a vibe than conjuring sincere feeling. It’s Tatum’s habit to follow each full-length album with a shorter collection of songs: Gemini outtakes appeared on the Golden Haze EP, while 2013’s Nocturne was followed by the Empty Estate EP. Ideally, this pattern of alternating full albums and EPs of leftovers would offer insight into his creative process, or at least some memorable deep cuts. But Laughing Gas suffers from the same issues as its predecessor without introducing any new ideas. Even Tatum’s usually enjoyable melodies feel bloodless. The psychedelic chug of “Sleight of Hand” too closely approximates Tame Impala’s “Let It Happen.” Closer “The World Is a Hungry Place” would make a passably lively B-side; still, it sounds like something Tatum could’ve conjured in his sleep. By far the strongest moment here is “Blue Wings,” first released as a standalone single more than a year ago. Driven by bass arpeggios that culminate in a massive, shimmering chorus, the song feels like it could’ve been demoed in the Nocturne days. And there’s the rub: However much Tatum might begrudge the fact, Wild Nothing is still synonymous with the warm nostalgia those early albums exuded. No amount of busy synth squiggles or dry drum loops can clear enough space to forge your own daydreams. The harder Tatum tries to snap back to reality, the further he lands from the mark.

LSD,The Leonard Simpson Duo,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28c434fd91bb000807b05d/1:1/w_160/lsd.jpg,2020-02-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-leonard-simpson-duo-lsd/,Jakarta,"Guilty Simpson is the kind of rapper traditionalists love—weathered as old boots, lyrically focused, incapable of tethering himself to any fashionable sound. He forged his style in Detroit way before 8 Mile burned an image of the city into hip-hop consciousness. As the years passed, some of his contemporaries went on to bigger things while others fell by the wayside, and his trusted ally J Dilla died far too young. All the while, Simpson mastered the art of remaining true and staying still. It’s 2020, and he is still worshipping the gods of boom-bap, still unleashing that cast-iron voice, still making old-school Detroit hip-hop. Guilty’s best album is the decade-old OJ Simpson, in which Madlib’s kaleidoscopic beats snapped together with his collaborator’s monotone flow. But with the once-touted OJ Simpson 2 nowhere near materializing, the rapper required a new collaborator, a partner in crime outside the hip-hop ecosystem that would appeal to his singular tastes. As things turned out, Simpson needed to look halfway around the world. Enter Jeremy Toy. The New Zealand producer and engineer—operating here under the name Leonard Charles—has enjoyed a nomadic career as an multi-instrumentalist and producer in an island nation with about half the population of Michigan, but his spiritual link to Detroit was forged when he dared to remake J Dilla’s Donuts with live instruments. Some would argue that touching the postmodernist instrumental masterpiece qualifies as sacrilege, but Toy is nothing if not audacious. Simpson and Toy have dubbed their partnership The Leonard Simpson Duo, and their album title bears the abbreviated initials LSD. The hallucinogenic name foreshadows the freaked-out sound: Trading in psychedelica, the union resembles a rap blog-era mash-up of ’90s street rhymes and ’60s San Francisco psych. It’s sometimes jarring, like spotting a time traveller strolling through the hippie-era Haight-Ashbury in Cross Colours.
Take the strangely haunting “Nobody,” which rides a sample of Marlon Williams and Aldous Harding’s 2018 duet “Nobody Gets What They Want Anymore” manipulated to sound like a ’60s folk ballad. Over washed-out guitar chords, Guilty shares space with an angelic vocal loop before making way for a sour guitar solo. There’s even a couple of instrumental interludes peppered throughout LSD, resembling a teenage band working through a fixation with the 13th Floor Elevators. When in the mood, Charles can cook up a meat-and-potatoes classic. On “G.U.I.L.T.Y.” he takes a spelled-out sample of Simpson’s name cuts it with heavy ambient and psychedelic tones, gifting the rapper an eponymous anthem in the vein of Snoop Dogg’s “Who Am I (What’s My Name)?” or Cam’ron’s “Killa Cam.” After years spent driving towards a more hardened street sound, Simpson is tested by Charles’s orchestration. It’s fair to say that Guilty’s writing isn’t always at its peak—“I’m inspired by hate/It makes me want to be great,” he says on “My Inspiration”—but there are moments when he is extremely fun. The swirling electronics and hard-knocking drums of “Bricks” gives Simpson a chance to unleash his blunted syllables gloriously. “Friends,” meanwhile, resurrects the famous hook from Whodini’s song of the same name over knocking drums and light keyboard licks. It’s pretty funny to hear a grizzled old 40-something rapper rant about the snakes in his friend group. It perhaps encapsulates LSD, a strange odyssey of opposing elements and counterintuitive choices.","The hardened Detroit traditionalist finds a surprising foil with New Zealand producer Leonard Charles.

Silver Tongue,Torres,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f6a079cce1d0008d84153/1:1/w_160/Silver%20Tongue_Torres.jpg,2020-02-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/torres-silver-tongue/,Merge,"In 2017, singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott released Three Futures, her most aggressive, starkly arranged, and provocative album to date. Despite its direct lyrics and instantly memorable visual aesthetic, Futures failed to meet the commercial expectations of her former label 4AD—maybe it didn’t stand out enough against records like St. Vincent’s Masseduction, or maybe it was too unflinching to be as accessible. Maybe a line like “I’m not a righteous woman, I’m more of an ass man” would have trouble reaching a mainstream audience. Scott wrote Silver Tongue, her fourth album as Torres, after the unceremonious fallout with her label left her feeling ambivalent towards her musical career. It would be several months before she started writing again, using her “cyclical muse” relationship with her girlfriend, the artist Jenna Gribbon, for an album about love as a stabilizing force. Her first album on Merge, Silver Tongue is less confrontational than Three Futures and less theatrical than 2015’s Sprinter (and less raw than her 2013 self-titled debut), but that makes sense given the circumstances that inspired the record. Scott self-produced this album out of necessity, due to a smaller budget but a wide-ranging vision for the record, taking equal influence from Gregorian chant music, Phil Collins’ percussive Tarzan soundtrack, and the in-vogue new-age legend Enya. Even as Scott’s ambition sometimes clashes with the content of the actual songs, Tongue is both her most intimate and eclectic album thus far. As long as the unrelenting stare that is her contralto takes prominence, it’s still Torres. Scott’s Southern roots have long informed her music ever since she recorded her debut in “swamp rock legend” Tony Joe White’s Nashville studio while she studied at Belmont University. She would occasionally reference her upbringing in songs like “Cowboy Guilt” off Sprinter (the clearest precursor to her current electronic direction) or in the video for “Three Futures.” While she wasn’t openly identifying as queer in 2013, Torres consistently used cowboy iconography as a means to a gender-defying end. Silver Tongue opener “Good Scare” distills her background into a single line about Tennessee pickup truck sex, and even if she acknowledges that “folks here in New York [will] get a kick out of” country motifs, her references are more meaningful than simple namechecking. “Dressing America” is even sweeter, a love song of extreme devotion (she sleeps in cowboy boots in case her lover needs her) featuring a mix of distant pedal steel and blown-out drum machines. That sweetness is the biggest change from her past records. Conflating an artists’ life with their music inevitably brings to mind the word “confessional,” a term used to implicitly dismiss a songwriter’s abilities to write beyond her own experience. Yet several songs here, including the penultimate track “Gracious Day,” unambiguously explore Scott’s relationship with Gribbon. The pleas of “Gracious Day” sound vulnerable, but Scott admitting, “I don’t want you going home anymore/I want you coming home” over interlocking guitar lines and eavesdropping synth flutes is as affecting as Three Futures was intimidating. The only weak lyrical moment on the whole album comes on the broader strokes of “Good Grief,” as the punchline “there’s no such thing as good grief” engulfs nearly a quarter of the five-minute runtime. The way the lead guitar gradually overtakes “Good Grief” is uniquely exciting on this largely muted record. The mood of Silver Tongue is caught between plaintive country, spacey alt-pop, and jagged indie rock, but in a way that leaves some of the most confident songs Scott has ever written feeling strangely inert. Lyrical highlight “Two of Everything” is a (more) sapphic “Jolene,” only from the person about to steal rather than the pleader: “To the one sharing my lover’s bed/It’s not my mission to be cruel/But she don’t light up the room/When she’s talking about you.” A would-be standout gets lost in an arrangement both undercooked and overwrought, uninspired drum patterns clashing with guitar synths, both drowning out the vocals. “Good Scare” has the opposite issue, gliding for three and a half minutes then fading out—it sounds pleasant, but the washy mix doesn’t serve the lyrics. The best production moments, like the chaotic, paranoid “Records of Your Tenderness” and soaring closer “Silver Tongue,” are the sound of someone powering through uncertainty until they find their direction again. To rediscover her path, Scott sings more openly about love, about her love, than she ever has previously. The high-concept “gregorian country” vision aside, what Silver Tongue really depicts is the need to find comfort in a period of transition—taking stock of what’s still there and holding onto it tightly. In the case of the video for “Dressing America,” it becomes literal; Torres carries Gribbon, wrapped in a blanket, through the streets of New York. That could be as good an album cover as the one Gribbon painted; Silver Tongue makes clear that Gribbon has carried Scott too.

Mystic Familiar ,Dan Deacon,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f5b8c3efc03000962bc3e/1:1/w_160/Mystic%20Familiar_Dan%20Deacon.jpg,2020-02-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dan-deacon-mystic-familiarandnbsp/,Domino,"Five years have passed since Gliss Riffer, Dan Deacon’s last proper album, which isn’t to suggest he hasn’t stayed busy. In the intervening years, Deacon has scored eight films, ranging from HBO’s Well Groomed to Rat Film, which explored Baltimore’s racial segregation as seen through the lens of the city’s rodent infestation. These projects allowed Deacon to further explore his compositional side and his electro-acoustic work, previously best heard on his 2012 album America. Mystic Familiar draws on these roots while retaining the manic, chewed-power-line indie pop that charged albums like Spiderman of the Rings and Bromst, infusing it all with a mystical inquiry into the nature of change and the mutability of nature. Those themes announce themselves with the very first track, “Become a Mountain,” which begins with just his unadulterated voice and intensifying piano chords. With every passing measure, new layers emerge—glissading keys, synth squiggles, then horns and strings—until the jittery song finally bursts into cinematic widescreen. It conveys all the thrills of Deacon’s best moments in the span of a few seconds. Deacon’s perspective on change and evolution comes from a daily meditation routine and the use of Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies cards—all part of a worthwhile attempt to get outside of himself. But for all of his newfound nuance as a film composer, some of the nagging aspects of Deacon’s previous efforts drag Mystic Familiar down. A Dan Deacon song generally toggles between an all-out gallop or a breakneck pace, suggesting at once the whirring arpeggiations of Philip Glass’s Glassworks and the froth of a basement mosh pit, to the point where they become undifferentiated. His go-to move remains dogpiling on all available sounds, always opting for a gushing dam break when a few drops would do the trick. The four-part “Arp” is breathless and dizzying, taking in free-jazz saxophone, pummeling floor toms, modular-synth squelches, and all manner of chipmunk voices, but by the end, exhaustion sets in. The exuberant “Sat By a Tree” might be a retelling of the tale of Siddhartha Gautama, who famously found enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree: “What would you cast into existence/If you contained the persistence to unwind,” Deacon sings, but it’s hard to unwind amid all the aural Mountain Dew that sprays forth from every element of the song. While Deacon’s instrumental command has demonstrably strengthened in the past few years, his lyrics have only gotten more pat, as evidenced by two songs near album’s end. “Fell Into the Ocean” is riddled with what resemble insipid inspirational Instagram captions, complete with garbled syntax, delivered in an infuriating cartoon voice: “Burn bright: The fire inside is brighter than you think” and “Feel free: First you must relax before transcend.” Far more effective is the instrumental “Weeping Birch.” Composed of Deacon’s synths and Disklavier Mark IV in conversation with the quick bow work of violinist Ruby Fulton and the drumming of Jeremy Hyman, it boasts an evocative mix of acoustic and electric timbres; in contrast to his maximalist tendencies, it’s perfectly measured. Highlighting the compositional maturity too often gets buried in Deacon’s work, it conveys acute emotional profundity without needing to say a word.

I Was Born Swimming,Squirrel Flower,by: Brady Gerber,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f3fc80fa1ee0008b99908/1:1/w_160/Born%20Swimming_Squirrel%20Flower.jpg,2020-02-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/squirrel-flower-i-was-born-swimming/,Polyvinyl,"Ella O’Connor Williams’ debut album as Squirrel Flower is a promising leap to a bigger label (Polyvinyl) that attempts to reach headier places than your typical indie rock record. It’s an experiment that does justice to Williams’ expanding vocal talent and her poetic way with sound, and it’s a bold departure from her previous material. The songwriting, though, suffers from a certain inattention. Album opener “I-80,” named after the famed freeway connecting California to New Jersey, begins with acoustic guitar, as a clear and focused-sounding Williams sings poetically about the failure of poetry: “I tried to be lyrical/But lyrics failed me.” Gradually, more instruments—louder and more rhythmic guitars, pounding drums, heavier bass—build toward a promised epic release, like testing to see how fast you’re willing to let yourself speed along an empty highway. But it never arrives; the song just stops. Williams spends the rest of the album repeating this cycle, speak-singing over electric riffs that sound like they were meant to be acoustic. It feels like playing air guitar to Leonard Cohen. The first single, “Red Shoulder,” is the best song, a “we inherit the earth” declaration that Williams seems to pull directly from the soil beneath her, even if it may or may not be about the end of a relationship. (“You’re one for healing/But I’m still reeling.”) While it’s one of two songs on the LP that was self-produced, the song’s appealing “road-trip indie” feel fits perfectly on an album produced by Gabe Wax (arguably best known for his work with the War on Drugs, Soccer Mommy, and Adrianne Lenker). Its guitar-riff-as-a-chorus recalls one of  Pavement’s songwriting tricks: using sounds, not words, to construct the catchiest moments of a song. It’s going to sound great live. If no other song approaches the high of “Red Shoulder,” there are plenty of isolated moments that come close. Williams is at her best when she’s confident enough to sit back and whisper. “Slapback” brings out her voice with a stark, blues-like chord progression that makes the phrase “If you slap me, I’ll slap you right back” more potent than any wall of sound could. “Eight Hours” renders guitar notes as delicate as wind chimes. “Streetlight Blues,” starts out like Dave Matthews Band’s “Cry Freedom” (not an insult; that guitar tone is great) and builds into a Derek Trucks-like solo that feels like a ray of light. And the closing title track deftly mirrors the melody from “I-80.” Williams’ most straightforward and ingratiating album as Squirrel Flower is 2015's Early Winter Songs From Middle America. That album’s standout track, “I Don’t Use a Trash Can,” proved that she can write a great chorus when she wants to. I Was Born Swimming suffers from its lack of them. Save for “I-80” and “Red Shoulder,” the album’s lyrics read more like poems set to music written after the fact. By side B, the disconnect becomes noticeable. The songs all have similar tempos and dynamics and lack clear centers, and the music starts to feel like an afterthought. When there is a chorus, like in “Honey, Oh Honey!” it’s the whole song, or it feels like a joke. At its most aimless, like on “Seasonal Affective Disorder,” the music just feels lost. It’s OK for songs not to have choruses, of course, and it’s OK to write songs that feel more like poems than, well, songs. But in doing so, Williams puts some maybe-unintentional distance between herself and the listener. I Was Born Swimming is her most expansive and professional-sounding record to date, and on the whole, does more right than wrong. But it’s an MFA of an album. As a project, it’s admirable. As an album, it leaves you cold.

Interplay,YlangYlang,by: Fred Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f4e689316b5000982a5c0/1:1/w_160/Interplay_Ylang%20Ylang.jpg,2020-02-03 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ylang-ylang-interplay/,Crash Symbols,"Since launching her solo project YlangYlang in 2012, Canadian producer Catherine Debard has split her time between gigs in Montreal’s subterranean experimental scene and the more formalized world of artists residencies, workshops and academic programming. Over time, her iridescent synth drones and sparse laptop beats have gelled into an abstract ambient pop that’s as equally suited to attentive gallery space performances as the kind of venues you have to direct message for their address. With her new album Interplay, Debard layers her raw electronics with live instruments, building introspective and sophisticated songs glazed in noise. Debard has worked alone for the majority of her YlangYlang discography, but here she invites a host of other musicians into the booth. The chopped bell samples and synth arpeggio that lay the foundation for “Dualities” open up to include squeaking cellos and stray clangs from a dulcimer-like instrument called a santur. Every timbre floats shapelessly, only fusing together when a wave of ugly static engulfs the mix. In “Our Provisional,” distant horns meander amid scrambled electronics before rising up in a moment of harmonic clarity. “Lost Realms,” one of several instrumentals, begins with a wash of textural noise that recedes into a tide pool of layered brass and woodwinds. YlangYlang’s latent new age tendencies also take on a new depth here. In the past, these inclinations manifested as superficial signifiers like a tape of self-described “therapeutic” improv jams (titled You might want to burn some sage, no less) or the soundtrack to a hypnosis meditation. While there are still references to healing ceremonies and neural pathways, the new age undertones on Interplay surface most when Debard approaches emotional turbulence from a place of spiritual calm. She circles back repeatedly to themes of solitude and separation, ultimately giving herself over to the will of the universe. In “Limitless” she walks alone through the city, sorting through the fallout of a recently ended relationship. The song transforms feelings of pain and rejection into near-euphoric surrender. Rather than wallowing, she processes her emotions and reconnects with herself outside the context of the expired romance: “I accept this shifting from the start/As a part of a greater process /I’m humble, I’m porous,” she sings, in the patient cadence of a mantra. Over the course of the record, Debard makes arrangements to return an ex’s house key, stifles screams of frustration in her tiny apartment, and writhes on the ground contemplating the end of civilization, grateful at every turn just to experience it all. For all its existential thrashing, Interplay exudes warmth. Even the harshest moments are grounded, exploring chaos but never spinning out.  Seeking out the beauty in an array of precarious feelings, Debard follows her contradictory impulses into the ether. As she asks with the album’s closing lyric, “What else is there to do?”","On her latest release, the Canadian electronic producer approaches emotional turbulence from a place of spiritual calm.

Laundry Service,Shakira,by: Isabelia Herrera,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e277fe7ccbc7d000948523d/1:1/w_160/laundryservice.jpg,2020-02-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shakira-laundry-service/,Epic,"In early 2001, Shakira was holed up on a farm in Uruguay, surrounded by her close family and a herd of cows. She’d just spent the last three years touring and performing across Latin America, establishing herself as a pop goddess with a rockera edge. Now she was convalescing in a quieter place, trying to write an album for an English-speaking audience that would somehow preserve the spirit of her trenchant pop-rock—all without forsaking the legion of Latin American fans that made her a pop luminary. It seemed to be an impossible task. Over the next year, Shakira would confront this challenge head-on, embracing the totality of transition. The video for “Underneath Your Clothes” was the Colombian singer’s self-aware introduction to Anglo audiences. In the opening scene, a thirsty journalist chases after her through the Palace Theater in Los Angeles, her newly blonde—but still tousled—braids silhouetted under an oversized Brixton cap. He asks, “Shakira, Shakira: What’s it like to crossover and sing in English?” The rockera launches into a breathless monologue in Spanish about music’s ability to create a spiritual connection between spectators and performers, about the poetry of music beyond the artificial borders of language. As she walks away, the reporter begs, “Oh, but in English!” It’s unlikely that such a calculated, performative exchange would appear in a Latinx artist’s English-language debut today. But back then, industry conventions dictated that Shakira be explicit in her approach. As she told MTV’s Making the Video, “I wanted that scene so badly in the video, because it’s something that is daily bread in my life lately.” Today, listeners around the globe are a bit smarter, less receptive to such overt maneuvers when artists are navigating new audiences. But we have only begun to challenge these stale tropes—and question the fantasy of “boom” narratives, where Latinx artists appear and disappear every few years based on their legibility to Anglo audiences. That clear-eyed intentionality at the beginning of “Underneath Your Clothes” was the crux for her metamorphosis into an international supernova. Long before the Beyoncé collaboration, the World Cup anthem, and the forays into watered-down reggaetón, Shakira Mebarak Ripoll proudly used her versatility in her favor. As she told Colombian daily El Tiempo in 2001, “Fusion offers me the opportunity to remove any type of label people want to place on me. It gives me freedom...I don’t want to be tied to a specific style and become the architect of my own prison.” She’d learned those lessons the hard way. Her first two albums, recorded as a young teenager and released only in Colombia, were comprised of lackluster, forgettable pop ballads. The records flopped, the former selling less than a thousand copies. At 15, Shaki moved from her hometown of Barranquilla to the capital of Bogotá, enduring an ill-fated stint on a telenovela. While her acting career didn’t pan out, she immersed herself in a wide range of U.S. and British rock styles, like the Cure, Led Zeppelin, and Aerosmith, all while maintaining her childhood love for belly dancing, a product of her Lebanese roots. In 1994, it seemed she’d finally found her calling. She recorded the original song “¿Dónde Estás Corazón??” for the Colombian rock compilation Nuestro Rock; the track’s success led her original record label Sony to allow her to write an entire rock album, which would become Pies Descalzos, released in 1995, followed by ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? in 1998. Pies Descalzos sold nearly 4 million copies worldwide, while ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? went multi-platinum. Both records spawned international tours and hit singles, securing Shakira’s future as a Latin American pop diva. The albums also served as harbingers of the mutability of Shakira’s pop identity. On ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? executive-produced by her then-manager Emilio Estefan, Shakira smashed up mariachi horns and traditional doumbek drums, developing a reputation as the irreverent leader of Latin American rockeras, one who paraded her trumpeting yodel over songs about heartbreak and allusions to government corruption. Through intimate, rhapsodic lyrics, Shakira captured the attention of clever sadgirls across Latin America and its diaspora. But it was only a matter of time until she’d have to accommodate two legions of fans—one that worshipped her for her candid, political introspection, and another that demanded she conform. After the release of a Grammy-winning MTV Unplugged album in 2000, Shakira was ready for something new. In early 2000, Freddy DeMann, the force behind Madonna and Michael Jackson’s careers, took over her management. Sony suggested she recruit Gloria Estefan—the pop powerhouse and wife of her ex-manager—to translate the lyrics of ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? into an English album for her U.S. debut. All of these maneuvers fell squarely into the pop crossover formula of the early 2000s: appoint a well-known manager in the Anglo world, hire the Estefans to be involved somehow, and record English versions of already wildly popular songs. But after some tutoring, Shaki grew more comfortable with English, and she called off the translated version of ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? to write a brand new collection of songs instead. Though she knew how to speak conversational English, Shakira wanted to cultivate a more literary approach to composition, so she studied the work of Walt Whitman and Leonard Cohen. She spent a year writing at the farm in Uruguay, as well as a rented house in the Bahamas, creating new material that would eventually make its way to Laundry Service. In the fall of 2001, the album finally saw the light of day. Opener “Objection” is a plea for the collapse of a love triangle, blending B-52’s guitar licks with Argentine tango’s bandoneón. The anti-drug hymn “Poem to a Horse” weaves a fervid horn section with riffs seemingly lifted from a Nirvana B-side. “Te Dejo Madrid” features a gnarly harmonica solo alongside Shakira’s trembling vibrato, which was once described as the “bleating of a goat” by her second-grade classmates. This brand of musical pastiche has garnered Shaki acclaim, but it’s also made her the target of satire. Tracks like “Ready for the Good Times” demonstrate the pitfalls of such collage—a feel-good hook like “I’m ready for the good times/Now that I’m not alone” isn’t enough to redeem the uninspired, disco-laced beat or the sticky chorus. It is in her meditations on erotic power that Shakira excels. “The One,” “Fool,” and “Underneath Your Clothes” put her diaristic sensibilities on full display. She draws on her own romantic torment, crafting raw paeans to her lover, or heartfelt reflections on surrendering herself to intimacy. Through power ballads and post-grunge vengeance, Shakira empties her body, harnessing anguish and devotion and tracing a blueprint for so many young people’s journeys of femme self-discovery. And while many of these songs iterated on similar ideas, her inimitable warble threaded all of these musical endeavors together, often leaving an even greater imprint in English. Between these album cuts and her hits, Laundry Service is a formidable compendium of Shakira’s sonic and corporeal world. But it was “Whenever, Wherever” that transformed Shaki. An ode to her then-partner Antonio de la Rúa, the son of the deposed Argentine president, “Whenever, Whenever” immortalized her capacity to appeal to pop and rock audiences alike. The song incorporated Andean instruments like the quena pan flute and charango strings into the pop world, foreshadowing her career as a perennial shapeshifter. The video seemed to air on a loop on MTV; in it, Shakira belly-danced in an earthy halter top, sporting blonde tresses and writhing in the mud—prompting all of us to replicate her moves in our own bedroom mirrors. The Anglo press had no idea how to parse an artist like Shakira. They drew endless, flimsy comparisons to both Britney Spears and Alanis Morrissette, which confused even Shakira at the time. Her name—Arabic for “full of grace” or “full of gratitude”—produced tongue-in-cheek but abhorrent one-liners. “Shakira, not to be confused with Shaquille O’Neal, ‘Shock the Monkey’ or anything involving your moneymaker or the shaking thereof...” went one Rolling Stone piece; Entertainment Weekly claimed the album was “enough to incite another anti-WTO rally.” Many publications were preoccupied with Shaki’s lyrical idiosyncrasies. Reviewers described her English-language lyrics as “imponderable,” “odd,” and “curious,” and were disapproving of her eccentric “non sequiturs” and “lyrical clunkers.” Of particular frustration among critics was the couplet, “Lucky that my breasts are small and humble/So you don’t confuse them with mountains” from “Whenever, Wherever.” A 2001 Rolling Stone review stated she sounded “downright silly” in English, claiming that her magic was “lost in translation.” In the late ’90s and early ’00s, when the careers of artists like Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Marc Anthony were in full bloom, it was difficult for Anglo critics to decipher the differences between Latin Americans and U.S.-born Latinos, who grew up speaking and writing in English. Today, this obsessive focus on language feels archaic and embarrassing; the internet has since expanded the boundaries of musical consumption and helped to erode long-held myths around language barriers. But the album’s mixed reception is evocative of the pressures Latinx artists faced 20 years ago. As one reviewer from The Guardian observed, it falls on critics to open themselves up to the lyrical sensibilities of Spanish: “Ripoll is not struggling with the intricacies of English, just expressing herself in a singular and puzzling way. Good for her.” Shaki seemed in on the joke, too; in 2001, she told El Tiempo, “Sometimes I say typical phrases in Spanish in English-language songs, and for Americans, that proves novel and interesting. That makes the process entertaining.” Despite some lukewarm critical reception, the album fared well commercially, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. But it also introduced a deeply racialized debate around Shakira’s malleability and authenticity in the pop industry, one that captured tensions and conflicting desires between Latinx, Latin American, and Anglo audiences. Among her diehard Latin American fans, Laundry Service had its share of detractors. Many labeled her a sellout, claiming her newly blonde hair, transition to English, and new look meant she was abandoning her essence as an incisive rockera and transforming into a whiter, sexier version of herself, one palatable for Anglo audiences. A 2001 story on Shakira for the Los Angeles Times cited a message board in which a fan wrote, “She’s got to dye her hair blond and bare her body—which she said a decent woman would never do—just to succeed in the United States. She doesn’t care about what we’re going through. She just cares about conquering the Anglo market.” At the time, Shakira dismissed the criticism, telling the Post, “Maybe people think I dyed my hair blond to meet a certain requirement of the Anglo market, but I didn’t. The first time I dyed it, I dyed it red. I just like to go to extremes.” But for the Shaki devotees, Latin America’s pop queen was no longer for the people—she was transforming into somebody else, for somebody else. Like many young women in the music industry before her, Shakira faced constant sexualization and exotification. Anglo audiences no doubt drooled at the sight of a writhing woman with an accent in the “Wherever, Whenever” video. But, as cultural critic Pier Dominguez notes, some have argued Shakira exploited these tropicalizing tropes of Latinas, buying into collective fantasies for greater visibility, even as she put her musical eclecticism on display. These kinds of authenticity debates are inscribed in the very fabric of pop music (think Madonna and voguing, or Miley Cyrus and twerking, or countless other stars). For decades, white U.S. artists have mined black aesthetics for “creative inspiration,” obstructing their originators from the credit and visibility they deserve. Shakira may have been using the structures of white U.S. pop against itself, but that is hardly subversive—her identity as a white, blonde Latina facilitated her explosive entry into the English-language market. Her whiteness allowed her to play off and against these tropes, particularly through the mediums of movement and dance, furthering her ascent to the upper echelons of pop, where black and brown Latinas were denied access. Still, Laundry Service helped forge a path for other Latina stars to follow—releasing a mainstream pop album with both Spanish and English-language tracks no longer seemed unthinkable. It also laid the groundwork for Shakira’s legacy as a pop chameleon; every new reinvention, whether it was the electro-pop ditties of She Wolf, the merengue-rock thumpers of Sale El Sol, or the soca-tinged “Waka Waka,” can be traced back to the hybrid vision initiated on Laundry Service. In 2020, as conversations about equity and representation seep into new pop cultural spheres, listeners might interpret this kind of musical tourism as appropriation. Crossover stories like Shakira’s seem like a relic of the past, a transparent marketing tactic laid bare by the music industry’s ceaseless grind. Even though we exist in an increasingly globalized landscape, we’re still consumed by the same feel-good narratives of cross-cultural exchange, where the mainstream success of a Latinx artist is lauded as an antidote to political and social oppression. Look no further than the collective reception of “Despacito,” which many celebrated as a salve for Latinx communities (excuse me while my eyes roll into the back of my head) in our endlessly xenophobic political climate. Laundry Service exhorts us to rethink the utility of the crossover narrative—who it is designed for and who it liberates, if anyone.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

High Road,Kesha,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f39bf73b23000081e7d45/1:1/w_160/High%20Road_Kesha.jpg,2020-02-01 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kesha-high-road/,Kemosabe,"Kesha is a vocal supporter of underdogs and outsiders; she stands up for LBGTQ rights, women’s rights, the environment, songwriters, and gun control in a time when all are being threatened. She sews every seam of her brand with inclusivity and empowerment (“keep glowing, ur a fuckin rainbow,” she tweeted to a fan who came out as transgender). After years embroiled in a legal battle with her former producer, Dr. Luke, whom she accused of physical abuse and sexual assault, Kesha transformed her pain into the country-rock reckoning Rainbow and an emotional 2018 Grammys performance supporting the #TimesUp movement. In her colorful universe, you are believed and accepted, doused in glitter and moral support, perpetually reminded that neither tragedy nor socio-economic status define you, and encouraged to be your baddest bitch self. It’s hard not to root for Kesha. Yet very little of this determination, maturity, or depth comes through on her fourth album, High Road, which regresses from Rainbow’s clear-eyed courage to Animal-era party-pop. It’s a tough pivot after everything that’s gone down, and she recycles the same innocuous frameworks she wielded a decade ago: that getting high and sleeping around don’t make you a bad person, that women are multidimensional (“You’re the party girl/You’re the tragedy/But the funny thing is I’m fucking everything,” she sings). Triteness aside, it would’ve been relatively easy to get behind an album of unfettered Kesha revelry, but High Road feels strained, scattershot, and loaded with tension, like someone trying to portray freedom and free-spiritedness–even a recovered sense of identity–who isn’t quite there yet. “My Own Dance,” effectively a “TiK ToK” sequel, is the album’s closest thing to a centerpiece and lays out the challenge she faced: “So the internet called and it wants you back/But could you kinda rap and not be so sad?” Kesha is correct that our demands are unfair, but then she goes and fulfills them, insisting that she’s conforming by choice (“Hey! I don’t do that dance! I only do my own dance!”). This puts the listener in a confusing position: Are we to feel guilty or celebrate? It might be less uncomfortable if it felt like she’d made peace with her decision, but the song is coated in indignation: “I feel like I’m nothing/Somedays I am everything/Caught up in my feelings/Bitch, shut up and sing.” This sense of uncertainty permeates the album, making it feel distant and erratic. Kesha has always covered a range of moods and styles—deep confessionals, party bops, twangy folk songs, bits of goofy banter—but High Road dials this up to an almost frenetic state, yo-yoing between tear-jerking ballads, overwrought empowerment anthems, and head-scratching moments of ironic nonsense. For every bizarre one-off (the chiptune inspired “Birthday Suit,” the lascivious “Kinky,” or the oddly childlike “BFF”), there’s a frothy, generic pop anthem pulling her back to the middle: “Little Bit of Love,” co-written by Nate Ruess, feels entirely anonymous. She seems determined not to let you get too close. Enveloping emotional moments are often interrupted by puzzling production choices and lyrical contradictions. “Raising Hell,” a spirited ode to celebrating and forgiving yourself, featuring Big Freedia, is deflated by an insufferable horn synth that blares like a Major Lazer song. “Shadow,” an immersive piano ballad that exhibits her empathy and sheer vocal strength, is punctuated by a sour, flippant interlude (“If you don’t like me you can suck my—”, she chants). Even the title track, which attempts to frame her reaction to trauma as considered and mature, is itself defensive and sarcastic, stumbling from escapism into stoned denial. This is what makes the album’s hard-partying premise so difficult to accept: It doesn’t feel like moving on, it feels like running away. There’s no question Kesha is capable of assured, sincere truth-telling. “Resentment,” a stunning confessional featuring Brian Wilson and Sturgill Simpson, is so personal and emotionally generous that it actually feels healing, leaving you to marvel at how arresting her voice is when you can actually hear it. The lightly mystical “Cowboy Blues,” which mentions her three cats, therapist, and tarot card reader, feels relaxed and spontaneous, as if she’s writing it right in front of you. When it swells into an all-together-now dive bar singalong, lit up by whistling ooh-oohs and sha-la-las, you remember that Kesha is the rare songwriter who can funnel big, existential ideas like destiny and chance into the casual story of a night out in Nashville. These aren’t hell-raising, stadium-sized bangers about blacking out and acting up, but they are at least about her. As anyone who has wrestled with self-acceptance understands, often the most rebellious thing you can do is be your unvarnished self.

Scis,Oval,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2f00d46fa96c0008414e8c/1:1/w_160/scis_oval.jpg,2020-02-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oval-scis/,Thrill Jockey,"Markus Popp’s Oval revival has now outlasted his original mid-’90s run, when classics like 94 Diskont brought “glitch” into the electronic-music lexicon. Back in those days, Popp was hesitant to even identify himself as a musician, but when he returned in 2010, it was with a fresh interest in composition and performance, as well as a new perspective on his tendency to pulling music apart. Scis, his first release since 2016’s Popp, takes his second act to new levels of density and playfulness. Popp’s recent discography has evolved like one of his famously skipping samples, doubling back and repeating in quick distortions. 2010’s gargantuan comeback O showed off the busiest Oval arrangements to date alongside 50 brief fragments worked into those preceding tracks. He then scrambled the O material (and its accompanying Oh EP) with earlier work for the unique OvalDNA compilation, before heading to Brazil to reinterpret all three releases with singers and jazz musicians as Calidostopia!. “Recycled” rarely sounds like a compliment in music, but Popp’s methods have produced undeniably rich compost. Scis initially picks up where its relatively club-oriented 2016 predecessor left off, but gradually unspools into something new. Opener “Twirror” builds twisting piano lines and unruly synth bleats into a slightly conventional climax of crashing drums. It’s a trick Popp repeats, but also improves upon, on subsequent tracks. “Fluoresso” and “Impecco” navigate similar ascents more gracefully; they open with Popp’s familiar CD skips, but never rely on them, as new elements keep entering the frame. The result hits a sweet spot where Popp is essentially playing live alongside a “band” of classic Oval loops. He mostly abandons the vocals that made Popp feel ready for a dancefloor, but they find new forms on tracks like “Pushhh,” as garbled voice loops compete with one another over twinkling percussion and strings. Prepared piano and a pitched-down vocal moan form the backbone of aggressive standout “Mikk.” “Improg” is built around eerily airless vocal snippets and prepared piano that recalls Oneohtrix Point Never’s Age Of. It’s a great example of Popp’s talent for making ambitious experiments sound both playful and coy. In the 2010s, plenty of Oval’s ’90s contemporaries reasserted their place in different ways. Aphex Twin’s long, mysterious absence ended when he returned with material not too different from where he left off. Popp’s current course feels more akin to Autechre’s, though their current music couldn’t be more different. Since 2001’s Confield, released the same year Oval’s first iteration ended, Sean Booth and Rob Brown have pushed their own process with a tunnel vision that’s certainly had ups and downs, but led to transcendent contemporary work. Markus Popp isn’t quite there yet, but Scis proves that he’s still following his own path.

Land of No Junction,Aoife Nessa Frances,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20df19d1c15700099570c9/1:1/w_160/LandOfNoJunction_Aoife.jpg,2020-02-01 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aoife-nessa-frances-land-of-no-junction/,Ba Da Bing,"The title of Aoife Nessa Frances’ debut album, Land of No Junction, is the product of a happy accident: While speaking to her guitarist/co-producer Cian Nugent about his childhood travels in Wales, she misheard his reference to a train station named Llandudno Junction. But that fortuitous error says a great deal about the Irish songwriter’s methodology: Land of No Junction abounds with deceptively serene serenades and sleights of hand. Drawing from an eclectic array of record-collector reference points—’60s psych-pop, ’70s art-rock, Tropicália, avant-garde orchestration—the album puts you on familiar footing before gradually changing the scenery, blurring the line between the real and the imagined. When we first meet Frances, she’s pondering the passage of time through the image of withered flora on “Geranium”—a song that demonstrates how patient, attentive nurturing can spur splendorous growth. What begins as a skeletal drum-machine beat eventually yields a melange of rippling guitar lines, hypnotic organ hums, and backmasked swirls, as if Frances were trying to harvest a Spiritualized song inside a terrarium. It’s the first of many sublime musical mutations, but the uncanny allure of Land of No Junction has as much to do with the surprising ways Frances’ lyrics shift from cryptic musings to clear-eyed critique. Her voice shines like a headlight in fog, luminous and ambiguous in equal measure—though, like fellow pastoral poet Cate Le Bon, her placid diction belies a more restless spirit. “Geranium” and its follow-up, “Blow Up,” share a similar psych-folk melody, but take it to dramatically different places, both musically and topically. Written a few years before Ireland legalized abortion in 2018, “Blow Up” is less an impassioned defense of a woman’s right to choose than a comment on the more mundane ways patriarchy exerts its control. “I’m about to lose my mind,” Frances sings, before concluding, “Tired of being human/Lesser than man.” Her tone is more resigned than enraged, but the increasingly antsy arrangement—courtesy of a rib-poking bongo beat and Ailbhe Nic Oireachtaigh’s stabbing strings—reveals the beast stirring within. Land of No Junction is the sort of record that seems to acquire more confidence and force with each passing track. “Here in the Dark” is a powerful portrait of a relationship at the crossroads, the uncertainty in Frances’ voice manifesting in a seasick, symphonic-rock groove that recalls Air’s Virgin Suicides soundtrack; “Libra” delivers an intimate address amid the strobe-lit delirium of a go-go bar dancefloor circa 1966. But those are mere warm-ups for the emotional bloodletting of “Heartbreak,” which frames real-life drama as ’70s soft-rock fantasia with the same grace and gravitas as Weyes Blood’s Titanic Rising. In this light, the elegiac title track isn’t merely the record’s comedown closer, but the nocturnal sanctuary where Frances can retreat when the waking world becomes too much to bear. “Leave me with this dream, and wake me after dark,” she sings, just as Oireachtaigh’s exquisite string arrangement sweeps her to slumberland. It’s a temporary peace, to be sure, but as Frances demonstrates throughout Land of No Junction, the smallest, simplest pleasures can have lasting effects.

Have We Met,Destroyer,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28c603e540c400084fdddf/1:1/w_160/destroyer.jpg,2020-01-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/destroyer-have-we-met/,Merge / Dead Oceans,"Spend enough time listening to Destroyer and the world will start to resemble a Dan Bejar song—when a bon vivant slips in an unexpected curse word; when a friend tries to place a melody by humming the guitar part; when a common phrase twists into a surrealist riddle via an AutoCorrect mishap. Since he first emerged in the mid-’90s, Bejar has reflected the world in these abstract and broken-sounding ways: “Sing the least poetic thing you can think of,” he recently said of his preferred method of songwriting, “and try to make it sound beautiful.” As cerebral as Bejar’s work can be, the state of mind with which his music is most commonly associated is drunkenness: the predilection to spew nonsense, the bravado in convincing the room you’re fine, even as you spill wine all over yourself. While he once accompanied these gestures with rambly, glammy folk-rock, Bejar has spent the past decade mining the milder tones of sophisti-pop, soft rock, and adult contemporary: genres so removed from youthful abandon that even speaking their names has a somewhat sobering effect. It’s music that feels connected to middle age, and Bejar has navigated his 40s using its muted horns and lush synths to accompany visions as fragmented and nightmarish as ever. On 2011’s Kaputt, a career peak that served as an unlikely commercial breakthrough, these textures might have seemed like a left turn; by now, it’s just where we expect to find Bejar—in luxurious settings, skeptical, eyeing the exits. Compared to 2017’s ken, a gothic-sounding record distinguished by chillier tones and pared-down lyrics, his masterful new album Have We Met sets a larger canvas. Produced by bandmate John Collins, the music is sweeping and bold and surprising. “Cue Synthesizer” is the first Destroyer song to feature a prominent slap-bass part; the title track is so wispy and vaporous that Bejar’s voice never actually appears in it. Same goes for the closing moments of the record: a hellish coda of buzzing samples, like a demonic YouTube tab left open by mistake. “Just look at the world around you,” goes a pivotal lyric. “Actually, no, don’t look!” The music is filled with similar retractions: It’s his most inviting, embracing record, until suddenly it’s not. The more elaborate and professional his arrangements have grown, the more Bejar has withdrawn. His presence has grown so dry and distant that there are moments when Have We Met has the ghostly quality of a posthumous release. Coming from a songwriter who litters his lyric sheets with exclamation marks, the words to “The Man in Black’s Blues” are downright haiku-esque. (“When you’re looking for Nothing/And you find Nothing/Is more beautiful/Than anything you ever knew.”) In the extraordinary “Kinda Dark,” he delivers his apocalyptic verses in a distracted whisper over subdued electronic scenery. When the drums hit and the electric guitar attacks out of nowhere, it feels genuinely startling: the appearance of the looming threat he’s been slowly backing away from the whole time. This sense of unease spans the record, making uptempo songs like the glittery “It Just Doesn’t Happen” and the soaring “Crimson Tide” sound like dispatches from a doomed adventure. Other songs exist in the cloud of smoke that’s left behind. “The Television Music Supervisor” is one of them—an eerie, ambient ballad narrated from the deathbed of a music-industry gatekeeper, haunted by regret. It’s not the first time that Bejar has addressed someone in his field—“Don’t be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves,” he once told his critics—but its spectral atmosphere makes it feel like a different, darker type of in-joke. “I can’t believe...” go its closing lyrics, fading out on an unresolved final scene. As of late, Bejar seems to think a lot about getting older. “I feel like the time-release poison could still be inside of me,” he once joked. “I’m ready to completely lose sight of all that is good.” The favored concerns of aging writers—wisdom, directness, sentimentality—remain anathema to his work. Other than the proudly synthetic music that accompanies it, what separates Bejar’s writing from peers like John Darnielle or Bill Callahan is a refusal to follow any kind of emotional arc. You don’t relate to a Destroyer song so much as you find yourself mysteriously pulled inside of it, drawing connections and finding meaning on your own. The effect is elusive but visceral. “It’s called love,” he sings in “University Hill,” moments after listing, one-by-one, the scattered remains of a hacked-up body. And yet, he can still aim for the heart. In “The Raven,” one of the best songs he’s ever written, the tone feels personal, even nostalgic. That is, it’s precisely the kind of thing we expect from our master songwriters nearing 50—his own twisted way of saying: seize the day while you still can. “Come out, come out, wherever you are/But you don’t/The dead don’t come out,” he cautions. A chilling enough message on its own, but then he continues: “The dead twist and shout/In an invisible world/The Grand Ole Opry of Death is breathless.... Breathless.” Now, we’re back in his domain—an unlikely chorus, a couple puns—as he sweeps us from the world we know toward some strange afterlife, where the audience is as bewildered as us and the artist on stage has never sounded more at home.

Be Up a Hello,Squarepusher,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e288b57e540c400084fdda5/1:1/w_160/squarepusher.jpg,2020-01-31 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/squarepusher-be-up-a-hello/,Warp,"The cultural cachet of the leftfield electronic music of the 1990s is higher now than it’s been in years. Aphex Twin headlines festivals; Autechre set the internet alight with radio appearances and DAT tapes of unreleased material; younger generations’ output is peppered with copious references to acts like Plaid and B12. But what about Squarepusher? Tom Jenkinson was a huge part of the original IDM boom, not to mention one of Warp’s core artists during its late-’90s golden era. His albums Hard Normal Daddy (1997), the jazzy Music Is Rotted One Note (1998) and even Go Plastic (2001) are  invoked in reverential terms, along with his early records for Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label. But Squarepusher’s recent output hasn’t been greeted with the same kind of collective enthusiasm that Aphex and Autechre’s mature work has received. There is one key difference between his career and those of his contemporaries: Squarepusher never really went away. Where some of his peers have taken extended breaks or remained shrouded in mystery, Jenkinson has been steadily releasing music for the past 25 years. He has kept taking risks: fronting a band (Shobaleader One), soundtracking a children’s television program (Cbeebies), collaborating with Japanese robots (Squarepusher x Z-Machines), dipping his toes into EDM (Ufabulum), and dazzling us with his fretwork (Solo Electric Bass 1). Jenkinson’s experimental impulses are commendable, but not all of these creative dalliances were successful, and he’s never disappeared long enough for fans to forget the duds and fall back on their warm memories of his glory days. Be Up a Hello, the first proper Squarepusher full-length in five years, explicitly nods to his earliest days as a producer. Abandoning the custom software he’d developed over the course of his career, Jenkinson constructed the album using a small fleet of vintage hardware, including a Commodore VIC-20, a personal computer first released in the early 1980s. Due to the nature of his setup, many of Be Up a Hello’s tracks were recorded in a single take, giving the album a loose, freewheeling feel that suits the music’s generally manic nature. Frantic breakbeats are at the core of Be Up a Hello, which is littered with echoes of classic jungle, hardcore, and drum’n’bass. During particularly intense moments, that energy even tips into ’90s drill’n’bass territory, most notably on the unrelenting “Speedcrank,” whose full-throttle hijinks will likely prove exhausting for all but the most amped of ravers. More palatable is the berzerk “Mekrev Bass,” a showcase for glitchy 8-bit chaos. Several cuts harken back to old-school video-game soundtracks; with its bright chords and bouncy rhythm, “Oberlove” sounds like something unearthed from a wholesome Yoshi title, while the neon-streaked twists and turns of the densely populated “Hitsonu” would be perfect for the final stages of a complex puzzle game. That kind of nerdy nostalgia is baked into Be Up a Hello, although the presence of colorful club rippers like “Nervelevers” and “Terminal Slam”—both of which pair crunchy acid blips with frenzied breakbeat assaults—ensures that the LP is more than a quaint trip down memory lane. “Vortrack” heads down a darker path, but the scattered rhythm, intermittently slipping into a dubsteppy half-time cadence, gives the song a drunken, meandering feel. (Much better was Jenkinson’s own “Vortrack (Fracture Remix)” from last year, which distilled the mayhem of the original single into a hard-stepping jungle cut with a gooey, gut-rumbling bassline.) Jenkinson wisely puts the breakbeat onslaught on pause for “Detroit People Mover” and LP closer “80 Ondula,” both of which are beatless synth excursions. Employing a symphonic flair that’s equal parts Wendy Carlos and John Carpenter, the former evokes ’70s sci-fi film scores, while the latter’s creeping tones are better suited for a dingy horror flick. A world away from his signature drum attack, they nevertheless represent some of Be Up a Hello’s most compelling material. For years, Squarepusher fans have been clamoring for Jenkinson to get back to his roots, and Be Up the Hello is the closest he’s come to his ’90s self in quite some time. With its glitchy bedlam and mischievous spirit, the album does offer moments of gleeful chaos, yet it’s hard to shake the feeling that it’s a facsimile, a simulacrum. The LP feels more like a technical exercise than a genuine outburst of creative spontaneity. It too often feels like Jenkinson is applying his virtuosic talents to covering his own back catalog—something he’s literally done before with the Shobaleader One project—and the overload of nostalgia keeps the album from feeling fresh. As thrilling as those vintage Squarepusher records were (and still are), it wasn’t necessary that Jenkinson make another one.

If I Am Only My Thoughts,Loving,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e29ca9cfd91bb000807b0a0/1:1/w_160/loving.jpg,2020-01-31 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loving-if-i-am-only-my-thoughts/,Last Gang,"The members of Loving bonded during summers spent planting trees in the Canadian wilderness, giving them an origin story like Vampire Weekend meeting at Columbia or Justin Vernon retreating to a Wisconsin cabin to make For Emma, Forever Ago: it’s so vivid you can imagine the band’s music without hearing a single note. For the British Columbia trio, that means simple, sun-dappled folk-pop, like Whitney after a thimbleful of magic mushrooms. Their full-length debut If I Am Only My Thoughts radiates approachability. It’s easy to imagine these songs beaming from a covered porch or a bandstand in your local park, brought to life by the scruffy guys who tend bar around the corner. After stumbling into a large online fanbase with an EP that collected little more than polished demos, David Parry and Jesse Henderson — the band’s third member is Henderson’s brother, Lucas — retreated to tiny Gabriola Island to write, setting up a recording studio in a home that had belonged to the Hendersons’ late grandmother. It’s hard to imagine a more idyllic setting in which to make music. The British Columbia seaside is as temperate as Canada gets, with towering evergreen forests edging up to serene beaches and sandstone sculptures, and If I Am Only My Thoughts reflects that beauty through its clean, gentle melodies and lack of clutter. The album also radiates a charming spontaneity, a benefit of the band’s decision to record to tape without a great deal of editing or looping; when “A Mirror for Two Voices” begins with a false start and a quick count into its fingerpicked intro, the band feels close enough to touch. There are moments when it feels like Loving might be capable of offering more than pleasantries. Opener “Visions” is the band’s sturdiest composition, with a slippery structure and an arrangement that slowly adds layers: snappy drums, a glowing Wurlitzer, plush piano chords, liquid guitar leads. (It also features the album’s most compelling lyrics, including a first verse full of clear, definitive images that sounds like an inversion of Big Thief’s “Not.”) The title track begins with sleepy tambourine and twinkling melodies; when the drums finally kick in after a minute, it feels like throwing open barn doors to flood a space with light. And the meditative “Only She Knows” coasts through its final minute on a series of rippling riffs that crest and recede like deep breaths. All of these highlights feature a moment in which a song’s essence snaps into focus. In many other spots, however, the music simply lacks urgency. There’s no tension simmering beneath the placid surface, no friction to make the compositions stick. The vocals are invariably heavy-lidded and stick to a narrow range, with no harmonies in sight; closing passages meander without introducing new ideas or cutting loose; the lyrics strike a yearning, inquisitive note but mostly settle into existential word salad. Female companions are mentioned every once in a while, formless as ghosts: “You’re standing in the mirror, I’m watching you get dressed,” murmurs Henderson on “A Mirror for Two Voices.” “Your voice is soft and certain as you fumble with the buttons on your chest.” The result is never less than amiable, but it also tends to slide past, like a pleasant daydream or an afternoon shadow. No one is demanding that Parry and the Henderson brothers demonstrate more ambition than that, but there’s enough here to justify digging deeper. If this album represents their first attempt to move beyond demos, then Loving’s next challenge is to add some substance.","The debut LP from this Canadian folk-pop trio radiates immediacy and approachability.

Keeping Up Appearances,Basic Plumbing,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28c723fd91bb000807b062/1:1/w_160/basicplumbing_keepingup.jpg,2020-01-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/basic-plumbing-keeping-up-appearances/,Basic Plumbing,"There aren’t enough queer people in this world and we don’t listen enough to the ones who are here. So when one of them leaves us—as did Patrick Doyle, who passed away in March 2018, just 32—the loss is huge, with its own special echoes. Doyle had spent at least half his quick life in bands with casual indie characters that inspired fast devotion. In the post-Pastels, Belle and Sebastian-besotted Scotland where he grew up, Doyle jangled his guitar in cult bands Dot to Dot, the Royal We, and the Sexy Kids, and strummed the bass along with Franz Ferdinand’s Paul Thomson in Correcto; in 2006, B&S immortalized his charisma, not to mention his handsome face, across the back of their The Life Pursuit album. Doyle taught himself drums and then went on to pursue fame with bandmate Roxanne Clifford in London as Veronica Falls, whose two rather accomplished albums of lush, lovely indie rock, released by bookish noise-pop heroes Slumberland, sounded like a platonic 21st century Mamas & the Papas where the dreams never end. They were one of those bands that if you heard them, you loved them, but too few ever did. Ever on the move, Doyle spent time in New York, Los Angeles, and London, releasing his first real solo record in 2016, as Boys Forever. If you were ever in a gay bar with a decent jukebox in any of those cities back then, you likely met him and wanted to get to know him better. Insouciant and stylish as its creator, Boys Forever repositioned classic indie verse/chorus/verse into queer forms. “Bent music for bent people,” Doyle called it; at its best, it seemed to identify musical corners the heroic gay men who’d come before him had painted themselves into—the endless genre drag of the Magnetic Fields, the so-ironic-it’s-earnest (or is the other way around?) productions of the Hidden Cameras—and just sort of breeze past them. Harder than it sounds. Just after the album’s release, Doyle relocated full-time to L.A., living with his husband, the journalist Max Padilla; developing a body of work as a photographer; and writing songs via email with Helen Skinner, a bassist and member of Boys Forever’s touring lineup. A year later, Padilla died. Doyle released a single, “As You Disappear,” in which his boyish voice is weathered and worn, a cold wind bothering the trees. “And now everyone I know, I used to know,” he sings. And then Doyle was dead, too. Keeping Up Appearances, released under the moniker Basic Plumbing, collects the tracks Doyle and Skinner finished. Their beauty is immediate, accessible, and, at least for the moment, almost inextricable from all the loss surrounding them. “As You Disappear” starts things off, a gut punch; then “Lilac” tries to start the party, but its organ lick just wells up “96 Tears” while Doyle sings “I hear the voices in my head/No, I don’t want to hear them in my dreams” in an uncanny evocation of Kurt Cobain’s clenched snarl. The enraged ennui of Nirvana is all over this record: in the way the guitars rattle beneath the beams of his dread-filled voice in “Sunday,” or wrap around his voice like a sweater that will never be warm enough in closer “Strangers,” the bleakest song in Doyle’s catalog. Doyle saves his keen ear for harmonies for lines like “He’s bad news, baby,” in the achingly sweet “Fantasy.” But the sour “Bad Mood” weaponizes melody, as two vocal lines intertwine, circling each other like snakes. One sings “I won’t be in a bad mood anymore.” The other? “I just didn’t think it would happen.” Neither wins. The mobilizing swish Doyle lent Veronica Falls fuels the title track, but Doyle seems to feel like he’s faking the verve. “It’s all in your head/When you say/The things that you said,” he sings, barely mustering up polysyllables, “And it’s all over/Keeping up appearances.” It’s rock’n’roll as rumination, jittery and damaged, the sound of self-recrimination and self-possession doubling and collapsing in on itself. It’s an earworm and a heartbreak. Keeping Up Appearances arrives with a reprint of Max, a book of Doyle’s photos published just after his death, all fuzzy sunlight and boners in boxer shorts. The photos look like these new songs sound: assuredly retro, gazing back to both the ’90s and the ’60s; charming, if a bit too charmed by their own self-deprecation—sexy but somehow disembodied. Distant, detached. It’s a testament that, in his awful absence, others keep pushing his work forward. Veronica Falls’ Marion Herbain helped bring Max into the world, and into the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of Art. Skinner and Doyle’s family have made a place for Basic Plumbing, and have pledged proceeds to L.A.’s LGBT Centre and CALM, the Campaign Against Living Miserable, a UK organization working to prevent suicide. Queer people keep disappearing. But to the great fortune and comfort of those who remain—and the great benefit of everyone else—Doyle left records of his life. They live on.","Scottish indie-pop musician Patrick Doyle died in 2018, just 32; this posthumous recording with bassist and tourmate Helen Skinner offers a poignant snapshot of his “bent music for bent people.”

The Neon Skyline,Andy Shauf,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28c1c3ccbc7d000948542a/1:1/w_160/shauf_skyline.jpg,2020-01-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/andy-shauf-the-neon-skyline/,Anti-,"Andy Shauf writes songs full of drinking and dancing, deep conversation and inside jokes, close friends and old flames—and he’s having a miserable time. Since his 2009 debut, the soft-spoken singer-songwriter has grown increasingly adept at telling stories from the vantage of the next morning’s hangover: plagued by regret, lingering on moments of unease stitched through an otherwise pleasant evening. Like Phoebe Bridgers, he incorporates bits of dialogue into his lyrics that illustrate not just how his characters speak but also how they really feel about each other. Like Jens Lekman, he accompanies himself with hushed, breezy soft-rock that can betray the intensity of his thoughts. Some of his best choruses are wordless refrains, the sound of singing along without knowing what to say. Shauf’s new concept album The Neon Skyline takes place over the span of one night, as did his last solo record, 2016’s The Party. The story goes like this: Our narrator heads to a bar where he hears that his ex is back in town. From there, he spirals through the course of their relationship from young love to jealous arguments to dreams of starting over. He eventually runs into her and they go their separate ways. But by this point, late in the album, you’ve learned that reconciliation was never the point. In the climactic “Thirteen Hours,” Shauf drifts through a flashback that doesn’t focus on the fight that brought out their true nature, or the injury that landed one of them in the hospital. Instead, the key lyric is about a simple facial expression that suggested how things could never be the same again. These are subtle scenes to hinge a narrative on, especially one as simple as this. Deeply earnest but wary of dipping into melodrama, Shauf gravitates toward the quietly stirring realizations you’d find in a Raymond Carver story. There is no irony, little closure, and often no moral at the end. He’s now in his early 30s, more than a decade removed from an early adulthood spent playing Christian pop-punk, and he has updated his songwriting to reflect precisely the kinds of social situations that keep polite, seemingly well-adjusted adults awake at night. The mood—wistfulness giving way to self-deprecation, deep insight cut with awful puns—is both familiar and endearing. The most affecting songs arrive during the album’s mid-section, when a polite question about a friend’s kid in “Living Room” turns into a hallucinogenic vision quest about death and reincarnation and living out our parents’ mistakes. The ambling folk music—which Shauf plays entirely by himself on piano, guitar, woodwinds, and beyond—dims and intensifies to suggest a change in setting. When he sings about an intimate story transporting him into someone else’s home, you feel like you’re there with him. For all Shauf’s expertise as a writer and arranger, the quality of his music that stands out is his gentle, fluttering vocal affectation. Upon first listen, I was certain he was Scottish. He’s actually from Regina, Saskatchewan and just so happens to pronounce the name “Charlie” in a way that sounds closer to “shoreline.” He cracks a good joke about this in the jaunty “Try Again,” where his narrator approximates a British accent to a response of bewilderment: “What was that supposed to be?” Like any good storyteller, he knows when to punch things up—you could play a drinking game with the number of times he mentions characters laughing at each other. But he also sounds a good deal lighter than he did on The Party, as the story of The Neon Skyline calls for a voice that can drift from bar to bar, mood to mood. How sad can you be when the bartender knows what you want without asking and the jukebox has your favorite song? The Neon Skyline doesn’t require deep investment in its narrative to enjoy. Still, the closer you listen, the more rewarding it becomes. Shauf is growing increasingly masterful at casting a spotlight on tiny moments that tend to get overlooked in stories about relationships. In “Try Again,” a loaded misunderstanding provides one of the album’s best scenes: “I miss this,” she says, touching his coat; “I miss you too,” he responds; “I was talking about the coat,” she clarifies. The record ends with a similarly subdued revelation, as the narrator allows himself a brief fantasy about how things could have played out differently between them. The thought is momentarily thrilling, and the music is equally smokey and romantic, until he cuts himself off: “Oh, I’m already bored.” He’s learning that there’s a whole world out there—new people to meet, other stories to tell, more nights to regret.

Hotspot,Pet Shop Boys,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28c31925643f00082b2ec9/1:1/w_160/hotspot.jpg,2020-01-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pet-shop-boys-hotspot/,x2,"For more than 35 years, Pet Shop Boys singer-keyboardist Neil Tennant has returned to a question of world-historic import: Do I stay in or do I go out? “Turn on the news, drink some tea/Maybe if you’re with me we’ll do some shopping” goes one couplet in 1988’s “Left to My Own Devices.” Observing a teen on “I Don’t Wanna,” a song from Pet Shop Boys’ 14th studio album Hotspot, Tennant sings with his usual starchy plaintiveness, “Feels so shy/He’d rather sit alone and cry/But no one understands this guy.” Pet Shop Boys do. No other act has so richly documented the cautious development of lonely queer boys whose ambitions—sexual and economic—are as huge as the beats they heard at the club last Saturday night. On the dancefloor, these boys rehearse how to deal with other boys checking them out or abandoning them for hunkier alternatives. Giorgio Moroder’s sequencer lines are lodestars for Tennant and keyboardist Chris Lowe, like Beatles guitar licks were for other acts. On Hotspot, the best-selling duo in UK pop dampen the euphoria; the result is a tuneful, wan album: a mid-tier effort. Hotspot observes Pet Shop Boys’ pattern of following up a pair of bangers (2015’s Super and 2013’s Electric) with a bagful of autumn leaves. The mid-tempo tunes keep their top buttons buttoned, muted and wary like the sixtysomethings Tennant and Lowe have become. No dictate requires late middle-age to be as fraught as adolescence, but Hotspot puts Lowe’s orchestral synth chords and house keyboard patterns in the service of rote tales of resignation, whose resonance may be dependent on the affection of their listening base. Dismiss “You Are the One” as a sappy little thing if you like;  listen generously and you may appreciate the lyric’s affirmations and the mournful way in which Tennant caresses the chorus hook. The object of desire may be “the one,” but Neil’s none too pleased about it. Three decades after he gleefully shacked up with a bloke who may not love him on the catty “Why Don’t We Live Together,” now he weighs the costs. Hotspot stumbles when Tennant and Lowe convince themselves they need a good time. The interplay between strings, bass synth, and call-and-response female vocal on “Monkey Business” sounds fabulous until Tennant sings, “We’re gonna have a pah-rty!” like he’s a human resources vice president at the Hyatt bar; he’s often played these guys, but now the joke’s not funny. And there’s no reason for “Dreamland,” a duet with Olly Alexander, who as the frontman of synth-pop band Years & Years makes a natural heir to Tennant. So many of Alexander’s songs detail the kind of danger implicit in Pet Shop Boys’ 1993 “Young Offender”: older man getting mixed up with a far younger male lover. Why then is this song such an inoffensive racket? Perhaps the inoffensiveness is the point. In a post-Obergefell environment where gay youth can imagine a life untrammeled by disease but experience anxiety about kissing in public, tracks like “Wedding in Berlin” (“We’re getting married because we love each other/We’re getting married today”) signify as goal and fantasy. Tennant-Lowe’s incorporation of Mendelssohn’s ubiquitous “Wedding March” registers as a shrewd gesture of queering an original text—not an unexpected move at this point in Pet Shop Boys’ career, but nonetheless a discomfiting one, as inoffensiveness can be too. “Only the Dark,” a shimmering ballad in which Tennant pledges fidelity so long as the lights are out, is better. It’s not the first time he and Lowe have preferred the erotic possibilities of the unseen—a longstanding fascination which speaks to how profoundly Pet Shop Boys revel in paradox as a first principle. So much uncertainty requires consistency.

the first glass beach album,glass beach,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2897b825643f00082b2e88/1:1/w_160/first%20album_glass%20beach.jpg,2020-01-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/glass-beach-the-first-glass-beach-album/,Run for Cover,"When MySpace lost 12 years’ worth of audio files during a server migration last year, many grieved the loss of what had been a formative source of music discovery. Sure, the site has been a shell of its former self for years now, but the phrase “MySpace music” still feels inextricable from a certain irreverent, malleable sound. Los Angeles’ glass beach breathes life into those audacious bygone trends. Their idiosyncratic debut, the first glass beach album, is a whirlwind of post-emo maximalism, fusing mid-aughts pop-punk with synthy, sugarcoated chiptune. Combined with a mid-century jazz flourish and a few ambient interludes, it makes for one of the more bizarrely inventive recent rock albums. Glass beach came together sometime around 2015 under singer and multi-instrumentalist J. McClendon, then working under their solo alias Casio Dad. Future bandmates William White and Jonas Newhouse were DJs together at a college radio station in Minnesota, where they occasionally played Casio Dad tracks. A real-life friendship was born, and the trio began making music together in LA. Though glass beach’s unique confluence of influences appears tailored to a niche audience, they’ve found loyal devotees and a measure of underground buzz. Supporters championed the band with such earnestness that Run for Cover has reissued the first glass beach album on vinyl just eight months after its initial Bandcamp release. Glass beach separates lengthy bursts of electro-punk (“bedroom community,” “yoshi’s island,” “dallas”) with shorter, palette-cleansing instrumentals. “I’ve always just been more into the idea of listening to a whole album all the way through,” McClendon has explained, a philosophy that keeps the sequence feeling orderly even amid its most frantic exaggerations. One such moment is the opening track, “classic j dies and goes to hell part 1,” a jazzy opus best described as The Black Parade off-Broadway. It’s the most overblown track here, but if you can bear it, more polished moments throughout the rest of the record are their own reward. While glass beach most immediately call to mind recent cyber-pop phenomenons like 100 gecs, they cite the influence of the Brave Little Abacus, an obscure, short-lived emo group from New England with a similar affinity for experimental electronic elements not often heard in rock music. “bedroom community” fits a traditional piano solo between passages that evoke classic video game soundtracks, while the first portion of “dallas” taps into minimal Midwest emo before breakneck synths take over. There’s as much pop-punk and math rock here as there are cartoonish embellishments. But despite the laundry list of resemblances—American Football’s odd time signatures, the Octopus Project’s theremin hooks—nothing on glass beach sounds copied and pasted. The band falls short when their subject matter starts to rely on hackneyed mid-aughts emo tropes: “I’m always making a list of all the people I’d help if I wasn’t helpless myself,” McClendon croons on “bone skull.” “cold weather” has little to add to its description of a relationship conducted over text: “I love the way you make me feel/When I’m staring at my screen/At 4 a.m., trying not to fall asleep/And you hit me up just to see if I’m OK.” But even when glass beach’s lyrics feel slight, they deliver them with conviction—a confidence that comes from committing to artistic decisions hardly anyone else would make. They’ve learned that genuine connection sometimes means forgetting about trying to appeal to the masses.

Desire,Desire Marea,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28bf7b390fe60008eca575/1:1/w_160/desire.jpg,2020-01-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/desire-marea-desire/,Izimakade,"Long before music became an industry, its primary purpose was ceremonial. For thousands of years, people have used song and sound to celebrate their communities and to worship their ancestors and deities. While today’s stars often thank God for their blessings and the nightclub remains a church for many, few contemporary albums embody a sense of the sacred like Desire Marea’s debut solo album, Desire. As one half of South African duo FAKA, Marea drew on local dance music sounds like gqom, but on Desire, their exploration of the divine takes them in a many-splendored multitude of  stylistic directions, often within the span of a single track: liturgical drone, galloping club beats, existential noise. The scene is set by the resonant organ of opener “Self Centre,” a pleasing play on “self-centered” that puts the emphasis on the core of one’s being—in other words, the soul. Exultation follows in the form of “Zibuyile Izimmakade,” which means “The Gods Have Returned” in Zulu. A galloping beat, the hoot of an owl, and Desire’s operatic falsetto come together in a wave of ecstatic energy that makes a rockpool of the chest; in Zulu, Marea sings, “The Gods have returned/To tell us to stand proudly in our light.” It’s not the only spirit-catching moment. Taking its name from a Zulu word that means “rejoice” and is used to greet one’s ancestors, “Thokozani” spans from baroque harpsichord flourishes to piano house, imbued with the dynamism of the sonic collages that Total Freedom parented and popularized in the transatlantic club scene of the early 2010s. Of course, the divine does not exist solely on another plane. The joy of existing within a body, and expressing that freely, is one of the most sacred human experiences. In an interview with writer Lindiwe Mngxitama, Marea said they wrote the album’s lead single, “You Think I’m Horny,” during a time when they were “trying to foster a sense of...tenderness[,] even with casual interactions.” Over a goosebump-inducing marimba line and a stretch of scuffed-up trip-hop, the song prioritizes intimacy over sex: “You think that I’m horny/Baby you arouse me/And I don’t even wanna fuck you/I just wanna be with you.” There’s also a sensual reference to the anime franchise Dragon Ball Z (“You are my senzu bean, healing me/From deep within/I get up again”) and a full minute’s repetition of “squeeze me” in a range of choral tones that reach transcendent heights. In “Tavern Kween,” healing extends to the dancefloor. Marea sings in Zulu, “Those of us who live in the night/Find home under disco lights.” Featuring a hypnotizing dance-off between saxophone, trumpet, and electric guitar, “Tavern Kween” is a slow-burn disco anthem in the vein of “Blind,” and its triumphant message is unambiguous: “Hit the floor in your full majesty,” urges Marea; “You deserve to claim your joy in the world.” What makes Desire such a standout debut is that it sounds like an artist at home in the journey of life and in lively dialogue with their craft. A pattern of flux and flexibility runs through the album’s palette, song structures, and emotional tenor. The more somber and reflective moments, like the mindscape-evoking “The Void” and “Studies in Black Trauma,” which features potent, prayer-like bars from Johannesburg rapper Gyre, are not immune to this feeling of movement, thanks to Marea’s invigorating production decisions. The latter starts out akin to a death-metal opera and moves through several sound scenes before morphing into an aural bubble bath. Along with the London composer and sound artist Klein, Marea belongs to a new generation of independent artists approaching voice, musicianship, and performance with all the senses in mind. It’s that embodied vitality that allows Desire to speak so fluently to the mind, body, and soul.","Moving beyond FAKA’s gqom influences, the South African musician pairs experimental club styles with operatic falsetto in a multi-sensory exploration of the nature of the divine.

Big Conspiracy,J Hus,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e29cd9ee540c400084fdeb9/1:1/w_160/bigconspiracy.jpg,2020-01-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-hus-big-conspiracy/,Black Butter,"J Hus’ conservative detractors believe he and his music play an outsized role in the UK’s so-called knife crisis. In December 2018, the London rapper was sentenced to eight months in prison after being arrested for carrying a knife at a local shopping center, his third arrest for carrying a knife or being involved in knife fights. When he was stabbed in 2015, he was criticized for making gang signs in his hospital bed and glorifying violence. “They wanna judge me from what they heard I do/It’s a big conspiracy,” he sings sarcastically on his sophomore album’s title track. He seems to embrace the role of the anti-hero, but only on the condition that the nation recognizes its own role in shaping him. Improving upon his more eclectic debut, Common Sense, Big Conspiracy is smoother, preciser, and more measured. Common Sense showcased his working knowledge of road rap, Afropop, reggae, turn-of-the-millennium American rap, and even the weirder corners of SoundCloud; now, he is more concerned with how all of that might fit together. Big Conspiracy reunites Hus with Common Sense architect Jae5, along with co-producers TSB and IO, and as a unit, they create the rapper’s most balanced and full-bodied music yet. You discover that his versatility comes from feeling adrift and misunderstood in his own country, and these songs are a journey back to the center of his true self. Big Conspiracy plays like J Hus wants to set the record straight. This is who he is: a lost son of Gambia, an adult-in-progress, a talented pop polymath, and just a guy who has a lot of sex. Common Sense was playfully aimless, a horny playboy fantasy with a few songs about gangsta paranoia. There’s still plenty of that here, too: he’s libidinous across “Fortune Teller,” and “Helicopter” emphasizes the terrors of probation and plainclothes officers stalking him. But this album more clearly sketches out his development from displaced African boy to imprisoned British man, and it is by far the best J Hus has been on record as a performer and storyteller. There are introspective raps about his incarceration and prison culture, colorism, and colonialism; about the fear and paranoia and violence that come with street life; about carrying a knife around London and being ready to use it, and why using it might be necessary. Ever since the stabbing in 2015, his music has carried the urgency of knowing your attackers are simply waiting for an opportunity to finish the job. That cuts through Big Conspiracy’s more muted and low-key vibe. On “Must Be,” he’s seeing adversaries everywhere. The frenzied grime cut “No Denying” finds him at his most convincingly defiant: “You know me, I’m the livest, call on all your riders/Call on all your strikers, me, I don’t even fear death/You don’t know me, I’m fearless, me, I’m out here bare chest,” he raps. He’s not just self-assured, he’s invincible. While Hus is an undeniably captivating rapper, he isn’t going to bowl anyone over with his lyricism. He is a solid, dependable writer somewhat reliant on his ability to sound comfortable in any setting, and he usually impresses with his charisma and the sheer command of his range. But his pivot toward interiority gives his songs a new dimension. His bars are simple, straightforward, and can occasionally lean toward fortune-cookie wisdom (“Get the bread, avoid the drama/You can avoid the feds but not the karma,” he raps on “Fight For Your Right”), but throughout the album, he seems to be growing more secure in himself. The focus throughout Big Conspiracy is finding the person at the center of a musical matrix. Big Conspiracy joins records like Burna Boy’s African Giant and GoldLink’s Diaspora, which found connections between black music the world over, but like Dave’s Psychodrama this album feels distinctly about the personal turmoil of being the child of African immigrants raised in London, making a home in a place you don’t belong. “I had to play dumb, just to blend in/Then go to Africa for spiritual cleansing,” he explains in the final moments of closer “Deeper Than Rap.” Being uprooted has threatened many family trees; sometimes finding ways to take root in a foreign land is the only way to survive.","The London rapper’s second album is smoother, preciser, and more measured. We see J Hus as a lost son of Gambia, an adult-in-progress, a talented pop polymath, and just a guy who has a lot of sex.

Bonny Light Horseman,Bonny Light Horseman,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2880f1e540c400084fdd69/1:1/w_160/Bonny%20Light%20Horseman_Bonny%20Light%20Horseman.jpg,2020-01-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bonny-light-horseman-bonny-light-horseman/,37d03d,"Bonny Light Horseman formed casually, like a front-porch jam. Fruit Bats singer Eric D. Johnson heard that his friends—veteran multi-instrumentalist Josh Kaufman and singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell—were getting together to revisit ancient folk songs. He asked to sit in on the experiment, and the chemistry was instant. On their self-titled debut, the trio reimagines centuries of standards for our fractious political climate, making old chestnuts feel new. On first listen, these 10 performances may sound traditional, even staid, three dovetailing voices floating above bright acoustic guitars and ringing pianos. There are references to bygone wars and the bounty of a father’s garden, to the Biblical parable of prisoners Paul and Silas and the folk heroism of John Henry. If you’ve listened at all to English, Irish, or Appalachian folk music or any of their many revivals, you’ll spot familiar archetypes and icons. But Bonny Light Horseman gently cut these songs free from aging roots, transplanting them to the present. The trio has more reverence for the flexibility of the oral tradition than the songs it has produced. They splice together bits of old numbers into new ones, drop or add verses, and relocate antediluvian sagas into Stateside settings. The tune that gave the trio their name, for instance, is a lover’s lament for a dead soldier, killed during the Napoleonic Wars. Mitchell spent years recontextualizing folk tropes before her myth-plundering Hadestown became a Broadway hit, and here, she sings a version that lambastes Napoleon by name but scrubs other historic details. This version excoriates all-powerful leaders who dispatch the powerless to their death; as strongmen worldwide foment new nationalism, her rendition feels as much like a warning as a plea. “Mountain Rain” exquisitely recasts the ballad of John Henry—a steel driver who battled his mechanized rival to victory and death—as the unionized lament of his coworkers. “West Virginians, hammer in the morning/Hammer in the mountain rain,” Johnson sings, giving voice to workers who didn’t want to die just to prove their worth. You can imagine artificial intelligence and the threat of automation, coming around the Great Bend into a new millennium. The settings meet these lyrical revisions halfway. Bonny Light Horseman reimagine the gospel song “Children, Go Where I Send Thee” under the name “Jane Jane,” making the tedious structure of the “counting song” feel miraculously breezy. Cock your head just right, and the layered acoustic and electric guitars even sparkle like Steve Reich’s Electric Counterpoint for Pat Metheny. At the surface, “Magpie’s Nest” is a pastoral beauty, Johnson crooning of idealized love over graceful guitars. But listen to the furtive cymbals, brooding saxophones, and moaning organ—they infuse the song with the same
sophisticated blues that drifts through Johnson's yearning voice. This revisionism peaks during the timely “Black Waterside.” For decades, “Down by Blackwaterside” has been the currency of British folk, passed, for instance, from Anne Briggs to Bert Jansch to Led Zeppelin. In the classic version, a young maiden sleeps with a deceitful man who woos her through empty promises of marriage. Bonny Light Horseman turn it into a duet, with Mitchell nailing the role of the naif and Johnson serving as an omniscient narrator. They linger on a frequently omitted last line—“’Tis then he’ll marry me,” sending it up like a wail from the edge of madness. If the standard “Blackwaterside” is pitiful, this one quietly seethes, cloaking a hint of vengeance behind a pretty voice. Mitchell, Kaufman, and Johnson have rarely sounded better than they do together, locked inside these scenes with the intimacy of siblings. Late in the album, though, a new voice arrives—Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, who co-owns the festival and label where Bonny Light Horseman made their live and recorded debuts. Over dusky piano, the temporary quartet trades the lines of “Bright Morning Stars,” a wondrous Appalachian spiritual about the heartbreak and hopefulness of mortality that’s undergone a late renaissance. Their call-and-response interplay is gorgeous, but it feels like a well-meaning intrusion during someone else’s deep conversation. Mitchell and Johnson rejoin one another for the finale “10,000 Miles,” a ballad about longing for a lover during some Odyssean journey. Their voices fit together so perfectly it’s possible at last to believe in such a star-crossed fantasy.

Speed Kills,Chubby and the Gang,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28ba4a05bd1a0009e778ad/1:1/w_160/Speed%20Kills%20_Chubby.jpg,2020-01-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chubby-and-the-gang-speed-kills/,Static Shock,"The Jimmie Rodgers Snow speech that opens Chubby and the Gang’s Speed Kills is famous for its sanctimony, linking the liberating qualities of rock ‘n’ roll to juvenile delinquency: “I know the evil feeling that you feel when you sing it, I know the lost position that you get into,” he exhorts. But Snow, a legacy country singer who hobnobbed with famous musicians but walked away from a recording contract with RCA to preach the evils of rock ‘n’ roll, understood one thing about it better than most: Before a word is sung or a riff is strummed, it’s the beat that moves you. And Charlie Manning-Walker, aka Charlie Fresh aka Chubby Charles, the decidedly not-chubby frontman of Chubby and the Gang, seems to have taken Snow’s words to heart. Speed Kills, the band’s debut LP, is infused with youthful energy, full of songs championing the very lawless chaos that Snow warned of. At its heart is a rhythm section that, from its first rumbling strokes, constantly feels half a beat away from tripping over itself but nonetheless keep rolling right along. Chubby and the Gang emerged from a promising wave of early-’10s British hardcore; Charles himself did time with Crown Court, Arms Race, and Violent Reaction, and the gang’s other members—Ethan Stahl, Joe McMahon, and Luke Austin—have all played in Brighton’s Gutter Knife, among other bands. The record was produced by Fucked Up’s Jonah Falco, and while it may be difficult to directly pinpoint his influence, he seems to understand their music on an intuitive level. The album projects a firm sense of place, and it’s not just because Charles’ accent is prevalent whether he’s talking, singing, or shouting. This is an English band, with English influences singing about English places—specifically, London. And Chubby’s London is proudly debaucherous, evidenced by the record’s artwork, an R. Crumb-does-Steamboat Willie masterpiece by the artist Spoiler. Speed Kills leads a pub crawl through the seedy side of the English capital, traversing main thoroughfares (“All Along the Uxbridge Road”), avoiding Tottenham tough guys (“Bruce Grove Bullies”), and lamenting the tragic horror of government malfeasance (“Grenfell Forever”). Much of Speed Kills sounds stuck in the late ’70s, channeling the crunchy lo-fi brattiness of the Kids and the Damned and the pummeling swiftness of early Motörhead. They sound like hardcore kids playing pub rock, with oi gang vocals that pair well with both sloshing pint glasses and mosh-pit spin kicks. But it also offers a welcome change of pace; smack in the middle of its whirlwind 26-minute runtime lies “Trouble,” a Hammond organ-driven Buddy Holly bop that effortlessly shifts between twinkling sock-hop guitar and mercilessly crashing cymbals. In another hard left turn, Chubby and the Gang choose to end a record full of raucous rippers on a solemn note, an ode to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire. “An odd light flickers in the tower blocks/The old man singing songs in the bottom of the glass,” Charles sings on “Grenfell Forever,” acknowledging the pub as not just a place for rowdy singalongs, but also somber reflection. Rather than killing the vibe, it deepens the mood, revealing traces of both Billy Bragg and Archy Marshall in their DNA. Punk-band lifespans, like punk albums, tend to be short, and the unruly energy on display here rarely burns for long. If the rest of the scene that Chubby and the Gang emerged from is any indication, there’s no telling how long this particular gang stays together. Until then, you can likely find them in the pub, riffing and rioting and reminding everyone that rock ‘n’ roll is supposed to be revitalizing and fun.","These unruly British punks sound like hardcore kids playing pub rock, and their debut comes alive with liberating energy.

Invisible Ritual,Jennifer CurtisTyshawn Sorey,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28aeee390fe60008eca50a/1:1/w_160/Invisible%20Ritual_Tyshawn%20Sorey.jpg,2020-01-29 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jennifer-curtis-tyshawn-sorey-invisible-ritual/,Tundra,"Devotees of the experimental scene  know that Tyshawn Sorey thinks big. He won a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2017 and premiered a new song cycle with Opera Philadelphia the following year, and he has continued to revise and refine a dramatic tribute to Josephine Baker. While fans wait for some of those ambitious projects to be recorded, the composer and multi-instrumentalist has recently turned to the intimacy of duo sets. It would be a mistake to think of these as minor offerings. Last fall brought an inspired concert recording with veteran pianist Marilyn Crispell. Now there’s another gem under that same heading. Invisible Ritual pairs Sorey off with the violinist and composer Jennifer Curtis, a player from the International Contemporary Ensemble, an elite new-classical crew. Once again, this set documents fully improvised performances. But there’s nothing tossed off about it. Curtis’s range as a soloist is a revelation. She proves a nimble listener and co-leader as she works with Sorey to create a 76-minute program rich with narrative drama. There are no track titles (other than Roman numerals). But instrumental music as expressive as this doesn’t need any additional poetry. The short opening movement introduces an amalgam of attributes that the pair will explore in greater depth over the duration of the album. Free-improv twangs of violin and skittering cymbals set the stage for airy textures, but before long, kick-drum blasts and strummed strings tease the influence of propulsive folk forms. Country blues and vintage rock have their place in this mix, as do the calm and the not-quite-silence of select Art Ensemble of Chicago deep cuts. The following movements make good on these promises. Sorey tends to produce sounds all over his kit, playing even the edges (or sides) of every piece of equipment in his arsenal. And Curtis can match him texture for texture, tossing off clean-tone, song-like sounds, as well as quivering glissandi, and moving between jaunty pizzicato plucking and bowing close to the bridge—the latter effect producing thin, piping harmonics. After she plays a fragment of melody, the delicate extended techniques from her violin that follow sometimes suggest wisps of some phantom turntablist’s remix. At two points during the set, Sorey switches to piano (a side of his multi-instrumentalism that hasn’t been all that prominent on recordings). During the third track, he shows the same feel for nuance and delicacy that can be heard in his subtler percussion work. On the fifth track, he becomes a speed demon with a light touch. Adopting an edgier tone while matching Sorey’s quickness of thought, Curtis provides a winning element of contrast. Beautiful balladry takes center stage during the sixth movement. Feel free to skip directly to this part if you’re eager to hear how a free-improv session might channel conventional loveliness. But those who have been keeping up with Sorey’s recent work won’t be surprised. After that pinnacle of songful gorgeousness, the duo ventures back toward passages of tumult; the recording ends with an extended exploration of sparser, quieter energies. This album may not announce itself as capital-I Important; it lacks some of the superficial, external signs of ambition that can help audiences understand how serious a work intends to be. There is no operatic libretto here; nor is there much of a promotional engine in place. (The album is released by the International Contemporary Ensemble’s own Tundra label.) But the quality of interplay to found here is always news, whenever and however it makes itself heard.","Returning to the duo format, the MacArthur grant-winning experimental percussionist teams up with an elite classical violinist for an album of wide-ranging improvisations.

Watch This Liquid Pour Itself,Okay Kaya,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e287a45fd91bb000807af83/1:1/w_160/Watch%20This%20Liquid_Okay%20Kaya.jpg,2020-01-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/okay-kaya-watch-this-liquid-pour-itself/,Jagjaguwar,"For Kaya Wilkins, songwriting is therapy. On Both, her 2018 debut under the name Okay Kaya, the Brooklyn-via-Norway singer built a small diorama of minimal bedroom pop with lyrics about her mental health, traumas, and desires. Its moments of feeling lost in social and sexual scenarios were oddly relatable, whether earnestly asking a lover to come with her to get an IUD, or exploring her curiosity about BDSM via Matrix costumes. On her second album, Watch This Liquid Pour Itself, she again lets listeners in on another intimate journey of self-reflection through frank disclosures about her life, this time drawing on laconic folk, downtempo rock, and upbeat disco to foreground a different mental cleanse. One of Wilkins’ inspirations for Watch This Liquid was Hippocrates’ theory of chemical systems regulating human behavior, especially the black bile secreted by the kidneys that was said to cause depression and melancholia. The album is likewise Wilkins’ own purge, giving equal weight to an everyday encounter, a moment of longing, and a fleeting memory of her past, including time in a psychiatric hospital following a depressive episode. She tells her stories through a lilting voice that crawls from a whisper to a crisp contralto, which highlights her wry sense of humor. “Overstimulated” floats on a gently plucked electric guitar, easing you in as she describes feeling turned on with deadpan over-awareness: “Anything could happen/At any given time/No wonder why I’m overstimulated.” This trick works best with some of her more cynical lyrics; “Everybody, please give a warm welcome to this current mood,” she begins in a woozy, sardonic voice before reminding us we’re all at the mercy of the planet on the deceptively buoyant pop-disco interlude “Mother Nature’s Bitch.” The album’s more pointed instances of stilted, blunt-force lyrics sometimes undermine Wilkins’ sarcasm. Her verbiage can be so edgeless as to pull you out of the song entirely, like when she grips you by the shoulders in the beginning of “Asexual Wellbeing” for some inexplicable brand-name whiplash: “All I need is your cerebral per diem/That midnight Van Leeuwen/Netflix and yeast infection.” It’s charming and funny in doses, but dilutes the power of her confessionals and keeps us at arm’s length. Later on the album, she tries to get ahead of the most salient critique here: “My lovers used to like all of my songs/Now they only find me annoying.” Watch This Liquid eventually finds its footing, even if it’s a little off-kilter. “This is Scandinavia,” she pronounces on highlight “Givenupitis,” populating a vision of her home with droll references to its “children of apathy” and “politicians” over a spare trip-hop beat and a ringing bell. In moments like these, Wilkins’ obliqueness gives way to something deeper, raw, and atypical, like on the dreamy, horn-laden “Popcorn Heart,” when she compares her heartbeat to ducklings, “strong, streamlined, and quick.” At times the honesty on Watch This Liquid Pour Itself might be its worst fault, but it’s usually its finest quality.

Just Like Moby Dick,Terry Allen & the Panhandle Mystery Band,by: Abigail Covington,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e28ab2705bd1a0009e7787a/1:1/w_160/Just%20Like%20Moby%20Dick_Terry%20Allen.jpg,2020-01-28 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/terry-allen-and-the-panhandle-mystery-ba-just-like-moby-dick/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Over 50 years, the multidisciplinary artist and songwriter Terry Allen has received prominent fellowships, had work featured in biennales, and released 12 albums. Two of these, Juarez and Lubbock (on everything), are venerated touchstones of outlaw country, recently reissued by North Carolina-based label Paradise of Bachelors. At this point in his career, nobody would fault him for coasting. But on Just Like Moby Dick, his first collection of original songs since 2013, Allen evolves, bringing new musicians and singers into the fold to create an album whose strongest moments result from its collaborations. Together, they take what would be just another great, narrative album set to the familiar rhythms of a country waltz and bring it to new places. Folk stalwart Shannon McNally’s warm, worn-in vocals amplify the sadness at the center of “All These Blues Go Walkin’ By” and “All That’s Left Is Fare-Thee-Well.” On the latter, the brittler tones of album co-producer Charlie Sexton tell a story about a relationship—a life, really—that can’t be mended, a wrinkle that refuses to be ironed. Though it’s a tale of futility, it ends with some of Allen’s signature sour optimism: “But somewhere in this old dirt/There’s bound be some gold/Something real that you can feel/Something you can hold.” Each song on Just Like Moby Dick, even the one about a traveling circus descending on a city of bloodthirsty vampires, casts a tender glow. That’s in large part due to the sensitive and lyrical performances by the members of the Panhandle Mystery Band. Throughout, Lloyd Maines’ slinky slide guitar sets a slow pace from which the other players gracefully follow or depart. On album opener “Houdini Didn’t Like the Spiritualists,” the band dexterously stretches the notes out of their instruments, creating a supportive palette of sounds to surround Allen’s soft and briny singing. We may have heard these string-derived textures from Allen before—“Death of the Last Stripper” is not dissimilar to Lubbock (on everything)’s “The Beautiful Waitress”—but that doesn’t mean they aren’t worth hearing again, especially with a little more rhythm. Davis McLarty has served as the Mystery Band drummer since 1996’s Human Remains, but his presence is pronounced here. He comes most alive halfway through the album on the militant “American Childhood I: Civil Defense,” one of two tracks where the bass and cello cede control of the rhythm section to the drums. The other is “Abandonitis,” which features Allen’s son Bale on the djembe as a curmudgeonly Allen reminds the younger generation how universal life’s cruelties can be: “Maybe your sister’s in jail/Your brother’s a punk/Your folks are both dead/Or maybe just drunk/Feel all alone/So sorry for yourself/But just stand in line/Like everybody else.” Abandonment and sorrow are two of the record’s dozen or so related themes; there’s also endless war and the fallibility of memory, topics the satirical “American Childhood” triptych captures with simple, heartbreaking truths. “It’s just the war/Same fucking war/It’s always been/It never ends,” Allen laments bluntly, drawing connections between Vietnam and Iraq. Thankfully, for every devastating literalism, there’s an equal burst of menacingly surreal imagery: a burning mobile home, a gang of murderous pirates, a child riding a squeaky bike through an abandoned town. The tendency for contradictions is evident on “Harmony Two”—a song seemingly about a high-speed chase, set to the sleepy pace of a drifting houseboat. Written by Allen’s wife and collaborator Jo Harvey Allen, it’s characteristic of an outlook on life that falls somewhere between “everything’s on fire” and “it’s 5 o’clock somewhere.” It’s for this very reason that, at a time when crisis mode feels like the new normal, Just Like Moby Dick is worthy of an earnest listen. Perhaps the serene perspective Allen embodies is only available to those—like fellow songwriters Randy Newman and John Prine—who have lived long enough to witness tragedy become comedy. He doesn’t dismiss the calamities we face; life’s not a complete joke. But when it strikes you with a thousand harpoons, what choice do any of us have but to carry on as best we can?

Big Baby Earnhardt,Big Baby Scumbag,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e29cc61fd91bb000807b0a5/1:1/w_160/bigbaby.jpeg,2020-01-28 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-baby-scumbag-big-baby-earnhardt/,self-released,"Ask a Southerner whether or not Florida is part of the South and the answer will vary, but the most common response might be that Florida is just Florida. It’s not not the South, but it juts out from the region both geographically and culturally. The Florida hip-hop continuum—from Miami bass to Trick Daddy to Rick Ross to Raider Klan—has never really fit neatly into the Southern rap tradition. Florida is somehow deeper than the Deep South and dirtier than the Dirty South. As trap has become globally popular, it’s strayed from its regional roots, becoming a kind of common denominator rather than a local style. Tampa Bay rapper Big Baby Scumbag first caught my attention with “Dale Earnhardt,” which reminds you that trap is, above all else, a Southern thing. His music videos drip with regional flavor: sucking the juice out of boiled peanuts, shotgunning Bud Lights, stomping around the mud in a Ghillie suit, and stopping at Waffle House for an All-Star Special. As a born-and-bred Southern boy, I used to think Florida was an island all its own. After listening to Big Baby Scumbag, I’m not so sure anymore. Big Baby came up in the same scene as rappers like XXXTentacion and Wifisfuneral, and he’s affiliated with Atlanta’s Awful Records, but his aesthetic diverges from both. The predominant sound of his work is throwback trap, 1017-style: organ swells, high-pitched synths, 808 bass designed to blow out car speakers. Big Baby’s profile is still relatively low, but he’s already hopped on instrumentals by heavyweights like Zaytoven and TM88, and last year’s Juvenile Hell mixtape was entirely produced by trap forefather Lex Luger. Until Juvenile Hell, Big Baby’s discography was just a string of singles coated with pastiche, with cover art inspired by Pen & Pixel and track titles that tend to be proper nouns like Lil B: “Austin Powers,” “Metal Gear Solid,” “Tony Stewart,” “Major Payne.” Celebrity names and pop culture references generally provide a hook or central punchline, but they also give Big Baby a chance to play around with his persona, allowing him to embody different characters on different songs (a shagadelic playboy, a good ol’ country boy, etc). His colorful and cartoonish loosies are supported by a canny sense of marketing: He’s released a Trix-flavored craft beer and a line of condoms (take the “S” out of “Scumbag” and you’ll get the pun) and has even hinted at a Big Baby Earnhardt racing game. Big Baby Earnhardt anchors the rapper in a central character: the Man in Black, the Intimidator himself, Dale Earnhardt Sr., the most controversial and canonized figure in all of stock car racing. Across the mixtape, Big Baby gives flex rap a new meaning: He’s not just showing off but working out. The album incorporates a wide palette of sounds, each one presented by a different part of Big Baby’s personality. On “Modelo Time (Bebe Grande),” his sensual side is accompanied by flamenco guitar, while he tells the woman of his affections that he prefers to be referred to in Spanish. He’s a lonely cowboy on the range with a country drawl on “Toy Story,” a vocal-fried white girl on “Nicole Ritchie,” an honorary Chopstar on “Til’ My Death.” His voice is malleable; he wears many different trucker hats. The guests Big Baby recruits offer a similar smorgasbord of styles: SoundCloud legend sickboyrari (FKA Black Kray), emo rapper Lil Aaron, and underground kings like Project Pat and Lil B. Drain Gang and Sadboys-affiliated producer CadyCutThroat shows up for “N**GAS IN SWEDEN,” an instrumental interlude that marries trap and tropical house, and Meltycanon pushes Big Baby into math-rock territory with “Street Lights.” Big Baby’s flow is hard-hitting, with barely any space to breathe between bars, but here he expands his vocal range with vaguely country-western hooks that reveal a sensitive songwriter underneath the racing jacket. Dale Earnhardt Sr. was an embodiment of the Southeastern U.S. He’s a walking, talking contradiction, a ruthless businessman with his name licensed to anything who still kept it authentically down-home. The legend of #3 endured because Dale Sr. proved the South didn’t have to be just one thing. He was the champion of a sport that most people think is for backwards chumps, but he hated the Confederate flag. He respected his forefathers, but he pissed off a lot of people with his driving. It’s like how Big Baby Scumbag’s music is proudly Southern, but it plays with tradition as much as it pays homage—the engine of a Tesla in the body of a stock car, with the trunk speakers of the most pimped-out, candy-painted Cadillac imaginable. The sound is classic, the structure is retrofitted and refurbished, but the eyes are squarely on the finish line.","The tracks on the Florida rapper’s latest tape overflow with jubilant maximalism and have a proudly Southern bounce.

Brolik,Sada Baby,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1cf05b3c76950008338039/1:1/w_160/brolik.jpg,2020-01-28 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sada-baby-brolik/,Asylum,"Detroit rapper and world-class shit-starter Sada Baby paints his hometown as a cutthroat circus on par with Gotham City—and himself as its reigning supervillain. He’s a performer and showman, taunting foes and innocent bystanders alike with the demented glee of a classic wrestling heel, and his new tape, Brolik, helps solidify him as the unlikely usurper of the throne in rap’s most competitive city. Sada raps like someone who hands out tapes from his trunk around 7 Mile, and as if to underscore his local-(anti-)hero status, his releases are becoming less and less accessible online. Whoop Tape was uploaded only to his SoundCloud page, and Brolik can be listened to exclusively through the mixtape database DatPiff (and its corresponding YouTube channel). Fittingly, his projects have the raw, unbottled prowess of the Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj mixtape runs, and on Brolik, Sada sounds like he could rap forever. At his best, Sada straddles the line between hilarious and intimidating. Brolik finds the perfect balance between the two: It has the enthusiasm (and by association, the tomfoolery) of his more high-powered verses, yowled as if he were cutting a promo (“8 Legged Ape”), and the more sinister snarl of his grimmest provocations (“Bison Dele”). One moment, he’s a self-proclaimed Krampus terrorizing foes on Christmas, the next he’s pulling pistols out in public and giving out halos. Over the keyboard-powered bounce of frequent collaborators RJ Lamont and Helluva, his flow sounds spring-loaded. His punchlines aren’t as remarkable as on Bartier Bounty, but the imagery is often just as absurd: he’s spoon-feeding hollow-tips like they’re baby food; his money looks like caesar chicken salad. “Never fuck with a mask ‘cause Jim Carrey ain’t no street nigga,” he barks on “WWF.” He compares himself to Mr. Fantastic and Spock in a three-bar span. There isn’t a single moment where he isn’t completely certain of himself or of your inferiority. For all Sada Baby’s singular showmanship, his 2018 single with fellow Detroit street rapper Drego “Bloxk Party” was proof that he works just as well in collaboration. He is comfortable on Brolik no matter who the dance partner is, able to attune himself to their movements and match their energy. On songs like “The Big Red Whoop” and “Triple Threat Match,” he moves in lockstep with lesser rappers like FMB DZ and ShittyBoyz BabyTon, working with and not around them. On the exhilarating “Mood,” Sada rips through a devastating, hookless verse while his partner and hype man Skilla Baby just eggs him on. Brolik is full of patented Sada puffery, but there are a few affecting moments hidden in the margins, hinting at a poignant origin story. “Anything a street nigga been through, I done went through it,” he raps on “Mood,” and there are plenty of indicators most of those experiences have been traumatic. He can be brutally honest about addiction (“I really live that pill life/I ain’t glorifying, it’s horrifying; it feels right”), and he presents rap as his salvation: “I remember I was broke as shit/I remember I ain’t have hope for shit/’Member couldn’t hit the road for shit/Now I can’t get home for shit,” he raps on “Kut N Kordial.” It’s these memories of hardship that seem to fuel his ferocity.","The Detroit rapper channels the lawless energy of mixtape Nicki and Wayne on his latest.

Thin Mind,Wolf Parade,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e275f829ea92d0008b92f00/1:1/w_160/Thin%20Mind_Wolf%20Parade.jpg,2020-01-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wolf-parade-thin-mind/,Sub PopRoyal Mountain,"Wolf Parade will always live in the shadow of their debut. 2005’s Apologies to the Queen Mary was one of the great statement albums of indie rock’s blockbuster era, paving the way for years of similarly jittery, nervy bands and launching an entire multiverse of Wolf Parade spinoffs and side projects: Sunset Rubdown, Handsome Furs, Swan Lake, Divine Fits, Operators. It’s a wonder they never burned out. Not all of the records Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner recorded in the wake of Queen Mary were essential, but all of them delivered moments of inspiration. And yet for all the dependable music these two have released over the years, for casual fans looking for a quick Wolf Parade fix, the go-to will always be Queen Mary. In hindsight, Krug and Boeckner’s prolificacy has cut against them. If they hadn’t so thoroughly flooded the market, perhaps there might have been more excitement around Wolf Parade’s 2017 reunion album Cry Cry Cry (casual fans may never have noticed the group’s 2011 hiatus). Their default has always been to keep the music flowing, though, so just a year and a half later, they’ve followed up that album with a similar one. Like Cry Cry Cry, Thin Mind is perfectly calibrated to evoke nostalgia for Queen Mary without ever quite recapturing the odd, jittery intensity that made that record so beguiling. Thin Mind is the band’s first album since the departure of longtime guitarist Dante DeCaro, but that absence hasn’t shrunk Wolf Parade’s sound any. Returning producer John Goodmanson makes sure of that. He’s quietly become one of indie rock’s great maximalists, almost incapable of recording an instrument that doesn’t pop. He leaves every surface so sleek you can see your reflection in it. Especially if you’ve sat out a few Wolf Parade albums, it can be a shock to hear the rusty, lo-fi patina of the group’s Isaac Brock-produced debut replaced by the crystalline guitars of an Interpol record. With that radio-rock sheen, Thin Mind ironically plays like the big leap the band could have attempted in the wake of Queen Mary, during the years when alt radio still looked to blogs as a farm system for the majors. Their sound now feels less like a paranoid revision of ’80s synth-pop and more like an homage to ’80s rock at its most direct. “Under Glass” opens the record with the charging gusto of Elvis Costello’s new wave stompers, while “Wandering Son” rides the dopamine-spiked power chords of a Rick Springfield hit. Dramatic pianos tease “As Kind as You Can” with “Don’t Stop Believin’” pomp, and a thick coat of synthesizers lacquers everything. It’s all bright and spirited, but also a little obvious, which is disappointing coming from a band that once ran freely with its most left-field impulses. Krug’s songwriting, too, has also grown more direct. “Julia Take Your Man Home” gender-flips the setup of Rae Sremmurd’s “Come Get Her,” swapping out the dancing party girl for a drunkard carving dicks into the bar and prattling on about cocaine. It’s fun on paper, but the premise wears thin well before the song ends. Thin Mind periodically feels like Wolf Parade’s own Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, a conversation between buddies from a fading era unsure of where they fit in now. “I’m not in love with the modern world,” Boeckner sang on Wolf Parade’s signature song. Fifteen years later, the world isn’t any less modern, and the band isn’t any more at home in it. “Up and down the street there’s a grey procession, they’re going to have a funeral for your profession,” Boeckner sings on “Wandering Son.” It’s almost too apt: a mid-’00s band singing about obsolescence. Wolf Parade’s sound was once state of the art, but Thin Mind captures only intermittent reminders of how wild and wonderful their moment was.

Joyful,Andras,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e278123e540c400084fdc88/1:1/w_160/Joyful_Andras.jpg,2020-01-27 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/andras-joyful/,Beats in Space,"Halfway through the opening track on Andras’ Joyful, a pipsqueak voice pops up over a squirrelly acid line and giddily rolling snare, repeating a single spoken word: “Honeybird.” It makes for a strange collision of sensations: On the one hand, nods to classic rave and ’90s trance; on the other, a term of endearment rendered as a cartoonish chirp, stripped of all context. Whatever the word is supposed to mean, if anything, is never made clear, but the effect of that Rosebud-like refrain is unmistakably tender and carefree. The Australian producer couldn’t have picked a better title for his album: Suffused in romantic piano flourishes, winsome synth leads, and drums that race like a teenaged heart, Joyful’s seven tracks pursue pure, unadulterated delight. Andras, aka Melbourne’s Andrew Wilson, is a clever manipulator of both codes and emotions. Though he got his start making sample-based hip-hop, since 2012 he has teased the outlines of deep house, lo-fi electro-funk, and new-age ambient, using aliases like Andras Fox, A.R.T. Wilson, and House of Dad, and as part of the duo Wilson Tanner. His output has gotten increasingly cheeky and occasionally arcane: 2016’s House of Dad, a tribute to his plumber father, sampled the sound of a flushing toilet; 2018’s Help generated ambient sketches from YouTube bloopers and shock videos; last year’s Boom Boom was a bongo-driven critique of the way that portable audio colonizes public space. Joyful is a simpler project. There are no big concepts, no grand themes beyond nostalgia for some of Wilson’s earliest epiphanies as a listener: Thirteen years old, listening to trance music in the backseat of his parents’ car as it crests a hill and the ocean appears in the distance. The keys are mostly major, the riffs fetching, the sense of possibility nearly boundless. Occasionally Wilson, a seasoned crate-digger, surfaces a scrap of something vintage—a warbly aria or keening violin—and works it into the mix, sprinkling on the crackle of worn vinyl like fairy dust. When there are voices, they are digitally sped up or otherwise manipulated, mantra-like repetitions familiar from motivational posters and Instagram captions, like “live forever” or “what I feel.” Somehow, he delivers these in a way that’s guileless, unironic; he could probably get away with “Hang in there, baby” without batting an eye. Wilson being Wilson, he can’t resist a little mischief. In “Saga of Sweetheart,” the synthesizer is an uncanny hybrid of Roland keys and Appalachian banjo; the acid line in “River Red” sounds at first like an homage to Larry Heard’s “Sun Can’t Compare,” but it turns out also to have rural origins: In a fascinating interview in Record Culture magazine, Wilson reveals it to be a note-for-note rework of John Fahey’s “Sligo River Blues,” transposed to the TB-303. This kind of tomfoolery shouldn’t work—and yet it does; nothing about Joyful scans as gimmickry. Thanks to standouts like “Harf Green” and “Goggles,” Wilson’s wistful sentimentalism and bright-eyed cheer carry the day, taking the edge off his loopier instincts. The latter is one of the most affecting pieces of dance music I’ve heard in a long while. Never mind the vestiges of dubstep squelch or the pitch-bent echoes of Eurodance; those restless tics are folded into a whole so sumptuous, so swoon-inducing, their kitsch quotient barely registers. The core of the song is a long, melancholy organ melody that feels strangely familiar, almost like a hymn; the tempo is several clicks faster than is customary for a song so bittersweet, which lends a welcome oomph to a track that might otherwise brood. Where most of Wilson’s ode to joy sinks into simple pleasures—a catchy acid line, a reassuring syllable—“Goggles” embraces the kind of grandeur that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever gazed in awe at the view from a moving vehicle, headphones tugging on their heartstrings.

Black Sarabande,Robert Haigh,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e289c0325643f00082b2e8c/1:1/w_160/Black%20Sarabande_Robert%20Haigh.jpg,2020-01-27 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/robert-haigh-black-sarabande/,Unseen Worlds,"Depending on what release you discovered first, you might have believed there were two different Robert Haighs operating in the UK during the 1980s and ’90s. There was the pianist and composer who worked with Nurse With Wound and released elegant modern classical albums like 1987’s Valentine Out of Season. But what to make of the Robert Haigh behind the neck-whipping jungle breakbeats of the Omni Trio, a force throughout the drum ’n’ bass era in the UK? As that project drew to a close in the early 2000s, the more contemplative side of Haigh reemerged with a string of contemporary classical albums. They made for a perfect fit for New York’s Unseen Worlds label; his 2017 album Creatures of the Deep slotted well alongside pianists new and old, ranging from “Blue” Gene Tyranny to Lubomyr Melnyk to Leo Svirsky. Haigh’s Black Sarabande explores terrain similar to Deep, mixing gorgeous piano melodies with a patina of electronics. But where that previous album evoked the properties of water, Sarabande feels grounded. It draws on Haigh’s childhood memories of UK coal country and the hardscrabble “pit village” of Worsbrough in South Yorkshire where he was raised. There’s a heavy atmosphere to these 11 tracks, never wholly enveloped in blackness but always threatened to tip over into it. The opening title track is hushed, provoking comparisons to Harold Budd or Erik Satie. Yet as Haigh’s struck keys hover in space, they turn slightly discordant, like a chill settling into the skin. “Stranger on the Lake” strikes a balance between piano and electronics to luminous effect, its melody shadowed by ghostly overtones. Midway through, the ambient haze swells, and when it finally recedes, the piece is suffused with harp plucks and electronics, making you feel like you’ve left one piece behind and emerged in another one entirely. Black Sarabande’s calm surface proves illusory the more listens you give it. Struck piano wires startle the surface of the otherwise-placid “Wire Horses”; a gush of strings arrives and just as quickly disappears into the woozy, fluttering ambience of “Painted Serpent.” There are moments when Haigh’s playing verges on silence, so that if you’re listening on earbuds, you might hear your own footsteps through the snow more loudly than the music. The gorgeous and brief “Air Madeleine” sounds as if you’re walking around a frozen pond in the countryside and seated next to Haigh on the creaky piano bench all at once, as imaginary a landscape (and interior) as anything Brian Eno could have conceived.

Concrete and Glass,Nicolas Godin,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e27297fbd711c00097d52fe/1:1/w_160/NICOLAS_GODIN_Concrete_And_Glass_COVER_HD.jpg,2020-01-27 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nicolas-godin-concrete-and-glass/,Because,"The two fundamental principles of any Air or Air-related project are 1) that it will display a total disdain for modern music’s rhythmic rough-and-tumble and 2) that it will sound a lot like Air. Concrete and Glass, the second solo album from Air co-founder Nicolas Godin, sees no reason to buck this trend. The record is designed as a hymn to the world of architecture and it sounds utterly, decadently Air, full of blissed-out vocoder ballads that would have slotted effortlessly onto the band’s 1998 debut, Moon Safari. That might sound like a decidedly retrogressive move in 2020. But unlike, say, the Ramones (another band who always sounded perfectly like themselves), Air’s sound is a malleable beast, employing orchestral ambience, 1970s funk, and Serge Gainsbourg baroque soundtracking in one elegant stride. Besides, nostalgia is a tricky subject with Air: Their appeal was always retro-futuristic, a slightly corny vision of the future that sounded as anachronistic when they emerged alongside Britpop and French house as it does now. The charm of Concrete and Glass rests not so much on the album’s architectural concept—it would be no great surprise to find that every Air song is about architecture—as in the ornate songwriting, luxuriant synth-and-string production, and moments of alchemical magic that Godin charms out of his guest vocalists. Air have a history in bringing out the best in their guests—think Beth Hirsch’s wonderfully wistful vocal turns on Moon Safari—and Russian artist Kate NV and soul singer Kadhja Bonet excel on Concrete and Glass. NV delivers gilded heartbreak on “Back to Your Heart,” which sits somewhere between the Carpenters’ daytime melancholia and the fuzzy futurism that 10cc nailed on “I’m Not in Love,” while Bonet employs a strangely forceful, spooked psychedelia on “We Forgot Love,” her voice casting a spell over Godin’s undulating synths. These two songs are topped and tailed by two of Godin’s best vocodered performances, “Concrete and Glass” and “What Makes Me Think About You”: The pair’s velvety textures, lush melancholy, and gentle warmth send listeners drifting back to Moon Safari’s scatter-cushion reign. The record’s other guest vocalists fare nowhere near as well. Cola Boyy’s nasal soul twang and Alexis Taylor’s little-choirboy-lost chirp fit awkwardly with Godin’s silky musical bed, while Australian pop provocateur Kirin J Callinan is wretched on “Time on My Hands,” his anemic vocal limping along atop clichéd lyrics and moldy guitar lines. These three songs have a nastily infectious quality that seems to seep into “The Border” and “Turn Right Turn Left,” two decent pieces of sumptuous, if lightweight, pop that suffer by proximity to this terrible trio. Thankfully, closing number “Cité Radieuse” breaks the hex. It’s the one moment on Concrete and Glass where Godin shifts out of his comfort zone; the song’s neo-classical synth lines ripple in subtly shifting patterns that suggest Steve Reich and Valium, as Godin makes an admirable attempt of interpreting what he describes as the “Tetris-like form” of Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation building in Marseilles. It’s an intriguing choice to end on. While Le Corbusier’s work was bold and divisive, Concrete and Glass has a comforting familiarity that is more cozy brick cottage than towering skyline. Concrete and Glass won’t shock, sparkle, or challenge cultural norms, but it’s a (mostly) lovely place to inhabit.

Home,Dixie Chicks,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e272039ab679700082c0777/1:1/w_160/dixie_home.jpg,2020-01-26 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dixie-chicks-home/,Open WideMonumentColumbia,"As the summer of 2001 drew to a close, Natalie Maines invited her bandmates—the sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer—to play some bluegrass in her living room in Austin, Texas. They’d been off the road for a few years, and their plan was to hang out, catch up, and remember how good it feels to hear their voices blend in harmony, for no audience but each other. Earlier that year, they’d sued their label for withholding royalties from their first two blockbuster albums. In the years after, they’d find themselves in a righteous battle against the industry, leaving their future as a band uncertain. But for now, they were enjoying the most relaxed, unburdened creative experience of their lives. It was Maguire on fiddle, Strayer on banjo and dobro, and Maines with a voice like a gut-punch. No amplifiers. No drums. One song Maines suggested they try was Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide,” a classic rock staple that Stevie Nicks wrote at the age of 27. Maines, who had just turned 27 herself, found new resonance in its words after the birth of her first child and she thought she could hear her bandmates’ voices in its bittersweet sunshower of a melody. Also on the setlist were two songs written by the folk artist Patty Griffin. One was about speaking your mind in the face of public dissent; the other was about winding up on your deathbed with a long list of regrets. They weren’t planning on making an album. And even if they were, because of the lawsuit, they figured they couldn’t release it anyway. As the music started coming together and Maines enlisted her father, behind-the-scenes steel guitar legend Lloyd Maines, to produce the sessions, they brainstormed a couple of strategies. After the surprise success of the bluegrass soundtrack to the Coen Brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou?, they thought maybe these songs would be served best in a film. They contemplated going indie. They considered breaking the mold and sharing the music directly on their website for free, a way to thank the loyal audience they’d amassed as a major breakthrough act in the late ’90s. At the time, their lawsuit with Sony was the biggest controversy the Dixie Chicks had ever faced. But it was far from their first battle. By now, they were used to fighting for everything they wanted. There were problems with their Little Feat-inspired band name: the label didn’t like “Chicks,” other corners were uncomfortable with “Dixie.” At least one sound guy refused to plug in their instruments at a show, assuming them to be mere props. In the studio, there was the man who thought the iconic title track of their 1998 major label debut Wide Open Spaces wasn’t country enough for them to track; and then there were the industry people who thought it was too country and asked for a remix without banjo and fiddle. Their answer, of course, was hell no. They learned quickly their instincts were right. When their follow-up, Fly, arrived a year later, the Dixie Chicks’ merging of country and pop had been accepted by the mainstream. But their subject matter hadn’t. There was the sex talk in “Sin Wagon.” (“That’s right, I said mattress dancing,” Maines sang, using her southern twang to tug the vowels of each word, like she was making sure the conservatives at country radio heard her correctly.) There was also “Goodbye Earl,” a singalong anthem about murdering an abusive husband without a tinge of regret. It’s their signature song, their unsubtle twist on the genre’s legacy of male-narrated murder ballads about cheating wives and no-good women. To make their stance clearer, they paired the single with an ironic B-side cover of Tammy Wynett’s “Stand by Your Man.” Men with powerful positions at radio stations weren’t crazy about that one either. Maines laughed it off: “We always figured whoever was complaining must be beating their wife.” As the whirlwind cycle behind Fly calmed down, things got more personal. The band claimed the label was withholding over four million in royalties and tried to terminate their contract. The label countersued. The band sued back. In the end, they re-signed to Sony with a few conditions. They would get their own imprint (Open Wide Records), an increased royalty rate, and, most symbolically, they would effectively banish the men who had signed them and produced their first two records. “We felt like we were fighting a battle for our industry,” Maines explained. This was all happening in the background as they worked on the pared-down story-songs that would comprise their third album together, Home. But they didn’t let it affect the process; Home became a state of mind, the place where no one could reach them. Recreating the living-room feeling of those early demos, they worked at a studio in Austin, within an hour of all their houses. They decorated it with candles and kept the mood light. “They’d be looking at catalogs of baby clothes and home furnishings,” Lloyd Maines recalled of the sessions. There were no deadlines, no demands. Family members stopped by regularly. “It just seemed like the next phase,” Natalie Maines said. “Just be laid back.” They recorded tributes and inside jokes, love songs and lullabies. “Little Jack Slade” is an instrumental dedicated to Maines’ newborn son. It’s not just a sign of who the Dixie Chicks were becoming—proudly virtuosic, uninterested in trends, a family operation—but also a nod to where they began. In the late ’80s, the group formed as a quartet featuring Maguire and Strayer, costumed in cowboy hats and fringed jackets, playing bluegrass on street corners for passersby: a markedly old-fashioned vision of country at a time when people like Garth Brooks were starting to take the genre to commercial and theatrical extremes. After the original vocalist and guitarist quit in the mid-’90s, the sisters enlisted Maines, a younger singer who grew up surrounded by country music but gravitated more toward Madonna. She had a similar influence on the group, pushing them toward brighter, wider terrain. The only song on Home that all three members wrote together is “White Trash Wedding,” an upbeat breather that was inspired by an episode of Jerry Springer. “I shouldn’t be wearing white and you can’t afford no ring,” goes the chorus, which is funny but also telling of the characters they were now interested in. These are songs that pit romantic idealism against blue-collar heartache, that establish American archetypes as settings for hard lessons and disappointment. “It was a broken dream right from the start/Bless their tortured, tangled hearts,” Maines sings at one point about a doomed couple miles from the sweeping romance of hits like “Cowboy Take Me Away.” The story in the opening track, “Long Time Gone,” takes the optimism of “Wide Open Spaces” to its logical conclusion; the narrator winds up embittered but at peace back in his hometown, where big dreams go to die and the country music on the radio sucks. In the last verse of that song, Maines aligns herself with outlaw heroes like Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash as opposed to the genre’s more modern torchbearers. It’s a stance she would echo when she found herself in a feud with the country jock Toby Keith, of all people, and his awful, xenophobic “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American).” Maines hated the song: “It’s ignorant,” she said, “And it makes country music sound ignorant.” Keith, who had somehow positioned it as a tribute to his late father, took her criticism personally, calling her a “commie heathen” and projecting a photoshopped image of her with Saddam Hussein at his concerts. He was not alone in this sentiment. At the 2003 CMAs, where Maines performed in a shirt that read “F.U.T.K.,” the audience booed when the Dixie Chicks’ name was spoken. “This is our version of a good patriotic song,” she would say in concert while introducing “More Love,” a ballad on Home’s meditative second half. With a rocking-chair tempo and an insistence on empathy above all else, it’s a song about the tension between two people, only zooming out in its closing verse to address a country spiraling toward extremism. It’s sequenced on the record right before “I Believe in Love,” which the group first presented at a televised benefit concert in the weeks after 9/11. Their performance was one of the quietest of the night, as they sang about silence, solitude, and truth, huddled together, surrounded by candles. You can watch their performance and see the roots of the record they would make. The sound is wistful and hushed, with a deeper focus on harmony. But the words remain pivotal, and the vision is strangely prescient. The two songs written by Patty Griffin, one of the band’s formative influences, serve as the heart of the album. In “Truth No. 2,” Maines belts in her powerful soprano how “you don’t like the sound of the truth coming from my mouth.” Without the direct narrative of their previous anthems, they mediate instead on the moral of these stories. Maines would become well-known for making enemies by speaking her mind; “Truth No. 2” would become the centerpiece of their songbook, The other Griffin composition, “Top of the World,” finds Maines narrating from a haze between life and death, lamenting “a whole lot of singing that’s never gonna be heard.” The arrangement is the album’s most elaborate. Its orchestral swell is punctuated with dramatic pauses that stretch it out past the six-minute mark, as if the song itself is fading in and out of consciousness. It threatens a long, eerie quiet, an afterlife to be avoided at all costs. The Dixie Chicks named their tour after that song. The original plan was to bring the album’s rootsy sound to small theaters, joined by a rotating cast of like-minded artists: “We’re thinking Lilith Fair with men and without politics,” Maines joked. They tested out a few shows in this style after the album’s release and eventually decided to take it to arenas. Full-band, big crowds. They kicked things off in London in March 2003. Before playing their latest single “Traveling Soldier,” Maines addressed the Iraq War that would officially begin in just nine days. She told the audience calmly that the band did not agree with the war and that they were embarrassed to be from the same state as George W. Bush. The crowd applauded; the band counted off and started the song. In an alternate universe, the show goes on and everyone agrees with Maines that the war is a disaster. But because this is country music in the 21st century, because they are women, because of Bush’s approval rating post-9/11, because of Toby Keith and the angry American, they find themselves facing a violent backlash. There are death threats. Radio stations stop playing their music and urge fans to destroy their CDs. Sales decline. Sponsors drop. “I mean, the Dixie Chicks… They shouldn’t have their feelings hurt just because some people don’t want to buy their records when they speak out. Freedom is a two-way street,” Bush comments. “What a dumb fuck,” Maines responds, staring directly at the camera in a documentary called Shut Up and Sing. The film, which documents the response to that night in London, also explores the making of Taking the Long Way, their follow-up to Home. A complicated, often autobiographical rock album produced by Rick Rubin, it plays like a new start—their first record on which every song featured a writing credit from a band member—but also a farewell. “Do you really think we’re going to make an album for you and trust the future of our career to people who turned on us in a day?"" is how Maines explained their abandonment of country music. The first single, “Not Ready to Make Nice,” remains one of their best songs, an explosive ballad about standing by your beliefs. When the song was first presented by songwriter Dan Wilson, it was an apologetic, crowd-pleasing track called “Undivided.” Maines had some edits. By the time they performed the song at the 2007 Grammys, where they won every category in which they were nominated, the public perception of Bush and the war had changed. But the band still suffered the consequences. Album and ticket sales had fallen short of the label’s expectations, with little support from the radio stations they had previously relied on. The performance that night marked their last for years, as the members embarked on quiet side projects. It wasn’t until they heard a cover of one of their songs by Taylor Swift—and the massive response it got from her audience—that they decided to embark on a full comeback tour in 2013. In their absence, the Dixie Chicks’ story was amplified and widespread. There’s Swift, of course, who found her own voice in their sugar-sweet melodies and arena ambition. (She also turned to their aesthetic decisions when it came time to face the world and reclaim a public controversy). Miranda Lambert dreamed of being her generation’s equivalent, and Kacey Musgraves, who waged her own battles against a sexist industry, cited them as an evergreen inspiration. Equally inspiring is how their influence traveled outside the genre: Indie songwriters like Katie Alice Greer and boygenius have covered them, while everyone from Beyoncé to Soccer Mommy heard their own stories in their songs. It’s a legacy tied both to their music and their message of integrity. Despite what it came to represent, Home is not a political record. At the same time, it doesn’t sound like the gesture of domestic contentment the band initially presented it as. Instead, it plays like a refined but deeply unsettled record, one that envisions the years to come as contentious and dark, full of silence and loss, a drought of morality we’d all have to face together. “I don’t think I’m afraid anymore,” goes a lyric in “Truth No. 2.” The way Maines sings it, you could hear it as a kind of manifesto, something to roar along with and celebrate. And it is. But she also wants you to hear the hesitance, the questioning, the heavy dissonance in following your intuition to its loneliest corners. It might also be what struck her about “Landslide,” another song written in a moment of transition, where the word “afraid” is given as much weight as “love.” The Dixie Chicks figured the truth could always be found somewhere between the two.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit a pure and quiet record from 2002, when the Dixie Chicks were the most righteous band in country music.

Music to Be Murdered By,Eminem,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e273d36d7f8cd0008150f58/1:1/w_160/eminem_music.jpg,2020-01-25 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eminem-music-to-be-murdered-by/,ShadyAftermathInterscope,"The thing you have to remember is that Eminem was on Rawkus’ second Soundbombing compilation. Before he ever shook hands with Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Marshall Mathers battled Project Blowed members and Chicago’s future candidates for alderman. This, after all, was a nasally white rapper from Detroit with a rhyming dictionary and a taste for horrorcore. His first EP from 1997 was sort of staggering, but didn’t exactly scream “TRL.” If you ran the simulation a thousand times, it would never spit out the actual results: the tens of millions of records sold, the merchandising and the Academy Award and the million little cottage industries. But that’s what happened, and so by 2000, the nasally white rapper from Detroit with a rhyming dictionary had a diamond-selling album that pissed off Bill Clinton and his former group The Outsidaz in equal measure. It’s tempting to dismiss the endurance of Eminem’s career as the half-life of celebrity, and the man himself as a relic from the Clinton- and Bush-era boom years. But Music to Be Murdered By, released without warning last week, is defined by a certain kind of defiance, and even a peculiar integrity. It’s a messy, sometimes lucid example of a hyper-technical style of rap that fell out of favor and is now creeping back into vogue. It is not, strictly speaking, a good record—Eminem hasn’t made one of those in a decade—but it boasts enough technical command and generates just enough arresting ideas to hold your attention. It opens with a long notebook dump called “Premonition,” in which Eminem vents his frustration with critics—he correctly notes that he’s been mocked for sounding too tame and too angry on consecutive records—and fans who want him to chase trends driven by rappers half his age. His concessions to this real or imagined pressure have, in the past, been disastrous: 2018’s Kamikaze wastes a Tay Keith beat on a middling “Bad and Boujee” riff, and his adoption of the Migos’ triplet flow on 2017’s Revival (“I conned her into/Ripping the condom in two) was ineffective, to say the least. That’s why it’s so striking when the same fixation yields radically more interesting results here. “Premonition” is followed by “Unaccommodating,” a duet with the inhumanly charismatic 27-year-old Young M.A; “Godzilla” pairs Eminem with Juice WRLD, who tragically died at 21 last month. On both songs, the younger performer sounds freer and looser than the headliner, but each ranks among the most effective cuts. Eminem sounds even more engaged when fixating on rap from another era. (This is, of course, the guy who has been posing for pictures in King Sun shirts and doing his most inspired rapping over old Black Moon beats.) There’s the moment on “Premonition” when he relitigates a Rolling Stone review of LL Cool J’s Bigger and Deffer; elsewhere he name-checks King Tee and Chi-Ali. “Yah Yah” is built around a sample from “Woo-Hah!! (Got You All In Check)” and makes superb use of a hook from Q-Tip and a verse from Black Thought, who raps about borrowing an eyepatch from the Detroit rap power player Hex Murda. And Eminem’s final verse on the album comes alive when he mocks the idea of listening to “a 40-some bar Lord Jamar verse,” then continues to diss the one member of Brand Nubian—he correctly identifies him as the group’s weak link—who didn’t appear on Soundbombing II. But it’s impossible to talk about Music to Be Murdered By, like it was impossible to talk about Kamikaze or Revival or The Marshall Mathers LP II before it, without talking first about technique. Eminem once rapped like a drugged-out rubberband, lurching between conversational rhythms and breathtakingly difficult passages. Lately, he just raps...fast. At its worst, this means enduring endless cascades of shout-rapping in the droning, arrhythmic machine-gun style that (generally white) rappers with a fraction of his talent so often utilize, long runs of double- and triple-time flows that bludgeon the song and exist for their own sake. (In one of the handful of genuinely funny moments, he says “I am the top-selling—who cares?/Stop yelling, then stop dwelling.”) And yet—while it never approaches the schizophrenic rhythms of a “Kill You”—Murdered By does feature some genuinely astonishing technique. On the back half of his verse on “You Gon’ Learn,” he begins rapping on the back half of the beat but never quite slides off into the next measure, and ends by calling a truce with the rappers who he says “can’t even figure out where their words should hit the kick and the snare.” (“You Gon’ Learn” is one of three songs that features a reinvigorated Royce Da 5’9”, who acquits himself excellently on all three; his presence is a frequent reminder that dense, syllable-obsessed rap is adaptable to nearly all eras and production styles.) The irony is that versions of the verbose, precise style that Eminem favors here have become very popular over the last decade. One just needs to listen to J.I.D, or the more ambitious J. Cole records, or Kendrick when he says things like “legalize your homicide” to grasp the appetite for wordy, athletic rapping in the mainstream today. His influence on Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt has been well documented. Even Juice WRLD, whose popular singles would seem to borrow little from Eminem, was in fact another stylistic descendent: This is a video of him freestyling nimbly over the “My Name Is” beat (“Eminem, Wayne, and Drake damn near made me”). All of this makes it frustrating when Eminem frequently lapses into finger-wagging at the kids on his lawn. In 2004, Eminem wrote and recorded an entire song from the perspective of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, a puppet that had a recurring bit on Conan O’Brien’s late-night shows. The most damning thing there is to say about Eminem’s work since 2010 is that it often makes you miss that sort of specificity. It is maddening that someone who’s exhibited such talent and wit, even on his worst records, defaults so often to the mawkish, mid-tempo stadium rap that has plagued his albums since the comparatively unhinged and anti-pop Relapse. The emotion behind the Skylar Grey-assisted “Leaving Heaven” feels earned—the song is in large part about the death of his estranged father—but it sounds as if it’s been crafted specifically for a video-game trailer. The album is at its worst when it’s at its blandest, especially when it grapples with failed romance (“In Too Deep,” “Farewell”). There is also an almost unbelievable song called “Stepdad,” a murder fantasy about killing a stepdad with a hook of “I, I haaaaaaate/My, my, stepdaaaaaaaad.” But that is such a perfect marriage of subject to form that it might circle all the way around and become transcendent. The headlines generated by this album deal almost exclusively with “Darkness,” which uses a series of double entendres to tease the reveal that it’s a song written from the perspective of the Las Vegas shooter. Its video ends with a plea for listeners to vote and “help change gun laws in America.” Well-intentioned though it may be, “Darkness” cuts against Eminem’s strengths as a writer and as a vocalist. His best work is brash and irreverent, even when dealing with serious subject matter: See the way he once rapped almost gleefully about the addiction that nearly killed him, or recall the time he taunted, eight months after 9/11, the kinds of kids who would be conned into enlisting. While he still shows the capacity to surprise and exhilarate as a rapper, too many of his songwriting’s eccentric edges have been sanded down and replaced by what is comparatively automatic or, worse, anonymous. On one song, he describes himself as a cross between Blueface and the Boston Strangler—a level of absurdity that Music to Be Murdered By aspires to but achieves only in fleeting moments.

Death of the Neon,String Machine,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2738febd711c00097d5300/1:1/w_160/deathoftheneon.jpg,2020-01-25 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/string-machine-death-of-the-neon/,Know Hope,"String Machine like to think of themselves as an extension of their surroundings: The septet split time between blue-collar Saxonburg, Pennsylvania and their homebase in perpetual “next big thing” Pittsburgh. On their second LP, the bucolic and bustling Death of the Neon, frontman David Beck derives visions of wrecked cars, broken humans, and natural decline from the faded farming towns that lie in between, carved up by developers who “name their housing plan Pasture Place… and the streets after the wildflowers that used to grow there.” But in these frozen fields, Beck sees an opportunity to give the socalist ideals of the past another go. String Machine are forward-thinking, but not futurists; progressive, but not revolutionary. Though it featured many of the same personnel, their 2016 album Threads From the Youth Fossil was essentially Beck’s solo debut. On this new record, he functions as more of a community leader than an auteur, one voice among many. It’s easy enough to describe what String Machine sound like: Name any indie rock band that referred to themselves as a collective and/or featured more than six people on stage at all times. String Machine’s DIY studio Earthwalk, modeled after Elephant 6’s approach, is home to a couple dozen Pittsburgh-area artists who variously show up to contribute strings, synths, horns, backup vocals, and the occasional Crock-Pot. Otherwise, they present as a modern affair. “I could see if my band was featured in someone’s Instagram story/I could bide my time ’til the morning/Reliving my 30 seconds of glory,” Beck twangs in the opener, holding a dead phone in a busted tour van. His imagery reads tactile and pungent on the page—he is variably a spent parcel of bubble wrap, a shattered ornament, a rotting peach, “kimchi marinating in motor oil”—but it’s all pleasantly smoothed over with harmonies and strings. In place of the 4-track psych and classic pop-rock of Neutral Milk Hotel or Olivia Tremor Control, String Machine favor polished post-rock swells, tricky song structures, and off-kilter time signatures that bring up inevitable comparisons to the World is a Beautiful Place and I Am No Longer Afraid to Die or Saintseneca. But this band is emo only in their unabashed earnestness and their inclusion of a deceptively upbeat song about a dead dog. Whether it’s the stein-swinging chorales of “Old Mack,” the traces of digital freak-folk dotting “Engine / It’s Time,” or the mere presence of banjo, they evoke not just the chockablock sound of mid-’00s buzz bands like Annuals or Margot & the Nuclear So and So’s, but also that era’s affinity for wholesome handicraft. They recorded the album’s piano parts at a local church in the dead of winter, braving 20-degree temperatures and sustained by homemade curry. Even if the comparisons are warranted and basically unavoidable, String Machine’s restrained maximalism defies expectations. They’re averse to overstatement, easy catharsis, or clutter for its own sake. “Engine / It’s Time” slowly bubbles up to a lather of manipulated vocals and strings that never boils over. The band white-knuckles their way through the anxious arc of “Eight Legged Dog” and takes a breather just at the point where fans of orchestral emo have been conditioned to expect a detonation. Exploratory mini-epics “Death of the Neon (Pt. 1, 2, & 3)” and “Pit of the Peach” capture barren Western Pennsylvania in the summer, taking the scenic route over sloping hills and through bleakly beautiful farmland in seemingly endless sunlight. Neither goes anywhere unfamiliar, but this is how Death of the Neon fulfills its aim of self-contained serenity. If Beck has successfully executed his vision of the album as a product of its environment, you’ll skip past the obvious genre signifiers and call it Americana.","Though the Pennsylvania band favor post-rock swells, tricky song structures, and off-kilter time signatures, their restrained maximalism defies expectations.

A Change in Diet,Elliot Moss,by: Avidan Grossman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18aeefc3431b000823bda7/1:1/w_160/changeindiet.jpg,2020-01-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elliot-moss-a-change-in-diet/,Grand Jury,"In an interview from 2017, a 23-year-old Elliot Moss told Billboard he liked to work “after the world’s gone to bed.” On A Change in Diet, his second full-length album, the multitalented singer-songwriter gives voice to the creeping whispers of self-doubt that show up unannounced in the wee hours of the morning. Moss makes subdued electro-pop with a deceptively dark, almost despondent, bent — music that leans into the stark reality of those late-night ruminations, when the world seems dark and dreary and even the most innocuous details take on a foreboding significance. For Moss, letting his mind wander is an opportunity to reflect on relationships, both past and present. On “Bodyintoshapes,” Moss repeats the titular refrain over softly pulsing synths, addressing a significant other he can’t get out of his head. “My mind is a razor,” Moss sighs, “and you’re looking like a thread.” The lyrics occasionally deviate into broad ambiguities or the platitudes of bad spoken-word poetry, as on album opener “July 4th” (“You and I, we’re a couple of fireworks/Falling from the sky”). But when the writing is specific, it’s often sharp and deftly evocative, particularly when Moss draws from personal memory, as on the plaintive, sparsely produced “A Change in Diner”: “We order coffee in a loud diner/Fitting words in between plates/And we brace/Wondering who'll be the one to stay.” If the album suffers from any overarching issue, it’s a sense of sameness: Moss wrote and produced each song, and it sometimes seems like he’s not pushing himself far enough. Tracks build towards a climax that never materializes, often ending abruptly or tapering off lamely. Moss’ singing voice is pleasant enough, but not particularly strong, and he makes little effort to test its limits, preferring to rely on standard vocal processing tricks and his formidable ear for production. Moss’ other stylistic experiments fall a bit flat, like on “Smile in the Rain,'' a folkish indie anthem that sounds like a track from a completely different album. But on the standout “Silver + Gold,” all of Moss’ considerable talents coalesce around a richly textured beat and soulful, straightforward lyrics (“Before us, I took a wrong turn down the wrong road/I closed my eyes and I gave up control”). Moss enjoyed a well-deserved bump in popularity in 2015 when a dance video set to his song “Slip” went viral, and he understands the power of thoughtfully produced visuals. In the video for “Silver + Gold” (Moss has a co-directing credit), he makes clear the themes of lost innocence and longing for simpler times he hints at on the album: in the final shot, a young man sheds his ski mask after breaking into his childhood home and grabs a miniature toy plane from his closet for one exultant last hurrah around the neighborhood. “I gave up control, I gave up control,” Moss croons repeatedly, as the camera pans to the character running through the streets in slo-mo and synths in the background settle down to a shimmer. He sounds like he’s comforting himself, finding solace in loosening up and letting the chips fall where they may. For better or for worse, he sounds resigned to his fate. *(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","On his poignant second album, the multitalented singer-songwriter gives voice to the self-doubts that manifest in the wee hours of the morning.

Suite for Max Brown,Jeff Parker,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e272427d7f8cd0008150f51/1:1/w_160/suite_jeffparker.jpg,2020-01-24 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeff-parker-suite-for-max-brown/,International AnthemNonesuch,"Jeff Parker always writes parts that sound unassuming at first listen and unavoidable by the fifth. It’s the X-factor that the guitarist and master collaborator has brought to every project on his long and still-growing list of projects, jazz or rock or otherwise: Tortoise, Isotope 217, the recently reunited Chicago Underground Quartet, his solo work as a bandleader, his work as a soloist, and his supporting contributions for countless others. Despite his ability to do backflips with a guitar, his best-known lick from Tortoise’s 1998 song “TNT” is more like a heel-click—an easy, humble gesture, perfectly timed and placed. It’s a preternatural thing, of course, but it’s also a skill that he’s cultivated by changing up his scenery and embracing the unfamiliar. A few years ago, while splitting his time between his longtime home of Chicago and his new home of Los Angeles, Parker connected with the players at International Anthem, a new collective of jazz-raised, boundary-challenging musicians based in Chicago. Some of them were exploring the intersection of live improvisation and modern digital recording—loops, samples, beats—which was an area that had fascinated Parker ever since Madlib’s jazz-ensemble project Yesterdays New Quintet blew his mind over a decade ago. Parker had been messing around with these elements for years during occasional DJ sets, thinking about how they could apply to his own playing, and had accumulated several hours of experiments. With this new label, he saw the right opportunity to formally release those results. He turned them into his 2016 album The New Breed, some of the most soulful and beat-driven music he’d ever put out under his own name and his first release for International Anthem. What Parker tapped into on The New Breed, he blows wide open on Suite for Max Brown, a mesmerizing follow-up and informal companion piece. While his electric guitar remains a highlight, Parker builds out a fast-slashing range of ideas using dozens of other sounds and instruments, most of which he plays himself. They’re disparate in color and texture, pronounced and often short, each one elbowing or sliding its way in front of the one before it, impatient to steal the show. As a player and composer, Parker shines throughout. As an arranger, he catches fire. Suite for Max Brown is a place where a 26-second, Dilla-indebted loop of an Otis Redding sample and 10 minutes of a jazz quintet weaving around what sounds like someone stacking plastic cups can share a tracklist; each is equally meaningful. He’s less of a specialist and more open to breadth than ever before. “Del Rio” opens with vintage-Korg cloud cover, which parts to reveal an easy-stepping melody that Parker plays on the African mbira—which in turn tees up a warm gust of wind in the form of a big, swooping guitar lick. That last move is one that Parker makes a few times on Suite: entering on guitar at just the right, unexpected moment of a tune. It’s as smooth and elegant as calligraphy; it sounds like he’s literally signing these new ideas with his signature instrument. “3 for L” is a slow swing soaked in L.A. sunlight and leans closer to Parker’s more traditional jazz-bandleader side, but the crafty, mysterious percussion work of Jay Bellerose adds an extra dimension. Bellerose sounds like he’s fixing a bicycle in slow motion, assessing the clicks and clacks of its gears shifting up and down while Parker sits off to the side, narrating the process with his electric. It sets the table for the casual shiver of “Go Away,” the album’s turn-it-up moment, which inconspicuously lifts the bassline from an earlier song and reframes it with a different, more driving energy. Zero in on any one element in the mix here—like the light, instantly combusting pop of the handclaps, which hide in plain sight like they’re part of a selective-attention experiment—and the song suddenly becomes an entirely different thing. It’s like looking at a photo mosaic from several feet away, then putting your face right up to it. His inspiration, however, runs deeper than adventure. Parker’s father, Ernie, passed away while he was making The New Breed, which was named after a clothing store that Ernie owned and featured on its cover a photo of him outside of it, smiling. (The New Breed is now also the name for the group of supporting musicians here, which, in addition to Bellerose, includes old friends Makaya McCraven on drums and Rob Mazurek on piccolo trumpet.) Parker decided to dedicate this next one to his mother, whose maiden name is Maxine Brown and whose portrait graces the cover here. This folds in an extra layer of emotion to every odd pluck, rattle, or whoosh, knowing that the album is essentially a hand-crafted gift of appreciation for his mom. Parker’s sweetly interpreted cover of a jazz piece from her generation, John Coltrane’s “After the Rain,” feels especially baked with love. It has no beat or time; it just glows for a little while, gratitude spilling out from his fingertips and through his amplifier. That familial thread ties Suite to its predecessor in one more graceful way. Parker’s daughter, Ruby, who sang the last track of The New Breed, “Cliche,” also sings on the opener here—the only lyrics on either album. Her words on “Build a Nest” pledge allegiance to appreciating the process of creation as its own reward, and not just as a means to a destination. “Everyone moves like they’ve someplace to go/Build a nest and watch the world go by slow,” she sings as Jeff slowly drums alongside her, his kick beats dragging like they’re attached to a parachute. He drops in some piano plinks and some muffled backing vocals. And together, with the help of some friends, they build a nest from which to watch the world.

X: The Godless Void and Other Stories,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e271767128d8f0008159dcd/1:1/w_160/andyouwillknowus_godless.jpg,2020-01-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-x-the-godless-void-and-other-stories/,Dine Alone,"Even by ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead’s notoriously grandiose standards, X: The Godless Void and Other Stories is one hell of a proggy album title. Likewise, the accompanying cover painting—of demon-eyed lions and dragons flanking a mysterious woman wearing psychedelic armor that looks like melting flesh—is catnip for those who prefer their albums partitioned into roman-numeraled suites and their dice to come with 20 sides. But for a band so enamored with dramatic flourishes that they named their new album’s opening crescendo “The Opening Crescendo,” the boldest thing about X: The Godless Void and Other Stories is its relative humility and grace. For all the musical and personnel changes this band has undergone over the years, it’s easy to forget Trail of Dead began as a two-piece featuring revolving singers/guitarists/drummers Conrad Keely and Jason Reece—and now, a quarter century into their existence, that’s where they find themselves once again. But The Godless Void is less a scrappy back-to-basics move than a full-circle summation of where this band has been and a glimpse into where its principals could be headed as they approach their 50s. Sure, this album features all the churning noise, machine-gunned drum rolls, and regal piano interludes you’d expect from a Trail of Dead record, and the towering centerpiece track “Children of the Sky” has the sweep and swagger of a Source Tags & Codes standard. But while Trail of Dead have always been driven by a fearless, go-for-broke sense of conviction, The Godless Void taps into a more sobering and introspective vein as they grapple with the aging artist’s eternal lament: How do you find your passion and purpose when your heart’s just not in it? After six years of living in Cambodia, Keely returned to the band’s home base of Austin in 2018, and not by choice. As a UK native who had lived in America on a green card, Keely was forced to come back to the U.S. to retain his residency status. Keely’s Cambodia retreat was, by his account, a relaxing experience spent playing with local country bands and putting together his playfully eclectic solo album. By contrast, his Stateside reunion with Reece occurred at a time when it felt like America was coming apart at the seams. That sense of displacement and disappointment is all-consuming on The Godless Void. The album’s first proper song, “All Who Wander,” is the sound of feeling frustrated but too defeated to fight, with Keely cataloging his ennui (“When you wanna breathe/ But no air can be found”) over a muscular, wah-wah-slathered groove imbued with struggle and strain. He usually pushes his voice to the breaking point in order to compete with the band’s crashing arrangements, but Keely is surprisingly subdued here, not so much seizing the spotlight as haunting the shadows. The acoustic melancholy of “Something Like This” is less dream-pop than insomnia-pop, a bleary-eyed Keely teetering on existential crisis as he tries to reacquaint himself with his fretboard: “I’m sure the chords went something like this/I don’t know if I can sing them like I did before/Or if I can feel them anymore.” That desire to reconnect with his muse is amplified by echoes of the group’s past: the looped band-name chant that opens that record evokes their 1999 masterwork Madonna, while “Gravity” repurposes lyrics from So Divided’s cheeky travelogue “Eight Day Hell” into a sorrowful expression of romantic longing. In the album’s most affecting turn, “Don’t Look Down,” he bids adieu to the one he left behind over an urgent jangle-pop sprint. Trail of Dead have covered The Replacements in the past, but this is the first tune of theirs that could be credibly covered by Paul Westerberg. While Trail of Dead have plenty of melodic songs in their canon, never before have they sounded so wistful and wounded. However, where Reece has often served as the aggro counterpoint to Keely’s vulnerable moments, here he provides borderline-joyful catharsis, turning the alt-metal wallop of the title track into a heroic mantra and forging the middle ground between Beatlesque psychedelia and ’80s heartland arena-rock on “Blade of Wind.” Of course, it wouldn’t be a Trail of Dead record without the occasional tip of the scales into pure bombast—see the doomy eco-parable “Who Haunts the Haunter”—but it feels out of place on a record that thrives in more intimate, personal spaces. Elaborate but rarely ostentatious, The Godless Void is a true revelation from a band 25 years into the game—the rare Trail of Dead record that lets Keely’s shell-shocked performances chart the necessary emotional peaks without needing the music to follow suit.","Pared back to a duo, the storied Austin band sounds unexpectedly winsome on their revelatory tenth album.

RICH YOUNGIN,Stunna 4 Vegas,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e2740a2d1c15700099572ca/1:1/w_160/stunna4vegas.jpg,2020-01-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stunna-4-vegas-rich-youngin/,Billion Dollar BabyInterscope,"Stunna 4 Vegas has a great gig. He gets to be the hype man to DaBaby, one of the world’s biggest rappers: he pops up for a few guest verses, shows off his ice in the background of his Instagram snippets. But no rapper wants to be “the other guy” for long. Since DaBaby’s breakout a year ago, Stunna has been itching for a moment of his own. The North Carolina rapper’s latest album, RICH YOUNGIN, is Stunna’s attempt at scoring the solo spotlight. There’s a case to be made that Stunna 4 Vegas’ songs aren’t that much different from DaBaby’s; they both rap over spare, bass-heavy beats with a barrage of puns and run-on sentences. They even have the same flaws: a narrow taste in production and unmemorable punchlines. One of their first viral singles as a duo was “Animal,” the trunk-rattling marathon that set the blueprint for DaBaby’s sound. It was technically Stunna’s song, but DaBaby got all of the attention. And that’s understandable, because DaBaby’s personality is magnetic. He can go viral without saying a single word; he’s suave like that uncle that has a new car every time you see him. Stunna 4 Vegas is far less interesting. RICH YOUNGIN is supposed to be Stunna 4 Vegas’ rags-to-riches story—you know, the one where you announce that your pockets at one point weren’t fat, but now they are. “Nigga really got rich in six months, for real, I watched that shit with my own fuckin’ eyes,” says an unknown voice on the album’s intro. “Really three, but that nigga spend too goddamn much.” Stunna spends the rest of the time making money sound boring. There are no stories about the lavish purchases he’s made, no details about spending a rack on his family. He doesn’t even tell you anything about North Carolina, except that he lived there. Most of the time Stunna 4 Vegas is going through the motions. His pop culture references are dated, like he hasn’t turned on the television since the second Bush administration: Robert Horry, Damon Wayans, Roll Bounce starring Bow Wow. And he shouts with little enthusiasm over production from up-and-coming beatmakers. Some inject the project with much-needed life, like 20’s flute-sampling “WET,” and others contribute to the mess, like the Beat By Jeff-produced “F*CKING UP FREESTYLE,” which sounds like Stunna trying to have a conversation in a truck with engine problems. But even when the beat is strong, Stunna has nothing notable to add. “Russian” only has that title because it’s produced by Rvssian, and if that wasn’t already clear, the hook goes, “I’m smokin’ West Coast Cure in a Russian/And I’m on a beat by Rvssian.” When Stunna settles back into a complementary role, he thrives. “CHANGE MY LIFE,” alongside Blac Youngsta, is a heart racer. Then there’s “DO DAT,” the song that justifies the entire album. Next to DaBaby and Lil Baby, Stunna holds his own, even as Lil Baby teaches Stunna how to properly stunt with the line “My dollars and followers match.” RICH YOUNGIN isn’t the moment that Stunna hoped it would be, but at least his life is great. He’s got money and can afford Offset verses, and even as his music stumbles, he can always return to executing the perfect money phone alongside DaBaby.","DaBaby’s hypeman manages to make money sound boring on his first solo outing.

Scanning Backwards,Phase Fatale,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e27544565c4fb00099d4a7d/1:1/w_160/Phase%20Fatale_Scanning%20Backwards.jpg,2020-01-24 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phase-fatale-scanning-backwards/,Ostgut Ton,"Few techno institutions are more celebrated than Berghain. First opened in 2004, the vaunted Berlin club has since become the effective gold standard for international nightlife, not to mention a bucket-list destination for even casual clubbers—assuming they can actually get in. There’s a mythology around the place, and while it’s been exaggerated over the years (sometimes to the point of cliché), there’s no denying Berghain’s influence on electronic music, fashion, visual art, sound systems, door policies and all kinds of how-to-run-a-club-properly minutiae. In short, it’s reshaped the idea of what nightlife can—and should—be. Berghain is at the center of Scanning Backwards, the second full-length from New York-reared, Berlin-based artist Phase Fatale (aka Hayden Payne). A resident DJ at the club who specializes in mixing techno with industrial, EBM, and post-punk, he has said that every track on the new LP was specifically tailored to sound a certain way inside Berghain’s walls. Dark, heavy, and impeccably engineered, the record can’t be described as minimal, but it’s certainly been stripped down to the essentials. Where Payne’s last album, 2017’s Redeemer, ladled thick layers of noise and distortion atop a techno foundation, here he’s left unnecessary flourishes behind in favor of maximum potency. Upping the impact is his decision to keep the tempo relatively slow (the fastest track on the record clocks in at 123 BPM, and Payne frequently dips well below that); the extra breathing room makes each beat hit that much harder. In terms of its utility, the album is an unqualified success. Musically, though, Scanning Backwards is entering a crowded field. Although Phase Fatale’s own industrial and post-punk bona fides are impeccable—he played in several post-punk and cold wave groups after first cutting his teeth at NYC’s long-running Wierd parties in the late 2000s—he’s also releasing his highest-profile album to date at a time when the latest industrial techno boom has arguably crested. You can’t fault Payne for sticking to his creative guns; he’s not someone who hopped onto the industrial techno bandwagon after hearing a few Blawan tracks in 2012. At the same time, there just isn’t much room for Scanning Backwards to say something new, particularly following a decade in which artists like Silent Servant, Helena Hauff, Broken English Club, Paula Temple, Perc, Regis, Vatican Shadow, Veronica Vasicka, and so many others have all been such a prominent part of the techno landscape. Those artists’ success has contributed to a surge of interest in prior generations of industrial techno experimenters, such as Surgeon, Sandwell District, Adam X, and British Murder Boys, not to mention industrial and EBM originators like Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, Throbbing Gristle, DAF, Cabaret Voltaire, and others too numerous to list. Techno has become inundated with industrial sounds, especially at clubs like Berghain, and Scanning Backwards, which might have sounded more impressive two years ago, doesn’t do quite enough to innovate or build upon that style. Scanning Backwards does include one track which is truly transcendent. Album closer “Splintered Heels” is a raw, powerful cut led by a sinister bassline and the sort of blunt, hard-hitting percussion that powered old Wax Trax records. Yet this is no simple dancefloor stormer; a haunting, shoegaze-esque melody lends the track a spooky, cinematic feel and a subtle (albeit dark) pop vibe. The contrast reflects a newfound elegance in Payne’s work. Other highlights include the ominously churning “De-patterning,” the sludgy metal haze of “Polystyrene,” and the thundering stomp of “Binding by Oath.” Scanning Backwards is by no means a friendly album—Payne has said the LP is conceptually rooted in weaponized sound and psychological manipulation—but there’s something invigorating about its menacing nature. For fans of industrial techno, it's a solid album, better than most, even. It’s not difficult to imagine just about any track from the record tearing the roof off at Berghain. But outside of that environment, the music loses some of its magic, largely because so many of its notes—even its strongest ones—have been heard before.","Tapping his background in industrial and EBM, the Berghain resident delivers a steely set of cuts tailored for maximum impact inside the club.

Manic,Halsey,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20be6dd7f8cd0008150d49/1:1/w_160/Manic_Halsey.jpg,2020-01-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/halsey-manic/,Capitol,"After decades of pop-culture hegemony, the gendered tropes around break-ups have finally been supplanted. Instead of tubs of ice cream and days spent wallowing on a couch, modern heartbreak is mitigated by the promise of a social media glow-up and encouraged by a culture obsessed with both wellness and politicizing the personal. A breakup is not the failure of a relationship, this contemporary approach preaches, but an opportunity for growth, no matter how uncomfortable. Or maybe it’s an expression of heteronormative hostility; men, we learn, are trash. Either way, pain can be a messy, divinely timed intervention from the universe. Manic, the third album by Halsey, is an unlikely, but effective, manifestation of this new convention. I can imagine many listeners finding comfort across its 16 songs, and similarly bridging angst and self-discovery to navigate personal crises of their own. A handful of Manic’s first six singles, among them the “Cry Me a River”-interpolating Billboard No. 1 “Without Me” and the country-pop manifesto “You Should Be Sad,” are rooted in the exploration of deep pain and what Halsey has described as an interest in “female rage.” That explains the lingering influence of artists once written off as angry women: Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette, and pre-acrobatics P!nk. (That more than a third of the album’s songs were released in its lead-up points to an altogether different convention: the pop album as a compilation of market-tested singles.) Notably, Halsey describes the album as the first project she has written as herself, New Jersey’s Ashley Frangipane, and not under the protective cover of her alter ego. Unlike 2017’s hopeless fountain kingdom and 2015’s BADLANDS, Manic is not structured around an elaborate fictional framework. For Halsey, autobiography offers opportunity; her ability to translate the arc of her life—schoolyard misfit turned aspiring bohème turned Tumblr microcelebrity turned misunderstood pop star—is among the qualities upon which she has established her career. She does well in framing some of those personal experiences as concepts, on standout songs like the pop-rock drunk-texting anthem “3am” and the melodramatic revenge drama “killing boys,” both of which manage to flip lonely self-awareness into a kind of strength. On the former, a song that deserves a bright future as a karaoke classic, she begs: “My insecurities are hurtin’ me/Someone please come and flirt with me.” Who among us hasn’t been there? Sadly, some of the album’s most compelling moments are overpowered by the tedium of modern pop. There are painfully stretched ballads, overly sanitized rhythms, a hint of indeterminately “tropical” energy, and back-to-back booming hooks à la Sia. (Halsey’s first record company was Astralwerks, the mostly electronic label with whom Sia released an album in 2004.) Alongside guest appearances from Morissette, Dominic Fike, and Suga of BTS, Halsey’s collaborators on Manic include Greg Kurstin, Benny Blanco, and Jon Bellion, some of the world’s foremost hitmakers and shapers of the amorphous, chameleonic pop I’ve come to associate with sitting miserably in the backseat of a Lyft. Their presence here is felt a little too acutely. Though Manic features Halsey’s take on a handful of different genres—broody pop-R&B reminiscent of her early work; alt-rock-lite that is an aesthetic match to her persona; twangy country-pop sure to find a home on certain segments of pop radio—much of it has the same reflective surface and, at some points, the depth of an oil slick. The Morissette collab “Alanis’ Interlude,” which features a reference to John Mayer’s “Your Body Is a Wonderland,” is almost too irritating to endure: “Your pussy is a wonderland,” the pair warbles, infinitely more times than necessary. It is a low point for someone who is at times a clever songwriter. Despite some missteps, Halsey’s appeal is clear: It’s a singularly difficult time to be a young person, and she is warmly attuned to that reality. “I don’t wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria,” she sings on the album opener “Ashley,” framing her personal frustrations within the broader sociopolitical context shaping our collective experiences. What does it mean to be a woman in pain in a country that dismisses you? What is the significance of loneliness in a society that seems to require it? How much compassion does a broken self deserve? On Manic, Halsey proves she isn’t quite the radical she thinks she is. But maybe she doesn’t have to be.

Everything Else Has Gone Wrong,Bombay Bicycle Club,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20c39bd7f8cd0008150d4c/1:1/w_160/bombaybicycleclub_everything.jpg,2020-01-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bombay-bicycle-club-everything-else-has-gone-wrong/,Caroline InternationalIsland,"Ask 10 people to describe the sound of Bombay Bicycle Club you’ll probably get 10 different answers; it all depends when they got into them. Perhaps you thrashed along to Bombay Bicycle Club’s post-punk jams at the pub in 2009, when they released their debut I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose; or maybe you were more into the stark genre-flip of their 2010 follow-up, Flaws, which was more freakish whisper-folk. If you got into them around 2012-2014, you’d have heard more expansive ideas, and a rush of electronic lifeblood—particularly on their best record to date, 2014’s So Long, See You Tomorrow. Throughout their career, the UK band shifted from one identity to the next, and when they hit their peak, they announced they were going to take an indefinite hiatus. But as hiatuses in music are wont to do, it didn’t last very long. The band reconvened in 2018 to discuss playing some celebratory shows for the 10th anniversary of their debut album. But doing a reunion tour without new music didn’t feel right. The result is Everything Else Has Gone Wrong, a brightly hued record that combines frontman Jack Steadman’s crate-digging and synth-noodling with guitar-driven hooks. With its full-chested choruses, it’s a record that—like the eerie video for the title track in which his bandmates literally dig Steadman out of a grave—seems to cheer: “We’re not dead yet! We’re not dead yet!” The palpable joy of Everything Else indicates that the hiatus was healthy for the band. It was a decision that was born of the fact that, having found success while still at school, the four-piece has never known any other career, and were getting complacent. This is a playful record, from the swooning brass that opens the album on “Get Up” to the squiggly synth-flute sample on the shuffling “Do You Feel Loved?” Its propulsive rhythms often feel perfectly engineered for sunset slots at summer festivals. As the hook of “Is It Real” swells into a call-and-response chant, it’s easy to imagine muddy feet having fun with its frantic rhythm in a Glastonbury field. As they did on So Long, the band take great delight in disappearing down into rabbit holes of sound, as with “Let You Go,” which crescendoes in a flurry of chopped vocals, guitars, and synths. While the sound is more swaggering and unashamedly stadium-sized, Bombay Bicycle Club’s lyrics remain decidedly introverted. Steadman will sing of obsessively thinking of someone while listening to music on headphones or not being able to speak due to shyness. In the album announcement, the band indicated that this would be an album of “music in a time of crisis” and “finding kernels of hope and renewal in dire situations.” However, these strongly worded descriptions belie the fact that Steadman’s lyrics largely seem to deal with internal mutterings and a kind of personal, low-level malaise. On the muted, downbeat “Good Day,” he briefly touches on “the melting ice caps in my drink” but tosses it aside to dwell on aging, the loss of friends, and the listless refrain: “I just want to have a good day/And it’s only me that’s standing in my way”. To what extent has it become fashionable to frame music in the context of generalized “crisis”? Many of these songs don’t sound specific to 2020 in any sense other than that the Bombay Bicycle Club that made them as a grown, arena-filling version of itself. Their greatest triumph is the title track—a song that, it could be argued, adheres most closely to their theme of hope in a crisis, thanks to the hand-clap-driven, lackadaisical hook that’s an absolute joy to sing along to: “Keep the stereo on/Everything else has gone wrong.” With a synth melody that blooms red like a siren, the song builds to a fantastically proggy conclusion. But the song, which climaxes with Steadman crying out that he’s “found [his] second wind”, is ultimately about writer’s block. This is what holds Bombay Bicycle Club’s latest iteration back: a tendency for the self-referential. On “Is It Real,” they deal in nostalgia, singing about watching old tape reels, while musically weaving together strands of their different sounds through the ages: skittering drums, sweet-voiced indie singalongs, and a psychedelic break. It’s masterfully handled, but ultimately, not a “kernel of hope or renewal in a dire situation.” On Everything Else, the band reminds us why it is that they’re still so beloved after 10 years in the game (those earworm melodies are unshakeable!) but they also cling to their upper-tier festival billing without ever truly being controversial or pushing boundaries. This is the sound of an ever-curious, shape-shifting band finally finding the confidence to tell us who they really are. But they are not telling us anything we didn’t already know.

Please Daddy,Sarah Mary Chadwick,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e274e35dced8b0008d27284/1:1/w_160/Please%20Daddy_Chadwick.jpg,2020-01-23 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sarah-mary-chadwick-please-daddy/,Sinderlyn,"Sarah Mary Chadwick has spent a lot of time mulling heavy questions. In interviews over the past few years, the Melbourne singer-songwriter has discussed the immense pain of grief, the weight of religious symbology, the inner workings of Lacanian psychoanalysis, and the ways that watching Friends makes her think of her own mortality. She approaches such subjects with good humor, but the thoughtful way she dwells on them shows the kind of thinker and songwriter she is, with a sparse, quiet way of tackling grand philosophical concerns. Alone, often accompanied by just a piano, she stares at the sky and demands answers from a higher power that may or may not be listening. The Queen Who Stole the Sky, Chadwick’s 2019 album, embodied this style of songwriting more fully than any of her previous efforts. She was commissioned by the city to write for a 147-year-old pipe organ in the Melbourne Town Hall, and the resulting pieces were extraordinarily stark and piercing, even by her standards. Grappling with the respective deaths, in quick succession, of her father and a former partner, the songs are all weary sighs, the sound of a person flailing for a handhold in a slippery world. Because the music is composed of just her voice and the organ, every word she sings takes on a near-religious gravity. In interviews around that record, she worried that she might have trouble following it up. “After the organ record, I was flummoxed what I’d write about because I didn’t have access to grief for the first time in three years,” she told Bandcamp. But Chadwick’s Please Daddy picks up pretty much exactly where its predecessor left off. The very first track is called “When Will Death Come,” and in its first verse, Chadwick admits that she’s back in the same rut she often dwells in: “I thought I was [past] this, but I’m losing it.” On the title track, she sings of the dissociative creep of anhedonia, describing how she feels “amputated from my personality.” Elsewhere, she wonders what life would be like if the sun ceased to shine, and if her tears never dried. It’s a record of immense emotional pain, full of the sort of stinging, bitter songs she’s been writing her whole career. But part of what makes Please Daddy so moving is that you wouldn’t necessarily guess how heavy it is if you weren’t paying close attention to what she’s saying. The arrangements have the kind of swing that her music hasn’t made much room for before. Her songs are still pretty minimal and morose, but relative to the grayscale organ dirges of her last record, there are some positively vibrant moments. “If I Squint,” like a lot of her songs, is built around the sobbing rhythm of her languorous piano chords, but glimmering flute melodies and gilded horn flourishes color in the margins. Chadwick has even said that “When Will Death Come” was her attempt at capturing the louche self-indulgence of late-period Elvis Presley, which is telling of her approach. She doesn’t necessarily want these songs to feel like downers, even though they are. That split between sound and spirit lends another layer to the forlorn songs she’s been singing her whole career. In the genteel melodies and floating arrangements, she suggests that it’s still possible to find meaning when you’re weighed down by these feelings. Grief, existential turmoil, and religious doubt may never leave you, but life always trudges on.

The Comforts of Madness,Pale Saints,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e274246d1c15700099572cc/1:1/w_160/palesaints_madness.jpg,2020-01-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pale-saints-the-comforts-of-madness/,4AD,"In 1990, shortly after his dream-pop band Pale Saints released their acclaimed debut album The Comforts of Madness, bassist, vocalist, and bandleader Ian Masters was already feeling restless. During an interview with MTV’s 120 Minutes, he and his bandmates—drummer Chris Cooper and guitarist Graeme Naysmith—were asked if they had favorite songs from the album. Masters quickly batted the question aside. “My favorite’s always the new ones,” he told the unseen interviewer. “I get really bored of playing the same songs all the time.” It’s exactly the kind of cheeky remark you’d expect from a young musician riding the wave of a successful album (it landed at number 40 on the UK charts). But Masters’ impatience illuminates his mercurial post-Pale Saints career as well as the capricious spirit of the songs on Madness. Newly remastered and reissued by 4AD in celebration of its 30th anniversary, the album feels volatile even at its most introspective. Throughout 11 tracks, the trio maintains a tricky balance between the sugar rush of their C86 influences and the hypnotic churn of psychedelia. Nowhere is that more obvious than on their cover of “Fell From The Sun” by the Paisley Underground group Opal. In Pale Saints’ version, the gallop of the original is rendered, by turns, as a Fairport Convention-like ramble and a speedy Wedding Present fuzzfest. What this reissue makes clear is how much of Madness’ iridescent sound is the work of producers Gil Norton and John Fryer. The deluxe edition includes a second disc of demos recorded at Masters’ Woodhouse Studio. Those earlier recordings are much rawer and more direct, while revealing the strength of the bare-bones material. Fryer and Norton brought the band more in line with the 4AD aesthetic, coating Naysmith’s guitar in washed-out colors, adding layers of compression and some dub-style effects to Cooper’s drums, and finding ways to thread the songs together so that the vinyl sides flow seamlessly. The band also allowed the producers to reshape some material. In demo form, “Insubstantial” splays out a bit more, with a meandering opening section. With Norton’s help, Naysmith’s shimmering lead comes to the fore, alongside a touch of hand percussion, providing a nice counterbalance to Masters’ wispy singing. Fryer pushes “Sight of You” away from pure Spacemen 3 worship toward its dream-pop pinnacle by dialing back the delay pedal and cranking its coiled bassline. Masters may have gotten bored with it eventually, but in this version of the song, he sounds invigorated. As Masters promised, he and Pale Saints didn’t stick in this mode for long. The group added a second guitarist (Meriel Barham) and with their second album In Ribbons, steered into lusher, more measured compositions. After touring to support that record, Masters left the group, exploring more psych folk territory with Spoonfed Hybrid and ESP Summer, his project with His Name Is Alive’s Warren Defever. These days he makes what he calls “confusion jazz” as a member of the experimental duo Big Beautiful Bluebottle. It’s a wonder anyone involved with Pale Saints could keep him still long enough to record Madness. Watching and listening as Masters has spun off in as many different directions as he has only makes this album feel even more special; a brilliant, vivid snapshot of an artist and a band at the very beginning of a fascinating and unpredictable journey.

Marigold,Pinegrove,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1ced5e516bdd0008561e9d/1:1/w_160/pinegrove.jpg,2020-01-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pinegrove-marigold/,Rough Trade,"Pinegrove arrived on a promise of deep personal connection. One of the band’s early songs, “New Friends,” begins with singer-songwriter Evan Stephens Hall scanning the room for anyone he knows. When he can’t find a familiar face, it’s as if he welcomes members of the audience as fresh confidantes. In a twangy voice that can rise from a bookish murmur to a raspy yawp, he belts, “What’s the worst that could happen?” Organized around the core duo of Hall and drummer Zack Levine, two friends who grew up together in a leafy New Jersey township, Pinegrove kept spreading that sense of intimacy through their creaky indie-folk. Their breakout record, 2016’s Cardinal, opens with “Old Friends,” a shuffling, spoken-sung romp with a diaristic homecoming narrative that carries a twinge of mortality. “Should tell my friends when I love them,” Hall sings. Bigger and bigger audiences were soon singing along; their fans became known as Pinenuts; Kristen Stewart got a Pinegrove tattoo. They raised more than $21,000 for Planned Parenthood while delivering communal anthems as impassioned as they were vulnerable. A follow-up to Cardinal was just about ready to go when, in November 2017, Hall announced—via a long Facebook post—that he’d “been accused of sexual coercion” by an unnamed person. (According to a recent Pinegrove profile in The New Yorker, the accuser was “a member of the band’s crew” who had a romantic relationship with Hall that she views as “implicitly manipulative.”) After a year-long hiatus at, Hall told Pitchfork, the request of the accuser, the band released Skylight, a spare album that refined the band’s open-hearted alt-Americana. Pinegrove’s new album Marigold contains some of their signature warmth but lacks the luster that made their initial run of albums exceptional. Self-produced by Hall and Pinegrove multi-instrumentalist Sam Skinner, Marigold is endearingly rumpled, but the mood is more melancholy, more dreary. These songs find the forever-unguarded Hall in dark, sleepless nights and awestruck mornings. The most transcendent moment comes in the chorus of the opening track, “Dotted Line,” when Hall sings, joined by weeping steel guitars and the powerhouse backing vocals of former member Nandi Rose (aka Half Waif), “I don’t know how/But I’m thinking it’ll all work out.” Another balm is “The Alarmist,” where a rootsy shimmer somewhere between Nick Drake and Big Thief cushions a naked plea for reassurance. The sullen, hangdog mood can start to feel drab. Hall always seems to be singing about either waking up or falling asleep; more than one song hinges on an encounter with an animal in the road. These banal motifs make it feel like you’re shut in with someone who doesn’t get out much and, in contrast to such famous recluses as Belle and Sebastian’s Stuart Murdoch, doesn’t have much imagination about the world outside, either. There’s no blueprint for how—or even whether—a band should return after complicated sexual misconduct allegations. Though Skylight was released after the allegations, it was recorded before and shelved soon after. That album’s seeming return to basics was more like a fluke of time than a statement. Following a string of sold-out shows last year, Marigold is the first album written in the wake of Hall’s experience, one that perhaps colors the feelings of seclusion and doubt so earnestly deployed here. Whether he’s writing through it or writing around it, Hall presents as an open book. Unfortunately, this openness leaves something to be desired artistically. Some lyrics have a grating, Victorian quality: “You do upend my island,” Hall sings on one song, like a lovesick character from a Decemberists deep cut. “Let’s build us a new house for to live,” he sings on another. The charm of his confessions has dimmed considerably and the six-minute title track, a droning electro-acoustic instrumental, is simply superfluous. Even on “The Alarmist,” the songwriter who once used “solipsistic” as a lyric now pushes back at solipsism by demonstrating the discovery of object permanence: the awareness, which typically occurs during infancy, that people and objects still exist even when they’re out of sight. “When you walk away, you still exist,” Hall sings. It feels of a piece with why Pinegrove’s once bottomless well of sincerity now feels low and lukewarm. The simple has turned complicated, the signal has some static, but they still play as if they just want to find a new confidante in the crowd.

R.Y.C.,Mura Masa,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18a75ac3431b000823bda3/1:1/w_160/rawyouthcollage.jpg,2020-01-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mura-masa-ryc/,PolydorAnchor Point,"To be a young person in 2020 is to feel deeply lonely, politically distressed, and rattled with anxiety. It is also, perhaps as a result, to be obsessively nostalgic—for sitcoms, tracksuits, even old memes—clinging to memories and their soothing power. Mura Masa can testify to all of the above. The 23-year-old artist and producer born Alex Crossan recently told Zane Lowe that he spends “all his free time playing old video games, watching cartoons, and eating cereal, arrested development-style,” and revisiting the music that shaped his youth. All this rearview mirror-gazing laid the foundation for Mura Masa’s sophomore album, R.Y.C. (Raw Youth Collage), a meta-commentary about Gen Z’s fixation with the past. The Guernsey native recycles the sounds that he grew up on—a mix of post-punk, Britpop, emo, and French house—and turns them into contemporary internet-kid anthems about surviving adolescence. It’s a surprising stylistic U-turn for Mura Masa, who is best known as a forward-thinking electronic-pop producer. His debut mixtape paired off-kilter beats with vaguely Japanese flutes and strings, and his first album pinned big voices like A$AP Rocky and Charli XCX into the futuristic corners of UK club music. In both, the songs were tinny and distorted, rich with negative space. R.Y.C., in contrast, is a concept-forward guitar album that explodes with sound and feeling. Taking cues from artists like Justin Vernon, Kevin Parker, and Damon Albarn, all multi-instrumentalists who front larger projects, Crossan takes on the roles of a band, playing guitar, drums, and bass, and singing on nearly every song. Unlike on his last LP, where Crossan’s guests nearly overshadowed him, the featured artists here—mostly young, DIY, and British—fit neatly into his creative vision. They also drive home the point that R.Y.C. is neither a tribute record nor a wistful toast to the ’90s; in fact, it’s only loosely retrospective. The album’s strongest and most affecting moments, such as the Ellie Rowsell-assisted “Teenage Headache Dreams,” draw on sounds and textures from our recent memory to color a picture that’s unmistakably now. The album unfolds like a tug-of-war between two coping mechanisms: yearning for the past or passivity against the future. Crossan illustrates this conflict by toggling between two moods: He’s hyperactive and all-caps on “Deal Wiv It,” featuring Slowthai, a yelping, rambunctious rant against gentrification and culture’s oppressively cyclical nature; he’s dazed and meditative on “Today (feat. Tirzah),” a warped, looping bedroom ballad that numbs in its repetition, mirroring the habitual dread of online life. Where R.Y.C. succeeds—and where Crossan reveals a real point of view—is in his ultimate rejection of these initial frameworks in favor of something more fluid, a hybrid space in which these sounds, stylings, and emotional responses work together. This opens the field up for a few left turns. “In My Mind,” a psychedelic electro-folk song about distrusting your memory, gets submerged in a well of distorted synths and post-dubstep trembles. “Teenage Headache Dreams,” featuring Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, swings from soaring pleas to hushed recollections to a frenzied, electronic head rush. And “I Don’t Think I Can Do This Again,” at first a tender pop song with Clairo, suddenly veers underground when three iconic chords wave in the rave. (The sample was popularized by Basement Jaxx in 2001 but written by Gary Numan in 1979. Crossan, who has two autistic brothers, has said that Numan, an introverted songwriter with Asperger’s syndrome, is one of the artists he most identifies with.) In the studio Crossan is less reserved, nudging genres and eras up against each other like he’s introducing friends at a party, highlighting what makes them unique while searching for common ground. In doing so, he generally avoids the elementary mawkishness of other recent emo-dance attempts (see: the Chainsmokers) and sometimes gives the featured artist new dimensions. Slowthai, already an invigorating rap force, sounds even fiercer in the fuzzy clutches of post-punk. Similarly, Rowsell’s natural melancholy morphs into heady hopefulness in the ecstatic glow of synth pop and electro. Mura Masa occasionally trips on cliché and stumbles into pastiche. The platitudinous “Live Like We’re Dancing,” featuring Georgia, feels like an amateurish Robyn knock-off, and the disposable Ned Green interlude about his teenage girlfriend’s bedroom scans as a schmaltzy, faux-earnest play on listener emotion. On “vicarious living anthem,” Crossan disguises his feeble voice in a haze of fuzz and Auto-Tune but can’t escape his fatuous lyrics (“Everyone can be who they want to be!”), predictable guitar melodies, and juvenile overtones that feel contrived and stale. Nostalgia is most powerful when it takes us somewhere new. “No Hope Generation,” the project’s snappy, sarcastic centerpiece, achieves this. Harnessing the bratty self-deprecation of late-’90s pop-punk and the anxious shuffle of drum’n’bass, Crossan sets off on a 2020 anxiety trip through Gen Z’s preferred methods of self-care: an endless scroll of memes and meds wrapped in safe, sunshiny arrangements. “Everybody do the no-hope generation/The new hip sensation craze sweeping the nation,” he sings archly, addressing generational depression like it’s making the rounds on TikTok. The implication isn’t that all this malaise doesn’t matter, but rather that, like viral dances, music trends, and precious youth, it won’t last. “I feel so relaxed/I feel so relaxed/I feel so relaxed,” he insists suspiciously after asking for a bottle and gun. There’s something about the song’s casual angst and playful duplicitousness that feels the most like teendom—restless, reckless, fleeting.

Swirlings,Pulse Emitter,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20d435128d8f0008159acf/1:1/w_160/Swirlings_Pulse%20Emitter.jpg,2020-01-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pulse-emitter-swirlings/,Hausu Mountain,"At a recent performance in Portland, Oregon, Pulse Emitter’s Daryl Groetsch sat behind a low table coaxing otherworldly noises out of a handful of devices. A few were pretty humdrum: dented guitar pedals, a Sony Walkman, a Roland Space Echo from the 1970s. Then there was an odd, homemade contraption that looked a little like a cribbage board fitted with phono jacks; stranger still was a wood plank with three long springs screwed to it, the kind you might find affixed to a screen door. While it was hard to figure out exactly how Groetsch was generating such a cosmic swirl with his little boxes, there was no mistaking the sound of those springs: They cut through the mix like the thunder you might hear in a horror film, or a nightmare. Pulse Emitter’s Swirlings is a more placid affair, and a world away from the steampunk hodgepodge strewn across his gear table. If the murky turbulence of his live set suggested a bumpy ride through an asteroid belt in a battered escape pod, the new album—the latest in a discography more than 80 records deep and his first solo album on Hausu Mountain—evokes more blissful and hi-tech vistas, like gazing through the portholes of a gleaming spacecraft at the sweep of the Milky Way. It’s easy to fall back on science-fiction metaphors when discussing Pulse Emitter’s music. His rippling arpeggios and buoyant pads are part of a cosmic-music tradition that stretches back through new age and prog to stargazing synthesists like Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, and Vangelis. These aren’t uncommon reference points; they’ve been dominant modes in left-field electronic music since the late ’00s, popularized by artists like Emeralds and Oneohtrix Point Never. But Pulse Emitter easily holds his own against his better-known peers. Since 2002, he has developed a style that’s distinguished by its deeply expressive sensibility. That instinct is at the center of the opening “Electron Central,” in which tumbling arpeggios spin against a beatific backdrop of held tones. There’s not much to the track, just a bright, glassy FM synth lead and those fizzy background pads, but the way Groetsch teases the balance between the two, fading elements in and out, lends an almost narrative shape to its seven-minute run. Throughout the album, the tension between form and formlessness keeps things engaging. In both “Fairy Tree” and “Cloud Refuge,” minimalist pulses and rain-stick gurgle alternate with heartstring-tugging chord changes—a tactic that invites zoning out and then sneakily brings you back to the here and now, like a hypnotist snapping his fingers. At their best, Pulse Emitter’s tracks trade ambient music’s aimless drift for deep compositional structure. The dark, droning harmonies and flashes of dissonance in “Space Frost” recall the most desolate moments of Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works Volume II, yet the twisting of his whale-song melody is sketched with a calligrapher’s grace. Few ambient composers can fit quite as much feeling into such a small, off-handed curlicue of tone. “Ripples,” which sets a shape-shifting mallet and harpsichord-like melodies against characteristically bucolic chords, is even more affecting, paced to periodically deliver a tidy dopamine hit every time it lands upon a particularly plangent chord. In moments like these, Pulse Emitter feels less like a noise tinkerer or an ambient musician and more like a bona fide songwriter—just one working with some rather unconventional tools.","Daryl Groetsch’s style is distinguished by its deeply expressive sensibility.

Debris,Keeley Forsyth,by: Emma Madden,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1cc955c3431b000823befd/1:1/w_160/keeley.jpg,2020-01-22 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/keeley-forsyth-debris/,The Leaf Label,"The dancer, actress, and composer Keeley Forsyth released her debut album at age 40, after almost half a lifetime spent acting in Saturday night soaps, children’s television, and most recently, a Marvel film (she played “Mottled Prisoner” in 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy). In 2017, Forsyth experienced a physical and psychological malaise so intense that it resulted in the temporary paralysis of her tongue. Her turn to music—that cooing thing we recognize in our mother’s bellies long before we understand speech—makes a certain therapeutic sense. Forsyth rediscovered her voice through the medium, and Debris charts the laborious process of making herself heard. It’s the musical equivalent of emerging half-paralyzed from a car wreck and relearning to wiggle each toe. Forsyth’s voice, by some distance, is the most remarkable and beguiling sound on the album. Forsyth has Peggy Lee’s vibrato, Nico’s asperity, and some of the avant-garde operatics of Diamanda Galas, but you’d be hard-pressed to find a comparison that does her justice. Her voice is intuitive and somber, and occasionally, the instrumentation on Debris fails to contend with it. Forsyth first heard Matthew Bourne, the experimental jazz musician and composer who collaborated with her on Debris’ largely accordion-led arrangements, while listening to BBC Radio 3’s left-field show “Late Junction.” Bourne is known for his spare and spartan solo work, but he and Forsyth struggle to find common ground occasionally on Debris. The problem is most pronounced on the string-heavy track “It’s Raining,” which sounds more like a score for a BBC period drama than something from Forsyth’s arid world. Typically, the starker the instrumentation, the more effective the song. Producer Sam Hobbs seems to understand this; he takes care to leave in the sticky sounds of Forsyth’s mouth, the pulsing of machines, the tap of a spacebar when the recording’s complete; anything that brings Forsyth, and her desire to be heard, to the fore. Bourne’s arrangements work best at their most ambient, as on the album highlight “Lost.” “Is this what madness feels like?” Forsyth asks. Echoes of her voice drag for so long that they become circular and indistinguishable from the rest of the arrangement. The listener experiences a terrifyingly accurate simulation of Forsyth’s trauma. We are immersed; we are implicated. Nothing on this album is intended to be heard from a distance, and at its best, it’s terrifying. For an album that’s largely about depression, there’s very little interiority on Forsyth’s part. She is not a self, but a sound. The lyrics document her shifting relationship with the natural world, as depression transforms her into a voyeur of her own life, rendering people into puppets, angels into mocking spirits. Her bleak poetry verges on cliche: Forsyth’s “shadow” is “engulfed”; a broken house is rendered into a “house of thorns,” and, in a moment of juvenilia, she waits for “volcanoes to melt us into oblivion.” It’s a forgivable lapse; what Forsyth lacks in poetic originality she more than makes up for with intensity. We are conditioned to expect a note of resilience or redemption at the end of a despondent piece of art. There’s a slight hint of hope when Forsyth sings “A large oak/Descended/Grew/Roots” on the album’s penultimate song, and titling the final track “Start Again” certainly signals some potential for change. In it, Forsyth goads herself towards the direction of something new: “Oh Lord, where should I go?” she asks. The relief isn’t found on the album itself, but in the fact that with it, Forsyth can finally be heard.","On her arid and beautiful debut, the dancer, actress, and composer charts her climb out of paralyzing depression.

Modus Vivendi,070 Shake,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1f5d463c769500083382ca/1:1/w_160/modusvivendi.jpg,2020-01-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/070-shake-modus-vivendi/,G.O.O.D. MusicDef Jam,"The best moment from Kanye West’s ye, his much-maligned album from 2018, was crafted by 070 Shake. The 22-year-old singer’s chest-thumping appearance on “Ghost Town” was a glimmer of promise amid a heap of sloppy, single-take recordings, one of the few times on the album actually seemed transcendent. Her debut, Modus Vivendi, proves our ears weren’t deceiving us. The album is intensely sincere, with the New Jersey native proudly serving her soul raw atop bullish, beautiful production. It is the most compelling and complete release under G.O.O.D. Music since Pusha T’s Daytona. The heavy-hearted vibes begin immediately on the opener, “Don’t Break The Silence.” Shake’s ambered voice rises over a floating synth and describes a lover who isn’t quite ready to break things off. “If you were liquid, you’d be bitter like wine/Till then I’ma drink, stay here for the ride,” she hums out. The feelings of desire, being desired, and all the messiness in between are at the center of Modus Vivendi, a Latin term used to describe an arrangement between two conflicting parties in the hopes of coexisting peacefully. For Shake, that harmony is elusive, not only in her relationships with women but also in her own heart. On “Terminal B,” she grapples with whether the warm feelings of a relationship can be trusted, poking at it like it’s too good to be true. “Yeah baby, she’s on lockdown love,” she murmurs before immediately second-guessing herself: “Maybe she is not down.” All this heaviness is packaged neatly within bright melodies built for lovesick kids to belt out at Coachella and Rolling Loud. This gives her songs a tone of triumph and catharsis rather than total defeat, like on the hook for “Morrow,” where she dejectedly lets a partner know, “I don’t know if I’ll be here tomorrow,” but stretches out the last word in snappy fragments, similar to Rihanna’s ad-libs on “Umbrella.” She goes for a higher register on “Come Around,” where she cries out for someone to join her in her loneliness, like she’s trapped at the bottom of a well, yelling at a sliver of sky. The elasticity of her voice isn’t always utilized properly here, perhaps the result of too much experimentation in the studio. On a few tracks, she ventures too far into trap-rap territory, dumbing her voice down to a mumbled delivery, like on “Rocketship,” which could serve as a Travis Scott reference track in how similar it is to his auto-tuned sound. She dips heavily into voice modulation on the album as a whole, recently telling Pitchfork that this was done to make her sound “more real.” In actuality, it achieves the opposite effect, creating a degree of separation between her in and the listener by placing a governor on the amount of emotion she conveys. At times, you find yourself yearning for her voice to be left more naked and vulnerable. These are largely the only missteps on an otherwise richly produced album. Modus is essentially the antithesis of the half-baked works that arose from Kanye’s Wyoming sessions in 2018. It is the result of a handful of talented collaborators who provide enough eclecticism to balance out the bombastic sound of G.O.O.D. in-house producer Mike Dean. For every “Come Around” built on the same roaring synths Dean supplied for Yeezus, there’s an infectious ’80s-inspired jam like “Guilty Conscience.” “The Pines,” meanwhile, is constructed on a distorted chant similar to the one played out on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy switch-up “Hell Of A Life,” but finishes with a thunderous string arrangement, giving Dean’s sound some refreshing variance. The most inspired works, though, come from former Stills member Dave Hamelin, who gives Shake ethereal, dreamy soundscapes to navigate through, none more pretty than the closer “Flight319.” Over astral chords that conjure images of misty daybreak, Shake encapsulates her internal tug of war by alternating between lines of confidence and shame, optimism and fear. Eventually, the drums cut out and she hits a point of reflection: “Oh, I’ll never know, how long I’ll stay, how far I’ll go.” Everything is in agreement, even if it’s just for a moment.","The heavy-hearted G.O.O.D. Music debut from the young singer is a refreshingly new take on eclectic, lovesick soul music.

The Professionals,MadlibOh No,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1f3fe655a3b30008afb219/1:1/w_160/theprofessionals.jpg,2020-01-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/madlib-oh-no-the-professionals/,Madlib Invazion,"Since sauntering onto the hip-hop scene in the mid-’90s as part of the underrated Lootpack troupe, California-based producer Madlib has risen to cult status by pledging a zealous devotion to the art of crate-digging. Over the ensuing decades, Madlib’s reclusive public persona has been complemented by a hyper-prolific discography that showcases his knack for repurposing fragments of other artists’ songs into warped and off-kilter compositions. Madlib’s also become renowned for tailoring entire albums to fit a single MC’s voice—most notably his projects with Freddie Gibbs—and it’s this setup that forms the backbone of The Professionals, the first full-length team-up with his younger sibling, Oh No. Smartly, there’s a reserved quality to Madlib’s beats across the album. Chunky, soulful loops and boxy drum patterns become a sturdy platform for Oh No’s rapping. The bulk of the album showcases the MC’s conceptual chops and ability to pen topical issue-based tracks, but a few more cliché lyrical outings nestled in the mix give the project a naggingly uneven feel—and leaves you wishing The Professionals prodded just a little deeper into the increasingly fractured modern world that Oh No proves so adept at commenting on. The album’s most affecting moment comes courtesy of its final song, “Dishonored Valor.” Oh No hones in on the struggles military personnel experience when attempting to reintegrate into modern civilian life—including PTSD and the ensuing reliance on pharmaceuticals—along with the power dynamics that cause them to enlist in the first place. “I got a gang of brothers that was in the military that was dishonorably discharged/Really wasn’t cut like Rambo when the shit starts,” he raps over a gnarly backdrop of scuzzy guitar and rolling clusters of snares. “I don’t blame ’em, I would have been right there smoking weed, too/Fuck flying up in sky, diving out of B-2.” This heavyweight moment is supported by the uplifting “Made Due,” which sounds like Oh No riffing on a wonky line from Nas’s “Life’s a Bitch” logic—“That buck that bought a bottle could have struck the lotto”—by imploring people to put faith in goals and ideas rather than scant lottery odds. “Tired Atlas” is fueled by brooding piano and musings on presidents, police brutality and identity fraud; the golden-hued loops and metronomic ticking through “Timeless Treasure” prompt commentary on a capitalist country where hospital costs cause some to simply shrug and figure, “Fuck it then/I’ll just die in the crib with this cheeseburger—McLovin’ it.” Frustratingly, the power and pull of these songs is vitiated by moments like the title track—whose braggadocio simmers but never boils—and the lighter, more amorous outings “I Jus Wanna” and “Give N Take,” especially when the latter’s candy-funk backdrop is punctured by a humdrum booty-call tale. The Professionals winds up being akin to a high-quality, well-reported news special that keeps being interrupted by lighter-hearted segments—both have their own merits, but oftentimes close proximity only tempers potency.

nijimusi,OOIOO,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20b894d7f8cd0008150d44/1:1/w_160/ooioo.jpg,2020-01-21 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ooioo-nijimusi/,Thrill Jockey,"Though YoshimiO is probably still best known as Yoshimi P-We, the longtime drummer for the avant-rock group Boredoms, it’s time to stop calling OOIOO her side project. Eight albums into a discography that stretches over nearly a quarter century, the band she co-founded isn’t just one among her numerous collaborations; it represents a pillar of YoshimiO’s long and impressive career. The group’s punky late-’90s debut merely hinted at YoshimiO’s ambitions as a bandleader. Before long, OOIOO’s sound expanded to incorporate drum-circle groove, ritualistic chanting, and psychedelic tendrils of melody. Individual motifs could seem sectional, or even jarring, in isolation. Some of these same traits could be found in Boredoms’ turn-of-the-century work. But the way OOIOO approached similar postures has long felt distinct. By the time of 2000’s Gold & Green, the band landed on a method of stirring its influences into a style that could prove unexpectedly approachable. In order to keep some sense of surprise afloat, balances between the band’s aesthetic ingredients have changed in worthy ways over the years, with the starker percussive attack of 2006’s Taiga giving way to lustrous shimmers of gamelan on 2013’s Gamel. Looming over it all is YoshimiO’s playful editorial hand. In a recent interview with band’s stateside label, Thrill Jockey, YoshimiO described her freeform approach in the studio. “When we record those songs, we play them as if we’re playing a live show. After all the other members go home, I add my parts to the songs... I record the same parts that I play when we perform the songs live, but I also add phrases that I come up with spontaneously, using instruments that I’m not used to playing. It’s like having a conversation with the song.” A good conversation requires inspiration as well as a stable language. Now, with a couple decades in the rearview, it’s easier to see that YoshimiO’s drive to find this balance between the chaotic and the familiar has long been one of OOIOO’s goals. Over time, the overdubs and shifts in arrangement style have tipped listeners to the fact that the band is not on auto-pilot. But YoshimiO isn’t out to overthrow all of her prior work, either; the band’s albums frequently delight with singalong pop pleasures. It all adds up to a satisfyingly well-rounded quality that isn’t terribly common in the world of experimental rock. nijimusi doesn’t do much to mess with this underlying approach. The subtle change, this time around, has to do with the debut of the group’s newest drummer, MISHINA. (According to YoshimiO, she had to edit this drummer’s tracks less extensively than those of prior percussionists.) And despite a culminating victory lap in which riffs from the group’s past albums come back for a curtain call, the album doesn’t feel like a nostalgia trip. Instead, it’s a consolidation of the strengths that this band has been amassing over its long life. The opener gives just a hint of OOIOO’s chaotic energies: In 50 seconds, a wash of cymbals is put through a whirling, tape-like effect, leading in turn to squalling vocals and a brief hint of hardcore. A hard cut to the next track, “nijimu,” reestablishes the band’s more hypnotic quality, thanks to an attractive, descending bass motif. Throughout, there is a winning tension between the experimental touches and jammy meditations. The lightly swinging percussion in “jibun” helps root the song’s first half, when the melodic performances have a quality of purposeful wandering; the second half lurches into OOIOO rock mode, which might remind Boredoms fans of Vision Creation Newsun. Tracks like “asozan5” and “tisou”—the latter of which features striated vocals, minimalist patterns, and funk—operate as mini-suites that draw on textures the band has explored previously. But this time, the pieces are all strung together with a veteran group’s poise. That next-level group mastery also lends merit to the band’s decision to reprise some past material, as they do in a track with a mouthful of a title (but one that’s beautiful to read, as a sort of conceptual-art command): “walk for ‘345’ minutes, while saying ‘Ah Yeah!’ with a ‘Mountain Book’ in one hand, until a shower of light pours down.” If you’re fan of the group, you know “Ah Yeah!” from the album Feather Float, and “Mountain Book” from Gold & Green. But even if you don’t know the back catalog, this 11-minute opus is an excellent way to encounter some of those themes for the first time; the track’s patient ebb and flow has the feel of a mini-concert. When a band works the way OOIOO does—popping up a couple times per decade, while delivering subtle but interesting updates to a pre-established style—it’s easy to take it for granted. But that doesn’t mean we should. Certain kinds of conversations are only possible with friends of long standing.

Football Money,Kiwi Jr.,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1cc6fec3431b000823bef9/1:1/w_160/600x600bb.jpg,2020-01-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kiwi-jr-football-money/,Mint,"In 2013, Jeremy Gaudet relocated from Canada’s smallest province, Prince Edward Island, to its biggest city, Toronto. And he soon became acquainted with the cruel irony of moving to a vibrant, bustling metropolis overflowing with cultural activity and opportunity—i.e., that you often need to find a soul-sucking, creativity-stunting desk job to survive there. (A librarian by trade, Gaudet has quipped that “I work in Excel.”) A natural big-city survival strategy is to carve out a small community that reminds you of home—which Gaudet did by starting a band with fellow Charlottetown expats Mike Walker (bass), Brohan Moore (drums), and Brian Murphy (guitar). But their group, Kiwi Jr., has proven to be more than just an after-hours amusement. Nor is it fair to classify them as a side-project offshoot of Alvvays, the popular indie-pop group in which Murphy plays bass. Rather, Kiwi Jr.’s debut album, Football Money (released last year in Canada on Mint Records and now more widely available via Persona Non Grata) is a vivid portrait of acclimatizing oneself to a new hometown exponentially bigger than the one you’ve known—of being constantly bombarded by stimuli and aspirational messaging that leaves you feeling both exhilarated and exhausted. And while they may not be the only band singing about the struggle of trying to make rent in a place where “everything is out of my price range,” few do such an expedient job of making you laugh out loud while you’re dying on the inside. The very name Kiwi Jr. may elicit a smirk from a certain type of indie-rock fan, one who views New Zealand’s Flying Nun label as the Narnia of the underground, and who appreciates the nod to J Mascis’ tactic of adding a paternal suffix to avoid cease-and-desist lawsuits from similarly named artists. And the name fits: After all, if you could combine Antipodean indie rock with Dinosaur Jr., you’d essentially get Pavement—a band whose influence on Football Money is impossible to ignore. Not only does Gaudet’s voice drawl and crack in unmistakable Malkmusian fashion, he possesses a similar gift for piling on non-sequiturs about sports, scene politics, and the privileged class that cohere into uncannily pointed social commentary. Throughout Football Money, Gaudet spews a ceaseless stream of celebrity namedrops, historical figures, and local landmarks that includes, but is not limited to: the SS, James Dean, The Book of Daniel, beloved Toronto Chinese restaurant New Ho King, Ren and Stimpy, the Toronto Transit Commission, the Front de libération du Québec, the “Luke, I am your father” scene, Burt Bacharach, the IRA, Jesus, R.E.M.’s “Talk About the Passion,” Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, and the Cy Young Award. But more than just show off Gaudet’s pop-cultural panache, they provide crucial color that make these tales of everyday woe feel lived-in. On “Salary Man,” Gaudet frames the life of a rat-racing corporate suit as a sardonic superhero origin story, boasting of his perfectly Marie Kondo-ed lifestyle (“nothing says ‘home’ like a basket of folded white shirts”) and his formidable ability to make it to work on time after a night of binge-drinking. But beyond presenting a damning portrait of the typical finance bro, “Salary Man” leaves open the possibility that the most loathsome and handsomely paid office drones have become that way because they’re not able to do something more spiritually fulfilling. “I gaze through the window, there is still poetry there,” Gaudet’s streetcar-riding protagonist sings, dreaming of a life outside the financial-district skyscrapers. And when it comes to critiquing those who indulge in the spoils of unchecked capitalism, Gaudet hardly lets himself off the hook. Locomotive rave-up “Gimme More” is a cheeky indictment of instant-gratification addiction, with Gaudet reading out a shopping list of needs like a kidnapper negotiating ransom demands: “Gimme more Star Wars, gimme open barre chords, gimme more, gimme more, more, more!” Gaudet has such a witty way with one-liners, and the band is so effervescent in their execution, that it’s easy to overlook the elevated level of craft at work. Football Money clocks in at a lean 10 songs and 27 minutes, with nary a second wasted. (Only the mid-album interstitial “Soft Water Apple”—a brief, dirgey recasting of what appear to be “Salary Man” lyrical outtakes—feels dispensable.) Songs like “Leslie” and the title track breeze by at such a brisk clip, and are loaded with so many easy hooks and surprise structural twists, you barely notice that they lack proper choruses. And while it’s tempting to align Kiwi Jr. with equally erudite and urgent contemporaries like Parquet Courts and Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, winsome turns like the gleaming “Comeback Baby,” the glammy stomper “Wicked Witches,” and jaunty jangle-pop gallop “Swimming Pool” (in which Gaudet transposes his life story with the legend of Brian Jones’ death) ground the singer’s wandering wordplay in ’60s and ’70s pop fundamentals. It’s a degree of craftsmanship that earns Kiwi Jr. the right to subtweet their less imaginative peers—or even themselves. On the frenetic “Nothing Ever Changes,” Gaudet sings: “This boy knows I hate his bands/Everyone looks like a lumberjack,” before adding, with an audible eye roll, “Guitars!/More guitars!” While Kiwi Jr. are too clean-shaven and tidily dressed to pass as lumberjacks, surely Gaudet—as the frontman of a guitar-centric band making Pavement-inspired indie rock in the year 2020—is aware that such a dismissal could easily be volleyed right back at him. That just speaks to the confidence flowing through every track on Football Money: It may be slanted at familiar angles, but the enchantment is their own.","With easy hooks, surprise structural twists, and a gift for non-sequiturs, the Canadian quartet’s debut is a vivid portrait of the big-city struggle.

Coke Wave,Max BFrench Montana,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18f622c3431b000823bde4/1:1/w_160/cokewave.jpg,2020-01-19 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/max-b-french-montana-coke-wave/,DJ Whoo Kid,"It was the winter of 2007 and New York rapper Jim Jones had the biggest single of his career with “We Fly High,” a defining moment of an era where nearly everyone across the five boroughs wanted to ride around in pink Range Rovers and wear durags under their MLB fitted caps like a lost member of Dipset, the irreverent Harlem rap crew. In New York City public schools, on television, and even on the Giants’ roster, reenacting the jump-shot motion from the music video while shouting the song’s signature Ballin’! ad-lib from the top of your lungs was common practice. Before “We Fly High,” Jones was surely Dipset’s third in command, behind people’s champ Juelz Santana and their leader Cam’ron, who mentored Jones by convincing him that if he rapped about the hard life he lived, the money would come. Jones did just that with “We Fly High,” and the result was country-wide recognition and a guaranteed spot in New York rap lore. But while Jones was on BET’s 106 & Park with a chain around his neck and diamonds in his ears, the song’s co-writer, Max B, was sitting behind bars. A decade earlier, a teenage Max B, born Charly Wingate, had been sentenced to eight years in prison for robbery. He spent his time locked up working on a character that he described as a combination of The Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac, called Biggavelli—Max B for short. When Max was released in 2005, he met up with his childhood friend from the same building in Harlem, Cam’ron, who’d become immortal two years earlier, the moment he revealed his all-pink outfit in the “Dipset Anthem” music video. “Yo flee, you know I rap now,” Max said to Cam. “Let’s get this shit clickin’ like Dorothy’s heels.” Cam laughed him off, so Max met up with Mike Bruno, a hungry individual from the same block. Bruno saw it all in Max: the charisma, the swag, the endlessly quotable way he spoke. He introduced Max to Jim Jones, who was looking to form his own clique under the  Dipset umbrella. Jones put Max to work on Jones’ second studio album, Harlem: Diary of a Summer. Released that August, Max’s contributions to the album are undeniable. He shifted Jones’ style to a midpoint between the soulful chipmunk samples synonymous with Dipset and the menacing gutter raps of 50 Cent’s G-Unit crew. On “G’s Up,” Max is a star, with a memorable hook that outshines Jones’ stiff verses. Max’s two other credited features on the album use a rough melody that elevates typical street braggadocio into absurdist hood poetry: “Max B look like Derek Jeter on the shortstop/I’ll put the heater to ya’ soft spot,” he says smoothly on “Confront Ya Babe.” But while Max B’s songwriting was elevating Jones’ career, Max was relegated to the shadows. In a later Doggie Diamonds video interview, as Max counts wads of cash wearing dark shades and jeans held up by a designer belt, and repeats his signature Maxisms like “wavy” and “owww,” he vents about his frustrations with Jim Jones. “I did eight years in the can, when I came home, my job was to come home and do this shit and go somewhere.” He unleashed his cartoon character-like persona, clearly tipsy from the brown liquor he usually sipped like apple juice, his Katt Williams-like perm swaying in the wind. “Not be working for a nigga in the studio, writing songs, while he the only nigga lookin’ hot, he the only nigga...spendin’ $5,000 on his bitch.” His requests to release solo material of his own were continuously pushed aside by Jones. Instead, Jones was focused on forming his ByrdGang collective—headlined by Max and the late Far Rockaway, Queens rapper Stack Bundles—and having them work on his third album, 2006’s Hustler’s P.O.M.E.” Max’s exasperation led him down a path that played out like an inept crook subplot in a Quentin Tarantino script. Gina Conway was an ex-girlfriend of Max, who had recently returned to New York after spending time in North Carolina. According to testimony given by Conway, she was being pursued by a real estate and credit card fraudster by the name of Allan Plowden. One day in September of 2006, Plowden brought Conway back to his hotel room, where, in an attempt to impress her, he showed off a Louis Vuitton bag filled with an estimated $50,000 in cash. Later in the evening, Plowden and his business partner, David Taylor, went clubbing. Instead of joining them, Conway immediately called Max to brag, and the two began to orchestrate a robbery. Max’s plan was to have Conway steal the money while Plowden was at the club. When Conway arrived, accompanied by Max’s stepbrother Kelvin Leerdam, Plowden was unexpectedly in the room. They woke him up at gunpoint. Unable to find a sufficient amount of money, Conway and Leerdam ordered Plowden to call Taylor. When Taylor arrived, Leerdam pointed the gun at him and after a struggle, the gun went off, killing Taylor. Conway and Leerdam escaped with all the money they could find, but when the police arrived, Plowden told them about Conway. When Conway was found not long after, she said that Leerdam killed Taylor and that Max set up the robbery attempt. Max was arrested and his bail was set at $1.5 million. At almost the exact same time as Max’s arrest, Jim Jones released his third album, Hustler’s P.O.M.E. The project was Jones’ breakout moment and Max was featured on seven tracks, with writing credits on others. Despite Max’s pleas, there were no signs of Jones or the ByrdGang label coming to bail him out; he sat in jail while Jones went national. After months behind bars, Max’s manager put up property to front his bail, but he still needed cash to cover the remaining amount—rumored to be around $120,000. Pretending to be Max’s white knight, Jones came up with an idea: Max would sign over his publishing rights to Jones in exchange for cash. Out of desperation, Max agreed. In the summer of 2007, Max B was released and Jones assumed he had his songwriting guru back in his employ to work on his next album and the upcoming ByrdGang group project. Max’s solo album remained on the shelf and he couldn’t profit off of any music released without Jones’ approval. With his trial looming large, Max finally reached his breaking point. Like a comic-book origin story, Max B turned into a New York City vigilante. He gave interviews on DVDs and WorldStarHipHop that were more like wrestling promos, often drifting into the third person. Put a camera in Max B’s face and it was guaranteed he would clown rappers across the city he didn’t care for: Prodigy, Papoose, Hell Rell, and, especially, Jim Jones. During this time, Max went on a mixtape run that was equally as definitive as his interviews: Public Domain 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Million Dollar Baby 2, and Wavie Crockett. But Max B’s opus wouldn’t arrive until he developed a bond with another rapper who had a similar wish to make Jim Jones’ life hell. French Montana was from the South Bronx, at the time most known for founding one of hip-hop’s most popular DVD series, Cocaine City. Inspired by the Smack DVD series, Cocaine City became notable for a glimpse at the street life through interviews with legends like Pee Wee Kirkland, guests like 50 Cent and Remy Ma, music videos, and freestyles (though the purpose of the series was to simply give French’s nascent rap career a platform). At some point in 2003 or 2004 outside of a studio at the border of Harlem and the South Bronx, French was shot in the back of the head. He survived, and his attempted murderer was killed in the incident by friendly fire. According to French in a 2009 interview with DJ Vlad, he said that his beef with Jim Jones started when he found footage on DVDs of the Diplomat commenting on his near-death experience. In the Spring of 2008, while completing his mixtape Live From Africa, French was looking to record a Jim Jones diss track and to make it sting, he knew who to turn to. “Waavvy,” also known as “Fuck Jim Jones,” is the first collaboration between Max B and French Montana. “Why don’t you tell me why you don’t love Max B no more, because yo’ nigga not workin’ for free,” wails Max B on a hook that sounds like it was recorded with a bottle of Grey Goose in hand. After the release of the track, Max B and French became inseparable. In true New York fashion, a city where hate is stronger than love, they bonded through a mutual disgust of Jones. Together, they stalked Jim Jones through the streets of New York, named a stuffed puppy after the Diplomat before stomping on it and running it over with a truck, accused Jones of attempting to blackball their careers, and constantly referred to a misogynistic incident involving Jones’ wife that became known as “She Touched It in Miami”—you know, normal things that friends do. It was all building to the release of Coke Wave, a joint mixtape they promised would be a classic. They were right. Executive produced by Dame Grease, Coke Wave was released in February of 2009. Like Max B and French, Grease felt that New York’s household names weren’t giving him the respect he had earned—he emerged in the ’90s producing for The Lox, Mase, and contributing a majority of the production on DMX’s It’s Dark and Hell is Hot. Grease’s beatmaking on the mixtape unifies the capriciousness of both Max B and French and is the factor that brings their colorful imaginations to reality. On “We Run NY,” Grease interpolates Sting’s “Englishman in New York” into a celebratory Uptown head bopper. “I Warned U” is similarly spiritual, as the trio spin Marvin Gaye’s “I Want You” into a soulful ballad for anyone that has ever worn a Pelle Pelle jacket and NBA jeans. “I warned you/The right way/I warned you/Now look what you made me do,” French belts on a woozy hook, maybe the best that has ever left his mouth. Max B surfs over the production with a swag that justifies every third-person DVD monologue he’s ever done. The mixtape’s centerpiece is “Coke Wave,” a track that shows what the three are capable of when it’s all clicking. Max B sounds like he’s hungover singing a lullaby about drug dealing and heartbreak, French Montana’s relaxed delivery is like having a conversation with an incredibly high mob boss, and Grease’s funky production is timeless. No matter what sound Dame Grease laces them with, Max and French never step out of character; they’re going to talk about moving weight and bad decisions they made after sipping too much Remy Martin. French Montana is the grounding presence, Dame Grease may be the glue, but it’s hard to be enamored by anything outside of Max B’s animated street poetics. If you close your eyes long enough, his stories can make you wake up on a stoop on Lenox Ave. in 2009. He can painfully howl over a cinematic Young Los beat made for fare evading (“Here It Is”), he can make songs for the backroom of an NYC strip club (“Stake Sause”), or emotionlessly describe a day cruising through the city avoiding the NYPD and rivals looking for a payday (“It Gotta Be”). Coke Wave arrived during a time in New York where the city was in a desperate search for who was to be next after Dipset and G-Unit. But instead of sticking to New York’s hardened street rap, Max B and French Montana made the next wave whatever they wanted. They could hop on a classic Dr. Dre instrumental and infect the beat with the spirit of New York summer. Or could go back in time to the shiny-suit ’90s era to show off their ageless bravado and toss some subliminals at Jim Jones while they’re at it: “Backtrack two years ago I was with niggas straight hatin’,” Max says—you can picture him cackling in the booth with a plastic cup at his side after spitting that one-liner. There were no rules. In the months following Coke Wave, Max B’s trial reached a verdict. Gina Conway testified, Max B did not, and he was found guilty on nine of the 11 charges including felony murder, aggravated manslaughter, and conspiracy. On September 3, 2009, Max was sentenced to 75 years in prison. One of the final songs he recorded while free was “Never Wanna Go Back,” a rare time where he addressed his situation in the music. “I never wanna go back in there/Life just isn’t fair,” he sings painfully, losing the optimism that made Coke Wave feel celebratory. Over a decade since Coke Wave, Max B’s legacy has only grown. Some of that credit belongs to A$AP Yams, who introduced a younger generation to Max B’s music and injected his spirit into the A$AP Mob. But more so it’s been because of French Montana who has never stopped saying “Free Max B,” as murky reports of sentence reductions surface every year. In 2010, Max B was officially released from his obligations to Jim Jones. His debut album finally arrived in 2011, titled Vigilante Season, of course. The album is no Coke Wave, but feels like the closing of a chapter that Max B had been desperate to complete since the days when he first conceived the Biggavelli character. “We all gon’ die, but who gon’ leave a legacy, who gon’ be remembered the biggest,” Max B said in an interview with Hood Affairs shortly after his fallout with Jim Jones. He spent his short-lived freedom trying to cement a legacy; Coke Wave is that moment.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

UR FUN,Of Montreal,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e20baffd7f8cd0008150d46/1:1/w_160/urfun.jpg,2020-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/of-montreal-ur-fun/,Polyvinyl,"Children born the year Of Montreal released their debut album have been breezing into American bars with their government-issued IDs for two years now. The psychedelic pop project helmed by Kevin Barnes came into its stride during the indie surge of the early aughts, when widespread twee escapism offered an out from the horrors of the news under the second Bush administration. Few darlings of that era have clung to its aesthetics as stubbornly as Barnes, who injects a surfeit of color into even his most morose undertakings. He has brewed up a storm of music over the past two decades, and while plenty of it is forgettable, hardly any is drab. Cycling through galvanizing Prince shrieks, Bowie-worshipping hooks, and feathery Beach Boys harmonies, Barnes keeps his ear trained on the most exuberant characters in pop music’s past. His latest, UR FUN, keeps the party going, even if it often sounds more like a patchwork of soft-boiled singles than an album with a cohesive narrative arc. At their best, Of Montreal force a study in contrasts. Barnes is prone to sending doomy lyrics soaring atop blissful melodies nested in wispy psychedelic production. Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, a peak in his abundant discography, was a breakup record disguised as a rollicking (if frantic) good time, a testament to the way that anxiety and self-doubt can jolt a grieving person out of stasis. Its joyful moments teetered on the edge of collapse, and its bouts of melancholy were buoyed by unlikely optimism. UR FUN, by contrast, tunes its antennae to romantic love in a time of overarching social precarity. Barnes still lets nervousness guide his hand, but the stakes are muddled, as is the story. In the foreground, everything’s peachy: Barnes is stably attached and eager to sing his devotion. In the background, everything threatens to go to shit, though the specifics are generally vague. UR FUN dashes Barnes’ signature cheekiness against a backdrop of ’80s bubblegum, a format that reins in his more freewheeling tendencies. Lyrically, he reaches as ever for big concepts: “We know the universe/Must express itself as awful people, too/So we really just feel sad for you,” he chirps on “Peace to All Freaks,” seeking kernels of godliness in the trolls and fascists of the world, then dismissing them as best he can with a slight wave of pity. These clever lines rarely get space to breathe, though—UR FUN’s arrangements are so tidy, so pruned, that Barnes doesn’t give himself the opportunity to go out on many limbs. A faithful chameleon, Barnes manages a canned Bowie impression on “Don’t Let Me Die in America,” and even strays into electroclash with “Get God’s Attention by Being an Atheist,” whose chorus (“We don’t give a fuck/We want it louder”) gestures more toward exhaustion than rebellion. Turning up the noise to drown out the horror might work well enough as a short term survival strategy, but it can’t do much more than seal its practitioners away, offer shelter at the expense of connection. UR FUN—a confection, a distraction, a collection of competent and sparkling pop songs—doesn’t open itself to the world as it stands in this moment. With his sardonic wit and sharp ear, Barnes insulates himself from the dreck rather than trudge through it. Armored, he deflects his surroundings. He blisses out until he starts to go numb.

Munich 2016,Keith Jarrett,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18b482516bdd0008561db7/1:1/w_160/keithjarrett_munich.jpeg,2020-01-18 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/keith-jarrett-munich-2016/,ECM,"Keith Jarrett approaches the piano the way a star athlete courts the ball—it’s a full-body experience, marked by sweat, facial spasms, and an inability to remain still. Jarrett’s improvisational solo concerts have been characterized by this level of physicality since he began performing professionally in the 1960s, and more than half a century hasn’t hampered his game. We may not be able to see Jarrett’s piano acrobatics while listening to his newly released live recording Munich 2016, but his enthusiasm and vigor are palpable. Recorded on the final night of a European tour, Munich 2016 provides a snapshot of the piano legend in his seventies: energetic, spontaneous, and inventive as ever. Munich 2016 was recorded at the Philharmonie in the titular German city, home to Jarrett’s longtime label ECM. The acoustics are pristine, and while the room can be heard, the presence of the audience is largely absent from the tape—a good thing, considering Jarrett’s history of walking off stage due to people coughing, sneezing, or producing any combination of involuntary bodily functions. Fortunately for the listener, Jarrett does not police his own: He is so exhilarated by the music that he cannot stop himself from stomping, shouting, and humming off-key throughout the 12-part improvisational suite. There are three primary styles that shape the pieces on Munich 16: lyricism, the blues, and dizzying avant-garde jazz. “Part I” belongs to the latter camp. With a runtime of over 13 minutes, it is the record’s longest piece, and it undergoes the most drastic temperature shifts—like watching time-lapse footage of the four seasons. There is no breathing space in the piece, and while Jarrett’s right hand spends time tumbling across the higher keys, it is the constant, ominous bass thump that grabs you by the throat and keeps you still. “Part VII” is from a similar school, a brief but daring piece that clocks in at just under two minutes. It is the only track that acknowledges the audience; we hear a quick rip of applause before Jarrett launches into a fearless polyrhythmic composition. Perhaps it is Munich 16’s shortest offering because it is the most exhausting to play. Jarrett frequently alternates between styles on Munich 16, creating a dynamic sequence that doesn’t wear out any one particular method. “Part IX” is a spirited 12-bar blues, the steady structure of which allows Jarrett to solo wildly with his right hand. The dry keys seem to trip over each other, but Jarrett is too in control to let them drop completely. His atonal groans somehow function as a grounding force for the swift stunt work of his digits. “Part IV” is another blues entry, and perhaps the album’s most jovial track—a foot-stomping ragtime that calls to mind Ramsey Lewis Trio and Vince Guaraldi’s Peanuts compositions. Jarrett relieves the ear with soft, melodic passages throughout Munich 16, including the final three songs: interpretations of standards “Answer Me My Love,” “It’s a Lonesome Old Town,” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Jarrett’s grunts are absent from these last three movements, and his spare and tender playing conjures a closeness to the listener, as if you’re lying beneath the belly of his instrument. “It’s a Lonesome Old Town” is the most striking, a woozy nocturne that is so sad, its soft and sweet notes seem to sour as they linger in the air. In the last 15 minutes, Jarrett strips everything back, leaving plenty of space to interpret these beloved songs with the same reverence paid by Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and countless others. On Munich 16, Jarrett’s talent and ingenuity are self-evident—and so is his passion for the music that shaped him.

Shall Not Fade - 4 Years of Service,Various Artists,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e16314d2a80230008f3931e/1:1/w_160/shallnotfade.jpg,2020-01-18 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-shall-not-fade-4-years-of-service/,Shall Not Fade,"At the end of 2015, Bristol’s Kieran Williams launched Shall Not Fade with Alone, a four-track EP by the Australian producer Mall Grab comprising definitive takes on the lo-fi house aesthetic. Labels like Lobster Theremin, Cactus Traxx, 1080p, and Opal Tapes were also exploring and refining the sound, which typically uses the thump of deep house as a vehicle for wooziness, and depends upon melodic dexterity, swing, and the almost occult ability to conjure vibe in order to push through the murk. Over the years, Shall Not Fade has transcended over and over, with superlative 12""s from heads like DJ Boring, Adryiano, Steve Murphy, Lake Haze, and LK which gently fold disco, French house, Detroit techno, and electro ingredients into the mix. The new Four Years of Service compilation is more of a look ahead, and the label’s fresh voices prove themselves more than welcome. Harry Griffiths, in what seems to be only the second track ever released by him, offers the wistful “Since We’re Here,” which tosses a crisp break over warm pads like a windbreaker over a soft hoodie; by the time a space-funk synth line joins a bubbly arpeggiator, all seems right with the world. New signee Soela conjures a similar mood with “Sensual,” and it works just as well, particularly if you listen to it just a little too loud, a little too late, on the way home after a little too much, and sink into its gurgling echoes. Before that, though, shake a tail feather to Black Loops & Ruff Stuff’s “La Progressive,” which recreates the metallic structures of Basic Channel-style dub techno in tubular steel. Harrison BDP’s “Interference” glistens like the rainbow in an oil slick; a pitched-down vocal intones “it’s all the same, just noise,” and somehow that sounds reassuring. And 1-800 GIRLS goes downright beatific, if not Balearic, with a slow-and-low house cut called, well, “My Speedos.” This ensemble of faux congas and electric piano might come off either sexy or cheesy depending on your taste, but it’s in keeping with the beachy spirit of Big Miz’s electro gem “Sun” and Kettama’s “Sundaze,” like smuggling a beach ball into Berghain. The label’s big stars are mostly absent, as are—“Sundaze” apart—bangers. But two exceptions to this are exceptional indeed: Adryiano’s “U Used 2 Know Me” is a hi-hat-forward delight, with a bit of disco constantly filtering and shape-shifting as if the past, present, and future of the dancefloor all at once. And LK’s “Unified Love Machine” is exactly that, a device for dancing that’s well-oiled with Italo charisma and Teutonic efficiency. It’s a highlight of this compilation that doesn’t stretch the boundaries of genre as much as convincingly argue these forms are still fun. It might sometimes narcotize with comfort, or shy from explicit political engagement. But it has charm, and charm is an underrated way to connect.","After four years of releasing pioneering and transcendent techno, the UK label offers a new comp full of charm that looks ahead to its promising future.

Circles,Mac Miller,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1cf1ac3c7695000833803c/1:1/w_160/circles.jpeg,2020-01-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mac-miller-circles/,Warner,"Mac Miller’s death from an accidental drug overdose sent ripples across the rap community he helped cultivate. He was a kind-hearted collaborator and invested heavily in others’ growth, but his musical arc was left unfinished. In August of 2018, he put out Swimming, an album that was like a quantum leap in self-discovery. Then, a month later, at 26, he was gone, unable to realize that potential. Now there’s Circles, a posthumously released Swimming companion piece that gives his years of work a bit of closure. It’s the culmination of a career spent improving, a fitting epilogue to an aspirational life. Miller had worked closely on early versions of these songs with composer-producer Jon Brion, who was committed to finishing the album after Miller’s death. It’s unclear how deep Miller was into the process at the time of his passing, but this sounds like a completed work, or as complete as it can be. “This is a complicated process that has no right answer. No clear path,” his family wrote in a letter on his Instagram. “We simply know that it was important to Malcolm for the world to hear it.” If Swimming wasn’t Miller’s best album, it was certainly the one where he came into his own as an artist. There are moments on 2015’s GO:OD AM where his rapping is sharpest, 2014’s Faces accommodated his most ambitious ideas, and 2016’s The Divine Feminine is his most diverse and complete project, a testament to the community of musicians he’d established around him. But Swimming hinted at an artist who’d finally cleared his mind and found his footing. Circles provides some resolution and helps finish Miller’s final thoughts. Miller seemed to envision Circles as the completion of a loop. “My god, it go on and on/Just like a circle, I go back to where I’m from,” he rapped on Swimming closer “So It Goes.” That record was about being fine on the surface while struggling with anxiety; this one is about knowing there’s something to be done about it. Both records are about working through depression, how the bad days are long and the good days feel fleeting, but the tone is more optimistic here. The imagery of a cluttered mind is a near-constant in Miller’s final songs. On the plucked single “Good News,” he likens the recovery process to spring cleaning, which feels fitting for someone looking to hit the refresh button. “Sometimes I get lonely/Not when I’m alone/But it’s more when I’m standin’ in crowds that I’m feelin’ the most on my own,” he raps on “Surf,” a poignant realization for someone who spent his last years surrounded by throngs of fans. But it comes with an epiphany, a sort of thesis for the album: “And I know that somebody knows me/I know somewhere, there’s home/I’m startin’ to see that all I have to do is get up and go.” Circles never really opens up into a full-fledged rap album, content to push back and forth between lo-fi beat music and singer-songwriter indie folk, working almost entirely with live arrangements. After doing his most-ever singing on Swimming, he crosses a threshold into doing almost no rapping on Circles. That was the entire idea: two albums bringing balance to each other. The few songs that do have raps in them display his love of the form and improvement as a writer. On “Hand Me Downs,” he raps about moving carelessly and stumbling through the same patterns. “Hands,” the only full rap song, works through negativity while displaying the subtly knotty lyricism he fell in love with as a teenager. Miller was always trying to balance being the guy who started Facebook’s first Big L fan page with his love for the nakedness of 1970’s John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. He didn’t live long enough to get to really reconcile those sides of himself, but as halves of a complete work, Swimming and Circles come the closest. Together, they establish the rapper-producer as comfortable in his skin, no longer out to prove to naysayers he could bar out. These are mellow, relaxed songs in search of that exact state of being. “‘Fore I start to think about the future/First can I please get through a day/Without any complications,” he sings on “Complicated.” It’s more Plastic Ono Band than Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous—lots of guitars, some keys, light bass, the occasional synth line—but not beholden to any one sound. The chill-out aesthetic won’t come as a surprise to those familiar with Mac Miller’s Space Migration Tour, which transformed the songs in his catalog with warm Internet-laced grooves from their days futzing with electronica and experimental jazz. He was a huge rap nerd but he also loved the prospect of playing with a live band. These songs feel like an attempt to smooth down his interests into something comprehensive, and Brion seems like the perfect person to usher them to completion. He serves as a co-producer on most songs, an additional producer on all the others, and his work makes the songs shapelier without compromising Miller’s vision for them. When a young rapper dies too soon, fans start listening to their music much more closely, combing over their lyrics to find the writing on the wall. With Miller, you don’t have to dive too deeply. “God Speed” is rife with thoughts about going down a destructive path and on “Brand Name,” he wrote a disclaimer that proved tragically prescient: “To everyone who sell me drugs/Don’t mix it with that bullshit, I’m hopin’ not to join the 27 Club.” But Circles dispels any sense of fatalism in his music. He was still idealistic; in these songs, he is searching for a way to break the cycle, a way forward. It’s only appropriate that Mac Miller’s final musical act be one of self-reformation.

Losst and Founnd,Harry Nilsson,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e17996c516bdd0008561c0b/1:1/w_160/losstandfound.jpg,2020-01-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/harry-nilsson-losst-and-found/,Omnivore,"One night in 1974, Harry Nilsson saw blood on his microphone. He was recording his exuberant album Pussycats—produced by friend and fellow hellraiser John Lennon—and the two artists launched into a screaming match to determine who could produce the most ragged, self-destructive wail. Nilsson won, at a price: His once-pristine, three-octave tenor was tarnished for good, never to regain its shining high end before he died in 1994. Losst and Founnd, Nilsson’s first posthumous album, is a constant reminder of that fateful night. His voice is deep, frayed, and faded—qualities that marked his work in the last half of the ’70s, but never masked his rare gifts as a songwriter. However, on this new collection of songs—assembled by Nilsson’s longtime friend, producer Mark Hudson—Nilsson’s renowned talent often feels lost in the glut of over-the-top arrangements, flashy production, and cheesy songwriting. Early in his career, Nilsson was prolific. Following his 1966 debut Spotlight on Nilsson, he released at least one record per year for over a decade. But Lennon’s death in 1980 had a crippling impact on him. Earlier that year, he’d released Flash Harry; in the wake of Lennon’s murder, it became the last album Nilsson made in his lifetime. For years after, Hudson attempted to coax Nilsson out of early retirement, and Nilsson eventually played Hudson demos of songs he’d been working on. Those recordings have become Losst and Founnd, but the final product is a mixed bag: wry ballads reminiscent of Nilsson’s heyday as a pop prodigy, tributes to the Beatles and Nirvana, and an unfortunate anthem for the L.A. Dodgers. It’s a lot to sift through, and its jumble can feel disorienting. Losst and Founnd features some of Nilsson’s closest friends and family—his son Kiefo plays bass on several tracks, Hudson produces, and composer/instrumentalist Van Dyke Parks and drummer Jim Keltner contribute—but even in their hands, the source material simply isn’t Nilsson’s best. Sometimes, the arrangement and production disappoint as well. Take “Lullaby,” a sweet bedtime nocturne that could have been written for classics like Nilsson Schmilsson or The Point—except Harry’s vocals are slathered in reverb, and the track is tainted by corny electric guitar riffs. “Woman Oh Woman” suffers similarly by processing Nilsson’s voice through what sounds like a tin can. On these particular tracks, however, the songwriting is strong enough to withstand the studio gimmicks. “Woman Oh Woman” opens with Nilsson’s trademark cynicism: “If you knew true devotion,” he sings, “You’d jump into the ocean and drown/Goin’ down/Thinkin’ of me.” Parks’ accordion bobs beneath like the sea itself. Producing Losst and Founnd was an emotional task for Hudson, who told Final Sessions podcast host Joe Levy that he often “felt Harry in the room.” During the album’s best moments, I felt him, too. “U.C.L.A.,” for instance, sounds like a dispatch from the old Harry—a lolling melody that seems so effortless, it’s as though it floated in on a seaside breeze. It’s the most pared-back offering on Losst and Founnd, and easily its best song. Sure, there are drums and dobro and B3 and then some, but the component parts complement Nilsson’s dry vocals instead of overwhelming them. I almost feel alone with Nilsson as he laments the loss of friends, New York, and the Beatles. Throughout the song, musical homages to the Fab Four abound: Paul’s bass slide from “Come Together,” a trumpet doodle from “Penny Lane,” a string segment from “Yesterday.” It’s a masterful composition up to snuff with Nilsson’s previous body of work. Unfortunately, most of Losst and Founnd forgoes subtle interpolation for late ’80s decadence—and it’s just too much. The title track opens with slashes of electric guitar, then piles on horns, stabbing synths, and something called a bowljo. The effect is “We Are the World” without the charity. “High Heel Sneakers/Rescue Boy Medley” pumps the brakes a little but reeks of dad-rock with its peppy brass section and faux-gospel backing vocals. That said, it’s still worlds better than the penultimate track, “Yo Dodger Blue,” a Jock Jam that spares no bell or whistle. It stuffs in handclaps, wailing guitar, skronking sax, and audience participation, all led by Nilsson’s rallying shout: “Yo Dodger blue, L.A. loves you!” It makes “Who Let the Dogs Out” sound like “Hallelujah.” Nilsson has always had a knack for writing melodies that are difficult to forget, and this is unfortunately the case with his one song about baseball. At one point in the studio, Hudson says he sought Nilsson’s council on whether to enlist Kiefo for Losst and Founnd. “Harry, should I do this?” he asked—and he heard an answer. Despite its defects, Losst and Founnd is an honest document of Harry Nilsson’s creative process in his final years, and our first glimpse at his last wishes. It’s certainly not perfect, but it’s easy to understand the need to release it. At best, Losst and Founnd is a way to feel closer to Nilsson, no matter how long it’s been since he left us. *(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","On the first posthumous album from the prodigious singer-songwriter, his renowned talent often feels lost in the glut of over-the-top arrangements, flashy production, and cheesy songwriting.

There Is No Year,Algiers,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18ad080eafcf0009d39ef0/1:1/w_160/algiers.jpg,2020-01-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/algiers-there-is-no-year/,Matador,"Atlanta author Blake Butler’s 2011 novel There Is No Year follows a family struck by a plague of paranormal activity. They move into a new house and reality bends around them. The hallways constrict and contract, nicking elbows and knees; the television signal is blurry for normal channels, but the premium porn station comes in crystal clear; caterpillars spawn in the mailbox. Relentlessly tactile, the book elliptically channels ennui and loneliness into weird, semi-humorous horrors that fester beneath the family’s otherwise normal life like mold. For their third album, gospel-punk outfit Algiers, who describe Butler as a friend, have adopted the title and the mood of the book. Built around extracts from an epic poem written by frontman James Franklin Fisher, the record is saturated with dread that smolders under his scorched-earth polemics. Unlike their past records, which were awash in musical allusions and references to global struggles, There Is No Year is narrower and more internal, a shift that results in leaner, more intuitive songs. The horrors Algiers conjure—colonization, oppression, dispossession—remain diffuse, but as a unit they sound more in sync. That focus is baked into the record. Whereas their debut was built from years of file-sharing among band members and The Underside of Power was recorded between touring and sessions across the UK and the US, There Is No Year was made in two weeks in one place. It also has only two producers, Ben Greenberg and Randall Dunn, who bring an arsenal of synths and a knack for layering sound. The result is songs that feel less leaden and overthought, like album highlight “Chaka,” which sways from a soulful disco bop to a flurry of atonal noise without the slightest bit of friction. Algiers songs have always been busy, but for once they sound loose, open-ended.  

The problem with the record is that this expressive turn is half-hearted. Fisher remains addicted to vague allegory and generic revelation; his writing conjures fire and brimstone but lacks the heat of the flame, the stink of the sulfur. “We all dancing to the fire,” he warns on “Hour of the Furnaces.” “Streets are raining fire/We’ll be gone now any day,” he prophesies on “Wait for the Sound.” These moments are supposed to feel urgent, but he could be talking about climate change or Burning Man. There’s no texture to his writing, no scene-setting—just intensity. On single “Dispossession,” he sits atop a mountain, looking down on a flaming America and promising that “freedom is coming soon.” For whom? When? What does it look like? Fisher speaks like a prophet, but his visions remain frustratingly opaque. There are times when he seems to be addressing personal demons. “Misophonia,” the poem from which the lyrics are sourced, was reportedly composed during a “protracted personal period of anxiety and lack”; the title means “hatred of sound.” A musician detesting sound could be a fascinating subject if it were developed more, but the writing is too closed off to make searching for an entry point feel worthwhile. While the rhythm section molds these lapses into more imagistic, evocative shapes (the synth fills on “Unoccupied” are killer), the tracks are still structured around Fisher’s impassioned vocals, so when he falters, the whole enterprise feels aimless. Given the chaotic sprawl of their past work, it’s refreshing for Algiers to turn inward and attempt to ground their righteous fury in soul-searching rather than the entire history of global oppression. Unfortunately, even when invoking personal anguish they make conflict feel atmospheric instead of something rooted in bodies and experiences. There’s precedent for more cosmic and conceptual accounts of struggle. Bands like Sunn O))) (who Dunn has produced for), the Comet Is Coming, and Priests have distilled grand ideas into arresting narrative, in both word and sound. And Algiers’ audio zines, the last of which invoked the Algerian revolution to explore angst and uncertainty using thickets of drone, show that they are capable of more nuanced writing .  But they haven’t yet learned to translate the political into the personal, to turn abstract ideas into matters of the gut.

You Can Never Have a Long Enough Head Start,Floral Tattoo,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1f3a9b55a3b30008afb214/1:1/w_160/floraltattoo.jpg,2020-01-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/floral-tattoo-you-can-never-have-a-long-enough-head-start/,self-released,"“I haven’t left this room in 14 days,” goes the key line in Floral Tattoo’s most popular song to date. “14 Days” was also the most uplifting song on the Seattle band’s 2018 debut, Approaching Bearable, which should give you an idea of its overall emotional tenor. At least frontperson Alex Anderson was willing to entertain the possibility of breaking free from the feedback loop—the one where the only relief from memories of childhood bullying, the confusion of gender transition, and a demoralizing job at McDonald’s (“Death by Minimum Wage”) was filling up a journal with unflinchingly miserable lyrics. “I wanna write songs that evoke feelings of adventure! I want to write songs that make you want to fall in love!” Anderson cried, while their diaristic lyrics underscored a subtle, purposeful belief that they themselves were too far gone for any of that. Two years later, Anderson and co-songwriter Gwen Power are still stuck in their apartments, false nostalgia, or dead-end service gigs, but Floral Tattoo’s revelation of a second album goes places: a Minneapolis punk flophouse filled with Twin/Tone vinyl, a college radio station in 1980s Boston or Athens, an mp3 blog in 2008, a five-band Philly gig in 2009 capped by a 10-minute Snowing set. They call their work “music for sad trans people who grew up at the dawn of the digital age,” but You Can Never Have a Long Enough Head Start is willing to conceive of real moments of happiness, albeit only attainable off the grid. The album opens with “(foreward),” a manifesto for queer revolution, and twice invokes Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as anti-capitalist antiheroes, Floral Tattoo’s own Bonnie and Clyde. “She” is every bit as exclamatory as a Los Campesinos!/Against Me! hybrid should be, while the surging acoustic strums of “Leaving” evoke the Cure singles that counterbalanced their monolithic despair with fleeting exuberance. Likewise, as soon we catch a glimpse of Power and Anderson laughing and whooping over the possibility of ditching their possessions and living in a bus headed nowhere, they follow it with a one-minute burst of folk-punk nihilism called “Don’t Try Things.” In a less fraught moment, this conceptual scope and post-emo shape-shifting might have resulted in something along the lines of Harmlessness or Goodness, albums whose utopian aspirations can feel sadly naive in light of Floral Tattoo’s 2020 reality. They’re a band with big ideas, coloring their feel-bad rainbow with bells, spoken word, melodica, euphonium, and an interpolation of Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs.” But they’re still recording in their apartment, and the lo-fi production that covers everything in a gritty, gray vapor takes on metaphorical heft. With a bigger budget, “Oar House” could’ve fully actualized a majestic rising tide of Pacific Northwest dreamo. But would that really serve a song that commiserates about cleaning toilets? The pixelated distortion of “Oar House” gives it a properly sickly pallor, as if staring through stifled tears at the Puget Sound or driving a shitty car to work with a hangover. It would be nice to say that Anderson and Power have transmuted their substantial and justifiable anguish into transcendance, and while You Can Never Get Too Much of a Head Start is already one of the year’s first word-of-mouth successes, it’d be a lie to call it a triumph. “The Art of Moving On” and  “(my life fell apart this year)” end the album with a rousing, shitfaced salvo of no-fi pub-punk, a rare instance of modern emo that aspires more to The Airing of Grievances than The Monitor. But Floral Tattoo are never subtle, and the titles say it all: If this sounds euphoric, it’s the euphoria of truly hitting bottom, of finding freedom in the knowledge that things can only get better because they can’t get any worse.","They may still be stuck in their apartments, false nostalgia, or dead-end service gigs, but the upstart Seattle emo band’s revelation of a second album goes places.

Purple Haze 2,Cam’ron,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1797803c76950008337e35/1:1/w_160/camron_purplehaze.jpg,2020-01-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/camron-purple-haze-2/,Killa Entertainment,"Cam’ron’s career hit its zenith with Purple Haze. Take it from the man himself, who regularly calls it his greatest album. And with good reason: Purple Haze fully realized the joy of Cam’s idiosyncratic humor, dadaist impulses, and high-fashion fantasies. A decade and a half on from its release, it remains the purest distillation of the rapper’s polychromatic vision of Harlem. Can Cam’ron can still cut it at that level? His output has slowed, and his last major outing was on 2018’s dismal Dipset record Diplomatic Ties. Sure, Cam has talked up a Purple Haze sequel for years, but it’s not unreasonable to wonder if the 43-year-old just stamped the title onto these 16 tracks to puff up interest in his new music. Fear not—Purple Haze 2 is very much forged in the spirit of the original. Resurrecting a strand of mid-2000s New York hip-hop built on tightly wound samples and a reduced emphasis on bass, the record has little interest in chasing modern rap trends. And while it doesn’t take a laryngologist to tell that Cam’s voice has thickened over the years, his flow finds a smooth pocket and his writing is as solid as it’s been in ages. Cam works hard to evoke the spirit of his opus from the opening bell. Long-time collaborators the Heatmakerz build “Toast to Me” around a vocal loop and crashing drums as the star allows his knotty writing style and boundless references to run wild. Here, Cam pays homage to Harlem hoodlum Rich Porter, compares his driveway to the Golden State Warriors’ championship run because his cars sit “back-to-back,” and criticizes the American healthcare system (“Doctors, insurance, nah, they can’t afford all that/One day you’ll be coughin’, next week you in a coffin, Jack”). If nothing else, Purple Haze 2 proves Cam’ron’s brain still doesn’t operate like that of any other rapper. As has often been the case in recent years, Cam’s lyrics skew more towards the autobiographical than the surreal. It’s fun hearing him reminisce about his 2003 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor and gleeful “I got dirt on you doggy” taunts of its host. But more revealing are his ruminations on his early life. Over the nostalgic piano chords of “Losin’ Weight 3,” Cam revisits himself as a 14-year-old determined to buy his grandmother a washing machine. When local drug dealers who admire his basketball skills refuse to recruit him into their operation, Cam and a friend instead rob a couple at gunpoint and lie to his grandmother that the new appliance came from money won on the court. It’s classic Cam—flooded with rich detail and three-dimensional characters. When he recalls growing up alongside the late Big L and “the dude supposedly killed him” on “This Is My City,” his famously strict rules on snitching force him to concede, “When the time’s right I will tell you about these villains.” It’s a reminder that, even after all these years, there’s still so much of the Cam’ron story we don’t know. Yet if the original Purple Haze is the creative spirit powering this record, it’s also the standard to which it will inevitably be compared. The gulf between the two is apparent: Instead of “The Dope Man,” Cam’s brilliant East Coast re-imagination of NWA’s ode to a drug dealer, we get him unimaginatively rapping over the familiar sounds of Mary Jane Girls’ “All Night Long” on “Keep Rising.” There’s no potential single here to match “Down and Out,” the best 2004 Kanye West beat that Ye didn’t put on The College Dropout. Guest spots from Dipset are missed, with only Jim Jones making a late appearance on closer “Straight Harlem,” and strangely for one of the funniest skit-makers of all time, there are zero skits. But never mind these gripes. While it’s no match for the original, Purple Haze 2 still gifts us Cam’ron at his most natural and approachable, rapping for the joy of the form.","Resurrecting a strand of mid-2000s New York hip-hop built on tightly wound samples and a reduced emphasis on bass, Purple Haze 2 is forged in the spirit of the original.

The Circus EP,Mick Jenkins,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0ed484f3d2500009bb071b/1:1/w_160/TheCircus.jpeg,2020-01-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mick-jenkins-the-circus-ep/,Cinematic,"The world is like a circus, reckons Mick Jenkins—hence the title of his latest EP. But the record doesn’t really feel like one. The big-top experience is about chaos and sensory overload—the visceral sensation of the unpredictable that causes hearts to jackhammer. In contrast, Jenkins’ The Circus is measured, soothing, and a suitable accompaniment to brandy and a cigar in a comfortable chair. Never accuse Jenkins of being unambitious. The Healing Component was a concept album about love that somehow found fresh angles on the well-worn subject, while Pieces of a Man borrowed its title and tone from Gil Scott Heron. At seven tracks, The Circus narrows Jenkins’ scope. Following such epic tomes, there are shades of Kendrick Lamar’s untitled unmastered. in the EP’s “just a bunch of good tracks” layout that will please casual listeners who find Jenkins’ albums difficult to penetrate. The circus concept might be a wash, but we still get a sense of his sonic philosophy—in Chicago’s pluralistic rap scene, Jenkins’ soulful style is closely aligned to that of Saba, Chance the Rapper, Noname, and Vic Mensa’s Innanetape. The booming bass and grueling keys of the Hit-Boy produced opener “Same Ol” aside, Jenkins sits calmly in the pocket, letting the soul-noir beats wash over him, softly reading from his book of rhymes. Without a strong sense of direction guiding his every move, Jenkins’ mind is free to wander. An artist whose work has dovetailed with the Black Lives Matters movement, he reasserts the message over the neo-soul sounds of “Carefree,” a pushback to racial profiling carried out by law enforcement. “If you living carefree then you probably don't look like us,” he spits before walking through a couple of oppressive interactions with cops. There’s a belligerency to “Flaunt,” meanwhile, with Jenkins grumbling, “Niggas wanna see me stunt, huh?” in a protesting tone. Despite references to his $3,000 watch and dim-sum lunches, the track feels more like a pushback to those who would box him into common hip-hop tropes—like spitting braggadocio about your bank balance—than pride at the ice on his wrist. Mick has plenty of fun, though. He displays instinct for a solid bar on “I’m Convinced,” where he rhymes “Cappadonna” with “Black Madonna” while referencing the pop legend’s erotic photoshoot with Naomi Campbell and Big Daddy Kane. Then there is the gentle orchestration of EarthGang collaboration “The Light,” which encapsulates the breezy side that defines The Circus musically. So while this feels like minor release—a “prelude to my forthcoming album,” the rapper has called it—Jenkins proves that even his strayest thoughts are worth sharing.","On what he’s called a “prelude” to his next album, the Chicago rapper sets aside the big themes of previous records and luxuriates in letting his mind wander.

Making a New World,Field Music,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e18abacc1e1350009acf1a5/1:1/w_160/fieldmusic.jpg,2020-01-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-music-making-a-new-world/,Memphis Industries,"For their eighth record, the English art-rock band Field Music have made a concept album about the aftermath of World War I, aka the 20th century. Originating at London’s Imperial War Museum, Making a New World begins with a song based on a graphical recording of the last shots fired in the war and goes on to cover everything from women’s suffrage and Tiananmen Square to the invention of the sanitary napkin. “A Change of Heir” is about Dr. Harold Gillies, who pioneered skin grafts for injured soldiers, while “Money Is a Memory” is about a German treasury officer preparing documents for— You know what, I’m sorry, but I can’t. Who listens to pop music and thinks about stuff like this? How do they do it? True, World War I is a hot topic, with historical relevance to current nationalist successions and Russian shenanigans, not to mention 1917 storming the Oscars. It is interesting that Gillies performed one of the first gender affirmation surgeries, and that Germany paid its last WWI reparations in 2010. But I only know this from reading about the album, which I only did in order to write about it. Music is the best way to learn about emotions, but the worst way to learn about facts. Without context, which Field Music’s medium can’t provide, you’re left perplexed by the obscure narrative perspectives and wondering why on earth these guys are singing about menstruation. The music, though lively enough, feels distant in its concerns. The album’s fussy construction, with lots of small instrumentals and half-songs, is tiresome. By the end, it’s hard to remember much of what happened. To be fair, there are some good ideas here. Opener “Sound Ranging,” an interesting blend of beauty and terror, is one of the best instrumentals, with a beat like distant artillery fire. But there’s still the desultory throat-clearing of “Silence” before the record finally gets going with “Coffee and Wine,” which tenses and glides through a bouncy groove, sparkling politely, like the Clientele trying to be Franz Ferdinand. There’s plenty of slinky, string-bendy rock and junkyard percussion to come, much of it tinted with lemony vocal harmonies redolent of Africa, or at least of David Byrne. And when the Brewis brothers aren’t funking it up, they like to climb high into incomprehensible almost-falsetto regions, in prog rock’s “maybe this is a melody?” tradition. Near the end, the short tracks almost take over: There’s a little synth interlude, a little piano, someone practicing a guitar scale for 30 seconds; it’s as if the album is crumbling away. Then, speeding out of the tuneless electro-rock of “Nikon, Pt. 2,” comes “Only in a Man’s World,” a big Peter Gabriel moment. “Why should a woman feel ashamed? Why, why, why?” David Brewis wails. “What kind of civilization/Has made the necessary/Conditions for procreation/A luxury?” He goes on to conclude, “Things would be different if the boys bled, too.” This is patently ridiculous—not the idea itself, but him singing it, in this setting. This is a product of the gap between what the album purports to say and what it could possibly say about its subject matter, and here ridiculousness breeds. There’s a familiar, overriding sense of a couple of guys reading something about history and having a lot to report. If you don’t mind the idea of These New Puritans as your dad after a Ken Burns binge, you’ll find signs of life and creativity within Making a New World’s overall confusion. If not, no one could blame you for moving on.

in case i die first,Chynna,by: Veracia Ankrah,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1769a4a676f50008a7f2f6/1:1/w_160/incaseidiefirst.jpg,2020-01-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chynna-in-case-i-die-first/,TWIN,"Chynna is honing her craft, balancing her braggadocio and combative jabs on equally violent and hollow sounds. On her fourth EP, in case i die first, the 25-year-old Philly rapper is letting the world in on a late-night car-ride therapy session, full of convoluted, introspective thoughts where Chynna is both the shrink and patient. Each song juggles self-doubt caused by the ex-lovers and friends that fuel her distress and the reassurance that emerge once she finally decides to kill her bad behaviors before they kill her. Having openly battled depression and opioid addiction, Chynna’s latest project centers defining moments of sanity and rejecting everyone’s projections to aid her swaggering rebirth. Chynna is not just a model cosplaying as a rapper, but a Philly native birthed by same the grit and grime as Ruff Ryders’ Eve and Murder Inc.’s Charli Baltimore, who use their aggressive rhymes to cement their validity in the male-dominated realm of rap. Like Eve and Charli, Chynna’s jarring rhymes are not confounded by her femininity or androgynous tone, but rather the Ford Models signee doesn’t hesitate to let you know she is an attractive woman that is aware of, but not reliant on, the power of her pussy. Women rappers turn their sexuality into a measure of power, but similar to Rico Nasty’s gut-wrenching lyrics, Chynna also dismisses the notion that her beauty supersedes her talent. On “gin,” Chynna masterfully connects “mustang” and “nuts hang,” challenging male counterparts and ensuring those words will be used in phonics exercises for years to come. In working towards demolishing her self-doubt, Chynna questions the authenticity of her platonic friendships as she recognizes how easy it is to fall back into depression. “Kamikaze soldier/[who] suffers from dark kinks” she raps on “gin,” displaying her proximity to toxic friends and environments. Her smooth delivery sits evenly amid heavy bass production that almost turns her voice into a percussion instrument. Introspection is the main theme here; it feels like you’re inside her head trying to follow along with her train of thought. Her flow is similarly herky-jerky: The melody of “asmr” almost imitates it. Although Chynna is transparent in her self-analysis—relatable to any woman contemplating dismissing a boy-toy versus keeping him around for convenience—it’s still hard to connect to this brief project. The illusory raps, the ghostly production, the seeming randomness of its moments, all create a mood that’s unique but difficult to translate. And despite the slight deviations in tempo, all four songs on in case i die first run the risk of sounding like one long song. But we see more of who Chynna is as an artist, warts and all, which is never a bad thing.","The short EP from the Philly rapper might not be essential but it reveals more of the fascinating dark side of her artistry.

I Disagree,Poppy,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e15f3ccb46c9a000885c066/1:1/w_160/idisagree_poppy.jpg,2020-01-15 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/poppy-i-disagree/,Sumerian,"Since the very beginning, there has been a darkness buried in Poppy’s heart. It’s there in the earliest videos uploaded to her mysterious YouTube channel back in 2014, in which the character—portrayed by an actress and musician named Moriah Pereira—performed simple tasks against a white background, occasionally delivering surrealist monologues. Her very first video featured her eating cotton candy in a way that might feel familiar to fans of ASMR videos: Her lips smack, her throat rumbles, she makes satisfied “ahhs,” but something’s off about the whole thing. Audio and image are out of sync; nothing sounds quite like you expect it to. It was an unsettling beginning, and in the ensuing years, she’s only plunged further into uncomfortable territory. One of her early popular videos, for example, features her staring into the camera as she teaches the viewer how to load a handgun. In another, she makes explicit reference to one of 4chan’s most notoriously noxious message boards. Unlike a lot of people who have set about parodying the strangeness of influencer culture, she and her collaborators—chief among them the director and producer Titanic Sinclair—have seemed uniquely attuned to the surreal perversity that lurks in the shadowy underbelly of YouTube culture. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that some of the platform’s more unsavory figures have been outspoken fans of hers. She’s fluent in the lingua franca of the internet’s darkest parts. The music attributed to Poppy over the years hasn’t always mirrored this side of her work. Her first album was a collection of wheezy ambient compositions self-consciously designed to “help facilitate a full night of sleep” and made, she says, with guidance from doctors who study sleep at Washington University. She’s made several albums’ worth of sugary bangers for Diplo’s Mad Decent label and a sci-fi synth soundtrack to a graphic novel. But her new album I Disagree is her first to fully follow through on the upsetting qualities of her video works, adding the grim aesthetics and curdled riffing of nu-metal, grindcore, and industrial noise to the seasick melange of her music. The record’s opening track, “Concrete,” is typical of her approach here. After an air-raid siren, she whispers about wanting to be buried alive, covered in concrete and turned “into a street,” before launching into a series of proggy vignettes. There’s a section that sounds like the Body’s sludgy electro-metal, a paisley pop chorus that’d be at home on a Kinks record, and a series of gurgly riffs that’d rank among Slipknot’s grossest, all before culminating in what sounds like an arena crowd chanting her name, followed by a coda that sparkles like “Blank Space.” Like, say, 100 gecs or the recent Grimes singles, part of the joy in I Disagree comes in how overwhelming it is. No single passage lasts very long, which gives even the prettier moments an unstable feeling, like everything might at any moment crumble into a void of distortion and noise. Throughout, her lyrics are venomous and apocalyptic. “Bloodmoney” castigates hypocrites and evil men who hide behind the banner of religion. “Don’t Go Outside” evokes the imagery of biblical plagues, with frogs falling from the sky. The title track explicitly welcomes the end of the world, assuring, “We’ll be safe and sound when it all burns down.” None of the situations she explores are especially specific, but it’s striking—as the world burns and nuclear war once more feels like a distinct possibility—to hear a reminder that chaos can be cleansing, that calamity is the first step to starting all over again and building something new.","The cryptic YouTuber’s new album is the first to fully embrace the upsetting qualities of her video works, folding elements of nu-metal and grindcore into her seasick melange.

Lina_Raül Refree,LinaRaül Refree,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e15fbc42a80230008f39312/1:1/w_160/lina.jpg,2020-01-15 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lina-raul-refree-lina-raul-refree/,Glitterbeat,"There’s something satisfyingly audacious about Lina_Raül Refree, the debut album from Portuguese singer Lina and one-time Rosalía collaborator Raül Refree. Lina’s ambitions for the project were “to do something different with fado,” brave enough given the genre’s cultural status in her homeland. To do so she recruited Refree, a Barcelona guitarist and fado newcomer, to cover songs associated with Amália Rodrigues, a singer so iconic that the Portuguese government declared three days of mourning when she died in October 1999. Lina was attracted to Refree for his work on Rosalía’s debut album, Los Angeles, where he helped the Catalan singer tease a modern edge out of the traditional flamenco style. Lina felt that they could do something similar with fado, a goal they achieve here, albeit in a very different fashion. Los Angeles largely employed flamenco’s traditional acoustic guitar and vocal palette, experimenting instead with production and form; Lina_Raül Refree keeps the words and melodies of the source material intact but ditches fado’s bright acoustic guitars in favour of piano and analogue synths. In what is an admirably stubborn move, the acoustic guitar only turns up on the album’s final track, “Voz Amália De Nós,” a song originally recorded by António Variações using synths. The production throughout is minimal to the point of austerity, creating an intimacy that feels like standing with the duo in a darkened room: “Ave Maria Fadista,” for example, uses just echoing piano chords and a hint of distortion. Yet there is still room for the two to give rein to their experimental instincts. “Destino” is haunted by the kind of synthesiser throb that suggests a nervous headache, while “Maldição” combines low organ drone with a faint synth arpeggio, lending the song a distinct air of disintegration. Drama comes in small musical quirks, from the touches of multi-tracked vocal on “Barco Negro” to the cute, two-fingered piano riff that leads “Cuidei que Tinha Morrido.” Listeners steeped in Amália’s canonical work may balk at this approach but, to an outsider, the duo’s methods feel respectful, the production modestly taking its place behind the songs’ timeless melodies and Lina’s gorgeous vocals. The singer possesses a voice of fiercely intimate power and texture, capable within one brief musical phrase of tempting a bird to the windowsill and blowing the opera doors clean off, as in the show-stopping melodrama of “Quando eu era Pequenina.” The ghostly double tracking of Lina’s voice on “Fado Menor,” meanwhile, is a thing of wonder, two thin layers of sibilant vocal echoing tantalisingly out of phase, like a pair of rippled reflections on an otherwise still lake. The songs’ melodies are equally potent. The Portuguese idea of saudade—a notion of longing that scholar Aubrey Bell defined, in his 1912 book In Portugal, as “a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist”—is closely linked to fado, and you can hear a kind of inexhaustible yearning in songs like “Gaivota” or “Quando eu era Pequenina,” piano chords crashing over your hopes like dirt on a coffin lid. Ever since Rosalía hit big with El Mal Querer, the Spanish music industry has been hoping for an artist to follow in her wake, reinventing traditional music to a global audience. Lina_Raül Refree suggests they may have been looking too close to home. Lina and Rosalía don’t necessarily sound alike; fado and flamenco are worlds apart, after all. But their musical perspectives are similar: respectful but questioning, drawn to emotion and the grand gesture rather than generic convention. Lina_Raül Refree is no Los Angeles clone. But it could be a long-lost, slightly weather-beaten cousin.

Mogadisco - Dancing Mogadishu (Somalia 1972–1991),Various Artists,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e176c460eafcf0009d39d3d/1:1/w_160/Dancing_Mogadishu.jpg,2020-01-15 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-mogadisco-dancing-mogadishu-somalia-19721991/,Analog Africa,"For years, Samy Ben Redjeb has been traveling across Africa and Latin America in search of forgotten sounds: vintage funk and myriad hybrids, offshoots, and variants that proliferated in the post-colonial era. Since 2006, his label, Analog Africa, has turned up dusty recordings from Benin, Togo, Ghana, Angola, Burkina Faso, Congo, Senegal, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Colombia, Brazil—many of them rarely, if ever, heard outside of the communities that produced them. But it’s likely that Mogadisco - Dancing Mogadishu (Somalia 1972​-​1991) represents his most ambitious project to date, given Somalia’s woes. A former colony of the UK and Italy, Somalia endured a 22-year military dictatorship throughout the 1970s and ’80s, followed, in 1991, by a civil war that continues today. Though civil life in Mogadishu has rebounded since a new government was formed in 2012, the Al Qaeda-linked militant group Al Shabab remains a threat: In late December, terrorists plowed a truck laden with explosives into a busy intersection in the capital, killing at least 79. Amid such persistent security threats, a city once described as “the pearl of the Indian Ocean” is widely considered a danger zone for travelers—Ben Redjef was accompanied by armed security escorts—which only makes his archival efforts there that much more valuable. Analog Africa previously explored Somali music via a reissued pair of LPs by the Dur-Dur Band, a legendary Mogadishu group and long-time house band at the city’s Jubba Hotel, who blended funk, soul, and disco with styles like daantho, a northern Somali rhythm resembling reggae’s relaxed cadence, and saar, a trance-inducing ritual style, into a rich, intoxicating fusion at once familiar and strange. But Mogadisco represents a far more extensive look at the country’s recent musical past. In 2016, equipped with little more than the names of a few Somali acts gleaned from diggers’ lore and dubbed cassettes, Ben Redjeb turned up in the port city and finagled an introduction at Radio Mogadishu, whose archives house decades’ worth of the country’s musical history. He spent weeks going through stacks of aging reel-to-reel tapes and digitizing the most enticing finds; he spent years more tracking down surviving musicians, many now living in exile, and interviewing them. As is typical for Analog Africa’s releases, the liner notes here constitute a vital complement to the music, illuminating the stories both personal and societal—a young shepherd who found fame thanks to a singing contest in the big city; a beloved bandleader electrocuted on stage by faulty wiring—that lend meaning and emotional resonance to unfamiliar sounds and opaque cultural cues. Ben Redjeb’s tastes run toward the heavy and mind-bending—as one might guess from a release like African Scream Contest: Raw & Psychedelic Sounds from Benin & Togo 70s—and Mogadisco follows suit. (The liner notes document an amusing exchange with Omar Shooli, who is displeased that Ben Redjeb has chosen the echo-soaked, reggae-inspired “Hab Isii,” never a hit in its day, over one of Shooli’s “nice” songs, the ones he performed at weddings and important ceremonial occasions.) The best material here sounds unlike anything else. Shimaali & Killer’s “Hoobeya” runs lilting call-and-response vocals through tinny reverb and wraps them up in reggae guitar and slinky drum machine; Iftin Band’s “Sirmaqabe” pairs spacey synthesizers with spaghetti-western twang and horse-clop drumming. Both songs make a strong argument that dividing lines, whether geographical or musical, are purely notional. It is a sad irony that musicians so opposed to the fixity of borders would have their fates determined by the whims of mapmakers: All three Dur-Dur songs here were recorded abroad, while the band was exiled in Ethiopia and Djibouti; Shimaali and Killer fled to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, where Killer died in 2008. On some songs, a kind of uncanny-valley effect takes hold: Omar Shooli’s “Hab Isii” sounds almost like 1960s ska—at least, until the organs and singing come in, twining around each other in a strange modal embrace. Fans of Ethiopian jazz will find plenty to love, particularly in the lilting sax and organ riffing of Dur-Dur Band’s “Daradaa Muxibo”; throughout the album, pentatonic scales and keening vocal performances lend an eerie, melancholy undertone to up-tempo funk jams—a bewitching contrast. The musicianship, too, is stellar. From their three songs included here, it’s easy to see why Dur-Dur Band became legendary: Their intuitive grasp of funk’s elastic pocket, combined with the way they play with empty space and sonic textures, would stand out in any context. But the backstories of these songs make some of them even more remarkable. The title of Bakaka Band’s “Geeisyada Halgamayow,” a side-winding, Hammond-led funk burner marked by all manner of twists and turns, translates as “Brave Fighters”: The government-sponsored group was tasked with inspiring troops on the front lines of Somalia’s war with Ethiopia. There’s a narrative implicit in the histories being told, one familiar from other Analog Africa compilations, and much of it comes down to the importance of radio. Radio Mogadishu, a government station, played a unifying role, helping draw people to the capital from remote corners of the nation. They brought with them the musical styles of their towns and villages and, in the city, blended those with cosmopolitan styles—rock, disco, reggae—carried on the airwaves from even farther away. It is a story of openness that is at stark odds with the past few decades of Somalia’s history. The booklet includes an interview with Abshir Hashi Ali, the aging caretaker of Radio Mogadishu. A former police colonel, he was tasked with protecting its archives—an estimated 100,000 songs—when violence broke out in the early ’90s and Mogadishu was divided into clan-controlled enclaves. Over the years, he has seen the station targeted by Al Shabab, bombarded by Americans, and ransacked by looters; in one confrontation, he threw himself upon a grenade-toting thief who was determined to gain control of the building. “I… told him that we would both die before he took the keys from me,” Ali recalls. “I wasn’t joking and he understood that. So he left.” It’s in moments like these that the real importance of a project like this becomes clear. It’s easy to view a compilation like Mogadisco as yet another crate-digger’s search for funk’s holy grail—or, more cynically, to read the references to armed guards and suicide bombings as a kind of adventurism. But the music contained within constitutes the story of a people, a story currently in danger of vanishing, as Radio Mogadishu races to digitize its vast store of disintegrating tapes. “I have dedicated my life to this place,” says Ali. “I’m doing this so it can get to the next generation; so that the culture, the heritage and the songs of Somalia don’t disappear.” Mogadisco is one small but essential step toward reclaiming that legacy for a global listenership.

A Jump From the High Dive,Sean Henry,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e3afdb7c76f0009ccb543/1:1/w_160/ajumpfromthehighdive_seanhenry.jpg,2020-01-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sean-henry-a-jump-from-the-high-dive/,Double Double Whammy,"From fanny packs to Pokémon Go to Mariah Carey’s 25-year-old No. 1 song, ’90s nostalgia is a hell of a drug—one that Sean Henry employs throughout his second studio album, A Jump From the High Dive. The East Coast singer-songwriter has said that he wanted to create a record that was accessible and “listenable for anybody,” an objective he accomplishes to a fault. His college-rock melodies and boyish vocal delivery waver between charming and cloying, delivering a pleasant, vapid stream of would-be earworms. In 2018, Henry did what any burnt-out artist low on cash would do: He left New York City, where he’d resided and often performed at the now-defunct Silent Barn. Returning to suburban Connecticut, he honed his craft and invested in sharper production that boosts High Dive above its predecessor, Fink. He studied the likes of Radiohead, Oasis, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, on a mission to create his own modern guitar pop record—the kind that might’ve spawned a surprise hit 20-some years ago. The affable electric guitar chugs of songs like “Space Kicks” and “You Fall Away” aren’t nearly as catchy as the Chili Peppers or as sophisticated as Radiohead. Rather, High Dive feels indebted to the brisk guitar pop of Foolish or Keep It Like a Secret—records emblematic of ’90s indie rock underdogs. Plenty of current artists take inspiration from that era: (Sandy) Alex G, Spencer Radcliffe, and even the Double Double Whammy founders who played in LVL UP have tapped similar nostalgia without allowing it to eclipse their individuality. While Henry’s not alone in his appreciation, hardly anything here feels new. Even the “yeah”s of opener “Can U” approximate Collective Soul’s “Shine.” It takes dedication to make an on-the-nose throwback like the boisterous “Surf Song,” but High Dive lacks any distinguishing eccentricities. Worse, many of Henry’s lyrics are undercooked or almost comically immature. “Rain, rain, come to me/Come to me today,” he croons on “Rain, Rain,” a song he began writing at age 8 in hopes of getting Little League practice canceled. He rhymes “halo” with “lay low” and “head up” with “fed up”; earnest phrases like “I think you’re cool and I like you a lot” and “mellow like Jell-O” feel like Nickelodeon dialogue. It seems Henry wants to dig deeper, but when he turns to heavier subject matter, such as fleeting memories of his late father on “Can U,” it’s so shrouded in banality that you might miss it altogether. High Dive was conceived with high aspirations, but it runs out of steam on the very first spin.

Rare,Selena Gomez,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e17685255a3b30008afadbc/1:1/w_160/rare_selenagomez.jpg,2020-01-14 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/selena-gomez-rare/,Interscope,"Selena Gomez was reborn from a hermetically-sealed fantasyland back into reality when, in 2015, she released her second solo record, Revival. It was the pop star’s beginning of a transition away from Disney incorruptibility towards songwriting that better represented the crossroads at which she found herself. Unlike the overproduced electropop of her 2013 debut, Stars Dance, Revival reflected her expanding sexuality, power, and interest in telling her own stories; Gomez actualized these objectives by posing nearly nude on the album cover, serving among its executive producers, and working with specific songwriters to help translate her experiences. As she proclaimed on the title track, it was her “time to butterfly.” Over the next five years, Gomez’s journey towards emancipation would be challenged by serious struggles with anxiety, depression, and chronic illness that sidelined her music career and threatened her life. But in 2017, the same year she underwent a risky kidney transplant due to complications from the autoimmune disease lupus, Gomez shared a series of genre-curious singles including the Talking Heads-sampling “Bad Liar.” After checking the cultural pulse, the then most-followed woman on Instagram logged off, removing herself from the public eye once more. Besides popping up for the occasional movie role or fashion collaboration, Gomez focused on herself. “I just needed to let my old self go,” Gomez told Zane Lowe this month. When Gomez shared the ballad “Lose You to Love Me” last fall, it seemed like the work she put into her physical and emotional wellness had clicked. The song looks at the ways she lost herself in a relationship and solemnly promises to never make that mistake again. While dropping hints at which supposedly “Sorry” singer had been dragging her down, Gomez reclaimed her own narrative. Her anguished soul-searching struck a nerve: “Lose You to Love Me” became Gomez’s first Billboard No. 1. Though the song’s drama is an exception, its moral of losing love and gaining self is the guiding ethos of her third record, Rare. While none of these 13 songs attempt the subtle weirdness of “Bad Liar” and the emotional thesis—self-love!—can be a bit one-note, Rare is the 27-year-old’s most cohesive record to date. It feels spiritually in tune with the woman who once cheerfully told Vogue that people would be surprised to learn how much she loves “depressing things.” But Rare’s celebration of autonomy, resilience, and growth is overwhelmingly upbeat. After waving goodbye to a lover who does not respect her worth on the blissed-out self-titled opener, Gomez cleanses her heart with an electro-pop party on “Dance Again.” Dancing through pain is by now a tried-and-true motif in pop music, but the sentiment holds extra weight for Gomez, who undoubtedly knows from her lupus how it feels to be powerless over your body. But Rare doesn’t dwell on heavy realities like chronic illness or the ice-cold grip of depression or, really, any sadness lingering after heartache. When Gomez looks back on toxic relationships wracked with mistrust or self-sabotaging anxiety spirals, her perspective is more grateful than regretful, as if to say that everything in life is a valuable lesson. Gomez’s biggest hurdle as a musician has long been her voice. Low and breathy, her understated vocals are better suited for intimate contemplation than big, belted catharsis. For the first time, Gomez seems to have a grasp on her range and mainly sticks to a husky, bedroom-eyes murmur instead of attempting bravado. Her best performance arrives on the muted, throbbing “Vulnerable.” Though the wordplay can be a bit heavy-handed—“If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?”—Gomez sounds firm and assured even when she dips into a whisper. Guided by a vast team of songwriters and producers including Swedish duo Mattman & Robin, Simon Says, and Finneas (of the Eilish brood), Gomez dips her toes into some du jour sounds: “Ring” does a diet-“Havana” with a “Smooth” riff thrown in for good measure; “Fun” aims for a “Bad Liar” redux with a snappy bassline, handclaps, and bubbly frivolity; “Cut You Off” plays with downtempo funk and a familiar yoo-oo-oo chorus. Notably, the songwriting duo of Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, whose melodic playfulness was all over Revival, only appear together on “Lose You” and its clubby companion single “Look At Her Now.” But Gomez’s malleability can also be her downfall. Though she has a writing credit on every song, a majority of the tracks on Rare’s second half feel impersonal and underwhelming. These songs feel like they could be sung by anyone, and you can’t help but wonder what Gomez saw in them. On “People You Know,” she avoids confronting any real feelings of regret by wallowing beneath a frigid, tiptoeing beat and stale chorus. The trumpet-tinged kiss-off “Kinda Crazy” feels totally inconsequential. Any reference to the relationship-in-question’s halcyon days is so submerged in tired figures of speech about fire and water that their actual separation feels anticlimactic. What is meant to be a seductive liaison on “Crowded Room”—which features a middling appearance from rapper 6LACK and borrows a feeling from Cassie circa 2006—comes off as lethargic and forced. Rare’s insipid gear shift culminates with its closer, “A Sweeter Place.” Despite his brief contribution, the song feels dominated by the melodramatic-stoner aura of its guest, Kid Cudi, all Auto-Tune and heavy synths. If only the song focused on unpacking one of Rare’s most compelling—albeit cheesy—lines: “Holding hands with the darkness and knowing my heart is allowed.” Sadly, this intriguing notion of finding dignity in depression is erased by a painfully vapid chorus: “Is there a place where I can hide away/Red lips, French kiss my worries all away/There must be a sweeter place/We can sugarcoat the taste.” “Vulnerable ain’t easy, believe me, but I go there,” Gomez proclaims near the beginning of Rare. Maybe so. But it’s difficult to come away from Rare with any real perspective on who Gomez is other than that she doesn’t want to be the person she was, whoever that similarly mysterious shadow was. Unfortunately for pop stars everywhere, exposing your soul does not equal examining it. Gomez tries, but never quite succeeds at doing either here. Her introspection can only go so deep when it’s paired with sleek, easy songwriting that lets her slip by, just another specter.

Dreamin’,Friendship,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1605dc3f9de50008f09b7e/1:1/w_160/dreamin.jpg,2020-01-14 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/friendship-dreamin/,Orindal,"Anyone in Dan Wriggins’ social circle might soon find themselves in a Friendship song. Much of Dreamin’ finds the Philly-based singer-songwriter relaying frank conversations as they happen, occasionally edited to take the shape of lyrics and hummable melody. Friendship’s third album operates at the speed of an audiobook and is often just a feathery guitar or brushed drum tap away from being a cappella. A song like “Dusky” would earn every descriptor of “front porch” music—casual, faintly rustic, existing slightly out of time—even if it wasn’t literally about spending time on the front porch. Wriggins ordains a six-pack of Pabst, goes to get a smoke, appreciates the company, and the song ends. There’s no room for subtext in Friendship, except for its central songwriting principle: everything is exactly what it seems and it’s downright disorienting to confront this level of transparency. It’s a similar formula followed on 2017’s overlooked gem Shock Out of Season, an arresting contrast of glacial synths and Wriggins’ convivial warmth, dropping life lessons and endearing pep talks (“It’s easy to tell that you’re doing right/If it feels like losing”) in a casual, calm tone as if his hand was constantly resting on your shoulder. Add in his bald dome on the cover, and it was easy to imagine Majical Cloudz reincarnated at a Philly house show. As with Shock Out of Season, Dreamin’ dropped with minimal fanfare last November, a record best enjoyed at one’s own pace, headphones on in the encroaching winter chill, reflecting on the past year. But while the personnel and instrumentation remain similar, Dreamin’ is slightly more earthy and expansive, more drafty and dry than its predecessor. (Perhaps this is owed to Wriggins and drummer Mike Cormier serving as live-in groundskeepers on a pastoral Swarthmore property while writing Dreamin’). There’s still resonant drone and drum machine clatter adorning the edges of “I Don’t Have to Imagine Your Love” and “Clairvoyant,” which otherwise aspire for a timeless sentimentality honoring the enduring influence of Kath Bloom and Willie Nelson. But even the machinery sounds organic—they don’t sound like “synths” so much as small machines with corroded batteries, the kind of things you’d find in a garage alongside some rusted tools. There’s a parallel between the band’s IRL handiwork and musicianship on Dreamin’, which is likely the quietest album of 2019 made by a quintet with guitars. Each member shapes, prunes, and manicures the surroundings of Wriggins’ curious musings on the minor pleasures that fill our lives: a wordless communication between friends, a resolution to be less judgmental, a belief in small moments of kindness, and honesty as the only effective weapon we have left. It’s no slight to say that the songs on Dreamin’ often don’t feel like songs, but honest human interactions that just so happened to be set to music. Yet while the intimacy of Friendship is their definitive quality, it also sets the limitations of Dreamin’, an album so focused on and trusting of its immediate circle that it forgets everyone else outside of it. “Low But On” more resembles switched-off Low, its brushed drums and cyclical riff circling the drain. And despite the foregrounding of Wriggins’ lyrics, “Hex on the Barn” and “Sure” too eagerly replicate a listless, porch-lit bull session that you can fade in and out of at will. “Blessed are the places that grant us patience,” Wriggins drawls, and that’s Friendship’s energy: a desire to embrace the present, but without the exhausting urgency demanded by self-help books and futile New Year’s resolutions. He concedes to living on the verge of hopelessness in a world of hatred and lies within the first two minutes of “I Don’t Have to Imagine Your Love,” just like the rest of us. It’s kinda hard to believe the guy, but that’s not really a slight, rather a reflection of a kind of humanity on Dreamin’ so pure that it’s virtually superhuman.","The third album from the Philadelphia-based quintet, led by Dan Wriggins’ spare and transparent songwriting, creates a warm and disorienting mood.

And I Revel,Shimmer,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e17a06c0eafcf0009d39d78/1:1/w_160/andIrevel.jpg,2020-01-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shimmer-and-i-revel/,Decoherence,"Each of the four members of New York band Shimmer have spent the better part of the past decade exploring the frayed fringes of rock music. Anina Ivry-Block and Nina Ryser make chattery, absurdist miniatures as Palberta. Paco Cathcart’s solo endeavor the Cradle is an idiosyncratic exploration of “analog natural jank.” Simon Hanes, once a member of the psycho-surrealists Guerilla Toss, makes intricately arranged instrumentals as Tredici Bacci. As exploratory and otherworldly as their music is separately, their work together is stranger and uglier than anything they’ve made on their own. Shimmer take the foundations of rock music—the flailing riffs, soaring harmonies, stuttering drum beats—and chew them into gritty sludge. The clearest evidence of this comes midway through their 2017 debut, when they hit a segment of a song called “Not Fade Away” that draws on the oft-covered Buddy Holly standard of the same name. The guitar parts are sickly and curdled, ping-ponging in and out of rhythm and key. The drums stagger wildly. Ivry-Block sings an approximation of Holly’s first two lines in a desperate yowl, then spends the rest of the song making up the words or singing outright gibberish. The whole song is so crumbling and busted that it’s tough to even call it a cover. Maybe it’s not. It is demonstrative of their approach as a whole: proudly making music that sounds loud, messy, and wrong. Shimmer’s second album, And I Revel, is a refinement of this overarching idea, insomuch as it concentrates the acidic bite of their music more strongly than ever. From the first moments of opening track “Bring It to Me Now,” Shimmer’s component parts congeal into an acrid ooze. Cathcart and Hanes’ guitar and bass lines swim around one another, seemingly agnostic to the martial plod of Ryser’s kick drum. Ivry-Block screams over the top in a painful-sounding squelch that’s more or less impossible to decipher. Pieces like these feel similar to what they’ve done in the past—and, for that matter, to a lot of bands who have drawn on the lineage of no wave’s atonal rasp—but they’re better than ever at manipulating the dynamics. “All the While,” for example, follows the record’s squirmy opening into a jittery, ecstatic energy that sounds like an AmRep band too caffeinated to see their frets straight. Smartly, there are quieter moments throughout And I Revel, too. The melting ice cream truck interlude “Wet Absence,” the music-box melodies of “Enter the Rounds,” and the hymn-like ballad appended to the end of “Nightvision” only underscore the record’s terrifying disjointedness. Unlike a lot of bands working under the broad umbrella of noise rock, Shimmer don’t rely on many obvious effects or studio tricks to carry the weight of their wonderfully ugly recordings. They’re dry, which amplifies their bludgeoning nature—it’s as if there’s nowhere to hide, no corner safe from the bulldozing energy. If it sounds upsetting, that, on some level, is the point. But consider: A host on Antiques Roadshow once took a taste from a bottle of urine, human hair, and old brass pins and, based on the rusty, oxidized taste, thought that it might be vintage port wine. There’s less distance between disgusting and beautiful things than you might think.","Chewing the foundations of rock into gritty sludge, the New York quartet proudly makes music that sounds loud, messy, and wrong.

Le Piano Englouti,Brunhild FerrariJim O’Rourke,by: Jon Dale,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e176e1355a3b30008afadc2/1:1/w_160/lepianoenglouti.jpg,2020-01-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brunhild-ferrari-jim-orourke-le-piano-englouti/,Black Truffle,"A number of thrilling things happen throughout “Tranquilles Impatiences” (or “Quiet Impatiences”), the second piece on Le Piano Englouti (The Sunken Piano), an album of realizations of work by the composer Brunhild Ferrari. A jittery, nerve-jangling scrum of tones underpins “Tranquilles Impatiences,” a tense chorus of high-pitched sounds that acts as a constant destabilizing force. Their “imperturbable wriggling,” as Ferrari describes it, scratches an arc over more peaceable, low-end drones that fold together like a fabric at the core of the piece. The tension that builds throughout—not so much between these two core elements as because of their parallel co-existence—makes for something of a white-knuckle ride. Shorter than previous realizations, this version of “Tranquilles Impatiences” has raw impact. Brunhild Ferrari composed “Tranquilles Impatiences” using material by her husband, the late French-Italian composer Luc Ferrari—specifically, five of the seven tapes he created for 1977’s Exercices d’improvisation. In that context, they existed as sequences of electronic music, the grounding force for improvisations by up to eight musicians. They serve a different purpose here, yet there is something in their dynamics, their strange playfulness, that reflects both Luc Ferrari’s humor and thoughtfulness and Brunhild Ferrari’s sensitivity and compositional acumen. If the spotlight has, until recently, been trained predominantly on Luc, it’s worth noting that the couple collaborated intensively over more than 40 years together, with Brunhild first helping out with paperwork and administration before Luc encouraged her to record and compose. Between them, Luc and Brunhild Ferrari created a unique musical world, one where sounds were porous and active, and where an interest in the sonic aspects of everyday life met an engagement with the cinematic possibilities of organizing sound. Luc Ferrari’s approach to composition was multifaceted—playful and witty, sensuous and seductive, rigorous yet never alienating—and Brunhild increasingly took part as an editor and recordist, a collector of sounds, and a voice on some of Luc’s recordings. (A 2013 quadruple-CD set on Shiiin, Contes Sentimentaux, featured a series of 11 radio dramas broadcast between 1989 and 1994, consisting of dialogues between Luc and Brunhild about Luc’s work, set over corresponding Ferrari compositions.) Over the decades, Brunhild Ferrari would be a significant interlocutor in her partner’s work, and a powerful creative force in her own right. Jim O’Rourke’s role on Le Piano Eglouti is as co-interpreter, assisting in performing the pieces on synth, tapes, and electronics at SuperDeluxe in Tokyo in October 2014, and subsequently revising and remixing them in 2019. He’s a perfect choice: A serious student of electroacoustic composition, he’s long been vocal in his support of the work of Luc Ferrari. Recalling his first meeting with Ferrari in Paris, he told The Wire’s Rob Young, “I actually bit right through my lip when he walked past me. I was so fanatically worshipful, I was terrified to meet him.” His deep understanding of both electroacoustic composition in general, and the Ferraris’ work in particular, is brought to bear on his performances here, interpreting Brunhild’s compositions with rare sensitivity. You can hear lingering traces of the experience, perhaps, on his recent four-hour album To Magnetise Money and Catch a Roving Eye, which shares a similar compositional surety. In the same discussion with Young, O’Rourke made a perceptive observation about what set Luc Ferrari apart from other musique concrète and electroacoustic composers, including those he worked alongside at the pioneering music institute INA-GRM: “[He] was the only one that I felt paid attention to what the sounds were.” This is something that Brunhild Ferrari continues to do; you can hear it in “Le Piano Englouti,” where she is particularly aware of the interwoven possibilities of the raw material at her disposal. As she writes in her liner notes, the sounds for the piece were recorded “in 1996, at a Greek island almost swallowed by its noisy Aegean Sea, and in 2010, at a very isolated and silent Japanese island.” In her narrative of the piece, the noise of the sea and the pachinko parlor “end up swallowing a foolish piano.” Though perhaps not as immediately successful as “Tranquilles Impatiences,” it is compelling in its own way, weaving recordings of everyday phenomena within washes of electronic disturbance. The piano advances and then recedes, swamped or overturned by other sounds, a slow-building push-me-pull-you between the various elements. Episodic and deliberate, “Le Piano Englouti” is a focused drift of possibility.","Brunhild Ferrari, the longtime partner of Luc Ferrari, is a powerful creative force in her own right.

Vanquish,Popcaan,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e14f4a938d6ea000871f908/1:1/w_160/popcaan_vanquish.jpg,2020-01-13 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/popcaan-vanquish/,OVO SoundWarner,"Popcaan and Drake have been courting each other for quite some time. There was the OVO Niko directed video, the “No Tellin” interlude, the “Know Yourself” outro, the lost “Controlla” verse. Popcaan appeared in Drake’s short film, Please Forgive Me. Popcaan has shielded Drake from criticism of his vampiric use of dancehall music. Drake got an unruly tattoo. Popcaan remixed Drake’s “Hype” for OVO Sound Radio. In late 2018, Drake finally “officially” signed Popcaan to OVO Sound. His first release on the label, a mixtape called Vanquish, only brings diminishing returns. The decision to classify Vanquish a “mixtape,” much like the one made for 2015’s If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late, feels like an attempt to control the narrative. Dubbing it a treat for fans takes some of the pressure off of Popcaan’s OVO debut. The distinction between an album and mixtape is even more dubious in dancehall, a subgenre without much industry or infrastructure dominated by deejays and sound clashes, its very name a nod to its function in live settings. Popcaan’s first act at OVO is not to push forward but to look back. The mixtape is a bit like a recent Popcaan retrospective that sounds simply like a companion piece to his last album. His 2014 album, Where We Come From, was a landmark moment for dancehall, cohesive and autobiographical, as much a pop record as a reggae one. It wasn’t just narratively driven, it felt like an ode to life along the Jamaican coastline. Unlike the uniformity of Where We Come From, his last album, 2018’s Forever, was decidedly less organized. Vibrant and manifold, its 17 tracks didn’t really hold together. It seemed to exist in diametric opposition to his debut. Not only was it more spiritual, but it was also more luxurious. Vanquish is on the same wave, seeking health, wealth, and love in the new year. Popcaan once sang that he’d “empty di MAK 90 inna your face and gone” and that the police would find his foes dead in the street like a dog on a song called “El Chapo,” but he has turned a corner toward preserving his quality of life. His songs are categorical here: they are either about living extravagantly and skirt-chasing, seeking salvation from a violent world or trying to defend his empire. “Did what is due to Caesar/Dem wan’ see mi life hard, everyday man life is gettin’ easier,” he toasts on “Father God Ah Lead.” Most of the songs, lifted by his weightless and shining vocals, are joyful, but Poppy can’t help peering over his shoulder. If Popcaan picked up anything from his new boss, it’s a king’s paranoia. Since inheriting the throne from Vybz Kartel, Poppy has been to dancehall what Drake has been to rap; Drake has mostly groused about the many usurpers lurking in the shadows since his coronation, and Popcaan seems to be feeling the same heavy head. Dancehall is hyper-competitive by nature, and Popcaan is no stranger to silencing pretenders to the crown, but Vanquish is the first time he really seems on edge. “Opportunist and di hypocrite par/Badmind and envious, dem always at war/Mi nuh trust dem, mi nuh mek nuh loose par/Pussy dem ah pray fi see mi behind bar,” he sings on “Jah is For Me.” “Can’t wait pon police fi dweet/By time di jeep dem reach/People done spread out pon street,” his sings on “Can’t Wait,” citing poor response times from cops as the reason he’s heavily armed. He makes himself sound like he’s a gunslinger in the Old West, but these anxious moments scattered about feel tonally inconsistent with the rest. Since Popcaan and his new label made this project low-stakes, it’s only fair to listen on those terms, and it’s hard to hear this as anything other than an intro to Popcaan for OVO fans who haven’t been paying close attention to the impact he’s made across the Drake discography. There’s nothing new or revelatory, but Popcaan is still one of dancehall’s most stunning performers and it’s painless to appreciate this as easy listening. The glistening sheen of “Promise” is a pleasant compliment to his translucent voice. The loverman come-ons of “Gimmi Love” are made passable by the contrasts of his Auto-Tuned grumbles over a xylophonic bounce. The only real ballad is “One Ting Alone,” a dedication to his one true love: weed. He sings the phrase “I can’t do without you” with a profound sense of commitment. So many of the songs find a genre-straddling star in stasis. After all, dancehall has given American pop music in recent years, it’s nice to see Popcaan finally make a serious play for its audience. But a half-measure like Vanquish isn’t going to move the needle.","The dancehall artist’s first act at OVO is not to push forward but to look back. The mixtape is a bit like a recent Popcaan retrospective that sounds simply like a companion piece to his last album.

Garden Party,Dopolarians,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e14f71bb46c9a000885bfc2/1:1/w_160/dopolarians_gardenparty.jpg,2020-01-13 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dopolarians-garden-party/,Mahakala,"Several months after a group of inveterate, predominantly southern jazz musicians—Alvin Fielder, Kidd Jordan, Kelley Hurt, Christopher Parker, Chad Fowler, and the sole northerner, William Parker—gathered in New Orleans to record Garden Party, the drummer died. At 83, Alvin Fielder was a legend, neither entirely unsung nor given enough due for his conversational, free jazz-inflected style. Fielder left some of his most indelible marks in Chicago, as a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and a collaborator with Roscoe Mitchell and Sun Ra. Yet it’s fitting that his career ended in the Louisiana bayou, the birthplace of jazz, with a group that does not stray as far from the genre’s roots as the improvisational pedigrees of its most notable musicians might lead one to expect. Like Fielder, tenor saxophonist Jordan and bassist William Parker are avant-gardists—Jordan carries the torch for improvisation in New Orleans, a city that has largely eschewed the more chaotic developments in 20th-century improvisation for a continued embrace of the big-band sounds of its past. A longtime denizen of downtown Manhattan, Parker is famous for his adventurousness, which led him into the loft scene of the 1970s, through an accessible, revelatory series of recording sessions with the William Parker Quartet at the turn of the last century, and most recently to tour and record with the AquaSonic waterphone, a multifaceted, “mystic” instrument designed by artist Richard Waters. Garden Party is the latest result of his relentless touring and recording, a tossed-off album with a spirit of celebratory tradition that befits its name. Like most parties, this one is best when the attendees are spontaneous. Opener “C Melody” is a soup of muted improvisation, filled with toms and based around pianist Christopher Parker’s impromptu ostinato. Along with “Dopolaria,” “Father Dies; Son Dies,” and the title track, it forms a suite of songs sequenced to lead the listener from the loose interplay of instruments at its start toward the tautness of the human voice. Kelley Hurt’s lightly dissonant, Donald Byrd-esque vocals elevate the harmonies of “Dopolaria,” while alto saxophonist Chad Fowler’s “Father Dies; Son Dies” showcases the band at its most clamorous. All of this is a prelude, though, to “Garden Party,” in which Hurt’s spoken lyrics serve as the album’s guiding philosophy. “The bunnies would come out. And they’d chase the birds and the squirrels. And they’d all run around playing tag with each other,” she says, describing a wildness that Dopolarians allude to, but never quite reach. Sometimes the repetitive fragments that center Garden Party’s improvisations seem like a crutch, but if the band never achieves the same freedom that some of its most formidable members achieved in the past, perhaps that’s beside the point. Five of the six tracks are credited to Fowler, Hurt, and Christopher Parker, younger musicians who locate their ability as soloists not within free jazz, but within a decidedly NOLA-bred sense of structure. “Dopolarians” is derived from the Italian dopo l’aria (after the aria), a reference to the moment in an opera when the singer bows, the applause ends, and the plot goes on. Recorded before an enduringly influential percussionist took his final bow, Garden Party plays like an album of afters. Half of the players in Dopolarians already changed jazz. Now the younger generation throws them a party—one more placid, beautiful gathering down home.

Existential,AceMo,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e3c8ef3d2500009bb06d9/1:1/w_160/existential.jpg,2020-01-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/acemo-existential/,self-released,"Over the last year, the New York producer AceMo has been prolific. Between his solo efforts and his gleaming jungle revisions with frequent collaborator MoMa Ready, he’s released four EPs in the last 12 months, each stuffed with his uniquely scuffed techno tracks, while maintaining an exceptionally busy calendar of live gigs. AceMo is committed to the grind, but he’s never given the impression of putting out music just for the sake of it. Each of his releases feels purposeful and considered, and though he rarely gives interviews, he’s clearly in tune with the long history of dance music as a vehicle for messages that resonate beyond the club. His 2016 album Black Populous came with a poem that meditated on the energy, history, and resiliency of the people that gave the record its name, and his 2018 track “Where They At???”—a favorite of like-minded DJs—shouted out all the people who give the dancefloor life and vibrancy (“Where the black girls at?/Nomadic girls at?”). Existential, which AceMo self-released in December, extends that tradition. “As agents of Earth, we must emphasize the existence of each other,” he wrote on Instagram, underscoring the philosophical and spiritual dimension of his music. “WE ARE ALL RAVE ANGELS.” There is a possibility, AceMo’s music suggests, that you can find something in dance music deeper than bass. Accordingly, Existential’s eight tracks tend to operate at epic scale. They are towering pieces, with an average running time of nearly eight minutes, built around synthesizers that swirl in ways that feel both gaseous and enormous: Opener “Existential” sounds like a club floating in a distant nebula, daring you to stare upward in awe more than it begs you to dance. As awe-inspiring as they can be, these tracks feel also more insular and meditative than much of what AceMo has released to date. The stark ambience that opens “Man From Water pt. 2” bubbles upward into a distinctly introverted take on dance music, wrapping overdriven drums in spare synth melodies. AceMo certainly isn’t the first to sand down the genre’s sharp edges to make something more approachable for home listening. You can hear spiritual similarities to contemporaries like Galcher Lustwerk and the Mood Hut label and historical antecedents like Drexciya; it’s not even that far from the dubby dance refractions that Slowdive tried out on some of their spacier work. But AceMo sounds more at home than ever before in the low-lit glimmer of tracks like “Message to the Future (Waterfalls),” whose mantra-like qualities fit the austere simplicity of his production style. He’s rarely ever been the type of producer to layer more than a couple of different synth parts at once, but in these slow-moving pieces that restraint really shines. “Love Dimensions” shows it off best, as the chattering percussion and slowly unfolding basslines wrap around one another in shifting, amorphous ways. The intersections of these simple elements create surprising geometries and unexpected colors—leaving ample room to get lost in the spaces between the beats and find whatever truth lives there.","The New York producer tailors his overdriven techno epics to unusually introspective ends, sculpting stripped-down arrays of synth and drums into spare, expressive forms.

Música Esporádica,Música Esporádica,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f7680548e8a000826b46d/1:1/w_160/musicaesporadica.jpg,2020-01-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/musica-esporadica-musica-esporadica/,Music From Memory,"Unless you were a Steve Roach completist—an intimidating prospect, given his discography—you probably wouldn’t be familiar with the prolific new age composer’s ’90s collaborations with Spanish musician Suso Sáiz. Up until 2016, Sáiz’s music rarely landed outside his home country. But starting with the Amsterdam-based label Music from Memory’s handy introduction from that year, Odisea, Sáiz’s thoughtful work began to find new listeners. More music has followed, including a commissioned sound piece, a new album from earlier this year, and a retrospective of his new age band, Orquesta De Las Nubes. Each release showcases Sáiz’s contemplative nature as well as his openness as a collaborator, working with players ranging from Christian Fennesz to his own son. Now comes the sterling sole release from the group Música Esporádica, Sáiz’s one-off with Nubes members María Villa and Pedro Estevan, Spanish guitarist Miguel Herrero, and American players Glen Velez and Layne Redmond. Esporádica is a bit of a “lost” album, but now it can take its place alongside rediscovered classics like Midori Takada’s Through the Looking Glass, Gigi Masin’s Wind, and Hiroshi Yoshimura’s Music for Nine Post Cards. For what by all accounts was a spontaneous gathering in a nearby studio in 1985, the music feels telepathic, the six players moving as one to create something that feels kinetic and blissful at once. As the relatively concise six minutes of “I Forgot the Shirts” makes clear, the group often conjures the dreamy polyrhythms of Steve Reich. This is no coincidence; Velez was an integral member of the ’70s and ’80s ensembles propelling Reich’s formidable early run, including Music for 18 Musicians, Tehillim, and Sextet/Six Marimbas. Velez met Sáiz on tour with Reich, and they bonded over their shared fondness for non-Western music. Velez’s specialities include the Egyptian riq, the Irish bodhran, and the North African tar, and his website dubs him “Father of the Modern Frame Drum Movement.” Which is great if you are in search of an ayahuasca shaman or Burning Man buddy. But all received skepticism evaporates the moment Velez’s hands hit the animal skin at the start of the 12-minute title track. You can emerge hypnotized even after a dozen listens and still not retain much sense of what transpired. The atmosphere feels charged, as glints of guitar, additional percussion, and wordless harmonizing arise, the players roving in and out of focus. Velez’s pulse remains steady and imparts perpetual motion to everything, a train engine that blurs the landscape just enough to smudge the lines of reality. “Meciendo El Engaño” is a similar length as “Música Esporádica,” but it moves more slowly. Sáiz takes the lead at the start, allowing his winding melody to swell upwards and fill the space. When Velez’s shakers emerge nearly three minutes in, the waters deepen imperceptibly. Instruments twinkle, voices turn into sirens, and everything turns hallucinatory. If you skim through the album, many of the sounds here verge on “spa soundtrack,” but the group never falls back onto easy textures. Sáiz’s keyboard washes gather around those drums like storm clouds, at once massive, weightless, and dark. Velez’s frame drums are tribal, but each hit is made with intention, never just as an empty “world music” texture. Allow Música Esporádica to properly unfurl and it reveals itself to be immersive and celebratory, capturing an ecstatic meeting point between friends old and new.

Enema of the State,Blink-182,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2d8bd4aba6d0009f18d9b/1:1/w_160/enemaof.jpg,2020-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blink-182-enema-of-the-state/,MCA,"On the weekend of the infamously disastrous Woodstock ’99, which symbolized rock radio’s id-fueled descent into aggro dipshittery, a snottier kind of teenage angst was manifesting 200 miles to the west in Buffalo, New York. Then in its fifth year, the Vans Warped Tour had crisscrossed the country bringing affordable revelry to the green-haired masses. If Woodstock was for the shirtless jocks, Warped Tour was for the skaters, losers, and wannabes who still sometimes needed a ride from mom. No one was there for the revolution; they were just teenagers drunk on community and tongue-kissing, blissfully alive during the final summer of what had been a relatively idyllic American decade. And that summer, no act on the bill was bigger than blink-182. While the concept of pop-punk dates back to ’70s bands like the Buzzcocks and the Undertones, pop-punk didn’t become actual popular music until 1994, when Green Day’s Dookie sold more than 12 million copies and set off a never-ending debate about selling out that persists in DIY spaces today. Sure, Green Day sang more about masturbation than anarchy, but that simply did not matter to all the young kids who, apart from lapping up the music, constituted a new customer base for the record industry to serve. These market conditions had lifted blink-182 to festival superstardom just five years into their recording career. In 1992, Mark Hoppus met Tom Delonge through Hoppus’ sister Anne, and they immediately connected through their obsession with punk rock and middle-school humor—two foundational elements for a new pop-punk band. But while they loved conceptual predecessors like the similarly Californian and cheeky Descendents, they were serious about owning a suburban home. “I’d like to make a lot of money and fuck credibility,” Hoppus said in 1998 to i-Zine. “People make so much out of something that’s just the band trying to get ahead and get its music to as many fans as possible.” They weren’t selling out; they were buying in. Part of that was Hoppus and Delonge’s exurban SoCal upbringing, which encouraged a sunny prankishness at odds with the urban despair of the big cities. “The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,” Delonge told music journalist John Robb in 2000. (He might have added “white,” too.) Two decades earlier, the teenaged Ramones were social outcasts in New York, but Delonge was named homecoming king his senior year of high school (he was also expelled for showing up drunk to a basketball game). What they began doing quite well and to excess was simple: record the pouty concerns of middle-class kids in a plainspoken language they could understand, set to addictive melodies and played at moshing speed. That largely meant singing about women. “I guess this is growing up,” Hoppus had declared on 1997’s “Dammit,” a cynical dispatch about a collapsed relationship; two years later they were hardly more considerate about the opposite sex. As Warped Tour kicked off in 1999, they released Enema of the State, their third studio album, first with a real budget, and first solely for a major label (1997’s Dude Ranch was released in tandem between MCA and early patrons Cargo). Nine of its 12 tracks were directly about women, with a tenth—the anti-suicide “Adam’s Song”—inspired by the loneliness Hoppus felt on tour as the crowds got bigger and the schedule more demanding. “What’s My Age Again?,” their first single to hit the Billboard Hot 100, summed up blink’s entire emotional purview: sexual failure, exes, and developmentally arrested existential despair. (The initial title, rejected by the label, was “Peter Pan Complex.”) The song was boosted immensely by the accompanying video, in which the band sprinted nude through Los Angeles, a stunt that landed them on MTV’s Total Request Live, then the gold standard for artists hoping to break into mainstream America. The nudity didn’t have much to do with the song, but juxtaposing earnest sentiment with love of their own dicks would become the band’s default approach for the next few years. Nice guy misogyny, practiced by men who claim to love and respect women, but also think they know what’s best for them, was rampant in ’90s culture and music, and blink-182 were not an exception. Gasoline-powered opener “Dumpweed” is catchy as hell; it also has a chorus where Delonge yells, “I need a girl that I can train,” an attitude made abundantly clear throughout the album. (Reviewing it in The New York Times, Ann Powers called “Dumpweed” a “nasty idea, but the rest of the song makes it obvious he is the one at heel.”) The moral record doesn’t need to be retroactively corrected, as plenty of critics and adults despised their act: A 2000 SPIN piece threw them into the rising tide of sexist rock bands, alongside frat-rap acts like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock; a profile from the year before highlighted the animosity from ethically-minded punks concerned about the implications of blink-182’s waggish bullshit. The music publicist Tristin Laughter, who was then employed by prominent punk label Lookout! (home to a pre-stardom Green Day), wrote in the influential fanzine Punk Planet, “Boys who go to see the punk bands on the Warped Tour may be inspired to start their own rock bands. Girls may be inspired to think they could actually be pretty enough to be cheered on when they remove their shirts.” The band treated the accusations with little credence: “I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines!” Delonge told SPIN. “I hate with a passion Maximumrockandroll and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it’s so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views.” This brand of assholishness didn’t negate the fact of their wrongness, which the band could occasionally recognize with the slightest concessions; after all, as their audience began skewing younger, they did stop asking the women in attendance to remove their shirts. They may have been stuck at the emotional age of 23, but the 1998 addition of Travis Barker had given their collective musical ability a quantum leap forward. Citing burnout, original drummer Scott Raynor had left the band mid-tour, and Barker was recruited on short notice from costumed punks the Aquabats, one of their tourmates. He learned the entire setlist in about 45 minutes, which Delonge later remarked was both a testament to his skill and the band’s lack of refinement. Not long after, Raynor was formally kicked out, and Barker was hired on full-time. Barker’s two drumming heroes were jazz legend Buddy Rich and Animal from the Muppets. In contrast to Hoppus and Delonge, he’d grown up working class, and carried himself with a seriousness they did not share. (For years, he’d be regarded by fans as “the quiet one.”) Full-body tattoos and a stylish mohawk belied a monkish devotion to his craft—he practiced obsessively, and played so forcefully he once fractured his arm during a video shoot. Though he didn’t receive songwriting credits (and wouldn’t be inducted as an official member of the band until the recording of 2001’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket), Barker arranged all of the songs on Enema, selecting the tempos and organizing the flow of verses, choruses, and breaks. Given new power thanks to producer Jerry Finn’s arsenal of pedals and amps, Delonge’s guitar-playing bounced against Barker’s hard-nosed drumming, with Hoppus’ bass lines as the connective tissue. Barker’s versatility meant they could settle into a twinkling ballad, or approach the tempo of hardcore. Often he did everything in the same song, like on “Dysentery Gary,” where a start-stop lockstep with the riff flows into a samba groove before achieving rocket-fueled liftoff on the chorus. Aquabats singer Christian Jacobs assessed the value of Barker’s contributions more bluntly: “Without Travis, Mark and Tom would have been, at best, a lukewarm poser pop-punk band. A couple of hot dogs wiggling around in a bucket.” The full-throttle catchiness of a song titled “Dysentery Gary” (which is about a slimy guy who steals Delonge’s girlfriend) sums up why fans loved blink-182, and why critics often rolled their eyes. Their punk forebears offered clever critiques of capitalism; they came up with, “Work sucks/I know.” They were lifestyle music for kids radicalized by the Tony Hawk Pro Skater soundtrack, empowered by their self-assigned right to rebel. Even so, they could be surprisingly sensitive, like on “All the Small Things,” which Delonge wrote about his then-girlfriend and future wife Jennifer. The lyrics aren’t profound, and the Fisher-Price rhyme scheme led to syntax that sounds spat up by a Babelfish translation (“Always I know/You’ll be at my show”). But it was engineered to provoke a physical reaction: leaping out of the speakers like a Van Halen song before slowing down to build momentum for another eruptive chorus buttressed by Delonge’s adenoidal harmonizing, his na-na coming out as a nasally faux-British naw-naw. The fizzy pleasure of the melody captures the Hallmark simplicity of young love, and though the instantly iconic video mocked the boy bands of their era, any amateur critic could point out they were just doing “As Long As You Love Me” for the lip-ring set. Considering how easily the band defaulted to juvenilia—even the sweet “All the Small Things” got a goofy video—it’s relatively stunning how straight they played it on “Adam’s Song,” which became the most impactful anti-suicide song of the ’90s due to its vivid first-person perspective and empathetic narrator, a depressed teenager whose feelings of anguish and alienation were proximate to a lot of blink-182’s young fans. “Adam’s Song” read like something a teenager might have written, which is why millions of them loved it. The experience of navigating suicidal feelings rarely sounded so anthemic, and Hoppus’ somber delivery, heartbreaking details (“Please tell mom this is not her fault”), and eventual hopeful turn even closed out with a tender piano outro. It was capital-M Mature; it was also named after a Mr. Show sketch about a band who visits a fan after his suicide attempt, further heightening their push and pull between emotional development and the easy joke. Then again, what do you expect a band that would call their next album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket? They were just close enough to their youth to instantly relive it, which may have given their therapists heartburn, but made for amazingly effective pop music: Hoppus was 27 years old when he wrote, “Nobody likes you when you’re 23,” and DeLonge actually was 23 years old when he insisted on being unlikeable. But blink-182 eventually did grow up, sort of. The darker textures and increasingly sophisticated songwriting made 2003’s self-titled album, recorded just before their eight-year hiatus, a predecessor to the moody emo-pop bands that would soon dominate the charts (it even included a duet with the Cure’s Robert Smith, one of Hoppus’ heroes). They still write silly songs like 2016’s “Built This Pool” (complete lyrics: “I wanna see some naked dudes/That’s why I built this pool”), but their reunion records are studded with moments of emotional reflection and compositional elegance that, 20 years ago, would’ve been impossible to anticipate. Particularly good is 2011’s “Up All Night,” in which they grapple with the night terrors that set in after the money has been made, the suburban home has been purchased, the family life and personal development have been secured, but life nonetheless remains unresolvable. In a meta bit of casting, Delonge was replaced by Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio, who’d often stood in contrast to blink as a “serious” pop-punk band. Hoppus morphed into a sage, wry presence on Twitter, and a vocal advocate of the younger groups blink-182 inspired; Barker became canonized as drummer to the stars, and garnered an unyielding wave of goodwill after barely surviving a plane crash in 2008. Whispers abound that Delonge will eventually rejoin the band when he’s finished proving that aliens are real, and by the way, you are not alone in being overwhelmed by the fact that the guy from blink-182 might prove that aliens are real. Through all these encroachments into adulthood, Enema remains the album that defined them. Nothing they released after had the same immediacy or cultural connection, and they’re now performing the record in full, the surest sign that a band has finally embraced its status as a legacy act. In blink’s case, their once-teenaged fans are now full-fledged adults with nostalgia for their less responsible years, and the money to emotionally regress for a night. They were slated to headline Fyre Festival, a disaster of Woodstock ’99 proportions mostly attended by monied urbanites whose artistic interests top out at “stuff I recognize.” Even so, the appeals of puerile insouciance are evergreen, and their celebrity status allowed them to stretch across generations in a way that most pop-punk bands have not, with the exception of Green Day. When I finally saw them perform for the first time, at 2013’s Riot Fest, their audience was filled with hundreds of teens, some of whom weren’t even born when Enema came out. At that age, reacting stupidly in front of your crush is a forgone conclusion, because nothing ever feels as hurtful or as confusing as one’s first experiences with torments of romance. Immaturity is a type of rebellion—a stupid one, but transparently so, and though the band is now in its 40s, they can still faithfully evoke a specific pose of solipsistic juvenile rebellion that hasn’t been anywhere near as culturally omniscient or validated since 1999, at least not by a guitar band. No wonder they were still an inspiration for the kids not yet ready to grow up, even if they should’ve been acting their age.

Watchmen (Music from the HBO Series),Trent ReznorAtticus Ross,by: Sean T. Collins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1372b27bc3a600084023f7/1:1/w_160/watchmen.jpg,2020-01-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-watchmen-music-from-the-hbo-series/,The Null Corporation,"How committed are Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to their nominal side gig of composing for film and television? Here’s how: In the middle of releasing their sprawling three-volume score for Watchmen, the HBO adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ landmark superhero comic, they dropped a 77-minute soundtrack for Trey Edward Shults’ indie drama Waves, too. Clearly, the bug that bit the duo circa The Social Network in 2010 hasn’t let go. Based on the quality of their music for Watchmen, that’s great news. Their score for showrunner Damon Lindelof’s sociopolitically fraught story of vigilantism is their strongest and most direct since The Social Network—or even Reznor’s soundtrack for the 1996 video game Quake. The horror-movie atmospherics of Quake are the closest reference point for Watchmen’s first and strongest track, “How the West Was Really Won.” The show’s unofficial theme music—it recurs repeatedly in the series’ most frightful moments, including the ripped-from-the-comic image of a gigantic alien squid in the ruins of Manhattan—it’s the sound of Reznor and Ross going full John Carpenter, with a simple synth hook that seems to swallow up more of the world around you with each repetition. Its melodic structure recurs throughout the score, in the gently acoustic “Watch Over This Boy” at the end of Volume 1, the jazz throwback “Nostalgia Blues” on Volume 2 (co-written and performed by John Beasley), and the major-key weightlessness of “The Waiting Sky” on Volume 3. The original song is resilient enough to mutate in this way, showing off the duo’s skill with leitmotif as well as their considerable range. It’s the theme music Nine Inch Nails fans have been waiting for them to deliver. It also starts off the soundtracks with a bang rather than a simmer, a mood maintained through much of Volume 1. “Nun With a Motherf*&*ing Gun” pulses and clangs like a reimagined version of Nitzer Ebb’s “Join in the Chant,” while “Objects in Mirror (Are Closer Than They Appear)” and “Kattle Battle” share a sleazy, slithering bass groove. While the bangers largely vanish by the time the quieter, more ruminative Volume 2 comes around, they return in a big way with Volume 3’s leadoff track, “Doomsday Prepper,” which comes fully loaded with scuzzy Nine Inch Nails guitar. Reznor and Ross even work covers into the show’s repertoire. The trilogy ends with a quiet, reverent piano cover of “Life on Mars?”, the world-beating ballad by Reznor’s late friend and mentor David Bowie. But the pair are equally reverent toward Wham!’s “Careless Whisper,” which they reconfigure into Volume 3’s “No Rhythm.” To my ears, there’s even a tip of the hat to Bernard Herrmann’s jazzy Taxi Driver theme at the start of the big-band pastiche “The Way It Used to Be.” That’s not to say they’re incapable of love themes all their own: “Which Came First” is a wistful piano ballad that mutates into sci-fi synth; its melody returns with a full choir in “Lincoln Tunnel” several tracks later. In keeping with the disorienting tone of Lindelof’s show, the albums are peppered with dialogue snippets lifted from the series, from teasers for fictional TV shows (“American Promo Story,” “A Man Walks Into an Intrinsic Field”) to pharmaceutical infomercials (“The Elephant in the Room”). Taking this several steps further, as is the Reznor way, the vinyl version of each release comes disguised as an album from within Watchmen’s world: Volume 1 is the latest release by the fake rock group Sons of Pale Horse, Volume 2 is the score for the Ryan Murphy–esque TV show American Hero Story, and Volume 3 is an old album by “The” Nine Inch Nails, the genuine article’s fictional equivalent. But as has been the case with other Reznor/Ross scores, you needn’t be sold on the show, or even familiar with it, to enjoy the score. Taken together, Watchmen Vols. 1-3 play like a dispatch from some other weird world, one that feels like Reznor and Ross’s alternately paranoid and plaintive music.

Winter/Time,Amy Klein,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e14f216de27430008d96e6b/1:1/w_160/winter:time.jpg,2020-01-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amy-klein-wintertime/,Don Giovanni,"A “paracosm”—the literary term Amy Klein has said inspired her second solo album, Winter/Time—is an elaborate world of people and places formed in a child’s imagination. Klein, a punk veteran who’s toured with Titus Andronicus and performed as half of the band Hilly Eye, invites the listener into her own such fantasies on this record, offering dream logic and the occasional bewilderment. It can also feel like an escape from what she’s done so well before, its few instances of punk brashness ceding to soft, falsetto balladry. Winter/Time’s cover art—an ethereal woman striding through a blurry, painted forest—suggests the LP’s tone and its motif of a hero’s journey. The album strikes a delicate balance throughout: Its interwoven guitars, synths, and cymbal crashes are gale-force, but its opaque lyrics and muted vocals are indirect and timid. “Come to You” begins soft and hesitant before revealing a percolating synth line, and Klein’s lyrics remain hardly discernible throughout, deployed in a near-whispered quaver that fails to suggest any emotional stakes. She sings of being chased by her past, but there’s no menace in that pursuit. On “Winter,” the opening rumble of electric chords and Cocteau Twins-style trills signal intensity, but even the crackling guitars—deep and dark like a storm front—don’t push Klein’s delivery above a shrug. “Can I see the light?” she wonders, not convincing us that she’s been on a shrouded path of any real consequence. The album doesn’t stray from this vagueness with the exception of opener “Nothing,” the only track that finds Klein believably ferocious. Driving electric guitar jolts behind her as she wails, breathy and doused in reverb, about a snow-blindness so bright she nearly disappears within it. This urgency sets the song apart from the rest of the album; it sounds more like a psychedelic Dungeons and Dragons battle than the tentative questing heroine of later tracks. This directness—from the chorus’ imperative to the impatient guitars, their feedback underscoring urgency—serves Klein’s fevered electric riffs well. Closer “One More Time” mirrors the savagery of “Nothing,” and is another glimpse at what Winter/Time might have been if its midsection had similar adrenaline. It offers a confident, backward glance at a former self whose “hands used to shake,” and it hums along like a ’80s radio punk anthem, synthesizers underscoring elemental mentions of fire and sparks. “I could burn right through you,” she vows, with compelling force. This is when Klein wields her axe like she’s ready for battle, a welcome departure from several songs less sure in their step. But what exactly is she fighting? Who is the “you” through whom she would blaze, triumphant? It’s frustratingly unclear. A fantasy world needs scaffolding, constraints that center us in time and place, to make it relatable. Without a glimpse of the horizon, we’re left snow-blind, too.","The interwoven guitars, synths, and cymbal crashes of Amy Klein’s second solo album are gale-force, but its opaque lyrics and muted vocals are indirect and timid.

Somebody Else’s Song,Water From Your Eyes,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e354e3c598c000864e048/1:1/w_160/waterfromyoureyes_somebodyelsessong.jpg,2020-01-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/water-from-your-eyes-somebody-elses-song/,Exploding in Sound,"Under the tear-stained moniker Water From Your Eyes, Rachel Brown and Nate Amos make music that, like their name, pushes simple concepts towards inventive and imaginative ends. Like their peers in bands like the Cradle and Lily and Horn Horse, the Brooklyn duo makes eclectic, hard-to-define experimental pop, half digital and half not, that always takes familiar ideas to refreshingly new spaces. After several pleasant releases, their latest record, Somebody Else’s Song, combines the freedom of exploration with poignant introspection. For all of Water From Your Eyes’ confidence in splicing different genres and feels from acoustic twee to indie-electronica, the emotional undercurrent of Somebody Else’s Song is more uncertain. The songs focus on the push and pull between the comfort of dreams and a hazy reality. This idea arrives promptly on the titular opener, when Brown admits, “I try to sing, I get the words all wrong/’Cause it’s somebody else’s song.” (Both musicians assuredly sing their own words on their respectively lovely solo projects, Brown’s thanks for coming and Amos’ This Is Lorelai.) But the record is never bogged down by unease thanks to the pair’s impressionistic storytelling, dreamy melodies, and Brown’s bittersweet warble. On “Somebody Else’s Song,” their voice floats in a ray of sunlight over a simple guitar loop and a steadily tapping foot, evoking the wistful sing-speaking of K Records folk-poppers. But this tranquil soul-searching is shattered by “Break,” a 10-minute barrage of dizzying drum machine rhythms and creeping keys. Brown’s unvarnished vocals immediately grow cold, hardening into the stiff monotone of an automaton. Without anything resembling a concrete chorus, the track spirals confidently towards euphoric oblivion. “Break” seemingly shares little with its delicate predecessor. But the connective tissue is a yearning for connection, a theme that endures throughout the record. Though the gear shifts are never as jarring as the transition into “Break,” across eight tracks, Somebody Else’s Song bends into new shapes as it dives into various sonic rabbit holes. The barebones title track is revisited in the back half of the album and blossoms into “Bad in the Sun,” a vocoder-soaked dose of electro bliss. Seemingly melancholic lyrics now feel full of potential, like a nightmare you can laugh off in the morning. A brief blip of harmonized vocals titled “Look” is transformed by a little bumpy guitar melody into the eerie closer “Look Again.” The song concludes with a painfully corporeal depiction of longing: a face gazing through a window at a chain-link fence in the distance, feeling the sensation of wires pressing into their skin. The best manifestation of this internal conflict is “Adeline,” an off-kilter admission of all-consuming and possibly misplaced devotion. “Nobody else could make me leave me behind,” Brown sings, a heartbreaking, self-aware confession. While wading through Water From Your Eyes’ whims is a delight in itself, discovering the unexpected loveliness buried within is especially worthwhile.

Seeking Thrills,Georgia,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d830982c18ce4000869f836/1:1/w_160/Georgia_Digital-main-album-cover_4096x4096px_300dpi.jpg,2020-01-10 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/georgia-seeking-thrills/,Domino,"From behind a set of cherry-red drum pads, Georgia opened a small show in Brooklyn this past October with the announcement that, just that day, she’d met a personal hero: Sheila E., the iconic drummer, singer, and Prince collaborator. There are famous women drummers, but few who are songwriters, producers, headlining performers, and pop stars, too. Perhaps that’s why Seeking Thrills, the new album from 29-year-old British musician Georgia Barnes, sounds so fresh and exploratory: She’s not working from any real blueprint. Though it’s her second record, Seeking Thrills has the ascendent energy of an audition tape; brighter and less tentative than her self-titled 2015 debut, even its awkward moments convey earnest, self-taught sincerity. As the daughter of Neil Barnes from the ’90s UK electronic duo Leftfield, Georgia grew up surrounded by her father’s collection of electronic and international records and developed an early love of pop and hip-hop, particularly Missy Elliott. She later became a London session drummer, performing alongside acts like Kate Tempest and Kwes. Seeking Thrills builds from all these interests simultaneously, foregrounding Georgia’s voice and fusing the rattling beats of her debut with the familiar neon warmth of Chicago and Detroit house. On opening track “Started Out,” a slinky house-pop firestarter with the enigmatic hook, “We are wicked young fools who behave now,” the combination is magnetic. To write the new album, Georgia holed up in her home studio, studying a personal pantheon of great songwriters: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Kate Bush. She’s estimated that it took a year and a half worth of study to unlock her own abilities. A finished version of Seeking Thrills was ready in spring 2019, but early last year, after “Started Out” landed in rotation at BBC Radio 1, she happily delayed it. Fully half of the album’s songs were released as singles, from “Feel It” in 2017 to the most recent, “24 Hours,” just this week. The promotional advantages are self-evident, though the outcome is frustrating: The album front-loads its two best songs, “Started Out” and the twisty “About Work the Dancefloor,” and nothing thereafter packs quite the same punch. In this way, some of the same things that allow Seeking Thrills to feel like an edition-of-one discovery can also come across choppy or scattered. “Ray Guns” still sounds like castoff M.I.A., a frequent point of comparison for Georgia’s debut. It’s not that her time in the studio didn’t pay off—the new album has better hooks, bigger personality, and a radiant optimism that her older material can’t match. But learning to write isn’t the kind of job you finish. Some of these lyrics are paper-thin, and Georgia doesn’t always have the range to give them more dimension. “Mellow” makes the disparity clear: South London singer Shygirl’s verse is sultry and stylish, but Georgia dominates the song with reference-track stiltedness. Lines that ought to sound effortless—“Keepin’ real/Never spill/And I’m gonna get it/From the spigot”—instead land with a thud. Yet Georgia is coming into her own as a singer: She handles the deep-water affirmation grooves “Till I Own It” and “Ultimate Sailor,” two of the most rewarding album cuts, with a husky pop style indebted to Robyn. “Started Out” is still the strongest song here, but this wasn’t supposed to be an album of floor-fillers. It’s better suited to a house party, or as the soundtrack to a private “Dancing on My Own” moment (the very Girls scene Georgia watched just before writing “About Work the Dancefloor”). Even when it’s clumsy, Seeking Thrills never feels manufactured. It’s a passion project, a result of trial and error, the singular product of someone learning to write for her own voice.

Multiquest Niveau 1: Camouflé,RAMZi,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e6f77f3d2500009bb06db/1:1/w_160/ramzi_multiquest.jpg,2020-01-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ramzi-multiquest-niveau-1-camoufle/,FATi,"Unsettling and alluring in equal measure, RAMZi’s Phobiza series was a kind of imaginary travelogue, its title an apparent portmanteau of “phobia” and “Ibiza.” Across the course of three releases, the Canadian electronic musician mapped out an archipelago of fantasy islands and forgotten languages—a mingling of the tawdry and the exotic where bird calls, chintzy synths, and garbled voices tangled like overgrown vines. The sleeves, emblazoned with bizarre flora and fauna, were styled to resemble artifacts of 20th century ethnomusicology, and the music offered a correspondingly global web of references: oddly tuned flutes, indistinct radio chatter, and the splintered rhythms of dembow, kwaito, and footwork. If you’ve ever lain awake in a strange country, jetlagged and listening through thin walls to the sounds of a nearby market square, then you already know the sensation. RAMZi, aka Phoebé Guillemot, is working with similar materials on Multiquest Niveau 1: Camouflé, but the new material sounds like she’s turned a corner. Guillemot has always been considerably more invested in rhythm and groove than peers like Jan Jelinek, Andrew Pekler, and Visible Cloaks, who have taken a shared interest in globe-trotting to more atmospheric ends, and Multiquest Niveau 1 is her most rhythm-centric release. Where previous records seemed to be on the verge of dissolving into the muggy night air, the new album puts its drums front and center, leaning into muscular syncopations, slow-motion breakbeats, and, on more than one occasion, deep house. “Muskin” opens the album as though pushing through a beaded curtain into a dimly lit watering hole; saxophone riffs curl like smoke against a meditative backdrop of bells and Rhodes keys. But at barely a minute and a half long, it’s also something of a fake-out, and with the following track, “Kombat,” RAMZi plunges into the kind of propulsive cut that constitutes the bulk of the album: a bass-heavy dub groove covered in acidic synths, vaguely non-Western scales, and the occasional outburst of police sirens. The song strikes Guillemot’s customary balance between familiarity and strangeness, and the rest of the album follows suit. On the surface, the deep-house drums and buoyant synth pads of tracks like “Balmi” and “La nuit l'été 1996” sound conventional, with echoes of Mr. Fingers. But her habit of collaging mismatched chords and samples creates weird, murky pockets of dissonance, and even the most straightforward tracks are suffused in chipmunk chirps and molasses-thick baritone vocals, pitched on each end well beyond the limits of intelligibility. But the most unexpected influence is a far more pedestrian one: trip-hop. The album is shot through with distant echoes of acts like Kruder & Dorfmeister, Thievery Corporation, and other period purveyors of satiny aspirationalism and frequent-flyer beats, from the sitar and vibraphones of “Rubicon” to laid-back cadences that are just a stone’s throw from a Café del Mar compilation. Trip-hop, synonymous with early-’90s electronic music, is a funny case: It’s never really had a proper reappraisal. From personal conversations I’ve had over the past five years, I know that there’s no shortage of left-field electronic musicians interested in dusting off classic trip-hop and trying to make something new with it—something that resonates with the uncanny feel that distinguished, say, Portishead’s Dummy upon its arrival, more than a quarter century ago. Multiquest Niveau 1: Camouflé might be the album that finally recognizes the latent experimental potential in that most misunderstood of genres—and makes the easy-listening doldrums of “chill” safe once again for aberrant behavior.

High Line,SUSS,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1359b598351600083fabcc/1:1/w_160/suss_highline.jpg,2020-01-10 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/suss-high-line/,Northern Spy,"On their 2018 debut album, Ghost Box, the New York ensemble SUSS evoked the American Southwest in mystical, ambient-country instrumentals. After their song “Late Night Call” attracted millions of Spotify plays, the band updated Ghost Box that fall, fleshing out their original work with vivid new tracks. On their second album, High Line, their arid sonic landscapes take on a different tone, sounding less like a vacation than a dinner bell for the apocalypse. High Line begins gently in “Salt Flats,” its dusty swirls of synths building around slow-burning guitar. Soon, though, SUSS establish an ominous, lingering tone with “Wetlands.” Pedal steel approaches in piercing high range before low strings ripple up below, and dark electric guitar gradually surfaces amid the waves. The bent guitar notes burbling within the pedal steel’s elastic framework are gently combative, like a jellyfish bumping against the walls of an aquarium tank. High Line offers less immersion than Ghost Box; its compositions feel like anxious, half-remembered dreams, evaporating just before they unfold fully. Spaced throughout the record, High Line’s trio of dune-titled pieces—“Blue Dune I,” “Blue Dune II,” and “Dunes III”—spread lingering tension. A swampy acoustic guitar arrives and disappears like an itinerant stranger near the end of “Blue Dune I,” pushing away background prickles of gently scraped strings. The acoustic guitar is more restless on “Blue Dune II,” hopping around with restrained half-strums; on “Dunes III,” distorted electric guitars wriggle alongside synths and pedal steel, with even darker synth flares adding a sinister foil. Like wind-shaped dunes themselves, the song trio shifts gradually, as if controlled by titanic forces that can be felt but never seen. Tension seeps into “Too Young to Die,” which opens with a clear, lightly twangy guitar melody that’s subsumed by a thrumming bassline and sporadic background hisses. Turning skyward, “Ursa Major” is more mercurial, beginning brightly on wavering channels of pedal steel, fiddle drone, and synth fizz. It changes midway, turning to stormy post-rock with the arrival of lumbering drums and splashy cymbals before closing with a single, sparkling chime. Then SUSS finish on a serene note with “Sundowner,” the distinct metallic sparkle of a mandolin pairing with fluttering synths and blooming acoustic guitars. It’s a welcome uplift, though it doesn’t feel exactly hopeful, and so it suits the present moment. High Line is more clipped, on edge, and overcast than anything SUSS has done before—but then again, so is the world they live in.

"Nature, Man & Woman EP",Badge Époque Ensemble,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e725a20a40600082f7413/1:1/w_160/badgeepoque_naturemanwoman.jpg,2020-01-10 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/badge-epoque-ensemble-nature-man-and-woman-ep/,Telephone Explosion,"If the past decade has taught us anything, it’s that no dad-rock deity is too square to be reclaimed as cool. In recent years, the lodestars for contemporary indie rock have gradually shifted from the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, Gang of Four, and Sonic Youth to Michael McDonald, Bruce Hornsby, Phil Collins, and Dire Straits. But there remains one boomer icon who’s never been considered for hipster rehabilitation: Eric Clapton. Maybe it’s the fact that Clapton is forever tethered to a blues-guitar tradition that’s increasingly unfashionable in the 21st century, or maybe it’s the unshakeable bitter aftertaste of his alcohol-fuelled misadventures in racism, but to date we have seen no chillwave cover of “Tears in Heaven,” no onstage duet with Mac DeMarco on “Wonderful Tonight”; even the Black Keys haven’t touched the guy. But on the second release from Toronto’s Badge Époque Ensemble, not only does Clapton receive a rare acknowledgement from an experimental underground act normally besotted with left-field jazz, we learn that his legacy is stitched right into the band’s name. Badge Époque Ensemble is the latest project from Max Turnbull, an artist whose DIY, Madlib-inspired approach to sound design is completely at odds with Clapton’s technical precision, yet the two share unlikely career parallels. Turnbull first surfaced in the late 2000s as Slim Twig, a highly stylized, pompadoured persona that was equal parts rockabilly rebel, avant-punk provocateur, and hip-hop-schooled sound collagist. But since the release of 2015’s Thank You for Stickin’ With Twig, he’s dropped the alias and receded into more anonymous roles, whether backing wife Meg Remy in U.S. Girls, joining her in the mondo-rock supergroup Darlene Shrugg, or moonlighting with astral-jazz travellers the Cosmic Range. Badge Époque Ensemble represents his most extreme act of self-negation yet. Where Slim Twig channelled outsized personalities like Nick Cave and Jon Spencer, Turnbull is now forging kinship with the unsung composers and faceless session players of library music, the funky, fusion-flavored stock soundtracks that permeated documentaries, cop shows, and sports telecasts in the ’70s. It’s an evolution that oddly reflects Clapton’s own sidestep out of the spotlight in the late ’60s, when—having tired of Cream’s acid-rock excess—he sought refuge in the more tuneful Blind Faith and Delaney & Bonnie, before obscuring his identity altogether in Derek and the Dominoes. So it’s rather fitting that Nature, Man & Woman should climax with a cover of “Badge,” a song that Clapton co-wrote with George Harrison for Cream’s final album—and, some 40 years later, has provided Turnbull with the inspiration for his new group’s handle. In this case, “cover” is a gross understatement—Turnbull and co. stretch “Badge” from a three-minute pop song into a 14-minute improvisatory mission statement that wholly earns its self-edifying rebrand as “Badge Theme.” After faithfully mirroring the original’s structure for three verse reps (with Alia O’Brien’s flute tracing Clapton’s vocal melody), Badge Époque leave the song in the dust and embark on an extended funk odyssey atop a lithe congas’n’clavinet groove. But while the two versions of the song couldn’t be more different, they serve the same transformative function for their creators: For Clapton, “Badge” was a gateway between his guitar-god roots and the pop-oriented songcraft that would define his career from thereon out; for Turnbull, “Badge Theme” charts a record collector’s journey from the comforts of classic rock into the bottomless abyss of rare-groove crate-digging and private-press psychedelia. If “Badge Theme” represents the totality of the Badge Époque experience, the other two tracks on Nature, Man & Woman respectively provide more discrete showcases of the band’s wandering impulses and compositional ingenuity. The smoke-covered title track doesn’t waver from its foot-dragging, 16-rpm rhythm for its entire six-minute duration, but there’s no lack of action: O’Brien’s flute alternates between sustained squeals and cosmic clusters, guitarist Chris Bezant chips off shards of bluesy guitar skronk as if he were carving a shiv, and the appearance of a high-pitched synth frequency sends the whole thing swishing left to right like a stomach in the early throes of food poisoning. By sharp contrast, the hair-raising “Zealous Child” nods more vigorously in the direction of O’Brien’s main gig in Blood Ceremony, as guest singer Dorothea Paas lends her eerie, hypnotized-cult-member voice to a song that gallops along the tightrope between pastoral prog and proto-metal. It’s the closest this band has veered toward a formal rock song, and perhaps not surprisingly, “Zealous Child” recently received the greatest validation that a group of Canadian library-music heads could ask for: last month, it was used as bumper music on a broadcast of Hockey Night in Canada. But Badge Époque’s natural utility as a soundtrack to slap shots and body checks shouldn’t obscure their true appeal: this is background music that demands your full attention.","Max Turnbull’s newest group takes its name from a song co-written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison—then stretches it from a three-minute pop song into a 14-minute improvisatory mission statement.

The Deadbeat Bang of Heartbreak City,Beach Slang,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e136d952ff48f0008f56847/1:1/w_160/beachslang.jpg,2020-01-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beach-slang-the-deadbeat-bang-of-heartbreak-city/,Bridge Nine,"If you feel embarrassed to identify as a Beach Slang fan in 2020, rest assured that for frontman James Alex, embarrassment is the whole point. He has an umbilical connection to the awkward and tender teenage sentiments of bands like the Replacements or Jawbreaker and he carries the flag for adults who feel ashamed of their younger selves. Most Beach Slang fans would admit that their 2015 debut, The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us, was pandering to a certain kind of washed-up rock fan, but hey, at least someone was actually pandering to them. Coming after nearly four years of lost momentum and squandered goodwill, The Deadbeat Bang of Heartbreak City lacks the near-delusional devotion to the redemptive possibilities of rock music that sustained Beach Slang’s early work. There’s something far less communal at play here: a desperation to keep Beach Slang alive. When Alex shouts “Did you come to watch me choke...again” on “Let It Ride,” he raises the unexpected possibility of finding pathos in all of this—in the shame and moral trade-offs that come with a white-knuckle grip on fleeting relevance, in his own band’s troubled history—the near-breakups, the personnel controversies, the erratic shows, the disdain from peers. Though “Let It Ride” is virtually indistinguishable from 90 percent of other Beach Slang songs—maybe intentionally so—a lyric like “Rock ‘n’ roll’s my favorite sin/Man, I don’t know if I’m good at it/But I’m too in love or dumb to quit” hits differently than any number of Beach Slang lyrics that uses virtually the same exact words. Maybe the backhanded compliments suggesting Alex is willfully dumb or naive were off-base; maybe he knows exactly what he’s doing. The announcement of lead single “Bam Rang Rang”—basically a repeat of “Atom Bomb,” except twice as long for some reason—accompanied a run of dates opening for the Goo Goo Dolls, a band whose pre-“Name” Westerberg cosplay is a more apt reference point for Beach Slang than the Mats themselves. After years of writing de facto Replacements fanfic, Alex actually rips off the one Replacement song about fanfic itself with “Tommy in the ’80s.” “I figured if Westerberg could write about Alex Chilton, for all those right reasons, I could write something about Tommy Keene for all the same ones,” Alex explained, preemptively correcting a valid assumption that “Tommy in the ‘80s” is about Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson—now an actual member of Beach Slang—and saving the thing from total contextual collapse. He is also the only artist in 2020 still namedropping Fast Times at Ridgemont High and “Jessie’s Girl” as fresh sources of inspiration. Imagine what life could be like if you could silence your inner (or outer) critic the way Alex does. It’s kind of inspiring. On the other hand, a little self-censoring could prevent Alex from continuing to try his hand at modes almost completely incompatible with his strengths. On past albums, his stabs at shoegaze and chamber-pop were endearingly clumsy nudges against Beach Slang’s hard limitations. But the mismatch is even more pronounced on The Deadbeat Bang’s attempts at glam, a subversive subgenre by definition that requires sex or sneer to pull off, while all Alex has to work with is his adamantine earnestness.  Best case scenario, he’s able to turn out something as lovably goofy as Def Leppard’s “Rocket,” but “Sticky Thumbs” and “Born to Raise Hell” are passable facsimile at best, and the nicest thing you can say about “Stiff” is that it isn’t called “Moist.” I’m not sure who was asking for a six-minute piano ballad or more acoustic solo tracks after Quiet Slang, and yet here are “Bar No One” and “Nobody Say Nothing,” both notable solely for isolated moments of real human interactions strewn amongst the garden-variety Beach Slang-isms (“I’m murdering songs on a dead guitar,” “I’m a skeleton wrapped in gasoline”). The Deadbeat Bang of Heartbreak City is too harmless to hate, but it’s hard to feel much of anything about it—which is a fatal flaw for a band that leverages an uncanny ability to rid people of inhibitions against their better judgment. This is why the soused, sudsy production of The Things We Do is much better suited to them than the polished professionalism of Brad Wood. Ever since Beach Slang made its name on making people feel seen, everything they’ve done since had one job, and it’s one that The Deadbeat Bang of Heartbreak City barely accomplishes: to make us feel like we weren’t suckers for believing in the first place.

Walking Like We Do,The Big Moon,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f7094548e8a000826b435/1:1/w_160/thebigmoon.jpg,2020-01-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-big-moon-walking-like-we-do/,Fiction,"The Big Moon are at their best when they don’t overthink it. On “Don’t Think,” the British quartet’s most irrepressibly joyful song to date, lead singer Juliette Jackson breathes: “If you have a gut feeling, maybe you should go with it this time.” With verses describing the kind of nothing-y Friday nights out in which you spill your pint all over yourself and hold conversations that are forgotten by morning, the bass-driven song is an ode to mindless impulses, written to encourage an anxiety-riddled generation to let go. “Just don’t think about a thing,” Jackson trills on the boisterous hook. The band, which Jackson formed with guitarist Soph Nathan, bassist Celia Archer, and drummer Fern Ford in 2014, have made a minor name for themselves in the UK with hook-driven, Libertines-adjacent indie rock that would sound right at home on a Camden pub crawl. Their 2017 debut, Love in the 4th Dimension, was a clutch of angsty guitar songs nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize. But when she came to write its follow-up, Walking Like We Do—alone, as she does much of the band’s material—Jackson said she “wanted to make some music that felt really soothing and cleansing, like a tonic.” Walking Like We Do arrives in the soft glow of synth pads and layered harmonies. Inspired by the spacious pop production of Frank Ocean and James Blake, the band worked with producer Ben Allen (Animal Collective, Gnarls Barkley) in Atlanta to capture a wide-open, stripped-back sound. Nothing here is radically new—the album’s high points hark back to ’60s girl groups and ’90s pop-R&B—but it’s a departure for the guitar-heavy group, and they commit to it boldly from the first piano chords of “It’s Easy Then,” the lead single and opening track. Over a bed of bubbling synth notes, Jackson heralds their optimistic new sound—but the song’s title, and its buoyant melody, belie the darkness that prickles through its lyrics. In the full context of the chorus, “It’s easy, then/You make it hard.” Walking Like We Do may have been born from an impulse to create “soothing” songs, but it’s inextricable from the anxious mindset that requires soothing. “Maybe it’s an end ’cause this don’t feel like a start/But every generation probably thought they were the last,” Jackson quips on “Your Light.” Her lyrics touch on what it’s like to come of age amid political and ecological catastrophe, with varying degrees of sincerity. While it’s mostly played for laughs, the bare-bones piano ballad “Dog Eat Dog” offers an earnest reflection on social injustice in the UK, specifically London’s class divide. Its bleak central image is of a pigeon eating discarded chicken on the pavement. But the album’s surface-level observations don’t always register as heartfelt political commentary, and its most downbeat songs are its most forgettable. The understated approach means that clunkier ideas have nowhere to hide; on the airy ballad “Waves,” Jackson chews on the same musical idea a little too long. She strides more confidently across the playfully camp landscapes of “Take a Piece” and “Your Light,” where the sunny chorus describes a day so good that you momentarily forget you’re depressed. “Your Light” is one of many flippant, tongue-in-cheek allusions to doom on Walking Like We Do, where the possibility of total annihilation is never far from mind, but also never taken entirely seriously. “Oh our data trail’s long/We’ll never die, we’ll linger on,” Jackson deadpans on “Holy Roller.” Her self-deprecating humor channels what The New Yorker’s Jia Tolentino has called the “half-ironic millennial death wish,” the extremely online habit of expressing passion in the form of jokes about one’s own demise. Walking Like We Do has moments of thoughtless escapism—and a couple of earnest bum notes—but it comes into its own when it blends humor with darkness, suffusing everything with gentle, sarcastic nihilism.

Heavy Rain,Lee “Scratch” Perry,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e135f942ff48f0008f56845/1:1/w_160/heavyrain.jpg,2020-01-09 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lee-scratch-perry-heavy-rain/,On-U Sound,"For many artists, releasing a remixed version of your album just six months after it drops would be frivolous. For reggae legend Lee “Scratch” Perry, a man who helped invent the remix with his 1970s experiments in dub, this kind of rapid turnover runs in the blood. Heavy Rain turns out to be a stronger release than parent album Rainford: warmer, more inventive, and a great deal weirder. Not that Rainford was a failure: Billed as a Johnny Cash-style reinvention, it proved a decent stab at marrying contemporary production to Perry’s rare moments of personal reflection. But Heavy Rain, essentially a dubbed-out reinterpretation of Rainford from Perry and UK producer Adrian Sherwood plus occasional guests, plays to Rainford’s considerable strengths while papering over its weaknesses. Sometimes these are closely related. Perry’s iconic vocal tone, growling and soft, like a bear in a Björk video, is one of the key attractions of any of his records. But he does tend to ramble in his dotage, making many songs on Rainford resemble strings of non sequiturs. Heavy Rain is hardly compact or fat-free, but Perry’s often nonsensical lyrics are less jarring when treated as another instrument to be rolled about in the mix, while his gravelly vocal timbre is perfectly suited for the regimen of echo and delay that it receives on songs like “Mindworker.” By contrast, the “Heavy Rainford” remake of Rainford’s “Autobiography of the Upsetter”—one of the few overtly autobiographical songs in the latter-day Scratch catalog—feels slight in comparison to the original song’s mood of profound nostalgia. A similar logic of enhanced reduction applies to Heavy Rain’s musical bed. Perry and Sherwood strip Rainford down to its bones to better play about with individual elements, meaning that the dubs on Heavy Rain are both more minimal and more involved than their Rainford counterparts. “Here Come the Warm Dreads” (a remake of Rainford’s “Makumba Rock”) is a wonderful example. There’s not a great deal to the song—rolling bassline, shuffling drums, guitar skank, plaintive horn, and the occasional vocal interjection—but featured guest Brian Eno (on the right channel) and Adrian Sherwood (on the left) play merry hell with the mix, subjecting these elements to a magical mystery tour of production sorcery whose detail demands to be heard on good headphones. This approach also helps to highlight moments of individual brilliance: The plaintive refrain of Rainford’s “Children of the Light” works far better on Heavy Rain’s “Enlightened,” where it is untangled from Perry’s circuitous vocal and left to drift on a cloud of effects. Trombonist Vin Gordon, best known for his work with Bob Marley, is another notable highlight throughout Heavy Rain, adding such lilting melancholy to “Crickets in Moonlight” that the absence of vocal barely registers, while his instrument’s conversational tone on “Rattling Bones and Crowns” conveys more humanity than many singers’ most heartfelt confessions. That Perry’s octogenarian genius is better suited to dub than reggae (and to moods over songs) is evident in the two new tracks towards the end of Heavy Rain—“Dreams Come True” and “Above and Beyond”—whose songwriting feels overly polite compared to the album’s prevailing air of anarchic fun. That’s no big stumbling block, though: Heavy Rain is a surprisingly inspired piece of late-period dabbling from a dub master.

Networker,Omni,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e6c07b7c76f0009ccb57c/1:1/w_160/omni.jpg,2020-01-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/omni-networker/,Sub Pop,"Omni chose their new album title with a pressing question in mind: How does an aspiring musician make a living? The Atlanta post-punk duo isn’t just referring to social media with Networker—they admittedly detest it—but also the perceived obligation to rub elbows with industry folk of importance, and the depressing spectacle of observing all your friends do the same around you. Thankfully, Omni found a little success, as this record marks their Sub Pop debut. Their music has always thrummed with nervous energy, as if they were forever anticipating the worst. They’re considerably more secure since becoming labelmates with Sleater-Kinney, Beach House, and Father John Misty, but their worries haven't subsided: “Are you nervous for your career?/Are you insincere?” singer/bassist Phillip Frobos prods on opener “Sincerely Yours.” While there are mentions of modern technology, Networker is at its best when dissecting how these technologies intersect (or don’t) with the mundanities of daily life. On “Present Tense,” Frobos’ long-distance partner texts him a nude photo, but their clashing schedules keep him from responding right away. Omni’s jittery post-punk, filtered through Parquet Courts and the Talking Heads, sounds slightly dialed back here, but the lyrics still burn with unease: “Continue to avoid me/But you’d like more photos to see/Are you dreaming of the stranger that turns you on?” Frobos asks “Skeleton Key,” recounting the agonizing self-consciousness of an online fling. “With your confidence, well, where do I fit in?” begs the narrator of “Sleep Mask.” “Is your silence concentration? Or should I take a hint?” There are more question marks than full stops on the lyric sheet, presenting frustrations with no hope for a resolution. “I’m an imposter/I blend like wallpaper,” Frobos laments over the quarter-note slog of “Genuine Person,” as matter-of-factly as if he were introducing himself. At their best, Omni’s layered influences amount to a complex and absorbing churn, but here, the band sounds a bit depthless; frenzied guitar riffs can only evoke so much when there’s so little stylistic variation between them. The band is nimble and admirably tight, but most tracks chug along with similar tempos, volumes, and textures; the most memorable moments are the few welcome changes of pace, like the time signature shift of “Underage” or the synthy slow-jam of the title track. To stick with the digital-age-anxiety theme, Networker feels not unlike a dating app meetup that went fine, but not great—just entertaining enough to hold your interest for a round or two of drinks until you’ve decided you probably wouldn’t see them again.

Jesus Is Born,Kanye WestSunday Service Choir,by: Shane Cashman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e138404548e8a000826b586/1:1/w_160/sundayservice.jpeg,2020-01-08 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kanye-west-sunday-service-choir-jesus-is-born/,self-released,"Last October, Kanye West got into the booth with Zane Lowe and in a prophetic voice, he spoke: “Ye cannot die. Ye cannot be buried.” Since the genesis of his career, Kanye has had an outsized obsession with everlasting life: in art, in life, in Christ. For someone who built his earliest songs out of extracting vocal loops from obscure, sometimes decades-old songs, Kanye has seen the way musicians can be resurrected and given new life. Unearthing the voices of the dead almost makes time travelers of forgotten artists. They are rediscovered, fed through the sampler, chopped and warped and given new life in a new song, then spill anew from speakers into cars and arenas. Part of Kanye’s process is the meticulousness with which he works to flip samples by tweaking the speed, pitch, and phrasing to become something totally new. From songs like “Through the Wire,” where he flipped Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire,” and on his breakout hit, “Jesus Walks,” where he sampled the Arc Choir and gave us the first real taste of the way he fuses two seemingly disparate venues: the club and the church. To be clear, there is very little club to be found on Jesus Is Born—it is a pure gospel album. One of the most radical elements of the album is what’s absent: Kanye’s voice. Instead, he’s assembled a massive choir to channel his Christian message in a joyous, all-consuming wave of sound. Although there are no samples here, per se, it’s as if Kanye is using the choir as a living, breathing sampler. He’s still selecting old songs, whether they’re traditional hymns or late-’90s R&B hits, and recontextualizing them. The voices almost seem to warp in real-time as though Kanye were at the sampler tweaking speed and pitch. The effect can be hallucinatory, like on the opening track, “Count Your Blessings”—a rendition of Rev. Timothy Wright’s original—when the choir climbs scales that reach notes so high it makes you feel like you’re staring directly into the sun. The album is at times minimal, just voice and piano, and at other times erupts into maximal textures of trombones, drums, and fluctuating voices that are all in the service of praise and joy. And even though there is something almost psychedelic about the production, Jesus Is Born has less in common with the slick, radio-friendly textures of 21st-century gospel music. It’s more of a descendent of more traditional singers like Mahalia Jackson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and the Clark Sisters. The Sunday Service Choir as a whole also seems to be taking cues from groups with no real lead singer like the Fisk Jubilee Singers, the Dixie Hummingbirds, and the Blind Boys of Alabama. They are collectives working in tandem to praise God. Some of these acts have existed for almost a century; perhaps Kanye hopes his Sunday Service will outlast him, as well. As is the case with many creative types, West has described himself as an artist with synesthesia—he sees sound as color. As such, light plays a major role in his artistic endeavors from stage to song. He chose Roden Crater—an extinct volcano in Arizona that the visual artist James Turrell has been transforming into a naked-eye observatory for the last 40 years—to create what would become the IMAX film to accompany his first overtly devotional album from 2019, Jesus Is King. The Sunday Service Choir features prominently in the film, as though they were shooting their voices through a giant telescope into the sky as light moves through them. And there is an impermeable quality of light in the DNA of Jesus Is Born. Even when Satan is mentioned toward the end of the record, on Pastor Shirley Caesar’s “Satan, We’re Gonna Tear Your Kingdom Down.” The song exudes a clear, white, blue shimmer, just like the album cover: a bright sun suspended over blue water, framed in dark blue. The voices actually sound like they are trying to tear a hole in the sky to conquer darkness. This, of course, is the point of Jesus Is Born. Aside from spreading the gospel, it’s a way to bottle extreme light and joy. Take the album’s final song: “Total Praise.” Like many Kanye songs, a singer begins vocalizing one line, just once, from the original source (Richard Smallwood’s 1990 song of the same name). Then, just like Kanye chopping up a sample, he extracts the most affecting bit of the original song, and has the entire choir circle around the word “amen,” as tenors, sopranos, and altos pile on in sections, until the song crescendos. It’s trance-like. The best artists continue to redefine the work that defined them. Whether Kanye’s rebirth has been endearing or distancing, he is still manipulating the human voice in new and, at the very least, interesting ways. Gone is the isolated, severed, screaming head that served as his Twitter avatar for years, replaced with a view of the globe centered over Africa. Both of these versions of Kanye seem like different ways of striving for life eternal—or ways in which to speak to something greater than himself.","Kanye West’s executive-produced gospel album is the most realized music to come from this era of his career. The production and the choir’s dynamic power creates an almost hallucinatory effect.

Impossible Journey of My Soul Tonight,Lady Lazarus,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f788b9b8cd60008824911/1:1/w_160/ladylazarus_impossiblejourney.jpg,2020-01-08 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lady-lazarus-impossible-journey-of-my-soul-tonight/,self-released,"You don’t need much to make a Lady Lazarus song. Verses, choruses, a bridge? These are surplus to requirements. Accompaniment? Maybe just a splash, but it’s entirely optional. Flashy singing and lyrics? They’d just get in the way. A beginning, a middle, and an end—even these you can skip. The song should sound like it’s already been cycling forever when you press play, and like it might keep on like that forever. To make a Lady Lazarus song, all you really need is a scrap of piano melody, played loosely but with a lot of feeling, sustained and reverbed to gather the harmonics into a self-generating ambience, and a handful of refrains, as direct as you can make them, in a plainspoken first-person register. That, and a voice capable of casual beauty and laidback ardency. Oh, and you need to be Melissa Ann Sweat, whose particular experiences, daring sincerity, and healing drive add depth to simplicity, so the whole exceeds the sum. That’s the tricky part. Impossible Journey of My Soul Tonight is Sweat’s fourth album as Lady Lazarus, and her second recorded in a professional studio, John Vanderslice’s Tiny Telephone. For Sweat, it’s an ornate affair; she plays not just piano but also keyboards, electric strings, and electric vibraphone, while producer Beau Sorenson adds atmospheric synth pads and textures. But for anyone this side of Grouper’s standards, it’s still a work of elemental folk minimalism. Without big peaks or tonal shifts, the music laps over you, the accompaniment no more than shining mist blowing off the songs’ soft, regular waves. The album opens with “I Know What It Feels Like,” bathing a a few enigmatic but heartfelt phrases in glimmering Rhodes chords and strings—a song that tunes you into its subtle atmospheric fluctuations and then dissipates as dreamily as it appeared. On “I Recall July,” the endless restarting of the piano phrase and the low-tide tug of a saxophone cultivate an air of hushed anticipation. “Give a Little Bit of Yourself, Babe” is Sweat’s version of going big, which means the wavelets mass into gentle swells, but on “Golden Heart,” we’re right back to music that proceeds not by momentum, but touch by touch, thought by thought, feeling by feeling. Lady Lazarus’ songs have often been about searching for love, home, and healing, things with complex and contradictory interrelations. Impossible Journey of My Soul Tonight seems to rearrange them, and resolves a long-building chord of self-actualization. On “Driving the Streets of Your Town,” Sweat, who lived in Austin and elsewhere before she returned to her native Santa Cruz County, describes cruising alone at 4 a.m. through streets she left at 18, taking stock of what’s still there and what’s gone. This quiet moment, which has the introspective solitude that has distinguished her best songs since “The Eye in the Eye of the Storm,” 10 years ago, comes near the beginning of the album, where the lyrics are all about waiting and remembering. But by “Golden Heart,” illusions are dissolving. The tenses of Sweat’s verbs of longing are changing from present to past, clearing the way for something new. By the end, an open-ended vision of solitude and freedom has emerged, one that will resonate with anyone who has sought home elsewhere but found it within, or anyone who’s still trying to.","Produced by Beau Sorenson and recorded at John Vanderslice’s Tiny Telephone, Melissa Ann Sweat’s fourth album as Lady Lazarus is a searching work of elemental folk minimalism.

Resonance,Aleksi Perälä,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e134faa2ff48f0008f56843/1:1/w_160/resonance.jpg,2020-01-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aleksi-perala-resonance/,Trip,"Aleksi Perälä started out in the late ’90s recording ambient electronica under the names Ovuca and Astrobotnia, but the Finnish producer has hit a particularly rich seam of late, and he owes it all to Colundi. What is Colundi? Well, it’s kind of hard to say. At its simplest, its advocates explain, it’s an alternative tuning system—“the Colundi Sequence”—that rejects conventional Western tuning in favor of a number of unusual resonant frequencies. Dig through the web pages and internet groups dedicated to its existence, though, and the story rapidly becomes more tangled and unlikely, taking in numerology, mysticism, sacred geometry, and various flavors of woo. It’s probably sensible to take the rhetoric surrounding Colundi with a big pinch of salt, but it’s undeniable that for Perälä, the idea has been galvanizing. In the last year or two, he’s released a startling brace of music through Bandcamp and on a string of friendly labels—and Resonance, his second release for Nina Kraviz’s трип, is a giddy joy. There are echoes of the music that Perälä made for his friend Aphex Twin’s Rephlex Records in the ’00s—obscure IDM releases guided by a misty sense of melody. If those early albums often had a muted or dreamy quality, though, Resonance feels bold and upfront: a journey through beatific techno modes defined by its heady propulsion. A familiar characteristic of IDM is a certain rhythmic fussiness— intricately filleted breakbeats, head-scratching time signatures, disorienting glitches. No such tactics are on display on Resonance. On the contrary, you often get the sense that Perälä is searching for the path of least resistance, hoping to unlock some sort of ecstatic yogic flow. The bulk of the record’s 46 minutes is dominated by a thumping four-on-the-floor kick, but the unrelenting drums are a framework through which Perälä drapes dazzling electronic progressions—glimmering stargazer melodies, growling acid lines, or ringing tones that evoke the holy calm of wind chimes in a rural temple. The result is curiously multifarious: You can easily imagine these tracks dropped deep in the mix at Berghain or Tresor, but they feel equally suited to meditation or contemplation. There are very few dull spots, although the 10 tracks feel very much of a piece, or like variations on a theme. The identikit titling—“UKMH51900039” through to “UKMH51900048”—gives the impression Perälä might have made them in a single sitting, molding them to his secret formula. In interviews, Perälä talks about Colundi as if it holds the answer to life, the universe, and everything in between. But you don’t necessarily have to swallow Colundi to appreciate what he’s doing. The best electronic dance music stirs the soul as well as the body, and Resonance—sparkling, ecstatic, slightly enigmatic—does just that.","The Finnish producer continues his streak of luminous electronic releases with an ecstatic, body-moving, and curiously serene collection of techno bangers.

Flock,Karin Hellqvist,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f7bb87bc3a600084022dc/1:1/w_160/flock.jpg,2020-01-08 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/karin-hellqvist-flock/,Lawo Classics,"For a classical music recitalist, focusing almost exclusively on contemporary, experimental material requires multiple forms of courage. Most obvious among the challenges is the fact that new works are rarely as crowd-pleasing as the vintage hits. And there are additional dangers to be navigated: When presenting cutting-edge works that might seek to subvert the audience’s understanding of an instrument, a soloist risks allowing listeners to come away thinking that the playing isn’t all that impressive. Violinist Karin Hellqvist doesn’t just brave these roiling waters. She seems to enjoy being submerged in them. She’s secure in her art, and doesn’t need an audience to be constantly thinking about her virtuosity. On Flock, her first album-length recording as a solo artist, Hellqvist takes her time before showing off her chops. But when the fast, arpeggiated patterns of composer Henrik Strindberg’s “Femte strängen” (“The Fifth String”) finally appear, as the third track on this daring, engaging record, they merely confirm a fact that close listeners will have already identified—namely, that Hellqvist is a player of substantial gifts. One of those gifts is a subtle feel for bow pressure. During “Femte strängen”—a piece that has some of the profound, minimalist calm of Arvo Pärt’s music—Hellqvist resists the temptation to join fast-flowing riffs with more dramatically forceful sound production. The result is a kind of airy, pensive calm, even during the more animated passages. By showing this kind of restraint, the violinist makes sure that when a composition gear-shifts into a new level of dynamic intensity, the change really smacks you in the face. That ability to make even minute variations in intensity register as big events underlies the first two tracks on Flock. Both Carola Bauckholt’s “Doppelbelichtung” (“Double Exposure”) and Jan Martin Smørda’s “flock foam fume” are texture-first compositions. This is electroacoustic music heavily influenced by early musique concrete, using field recordings of birds (in the first case) and layers of pre-recorded sound (in the second) to create delicate forms of drama. Some of the scraping textures might tempt you to ask, “Is this even violin playing?” The short answer is, sure—though this isn’t contemporary classical music you can put on while cooking. You probably shouldn’t even try to listen on earbuds; any ambient sound from your environment that intrudes into these pieces has the power to cover up some fine detail. Yet despite the hothouse-flower delicacy of these soundscapes, they reward close attention, thanks in part to Hellqvist’s sensitivity as a player. The track that closes the album—“Sagittarius A*,” by Natasha Barrett—is decidedly the highlight. Barrett is an international star in the niche contemporary-music circuit of “spatialized sound.” (Think surround sound, squared, with dozens of channels of sound refracted in high-density speaker arrays, around an audience.) While she’s a specialist when it comes to using newfangled programs to disperse and spin sound in ultra-high-tech environments, she’s also just a flat-out interesting composer—a trait that comes across well in a two-channel stereo recording of this extended work. Over its 29-minute span, the piece has something like a three-act structure. Seemingly beginning in the middle of things, with a pleasing ambiguity regarding which parts are live violin and which pre-recorded, the first third of the work rests in a simmering state of near-quiet that Hellqvist clearly enjoys. But there are stark shifts to be relished throughout, as Barrett’s electronic designs put on a master class of their own: harmonizing with Hellqvist, contributing bell-like chimes, and playing with spatial perception. Though the causes of all these sonic fluctuations are sometimes hard to parse, the pace and intensity are not difficult to understand at all, with emotional effects not unlike those found in other relentless styles of music. That it can all transpire in a relatively hushed environment is merely a testament to the skills of both Barrett and Hellqvist. Around the 10-minute mark, we start to hear intimations of rising conflict—particularly when a droning background pattern of electronically adapted violin suddenly flowers into white noise. The last third of the work represents a relaxing or unwinding. But for all that broadly understandable structure, “Sagittarius A*” eludes pat understandings. It’s an experience worth taking, multiple times, without trying to conscript it into association with other things you’ve heard before. Who knows—in a few decades, it could even be a crowd favorite.","The Swedish violinist’s first album-length recording as a solo artist confirms both her uncompromisingly experimental instincts and substantial musical gifts.

k bye for now (swt live),Ariana Grande,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f6b5db7c76f0009ccb5f5/1:1/w_160/kbyefornow.jpg,2020-01-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ariana-grande-k-bye-for-now-swt-live/,Republic,"We didn’t need an Ariana Grande live album. The sweeping, hour-and-a-half-long recording of her Sweetener world tour offers faithful renditions of recent and past hits; very little is new here, beyond a pre-recorded cover of a song from a Cole Porter musical. These are recitations, not re-interpretations. Videos circulated over the summer of Grande crying during some of her concerts, but on the recorded tracks selected for the album—stitched together from various tour stops, so that she shouts out a different city nearly every song—she is polished and composed. Even if a live album may not have been necessary, k bye for now gleams. It is both a capsule and a capstone, encompassing a nine-month, 102-show tour at what might be the peak of Grande’s career. While k bye for now may not have much new information, it builds on our understanding of Grande as an artist. We know she has a dazzling voice, but we get to hear it swoop and pierce while the audience shrieks around her. We know she’s lurched and leaned into hip hop aesthetics; on the live album, we hear her chirp into raps over recorded features from Nicki Minaj and Big Sean. We also see different shades of some tracks. “Break up with your girlfriend i’m bored,” a song that can come across as glib and brash as its title, becomes huskier and tender. Sighs and coos trickle into spaces where production was left sparse. “Side to Side” crackles with a live band. The sing-songy flow of “7 rings” becomes more lilting and precise; after the line, “Happiness is the same price as red bottoms,” she blurts out, “Just kidding!” While the tour focused on Sweetener and thank u, next, Grande weaves in past highlights from her catalog that demonstrate how much she’s grown. The titanic Zedd banger “Break Free” is fun, but can’t compare to the nuance and texture of a song like “God is a woman.” “Break Your Heart Right Back” sounds flimsy and disposable when followed by “NASA.” k bye for now becomes a way to track throughlines of Grande’s career: how feathery murmurs bloomed into dynamic tapestries, how flamboyant love ballads led to delicate pop anthems. One of the live album’s greatest assets is the juxtapositions created by the newly shuffled song order; thank u, next tracks glow brighter beside the softer edges of Sweetener songs. The pleas of “Needy” are more urgent and lovely when preceded by “Breathin,” a galvanic song about anxiety attacks. “Thank u, next” becomes even more stunning when “no tears left to cry” bleeds into it, coaxing a way forward through loss. Like any live album, k bye for now strains to transmit the feeling of an actual concert, and banter about costumes and dancers is a clumsy reminder. Recordings only capture part of what illuminated the Sweetener tour—not outfit changes or neon lights, but the power of a woman confronting trauma. At a Brooklyn show this past summer, sobs slipped out of me during “get well soon.” Grande was singing about flashbacks, dissociations that wrench you out of your body—feelings I had barely described to other people, and had never heard sang back at me. In the live recording, her voice drops to a low, raw shudder. But just a few tracks later, you can hear her laugh.","Ariana Grande’s live album is both a capsule and a capstone, encompassing a nine-month, 102-show tour at what might be the peak of her career.

The Undivided Five,A Winged Victory for the Sullen,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e2fee3c598c000864e043/1:1/w_160/theundividedfive.jpg,2020-01-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen-the-undivided-five/,Ninja Tune,"To ambient fans, Adam Wiltzie is the marquee name in A Winged Victory for the Sullen, simply because he was also in Stars of the Lid. But to everyone else, it would probably be pianist Dustin O’Halloran. He won an Emmy for his Debussy-redolent Transparent theme, which wrings unaccountable amounts of nostalgia, sadness, and hope from a simple waltz. Shaping emotional resonance around other people’s art has been the neoclassical ambient duo’s main pastime since its self-titled debut in 2011. Following scores for film and one for the prominent choreographer Wayne McGregor, The Undivided Five is the second album to showcase what they can do working off of their own images and concepts. One might expect themes for an imaginary film, but this isn’t film music. It takes too long. Opener “Our Lord Debussy” traverses more than nine minutes at a kingly pace, the piano marching under high-flown regalia of strings and modular synths. There are few extractable moments because everything is interwoven; any time something is resolving, something else is taking shape. The effect is lush and orchestral, with rich bass notes in the piano and intimations of violin solos, but also mystically steeped in ambient music’s eternal present. Like everyone else since the Guggenheim retrospective, Wiltzie and O’Halloran have apparently fallen under the spell of Hilma af Klint, the proto-abstract painter and theosophist who partly developed her visual language in séances with a group of women called “The Five.” This accounts for the album’s predominance of perfect fifths—which girdle the timbral complexity in rings of harmonic stability—as well as its almost ecstatic, almost painful lyricism. If it’s not obvious, this is catnip for fans of Max Richter, Tim Hecker, and especially Jóhann Jóhannsson, the duo’s friend and collaborator, who died near the beginning of work on the album. Studio sessions ranged across several countries—Germany, Hungary, Belgium, a grand piano in the Italian woods, overdubs at Ben Frost’s Iceland digs—in search of arcane reverbs and other fine acoustical qualities, which Francesco Donadello’s analog mix gives a supple finish. Around the time of Jóhannsson’s death, O’Halloran found out he was having his first child, and The Undivided Five trembles on a threshold between sorrow and joy, ending and beginning, life and afterlife. Aching strings emerge like fated events from the everyday seep and curl of passing time. Long minutes pass by dredging up one vast, submerged chord. Each track is its own study in loneliness, yet each is in communication with the others, like spirit mediums. “Aqualung, Motherfucker” is an endless beginning, with a few purposeful strides trailing off in mid-air again and again. It doesn’t really take flight until the next song, “A Minor Fifth Is Made of Phantoms,” where melancholy fanfare is packed into growling sub-basses that will explode halfway through “Adios, Florida.” It’s a softly shocking climax before the music swiftly resumes its giant-tortoise composure. Yes, “Aqualung, Motherfucker.” Wiltzie and O’Halloran have a funny habit of impeccably observing the solemn, elevated conventions of ambient music, and then writing song titles that mock elevated solemnity. As their debut offered “Steep Hills of Vicodin Tears” and “We Played Some Open Chords,” The Undivided Five sad-trombones itself with “The Haunted Victorian Pencil” and “The Slow Descent Has Begun.” I’ve never quite figured out how to interpret this incongruity, which I kind of love. Maybe they’re just terrible at song titles? But I think they know what they’re doing. I like to imagine that it’s a reminder to themselves and us not to take all this mortal pomp too seriously, even as they aim to leave no soul unstirred.

New Ways,Leif Vollebekk,by: Amanda Wicks,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbf16c1dc57a0008952c56/1:1/w_160/leif.jpg,2020-01-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leif-vollebekk-new-ways/,Secret City,"While putting the final touches on his third album, 2017’s Twin Solitude, Canadian songwriter Leif Vollebekk began to understand it better. Across 10 tracks, he’d mourned the dissolution of a relationship, grasping to resolve his past as newfound success created geographic and emotional distance. Only when he stopped searching did clarity find him. Rather than revise Twin Solitude, Vollebekk set about fashioning new songs to explore his growing perspective. “I started working on this new record [New Ways] while I was mixing that one,” he told Atwood Magazine. “I had this idea,” he said, “that it would be a companion piece.” Vollebekk sensed chatter between the two projects—so much so that he considered titling the new album Phaedrus, after Plato’s dialogue by the same name. Among the discussion topics in Plato’s Phaedrus is the effect of writing on memory: how creating a record of an event discourages remembering it. Vollebekk doesn’t heed that warning. New Ways sidles up to the past, opening a dialogue with time, with place, and with the person he’s been. One central figure lingers across the album—a present absence that sits easier than on Twin Solitude. “She’s my woman and she loved me so fine,” Vollebekk sings on the bruised “Never Be Back.” Love has come and gone, but on New Ways the lesson finally sticks. “She’ll never be back, never be back,” he adds, briskly repeating himself. The steady piano paces Vollebekk’s manic verses. His desire to understand hasn’t abated, but he no longer seeks to change the past—merely to invoke it. “Not making a case for you or for trying,” he sings. Vollebekk laces his capacious, meandering music with a ’60s folk-jazz sensibility. As with Twin Solitude, he recorded New Ways directly to tape, allowing each song’s mood to dictate its direction. “When I hear music, I hear lots of space,” he’s explained, “and then I find that when I add instruments it’s almost like somebody saying too much [...] or saying the wrong thing. It takes the air out of the room.” The sparse, tense “Hot Tears” doubles his voice while a piano and burnished hi-hat clear space to collate bygone days. When he fills out that baseline with a sumptuous Wurlitzer (as on “The Way That You Feel”) or a crestfallen sax (as on “Wait a While”), the songs remain understated and affecting. His frenetic lyricism sits in clarifying contrast to the spare arrangements, the same qualities that helped Twin Solitude earn nominations for the Polaris Prize and Juno Award. “Hot Tears” and “Transatlantic Flight” stand out, but on the whole New Ways doesn’t live up to the emotional spark of its predecessor. There’s a point when mulling over the same memories shifts into melancholia; Vollebekk comes close to that cliff, but he keeps regret at bay by focusing on reality. The drums on “I’m Not Your Lover” tick like a clock as he traces how time has changed his circumstances: “Drifting in thrift stores I see something pretty/See a jacket I’d wear ’til I gave it to you,” he sings, before soberly reminding himself, “I’m not your lover.” On “Phaedrus”—what remains of the album’s original title—he repeats the first and last verses as if they were a mantra: “The way that it was/Is the way it should be.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","Conceived as a companion piece to 2017’s Twin Solitude, the Canadian songwriter’s fourth album is a dialogue with the person he’s been.

La Luz de la Esperanza,San Cha,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e2a7520a40600082f7398/1:1/w_160/laluzdelaesperanza.jpg,2020-01-07 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/san-cha-la-luz-de-la-esperanza/,self-released,"In August of 2015, Lizette Anabelle Gutierrez fled the San Francisco Bay for her aunt’s farm in Jalostitlán, Jalisco, Mexico. In San Francisco, she had hosted a monthly goth/industrial/punk/drag party called Dark Room, and as San Cha, she made the kind of music you might hear at that party. But she arrived in Jalisco defeated and downtrodden, emotionally drained by a toxic relationship with a mentor who turned on her. It was at this nadir that the idea for La Luz de la Esperanza was born. Encouraged by her tía, she embraced the region’s rancheras, traditional folk songs that originated in the Mexican countryside. Her aunt liked to remind her of Pepe Aguilar, a legendary ranchera artist who at one time aspired to rock’n’roll stardom; it was only once he embraced rancheras that he became a star. As they did for Aguilar, these Mexican folk songs helped Gutierrez find her voice, pushing her outside of her comfort zone to realize that she indeed had the range. Enamored with the beauty and drama of the telenovelas she grew up with, Gutierrez conceptualized her own, using the rancheras as the vehicle for her own novela. But the scale of her ambition exceeded her means, and it would be a dream deferred. She shelved the novela and focused on writing what would become Capricho del Diablo (“The Devil’s Whim”), a stunning cumbia goth EP that told the story of the mentor that tortured her and drove her from the Bay in the first place. Capricho del Diablo christened a new sound for San Cha, and its success opened up new opportunities. Supported with studio time and funding, she was able to manifest her dream at the Red Bull Music Festival Los Angeles, staging the multi-act novela in a converted church complete with the full band, background singers, elaborate sets, costumes, and makeup she originally envisioned. La Luz de la Esperanza is the realization of that dream. The story follows Dolores, a domestic worker at an opulent estate who falls for a suave aristocrat named Salvador. It queers the telenovela trope of a poor girl falling for a rich man: Dolores is poor but elegant, bathed in sunlight. She’s inhabited, but not haunted, by the spirit Esperanza, the embodiment of hope; when she finds true love it’s not with a handsome prince, but with a femme ghost. In many ways, the record serves as a metaphorical backdrop for San Cha’s life and career. Dolores is romanced by the prospect of a better life, only to find herself caged, abused, and ultimately rescued by a ghost. Musically, the songs on La Luz de la Esperanza feel like modernized rancheras with a rock edge and a goth sensibility. You can hear these disparate influences on tracks like “Por el Horizonte,” with its choral harmonies, thumping bassline, and layered guitar tracks that wail as dramatically as a telenovela character finding out their lover is in a coma. “Prettiest Thing” injects an electric charge into a ranchera guitar, with dreamy atmospherics that capture the weightlessness of falling in love. Throughout the record, San Cha effortlessly mixes Spanish and English, acoustic and electronic sounds, rock riffs and towering, operatic vocals. Her voice is a revelation, immensely powerful; it evokes wondrous beauty as she plumbs the depths of tragedy. She could always sing, but those classic rancheras her tía pressed her to sing helped her realize her voice’s true strength. It’s the perfect vehicle for her talent. This may not technically be San Cha’s first record—she released the industrial goth-rock LP Off Her Throne! in 2013—but it is still very much a debut. It’s a work of art that took her entire life to make, the synthesis of years of struggle and growth, a style forged on the ranches of Jalisco and in the queer clubs of San Francisco. La Luz de la Esperanza is San Cha’s journey of self-actualization, empowered by the spirits of her ancestors to crush her demons into a fine powder and then use it to beat her face with a perfect smoky eye.","The Latinx artist reimagines traditional Mexican ranchera folk songs with a goth edge and a lavish, telenovela-style production.

JACKBOYS,Travis Scott,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0f6f452ff48f0008f567cb/1:1/w_160/jackboys_travis.jpg,2020-01-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/travis-scott-jackboys/,Cactus Jack,"In 2018, Travis Scott became a bonafide rap superstar, reaching a plateau where the only way to prove how high you’ve reached is to bring other guys up there, too. And so here comes his obligatory label compilation, a signal boost for his signees designed to be a flex in and of itself. Only problem is: He doesn’t have much of a crew. The only people in Scott’s orbit are the three rappers signed to his Cactus Jack imprint: Don Toliver, Luxury Tax 50, and Sheck Wes (in a joint deal with GOOD Music). As roster compilations go, this seven-track sampler spread what few assets it has too thin and hardly makes for a showcase. JACKBOYS has been pegged as a “debut album” for the titular crew, but that is clearly an overstatement. There are two Don Toliver songs and one Sheck Wes song. There is one Luxury Tax 50 verse. Travis Scott fills out the tracklist with a 50-second instrumental and a remix to his recent hit single, “Highest in the Room,” with Rosalía and Lil Baby. JACKBOYS is a branding opportunity, pure and simple: From the Harmony Korine cover art to the promotional film shot as if A24 produced a Need For Speed sequel, it all seems like empty influencer bait. This is music as part of a merch bundle, about as necessary as a branded fire extinguisher. With ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott finally earned the maestro mantle he was so eager to bestow upon himself, but that curator’s touch is missing here. Pop Smoke is in his element over AXL’s drill production on “Gatti,” pushing Travis into the margins. The song sounds like diet “Welcome to the Party,” and drill isn’t the kind of subgenre where you’re looking to cut calories. “Out West” finds Young Thug carrying Travis (for the umpteenth time), and in this case Thug is barely even trying. Don Toliver’s “Had Enough” is his song in name only; with Quavo and Offset on hand, it sounds like another Migos demo for the Carters’ album with its blatant “Summer” sample and blank, reference-track vocal takes. The sole JACKBOYS posse cut, “Gang Gang,” is all over the place, squandering WondaGurl production. If anyone comes off like they didn’t waste their time making this, it’s Don Toliver, who goes full tilt even working in the periphery of other people’s songs. His breakthrough on ASTROWORLD’s “Can’t Say” outlined his promise; his was such a distinct performance among an all-star cast that it left listeners scrambling to identify him on the creditless tracklist. He doesn’t squander any of that goodwill here, coming off as a budding talent even as the album grows more and more forgettable. (He scored his first TikTok hit with “No Idea” late last year.) Toliver is like the T-1000 model of Travis Scott: he uses Auto-Tune to similar effect, but he works in a higher octave range than Scott and is simply a more lifelike upgrade of his prototype. This is best expressed on “What to Do?”, a duet with Scott in which they both try to put the pieces of a drunken night back together. It’s Toliver who sounds like he’s rallying, his voice less like a piece of software and more an instrument of feeling. His singsong verse is one of the few moments on JACKBOYS that isn’t just product.","The newly minted rap superstar’s obligatory label compilation is more merch bundle than album.

Super Enthusiast,Macseal,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e32913c598c000864e045/1:1/w_160/macseal_superenthusiast.jpg,2020-01-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/macseal-super-enthusiast/,6131,"In 2019, “emo from Long Island” and “Long Island emo” are two very different things. Over the last few years, the classic poison-pen-valentine sound has slowly commingled with the bookish, bashful indie rock that was once seen as its antidote in the era of Fuse video blocks. While Oso Oso’s Basking In the Glow remains the most brilliant example, you can also hear it in the extended universe of associates and peers that has sprung up around Jade Lillitri. Guitarist and Yunahon Mixtape producer Billy Mannino released a strong debut this year as Bigger Better Sun, while Lillitri’s former State Lines bandmate Tom Werring bowed with Yeah Is What We Have; both drew on Death Cab and Teenage Fanclub more often than the Starting Line or Taking Back Sunday. Macseal is the project of singer-songwriter Ryan Bartlett, but the Lillitri EU extends here as well—the band’s Francesca Impastato once served as Oso Oso’s touring drummer. Unlike Werring and Mannino, who more or less arrived fully formed, Bartlett on Super Enthusiast sounds stuck in the middle road, trying to summon the confidence to change lanes. This problem is hardly exclusive to Macseal—as with alt-country, grunge, and shoegaze in earlier years, power-pop is emo’s exit strategy du jour, and just ask longtime Joyce Manor fans what they think of Barry Johnson getting into Big Star. Turns out that power-pop and emo aren’t instantaneously compatible—emo is driven by anxious, imperfect musicianship where the former prides itself on being finicky and clever, emotional distance often proof of a sense of craft. Macseal prove to be adept students, as evidenced by the cascading melodic resolution in “Graduating Steps” or the beaming falsetto lines neatly layered like rainbow Jello on “Without a Trace.” Against the kind of meandering verse melodies that typified Macseal’s earliest work, the pop classicism here is endearing and jarring. As he did with Wild Pink’s Yolk in the Fur, producer Justin Pizzoferrato exfoliates a once-scruffy band for proper mainstream presentation and otherwise trusts the songwriting to provide the dynamic frills. But while “Always Hazy” and “Irving” could safely blend into the latest All New Indie Spotify list, they can just easily pass by without any kind of impression. Both songs are victims of Bartlett not completely trusting himself. There’s a discernible emotional core in each—a coming of age, a realization of failure—but both are obscured by lyrics that sacrifice clarity and concision to read nice on paper. “What’s clear to me, has always been hazy,” he sings—an unintentionally meta moment. However, the late-autumn crispness of the sound (and its early November release date) is no accident. Super Enthusiast addresses life from a standpoint where the afterglow of summer or graduation has long faded and the reality of “Where do I go from here?” has set in. “They reserve a special kind of defeat/For when your new home spits you back to old/They expect a swift and solemn retreat/Back to the hole that you first crawled out of,” Szilagyi moans on “Graduating Steps,” an earnest show of empathy for boomerang kids who watch friendships fade, people outgrow each other, and nostalgia become a trap. If “Graduating Steps,” like much of Super Enthusiast, feels like it’s stopping shy of conveying the kind of energy suitable for its youthful milieu, notice that it’s describing a special kind of defeat—a point where anger gives way to surrender. If Super Enthusiast seems hamstrung with uncertainty about Macseal’s next phase, that’s pretty much the entire point.

E,Ecco2k,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e2624f3d2500009bb06d4/1:1/w_160/e_ecco2k.jpg,2020-01-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ecco2k-e/,YEAR0001,"Ecco2k’s work until this point has been in the service of other people’s visions: The Swedish artist (aka Zak Arogundade) is creative director for his compatriot Yung Lean, editor of music videos for Yves Tumor, and an occasional runway model. He’s also a member of Drain Gang, the Yung Lean-adjacent collective that includes producer Whitearmor and vocalists Bladee and Thaiboy Digital. There’s been an air of mystery to Arogundade’s output as a multi-hyphenate creator; his career can be traced through guest features, behind-the-scenes credits, and cameos in the background of his friends’ videos. Perhaps somewhat unusually for a hyper-prolific jack-of-all-trades with his fingers in multiple artistic economies, Ecco2k seems fine letting his collaborators take most of the credit, happy to offer his varied skill set as a helping hand to other artists. But wherever he turns up, it’s impossible to mistake Ecco2k’s voice for anyone else’s. That his fluttering, almost angelic falsetto has appeared only sporadically on other people’s records has made Drain Gang’s devoted fanbase—self-described “drainers”—even hungrier for his debut. Beauty might be relegated to the background of Yung Lean’s music, in dialectic with the darkness of his lyrics and the occasional awkwardness of his delivery, but Ecco2k places aesthetic pleasure and warm feeling up front. More than anything else, the word to describe Ecco2k’s music is pretty, like a gentle tune from a music box. His light wail is often refracted through Auto-Tune but other times hangs plain and soft, devoid of digital manipulation. Thaiboy Digital and Yung Lean’s take on rap is a looking-glass version of the American mainstream, but they can clearly be described as rappers. Ecco2k is different, and on E he jettisons most everything resembling hip-hop save for a loose, familiar framework of pounding 808s and occasional Soulja Boy references; this is the Stockholm rap scene’s most explicit stab at pop yet. Most tracks are still produced by Gud and Whitearmor, but Ecco2k strays from the Drain Gang house sound on “Fruit Bleed Juice” and “AAA Powerline,” both produced by genre-hopping compatriot Yves Tumor. On tracks like “Calcium,” Ecco2k alternates between very light rapping with a vaguely pop-punk vocal performance over beats that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Charli XCX project. These songs offer the vague outline of radio hits, filled in with an uncanny substance. Tracks quickly rewind and fast-forward, sputter and start again, phrases repeated like fading memories turned over and over again in your mind. The opening track, “AAA Powerline,” is built largely around the repeated refrain “Zip-tied up/Can’t move my arms.” Ecco2k’s lyrics twinge with anguish and self-loathing. “Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters,” he laments on “Security!,” a song built on the desire to disguise a perceived ugliness inside: “How did you get so perfect?/I wish that I was perfect.” As much as he might feel at odds with himself, the strongest track on E is a resolute commitment to self-expression. “Peroxide” plays up the contrast between Ecco2k’s ever-changing hair and the color of his skin: “No peroxide/I stay dark.” In a 2016 interview, a then-21-year-old Arogundade reflected on his experience growing up mixed—his mother is Swedish and his father is British and Nigerian—in a region known for racial homogeny: “I used to not want to be in the sun because I didn’t want to get sunburned; I didn’t want to get darker skin and just, like, really dumb stuff like that. But now it’s kind of the other way around, so I’m very much embracing being a black person.” That self-acceptance radiates from “Peroxide,” even if the world around Ecco2k still labels him an outsider: “They all stare at me/I don’t care at all.” When Yung Lean and his Sad Boys collective first emerged in 2012, the appeal of their music lay mostly in the dissonant juxtaposition of childish lyrics with achingly beautiful beats. As his work matured, Lean ditched the novelty of profane juvenilia, reaching for something more honest and introspective. Ecco2k has never really messed around with gimmickry or mimicry, shooting straight for the heart from the start. When he sings of breaking out of straitjackets, he’s referring as much to the confines of genre as the limits of his own identity. Ecco2k is committed to staying dark, but his music gleams bright in a region and rap scene known for its cloudiness. No longer just a below-the-line collaborator or background associate, on E he finally steps into the spotlight.","The debut album from this Swedish multi-hyphenate, an associate of Yung Lean and Yves Tumor, trades hip-hop for an expressive—and surprisingly pretty—take on contemporary pop.

Hymn to Moisture,Rrose,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbe8681dc57a0008952c52/1:1/w_160/hymntomoisture.jpg,2020-01-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rrose-hymn-to-moisture/,Eaux,"Marcel Duchamp loved aliases, in part for the creative license they afforded. As R. Mutt, he produced one of his most famous pieces: Fountain (1917), an ordinary urinal tipped on its side and signed with the fake name. Rrose Sélavy—a pun on the phrase “Eros, c’est la vie” (“Sex, that’s life”)—was another of the Dada figure’s assumed names; often described as Duchamp’s female alter ego, Sélavy authored various artworks and essays and even sat, clad in feathers and furs, for photographic portraits by Man Ray. Rrose, the California native Seth Horvitz’s principal musical project over the past nine years, takes from Rrose Sélavy both her name and her gender-flipping, appearing in drag on stage and in press photos. But while this act of borrowing might also seem fundamentally Duchampian, Rrose is not a conceptual project. Horvitz deploys the time-honored materials of techno at its purest—walloping kick drums, flayed hi-hats, undulating waves of synthesizer—in a way that is overwhelmingly immediate, at once bone-shaking and mind-melting. Since Rrose’s first EPs, in 2011, Horvitz has worked techno’s standard tropes into an increasingly elastic form, leaning into the destabilizing effects of repetition and relishing the impact of small changes carried out gradually. This is a music of exacting precision and also profound mystery. Hymn to Moisture, Rrose’s debut album, is of a piece with much of Horvitz’s work until now, full of ominous low-end throb, churning delay, and synths that buzz like an electrical substation. As familiar as the textures and templates might be, it’s clear from the very first track how far the project has come from the comparatively straightforward sound of Rrose’s early output. The opening “Mine” contains traces of its influences—the pinging lead nods to minimalists like Jeff Mills and Mika Vainio, while the clanging dub delay recalls Basic Channel—but nothing here is business as usual. The complex time signature defies parsing; the way the tingling, twinkling high end gradually dissolves into a dissonant wash of tone suggests a gamelan orchestra being melted for scrap. Driven forward by an insistent double-time bass pulse, the song feels like a forced march into quicksand. Similarly queasy sensations abound. The malevolent “Bandage” sets microtonal chimes against a bristling bass synth, filters opening and closing like the petals of some hellish flower as the time signature imperceptibly shifts; the ambient “Saliva” and “Hymn to Moisture” forgo beats entirely, luxuriating in the cloudy richness of perpetually shape-shifting synthesizers. It’s not all so dark; “Horizon,” a highlight, channels the cyclical arpeggios of kraut-influenced groups like Emeralds while managing to remain somehow more techno than prog. Even a nominally club-oriented track like “Columns” refuses to deliver the regular dopamine hits that have become de rigueur in mainstream techno. Stretching faint, dissonant drones over its unsteady pitter-pat rhythm, it’s all about the long view, right down to a foggy outro that lingers for a good two minutes once the beats have gone silent, like steam rising from wet pavement after a summer storm. In track after track, a similar impulse propels listeners across unfamiliar territory, leaving little hint of how they’ve gotten there. Where a Rrose track ends up is rarely anything like where it’s begun. Where Rrose Sélavy provided Duchamp with an opportunity for the gender play that he found useful in drawing out hidden meanings from familiar objects, Horvitz’s use of gender is less obvious in its ends. Initially, he has said, assuming the guise “was a way for me to subvert the element of the white male techno image, which I was not comfortable representing on stage.” More recently, he has attempted to clarify what Rrose represents: “a persona, a political statement, an exploration of identity, meant to provide some magic in the performance space.” It is sometimes easier to say what Rrose is not than what she is. But there’s something about the very uncertainty around the alias that suits the music. Although Rrose is a persona, the project doesn’t foreground personality; the artist's self-presentation couldn’t be further from the cult of stardom that typifies big-business techno these days, and the music follows suit. Listen to a track like “Dissolve,” and it’s easy to imagine what dancing to it might feel like: not celebratory, not a party, but a private activity, practically levitating, cocooned in sound and lost in space. At moments like these, Rrose represents a destabilizing force—a decentering of identity and an erasure of all the hierarchies that can make dance music such a plodding, ponderous affair. Hymn to Moisture is an exploration of the limits of perception—an ode to the way that the self, under the right conditions, can disappear into the music. If Rrose is an alter ego, then Hymn to Moisture is an ode to ego death.

So,Peter Gabriel,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfd0cb5b095f90009ab2804/1:1/w_160/so_petergabriel.jpg,2020-01-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peter-gabriel-so/,Geffen,"On January 1, 1984, television stations around the world aired a program produced by video artist Nam June Paik titled “Good Morning, Mr. Orwell.” Described by host George Plimpton as “a rather unusual event in live television” and “a global disco,” Paik’s special aimed to counter George Orwell’s dystopian vision of the dawning year, where mass media and fascism were to become inextricable. Instead, Plimpton announced, the program would feature “positive and interactive uses of electronic media, which Mr. Orwell, the fierce media prophet, never predicted.” As the broadcast wound on, however, it was clear that Paik created it with tongue firmly in cheek: It was plagued with technical difficulties in satellite link-ups, multiple performances airing at the same time, and wildly overdone graphics manipulation. Befitting the year that would inaugurate the music video revolution, “Good Morning” was an irreverent, avant-garde MTV in miniature, with performances by Merce Cunningham, Oingo Boingo, Allen Ginsberg, Simply Red, and to open the program, a duet between Peter Gabriel and Laurie Anderson. The two art-pop icons lip-synced “Excellent Birds,” which they’d co-written a week or so earlier at Paik’s request. The song’s aphoristic lyrics were aligned with Anderson’s 1982 debut Big Science, while the song’s funk-derived bassline and synthesized flute sample hewed much closer to Gabriel’s 1982 self-titled fourth solo album, dubbed Security by his American label Geffen. The green-screened visuals—cutting-edge for the time—staged the pair pensively gazing and spasmodically dancing over a series of dazzling and futuristic backdrops. The “Birds” performance signified an important sonic and technological pivot point in Gabriel’s career. He split from UK art-rock titans Genesis nearly a decade earlier because he wanted fewer dissenting voices pushing back against his grand plans to more fully merge sound with visual images, and explore forms of music that didn’t emerge from the European canon. Like his avant-garde pop contemporaries Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, Gabriel moved out of a theatrical British art-rock group and into the ’80s with an eye towards non-Western composition and cutting-edge studio experimentation. Gabriel was an eager dilettante of Africa’s varied musical forms, soaking up South African film scores, Ethiopian folk music, and Senegalese drumming, often from dubbed cassettes. And like Eno and Fripp, Gabriel was not as interested in customs, habits, and beliefs, as much as he was dazzled by tones and rhythms and subject matter that, to him, expressed different emotions and alternate states of mind than European-rooted composition. Gabriel’s obsession with the bleeding edge of digital studio technologies came from the same curiosity: How can I make noises and rhythms of my own that sound completely different than anything else? He was the first UK artist to purchase a programmable CMI Fairlight synthesizer—an early sampler—which he used on Security and its in 1980 predecessor (also self-titled, and popularly called Melt after its photo-manipulated cover image) to mutate his bizarre field recordings and smear the results through his music. Security opener “The Rhythm of the Heat” is an early example of Gabriel’s studio-bound ethnographic pop experimentation. The song was inspired by psychoanalyst Carl Jung’s 1920s trip to Africa, to shed his modern European trappings and absorb the continent’s mystical power (the song’s working title was “Jung in Africa”). With similar colonialist naïvete, Gabriel wails that “the rhythm is inside me” and “the rhythm has my soul.” Unlike “Good Morning, Mr. Orwell,” there was no arch wink at the audience here—Gabriel was entirely sincere in his belief that he could technologically engineer a psychological transformation. In 1982, “Rhythm” sounded amazing, but even then, its cultural politics—Africa is where white Europeans go to find their “true” rhythmic soul—was laden with unexamined appropriation. Two years earlier, Melt’s final track evinced a different side of Gabriel’s perspective on an artist’s role in African music and politics. Though he had proven his ability to sing as an earnest rock frontman on his 1977 hit “Solsbury Hill,” there was no real rock precedent for “Biko,” the epic seven-and-a-half minute power ballad about Steven Biko, an anti-apartheid activist who died in South African police custody in 1977. Gabriel set the song to a dirge tempo rooted in South African funeral music, slipped in and out of Xhosa in the lyrics, and added a synthesized bagpipe and Fripp’s distorted guitar for good measure. Others had experimented with African rhythms and guitar textures, but Gabriel had crafted a global anthem for a fallen African freedom fighter. By 1984, Gabriel had been out of the industry’s spotlight for a couple of years, doing soundtrack work and getting his WOMAD festival—a combination of UK new wave acts and artists from around the world—off the ground. In his absence, the record business caught up to “Biko.” From late 1984 through 1985, the massive charity spectacles Band Aid, Live Aid, and “We Are the World” raised tens of millions for Ethiopian famine relief, while E Street guitarist Steven Van Zandt organized the “Sun City” project to draw attention to the horrors of South African apartheid. In the liner notes for the album—to which Gabriel contributed a song—Van Zandt summed up the well-intentioned naïvete of rock’s white elite, thanking Gabriel for the “profound inspiration of his song ‘Biko,’ which is where my journey to Africa began.” In 1986, Gabriel was invited to participate in Amnesty International’s “Conspiracy of Hope” stadium tour by Bono, who had used Live Aid’s global audience to cast himself as rock’s new messiah. For the June 1986 tour finale, Gabriel performed “Biko” to a stadium audience of 55,000 and an MTV television audience of millions more. His long-awaited fifth album, simply titled So, had been released a month earlier. So was not an explicitly political album, but Gabriel’s outsized presence in 1986 and 1987 was synonymous with what might be called rock’s NGO phase: the moment when the world’s biggest superstars convinced themselves that doing their job bigger and more seriously could actually make the world a better place. So was released in the middle of pop’s most nakedly consumerist era, when the biggest artists were as unapologetic about their ambitions for global stardom as they were devoted to speaking out on global crises. The gap between superstar and everyone else was expanding exponentially. Advances in digital recording and mastering had clarified the sound of rock records, and the 74-minute capacity of the newly released compact disc encouraged sonic sprawl. Gabriel worked on So with one of the masters of rock’s new sonic frontier, Daniel Lanois, an Eno disciple who had just produced U2’s 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire. In Gabriel’s choice of collaborators, So was a signpost for the future of the global record business. The disputed corporate genre “world music” doesn’t have a single origin point, of course, but it’s possible to hear in So’s musicians—French/Ivorian drummer Manu Katché, Senegalese vocalist Youssou N’Dour, Indian violinist L. Shankar, Brazilian percussionist Djalma Correa—a key moment when rock pivoted in its approach to the so-called “Third World,” from charity spectacle to studio collaboration. The first 20 seconds of So’s first single “Sledgehammer”—a trilling, echo-laden bamboo flute created by an E-mu Emulator II synthesizer—is just a feint before the song explodes into a sharp left turn: a ’60s soul rave-up. Gabriel’s latest revelation wasn’t rooted in geopolitics, but his own libido (“I wanna be your sledgehammer” is a classic R&B double-entendre). And though he could have easily programmed the song’s brassy trumpet hook into his synthesizer, Gabriel was an R&B aficionado who valued cultural authenticity, so he flew in Otis Redding’s 1960s sideman Wayne Jackson to play the chart. In Gabriel’s global mindset, Jackson was every bit the bearer of a distinct musical tradition as Katché. He called the duo’s participation “a commanding blend of parallel heritages.” Like art-punk turned R&B shouter David Byrne on 1978’s “Take Me to the River,” it was bracing to hear Gabriel, one of the most self-serious artists of his era, so at ease in a new idiom. For the first time in his recorded life, he actually seems to be having fun. Though it was a clear break with his earlier work, Gabriel knew exactly what he was doing. He crafted his first single in four years to fit perfectly into the era’s boomer-fueled R&B revival, a time when the radio and MTV were dominated by rejuvenated ’60s and ’70s icons Tina Turner, Kool and the Gang, the Pointer Sisters, and Lionel Richie, all of whom reinvigorated their careers with digitally gleaming updates on black pop’s golden age. In late July, “Sledgehammer” hit No.1, coronating Gabriel as a bona fide pop star. While the song stood on its own, its music video took him to a world no artist had ever entered. Over a strenuous 100-hour week in April 1986, Gabriel and a team of animators—including Stephen Johnson, who produced the Talking Heads’ “Road to Nowhere” and Aardman Animation, who would later create the claymation franchise “Wallace and Gromit”—produced the most innovative music video in the short history of the form. Eschewing cheesy digital visual effects for ostentatious stop-motion animation, claymation, and time-lapse videography, Gabriel was inserted into a series of dreamlike scenarios that occasionally mirrored the lyrics (a steam train, bumper cars, fruit), and were otherwise silly and bizarre (dancing raw chickens). “Sledgehammer” was an absolute sensation on MTV, winning 10 Video Music Awards and competing with “Thriller” in the network’s “best video of all time” countdowns. Not only was Gabriel a card-carrying member of rock’s diplomatic elite, but he was also now at the very forefront of its visual revolution. “Big Time” borrows even more directly from Byrne, powered by Tony Levin’s fretless bassline and visualized by an animated video that opens with a tuxedo-clad Gabriel awkwardly dancing in front of video static. But while Byrne’s dialogue with modern life was one of quasi-religious self-realization, “Big Time” is a cheeky, self-referential bildungsroman, connecting Reagan-era bootstrapped corporate aspirationalism to Gabriel’s own desire for musical fame. Where the rest of So reaches solemnly outward to the non-Western world, “Sledgehammer” and “Big Time” insert Gabriel into a vivid, self-contained fantasy world; a sibling to the ’50s exotica-inspired wacky utopia of Pee-Wee’s Playhouse, which also debuted in 1986. Gabriel tackled the opposite side of ballooning Western capitalism on “Don’t Give Up,” an emotional response to the growing sense of working-class British despair under the stifling austerity of the Margaret Thatcher era. Like Reagan in the U.S., Thatcher preached the gospel of free-market individual resilience in the face of the skyrocketing unemployment. While Gabriel sketches a despondent scenario about a man on the verge of losing everything, Kate Bush alights on the chorus, her empyrean voice offering sincere comfort: “Don’t give up/’Cause you have friends/Don’t give up/You’re not beaten yet.” Bush and Gabriel had collaborated before (she provided the eerie vocal counterpoint on “Games Without Frontiers”), and she had zoomed past him in his absence to the vanguard of experimental UK art-pop. Now, they held one another in a deep embrace for the length of the “Don’t Give Up” video, the perfect visualization of such a simple, compassionate sentiment, cradled by the gossamer chords of the CS-80 synthesizer. Though rooted in a very 1980s political reality, three-and-a-half decades later it is perhaps Gabriel’s most affecting song. A simple dialogue of worry countered by encouragement, delivered while spinning in full embrace: “Don’t Give Up” seems drawn from Gabriel’s established interest in fringe science approaches to performative displays of extreme emotion. He had become close with the counterculture’s favorite psychotherapist R.D. Laing and had participated in Erhard Seminars Training (EST), the cultish late-’70s self-discovery fad started by a former car salesman. In his abiding belief that music should express a profound sense of emotional compassion and catharsis, his closest peers were Tears for Fears, whose titanic 1985 LP Songs from the Big Chair was inspired by the “primal scream” work of psychologist Arthur Janov. Thanks to his deep engagement with Jung, Gabriel believed that dream interpretation was the most important key to personal emotional transformation. “I take dreams very seriously,” he told Spin in 1986. “I think everyone should.” Imagery drawn from the unconscious suffuses So from the first verse of the first song, the U2-sized “Red Rain”: “I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream/I cannot make a single sound as you scream.” Dreams are the subject of “Mercy Street,” as well, inspired by a posthumously published work by Pulitzer-winning poet Anne Sexton. Sexton started writing poetry while recovering from a breakdown, and her therapist encouraged her to pull subject matter from her dreams. Gabriel was drawn to her poem “45 Mercy Street,” where Sexton recounts wandering through a dreamscape, looking for the imaginary address through which she could access a fictional idyllic past. With misty synths muting Djalma Correa’s ululating percussion, Gabriel offers an exegesis of Sexton’s work and then expands her narrative universe, ending with the poet peacefully sailing on the ocean with her father. The heady emotional state of So was further complicated by the fact that Gabriel’s 15-year marriage was on the verge of collapse. His side-relationship with Rosanna Arquette was an open secret, and the album’s lyric sheet is rife with references to fledgling attempts at personal communication. Though “That Voice Again” has the album’s most appealing non-“Sledgehammer” chorus, it also contains the album’s most biting lyric, which could have been drawn straight from a counseling session: “I want you close I want you near/I can’t help but listen/But I don't want to hear/Hear that voice again.” In this context, the album’s inclusion of longtime concert staple “We Do What We’re Told (Milgram’s 37)”—named for the notorious psychological experiment that claimed to prove humans were innately predisposed to harm others—gains an added layer of resonance. In the years after So’s release, it was revealed that Gabriel conceived its best and most enduring song while fully enamored of Arquette. Originally titled “Sagrada Familia” in tribute to Antonio Gaudi’s Barcelona basilica and reportedly inspired by the myth of rifle heiress Sarah Winchester’s delusional construction of a maze-like mansion, Gabriel’s lyrics for “In Your Eyes” equate romantic infatuation to getting lost in a beautiful, mysteriously constructed edifice. Though now beloved as much for its climactic use in 1989’s Say Anything..., wedding dances, and senior proms, in 1986 the song signaled a new turn in rock’s engagement with African music. The track’s production is its own marvel of sonic construction, Katché’s quietly complex rhythmic syncopations meshing with Jerry Marotta’s rock-derived drumming, leading to a transfixing coda belted out by N’Dour, who translated the refrain into his native Wolof. “In Your Eyes” is the moment where Gabriel fully fuses the personal, spiritual, and global impulses in his music. “On two recent trips to Senegal,” he told Spin, “it was explained to me that many of their love songs are left ambiguous so that they could refer to the love between man and woman or the love between man and God.” But on a platinum-selling album circulating through a global, billion-dollar pop industry, the primary reference of any song is always the star, and “In Your Eyes” is, at root, about Gabriel’s global voyage of self-discovery. In 1986, N’Dour was already a living legend in his own country. A decade earlier, he was a primary force driving the creation of Mbalax, of the first truly Senegalese pop music. More recently, he’d shown his own willingness to engage in a trans-Atlantic dialogue, adapting the Spinners’ “Rubberband Man” into his own voice. But outside of West African music aficionados, N’Dour was still unknown. After So, that changed: Gabriel saw himself as not just N’Dour’s musical collaborator, but his promoter. He took N’Dour on tour with him and they collaborated several more times. There is no question that Gabriel made N’Dour a bigger star. The thornier question is what did N’Dour do for Gabriel? Was their relationship another example of pop and rock’s long legacy of colonialist absorption? An instance of music business market expansion exemplified by Gabriel starting his Virgin-distributed Real World label/studio in 1989? A simple act of earnest musical dialogue between kindred spirits? Yes. “I’m pleased to see that in most record stores…you see an African section now,” Gabriel said in 1986. “Maybe in another decade there’ll be a world-music section.” In the mid-1980s, the intertwined forces of rapidly advancing communication technologies and the ever-expanding interests of capital had ushered in the era of “globalization.” To optimists like Gabriel and his pop peers Byrne, Sting, and Paul Simon, it was the dawn of a borderless, utopian era of cultural creativity and fluid identity. To critics, world music forwarded a notion of increased cultural diversity as a garish cover for the increasing centralization of Western economic power and expansion of global economic inequality. Like any popular music form that seeks to make a political statement, world music was founded on a contradiction. It was at once a marketing category designed to sell non-Western music to Western audiences, that also, at its best, could function as a form of cross-cultural diplomacy. Gabriel fully understood his limits he was working within. “I don’t think we can change the world as directly as many people thought was once possible,” he told Spin. “What we can do is provide information and then let people make up their minds.” Gabriel’s focus on the individual’s role in global change reflected So’s twin fixations: psychological transformation and global communication. So became a blueprint for pop music do-goodery, a political statement executed through self-reflection, collaboration, and the best audio-visual experience money can buy.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Remember the Silver,Emily Yacina,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbc423f3d2500009bb0081/1:1/w_160/yacina.jpg,2020-01-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emily-yacina-remember-the-silver/,self-released,"Online, thirsty people take masochism to delightful extremes. They honk for their crushes to punch them in the face, steamroll them with a car, or batter them with a 16"" cast-iron skillet. New York singer-songwriter Emily Yacina makes this type of boiling, uneven desire sound prosaic: “Yeah I need you to swallow me,” she sings mildly over bobbing chord progressions on “Arcades & Highways,” as if rattling off a grocery list or picking lint off of a sweater. The mousy and withdrawn indie-pop on Remember the Silver, her new album, rests on this crooked pairing. On one hand, there’s a longing so all-consuming that it threatens to extinguish her; on the other, a dry and often listless delivery. The title of the album originates from a Dana Redfield book about alien abduction. Like a UFO, Yacina implies, love can disappear in an instant, but it was real; you must remember how it felt. And so, Remember the Silver dwells on these tender ache of romance, at once swooning with promises to “wait forever” and whimpering at lost intimacies. Wisps of past loves slip between her fingers: She imagines them on the beach, on 96th Street, in her bedroom. “Time is a silk web tangled in pleas/I choke to move on,” she admits over muted, scratchy guitars in “Bleachers.” But who is she straining to move on from? The sources of her anguish are as blank as paper dolls; it’s like they’re not real people, but only closed-off figments of her memory. The closest we get to specificity are gestures to “the most perfect face” or “all the little things you’d say to cheer me up.” Instead, her lyrics tend toward flat lines of monosyllabic words, vague and impressionistic notes bound up in juvenile rhyme schemes. On “Secret Drawers,” she concocts a spell to lure in her crush: “With a drop of blood, I say your name/Like I knew it would, it makes a stain.” On “Better Off,” she tackles self-delusion with fairy tale references to birds singing and prayers to the sky. Her attempts at profundity devolve into fluff: “I feel my angels stretch me soft/Whisper to myself that I’m better off.” Of course, even the most seemingly understated, opaque lines can be rescued and imbued with larger meaning. “Southern Sky” by frequent collaborator (Sandy) Alex G, on which Yacina contributes gentle vocals, spins in her same universe of swallowed-down emotional realities. The two artists share a language: dreams and skies, blues and greens. But the vivid landscape of “Southern Sky,” with its ensemble of wheezing violins, tambourines, and jaunty piano keys, makes a simple observation like “You and me/These are titles I can hardly speak” ache with nostalgia. By contrast, the emotions in Remember the Silver feel weakly brewed; the slow-moving, monotonous arrangements do little to reveal any expressive subtlety. Yacina’s papery singing rarely elevates above a murmur, often blending into the dinky and minimal instrumentation: some drums, some lightly pawed-at guitars. Occasionally, there is a sprinkle of trombone or electronic whirrs like a quickening heartbeat. But mostly, everything is rendered in the same pallid shade. Remembering that you are a young woman with real, unregulated emotions is mortifying; it can make you want to eject yourself straight into the mouth of a great white shark. As I listened, I kept searching for a sharper, more complex female subjectivity—a perspective to match Frankie Cosmos’ weird and existential wit, Sidney Gish’s offbeat self-deprecation, or Soccer Mommy’s snarling cool. I wanted a deeper sense of how slippery, heady, and frightening new love can be, at a time when young women have turned out in droves to describe that experience beautifully. There are refreshing glimpses at the mundane humiliations of having a crush on songs like “Only,” whose sly opening line—“Desexualize my soul/I want to be a piece of paper”—scans as a more composed way of saying “fuck my life.” And Yacina’s trembling moans on “96th Street,” manage to bathe the listener in a quiet grief, despite the song’s generic lyrics. But as a whole, Remember the Silver is crumbly and pale like a bouquet of dried flowers. I wish I’d been given more to remember.","The New York singer-songwriter deftly captures indie-pop longing, though her musical gestures can feel a bit lifeless.

Salt Water,Roland Tings,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e0e088cb7c76f0009ccb488/1:1/w_160/saltwater.jpg,2020-01-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roland-tings-salt-water/,Cascine,"On an international stage, contemporary Australian electronic music is most often identified with the EDM-inflected, festival-ready production of an artist like Flume, or the chill, algorithm-friendly compositions of lo-fi house, the preferred vernacular of DJs like Mall Grab and DJ Boring. Melbourne-based producer Roland Tings—real name Rohan Newman—sits somewhere in between, with a sound built for big rooms that still feels precise and considered. Though his live performances are energetic and immersive, his rhythms are more apt to nudge the body than shove it. Salt Water arrives four years after his self-titled 2015 debut, but it’s the kind of sculpted, careful record that sounds like it could have taken much longer: refreshingly untempted by current trends or timely rhythms, resolutely committed to doing its own thing. At earlier solo shows, Newman improvised drum loops on a TR-8, lending his sets an acid-house flavor that was classic without being nostalgic. Recently, after a few stateside tours with the likes of Chrome Sparks and Com Truise, he’s expanded his act, adding a live drummer and the occasional guitarist alongside his Juno 106 synthesizer. On his own time, he says he prefers listening to ambient and rock over electronic music, and the cross-genre influence is felt throughout his own work. Salt Water was recorded during a year-and-a-half period Newman spent living on Australia’s southern coast, near the Great Otway National Park. The ecological theme extends beyond song titles like “Rainforest” and “Sun Drops Behind the Hill”: The album has an organic essence, lush and alive like a rave in a foggy jungle. Each instrumental track functions as an equal member of an ecosystem. Brief stabs of acid sound like distant birds; percussive samples become a chorus line of cicadas; quietly thundering bass takes the shape of a storm cloud on the horizon. On “Rainforest,” “Up Close,” and “Circulating,” cascading voices float in and out of the mist, harmonizing with the acoustic surroundings until the exact words and their meaning is inseparable from the enclosing environment. Deeper into the album, cuts like “In a Cloud” and “Water Music” lull the listener with spacey, reverb-drenched synth lines. Newman’s work is euphoric and ecstatic without the melodrama of trance music. His songwriting begins with the overriding melody rather than an undergirding drum sequence, and he emphasizes background texture more than big drops or bass lines. For Roland Tings, ambience isn’t just what’s happening around the drums—it’s the main attraction. Just as spending time in nature is more about soaking up a feeling than seeing one thing in particular, Salt Water prizes the space between beats as much as beats themselves.","Inspired by Australia’s lush temperate rainforest, the Melbourne producer’s second album emphasizes melody and background texture more than big drops or bass lines.

juneunit,juneunit,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df3c406b72a0e0009207110/1:1/w_160/juneunit.jpg,2020-01-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juneunit-st/,Jacktone,"juneunit’s debut album is full of familiar sounds—classic hardware synthesizers, analog drum machines—but there’s something special about this record. It beckons. It has a way of lulling the senses and then prodding you awake. It follows well-trodden paths to previously undiscovered destinations. It’s music that feels alive. Not much is publicly known about juneunit. On her SoundCloud account, there are tracks in a similar vein stretching back three years; Jacktone, the Detroit label behind the record, mentions various unreleased albums on her hard drives, but this is her first official release, at least under this alias. The lack of context feels appropriate for music that refuses to give up too many of its secrets. Running nearly an hour and a half—both full sides of a C90 cassette—juneunit is surprisingly long for a debut album, but it earns its runtime. It’s not a record made for cherry-picking. The cryptic titles (“enwm,” “fdsh6”) virtually guarantee that you’ll never remember the name of any given track; they’re meant to be anonymous, to blend in with the whole. There are no jarring left turns, no moments of rupture. It’s a single, sumptuous mood suffused in tape hiss, and the success of each track is the way that it subtly fleshes out the dimensions of this seemingly limitless fogbank. Even inside this murkily lit world, juneunit finds plenty of variety.  There are jacking house rhythms, well-worn breakbeats; there are quivering acid lines and stretches of pure ambience. Sometimes her synths recall early Oneohtrix Point Never; sometimes her dense layers of filter, flanger, and chorus suggest an artist who has logged many hours listening to Seventeen Seconds, Faith, and Pornography on a loop. If the richness of the sound is the record’s immediate sell—anyone fond of the nostalgic warble of a record like Music Has the Right to Children will fall in love here—the true mark of juneunit’s artistry is her subtlety.  It takes a while to get your bearings in juneunit’s music, but the longer you listen, the more you become aware of how many different kinds of pulses there are at work, how many different tempos. “fdsh6” sustains a feeling of being perpetually about to kick off, even though it never does. “atmw” is largely static for three minutes, just a skeletal house beat firing against swirling chords, but then halfway through, something imperceptible happens and it comes to life, flush with new layers, new voices. Perhaps these moments are so satisfying because we recognize ourselves in their ruminative movements, as though they were metaphors for human potential. There’s something invigorating and inspiring about these late bloomers springing to fruition. We tend to think of ambient music as a refuge, a zone of safety, something to fall back upon. But in juneunit’s debut album, it might also be a springboard, a process of transformation—the search for self, set to tape.","The debut album from this New England-based producer blends ambient, techno, and house into a single sumptuous mood, suffused in tape hiss.

Refuge Cove,Grace Cummings,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfd0b72f3d2500009bb022c/1:1/w_160/refugecove.jpg,2020-01-03 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grace-cummings-refuge-cove/,Flightless,"Grace Cummings broke through with a Bob Dylan cover filmed in her Melbourne, Australia home, a performance so brilliant that it earned her a record deal with King Gizzard’s Flightless Records. A few well-placed props in that video provide some visual insight into what makes her debut album Refuge Cove so strange and captivating. There is, of course, a photo of Dylan himself above her right shoulder: an immense influence on her bold acoustic strumming, harmonica playing, and imagistic songwriting. There’s also a Grateful Dead record on the turntable, keying into the more cosmic places she takes those sounds. The most visible face in the video is her most unlikely source of inspiration: a Rolling Stone cover featuring the late AC/DC frontman Bon Scott, displayed prominently on her shelf. His band’s libidinous ’70s party anthems might seem miles away from her sparse psych-folk, but the two artists have more in common than just where they grew up. Like Scott, Cummings isn’t content to merely sing along to her melodies. She tears her low, surging voice to shreds, braying like she’s beckoning you from the opposite end of a crowded room. It adds an eerie, intense quality to her music—a desperation behind the calm of her arrangements. In another era, she might have fronted her own rock’n’roll warhorse. Her classic influences guide her toward an album that feels proudly out of time, and its nine songs feel like variations on one stark, psychedelic vision. Many of them are written in open tunings so that the lowest strings rattle pleasantly in the background, complementing the natural movement of her voice and words. In the opening track, “The Look You Gave,” her lyrics summon the ocean, moonlight, and wind through mountains, as her delivery, slow and ebbing, strives to create its own atmosphere. “In the Wind” closes the album at the piano, the gravel in her throat summoning the darkness in her words. The few musical accompaniments on the record feel spontaneous and half-imagined. The delicate backing vocals and fingerpicking in “Paisley” and the out-of-tune piano in “Sleep” give the sense of something captured just before the feeling was lost. Her lyrics add to this elusive quality. On the album’s shortest song, “Just Like That,” she asks for someone to join in harmony but cuts herself off before she seems to have figured out the melody. A similar sense of uncertainty carries the highlight “Sleep.” In each successive chorus, she compares herself unfavorably to a legend in a different field: artist Brett Whiteley, Big Star songwriter Chris Bell, and Meryl Streep. It might sound like self-deprecation, but Cummings casts it as a kind of affirmation. With Refuge Cove, she’s carved her own path worth following.","The Melbourne songwriter’s classic influences guide her toward an album that feels proudly out of time.

The Ground Our Sky,Saariselka,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbc5e220a40600082f6dc9/1:1/w_160/saariselka.jpg,2020-01-03 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/saariselka-the-ground-our-sky/,Temporary Residence,"From the mystic power of a sound bath to the biological comfort of a cat’s purr, humans have long recognized that sound affects the entire body. The late composer Pauline Oliveros called it deep listening: a practice in which listeners to engage with sound by surrendering to it completely. Among her students were Oakland’s Chuck Johnson and Marielle Jakobsons. Johnson issued Balsams, an ambient pedal-steel album inspired by his own deep-listening practices, in 2017; Jakobsons co-founded California instrumental duo Date Palms, whose 2013 album The Dusted Sessions was a masterwork of hazy desert psychedelia. As Saariselka, the pair create rippling soundscapes as soothing and engulfing as a warm bath. Though the duo’s stated intention for The Ground Our Sky was to encourage a return to the earth, Jakobson’s sparkly keys and Johnson’s honeyed pedal steel sound as though they’re meeting in mid-air. From shared low-end foundations, they gently peel off and curve around one another. “Horizons” opens the album on a bed of fuzzy keys and synths, gradually stretching outward as Johnson’s steel-string tendrils curl around Jakobsons’ melody. Johnson carries the beginning of “Into the Wind” with a three-note repetition that rolls with the asymmetry of an unhurried tumbleweed. Jakobsons’ voice arrives somewhere between a hum and a whisper, fluttering like a transmission from beyond. In the modern era, “frictionless” is often a euphemism for wringing humanity out of everyday interactions—an autoplay function instead of a live DJ, or an online food order instead of a phone call with a stranger. But Jakobsons and Johnson use their lithe maneuvers to build a space that feels restorative. Their compositions are without both friction and the uncanny-valley gloss that can accompany its absence. Saariselka’s most gorgeous composition is the resonant “Neochrome,” which best demonstrates how Johnson and Jakobsons mutually amplify each other’s talents. Jakobsons initiates the piece with the cool vibrance of a Rhodes keyboard, and the song builds slowly from there, overlapping layers appearing and dissolving seamlessly. Their tonal kinship sometimes makes it difficult to find where her contributions end and his begin. “Neochrome” stretches for nearly eight minutes, and yet it fades too fast. Saariselka’s entry into the canon of music geared toward deep listening is modest, barely eclipsing the 40-minute mark. But their careful pace and refusal to succumb to instant gratification is a tonic against chaos, a reminder that otherworldly idylls exist within terrestrial grasp. The Ground Our Sky encourages sensuality in the most literal sense: an awareness of one’s senses and taking deliberate pleasure in them.

Bite the Burger,Dai Burger,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbe5a7b7c76f0009ccaed1/1:1/w_160/bitetheburger.jpg,2020-01-03 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dai-burger-bite-the-burger/,First One Up,"Queens rapper Dai Burger got her start as a background dancer for rappers like Lil Mama, but since then she’s become a fixture at queer parties around Brooklyn. Her new album, Bite the Burger, continues the evolution of her lascivious sound—foul-mouthed, sex-positive lyrics over thrumming production that pulls from Baltimore club and trap. It’s raucous and it’s fun, but some of the most promising moments are the quieter ones, when Dai’s songwriting chops are given space to blossom. The biggest example here is “Miss Me,” a slow-burning ballad built around a hissing AutoTuned chant. Dai bounces between singing and rapping, delivering reassurances like “The bullshit made me who I am today” before complicating that pride with petty jabs at exes: “You should miss me, wanna kiss me.” Later on “Pics (Interlude),” a wispy and playful jam about the regret that comes with sending nudes, she issues a blithe, baby-voiced warning: “Don’t leak my shits/Cause if you do, I promise you, I’m going to leak your shits.” Her ability to both sing and rap, along with her Queens accent and the fact that women MCs are hardly ever allowed to stand on their own, is bound to bring up Nicki Minaj comparisons. But where Nicki’s lyrics are often devoted to her singular place in the spotlight, Dai’s are more illustrative of the people around her, whether it’s friends on the dancefloor or lovers in bed. “The Function,” for example, is a ’90s-style house anthem for the club’s most bold and beautiful, complete with cheesy trance synths. On “Urz,” she giddily dives into the benefits of having a down-low lover, confessing, “We be on that sneaky shit, but it’s better off that way/I just keep you on a shelf, call you down when I wanna play.” The track also stands as a showcase of Dai’s knack for describing sexual encounters in hilariously creative ways, none better than the line, “Playing with this pussy like it’s Ableton.” Dai’s sexuality has always been at the center of her work, unapologetically divulging the juicy details of past relationships and flings. She wields it like a weapon on the album single “Vitamin P,” using the chorus to clearly outline what the “P” in the title stands for: “P for pussy, P for power, P for pride and prestige,” she growls. The line could serve as a thesis statement for all of her music. But while much of Bite the Burger sizzles, there are moments that fall short, lyrics that don’t work hard enough. On the aforementioned “Miss Me,” an otherwise-stellar track kicks off with a dud when she hollowly boasts, “Couldn’t even walk a mile in my shoes, cause this shit so high you’re guaranteed to lose.” The verses on “5 Dubbz,” meanwhile, are almost endearing in their one-take quality, but start to stumble as Dai repeats herself: “You wouldn’t know love if it slapped you right in the face... You wouldn’t know love if it walked up and slapped you in your motherfucking face.” And then there are the trap-leaning songs, like “I Be Knowin” and the title track, which rely on shaky keyboard melodies and plastic drums that sound like they were ripped from a YouTube tutorial. Placed aside the high-energy club-oriented tracks, which are thrilling in their influences from a wide range of dance music, they seem small and mundane. An artist as bold and honest as Dai should never sound so boring.","The Queens rapper-singer continues to refine her joyfully lascivious, sex-positive sound, but her best moments are the quiet ones.

All in Good Time,Eddy Current Suppression Ring,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfbb9c9b095f90009ab26ee/1:1/w_160/allingoodtime.jpg,2020-01-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eddy-current-suppression-ring-all-in-good-time/,Castle Face,"Aside from an occasional one-off live set, Eddy Current Suppression Ring have been gone for eight years—a veritable lifetime in garage rock. That’s nine albums from Thee Oh Sees, a dozen by Ty Segall, and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard’s entire 15-album discography. Before they walked away for nearly a decade, the Australian quintet built a reputation with three albums and a pile of singles that balanced regimented order with rock’n’roll disarray. Their often-motorik rhythm section offered a foundation for Mikey Young’s guitar fuzz and frontman Brendan Huntley’s slovenly speak-sung lyrics. At their best, they were wild and untenable, offering up the screaming tension of “Anxiety” and the fast-paced churn of “You Let Me Be Honest With You.” They had songs impressive enough to get placed in AT&T commercials and Spoon sets. When they went away, Young kept carrying the torch, crafting some of the decade’s best post-punk with Total Control while working feverishly as a prolific studio engineer. All in Good Time is an apt title for ECSR’s unceremonious return—an acknowledgment of both their long hiatus and the patience required to appreciate this album for what it is. This is not the ECSR whose explosive guitar work defined their best album, 2008’s Primary Colours. They’re back with the same formula and aesthetic as their earlier work, but they don’t sound nearly as invigorated or inspired. The song that announced the new album, “Our Quiet Whisper,” finds the quartet in a more reflective zone. Huntley—who performs under the name Brendan Suppression—sounds disenchanted and sensitive as he sings about an inconvenient political climate where “actions speak louder than words.” The band’s overall actions, meanwhile, are unhurried. The song adopts a gradual pace, and when a guitar solo does happen, it’s low-key. That’s the overall tone of All in Good Time: staid, steady, humming along. Where they found prior success by striking the balance between organization and wildness, All in Good Time could stand to be a lot more combustible. Huntley, whose voice is historically among the band’s wildest and most energizing forces, sounds pensive on several songs. There are attempts at ratcheting up the energy, but while Huntley shouts and Young leans into distorted power chords on “Vicariously Living,” the band’s overall mid-tempo approach keeps the pace sluggish. Young’s guitar often adds weight and volume to the album, but on “Medieval Wall,” his chutzpah only reinforces the same lackluster hook instead of diversifying their approach. ECSR were always a band who excelled at building anticipation; “I Admit My Faults” was a master class in distributing Huntley’s shouts and Young’s shredding in the perfect spots here and there while otherwise letting the groove take its time. All in Good Time’s best songs are longform expressions of that same restraint. “Voices” builds quietly from silence, and as Young’s guitar varies up enough to move the song in new directions, it’s the perfect backdrop for Huntley’s nonchalant observations about writer’s block and nagging doubts. He sounds tortured when he’s asking for some quiet—the perfect sentiment on a song where Young’s well-placed licks repeatedly interrupt the album’s best groove. “Shoulders,” meanwhile, is all simmer and no boil, and as a result, it just spins in place. No riveting individual performance from any of the band’s members dives in to rescue a tepid melody that repeats again and again. When the energy and momentum drag, it’s Huntley’s reflective and empathetic lyrics that stand as the album’s greatest strength. There’s a song where he encounters Brendan Suppression from the future; he’s not offered a grim warning, but encouraged to take better care of himself. Huntley extends that care outward as well, singing on “Like a Comet” about how someone came into his life and reshaped him completely. So much of the time, Huntley’s observations are insular, which colors the album’s overall tone. But as Danny Young’s drums rev up and Huntley sings about the tremors running through him, the music becomes celebratory, and the album suddenly feels light, like it’s inches above the ground. That lightness sticks around but curdles slightly on the closing track “Modern Man.” Huntley sings about making a wish on a dandelion, and then he talks about how you shouldn’t trust your neighbor and should maybe padlock your garden hose. The band breathes life into a gradual jam by carefully picking the right spots for synthesizer stabs and guitar licks. The key to Eddy Current Suppression Ring’s most successful music is balance, and while the band struggles to recapture some of their old magic, Huntley finds that same sweet spot in his lovingly unromantic storytelling.

Fates Worse Than Death,Short Fictions,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df11550fca3b800088ab352/1:1/w_160/fatesworsethandeath.jpg,2020-01-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/short-fictions-fates-worse-than-death/,Acrobat Unstable,"In the public eye, Pittsburgh may forever be the “home of the Steelers,” the embodiment of a bygone blue-collar economy weaponized in Bruce Springsteen songs and MAGA agitprop alike. If that’s the case, its reputation hasn’t caught up to reality: It’s a meds-and-ed mecca where the gentrification rate compares to San Francisco, Denver, or Austin—fast enough that a young band like Short Fictions can look back on 2014 with nostalgia. “The kids in Oakland have such joie de vivre and it makes me sad because all I ever think about is dying and everything that I love in Pittsburgh is quickly vanishing or getting gentrified,” Sam Treber sings deep into the band’s debut full-length, Fates Worse Than Death, which, like Greta Thunberg playing a round of “This City’s Makin’-a-Comeback!” bingo, casts their hometown’s identity crisis in the harsh light of irreversible climate change. “Think globally, act locally” is Short Fictions’ ethos on a political and musical level. Fates Worse Than Death is essentially emo-revival revival, a throwback to the turn-of-the-decade moment when DIY emo became too ambitious to be confined to basements across the Keystone State. Just count them among the growing number of bands for whom Whenever, If Ever might as well be Sgt. Pepper’s. Treber’s vocals are immediately reminiscent of either of TWIABP’s leads, somehow both pointed and rubbery like a sour AirHeads candy, occasionally balanced by Alex Barkeley’s harmonies or a random scream. There are trumpets, tubas, glockenspiels, and spoken-word interludes; guitars that draw equally from college rock, post-hardcore, and band camp (not Bandcamp) emo and twee; and lyrical Easter eggs that span Pittsburgh’s cultural legacy from Mr. Rogers to Code Orange. If the familiarity of Fates Worth Than Death is the immediate draw, it also can border on a liability. “Property of Pigeons” begins with a telltale drumroll leading to an ascending twinkle riff so reminiscent of “Never Meant,” it has to be an inside joke—which would explain why they spend the rest of the song pummeling it with metallic guitar chokes and d-beat drumming. But Short Fictions evade mimicry by internalizing the most important aspect of their influences—an exploratory approach to arrangement and song structure that lends a record just shy of a half hour the conceptual heft of one twice its length. On the fantastically titled opener, “Fates Worse Than Death Pt I: I Don't Want to Wait Out the Apocalypse With Anyone But You,” Treber longs for the voice of an ex or a neighborhood that he loved just as futilely. “I’d hear it sing through apartment walls/Niagara Street, South Oakland, Pittsburgh, 2014,” he wails, before his own voice is replaced by that of an old-fashioned newscaster warning of 110-degree temperatures and “more of the same, only hotter” tomorrow. The twisty nature of Fates Worse Than Death aligns with the band’s ambivalence over whether to muster the motivation to change the present, hope for annihilation, or maybe pull a Doctor Manhattan, living forever just to look upon humanity with distant scorn. “You should only write songs about girls and your friends,” Treber mocks on “Nothingness Lies Coiled at the Heart of Being (It’s Such a Good Feeling).” The ensuing “Really Like You” does exactly that, constructing a sweet-and-sour homage to Los Campesinos! that solidifies their bid to be grandfathered into modern emo. The pop efficiency of “Really Like You” initially feels like an outlier, rather than the centerpiece that grounds Short Fictions’ apocalyptic visions. Yet sincerity carries the day. Towards the end of the album, the band yelps together, “I’m a liar and I’m a hoarder, I love every brick and mortar in this house/And we built this home together, I could live here for forever/I’ll have money when I get older and I can love again.” The fleeting optimism is countered by the song title—“Living in Places Like These Can Be Bad For Your Health (Can’t Live Here Anymore)”—but it’s still a love letter to Pittsburgh, the people in it and those getting pushed out, who can’t live here anymore but have nowhere else to go.","The Pittsburgh band’s throwback emo revivalism casts a hometown identity crisis in the harsh light of climate change.

Nibiru,Ozuna,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfa55beb7c76f0009ccadef/1:1/w_160/nibiru.jpg,2019-12-31 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ozuna-nibiru/,Sony Music Latin,"When you’re the biggest star on the internet, is there anywhere to go but down? Such was Ozuna’s dilemma as he headed into 2019. His first two LPs (2017’s Odisea and 2018’s Aura) sold more than half a million units each, and he had just been crowned YouTube’s most-viewed artist of 2018, featuring in four of the platform’s top 10 most-streamed videos of the year. He teased his third LP, Nibiru, three months after Aura’s release, and the excitement was palpable. But things didn’t exactly play out as planned. Behind the scenes, the 27-year-old Dominican-Puerto Rican was being extorted over an “intimate” video from his teen years, which ended with his extortionist’s murder (Ozuna was never a suspect). He was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Song, but lost out to an artist who isn’t even Latin. And after two years of releasing an album each August, he was still working on Aura’s followup through the fall. By the time Nibiru was released at the end of November, expectations had reached a fever pitch that would prove almost impossible to meet. Nibiru is a self-described urbano record—that umbrella term that encompasses the reggaetón, trap, and R&B currently dominating the Spanish-language pop charts. Reggaetón is made for the dancefloor, fueled by a classic, irresistible riddim. And Latin trap can trace its roots back to Atlanta’s strip clubs, with basslines that ooze sex and sleaze. Ozuna typically occupies the space in between, a romantic reggaetonero who softens the edges of the traperos he often collaborates with. Tracks like “Se Preparó” and “Síguelo Bailando,” from his debut LP, crystallize this notion, conjuring a suave and sophisticated aesthetic imbued with both confidence and vulnerability. Nibiru extends him beyond this comfort zone, and in the process, loses some of what made him unique. Named for a fictional planet where Ozuna makes his music before bringing it back down to earth, the LP hints at the scope of his ambition: He’s been beyond the clouds, searching for new territory after so thoroughly and quickly conquering YouTube. There are glimpses of that otherworldly talent on Nibiru. His agile flow en español shines on “Yo Tengo una Gata,” a kush-cloud duet with Panamanian reggaetonero Sech, with a simple synth melody that yowls with heartache. And “Baila Baila Baila” may be almost a year old, but it has endured as one of the biggest dance tracks of the year and reveals Ozuna’s mastery at writing hooks. Much of the rest of Nibiru suffers from an identity crisis, and most of its hip-hop collaborations feel like regressions. “Eres Top,” which revisits Diddy’s early-aughts hit “I Need a Girl Part 2,” feels hollow, like DJ Snake slapped the reggaetón riddim on top of the original and called it a day. And “Patek” wastes some of the album’s strongest production on a tired post-Future trope of soothing heartache with expensive cars and watches, and features one of Snoop Dogg’s wackest verses of the decade, a category with intense competition. The Swae Lee-featuring “Sin Pensar” is a notable exception; Ozuna naturally assimilates into the Rae Sremmurd hook wizard’s MIDI-toned future pop&B, and their Auto-Tuned harmonies sound as natural as anything robotic ever could. Ozuna’s growing pains were likely inevitable. It is entirely possible that the pressure to constantly churn out music led to some of Nibiru’s missteps. That this record could be considered “late,” coming just 15 months after 2018’s Aura, is evidence of the outsized expectations for a contemporary urbano star. Not exactly a triumphant return, the inconsistent Nibiru contains some of his best and worst work. It’s a record made by a massive talent who’s not quite sure what to do next. That it disappoints has as much to do with the promise of its creator as it does the quality of its contents.","The urbano star’s third album pushes him beyond his comfort zone as a romantic reggaetonero—and abandons some of the qualities that once made him unique.

After Dark,Forest Management,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dfa4e87f3d2500009bafed4/1:1/w_160/afterdark.jpg,2019-12-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/forest-management-after-dark/,American Dreams,"Though John Daniel’s music rarely sounds unfinished, you could call it a work in progress. Over the past eight years, the Ohio-born, Chicago-based artist has appeared on over 50 releases under the name Forest Management, creating ambient sounds and droning textures that constantly move forward. Daniel’s advancements sometimes take the form of big, dramatic arcs, but more often they come in small steps, carefully thought out and patiently executed. There’s almost nothing but small steps on After Dark, a double album of short, focused pieces whose shifts are so subtle they can be hard to catch at first. No two tracks are very different from each other in the way they develop or even in the way they sound. Daniel avoids obvious, sweeping moves, instead offering simple loops whose evolutions require close attention. The cumulative effect can feel subconscious: you know you’ve gone somewhere by the end of a given track without being sure exactly how you got there. The simplicity of After Dark is due in part to Daniel’s self-imposed limits. Every sound came from one source: a used vinyl copy of French composer Claude Debussy’s 1905 orchestral work La Mer (French for “The Sea”). Daniel recorded both sides on his computer—which caught both the music and the pops and hisses from the aging wax—then applied edits and effects to gradually carve out songs. Latching onto short figures that he could loop, Daniel crafted impressionistic pieces more about mood than structure. He explains, “I was drawn to how Debussy chose feeling over thinking in music—an almost avant-garde thought at the time.” Daniel was also drawn to Debussy’s fascination with the sea. After Dark has a watery ebb and flow: Some tracks feel caught up in the waves of previous songs, while others undercut them and start new ripples in the process. Initial forays like the sandy opener “Seventh Time’s a Charm” and the oscillating “A Smell So Sweet” feature tactile sounds in sharp focus, but that clarity melts in the murkier pools of the howling, cavernous “Magnolia” and the dark drift of “Fake Rose and 24 Karat.” Later, “The Grand Lobby” evokes a church organ on the ocean’s floor, but it seems to return to a sunny surface in the busy, rhythmic “Walk Along Broadway.” As he navigates these movements, Daniel embeds each track with textures that are easy to get lost in. In fact, tracing the patterns that run through After Dark sells Daniel’s work a bit short. Whatever shapes you might hear in the album’s sequencing, each track remains a self-contained statement, filled with complex layers and purposeful motion. On that scale, this is the most accomplished Forest Management album so far. Daniel has found a spot between ambient, drone, and noise to call his own, fusing the qualities of all three without diluting any of them. It still sounds like he’s on the move, probing for ideas, and on After Dark, his patient advancements add up to a big step forward.","Sampling a worn vinyl copy of Debussy’s La Mer, the Chicago musician creates short, impressionistic pieces that fuse ambient, drone, and noise; they’re easy to get lost in.

Year One Demos,American Football,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df13211b91d230008bf35bd/1:1/w_160/demos.jpg,2019-12-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/american-football-year-one-demos/,Polyvinyl,"While digging through old belongings, American Football drummer Steve Lamos came across a 1/4"" master tape swaddled in brown paper. The tape—still wrapped neatly around a clear plastic reel—was recorded in his childhood basement back in May of 1997, barely four months after American Football formed. His father “engineered” the session by plopping two vocal microphones in the band’s general direction, adjusting the levels, and pressing record. Only four songs were marked on the tracklist: one from their 1998 self-titled EP, two from their 1999 self-titled full-length, and one mystery track, “Song #1/Song #2 (Demo),” whose lack of an identifier left Lamos stumped. When he gave the tape a listen, he didn’t recognize the first section of the two-part track. Neither did guitarist Steve Holmes or singer-guitarist Mike Kinsella. Was this a forgotten American Football song? As a band whose discography is painstakingly archived by fans, the decision American Football should make was obvious: release the tapes. But those with eagle eyes know the demos are already within reach; CD and cassette versions of this same audio allegedly surfaced on eBay two years ago, were bought, and promptly uploaded online. In those versions, the sound quality is crunchy and muddled — likely the result of audio being re-recorded from one medium to another. Cleaned up and newly mastered, the Year One Demos versions are bright and captivating, a rare look at American Football’s sketchbook before the drawing was colored in. The one thing demos succeed at where finished recordings fail is their ability to convey the warmth of an idea’s spark. Year One Demos digs up the very roots of American Football’s linear songwriting. These demos feature no singing or lyrics at any point — unsurprising, given American Football was conceived as an instrumental band. Enamored with Music for 18 Musicians and In a Silent Way, they built sprawling guitar patterns that interlocked on “Five Silent Miles,” repeating in cyclical motions until the smallest modal movement felt like a major chord resolution. Here, “The Summer Ends” creates space to get lost in its own thoughts without the defining trumpet part from the studio album version. Without debate, the prized gem of Year One Demos is “Song #1 / Song #2 (Demo).” Like American Football’s biggest hit, it begins with a faraway count-off. Hesitant guitars chatter back and forth while Lamos taps patiently on a hi-hat. Soon, the guitars find their comfort zone, pick up the pace, and get consumed by the muted roar of an electronic bow that spits them out into open-ended math rock inspired by Weather Report’s 1971 self-titled debut. What follows is better known as “Untitled #2,” from the deluxe reissue of their debut album. Over the songs’ combined runtime of nearly seven minutes, American Football churn through a seven-part instrumental that’s more complex and melodically surprising than some of their official music. Unfortunately, they cut the song from their proper recording sessions to keep their tracklist diverse — “The One With the Tambourine” already used the EBow effect and it had space for lyrics. “This recording represents our first attempt at a proper demo,” writes Holmes in the liner notes for Year One Demos. “We played through each song live once or twice in one afternoon and called it quits.” Perhaps that’s why the occasional flubs are noticeable: a flat trumpet note, a missed guitar hammer-on, an extra bass drum kick. No matter how cultivated the songs were from inception, Year One Demos is still a photograph of a band about to grow into themselves. Unlike a traditional demo where missed notes and delayed downbeats point towards inexperience, though, American Football’s occasional errors sound like a student jotting down a complex equation before they forget it and discovering the answer in the process. The finished product is correct even if the handwriting got smudged along the way.

Automatic Writing / Improvement (Don Leaves Linda),Robert Ashley,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df90a10f3d2500009bafe3a/1:1/w_160/automaticwriting.jpg,2019-12-27 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/robert-ashley-automatic-writing-improvement-don-leaves-linda/,Lovely Music,"“Say what you mean and mean what you say” is sage yet impractical advice. Societal conventions often throw a spanner in the works of meaningful communication. These fragmented thoughts swam into focus while listening to the late American composer Robert Ashley’s 1979 album Automatic Writing and 1985 opera Improvement (Don Leaves Linda) in circling sequence. The two works were recently reissued together, the former marking its 40th anniversary and the latter documenting a 2019 production of the opera at legendary New York performance space the Kitchen. While aesthetically poles apart, they make for a complementary pairing, because they illuminate Ashley’s interest in the interplay of speech and convention from opposite directions. On Automatic Writing, which comprises one 46-minute piece, Ashley repeats the line, “My mind is censoring my own mind,” or a slight variation of it, a dozen times. The composition is based on a recording of the composer’s involuntary speech, a symptom he attributed to a possible “mild form of Tourette’s.” “It is against the ‘law’ of our society to engage in involuntary speech,” he wrote in the liner notes of a 1996 reissue of the record. “That’s why we are embarrassed to talk to ourselves. That’s why Tourette had to leave the room.” Ashley came to record himself because he’d noticed repetitions in the phrases he muttered and wondered how these unconscious patterns related to his work as a composer. Could he find music within the mysterious workings of his own body? In his searching, Ashley distorted his voice to the point of granular gesture on Automatic Writing. (Save for a few moments of clarity, it is only possible to understand what he says by reading the transcription that accompanies the release.) In a rare example of an echo being more legible than its origin, the emotional resonance of his mouth sounds is underscored by a whispered French translation of his involuntary speech performed by long-time collaborator Mimi Johnson. The faraway melody of an organ and the murmurings of a Polymoog, the latter evoking a crate of old-fashioned milk bottles jiggling against each other in transit, hold the space for the two voices. Layered together, these four sonic elements—or characters in an opera, as Ashley saw them—have a proto-ASMR quality, textural and sensual. Where Automatic Writing puts Ashley’s own (involuntary) language under the microscope, Improvement (Don Leaves Linda) takes a widescreen view of the ways in which societal conventions can inhibit communication. On the page, it’s a hugely ambitious project: a domestic narrative (Linda is abandoned by her husband Don and has to make a new life for herself) laid atop a historical one (in 1492, the Jewish population of Spain was forced into exile by the country’s Catholic leaders). Yet instead of sweeping dramatic scenes, the story unfolds through social transactions that range from the awkward to the absurd, the kind that consumer society runs on: an encounter with a busybody family that gives Linda a lift to the airport after she finds herself abandoned (“Good luck trying to/Use your ticket. We would help you/If we could, but probably/It would only make things worse”); an exchange at an airline ticket counter (“Where were you when your husband left?”/“I was in the toilet at the turnoff”); a conversation with a doctor Linda met at a party in which she tells him about the dream she had the night before, which goes about as well as anyone who has ever tried to tell a stranger their dream. (“I’m sorry. What I meant that last night I dreamed as/I ordinarily do, and I wanted you to know that the dream/Was a common one for me, which I thought you could/Not know unless I told you.” “Just a moment, please.”) It’s not just what the characters say but the way that they say it that tickles the senses. And they do say it, rather than outright sing it, often delivering lines—solo and in unison—at a thrilling sing-song pace, in clear-as-a-bell tones. “The essence of my music,” Ashley explained in a 2003 interview with The Wire, “is that the syllables go by as fast as they do in the American English language and the pitch stresses, which make one syllable more important than the other syllable, are all within a range of half an octave. It's like you squeeze it in one direction and expand it in another direction.” What connects these two works is the malleability of language and the way the sound of it conveys as much as the substance. The line that Robert Ashley repeats on Automatic Writing has resonance for both: “My mind is censoring my own mind.” These seven words that sprang unfiltered from his interior world gesture to the way that self-awareness obstructs expression as much as they do the freedom that can come from breaking with societal convention. It’s this gift that the avant-garde opera pioneer left today’s artists: the precedent to take the form in whichever direction satisfies the senses.

Duster,Duster,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df3c1702c11650008c38b2e/1:1/w_160/duster.jpg,2019-12-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duster-duster/,Muddguts,"For the better part of two decades, Duster’s small catalog was handed down like a myth. From one smoky dorm room to another, one road-worn Econoline van to the next, their records spread primarily through passionate word of mouth. Their insider status suited their songs, which they’ve since termed “experimental depressed music”—it’s never been the sort of stuff that naturally generates headlines. Nearly every word on those early records is sung in a grave whisper, so their followers responded in kind, keeping the music like a secret. Listening back, the music that Clay Parton, Canaan Dove Amber, and Jason Albertini made together is diffuse, without much pretense or expectation. Even 2000’s Contemporary Movement, the last album of the band’s initial run and easily their most accessible, feels beautifully haphazard and exploratory. Like many of their labelmates on Up Records at the time—including Quasi, Built to Spill, and Modest Mouse—they found magic in a free-associative take on indie rock, playing their songs as if remembering them from dreams. And then they receded into the shadows for almost 20 years. The story, as it’s most often told, suggests that the band more or less vanished while their legend grew. But during their ostensible hiatus, the members of Duster continued making music both together and separately. Albertini’s Helvetia carried on the slow, sad spirit of Duster’s best songs, often accompanied by Amber. Parton’s Static Cult label released some of those records, while Parton continued making similarly distraught solo music music as Eiafuawn. So while it’s tempting to view Duster’s recent activity—touring, a Numero Group box set, and now a new album—as a reemergence, the band sees it as a continuation. They just kind of spaced out for a little while. True to their word, their new, self-titled album bears all the hallmarks of classic Duster records: plodding drums, skeletal basslines, and guitar work that sparkles in the darkness like dew on a cobweb. The songs hiss menacingly in the unpredictable way that their early tape recordings did, as if their four-track had begun to resent them for all the feedback and bummer vibes. They recorded this album live in Parton’s garage, which no doubt supplies some of the songs’ chilly precarity. Per Parton, the only difference now that they’re older is that they buy blank cassettes on eBay rather than “steal[ing] them from the drugstore.” Even at their clearest, the lyrics on Duster’s older records tended to get clouded out by tape fuzz and static. And yet, you could always tell that, whatever they were singing about, things weren’t going well. Parton has described the overall tone as “purring distress,” a sensation that’s more legible on the new album. “I’m Lost” consists of the dreary refrain “Don’t you know I’m lost?” over an appropriately circuitous guitar riff that feels like getting caught in a thought loop. On “Summer War,” Duster sing explicitly of the apocalypse, of how the “end is coming to take us home.” One of the most surprising moments is “Go Back,” on which the band builds soaring melodies out of ultra-minimal guitar leads, feedback, and static as they sing about lost innocence and a fall from the garden. Like something the Jesus and Mary Chain might pray in a particularly dissociative state, it’s desperate, weightless, and impossibly sad. In an interview with Vice last year, Parton explained that changing times have only underscored longstanding Duster philosophy. “We didn’t feel like we belonged in this world before,” he said. “And the world is only an even bleaker hellscape now.” Duster holds a mirror to that world, offering existentially troubled lyrics over droney, drawn-out instrumentals. It’s of a piece with the music they’ve always released, but there’s something hopeful in that. Even if you wake up one day 20 years from now and don’t recognize the hellish world around you, you can still press on the way you always have, with your friends at your side.

This is the promise of the remix—fluidity. Turn a good song upside down or inside out, and you’ll discover something new every time. Ghanaian duo Jowaa demonstrate as much with their remix of Fever Ray’s “To the Moon and Back”: Working off the original’s squiggly background sounds, their anime-like “Ay ay ay ay” provides an irresistible lead vocal in the first half of the remix. The track is a highlight of Plunge Remix, a new collection of previously released and brand new remixes of songs from Plunge, Fever Ray’s 2017 album about swerving conformity and finding new ways to express one’s sexuality. In the Ghanaian language Ga, jo waa means something like dance hard—a message celebrated in queer communities the world over. To dance is to not stagnate. For a while in the late 2000s and early ’10s, remixes were almost like a form of payola for mp3 bloggers, who required an endless stream of tracks to give away to readers. Multiple remixes could generate multiple posts and help stoke buzz. While Plunge Remix will serve to remind you of Plunge, that’s not what drives it. Instead, the collection nudges the remix closer to its dancehall and disco origins; each version is in conversation with the club scene that the remixer knows best. From Lisbon’s DJ Marfox to NYC’s NAR, the producers selected to recontextualize Plunge span the globe, opening the possibility for the album’s invigorating depictions of sex and desire to reach dancefloors far and wide. As Fever Ray’s Karin Dreijer noted in a 2017 interview, “There’s a lot of fucking on the album—fuck, fuck, fuck the whole time!—but it’s important because the ways of fucking that don’t make up heterosexual sex are super-stigmatised.” If you have a little imagination, there are infinite ways of sharing intimacy. As if to nod in that direction, Plunge Remix features not one but five reworks of the cocoon-cracking “Mustn’t Hurry” (co-produced by Paula Temple, who remixes another track here). Swedish artist Tami T disregards the title and nearly triples the pace, bringing the beat to a gallop. STAYCORE collective member Dinamarca respects the bpm but shifts the perspective to widescreen. N.A.A.F.I’s Lao employs echo and acoustic percussion to delectable effect, while Shanghai producer Tzusing’s grinding version includes an existential roar. Completing the quintet, Aasthma (the duo of Pär Grindvik and frequent Fever Ray collaborator Peder Mannerfelt) turns in a dusty rave take. In total, the digital version of Plunge Remix features 21 remixes by 18 producers (three pull a double shift, including Dreijer themself). Between them, they explore seven tracks from Plunge, plus “I’m Not Done,” a holdover from 2009’s Fever Ray that enjoyed a new life on the Plunge tour. On paper, the repetitions stack up, but listening to the compilation somehow never feels that way. With its circling lyrical motifs and wide spread of tempos and textures, Plunge Remix comes off as the type of mixtape you could put on at a house party to inspire both limb-shaking and love-making. Björk’s industrial interpretation of “This Country” skews furthest from simple pleasure—its abrasive metallic tones are an articulation of the song’s central lyric (“this country makes it hard to fuck”)—but hold out for Johannesburg duo FAKA, who add vocals to the instrumental “Plunge” and turn it into a sacred slow jam. Being a good remixer requires being a good listener: to take a song somewhere new, you have to know where it’s coming from. What makes Plunge Remix such an enjoyable listen is how warmly each remixer embraces the original’s hungry and curious spirit. One might almost wonder which really came first, Plunge or Plunge Remix? Of course, Plunge Remix was the response—but the nighttime spaces it inhabits, the world it lives and breathes and fucks in, is where Plunge was born in the first place.

Free Nationals,The Free Nationals,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df91372b095f90009ab25b5/1:1/w_160/freenationals.jpeg,2019-12-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-free-nationals-free-nationals/,EMPIREOBE,"In less than a year, the Free Nationals went from playing weddings to performing on “Ellen,” opening for Beyoncé, and amping up Coachella crowds. As Anderson .Paak’s live band, they’ve been fundamental in establishing his retro sound. (As influences, they cite Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, and Erykah Badu.) Now, after nearly two years of pump-faking, the band—comprised of guitarist Jose Rios, keyboardist Ron “T.Nava” Avant, bassist Kelsey Gonzales, and drummer Callum Connor— has set off on its own with a 40-minute self-titled debut. Rios has compared their new feature-heavy album to Santana’s 1999 smash hit Supernatural, and while Free Nationals isn’t as universally appealing, it shares that album’s same problems: namely, a lack of cohesion and direction. The members of the band consider themselves “indigenous to the funk,” and they’ve gotten pretty good at  mimicking the pure sound of their chosen era: They ran the album’s music through a cassette machine to add the warmth and distortion of analog compression, hoping to bake nostalgia directly into their songs. While they are all skilled players with a clear familiarity with classic grooves, their music is hampered by a lack of imagination. “I think this is the record AP [Anderson .Paak] wanted to make, but didn’t, after Malibu,” Rios told High Snobiety. But the Free Nationals debut isn’t even in the same stratosphere as .Paak’s breakthrough. The rangy soul of that album came from his distinctive storytelling and point of view, not to mention his raspy voice. Free Nationals just feels like a second-rate compilation of soul covers, a jukebox musical without a plot. Occasionally, one of their guests catches a spark.  T.I. sounds revitalized over the funk-rock riffs of “Cut Met a Break,” boosting his own legend as trap pioneer: “Number one, running up the millions/Show you how to flip a brick and buy a building.” “Oslo” adds a touch of Vocoder to what could pass for a Doobie Brothers song rewritten for Roger Troutman. Anderson .Paak makes a single appearance on the butter-smooth “Gidget,” turning an in-studio phone squabble between Rios and an ex into a story of forgotten love; it is the one song on which they feel whole. There are plenty of collaborations here that make sense on paper, but Free Nationals doesn’t always know how to integrate the talents of its guests. Daniel Caesar (“Beauty & Essex”), Syd (“Shibuya”), Kali Uchis, and the late Mac Miller (“Time”) have all produced at least one R&B-focused opus in the last few years: the gospel-tinged Freudian, the seamlessly soulful Hive Mind, the genre-bending Isolation, or the funky Divine Feminine, respectively. But this album never manages to do more than use them as pegs on its mood board. There are isolated moments here and there, but even when when they strike an appealing note or two, the Free Nationals never come across as more than a backing band missing its leader.","The funky retro-soul band aims to set itself apart from leader Anderson .Paak on a solo debut packed with guests, including Syd, Kali Uchi, and the late Mac Miller.

Tapestry,Carole King,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df90fbc1dc57a00089529be/1:1/w_160/caroleking.jpg,2019-12-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carole-king-tapestry/,OdeA&M,"Carole King was a 15-year-old pianist in a poodle skirt when she first took the elevator up to the Manhattan office of a record label with her stack of sheet music and her Big Apple tenacity, and asked to audition her songs. It was 1957. As a Brooklyn teenager, the daughter of a piano teacher and firefighter who separated when she was young, King had a front-row seat to the genesis of rock’n’roll. She wondered if she could be a part of it. Too smart to then be considered cool, too determined to care, King would sign her first contract with ABC-Paramount that same year. She was a married mother of two by the age of 20, living in suburban New Jersey with her husband and lyricist, Gerry Goffin, a brooding intellectual who she met at Queens College and ushered into music. As they co-wrote singles for stars to sing into the stratosphere—Little Eva’s “The Loco-Motion,” the Shirelles’ “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” and Aretha Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” among them—King’s own life was a source of perspective. She and Goffin worked in a cubicle with an upright piano and an overflowing ashtray at the publishing company Aldon Music, a veritable pop factory across from the Brill Building. King spiked their A.M. mini-masterpieces with the R&B melodies of her youth and brightened them with the grandeur of her beloved Rodgers and Hammerstein. Many were composed in single nights while her children were asleep. If that’s all she ever did, she would still have been a legend. It was those pop standards that led John Lennon to remark that, when he and Paul McCartney first got together, they wanted to be “the Goffin-King of England.” It was those songs that were given to Randy Newman in demo form as examples of perfect writing (he has called King his hero), and that made James Taylor too nervous to speak to her on the night they met. But it was only a first act. Tapestry was King’s second album as a bandleader, primary songwriter, unvarnished singer, and tentative recording artist—an American master of melody whose introspection became a phenomenon. At 29, she had been in the music industry for over a decade, outlasting the sea change away from bubblegum music and towards the singer-songwriter. She was skeptical of stardom. (“I didn’t think of myself as a singer,” King has said, and having written for Aretha, who could blame her?) She had also divorced her lyricist. Gathering her daughters, Louise and Sherry, and her cat, Telemachus, King moved cross-country to the Hollywood Hills, where she undertook the time-honored pop-music tradition of self-reinvention by way of self-discovery. In time, she grew spiritual, becoming a follower of the artistically beloved Swami Satchidananda. Crucially, she finally began to write her own lyrics in earnest, penning more than half the songs, and all of the peaks, of Tapestry alone. King’s lyrics are a testament to the potential of the simplest phrases when heightened by an uncluttered arrangement and an unfettered truth, the definition of classic. “You’re beautiful,” “you’ve got a friend,” “you’re so far away”—her words are conversational, economic, and nearly telepathic, as if reading our collective mind. In songs that mix girl-group longing, Broadway balladeering, blues, soul, and wonder, Tapestry used the room itself as an instrument. The producer, King’s longtime publisher Lou Adler, wanted it to sound like the understated and sought-after demos she recorded when writing for other artists, with the tactile intimacy of a woman at the piano singing straight to you. The result was precise but not overly manicured. Owing to her newfound spirituality, there is a sweet serenity to Tapestry. Here was a ’50s rock’n’roller from Brooklyn having journeyed through the ’60s to become a ’70s lady of the Canyon, making music that seemed to elude time completely. Among an ever-present array of incense and candles, King recorded Tapestry at A&M Studios in Hollywood, in Studio B. The Carpenters were in Studio A—they would record King’s “It’s Going to Take Some Time” the following year—and in Studio C, Joni Mitchell was working on her confessional masterpiece, Blue. King’s band would sneak into Mitchell’s studio when she wasn’t around (better piano in there), and Mitchell would come by to sing backing vocals, alongside James Taylor, on the Tapestry recordings of “You’ve Got a Friend” and “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” According to Sheila Weller’s chronicle of the era, Girls Like Us, Mitchell had been known to call “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” her favorite song of all time. The songs of Tapestry are like companions for navigating the doubts and disappointments of everyday life with dignity. Having composed hundreds of singles for others, King knew what they needed: raw feeling, careful phrasings, a little sparkle. She lets her voice break to show that it’s alive. The soulful “It’s Too Late”—co-written with Toni Stern, a then-unknown lyricist who King called “a quintessential California girl”—feels like a grown-up girl-group anthem, wherein the best part of breaking up is, it turns out, clarity. The gospel-tinged backing vocals of “Way Over Yonder,” sung by Merry Clayton, charge its calm with resilience, dreaming of “true peace of mind” and “a garden of wisdom.” By 1971, King was not only practicing yoga but teaching it at the Integral Yoga Institute, and an attendant sense of collectedness carries Tapestry. The Broadway-ready “Beautiful,” which came to King while riding the subway, is a loving-kindness meditation banged out to a Gershwin-like orchestra of piano chords: an appeal to the world to choose a positive outlook, to put forth what you’d like to receive. As King applied her Brill Building-era chops to newfound bohemianism, perhaps it was a harder East Coast mentality that kept her lyrics concrete and her sound percussive. The jaunty Tapestry opener “I Feel the Earth Move” is both a testament to King’s groundedness and her emotional attunement. Inspired in part by the Ernest Hemingway novel For Whom the Bell Tolls—the characters make love in a forest and feel “the earth move out and away from under them”—she wrote the song early in ’71. On her birthday, February 9, the catastrophic San Fernando earthquake occurred. “I feel the earth move under my feet/I feel the sky tumblin’ down,” King sings with bluesy swagger, channeling the tectonic power of infatuation. Before Tapestry, King formed a folk-rock band called the City in her Laurel Canyon living room with two fellow New York transplants, Danny Kortchmar and Charles Larkey (who would become her second husband). They released one fantastic album, 1968’s Now That Everything’s Been Said; the title track, co-written with Stern, is an exquisite gem of a kiss-off. Somewhat astonishingly, Kortchmar and Larkey were former members of the Fugs: the East Village beat-punk antagonists whose anti-professionalism was more or less a total inversion of what you might think of when you think of Carole King. But in her memoir, King writes that her new collaborators pushed each other to “sing beyond what they believed was the edge of their ability.” You can hear that in how King often maxes out her limited alto range, reaching for something just beyond her. She called her own music “soft rock,” but the brink of her singing sounds deliberately loud. Through the lovely melody of “Home Again,” King’s lyric captures the precise feeling of trying to be present when it’s impossible: “Snow is cold/Rain is wet/Chills my soul to the marrow/I won’t be happy till I see you alone again.” King’s voice presses against the lyric—“marrow”—with evermore volume, vigor, and makes it ecstatically real: the furthest place the note can go. King so often wrote songs for others. At the time, she was touring in James Taylor’s band; she’d played piano on the sensitive, illuminated ballads of 1970’s Sweet Baby James. And though Tapestry’s peaks—“So Far Away” and “You’ve Got a Friend”—weren’t technically written for Taylor, she said she penned them with his sunstruck sound in mind. “So Far Away” came to her on the road while missing her then-husband, ex-Fug Charles Larkey. It is the record’s sparest song, a marvel that seems composed to make your heart race: the feelings of loneliness, transience, and long-distance yearning (life on tour, that is) are present in every cascading chord. “So far away/Doesn’t anybody stay in one place anymore?” King sings, each syllable a surface of inquiry. The borderlessness of King’s composition makes this liminal state feel infinite—as if bittersweet were itself a key. There are few promises in the history of pop music as generous or exalted as “You’ve Got a Friend.” “Ain’t it good to know that you’ve got a friend/When people can be so cold?” King sings, giving gravity to every note, as if to ask: What could matter more? It’s a song that seems to stare at you, no matter who you are, and affirm pop’s most profound capacity: to simply be reached. “You’ve Got a Friend” became a No. 1 hit for Taylor when he recorded his more genial version for his own 1971 record, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon, on which King played. (She often said she felt they were recording one continuous album, sharing many musicians.) Taylor had long been inspired by King, and later, it was he who encouraged King to sing her own songs. It makes “You’ve Got a Friend” an exquisite ode to friendship, interconnectedness, and mutual inspiration. King’s superior take amplifies its hope almost to a shout. King also recorded two of her and Goffin’s standards for Tapestry—“Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” and “Natural Woman”—and while you couldn’t quite call her versions definitive, they carry the bespoke power of a woman reckoning with her history in song. For one, they were the bookends to her musical-marital partnership. “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” was her and Goffin’s first hit, for the Shirelles, the tune that made them full-time writers after Goffin finally quit his day job as a chemist. “Natural Woman” was their last before divorcing. In musical second acts, many artists attempt to split with their former selves entirely. But King had a past she could own. She was 19 when “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” first came out; she wrote the music, arranged the strings using a book on orchestration borrowed from the public library, and played piano on the recording. The lyric was a kind of response to the Shirelles’ previous hit, “Tonight’s the Night,” but turned “sideways and upside down,” King has said. For 1960, it was rather radical: the voice of a clear-eyed young woman accepting the possibility of a one-night stand—“Can I believe the magic in your sighs?”—despite her longing for true love, resigned but not fooled. It became the first No. 1 hit of the girl group era. King and Goffin were so proud of the song that they engineered the doorbell of their home in suburban New Jersey to play its lovelorn hook every time a visitor arrived. But perhaps it was a cautionary tale for their own doomed marriage. On Tapestry, “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” was a raw emblem of King’s own complex teenage years, and she sang it in careful measures, as if savoring the memory in each note. King and Goffin wrote their monumental Aretha single after Atlantic exec Jerry Wexler pulled up to them while walking on Broadway, rolled down the window of his limo, and asked them to craft a hit for her with the title “Natural Woman.” They drove home to New Jersey, listened to R&B and gospel on the Black-programmed WNJR, and poured out a piece of history: “When my soul was in the lost and found/You came along to claim it.” Of course King’s “Natural Woman” does not summon the heavens with the same earth-shattering force as the Queen of Soul’s version, released in 1967. When King performed it live on tour with Taylor three years later, she would ask the audience to please imagine it as it once was—a demo for Aretha, and part of her life story. But the grasping of King’s “you make me”s and the fluttering of her “feel”s are charged with the force of a person attempting to turn herself inside out. In the voice of Aretha, “Natural Woman” is glory. In the voice of King, it is, like all of Tapestry, an act of pure conviction. Though barely promoted by King herself, Tapestry spent 15 weeks as the No. 1 album in the U.S. upon its release, and stayed on the charts for five years. King won four Grammys for Tapestry in 1972, more than anyone had ever received at once, and it was the first time that the New York award ceremony was broadcast live on television. But King didn’t attend to collect the awards herself. She chose to remain in California with her newborn third child, Molly, instead. It’s telling: There’s an unmistakable maternal energy to Tapestry. Throughout King’s career, she has recalled moments when her responsibilities merged, in which she’d have her baby in the playpen at the studio or be breastfeeding in between takes. Toni Stern has said that, while writing for Tapestry, King would be “playing the bass with her left hand and diapering a baby with her right.” King herself said that having kids kept her “grounded in reality,” which is audible in every loosely calibrated note of Tapestry. Her next artistic achievement was a collection of children’s music, 1975’s Really Rosie, in collaboration with author Maurice Sendak. A reworking of “Where You Lead”—rewritten, King has said, to sound less submissive—became the theme song to the mother-daughter sitcom “Gilmore Girls,” sung by King and her daughter Louise. I was a teenager myself when my own mom—noticing my tendency to remain locked in my bedroom with Mitchell and Bob Dylan on an endless loop—gave me her CD copy of Tapestry. I have to admit, at 17, I didn’t get it. Maybe “I Feel the Earth Move” sounded too conventional to my angsty and emotionally blown-out high school tastes, which is too bad. I’d love to imagine an alternate universe where Tapestry lifted my ever-solemn adolescent moods, King’s voice saying you’re beautiful and you’ve got a friend in no uncertain terms. But with records there are always second chances. It is still possible to play Tapestry and feel that someone is looking out for you. Unlike Dylan or Mitchell, King’s lyrics don’t immediately scan as political or poetic, and when Tapestry came out, the record was criticized by some as “lightweight.” In the wake of the civil rights movement and in the midst of women’s liberation, 1971 was the year that Marvin Gaye sang “What’s Going On” and Helen Reddy proclaimed “I am woman/Hear me roar.” But there was nothing light about a woman who came of age in the ’50s controlling her destiny, constructing and reconstructing her existence at will, choosing a life of both home and adventure, of heart and mind, and narrating her multitudes, the tapestry of her experience, with popular song. If it feels light, that is a feat; it feels comforting, that is a gift. For all the teen-dreaming of those early Goffin-King tunes, there’s little fantasy on Tapestry: It’s real life.

Nina Kraviz Presents Masseduction Rewired,St. VincentNina Kraviz,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df25d40fca3b800088ab400/1:1/w_160/masseductionrewired.jpg,2019-12-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/st-vincent-nina-kraviz-nina-kraviz-presents-masseduction-rewired/,Loma Vista,"If Masseduction Rewired didn’t exist there would be no great clamor to invent it. St. Vincent’s Masseduction, on which this remix album is based, has already been remade once in acoustic form, and there is no obvious crossover between St. Vincent’s warmly inventive indie pop and the arctic techno freeze of Rewired curator Nina Kraviz. More worryingly, remix albums generally run the gamut from damp squib to outright embarrassment. Against the odds, though, Masseduction Rewired is actually rather intriguing. No one—bar a rabid and possibly theoretical St. Vincent/Kraviz crossover fan—will enjoy everything here; the 22 tracks frequently stretch the patience, but most people will find something to love. Rewired also provides food for thought: Its catholic approach to remix styles encourages the listener to consider the tangled art of the remake and the question of authorial identity. Broadly speaking, the remixers on Masseduction Rewired fall somewhere between two poles: those who see the commission as a chance to tweak the original song and those who follow the Aphex Twin school of throwing the master tapes against the wall and seeing what sticks. Steffi’s gilded remix of “Slow Disco” does little more than nudge the original song into deeper disco territory, while EOD’s scuffed up and eerie take on ""Los Ageless” makes full use of the original song structure. In both cases, St. Vincent’s songwriting dominates. At the other end of the scale, Buttechno jettisons all but a few syllables of St. Vincent’s vocal for his remix of “Savior,” which he squanders over a weakling acid-house number that does neither party any lasting good. There’s something rather cheap about this approach, as if the talented Russian producer couldn’t raise himself to properly engage with the material. Icelandic artist Bjarki is also guilty of this; his version of “Pills” reduces the original’s sardonic take on pharmaceutical culture to precisely the two lines —“Pills to fuck” and “Pills, pills, pills”—that you might expect a techno producer with a looming deadline to employ. It’s not a bad song, exactly, just rather uninspired. Against this are a number of takes where the remixer manages to reinvent or even subvert the original song without destroying it. A remix of “Masseduction” by Midland, the UK producer of “Final Credits” fame, foregrounds the gorgeous string rush in the original’s middle eight to stirring effect; Emika’s take on “Sugarboy” chills St. Vincent’s electro pulse into a glacial, neo-classical synth sweep; and Jlin’s version of “Smoking Section” bustles the original’s languorous waltz into a frisky, devious skip, the authorial spoils shared equally between remixer and remixee. These individual songs represent the album at its best. But as an overall listening experience, Masseduction Rewired is a slog. It’s not just the album’s fanatical length; the decision (on the digital release) to shadow Masseduction’s original tracklisting means songs get bundled together that are either too similar to their neighbors—Nina Kraviz’ three individually excellent takes on “New York” come in a rather testing row—or too mismatched, with EOD’s mournful remix of “Slow Disco” being rudely interrupted by Kraviz’ more gabber, less gentle “Gabber Me Gently” overhaul of the same song. Inconsistency and overindulgence mean Masseduction Rewired won’t join Massive Attack’s No Protection in the elite group of truly essential remix albums. But a handful of transformative moments rescue it from the tire fire where Daft Punk’s TRON: Legacy Reconfigured pleads guiltily for our pity. Masseduction Rewired is by no means indispensable, but as a distraction it has the frustrating charm of a good crossword puzzle.

Sing the Melody,Dirty Projectors,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df808f11dc57a0008952936/1:1/w_160/singthemelody.jpg,2019-12-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dirty-projectors-sing-the-melody/,Domino,"Dave Longstreth and his Dirty Projectors are best known as purveyors of fussy, technically demanding art-pop: songs that leap between genres and time signatures, riffs and vocal arrangements that slice and pirouette around each other, verses in which “unimpressed” and “Archimedes Palimpsest” are rhymed with a wink and a grin. It’s amusing, then, that the Projectors are at their friendliest and most engaging when they strip Longstreth’s compositions down, tapping into the loose, raw energy that comes with playing live or working fast. If 2009’s towering Bitte Orca remains the band’s masterpiece, follow-up Swing Lo Magellan is their easiest album to love, in large part because its quirks—the shaggy handclaps on “Dance for You,” the giggled backing vocals on “Unto Caesar”—puncture the illusion of perfection. You’re compelled to remember that humans had to come together in a room to make this music, which in turn makes their virtuosity all the more thrilling. That’s the appeal of Sing the Melody, a new live-in-studio album released unceremoniously last week as part of Domino’s Documents series. Last November, near the tail end of months spent touring, the Projectors went into Manhattan’s Power Station to play highlights from their gleeful full-band comeback Lamp Lit Prose and a few gems from their back catalog. None of these songs are radically reinvented, but at a minimum they’re rendered with an impressive urgency. “That’s a Lifestyle” is a good example: It may have already been the most electric, familiar cut on Lamp Lit Prose, but it’s enlivened here by sharper, earthier harmonies from the trio of Felicia Douglass, Maia Friedman, and Kristin Slipp. Other songs benefit from addition by subtraction; trimming their more frivolous elements for a live lineup has granted them new clarity and focus. Opener “Right Now” loses a programmed beat, piano part, and vocal manipulation, and its skronking horns are replaced with crisp chords. The final product is a pure and galvanizing call to action, one that would’ve fit in nicely alongside the more reflective material on Swing Lo Magellan. It isn’t the only song to find a more natural home within the Projectors’ larger discography here: Longstreth & co. rip up the floorboards of the bubbly Off the Wall homage “I Feel Energy,” revealing the sort of riffs and cool, clean space heard all the way back on Rise Above. Most of Sing the Melody’s second half is devoted to older oddities, including a rendition of Dirty Projectors highlight “Cool Your Heart” that’s remarkably faithful to the glitchy, cluttered studio version. Tenured fans who remember how weird and thrilling it felt to see Longstreth pop up with a writing credit on a hit for Kanye West, Rihanna, and Paul McCartney will surely enjoy hearing him repatriate the bridge of “FourFiveSeconds,” and the 2009 David Byrne collaboration “Knotty Pine” retains its punchy, brainy energy. Where the cuts on the album’s first half threaten the supremacy of their “official” counterparts, these ones are enjoyable but ultimately inessential. “Enjoyable but ultimately inessential” doubles as a frank assessment of Dirty Projectors’ current place in the world around them. The band has felt at odds with the prevailing mood in recent years, for reasons both musical—even after tasting major pop success, Longstreth has continued to let his freak flag fly—and cultural; this isn’t the most hospitable climate, in relative terms, for exacting auteurs. Sing the Melody makes a good argument for the Projectors’ continued relevance by shifting the emphasis from Longstreth’s creative leadership to the band’s power as a collective. In that way, it recalls Bon Iver’s i,i, another album that crackles with interpersonal energy. Both releases encourage you to think of the men at their center as reliant on the communities that bring their ideas to life.","While the band’s new live-in-studio album doesn’t radically reinvent any songs, trimming some of their more frivolous elements grants them new clarity and focus.

Slipping EP,Joy Orbison,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df7f94eb7c76f0009ccac95/1:1/w_160/slipping_joy.jpg,2019-12-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joy-orbison-slipping-ep/,Hinge Finger,"Peter O’Grady is smitten with the plasticity and inherent gibberish of the voice. Yes, the South London producer adopted the handle Joy Orbison (a play on the dramatic ’60s crooner and “Caruso of Rock”), but it’s all right there on 2009’s “Hyph Mngo,” the dubstep anthem that introduced him to the dance music world. Built from the giddy thrill in toggling between “ahh” and “ooo” as it climbs to a precipitous drop, it remains one of the defining tunes of the 21st century, creating a playground for the likes of James Blake, Jamie xx, and Floating Points along the way. What followed was unrivaled dominance in electronic music worldwide, a string of smash singles that came to define EDM. Or rather, that’s what could have happened had O’Grady not instead spent the past decade dodging easy labels, preferring to take every available detour. He eschews most interviews, gigs only when he feels like it, and has never dropped a proper debut album, instead releasing a string of collaborations with Boddika and exploratory EPs on Hinge Finger, the label he runs with Will Bankhead. His most recent EP, Slipping, caps a prolific 2019 that’s found him providing gurgly g-funk to spoken-word artist James Massiah’s “Ride for Me” and making a peak-hour anthem with Overmono. Each celebrates the voice in a different way. Slipping is both his least dancefloor-minded release and his most satisfying by design, reveling in the kind of freedom that comes from loosening expectations. It opens with guest vocalist Infinite’s soulful “ooooo,” which gets truncated and run through again, the tape still running as he takes another stab at the elongated vowel. Other little sounds skitter around: the rustling of the mic, a clink like a lighter knocking against a pint glass, O’Grady stifling a giggle and saying “again.” It’s not a perfect take, but after about 30 seconds he runs with it anyway, triggering a deep globule of bass and percussive elements that aim towards a stepper beat, only to scatter like spilled mercury. Rather than a stab at a proper club banger, “Burn” feels like O’Grady hanging out with his mates, the end result pleasantly slapdash and happenstance. That casual feel carries across Slipping. The cover art features O’Grady’s nan and a young O’Grady slumbering on the couch, giving the impression of a more personal release even if the details are kept vague. “W Dad” is exactly that: his dad chatting away in a manner that recalls Aphex Twin’s ability to weave the sound of quotidian home life into exhilarating tracks without missing a beat. While there’s a sense of pop structure, the vocals stumble in from all directions, overheard rather than centered. Hear how Orbison’s beat slushes around Keyah/Blu’s slurred “fuuuck you, dahling” on “Under,” making it the perfect downtempo R&B singalong after a pill and two flutes of champagne. Slipping smears everything together, pairing gnarled noise and dancehall riddims on “Breathe In,” or overheard radio and close-mic’d whispers on “Walworth Waltz.” The sounds briefly cohere into songs before oozing apart again, making Solange’s influence clear—O’Grady is a fan of When I Get Home. As the producer explained in a recent interview, the mercurial nature of this work allows him to “get close to where I want to be… [even though] I don’t think I actually even know where that is.” Slipping entices because of that intangible quality: not quite knowing how to say it but letting it out anyway.","The London producer’s latest EP is both his least dancefloor-minded release and his most satisfying by design.

MONTANA,French Montana,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df7a2e43c96ed00084bea02/1:1/w_160/frenchmontana.jpg,2019-12-19 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/french-montana-montana/,Epic,"There’s an only-in-America charm to French Montana, the Casablanca-born Bronx rapper who—through persistence and the imprimatur of whichever label is behind him—has failed steadily upward into a world of fast cars, Kardashian trysts, and tigers on leashes. As New York’s Bloomberg-era mixtape circuit imploded, he curried favor with tastemakers from Atlanta and points south before emerging as a curator of blockbuster singles in the tradition of his indefatigable neighborhood elder Fat Joe. If his full-length collaborations with Fetty Wap, Max B, and Waka Flocka feel like ancient history, it’s because French is, improbably, the last man standing. It’s possible that no one was exactly clamoring for a French Montana double album in 2019, even if, at 67 minutes, MONTANA’s two-disc packaging is simply a stylistic choice. Montana’s longtime producer Harry Fraud, an acolyte of melodramatic ’80s rock and contemporary foreign pop, helms Disc One. Whatever the joke is, Fraud’s always in on it, and his expansive productions comprise a self-referential universe reminiscent of a Tarantino flick. The title track’s smoky chords and weeping guitar build to one of his signature second-verse beat switches, but lacking a bright narrator like fellow Fraud clients Curren$y and Action Bronson, the unwaveringly lethargic tempo makes a slog of MONTANA’s front nine. “That Way,” a reimagining of Das EFX’s “Looseys,” neither reinterprets nor builds upon the 1992 original, and French stumbles over Cool & Dre’s stuttering beat on the listless “What It Look Like.” Although Montana has a habit of sounding like a guest on his own tracks (you’ll be forgiven for failing to notice that he even clocks in between Kevin Gates and Kodak Black on “Lifestyle”), his better mixtapes feature moments in which opulence is less a taunt than an honest tribute to peers who never got to enjoy it. This can hardly be said of MONTANA, in which wealth’s depiction is surface-deep and kneecapped by French’s autopilot punchlines. The eponymous opener finds him “masturbatin’ on a scale for a hundred million, asking God how we made it”; he’s “militant like the Middle East” and “Big like the kid from Bed-Stuy.” There’s a lot of empty space in his bars. Disc 2 is the big-tent attraction, picking up where 2017’s Jungle Rules, a trap-lite affair headlined by various Migos and Sremmurds, left off. It’s star-studded, dancefloor-ready, vaguely Caribbean. “Writing on the Wall,” a delectable serving of Hot 97 kibble, stands tall among Montana’s considerable singles catalog, with a Cardi B verse that ends with her “Rollin’ down the freeway, talkin’ ‘bout a three-way/Started workin’ out but he gon’ eat me on his cheat day.” The Swae Lee-featuring “Out of Your Mind” aims to recapture the magic of “Unforgettable” and gets most of the way there, whereas “Wiggle It” conscripts City Girls for a tried-and-true barnburner. Despite the second disc’s upbeat highlights, it’s clear the well runs dry before the album’s over. “No Shopping” and “Lockjaw,” both singles from 2016’s MC4, reappear on MONTANA, as does the Drake duet “No Stylist” from mid-2018. “Hoop” sounds like a Quavo throwaway, and the Blueface and Lil Tjay feature “Slide” only perks up when the beat is briefly switched out for the “Serial Killa” instrumental halfway through. French can be enigmatic, in that his strengths and shortcomings tend to blur together: He’s a citizen-of-the-world dabbler at best, at worst an uninspired cover artist. As a grab-bag of singles made for Hornblower cruises and thirty-second timeouts at Madison Square Garden, MONTANA is effectively too big to fail. But it’s perplexing that a project this market-tested came out so flimsy.","The double album from the Bronx rapper is a bloated, grab-bag of singles made for Hornblower cruises and thirty-second timeouts at Madison Square Garden.

OCCULTING DISK,Deathprod,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df79f8686d8e9000899403b/1:1/w_160/occultingdesk.jpg,2019-12-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deathprod-occulting-disk/,Smalltown Supersound,"More than 15 years ago, Norwegian sound artist and Supersilent co-founder Helge Sten seemed to bury his Deathprod alias. For a decade, Sten barbed intricate drones with spikes of static, then stuffed it all into four essential discs in a 2004 box set that suggested a coffin. He went largely silent. Motivated by the recent rise of nationalists and strongmen worldwide, though, Sten has resurrected Deathprod for what he calls an “anti-fascist ritual” with Occulting Disk. The album is, as Will Oldham writes in the liner notes, a 10-track attempt to “address ... hatred and reduce it by its opposite.” Sten launches Occulting Disk on the offensive with “Disappearance/Reappearance,” a digital battle hymn that pushes one distorted note past the point of collapse. For nine minutes, Sten oscillates between corrosive washes and bellowing foghorn blasts, stretching out the rests between them to make you fret over what comes next. It’s as forceful and finessed as the best of Birchville Cat Motel or Prurient, and it offers a welcome progressive corrective for power electronics, a world often hamstrung by its flirtation with or outright descent into fascism. Despite the truculent introduction, Sten does much more than rage. His emotional breadth and nuance remind us of the heart required to fight back. “Occultation 2” suggests the onset of a panic attack, with meticulously nested layers of static and sustain closing in around you, cutting off your ability to consider anything else. With its delicate tones drifting above air-raid sirens, “Occultation 3” evokes a mourner’s wail amid chaos. Sten has often explored a sense of play with Deathprod’s concepts and titles. He’s got a beautiful track called “Orgone Donor” and an eerie drone dubbed “The Contraceptive Briefcase II.” The brilliantly ambiguous title Occulting Disk continues this thread. Is the music meant to conscript us into rebellions? Or is the “occulting” that happens here more akin to an interrupted signal, as when the moon occults the sun? Perhaps these tracks are acts of distraction, meant to be blasted at an enemy. Occulting Disk is somehow mesmerizing and terrifying—motivational for those who need it, a nuisance to those who don’t want it. At 66 minutes, Occulting Disk may get tedious or even tiring. Its heaviest blows fling you against the ropes and leave you there. But the length and the range of these 10 tracks offer an implicit lesson in perseverance, a necessary skill when countering deeply entrenched, well-heeled oppressors. Sten emerges from the catatonia of “Occultation 7” with a 12-minute counterattack of a finale, a piece that overruns whatever space you give it. Looking from the edge of one decade where entropy has metastasized and into the increasingly anxious next one, Occulting Disk is a reminder to believe in rallying for the cause, no matter how long it takes or however hellish the prospect and process may sound.

Heavy Is the Head,Stormzy,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df7a0ab86d8e9000899403d/1:1/w_160/stormzyheavy.jpg,2019-12-18 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stormzy-heavy-is-the-head/,#MERKYAtlantic,"Stormzy’s second album hit streaming services in the UK just a couple of hours after polls closed in the country’s latest general election. The vote was touted as the most important in recent British history, but, honestly, you’d be forgiven for having lost track by now. Besides, this timing wasn’t planned: The election was called just a matter of weeks ago. Typically this coincidence in timing wouldn’t matter, but in the years since his debut, Gang Signs & Prayer, went to number one, Stormzy has risen to become something of a generational spokesperson. It feels fitting, then, that the album arrived as the country decided on its future. Since 2017, Stormzy’s music and his activism have been increasingly intertwined. He used a performance at the BRIT Awards to decry then-Prime Minister Theresa May’s response to the Grenfell tragedy. Thousands of people at Glastonbury were broadcast shouting “Fuck the government and fuck Boris [Johnson, UK prime minister]” during his performance of “Vossi Bop” this summer. Elsewhere, he’s established a scholarship fund for black students at Cambridge University, and launched a publishing imprint with Penguin that’s dedicated to showcasing underrepresented voices. If there’s a unifying theme to this album, it’s the infiltration of black artists—and young black men in particular, who are especially demonised and marginalised in British society—into canonized spaces. It plays out in the Shakespearean reference in the album’s title, and the hanging of its artwork in London’s National Portrait Gallery. “We’re still taking up space,” Stormzy declares on punchy opener “Big Michael,” and with the repetition of “Big Michael’s back, your time’s up” there’s the sense that he’s addressing more than just opponents in petty grime beefs. On “Superheroes” he rewrites the media’s narrative around young black men, calling out the successes of his peers. He underlines the point elsewhere on the album by calling out the endless list of establishment hallmarks and name-checks he’s notched up in the past two years: The Glastonbury headline slot, Elle cover, TIME cover, GQ cover, number one chart spots, BRIT Awards. It all adds up to a powerful picture. His phenomenal success and influence have compounded the pressure on his still-young shoulders—“How the hell did I buss so fast?” he asks on “Audacity.” For Stormzy, the remaining questions are existential: Is he comfortable with his status as a household name and figurehead? It’s something he pokes at in the opening bars of the album—“Can’t tell where I’m heading,” he brags half-heartedly—but he arguably never finds an answer. Moments of doubt and frustration creep in. “I am not the poster boy for mental health,” he spits on “One Second,” referring to an unsanctioned NME cover from 2017. “Mummy always said if there’s a cause then I should fight for it/So yeah I understand, but I don’t think that I’m all right with it,” he continues. He’s aware of his contradictions—“One week it’s ‘Blinded By Your Grace,’ next week it’s bang you in your face,” as he puts it on the album opener—and they play out in the open here. There’s gravity in these moments of vulnerability, but Stormzy doesn’t always get it right. “Lessons” is the album’s most tender moment, but arguably its most problematic. The track appears to confirm rumors of the rapper’s infidelity to his radio presenter/model ex-girlfriend Maya Jama, and Stormzy spends the majority of the three minutes asking for forgiveness. However, lines like “Thought I’d say it here than rather fling it in a text” perhaps reveal his misunderstanding of the power dynamics at play. Of course he has every right to address his personal torment in his art, but in this case he appears to ignore the fact that the person who ended the relationship—and did so as privately as possible—might not want the break-up to play out on an album track that’ll be listened to and combed over by potentially millions of people. It also feels slightly disingenuous when followed by a song whose hook is about ejaculating on someone else’s girlfriend’s face. The heavy politicizing of his work doesn’t mean he’s not having fun, though. At the root of Stormzy’s appeal, as well as his authenticity, is a charismatic swagger. He skips over the beat on “Pop Boy” with such ease that there’s little to do but sit back and revel in it. The Burna Boy- and Sheeran-backed “Own It” follows: A silky pop anthem for a generation reared on dembows. The album is built around one-two punch combinations like this pairing. Adjacent songs are linked with one another sonically and lyrically: “Wiley Flow” and “Bronze” trade grimey taunts over record sales and certifications; “Crown” and “Rainfall” meld praise and introspection in an extension of GSAP’s “gospel grime” tracks; “Handsome” matches the marching tempo of “Rachael’s Little Brother” and links to the song with its “bun down the rave like Rachael Anson” refrain. These threads between tracks are a cute touch, but feel slightly overwrought as the record slides between pared-back grime, luxurious R&B, introspective trap, gospel confessional, and puff-chested rap. The versatility on show gives a sheen of adventurousness that isn’t quite backed up by the beat selections—the majority of which feel like safe choices for an artist otherwise known for his accelerated ambitions. And while HITH sees Stormzy navigate second album syndrome with apparent ease, it also leaves open the question of where he goes from here.","As he ascends from grime rapper to generational spokesperson, the charismatic UK star tries to figure out where to go next.

Upsurge,Stenny,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df3c2eab91d230008bf384a/1:1/w_160/upsurge.jpg,2019-12-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stenny-upsurge/,Ilian Tape,"The celebrated techno label Ilian Tape doesn’t actually release all that much techno—at least not in the traditional sense. Founded in 2007 by brothers Dario and Marco Zenker and centered on a small crew of producers, the Munich imprint has always been something of an outlier, a loose-limbed counterargument to the rigid industrial stomp that characterizes so much Berlin techno. For Ilian Tape, broken beats have long been the norm, and in recent years, the label’s path has diverged even further by embracing the sounds of the UK hardcore continuum. Swinging garage rhythms, dubstep bass weight, ’90s rave breaks, brain-rattling jungle—it’s all become part of the Ilian Tape formula. Few artists have embodied this ethos more than Skee Mask, the longtime Ilian Tape contributor behind beloved, genre-melding albums Shred and Compro. Before last month, only he and the Zenker Brothers had released full-lengths on the label, but they’re now joined by Italian producer Stenny. Part of the Ilian Tape roster since 2012 and based in Munich since 2014, he has been sparing with his output, generally releasing no more than one EP per year. In 2019, however, he’s upped his game. Back in May, he released Stress Test, an EP whose title track paired skippy 2-step garage with menacing synths and the same sort of thick, syrupy basslines that powered old DMZ records. It’s been one of the year’s biggest tunes. Now, he’s followed that up with Upsurge, his debut album, which includes some similarly sharp club heaters. With its crunchy electro rhythm and seriously brawny bassline, the insistent “Swordfish” is likely the toughest—and best—of the lot, while “BFRB” combines a nimble drum attack with a booming low end that hits like a sledgehammer to the chest. The moody “Psygraph” ramps up the tempo even further, unleashing a fervent jungle beat amid a lingering fog of diaphanous atmospherics, and the drum’n’bass calisthenics continue on “Fast Fade,” its slinky purple melodies shimmering like a sportscar on a moonlit night. Yet despite this cluster of club-friendly fare, Upsurge frequently operates outside the strict confines of the dancefloor. After years of crafting jagged techno, Stenny has elected to showcase his softer side; large swaths of the record feel notably pensive. Album opener “Water Maze” is a wide-eyed ambient number, its lush environs and colorful synth blossoms tempered by the sound of light rain. Darker but similarly introspective is “Sensitive Habitat,” which keeps its head down as a melancholy drone hovers amid rapid-fire percussion. In contrast, the tranquil “Dew” looks skyward, its twinkling melodies and wafting woodwinds conjuring images of remote Asian monasteries. There’s a wondrous quality to Upsurge that frequently harkens back to the clumsily named post-dubstep sound that redefined the UK’s electronic-music landscape a decade ago. With his predilection for dreamily glowing melodies and stuttering rhythms, Stenny does occasionally seem to be channeling the early work of artists like Joy Orbison and Mount Kimbie; a song like “Blind Corners” could easily have been released on Hotflush back in 2010. Yet it would be unfair to describe this warm, delicately textured album as a nostalgia exercise. A big part of what made post-dubstep so exciting was its willingness to experiment; producers raised on garage, dubstep, jungle, and other bass-centric sounds expanded their vision, pulling from house, techno, ambient, R&B, IDM, and whatever else they could find while crafting new, mutant forms of electronic music. Stenny, like the rest of his label-mates, has taken the same hybrid approach, only with techno as a starting point. Ilian Tape’s evolution has been gradual, but few outfits outside of the UK have so constructively engaged with the hardcore continuum without falling into shallow mimicry. Techno has always been rooted in notions of futurism, yet the music itself has often proven to be rather rigid. As recently as a few years ago, the thought of an artist like Stenny dabbling in drum’n’bass would have seemed almost unthinkable, but now, songs like the playful “Whyrl” and the brooding “Cursed” feel like natural extensions of his sound. Things are changing, and Upsurge is an impressive document of Stenny’s ability to flout genre boundaries while delivering introspective and highly personal music. Slowly but surely, techno is moving into the future—even if it doesn’t necessarily sound like techno anymore.","Following in the path of his label-mates Skee Mask and the Zenker Brothers, the Italian producer’s debut album continues to provide a loose-limbed counterargument to more rigid strains of techno.

Bubba,Kaytranada,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df3c008b91d230008bf3846/1:1/w_160/bubba.jpeg,2019-12-17 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kaytranada-bubba/,RCA,"For Kaytranada, everything starts with the drums. The Canadian producer builds tracks from percussion outward, perhaps opening with a hi-hat, then adding a bassline and kick drums and only afterward seeking chords that may suit the foundation. His terrific new album Bubba opens with one second of drumming before the beat switches and his signature synths arrive. On a more conventional pop record, this might be interpreted as an arbitrary gesture given how quickly it passes. But nothing on Bubba is accidental. The album capitalizes on the promise of Kaytranada’s 2016 debut, 99.9% and blesses this woeful decade with one last great dance record. With 99.9%, Kaytranada established himself as a producer with a well-defined and influential sensibility. It was sample-heavy and for all of Kay’s digital chops, the production still felt analog: The synths shook and the drums swung. It was also collaborative in the best possible sense. Kaytranada’s sense of purpose was strong enough to yoke the other artists to his intent. In one of the few interviews he gave in the run-up to Bubba’s release, he described how he cajoles potential features. “Some people just want the usual, basic stuff they’re comfortable with,” he said. “You have to work to push them out of their comfort zone.” Nevertheless, Bubba sounds very comfortable. It’s a dance album front-to-back, fun, confident, always keeping you in perpetual motion, no matter what might be happening around you (train delay, being mugged, the heat death of the universe). Take “Taste,” whose snapping beat is complicated by an uncooperative bass. Only two other instruments are necessary: topaz synths and the voice of VanJess, the Nigerian-American duo with businesslike vocals. It’s perhaps the simplest song here and like almost all the others, an undeniable dancefloor summons. (Kaytranada frequently uses the voices of his collaborators to reference the sounds of the early 2000s; When TDE’s SiR isn’t pitching his voice Anderson .Paak style, his layered voice recalls the songs of 112 or Jagged Edge, both because of the harmonies that end his bars on “Go DJ” and the fact that he sings the lyric, “Where the party at.”) It does the record a small disservice to pull songs out at random like this. Both “Taste” and “Go DJ” are followed by tracks that lead out naturally like the flow of a DJ set. But that exceptional flow leaves room for punctuation marks, and several come when Kaytranada feels perfectly in tune with his collaborators. The first of these is “10%” with Kali Uchis. Three different beats, piled high like sedimentary layers, herald her alto, and she spends the remainder of the song surfing atop the beat. Kaytranada has similar chemistry with GoldLink on the song “Vex Oh,” and a cameo from Estelle on “Oh No” delivers the same promise that the Craig David feature “Got It Good,” did on the previous album. The superficial outro “Midsection” featuring Pharrell and his falsetto might be the only track on which Kaytranada’s collaborator overrides him to the song’s detriment. But that only emphasizes how strong the other tracks are. Kaytranada uses vocalists as an additional instrument. (Lyrics have always seemed to function more as pure sound for him than anything else; he values the textures of words above their meanings.) So it’s particularly fun to see what he does when that tool isn’t available, as on the standout instrumental “Scared to Death.” Here, Kay stacks those strobing synths he favors on top of bass and on top of that, places a melodic build—a minute in, he pulls the bass out momentarily to let things ride for a moment. The room continues to rotate. A mournful airhorn sounds. And then the beat comes back, with all the impact you’d hope for, the sound of a party catching its second wind. Twice now has Kaytranada demonstrated the vision required to carry a long-player, working subtle structures into his songs that allow him to keep the momentum up without losing the feeling that those songs are complete in their own right. Bubba is another set of coherent, well-sequenced set of tracks without any major drop-offs, all the more impressive as the album runs more than 50 minutes. It’s flexible, ever-moving, a dance record that could have come from no one else. It’s an old-fashioned skill, his ability to create albums that function as albums, especially for an artist so rooted in the progressive genres of hip-hop and dance. But it makes sense that Kaytranada is so good at it. Bubba thrives on pacing, sequencing, the placing of details that drive you to listen to all of its songs every time you put it on. Which is to say, building an album like this just requires a more advanced form of rhythm.","With an exceptional collaborative spirit and a highly refined sound, Kaytranada blesses this woeful decade with one last great dance record.

WT_PRT15.,Knxwledge,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df7f848b7c76f0009ccac93/1:1/w_160/wtprt15.jpg,2019-12-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knxwledge-wt-prt15/,self-released,"Rappers loved bootlegging Glen Boothe’s beats, so he started bootlegging their raps. That’s the lore behind the Wraptaypes anthology, which Boothe (aka Knxwledge) started back in 2011 and of which he has dropped multiple installments every subsequent year. (It’s hard to tell how many, as he likes to put decimals points in the edition number, like last summer’s part 14.8). Each one combines lo-fi a capellas of songs and freestyles ripped from dollar-bin record finds and YouTube with burly sampled loops, sometimes barely altered beyond a degradation in fidelity or a few drum clicks. WT_PRT15., his newest, is no different, dipping vocals from Jay-Z, UGK, and Young Thug into a gluey mixture of vintage horn riffs and soul croons. Some may view the formula as tired, but there are always moments of brilliance to catch you off-guard. Just as his beats start to lull, an entrancing melody, or a punchline that’s tee’d up dazzlingly off a sample, hits you square in the heart. That moment comes fairly early on in PRT15. Wedged in between a pair of minute-long sketches sits “UGK[TAPE],” a repurposing of UGK and OutKast’s 2007 classic “Int’l Players Anthem (I Choose You).” The southern MCs are parachuted in over a bed of strings, a sample that sounds like it was plucked from the score of some 1940s MGM classic. Accentuating the strings, you can still sort-of hear the soaring vocals from the a capella’s original sample, Willie Hutch’s “I Choose You.” The track is over four minutes long, doesn’t include any changes in its song structure—just like all the other beats on the tape, the loop keeps looping—and yet remains mesmerizing. Another high point comes on “freeallmynihgas,” a sprawling freestyle from an unnamed MC that sounds captured from a cell phone. Boothe takes this verse, a roll call of loved ones locked away, and sets it to a sprightly keyboard melody, giving it a near-musical theater quality. He pulls a similar move on the opener “shotgunvision,” pinning a gritty verse referencing ski-mask robberies and trapping from the sofa against a bright synth. In these moments, Boothe is reimagining not just  songs, but moments in time, a method he’s been pursuing since his childhood in church, where he would record sermons on small cassette tapes and then chop them up on his Roland SP-303. But not all the tracks on PRT15. justify their run times. A handful start to lose steam past the first few minutes, when the initial rush wears off. On “team [SRF],” for example, which reworks Young Thug’s So Much Fun highlight “Surf,” the bare-bones instrumental of guitar plucks and doo-wop hums is simply too sparse to keep things interesting, a bridge section stretched too far. Meanwhile, Boothe’s ghostly revision of Reasonable Doubt classic “Dead Presidents” is thrilling in its first moments, with its muffled carol choruses and croaking bass notes, but is too gooey to go four minutes without any sort of beat change or break. This is par for the course when it comes to Wraptaypes, a series that finds Boothe hardly extending himself beyond his first strike of inspiration. It could explain why he can produce at such a prolific clip, cranking out numerous installments of other anthologies simultaneously, including an R&B vocals-based tape series and a Meek Mill-centered one. If an a capella and instrumental sound right on first alignment, he lets them take on a life of their own, leaving the door open for both imperfection and symmetry.","In the latest installment of his anthology, Glen Boothe continues dipping rap verses in warm, nostalgic loops.

Uncut Gems (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Daniel Lopatin,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df111743c96ed00084be628/1:1/w_160/uncutgems.jpg,2019-12-16 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daniel-lopatin-uncut-gems-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,Warp,"The title sequence of the new Safdie brothers film, Uncut Gems, brings the moviegoer along a CGI-assisted journey through light-years of celestial mist before the camera recedes into footage from a probe deep inside Adam Sander’s ass. Watching the opening credits fade over shots of protagonist Howie Ratner’s colon—pink and ribbed, like an aquatic worm—is bearing witness to an act that is in the macro graceful and in the micro grotesque, a confusing alloy found often in the work of the music of electronic musician, sound designer, and auteur Daniel Lopatin, usually known as Oneohtrix Point Never. Lopatin has long blended sincerity and absurdity, the ratio of which varies dramatically per project. There was the score he did for the Safdie Brothers’ 2017 film Good Time, a one-night-in-New-York wreckage play upon which Lopatin’s sound design lavishes the serenity of being trapped in a hot elevator. There was 2010’s unimpeachable Eccojams Vol 1, under the nom de plume Chuck Person—an enormously goofy, surprisingly moving chopped-and-screwed tape of customer-support muzak and pop cheese that would predate the vaporwave hurricane by at least two years. Last year’s prolix and lore-ridden Age Of featured a track that served as his “proof of concept” for how he would score an entirely made-up Pixar story. But there is plenty real about Uncut Gems, a movie filled with big, avian men who are always yelling at one another. This is par for the brothers Safdie, who seem to love making films about antiheroes run amok in Manhattan at maximum volume. Stark and tweaky under overcast skies, Midtown’s diamond district here acts as mayhem’s gate: a world in which sweaty bookies and graying heavies take meetings and hostages in the backs of hired cars, and promises should have been fulfilled yesterday. For our hero Howie, every opportunity is a potentially profitable one, be it a scheme to auction off a rare opal for 10 times its price, or the chance to make quick money off Kevin Garnett’s championship ring on an hours-long loan. Naturally, the peripatetic lifestyle of a gambler is bipolar—all zeniths and nadirs, the former leading directly and inevitably to the latter. Manic as the source material may be, Lopatin’s score remains entirely surprising, which doesn’t mean shocking, per se. It’s more that it has a large blast radius in the movie, itself a funny character in an ensemble of unintentionally funny characters. Lopatin is brazenly and consistently there, replete with a choral ensemble classically trained in a cappella Renaissance music and a handful of co-conspirators (the unholy Gatekeeper among them) who beef up each scene with the baroquely doofy polysynth dressings that could only belong under Lopatin’s baton. The sound design drapes heavily around the necks of everyone in the film. Sometimes, Lopatin’s work is mixed so loudly that I laughed out loud. (Consider a scene in which Howie, trudging a long hallway with two bloody plugs of tissue in his nostrils and a faraway look in his eyes, has an electric sax-ridden fugue blasting like a frat initiation.) At other times, the music offers a kind of counterpoint. Where there is chaos, the score might get unusually soft; where there is sex, the tones scan saccharine; where there is heartbreak, Lopatin’s troupe treats misery like a punchline. (There’s a great scene in which Ratner’s girlfriend, played perfectly by Julia Fox, storms past a long line of club-goers immediately after sort of cheating on Ratner with the Weeknd. Here, the score—and the track in question, titled “Fuck You Howard”—sounds as if a Nordic boating team was asked to contribute vocals to Animal Crossing theme music.) Soundtracking will always call into question the way that noise can make an image feel more glib, or more concerted; how audio can apply pressure, release a valve, inspire hysteria, dread, or joy within a scene. The idea of anxiety-making via carefully orchestrated synthwork is not new, but the Safdie brothers and Lopatin seem to have gotten the art down to a science. Some of the stabbingly angular ways in which the soundtrack dispenses somatic terror can feel like a savvy interpretation of “anxiety reappraisal,” a fashionable stress-management method that asks one to reframe anxiety-producing events as exciting ones. Thinking calm thoughts during panic only seems to exacerbate things; loud and low-BPM music during a screaming match does not a soothing scene make. This isn’t to say that the score doesn’t summon disquiet through more traditional ways: “Windows”—which smacks obviously of percussionist and contributor Eli Keszler, a man who has seemingly spent his life mimicking the beautiful and complex skitter of rainwater on various roofs—lends a runaway scene on a helicopter the nervy vim necessary to set off the film’s final 20 minutes of cardio. High or low octane, it’s satisfying to situate Lopatin and the Safdies as part of a greater legacy of director-and-musician duets formed and calcified during the 1970s and 1980s. These films—the plots of which revolved around male antiheroes locked in doomed quests to resolve their poor choices—were scored by either proggy Germans (Goblin, Tangerine Dream), glistering Italians (Sensation’s Fix, Giorgio Moroder), or spectral Greeks (Vangelis), adding new, freaky, new-age dimensions to the portrayal of male misery. “It's so strange that that became the sound of men reflecting on their nature,” Lopatin said in the wake of Good Time. The fact that the Safdie brothers have found kinship in Lopatin, and the fact that this becomes the new sound of men who refuse to look inward, does the rare work of riffing on a tradition and catapulting it into canon. Midway through the film, woeful Howie is faced with a moment of reckoning disguised as an ultimatum. “You really put me in a bad position,” says a foe, threatening him with a fresher hell than the one he endured the day prior. Lopatin, like Howie, is a man indebted to the absurdity of circumstance. Bad decisions upon good decisions, orientations upon re-orientations—the two work in a fractal pas de deux, hunting for the hardest payoff per scene, per moment, per any opportunity presented. Ashes to ashes, nebula to butthole, what else can one do?

LP1,Liam Payne,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5deecbfac573b80009766dc9/1:1/w_160/lp1.jpg,2019-12-16 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liam-payne-lp1/,Capitol,"One Direction was famously assembled because Simon Cowell and his fellow X-Factor judges didn’t have much faith in the boys’ potential as solo artists. If Liam Payne’s debut, released more than a decade after the band’s televised genesis, is any indication, Cowell was right. Payne is, at best, competent. His voice is pleasant but not especially charismatic. His choices are safe but uninspired. A couple of years after launching his career, his musical identity remains wholly unremarkable. (Cowell has since criticized Payne in the press for signing with Capitol, and not his own pop-pipeline label.) LP1’s 17 songs, including a 2018 Rita Ora collab from the 50 Shades Freed soundtrack and a Christmas number tacked on at the end, have the ambiance and trend-scraping of a Zara fitting room. The journey from boy band to solo act has broken many aspiring pop stars. But what it requires most—gesturing at a distinct, compelling identity—is Payne’s biggest question mark. Despite being a UK tabloid fixture, he’s been unable to convey a discernible personality—or any personality at all. Even with a built-in global audience of millions, it’s unclear who this collection of middling songs could possibly resonate with. Former Directioners clamoring for a solo Liam album? New fans seeking nondescript, paint-by-numbers pop? And yet, improbably, Payne has been among the band’s most successful solo members, metrics-wise. “Strip That Down,” a 2017 love song premised on his freedom from One Direction and featuring a bloodless verse from Quavo, has amassed billions of plays. Other singles, like “Familiar” with J Balvin and “Get Low” with Zedd, despite being completely unmemorable, have proved adequate enough to satisfy the low bar of a generic pop playlist. Throwing spaghetti at a Spotify algorithm and seeing what sticks appears to be Payne’s strategy with the rest of LP1. The single “Stack It Up,” featuring A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, further betrays his ambition of an Ed Sheeran-style metabolism of the current pop sounds. There are layered R&B harmonies, vaguely Latin rhythms, and compressed synths as melody, but even with two songs written by Sheeran himself, Payne only gasps at his radio-ready effectiveness. In recent press, Payne has hinted at the complexity of his life post-One Direction, including fatherhood, brushes with substance abuse, and frustration with accepting his role as the band’s most-boring member. But he draws little inspiration from that wealth of real-life experience. Instead, he relies on inane songwriting concepts, rote misogyny, and feelingless flexing. The lyrics are puerile and half-baked. It’s hardly worth laying them all out on the page, but the worst offender must be from (the nerve!) “Hips Don’t Lie”: “Don’t be giving me the eye/Unless you got what I need/I hope your hips don’t lie/Unless they’re lying with me,” he sings. One song, “Both Ways,” takes the trope of hetero objectification of bisexual women to gross new lows: “No, no, I don’t discriminate/Bring it back to my place/Yeah, she like it both ways.” In addition to being offensive, it’s not even convincing as an expression of desire. If you can’t effectively use a pop song to communicate horniness, the most basic of human emotions, then what do you have? Listening to LP1, you almost feel sorry for Payne. It’s maybe more pathetic to have failed not for risking too much, but after seeming to have tried so little.

The Chronic,Dr. Dre,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee9d8bc573b80009766dc2/1:1/w_160/thechronic.jpg,2019-12-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dr-dre-the-chronic/,,"Dr. Dre’s solo rap career began like a yarn out of a mob epic: coercion, conspiracy, guns strategically placed near jacuzzis. As a member of N.W.A in the mid-1980s, the producer was a star, but he was convinced that Eazy-E—the head of his record label, Ruthless, and fellow N.W.A. member—was fleecing him. Dre was seeking freedom from the World’s Most Dangerous Group, but he ended up dealing with someone far more treacherous. Pro football prospect turned hulking enforcer, Marion Knight, Jr., nicknamed Suge for the sweet sugar bear he was as a child, had a reputation for intimidation that was the stuff of industry myth: punching a guy through a closed door and dangling Vanilla Ice off a balcony. He’d been hanging around Ruthless as the D.O.C.’s bodyguard and had grown close to Dre during his conflict with the label. With an eye on becoming a music mogul, Suge saw Dre as his meal ticket. Dre was already done mastering the final N.W.A. album, 1991’s Niggaz4Life, and he wanted out so he could finish work on his solo material. All that was standing in his and Suge’s way was Eazy. On April 23, 1991, Eazy-E went up to the studios at Solar Records where he was greeted by Suge and a small entourage of men with pipes and Louisville sluggers. Suge delivered contract releases for several Ruthless artists and planned to squeeze Eazy into signing them so he could poach the artists for the fledgling label he was starting. He told Eazy he had N.W.A.’s manager Jerry Heller tied up in a van before offering a final warning: “We know where your mother lives.” With that, Eazy signed. The documents weren’t deemed legally binding, but the wheels were in motion. Eventually, Suge got his way: Dre was no longer a Ruthless artist, and Death Row Records was born. In 1992, Dr. Dre was the biggest producer in hip-hop music, a pioneer drawing comparisons to Quincy Jones and Phil Spector; he was also its most unemployable one. Plagued by legal battles and beset with a number of open court cases, nobody would touch him. Five of the eight albums Dre produced for Ruthless from 1987 to 1991 went platinum, but he was a volatile figure prone to violence. He was accused of a savage, public assault by journalist Dee Barnes and another assault on a police officer during a 50-person brawl he allegedly started. On top of that, neither he nor Suge had much of a business acumen, and they were hemorrhaging cash. Death Row was ostensibly up and running with a master architect at the helm, but the young label needed a big victory upon which to build its empire. The Chronic became that cornerstone achievement, kicking off a historic four-year run that ended with the death of the label’s other major star, Tupac Shakur. In that time, Dre established himself as not just a peerless producer but a visionary. His debut album, 1992’s The Chronic is an imaginative crusade with half-truths so vibrant they blurred the lines of what was real. He collapsed the distance between the lawless Los Angeles of the persona he created for himself and the real one right outside Solar studios, giving his songs texture wherever possible: prank calls; Rudy Ray Moore skits; clips from blaxploitation flick The Mack; an earlier Chronic song playing as background music for a sketch in a later one; live commentary from protestors; exasperated TV news anchors announcing a city on fire. It is so meticulously crafted, so magnificently designed. Thanks to some last-minute minute legal negotiations that set the price for Dre’s freedom from Ruthless at royalty payments for all of Dre’s Death Row projects including The Chronic, the same album Dre used as a megaphone to badmouth Eazy-E and Jerry Heller was also paying them handsomely. They are the album’s primary antagonists, and Dre’s ire for them powers his performance. The triumphant lead-off “Fuck wit Dre Day” couches celebration of his success in the broader context of the streets losing respect for Eazy. The taunts on the intro are aimed squarely at Ruthless, as if their demise was the postscript on Death Row’s ascendence, and Eazy was the bitch that ain’t shit. Despite all the direct provocation, Dre’s greatest insult was the album itself: He’d pried The Chronic right out of Eazy’s hands. In Ronin Ro’s Have Gun Will Travel, Heller lamented its loss: “That album would’ve been ours if it hadn’t been stolen.” Death Row was a seedy operation with drug lord investors, secret incorporations, and nefarious loans, according to Ben Westhoff’s Original Gangstas, but the men at the top both knew how to spot talent. The album sometimes plays as promotional material for the label, partially because everyone there was trying to will future success into existence, but also because the label was the center of Dre’s entire world at the time. “I needed a record to come out,” Dre admitted to Rolling Stone in ’93. “I was broke. I didn’t receive one fucking quarter in the year of ’92.” Dre desperately needed to find a new voice. In N.W.A, he had the luxury of working with one of rap’s best-ever writers, Ice Cube. Those were big shoes to fill. He found his new scribe in Snoop Dogg, a slinky teenager from Long Beach who quickly became one of the greatest rappers ever. Dre wasn’t a songwriter, he’d only ever performed in a posse, and the hearty voice of the rapper he banked on, the D.O.C., had been irreparably damaged in a car accident. He was a great director without a star. It was Snoop, with his sneering yet relaxed flow, that so casually stole the role. He seized every opportunity. “When I listen back to The Chronic album, I’m like, how the fuck was I on damn near every song?” Snoop remembered. “I was whoopin’ niggas! They would be going home to go get chicken, I’d be in that motherfucker all night. If Dre even had half of a beat or had the drums, I’d write some shit to the drums and come up with a melody. Before you know it, I’m on a song.” As both a purveyor and connoisseur, Snoop also brought to the table one of the album’s most critical ingredients: weed. His incessant use introduced his producer to the chronic, slang used in reference to sticky hydroponic bud that was of the highest quality; the term, which became a metaphor for the quality of the music, stuck as a title. Dre, who’d rapped on 1988’s “Express Yourself” that he didn’t smoke marijuana because it caused brain damage, was now naming his entire album after a potent cross-strain. The aromatic puffs of smoke that filled the studio inspired slower, smoother music. Snoop was at the center of a writer’s room that Dre had taken to calling the Death Row Inmates: The D.O.C., rapper-producer Daz Dillinger and RBX (two of Snoop’s cousins), Kurupt, Lady of Rage (who Dre flew in from Manhattan), Snoop’s group 213 with Dre’s stepbrother Warren G and a little-known singer named Nate Dogg, and the First Lady of Death Row, the R&B vocalist Jewell. This oddball crew convened at Dre’s Calabasas mansion and the Solar studios with musicians Colin Wolfe and Chris “The Glove” Taylor, smoking, bonding, writing, and recording, punching in and exchanging ideas. Suge Knight wanted Death Row feared and revered around the land like a lauded crew of bandits in a spaghetti western. According to Original Gangstas, the label head would send his rappers to little amphitheaters and housing projects to battle anyone. Those battles spilled over to The Chronic, fostering both a familial closeness (beyond the obvious blood ties) and a competitiveness that fueled many sessions. The Inmates were all broke and eager to rhyme back then. Every member wanted to cut the best verse and meet Dre’s impossibly high standards. Songs like “Lyrical Gangbang” and posse cut “Stranded on Death Row” in particular had this battler’s edge, pure showcases of raw rap talent from Lady of Rage, Kurupt, and RBX. The artists on The Chronic team were written off, as many West Coast rappers were, as lesser rappers (the headline on Jonathan Gold’s review in the Los Angeles Times read, “The Rap’s Flat, But Ya Can’t Beat the Beat”). They weren’t working as hard to be clever as most of the rappers back East, and while they weren’t quite the writers Ice Cube and MC Ren were, their verses were still striking, charismatic, imposing, and idiosyncratic. Criticism of the rapping on The Chronic also took aim at Dre, who was never quite a natural rapper, even in N.W.A’s heyday. Gold called his verses “forced,” and deemed him a lesser rapper than producer. If the former is an overstatement, the latter is true. But both were pervasive judgments of Dre. One of the album’s greatest feats is how it mitigates his limitations with a chorus of other voices. Dre goes to painstaking lengths not to appear too frequently, and when he does, he comes off as part of a dynamic one-two punch. The force of the combination is felt most heavily on the attack, and much of The Chronic offensive continued N.W.A’s longstanding war with cops and L.A.’s violent policing initiative. The spark was an acquittal of the four officers caught on videotape beating motorist Rodney King with batons. For six days after, in Spring 1992, L.A. was ablaze. The LAPD was the first militarized police force in America, a hostile occupying mob that went to war with the Black Panthers and invaded Southern Los Angeles. Chief of Police Daryl Gates, who, in 1990, infamously said casual drug users “ought to be taken out and shot” because “we’re in a war,” had encouraged the kind of treatment seen in the Rodney King video across the city, and now that black citizens were rising up in response he was sitting on his hands. While the violence of the riots spread from the corner of Florence and Normandie like a wave overtaking the city, Gates was at a fundraising dinner in affluent Brentwood. (As the city outside was catching fire, one woman at the dinner said of Gates, “We’re behind you all the way and I want to see you as President of the United States,” to laughter and cheers from the crowd.) The original version of Chronic track, “The Day the Niggaz Took Over,” called “Mr. Officer,” imagined a vengeful Dre switching places with King and rising up in a way he couldn’t. “Fuck Daryl Gates and the whole police staff,” he raps venomously. “Mr. Officer” spoke more directly to hatred for police, but the song is better for the change: foregrounding not the crooked cops killing with impunity but the people standing up to them. “You see when niggas get together,” Dre rapped, “they get mad ’cause they can’t fade us.” Cops were often the villains in N.W.A songs (see: “Fuck the Police,” “Real Niggaz Don’t Die”), but their influence throughout The Chronic is more insidious. Dre’s Los Angeles was a direct product of the LAPD’s anti-black and commando agenda. They raided the Panthers’ L.A. headquarters in 1969 on a bad warrant, which in turn created a vacuum filled by gangs like the Bloods and Crips, they cultivated one of the most trigger-happy departments in the country by the early ’90s, and they tagged crimes between black victims and perpetrators as NHI, for “No Human Involved.” Twenty-seven years later, when I hear “The Day the Niggaz Took Over,” I still see Los Angeles burning. It’s doomsday rap seeking a reckoning, the sound of a city swallowed whole by a sweeping black rage and defiance: As RBX puts it, “Hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go.” But I also see Ferguson, its streets covered in tear gas, its police occupation; a protester in an American flag T-shirt throwing a fuming canister back at tactical officers; paramilitary units convening under a Seasons Greetings banner. I see Baltimore during the Uprising. Protesters standing on ravaged cop cars; bikers in gas masks, fists raised before a wall of officers in riot gear; a convoy of black civilians rolling through the city, arms interlocked. I see fed-up communities crying out—for Freddie Gray, for Mike Brown, for Rodney King, for every act of racist violence unanswered for—taking to the streets, refusing to be ignored. It’s about victory over corrupt law enforcement, however briefly. It’s no wonder that, under the constant antagonism of an aggressive and bigoted police state, the man with a master plan on The Chronic was a nigga with a muthafucking gun: “Cause it’s the city,” Dre explained, “and for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta.” Dre wasn’t a gangsta, per se, but he had gangstas of many different varieties all around him, so his definition of what constituted being one was fluid. Sometimes he was a larger than life mob don, as on “Let Me Ride,” leaving headless bodies on Greenleaf. On the plaintive, Donny Hathaway-inspired “Lil Ghetto Boy,” he plays a street-weary veteran of only 27, a link in a chain of generational violence. His theory of gangsta is clearest and coolest on “Nuthin’ But A G Thang,” a perfect rap song if ever there was one. Together as a united front, Snoop and Dre are swaggering, unfadable. But more than anything, across The Chronic being gangsta is a state of mind; its core tenets: better to strike preemptively than to be caught slippin’ and never let anyone take what’s yours. The Dre verse on “The Day the Niggaz Took Over” prioritizes looting as a weapon against the status quo. His gotta-get-mine perspective is a direct response to the King verdict, and he sounds like an avenging angel. In the essay “Black Riot,” writer Raven Rakia explores looting as a means of indemnification and protest. “Nothing gets the attention of the elite like taking away or destroying what they value above all else: property. In America, property is racial. It always has been,” she explains. “Looting is the opposite of apolitical; it is a direct redistribution of wealth.” The Chronic may be most unmistakably political on this song, but the rest of it understands the spirit (and principles) of black revolt well. How fitting that the album is all about not just getting back what is owed but taking it by force. The confrontational machine gun funk of “Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat” and the sinister squeal of the creeping “High Powered” were emblematic of a territorial mentality. Both Dre and Snoop rapped as if on standby, calm yet poised to strike at a moment’s notice. Many of the album’s best sequences are just them standing their ground. In Daryl Gates’ Los Angeles, this was radical. “Old buster ass nigga talking bullshit/Don’t know that I’m the wrong nigga to fuck with,” Dre barks on “A Nigga Witta Gun.” At Solar, Dre produced on a cutting edge SSL mixing console that producer Rhythm D likened to the Starship Enterprise, which felt particularly fitting since they were making beats by reworking about a dozen Parliament-Funkadelic songs in their sessions. A connection with the Mothership had yielded a magnificent and funky new subgenre. They were building songs from the ground up, according to Wolfe, “drums, bass, keys, guitar, in that order,” with drums and bass being fundamental to their hydraulic, shock-absorbent bounce. Instead of sampling records, as he had for N.W.A, Dre had his live musicians channeling the deep alien grooves of Bernie Worrell and George Clinton. Dre helped to reshape the sound of the West using whining Moog synthesizers. The initial wave of West Coast gangsta rap was (naturally) still indebted sonically to hip-hop’s birthplace, New York City. N.W.A songs sampled Big Apple rappers Whodini and Beastie Boys. AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted was produced by Public Enemy’s team the Bomb Squad, and Cube was “obsessed with” Run-DMC. Many of the West Coast rappers that had come before Dre brought an undeniable California flavor to rap, but there wasn’t yet a distinctive sound separating them from their East Coast predecessors. The Chronic was instrumental in changing all that. The album’s reinterpretation of ’70s P-Funk, dubbed G-Funk, was altogether different. Dr. Dre’s songs moved more leisurely, a tonic for the hustle and bustle of East Coast rap. It’s an oversimplification to say Dre beats sound good, but the man did sell a line of high-performance headphones to Apple for $3 billion on the strength of his music’s supreme fullness and fidelity. He is a production genius. “I used to spend all my time trying to make my beats be mixed as good as Dr. Dre,” Kanye West recently admitted. Q-Tip called Dre the bar for producing A Tribe Called Quest’s The Low End Theory. Dre, in turn, was pushed to match that classic’s resonant bass, and The Chronic set a new mark. In addition to launching Dr. Dre into rarified air, the album launched about a half dozen successful solo careers. It is the nexus of an entire chunk of rap history. Death Row peaked with the February ’96 Vibe cover, more an endnote on an era than anything else; Dre left the company a month later, and by that fall Tupac was dead. In the end, the label Dre built with Suge was just as combustible as the one he left to start it. But The Chronic lives on as a timeless show of strength when the stakes couldn’t have been higher, and as the herald of a tectonic shift in rap. Without it, or Dre, there is no Game, no YG, no Kendrick Lamar or To Pimp a Butterfly, no Nipsey Hussle. Dre gave shape to L.A.’s present and future. His dispatch from inside a city in transition not only furthered its sense of place in the world beyond but helped affect the place it was becoming.

Romance,Camila Cabello,by: Stefanie Fernández,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcbf4f70e83ce0008cbb4f9/1:1/w_160/camila%20cabello%20romance%20cover%20art.jpg,2019-12-14 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/camila-cabello-romance/,SycoEpic,"Love is an ambitious concept and Camila Cabello has spent the latter half of the year testifying that she’s in it. Her second album, Romance, follows the same pristine pop cues of her 2018 debut Camila and imbues them with a vision about love so universalized it blurs it out of focus. There’s love and there’s the performance of it, and Cabello is motivated by both. A Spotify playlist called “The Romance Experience,” interspersed with spoken tracks in which the 22-year-old singer discusses the experiences of love, sex, and heartbreak that inspired the album, sums up the album’s conceit: to explain a familiar experience rather than trust you to feel it yourself. Romance is to romance as Rory Gilmore is to journalism; its depiction is a simple kind of complicated, punctuated with acceptable failures, a simplification that reassures you that your life might be better if you were more beautiful and moral. This illusion is part of Romance’s appeal. And there are many genuine glimpses into Cabello’s experience as a young woman navigating love and sex within that fantasy. She succeeds in tracks that capture love’s fleeting minutiae. “Shameless” begins as a hesitant statement, the flashpoint at which a young woman steps out of herself to embrace love’s abandon. The howl of her refrain—“Show me you’re shameless”—is equally a challenge to oneself as it is to another. By “Cry for Me,” a bright spot on Romance’s fizzling second half, Cabello is long past the point of shameless, leaning into a self-love that demands someone else’s tears in place of her own. The trouble comes when Cabello seems obligated to cover the waterfront of love songs rather than push further on any one feeling. Her effortless “that’s funny” over twinkling acoustic guitar on “Should’ve Said It” feels written for a different project than “Living Proof,” which is driven by the stomping rhythm of stylized female empowerment à la “Fight Song.” Even when motivated by a compelling story, like the guilt of harboring feelings for someone else on “Bad Kind of Butterflies,” the song itself often doesn’t match its pain or power. Though the album’s biggest song, “Señorita,” inhabits Cabello’s real-life relationship with Shawn Mendes, it’s of a piece with 2017’s “Havana,” a similarly Latin-influenced jaunt. Just as the “Havana” video was structured around a regular girl’s dream of starring in a telenovela, “Señorita” stars a waitress who dreams of a bad boy in a leather jacket. But the flirtation at the surface of “Havana” veiled nostalgic romance for a birthplace signaled in each note. “Señorita,” which also appeared on the deluxe version of Mendes’ self-titled album this year, is a harmless gesture toward Latin-ness for exotic effect, rather than a needle-mover. At worst, this impulse results in Ed Sheeran’s “South of the Border,” on which Cabello featured this year: a pastiche of disembodied “Brown eyes/caramel thighs,” misplaced flutes, and Cardi B’s “You never lived until you risk your life” that points to the underlying callousness of the music industry’s embrace of the “Latin” sound. Cabello’s willingness to assist in its caricature elsewhere distracts from the otherwise interesting Spanish-classical and Santana-esque riffs on Romance. The production of Romance is inconsistent. “Feel It Twice” uses gentle minor-key guitar plucking and castanets that allow Cabello’s melody and dynamic voice to fill the space with the hurt of hurting someone else. The R&B ballad “This Love” builds off the kind of lilting ’50s dreamland riff deployed by so many saccharine love songs and repurposes it for a stream-of-consciousness attempt to process an emotionally abusive relationship: “You know how to fuck [pause] me up, then make it OK.” But at 14 songs, the album leaves too much space where Cabello is overshadowed. Even as they are ostensibly meant to show off Cabello’s range, the overproduced “Easy” and “Dream of You” lose her incredibly skilled voice in needless Auto-Tune. (The latter, for instance, shortchanges Camila’s range with a breathy “dree-HEEM” in the chorus, a note she can reach in organic, full soprano.) The closer, “First Man,” is Romance’s outlier: an unpretentious piano ballad dedicated to Cabello’s father that transforms the driveway of her childhood home into a runway to the end of girlhood. It’s the only song on the album that stretches its conception of romance beyond the boy-girl material we’ve heard so many times before, and it’s easily the most emotionally affecting track. By the end of “First Man,” it’s hard not to wish that vulnerability would have arrived sooner. The easy ripple and control of Cabello’s unedited voice and her story as a Cuban-born, first-generation American pop star don’t need an arcane concept to feel complete. But maybe that’s what some romances teach you.

Bad Vibes Forever,XXXTentacion,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee70c729131e0008fba754/1:1/w_160/badvibesforever.jpg,2019-12-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/xxxtentacion-bad-vibes-forever/,EMPIRE,"“You are literally entering my mind,” said XXXTentacion at the beginning of 17, his debut album. On its follow-up, ?, he issued a caveat, insisting listeners must “open their minds” to grasp his vision: “This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last.” Both statements were overblown bids for empathy and acknowledgment from an artist whose notoriety preceded him. He was trying to project that he was more than his pain, more than his worst actions, and experiencing the stylistic sprawl of his music would prove it, allowing listeners to see Jahseh Onfroy as he saw himself. The late rapper makes a similar petition on his second posthumous album, billed as his “final” release. “I’m tryna to tell the world to fucking relax, bro… Let me be a prince, let me be a king, nigga,” he says in a rambling snippet repurposed as the album’s introduction. XXXTentacion’s estate clearly chose this clip to honor and preserve the self-image that the rapper was cultivating when he was shot and killed in 2018 while awaiting trial for domestic abuse charges. But like ? and his first posthumous record, Skins, Bad Vibes Forever fails to make his personal perception and aesthetic ideas cohere into anything other than generic kingmaking. This flimsy, haphazard album attempts to memorialize the rapper as a martyr and renaissance man when he is neither. At his best, XXXTentacion was a reductionist. Favoring blunt, undermixed songs with slapdash structures and high-octane performances, his music turned crudeness into a kind of honesty. In his world, to be broken and distorted was to be real. This approach could approximate intimacy, but the flip side was that it prioritized his “truth” alone, cropping out the world beyond his rage and pain and fizzing into drivel whenever he attempted storytelling beyond “I’m hurt.” As he began to extend himself beyond emo crooning and mosh rap into full-on rock balladry and thrash ragers, his solipsism remained his main tool, resulting in genre-straddling that never amounted to more than cosplay. “He wanted to be the artist that literally conquers all genres,” his manager Solomon Sobonde said. But he’s more tourist than conqueror, a one-man karaoke performance. From the diet dancehall of “Hot Gyal” and “Royalty” to the off-brand Chief Keef-isms of “Eat It Up” to the Cudi hums of “before i realize,” for all his versatility, XXXTentacion largely comes across as rudderless and indistinct. His constant hopscotching reveals no new dimensions to his songwriting, no larger artistic vision. His legacy, as presented by Bad Vibes Forever, is that he used SoundCloud between 2011 and 2018 and he listened to everything, even country. The expansive features list heightens this lack of cohesion, resulting in jumbled songs that treat XXXTentacion like an accent rather than the marquee artist. On “School Shooters,” reportedly recorded as a response to the Parkland shooting, XXXTentacion threatens to drink the blood of school shooters while Lil Wayne empathizes with them, ending with XXX screaming gibberish. They sound like high-schoolers trying to shit-talk their way through detention. The boisterous, swaggering “Voss,” on loan from Sauce Walka’s 2018 mixtape Drip God, feels like a Sauce Walka song, a common problem when XXXTentacion is paired with artists whose versatility is rooted in technique and perspective rather than pantomime. The dark, soul-bearing Kemba verse on “Daemons” so thoroughly outclasses XXXTentacion’s vague occultisms (“Torture victims are due to scripture”) that its appearance feels like a pity offering. It’s never clear what XXXTentacion represents to the artists who show up to support him. Despite their shared Miami origins, Rick Ross mentions XXXTentacion alongside Nipsey Hussle as if reading from a teleprompter list of recently deceased rappers. The Blink-182 feature that closes the album is clearly meant as a nod to XXXTentacion’s love of pop-punk, but the only thing Mark Hoppus seems to know about XXXTentacion is that he died. “Do you still dream about me late at night?/Or are you out there living better times?” he reads from his Cameo inbox. Compared to the atmosphere of grief and loss on January’s Members Only, Vol. 4, recorded by the rapper’s Members Only clique, Bad Vibes Forever feels like a Hallmark card adapted into a tribute concert. This empty mythmaking draws attention to XXXTentacion’s dubious requests for listeners to absolve him of choices and actions he doesn’t even express. He seeks forgiveness without contrition, context, or self-awareness, claiming, “I’m not with the torturing shit” one moment and then boasting, “Dove into the pussy, caught a battery” the next. His desire to be purged through his art is untenable--not just because it’s self-serving and evasive even in absentia, but because his posturing isn’t remotely consistent. His music has never even attempted to address the way his charges of strangulating a pregnant woman, domestic battery, and witness tampering fueled his blustering persona. Of course, a posthumous album will try to flatter its subject, but this album is a hoodwink from start to finish. XXXtentacion as a polyglot is an especially tough sell in an era where border crossing and cross-wiring are standard. It’s hard to square the hollow way Bad Vibes Forever falls back on the aesthetic alibi with the way stronger records from this year, like Denzel Curry’s ZUU, Beyoncé’s Homecoming, and Rapsody’s Eve, use range as a means of refinement. This idea that XXXTentacion was some kind of precocious savant with a natural talent for hybridity (producer John Cunningham claims XXXTentacion is “a far more versatile artist” than 2Pac) ignores the free-wheeling SoundCloud cohort that he was apart of, the rowdy South Florida scene that shaped him, and the broader permeability of contemporary music since average internet bandwidth crossed 1 mbps. Ultimately, the songs XXXTentacion has left behind are insubstantial and narrow, and Bad Vibes Forever only weakens the case that his view of himself was ever a worthwhile lens with which to process his art. His legacy is as defined by his heinous actions as it is by his hamfisted music, and in death, as in life, he makes no attempt to suture that fissure. Why should we?","His purported final posthumous album is more of monument to XXXTentacion’s brand rather than his artistry.

Fine Line,Harry Styles,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df3f10129131e0008fbae41/1:1/w_160/Harry-Styles.jpg,2019-12-13 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/harry-styles-fine-line/,ErskineColumbia,"In a Rolling Stone profile earlier this year, Harry Styles recalled how he kept watching this interview with David Bowie on his phone for inspiration. In the clip, Bowie offers this chestnut about creativity: “Always go a little further into the water than you feel you are capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. When you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.” Styles was invoking his own artistic process, illuminating the lengths to which he hoped to travel on his second solo album, Fine Line. He was also demonstrating the invincible oblivion of even our most charming pop stars. For Styles, Fine Line is the sound of an artist plumbing the abyss. For us, it’s the sound of a celebrity sticking his toes in the sand. It’s ostensibly his freedom record, one that indulges his every musical and psychedelic whim. It is also removed enough from One Direction to finally not be judged in relationship to them (unlike his spare and often lovely self-titled debut from 2017). By corralling a new flock of influences—from ’70s power pop and Laurel Canyon folk-rock to the sort-of soul of Coldplay—Styles showcases his gift for making music that sounds like good music. Which is to say the actual sound of Fine Line is incredible, and most songs have at least one great moment to grab hold of: the clusters of background harmonies on “Golden,” the synth sweeps throughout “Sunflower, Vol. 6,” the strange and alluring pre-chorus on “Lights Up,” a song that embodies Styles’ fluorescent charm, his swagger, his desire to be both weird and adored. He has talked recently about his fear of making music after he left One Direction, the pressure of finding a radio single. But to hear him sing sun-warmed, folk-tinged acoustic rock backed by only a handful of musicians is refreshing. There were easier, more callow roads for him to take. While the music wades into the mystic, his songwriting, pointedly, does not. Fine Line, in part, deals with Styles’ breakup with the French model Camille Rowe, but he renders their romance in the primary colors of needing you, missing you, and remembering you. Emotional beats rise and fall with all the stakes of a refill on a glass of water. Styles doesn’t have the imagination of Bowie or another pop-rock touchpoint here, Fleetwood Mac, who took their lives and transfigured them through cosmic fantasia or Victorian grandeur. Styles’ attempts at this mode worked slightly better on his more austere debut, but in this rainbow-parade of psychedelic pop, the dullness is cast into sharp relief. The same Styles who sang the unforgettable line, “Even my phone misses your call, by the way” just one album ago, can’t muster a memorable flourish, a vivid image, or the same diaristic self-dramatizing wink as Taylor Swift. Instead, feet firmly planted on the shore, Styles simply summarizes and apologizes and reflects as if he were just telling this story to his mates. During the stretch of ballads that comprise the middle third of the album, he sings, “I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch who can’t admit when he’s sorry,” and, “What if I’m someone I don’t want around?” What these earnest text messages reveal about Styles is that he has a desire to do right, to be a good person, or at least to be seen as one. And that’s it—we remain no closer to understanding him as a songwriter or solo artist. The musicians here—including songwriters Kid Harpoon and Jeff Bhasker, producer and multi-instrumentalist Tyler Johnson, guitarist Mitch Rowland, among others—summon a retro live-band sound, no producer tags, no chart-storming aesthetics. But Styles treats them more like a collection of instruments than an actual band, which makes the anonymous two-minute guitar solo at the end of “She” seem pretty meaningless on a Harry Styles solo record. Even more infuriating is “Treat People With Kindness,” an awful chimera of Jesus Christ Superstar and Edgar Winter Group’s “Free Ride” that confuses hand-claps with happiness. Each song is a new outfit for Styles, hoping one will carry his reality-competition voice and illuminate his reality-competition lyrics. There are glimpses, like in “Canyon Moon,” of the sort of intimate connection Styles hopes to forge. It’s one of those running-with-a-kite-down-a-grassy-hill songs, covered in ringing acoustic guitars that evoke his bright smile. “Cherry” rises out of the cliche and into something darker and lasting and Swiftian: “I noticed that there’s a piece of you in how I dress/Take it as a compliment.” Styles is here, buried underneath the fame and the fear. I hear his sweetness, his charm, his elegance. But mostly I hear a guy who’s still afraid he’ll never make a David Bowie record.

Puck,Sean McCann,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcc2dbb0e83ce0008cbb500/1:1/w_160/puck.jpg,2019-12-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sean-mccann-puck/,Recital,"For more than 10 years, Sean McCann has been a purveyor of unabashedly precious ambient music. So sentimental are his works that they could soundtrack euphoric dream states shrouded in soft-hued bliss. Some of his recent albums, Simple Affections in particular, have a childlike wonder to them; they exude the charm of expansive, colorful fantasy worlds. On Puck, McCann continues down this path of evocative storytelling, inviting listeners into a space so soothing that leaving its confines can leave one wistful—like waking up to gray skies after the most comforting slumber. Puck ensnares its listeners with a peculiar assemblage of recordings drawn from his own archives. Dating from between the late 2000s and 2018, McCann’s source material includes chamber works, ambient, and a quaint piece for guitar. They amass into a lively collage that’s as sprawling as it is cohesive: Odd groaning noises and time-stretched samples sit alongside lavish string arrangements. The constant activity prevents listeners from settling into longform drones. Such liveliness is clever: It leads to a hyper-awareness of every instrument’s role, amplifying the richness of every sound and, consequently, song. The album begins with a three-part suite titled “Folded Portraits.” The first track, “Nightfall,” is a fanfare in slow motion, with deliquescent strings and brass interwoven with human voices—there’s singing, but also humming, background chatter, and the clearing of throats. All this vocalizing transforms the piece into a domestic drama; it overflows with a queasiness and nostalgia akin to sound artist Graham Lambkin’s own collage works. More crucial is how McCann toys with the arrangement and mixing to ensure the song is as dense as it is diaphanous: The swirling instrumentation wraps around listeners without being overbearing. “Broth” follows suit, but its longer runtime better demonstrates McCann’s compositional skills. Throughout, musical bibelots and snatches of melody become the central focus, but only for brief moments. Dewy piano chords lead to cartoonish yelps, and on to scratching sounds captured at close range—it’s like a cast of actors rotating the lead role, and the result is the semblance of a musical narrative emerging from the hodgepodge of instrumentation. “Damals” is comparatively bare but nonetheless engrossing: It centers on a manipulated, wavering vocal melody that’s occasionally interjected with piano and voices. Even at their simplest, McCann’s pieces intend to mesmerize. Puck’s whimsicality evokes childhood, especially on the title track. “Puck” fills much of its 21-minute runtime with McCann and sound artist Lia Mazzari reciting found poetry based on Fabergé eggs. They cull from a multitude of sources—recipes, blog posts, news articles—and their reading of the text grants it new meaning. Mazzari’s intonation makes “Puck” sound like a mother reciting a bedtime story. At one point she says, “The family’s only source of ventilation was in the grand duchesses’ bedroom, but peeking out of it was strictly forbidden.” Without looking it up, you might never have guessed that the text comes from the Wikipedia entry on the execution of the Romanov family. Fifteen minutes into the track, we hear snoring amid the sound of pages turning, as if listeners have finally been put to sleep. More than any of McCann’s previous albums, Puck makes the saccharine sublime. The restlessness of these tracks, which are composed of works from throughout the Los Angeles composer’s career, mirrors the feeling of reflecting on adolescence: Scraps of faded memories, both pleasant and upsetting, create a deep longing to re-experience emotions, people, and places. Puck makes evident that looking back can be like entering into a dreamworld of your own making. As McCann forges a path between past and present, between waking and sleeping states, these pieces transcend mere sentimentalism; they transform reminiscence into something hyperreal.","This collage work by the Los Angeles composer weaves together stray chamber compositions, ambient recordings, voices, and more, yielding a mesmerizing sound both dense and diaphanous.

Glacial Pace,Hurt Valley,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df020892c11650008c38864/1:1/w_160/glacialpace.jpg,2019-12-13 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hurt-valley-glacial-pace/,Woodsist,"Woods singer Jeremy Earl launched the Woodsist label in 2006, creating a vehicle to self-release his records and those by likeminded psychedelic-folk explorers: guitarist Cian Nugent, former Woods bassist Kevin Morby, and singer-songwriter Anna St. Louis. A friends-forward approach to a label usually brings together a similar cloth of musicians; there’s sometimes a fine line between Woodsist and Woods-ish. Glacial Pace, the debut album by singer-songwriter Brian Collins as Hurt Valley, is the latest to emerge from Earl’s glen. The record is far less leaden than its title indicates, toeing the Woodsist line more closely than most of his peers. The many instrumental layers belie the fact that Collins self-recorded the project at his home in Los Angeles. His songs are light and loose, built for placid and rudderless afternoons. But Collins’ self-contained efforts sometimes leave little to latch on to as one song slides into the next. The distinguishing factors between folk-adjacent, psychedelically inclined acts tend to lie in what its unique members bring to the fold—the way a bassist and drummer lock together into a groove, the way guitarists interject and weave around each other. By that measure, Collins plays it relatively straight across Glacial Pace, and absent a collaborator’s input, he ends up limiting his own potential. Overdubbed guitar solos complement each other at the end of “No Meaning,” but Collins never reaches for a daring finale—they approach a crescendo and shy away within seconds. Even when he sings about feeling “stuck at a glacial pace” on “Geology Dreamer,” he sounds like he’s unmoved about his predicament in any sense of the word. “Del Amo” is Glacial Pace’s strongest, carried by quiet guitar interludes that make for a curling foil against a hazier backdrop of more guitars. The glimmer on “I’ve Been Everywhere” is a similarly rewarding treat for the ears. Despite the album’s pervasive nonchalance, closing track “Immaterial Worlds” is resolutely un-chill as Collins sneaks in a few final barbs. “You don’t know what it means to speak face to face/You only castigate anonymously,” he sings. “Don’t be afraid to say/I should apologize, when it is right.” He asks to be told when he needs to apologize rather than recognizing when he needs to do it on his own. It’s these moments that feel lasting and impressionable and give his debut a boost: Glacial Pace doesn’t feel destined for cult status or dollar bins, but Collins gives himself plenty of room to explore his sound—and himself—more deeply.

Grime MC,Jme,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df01db929131e0008fba932/1:1/w_160/jme.jpg,2019-12-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jme-grime-mc/,Boy Better Know,"Jme likes to boast that he can make a beat with anything: Logic, Fruity Loops, Sony Playstation, a Nokia phone, even Mario Paint. But after a decade of grinding—selling records, T-shirts, and mobile phone service—the 34-year-old producer and MC can afford better gear. And though his fourth LP proves he’s upgraded his equipment since his school days, Grime MC stays faithful to the history of London’s grime scene. Grime MCs might rap, but heads will be quick to tell you that grime is separate from hip-hop. The genre traces its roots to the UK garage scene, where parties are focused on the floor, not the stage. Jme has been there almost since the beginning—the first Boy Better Know mixtape dropped just a few years after Wiley’s genre-founding “Eskimo” riddim. And the sounds of Grime MC, particularly the beats Jme made himself (“96 of My Life,” “Badman Walking Through,” “Brothers & Sisters”), are in the same vein as those early tracks: Booming bass, vintage drum machines, and sinister synths. While Stormzy and Boy Better Know co-founder Skepta (who’s also Jme’s older brother) flirt with more commercial sounds that have raised the scene’s profile, Jme has remained steadfast. With rowdy beats and BPMs that hover above 140, Grime MC is made for the dancefloor and steeped in the slang and Caribbean patois that permeates London’s underground. Yet for a classicist, Jme appears to defy stereotype. He’s an OG who roots for the kids making UK drill, a vegan teetotaling street rapper, and video game obsessive who produces beats live on Twitch. He’s internet-savvy, but if you want to hear his new record, it’s only available for purchase only on CD or vinyl—no downloads, no streaming platforms. This oppositional stance to current industry norms doesn’t reflect an unwillingness to adapt to modern technology. Rather, Jme understands the flattening effect of DSPs, where Adele lives next to Stormzy who shares playlists with Beyoncé. Grime has always been a subculture, rooted in meatspace. By forcing fans to buy the record direct or from local shops, he puts the onus on the listener to seek him out. And it seems to have worked: Grime MC debuted at No. 26 on the UK Top 40 Albums chart. Weeks after its release, it’s sold out pretty much everywhere. Opting out of the largest and fastest-growing part of the music industry certainly limits Grime MC’s potential ceiling, which is as good an indication of Jme’s goals as anything else. Having watched fellow MCs fall victim to aspirational greed, he rejects the emptiness of excess with the understanding that you can’t take it with you. “When I pass, I’m leaving a lot/Even my own skin has to stay and rot,” he raps on “How Much.” These aren’t the words of a man upset that a lesser talent has climbed higher, but of a man who’s counted his blessings. And why shouldn’t he? At 34, Jme has made the strongest record of his career, chock full of nimble, intricate raps that seamlessly integrate the nerdiest of signifiers. At times, Grime MC feels like a retrospective, a singular statement representative of cumulative efforts. He features some of the biggest names in grime—Skepta, Giggs, and Wiley, to name a few—but outshines them all. His clear diction makes him accessible without watering down his idiosyncrasies, flexing his nerd cred via video game-raps and Star Wars references (“Man are out here gunning for my spot but with the accuracy of a Stormtrooper”). And he’s extremely funny, whether popping off one-liners (“Can’t see me like Japanese porn”) or setting up punchlines about the penises in Michaelangelo’s artwork. In a genre often mired in cliché and gangster tropes, Jme shines as a rapper’s rapper. He’s long experimented with different lyrical styles, but has never quite achieved the level of execution he reaches on Grime MC. He crafts compelling stories, like the no-hook diary entry “96 of My Life”; he toys with clever forms of repetition on “Iss Mad” and “Knock Your Block Off”; and on “You Know,” he fires off a jaw-dropping quatrain imagining himself as a PC’s video card. As UK drill surges in popularity, some may see grime as an old man’s game. But if Grime MC is any indication, the genre—and Jme himself—has yet to reach its creative peak.","The London grime star has made the strongest record of his career, chock full of nimble, intricate raps that seamlessly integrate the nerdiest of signifiers.

Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial,Roddy Ricch,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df01a9129131e0008fba8fc/1:1/w_160/antisocial.jpg,2019-12-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roddy-ricch-please-excuse-me-for-being-antisocial/,Atlantic,"If every hot rapper of the last five years was tossed into a cauldron and stirred together until they were only mildly recognizable, the end product would probably be Roddy Ricch. The 21-year-old Compton-raised crooner can’t decide if he wants to make moody and raw piano-driven street tales like his breakout single “Die Young,” motivational high school basketball warm-up anthems like “Every Season,” or polished and sunny Young Thug-inspired pop songs like his Mustard-produced “Ballin’.” Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial is not the slogan of an Etsy boutique that prints the phrase on Gildan hoodies and caps with adjustable strapbacks, but the title of his debut. The name has nothing to do with his music; it’s just an attempt to manufacture an identity or maybe inspire a few Instagram captions. But say this for Roddy: No matter the trend he’s chasing, he usually wrings a solid song from it. Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial begins in the most cliche way possible—with a “Dreams and Nightmares”-style intro. As soon as the first somber piano key hits and Roddy starts wailing and reflecting on his upbringing, we know exactly where the track is headed, but he hits the marks well, including the intense beat switch, the motivational flex bars, the details about how he overcame the obstacles and secured the bag. It works. So does“Big Stepper,” when he, of course, meditates on the past over an acoustic guitar-sampling instrumental. His storytelling is rote, but gets over on the warmth of the melody. There’s not a flow Roddy Ricch isn’t comfortable borrowing. On “Start Wit Me,” Roddy fills in for Lil Baby as Gunna’s partner in listing fashion brands, a low stakes song that just fills Gunna’s weekly appearance on a major label rap album quota—there’s no way Gunna is keeping track of his features at this point. “High Fashion,” his second collaboration of the year with Mustard, is a Young Thug rip so egregious that it probably could have been generated by an AI, but he sings his heart out, and  the beat that puts a bright West Coast spin on ’90s R&B. The few instances where Roddy breaks free from imitation provide standouts. On “War Baby,” Roddy seamlessly harmonizes with a gospel choir  like the chameleon he is. And on “The Box,” over a hard-hitting beat that sounds like a teapot is boiling in the background, he finds a new delivery and pitch nearly every 10 seconds. The track is the best example of Roddy’s versatility, which has been both a blessing and a curse. Most rappers would sell their soul for his ability to shape his melody to latch onto any relevant sound, but everything here feels so safe. Roddy’s too good a songwriter to settle for being so vapid.","This Compton chameleon borrows flows from anyone and everyone but gets away with it thanks to his sturdy songwriting.

Oderbruch,Shed,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee7c4929131e0008fba78f/1:1/w_160/shed.jpg,2019-12-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shed-oderbruch/,Ostgut Ton,"Outside of Germany, most people likely haven’t heard of the Oderbruch. Situated along the Polish border, this former marshland was first drained during the 18th century by Prussian king Frederick the Great. A century later, the region played host to months of intense fighting at the end of World War II, including one of the Nazi regime’s final stands at the Battle of the Seelow Heights, the war’s biggest conflict on German soil. That same soil is where René Pawlowitz, best known as Shed, was born and raised. His family has been based in the Oderbruch for generations, and Pawlowitz himself continues to split his time between Berlin and this largely rural area in which he grew up. Clearly, he feels a connection with the region, so much so that he’s dedicated his latest full-length to it. Oderbruch is the fifth Shed album, and easily his most colorful. While Pawlowitz’s music has always been heavily rooted in the past—particularly the ’90s house, techno, and rave that soundtracked his teen years—he’s expanded his repertoire here, taking inspiration from nature while venturing into bucolic ambient and dewy-eyed synth swells. It’s an unexpected move from a producer best known for driving techno and cracking breakbeats—not to mention one who’s also always seemed like a relatively serious (if slightly grumpy) figure—but on Oderbruch, Pawowitz sounds downright refreshed. With its fuzzy field recordings and joyous, marimba-like melody—a sound one usually wouldn’t expect to hear in a Shed track—the sprawling “Nacht, Fluss, Grille, Auto, Frosch, Eule, Mücke” (translation: “Night, River, Cricket, Car, Frog, Owl, Mosquito”) feels like a lazy walk alongside a babbling brook. Another beatless cut, the pensive “Der Wolf Kehrt Zurück” (“The Wolf Returns”), is a bit darker, but there’s genuine emotion living inside the song’s creeping synths and lingering patches of static. Even when percussion is brought into the mix, Oderbruch still feels like something new for Pawlowitz. “Das Bruch” pairs a stuttering hip-hop beat with dreamy melodic pads, recalling the blissfully blunted sounds of beat scene stalwarts like Teebs and Nosaj Thing. With its plush—and slightly weepy—strings stretching across its hyperactive frame, “Trauernde Weiden"" might be the album’s most epic moment. In fairness,Pawlowitz’s work as Shed has always varied, and over the past decade-plus, he’s employed upwards of 20 different aliases while exploring different strains of electronic music. However, in the past few years his music has sometimes felt less innovative, mostly because his once-signature style has been so widely imitated. A decade ago, when techno producers everywhere were scrambling to recreate the stereotypical Berghain aesthetic of artists like Ben Klock and Marcel Dettmann, Pawlowitz was something of an outlier. These days, however, electronic music is rife with clever nods to the ’90s, not to mention the slamming, UK hardcore-style breabeats that have populated much of Pawlowitz's work. Perhaps that’s why his last album, 2017’s The Final Experiment, was greeted somewhat unenthusiastically; for many, it was just another Shed record amongst a vast sea of soundalikes. Oderbruch is not just another Shed record. The LP displays a warmer, softer side of Pawlowitz, and while the album is not without its bangers—opener “B1 (Anfang und Ende)” is a dynamic piece of chirping bleep techno, and “Seelower Höhen” is built atop a kick with all the subtlety of a battering ram—even those tracks rely upon lush pads and vivid melodies. “Sterbende Alleen” (“Dying Avenues”) ramps up the melodrama even further while bathing its jungle rhythm in a thick glaze of opulent synths. Although Pawlowitz isn’t known for tugging on heartstrings, he sounds comfortable during Oderbruch’s more cinematic moments. Pawlowitz called his first album Shedding the Past. All these years later, the title still feels a bit ironic, especially coming from an artist whose work, even then, was so thoroughly tied up in his influences. Yet Pawlowitz’s music has never truly been a mere nostalgia exercise. In his mind, history—particularly his own—is just fodder to create something new. It’s undeniably a difficult tightrope to walk, and Pawlowitz had arguably begun to wobble as of late, but Oderbruch seems to indicate that he’s confidently regained his balance. Apparently, all it took was a trip home.","The techno artist discovers a softer, warmer side in an album named for his childhood home.

Ism,Junius Paul,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5df0224f29131e0008fba937/1:1/w_160/ism.jpg,2019-12-12 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/junius-paul-ism/,International Anthem,"Like the mighty jazz bassists that preceded him (Jimmy Garrison, Ron Carter, Peter Kowald, and Buster Williams immediately spring to mind), Junius Paul often makes himself felt before he’s actually heard. That’s him, buoyant and deep, shadowing Makaya McCraven, the perfect complement to the drummer’s rhythms—that is, when he’s not bending, wobbling, and prodding McCraven and group into new terrain. Paul also supports the likes of reedman Ernest Dawkins, Roscoe Mitchell Quartet, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago, where his bass work is as sturdy, supportive, and invisible as rebar. So when the Chicago musician steps to the fore on his massive, sprawling debut, Ism, it’s a thrill to feel and hear every contour, throb, and spontaneous spark across two pieces of wax. Not just an opener, “You Are Free to Choose” serves as a mission statement from Paul and his assembled cohorts, some 14 in all; they leave no rhythmic idea unturned. The chase is everything. The frenetic, skittering rhythms suggest the volatile mix to follow, fully embracing that freedom to not choose, roving from free jazz to post-bop, meditative tone poems to hip-hop thumps (or “badoop” as McCraven put it recently, describing his bandmate’s sound). Recorded over a four-year span in various clubs and studios throughout Chicago, Ism reflects its many homes and the many sounds that feed into the music of the Windy City. Which might sound restless, except Paul exudes such confidence that no matter the session, his bass makes it all hang together. “Bow Hit,” which follows, features Paul’s droning bow work, Isaiah Spencer’s rumbling kit, high tones from Jim Baker’s Arp, and a contemplative solo from saxophonist Rajiv Halim. It approaches stillness only to swan dive into “Baker’s Dozen,” a slippery mix of avant-jazz shot through with head-knocking drums and G-funk frequencies. “The One Who Endures” flips back into charging hard bop, Paul’s upright a flurry of quick-fingered runs. It all leads to “Spocky Chainsey Has Re-Emerged,” a sidelong exploration from a quartet that toggles from modal jazz to fusion, like Bitches Brew set to boil rather than low simmer. About 13 minutes in, Paul lowers the temperature and space opens up for organ and trumpet to cool out. Just when you think it might drift off, turbulence enters, a Sun Ra-like dissonance curls around the edges, and Paul guides the band back up to speed again. “Paris” is the other expansive piece, this time featuring a trio—one of three pieces where Paul is back in step with McCraven. The rhythm section slowly winds around trumpeter Marquis Hill’s unhurried lines, but there’s a tactile thrill when Paul’s stalwart bass coheres into a hummable figure and locks in. McCraven’s snare cracks and the piece achieves liftoff, the three moving at an inspired pace. Yet there’s still another point in the piece when Paul’s bass runs quicken again, somehow finding another plane for everyone else to vibrate on. The last side of the album finds Paul in a more ruminative mode. His strings are in sweet conversation with cellist Tomeka Reid on “Fred Anderson and a Half,” as they pay tribute to the late tenor saxophonist, a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and owner of the Velvet Lounge, where Paul honed his chops weekly. It segues into the most hushed piece on the album, “Ma and Dad,” full of the kind of reverentially small sounds that the Art Ensemble of Chicago plied a half century ago. Listen closely and a strange rumble arises. Is it Paul’s bass? No, just a motorcycle engine idling in the distance before roaring away. But it speaks to Paul’s conjured atmosphere that such an intrusion slots into Ism perfectly.

Island Alchemy,Sofie Birch,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5deff52e29131e0008fba8f7/1:1/w_160/islandalchemy.jpg,2019-12-12 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sofie-birch-island-alchemy/,Constellation Tatsu,"For the better part of the past decade, the Oakland label Constellation Tatsu has put out experimental electronic music in accordance with a simple motto: “adventurous with spiritual artistic sensibilities.” They’ve collected a lot of different sounds under that umbrella—the catalog includes austere drone pieces, downtempo techno, and windswept shoegaze, among a whole lot of other stuff—but most releases are united around a similar disposition. Steven Ramsey, the label’s founder, said that the music is meant to take people outside of their comfort zone, then give them “space to breathe.” Even before Constellation Tatsu released the Copenhagen composer Sofie Birch’s new album Island Alchemy, she has long been a steward of similar ideas about how to approach slow, sad, synth-led music. Both under the moniker Birch and her full name, she’s released pieces that feel complex and studied—full of labyrinthine arpeggiations, collagist textural work, and dizzying melodies—as well as intentionally peaceful and welcoming. Island Alchemy, Birch’s second album of 2019, shows just how engaging this approach can be. The album’s second track, “Myg,” is its longest, and over the course of its 10-minute runtime, kosmische synth arpeggios overlap and intersect with wheezy, stretched-out samples, seasick bass drones, crunchy found sounds, and what might be the distorted ringing of an outgoing phone call. It’s dense but it moves freely from one idea to the next; each layer is a new hook for your brain to latch onto. The record’s shorter pieces aren’t as grand or sweeping, but they offer their own pleasures. As a synthesist, Birch wields a palette that is varied and playful. On “Net (Neverendingthing),” she dabbles in a misty style associated with recent new-age revivalists like Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Emily A. Sprague, along with the tape label Sounds of the Dawn. But elsewhere, her sounds are more unpredictable and otherworldly. “Loph” is both Baroque and surreal; the animated opening harpsichord-like melodies could soundtrack a Saturday morning cartoon, followed by what might be a classical guitar strung with rubber bands. Each individual element feels deliberately colorful and bright, to an overwhelming degree. It’s vibrant in a way that’s almost hard to process, like you’re staring at a Magic Eye poster a mile wide. Ambient music is often heralded for its functional purposes. It is self-consciously soothing; it comes with an implicit invitation to drift away. And Island Alchemy can offer that, if that’s what you’re after. The pieces are paced methodically and meditatively. The melodies are elliptical and hypnotic. But like many Constellation Tatsu artists, Birch seems to have more active listening in mind. You can hear it in the movement and diversity of the sounds she chooses, in the thought put into the way textures overlap. If this is music for dreamers, it’s for the ones who pay close attention to the details in their nighttime reveries, for whom every small moment is full of meaning.","The Copenhagen composer’s second album this year, and her first for Oakland’s Constellation Tatsu, offers a dynamic take on ambient music, one meant for active listening.

HERstory Vol. 1,Mary J. Blige,by: Rawiya Kameir,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e4b7b517ce000899ef3d/1:1/w_160/herstory.jpg,2019-12-11 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mary-j-blige-herstory-vol-1/,,,,,
Echo Earth,Akasha System,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5defc54fb91d230008bf3574/1:1/w_160/echo%20earth.jpg,2019-12-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/akasha-system-echo-earth/,100% Silk,"House music is often thought to belong indoors: in nightclubs, warehouses, dingy basements where sweat drips from the walls. But in Akasha System’s music, the sounds of classic house are oriented outward. The Portland, Oregon producer, aka Hunter P. Thompson, favors titles like “Hawk Country” and “Rain Theme,” and he cites back-country hikes and mossy tree trunks as inspiration for his airy melodies and sturdy basslines. The Pacific Northwest frequently seems to inspire this tendency to infuse electronic textures with a sense of place. Vancouver ambient musician Loscil routinely invokes the local geography in both his titles and his moody, rain-slicked tones; Grouper’s work is inextricable from the fogbanks of the Oregon coast; Portland modular synthesist Ann Annie films her devices in front of picturesque outdoor backdrops. It’s less common to find these kinds of inspirations in dance music of the sort that Thompson makes, in which the steady beat is inextricable from decades of association with the act of dancing—triggering, in effect, a kind of muscle memory. But Echo Earth, much like previous Akasha System albums Vague Response and Temple Images, isn’t really club music, at least not exclusively. One of Thompson’s chief models is Chicago house pioneer Larry Heard, who drew up the blueprint for canonical deep house but also understood that four-to-the-floor pulses weren’t limited to the dancefloor. That was particularly true on albums like 1996’s Alien or 1994’s Sceneries Not Songs, Volume 1, in which placid tracks like “Dolphin Dream” and “Tahiti Dusk” were keyed to new-age frequencies. Echo Earth utilizes a similar palette of softly rounded synths and unadorned drum machines, to similarly wistful ends. Another contemporaneous touchstone is Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works 85-92, in which bold drums and riffs dissolved into pure atmosphere. Akasha System has a similar way of enveloping muscular drum programming in buoyant, jewel-toned chords and synthetic choirs. The Portland musician clearly has an affinity for that era’s left-field dance music: In the opalescent synth tones and flickering micro-rhythms triggered by dub delay, there are also echoes of Sun Electric’s 1996 album Present, which, like Aphex Twin’s record, abandoned rave’s muddy fields for airier, more spacious climes. But if revivalism can be boring, Echo Earth is decidedly not. For all its gentleness, it’s full of motion: His synthesizers are forever in flux, constantly changing timbre and tone color, and his drums are particularly inspired. His kick drums never simply follow the expected path; they jog and leap, dodging the downbeat like a trail runner jumping fallen logs, and his claps and hi-hats are similarly nimble as they pan across the stereo field or ricochet down the delay chain. What appears on the surface to be a simple, unfussy sound—and his tendency to reuse the same palette from track to track lends to that impression—turns out to be remarkably nuanced. Contrast is the secret ingredient: A bright arpeggio trips up the scale, offsetting sustained chords that barely waver; a cowbell clatters across a field of hush, punctuating the stillness like a woodpecker’s insistent staccato. Crisp, cutting textures balance out the soft, wispy tones, keeping them from becoming too diffuse, and vice versa. The closer you peer, the more Akasha System’s seemingly uncomplicated music turns out to be something like an interdependent system, a dynamic landscape of give and take. It can be tricky, of course, when the artist sets the terms like this: Would you have detected the presence of old-growth forests and mountain streams in the music if Thompson hadn’t titled these tracks things like “Meadow Walk” and “Spirits of the Lake”? Maybe not, but it hardly matters. Like a walk in the woods, Echo Earth clears the head and sharpens the senses.

Pleaser,Georgia Maq,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5defd92b29131e0008fba8f0/1:1/w_160/pleaser.jpg,2019-12-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/georgia-maq-pleaser/,Run for Cover,"Not long after recording Camp Cope’s 2018 barn-burning second album How to Socialise and Make Friends, lead singer Georgia McDonald decided to stop screaming. Her rousing delivery elevated the Melbourne band’s songs to fevered peaks; on tracks like “The Opener,” McDonald bemoaned the misogynist music industry with irony and venom dripping from her voice. Before recording her solo debut, the singer took voice lessons to soften her singing and sound more like she’d always wanted to sound. “Instead of just yelling, I’m trying to actually make something that sounds beautiful to me,” she said in a recent interview. “There’s no angry screaming about anything anymore.” Pleaser, the first record McDonald has released on her own as Georgia Maq, strays far from Camp Cope. She places her voice in an almost entirely synthesized milieu, a dramatic shift facilitated by producers Katie Dey and Darcy Baylis. The album’s subject matter suits its new dressings: Instead of singing about politics or family, or the complex and sometimes destructive bonds between friends, McDonald focuses on romantic love and self-love, romance’s quiet counterpart. She aims for pop bliss, but her melodies, which tend to be simple and reiterative, don’t let her lift off. Most of the production fine-tunes ’80s pop techniques to 21st-century ends. The pearly leads and bright, expressive snare on “Driving Blind” sound siphoned from Body Talk-era Robyn, while “You’ll Be Singing My Name,” one of the record’s livelier cuts, adopts a bouncy piano backdrop that echoes the instrumentation on Lorde’s “Green Light.” With its binaural synth strobe and melancholy vocal lines, “Like a Shadow” could be mistaken at first listen for one of the moodier tracks off Caroline Polachek’s recent solo debut. McDonald has no regrets about leaving her punk roots in the dust, but her voice can sound slack against its newly airless environment. She’s ironed out the particulars of the singular and commanding voice she cultivated with Camp Cope and hasn’t tailored herself a new set of idiosyncrasies, leaving a blankness at the center of her singing. Many of the best pop songs begin with a familiar backdrop and then electrify it with a surprising twist, eliciting joy from the shock of the unexpected. Robyn’s chorus melodies begin simply and then surge away from their starting points; Lorde’s Melodrama lives and dies on its often jarring chord progressions; and Carly Rae Jepsen sings herself into a breathless frenzy by the end of every track. McDonald’s first foray into synth-pop sets its sights on similar highs, but rarely takes the risks needed to achieve them. Compositionally, there’s more setup than payoff; choruses tend to consist of just a few notes, with little development and even less surprise. Camp Cope’s albums established McDonald as a powerful frontperson and lyricist, and while her presence does often feel blunted on Pleaser, her knack for clever lines still surfaces. “At least I built the hill on which I’ll die,” she sings on “Away From Love.” On the scuttling closer “Big Embarrassing Heart,” she overturns a romantic cliche: “I will run to you with open arms and only hold myself.” She belts the line with enough conviction to make it sound like a happy ending, a testament to self-sufficiency. In moments like these, where McDonald loosens her reservations and surrenders to the full impact of her voice, the spark she’s always nurtured shines through.","The lead singer for the barn-burning punk act Camp Cope shifts into synth-pop and romantic love for her solo debut.

Blood Transfusion EP,Kelsey Lu,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5defcc73b91d230008bf3576/1:1/w_160/kelsey.jpg,2019-12-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kelsey-lu-blood-transfusion-ep/,Columbia,"Singer-songwriter Kelsey Lu makes dense, baroque music that seamlessly fuses pop, electronic, and R&B. Her earliest work was built from mournful cello loops and vocals that crackled with electricity, making it feel like you were discovering her music in a dimly lit living room every time. But on her debut album this year, she filled out her sound with guitar, piano, and touches of synthesizer. She has pushed even further outward with Blood Transfusion, an EP in which a diverse cast of remixers brightens and accelerates her songs, most of them from her debut album. These six producers take vastly different approaches to Lu’s music. From German DJ Dixon’s deep house to Omar S’ techno to two distinct takes on “Due West,” the songs establish an array of sounds and moods. A club mix of “Shades of Blue,” Lil M (aka frequent Fade to Mind designer Miles Martinez), fragments and repeats staccato, glittery slivers of words and exclamations, gleaning new textures rather than meaning from them. Lafawndah’s remix of “Due West” similarly layers fragments of phrases, albeit longer snippets, as sonic building blocks, focusing largely on the soaring titular phrase. By repeating the most intense moments of the song, the remix magnifies and extends the euphoria that was previously reserved for the chorus. By contrast, Skrillex’s remix of the same track builds upon much of the song’s structural integrity—unsurprising, as Skrillex produced the original as well. It’s a new look for the former EDM troublemaker: The song leans into Lu’s sedated croons with a murky mix of sparse percussion and churning synth that’s more hypnotic than frantic. These remixes generally cut to the chase faster than the originals. Curved, elongated choruses transform into chants that stomp through your brain, immediate and unrelenting. On Detroit producer Omar S’s remix of “Poor Fake,” the contrast feels productive and exciting. Where earlier, the song was buoyed primarily by strings, on the remix, Lu’s chopped vocals thrillingly trip and sputter over grating synths. The slight electronic flourishes that already existed in the song transition seamlessly here. On her debut, Lu’s husky, symphonic vocals and dramatic lyricism imbued her music with a mythological quality, as if plucked from a fairy tale. But the details of Lu’s voice and the stories she tells are often lost in these remixes. Though her falsetto peeks through on Omar S’s “Poor Fake” rework and Dixon’s “Why Knock for You” remix, her expansive, exploratory crooning and quaint production flourishes—like the fluttering bird calls sampled on “Due West” and “Kindred”—are largely buried under layers of distorted percussion and synth. Though Lil M’s “Shades of Blue” remix is exciting as a standalone piece, it’s hard not to miss the original’s gorgeous lyrics about love and longing. More than anything, Blood Transfusion exhibits the range and potential of Lu’s sound. Some of these songs lack the vulnerability and immediacy of her earlier, stripped-down pieces, and it would be nice to see more of that emotional weight brought to these fast-paced, rhythm-heavy tracks. Nonetheless, it’s remarkable hearing her work stretched from hushed string arrangements to synth-forward mixes, from your living room to the club. And it’s exciting to think of the doors this EP opens up—the spaces and sounds she has yet to occupy.","The Los Angeles singer-songwriter’s music gets a beat-oriented makeover in a collection of remixes from Skrillex, Omar S, Lafawndah, and other club producers.

MTV Unplugged Live in Melbourne,Courtney Barnett,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de94eab9669180008bb66a1/1:1/w_160/barnett.jpg,2019-12-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/courtney-barnett-mtv-unplugged-live-in-melbourne/,Milk!,"Courtney Barnett has made her discomfort with pedestals clear. Even as the music press has heralded her as an icon, a wunderkind, the voice of a generation, she’s always worked to foster a second, quieter reputation as a humble collaborator. Fittingly, her appearance on MTV Unplugged functions not as a career retrospective, but a showcase for the community she’s cultivated. Of the eight songs in this set, only four see Barnett performing her own songs solo. Her focus remains fixed on the friends and artists who inspire her, providing powerful context for her creative mission. Take, for instance, “Nameless, Faceless.” In the song’s original iteration, on 2018’s Tell Me How You Really Feel, Barnett delivered glib verses with her tongue pressed firmly against her cheek—a jarring juxtaposition against the chorus’s dead-serious threats of rape and femicide. In this performance, Barnett enlists friend and labelmate Evelyn Ida Morris as a duet partner, slows the arrangement to a crawl, and adds a chilling piano line. These adjustments don’t elevate the track as much as clarify its purpose. As the piano descends its minor scale, the impotent internet trolls of the verses mutate, by the chorus, into material threats to women’s lives. The addition of Morris’ voice steels Barnett’s own, turning the song’s wry spin on an Atwood quote into a sincere expression of collective fear. Equally revelatory is a cover of “Charcoal Lane,” the title track from the debut solo album of indigenous Australian singer-songwriter Archie Roach. It’s a near-certainty that Barnett’s North American fans are unfamiliar with Roach, best known for his 1990 single “Took the Children Away.” As infants, Roach and tens of thousands of aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families and placed in orphanages. Many were physically and sexually abused, and many more, including Roach, struggled with mental illness, poverty, and addiction. Dueting on “Charcoal Lane” with Paul Kelly, a longtime friend and creative partner of Roach, Barnett pays tribute to Roach while placing her own success on the same map as his suffering. When Barnett performs alone, it’s clear she’s put great care into rearranging these songs for the Unplugged format. Each song gets an update that foregrounds some previously buried quality—like the low hum of camaraderie that warms “Sunday Roast,” or the bouncy violins that lighten the medical emergency of “Avant Gardener.” These renditions are distinct enough from Barnett’s well-loved recordings that fans will no doubt return to them. On the unreleased song “Untitled (Play It On Repeat),” Barnett’s voice cracks to engaging, expressive effect, but on “Not Only I,” a duet with New Zealand crooner Marlon Williams, she’s a poor match against his buttery baritone. One musician who does complement Barnett’s gifts as both singer and songwriter is Leonard Cohen. Her set’s closer, a jubilant “So Long, Marianne,” places her voice in a nest of other voices, backing her up in soft harmony as she bids her audience adieu. When the time comes to say goodbye, when the pedestal crumbles and the bulbs in the spotlight burn out, she’ll be fine. She’ll be among friends.","The Australian singer-songwriter uses the Unplugged format as a showcase for the community of musicians she’s cultivated.

Melly vs. Melvin,YNW Melly,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee73e9b91d230008bf341f/1:1/w_160/melly.jpg,2019-12-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ynw-melly-melly-vs-melvin/,300,"YNW Melly isn’t the first rapper to release an album while in jail awaiting trial for murder, but he may be the first accused of killing his own crewmates. Last October, Florida prosecutors allege, Melly and rapper YNW Bortlen shot and killed two fellow YNW rappers then staged the crime scene to make it appear like a drive-by. Melly, who surrendered himself to police in February and faces life in prison or the death penalty, has maintained his innocence and continues to carry on his rap career as best he can. But judging by the relative silence that’s greeted his debut album Melly vs. Melvin, his commercial prospects may be almost dire as his legal ones. Melly vs. Melvin has a difficult public-relations needle to thread, presenting a portrait of a teenager who definitely didn’t do what the prosecutors have accused him of but also, you know, totally could have. “I’m a slimeball and I’ll admit it,” he raps on the opener “Two Face,” pinning his transgressions on an alternate personality. The record’s cover quite literally depicts those two faces, one sweetly boyish and looking no older than his 20 years, the other considerably more hardened. It’s a powerful concept, evoking the dueling images that the media often uses to depict young black men and suggesting how easily their portrayals can be spun. It’s a shame the idea is wasted on an album as superficial as Melly vs. Melvin, which pads Melly’s precious few original ideas with second-rate material and third-rate Young Thug-isms. Since Melly’s been behind bars for most of the year, it’s unclear when this material was recorded. The murder allegations are never specifically mentioned, yet several songs vaguely create the illusion that he’s addressing them. “Can you hear me, father? Can you please send me some signs?/I’ve been going through some things, there’s been a lot on my mind,” he pleads on “Waitin on You,” along with a pledge to keep praying. Melly’s contrition isn’t especially convincing, however, nor is he effective at engendering sympathy. It doesn’t help that his default persona is downright sour. He directs “Suicidal” to the “stupid bitch” who “took my heart and made it bleed.” On “Stay Up” he offers this peevish retort: “Bitch, I ain’t mentally challenged.” Twice he berates women in his life for having had, or having considered, an abortion. On his previous projects, including January’s considerably more enjoyable We All Shine, Melly distinguished himself from his many SoundCloud variants with a ’90s R&B influence that he employed on his most sumptuous songs. But aside from a few outliers like “Bang Bang,” which samples the Nelly/Akon/Ashanti track “Body on Me,” and “Nobody’s Around,” which slows things down with a bit of an R&B bump, there isn’t much of that spirit here. Melly began the year as a rising star sharing a video with Kanye West, but even morbid curiosity and the sordid details of his case haven’t done much to sustain the public’s interest in him, and assuming that Melvin is the best music he had left in the vault, that doesn’t bode well for his prospects, either.","The incarcerated rapper, awaiting trial for murder, releases an album of second-rate material and third-rate Young Thug-isms.

But both native sons are branches of the same musical tree. Humberto Hernandez knows that nexus well. Working at Detroit’s legendary Buy Rite record store, he would play Jay Dee’s early beat tapes in the shop and dare co-worker Dixon to bust moves to them. Using the handle DJ Dez, Hernandez was the DJ for Yancey’s group Slum Village, but he also dropped soul-flecked house tracks as Andrés on Dixon’s labels KDJ and Mahogani Music. Like his more revered peers, Hernandez is encyclopedic in his knowledge of the African American pop vernacular, be it obscure deep soul, smooth jazz, or roller-rink standards. Catch one of his sets and you can hear Andrés confidently traversing these genres and more at a dizzying clip. His previous albums were just as dynamic, spinning like a restless radio dial and never staying on one sound for long. Coming eight years after his last album, Andrés IV captures all of the above while catching him at a professional peak, coming off a run of singles that was among the decade’s most pleasurable. Across the first four tracks, Andrés toggles between percolating Brazilian and Cuban grooves, ethereal vocal R&B, and soul jazz. On “Mighty Tribe,” he lifts snatches from Doug Carn’s jubilant “Mighty Mighty” and a Motown dancefloor classic, twines them together, and then sends them soaring. Hear him chop what might otherwise be a coherent phrase into seductive gibberish on “Truth Serum” and the lineage connecting him to both Dilla and Moodymann becomes clear: Andrés cuts through an otherwise familiar groove to find something tantalizing and novel in its depths. And on “Waist Deep,” the way he flips the overly familiar Parliament classic “(Not Just) Knee Deep” is akin to hiking a well-trodden path in a handstand. In 2012, Andrés inaugurated his own La Vida label with “New for U,” an anthem built from little more than a gorgeous garland of Philly disco strings, one-note Rhodes throb, and a tough house kick drum. Simple and elemental, it would go on to become one of the decade’s most delectable dancefloor cuts, selling out multiple pressings and introducing Andrés to an audience well outside of Detroit. It’s included here, but to say that nothing else on the album approaches its heights would be unfair, since little from the last decade of dance music does. A live version of the song adds a few more wrinkles and Andrés’ own drumming, but it feels unnecessary. He comes closest to matching the resplendent “New for U” with “Free,” a celebratory house number that rides an echoing gospel organ, tapped hi-hat, and buttery group harmonies. You can imagine it being a crowd-pleaser no matter the occasion: skate-rink birthday party, club night, or wedding reception. Later tracks veer into 132 BPM club fare (“Learn 2 Love”) and screwed-down hip-hop instrumentals (“Run Dat Shit”), highlighting his versatility more than his mood-building. But for most of IV, Hernandez makes clear that he’s a vital part of Detroit’s musical lineage.","Eight years after his last album and seven since the crowd-pleasing “New for U,” the Detroit house and hip-hop staple shows off his encyclopedic knowledge of soul, disco, and Latin music.

But Jeff Rosenstock and Laura Stevenson’s EP of Neil Young tunes is more concerned with how we introduce others to the music we love. Still Young reimagines four selections from Young’s six-decade career, blowing up some of his simplest songs to a size more suited to Rosenstock and Stevenson’s punk background. It’s a compact document of two friends sharing and reinterpreting music with total freedom—a warm, unpretentious record that serves as an unlikely Neil Young primer. Rosenstock and Stevenson go way back: As teenagers, they palled around the same Long Island punk scene, and they’ve played in each other’s bands on-and-off for years, most notably the defunct group Bomb the Music Industry! Their individual histories with Young’s music have been less aligned. “I knew I was supposed to like Neil Young but a lot of the ‘standards’ admittedly are not for me,” Rosenstock says in the EP’s liner notes. Stevenson, meanwhile, says she’s heard Young’s music at home for as long as she can remember. Eventually, Rosenstock caved and asked Stevenson for a Neil Young starter pack. Apparently it did the trick: Still Young is seemingly the first in a series of cover EPs as a duo. Given their lengthy friendship, it’s no surprise that Rosenstock and Stevenson are a great pair. Stevenson’s voice is light and clear—a perfect foil to Rosenstock’s crackling, conversational whine, itself a marked contrast from his customary shout. Their vocals on “Harvest Moon” are not unlike Young’s duet with Linda Ronstadt in the original. Rosenstock and Stevenson’s take on the song is fairly straightforward, though subtle snare replaces the barroom “broom sweeps” of Young’s original, and the addition of vibraphone and droning guitar give the familiar melody a little tooth. “Through My Sails” (taken from Zuma, Young’s 1975 LP with Crazy Horse), gets the most pared-back treatment, layering harmonies over a simple structure of acoustic guitar and bass. Sandwiched in the middle of Still Young are two amplified interpretations that some may not immediately recognize as Neil Young songs. The 1970 piano ballad “After the Gold Rush” receives a glowing synth riff and multi-tracked vocals that resemble a late-’80s pop-punk Christmas carol. “Ambulance Blues,” from Young’s 1974 LP On the Beach is another maximalist take on an austere song, and it’s easily the EP’s best offering. Where Young’s original featured muted harmonica and fiddle, Rosenstock and Stevenson stack on drones, keys, and wailing guitar. There’s even a faint siren in the distance—a bit on-the-nose, but fitting for two New Yorkers who’ve surely heard thousands in their lives. Another pal, the Hold Steady’s Craig Finn, appears near the end to deliver a terse, gravelly cameo: “There ain’t nothin’ like a friend who can tell ya you’re just pissin’ in the wind,” he drawls. Rosenstock and Stevenson may have recorded Still Young just for the hell of it, but they’ve managed to uncover the best possible outcome of imposing one’s musical tastes on loved ones.","Two friends—one a longtime Neil Young fan, one a relative newcomer—team up for a warm, unpretentious covers EP that serves as an unlikely primer.

We Are Beat Happening,Beat Happening,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddd8609c43b7100080dd6cd/1:1/w_160/beathappening.jpg,2019-12-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beat-happening-we-are-beat-happening/,Domino,"In 1979, a 17-year-old music nerd named Calvin Johnson made a revelatory discovery. “I know the secret: rock‘n’roll is a teenage sport, meant to be played by teenagers of all ages—they could be 15, 25, or 35,” he wrote in a letter to the punk magazine New York Rocker. “It all boils down to whether they’ve got the love in their hearts, that beautiful teenage spirit.” As a preternaturally music-savvy high schooler in Olympia, Washington, Johnson had a show on KAOS-FM, a community radio station hosted by Evergreen State College which had a strict rule that at least 80% of all records played on-air must be independent. He filled his slot with bands that prioritized idiosyncratic passion over technical ability such as Young Marble Giants, the Raincoats, and the Slits. In 1980, Johnson enrolled at Evergreen, a small public liberal arts school with no majors or grades that attracted the kind of inquisitive minds who created and collaborated nonstop. Johnson’s upstairs neighbor during his freshman year at Evergreen was Heather Lewis, an aspiring artist from affluent Westchester County in New York. Lewis—who had never played in a band before—accepted an offer to play drums in a group called the Supreme Cool Beings in the summer of 1982. Inspired by fellow Evergreen student Bruce Pavitt’s Subterranean Pop fanzine and cassette imprint, Johnson had founded a home record label called K (Johnson has said that K stands for knowledge, but also that it’s “unclear why the name is K”). The Supreme Cool Beings’ 1982 Survival of the Coolest cassette—recorded live on Johnson’s KAOS show—was K’s first release. The following year, Lewis and Johnson started playing together and after a few lineup changes, Johnson invited recent Olympia transplant Bret Lunsford—who had never played guitar before—to join the band that would be renamed Beat Happening. The punk and underground music Johnson discovered as a teenager was driven by independence, egalitarianism, and an urge to destroy life’s rulebook. Beat Happening stripped away these philosophies until only the most elemental parts remained. They used yogurt containers for a drum kit, a thrift store guitar with no amp, and rebuffed the bass entirely. At live shows, they frequently switched instruments, if they had them at all. “Our attitude was if people don’t let us borrow drums then we can go grab a garbage can or a cardboard box and that will do,” Lunsford says in Micahel Azerrad’s book Our Band Could Be Your Life. While punk was presumably loud, fast, and aggressive, Beat Happening, with their instrumental amateurism, unintimidating appearance, and unabashedly sentimental lyrics, were provocative by simply existing. It was an unintentional sort of defiance. “We just didn’t have a choice,” Johnson said years later. “We made music that we made—and that’s just the way it is. We were always working to the edge of our abilities.” Beat Happening was music at its purest. We Are Beat Happening, a new vinyl box set that collects all of the bands’ records in one place for the first time since 2002, is a crucial step in recognizing the trio’s seismic influence. Though Beat Happening are frequently written off as cloyingly twee (which, to be clear, should not be an insult), in truth, the band created a crucial link between the minimalist experimentations of post-punk and Riot Grrrls’ demystification of perfection. By disrupting the status quo concept that music must be polished, practiced, and public, Beat Happening helped crack open a world for new voices. In 1985, Beat Happening released their self-titled debut, a declaration of their undefined, instinctive, and fearless nature. As Johnson sings on “Youth,” one of the group’s earliest recorded songs, “When you’re young you can afford to be bold.” Drifting between barely-there lo-fi ballads and ’60s jangle-pop ditties, Beat Happening is unconsciously rule-free. The band’s name, which originated from an Evergreen student film called Beatnik Happening, could not have been more appropriate: In Beat Happening songs, a rhythm organically materializes. Vocal responsibilities bounce between Johnson’s booming, buffoonishly sexy baritone—which more than makes up for the lack of an actual bass—and Lewis’ unaffected candor, which propels the band’s more hook-driven songs. As she implores listeners to “open up your eyes and speak your mind” on the opening song “Foggy Eyes,” Lewis crashes through walls of hesitancy with every word. The record’s bright yellow cover with a stick-figure cat riding a rocketship indicates that the music inside is childish. And sure, there’s plenty of wide-eyed whimsy throughout Beat Happening: the beachside dance party and picnic hosted by Mr. Fish in “Down At the Sea”; the singsongy “Fourteen” where Johnson struggles to speak while he and his crush feed a pet rabbit some cabbage; the tambourine-driven “Our Secret” where forbidden lovers express their undying devotion over cups of tea. The charming activities outlined in the band’s music were reflective of their lives in Olympia. They had slumber parties, made Super 8 films, and lived simply. In many ways, Beat Happening was three twentysomethings performing the affectations of innocence. But for all their pseudo-naivete, the band’s music can be strangely sexual, like a teenager caught between the mysteries of adulthood and the comforts of childhood. The nearly a capella “In Love With You Thing” begins with Johnson lamenting an unrequited romance and kicking himself over his bashfulness. Suddenly his creaky wooden voice softens and he admits a hankering to touch a woman’s “parted lips” and “swinging little hips.” On the barebones “Look Around,” Johnson stares down a girl before deciding to “come between her thighs.” The most overtly sexual moment arrives on “Christmas,” a bumpy little track which appeared on a 1996 expanded edition of Beat Happening. It starts with a deadpan admission: “I had sex on Christmas/I had sex three times today/Three different women taught me how to be bored/In their own separate sweet little ways.” These moments of carnal desire stand in stark contrast with the record’s prevailing sense of polite swooning. While Bruce Springsteen was on the radio likening his desire to being set aflame, Beat Happening preferred small and private pleasures of all sorts. Beat Happening’s debut was initially just a drop in the ocean, adored mostly by their small but supportive community in Olympia. But through Johnson’s connections in the fanzine world, the record eventually caught the ear of Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis, who would release Beat Happening in Europe in 1986. While this led to a swell of positive foreign press, the re-release also exposed the band to like-minded indie-pop contemporaries like the Pastels, Talulah Gosh, and the Vaselines. Three years later, they made their darker and more abrasive second album, Jamboree. It opens with Johnson spellbound by a woman whose heart is “black as tar” to the point of single-minded delusion. His almost-frightening obsession marks a drastic change from Beat Happening’s debut, where Johnson was more likely to accept rejection with his tail between his legs than pursue romance so doggedly. On the caustic closer “The This Many Boyfriends Club,” he implores a young woman to ditch the dudes who fawn over her; he’s indignant that they think of her as an object rather than a person in her own right. But for all its grit and angst, Jamboree is still driven by an underdog’s romanticism. The record’s most beloved track, the lethargic, wistful “Indian Summer,” clings to the promise of forever in the face of looming heartache. “Breakfast in cemetery/Boy tasting wild cherry/Touch girl, apple blossom/Just a boy playing possum,” Johnson murmurs, letting the delicate romance of each image melt in his mouth. Though Lewis’ vocal role here is more understated than on Beat Happening, her scrappiness leads to one of the record’s highlights. “In Between” is a charged blast of three-chord pop and it offers one of the most profound, utterances in Beat Happening’s catalogue: “And I remember when my parents met/It was years before my birth/And I can see them years from now/Their ghosts fly above the earth.” While Jamboree was delayed by time off and physical distance between the bandmates, Beat Happening went on to release a steady stream of records for the next four years. Their third, 1989’s Black Candy, is undeniably the band’s spookiest and most sexually-charged album. While things begin pleasantly enough with the chipper Johnson-Lewis duet “Other Side,” their dreams of running away to a cozy shack and living off “bread crusts and lemon rind” are quickly extinguished by the ominous title track. “Jackhammer, can’t stand her/Can’t live unless I have her/Sin dribbling down my chin,” Johnson darkly intones. “Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive” is not the innocent bumblebee sleepover the title suggests. Over Lunsford’s spiky guitar, Johnson unleashes a horrifying Kama Sutra of insect innuendo: “Yellowjacket buzz let’s honey do/I’ll lie down on top of you/Gonna split this womb in two.” Even its most warm-hearted track, “Cast a Shadow,” is sullied by a dark specter of a lover who can only be seen in dreams. Following the release of Black Candy, Beat Happening headed out on tour with punk heroes Fugazi; Johnson had befriended the band’s founder Ian MacKaye years before in Washington D.C. and the two artists regarded each other as contemporaries who shared ethics about DIY culture, independent labels, and affordable, all-ages shows. Beat Happening’s rejection of macho aggression as a core tenet of punk was bewildering and infuriating to some Fugazi fans, who wanted to crash into each other in the pit, not watch an awkward crooner squiggle his hips, rub his tummy, and sway like a drunk puppet. But the backing of Beat Happening by scene authorities like MacKaye signaled that punk is not a sound or a style, but a spirit of rebellion against norms of all sorts. In 1991, Beat Happening released their fourth record, Dreamy, with Sub Pop, who were riding high off the grunge explosion. After the B-movie pulp spookiness of Jamboree and Black Candy, Dreamy returns to the vulnerability of the trio’s debut. But after six years playing together, Beat Happening’s technical ability had de facto improved in almost every way. Paired with Steve Fisk’s polished production, Dreamy is Beat Happening’s most cohesive record and their best-kept secret. Opener “Me Untamed” confronts a similar drunk in love sentiment as Jamboree opener “Bewitched” but this time Johnson chooses smoldering earnestness instead of force. “Who’s gonna love me the way that I am,” he solemnly asks on the gentle “I’ve Lost You.” Lewis’ songs are equally introspective and tender, especially “Left Behind” in which she summarizes romantic differences with serene precision: “You want more things, I got my own way.” Dreamy’s easygoing harmony confirms that Beat Happening’s creative puzzle pieces had found their proper places. Several months after the release of Dreamy, Johnson and his K Records partner Candice Pedersen organized the International Pop Underground Convention, a six-day gathering in Olympia that celebrated self-invention and underground music. While the convention featured a hodgepodge of activities from performances by Beat Happening and Bikini Kill to screenings of Planet of the Apes, its most influential offering was Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now, aka “Girl Night.” This opening night showcase featured Heavens to Besty, Tobi Vail, Bratmobile, a pre-Tiger Trap Rose Melberg, and more. While women like Vail, Lois Maffeo, and Kathleen Hanna were already mighty voices in the Olympia underground, “Girl Night” galvanized a younger generation and the burgeoning Riot Grrrl revolution transformed Beat Happening and K’s DIY ethos into a worldwide call to arms. Though they continued to write songs about the mysteries of love and death, Beat Happening’s fifth and final record, 1992’s You Turn Me On, feels removed from their ramshackle beginnings. Produced by Fisk and Young Marble Giants’ Stuart Moxham, the trio wander into dream-pop territory and idle in the drowsy glow of someone just awakened from an afternoon nap (one track is literally called “Sleepy Head”). The nearly-seven minute opener “Tiger Trap” is a slow-burning opus in the vein of Galaxie 500. “Godsend” burrows into a lush daze with Lewis’ multi-tracked murmur repeating “It’s just the things you do/You make it true/You’re a godsend” over and over across nine-and-a-half minutes. Perhaps Beat Happening fans who only listen to their 1985 debut assume that the trio never surpassed their unsophisticated beginnings, but You Turn Me On proves that by their end, the band evolved into something far more refined than anyone would have expected. Technically, Beat Happening never broke up. They simply went separate ways and focused on other projects. Johnson continued building K into a beloved indie mainstay and released music under the monikers Dub Narcotic Sound, the Halo Benders, and his own name. Lewis continued to pursue visual art; her minimalist sketches appear on a majority of Beat Happening’s album covers and her naturalistic paintings of rabbits adorn the We Are Beat Happening packaging. For a decade Lunsford owned the beloved Anacortes record shop The Business and encouraged a new generation of artists, including Phil Elverum, to create art and community through whatever means were available. In 2003 they released Music to Climb the Apple Tree By, a collection of b-sides and rarities recorded between 1984 and 2000, but since 1992, Beat Happening’s music has been left to quietly inspire. Over the past two decades, Beat Happening helped provide a blueprint for countless musicians looking to pave their own path. Kurt Cobain, who listed Jamboree as one of his favorite records of all time, got a K tattoo as a reminder “to stay a child.” Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker were individually blown away by the band’s simple set up and felt empowered to start a two-guitar-one-drum band. As Bandcamp became a tool for anyone looking to share their bedroom musical doodles, there was an outburst of young musicians inspired by Beat Happening. The most prominent of these modest yet singular voices Frankie Cosmos, who has said that listening to Beat Happening helped catalyze her to begin writing music. “Beat Happening will never get old,” she told Pitchfork in 2015. “It’s similar to Frank O’Hara—you can hear the voice so strong in the writing.” The teenage spirit Calvin Johnson once unearthed springs eternal.

To Magnetize Money and Catch a Roving Eye,Jim O’Rourke,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de818579669180008bb655a/1:1/w_160/tomagnetizemoney.jpg,2019-12-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jim-orourke-to-magnetize-money-and-catch-a-roving-eye/,Sonoris,"For more than a quarter century now, Jim O’Rourke has been sculpting shadows. For some, the American musician is best known for the lush, psychedelic Americana of albums like Bad Timing, or his production work for bands like Wilco, Stereolab, and Sonic Youth. (He was also a member of the latter for a spell, during the Murray Street and Sonic Nurse years.) But since the early 1990s, beginning with albums like Scend and Disengage, the secret heart of O’Rourke’s music has been dedicated to pure electronic abstraction. To call this minimalist output “ambient” or even “drone” doesn’t capture the subtleties of his broad expanses of shimmer and hum. Listen carefully to these pieces, and it sometimes seems that he is molding feedback into storm clouds, or milking frequencies out of thin air. In recent years, O’Rourke’s drone activities have begun to assume center stage. His practice appears intense, even monastic: He typically devotes five or six hours a day to recording on the Serge, an arcane modular synthesizer from the 1970s; he might spend weeks editing a given session down, mixing it with homemade field recordings, and massaging it all into the desired shape. (“I wish the days were longer,” he has said.) Since 2013, the fruits of his labor have been trickling out under the Steamroom imprint, the digital-only Bandcamp series named after his Tokyo studio. It’s an evocative name, and not so far off from the sounds he achieves. That there are currently 46 releases after just six years—some of them reissues, but most of it new and previously unreleased—says something about his dedication. To Magnetize Money and Catch a Roving Eye is a kindred spirit to that series. Even by O’Rourke’s standards, it is a mammoth undertaking. Steamroom releases typically consist of a single track that’s somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes in length, but the new album, a four-disc affair, totals nearly four and a quarter hours. The sounds within can be just as daunting. These are not the soft, consonant tones of Streamroom 40, a fan favorite; this music is woven together from ominous rustling noises, glowering low-end throb, and white-hot waves of piercing feedback. The dividing line between musical tone and pure atmosphere is porous: O’Rourke’s synthesizers are more gestural than melodic, and at their edges they dissolve into a vivid, four-dimensional soundscape. There is an unmistakably dreamlike quality to the music, with hints of birdsong and distant traffic, old trains creaking to life and spaceships powering up, boots in snow and high-voltage power lines overhead. It sounds not just haunting but haunted—not malevolent, necessarily, but terrifying nonetheless. In places, it sounds like O’Rourke came across Grouper’s Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill and decided to take the title literally, coaxing from his matrix of tapes and circuitry a sound equal to that of blood drying on matted pine needles. There are few repeated motifs, but  for the most part, elements rise into the mix, spread out like inkblots, and are subsumed back into the murk, never to appear again. Some nine minutes into “Part II,” there is an unexpected eruption of feedback, a sustained explosion of surprising force, as though O’Rourke had set fire to Sunn O)))’s backline, but otherwise, recognizable events are few and far between. Seismic rumble melts into glassy shimmer, and vice versa; the music is constantly shape-shifting, yet it all converges into a low, sustained hum. City-dwellers may recognize this as the standard frequency of the modern metropolis. It is as though O’Rourke had captured and amplified the sounds of everyday life, from the inaudible (magnetic fields, cell-phone signals) to the visceral (rainfall, rumbling subways), rendering them almost womblike. Despite the album’s intimidating scale, it is a strangely welcoming, even enveloping listen. “It’s not a question of patience,” O’Rourke has said, when asked why he likes longform composition so much. “It’s just my taste. I like longer music. It all really comes down to breathing.” In its controlled pacing and deep interiority, To Magnetize Money and Catch a Roving Eye also resembles a kind of breathwork. It is one of his most meditative pieces yet.","O’Rourke’s latest drone project, running to over four hours, is darker and more dreamlike than his Steamroom series, and one of his most meditative releases yet.

Jules,Julien Chang,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de948c49eef880008cd145d/1:1/w_160/jules.jpg,2019-12-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/julien-chang-jules/,Transgressive,"The streaming revolution has been very good to precocious teenagers tumbling headfirst into music obsession. Imagine being a teen today: You don’t need a well-stocked record clerk or in-the-know older sibling to place life-changing albums in your hands. You don’t even need spare cash for a Sam Goody run. Those barriers to entry have collapsed—and so have barriers of taste. Low culture is high culture, indie is pop, and for every celebrity teenager who does not know who Van Halen is, 20 more non-famous teens just devoured Van Halen, Van Halen II, and 1984 for the first time without leaving their bedrooms. Julien Chang is the sort of preternaturally talented pop wunderkind who benefits from this new world order: He has listened to a vast range of music, absorbed the most appealing ideas, and discarded the scraps. Chang recorded most of the songs on Jules, his first album, the summer before his senior year of high school. He was 17 and lapping up influences as varied as Gregorian chant, Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 2, and the Afro-funk compilation Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump. “I was really getting into a different kind of music each week, and I recorded a new song each week,” the songwriter, who is now 20, told Billboard recently. The resulting album—self-produced and recorded in a basement home studio—earned him a deal with the London label Transgressive. While nothing on Jules evokes Gregorian chant, the album’s breezy eclecticism floats between genres and influences with impressive fluidity. Opening track “Deep Green” travels from sci-fi mysticism to proggy grandeur before settling into a gentle psych-pop vocal melody. There is still room for a space-age guitar solo before the five-minute mark arrives. If Chang has a signature sound, it’s his knack for soft-focus psychedelic popcraft. This album suggests a lost link between the hazed-out aesthetic of early-2010s chillwave—Neon Indian, Washed Out, et al.—and the smooth precision of early-’80s sophisti-pop. The retro glow of “Two Voices” and “Moving Parts,” with their muffled vocals and generous helpings of reverb, tilt towards the former pole. But Chang’s best material highlights his obvious keyboard chops (he’s a classically trained musician) and penchant for soft groove. “Memory Loss,” with its staccato-funk groove and pleasantly stoned hook (“My memory is failing me/And I can’t remember why”), is an easy highlight. And the spry and funky “Dogolouge,” which appears to be sung from the perspective of a family dog (“Take me out/And I don’t know where”), boasts a surprise sax breakdown that could have been transplanted from an Avalon outtake. Much of the album has a transformational feel to it: Songs begin innocuously, then veer into unexpected territory, such as the key change in “Dogolouge.” The first single, “Of the Past,” seems content to coast on a supple funk groove buoyed by a vintage Microkorg from Chang’s father’s synth collection. But the song’s back half gives way to a startlingly proficient jazz piano solo that’s a kissing cousin to David Bowie’s “Aladdin Sane.” Played by Jeheiel Smith, a friend from school, it is one of just two guest performances throughout the album. Chang’s vocals are not quite as distinctive as his instrumental chops. Throughout Jules, he tends to layer his voice, or bury it under thick sweaters of reverb—a technique commonly favored by young musicians who aren’t quite accustomed to stepping up to the mic. And while his lush harmonies are occasionally quite striking (as on the slow-motion Fleet Foxes pastiche “Butterflies From Monaco”), this tendency leaves lethargic material like “Somerville Demo” feeling especially listless. On an album as rich with the spirit of teenage discovery as Jules, these are forgivable sins. Chang is 20, and his first album explores a wider stylistic terrain than plenty of bands manage in a full career.

Until the End of the World (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de81e634072b600087745f9/1:1/w_160/untiltheend.jpg,2019-12-09 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-until-the-end-of-the-world-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,Warner,"Write a song that sounds like the future. This was the challenge German filmmaker Wim Wenders posed to some of his favorite acts back in 1990, when he began compiling the soundtrack for his dystopian road movie Until the End of the World. What will you be writing about in ten years? How will your music sound? Set in 1999, the film follows its characters around the globe, across different continents and through different landscapes, chasing a machine that allows you to see your dreams. Music plays a crucial part, often mingling with these dreams until they become indistinguishable—fitting for a long-gestating project inspired by Aboriginal concepts of the subconscious. Of the 20 artists to whom Wenders posed that challenge, almost all of them complied (Ray Davies was allegedly a holdout). Each seemed to rise to the occasion in a different way. R.E.M. and U2 offered outtakes from their recent hit albums, while David Byrne reclaimed an old Naked outtake to create one of Talking Heads’ final songs. Can reunited for a single session, inviting original vocalist Malcolm Mooney to chant the percolating “Last Night’s Sleep.” Such was Wenders’ reputation after 1984’s Paris, Texas and 1987’s Wings of Desire that he could coax rarities out of the world’s biggest bands and persuade others to get back together. Despite a soundtrack with so many endorsements, the film was a flop, mainly because Wenders was forced to pare his five-hour opus down to a more marketable two-and-a-half hours. The theatrical cut was leaden and confusing. That makes Criterion’s new release of Wenders’ director’s cut a revelation, even more startling than Run-Out Groove’s new vinyl reissue of the soundtrack. The two have always existed slightly apart from each other; many more people heard the soundtrack than bothered to see the film. Still, they both start in the same place and trace similar journeys. With its woozy horns and debauched beats, Talking Heads’ “Sax & Violins” offers a jittery vision of the future, even if the track itself was a few years old by then. There are a few detours, most notably Julee Cruise’s otherworldly cover of Elvis Presley’s “Summer Kisses Winter Tears”; if it sounds like it’s from a very different kind of movie, that might be because it was produced by David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti. What’s most remarkable about the album, however, is its consistency despite the variety of artists and sounds. Its tone is forlorn, almost decadent in its melancholy, which manifests in a strange, uneasy shimmer that runs through so many of these songs. Lou Reed’s “What’s Good” ponders the everyday details that change when a close friend dies. On the spoken-word number “It Takes Time,” Patti Smith and husband Fred “Sonic” Smith sound like they’re circling the same dark memory, each afraid to approach it directly, as the music thrums and shivers around them. Depeche Mode trade their synths and guitars for what sounds like a Black Lodge jazz combo, and Martin Gore’s lyrics welcome death as a respite from an unruly world: “Mother, are you waiting? Father, are you pacing? I’m coming home.” It could be a cover of an Appalachian hymn from 1899. Fitting for a film by Wenders, these are songs full of vehicles and highways, evoking the odd isolation of hours spent hurtling alone down an empty road. “Whispering, as I was driving/Quietly the car rolling like a bullet,” Neneh Cherry chants on “Move With Me (Dub),” a sleek disassembling of a track from 1992’s Homebrew. Only Nick Cave, in one of his most actorly performances, offers much in the way of a story within his song, which involves a bomb in a bread basket, an exploding hotel, a blind pencil seller and his dead dog, set to a drinking-song chorus that’s one of the soundtrack’s purest highlights. There is a sense of finality, to these songs, as though the soundtrack is marking the end of… something. Maybe an era of alternative music. Until the End of the World includes three legendary bands that were defunct by the time it was released—Talking Heads and Can, but also Berlin-based goth-adjacent outfit Crime & the City Solution. There are several acts that were moving permanently out of the underground and into the mainstream—not just R.E.M. and Depeche Mode but k.d. lang (who duets with Jane Siberry on “Calling All Angels”). Until the End of the World was released just three months after Ten and two months after Nevermind, two albums that redefined rock music for the new decade. This soundtrack doesn’t live in that world. Like the movie, it remains unmoored from the past, gesturing towards a future that’s always enticingly out of reach.","A new reissue of the illusory soundtrack to Wim Wenders’ 1991 road film, which featured the final recordings of CAN and Talking Heads, highlights its forlorn and decadent melancholy.

Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge,My Chemical Romance,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e6aa9669180008bb6471/1:1/w_160/sweetrevenge.jpg,2019-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/my-chemical-romance-three-cheers-for-sweet-revenge/,Reprise,"Donna and Donald Way lived in a particularly bleak apartment in the gloomy little township of Belleville, a New Jersey suburb often mentioned in news stories about crime rings and mob trials. Donna, a hairdresser, had a penchant for horror films and eerie decor—at one point she filled an entire room with Victorian dolls. It was here, in a wood-paneled basement unit filled with gothic kitsch like petrified bats and lifelike human skulls, that their son Gerard spent most of his childhood. He posted up in a bedroom with only one window the size of a cinder block, fomenting the outcast mentality that would later manifest in My Chemical Romance. Northern New Jersey would soon become home to a thriving hardcore and emo scene in the early 2000s, one that would eventually propel Gerard’s band to global recognition. But as children, the suburbs could be restrictive: “Our parents were kind of scared to let us out of the house,” Gerard’s younger brother, Mikey, said later. “It was mostly me and Gerard.” The Way brothers chose to make the best of their cramped environs. They were into horror movies and comic books, and made up characters and stories together to compensate for the loneliness. For Gerard, comics became more than a hobby; after becoming an amateur artist in his own right, selling his first comic book at age 15, he enrolled in the School of Visual Arts in New York City. After graduating, Gerard nearly landed a TV pilot on Cartoon Network for a show about a Scandanavian monkey that could magically make breakfast out of thin air. But in 2001, when he saw the Twin Towers collapse during his morning commute, he found himself pulled away from his previous passion. Disillusioned and traumatized, he gave up his career, finding the world of TV executives insufficiently radical, too profit-driven and slow for the intensity of the post-9/11 era. Seeing local hardcore heroes Thursday perform at a small club flipped a switch: “I wanted to make a bigger impact,” he said later. After roping in his brother and local music nerd Ray Toro, who had the frazzled look and finger-picking acumen of a snobbish Guitar Center tech, My Chemical Romance was born a week later. Today, My Chemical Romance are ubiquitous—a meme, a cult, an aesthetic. Though the term “emo” has long stuck to the band, their mix of vaudevillian pomp and four-on-the-floor punk progressions was more indicative of a new direction for the sub-genre. But they remained relevant long after the sound they championed died out commercially in the late 2000s. Rather than the pinch of nostalgia or embarrassment that often accompanies revisiting the histrionic lyrics of that era, My Chemical Romance subverted shame by embracing their gothic attire, wearing it like a base layer from which they could build unexpectedly melodic pop. When they announced their reunion earlier this year, fans embraced them not like a ratty relic of childhood, but like a long-lost heirloom that had finally been returned. Perhaps their lasting appeal is because the band never wanted to strictly write about passing teenage anxieties. Their early songs were a direct response to the attacks of September 11. “Skylines and Turnstiles,” the first song Gerard wrote, teemed with heightened existential dread: “After seeing what we saw/Can we still reclaim our innocence?” The “Attic Demos,” recorded in 2001 in the attic of their then-drummer, barely made it past the North New Jersey punk scene—the production was tinny and compressed, Gerard’s voice was strained and out of tune. But the demo conveyed an earnest commitment to storytelling and a glimmer of ambition, enough to convince local punk stalwart Frank Iero to join as a rhythm guitarist: “There was just something about it where you could already imagine what it would sound like,” he said. My Chemical Romance released their official debut, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in July 2002. The record, produced by Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly and released on local punk mainstay Eyeball Records, had the hallmarks of the hardcore scene that surrounded them: guitars ripped through verses; clean vocals slipped into shredded screams. But My Chemical Romance stood out for its dedication to fantasy, writing the album loosely told from the perspective of a vampiric protagonist who must avenge his lover’s death. Their bombastic live shows, so violent and destructive they often led to broken glass, landed them a manager and, before long, a record deal with the Warner Bros. offshoot Reprise. Before the end of 2003, they’d outgrow the small Passaic clubs they used to frequent. By 2004, thanks to an optimistic album review in The Guardian, they’d be playing headlining shows across the UK, scoring a series of glowing write-ups in Kerrang! and NME before they even began recording their major-label debut. The deal with Reprise gave the band access to their pick of producers. Their first choice, rock oracle Butch Vig, was busy, so they landed on Howard Benson, who had once worked with Motörhead but, more recently, had taken on the dregs of nu-metal with groups like Crazy Town and Hoobastank. Benson and My Chemical Romance were a strange pair. When he first arrived at the studio, wearing his usual uniform of sweatpants and a hockey jersey, the band allegedly mistook him for a pizza delivery guy. Everyone referred to him as “a sports coach” who would largely communicate in basketball metaphors. But Benson challenged the band to work on song structure and melody, pushing back against extra guitar solos and abrupt endings—saying things like, “‘What does this have to do with the rest of the song? You’re confusing the shit out of me,’” as Gerard later recalled. “That’s the point,” the band would yell in return. But Benson’s coaching pushed the album, what we now know as Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, to its emotive peaks. While recording “The Ghost of You,” a seething song about loss, Benson convinced the band to include a final chorus to end the song. (“We all hated having that chorus in that song,” Toro later said.) My Chemical Romance came from a world in which nothing trumped the brute force of a scream like Rickly’s or an overdriven guitar-heavy outro; the original ending had both. But Benson’s formulaic approach helped anchor the pensive ballad: With that final chorus—a defiant, unabashedly self-serious crescendo— the band displayed a glimmer of the massive arena rock they’d go on to write for 2006’s The Black Parade. “The Ghost of You” shot to top the UK Rock and Metal Singles chart. On its face, Three Cheers was a lofty concept record about star-crossed lovers who die in a gunfight, who must then “bring the devil the souls of 1,000 evil men” in order to be reunited in the afterlife. But it’s a conceit loosely held. Instead of a vigilante shootout, Three Cheers ripples to life with “Helena,” a guilt-laden tribute to the Ways’ grandmother, Elena, who died while the band was away on tour. The track begins with a restrained, reverberating guitar and Gerard’s voice at nearly a whisper. Then, almost like a jump scare at a haunted house, the band comes in at full volume: a legion of distortion, led by a full-throated yelp from Gerard. While the songs on Three Cheers are certainly allegories for ennui and narcissism, they are often equally escapist explorations into storytelling and world-building. We meet our protagonist outright in “Give ’Em Hell, Kid,” as he journeys up from New Orleans pumped full of stimulants and ready to exact his revenge. By the third track, “To The End,” he’s inside a mansion to murder a wedding party, dropping small details—homosexual undertones, allusions to William Faulkner—like little breadcrumbs. The narrative also helps to unite an otherwise disparate record; by the time the Morricone whistles kick in on “Hang ’Em High,” they seem fitting in service of the story. The band, and Benson, carefully balanced these large gestures to literary tropes with hooks and choruses that are more in line with a typical rock song. Still, like the band members cooped up in Jersey basements a decade prior, the fans who needed it found an escape, a record that didn’t just lament a sleepy one-horse town, but transported them out of it entirely. On the most successful manifestation of the album’s concept, the jaunty “You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison,” the band strikes a memorable balance between drama and black humor, dropping the listener in on the arrest of the protagonist and then documenting his ensuing panic attacks behind bars. His concerns vacillate between the laughably mundane (“They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost”) and the deadly (“My cellmate’s​ a killer”). But it’s the delivery of the penultimate line of the verse—“They make me do push-ups in drag”—that reverberates after the song ends. It’s a half-laugh, half-sob delivered with flair and a wink. The scattered references to queerness and gender-play—Gerard might sing a verse from the perspective of a girlish ex-lover—add a counterweight to the record’s overarching violence and masculinity, a self-referential nod to a frontman who would later publicly admit to struggles with gender identity. In a scene that was quickly turning to gendered hatred and dreams of femicide, these small rebellions against the rigidity of masculinity felt like the loosening of a pressure valve. But the song that would become an anthem for fans and the hoards of copycat bands that grew in the album’s wake was lead single, “I’m Not Okay (I Promise).”  The song is a comparatively straightforward outsider anthem, with choppy chords, gnarled vocals, and lyrics that state pent-up, vindictive frustration outright. As far as narcissistic depression goes, the chorus is admittedly on-the-nose: “I’m not OK/You wear me out.” With its sensitive, almost sophomoric outlook (“Forget about the dirty looks/The photographs your boyfriend took”), the song could have been self-parody, an encapsulation of emo’s self-pitying melodramatics. Yet, perhaps because the band took themselves and their message as deadly serious, “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” remains a classic—an unfiltered stream of pure catharsis, destined to be screamed at karaoke bars for the foreseeable future. From the gasping desperation of Gerard’s vocal performance, recorded alone in a dark attic, to the song’s pop structure, it approached the desolation in its lyrics with almost triumphant glee. Unabashedly melodic and unafraid to whimper and shout in the same verse, “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” captures the most exciting way to be at the end of your rope. In the end, sentiment won out over concept. A year into the tour for the Three Cheers, Gerard began to sing a different tune about the meaning of the record: “Really, it's about two boys living in New Jersey who lost their grandma, and how their brothers in the band helped them get through it."" And the beauty in Three Cheers lies in that mutability: It took the quotidian drama of suburban kids and blew it up into a life-or-death soap opera. Instead of digging its heels further into the pressures of adolescence, the album attempted to transcend them; in a world of Judy Blumes, it read like Stephen King. My Chemical Romance thrived because they came to the realization that emotional outcasts deserved something to cheer for, even if their victories were imaginary. Teenage emotions aren’t cut and dried and high school has no set heroes and villains. In building a world that reflected imperfections and guilt, exhilaration and depression, My Chemical Romance never patronized their audience; their characters, like the band members themselves, embraced the in-between. Perhaps that is why, when The Daily Mail accused My Chemical Romance of creating a suicidal cult, teens cloaked in the colors of a funeral procession shot back with a surprisingly affirmative response: “MCR SAVED OUR LIVES.”","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Marcielago,Roc Marciano,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5deaa663795ff5000938f76f/1:1/w_160/marcielago.jpg,2019-12-07 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roc-marciano-marcielago/,self-released,"After stalled apprenticeships with Pete Rock and Busta Rhymes, Roc Marciano arrived with 2010’s self-produced Marcberg, a grayscale triumph which blended elements of Only Built 4 Cuban Linx and Dah Shinin’ into an intricate and nearly impenetrable statement of purpose. Landing just before iTunes began ceding ground to Spotify, Marcberg showcased an auteur who never broke character, an unsentimental diarist nevertheless obsessed with thread counts and lacquer finishes. The drums snapped and the samples felt three-dimensional; when Marci described the temperature, you felt it in your knuckles. Hazily rooted in blaxploitation slang, cocaine-’80s touchstones, and outer-borough ’90s grit, the Hempstead provenance of Marciano’s bygone New York makes sense once you consider that the Notorious B.I.G.’s childhood home currently rents for $4,000 a month. For a few years, it seemed that Marcberg and its follow-ups would endure as brilliant aberrations, suggestive of an alternate timeline in which Mr. Smith and Life After Death were never released, and gloss never visited hip-hop’s birth city. But as rap labels cratered and New York City’s primacy waned, his records became foundational texts for a wave of neo-classicists from declining industrial burgs. Among the immediate disciples of Marci—marketed less like rap stars than outsider artists—are Buffalo’s flamboyant Griselda collective; Newark’s Mach-Hommy; Crimeapple, a Colombian-American oddball from Hackensack whose flow lands a good half-beat behind the snare; and Marci’s Hempstead neighbors SmooVth and Hus KingPin, whose drawling rasps are more Corleone than Wu-Tang. Even more than their mechanics and taste in samples, these rappers owe Marciano their narrative scopes. The scenes rarely develop into full sagas, but they’re photographic in their detail. Marcielago serves as a capstone for Marci’s decade, a mix of evocative soul samples and stripped-down loops paired with his trademark gnomic flow. There are few hooks or melodies in any traditional sense, and he prefers soft percussion when he doesn’t forgo it entirely. He remains an artist for whom scene-setting remains the platonic ideal: You’re never left wondering what kind of sauce bathes the filet, or what show’s playing on the fuzzy TV in the corner. Sometimes, his narratives seem shaped by the dictates of the rhymes themselves.  On “Richard Gear,” the arrival of a borrowed Sentra renders a victim’s t-shirt magenta; on “Choosin Fees,” a “lady of the evenin’” elicits the theory that “if we had babies they’d be heathens.” The opening verse of “Puff Daddy” is an exemplary study in narrative economy. It’s also the one track on Marcielago that might sound at home on another artist’s record: The distorted piano chords and Bad Boy-referencing title feel nicked from the Griselda playbook, itself so heavily predicated on Marciano’s work. But when Griselda frontman Westside Gunn appears on “Boosie Fade,” the contrast between the two vocalists is electric—no torch-passing moments here. Marciano’s ground-level camera homes in on the subtle details that tend to elude his contemporaries, and he remains the most colorful character to appear in front of his own lens.","The gritty and elusive Hempstead MC caps off a decade of profound influence with more photographic narratives, gnarled slang, and evocative soul samples.

Catastrophic Deliquescence (Music From Fortitude 2015-2018),Ben Frost,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6def59eef880008cd11d2/1:1/w_160/frost.jpg,2019-12-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ben-frost-catastrophic-deliquescence-music-from-fortitude-2015-2018/,Mute,"A choir can produce a heavenly aura as easily as it can evoke the jaws of hell clamping down on sinners. On “Mammoth Suite,” Australian composer and experimentalist Ben Frost demonstrates such a shift in the space of 15 seconds: A hair-raising commotion subsides into whispers and groans, which bleed into the strings presumably sent to serenade the forsaken. It’s a tense moment in what transpires to be almost an hour and a half of tense moments on Catastrophic Deliquescence (Music From Fortitude 2015-2018). The album collects 31 compositions Frost wrote for the British television series Fortitude, a psychological thriller shaped by the forces of climate change and capitalism. Fortitude is a fictional town in the Norwegian Arctic, but for those who favor the strain of crime drama sometimes called Nordic noir, it will feel highly familiar. Though it’s a UK production, Fortitude shares Nordic noir’s population of families torn apart by secrets, pervasive sense of isolation, and looming existential threat. Partially filmed in Iceland, the series does an impressive job of making a character of the landscape, and this is where Frost, who lives in Iceland, sensibly grounds his score. There’s howling wind, effects that mimic the way snow muffles sound, the squawk of a gull. Whether leaning into classical motifs or pushing electronics to the point of distortion, the music shivers with ominous uncertainty: In this realm, it always feels like something bad is about to happen, even when it already has. On “Permafrost,” the foreboding is briefly tempered by curiosity. Beneath layers of static and bass, the central melody has the pattern of a bird call, perky and persuasive. For every playful interlude like this on the compilation, however, there are a handful of tracks intent on coming off as more mysterious than the last. The plainly named “Dan” and “Elena” use swathes of synth reverb and choral offcuts to very standard effect. Like anything, mysterious tropes lose their impact with overuse. The real drama on Catastrophic Deliquescence lies in the moments when Frost breaks with genre conformity. The fractal drums and negative space on “Tupilaq (A Shower Scene)” provide a much-needed shot of energy. In the second half of the record, some truly beautiful brass feels warm enough to scoop you up and carry you through the storm. “Snow Like Smoke,” in particular, recalls the heavy heart of Alan Silvestri’s “Theme From The Bodyguard,” from Whitney Houston’s peerless 1992 blockbuster. But do TV soundtracks need to exist separate from their shows? There is a world of difference between the kind of score required for a film, which has a fixed runtime and a distinct narrative arc, and a TV series, which is deemed successful only if its story is strung out over several seasons. The psychological thriller, in particular, is the perfect template for the streaming age: Just as page-turners worship at the altar of the cliffhanger, binge-watch TV lives or dies by its ability to march you into the next episode. But when taken in aggregate, 31 tracks designed to keep you at the edge of your seat can be exhausting—and 23 of them are under the three-minute mark. It’s not that short scene-length tracks are bad; it’s that the overall emotional tone winds up feeling repetitive. I’m not convinced that Catastrophic Deliquescence works as a standalone release. That’s a shame, because it’s an accomplished score when experienced as originally intended—within a TV show. Fortitude’s elongated tensions and creeping dread wouldn’t land the way they do without Frost’s musical guidance. Perhaps that’s what he’s hinting at with the title. Deliquescence is a chemical process by which a substance absorbs so much moisture from the atmosphere that it dissolves in the accumulated water. TV shows absorb so much emotional weight from their soundtracks that they cannot properly exist without them. But just because the music can be extracted doesn’t mean something isn’t lost along the way.

Grapefruit Regret,Karenn,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de55392c43b7100080dda00/1:1/w_160/grapefruitregret.jpg,2019-12-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/karenn-grapefruit-regret/,Voam,"Karenn’s Grapefruit Regret is not designed for home listening. There’s no grand concept at work; the LP’s title literally stems from an unfortunate breakfast order. There are no ambient sketches, no cross-genre experiments, no high-profile guest appearances. This is a confident, no-nonsense affair: eight tracks of machine techno squarely focused on the dancefloor. Although this is their debut album as a duo, Karenn’s Jamie Roberts (aka Blawan) and Arthur Cayzer (aka Pariah) have been playing together for nearly a decade. Both are products of the fertile post-dubstep scene of the late 2000s and early 2010s, in which the sounds of the UK’s hardcore continuum intermingled with house, techno, and R&B, giving rise to artists like James Blake, Floating Points, and Joy Orbison. But Roberts quickly diverted from his peers. In both his solo work and with Karenn, he embraced a particularly British strain of dark, industrial-leaning techno championed by acts like Surgeon and Sandwell District. From the beginning, Karenn have been rooted in live performance, gradually sharpening their sound and taming their small fleet of gear. Early Karenn efforts, while banging, were also endearingly crude: Grotty creations like “Auflen Whip” sounded like they’d been forged by a blacksmith. Stark, raw, and largely devoid of funk, the music was full of static, hiss, rattling drums, and distorted synths; the duo’s lack of polish was part of its charm, and Karenn’s music tickled both machine fetishists and techno fans with an itch to get rowdy on the dancefloor. In recent years, however, Karenn has turned down the volume. Following a single 2014 EP on their She Works the Long Nights label, they stopped releasing records. The studio break seems particularly prescient in retrospect; they pressed pause just as electronic music was becoming overrun with dark, industrial-flavored techno soundalikes. Even Karenn, who continued to perform live, noticed the shift; speaking recently to The Quietus, Roberts observed, “Things got quite aggressive over the last couple of years, so bro-y."" Karenn’s return in 2019 has been comparatively lighthearted. They’re still making serious techno, but some of the darkness has been stripped out, and the music’s presentation has been downright silly at times. Kind of Green, the duo’s first release in five years, was announced as “five slices of pudding for your pet fowl.” Since then, Karenn have released Voam Club Archive Volume 1, a collection of tunes extracted from live recordings, and now Grapefruit Regret, recorded this summer in Berlin. In the span of less than a year, Karenn—a project that some assumed might never produce another record—have become downright prolific. Grapefruit Regret might be the cleanest thing they’ve ever done. While analog crunch is still a part of their palette, it’s no longer one of the music’s defining features. “Lemon Dribble” opens the album with little more than bristling static and a moodily winding bassline; the kick drum is distorted, but once it drops, the track becomes a focused—and surprisingly groovy—techno exercise. No one is going to confuse them with Derrick May or Underground Resistance, but Karenn’s sound has gotten funkier, and a lot less harrowing than it used to be. The change suits the duo, and explains how a track like “Strawbs”—which ups the tempo to a galloping 150 BPM—can feel so lithe. At that speed, a lot of techno begins to either sound cartoonish or feel like an unrelenting juggernaut, but “Strawbs” is positively bouncy, its wriggly rhythms offset by airy, meditative pads. “Peel Me Easy” takes a similar tack, reflecting Karenn’s newfound willingness to add a bit of color. Karenn fans looking for techno screamers won’t come away disappointed. “Kumquat” is an unrelenting face melter, its bleeping synths almost joyously insistent. “Crush the Mushrooms” is similarly manic, but it’s also one of the more irreverent tracks on the LP, employing crunchy, almost robotic synths that sound like a warped take on Daft Punk. Even the gloomy closer “Taste Yourself,” easily the LP’s most contemplative track, is optimized for the dancefloor. It’s unlikely that anyone, Karenn fans included, will repeatedly consume the album from start to finish; it’s just not that kind of record. But the two producers are doing something special together, and Grapefruit Regret reflects their confidence after nearly a decade in action. They may have taken their time to get here, but it’s clear from the way they’ve loosened up that Roberts and Cayzer are moving forward in exactly the manner that they see fit.

Tunes 2011 to 2019,Burial,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de5963e238c6f0008bc0c6b/1:1/w_160/burial.jpg,2019-12-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burial-tunes-2011-to-2019/,Hyperdub,"Over a decade ago, Burial came down to us, mapped a blueprint for a sound, and perfected it. But what followed his remarkable 2006 self-titled debut and the glorious 2007 follow-up Untrue was mostly silence—or, if we were fortunate, the odd collaboration. It looked as if Burial might have said all he intended to. With tabloid newspapers launching campaigns to unmask the then-faceless producer, online communities scrutinizing any breadcrumbs in the trail, and a transfixed music world gazing at him like an oracle, Burial was probably left asking himself whether this was the life he wanted after all. It transpired that he did. The floodgates opened. While the pined-for third album has yet to emerge, 15 standalone EPs and 12""s did, and you wouldn’t put it past him to drop another while this compilation cools on the windowsill. Much has changed, but Burial’s wily nature remains undiminished. Tunes 2011 to 2019 features every solo Hyperdub cut from that eight-year-span (barring “Rodent,” for reasons unknown). The two-and-a-half-hour comp proves that, for the most part, Burial was successful at outrunning the long shadow that iconic wall cast. Bucking all prevailing logic, the rush actually was better the second time around. Burial is one of the few active electronic musicians who simultaneously commands the intrigue of professorial types and cultivates a fanbase dedicated enough that, on Christmas Day 2012 in the UK, he was physically outselling Adele, One Direction, and Bon Iver. But idolatry doesn’t last long in electronic circles. The whimsical appeal of an anonymous dubstep superhero rapidly decayed as we turned a corner into the 2010s (on that note, the 2016 Zomby collaboration “Sweetz” is nowhere to be seen). An unusual relationship developed between the audience and Burial—too rare a talent to jettison but too weird an entity to treat sincerely—leading to an obsession that grew both stronger and sillier. It leaves Burial walking an unenviable tightrope. He must live up to his own supersized reputation, while progressing a popular formula—rumpled kicks and bass, maudlin atmospherics, and the dual crackle of vinyl static and rainstorms—familiar enough to be a punchline. The most inspired stretch of Burial’s second decade came with 2012’s Kindred and 2013’s Rival Dealer, two of the most magisterial EPs in the history of electronic music. The choice of format made for an intriguing gamble. Wishful thinking suggests that they should have been a complete album rather than separate vote-splitters. But it never could have worked that way. Kindred was a line in the sand, brilliantly welding Burial’s signature to the pulse, structure and dynamics of house and techno. With Rival Dealer Burial crossed that line and picked up a personality that went beyond representing an avatar for our moods. Where once there was mostly Pensive Burial, now there is Poppy Burial, Lovesick Burial, Euphoric Burial, Queer Burial, Consolatory Burial, Ambient Burial and even—if you cock your head at a certain angle to “Subtemple”—Burial Gone Fishing. Tunes 2011 to 2019 lays out this Burial multiverse, telling conflicting stories of a sound that has increasingly functioned as a Rorschach test for listeners. Some saw the turn on Rival Dealer toward big drums, unadulterated human voices, and major-key chord progressions as a sign that he was going soft. Others point to pupil-dilating warpers like “Claustro” and “Rough Sleeper” as a sign that Burial, who professed in early interviews to be a non-raver in spite of how well he captured rave culture’s integral spirit, had since donned Balenciaga, hit an off-location party, and hammered it until daybreak. As Burial’s output expanded, there have been fewer attempts at alchemy. He used to be deft at gelling numerous styles while leaving the end product sounding unmistakably Burial-esque. Now it’s obvious when he is trying his hand at dronescapes or pinging arpeggiated trance. These experiments might suggest that he was becoming more one-track-minded, but another recurring theme suggests he is an incorrigible commitment-phobe: his tapestries of ideas that never quite came to fruition. The sound of a tape flipping; a cloak of fuzz that swallows one track and coughs out another form; a quick, stapled-on coda—all are now as common in his songs as the skip-and-clank rhythms and pitch-shifted R&B vocals that became synonymous with his name. While listening to Tunes 2011 to 2019, it’s not hard to find yourself wishing Burial would do himself a favor and expand certain snippets, such as the stunning piano trills on “Ashtray Wasp,” that are more powerful than most producers’ entire catalogs. Yet this tendency toward symphonic mini-suites (or, less charitably, a mental block in getting stuff over the line) is one of the quirks that keeps Burial as compelling as ever. Tunes 2011 to 2019 is as much of an undertaking as you might expect a 149-minute compilation to be. The chronology is a little scrambled, but it is effectively a backward walk from the present day, which means beginning with recent 12""s that few, if any, treat as Burial’s golden age. Sequencing helps illuminate the strengths of ponderous, heavily textured, largely beatless songs—“State Forest,” “Beachfires,” “Subtemple,” and “Young Death”—that felt unremarkable as standalones. The effect is akin to taking a muscle relaxant and watching black waves crashing against a beach in slow motion, a dark night of the sandy soul. Filtered synths on “Nightmarket” arrive like a flare exploding across the milky sky, and “Hiders,” which was Christmassy enough to begin with, is now stirring to the point of hilarity. The first bells are so loud in the mix they resemble the crash of a gong at the end of 40 minutes of tantric deep breathing. Placing 2019’s speed-garage romp “Claustro” after “Come Down to Us” signals a tonal shift from winter wonderland to a basement club at peak time, walls clammy and bodies writhing. After a long and winding road we have reached Bangerville, and the compilation barely lets up from here. The first half of CD2 is the apex of Burial’s dancefloor material, truly as good as it gets. Angry static buzzes around the margins while basslines churn fitfully. Fractional details—the desperation of cloaked cries on “Kindred,” “Rough Sleeper”’s spurts of stop-and-go motion, tinny drums ticking down to something untoward on “Truant”—now loom massive, accruing intensity as they go. The strobing synths on “Loner” are revelatory all over again: It is one of the best rave anthems of the 21st century, and should be celebrated as such. The three songs from the Street Halo EP, which sounded dolorous upon initial release in March 2011, are positively a relief here. “Stolen Dog,” with a backbeat pliable enough that it found itself wound around Sisqo’s “Thong Song” in the mash-up of the decade, has the becalming effect of a cup of tea after a heavy night out. The wispy “NYC” rounds things off with a whisper, a soft landing to close out a feral run. In spite of the alien qualities of his productions, Burial has been so widely successful because of how much he gets it. He trained on great intangibles with a marksman’s precision, articulating the smudged highs and lows of nocturnal inner-city life, evoking the feeling of being utterly alone while placated by a strange sense of belonging. Songs like “U Hurt Me” and “Near Dark” were the saddest shit imaginable, yet somehow glinting with hope. Tunes 2011 to 2019 is a far cry from the Burial of 2005 to 2007, but he’s as capable as ever of unlocking those same feelings—just now with a different set of tools. The last voice we hear on Tunes 2011 to 2019 is that of The Wire’s inscrutable villain Marlo Stanfield: “Don’t rush me on shit. I’ll get at you when I’m at you.” Stanfield goes from being untouchable to considered a diminished force, but fundamentally stays undefeated. Given that all his moves seem loaded in one way or another, it’s easy to imagine Burial wielding this sample with deliberately renewed purpose. He’s there when he wants to be, out of the shadows, often at a moment and in a form you don’t expect. He was the beneficiary of an unrepeatable set of cultural and technological circumstances, but he’s massaged the myth adroitly. It makes following him as fun as any other musician working today—so we remain hooked, even if we kid ourselves that we’re over it.

Labyrinth,Doon Kanda,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddd8ef3238c6f0008bc0997/1:1/w_160/labyrinth.jpg,2019-12-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/doon-kanda-labyrinth/,Hyperdub,"Skin is a boundary that Jesse Kanda trespasses in his visual works. A frequent collaborator of Björk, Arca, and FKA twigs, Kanda creates worlds of opalescent membranes and semi-human figures that match those artists’ ideas about the physical body. In the video he directed for twigs’ early track “How’s That,” a glistening human form deflates and then billows like a scrap of silk. His debut LP as Doon Kanda, Labyrinth, is the aural equivalent. While his first two minimalist EPs, 2017’s Heart and last year’s Luna, were fluid and open-ended, the full-length is engraved with baroque detail. Kanda wrote the majority of Labyrinth in triple meter, a time signature common to formal dance styles like the waltz. He envisions “venues transformed into an alien world” through the dissonant force of his music, but the result is more camp than alien. Opener “Polycephaly,” with its lush synthetic piano, sounds like it could back a nightmare sequence in a gothic horror movie. “Dio” begins with a throbbing beat and machine-like whir before synthetic strings rise up and distort, melting like the twisted bodies that populate Kanda’s visual works. It’s the sound of glamorous decay, and by oozing over the beat, the strings rebel against the rigid formality of the meter, almost throwing it off. The force of the waltz is unbreakable, though, and continues on nearly uninterrupted to closer “Entrance.” Over the course of its thirteen tracks, Labyrinth loosely chronicles growing anxiety and its dissolution, peaking at “Mino” before settling into a level of serenity at “Bunny.” Kanda is most successful when he interrupts the album’s emotional arc; “Wing” is the first track that departs from triple meter, and consists only of humming synths and the sound of fluttering insect wings. It introduces a more quiet chaos than that of the highly ornamented tracks that surround it. On “Pieridae,” the album’s omnipresent synthetic strings slide around skittering percussion without overwhelming the piece. “Search,” the comedown after “Mino,” features eerie synths and a metallic ring, like something gone awry in the engine of an ancient car. The album’s slower moments allow the music to catch up to its own strangeness. Labyrinth is not just a musical project; it comes complete with ten visual works, showing Kanda’s emphasis on world-building. The characters rendered in those works are smooth and slick, made of something like flesh or polished stone. The winged figure on the cover of the album is bone-white and pocked with cavernous holes, windows into an inside that’s largely empty. There’s a softness in its pose that counteracts the uncanny form; though it stands erect, its head is slightly bowed, hands gesturing toward prayer. That softness manifests in the music, present in the sweeping, darkly sweet melodies of “Nastasya” and “Bunny.” In these moments of pleasure with discomfort hovering beneath, Kanda reaches synthesis between his visual and musical universes.","The producer and visual artist builds an uncanny, disturbing world on his debut LP that recalls his collaborations with Björk, Arca, and FKA twigs.

Body of Carbon,Croatian AmorVarg2TM,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de94432b517ce000899f0f2/1:1/w_160/bodyofcarbon.jpg,2019-12-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/croatian-amor-varg2tm-body-of-carbon/,Posh Isolation,"Loke Rahbek has always thought a lot about vulnerability. In 2014, the Copenhagen-based musician released an album under his Croatian Amor moniker that could only be purchased by sending him a nude self-portrait. A year earlier, his band Vår—a collaboration with Iceage’s Elias Bender Rønnenfelt—released a record with a mirror for a cover; picking it up off the shelf meant implicating yourself in the music, the listener implicitly becoming part of the product. These sorts of gestures can seem like marketing gimmicks, but there’s a sincerity in the message behind them. He’s willing to bare his soul to you if you’ll do the same. With the exception of some noisier releases early in the project’s lifespan, Croatian Amor’s music has largely mirrored that warmth. Consider his 2016 album Love Means Taking Action, which he’s said was about “a quest to love strangers so that they stop being strangers,” and consisted mostly of glittering ambient instrumentals and heavenly vocal samples. It glowed with surprising humanity, and it has been a tone-setter for much of his work since. Body of Water, his 2018 collaboration with the Swedish producer Varg2TM, was the furthest he’d pursued his more tranquil interests. Its four tracks were misty and abstract, not unlike the cosmic excursions of Steve Roach or the synth-led naivete of ’80s new age labels like Valley of the Sun. The sequel, Body of Carbon, appears quite dissimilar on the surface. Like its predecessor, it’s driven by abstract synth work, but the mood is different—more inky and earthy. The title track opens with squealing synth work, which on its own is enough to separate it from the wispy pieces on Body of Water, but the track quickly tacks on gnarled layers until it reaches a freakish approximation of a grime beat—replete with a barking kick drum that might otherwise echo through Thunderdome. Heavier music isn’t unfamiliar territory for the duo, though. Rahbek’s other projects often include tortured industrial excursions, and Varg2TM’s catalog is frequently dancefloor-adjacent—even if he holds some reservations about that whole scene. So when their wheezing ambiance is accompanied by kick drum punishment, like on “Tell Your Tale to the River,” it’s not necessarily so unexpected. They know how to rage when the occasion calls for it. But the stylistic left turn is ultimately an act of deception. Despite its sharper edges, Body of Carbon finds a way to further explore the gentle, humanistic approach demonstrated on Body of Water. You can hear this guiding principle in even its most twisted tracks. Outside of the hopscotching bass drum, the gasping synths and soaring trance leads of “Tell Your Tale to the River” feel full of air and light. In approach, if not in sound, it recalls some of Coil’s best records, in which tenderness and torment lock in embrace. The record’s most striking moments come in the delirious haze of the second track, “God’s Face in the Water.” The foggy instrumental echoes all kinds of emotional electronic music—from Slowdive’s windswept ambient work on Pygmalion to the devotional miniatures on PAN’s Mono No Aware compilation—as a digital voice murmurs mantra-esque phrases about finding miracles in the mundane. “I see God in the water in my water bottle,” the voice says. “God in the strobe lights.” It underscores the same point Rahbek was making with those idiosyncratic releases earlier this decade. Even in a harsh, cold world, there’s beauty if you’re open to finding it.","Beneath its sharp edges and heavy drums, the producers’ second collaboration takes a gentle, humanistic approach.

20 Years of Fabric,Various Artists,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de803e99669180008bb6521/1:1/w_160/fabric.jpg,2019-12-06 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-20-years-of-fabric/,Fabric,"When London club Fabric opened in October 1999, dubstep was barely a twinkle in 2-step’s eye, Daft Punk were just a promising French house duo, and nu-skool breaks was all the rage. 20 Years of Fabric, released to celebrate two decades of the club, isn’t a comprehensive guide to Fabric’s adventures since then. There’s no grime, little dubstep, and no Ricardo Villalobos, who seemed to be permanently stuck into an eight-hour set whenever I visited in the 2000s. Then again, there’s simply no way of jamming two decades of London clubbing into 20 tracks, however well curated, and those oversights shouldn’t detract from what is a worthy—if occasionally dull—attempt to make sense of the decades of sleepless nights and millions of electronic beats that have gone into making Fabric such an enduring institution. 20 Years of Fabric (the album) says a great deal about the past 20 years of Fabric (the club); it also offers insight into a British club culture that balances reverence for the past with an eye for the future, and where commercialism and experimentalism go hand in hand. The club has invited 20 artists who helped shape its sound to contribute new tracks to this compilation. Uncharitably, you might group them into those representing Fabric’s past (Sasha, UNKLE and Groove Armada), present (Anastasia Kristensen, Nina Kraviz, Daniel Avery, et al), and future (new residents IMOGEN and Mantra). The imperial march of house and techno dominates, as it does Saturday nights all over Britain; the genres’ reliability is a vaguely comforting disappointment. Tracks from Call Super, Margaret Dygas, and Kraviz suggest an alternative avenue for the 4/4 sound that is giddy, hypnotic, and laced with psychedelia, but they risk getting bogged down in the methodical efficiency of contributions from Marcel Dettmann, Sasha, and IMOGEN. Drum’n’bass, which has played a crucial role in the history of both Fabric and British nightlife, fares better. The three artists here—Special Request, Source Direct, and J. Majik—may sail closer to the ’90s tradition of chopped “Amen” breaks and rave-induced paranoia than to the precision-engineered sonics of modern drum’n’bass. But there is a serotonin-loosening rush of nostalgic futurism to their cold-blooded atmospherics (Source Direct’s “Vigilante”), melodic sub bass (J. Majik’s “The Lost Tribe”) and borderline ridiculous rave cosplay (Special Request’s “Codename Turbo Nutter”) that reminds you how vibrant the genre was in its heyday. From here on in, things get murkier. Shackleton’s “Drawn and Quartered” has the rambling mysticism, polyrhythmic ceremony, and live feel of his Tunes of Negation project, while Pinch & Trim’s “That Wasn’t It” rides a screwball rhythm and melancholic piano chords; the two songs’ utter indifference to the drop is a reminder of how far most dubstep pioneers have moved from the genre’s gothic bass pressure. Mantra’s “Embers” is equally uncanny, if slightly more danceable. The song’s stuttering breaks and rumbling bass suggest an experimental drum’n’bass track pitched down to -8, where it connects with the bubbling synth rush and euphoric vocal loop of an ’80s rave anthem. It is a shame that the album then descends into the moribund closing duo of Groove Armada’s “Wesley Nightshade” and UNKLE’s painfully earnest “Catch Me When I Fall (Fabric Club Mix)”: Their dual blandness splashes ketchup all over 20 Years’ increasingly spicy second half. The club has been many things over the years, not all of them successful, but rarely is it as boring as these songs suggest. Ultimately, if you want to experience the thrills of Fabric at 20, go to the club; if you want to explore Fabric’s historical significance, your first port of call should be the Fabric and Fabriclive mix CDs, whose monthly installments were essential in mapping out the electronic music landscape of the 2000s. But if you want a warts-and-all snapshot of modern British clubbing, jammed somewhere tedium and brilliance, 20 Years of Fabric will do you right.","The iconic London nightclub celebrates two decades with 20 tracks that survey the house, techno, and bass-music styles synonymous with the venue, with mixed results.

The Hood Dictionary,NoCap,by: Ben Dandridge-Lemco,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddeda9f238c6f0008bc0a4c/1:1/w_160/hooddictionary.jpg,2019-12-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nocap-the-hood-dictionary/,self-released,"The Hood Dictionary arrived on streaming services less than 24 hours before NoCap’s release from Mobile County Metro Jail. In September, the Alabama rapper turned himself in to police on charges of allegedly shooting into an occupied residence. He marked his surrender in much the same way at the time, inverting a popular rap trope with “First Day In.” The song, which now appears as the penultimate track on the new project, helps explain why NoCap has begun to cut through in a packed lane of melodic rappers: It’s both deeply personal and invitingly vague, somber and triumphant in equal measure. He sings to open the verse, “Turned myself in in Off-White/Tell myself that it's alright.” A decade removed from Gucci Mane’s “First Day Out,” the celebratory freedom song has become a rap-industry standard, an opportunity for artists to address their fans and capitalize on increased attention. For NoCap, The Hood Dictionary is a mixtape-length “First Day Out,” as he elaborates on traumatic experiences in Mobile, the circumstances that landed him in jail, and his wins in spite of it all. And while the project—NoCap’s second full-length of the year—is an effective showcase of his developing strengths as a singer and storyteller, it primarily serves as a timestamp of this moment in his career rather than as a significant step forward in his catalog. Most listeners outside the region likely first heard NoCap on Lil Baby’s Street Gossip mixtape in November 2018. The two rappers share a twangy vocal register and a love of guitar loops, but NoCap takes the latter to an extreme. Seven of The Hood Dictionary’s 16 songs feature prominent guitar melodies; the results are among some of the project’s most memorable moments, allowing NoCap to find the pocket where he’s clearly most comfortable. “Still Me” is a skillful combination of confessional and catchy writing, “Take Care” is a rare instance of carefree joy amidst the pain songs, and “Heaven Gates” offers a slowed-down moment of introspection: “Mark ain’t never comin’ home, he tried to kill the police/I know the police comin’ home if he ever kill me.” At times, the chords and riffs begin to feel forced. Towards the end of the project, NoCap croons about “F-150s and Durangos” on the hook of “Country Boy,” a strange song that feels generic and cliché in its references. Similarly, the punchlines that have become NoCap’s lyrical calling card are inconsistent. For every entertaining play on words (“Pissin’ haters off, my next chain gon’ be yellow” on “What You Know”) there’s a phrase that falls flat (“My bitch ain’t O’Neal, but I really hope she kill [Shaquille] for me” on “Take Care”). NoCap is capable of making straightforward come-up bangers, “Bankroll” being the strongest example here, but he’s best as a cuttingly honest narrator. When he drops his voice to a low mumble to admit, “I made the wrong decision, they put my sister in jail,” it hits harder than any double entendre. As far as rappers who sing go, NoCap is currently somewhere in the middle of the pack. Over the past year, he’s shown glimmers of solidifying his own distinct voice and moving past the Lil Baby comparisons. On The Hood Dictionary, that comes through clearest in the moments when he’s eulogizing his friend Fred, raising his voice up a few notes to belt out a hook, or describing memories that couldn’t belong to anyone else. But the project feels like a lateral move from The Backend Child, released in May. Even its peaks don’t provide much new information about NoCap or resonate in a way that feels like they’re meant to last into the next decade.","The Alabama rapper’s second project of the year is a mixtape-length “First Day Out” that serves as a timestamp of this moment in his developing career.

No Treasure But Hope,Tindersticks,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddecf99b9e6f50008a3013a/1:1/w_160/notreasure.jpg,2019-12-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tindersticks-no-treasure-but-hope/,City Slang,"Stuart A. Staples opens Tindersticks’ latest album with a note on the nature of beauty, a subject they’ve been pursuing for nearly 30 years now. “For the beauty, give me something to ease,” he sings delicately over Dan McKinna’s mournful piano, which sounds suited to a funeral rather than a new beginning. “For it’s the beauty that’s got its claws in me.” It’s an invasive virus, one that overwhelms your body and soul, that elicits malignant symptoms. Few bands—maybe the Bad Seeds?—have been as interested in the capital-R Romantic notion of beauty as Tindersticks, who set their lush, intricate, often unabashedly beautiful arrangements against dark, pained lyrics about ugly, messy emotions. They’ve thrived on that tension, but on No Treasure But Hope Tindersticks find a way to assuage the pain. It’s one of their most contented and effusive albums, and as a result one of their most immediately accessible. Or, as Staples sings just a few songs later, “There’s a new kind of beauty that I’ve never seen before.” That song, “Pinky in the Daylight,” is something new for Tindersticks: a genuinely sweet declaration of love with no attendant grim irony. The band pulls out all the stops, indulging a dramatic key change, a sensuous pause at the crest of a refrain, a call-and-response of “Yeah, he loves you.” They want you to see the seams of the song, to consider how such overwhelming emotions—love and tenderness, awe and inspiration, hope and calm—are conveyed in music. Staples wrote most of these songs while staying on the Greek island of Ithaca, and there’s a lot of that world on this album, from the map motif of the artwork to the trilling bouzouki that nods to rebetika music of the early 20th century. And there is sunlight in these songs, breaking apart the darkness that has become so familiar in the band. Even a song called “The Amputees,” which may comment on Staples’ experience as an Englishman living on the Continent, hinges on the sincere declaration, “I miss you so bad,” which changes phrasing and therefore implication each time he repeats it. Staples has always drawn on the techniques of American soul singers, but to his credit, he knows the limitations of his distinctive voice, and especially on “The Amputees” he knows how to deploy it to understate his message. With all that light, however, shadows remain. “See My Girls,” the record’s longest song as well as its most daring, is sung from the perspective of a shop owner whose daughters send him postcards from around the world. Those postcards form a flipbook showing the glories and the dangers of the world, “the slanty pillars of Park Güell” in Barcelona along with “the killing fields of Cambodia.” But the song is more an expression of the father’s unending concern, which makes it a very different kind of love song—world-weary, but no less potent.

Netflix & Deal,03 GreedoKenny Beats,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddc4aa02ab68500085d526e/1:1/w_160/netflix.jpg,2019-12-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-kenny-beats-netflix-and-deal/,Alamo,"As 03 Greedo’s 20-year prison bid continues, so too does his bid to remain relevant. He stashed a lot of music away in anticipation of a long hibernation, and his latest is Netflix & Deal, a 13-track collaborative tape with rising producer Kenny Beats. Greedo said that the project is based on movies he watched while he was dealing, and you only have to be half-paying attention to know he meant that literally. These are songs very loosely inspired by his streaming queue, usually about or related to selling drugs in some way. It isn’t the strongest work from either artist, but the white EDM DJ turned rap producer and the face-tatted trap rapper from Watts make a good odd couple. Greedo leaned heavily on his melodies for Still Summer in the Projects, but from the rapid-fire mumbles of “Traffic” to the staggered chants of “Aye Twin,” his raps are center stage here. Greedo has said that making music isn’t a conscious process for him, but this time he at least had some external stimuli: he would watch scenes from his favorite movies on his phone in the studio and then hop in the booth to apply them to his raps. The tape does enough to earn its title, but some of the duo’s most impressive connections come when they aren’t trying to make good on its premise.  Greedo remains one of the best rappers working, even behind bars, and his style is all-purpose: “Payback” flips Big Tymers’ “Still Fly” into a stunter’s anthem, while he pairs off with Maxo Kream for some respect-the-shooter flaunting on “Beg Your Pardon.” Kenny Beats has a way of punching up a rapper’s sound without losing his own: adding more bite to Rico Nasty’s mosh-raps, bringing suavity to Freddie Gibbs's pusher chronicles, warping Atlanta trap for outsider Key!, pushing Vince Staples toward the bounce of SoCal radio. But Greedo told him to set all the “Greedo shit” he’d prepared to the side and give him something else. It’s clear he wanted to branch out in as many directions as possible in his limited time —as he puts it in the making-of doc, “You gotta show ‘em as hard as you would’ve been, in a short period of time.” Thus, Kenny lets Greedo rummage through his recent releases like a kid at a Redbox kiosk. Freddie, Key!, and Vince all appear, and it’s a bit like binging the last two years of Kenny Beats with Greedo offering director’s commentary. The vibe is more couch potato than cinephile, and the tape works because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are Home Alone bars, some character-actor bars you’d expect (Blow’s George Jung) and some you wouldn’t (Stitch from the animated Disney franchise), bars running through the Brad Pitt IMDb, and rapper-movie inception bars (in which Greedo thinks he’s Paid in Full’s Rico, a character played by Cam’ron). Songs like “Blue People” and “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” construct entire snappy hooks out of nothing more than titles. With Netflix & Chill, 03 Greedo and Kenny Beats never try to make a movie; they’re content to be distracted and charmed by them, and that preoccupation becomes contagious.","The incarcerated Watts rapper’s latest is a loosely movie-themed collaboration with producer-of-the-moment Kenny Beats.

Ohio River EP,Caroline Says,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddd7c3a238c6f0008bc091d/1:1/w_160/ohioriver.jpg,2019-12-05 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caroline-says-ohio-river-ep/,Western Vinyl,"Since she began recording as Caroline Says, a sense of displacement has persisted in Caroline Sallee’s music—a looming apprehension that nowhere will feel like home. Her debut 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can’t Be Wrong recounted getting lost on the West Coast, while last year’s lovely No Fool Like an Old Fool mourned her dwindling relationship with her hometown. The namesake waterway of Sallee’s new Ohio River EP touches neither her native Alabama nor her current home base in Texas, but geographic location isn’t important here. Everything is transitory, Sallee seems to say, especially life itself. On Ohio River, Sallee’s top concerns are mortality and time’s tendency to slip away. “I was so young when I left town/But then again, I never felt that young anyhow,” she muses on dreamy opener “Falling Knife.” Death is coming, she reminds us, and it’s coming soon. When she sighs, “One day your body’s in the ground and your soul is in the sky and it don’t take long,” her words sound more like an affirmation than a warning. The narrator of “Ohio River” revisits the small town where they grew up and realizes that they’ve become an entirely different person—a common theme for Sallee. The memories are fond yet pained as the song’s characters turn their gaze to the lapping river. How does one cope when everything changes? Expanding the electronic and ambient influences introduced on No Fool, Ohio River’s hazy, unassuming dream-pop sounds ever so slightly out of reach. Sallee continues to namecheck classic influences: Swinging breakup tune “Smoke and Mirrors” crosses Pixies with Springsteen’s “Hungry Heart,” while the hypnotic “Year of the Cicada” is indebted to composer John Barry’s vintage James Bond scores. “Falling Knife,” the EP’s strongest point, soars with an electric guitar line and swelling synths inspired by David Bowie’s “Heroes” (co-written by Brian Eno). Sallee’s sound is foggier and more reserved, but “Falling Knife” offers a similar sense of reverie. “Everything I knew is gone now/But somehow nothing feels brand new,” Sallee murmurs on “Ohio River.” It’s a fitting thesis for the EP, which feels more like a postscript to No Fool than a separate venture. If that album was a starting point, then Ohio River lies somewhere along the journey to Sallee’s next destination.","On singer-songwriter Caroline Sallee’s latest EP, everything is transitory—especially life itself.

Songs for You,Tinashe,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddd7e0a238c6f0008bc091f/1:1/w_160/songsforyou.jpg,2019-12-04 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tinashe-songs-for-you/,self-released,"When Tinashe split with long-time record label RCA in February, it seemed like an opportunity for a reset. After the L.A. singer released one of the best R&B debuts of the decade in 2014, she quickly chased it with a run of homogenous singles meant to foment hype for what was an eventually inert follow-up released four drawn-out years later. Many of the problems stemmed from RCA’s rumored and occasionally confirmed meddling, whether selling songs out from under her or arranging awkward guest features and promotion. Tinashe has since publicly celebrated the separation in interviews and on social media, and for good reason: Free from the music industry, the multitalented artist is now able to go in whatever direction she pleases, unburdened by expectations of a radio single or big first-week sales. Songs for You, Tinashe’s first full-length project released under her own label and management, is a welcome return to form, evoking those moody early mixtapes and 2016’s compelling Nightride while pushing forward. It also stands as a statement of purpose against the industry that fumbled her bag. (She even released the project on a Thursday to “throw a wrench” in those never-ending sales discussions.) Compared to the strain of Joyride, Songs for You feels effortless, drifting between subterranean trap, airy dance-pop, and R&B ballads. Her floor-fillers are compellingly mutated, full of sharp pivots; if the moving parts can be jarring to follow, they’re never boring. Heatsick lead single “Die a Little Bit” hinges on a numb, head-spinning chorus that strips her best club-ready benders for parts: “Drink, smoke, dance, vibe a little bit,” she and South London rapper Ms Banks recite over spare garage production, adding “Fuck, change, ride, die a little bit.” She spars with a filthy G-Eazy over a hollowed-out beat before moving into an acoustic, two-minute outro that quotes “Midnight Sun,” the mellow centerpiece of her 2013 mixtape Black Water. The reference feels intimate and real, a callback for Tinashe diehards and a reimagining of the phantom-limb sadness that occasionally accompanies the aftermath of a hookup. Make no mistake: She fully takes time to talk her shit, too. The swanky “Cash Race” and “Link Up,” both Hitmaka productions that revolve around winding beat changes halfway through, are prime showcases for Tinashe’s melodic flow and shrugged-off boasts. The songs were originally meant for a shelved, hip-hop-focused project last summer, but here they instead provide a quick, satisfying glimmer of that bossed-up version of herself, with devilishly opulent lyrics about Brink’s trucks and private flights. All of these different moods find balance thanks to Tinashe, a rebuke to anyone who thought she couldn’t work in this many different styles. She can embody “Nashe Houdini doing tricks with a saw” on “Link Up” and she can carry the melancholy soul of the hazy 6LACK duet “Touch & Go.” It isn’t fair that it took years of label mishandling to get here, but Tinashe has finally found equilibrium.","After freeing herself from a bad record deal, the multitalented R&B singer celebrates with an effortless LP that fully displays her range.

It’s been eight years since Shady Records stopped Yelawolf’s career cold with Radioactive, a misguided bid to repackage the rough-edged rapper as a crossover star, and since then Marshall Mathers has stopped treating his signees as lottery tickets. He’s taken an especially hands-off approach with Griselda, the bloody-knuckled Buffalo trio whose Shady Records debut never veers from the hardcore hip-hop of their self-released solo projects and mixtapes. While their mastery of mid-’90s-worshipping East Coast rap has earned them a devoted following, Shady has bowed to the reality that the gritty trio is an inherently niche act. No Skylar Grey feature or Alex da Kid production is going to broaden their appeal. Brothers Conway and Westside Gunn and first cousin Benny the Butcher don’t even bother with choruses, stitching their coke-dusted, bullet-riddled crime tales together with ad-libbed gun sounds instead. Griselda’s first full group outing, WWCD offers something their solo efforts only featured intermittently: interplay. On “Chef Dreds” and “Scotties,” the relatives trade bars and finish each other’s thoughts, playing Westside Gunn’s nasally shit talk against Conway’s cold slur and Benny the Butcher’s bruiser swagger. These three are at their best at their most untamed, and WWCD is the crew’s most unrelentingly raucous showcase yet. In keeping with its predecessors, the project was produced by Griselda’s house beat makers Daringer and Beat Butcha, Wu-Tang evangelists who serve the same dependable meal again and again, never offering a twist. On the crew’s solo projects, that monotony could begin to tire, but here it keeps the focus where it belongs, on the trio’s brutal wordplay and sour back-and-forth. These three have no problem sustaining intrigue on their own. Griselda is hardly the only crew nailing the feel of ’90s hip-hop, but they also conjure the heightened reality of the era in a way few of its imitators do. Without succumbing to silliness, they push the violence to fantastical extremes, half horrific, half cartoonish (the interlude “Kennedy” is just 42 seconds of Westside Gunn repeating “blow your fucking face off” and making boom noises). They don’t skimp on the punchlines, either, especially Benny: “I’m 5’8” but 6’11” if I stand on my bricks,” he boasts on “Moselle.” Most of the album’s guests slot themselves seamlessly into the mood, including Raekwon, who offers a symbolic cosign of the crew on the spoken opener “Marchello,” and 50 Cent, who relishes rolling around in the mud on “City on the Map.” The glaring exception is the most high-profile one: Eminem, who does his equivalent of Diddy dancing in Bad Boy videos on the album-closing remix of the Conway track “Bang.” For 46 showy bars it’s all about Shady as Eminem runs through his greatest hits, spitting hyper-technical dick jokes and reminiscing about the great beefs of his TRL heyday. It’s not ideal—the verse feels pumped in from another plane of existence, and it undoes the grimy mood the rest of the record sets so meticulously—but it’s easy enough to skip. And if Eminem’s star power is what it takes to introduce this trio to a slightly wider audience, then so be it.","The Buffalo trio’s Shady Records debut doesn’t sacrifice an ounce of their gritty and ruthless throwback aesthetic.

HyperSwim,Various Artists,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dded703238c6f0008bc0a48/1:1/w_160/hyperswim.jpg,2019-12-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-hyperswim/,HyperdubAdult Swim,"The journey from Hyperdub’s 10th to its 15th birthday has proved as exciting and change-ridden as the equivalent passage into human adolescence. It’s not that the London label has abandoned its childhood friends—longtime pals Burial, Cooly G, Ikonika, and DJ Taye are all here to blow out the candles on this anniversary compilation—but they mingle with new acquaintances, who bring international poise to the party. Hyperdub always was a globally-minded label, providing one of the first homes for footwork outside of Chicago and taking an early interest in South African electronics. But as recently as 2014, the label still felt like a reflection of the London underground; the four compilations released to mark its first decade gravitated around the sprawling UK bass continuum, from grime to funky, garage to dubstep, gilded by touches of R&B, footwork, and techno. HyperSwim, released in collaboration with anarchic cartoon network Adult Swim, is an altogether more cosmopolitan beast, held together more by the spirit of innovation than local circumstance. London is represented by the likes of Burial, Dean Blunt, and Cooly G, but they rub shoulders with artists from Cape Town (Angel-Ho), Angola (Nazar), Turin (Mana) and Philadelphia (Mhysa). As well as this geographical drift, HyperSwim captures Hyperdub’s growing agnosticism to genre. Even the most eagerly informed listener would struggle to say exactly what kind of music this album contains, with Hyperdub tapping into a global electronic underground for whom genre is little more than a SoundCloud tag. That might sound like a recipe for chaos, but HyperSwim works these diverse sounds into recognisable strands of shape and feel, allowing the listener to drift from the sweetly naive, deconstructed pop of Mhysa’s “Games”—whose un-AutoTuned vocal and rambling feel remind me of Sarah Records’ hair-clip indie—to Fatima Al Qadiri’s deliriously dystopian “Filth” without feeling any jarring changes. Broadly speaking, the album starts sparse and melodic, accelerates through the biting rhythms of New Jersey club, then closes with thunderous four-to-the-floor drums. But nothing is quite as it seems on this devious beat excursion. DJ Taye may be a member of legendary footwork crew Teklife, but his “Inferno” owes as much to Three 6 Mafia’s proto-trap as it does to DJ Rashad; Doon Kanda appears to have sucked all the life out of a Ricardo Villalobos production to create the nightmarish haunted house of “Perfume”; and Mana’s contribution, “Climbing the Walls,” sounds simultaneously fast and slow, a spectral guitar sample coming up against racing hi-hats. For all HyperSwim’s futuristic feel, the standout tracks largely come from the label’s established artists. Burial’s “Old Tape” is a wonky masterpiece that combines the familiar crackle and murk with an unexpected ’80s pop touch reminiscent of Inner City, Jan Hammer, and Enya; label founder Kode9’s marvellous “Cell3” sounds like orchestral grime being slowly sucked through a supermassive black hole; and Laurel Halo’s “Crush” is a bizarrely funky mixture of broken beats, bleeps, and the roar of the hopeless void. But as with most compelling compilations, HyperSwim’s success doesn’t come down to individual tracks. Instead, its brilliance lies in its cohesion and disparity: the way it teases a logical narrative out of decentralized musical moods without sacrificing artistic individuality.","Kode9’s Hyperdub label celebrates its 15th anniversary by moving confidently beyond the London club music’s conventions.

Produced mostly with Pharrell, his 14th album is a breezy song cycle that rarely rises above a warped, shimmering sigh. Following 2014’s densely orchestrated Morning Phase and 2017’s labored pop turn Colors, it immediately feels like a relief. Like his best records, you can imagine the mood board hanging in the studio—synth-pop, vaporwave, trap beats, the future as imagined in ’80s movies—as he bends his influences into new shapes. At first, the plan was to collaborate with Pharrell on just one song, but after a few sessions, they felt there was more ground to cover within this gently psychedelic landscape. It was a good instinct. The album sounds best when they stick to the plan. The cloying, stomp-clap single “Saw Lightning” is an outlier; it’s also the type of song that might have kept Beck up at night after “Loser” threatened to turn him into a one-hit wonder a quarter-century ago. Maybe he imagined himself at 49 searching for a hit while rapping over distorted slide guitar and so he decided to pivot his career in every other conceivable direction, as quickly as possible. “I would have thrived in a time like this,” he recently told NME. “I was creating so much music and my limitation was that I didn’t have the equipment to record myself. If I had a laptop and SoundCloud I would have loved it.” His sentiment rings true—particularly in a year when the biggest breakout hit was a grungy, tossed-off hip-hop-country hybrid—but his use of the past tense speaks louder. Why isn’t Beck thriving in a time like this? He’s found himself in a strange position. Kind of like the Flaming Lips, he has been grandfathered into the role of an eccentric major-label lifer, and, like the Flaming Lips, he occasionally wanders into the interesting-in-theory vanity project netherworld. But Beck still adheres to old-school tenets of the industry: big singles, high-profile collaborations, brand partnerships. Hyperspace was previewed with a blandly conventional Amazon Exclusive set of Prince covers, an especially damning moment as it coincided with the 20-year anniversary of Midnite Vultures, Beck’s spiritual tribute to Prince. It’s been a long time since he successfully integrated his personality and his music. On a trajectory more like a blockbuster film franchise, his biggest release of the decade was essentially a reboot of 2002’s Sea Change. Despite its missteps, the smooth, twilight sound of Hyperspace pushes him toward new territory. During the second half of the record, the sky seems to darken and the songs bind together into a mini-suite with overlapping themes and melodies. It culminates with a gospel choir bursting out of “Everlasting Nothing,” but the whole record works toward a more muted kind of celebration. Along the way, there are guest verses from Pharrell and L.A. songwriter Terrell Hines, undetectable vocals from Sky Ferreira and Coldplay’s Chris Martin, and yet the mood remains intimate, solitary even. Its best songs—“Chemical,” “Dark Places”—are like lullabies delivered from a space shuttle with just one person on it. You can feel the distance. The results are consistently pleasant to listen to, though there’s a subtle dissonance between medium and message. Thematically these ballads draw a line to Sea Change, Beck’s initial foray into heartbreak and sincerity. Many of the songs on Hyperspace continue a weary road narrative, their lush settings just a blur outside a moving window. A few moments allude to his recent divorce from actress Marissa Ribisi and another makes a direct, slightly jarring reference to using heroin. But all of them search for escape in their vague, downer narratives. He rarely focuses on any thought for too long, and the transience works in his favor. If he’s going to drift, at least he’ll enjoy the view. “I feel so ugly when you see through me,” he sings midway through the album. At one point in his career, it might have sounded like a confession, back when his constant reinventions felt like a defense against being pigeonholed. On those early records, he’d bury apocalyptic visions in music that was playful and referential, rarely drawing attention to how much thought was being poured into every decision. Nowadays, it’s less rewarding to dig for the substance beneath his aesthetics. There’s less to see through. “There was a point where I was, like, ‘Is this over?’” he recently admitted to the New Yorker. “But I wake up with songs going. Melodies, harmonies, a bass line. It’s like there’s a radio station playing in my head all the time.” Listening to Hyperspace provides a similar experience—sometimes he hits pure signal, and sometimes it’s just background noise as he gets to wherever he’s going next.

Cotillions,William Patrick Corgan,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddd805d238c6f0008bc0923/1:1/w_160/cotillions.png,2019-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/william-patrick-corgan-cotillions/,Martha's Music,"Billy Corgan has forced his fans to reconcile a whole mess of contradictions over the past 30 years. He’s the self-branded zero who became a hero to millions. He’s the would-be Vince McMahon who also owned a tea shop. He’s a friend to cute cats and ugly monsters alike. He is both the bull-headed autocrat who does and says whatever he wants regardless of what anyone thinks, and the thin-skinned reactionary who seems to care very much. His days as a multi-platinum, game-changing force are two decades in the rear view, yet he remains a towering figure in the pop-cultural landscape, if only because he’s been one of this century’s most reliable sources of WTF clickbait. So it’s telling that, in the thick of the most recent Smashing Pumpkins reunion drama, Corgan resurrected—and rebranded—his long-dormant solo career. In 2017, he issued Ogilala under his birth name, William Patrick Corgan, making it his first solo effort since The Future Embrace was released 12 years prior. It was a surprising move; the various recombinant versions of the Pumpkins he had fielded in the interim underscored the fact that Corgan was the last musician on Earth who needed a solo vehicle. But the understated Ogilala suggested that Corgan wasn’t just seeking an outlet for quieter music (something his main band has always been happy to accommodate). Rather, its acoustic and piano-based meditations represented both a dismantling of the Pumpkins’ wall of sound, and of the Billy Corgan persona itself, by projecting a grace and humility at odds with his combative public image. Still, an acoustic Corgan album couldn’t help but sound like Smashing Pumpkins Unplugged, and the string arrangements woven through Ogilala offered not-too-distant echoes of his band’s epic bombast. So on his second William Patrick Corgan effort, Cotillions, he takes that same busker aesthetic to a place even the Pumpkins feared to tread: deep into the heartland. Cotillions presents Corgan’s vision of country music, a genre he had long dismissed until he recently realized that its sepia-toned portraits of America’s past offered insight into his family’s hardscrabble history. And like everything he does, Corgan goes all in: The album was written following a road trip through America and recorded with a crew of Nashville session veterans (along with current Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder and one-time touring bassist Katie Cole). It’s rife with impressionistic Southern-gothic images of old-time religion, girls named Clementine, and suicides in the desert. But beyond the novelty of Corgan donning his cowboy hat in earnest, what distinguishes Cotillions from anything in his discography is its mood. Quite simply, these are some of the most casual and contented songs he’s ever produced. Corgan’s droning voice isn’t the most natural fit for these rustic settings. But he embraces his fish-out-of-water position by letting his unvarnished vocals playfully scuff against the fiddlin’, pedal-steel sweeps, and female backing vocals that gussy up these tunes. Off-the-cuff charmers like the ’69-Stones honky tonk of “Buffalo Boys” and the Depression-themed dustbowl ballad “Hard Times” function as a sort of Westworld simulacrum of country music, where the close attention to period authenticity ultimately amplifies their uncanny qualities. (Few country songs open with a line like “scream like jets off to Orion,” as the latter does.) But the album also proves Corgan is at his most disarming in intimate spaces: The delicate, finger-picked lullaby “Fragile, the Spark” is a reminder that he covered Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” way before it was cool, while “Neptulius” is a work of soft-focus beauty whose banjo-kissed melody line ebbs and flows like the gentlest of ocean waves. According to Pumpkins lore, “Neptulius” is a title that’s been bouncing around Corgan’s head for quite some time—it was reportedly the original proposed name of the band’s 1994 castaways collection Pisces Iscariot, a record that showed, for all his musical excesses, Corgan was a shrewd editor when it came to sequencing his proper albums. Alas, that acumen fails him here. At 17 tracks and 62 minutes, Cotillions is advertised as a double album, but it never really forms a discernible dramatic arc or a logical flow that suggests four discrete sides. Instead, the most cataclysmic songs (like the title track) arrive too early and the most languid ones (like the piano reverie “6+7”) turn up when the record should be building to a climax. The sense of stasis is compounded by the fact that, like Ogilala, Cotillions is 100 percent drum-free, and Corgan’s laidback strums aren’t enough to keep the momentum going once fiddle-inflected serenades like “Dancehall” and “Cri De Coeur” start to blur into one another. For all its surface simplicity, Cotillions is saddled with its own peculiar Corganian paradox: the lightest, breeziest songs of his career add up to a demanding slog of a record.","The cantankerous Smashing Pumpkin embraces his vision of country music, but the lightest, breeziest songs of his career come with their own peculiar Corganian paradox.

Information,Galcher Lustwerk,by: Nathan Taylor Pemberton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd827d805384d0009df3e69/1:1/w_160/information.jpg,2019-12-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/galcher-lustwerk-information/,Ghostly InternationalGhostly International,"Galcher Lustwerk has finally come in from the cold. After six years of moving like a silhouette across club floors, the New York producer is up to something far more conspicuous. Information, his third full-length (and first for Ghostly International), dispenses with the shadow play and arrives like a no-frills dispatch from the border region of burnout and sensory glut. Now, Lustwerk passes as old guard, and he’s at ease whenever his tracks are most on edge. The 12 compositions that make up Information have evolved his sensual, liquid style into one that distills the contradictory logics of the digital age—it’s tense, airless, and paranoid without losing an inch of his comic swagger or mischievous irony, a sensibility cultivated by bone-deep cultural exhaustion. The unconstrained lushness of Lustwerk’s past productions has undergone austerity measures: He’s gutted the interiors of his hypnotic house, leaving behind only the raw materials as Information’s sonic architecture. Crisp live drum samples replace the excessively tweaked-out kicks and crushed snares of his early repertoire. While his mixes are often pushed into the red, Lustwerk has throttled back the voltage. Each track on Information sports shellacked surface tension, glossy and high-resolution.  The back-to-back sequencing of “I See a Dime” and “Another Story” quickly establishes this disciplined palette. On each track, sharpened hi-hats skip over tightened bongo patterns or clave bursts, clearing up space for new streams of information: sparse synths, moving like viscous tides strategically expanded by taut stereo delays. Lustwerk devotees might need a moment to adjust to the unused square footage. Information, as a whole, finds definition in its heady ambiguity. The logic that guides his production works like a redacted document, the producer withholding key parcels of information (a verse, a key change, a new melody) for as long as he can get away with it. On “Been a Long Night,” a loose groove topped off with dizzy synth pads and glassy digital piano, Lustwerk holds off on introducing the song’s first verse until the three-minute mark. Once the flow cuts in—“Damn, just my type/Been a long night, yeah/It’s been a long night”—Lustwerk drops out one of the muddier synths, swapping it for a stern bassline that immediately sharpens the track’s focus. No sound or detail on Information arrives without a censor’s level of scrutiny, or suspicion: Lustwerk as public information officer, dispensing his like an official statement. Even if it’s a bit, or the latest iteration of his persona, Lustwerk never breaks the self-serious pose. This consistency, while laudable, is double-edged: Information can be so in the cut that it leaves itself unable to make any sudden moves. It makes you miss the unpredictable zigs and zags of Lustwerk’s pre-Dark Bliss material, which was always trying to outrun our expectations. Lustwerk is confronting them, rather. Instead of retreating into the hazy, nocturnal electronics that he perfected on 200% Galcher and Dark Bliss, or logging off entirely, he offers a bearable take on the fatigue collectively suffered by anyone plugged into modern information networks. The attrition of 24/7 connection is the theme that underpins Information. In a recent conversation with DJ Mag, Lustwerk explained his headspace:  “With this album especially, that there’s this undercurrent of being really, really burnt out,” he continues. “For the past two years, I was burnt out, all of the time. I’m almost... inoperable, you know.” There’s little daylight between that feeling and how he renders it on the album. “Information overload, man/Occupation overlord, man,” Lustwerk says on “Bit,” a deconstructed funk that moves like Fresh-era Sly and the Family Stone. At each of the album’s scene changes, Lustwerk’s wordplay keeps looping and interlocking around paranoid subtexts. Lustwerk, the avatar, the man, can’t seem to shake some all-seeing eye. A virutal chase sequence runs the distance of the album from “Another Story” (“Got my shoes on my feet/Got my cash got my keys out the door on the street/People following me get the fuck off my back/Go the fuck off the map”) to album closer “Speed” (“Running out of time/What’s it gonna be/Who you wanna be/Do you got some speed/Do you got control/Do you know your role”). The burnt-out optics of Information would be fatalistic if not for Lustwerk’s ability to work in a fantasy headspace according to a warped set of coordinates. One of his boldest statements to date, “Cig Angel” isn’t cleanly located in the realm of hip-house or left-field R&B or dance music. It’s a sedated anthem few would have imagined Lustwerk producing, a love song for the pre-dawn. Nervous and quavering chords find relief in the track’s cool, restrained drums. Above the mix, Lustwerk’s oxidized voice whispers the word “angel”—a deliciously simple hook that will survive the obsolescence of electronic anthems similar to it. The fantasy of Information feels less like an attempt at creating cinematic ambience or cold, urban moods, and more like an investigation of the stretch between darkness of night and daybreak. Here, Lustwerk’s game is to see how long you can sustain something like the state the novelist William Gibson is said to have found his stories in—“Not dreams, but that state adjacent to sleep, the mind on waking”—before dissolving into screens or restless slumber.

Somewhere City,Origami Angel,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de53ae09669180008bb62e6/1:1/w_160/somewherecity.jpg,2019-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/origami-angel-somewhere-city/,Chatterbot,"More than any indie rock sub-genre, modern emo is largely driven by “the kids”—the fans, the bands, even the industry benefactors are often high school or college kids, with almost no degree of separation between them in the message boards and Facebook groups that make the whole thing run. As a result, recent influence spreads quickly, which is both exhilarating and frustrating to anyone trying to follow the scene’s rapid turnover. If Origami Angel’s Somewhere City is unrecognizable as a scene-defining emo record for someone who stopped paying attention around The Hotelier’s Home, Like NoPlace is There, it’s because Origami Angel wasn’t the kind of emo band that existed en masse five years ago. Ryland Heagy and Pat Doherty emerged from a void created in 2016 by Modern Baseball’s newfound desire to transcend the Philly party emo they once perfected as well as the cancellation of one-time next big thing JANK—all of a sudden, there was a wave of bands fluent in memes, math rock, the lingua franca of therapeutic self-empowerment, and community building. Among this group, Origami Angel’s chops and brand stewardship immediately stood out. They released entire EPs themed around Pokemon, full of strident skate-punk vocals and tapping runs they’d be more than happy to map out on Guitar Hero. They were undeniably fun, but Somewhere City gives them a newfound sense of purpose. In Somewhere City, “watching Danny Phantom, eating Happy Meals” is encouraged as a form of self-actualization, people expose their raw feelings without judgment, and if things get awkward, there’s always a sympathetic “whoa” or “woo!” waiting from your new best friends. They’re one of those duos that sounds bigger than two people through hyperactivity—the tapping runs, Drop-D dissonance, power chord sequences and handclaps of “Doctor Whomst” are held together by sheer momentum, a quality that does more to keep Somewhere City coherent rather than its conceptual underpinning. Origami Angel never let up for more than five seconds, save for the twinkly arpeggios that serve as Somewhere City’s introductory scene setting (and even “Welcome To…” ends in gratuitously overdubbed gang vocals). The production is cleaner and brighter compared to May’s four-track EP Gen 3, but the hyperspeed approach actually has the effect of downplaying the impressive sophistication and complexity of Somewhere City’s musicality. If Somewhere City finds itself unable to bridge a generation gap, it’s not due to any of its musical qualities—for anyone over the age of 30, they can be heard as celebration rockers taking the baton or beer from Japandroids or Fang Island. But after decades of being dismissed as strictly a vehicle for solipsistic, suburban angst, emo in 2010s has swung in the opposite direction, and Somewhere City’s relentless positivity can exert an uncomfortable peer pressure on the listener to conflate great intentions with art itself. Are you feeling sad and alone? Origami Angel will be there for you with chicken nuggets and a shoulder to cry on. Did you know that you’re special just the way you are? Did you ever wish every song on Bleed American had the message of “The Middle”? There’s no doubting Origami Angel’s sincerity, but its tendency to immediately reframe any uglier emotions undercuts their conceptual ambitions and makes the “I Just Want to Sell Out My Funeral”-style montage that recaps the nine previous songs feel a bit unearned. Somewhere City is an invigorating place to spend a half hour, but Origami Angel would be wise to explore the darkness on the edge of town.","With their skate-punk shout-alongs and double-tapped guitar heroics, this D.C. duo embodies the sound of emo in 2019.

1999,Prince,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2cb9281418c0009878d3e/1:1/w_160/1999.jpg,2019-12-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prince-1999/,Warner Bros.,"It does not require a particularly close reading to see 1999 as a text about partying in spite of looming disaster, or even to stave it off. There’s that coda to “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” (“You and I know we gotta die someday” sandwiched between one lyric about giving yourself to God and another pledging to “have fun every motherfucking night”); there’s the title track, which opens the album by signaling that the whole thing might be a fever dream, and ends with Lisa Coleman cooing, “Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?” It might have been tempting, in 1982, to see Prince’s experiments with synthesizers and programmed drums to be of a piece with these anxieties, emerging sounds turned against emerging fears. It might be tempting, now, to let those once cutting-edge technologies—which now read as obvious date markers—cast those same anxieties as relics of a far-off era. But those competing threads that Prince drew out so well—a smirking nihilism and a kind of empathy that posits lust and humanism as the same thing—have never disappeared from pop music, and his ability to marshal the Reagan years and the LM-1 for his own purposes, the way he had already done with the tropes of rock and funk, has rarely been replicated, before or after the Berlin Wall came down. And so 1999, which is now being reissued by Warner Records as part of a five-disc set that also includes B-sides, demos, unreleased songs, and concert footage, is the rare record that has come to define its era while also existing outside of it, a masterpiece that immediately precedes the albums Prince fashioned, conspicuously, as masterpieces. The album proper sounds, as it always has, like a computer breathing. (The songs have been remastered, and while they sound rich and clear on car speakers and in headphones, it feels beside the point to listen to “D.M.S.R.” out of anything but the nearly-blown monitors inside an overheated First Avenue.) Even a massive, mainstream hit like “Little Red Corvette”—the first Prince song that charted higher on Billboard’s pop chart than the R&B one—begins as if it’s climbing out of a digital muck. “Delirious” sounds like it comes from a very sexual lab experiment that went exactly according to plan. The music is unfailingly funky while still remarkably controlled, precise in the way that a purposefully askew movie prop is precise. And still, 1999 sprawls: ten of its 11 songs clock longer than five minutes, spiraling outward or, in the case of “Automatic,” locking into a long groove that asks, as we all have at one time or another, ‘What if the aliens fuck?’ It is exploratory without ever becoming impenetrable, “indulgent” but never boring. There is as always the tonal slipperiness that makes Prince’s music so rich to revisit: All the in-jokes and scathing subliminals of “All the Critics Love U In New York” come just two tracks after “Free,” which is marked by disarmingly sincere patriotism. Of course, there’s only one utterance of the word “sincere” on the album: “I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth.” The demos, alternate takes, and edits of 1999 album tracks, which are mostly confined to this set’s second disc, almost invariably give the impression that Prince and his bandmates arrived at the correct stopping point when assembling the final version of the record. But this reissue includes a number of truly essential B-sides from the album’s rollout, like the tender, piano-only “How Come You Don’t Call Me Anymore?” and the brief, buoyant “Horny Toad.” (Devoted fans will recognize songs like the stuttering “Purple Music,” which was included in live sets for years and has been floating around in various forms since the ‘90s; it also features “Moonbeam Levels,” which was first released on the posthumous greatest-hits album 4Ever.) The final disc of the set, the audio from a concert that took place on November 30, 1982 in Detroit, is brimming with the energy that Prince routinely brought to stage. (Also included is a DVD of a show from a month later, in Houston.) And while there are more of those edits and alternate versions than almost any fan will want to wade through, some of these completely (or mostly) unheard songs, like the shimmering “Money Don’t Grow on Trees” or “Rearrange,” which cleverly juxtaposes a playful vocal with a serrated electric guitar, deliver what box sets of this kind almost never do: the thrill of discovery, the feeling that a genuinely great song is, at last, free.

Reflections,Hannah Diamond,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddbf5bd5ea46d0008cdee26/1:1/w_160/reflections.jpg,2019-12-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hannah-diamond-reflections/,PC Music,"Hannah Diamond’s “Pink and Blue” still sounds bizarre and striking: like a record Hey Arnold!’s Helga Pataki would make with chintzy synth plugins and one day of voice lessons. The track helped catapult PC Music, the collective Diamond and producers A. G. Cook and Danny L Harle belonged to, from SoundCloud oddity to sonic architects for the mainstream: Carly Rae Jepsen, David Guetta, Madonna. But while the producers have become big names (by producer standards), besides early collaborator SOPHIE the vocalists largely have not. Part of that’s how you define success; Diamond’s had her own breakthrough as a visual designer, collaborating with artists like Offset and Years & Years’ Olly Alexander. Part of it’s that PC Music’s vocalists present themselves less as singer-songwriters—as real people—than high concepts. (An early headline: “Hannah Diamond Is Real.”) More simply, “Pink and Blue” came out in 2013 and now it is 2019. And while Diamond’s cohort have expanded their sound—to the apocalyptic scope of OIL OF EVERY PEARL’s UN-INSIDES, the New Age soaring of Caroline Polachek’s Pang, or Charli XCX’s bangers-as-an-ethos Pop 2—Diamond’s new album Reflections pretty much still sounds like 2013. That’s because it’s not far removed: Reflections was meant to be a 2016 EP, and over the past decade, most of the tracks have been released piecemeal via mixes and one-offs. If you hate PC Music, you will continue to; if you love them, Reflections will not change that. But producer A. G. Cook’s done a lot since 2013, so inevitably, these tracks register less as individual Cook songs than as types of Cook song. There are the ones derived from trance, like “True,” which is like trying to recreate a Sash! song in a MIDI sequencer stuck on a slow BPM. There are the ones that emulate video games, like “Fade Away,” which might as well be an arrangement of the star maze music from Super Mario Land 2. There are the ones, like “Shy,” that sound like the Jock Jams that sound like “Party Rock Anthem.” “Never Again” sounds as if Cook, who recently became Charli XCX’s creative director, were so inspired by her True Romance song “Take My Hand” that he decided to remake it on a music box. (It also has vinyl crackles, which on a Hannah Diamond record are like taking a face-bedazzling app and making the icon a skeuomorphistic wardrobe.) Throughout, Diamond sings largely in straight-tone chorister voice, free of vibrato or aggression —all the better to rush it through AutoTune glissandos, or singe it with electricity, or let it ping away like a metronome. Her lyrics detail love and heartbreak through affectless matter-of-fact recollections like, “I kissed his face in a different place”—a new hookup recalled with all the pulsing romantic immediacy of an Achewood punchline. If there’s an overarching mood, it’s subversiveness: little nihilistic or dissociated asides, the hints of lowered expectations on “Fade Away” (“I always thought I’d be the picture saved on your screen”) or “Make Believe,” a love song delivered less to a person than to an idealized concept. This kind of cleverness has arguably become the going mode for pop; Sofi Tukker essentially rewrote “Make Believe” this year on “Fantasy,” and Diamond’s general shtick has been adopted by LIZ and Poppy. But that doesn’t mean Diamond was first, either. The joke of “Shy” is that you’re too shy to confess your feelings but not too shy to belt about them loudly—the same joke as another “Shy,” from the fairytale musical Once Upon a Mattress. Diamond’s said in interviews that Reflections comes from real emotional experience, but it’s hard to imagine a listener using these songs for actual crushes, or breakups, or parties, or anything outside one’s own head. It’s all very conceptual; this isn’t “pop music is deep actually,” or even “pop music is fun”; it’s “pop music is shallow as hell, and by the way, isn’t shallow uncanny?” Teen pop does not sound like this. EDM, trance, J-pop, any stated inspiration: none totally sound like this. Really, very little in pop has sounded like this at any point, at least not before the PC Music crew started producing it themselves. There’s a certain freedom there. “No one’s going to be as freaked out by [my music] now,” Diamond told Vice, with some relief. And it’s true; not only will no one be freaked out, Diamond and company have rearranged collective musical tastes around themselves. But it also makes Reflections a little anticlimactic. Tellingly, the most striking track is a cover: “Concrete Angel,” which isn’t the Martina McBride song (though that would be something) but the Gareth Emery/Christina Novelli trance hit. From the first notes, it’s from a different, less online world: a bassline with sinew and sweat, a lyric and melody that yearn and swoon with minimal AutoTune futzing (for Diamond, at least). Then, the track polymorphs. First comes a snap track and “Popcorn” synths. Then, a Dannii Minogue-y spoken-word interlude. Then, a happy hardcore remix. Then a fidgety, snippetized double-time track. Then something approaching breakcore. More happens in these four minutes than the rest of the album combined; it’s exhilarating, and the visceral emotion of the beginning makes the re-re-remixing feel like a release, rather than a gimmick. “Concrete Angel” isn’t new either—it provided the title of Diamond’s 2017 mix Soon I won’t see you at all—but it’s a reminder of when PC Music sounded like the future, rather than just sounding like themselves.","Heavy on vocal processing and maximalist A. G. Cook production, the PC Music star’s first full-length can’t help feeling a little anticlimactic.

The Envoy,Gavilán Rayna Russom,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddbf6de6d950f000895d677/1:1/w_160/theenvoy.jpg,2019-12-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gavilan-rayna-russom-the-envoy/,Ecstatic,"While any music might be speculative fiction—an answer to the question, “What if the world sounded like this?”—experimental electronic music twined itself to science fiction from the start. The first movie to have a completely electronic score was 1956’s Forbidden Planet, blazing a trail leading through Wendy Carlos’ A Clockwork Orange and Mica Levi’s Uncanny-Valley-of-the-Dolls experiments for Under the Skin. Gavilán Rayna Russom has been exploring strange new worlds under her own name and various aliases for more than 20 years, but The Envoy is a particularly concise dispatch. Her early records, like 2003’s El Monte (made with Delia Gonzalez) and Black Meteoric Star’s 2009 self-titled debut, sprawled as they gradually unfurled tangled kosmische and techno webs in single takes. As Russom became an occasional member of LCD Soundsystem, her own releases grew rougher and tougher, sounding closer in spirit to the Long Island Electrical Systems label and New York’s travelling poly-everything Unter parties. The Envoy explores different territory: Ursula K. LeGuin’s outrageously fascinating 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness, in which an ambassador from an interstellar equivalent of the UN explores a frozen planet populated by otherwise agender beings who periodically flux anatomically between male and female, depending on who strikes their fancy. Then they fuck. “As someone whose experience of gender has been complex, layered, and has tended to exist completely outside all social norms and categories,” Russom explained in a statement announcing the album and her gender transition, “I felt I was being seen.” She’s put that vision into practice, developing nine lovely tracks in tribute to LeGuin’s masterpiece. Opener “Changelings in the Human Cradle” arrives in a brief bloom of scratch and haze, a rocket settling into a puff of ice dust. Closer “Winter” gradually crystalizes into angles of echoing piano chords, gathering stillness around itself. Between them, the album discovers unctuous sinews of industrial dub in “Strength Out of the Dark” and “I Bleed I Weep I Sweat”; on headphones, these tracks might tickle the ear, but when played loud in a room, they storm. “Place Inside the Blizzard,” whose title references an interzone in the book that is populated by suicides and ice-bladed grass, casts an unshakable chill. It’s like ASMR for feeling lonely. Melancholic respites like the Budd-like beauty “Center of Time” and the eerie title track are the sonic equivalent of those moments reading LeGuin’s book when you simply must close your eyes and let the brain unspool. Much like in The Left Hand of Darkness, though, the true revelations come via making contact. In Russom’s case, it’s with a pair of celebrated ancestors. “Discipline of Presence” is a tense set piece for a full brass ensemble courtesy of Peter Zummo, a collaborator of Arthur Russell (who himself knew a thing or two about queer new sound worlds), who Russom met while touring and recording Russell’s Instrumentals. Zummo’s brass heralds something unknowable but certain as it rises through Russom’s fog; it’s imperial yet sort of shapeless. But “Kemmer” is the album’s true heart. Named for the temporal-sexual moment when LeGuin’s beings transform, the track is graced by Cosey Fanni Tutti’s intonation of Russom’s provocative texts. Cosey is that rarest of creatures, an underappreciated icon. Finding her and Russom together in this world is a great comfort to ours, in which at least 331 trans and gender-diverse people were murdered around the world between last fall and September, as waters rise and land burns. We need these partnerships, these connective visions, so that we might see a future for ourselves.","The New York electronic musician fashions an evocative tribute to Ursula K. LeGuin’s 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness, conjuring the flux of gender and desire in shape-shifting sounds.

Get Bleak EP,Ducks Unlimited,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddbf86d05384d0009df3f79/1:1/w_160/getbleak.jpg,2019-12-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ducks-unlimited-get-bleak-ep/,Bobo Integral,"On their debut EP Get Bleak, Toronto jangle-pop band Ducks Unlimited write from a particular social stratum where everyone is in their 20s and nobody’s got their shit together. The very structure of life in this sphere is temporary. Folks searching for a change of scenery pack up their belongings and move apartments in much the way one might color their hair or obtain a regrettable tattoo. Everyone’s sleeping on a stiff, cheap IKEA mattress; nobody bothers to spring for a bed frame. None of your forks and knives match. You never see your friends anymore because they’ve moved to Hamilton or Perth. If all this sounds depressing, rest assured, it is. Thankfully, Get Bleak doesn’t wallow in the grind. Instead, Ducks Unlimited put their malaise beneath a microscope and tease out little things to laugh about. They never sound especially bleak, either. In less capable hands, the effort to bring the bouncy aesthetic of bands like the Field Mice and Blueboy into the 21st century could have been twee and derivative, but these songs manage to sound modern. “Get Bleak,” the EP’s opening track and its strongest song, is a tale of self-inflicted millennial isolation—“You’ll spend the afternoon deleting every number in your phone/Then you’ll spend the evening wondering why you’ll spend the night alone”—related in robust iambic pentameter. Ducks Unlimited sing in complete paragraphs with complex internal rhyme and assonance, elevating the petty struggles of ghosting and FOMO into poetic subjects. The strings in the mix are a compositional trick straight out of Blueboy’s “So Catch Him,” and evoke the same kind of quiet, lasting intimacy. “Gleaming Spires” nods to both the ’80s pop group and the high-rise condos that have colonized downtown Toronto in recent years. It’s a double-edged appeal to nostalgia, for the upbeat music of childhood and for a version of the city where the architecture wasn’t quite so hostile. Little wonder that life in the city becomes increasingly joyless as rents rise. Still, there remains something vital and irresistible between the skyscrapers. In “Annie Forever,” the singer stays the night at a girl’s place and feels “like the colors were off”; it’s because, she tells him, “there were no city lights.” The EP’s only love song can’t help but chuckle at its own boundless optimism: “Annie forever/It’s so stupid, girl.” Closer “Anhedonia” is the record’s lead single and its gloomiest moment. Mired in a young adulthood rife with resentment and dissociation, these songwriters aren’t searching for a way out as much as they’re looking for companionship. Like another Toronto band, PUP, Ducks Unlimited understand that dancing through misery is healthier than dancing around it. Their brand of lilting, throwback jangle-pop makes that seem like the easiest thing in the world to do.","The Toronto quartet writes lilting, throwback jangle-pop for the isolated and the underemployed.

Tattoo You,The Rolling Stones,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd85cc9d566b300089a2227/1:1/w_160/tattooyou.jpg,2019-12-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-rolling-stones-tattoo-you/,Rolling Stones,"The Cockroaches arrived in Toronto at the end of February 1977, in need of a quick break from being the Greatest Rock’n’Roll Band in the World. They’d been together for a decade and a half, their masterpiece album was five years behind them, and the three LPs they’d released since were not quite as spectacular. But they were richer and more famous than ever. Their most recent tour of North America, in 1975, had helped set the era’s standard for silliness and excess. There were six straight nights at Madison Square Garden, and five at the Forum; a flying trapeze for the singer, a confetti-breathing dragon, and an inflatable penis that stood as tall as two men when it wasn’t suffering from chronic mechanical dysfunction. The band was planning on releasing a live album culled from these concerts, but there wasn’t enough worthy material. This is where Toronto came in: two secret shows booked at a tiny venue, under a fake band name, for a crowd of 300 unsuspecting fans, with a recording truck parked outside to capture the sort of energy that only arises when those fans are smashed into close contact with their idols. These would be the band’s first club gigs since they rocketed to worldwide stardom shortly after forming in the early ’60s. After all that glitz and decadence, perhaps becoming the Cockroaches was a way to get back to being the Rolling Stones. It didn’t quite work. Typically for the era, the spectacle of the March 4th and 5th shows at Toronto’s El Mocambo tended to overshadow the music. Keith Richards, whose ever-deepening heroin addiction probably had something to do with the declining quality of the recent records, was arrested with about an ounce of it almost as soon as he arrived in Canada. Margaret Trudeau, the young and newly estranged wife of the Canadian prime minister, was seen cavorting backstage with the band, leading to slobbering speculative coverage from international tabloids. Love You Live, the resulting live album, wasn’t very good. But onstage, the Stones were finding their spark again, providing at least one glimpse at the unlikely musical resurgence they’d make over the next several years. The Mocambo shows included the live debut of a neon-lit R&B vigil called “Worried About You,” marking the first public performance of any song from 1981’s Tattoo You, the last great Rolling Stones album. Each of its two sides presents an aesthetically distinct vision of the Stones. The first, led by “Start Me Up,” finds them settling into their role as a legacy-oriented stadium rock band, grabbing the essence of the sleazy blues-based music they’d perfected a decade before and blowing it up to Jumbotron proportions. The second side, opening with “Worried About You,” briefly drops the world-conquering posture and allows them to appear as weary and middle-aged as they actually were at the time, with a stretch of bedraggled late-night soul music that’s both distinctly Stonesy and also not quite like anything else in their catalog—or anyone else’s. The production, in some liminal zone between ’70s analog warmth and ‘80s digital chill, only heightens the elegance of the performances. Tattoo You’s first side guaranteed the Rolling Stones’ sinecure as a hugely profitable enterprise for decades to come; the second side is their final gasp of brilliance before those profits became more important than anything else. By the early ’80s, some of the fissures of the previous years had closed for the Rolling Stones, but new ones were beginning to open. Richards was (mostly) off heroin, prompted in part by his narrow avoidance of a long potential jail sentence after the Toronto bust. His (relative) sobriety allowed him to take a renewed presence in the Stones’ music and business affairs around the time of their hit 1978 album Some Girls, and according to Richards, Jagger wasn’t happy about that. The camaraderie at the center of the band they’d started as teenagers in 1962 would sour considerably in the coming years, eventually prompting a handful of ill-advised solo projects and a seven-year hiatus from performing live. But for now, they had a massive tour booked for the end of 1981, with no new album to promote and hardly any new material to record. That Tattoo You exists at all is largely thanks to Chris Kimsey, an audio engineer who’d begun working with the band on 1971’s Sticky Fingers. “Tattoo You really came about because Mick and Keith were going through a period of not getting on,” Kimsey told an interviewer years later. “There was a need to have an album out, and I told everyone I could make an album from what I knew was still there.” Kimsey and Jagger spent three months searching the band’s archives for recordings of rejected and forgotten songs, jams, and sketches from previous sessions, going as far back as 1973’s Goats Head Soup and as recent as 1980’s Emotional Rescue. They took the compiled instrumental tracks to a warehouse on the edge of Paris and recorded vocals and a few additional overdubs there—a process that could have been finished in a few days, according to Kimsey, but instead took six weeks due to Jagger’s extensive social commitments in the city. Assembled for commercial reasons, from a backlog of unused material, at a time when the players involved were beginning to hate each other and the singer often couldn’t be bothered to come to work, Tattoo You didn’t have any reason to be particularly special. “Start Me Up” is the first track, and the last of the Rolling Stones’ signature songs. The thwack of its backbeat and strut of its opening riff are so familiar today that it’s difficult to fathom its earliest iteration as a reggae song, a product of the Stones’ extended flirtation with Jamaican music in the mid-’70s. They labored over “Start Me Up” unsuccessfully for years, trying something like 70 cumulative takes at multiple different studios before landing almost accidentally on the final version, playing it as a charged-up rocker on a lark for the first time ever. Richards hated it. According to Kimsey, the guitarist went as far as ordering him to wipe the recording from the tape. “So of course,” Kimsey remembers, “I didn’t wipe it.” The final version was recorded on the same day the Stones also nailed Some Girls opener “Miss You,” and there are echoes of that discofied hit in “Start Me Up”’s piston-pumping rhythmic drive. But “Start Me Up” belongs to the stadium, not the dancefloor. It’s the first Stones song that seems specifically designed to reach the highest bleachers and get tens of thousands of people clapping along in time. Fittingly, it became a sports arena staple. It frequently opens setlists on the band’s ultra-professional latter-day tours, where even the cheap seats are pretty expensive. It soundtracked the launch of Microsoft Windows 95, netting the Stones several millions of dollars in fees and providing the groove for a few of the world’s richest people to execute a few of the worst dance moves ever captured on video. If “Start Me Up” is a real-time document of a feral band of outsiders mutating into a bloodless big business, it’s also one of the most undeniable rock’n’roll songs ever recorded. Scrape away decades of overexposure and it’s still possible to hear the improvisatory rawness of those early demos in the finished version, especially in Bill Wyman’s bass playing, which still carries the faintest whiff of subterranean dub, and in the frenzy of yelps, grunts, and wheezes that constitutes Jagger’s vocal take. The tension between the off-the-cuff source recordings and their glossy final presentation is part of Tattoo You’s distinct charm. For an album with such muddled origins, it has a consistent sonic quality, with crisp echoes that are distinctly of its early-’80s era. Even that effect is stranger and more human than it seems, achieved not with any fancy technology, but by playing the tracks back in a studio bathroom and capturing the echoes from the tiles. “Slave,” rides a slow-motion blues-funk groove that sounds like it could go on forever, and nearly does: a bootleg of the raw take runs to 11 minutes, cut down to five for the album. Its chanted and spoken vocals surely had something to do with Jagger’s newfound love of disco as a frequent patron of Studio 54, and its swaggering rhythm is a reminder that Richards spent his time off from the Stones in this era jamming with reggae and funk heavy-hitters like Sly & Robbie and Zigaboo Modeliste. Though their paths were diverging, 20 years after they initially bonded over a mutual love of Chuck Berry and John Lee Hooker, both Mick and Keith were still devoted students of black music. Recorded at a time after guitarist Mick Taylor had left the Stones, but before Ronnie Wood formally replaced him, the initial “Slave” session featured marquee guests like Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, and frequent Stones collaborator Billy Preston on keys. Beck’s contributions were likely scrubbed from the final version, and no one seems to agree whether Townshend was playing guitar or just adding backing vocals. The unlikeliest contributor is Sonny Rollins, the master tenor saxophonist, whom Jagger invited to overdub solos on “Slave” and several other songs after seeing him play at a New York City jazz club in 1981. Rollins’ phrasing is carefree and conversational throughout Tattoo You, sounding perfectly pleased to be playing circles around these guys. His participation is a poignant image of human connection from the otherwise fractured process of adding isolated new takes to previously existing recordings. Jagger remembers: “I said, ‘Would you like me to stay out there in the studio?’ He said, ‘Yeah, you tell me where you want me to play and dance the part out. So I did that. And that's very important: communication in hand, dance, whatever. ” But the pairing was too brilliant to last. Rollins never collaborated with the Stones again, leaving drummer and jazz aficionado Charlie Watts lamenting that he was on a record backing up one of his heroes without ever having actually played with him. On Tattoo You’s flickeringly transcendent second side, the Stones sometimes sound like they’re shooting for Al Green or Prince (who opened a couple of gigs on the subsequent tour and got booed offstage at least once), and always like they’re a little too sad, loaded, and British to pull it off. Blues and country are here too, but only as shadows and reflections. The guitars are airy and transparent; the rhythm section softly works the pocket; Jagger whispers and convulses, using plenty of falsetto. It’s like the disarrayed intimacy of the classic Some Girls ballad “Beast of Burden” has been expanded into a five-song suite; only now, the burden has become much too heavy to bear. In bootlegs from the Cockroaches’ Toronto ’77 shows, “Worried About You” is loose and jammy, nearly formless, stretching out to about eight minutes, with Mick Jagger audibly cueing the band through a sparse set of changes. In the studio version the public heard four years later, the changes were essentially the same, but the compositional arc had become clearer, and the bleary 5 a.m. atmosphere more vivid: Jagger channeling the spirit of past hedonism while reckoning with its effects in the present; tension building through ticking hi-hats and glowing electric piano toward a chorus that’s over almost as soon as it begins. “I’m worried, and I just can’t seem to find my way,” Jagger admits as the band sighs back into the verse behind him. That very moment captures the feeling of a halcyon period reaching its close. The languor reaches a peak with “Heaven,” one of two entirely new compositions on Tattoo You, recorded by a skeleton crew version of the band—just Jagger, Watts, possibly Wyman, and Kimsey helping out—on a late night in Paris during the particularly cold winter of 1980. Kimsey recalls being able to see Jagger’s breath as they worked. The music is likewise swirling and vaporous, barely even there, far more psychedelic in its way than anything recorded during the band’s brief acid rock period of the late ’60s, and at least as erotic as any of their more openly hip-thrusting material. Jagger mumbles half-intelligibly, as if entranced, in the throes of sexual or religious ecstasy or both. Kimsey has been quoted as saying he “played alleged piano” on “Heaven,” which may be the result of a journalist’s bad transcription—there is some electric piano audible at the edges—but the odd phrasing is nonetheless appropriate for the rare Stones song that works by suggestion rather than demonstration, a half-formed memory or fantasy of events that may never have transpired at all. Tattoo You closes with “Waiting on a Friend,” an ode to platonic companionship that’s among the most purely sweet songs the Rolling Stones ever wrote. From today’s vantage, it looks like one final expression of boyhood love between Jagger and Richards before the years of business-driven bitterness that would follow. As it fades into the mist with some Jagger falsetto and a beautiful sax solo from Rollins, it’s possible to close your eyes and imagine the Rolling Stones chose to wrap it up here, allowing the entire ’60s rock era to draw gracefully and finally to a close. But they didn’t. After Tattoo You, there were bigger and more remunerative tours and public spats between Mick and Keith about music and money and penis size. Many albums took the backward-looking approach of Tattoo You as a figurative starting point, but without any of the sweat or ingenuity. “It’s almost as if Mick was aspiring to be Mick Jagger, chasing his own phantom,” Richards wrote scathingly in his 2010 memoir Life about his old friend during the post-Tattoo You ’80s. If you were feeling equally uncharitable, you could say the same about the band as a whole. Shortly after the album’s release, a Rolling Stone interviewer expressed to Keith that he hoped the band would continue to exist and create music for another 20 years. “So do I, because nobody else has done it, you know?” Richards answered. “It’s kind of interesting to find out how rock & roll can grow up.” According to Billboard, the Stones’ 2019 “No Filter” tour grossed $415.6 million, placing it high on the list of the most profitable tours of all time. Their latest album, 2016’s Blue and Lonesome, is a collection of classic blues songs of the sort the Stones began their career by covering, another trip into the past. And despite everything, on a good night, it’s still possible to catch the spark and recognize the Rolling Stones are still the Greatest Rock’n’Roll Band in the World. It’s no wonder they once chose to rename themselves after a famously persistent prehistoric household pest for a few shows, intent on getting back to basics and recapturing the old glory. Cockroaches can live through anything.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Queen & Slim: The Soundtrack,Various Artists,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd82f696133160008c64498/1:1/w_160/queenslim.jpg,2019-11-30 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-queen-and-slim-the-soundtrack/,Motown,"Melina Matsoukas, the director for Beyoncé’s incendiary “Formation” video, makes her feature film debut with the romantic thriller Queen & Slim, starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. After meeting up for a first date, the titular couple are pulled over for a traffic stop, the encounter escalates, and Slim takes the officer’s gun and shoots him in self-defense. Branded as cop killers, the couple go on the lam. When video of the shooting goes viral, the fugitives become symbols of both terror and justice among a polarized American public, and along the way their unlikely romance blooms. This is complex emotional territory, and the film’s music does its best to keep pace. In addition to the score, provided by Devonté Hynes (aka Blood Orange), the movie has an original soundtrack, courtesy of Motown Records, bringing artists from across its storied roster in attempts to tie the many themes of the movie together. Everyone seems to have a pretty good idea what they’re getting into, and they all handle it differently. Megan Thee Stallion is proudly complicit on “Ride or Die”; Syd, ever the master of the moody come-on, is raring to go on “Getting Late.” But the 6lack and Mereba-featuring alt-R&B slow-burner “Yo Love” takes Vince Staples way out of his comfort zone, to awkward effect. There are also redundancies and placeholders: Bilal gets help from Raphael Saadiq remixing his 2000 jam “Soul Sista,” a song that already soundtracked a classic black romantic drama, and the psychedelic R&B of Choker’s “Collide” is just a reminder how much better Miguel would be, who is not only more talented but better suited for the task. The soundtrack’s best songs focus on how having a partner-in-crime would bring comfort in trying times. On “Catch the Sun,” a tender Lil Baby pretty convincingly explains why he and his co-conspirator are better together. Ms. Lauryn Hill is similarly focused on the connection the journey fosters on “Guarding the Gates.” Burna Boy’s upbeat “My Money, My Baby” makes the order of its priorities clear. The outlier is the closer, literally called “Runnin’ Away,” which samples the Pharcyde’s “Runnin’”; Blood Orange makes the iconic hook the center of a noir epic. The music of a movie like this will always have a social justice bent, and it is clumsily handled. “I’m going out with a bang, I’m tellin’ you what it is/If I get racial profiled, why live?” Lil Baby sings. On the title track, members of Coast Contra address the elephant in the room as hamfistedly as possible. “It’s gun violence, your son dyin’ for nothin’/And your daughters be suckin’ dick ‘fore they even get they first kiss,” Taj Austin raps, putting systemic violence on par with sexually active teens, while Rio Los only adds the most basic cliches. “Yo Love” engages vaguely with the source material, but Vince Staples, who has plenty of experience taking bad cops to task, would’ve been better served here playing a similar role. This soundtrack is desperately missing a song as fed-up as Killer Mike’s “Don’t Die.” Ultimately, the topic of militant policing feels glossed over. The traffic stop is the jumping-off point—for Queen and Slim’s romance, for their lives as outlaws, and for their representation as avatars for black grief and retribution. It is the axis upon which the entire movie turns, and the soundtrack’s inability to unpack that is anticlimactic.

Merry Christmas: Deluxe Anniversary Edition,Mariah Carey,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddbf1586133160008c6461a/1:1/w_160/mariahdeluxe.jpg,2019-11-29 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mariah-carey-merry-christmas-deluxe-anniversary-edition/,Sony Legacy,"Living by the adage, “Go where you’re celebrated, not tolerated,” Mariah Carey has established a veritable empire around Christmastime. There are the annual holiday concerts, the yuletide-themed children’s book, the animated movie featuring her CGI likeness, the Hallmark movie she directed, and enough merch to fill a sleigh. The day after Halloween this year, she posted a video on Instagram to usher in the commencement of the Christmas season. There’s something archetypical about her performed love of Christmas. Like horse girls, Carey’s identity has absorbed her interest. She is the epitomized Christmas girl. And to think it all nearly didn’t happen. Carey said she initially balked when her future ex-husband/label boss Tommy Mottola presented her the idea of recording the Christmas album on which she’d eventually build her merry brand. Just a few years into her major-label career, it was too early, she thought, for such a legacy-artist flex. Once convinced, she threw herself into the process. In a method approach to recording, she kept a tree up for the majority of 1994 as she rifled through the Christmas canon, devising new arrangements for old classics, mashing-up secular with spiritual (a pop-house riff on “Joy to the World” was given a Three Dog Night injection), and writing three new songs alongside her longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff. The result, 1994’s Merry Christmas, sounds as timeless as possible for music passed through the consciously innocuous filters of mid-’90s adult pop. Though constructed with a utilitarian hand to stand the test of time across demographics, Carey said the album gave her opportunity to dabble in areas her other albums hadn’t; namely, gospel and overt retroism. At the time, her label saw her as a franchise and clipped her wings leading up to 1997’s Butterfly. That a Christmas album was Carey’s laboratory for experimentation says everything about the intensity of her struggle for creative control early in her career. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Merry Christmas, Carey has released a two-disc Deluxe Anniversary Edition. The original album returns untouched, anchored by her perennial smash “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which is, at this point, a total cultural anomaly, a phenomenon unto itself, a singular sensation, if you will. It might be the happiest song about heartache. The joy of this indefatigable song casts Christmas both as an exacerbation of preexisting melancholy and a salve—Carey’s yearning, belting narrator is fine by virtue of her yuletide surroundings. Snow makes a fine cushion. The song is a multivalent blur of sensibilities, yet simple enough for a child to understand, like Disney at its most optimal. Multiple in-depth dissections of its inherent appeal have yet to explain it adequately or sap it of its magic. It is the apotheosis of the nearly diabolical populist ambitions of Carey’s early work. No mere chestnut of recurrent radio, it re-becomes a smash hit year after year, as it’s propelled into the upper echelons of the Billboard Hot 100 alongside contemporary songs. (Last year, it hit a new peak: No. 3.) It become the definitive Wall of Sound carol—Carey cited the legendary producer Phil Spector’s influence in the initial press cycle for Merry Christmas (she generally referenced the Ronettes), though her riff is decidedly cleaner with a dynamic range that gives its parts even more room as they bounce off the song’s walls. Carey’s version must be just what the style sounds like to recent generations of listeners. An oft-cited study claims that when you remember something repeatedly, you don’t actually remember the event, per se, but your last memory of it. Here’s the musical equivalent, a flagrant copy that redefined the aesthetic of its source material. Further establishing this dominion are covers of Darlene Love’s “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” and “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.” And then there were the nonsecular songs. Unlike her predecessor Whitney Houston, Carey did not come up through singing in the black church, but her debt to its musical traditions had never been more explicit than on Merry Christmas. For the gospel-tinged songs like “Silent Night,” “O Holy Night,” and “Jesus Oh What a Wonderful Child,” Carey showed up touting her signature melismatic flair and emotional acrobatics. Sure, she’d hit a sharp note so gleaming as to be objectively holy and she might really take it to church in a one-off praise break, but vocally, Merry Christmas was Carey doing her thing. The major musical shift occurred in subject matter and backdrop—organs, bouncy pianos, and choirs (Carey’s handful of backup singers was itself a small choir that had the power of a midsize one). Like the greatest snapshot Sears ever produced, the album is a holiday portrait of Carey’s voice in its prime. She took words that had one syllable and gave them five. She hit the ground enraptured, attacking first verses with gusto, and then swung back around, aiming at the melody like she was attempting to cut off its head at an angle. She made it look easy, but at the same time, hard. The manner in which her pipes seized around a note, as if to cradle it as delicately as possible, telegraphed effort. Even back then, Carey was singing as if her career depended on each and every phrase coming out of her mouth. Her aptitude and technique may have shifted over the years, but that fraught delivery stayed consistent, disc two of the Deluxe Anniversary Edition contests. Spread across the bonus disc are yuletide odds and ends Carey has recorded since the original release of Merry Christmas. Like a stocking filled by an overenthusiastic parent, it’s teeming with stuff you don’t really need. There’s a mini-concert Carey performed at New York’s Cathedral of St. John the Divine a few weeks after the release of Merry Christmas, back when she aimed to recreate verbatim live the vocals on her albums. On top of a muddy sound mix, there’s simply not enough variation to make the live cuts essential. Most of the remixes are merely novel with the exception of David Morales’ transcendent “Celebration Mix” of “Joy to the World,” released the same year as Merry Christmas. It’s a titanic slice of stomping gospel house somewhere between a track and a song that finds early Carey at her loosest. It’s a true gift, this one. The only strictly new thing here is the “Sugar Plum Fairy Introlude,” 45 eccentric seconds in which Carey vocalizes along to “The Nutcracker Suite” selection mostly using her whistle register. It sounds like Christmas getting kicked in the shins. There are a handful of post-Merry Christmas originals, too—three songs from her 2010 follow-up Merry Christmas II You and some soundtrack cuts. Their inclusion telegraphs some attempt to collect all of the Christmas songs Carey wrote in one place, but there are things missing, like another Merry Christmas II You cut (“One Child”) as well as “Where Are You Christmas,” which Faith Hill recorded for the 2000 live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The affectation of completism is, in fact, half-assed. Still, taken as a (near) whole, the thesis spread out over these 29 tracks is simple: Mariah Carey loves Christmas very much indeed. One repeating theme in her original compositions is the suggestion that Christmas is a group project largely defined by a collective attitude. Christmastime is in the air again, everyone is singing, the whole world is rejoicing, we gon’ help the world become a better place, every year forever and ever, amen. While Carey’s faith is explicit in much of her music, she remains fixated on the granular, secular aspects of Christmas: twinkling lights, mistletoe, the exchange of gifts. Given the amount of space these totems occupy in our world (arguably more than the religious ones), it’s not illogical that an icon would rise up as a sort of cultural attaché, rounding out a holiday trinity. Santa Claus, Jesus Christ, and Mariah Carey: Father Christmas, the son of God, and the merry spirit.","Mariah Carey, the cultural attaché of Christmas, offers a reissue of her 1994 album, which sounds as timeless as possible for music passed through the innocuous filters of mid-’90s adult pop.

Ballet Slippers,Animal Collective,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddbef917e6e560008796f22/1:1/w_160/animalcollective.jpg,2019-11-28 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/animal-collective-ballet-slippers/,Domino,"A decade since Merriweather Post Pavilion, the qualities that once made Animal Collective singular—their gleeful nitrous-oxide harmonies, their cascading drums, their interlocking hooks—are as familiar as Instagram filters. The success of “Peacebone” and “My Girls” has overshadowed their unruly previous decade to the point where it can be hard to remember just how wild and transgressive Animal Collective were for so long. Those splendid eccentricities surface again on Ballet Slippers, a 12-song live mix culled from four shows a decade ago and sequenced into a simulacrum of a single concert. They begin with the hiccuping samples and strangled static of Merriweather opener “In the Flowers” and kill the sequences 90 minutes later after the tessellated jumble of Merriweather closer “Brother Sport,” wishing the crowd well. Between these bookends, things get weird, often subtly so. A tambourine and acoustic guitar meet so high in the mix of “Who Could Win a Rabbit” that it sounds like the microphones are being hit by snow chains. A noise collage erupting inside “Bleed” suggests a basement show circa 2003. And “Daily Routine” turns into a slow-motion tug of war between a fetching hook and surrounding chaos. Throughout, Animal Collective split the difference between fidelity to the songs on Merriweather and nuanced improvisation. A Las Vegas crowd squeals as the kaleidoscopic sequences of “My Girls” rise from primordial goo, a pointed reminder of just how alien but magnetic that inescapable song felt in 2009. They give the hit its space, pushing the interweaving harmonies high above the drums to emphasize the basic humanity of Panda Bear’s early-Obama-years request—just to be a good person with a safe place to raise a family. Freed from studio safeguards, “Lion in a Coma” feels particularly frantic and urgent. Avey Tare’s vocals tunnel through cramped electronics, emphasizing the song’s existential agoraphobia. At the other extreme, Animal Collective treat “Banshee Beat” like its own world, with an atmosphere of droning guitars that shift like summer winds and synthesizers that slip like sunlight through storm clouds. A month or so after the recordings that shape Ballet Slippers, Animal Collective made history by licensing the first-ever Grateful Dead sample. If that’s always felt like lip service, their extended sweep between “Lablakely Dress” and “Fireworks” provide the bona fides. The skipping drums, the shaky vocals, the woozy electronics: Over 20 minutes, a dozen tiny parts coalesce into a hero’s journey from one of the band’s early abstractions to one of their most radiant anthems. And if the idea of a heroic Animal Collective guitar solo feels absurd, it arrives halfway in, a circuit of trebly notes transmuted into ecstasy by sheer repetition. Despite such extraordinary highs, Ballet Slippers is not essential. If you’re not a zealot, chances are that these recordings—as with most live records, a tad distant and dependent on the power of suggestion—won’t convert you. And if you are already on board, Animal Collective’s ability to jam will come as no surprise; these takes will, instead, transport you to a past place and time, previously accessible through bootlegs or YouTube or your memory. But the best of this set serves as an essential reminder of how, on Merriweather Post Pavilion, Animal Collective successfully folded a decade of experimentation into 11 engrossing pop songs that sounded like little else—and then, on the road, let it spill back out for big crowds looking to party to “My Girls.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","Pieced together from four Merriweather Post Pavilion-era sets, this live album reinforces the weirdness of the band’s pop heyday.

Hidden History of the Human Race,Blood Incantation,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd7071e205291000802a50a/1:1/w_160/hiddenhistory.jpg,2019-11-27 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blood-incantation-hidden-history-of-the-human-race/,Dark Descent,"Death metal glories in ugliness—rhythm guitars the texture of churned shit, leads like pig squeals, vocals like reverse peristalsis. But Blood Incantation do beautiful things with that ugliness. Their ugliness moves; within 40 minutes on their second album Hidden History of the Human Race, the Denver quartet brings death metal to exalted places, places it hardly ever goes, without ever losing the essential, foul tang of the sound. It helps that they are incredible players, virtuosic in the most basic sense. In just the first few minutes of the opening epic “Slave Species of the Gods,” guitarists Paul Riedl and Morris Kolontyrsky evoke the cold steel-shavings scrape of Slayer’s Kerry King and the hair-flip theatrics of Metallica’s Kirk Hammett. But their virtuosity comes from their vocabulary, as well: They just seem to think differently than their peers. Great riffs are less the products of finger muscles than the peculiarity of a mind, and there is no question that they are singular players. You can hear this relative oddness everywhere. They are more fond of harmonized guitars than most death metal bands, which give their suite-length songs uncommon melodic movement and emotional resonance. Ambient synthesizers play walk-on roles at several surprising moments, and clean-toned psychedelic guitar leads often pick up where those synthesizers left off, carrying melodic ideas forward. Even when drummer Isaac Faulk is drilling the music into the earth with blast beats, there is something in the arrangement arcing upward. Another delicate touch comes from Jeff Barrett's fretless bass, an instrument known for rounded tones and freakishly high technical demands; in rock-music circles, it is most associated with louche pop records likee Roxy Music’s Avalon. In “The Giza Power Plant,” Barrett plays high up the neck, shaping long lines and sounding almost like a bassoon behind the din. Death metal has a long history with juvenile winner-takes-all nihilism—it is the home of Cannibal Corpse, Goatwhore, Deicide. But in the last several years there have been a number of American bands that express some genuine spiritual stirrings—the Toronto outfit Tomb Mold and the Philly band Horrendous, to take two other examples. Blood Incantation take that transformational energy the furthest. Yes, the song titles are a pretty big hat tip in that direction—the album concludes with an 18-minute piece called “Awakening from the Dream of Existence to the Multidimensional Nature of Our Reality (Mirror of the Soul)”—but you feel it shot through the music as well. The leads glow through the murk; on “The Giza Power Plant,” they swarm atop the traditional down-tuned chugging rhythm guitars like phosphorescence in a swamp. But the music feels meditative, despite all its frenetic motion; they recorded the entire thing—every interlocking part and lightspeed tempo switch—analog, which means that you are hearing a band breathing as an organism, a group of people accomplishing something remarkable when you play it. The euphoric “Inner Paths (To Outer Space),” was improvised “on psychedelics over a period of several months,” according to the band, and it evolves entirely in unexpected leaps, dissolving into synthesizer washes and backmasked guitars and then plunging ahead, again, stirring up the primordial ooze. At every point, you hear a band going somewhere new, hurtling towards a forever-receding spot in the consciousness.

The Legendary Riverside Albums,Chet Baker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd40a10522b310008b5ec5e/1:1/w_160/chet.jpg,2019-11-27 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chet-baker-the-legendary-riverside-albums/,Craft,"Chet Baker had two careers. Through the mid-1950s, he was one of the biggest stars in jazz, a strikingly beautiful man who played trumpet and also sang in a strange and androgynous voice that seemed too fragile for this world. He won both critics’ and readers’ polls in DownBeat magazine, and his recordings, particularly his early work with baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan, were essential documents of West Coast jazz. But in the years following Baker’s descent into heroin addiction, he became a cult artist, a figure whose musical output was often eclipsed by the tragic narrative of his life. His gaunt and caved-in face told the story of a promising young talent gone to seed. In the late ’50s, after his first run of legal problems connected to his accelerating drug use, Baker spent a year cutting albums for the Riverside label. It was a transitional period, a moment when Baker hovered between one career and the next. He still sounds young—he would turn 30 just after recording these LPs—and he’s surrounded by top-shelf supporting musicians, the kinds of bands that would be difficult for Baker to assemble once he became an industry pariah. Baker began his year on Riverside with It Could Happen to You, a vocal album aimed at a pop-leaning audience. His singing—unsteady in pitch, frail and delicate, with a disorienting mix of sexiness and naiveté—has always been an acquired taste, but there’s a context for it now that didn’t exist then. Its damaged innocence and dreamy loveliness carry a hint of irony that, 60 years on, brings to mind sounds we might hear in the unlit corners in David Lynch’s universe. You can hear that quality all over It Could Happen to You—take “My Heart Stood Still,” where Baker sings at the higher end of his natural range for an effect both chill-inducing and slightly creepy. Outtakes and Alternates is heavy on vocal numbers from the It Can Happen to You sessions. Some songs are even more haunting (“While My Lady Sleeps” is downright gothic, with Baker close to the microphone and singing way behind the beat), while others were shelved for a reason (he sounds especially high on this alternate take of “Everything Happens to Me” and struggles to articulate some words). If you can tune into Baker’s unsteady frequency, the voice showcased here is like nothing in jazz. Baker was obsessed with Miles Davis’ cerebral Birth of the Cool and one can trace a significant portion of his trumpet style to those sessions. Like Davis, Baker mostly avoided the extremes of his horn’s range and focused on its middle, the frequency band where his melody lines could evoke a human voice. He had a natural ear for phrasing, and would alter the melodies of familiar tunes to wring a maximum amount of feeling from a minimum number of notes. Chet Baker in New York pairs Baker with two veterans of Davis’ rhythm section, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones, along with Al Haig (who played with Charlie Parker) and saxophonist Johnny Griffin. Continuing the homage, the group even tackles Davis’ tune “Solar.” Baker was strung out and in rough shape around the time In New York was cut, and the idea, according to Riverside label owner Orrin Keepnews (who also produced the session), was to “cover him over cosmetically with the best supporting cast, try to bury him.” To an extent, the approach worked. “Polka Dots and Moonbeams” is lush and romantic—a little vacant, maybe, but easy to get lost in—while “Hotel 49” is a satisfying 10-minute blues on which Griffin shines. Much better is Chet, a set of pure floating atmosphere cut directly after In New York. Most of the tunes were recorded with pianist Bill Evans, who was at a peak moment of his career, and his style fit perfectly with Baker’s. “It Never Entered My Mind” is a poignant showcase for Baker’s horn, his judicious use of vibrato elevating the sadness as the rest of the ensemble falls in the mix to allow his phrases to linger. On some tunes Baker plays eloquently with other soloists: A duet with baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams on “’Tis Autumn” allows their horns to entwine as if in an embrace. On “Alone Together,” Evans improvises a haunting opening refrain that sounds like a trial run for “Blue in Green,” the piece he would record with Davis on Kind of Blue a few months later. Mature and beautiful, with a great selection of songs rendered in slow motion, Chet is one of Baker’s best albums. Plays the Best of Lerner & Loewe, another instrumental LP cut later in 1959, finds Baker paying homage to the composers of My Fair Lady. It’s the weakest of these records, though it has its charms. Ballad-heavy and recorded with heavier reverb, there’s something almost crass about it, a sickly glamour that sounds good in the right mood. Baker completed it after serving several months at Rikers Island, and the rest of the 1960s were disastrous for him: an endless series of busts and jail time, mostly in Europe, that led to his expulsion from several countries. In 1966, he was injured in an assault likely related to a drug deal; he lost some teeth, impairing his ability to play, and his music career ground to a halt. Eventually he returned, first to make novelty records that ought to count as some of the worst music ever made—try “Sugar, Sugar,” from Blood, Chet and Tears—and then for the decades-long cult period, in which he recorded and gigged constantly and once in a while made something great. The Riverside period, flawed but occasionally brilliant, is the last, missed exit before he got on that road.

Chixtape 5,Tory Lanez,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd6ff046133160008c642f0/1:1/w_160/torylanez.png,2019-11-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tory-lanez-chixtape-5/,Mad LoveInterscope,"The latest installment in Tory Lanez’s Chixtape series is another attempt to recreate the recent past. This time, the rapper/singer remakes early-’00s R&B hits alongside their original creators. As an anthropological exercise, it’s kind of fascinating. As music, it strains to hold your attention, pulling you back to old hits without doing much besides reminding you they existed. Lanez tries to impose a narrative, using skits as exposition. The story offers a long-winded account of Lanez cheating on a woman who then pays a second woman to set Lanez up by seducing and then leaving him (why anyone would do this is unclear); the album somehow ends with Lanez claiming to be the victim, guilt-tripping the woman who was paid. None of this matters, except as an excuse to cram in more early-’00s references (“You know WASSUP!”, Lanez belches to his friend at one point, referencing the old Budweiser ad campaign.) At over an hour long, the album suffers from sag and bloat. Each song loses momentum after the first minute, despite the endless parade of guest stars – Lil Wayne, Ludacris, Mario — popping by. Still, there are moments where the experiment almost works: “Jerry Sprunger,” a song constructed around T-Pain’s “I’m Sprung” featuring T-Pain himself, is a silky AutoTuned banger. “Beauty in the Benz,” a remix of Snoop Dogg and Pharrell’s “Beautiful,” unfolds around a mediocre Snoop verse, with enough twinkles in the production to make you bob your head reflexively. The rare songs that don’t feature a prominent sample fit into the world Lanez has created: featureless, water-soluble R&B. Songs like “Broken Promises” are pretty enough on the surface to distract from the lyrics. “The Fargo Splash” snatches the “Oh!” refrain from Ludacris’s “Splash Waterfalls” and a few lines from the song, but it’s hampered by Lanez’s clumsy lyrics: “McDonald’s chicken fries, thick as thighs.” Ludacris one-ups him with the even-worse “Left the pussy on the deathbed/ Been killing the game since I was breastfed.” This approach to women extends to the guests. Ashanti, who appears on the album cover, sounds stunning on the remake of “Foolish,” but Tory doesn’t give her the space to shine, cutting her off with his warbling. (It also bears noting that Chris Brown is on this album, chirping along to a new version of his song, “Take You Down.”)  Ultimately, despite the concept behind the album, or how much effort Lanez clearly went into creating it, it's hard to enjoy the music when the results are this puerile. The only reason the Chixtape series exists is to create decent songs out of once-great ones, and all of the prominent samples in the world can’t change that.

Supernatural,Floorplan,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd7028f05384d0009df3d8e/1:1/w_160/floorplan.jpg,2019-11-27 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/floorplan-supernatural/,Aus,"Robert Hood began his career with Underground Resistance, a Detroit collective known for its bold, anti-corporate vision of techno as a musical form by and for the black youth of a city left behind by a racist nation. Hood left Underground Resistance in 1992; today he lives in Alabama and works as an ordained minister when he is not touring or recording. But that core belief in techno’s revelatory potential resonates throughout his catalog. Hood pioneered minimal techno with early releases like 1994’s Minimal Nation, but his work as Floorplan sings with a joyous maximalism. He has made records under the alias since 1996, but over the past decade, it has become his main gig. Supernatural is his third album under the alias since 2013, and his second as a duo alongside his daughter Lyric; it is also the fullest expression to date of the spiritual dimension of his music. It is clear that his activities in the DJ booth and the pulpit share the same goal: the search beyond the self. The core of Hood’s music is still techno: Opening tracks “There Was a Time” and “Dance Floor” are built on thunderous beats. As the album continues, the surface becomes more soulful; “Oasis” and “Brothers + Sisters” are rife with orchestral disco swells and reverberating piano riffs. The Floorplan sound is much warmer than Hood’s solo work, a shade more house than techno, and Supernatural contains the duo’s most enthusiastic work yet. “Song Like This” feels like genuine gospel music, not just a dance remix—a veritable tabernacle choir of joyous voices, organ licks, and cymbals crashing. For the less spiritually inclined, the album still functions as a full-bodied dance workout. Its most intense tracks, like “I Try,” are more jock jam than Joubert Singers, complete with literal whistles. The Hoods wind the record down with a more contemplative cut, “Generations From Now,” turning the album’s sights away from heaven and back onto the bodies of the true believers left in the last moments of early-morning light. Previous Floorplan tracks like “We Magnify His Name” chopped up recordings of sermons and choirs, as does this album. But on Supernatural the duo goes beyond samples and delivers a full-fledged vocal gospel number: an uptempo techno take on the traditional hymn  “His Eye Is on the Sparrow,” featuring Carol Otis. Covered by everyone from Marvin Gaye to Jessica Simpson, this Sunday-morning standard is a perfect expression of the ecstasy Floorplan find in dance: “Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come?” sings Otis over pounding organ stabs and flashing open hi-hats. “I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free.” Kanye West’s recent embrace of gospel music has been linked to his mystifying rightward turn; Jesus Is King is laced with elements of Joel Osteen’s prosperity theology, and the admiration is apparently mutual. By comparison, the humility and sincerity of the Hoods’ message makes Kanye look like The Righteous Gemstones’ Uncle Baby Billy, a charlatan shilling shopping-mall snake oil. There’s room in the pews for everyone in the church of techno. Supernatural captures a moment of epiphany that isn’t confined to Sunday service: that holy time when the ravers go home and the churchgoers come out, side by side like lion and lamb, reveling in the glow of worship, doing the same dance for different gods.

A Good Time,Davido,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ddc72886133160008c6465f/1:1/w_160/600x600bb.jpg,2019-11-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/davido-a-good-time/,Davido Worldwide EntertainmentSonyRCA,"For the last several years, Davido has been reshaping the sound of Nigerian pop. As a prolific hitmaker and one of Africa’s biggest stars, he has pivoted away from global ambitions toward revamping the traditional sounds of his homeland. He released his debut album, Omo Baba Olowo, seven years ago and hasn’t released another until now. It feels like the stars aligned for it: Drake is still courting the sound, Burna Boy has a Grammy nom, UMG is moving into the region, and the music is crashing into our shores. A Good Time is a nearly gapless immersion into his potent, wavy signature sound. Nigerian pop music—with its endorsement-based revenue structure and rejection of collaborative songwriting—isn’t really conducive to ideas like cohesion. Davido has championed the use of songwriters, and has as much of a unified vision for his music as any of his peers, but this is the first time he’s been able to translate that into anything resembling a complete album. “Everything I do is a lifestyle,” he sings on the intro. Over the next hour, that lifestyle can only be defined as lush and splendid. Nigerian pop is a singles-focused genre with a hits-first infrastructure. From the Mo’ Hits era (2004-2012) led by D’banj and Don Jazzy to the Mavin Records stronghold established by Jazzy in its wake, labels have prioritized A-sides and roster-boosting compilations like 2007’s genre-defining Curriculum Vitae. Most of the digital revenue from Nigeria’s growing music industry comes from caller ringback tones (RBTs); streaming is on the rise but very slowly. (Most profits still go toward the country’s booming piracy market.) Making albums under these conditions is largely a secondary concern, if not a luxury. Davido, coming off a career-redefining singles run in 2017, knows a thing or two about luxury, and he has taken on the challenge. While his album isn’t thematic or self-contained, it feels comprehensive. Knowing the stakes, Davido curates a buoyant, unsinkable record, one of the genre’s finest ever. His debut, Omo Baba Olowo—meaning “rich man’s son”—was a failure of imagination and ambition. Not only was it steeped in an already established Mo’ Hits sound but it was unsure about who it wanted Davido to be: the flexer boy-king or the down-on-his-luck hustler who worked his way into the music industry on his own terms. He was standing on his daddy’s money one minute then citing how no one loved him when he was broke the next, like Lagos’ own Mike Jones. He’s grown as an artist since and has had a lot of time to think about those mistakes, including the misadventure of his last EP, which he recently called “shit.” On A Good Time, he provides not just an integrated sound all his own but a clear vision for its future. Davido’s overall theme here is a rich playboy who is embracing commitment. The songs are feel-good serenades, many with groovy dembow rhythms slowed to a gentle sashaying pace, and at least one dedicated directly to his fiancé Chioma Rowland (“Assurance”). “Fall” showers a lover with adoration and gifts as an apology. The writing is largely that of a smitten mogul, but occasionally he lets his guard down. “I just want to make history without my people back home missing me,” he sings on the Summer Walker duet “D & G,” exposing some anxiety beneath his often impenetrable pop star veneer. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Davido has embraced the “Afrobeats” label in part because he and his team of producers have played such a big role in defining it. While artists like D’Banj and duo P-Square were pioneers of the streaking, synthy music that the genre was built upon, Davido (alongside rival WizKid) spearheaded what it has become: melodically subtler, gentler in tone, programmed drums evoking conventional and proven African rhythms. A Good Time sounds like an artist removing the bugs that prevent his songs from running at maximum efficiency. The R&B textures smooth down the sounds of Igbo highlife; the muted yet technicolor synth and guitar tones of songs like “1 Milli” and “Check AM” are perfectly devised for Davido’s sumptuous harmonies. As if seeking justice for the lost Popcaan version of Drake’s “Controlla,” Davido’s “Risky” uses similar skittering drums to a colorful dancehall hybrid with the Jamaican deejay in tow. At nearly every turn, Davido is upgrading. Davido is one of the most charismatic performers in Afropop, but A Good Time’s polished and exquisite simplicity is owed to a crack team of Nigerian producers: Shizzi, Kiddominant, Speroach Beatz, and Tekno, in particular. Davido’s vocals drift sweetly just above the drums on “Green Light Riddim.” “If,” one of his vibrant 2017 hits, finds a home here among similarly sunlit productions. Over the layered rhythms of “Disturbance,” he’s beaming. Instead of trying to push the sound to its edge, it’s like he’s seeking a unified theory of the nebulous “Afrobeats” term. As the already synthesized sound of Nigerian pop begins to transform into scenes and subgenres like alté and Fuji pop, and the future stars are mixing SoundCloud rap in with their more orthodox Naija pop, or bringing throwback Ja Rule duets into the sun, Davido is content to fine-tune his pristine songcraft. His songs aren’t experimenting with the form the way Rema’s, Odunsi’s, or wurLD’s are; he’s more concerned with making the most optimized Afropop possible. This extends to his streamlined album on the whole, which is a new benchmark for Afropop LPs. If Burna Boy is bringing the sounds of the diaspora back to the motherland, Davido is erecting a monument to his own status as a hometown hero.","On his second album, the Nigerian pop artist provides not just an integrated sound all his own but a clear vision for its future. It is a buoyant, unsinkable record, one of the genre’s finest ever.

Love Beyond the Intersect,Space Dimension Controller,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd5b9c07e6e560008796c5e/1:1/w_160/lovebeyond.jpg,2019-11-26 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/space-dimension-controller-love-beyond-the-intersect/,R&S,"Jack Hamill has spent the past decade building out his Space Dimension Controller project as though it were a Hollywood blockbuster franchise. The music, a mixture of Detroit-inspired techno, electro-funk, and atmospheric electronica, conveys a cinematic sensibility that’s reflected in his titles (earlier albums The Pathway to Tiraquon6 and Welcome to Mikrosector-50 were both bookended by tracks called “Feature Presentation” and “Closing Titles”) and even his character development. Mr. 8040, the Belfast producer’s alter ego, is a recurring figure: a space-journeying, time-traveling narrator with the unfortunate tendency to slip into the 20th century’s most hackneyed rap cadences. (Consider this, from Welcome to Mikrosector-50: “I’m the Space Dimension Controller/And time travel is my thing/So I brought you all to the future/To show you all about the funk I bring.”) It can sometimes be hard to say whether Space Dimension Controller is a musical alias or a kind of cosplay. It’s not that his productions are derivative; at his best, Hamill has spun his influences into a rich, captivating blend whose signature would be unmistakable even without all the hokey sci-fi world-building. But his determination to stick to the bit can wear thin. The vocals and spoken-word interludes are often at cross-purposes with the genuinely immersive qualities of the music. And at times, Hamill’s determination to emulate the sound of black American electro-funk verges uncomfortably on pastiche. Love Beyond the Intersect, Hamill’s first full-length in six years, continues in the vein of its predecessors. The ambient swirl of buzzing synth drones, radio static, and spaceship noises that opens the album is so evocative of the movie theater that you can practically taste the imitation butter flavor on your tongue. True to Hamill’s penchant for concept albums, the record comes couched in a space-travel narrative that doubles as an allegory of losing and rediscovering one’s way. (Hamill has spoken in interviews and on Twitter about getting sober and finding new love, both of which are hinted at in the text accompanying the album.) Fortunately, the music doesn’t belabor the tacked-on narrative. As usual, Hamill splits his vocals between gravelly rapping and gossamer vocoded refrains, but both are downplayed here. Worked more deeply into the mix than on previous records, they’re largely indistinguishable from his synthesizers, and the lyrics mostly set aside elaborate fantasy elements in favor of couplets about self-knowledge and romantic love. If they’re still giving out Nobel Prizes for literature in the 81th century, Mr. 8040 won’t taking one home. Musically, these are Hamill’s most confident productions yet, displaying a masterfully evocative blend of textures: spongy bass synths, graphite-slicked analog drum machines, pads as rosy as the blush on a replicant’s cheeks. The fundamentals of his music haven’t changed much in the past 10 years, but his fusion of influences like Cybotron, Egyptian Lover, Model 500, and Metro Area feels more holistic than ever. They’ve all pooled into a sound you might call ambient techno-boogie, in which Detroit futurism meets ’80s disco in the neon glow of the chillout room. The problem is that Hamill’s fusion has become perhaps too holistic, because most of these songs follow exactly the same template. Again and again, he uses the same rubbery basslines and pitch-bent funk leads, the same gaseous pads, the same hissing Roland hi-hats. Sometimes, it sounds like he’s repeating old glories: “Slowtime in Reflection” is remarkably similar to the 2010 track “BBD Alignment,” just updated with more vivid production. And some songs on Love Beyond the Intersect are almost indistinguishable. “PVLN” and “Voices Lost to Empty Space,” which follows it, share the same key and tempo. Rather than complementary parts of a suite, they feel like alternate takes that Hamill couldn’t decide between. (For what it’s worth, the latter, an instrumental, is the clear winner.) This kind of consistency carries across the whole album. If you’re in the mood for it, the experience can be pleasantly immersive, like a blissfully inconsequential afternoon at the multiplex. But the world is already awash in sequels. Hamill is clearly talented; it would be nice to hear him visit some new worlds.

A Private Picture,Fran,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd5b85d2ab68500085d4fc2/1:1/w_160/fran.jpg,2019-11-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fran-a-private-picture/,Fire Talk,"Fran frontwoman Maria Jacobson had been deeply involved with musical theater her whole life, but became fed up with it while working as an actor for a small Indiana theater after college—where she’d given a commencement speech urging her class not to wait for perfect  circumstances to start creating things. Jacobson moved to Mexico, where she taught English when she wasn’t pouring thoughts into a notebook, and then into a guitar. She returned home to Chicago and started an indie rock band. In a music video for a song from Fran’s 2017 EP, More Enough, Jacobson walks across the city carrying a tray of coffees to a recipient that never appears, then finally sits down by the river and enjoys them herself. Fran songs often sound like they’re straight from the brain of someone doing exactly this. Jacobson’s musical-theater background will surprise precisely no one who hears her voice for more than a few seconds. But she doesn’t rely on it to bear the weight of Fran’s debut full-length, A Private Picture; instead, she likes to offset it with grungy foundations, creating a crunchy/smooth interplay that weaves through the album. She applies jazzy twists and ambles into notes from unexpected angles, emboldening the question marks behind interrogative, introspective lyrics that try to pin down uncertainties—about ambition, about direction, about which people to keep around. When discussing her writing process, Jacobson has spoken about the challenge of navigating between “crazy and cool-sounding” and “really simple” chord patterns. That struggle is audible at times, like she’s not entirely sure which would serve her idea better. Her choices make for some intriguingly weird moments on A Private Picture. “(I Don’t Want You to Think) I’ve Moved On” sounds like an unsent email to a not-quite ex sung aloud from a sleepy ragtime saloon. The title track goes rogue in the third verse, spiraling past its allotted time as Jacobson’s doubts burn on and her band fires up: “I’m a blur, a peripheral illusion that you use for inspiration when the inkwell’s running empty/And now I’m scared of my reflection.” Still, A Private Picture’s most profound moments are its simplest, including two or three when Jacobson nails notes so high it’s almost a shame to hear them anywhere but in a cathedral. “In My Own Time” attests to the virtue of patience in both its lyrics and strolling tempo, while “Desert Wanderer” closes the album at its peak with a languid but lucid slow burn. It stretches out over seven minutes and could have easily gotten away with another five. On “Time and Place,” Jacobson calmly repeats a koan: “I can’t feel it, but I have it/And I can’t see it, but it’s there.”  Similar wording has been used to describe religious faith, but the type of faith Jacobson seems to address on A Private Picture is more personal: faith in her intuition, faith that taking one good step now will eventually reveal another right step after that. These songs move together like a collection of personal vignettes, united in their conviction to keep that faith alive. If it doesn’t always sound effortless, it’s thoughtful, authentic, and occasionally fantastic.

La Linda,Tei Shi,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd5b5f06133160008c64174/1:1/w_160/TEISHI_LALINDA.jpg,2019-11-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tei-shi-la-linda/,Downtown,"Valerie Teicher’s debut full-length as Tei Shi, 2017’s Crawl Space, was an album of transformation, of surmounting fears. The record rested on a base of ’80s-inspired synth pop and the natural flexibility of Teicher’s voice, setting a course away from the indie pop of her first EPs. La Linda is also a record of change, the product of a move to Los Angeles from New York, where she was troubled by stifling relationships and her guarded state of mind. The album’s pared-down R&B matches Teicher’s newfound clarity and further centers her voice. “I wanted this whole project to reflect the feeling of stepping into another world that’s almost surreal or fantastical in its beauty,” she says. But the beauty she discovers is almost claustrophobic, simmering in romantic pain more often than it embraces the freedom that exists beyond it. Appearing last year on Blood Orange’s “Hope,” on Negro Swan, she sang from the perspective of someone continually let down by their lover, and she slips into the same mode of disappointment for the majority of La Linda, luxuriating in the comedown of emotional excess. Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes returns on “Even If It Hurts,” in which Teicher begs for honesty from her partner, admitting that she doesn’t want to “feel crazy” anymore. The Spanish-language “Matando” also addresses the relationship between love and emotional wear. But if before she was willing to wait for her partner to change, here Teicher is about to walk away. “Mi amor, tu amor me está matando” (“My love, your love is killing me”) she sings; “Está llegando el fin” (“The end is coming”). The album often feels like her last look back—a drawn-out kiss goodbye—before she moves on to something better. On her earlier records, Teicher occasionally strained with the effort of expressing herself, her voice breaking into a yell. But La Linda exchanges that roughness for immaculate ballads performed in Teicher’s high, whispery register. The album operates largely in the same style of sultry pop that Ariana Grande has perfected: The languid beat and bouncing chorus of “Red Light,” a track about time wasted on a dead relationship, are cut from similar cloth as thank u, next, and on “Alone in the Universe,” when Teicher confesses, “I don’t know if there is a god/But if she is a woman/I would say that she’s dropping the ball,” it’s difficult not to hear an echo of Grande’s “God is a woman,” from last year’s Sweetener. The album’s more subdued cuts, like “Thief” and closer “We,” counter that high gloss, pointing back to a time when Teicher’s music consisted of little more than her voice looped over a bassline. When Teicher gives herself over entirely to the wreckage of heartache, her songwriting floods the album’s lean production with its emotional force. Two tracks offer contrasting takes on obsession’s ruin, with Teicher brandishing her feelings like offerings to be burned and discarded. The country-tinged “When He’s Done” sounds like someone who knows they’re going to crash but still pumps the pedal because acceleration feels good. Teicher lengthens each word, helpless in the face of a love that she knows is destined to hurt her: “I believe whatever, I guess.” It’s a heartbreaking account of placing someone else before your own well-being. And on “No Juegues,” she commands, “Don’t play with my love,” but her confidence falters by the end, as she repeats, “Mi amor no vale nada” (“My love is worth nothing”). They’re songs that self-destructively consume pain in order to transcend it, leaving Teicher to rebuild herself from the debris.","On her second album, Valerie Teicher explores the nuances of her voice, luxuriating in the comedown of emotional excess over spacious, immaculately produced R&B.

Everyday Life,Coldplay,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd5b6fd2ab68500085d4fbf/1:1/w_160/coldplay.jpg,2019-11-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/coldplay-everyday-life/,ParlophoneAtlantic,"Chris Martin is backstage at Saturday Night Live discussing the Syrian refugee crisis with a group of teenagers. A few feet away, his longtime bandmate Jonny Buckland briefly drowns out the conversation to check his guitar tone, and Martin outstretches an arm to silence him in a somewhat papal display of intraband passive aggression. Buckland mutes his strings; Martin returns to the teens. “You see all these pictures of young people like you—and a bit older people like us—having to leave their countries,” he says, “and everyone calls them ‘refugees’ instead of just people.” So, he explains, Coldplay’s new song “Orphans” is his attempt to communicate how any of us could be in their position, longing to return to our normal existence. Its walloping chorus goes, “I want to know/When I can go/Back and get drunk with my friends.” Tonight when the cameras roll, Martin instructs the teenagers to dance accordingly, with abandon. And yet, even by poorly mixed SNL standards, the performance falls flat. The song itself is solid: a style of traditional character-driven folk storytelling and pure pop bliss that Martin has aged gracefully into. And his bandmates—guitarist Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion—remain as emphatic and unobtrusive as ever as they lay out his runway. But the very thing Martin asks from the young dancers doesn’t quite ring true. Somewhere amid their joyful choreography, the pro-forma Coldplay anthem, and the humanitarian crisis that inspired it lies a disconnect: After spending two decades trying to transcend the throes of our humdrum existence, how do Coldplay find their place within it? It’s the challenge they face on their new double album, Everyday Life. The moody 52-minute vision quest is spread over two distinct halves, titled Sunrise and Sunset, giving the band enough space for an unadorned voice memo and a multi-part epic with a two-minute saxophone solo. Some songs are their softest, most understated compositions since their debut, 2000’s Parachutes, while two others feature contributions from ubiquitous pop formalist Max Martin. There’s a sarcastic, seething folk song about gun violence and a deeply earnest ballad called “Daddy,” sung from the perspective of a neglected child. “It’s all about being human,” Martin said in an early interview about the record. “Every day is great and every day is terrible and every day is a blessing.” Yes it’s a cliche, but he also has tears in his eyes while he says it. Despite its sprawling architecture, the album is one of the band’s most consistent, unified works. The music is filled with other voices: Nigerian vocalist Tiwa Savage, the late qawwali singer Amjad Sabri, Alice Coltrane, Frightened Rabbit’s Scott Hutchison, and three generations of Kutis (Fela, Femi, and Made) are credited in the liner notes. While it can feel cluttered at times, overflowing with annotations and footnotes, it rarely feels heavy; the sequencing seems to inhale and exhale with each song, its attempts at arena peaks (“Church,” “Orphans”) followed by moments of mournful ambience. The dynamics help create a sense of space that’s been missing from nearly everything this band has recorded over the past 10 years. Each of this decade’s Coldplay albums has been packaged as its own (relative) experiment, a direct reaction to its predecessor: the pop one, the sad one, the happy one. And after 2015’s jubilant but uninspired A Head Full of Dreams, the largely somber tone of Everyday Life feels like its own statement: a stark gray palette that makes abundantly clear what’s absent. Without the ghastly, trend-hopping singles that have weighed down their latest releases, my favorite part of the album is also its most unprocessed portion, halfway through Sunset, where the fragments “Èkó,” “Cry Cry Cry,” and “Old Friends” roll into each other like a medley at rehearsal, something they’re just testing out for potential. The melodies don’t always stick, but the performances highlight just how long it’s been since Coldplay sounded like this: a quiet band in a small room, their characteristic enthusiasm drawn from simply making music together. These unguarded moments make Martin’s lyrics—a sore spot for this band for as long as they’ve existed—easier to forgive. “Èkó” in particular, with its lapping “Bird Song” rhythm, feels so natural and breezy that you forget the chorus reads, “In Africa, the rivers are perfectly deep and beautifully wide.” More fleshed-out political songs like “Trouble in Town,” where the band’s show-stopping climax is juxtaposed with a disturbing recording of police harassment, and “Guns,” where Martin explodes in a chorus how “everything’s gone fucking crazy,” channel similar feelings of urgency. It’s as if he realized his everyman musings would sound more compelling if they were offered as the in-progress thoughts they are. Accordingly, when it’s time to sum everything up, he finds himself at a loss. The last two tracks on the record, “Champion of the World” and “Everyday Life,” are its most traditional moments, each its own attempt to deliver a happy ending (and possibly a radio hit). “Champion of the World” finds resolution in a few mixed metaphors—a hard-won boxing match, a majestic bicycle ride, a soaring rocket ship—that all dissolve in a twinkling, singalong refrain. “Everyday Life” is less graceful in its ascent. Martin has admitted that the song itself came to him long after the band settled on the album title, and it does feel a bit like a half-filled template. For all its vague gestures toward what it means to be alive right now (“Everyone hurts, everyone cries,” Martin offers), he actually comes closest to nailing it in the opening line: “What in the world are we going to do?” Even if their answers come up short, it’s refreshing to hear Coldplay searching again, with all the rest of us.

Our Pathetic Age,DJ Shadow,by: Thomas Hobbs,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcc31a53551170008d8cd0c/1:1/w_160/pathetic.jpg,2019-11-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-shadow-our-pathetic-age/,Mass Appeal,"DJ Shadow has long been obsessed with dystopian landscapes, and since the late 1990s, the Bay Area turntablist and hip-hop producer (aka Josh Davis) has released plenty of electronic music grounded in apocalyptic themes. But his ambitious new album Our Pathetic Age isn’t rooted in science fiction; it’s intended as a reflection of the now. When announcing the record back in September, Davis spoke of a wide-ranging concept reflecting a world plagued by “rampant homelessness” and “generational poverty.” Citing institutional failure, widespread feelings of anger and confusion, and an entertainment culture grounded in distraction, he offered his mammoth double album—the first half all instrumental, the second dedicated to rap collaborations—as an attempt to find “light in darkness” and bring it to a generation seemingly glued to their devices. The album’s opener, “Nature Always Wins,” appears to represent the sheer noise of social media, with Davis stirring up wave upon wave of gloomy sounds—maybe synths, maybe metal guitars—that conjure visions of electrodes flickering up a fiber-optic cable. The mood is ominous and sometimes chaotic: “Slingblade” attacks minor-key synths with stabbing snares, and “Intersectionality” whips new-wave arpeggios into a frenzy, capturing the ferocious back-and-forth energy of a fiery online debate. As promised, the music flips between darkness and light: The funkier, euphoric bursts of bass driving the much more colorful “Rosie” and “Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law” prove that Davis hasn’t completely lost his optimism. But it’s a shame these lighter moments aren’t more frequent. The music really soars only when Davis stops trying to channel the paralyzing bleakness of the surveillance state and allows a bit more spring into his step. The shifts in tone on the second disc are frequent. On the weeded-out summertime gem “Taxin’,” Dave East warmly reflects on climbing out of the “gutter,” while Run the Jewels’ El-P and Killer Mike endearingly pay tribute to their mothers on the strong “Kings & Queens,” a lush, soulful shot of nostalgia. But on “C.O.N.F.O.R.M,” Shadow’s old Quannum associates Gift of Gab and Lateef the Truth Speaker, along with relative newcomer Infamous Taz, compare life online to The Matrix (yawn), lament that no one memorizes phone numbers anymore, and rail against internet grocery stores. And “Rain on Snow,” featuring Wu-Tang philosophers Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, and Raekwon reflecting on the modern world, boasts a beat so dated—its distorted bass and turbo-charged synths are a sound Shadow has been recycling since UNKLE’s Psyence Fiction—that you find yourself waiting for one of them to start rapping about the Y2K bug. Shadow deserves credit for spotlighting so many enigmatic underground characters, something he has done throughout his career, but the overabundance of ideas and conflicting styles quickly becomes jarring. Our Pathetic Age reflects the way much of Shadow’s post-Endtroducing material has lacked structure, with the producer happy to throw ideas at the page, even if many of them don’t stick. It’s ironic that the album’s scrambled nature might also be a casualty of the information overload of the always-online world that DJ Shadow set out to critique. Perhaps that’s the point, but it means this album, a whopping 91 minutes long, can be a real slog to sit through. After a while, it’s hard to resist the urge to simply log off.

The Oldest Sons of the Oldest Sons,Lights Fluorescent,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2d5600e83ce0008cbb704/1:1/w_160/theoldestsonsoftheoldestsons.jpg,2019-11-25 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lights-fluorescent-the-oldest-sons-of-the-oldest-sons/,Kingdoms,"The musical partnership of Dave Harrington and Benjamin Jay, a duo that calls itself Lights Fluorescent, may seem completely disjunctive. Harrington, best known as one half of Darkside, with Nicolas Jaar, has built a pedigree as an improvisatory guitarist with an avowed love for jam bands and a deft way of reframing jazz history for his own ends. Benjamin Jay makes house music, most famously with Benoit & Sergio, although his work with occasional outfit NDF expanded into more explicitly experimental terrain. Jay’s contribution to dance music has always been idiosyncratic and deeply human: He sings about loving girls who never apologize, hating DJs who focus too much on “color frequencies or resonance,” and following your principles. Along with his impeccable phrasing, this slanted yet highly credible lyrical perspective is the principal sliver of Jay’s previous projects that survives in Lights Fluorescent. A drum-free record, their debut, The Oldest Sons of the Oldest Sons, locates itself far from the dancefloor; the lyrics inhabit a nostalgic, obliquely confessional mode that, along with the heavy electronic soundscape, points toward something like chillwave. “I’ve been listening to Neil Young,” sings Jay on the standout track “Neil Young/Cues,” voice splitting the difference between nasal and husky as he completes the thought: “Those Baltimore afternoons.” Once a PhD candidate studying Renaissance literature in the aforementioned city, Jay sings like a grown son only just understanding that his Another Green World references (on the powerful “Palace Walls”) might age him out of being a kid. Harrington uses his guitar more sparingly than fans of his sprawling—both in size and ambition—ensemble the Dave Harrington Group might expect. Yet even if the skittery, allegro, electric-Miles sensibility Harrington fostered in his band is apparently absent from Lights Fluorescent, strong traces of his previous work remain, particularly his liberal and creative use of feedback. The Oldest Sons of the Oldest Sons demonstrates the growth of Harrington the producer, not Harrington the jazz musician. His embrace of the studio, paired with Jay’s always evident, albeit still nascent, ability as a pop singer-songwriter, make for a surprising, successful alchemy. The Oldest Sons of the Oldest Sons is a clinic in how to pace an album’s rhythms without using drums. Synthesizers are employed consistently yet simply, hugging tightly to chord changes. The feeling of tension and release is bound up in whether the keys—and the occasional structural bass, as on the short and sad “Epitaph”—provide a pulse, or if they serve to deepen the duo’s sense of texture, like most of the instrumentation. The record’s forays into traditional musicianship are illusory: The spiky, bright guitar line on the title track is a loop, and unlike Harrington’s jazz-fusion predecessors, whose studio embellishments were often hidden beneath a heap of instruments, the sparsity of Lights Fluorescent’s compositions does little to conceal their means of production. Some may point out that the duo looks backward musically, and certainly aspects of its sound will be familiar to anyone who surveyed the synth-happy surfaces of early 2010s indie. Yet the trajectory of the two minds behind Lights Fluorescent suggests that this project is one lucky meeting in a couple of long, omnivorous careers. Jay has decided to scale the introspective scaffolding that buttressed the dancefloor mantras of his past. Harrington, like a number of artists who cut their teeth in the jazz world—John Zorn and David Torn among them—has furthered his understanding that working in the amorphous genre of jazz fusion entails fusing with the innovations of the present, even when that means leaving jazz behind entirely. The Oldest Sons of the Oldest Sons is a fusion few would expect, which finds its makers comfortable together: on the near side of experimentation, and on the far side of pop.","Darkside’s Dave Harrington and Benoit & Sergio’s Benjamin Jay join forces on an introspective album that fuses treated guitar and ambient electronics with obliquely confessional lyrics.

Singles 1986-1991,The Springfields,by: David Glickman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd414d983a80a0009db0275/1:1/w_160/springfields.jpg,2019-11-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-springfields-singles-1986-1991/,Slumberland,"If the name The Springfields doesn’t mean much to you, you’re probably not alone. One of three different bands Ric Menck and Paul Chastain had going in the ’80s (the others being Choo Choo Train and Bag O’ Shells), it was their only collaboration with Menck center stage and singing. They only released five singles before the project ended—a quiet life for a small indie pop band. Yet here they stand, with Slumberland Records lovingly collecting their scant but glorious discography. Singles 1986-1991 fully frames the Springfields; two earnest dorks from Champaign, Illinois offering a loving and deeply earnest tribute to shiny jangle pop both of the ’60s variety (their name was curbed from an early Dusty Springfield band), and their fellow power-pop revivalists of the late ’80s. “Sunflower,” the opening cut from their debut single and many people’s first introduction to the band, is sublime, from the earworm opening riff and shuffling drum beat to the layered melodies that were uncommonly advanced for the DIY records of the time. It’s immediately evident why the band would go on to release singles on the indie pop titan Sarah Records. Their output is slim, but every song is this good. On “Wonder,” Menck sings with childlike astonishment at the betrayal of a lover; “Reachin’ For The Stars” effortlessly shifts from power pop to a psychedelic outro that also doubles as a sly demonstration of the serious chops underneath these three-chord songs. “Scatter Good Friends,” the last song recorded under the Springfields name, is the only deviation, a melancholic meditation on past mistakes performed entirely on acoustic guitar. But even here Menck’s knack for bittersweet melody shines through. Of the 12 songs that make up The Springfield’s discography, nearly half of them are covers, from the obvious choices like the Hollies’ “Clown” to covers of contemporaries like Primal Scream and The Clouds. But Menck and Chastain were so attuned to melody that less knowledgeable listeners would be forgiven for thinking they were all originals. The uncharitable read would be to suggest The Springfields were nothing but the sum of their influences. But they infuse Matthew Sweet’s “Are We Gonna Be Alright?” with quiet ache that only comes from having lived through what you’re singing about. Menck and Chastain would still collaborate after finishing the Springfields. They became bigger and louder under the name Velvet Crush, a project that would do well and would even get signed to the home of several of their influences, Creation. Yet The Springfields remains maybe their most treasured work, and for good reason. Indie pop, as maligned as it is for its simplicity, is at its most glorious when artists make something that sounds both timeless and sincere. The Springfields, over a few brief years and with only a few people noticing, pulled it off.

Black Metamorphosis,Lamin Fofana,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc05afaba7e000008b7b393/1:1/w_160/blackmetamorphosis.jpg,2019-11-23 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lamin-fofana-black-metamorphosis/,SCI-FI & FANTASY,"The first album in a proposed trilogy, Black Metamorphosis is rooted in Lamin Fofana’s experience as a black African in Berlin. The music is a wash of tone, infused with both grace and unease, at once elegiac and ambivalent. It is intended as the answer to a question Fofana posed in a recent interview: “What happens when African people… find ourselves in the West, in America or Europe? We are often in the margins, in the outskirts, or in the in-between spaces, where things are always in flux, nothing is permanent, and we are forced to improvise, come up with new ways to relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the surrounding world.” If Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports proposed ambient music as the ideal soundtrack for global citizens passing through the stateless non-places that serve as the hubs of modern air travel—still a relatively novel concept in 1978, when the album was released—Fofana suggests a different interpretation of ambient, one that is deeply embodied. Music for Airports lent tranquility to places that monotony had rendered meaningless. But Fofana’s album reinvests interstitial spaces with meaning by re-centering the experience of migrants, for whom freedom of movement is often an unimaginable luxury. The album takes its title from the Jamaican post-colonial theorist Sylvia Wynter’s Black Metamorphosis: New Natives in a New World, an unpublished, 900-page manuscript, written in the 1970s, that challenged Western constructions of race and subjectivity. Fofana grew up in Freetown, Sierra Leone; in the 1990s, he fled the country’s civil war with his family before eventually relocating to the United States and, in 2016, Berlin. This is not the first time Fofana has addressed the experience of displacement in his work. In 2015, the Another World EP used churning dub techno and oceanic sound effects to address the plight of migrants crossing the Mediterranean; the lead track, “Lampedusa,” was named after the Italian island, a contested transit point for refugees entering Europe, where hundreds of migrants have perished in shipwrecks over the past decade. Fofana’s 2018 album Brancusi Sculpting Beyoncé borrowed its title from a song on Mike Ladd’s Negrophilia, drawing links between the Modernist avant-garde’s appropriation of African art and contemporary fetishism of black popular culture. Black Metamorphosis’ underlying themes of displacement and alienation are not always obvious in the music, although a video by the Franco-Congolese artist Nicolas Premiere teases out an implicit Afro-diasporic thread. “Dawn” is a gentle swirl of hand drums and rosy synthesizer pads whose detuned chords faintly recall Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works Volume II. “Cosmic Injuries” stretches a layer of hiss over deep exhalations of bass; the held tones and birdsong of “Sono” and “Enchantment” are contemplative and perhaps nostalgic, conjuring a distant sense of place. The album turns darker in its back half, as the shape of the music dissolves into ominous rumbling and low drones. Fofana makes the album’s theme explicit on the opening track, “I’m Your Question,” burying an almost inaudible voice beneath a swirl of viscous tones. The snippet of speech is intended as the answer to a question that people of color in Europe and North America are frequently confronted with: Where are you from, and why are you here? “I am here because you were there,” is Fofana’s answer. It’s a formulation as elegant as it is cryptic, neatly demolishing the logic of margin and center, colonizer and colonized. That the words are so hard to make out is intentional, Fofana says. To blur the answer is a way of underscoring the imbalance of power implicit in the question; it is a defense of the fundamental right to be private, unknowable. In its opacity, Black Metamorphosis does something similar. For all its expressiveness, it guards its secrets. I sometimes find myself wishing that the album was more direct, less veiled. But perhaps that desire is itself an expression of privilege, a stubborn refusal to allow Fofana to reclaim ambient music for his own purposes, in his own way. Eno declared that ambient music should be as ignorable as it is interesting. But ignoring—ignorance—comes from a position of power. Fofana’s Black Metamorphosis asks instead: Who gets to zone out—and at what cost?","The Berlin-based musician reconceives ambient music as an urgent, deeply embodied project interrogating the experiences of black Africans in the West.

Hockets for Two Voices EP,Meara O’Reilly,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2b9b54aba6d0009f18d95/1:1/w_160/hockets.jpg,2019-11-23 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/meara-oreilly-hockets-for-two-voices-ep/,Cantaloupe,"In the 14th century, Pope John XXII weighed in on music. In his Docta sanctorum patrum of 1324-25, he declared that notes of “small values” disturbed the recitation of prayers and distracted worshippers from true devotion. The target of his disdain was hocketing, a musical technique that involves splitting a single melody into brief phrases and dividing each phrase between several voices or instruments. As each part alternates, the rapid back-and-forth exchange creates a complete melody. Nearly 700 years later, Hockets for Two Voices, a 10-minute, seven-movement EP by Los Angeles composer, artist, and instrument designer Meara O’Reilly, suggests there’s still something mystical about hockets. Hocketing’s name comes from the French word “hoquet,” or “hiccup.” Though it’s frequently associated with sacred songs of the European Middle Ages, the rhythmic practice originated in African vocal and instrumental traditions. Today, hocketing remains a popular—though ambitious—vocal or instrumental approach. This sustained, carefully rehearsed game of musical ping-pong can be found across contemporary genres, from modern classical to funk to indie rock. Meredith Monk has used the technique to create a complex vocal balancing act; Dirty Projectors’ David Longstreth is an exceptionally passionate fan of hockets and frequently employs chirping, call-and-response vocal arrangements. The proliferation of hocketing across time and culture, from Balinese gamelan to Ghanian flutes to medieval motets, illustrates its universal appeal. O’Reilly’s interest in hockets began with a fascination with auditory perception. Drawing on her experience co-creating an app that uses 2-D geometry to generate rhythm patterns and designing visuals for Björk’s Biophilia tour based on the songs’ basslines, she considered the historical use of hocketing and decided to push the format further. O’Reilly was particularly captivated by the work of psychoacoustic researcher Albert Bregman, who studied how people perceive sound. Though Hockets for Two Voices has no production and never more than two notes at a time, the precise arrangement of O’Reilly’s compositions creates the illusion of a wide, vibrant palette, a trompe-l’oreille known as pseudo-polyphony. The separation of her voice in stereo also establishes a spatial relationship, shifting the experience depending where you place your attention. But Hockets for Two Voices is also an experiment in performance. Hockets are intended to be produced by two or more individuals or instruments. O’Reilly’s decision to record Hockets for Two Voices alone turns it into an endurance piece. Over the course of a year, she painstakingly trained her vocal cords to jump to sharp new heights, then carefully cobbled each part together. The result is so exact in tone and pitch that it initially comes off as artificial. But as your ears adjust to the pattern, the swift popping of O’Reilly’s voice becomes more intricate and organic, like a cluster of bursting bubbles. Though Hockets for Two Voices is a small record, it invites us to investigate the endless potential of our individual perception.","A 10-minute EP presents an ambitious solo exploration of hocketing, a musical technique with a long and curious history.

EVERYBODY’S EVERYTHING,Lil Peep,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2c9e83551170008d8d078/1:1/w_160/everybodyseverything.jpeg,2019-11-22 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-peep-everybodys-everything/,Columbia,"It’s pretty much impossible for a posthumous album—usually an unwieldy approximation of a musician’s style assembled from leftover scraps and second-choice stems —to stand apart from the passing of the artist. This is especially true for Lil Peep. Revisiting the work recorded in his lifetime is already a particularly vulnerable experience; listening to words like “Took her to the crib and I show her how I die…/Lord why, Lord why, do I gotta wake up?” is made harder when you know the person saying them got what they asked for. This compilation, released to accompany the documentary of the same name, collects recordings from various points in Peep’s career, from unheard collaborations with Rich the Kid and Diplo, to earlier tracks never formally released on streaming services, as well as all three songs from the recent GOTH ANGEL SINNER EP. As someone who blasted “Beamer Boy” for weeks after Peep died, last year’s Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2 hardly left an impression; this compilation makes up for the sanitization and sanded-down edges of that album by leaving everything mostly untouched. Few polished pop flourishes are found here, mostly just the looped guitars, trap drums, and aching vocal fry that made Peep an angel to so many. What EVERYBODY’S EVERYTHING shows is an artist beyond his sadness; more than a portrait of Peep alone, it tells his story in collaborations. Featured here are most of the regular producers who helped shape his polarizing blend of genres, like Nedarb, Fish Narc, Bighead, Smokeasac, and fellow GothBoiClique member Cold Hart. Though Peep obviously wrote and recorded “Moving On” before he passed, it’s hard not to hear that song’s role call of the GBC roster as shout-outs sent to old friends from beyond. Three tracks—“Fangirl,” “LA to London,” “Rockstarz”—feature Gab3, formerly of the duo Uzi (whose Eiffel 65-flipping, rave-inflected raps are highlights of the SoundCloud rap era), maybe better known as the lo-fi cameraman behind Kanye’s “Famous” video. These songs, apparently intended for a “summer EP,” are considerably brighter than most of Peep’s work, more pop-punk than emo thanks to upbeat guitars and Gab3’s nasally flow. The weakest song is unsurprisingly the oldest:  “Keep My Coo,” posted to SoundCloud in 2014 but deleted at some point after. It’s one of Peep’s few straight-up rap songs, with bars about blowing gas and playing Madden, more indistinct than bad. Peep’s monotone ad-libs sound so clearly influenced by BONES, whose hazy, haunting raps were all the rage online around the time “Keep My Coo” would have been recorded. It is the work of a kid still determining his creative identity, and the best part of EVERYBODY’S EVERYTHING is how it shows him figuring himself out through his work with others. Most essentially, this album writes a key collaborator back into Peep’s narrative: Lil Tracy, his self-described “twin” and a vocal critic of the appropriation of his legacy. The album concludes with four of their most iconic duets: “white tee,” “cobain,” “witchblades,” and an unreleased acoustic version of “walk away as the door slams.” Their songs together belong as much to Tracy as they do to Peep; on “witchblades,” Tracy sets up the shot—“Cocaine, all night long/When I die bury me with all my ice on”—and Peep brings it all the way home—“When I die bury me with all my ice on/When I die bury me with all the lights on.” There’s a deep feeling of brotherly love in the agony they share together in song, two spirits brought together by shared illnesses and anguish. Tracy and Peep recorded “white tee” on the first day they met, back when Tracy went by Yung Bruh. That “Such Great Heights” flip is maybe the most obvious sample in Peep’s catalogue, but there’s something in the Postal Service’s practice of recording Give Up—Jimmy Tamborello and Ben Gibbard sending demos back and forth through the mail—that speaks to Peep’s life and legacy. A boy in Long Island becoming a star by retreating into his bedroom, linking with like-minded artists in Seattle and California on Soundcloud, his most devoted fanbase in countries he’d never dreamed of going to, his spirit given life again online by his loved ones and acolytes.","Released to accompany the documentary of the same name, this compilation tells the story of Peep’s evolution through his collaborations.

WXAXRXP Sessions,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2e1b50e42fa00082c4548/1:1/w_160/155631-1.jpg,2019-11-22 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-wxaxrxp-sessions/,Warp,"If you want to survive and thrive creatively in the music industry long-term, you could do worse than study Warp. The UK indie label got its start in the late 1980s with a bass-heavy regional dance sound known as bleep. By 2000, Warp had relocated from Sheffield to London, and led the rise of what it dubbed “electronic listening music” and others called, for better or worse, intelligent dance music. Over the past two decades, the label has expanded its horizons, dabbling everywhere from Los Angeles beat music to Brooklyn art-rock to chameleonic Detroit rapper Danny Brown. Last year’s Warp debut by Yves Tumor, Safe in the Hands of Love, felt like another future milestone. So Warp has certainly earned a 30th-anniversary celebration. Less clear is what released form that should take in 2019, when the label’s groundbreaking studio work is only a couple of taps away, and previous anniversary compilations already exist. Large anthologies are crucial in Warp’s history, going back to 1992’s genre-defining IDM compilation Artificial Intelligence, which helped expose Aphex Twin and Autechre. WXAXRXP Sessions, available piecemeal or as a 10-disc vinyl box set, distinguishes itself by bringing together only radio sessions, including previously obscure or unreleased tracks. There are 41 tracks here, from 10 of Warp’s defining artists, with recording dates spanning from 1990 to this summer. That’s more than three hours of music, and plenty of it is great: an alternate-history crash course in a boundary-pushing label’s impressive breadth of vision. But a collection of 10 radio sessions is still a collection of radio sessions. This buffet of material feels like it would once have been relegated to B-sides on import-only CD singles, to be cherished by the most diehard fans. In a press release, guitarist Mark Clifford of Seefeel tells a story that seems emblematic of WXAXRXP Sessions. The electronic-leaning UK shoegaze innovators are represented here with a dubby 1994 radio session for beloved BBC radio host John Peel that includes two previously unreleased tracks. One of them, an aqueous, lurching beast that would make an incredible sample for a present-day rap song, the band apparently came up with on the spot. Clifford recalls that Peel announced the song by saying, “Rough for Radio, that’s exactly how we like it,” and the title stuck. WXAXRXP Sessions offers the chance to hear some of the label’s more heavily mythologized artists in just this state, rough for radio. Aphex Twin is documented here in another Peel session, one of only two that Cornish synth wizard Richard D. James (among many other aliases) has ever done. This warm, playful set—highlighted by rarity “Slo Bird Whistle,” which sounds true to its name—is an inviting glimpse of James on the eve of his 1995 album ...I Care Because You Do. The 1998 Peel session by Boards of Canada, the Scottish electronic duo’s sole radio performance, loosens up a few tracks from their sublime album of the same year, Music Has the Right to Children, alongside a Peel-only curio: the glitchy, percussive “XYZ.” A previously unreleased 1990 Peel session by Leeds’ LFO accounts for Warp’s rave-era origins, though the haunting “Rob’s Nightmare” shows the duo was already thinking beyond the dancefloor. More recent Warp radio sessions illuminate how the label has evolved while maintaining its forward-looking spirit. A four-song set by Flying Lotus, most of which originally aired on BBC Radio 1 in 2010, finds a top-notch band breathing new life into heady jazz-funk from that year’s Cosmogramma and 2007’s Reset EP, plus a sultry one-off called “Golden Axe.” Four songs recorded by Mount Kimbie during Warp’s takeover of London online radio station NTS this past June underline what a forceful live act the once primarily electronic duo has become, bolstered by scene-stealer Mica Levi’s beautifully slurred “Marilyn” guest vocal. New York composer Kelly Moran, whose session is the only one here that has never been broadcast, extends the Warp tradition of contemplative, deep-listening experiences into the less familiar realm of prepared piano. As an excuse to expose new audiences to Warp’s formidable roster, WXAXRXP Sessions is fine, and piling all these sessions into a playlist and hitting shuffle is fascinating; they flow, despite their differences. But, unusually for the label, this seems less like the sound of tomorrow than a (lavishly assembled) completist novelty. There, too, Warp may be a harbinger of how to get by in the record business. Considering the richness of the scraps stitched together here, it’s hard to get too upset about whatever keeps the music playing.

Tangerine,Shanti Celeste,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2da4d4aba6d0009f18d9d/1:1/w_160/tangerine.jpg,2019-11-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shanti-celeste-tangerine/,Peach Discs ,"There’s always been a certain sweetness to Shanti Celeste’s productions. Since 2013, the Chilean-born, London-based artist has filled her tunes with colorful melodies and breezy rhythms, so that even her biggest floor-fillers have felt impressively light on their feet. “Strung Up,” from 2015, was a glistening homage to upbeat ’80s electro, while 2017’s “Loop One” layered swelling pastoral pads over a sturdy kick drum and clacking percussion. Although Celeste doesn’t shy away from heavier offerings in the DJ booth—her sets are often punctuated with riotous bits of jungle and rave—her penchant for melody and buoyant beats has also colored her curation of Peach Discs, which has quietly been one of electronic music’s strongest imprints over the past two years. Celeste now operates the label alongside Berlin-based Brit Gramrcy, and while she produced Peach Discs’ first release, she’s largely allowed the music of others to define its subsequent run. Aside from records by more established artists like Call Super and Ciel, there have also been gems from up-and-comers like Chekov, Fred, and Videopath. This year has seen an uptick in Celeste’s own output. Earlier this year, she dropped Soba Dance, a collaborative EP with Bristol stalwart Hodge. Although its three tunes hinted at the thundering percussion often found on the latter’s records for Livity Sound and Berceuse Heroique, Celeste’s playful spirit is all over the record. On Tangerine, she’s allowed that spirit to run free, delivering an effervescent LP that also represents a significant expansion of her sound. Like many dance-music artists, Celeste has chosen to pepper her first full-length with forays into ambient music, but Tangerine is one of the rare cases in which those efforts don’t feel like forgettable filler. Opener “Sun Notification” is a gently bubbling new-age cut, its soothing melodies rising and falling like the tide. At the other end of the album is “Moons,” a more introspective tune that blends soft synths, the gentle sound of rainfall, and a welcoming sense of calm; the song could soundtrack a quiet visit to a Buddhist temple. “Slow Wave,” on the other hand, takes a different path toward serenity, weaving snippets of Celeste’s own voice into a blissful canopy atop a soft, barely-there drum beat. Celeste also experiments with her beat-based tracks. “Voz (Instrumental)” almost sounds like hip-hop, its punchy percussion and vaguely Middle Eastern melody bringing to mind classic Timbaland. Upping the tempo significantly is “Want,” a bouncy cut with a klaxon-like synth stabs, an infectiously shuffling beat, and some delicate keys; in less than six minutes, it manages to reference ’90s jungle, rave, and IDM without coming off as derivative. That ability to freshen up established sounds and styles is one of Celeste’s biggest strengths. At this stage in her career, she’s a skilled DJ who instinctively knows what works on the dancefloor, which helps explain the effortless appeal of songs like “Infinitas” and “Sesame”; although they are, at root, relatively standard house tunes, they’re also unusually lively, bounding along with bright melodies and swinging rhythms that nod to old-school Jersey garage. “May the Day” tackles electro, and its inventive drum pattern and murky swirl of gurgling acid are unlike any of Celeste’s previous work within the genre. “Aqua Block” perhaps best captures the album’s invigorating spirit. Bursting with energy, the track rumbles along with the enthusiasm of a toddler chasing a butterfly, its pastel melodies impishly darting to and fro. At a time when so many of Celeste’s peers are delving into dark, distorted sounds, she’s chosen to walk a lighter path. It’s not easy to sound this carefree, yet it appears to come naturally to her.","Balancing unassuming ambient and downtempo experiments with lush, floor-filling house and electro, the London DJ’s debut album sounds refreshingly carefree.

BABY GOAT,YNW BSlime,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2dbd12c290700080ad48d/1:1/w_160/babygoat.jpg,2019-11-22 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ynw-bslime-baby-goat/,self-released,"YNW BSlime spent his middle school vacation playing Fortnite until his older brother, Florida rapper YNW Melly, told him that if he didn’t leave the house and come hang out at the studio, he was taking back his credit card so he couldn’t buy V-Bucks, the in-game Fortnite currency. BSlime gave in and reluctantly accompanied Melly to New Era studios in South Florida. There he was pushed by his brother to go in the booth and spit a freestyle and to BSlime’s surprise, everyone loved it. In February, YNW Melly was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Police in the city of Miramar, Florida claimed that Melly shot and killed two members of his YNW crew. (Melly plead not guilty and prosecutors are currently seeking the death penalty.) After his arrest Melly’s music grew; his single, the eerily prescient “Murder on my Mind,” originally released in 2017, peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since gone multi-platinum. Then, in July, as his YouTube account crossed two million subscribers, “Slime Dreams,” the debut music video of his 12-year-old younger brother YNW BSlime, was uploaded to his channel. Even before his arrest, YNW Melly’s sing-songy rap was breaking through on SoundCloud, YouTube, and in Florida—Kanye West appeared on his January 2019 single “Mixed Personalities.” His piano-heavy ballads sounded like he was performing warm-hearted odes to his first love, but typically they were twisted and heavily detailed stories about murder, death, home invasions, pain, and jail. As a singer, YNW BSlime’s vocals were similar; you could tell he grew up on Young Thug like his brother. But instead of Melly’s rough edge, BSlime’s raps are brighter, like he sings hopped up on Honey Buns and dollar cans of Arizona iced tea. On BABY GOAT, the debut of YNW BSlime, the preteen sounds a lot like what would have happened if a My World-era Justin Bieber got to experience the pessimistic lovesickness of Juice WRLD. As far as rappers too young to drive go, BSlime is pretty gifted; he has syrupy vocals and he doesn’t rely on shock (See: Matt Ox and Bouba Savage). His love ballads can be mature, but not uncomfortably mature. “Is this love that I’m feeling? I think I’m losin’ my mind/I need you right now, I’ll give you all my time,” he sings on the charming intro “Like That.” Though it’s less about his lyrics, which are what you would expect from a 12-year-old, and more about the whistle high range that can hang with hip-hop’s sing-rap elite. But BSlime isn’t breaking any new ground. “Just Want You” falls too far down the sappy Kidz Bop lane. On “Wipe Your Eyes,” he deviates from his usual sunny vocals for a grating, Lil Keed-like high-pitched screech over a pedestrian acoustic guitar. “Nobody Else” has a bouncy R&B rhythm and fingersnaps that will have middle school dances on smash, though I have trouble getting past BSlime flirting like someone who has clearly never flirted before. He’s at his best on BABY GOAT when he’s writing mildly angsty coming-of-age pop singles like “Slime Emotions” or when he’s by the side of his brother on “Dying For You.” Next to Melly, it’s clear that BSlime needs more experience. Their lyrics aren’t that much different, but Melly’s very troubling emotions elevate his writing. BSlime, on the other hand, is harmless. He’ll keep you engaged for two and a half minutes with that glossy singing voice, but after 13 songs you realize he could have held back on some of the melodramatic romance. That should change as he gets older. In the meantime YNW BSlime is still the little brother of YNW Melly that happens to sing—at least now he can run up those video game charges freely.","The younger brother of YNW Melly is only 12 years old, and his debut is sure to have middle school dances on smash.

Flamagra (Instrumentals),Flying Lotus,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed7be2fd14d2dac76595638/1:1/w_160/Flamagara%20(Instrumentals)_Flying%20Lotus.jpg,2020-06-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flying-lotus-flamagra-instrumentals/,Warp,"Roughly a year ago, Flying Lotus released Flamagra, an expansive, cosmic jazz-funk saga that spanned 27 songs over the course of 67 minutes and featured 10 guest vocalists. His latest offering is an instrumental version of the LP, now scrubbed of vocals from Anderson .Paak, George Clinton, and Tierra Whack, among others. The result conjures ambivalence: On one hand, songs snipped away from their narrator can feel like canned backing tracks. On the other, the pure instrumentals allow FlyLo’s detailed compositions and soundscaping to take the lead role, without competition from other big personalities. None of the original guest vocalists did Flamagra any harm, but they did risk ejecting you from FlyLo’s wild, sci-fi spiritual journey. The album’s opening minutes chart an undulating course through the cosmos: On the spectacular “Heroes,” we’re jet-propelled by skittering percussion, lightspeed guitar noodling, and radiant chorals. The ride ebbs and flows with the subsequent “Post Requisite” and “Heroes in a Half Shell,” but the appearance of Anderson .Paak’s distinctive voice on “More”—while perfectly suited to the song itself—feels like a sudden call back to earth. The instrumental version does away with those distractions, allowing for a more immersive listening experience. While Flamagra as a whole is strengthened by the instrumental treatment, individual tracks can suffer. Compared with the richness of surrounding songs, “More” sounds unfinished without .Paak. Tierra Whack’s performance on “Yellow Belly” was a highlight of the original album, twisting and contorting her voice as if shaping a surreal balloon animal. Without her idiosyncratic delivery, the song is just a series of curt handclaps, chimes, and bass couplets. There’s a prominent, palpable absence that was clearly meant to be sung over. Some tracks are musically fortified enough to stand on their own. While it’s impossible not to miss George Clinton’s warm rasp on “Burning Down the House,” the sturdy, meandering funk holds strong thanks to Thundercat’s titan bassline. The swerve of fretless bass and spangly synths on “Spontaneous” are far more captivating on their own than alongside Little Dragon’s somewhat sanitized soul vocals. Similarly, the Toro y Moi-featuring “9 Carrots” doesn’t lose much without a singer. One question looms over the Flamagra instrumentals: Why? It’s not a matter of quality, but of intent. Flamagra already featured 17 instrumental tracks in its original release; the decision to strip the voices from the other 10 seems like an afterthought, and occasionally sounds like one. There is also a slight issue of consistency. Why is David Lynch’s spoken word piece “Fire Is Coming” the only guest appearance to remain on the instrumental version? Perhaps Flamagra could have made sense as two separate albums: 17 instrumentals on one disc, 10 guest-featuring songs on the other. As adjoining chapters in the same book, the two releases would be in conversation with one another. But it’s hard to imagine someone listening to Flamagra as it was re-released to streaming services, with the initial album and the instrumental version back-to-back—not only because of their length, but because of their sequential similarities. The addition of Flamagra (Instrumental) is best suited for the FlyLo completist: It may be more cohesive as a trip, but it doesn’t offer any truly new revelations.","The instrumental edition of last year’s cosmic jazz-funk odyssey brings Flying Lotus’ detailed compositions and soundscaping to center stage.

Muzz,Muzz,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e970d1b1a3ea30008764f32/1:1/w_160/Muzz.jpg,2020-06-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/muzz-muzz/,Matador,"Like “Superman” or “superfood,” the term “supergroup” conjures an image of energy and might: a many-tentacled mutant band, drawing power from its individually famous members. Muzz, though, is the kind of supergroup that feels more like a nourishing break from other, more demanding endeavors. Paul Banks, whose dour, authoritative baritone can’t help but draw attention to his day job as Interpol’s frontman, formed the new band with two old friends: Matt Barrick, a fellow Meet Me in the Bathroom-era veteran best known for drumming in the Walkmen, and Josh Kaufman, a longtime producer and multi-instrumentalist whose resume includes work with the National and Bob Weir, as well as his own folk group, Bonny Light Horseman. The trio had the poor fortune of launching the new project in early March 2020—a fluke of timing that ensured their first-ever “live” performance was a socially distanced unplugged session—but this album had been gestating for years before that. (In fact, Banks and Kaufman have been friends since their high-school years, with pictures to prove it.) The earliest Muzz sessions occurred around 2015; later, the band convened at various studios and practice spaces, letting the project evolve at a leisurely pace. Now, at a moment when such in-person collaboration feels impossibly luxurious, the self-titled full-length finally arrives. Muzz’s music sounds similarly unhurried, from the start-stop murmur of “Bad Feeling” to the foggy folk drift of “Patchouli,” an impressive mood piece colored by synth pads that unfurl like a slow-motion iTunes visualizer. While Banks and his Interpol colleagues have spent decades fending off Joy Division comparisons, Muzz swaps out the icy atmospherics for a warmer, earthier slate of influences, including Neil Young and Bob Dylan. Slide guitar, pedal steel, and horns fill in the margins; one of the better tracks, the somber, dramatic “Broken Tambourine,” boasts a piano overture ornamented with birdcalls, as though it were recorded in an open field many miles from Interpol’s natural habitat. The result is perhaps the weariest-sounding supergroup album you’ll hear this year. Occasionally the band shifts up a gear, resulting in overcast mid-tempo rockers like “Red Western Sky” or “Knuckleduster,” which reprises the galloping shuffle Barrick used on Walkmen classics like “Juveniles.” Mostly, though, Muzz is an intricately crafted pastoral travelogue, piecing together the sighing psychedelic twang of “Evergreen,” the acoustic jangle of “Everything Like It Used to Be,” the gorgeous campfire reverie of “All Is Dead to Me,” and the folktronica death rattle of “Patchouli.” Though it often sounds lovely—thanks to impressively layered arrangements and Kaufman’s obvious instrumental mastery—it could have benefited from summoning more of the urgency associated with Banks’ and Barrick’s respective bands. Without it, listless songs like “Chubby Checker” and “Trinidad” float by without leaving much of an impression. Given how distinctive Banks’ voice is, it’s impossible for this stuff not to sound at least a little like Interpol. Once he crooned about the subway being a porno; here his lyrics (written in collaboration with his bandmates) summon images of oceans and red western skies. Still, the singer retains a knack for beguiling, impressionistic imagery (“The bees in the frying pan/The shards in the carpet”). If there’s an inadvertent theme, it’s what Banks describes as “meditations on mental health and the quest for happiness.” That’s apparent on the group’s best song, “Evergreen,” with its velvety groove and cryptic references to an unnamed medication taking over one’s life. Whether Muzz wind up being a lasting band or a one-off diversion, this is a promising debut from three old friends who have an instinctive grasp of each other’s talents. For Interpol loyalists, it’s a lot less patience-testing than a rap mixtape titled Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be. And for Banks, it’s got to be nice to have a band that doesn’t require you to wear a suit all the time.","Bringing together members of Interpol, the Walkmen, and Bonny Light Horseman, the indie supergroup’s debut album is a carefully crafted pastoral travelogue.

Head Above the Water,Brigid Mae Power,by: Graeme Thomson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed7c4b5fd5cd0dd6940649f/1:1/w_160/Head%20Above%20The%20Water_Brigid%20Mae%20Power.jpg,2020-06-04 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brigid-mae-power-head-above-the-water/,Fire,"Brigid Mae Power’s music never quite settles on solid ground. The Irish singer-songwriter flits between past and present; between traditional and modern forms; between the heaven in her voice and the earthbound epiphanies of her words. Her last album was called The Two Worlds. I’d say she inhabits a few more than that. Power emerged from Galway’s bohemian scene, experimenting with the parameters of traditional music in unlit car parks and remote churches. Until now, the echo of open spaces has been a defining feature of her music, her intimate songs bolstered by cavernous reverb and drone. Those textures are less prominent on her third album. Recorded in Glasgow in three days with a band assembled by Scottish contemporary folkie Alasdair Roberts, who co-produced alongside Power and her husband Peter Broderick, Head Above the Water fills out her sound with a broader sweep of instrumentation. There is room for the bodhran, fiddle, and bouzouki, but also the synthesizer, Shruti box, drums, and electric guitar. Roberts encourages a more adventurous spirit to enter the proceedings. Though still rooted in folk—there’s a stunning cover of the traditional ballad “The Blacksmith”—the 10 songs blend elements of jazz, country rock, slowcore, and psychedelia. Occasionally, the music has real bite, as on the snaking, sinister “I Was Named After You.” More typically, the songs amble dreamily toward their destination, as though following an ancient map on which the coordinates have begun to fade. On “Wedding of a Friend” and “You Have a Quiet Power,” buffeted by cross breezes of pedal steel and Mellotron, Power sounds like she’s fronting a slightly woollier Mazzy Star. “On a City Night” recalls the giddy joie de vivre of some of the lighter moments on Bob Dylan and The Band’s Basement Tapes. What remains from past albums is the plain beauty of Power’s voice, part of a lineage that includes Anne Briggs, Linda Perhacs, and Beth Orton. It seems otherworldly until you listen to the words. Head Above the Water is, she says, “a continuing tale of everyday survival.” The lyrics merge the poetic and prosaic, recounting past conversations, recalling locations, journeys, small moments, until the whole assumes a cumulative weight. In “Wedding of a Friend,” a baby’s head lies on her chest, “stuck with sweat.” In “On a City Night,” a quotidian conversation regarding the merits of city vs. country begets a sly love song about giving up things you cherish for the person you want to be with. In “Wearing Red That Eve,” the color of a dress denotes an elemental strength. As the song unfolds lazily over a soulful three-chord pattern, Power rises above the yelled profanities of a group of men on a New York street and ascends to the mountains, where she professes love “for everything and everyone.” On many of these songs, she tells her story and then breaks into a series of wordless cries which carry their own meaning. Mostly, it sounds like joy. While previously Power seemed to be swimming against a tide of bad luck—she has spoken about her struggles as a single mother and past abusive relationships—there’s an air of breakthrough here, articulated most clearly on “I Was Named After You”: “I was in a battle I could neither win or lose, but time has passed and I can freely move.” There are some obvious flaws. The uniformity of mood, melody, and texture means the album can drag, and while the spontaneity of the recordings is largely vindicated by the results, it also leaves some loose threads dangling. “Not Yours to Own” isn’t alone in meandering prettily without seeming to care too much about where it’s headed; a more attentive working process might have developed things further. At her best, however, Power lives up to her name. The closing title track, with its glassy beauty, twinkling piano, and soft strings, speaks to her continued progress. An artist at swim, head above the water, “looking across to the shore.”","The Irish folk singer’s third album fills out her sound to incorporate elements of jazz, country rock, slowcore, and psychedelia.

Alfredo,Freddie GibbsThe Alchemist,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed56eb59bcc962f72cc0b57/1:1/w_160/Alfredo_Freddie%20Gibbs%20and%20The%20Alchemist.jpg,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/freddie-gibbs-the-alchemist-alfredo/,ESGNALCEMPIRE,"Hip-hop’s obsession with the Italian Mafia has always been curious. While there’s certainly something perversely romantic about Hollywood’s paeans to La Cosa Nostra, the characters at the heart of these stories—both in real life and on screen—were incorrigibly racist. Mafiosos said and did awful things to black people. And yet rappers have been glorifying dons and capos ever since Kool G Rap and DJ Polo’s Road to the Riches, idolizing men in custom suits smoking cigars who often saw them as less than human. Alfredo, the collaborative LP from rapper Freddie Gibbs and producer the Alchemist, tugs at the root of this fascination. From its Mario Puzo-esque cover art to the various gangster-movie samples throughout its 35-minute runtime, it celebrates the mafioso aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging its ugliness. And at its core, the Mafia’s role in hip-hop has always been one of aspirational criminality, based in respect for the hustle above all else. Rappers who rap about selling drugs in the trap don’t want to be holed up in a dilapidated vacant home, they want to be dining on fine china in designer clothes. Mafiosos showed them how to do that, all the while thumbing their noses at a WASPy aristocracy that saw them as second-class citizens. Throughout the album, Gibbs and the Alchemist’s reference points suggest a deeper understanding of this dynamic. Its anti-heroes aren’t white mobsters with mulignan in their mouths like John Gotti or Tony Soprano, but Harlem kingpins Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson, black gangsters who lorded over a black neighborhood selling drugs to black people. When those figures do appear, like in the sample of Chazz Palminteri as Joseph Bonnano in the TV series Godfather of Harlem on “Baby $hit,“ their naked disgust for black people is laid bare. An extended sample of the ’70s blaxploitation flick The Black Godfather (“Look at Me”) suggests the kind of narrative that a dope game rapper like Gibbs might aspire to: a street kid clawing his way to the top, wresting control over his neighborhood’s criminal enterprise from its white interloper. Gibbs has long exhibited a mastery of this duality, with a rap flow so seductive it makes a life of crime sound extremely attractive...until he drops a bar so foul and gnarly it lifts the veil. He doesn’t rap in the abstract either, nor try to justify any of it; on “Skinny Suge,” he raps, “Man, my uncle died off a overdose/And the fucked up part about that is, I know who supplied the nigga that sold it.” And while the Alchemist’s upbringing—white, Jewish, born in Beverly Hills—stands in stark contrast to Gibbs’, his gift lies in crafting bespoke beats that suit not just a rapper’s flow, but their entire style and ethos. He makes it easy for Gibbs to be Gibbs. And on Alfredo, that style is vintage luxury, bathed in elegant piano with faded textures colored by time that sound even more beautiful now than when they were new. On “Look at Me,” he plucks the high note from the Moments’ song of the same name, warping it into a warble that swirls around strings and horns. And the first notes of “Scottie Beam” are so opulent that you’d expect to hear Rick Ross’ deep, velvety purr regardless of whether or not you’d peeped the album credits. For his part, Gibbs skates over these beats, effortlessly gliding in and out of the pocket. Even the moments of stark contrast feel natural. On “Something to Rap About,” Gibbs channels the Merovingian from the Matrix trilogy—who memorably likened cursing in French to “wiping your ass with silk”—barking obscenities over a somnambulant Miami Beach cocktail lounge type beat. And on “Baby $hit,” the most buoyant of Alfredo’s compositions, he balances his drug kingpin image with his life as a father: “Rabbit potty training every morning, ho, I’m cookin’ dope and cleaning baby shit.” By this point, neither Gibbs nor the Alchemist have much of anything to prove—the former has been rapping circles around nearly everyone for the last five or six years, and the latter has been a go-to beatmaker for A-list rappers since the turn of the century. But their pairing here seems particularly inspired, even within the context of each other’s individual producer/rapper collaborative albums. The two have been working together since at least 2004, but ever since their 2011 collaboration on Curren$y’s “Scottie Pippen,” Gibbs has been sharpening his raps to the point where it seems like he can slice through any beat. And it’s somewhat stunning that even amid a career full of rap classics, the Alchemist’s current production run may represent a new high-water mark. As neither party seems content with letting this be their last collaboration, Alfredo is likely just a taste of what they can accomplish together.","The gruff-voiced rapper and dusty-groove producer are a perfect match as they connect for a seamless ride to the heart of the gangster.

Hit to Hit,2nd Grade,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed68556d5f4a1d8ae15fb19/1:1/w_160/600x600bb.jpg,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2nd-grade-hit-to-hit/,Double Double Whammy,"The music video for “Velodrome”—a breezy indie power-pop cut off 2nd Grade’s second record Hit to Hit—features the band dressed up in character as a beatnik, a flower child, a home baker, a cowboy, and a bubble bather. Each is rendered as both earnest and comically archetypal—the beat poet, for example, plays the drums in tiny sunglasses and a French beret, in front of a copy of Infinite Jest, while never once breaking into winking self-awareness. Those discrete sketches of slightly askew tropes provide an apt visual guide to Hit to Hit, a record that often feels like a series of creative writing assignments illuminated by compact pop hooks. Led by guitarist and vocalist Peter Gill, 2nd Grade is the product of Philadelphia’s thriving DIY scene, a supergroup of sorts for fans of West Philly house shows. Catherine Dwyer and Jack Washburn of the cult punk group Remember Sports provide guitar and bass, respectively; guitarist and vocalist Jon Samuels collaborated with Gill on the folk-country act Friendship; Gill previously played guitar in the now-defunct indie pop act Free Cake for Every Creature. There’s even a vocal credit from Carmen Perry of Remember Sports’ two-year-old brother. Gill’s new venture takes bits and pieces from each of those acts—the childlike wonder of Free Cake’s songwriting, the melodies of Remember Sports, the Americana of Friendship—and rids itself of any context or pretense. Instead, each song on the record exists with its own internal logic, homing in on a single concept—taxes, Texas, the existential freedom of riding your first bike—as the core tenant of that song’s universe. If Gill’s vision weren’t so specific, and if the band weren’t so mutable in their approaches to instrumentation, these concepts would quickly wear thin. But at every possible juncture, Gill leans heavily into the playfulness of his ideas. There’s the cartoonish gunshot effects on “Shooting From the Hip” and the sound of motorcycles revving on the ode to road films “Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider.” There’s the thrashing punk track “Baby’s First Words,” whose title only starts to make sense as a toddler giddily yells “Truck!” Though most of the record exists in the broader sounds of indie pop, borrowing from the jangly guitar of Big Star’s Chris Bell and the bright chord progressions of the Beach Boys, Hit to Hit manages to keep a sense of novelty by shifting modes throughout—on “100 Hrs,” Samuels’ deep, rounded twang takes the record into “Lonesome Cowboy” territory; the noisy discord and shouting vocals on “Jazz Chorus” recall the spartan intensity of Big Black. At 24 songs—most clocking in under two minutes—Hit to Hit is an unfiltered product, one that prioritizes absurdity and experimentation over consistency. It takes a bet on jingles as a creative mode (sometimes quite literally, as on the sugary-sweet “Sunkist”), and these songs are most fleshed out in that precise context—peppy, self-contained, practically built to be cheeky filler on a crush’s mixtape. Hit to Hit’s final quarter, which the band recorded as an ensemble, takes a more grounded approach. But after a record of instant gratification, these gentler tracks have a tendency to melt together. “Flavor of the Week” and “Summer of Your Dreams” is built on open chords and romantic pining, but fails to grow into more than circuitous, sleepy strumming. It’s not that they’re poorly constructed—Gill’s soft crooning is a charming accompaniment to the subdued acoustic guitar. But in a world as whimsical as 2nd Grade’s, it’s hard not to wish for Gill’s camp counselor enthusiasm to stick around a little longer.","The Philly indie pop band’s second album keeps things hooky and whimsical across 24 tracks of mostly light fare and dynamic songwriting.

The Volume of Things,Bryde,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed579ad9bcc962f72cc0b5b/1:1/w_160/The%20Volume%20of%20Things_Bryde.jpg,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bryde-the-volume-of-things/,Easy Life,"This is not the first time Sarah Howells has been on the brink of larger success with a smartly written, well-arranged pop record. The Volume of Things, her second album as Bryde, is the latest in a line of projects stretching back to the early 2000s, all constantly on the verge of stardom before a change in course feels necessary. Her previous band, Paper Aeroplanes, released the kind of friendly, folksy records that rarely find critical acclaim or commercial success, but manage to develop a modest fanbase anyway via niche folk blogs and rotation on BBC’s adult contemporary station Radio 2 next to Bear’s Den and Billie Marten. The praise still came with caveats like “old-fashioned” and “hardly in vogue”. Howells’ work in Bryde was darker, culminating in the moody breakup album Like An Island in 2018. Bryde. But The Volume of Things once again embraces the sweetness of her Paper Aeroplanes work. It feels smaller, but the lower stakes fit an album about finding peace of mind amid sensory overload. It’s not a groundbreaking album (this is a record that rhymes “fire” with “desire” within its first 30 seconds, then does it again several songs later), but on an album that feels designed to be accessible, that’s the point. The best lyrics on the record narrow the scope to a search for connection, viewing love as a way to be unburdened: “Another Word for Free” repeats, “Would you be the weight off my shoulders?” while on “Paper Cups,” Howells wants to “Sip on your sympathy” to free herself. The words are about feeling free, but the music is restrained and straightforward. Thomas Mitchener’s production rarely involves more than a basic band setup, and even when the occasional synth makes an appearance it’s more often the focal point of a song than window dressing. By design, the album rarely gets too ambitious, but the songwriting is strong enough to make every moment distinct. The best hint at something denser; lead single “The Trouble Is” follows its chorus with a wordless, dreamy collection of “heyayayayayahs.” “Handing it Over,” the lone song helmed by Teenage Fanclub and Mogwai engineer Paul Savage, is a glimpse of something bigger. Having an edge is largely unnecessary on an album like this, but the album could take some risks. The arrangement for “Outsiders” feels like it’s working through a checklist for Haunting Indie Ballad instead of building with the song’s love story. When a song like “Flies” actually aims for a dramatic crescendo, the brightness of the production mutes the impact. For better or worse, anything more dramatic would ruin the album’s aesthetic; the closer is a “Blue Bucket of Gold”-style ballad without the discomfiting ambience of Sufjan’s music, yet “discomfiting” was never the intention. There’s barely space for albums with modest ambitions like The Volume of Things anymore, given the actual volume of music currently available. Pop-rock like this doesn’t have the same success it did even a few years ago when someone like Ingrid Michaelson crossed over to the Hot 100. It’s accessible, but for a market that may not exist beyond the same stomping grounds as Paper Aeroplanes, barring a Spotify playlist or two. In a crowded industry, being well-written and smart isn’t enough to stand out, even if ideally it should be. Especially right now, it’s difficult for even relatively successful bands to make music full time, so if there was any leeway for Halflight in 2004 or Paper Aeroplanes in 2010, there’s almost none for Bryde in 2020. But there should be an avenue for albums like this to be successful—an unstable industry has made a record this unshowy difficult to make, but if one person connects, Howells has accomplished her mission.","Sarah Howells’ latest project is simple and sweet; its lower stakes fit an album about finding peace of mind amid sensory overload.

Future Teenage Cave Artists,Deerhoof,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd46fb1ed2d15ae8658233/1:1/w_160/Future%20Teenage%20Cave%20Artists_Deerhoof.jpg,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deerhoof-future-teenage-cave-artists/,Joyful Noise,"On Future Teenage Cave Artists, Deerhoof fantasize about a future that feels frighteningly real. Populations evacuate their homes for greener pastures. People and animals are murdered senselessly. Survival is a privilege, not an assumption. Amidst this chaos, a new generation of teenagers still discover and make art, experiencing feelings as old as time. From the first track, the world is fractured, brutal and basically over. Satomi Matsuzaki delivers the album’s opener, also its poppiest gesture, from the perspective of a hopeful, doomed adolescent: “Gonna paint an animal on a cave wall/Gonna leave it there forever while empires fall.” Greg Saunier’s snare-dense drumming is at its least busy, leaving space for listeners to share the teen’s excitement. Rapidly, the album fills up with dissonance and cluttered hooks, evoking a future in which humans are both overstimulated and denied the fulfillment of basic necessities. Matsuzaki’s one-liners are typically incisive (a few favorites: “Try my sci fi!” “Why would you kill my bambis?” “Cowboys were just a corporate invention”) and Saunier sings on a number of the tracks, his breathy, complementary voice never detracting from Matsuzaki’s singular, commanding persona. This might be Deerhoof’s first overt concept album, but in every other regard, it fits comfortably into their well-worn blueprint. John Dieterich and Ed Rodriguez write guitar melodies that are both gorgeous and guarded; Matsuzaki mangles and tweaks pop convention with dogged use of her upper vocal range. The lyrics occupy the same magically realistic, culturally wide-eyed space that the group has been exploring since it began in the 1990s. This formula could make Deerhoof seem like a machine too well-oiled to keep surprising us—even if the band loves to claim that they reinvent themselves with each album, a perception that seems more and more like a fallacy with each new release. True, the indie rock collective have taken detours within their expanded universe: they released an EP covering The Shining’s soundtrack, put out an excellent collaboration with the classical ensemble Dal Niente, and brought in Awkwafina to rap on their revivifying 2017 album Mountain Moves. But Deerhoof are committed to being a band, while somehow never seeming nostalgic or close-minded to the world outside of rock ‘n’ roll: their four-piece is like a nuclear family that stays together as the indie scene that birthed them falls apart. On the album’s cover, which Matsuzaki drew, a smartphone burns a kneeling teenager in the light of its camera. Appropriately, much of Future Teenage Cave Artists was recorded on laptops and phones, a tech-forward simplicity that reflects the album’s scrappy and cataclysmic milieu. It sounds less polished than their last couple of albums, but never as raw as their recently reissued early oeuvre. Future Teenage Cave Artists surprises us with a sudden shift at its very end, which also brings the implicit themes of apocalypse into relief. “Damaged Eyes Squinting into the Beautiful Overhot Sun” is the record’s peak, its dynamic sound built on Deiterich’s three-chord rhythm guitar part and Rodriguez’s ascending riff, which swells before the song stops abruptly, as though the sun just absorbed the earth. Listeners are left with a stark performance of a Bach choral prelude on solo piano. This conclusion raises a bunch of questions—what does it mean for an apocalyptic album to end with a prelude? Why does a narrative about the artistic awakening of juveniles terminate with a centuries-old work? Is there hope for music after the madness of human self-destruction? In Future Teenage Cave Artists’ hectic, crammed-to-the-brim structure, Johann Sebastian gives Deerhoof listeners something they have been methodically denied: space to process the music. We’re left contemplating how a rock band, 26 years into their career, have managed to not only pin down the chaos of our time, but also to point toward our uncertain future.","On their 15th album, the indie-rock institution goes apocalyptic with their first concept record.

Island,Owen Pallett,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ecd44eefcb5f329163e0b27/1:1/w_160/Island_Owen%20Pallett.jpg,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/owen-pallett-island/,Domino,"The unpredictable chord changes of Owen Pallett’s orchestral-pop arrangements give way beneath you like a pulled rug. Aching piano melodies dip in and out of brass and wind sections, turning just when you least expect to play up Pallett’s quietly sturdy voice. Over the past decade, the prolific Canadian composer has offered string arrangements to Frank Ocean, Fucked Up, and even Tim Burton, who recruited Pallett and longtime collaborators Arcade Fire to contribute to last year’s Dumbo remake. On their introspective solo albums, however, Pallett’s weaving arrangements propel dense, elliptical mythologies that unravel like fantasy novels. Their fifth album, Island, marks the return of Lewis, a “young, ultra-violent farmer” from the fictional 14th-century land of Spectrum, first introduced on 2010’s Heartland. That album’s deeply meta theological crisis centered on Lewis’ rage at a god named Owen Pallett, culminating in a bloody battle that seemingly vanquished Owen the deity for good. The gloomy world of Island picks up directly afterward: Owen is gone for now, and Lewis has washed ashore alone, enduring a grim journey of self-reflection during Pallett’s most delicately scaled-back work yet. Heartland couched Lewis’ monologues in baroque, off-kilter pop songs that burst with life; Island is far more downcast and restrained. Pallett envisioned the album as a suite of orchestral music, recruiting lush accompaniment from the London Contemporary Orchestra to bear out the idea. The first half of the album offers murmurs of the orchestra’s full weight, with sepulchral suspended piano notes and spare acoustic guitar gently forewarning of tragedy to come. The slowed-down pace allows Pallett to lean into the folk inclinations of their early-2000s group Les Mouches, creating bounding fingerpicked guitar lines on songs like “Transformer” and “Fire-Mare” that give Lewis’ story an earthiness to match his new life as a cigarette-smoking, booze-swilling misfit. Through the Lewis avatar, Pallett explores questions of life, death, and faith while remaining oblique. It makes for a bizarre game of interpretation, one Pallett invites both by casting themself as the omniscient creator of Spectrum and through straightforwardly vulnerable lines that recall 2014’s troubled In Conflict. As Island’s story spirals, depressive lyrics bleed through the narrative dressing. “I am a wound un-healing,” they sing in an airy upper register on “The Sound of the Engines,” when Lewis gets into a fight and wakes up in an ambulance. Album centerpiece “A Bloody Morning” depicts Lewis drunkenly crashing a sailing ship with the frank admission, “I’ve mistaken self-indulgence for self-care.” Crashing cymbals and pummeling timpani recreate the waves, while Greg Fox’s insistent drumming forms a frantic heartbeat as passengers tumble overboard. The chaotic, terrifying scene is one of Pallett’s most heart-rending, painting out Island’s narrative climax in vivid colors. The album climaxes with “Lewis Gets Fucked Into Space,” where Lewis senses the deity Owen’s presence once again in an erotic mind-meld of the two characters. The song is a self-reckoning, ascending on tapping percussion, fanfare, and celestial strings. “I wonder who will sing of me when I am gone?” Pallett mourns, guiding Lewis to an astral sense of clarity. The album’s cinematic ending takes stock of devastation, from Lewis’ egotistical mission on Heartland to the literal wreckage of Island. “Let me be your confessor/Lay your burdens down on me,” Pallett lilts on closer “In Darkness,” a sweep of elegiac strings drifting in behind him. “You don’t need to die to be forgiven.” These small, fastidious details add up to a tapestry that feels deeply lived-in, even if Island often lists toward the subdued or dreary. Much the album moves so subtly that the songs at times feel interchangeable, rewarding multiple revisits rather than a casual listen. But as intentionally dark and foreboding as Island can be, it gives Pallett room to breathe, clearing away the violin and piano loops that gilded In Conflict and Heartland to bring world-weary questions into focus. Its languid, ruminative pace is the time required to reveal a glimmer of hope through the gloom.","With assistance from the London Contemporary Orchestra, the prolific Canadian composer’s arrangements propel dense, elliptical mythologies that unravel like fantasy novels.

Pop Music / False B​-​Sides II,Baths,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e8dcd811a3ea30008764efd/1:1/w_160/Baths.png,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baths-pop-music-false-b-sides-ii/,self-released,"When Will Wiesenfeld released his first Pop Music/False B-Sides collection in 2011, the two halves of its title seemed to cancel each other out. He hadn’t released any actual Baths singles, for starters, and the songs, which came from the sessions that birthed his remarkable debut Cerulean, certainly didn’t feel like lesser offerings. But the word “pop” hinted at ambitions outside the Los Angeles beatmakers' community that had been Baths’ home up to that point. The ensuing years haven’t dimmed Wiesenfeld’s enthusiasm for percussive arrhythmia, but pure songcraft has slowly taken priority in his work. By 2017, his ear for hooks had grown so sharp that he could literally write a theme song (for a “dad dating simulator,” natch) and it didn’t feel all that out of character. Now, as Baths ushers in its second decade, the title of Pop Music/False B-Sides II comes to feel oddly appropriate: it’s an assemblage of scattered instrumentals turned into pop songs might as well pass for the actual fourth Baths album. The coherence of Pop Music/False B-Sides II is all the more remarkable given how it draws from a much deeper hard drive than its predecessor. The source material dates as far back as 2013, some of it initially intended for Baths, others for Wiesenfeld’s ambient-leaning Geotic project. Wiesenfeld only recently added lyrics to these “renewed ideas and sketches,” and so without any kind of chronological ordering or thematic ties to serve as clues to their origins, Pop Music/False B-Sides II functions as a sort of alternate-history glimpse into his evolution. The metallic undertow of “Veranda Shove” suggests a timestamp around 2013’s Obsidian, as does the oblong lurch and silvery, filtered percussion on “Be That” and “Sex.” If so, Wiesenfeld is revisiting them in a much healthier place, eschewing Obsidian’s graphic accounts of body horror and romantic dysfunction for tempered sensuality. The propulsive skittering of “Tropic Laurel” (an ostensible update of 2011’s “Nordic Laurel”) and “Immerse” are cast in the image of Romaplasm’s RPG fantasias and reframed as something more immediate and emotionally legible. “Wistful (Fata Morgana)” scales the IMAX-scoped “Ocean Death” down into a portrait of seaside longing, and the handful of instrumentals cast Geotic’s increasing path towards sylvan dream-pop converging with that of Baths. Pop Music/False B-Sides also presents a case for Baths’ role in the greater trajectory of what used to be called “lap-pop.” There are still hints of Cerulean’s formative influences—the dreamy IDM of Dntel, Four Tet’s early folktronica phase, Fennesz at his friendliest, the lopsided bump and grind of Donuts. But Baths has existed long enough to influence on others, honing qualities that have become immediately identifiable: The acoustic guitars or keyboards processed to sound like player pianos, Wiesenfeld’s telltale usage of ripe verbiage like “anoint,” “evergreen,” “appendices.”  Even at his most pop-focused, Wiesenfeld continues to work outside of a percussive grid, mimicking the occasional grace of human movement, at other times, its more common gangly gait; in the case “Be That,” the ex post facto songwriting process shows its limitations, as Wiesenfeld can’t keep pace with its cumbersome, staggering cadences. “Be That” is immediately followed by “The Stones,” the lengthiest and warmest Baths song to date—“I still trust that men can be lovely/do what you like but do it to me,” Wiesenfeld sings on the final line, a sentiment that feels accessed after years of struggle. A pity that Pop Music/False B-Sides II waits until its final two songs to start trying new things, as what precedes it piles onto Baths’ existing catalog rather than exploring new depths or vistas. It’s a testament to Wiesenfeld’s artistry that the difference between the “almosts” featured here and his most beloved songs isn’t always immediately perceptible, but on a “heads only” type of release, it might be more revelatory to hear the ideas that were too outre for a Baths album; does he have another “Dream Daddy” lying around? But it’s worth noting that on the same day Wiesenfeld released Pop Music/False B-Sides II as the inaugural title on his new label Basement’s Basement, he reissued the first collection as well—before Wiesenfeld embarks on a new beginning, he wanted to show us how far he’s come.","Will Wiesenfeld’s second collection of odds and ends revamps old sketches with new lyrics, revealing a deepening interest in pop songcraft.

"Pacific Breeze 2: Japanese City Pop, AOR & Boogie 1972-1986",Various Artists,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ec55b9a91dbebb858d7e78e/1:1/w_160/Japanese%20City%20Pop,%20AOR%20&%20Boogie%201972-1986_Pacific%20Breeze%202.jpg",2020-06-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pacific-breeze-2-japanese-city-pop-aor-and-boogie-1972-1986/,Light in the Attic,"There’s no greater comeback story in recent reissue culture than Japanese city pop. About a decade ago, Blogspot blogs and Japanese reissues introduced music nerds to a strain of AOR, funk, disco, and yacht rock trafficked under the amorphous term, a vague descriptor for Japanese music that incorporated jazz and R&B, reflecting city life and consumerism amid the 1970s’ economic upswing until the bubble burst in 1992. The music had largely been neglected by Westerners and derided by many Japanese as cheesy, but as YouTube algorithms launched songs into the wider collective consciousness, city pop surged in popularity; nothing was as emblematic of its second wind as a music video popping up for Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plastic Love” 35 years after release. Light in the Attic’s first volume of their Pacific Breeze series felt like a culmination of all the hubbub. At last, uninitiated listeners could dive into a compilation featuring songs from big-name artists like Taeko Ohnuki, Hiroshi Sato, and Yellow Magic Orchestra’s Haruomi Hosono. Pacific Breeze Volume 2: Japanese City Pop, AOR & Boogie 1972-1986 nobly continues documenting this time period, but it isn’t consistent in highlighting the finest from the era—or offering any real discoveries for those with a cursory familiarity with the music. Pacific Breeze 2 opens with “Pink Shadow,” one of the most electrifying tunes from duo Bread & Butter’s middling discography. Its syncopated funk-lite grooves are at once tight and loose, thanks to the session crew known as Tin Pan Alley, whose other work—such as on Ayumi Ishida’s Our Connection—also feels like it’s bursting with joy. Also notable is Tomoko Aran’s “I’m in Love,” whose sly hi-hats and bass glide into a chorus in which Aran coos the titular line, her voice like a spray of rose-scented perfume. Best of all is “Rainy Saturday & Coffee Break,” which ambles along in effortless fashion as Junko Ohashi delivers a strikingly clear and crisp vocal performance. Kyoko Furuya’s moody “Harumifuotou” is an addictive bare-bones pop-rock song, but its spacious production and distinct mixing feel out of place alongside the following track, the hyperslick jazz-fusion instrumental “Bay/Sky Provincetown 1977.” It’s a noticeable miscalculation, but more frustrating is the fact that “Harumifuotou” was previously reissued in 2017; it feels superfluous. Anri’s “Last Summer Whisper” is another standout; it was written by Toshiki Kadomatsu, who has a real penchant for sticky-sweet basslines that allow the rest of the song to breathe, granting Anri’s vocals a tender dreaminess. But it’s also one of her most famous songs, sampled in popular tracks from both Korea and America; hardly a rarity, it feels like low-hanging fruit. The most disappointing aspect of both Pacific Breeze compilations is the absence of the best city pop artists. Some of these were mentioned in a feature for The FADER by Mark “Frosty” McNeill and Andy Cabic, two of Pacific Breeze 2’s three curators. While billed as a list of “hard-to-find” tracks, the more precise term would likely be “hard-to-license.” The aforementioned Kadomatsu, as well as Tatsuro Yamashita, are the most impressive songwriters and vocalists of their generation, and they’re not found on either compilation (nor Japanese ones released in 2003). These absences are glaring, leaving a gaping hole in any understanding of city pop as a whole; curious listeners would be better off cycling through city pop mixes on YouTube that don’t omit them. The carefree bliss Pacific Breeze 2 certainly lives up to its title: Listening to these tracks, it’s easy to imagine yourself at the beach or driving around in the summer, windows down. It’s a good collection of songs that capture much of city pop’s charm. Still, it’s hard not to feel like the compilation does a disservice to the genre: It feels incomplete in scope and features lesser songs from many of its artists, such as those from Yumi Murata and Piper. It feels nice to soak in Pacific Breeze 2’s soft, innocuous pop music. Just don’t expect it to represent the luxury and excess that top-shelf city pop did.","Light in the Attic’s latest foray into Japanese easy-listening pop has plenty of summery charm, but it offers few discoveries for those already familiar with the genre.

Chromatica,Lady Gaga,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed02c881628a7bc78de1a7c/1:1/w_160/Chromatica_Lady%20Gaga.jpg,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lady-gaga-chromatica/,Interscope,"Lady Gaga has canceled Earth. She lives on planet Chromatica now. Yes, this is Stefani Germanotta’s return to all that is Lady Gaga: bizarre and theatrical and ambitious, swathed in electrodes, operating with a ga-ga-galaxy brain, delivering dance bangers for us canceled Earthlings. Chromatica is her first pop-pop album since 2011; unlike the non-“Why Did You Do That?” parts of the A Star is Born soundtrack and the beige acoustica of 2016’s Joanne, there’s not a ballad to be found. Specifically, according to Gaga lore, “Chromatica” is some kind of far-flung pink-prism Mad Max planet where “ballads are illegal.” Who doesn’t love world-building? But while Chromatica is a return to Gaga’s dance-pop days, that doesn’t mean quite the same thing now. It’s been 12 years since her debut album The Fame, released when “EDM” was just corporate jargon and “dance” meant stompy electroclash. In 2020, a Lady Gaga dance album comes out as an unabashed revival of ’90s house music. But if anyone’s earned a trip to the house, it’s Lady Gaga, who is among the few big pop stars today who can legitimately be called a diva. When Gaga sings, she sings out: not chill, not Idol-pretty, but unafraid to go there, whether there be throaty rasps or sotto-voice commands or feral desperation. It’s why her hard-rock dalliances largely worked, and why Chromatica feels more substantial than other artists’ throwaway dance turns. So much nu-house is producer-driven, its vocalists reduced to decorations if even credited; there is no risk of this with Gaga. Everything here would be unmistakably her even if self-reference didn’t abound. Lead single “Stupid Love” salvages the juddering sequencer of “Do What U Want,” kicks up the speed, and weaves Gaga’s past lead singles around it like Maypole streamers: the oncoming-juggernaut heft of “Bad Romance,” the melodic contour of “Born This Way,” the conceit of “Applause.” The other line about Chromatica is that it’s Gaga’s most personal album. You may recall that Joanne was also called Gaga’s “most personal album.” That time, it was “personal” in the same way all pop stars’ unplugged albums get called that: the arrangements had acoustic guitar, and the AutoTune was kept to a tasteful touch-up. Chromatica loses the guitars but certainly handles heavy subject matter: PTSD triggers, antipsychotic meds, sexual assault. In fact, most of Lady Gaga’s music since The Fame has been very personal. For every shiny, poppy song like “Telephone” or “Hair,” Gaga’s recorded three more with wounds at the core: the personified fears of The Fame, the parts of Born This Way that are more darkwave or Warcraft than bubblegum; the bitter mess of 2013’s Artpop. Themes recur: fragmented identity, soldiers to emptiness, drinking tears, dying a little when being touched. The art is often messy, the specific mess of art written from trauma. Even when Gaga dons freaky costumes or writes high-concept songs about Judas or swine, the artifice cracks. It’s why her albums hold up surprisingly well. It’s telling which Gaga moments have resurfaced from the early 2010s into current cultural memory: the deadpan, panting intro to “Monster,” or the sludgy-gothy “Bloody Mary,” which TikTok made even sludgier and gothier. Chromatica reverses this effect. This is house music at its most shiny and immaculate, a genre made from ache and escapism, high strings and numbing throbs. But Gaga’s lyrics are plainspoken, mostly free of religious metaphors and pretense; of the two high-concept songs on Chromatica, one is deliberately silly (“Babylon”) and the other (“Alice”) immediately yanks the metaphor back into reality: The first words are “my name isn’t Alice” and the song is inhabited not with white rabbits but the more terrifying creatures inside one’s mind. The emergency in “911” refers to olanzapine, a fast-acting antipsychotic that Gaga says saved her life. The track begins with a cold, stark beat, her vocals affectless and vocoded. The whole thing sounds off, and when the sweet, singsong chorus arrives, it just sounds off even more. The counterpoint never quite resolves with the melody, and the most painful lines (“Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships”) are tossed off, almost missable. But these are wonderful details, ones you can dance through now, then catch later. For all Gaga’s emphasis on Chromatica being an album meant to be heard start-to-finish with no skips, the sequencing is a bit off. The string interludes, composed with Morgan Kibby (M83, White Sea), separate the albums into three acts, each with its own filler. The climactic redemption of Ariana Grande collab “Rain On Me” comes about ten tracks too early, and “Free Woman” and “Fun Tonight” lose energy so close together. In act two, “Plastic Doll”—the basic idea of which you can guess just by reading the title—would have been too on-the-nose on The Fame. “Sour Candy,” the break-the-internet collaboration with K-pop superstars BLACKPINK, is sassy enough, but on a Lady Gaga album, and particularly this album, it feels out of place. That’s partly because there’s no Gaga until over a minute in, partly because we’ve literally heard it before: “Sour Candy” is at least the fourth pop song built on a sample of Maya Jane Coles’ “What They Say.” Then there’s the unavoidable fact that Chromatica is an album explicitly made for big communal dancefloors, released just before Pride month, a big celebratory mood, in a year when none of those things quite exist like they used to. Chromatica’s two strongest tracks are near-total opposites. Imagine an axis from bizarro transcendence to pure transcendence; “Sine From Above” is all the way at the left. Each individual part of it makes sense, kind of. Lady Gaga and Elton John? Sure; they’re godfamily, after all, and he’s a livelier duet partner than Tony Bennett or Bradley Cooper. Elton John with two-thirds of Swedish House Mafia? That was the idea, back in 2013. An ode to a literal sine wave, dropping decibels from the heavens? If anyone would write that, it’d be Gaga. Attacking that theme with zero-irony gusto that Eurovision would co-sign, going for it and never looking back? Chopping everything up for a drum-and-bass tangent at the end? To borrow the theater-kid saying, it’s big and wrong—yet so big, it’s hard to call it wrong at all. If “Sine From Above” runs on WTF, “Enigma” runs on familiarity: Every musical and emotional beat arrives precisely on cue, as if the club had muscle memory. It’s massive, it has a gravitational pull. Uncoincidentally, the chorus recalls a certain other song about being heroic lovers, just for one night. It slots right into Gaga canon: Enigma is the name of her recent Vegas residency, and the snippets of sax that crest above the choruses recall the late E Street Band member Clarence Clemons on Born This Way. And, crucially, it nails the desire of meeting someone in all its urgency. On planet Chromatica, “Enigma” is otherworldly: the atmospheres light up violet, dragon’s eyes and phantoms abounding. It’s the same drive that’s powered dance music, from disco to house to Gaga—turning a moment heightened, more fantastic, and, even at its most strobe-lit and artificial, somehow entirely human.","With incomparable flair, the pop diva returns to her dance-pop days with a fabulously fun and deeply personal album that is at turns bizarre, theatrical, and ambitious.

Beginners,Christian Lee Hutson,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed02ea6eecba3592e7b14f6/1:1/w_160/Beginners_Christian%20Lee%20Hutson.jpg,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/christian-lee-hutson-beginners/,Anti-,"We’ll begin with the strangest song on the record: “Get the Old Band Back Together,” a jocular sing-a-long, replete with harmonica and hand claps, on a record otherwise composed of finger-picked dirges. “Let’s get the old band back together again!” Hutson sings, fronting a gleeful chorus. “Let’s get in the room and let the magic happen!” Though something very special does happen on this album, credit is due not to magic, but to Hutson’s extraordinarily talented ensemble. That’s Conor Oberst you hear on that harmonica, and Lucy Dacus and Meg Duffy in the mix, and Phoebe Bridgers at the boards. With friends like these, who needs sorcery? Christian Lee Hutson is presently best known for his collaborations with Bridgers, having co-written songs on both boygenius and Better Oblivion Community Center. Traces of his career prior to their link-up are scarce. He recorded two solo albums in the early 2010s, neither of which appears to be currently available on streaming services. In the absence of any earlier trajectory to trace, a few key questions—who this guy is, where the hell he came from, how he got so goddamn good at this—will have to go unanswered. Hutson does not seek to reinvent the wheel on “Beginners.” He offers nothing you’ve not heard before. Even his voice sounds familiar on first listen, a dead ringer in many places for the delicate timbre of Paul Simon. But Hutson’s particular variation on finger-picked folk is as refined and masterfully crafted as you’ll find anywhere. What distinguishes Beginners from any number of other, lesser albums are Hutson’s unflinching probes into human fallibility. On opener “Atheist,” Hutson shrugs at a Sunday School hymn: “It went like, ‘Angels watching over us, all our little lives’/I don’t know if I buy it, but it does sound kinda nice.” This moment sets the stage for a record which turns away from grand metaphysical questions and toward mundane manmade struggle. Whether he’s singing about outpatient rehabilitation (“Seven Lakes”), a hostile high school (“Northsiders”), or the deterioration of an intimate relationship (every other track, just about), Hutson’s focus remains the ways in which human beings can’t help but hurt one another. He’s even brave enough to cast himself as the scoundrel on a few tracks. On “Unforgivable,” when he dismisses a partner with, “I just can’t fucking do it anymore,” he slows and stresses the cruelest word, earning it like a television writer allotted only one per season. His delivery of the downright-malevolent “Keep You Down” is just as indelible. When he winces on the chorus’ high harmonies, it’s as though he feels the very pain his narrator inflicts. There is something refreshing in seeing a songwriter so mindful of his capacity for betrayal, and so effortfully working to fix the damage he’s done. “Lose This Number” is especially moving, the haughty fuck-off of its title phrase becoming a yearning plea for connection as he fondly reminisces with someone he once loved. “You don’t have to forgive me,” he sings. “Hell, you probably shouldn’t.” Hutson is at his very best when he’s not showing off. He occasionally rivals Hemingway for the amount of sheer devastation he can pack into six words. On “Talk,” taking a neglectful parent to task, he sings, “I was raised over the phone”—a damning indictment, no pretty poetry necessary. He stumbles only when he doesn’t give these moments room to breathe, as with the shocking climax of “Northsiders,” a gut-punch too quickly swallowed up by the song’s breezy schoolyard rhyme scheme. Some of his darlings, too, would be better off killed. “It’s like I was born on the back of a bullet/With your name written on it” is a lovely lyric, but out of place in the intimate late-night conversation of “Lose This Number.” This sort of adornment only distracts from the great strength of his simple language and imagery. Hutson’s musical style finds a perfect complement in Bridgers’ subtle production. She carefully seasons Hutson’s acoustic finger-picking with other instrumental layers—a tart keyboard line on “Twin Soul,” a crisp cymbal on “Lose This Number,” and buttery strings throughout—to bring out the flavor of his playing, but never overwhelm its delicacy. Another collaborator, Nathaniel Walcott of Bright Eyes, is responsible for the marvel of Beginners’ string arrangements. This record was made with friends in the room, and those friends were invariably extraordinarily talented. The starry group of back-up singers from “Get the Old Band Back Together” make a welcome return on the final number, “Single for the Summer.” There, they all repeat a single line—“It’s gonna happen any day now”—with an air of rebellious optimism and so much conviction you can’t help but believe them. We may not be guarded by angels, but human beings can make for a pretty fine choir in a pinch.","With the help of Phoebe Bridgers, Conor Oberst, and others, this career collaborator steps into the spotlight with a stunningly empathetic study of human frailties.
