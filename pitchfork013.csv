Courtcase 2000,Cats in Paris,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd55e6ef95969322f25/1:1/w_160/8177eae1.jpg,2008-09-12 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12186-courtcase-2000/,Akoustic Anarkhy,"Filing Cats in Paris into a nice, neat genre niche may prove difficult, but it's not hard noting they're another band coasting on the recent tidal wave of ADD-afflicted music. Like Architecture in Helsinki, Late of the Pier, and Evangelicals, Manchester's Cats in Paris believe the three-minute pop song belongs to the past and that 21st century music should bombard the senses with the same fury as pop-up ads and RSS readers. No surprise then that debut LP Courtcase 2000 is a labyrinth of an album, its sweet spots barely recouping the cost of having to invest a staggering amount of time listening and absorbing. Glam rock, electro, and twee feature most prominently on the band's palette, usually in that order. Most of these tracks open with pomp and circumstance, then ease into a smug synth groove before the guy/girl vocal tag team of Sara Beard and Michael Watson sweetens the deal with some start/stop melodies. Armed with a stockpile of instruments and space-age effects, the band pushes a brand of 1980s 8-bit nostalgia that's just weird enough to not sound overly trendy. Single ""Foxes"" is a rare exception-- its burping NES synths and kewl indie dance swagger totally vie for block party mixtape play alongside CSS and Crystal Castles-- but the track's focused structure serves as a nice changeup from the rest of Courtcase's choas. Luckily, the band more often sounds cute than hip. The chirpy harmonies on ""Castle Walls"" feel like Mates of State uploaded into Super Mario Bros., and the strings on ""Cold Products""-- even during the song's cacophonous freakouts-- wouldn't sound out of place on a Broken Social Scene cut. At times though, Watson's piercing howl can have the haunting effect of fellow screamers like the Evangelicals' Josh Jones or Kevin Barnes. Often bailing out some of the more nebulous freakout tracks, Watson's shriek dabbles in space glam pathos (""The Curse of Jonah Brian""), twitchy electro anxiety (""Loose Tooth Tactile""), and ethereal indie operatics (""Flame Throwers""), essentially stealing the spotlight from any track that allows his voice to shine. The problem, though, is that nearly every segment of every track sounds like it's trying to one-up its predecessor and get its shine. Even with long instrumental stretches and unpredictable segues, the album feels like one constant build and demolition after another, and that's just exhausting. Still, there's something to be said for a debut album that so vehemently defies conformity, even if it kinda cuts off its nose to spite its face in the process. If they never do become exceptional, this four-piece should always at least sound unique, and that'll earn you way more spins than the average indie rookie act.","Like Architecture in Helsinki, Late of the Pier, and Evangelicals, Manchester's Cats in Paris bombard the senses with the same fury as pop-up ads and RSS readers.

Mugiboogie,Mugison,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce013d197565213b3f9/1:1/w_160/71cde647.jpg,2008-09-12 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12195-mugiboogie/,Ipecac,"Icelandic musicians are at inherent disadvantage among Western pop performers, what with the isolation, high cost of living, and a small population that need only generate 5,000 sales for a gold record. But as native son Örn Elías Guðmundsson-- aka Mugison-- illustrates, the country does yield one benefit for aspiring artists: really awesome locations for press-photo shoots. In his promo pics, we see Mugison variously riding horses in mountainous terrain, casually laying down on ice caps, and canoeing through rocky waterways dressed as a fish trapper-- no boring brick-wall backgrounds for this guy. Based on these images alone, it's tempting to-- as we do with most Icelandic artists-- interpret Mugison's music as a product of his home country's mysterious landscape (try Googling ""Sigur Rós + glaciers"") or rich folkloric tradition (ditto for ""Björk + elf""). But on his madcap third album, Mugiboogie, the former laptop-tronic artist makes a case for an Icelandic pop music defined not by topography or mythology, but rather basic geography-- in that his country's location puts him a in a fortuitous position to absorb the influence of American blues, British psych-folk and, when the mood strikes, Scandinavian black metal. ""Every performer is a preacher,"" Mugison sings on the solo acoustic blues of Mugiboogie's ""The Pathetic Anthem"", but his performance style is more informed by the notion that every preacher is a performer. Like the Veils' Finn Andrews-- another artist whose recent output has betrayed a fascination with American Southern Baptist tradition-- Mugison is not so much interested in the religiosity of the pulpit as the theatrics, because, as one song puts it, ""Jesus is such a good name to moan."" But Mugison's vigorous showmanship-- effectively conjuring the writhing, sweaty-browed anguish of a man of the cloth who's been caught in a by-the-hour motel with his pants down-- isn't always enough to elevate his songs beyond genre exercises; strip away his lusty growls and squeals, and the glammed-up stomp of the title track and the shuffling folk-funk of ""To the Bone"" aren't that far removed from standard-issue bar-rock. Perhaps sensing a potential drift toward the middle of the road, Mugison spends the rest of Mugiboogie alternating between sharp rights and lefts, even going so far as to adopt a Cookie Monster growl on twin tribal-metal freak-outs ""I'm Alright"" and ""Two Thumb Sucking Son of a Boyo""-- both of which can be read as either the external manifestation of his preacher persona's inner demons, or just an easy way to endear himself to Ipecac boss Mike Patton. But he also reveals himself to be a Harry Nilsson-like pop maverick that, for all of Mugison's eager-to-please affectations, is ultimately his most naturally pleasing mode, as evinced by the falsettoed broom-swept barfly blues of ""The Animal"" or the glockenspieled lullaby ""George Harrison"", a heartfelt appeal to live by the late Beatle's example, complete with gently weeping guitar slides. However, it's the centerpiece orchestro-folk ballad ""Deep Breathing"" that truly rewards your humoring Mugison's various whims: it's a plea for patience that feels like an interior address to the singer's own scatterbrained psyche, his pulse calmed by a wondrous string arrangement that sends the song heavenward without overwhelming it-- proof that Mugison need not act like a preacher to make you a believer.","On his madcap third album, Mugiboogie, the former laptop-tronic artist makes a case for an Icelandic pop music defined not by topography or mythology, but rather basic geography-- in that his country's location puts him in a fortuitous position to absorb the influence of American blues, British psych-folk and, when the mood strikes, Scandinavian black metal.

Fabric 41,Luciano,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd1ea9e61561daa7578/1:1/w_160/e2145d0f.jpg,2008-09-12 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12181-fabric-41/,Fabric,"As a DJ, producer, and head of one of the most interesting electronic music labels around, Luciano has fashioned himself something of an ideal character for those of us who appreciate both cerebral rhythm studies and diva-decked house classics spun at just the right time. He's championed the former with some of the odd, starchy curios put out by his label, Cadenza, and he's advocated for the latter in closely monitored DJ sets-- many of which flit through the file-trade ether-- that sound ready to argue that the right time for diva-decked house classics is, more or less, all the time. Luciano is an ideal choice for a Fabric mix, then, especially at a time when many have started to question where heady dance music might yet stand to wander in terms of style and approach. One realm that remains forever fertile is governed by manic, messy thrills, the kind that suggest vigorous manhandling but seem only to really happen by happy accident. That's the realm that Luciano nails on Fabric 41. Unlike Ricardo Villalobos' storied Fabric 36 from last year-- an impressive feat of self-possession that nonetheless lacked a certain something in measures of vitality-- Luciano's set beds down with thrills and lets the smart parts tumble out for the taking. The mix starts off seemingly in a holding pattern, with Rhadoo's ""Slagare"" loitering at the ready for something to click into it. That comes by way of an a cappella track in Spanish and then, quickly, a burst of bass and zone-out strobes in ""Yo Momo"" by D'Julz. None of the above is easy to isolate in a mixing method that's all about overlap: Indeed, Luciano is a master of interstitial mixes so kinetic that the tracks themselves seem to be eagerly listening in to figure out how exactly they might be meant to go together. A track by Los Updates takes a curious turn with singer Jorge González sighing an ambivalent tale of a club where bank tellers dance to the hits in an atmosphere that is ""no much fun,"" but Luciano's own remix of it also introduces Latin rhythmic accents that grow more hectic and humid as the set rolls on. From there it grows bigger and funkier, with gliding house by Alex Picone and warm bass by Johnny D, before taking a sort of breathless breather with M83's moody organ ode ""In Church"". It's not long before the celestial cedes to the earthy, however, in Inner City's ""Good Love"", a vocal-strewn track goosed-up with big splashing handclaps and miniaturist whirligig turns in another Luciano remix. They're the kind of casual but catalytic adornments that Luciano seems to add by just the simplest of whims, and they're shaken all over a Fabric mix that makes good on the idea of a mix-CD meaning something while answering its charge to do something, too.","A great DJ with Swiss/Chilean roots surveys what can happen when dance tracks start to listen to themselves.

The Rex the Dog Show,Rex the Dog,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce7ea9e61561daa75b8/1:1/w_160/cb1d7b59.jpg,2008-09-12 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12201-the-rex-the-dog-show/,Hundehaus,"There was a time when the relative anonymity of the DJ was seen as a detriment to electronic music at large. Indie and rock music had things like haircuts, tabloid-friendly internecine squabbles, and famous couples to grain-feed its addiction to the cult of personality; dance music didn't even have a stage. In the internet era, however, the rules of engagement are a little more elastic. Recent records from retiring bedroom musicians like Burial and Sally Shapiro have not only debunked the notion that a persona, or even a face, is a pre-cursor for success, they've upended the formula by making mystery an asset. In an environment where bios, blog updates, photos, live footage, firsthand tidbits, and friends-of-friends are as ordinary as pennies, a little bit of riddle goes a long way. The riddle known as Rex the Dog began in 2004, when tracks credited to the artist were issued on Kompakt compilations and 12""s. First came ""Prototype"", a pulsing, bleeping, expertly crafted bit of electro that occasionally gave the appearance of folding in on itself, like origami. Then came the peeling synths and muscular rhythms of ""Frequency"", an arena-ready workout that made up for its garishness with infectious energy. Its B-side was even better: an auto-tuned ode to Eurocheese with French house flavors, the jokey and joyously poppy ""I Look Into Mid Air"" cemented the notion of Rex the Dog as a producer reveling in the tastelessness afforded by anonymity. The cat and mouse game was fun while it lasted, and for a few years, the rumor-mongering and online conjecture fed dutifully back into RtD's modest myth. Eventually, though, the secret proved too big for techno's incestuous, inbred scene to contain, or, evidently, for Rex to live up to; the more that clues and anecdotes pointed to producer Jake Williams (aka JX) as the culprit, the more Rex the Dog's output flagged. In 2007, RtD released a by-the-numbers remix of the Knife's ""Marble House"" that felt more like a lazy retread of old motifs. You could almost hear him circling the drain. And then, out of nowhere, comes this. Williams has since put the speculation to rest by formally coming out as Rex the Dog, but it's hard to tell if this full-length collection of early singles, remixes and new tracks is meant to close the door on his moniker or open it. While new tracks like the house-inflected ""Bubblicious"" (which gives prominent placing to an old Alison Moyet vocal from Yazoo's ""Midnight""), the synth-hit happy ""Gecko"", and the driving ""Circulate"" hint at the RtD of old, it's tough to shake the sense that this newer material is sheenier, more predictable, and less arch than it was in the Kompakt days. A cynic might suggest that this album is Williams' attempt to have it both ways by re-inventing RtD as a more populist DJ while simultaneously anthologizing his previous success, but nothing about The Rex the Dog Show feels quite so calculated. Instead, it feels like exactly what it is: a slipshod collection of songs constructed intermittently, in broad strokes, over a period of years. There's joy to be had here, but after such a compellingly assembled origin story, The Rex the Dog Show isn't quite the next chapter you want it to be.","Kompakt's former mystery man was responsible for an outstanding string of singles earlier this decade-- ""Frequency"" / ""I Look Into Mid Air"" and ""Prototype""-- but once the cloak of anonymity began to be lifted, the magic seemed to erode. Can Jake Williams regain it on his debut full-length?

7 Songs Belfast,Mark Kozelek,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdfc0084474cd0c2b9e/1:1/w_160/d9fbcfca.jpeg,2008-09-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12194-7-songs-belfast/,Caldo Verde,"Mark Kozelek's fans can't accuse him of holding out on them; whether with Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon, or under his own name, he keeps them supplied. His latest gift is 7 Songs Belfast, a quickie record documenting a solo acoustic performance. It's aimed squarely at fans-- it includes no new songs, and for a limited time the CD comes free if you order something else from his Caldo Verde website. It's also available as a digital download for four bucks. Kozelek's voice is a vehicle for ache-- his skillful acoustic guitar playing is almost besides the point as he unfurls those long, slow melodies. He's not a man of many tempos, preferring to keep it slow, but his sound is one you can luxuriate in all the same. Always fond of covers (twice devoting entire albums to the songs of another artist), here he reprises his version of John Denver's ""Around and Around"" from If You Want Blood and Rock 'n' Roll Singer alongside a half-dozen originals. Among the originals, four appeared on a previous small-edition live compilation, Nights, though in different versions. The three Sun Kil Moon selections differ most in this setting from the originals, which is natural as that's typically Kozelek's most rock-oriented project. ""Gentle Moon"" is especially lovely stripped to its bare essentials-- the hesitations in the melody stand out, and Kozelek must have been playing a spacious room, because the reverberation accentuates the loneliness of his delivery. Among the Red House Painters selections, ""River"" greatly benefits from paring back, in part because the Old Ramon version is a bit sludgy and plodding-- losing that weight makes the melody more nimble and immediately affecting. The highlight of the set is RHP's timeless ""San Geronimo"", where Kozelek's lines about lost memories of his youth pass like ghosts over his sharp fingerpicking. It's a microcosm of the larger album-- few can sing with more authority and still come off as ephemeral as Kozelek. Unsurprisingly then, this is a beautiful recording. It's no substitute for his best works-- Sun Kil Moon's Ghosts of the Great Highway or the Red House Painters' Ocean Beach are still the best Kozelek starting points-- but it nicely slots in next to his other records and is a must for his many devoted fans.","Quickly on the heels of his excellent Sun Kil Moon LP, April, Mark Kozelek issues another in his long series of small-edition releases, this time a handful of songs documenting a solo acoustic performance in the UK.

"Seven Lucky Plays, or How to Fix Songs for a Broken Heart",Ilya Monosov,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbeea9e61561daa7549/1:1/w_160/8c58bf4f.jpg,2008-09-11 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12164-seven-lucky-plays-or-how-to-fix-songs-for-a-broken-heart/,Language of StoneIlya Monosov,"Is it possible to take Ilya Monosov as seriously as he takes himself? Even before you scan the tracklist, let along ilsten to his new album, you are beset with that flamboyant title, Seven Lucky Plays, or How to Fix Songs for a Broken Heart, and a cover photograph that, minding the laws of MySpace self-portraiture, aches to lay bare this man's whole spirit. It truly is that unmediated. Call it brute-force sincerity. ""Tricycle"" lays out the plan, with a softly tickled guitar that immediately recalls the Espers-- no surprise, given that Espers' Greg Weeks not only runs Language of Stone, the forest-dwelling label putting out Seven Lucky Plays, but also recorded and played on this release. If only he picked up a pen. ""When I am in you/ I am reminded/ Of my tricycle,"" floats out as Monosov's nonsensical refrain, but it is the line ""I was busy chasing all the butterflies that captured all the color that I knew"" that nudges lethally close to Hallmark poetry. It's tough to pardon the sins perpetrated here as artifacts of bad translation: this would slight the mother language. Anyone can hear the rustic beauty in the arrangements, which pay respect to the Takoma fingerpicking masters among other earthy traditions, and Weeks is likely the man to thank. (At its moodier moments, the crossing of guitar and strings surprisingly bring to mind A Silver Mt. Zion, too.) But the aura is routinely punctured by Monosov's songwriting. A number of sleazily obvious lines (""I tried to taste your beauty"") could easily pop up in the banter of a late-night Cinemax feature. And Monosov's voice, a murmuring, flatter echo of Leonard Cohen's, only amplifies the unpoetic creepiness of the material. In past releases for Eclipse and Elevator Bath (2005's Architectures on Air and Other Works) Monosov styled himself a ""sound artist"" more at home among the white-walled galleries, with his highbrow play and brainy experiments, than the dustier trails of American folk. Seven Lucky Plays barely hints at this intellectually spunkier, if emotionally drier, past work. The press materials try. They boast that the songs here are based on 11 years of creative writing, saying that ""early exposure to Russian dissident culture greatly affected his life and art."" If the end product didn't resemble a page from a hipster rake's Moleskine, mumbled into a tavern's open mike, that boast wouldn't seem so grotesque to historians of Russian dissident culture. The upside to all this is that there's a new restraint in Monosov's music that listeners will welcome. It is tempting to credit Weeks for this welcome change of emphasis: a compositional shift toward subtlety. But if Monosov is going to keep singing, he should extend this sense of understatement to his own words, pencilling out, say, bodily tastes and erotically charged tricycles, and replacing them with bolder images and better metaphors. We all hope the maturity that marked his earlier work will eventually spill into his writing tablet. Otherwise, Monosov should revisit and revive his wordless sound-artist era.","With help from Espers' Greg Weeks-- who recorded and played on this album, as well as released it on his label-- sound artist Ilya Monosov trades white-walled galleries and highbrow experiments for the dustier trails of American folk.

Living on the Other Side,The Donkeys,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc0ea9e61561daa754d/1:1/w_160/b63d98e9.jpg,2008-09-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12165-living-on-the-other-side/,Dead Oceans,"Yes, the Donkeys are from Southern California. San Diego, to be precise. That much is clear just a few notes into their second album, Living on the Other Side, a sort of retro SoCal prospecting that yields mostly fool's gold. The Donkeys have suitably dusty harmonies, guitar licks homesteading in the Bakersfield exurbs, drumbeats that play close to the chest, and laconic tempos seemingly induced by lifestyle THC intake-- all of which recall a diverse range of past artists: the International Submarine Band, Sweetheart of the Rodeo-era Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and even Gram Parsons solo. Okay, there's a little Dead in there, and the singing drummer calls forth associations to a band whose name I've promised myself I would never type again. I only wish the Donkeys sounded more like Beachwood Sparks-- not necessarily in practice, but at least in spirit. Until about five or six years ago, that L.A. band panned this same musical river and found more than a few nuggets. Granted, living in this particular past meant something very different seven years ago than it does today. At the time, this desert was more or less deserted, so Beachwood Sparks came across as almost cultlike in their dedication, their stovepipe trousers and rodeo shirts the rock equivalent of white robes and sandals. However, the extent of their immersion seemed modern-- or at least a legitimate response to modern times-- which led them to treat their forebears a bit cavalierly. They covered Sade, for chrissakes. The Donkeys similarly party like it's 1969, but too often they sound more like historical re-enactors than an actual 2008 band. Living on the Other Side is impeccable, each element precisely and no doubt lovingly placed. Even the ""Yeah, baby!"" on ""Traverse Wine"" sounds well rehearsed. Shoot, the album is divided into two sides, like one of those old-timey LPs. Side One begins with ""Gone Gone Gone"", a studiously shambling number that features the same cactus-pointy guitar solo twice. But hey, it's the best idea in the song, so why not? ""Walk Through a Cloud"" and ""Dolphin Center"" sound precious, the latter saved by Jessie Gulati's nimble guitar solo, while ""Traverse Wine"" simply evaporates into the air. Fortunately, Side Two better showcases the band's chops and reveals a slightly more adventurous edge. ""Nice Train"" has some, well, nice ""Sleepwalking""-style guitars as singer/drummer Sam Sprague describes a harried night at a roadhouse. That the establishment in question is a hipster hangout rather than a Hells Angels bar is a pretty good joke, one that reminds you that Living isn't a reissue. Still, the effect is undone by the sitar and percussion on ""Dreamin'"". Not using bongos just isn't enough at this point. ""Boot on the Seat"" trots out their very own Emmylou Harris, although Mariah Dancing's voice nicely complements both Sprague's vocals and the wailing harmonica behind them. Worse, the vocals on closer ""Excelsior Lady"" verge on California cornpone, but Anthony Lukens salvages it somewhat with a simple, but endlessly effective, ascending-descending organ riff that actually makes a pleasant palette for the sleepy guitar licks. It's a nice flourish on an album with more than a few such moments, but they're not enough to make the Donkeys' nostalgia sound like more than a pose, or Living much more than dry and dull.","The Donkeys' second album, mining territory pioneered by the International Submarine Band, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers, becomes a sort of retro SoCal prospecting that yields mostly fool's gold.

Old Wounds,Young Widows,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc7abf31b7dc7155dd0/1:1/w_160/4aee6da9.jpg,2008-09-11 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12173-old-wounds/,Temporary Residence,"Young Widows' 2006 debut, Settle Down City, drew on a strand of early 1990s indie embodied by the Jesus Lizard and Melvins; sometimes they dragged out the payoff with their ominous grooves, and sometimes they milked the quiet-to-loud dynamic for all it was worth. It worked, and the follow-up Old Wounds doesn't fix what isn't broken. Ringing, distorted bass and some marble-mouthed threats from singer/guitarist Evan Patterson open the record, taking just a few bars too many without accompaniment to draw out the tension on the first track, ""Took a Turn"". When the guitar finally hits, it sounds miles away, like a powerless witness to a natural disaster. All of the elements contribute to one relentless, bludgeoning rhythm. ""Took a Turn"" segues artfully into the syncopated crunch and wild hammer-on riff of ""Old Skin"", fitting the album's most evocatively self-destructive lyrics (""She healed you with her fingernails, she healed you with her teeth"") into a track that is, again, single-minded and unwavering in rhythm and tone. Same goes for ""Mr. No Harm"", but Patterson's voice is more unhinged here, and the guitar manages a few textural stabs underneath the thundering din. The band's oppressive repetition is often hypnotic, and it must have sounded great in person, as the crowds on some of these tracks can attest-- four cuts were wholly recorded live, and much of the album was spliced together from various performances with the help of producer (and Converge guitarist) Kurt Ballou. The band continues to find its own voice, and Patterson finds a lower, more confident, and distinct vocal affectation than the wail that marked Settle Down City. But even if that record was more indebted to the band's forebears, Young Widows' first album was more dynamic, had more memorable riffs and hooks, and contained generally more surprises. Not that there isn't anything that sticks out here. There's more of the band's favored queasy guitar echo on the soft-yet-heavy thump of ""The Heat Is Here"", but the groove saunters, and its muffled, humid atmosphere and descending melody are almost sexy. The lyrics don't add much (""ride rollercoaster, rise""), but damned if the chorus isn't the catchiest moment of the disc; the crowd's clapping, lonely as it sounds here, is well-earned. The rhythm section works up a whirlwind on ""21st Century Invention"", the guitar follows in lockstep, shouted vocals punctuate the beat, and there's a muted skronk to diffuse tension and keep the listener on his toes. ""Delay Your Pressure"" is a perfunctory late-record uptempo track, though it does have a little cowbell and a stunning half-step finale. Final track ""Swamped and Agitated"" ends on some long-awaited fury, and while Old Wounds isn't much of a riff record, this track has a righteous one. Though it's been two years since Settle Down City, the methods on Old Wounds are commendable even if the results are mixed; more artists would do well to work fast and in front of crowd as often as possible. Better to lighten the weight of expectation than take so much time crafting ""statements"" and lose sight of what compels you as a band. Should Young Widows continue to record this way, the band still fills its niche as cannily as any of their nu-pigfuck peers, while clearly making an effort to push those sounds and ideas someplace more distinctive.","Still indebted to noisy early-1990s bands like the Jesus Lizard and Melvins, Louisville's Young Widows mix things up on their second album by splicing together new material recorded live and in the studio.

Knowle West Boy,Tricky,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcab5e6ef95969322ec5/1:1/w_160/7ff3b485.jpg,2008-09-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12148-knowle-west-boy/,Domino,"The popular theory about Tricky, in short, goes like this: first he was angry and moody all the time and released brilliant records, and then he got better and happier and started making fluffy low-substance garbage. I'll concur with the fact that his last two CDs, Blowback and Vulnerable, weren't all that good, but this ""happy Tricky = crappy Tricky"" equation is still too easy an explanation for what happened to the man who largely helped define the way anxiety sounded in the 1990s. Tricky may have had a rep for being a bit surly, but his music, even from the beginning, seemed less attributable to anger and misery than it was to ambivalence and confusion, and it all came through a malleable if unique identity. Which is understandable: He grew up in a ghetto, but a largely white one, his family came from a multitude of nationalities and ethnicities, and he's long cultivated a semi-androgynous (or at least anti-macho) persona that dates all the way back to his youth, when his grandmother dressed him in girls' clothing. But most of all, he's made it a point to toy with as many genres as possible without actually laying claim to any of them, channeling his lyrics through someone else's voice, and shedding labels as soon as the press can apply them. At best, this makes him a fascinating, unpredictable enigma; at worst, a rootless half-entity whose dick-around moments just so happen to have the weight of a fantastic early career attached to them. It's still not clear exactly where Knowle West Boy belongs on a scale between those two points-- all I can really say with what feigned authority one usually gets from a critic is that it's a Tricky album, though even that hasn't meant anything all that specific in who knows how long. Everything else about Knowle West Boy is just endlessly confounding: It's clearly better than the last two albums Tricky's put out since he decided to cheer up a bit and start feeling California, but it doesn't exactly come together in any tangible way. Granted, there's a couple moments on this album that feel deep and heartfelt-- expressing a lingering resentment at the psychological beatdowns of class warfare in ""Council Estate"" (""They call you can't-go-straight/ They call you crime rate"") or a longing regret at fathering a child he hasn't gotten the chance to connect with in ""School Gates"". But for all the mention in interviews and articles about how personal this album's supposed to be, many of the lyrics are evasive, at least when they're not flat-out empty. Maybe there's something embedded deep inside lines like ""I try to choose, my shadow moves/ But don't last in my hovercraft"" (""Far Away"") or ""You can go on to the internet, log in to your local war/ You can read your paper, receive a mental scar"" (""Coalition""), but as they are they don't say much of anything. Couple this with Tricky's held-back, restrained voice-- which sometimes sounds like he's trying to sing into his own armpit-- and there's not a lot of evocation to be found. His proxies fare a bit better, though there's another problem: There's way too many of them, and none of them stick around long enough to establish themselves. Tricky and Martina Topley-Bird were nigh on inseparable during his first few records, and his later work at least had a recognizable recurring voice aside from his own to carry much of a record's weight-- ragga singer Hawkman on Blowback, or breathy chanteuse Costanza Francavilla on Vulnerable. Knowle West Boy features a host of vocal collaborators, and while a couple of them might sound familiar-- Alex Mills spars wonderfully on the flirt-turned-squabble ""Puppy Toy"", while former GusGus member Hafdís Huld plays a hauntingly chirpy Christ stand-in on ""Cross to Bear""-- most of them are relative unknowns who sing passably but lack the strident personalities that, for better or worse, held each of the previous albums together. And even if the music itself is a lot more fleshed-out and smart than anything else he's done since the start of the decade-- genuinely hooky at some times, stripped bare and abrasive at others-- it doesn't quite cohere. To keep it simple, here's a brief rundown of the most identifiable genre signifiers in the first five tracks: leering lounge-blues (""Puppy Toy""), orchestral art-rock ragga (""Bacative""), semi-ambient, percussion-free neo-soul (""Joseph""), a stripped-down electro dirge (""Veronika""), and a big stoopid circa-XTRMNTR Primal Scream song (""C'mon Baby""). Little of it sticks to genre-bound conventions, but the pop-chameleon overload ends up feeling disorienting when it could've felt knowledgably eclectic. Still, seeing as how the bloated rock obviousness that torpedoed his other recent work has been scaled down to a more workable level, it's good to hear a wider range of ideas at play here. Once Tricky finds a way to tie it all together and remember how make it resound as strikingly as his own personality does, then we'll have something.","A clear improvement on his last two albums, the disappointing Blowback and Vulnerable, Tricky here tries to go personal with stabs at evocative lyrics alongside his genre-hopping sounds.

Carried to Dust,Calexico,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcca5e6ef95969322f05/1:1/w_160/4347928f.jpg,2008-09-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12175-carried-to-dust/,Quarterstick,"Being in Calexico is almost like attending a music school, where every record is another lesson on the way to a dissertation. Core members Joey Burns and John Convertino prepped in Giant Sand and Friends of Dean Martinez, and they've kept a busy schedule of extracurricular activities since, touring with Wilco and Iron & Wine and playing on dozens of other people's records. Their own albums have swerved all over the stylistic map while maintaining an essential sense of identity. The divergence in sound between their last two albums, 2003's Feast of Wire and 2006's Garden Ruin, basically predicts the shape of Carried to Dust-- Feast of Wire was the record where they tried everything and made it work; its follow-up was their basic rock album. While they're frequently thought of as stylists or synthesists, Calexico use their cross-genre amalgams to make music of emotional power and beauty, and this record has exceptional instances of both. ""Writer's Minor Holiday"" provides the beauty. Convertino's laid-back, jazzy drumming drives the track, freeing falsetto vocals and sparing dabs of steel guitar to serve as ghostly hooks and allowing the central melody to reveal itself slowly. Several of these songs are like that-- the primary vocal is so understated it defers to the instruments; to that end, string-soaked, waltz-time ballad ""The News About William"" works almost like a duet between Burns and Paul Niehaus' steel guitar. Multi-instrumentalist Jacob Valenzuela gets his first Calexico co-lead vocal here, sharing the mic with guest Amparo Sanchez on the Spanish-language ""Inspiración"", which has the album's boldest borderland horn part and a freaky underlying organ ostinato. Other guests include Jairo Zavala, who partners with Burns on the dark chorus of ""Victor Jara's Hands"", and Iron & Wine's Sam Beam, who lends his soft harmonies to the sensuous flamenco-dub slide of ""House of Valparaiso"". The album's final third is darker and harder, moving from the desert surf of ""El Gatillo (Trigger Revisited)"" to the sawing, mournful cello of ""Falling from Sleeves"" to the icy, spooky soundscape of closer ""Contention City"", a slow drift of electric piano, glockenspiel, and otherwordly steel guitar featuring Doug McCombs of Tortoise and Brokeback. Carried to Dust, therefore, is more in the band's usual Southwestern jazz/country/rock/tejano mold than their last, but it's not as diffuse or far-ranging as Feast of Wire. Ultimately, this is the type of record this band is suited to making, and it richly rewards repeat listening-- details and melodies that seem buried or understated eventually come to fore, slowly revealed in a mixture of organic warmth, welcome variety, and subtle complexity.","The latest from the wildly eclectic Calexico takes its cues from the group's two most recent records, the kitchen-sink aesthetic of 2003's Feast of Wire and the more basic rock-band approach of 2006's Garden Ruin.

Thought So...,Nightmares on Wax,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc6abf31b7dc7155dcc/1:1/w_160/e18e5beb.jpg,2008-09-10 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12172-thought-so/,Warp,"Signed to a nascent Warp Records two decades ago, George Evelyn's long-standing electronica project, Nightmares on Wax, was once heralded for its innovation. Quenching post-rave cultists' desire for unique sounds, the group's knack for fusing hip-hop breakbeats with low-end, brooding electro-- most notably on its ground-breaking ""Dextrous"" and ""Aftermath"" singles-- also helped draw the blueprint for downtempo, that oft-derided lifestyle accompaniement. But after losing key contributors Kevin Harper and Robin Taylor-Firth in the mid-nineties, Evelyn stalled creatively and has yet to effectively rebound. Conceived as a travelogue of sorts, Thought So... was written and (mostly) tracked during Evelyn's relocation from Leeds to Ibiza. Granted, it's a cool way to make a record, but Thought So... doesn't fully embody the anything-goes spirit of life on the road or thematically illustrate a transition from city existence to hedonistic island-dwelling, so this doesn't have much (if any) effect on the album's nature. For better or worse, Thought So... continues NoW's longstanding M.O.: Finding a functioning, funky groove and riding it, unaltered, for the duration of a track. Unlike the work of younger producers Flying Lotus or Switch, Evelyn's beats rarely mutate or change direction. Opener ""Da Feelin"" begins this routine; guest vocalists croon over a lethargic, jazzy hip-hop rhythm that merely runs in place. ""195 lbs"", a piece of echo-chamber dub, suffers from the same fate. Its capable Jamaican patois is wasted on a frustratingly resolute beat that loses steam a few minutes in. The record's clear standout is ""Moretime"", which announces a three-song suite that finally delivers on Evelyn's promise of expressive downtempo. Replete with crunchy electric guitars, heavy bass thwaps, and sweet R&B crooning, the updated Philly soul track is the first to actively engage the listener's emotions or intellect. ""Pretty Dark"", whose title aptly summarizes its ominous tone, is equally successful. Here, Evelyn slithers treated synths in and out of choppy guitars, arriving at an intoxicated haze sounding not unlike Mezzanine-era Massive Attack. Finally there's ""Hear in Colour"", the weakest of this triptych but superior to its aforementioned reggae counterpart, ""195 lbs"". Despite these late-album highlights, Thought So... is too relaxed, too stoned for its own good. Every song on the album is crafted with clinical meticulousness, its production clean as a whistle, but like a flawlessly constructed garment lacking in inventive design it ultimately falls short.","Now a loose collective of specialty players helmed by George Evelyn, Warp O.G.'s Nightmares on Wax return with an album recorded on the road from Leeds to Ibiza.

Helena Espvall & Masaki Batoh,Helena Espvall & Masaki Batoh,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc1ea9e61561daa7551/1:1/w_160/b52255ec.jpg,2008-09-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12167-helena-espvall-masaki-batoh/,Drag City,"It would be too reductive to strictly classify Japan's Masaki Batoh and Swedish-born Helena Espvall as folk musicians. Batoh, of course, is best known for his 20-plus years as leader of the avant-rock mystics in Ghost, whose work has ranged from free noise to the hairiest of prog-rock; while Espvall is a classically trained cellist and member of Espers who has also played with such diverse artists as Eugene Chadbourne and Pauline Oliveros. Yet for their first collaboration as a duo, Batoh and Espvall clearly strive to find a common vocabulary, and do so primarily within the familiar comforts of folk-based material. On Helena Espvall & Masaki Batoh, the duo have plotted an unlikely hybrid, gathering songs and instruments from a number of regional folk traditions. Five of the album's dozen tracks are interpretations of traditional Scandinavian songs, and Batoh also leads an abrupt detour to the Mississippi delta for a cover of Son House's ""Death Letter"". Despite the far-flung origins of the songs, however, there is a cozy sense of fellowship in these performances, as the two musicians sound almost effortlessly at ease with each other and their material. (Although in characteristic fashion Batoh does occasionally entangle himself while navigating the foreign tongues of the Swedish and English lyrics.) If anything, Batoh and Espvall can in fact sound as though they are perhaps too deferential to one another, as neither seems eager to force the proceedings outside a certain comfort zone. As a result, the album-- while it might be end-to-end the frankly prettiest record in Batoh's career-- contains nothing that should startle listeners familiar with either the work of Ghost or Espers. On the traditional Swedish songs ""Kristallen Den Fina"" and ""Uti Vår Hage"", the duo play it about as straight as any two such intercontinental adventurers ever could. For these tracks, and on the bulk of the album, Espvall takes lead vocal duty, with Batoh contributing deft harmonies and accompaniment on guitar and variety of exotics. From these traditional pieces, Batoh and Espvall cover the short distance to the original instrumental ""Beneath Halo"" and their lovely rendition of the anonymous medieval composition ""Bicinium"". Combining Espvall's expressive cello and banjo with Batoh's guitar--and just his general ineffable mystical presence--these pieces drift through the room like miniature violet clouds, ready to evaporate at the slightest brush. Espvall's vocals are double-tracked to delightful effect on ""Kling Klang"" and ""Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa"", further heightening the music's impression of ancient kindred spirits joined at play. Those seeking improvisational fireworks will have to make due with the epic album-closing instrumental ""Kyklopes"". Joined by Ghost members Takuyuki Moriya and Kazuo Ogino, on this track we at last catch a glimpse of Espvall and Batoh's more dissonant side. Here Espvall's cello provides a melancholic thunder and churn beneath Batoh's considered interjections of string and fluttering percussion, calling to mind the image of voyagers finally ready to steer themselves together into uncertain waters. Throughout the album Batoh and Espvall are able to cast hints of some distant unified global folk lineage, and hopefully their partnership can continue in some form to reveal and expand upon this shared ancestry's further secrets.","Members of Ghost and Espers plot an unlikely hybrid, gathering songs and instruments from a number of regional folk traditions on this Drag City release.

proVISIONS,Giant Sand,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc2c0084474cd0c2b61/1:1/w_160/ef8a1e0f.jpg,2008-09-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12168-provisions/,Yep Roc,"For over two decades, Howe Gelb has worked doggedly and double-time to make it all but impossible to get a good bead on him. In fact, while any number of prominent musicians and artists have joined his orbit, it's still unclear what musical planet Gelb lives on. So goes life in the Arizona desert, where Gelb, both solo and with his ongoing band Giant Sand, has endeavored to make the dust you blow off an LP every bit as important as the music itself. Why an album is credited as a solo record or the work of Giant Sand is something only Gelb knows, considering he's generally the lone constant in a revolving cast of characters. An all but impenetrable discography makes the situation that much more confusing. proVISIONS may be the first Giant Sand record since 2004's Is All Over the Map, but both have been part of a never-ending stream of Gelb-related releases. In 2006 Gelb released the great choir-graced 'Sno Angel Like You, last year he issued Upside Down Home 2007, and already in 2008 he's given us the third part of piano trilogy, Spun Some Piano. proVISIONS is simply another piece of a never-ending puzzle whose final shape remains as unknowable today as it did at the start. The ongoing success and evolution of Giant Sand spin-off Calexico may do Gelb no favors in comparison, but the guy clearly doesn't need any. For something as seemingly unfocused as Giant Sand, the band's been remarkably consistent, and proVISIONS is no exception, its array of peyote rock, twilight ballads, space cowboy soundtracks, and spooky sidetracks off the beaten path on par with the band's best work. Still, Gelb doesn't hedge his bets, studding the start of the disc with a string of conspicuous ringers, including appearances by Neko Case (""Without a Word""), Isobel Campbell (""Stranded Pearl""), and M. Ward, whose debut Duet for Guitars #2 was released by Gelb on his OW OM label (""Can Do""). Another track, ""The Desperate Kingdom of Love"", was written by pal Polly Jean Harvey. Gelb's no dummy. He knows these famous names will help newcomers pierce his self-adorned cloak of mystery. At the same time, Giant Sand's always been such an informal affair that he also knows that none of these friends will overshadow the music, which is comfortable hanging back in the shadows, anyway. It's there that you'll hear such touches as the return of the Voices of Praise Choir, veterans of 'Sno Angel Like You on ""Spiral"", or the occasional presence of singer Henriette Sennenvaldt of the somewhat obscure Danish band Under Byen. Gelb has called Giant Sand ""a mood,"" and that's sure true on cinematic songs such as ""Increment of Love"" and ""Pitch & Sway"". Later the loose funk of ""Muck Machine"", ""Saturated Beyond Repair"", and the stumbling, obliquely soulful ""Belly Full of Fire"" find Gelb more forceful and groove-oriented. The latter in particular showcases his unwavering gift for subverting his own strengths, disarming the hooky chorus with an off-kilter arrangement that doesn't sound like it could ever be replicated exactly as is. It's there in the words, too, where Gelb's lyrics hint at (or overtly reference) Bob Dylan at his most surreal or Tom Waits at his most perplexing, offering wisdom through weirdness and winking wordplay. ""Molecule, Molly is nobody's fool/ Comes from an excellent gene pool/ Happy little cells flippin' from her lip and/ Spend the night here screaming for the mother ship/ I ride along surfing on the waves of a lava hip,"" sings Gelb in ""Increment of Love"". Such inscrutability can be a real chore in the wrong hands, but with Gelb, getting lost has always been part of the fun. It's not about the destination. It's about the trip.","After a four-year wait, Giant Sand return with more Howe Gelb-orchestrated desert madness. PJ Harvey, M. Ward, Neko Case, and Isobell Campbell each make contributions to the record.

The New Year,Matt & Bubba Kadane,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccc5e6ef95969322f0c/1:1/w_160/fe036645.jpg,2008-09-10 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12177-the-new-year/,The New Year,"Change comes slow in the Kadane camp, but the latest album from brothers Matt and Bubba and their friends in the New Year shows some chances taken and a subtly expanded palette. After two records that quietly and resolutely plumbed desolation and depression, the songs from their self-titled third album hit on a surprisingly hopeful note-- but even that hope carries its own complications and shades of gray. Opener ""Folios"" builds from a simple acoustic strum in a lifting, almost yearning melody. It's buoyed by the barest scraps of organ before it opens into a clean, sparse three-guitar pluck, before Matt Kandane sings in his usual hushed tone: ""I don't think the good years I've got left can wait... so what are we stating for?"" Advance track ""The Company I Can Get"" shows off more of the relatively sunnier New Year, lurching in a familiar progression and swaying tentatively but determinedly, like couples at a grade-school dance. A few keyboards flutter impatiently behind its mostly lethargic pace, but it's a tempo that fits the tone: A guy in a car, tempted to drive off into the sunset, grudgingly realizes how much he needs others. ""X Off Days"" is downright surging in comparison. Kadane sings of planning a vacation without a whole lot of romance (""It's not like it's some kind of great escape/ When you only manage not to suffocate""), but a gorgeous ringing and layered guitar passage gives the listener all the air they need. ""The Door Opens"" is the record's real surprise, as off-time blurts of keyboard and a staccato single-note guitar line push things forward. Drums shuffle insistently without ever losing their cool, and those guitars lead into more abstract, textual territory as the rhythm pulses. Other curveballs on The New Year are quiet ballads like ""Wages of Sleep"", lead by a jaunty and drumless guitar pluck that preaches the healing properties of getting your eight to 10 hours; it's here that Kandane sings of ""a feeling that things may work out halfway all right"" in cautious monotone, as if that's all they would dare allow themselves. Another breath of relief comes in ""Seven Days and Seven Nights"", which patiently builds to a precise and lovely jangle. The gradual and hesitant payoffs of these songs give the feeling of standing on a precipice, while their brief but gorgeous outros are like looking out on a limitless horizon. The latter half of the record could have used more of these moments, as ballads ""Body and Soul"" and ""My Neighborhood"" drag on with minimal percussion. While the band is easing its vice-like restraint and begin to loosen up and rock out a little more earnestly (not unlike their former band Bedhead did on their third record, Transaction de Novo), what continues to set them apart is the way they put these pieces together, and how they use their average, everyman voices to demonstrate how complicated average struggles are. Up until now, they sang of desolation and addiction, but The New Year shows that hope can be just as hard-- maybe harder.","Former slowcore pioneers in Bedhead, Matt and Bubba Kadane and their New Year cohorts here craft the most hopeful-sounding record of their career-- these songs still have slow and reluctant payoffs but they now flirt with breaking into clean, jangly indie rock.

Sad Robots EP,Stars,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcce13d197565213b3d5/1:1/w_160/1cbb86fa.jpeg,2008-09-10 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12179-sad-robots-ep/,Arts & CraftsArts & Crafts,"The Sad Robots EP is currently a digital release, and not a hugely weighty one: There's an introductory track, there's a rather pristine live version of early Stars song ""Going, Going, Gone"", and there are four new songs, one of which isn't pretending to be much beyond a brief diversion. Still, it's convenient that Stars will have physical copies of this set to take along and sell during their fall tour. The music here burns slow and then smolders-- not unlike the piles of autumn leaves (under cold gray skies!) that dot the lyrics-- and it's easy to imagine this music serving, for a lot of concertgoers, as a wistful memento of That Cold Night We Saw Stars. That, after all, is exactly the role Stars want to play, if not in your life then in someone's: The band that makes the records you clutch to your chest like a prep-school misfit in a 1980s movie, the band that cuts out the construction-paper heart you wear on your sleeve. They make records that get down on their knees and beg to get quoted in someone's yearbook. That's a perfectly fine target, and I'm not sure I'd mind if more indie bands shot for it. (Teenagers should stare out their windows and cry, and if the right fog or snow or Stars song lets them imagine they're doing it someplace more magical than they are, then god bless fog and snow and Stars.) One of the things that can keep Stars from hitting this mark, though, is that their songs sometimes lack a real sense of ache, any real pull at the center of all their drama-- and what ache is in there sometimes feels rosy and nostalgic and knowing, like it's only a shorthand reference to aches from old Cure and Depeche Mode records. The great thing about the first 16 minutes of this insanely autumnal EP: They have the ache all over them. So maybe it's still a bit referential: The characters in the best song here, ""A Thread Cut with a Carving Knife"", slum around in depressed inaction, unable to break up, to follow through on suicide plans, to make the suicide plans in the first place. Torquil Campbell sings about one of them drinking herself to sleep with shoes still on, and they feel like textbook sketches in 80s haircuts. But between its slow pulse and burst-of-grandeur choruses, the song finds something real in there, and Amy Millan comes in with the yearbook quotes for a regal finish, some reassuring lilting about the fragility of life and the value of tomorrows. It's one of the band's best songs-- one of the best at getting the effect they usually seem to want. And since Sad Robots is nothing if not coherent, that's followed by another sedate and lovely pulse (""Undertow""), and that slips into a synth-washed version of ""Going, Going, Gone"" that's insanely affecting: glacial, womblike, full of lonesome shudders, and gorgeous enough that it takes a half-dozen listens to notice the copies of Disintegration the musicians are hiding behind their backs. The package would probably seem better if it ended on that choked-up high point, and lopped off the six minutes that follow. The title track is an agreeable enough two minutes, a folky, blocky diversion that tries to get a little too much mileage out of the interchangeable French verb for raining and crying (""Il pleut, il pleut/ Je pleur, je pleur""). But for the bulk of that time, a cheery trifle called ""14 Forever"" prompts a question Stars should probably prefer you don't ask-- whether they write these things on behalf of teenagers or whether they still earnestly want to be them. After some time with this EP, I'm no longer sure which of those suits them more-- whether they get this ache out better when they're trying to capture it from the outside, or recapture it from somewhere within.","An insanely autumnal EP, this digital-only release-- an introductory track, four new songs, and a live version of ""Going, Going, Gone""-- captures teenage ache in its slow pulse and burst-of-grandeur choruses.

It's a tough job, and Ben Gibbard can't fill all the orders. Van Petegem mostly sticks to this plan in A Thousand Words, but he's no longer going it alone. After five self-produced albums, he has decided to hire Wax Ltd., the production duo brave enough to accommodate both Jessica Simpson and Eels. This time around, he has also invited an especially colorful list of guests: the Jimmy Eat World guy, an alt-country guy, someone from the Submarines, and a collaborator from a band named Blondfire. Our office likely received its copy several weeks after Alternative Press did. Van Petegem talks a good game. ""I wanted to make an up-tempo pop album with big choruses to sing along to. I figured I'd made enough sulky mid-tempo music for the rest of my life."" The curious feat of this album is that it manages to achieve a version of the former that could only be appreciated by fans of the latter. In short, zippy anthems for angsty man-children. Far too many of these songs seemed pointed at girlfriends who have already made, or are a breath away from making, the healthiest choice: leaving Styrofoam's wussy narrator in the lurch. In a duet with Erica Driscoll, she's told to wait up: she's wrong. In ""Thirty to One"" the female addressee is told, on second thought, not to wait up for him. She, too, is wrong. Blake Hazard is told she acts fatalistically, which we can safely assume is wrong. This is how the Belgians treat their guests? The truth is, you know this man, having heard him in the background of Ashton Kutcher movies and in the food courts of local malls. He couches his overtures in the lingo of self-help. Not even computerized percussion can relieve his post-breakup pain. He is the mall-core antihero, eternal romantic victim, and Arne Van Petegem channels him so thoroughly that otherwise rational adults will feel themselves aging in reverse, à la Benjamin Button, only to stop at the whiny nadir of adolescence: circa eighth grade. This is likely what crossed the diseased minds in that last M. Night Shyamalan movie.

The North Carolina-based band DeYarmond Edison managed to sustain this fleeting moment for about four years. Like Richard Buckner, they reconciled flickering folk-rock and ambient drones in an organic, subdued way. But natural law inevitably prevailed, and as Edison wound down, they split into two different acts: Singer/songwriter Justin Vernon became Bon Iver, whose watery meanderings represent Edison's poppier side. Joe Westerlund and brothers Phil and Brad Cook (the latter of whom runs Burly Time records with Pitchfork contributor Grayson Currin) reconvened as Megafaun, whose viscous avant-folk pushes both their experimental and archaic leanings further than ever before. With Vernon out of the picture, it's as if the center of their former group's aesthetic dropped out, leaving only the extremes. On one hand, Megafaun trafficks in Appalachian twang more indebted to Dock Boggs than DeYarmond Edison's prominent Jay Farrar influence. There was something gentrified about Edison, but not so with Megafaun-- there is hooting, hollering; there are banjos scratching and pecking in the dirt. The blowzy barbershop harmonies that open ""Find Your Mark"" evoke Fleet Foxes with terrible hangovers, although this album's release on a sub-label of the experimental music imprint Table of the Elements should give you a clue that this is more than rustic reconstruction. Megafaun do away with Edison's polite experimentation in favor of full-bore concrète music, harsh noise salvos, and wild free-jazz interventions (Westerlund was a pupil of Milford Graves). It's remarkable that the hybrid sounds as seamless as Edison's staid-by-comparison one. Bury the Square abounds with surprises that don't feel forced. ""Find Your Mark"" is a perfect example: The aforementioned barbershop harmonies, backed by extremely loose percussion, give way to tight and sprightly ba-bums that wouldn't sound out of place on a Sufjan Stevens album. Then some brief tape manipulations and the emergence of electric guitar tilt the song into a final movement that ties it all together. The eleven-minute ""Where We Belong"" is dominated by aching vocals and gentle banjo; the screeching noise section would seem to come out of nowhere if it weren't latent in the flittering subterranean rhythms beneath the calm surface of the song proper. The more traditionally inclined tracks ""His Robe"", ""Drains"", and ""Lazy Suicide"" prove that Megafaun don't necessarily need left-field embellishments, they just like them. But they're at their most compelling and original when they use them: ""Tired and Troubled"", which sinks the traces of a simple folk song into a chaotic labyrinth of field recordings, draws a direct and astute line between two idioms that are superficially at odds, but meet on the common ground of an appreciation for spontaneity and a reverence for the mutations of chance.","Bon Iver's Justin Vernon left the North Carolina band DeYarmond Edison and the remaining members went on to form Megafaun; here on their debut album, they are a band of extremes, mixing Dock Boggs-style Appalachian twang with harsh noise salvos.

Entanglements,Parenthetical Girls,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9613d197565213b36a/1:1/w_160/7a4ef397.jpg,2008-09-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12131-entanglements/,Tomlab,"Listening to Entanglements, the surprising 180 delivered by Parenthetical Girls, is like bearing witness to San Francisco's Valentine's Day pillow fight, which attempts to reduce to absurdity the romance-obsessed holiday by engaging in a flash-mob feather battle. A side effect of the melee is that it exposes the propensity of ordinary San Franciscan yuppies to, every now and then, indulge in a safe dose of the abnormal. The Portland, Ore.-based Parenthetical Girls, rather abnormal themselves, recently headlined a show at a venue that's probably a Valentine's Day enabler, a little pillow-cushion factory in San Francisco Mission district. The band and crowd alike seemed thrilled by the setlong percussion they provided for their Portland contemporaries Au by banging on pots, pans, and cymbals strewn on the ground. It was a fitting scene for someone familiar with the band's aural massacres on their first two albums, which recall the melodic transgressions of Jamie Stewart's Xiu Xiu-- unsurprising given his past involvement in their work-- but now that the band is back home and releasing Entanglements, the group has turned their casual perversion to orchestral music. Frontman Zac Pennington is no Van Dyke Parks-- hell, even the record's press release concedes that he's a ""relative non-musician""-- but multi-instrumentalist collaborators Matt Carlson, Rachael Jensen, Eddy Crichton, and others who have joined since the early days of debut (((GRRRLS))) have helped to direct an entire chamber ensemble. From the opening orchestral warm-up kicking off opener ""Four Words"" to the last dying wisps of baroque strings on ""This Regrettable End"", there's nary a guitar to be found. In place of the guitars, lo-fi electronic noise, and nontraditional arrangements found on (((GRRRLS))) and 2006's Safe as Houses, the ensemble they've cobbled together recasts Pennington's demented little sex ditties as orchestral pop of the 1960s. ""Lushly orchestrated"" is usually a cliché, but few other labels approach the productional overkill laid slapdash all over the mix. Witness the sheer madness of ""GUT Symmetries"", a rhapsodic sort of love song that progresses from orchestral gamelan to carnival music in a few moments, including a lyrical reference to Kate Bush's ""The Kick Inside"" tacked on at the end. In fact, random pop culture references pop up all over the disc, such as the semi-pornographic reference to a Microphones song tucked into ""Unmentionables"", and the record is also rife with instrumental musical references. Like a Tarantino flick, Entanglements is a love note to the excesses of the past, penned in the same platinum ink as forebears like the Bacharach and Scott Walker. But to call it ""baroque pop"" doesn't really get at the relentless assault of attention deficit old-timeyness of, say, ""A Song For Ellie Greenwich"", the ethereal highlight named for the girl-group songwriter. The record is perhaps a more extreme a transformation than that of Patrick Wolf, whose flamboyant and distinctive vibrato also flirted with orchestral pop on last year's The Magic Position. Pennington, who at one point roomed with Jona Bechtolt (aka YACHT), seems firmly entrenched in the fertile strata of the Portland underground, and has surrounded himself with the residual talent of the scene. He perhaps doesn't have the studied charisma of Wolf, nor maybe the pinpoint pop songwriting chops to fully pull off the makeover, but Pennington's oblique and winning compositions and his bandmates' imaginative execution manage to pry at the idea of perfectly normal baroque pop becoming, for just over half an hour, just a little abnormal. It's too bad that, now that Parenthetical Girls are touring with a chamber ensemble, the pillow factory is no longer a practical venue.","This Portland-based band and favorite of Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart has been known for sonic grit and lo-fi electronic ventures, but for its third record the group has employed a chamber ensemble and explored the realm of orchestral pop.

Some Small History,Portastatic,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccd5e6ef95969322f11/1:1/w_160/5ceda2d1.jpg,2008-09-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12178-some-small-history/,Merge,"Portastatic will never be bigger than Superchunk, Merge Records, or Mac McCaughan, the North Carolina teenager who co-founded both institutions in the late 1980s. By now, McCaughan's released dozens of titles and hundreds of songs as Portastatic, the living-room-four-track project he started as an outlet for non-Superchunk stuff around 1992. Portastatic's been a sporadic if swift stream of 7""s, compilation tracks, EPs, and LPs-- all steadily increasing in sound quality-- ever since. It's even a fairly steady live band these days. But such prolificacy, even from a vet running one of the land's biggest indie labels, hasn't equaled popularity: Those who know Superchunk's ""Slack Motherfucker"" or ""Precision Auto"" don't necessarily know Portastatic's ""Summer of the Shark"" or ""I Wanna Know Girls"". Double ditto for those who know Merge's recent greatest hits, say the Arcade Fire's ""Rebellion (Lies)"", Spoon's ""I Turn My Camera On"", or Camera Obscura's ""Let's Get Out of This Country"". Some Small History won't change this: A 44-track collection gathering Portastatic B-sides, rarities, demos, and unreleased tunes from the last 18 years, Some Small History jumps styles, instruments, recording techniques and eras with almost each successive track. Sequenced irrespective of chronology, it's an overwhelming jumble of moods and ideas that offers neither an easy definition nor a target audience. There's a bustling acoustic cover of Bob Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" and a perfectly dissolving take on Hot Chip's ""Boy From School"". A charging electric anthem called ""Trajectory"" clashes against the solemn ""Easily Aroused"" and its hilarious bits of erotic bar talk, which bumps into a dreamy, wailing-from-a-cavern number called ""Race You Home"". ""Weighted Raft"" sounds like homemade Throbbing Gristle mayhem, and ""Gray Robins"" gauzes its vocals into infinity over a ridiculous reggae-in-the-elevator bass bounce. While the full-band, piano-and-guitar jangle of ""Portraits From Before the War"" benefits from John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone studio, ""Dragging a Crow"" suggests Jandek recording a George Thorogood jam into a cell phone. Though some of McCaughan's best work to date finally gets wide release with this set, some of its tracks could use second vocal passes, significant knob twists, or aggressive edits. As an avenue into a fairly substantial history, it's difficult. But I'd suggest you dig harder: Some Small History, like most of McCaughan's mutli-band discography, establishes his reputation as a different sort of indie rock icon. In the dorm-room dreamhouse of Malkmus, Mascis, Martsch, Moore, and Pollard, McCaughan remains the blue-collar, insight-before-eccentricity smart guy. At his best, McCaughan has long espoused a lived-in, livable indie rock schematic. With a voice that's distinctive if not dynamic, he wails about familiar situations. Just as most can imagine the jackass sitting on the ""Slack Motherfucker"" stool, the fleeting seasonal romance depicted in ""A Cunning Latch""-- ""Light comes in too early in the day/ Wakes me up but won't chase those dreams away""-- is a familiar subject, freshly stated. McCaughan writes functional songs about ordinary things-- cute girls, bad politics, fleeting romances-- and mixes the obscure (referencing The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe during ""Skinny Glasses Girl"") with the obvious (cadging from Public Enemy during ""I Wanna Know Girls""). These songs are rich without being arcane, accessible without being elementary. Malkmus and Martsch have rarely found that balance. Similarly, while McCaughan's a capable and occasionally riveting guitarist, he's not a complicated one. The inquisitive ""Your Own Cloud"", written the day Kurt Cobain died, augments simple chords with a push-and-play keyboard effect, and the acoustic demo of ""Little Fern"" adds a harmonica line that you could learn with 10 minutes and six bucks at a Cracker Barrel. The alternate trials with harsh noise (""Useless Switch""), samples (""Gray Robins"") and pitch-shifting (""Secret Session"") on History are, by and large, just that-- trials. This isn't an album, though, even if it's sequenced a bit like one. As a collection, it succeeds in being both a study of Portastatic's evolution and the first substantial release of some of the band's best: Lo-fi shamble ""Not the Same"" (originally issued as a 7"" set opposite the Extra Glenns) uses synthesizers, shaky drums, and doubled vocals to make a silly little love plea. ""Had"" bulks the build of the 1994 album version with a band that includes Polvo's Ash Bowie, and its lumbering rhythm, thick guitars and impetuous vocals make it an essential variation on Portastatic's solitary quirk. McCaughan's cover of Ryan Adams' ""Oh, My Sweet Carolina"" is staid and beautiful, its sentimental heart plated with his ever-anxious voice. After all, that's the juxtaposition McCaughan's always worked: He's a misanthrope with a romantic hope, a late-twenties rock star laughing at silly girls in bars, a 39-year-old father of two turning electro-pop bliss into acoustic rock. That is, even if it's a small history, it's foremost an interesting one.","This 44-track collection from Mac McCaughan (Superchunk, Merge Records) gathers Portastatic B-sides, rarities, demos, and unreleased tunes from the last 18 years as it jumps styles, instruments, recording techniques and eras with almost each successive track.

Death Magnetic,Metallica,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd0ea9e61561daa7576/1:1/w_160/2f6ea3b2.jpg,2008-09-09 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12180-death-magnetic/,Warner Bros.,"Metallica became the world's biggest metal band by doing everything right. Then they went and did everything wrong. Their first four records were classic permutations of 1980s thrash: The ferociously raw Kill 'Em All, the increasingly epic Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, and the toweringly technical ...And Justice for All. Until the latter, Metallica refused to make an MTV video. Self-dubbed ""Alcoholica"", the band cultivated a blue-collar image. However, on 1991's eponymous album (aka ""The Black Album""), they went mainstream with radio-friendly ballads, losing old fans but gaining millions of new ones.
 
Since then, Metallica have been a comedy of errors. Load and ReLoad wallowed in hard rock dreck. The front of Garage Inc., a covers collection, found Metallica awkwardly costumed as auto mechanics to appear as the everymen they once were. S&M was an overwrought collaboration with a symphony. The band sued Napster, earning the scorn of fans. 2003's St. Anger was laughably bad. The documentary film Some Kind of Monster luridly aired the band's dirty laundry. Singer/guitarist James Hetfield and bassist Robert Trujillo were recently photographed shopping at Armani. Such antics have kept Metallica in the headlines, and not necessarily to their benefit. The anticipation for Death Magnetic has split along two lines: hope for a return to form, and schadenfreude.
 
The album fulfills neither expectation. It tries mightily to recapture Metallica's former glory, but only does so partially. Producer Rick Rubin told the band to write the unwritten half of Master of Puppets, a ludicrous proposition. But his intent was well-meaning: get rich, fortysomething rockers to recall themselves as hungry, twentysomething metallers. In the real world, this is called a midlife crisis. One can emulate one's younger self, but one can't unlearn one's years.
 
So it is with Death Magnetic. Self-plagiarization abounds. ""That Was Just Your Life"" and ""Cyanide"" harken back to ""Blackened"" from ...And Justice for All. ""The Day That Never Comes"" has the clean tones of ""Fade to Black"" and the machine gun riff from ""One"". In the 1980s, Metallica wrote hundreds of riffs without repeating themselves. To hear them so bereft of new ideas is disheartening. So is the fact that Load, ReLoad, and St. Anger are indelibly part of their bloodstream. ""The End of the Line"" and ""The Judas Kiss"" have bland hard rock riffs à la Load and ReLoad. Like most sequels, the turgid ""The Unforgiven III"" need not have been made. ""Cyanide"" tapes a Stone Temple Pilots riff to a disastrous stop-start section straight out of St. Anger. Metallica aren't good at being bluesy or unpredictable. They're best at heavy metal thunder, and they've forgotten that.
 
Rubin's bone-dry production negates this thunder, but it evokes Metallica's garage band days. These are their most energetic performances in ages. Guitarist Kirk Hammett hasn't ever sounded this vital. While he languished solo-less in St. Anger, he's all over Death Magnetic with fiery leads. They often reprise his old ones, but their wah-fueled intensity is a welcome antidote to their underlying riffs. Hetfield has mostly dropped his bluesy yowl in favor of singing in tune. Trujillo adds solid, supportive low end. Drummer Lars Ulrich is the one weak link. He often resorts to simple oompah beats when complementary or counter-rhythms are necessary. But despite his lack of creativity, he plays the hell out of his drums, aided by a harsh, crunchy sound that renders his cymbals incredibly sibilant.
 
All the energy in the world can't save these songs, however. They're each about two minutes too long. Most top seven minutes in length; the instrumental ""Suicide & Redemption"" lasts 10 minutes but feels interminable. Prime Metallica had long songs, but they ebbed and flowed, skillfully playing with layers. These songs, in contrast, merely string together riffs. Clean tones invade ""The End of the Line"" without warning; many songs have intros that are apropos of nothing. Death Magnetic is essentially St. Anger with better riffs.
 
The band may be more mentally stable now, but it's irreparably damaged. Years of simplistic hard rock have destroyed its sense of speed. Even the thrashy ""My Apocalypse"" feels clunky. Hetfield's lyrics are toilet-grade; his younger self, while brash, would never have written tripe like ""Mangled flesh, snapping spines/ Dripping bloody valentine/ Shattered face, spitting glass."" Ever since The Black Album, his lyrics have been embarrassingly personal. Once Metallica became vulnerable, they never recovered. Death Magnetic is a meditation on death-- but so is every other Metallica record. The best ones spit in the face of death; this album instead finds aging men trying to reclaim their youth.","After more than a decade's worth of critical and public relations missteps, the world's biggest-- and at one time, best-- metal band tries to recapture its former glory on this Rick Rubin-produced album. In the real world, it's called a midlife crisis.

Fortunately,Brothers and Sisters,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbcea9e61561daa7542/1:1/w_160/b8b3053f.jpg,2008-09-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12162-fortunately/,Calla Lily Company,"Hank Williams had a gift for writing jaunty, hummable tunes wedded to some of the most broken-hearted lyrics imaginable. Songs like ""Nobody's Lonesome For Me"", ""Your Cheatin' Heart"", and ""Why Don't You Love Me"" communicated pain and longing over blithely up-tempo melodies, putting a brave face on his restless blues. Austin-based indie pop combo Brothers and Sisters may be only part-time practitioners of country, but they're nonetheless adept at tying pretty bows around heartache and regret. The band's newest album, Fortunately, is grounded in the kind of clean, 1960s-influenced pop-rock and insurgent twang that, in most other hands, would be hard-pressed to transcend mere revivalist fare. In the care of siblings Will and Lily Courtney and their band, however, these shopworn building blocks are lent renewed vitality thanks to lyrics colored by experience and wisdom. In this light, those sun-kissed harmonies and Byrdsian chord changes emerge as desperately held lifelines to innocence, rather than facile signposts of good vibes and easy loving. R.E.M.'s Out of Time feels like a crucial reference point here-- in particular the record's two opening cuts, ""Mason City"" and ""You're Gone"", manage Stipe and co.'s trick of suffusing harmonically genial college-pop with heartsick verbiage. ""The Air Is Getting Thicker"" reflects wistfully upon days when ""things were so easy"" and ""time seemed to move so slow,"" amidst the band's most unabashed approximation of Roger McGuinn's songbook. ""Can't Hold Me Back"" finds the Courtneys betraying their sprightly melodies by carefully musing, ""all the things I love about you outweigh the things I do not."" Brothers and Sisters do fine with strummy Rickenbacker pop, but Fortunately reveals the group to be more affecting when it ladles on the pedal steel. The very hint of that lonesome whine adds instant resonance to ""I Don't Rely"" and ""California""-- the latter subtly echoing ""Lay Lady Lay""-- and it gets even better when the band immerses itself in a refreshing kind of alt-country that eschews poetic antiquaries in favor of wry candor. ""Lonely Man"" drily asks the listener to ""drink a barrel of Kentucky whiskey/ and spend an hour on a tilt-a-whirl"" to understand the way he feels inside, an equation of love with physical burden likewise found in the titular refrain of the record's best song, ""Make a Man's Body Hurt"". Will Courtney, aware as always of the emotional realities of time's passage, narrates the tumultuous evolution of a love that begins with the bittersweet marvel, ""I'd been searching for this feeling so long/ I thought it died with my youth."" Everything about Fortunately is deceptive; a half-hearted listen might lead you to believe the Courtneys and their mates were unvariegated paint-by-numbers throwbacks, yet the album finds room for a deliberately cheeky novelty number about the Texas heat as well as a seven-plus-minute dream-pop closer. Any old sadcore band can set you staring at your shoelaces, but getting listeners to contemplate mortality while happily humming and tapping their toes is something subversively special.","Austin-based indie pop combo's latest album is grounded in clean, 1960s-influenced pop-rock and country twang, and reveals the band to be adept at putting pretty bows on heartache and regret.

Alphabutt,Kimya Dawson,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbb13d197565213b3ac/1:1/w_160/9e0a7b99.jpg,2008-09-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12161-alphabutt/,K,"Alphabutt, Kimya Dawson's long-awaited children's album-- and her first release since contributing a handful of tracks to the Juno soundtrack-- is not so different from what she typically does: It's packed with odd, irreverent, snickering folksongs about banal or unremarkable situations. Only now, instead of skewering complex adult relationships, she's crowing, mostly, about poo. Inspired, in part, by her two-year old daughter Panda Delilah, Alphabutt sees Dawson (formerly one-half of New York anti-folk duo the Moldy Peaches) singing simply and without affect, her voice deep and pleasantly scruffy, like a chewed-up, over-squished teddy bear. Dawson takes a lot of hits for being precious (a good chunk of that derision is probably tied up in post-homeskillet backlash), but Alphabutt, while predictably cute, is also frank and funny and delightfully rude. It's accessible but not cloying; Dawson doesn't pander or patronize or adopt the kind of preposterous, over-annunciated, beyond-Broadway cartoon voice that plagues so many children's records. More important, her work is candid and funny and matchless: What parent wouldn't want to play his or her kid an alphabet song (the stupid-charming ""Alphabutt"") where 70% of the letters refer to multi-species flatulence, ""V"" stands for flying-V, and ""C"" stands for cat butt? Still, anyone without a child in the house, a pre-adolescent sense of humor, or a massive supply of psychotropic drugs might not find too much use for Alphabutt (babies and toddlers spend a good chunk of each day mulling scatological concerns; adults, less so, yet Dawson, nodding to her audience, references the business of excreting in nearly every track). This is a children's album, and Dawson is appropriately unapologetic about all that entails (see: lyrics about animals and potties and little monster babies). But Dawson's proclivity for simple acoustic melodies and for expertly incorporating found sound (kazoos, bells, a chorus of kids) mean that these songs-- however silly or gross-- are also artfully constructed. Predictably, some cuts are more adult-friendly than others. ""Happy Home (Keep on Writing)""-- incidentally, at three and a half minutes, it's the second longest track here-- sees Dawson taking stock of the status quo, using grown-up signifiers: ""There was a time in my life that I felt so all alone/ I never thought that someday I would have a happy home/ A family and a four-track/ RadioShack microphones/ A backyard and a hammock and a paid-off student loan,"" she sings. Likewise, ""I Love You Sweet Baby,"" a catalogue of a day in the life of a parent-child team, is an ode to parenthood and the ways in which it alters-- irrevocably-- an adult life: ""The first thing on our list of things to do/ Is to wake up right next to you/ Second thing that we have planned/ Is to kiss both of your hands,"" Dawson details. Arguably the biggest challenge facing little Americans is the lack of (non-marketed, non-commercial) culture speaking directly to them-- Alphabutt is honest and funny, and manages to sidestep all tired, kid-song tropes. Any parent tired of the ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" theme would do well by their tots to pick this up.","Kimya Dawson's long-awaited children's album-- and her first release since contributing a handful of tracks to the Juno soundtrack-- is not so different from what she typically does: odd, irreverent, snickering folk songs.

"Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did EP",The Twilight Sad,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb75e6ef95969322ede/1:1/w_160/1ae3ddaf.jpg,2008-09-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12158-here-it-never-snowed-afterwards-it-did-ep/,Fat Cat,"If you've never seen the Twilight Sad live, here's your two-word review: they're loud. Like, just completely ear-splitting. A cynic might suggest that it's a defense mechanism for a relatively young band that doesn't trust their songs, or at least their ability to recreate them outside of a studio setting. It's certainly a possible explanation considering Fourteen Winters and Fifteen Autumns had a ton of guitars on it and only one guy to play them. As a result Andy MacFarlane became more reliant on delay pedals, looping together ringing ""glide guitar"" patterns into lattices of white noise-- it may have cut the distortion*,* but it sure wasn't quiet either. Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did isn't a remix or a live album, but more of a document of how the Twilight Sad follow MacFarlane's lead to switch things up in a live setting. If the reworked ""And She Would Darken the Memory"" proves anything, it's that the band does have real songs underneath all the squall-- it's hardly a straightforward piece of verse-chorus writing, but the melody feels sharper, James Graham's voice is more confident as the most prominent features of the original (MacFarlane's moaning slide riff and drummer Mark Devine's insistent snares) are excised. ""Cold Days From the Birdhouse"" was probably my favorite song of 2007-- even though the eruptive, sinus-clearing wave of distortion that cleaved the song in half has become completely anticipatory (and really, who didn't see it coming the first time?), it never loses its power to knock me out of my chair. The arrangement's wildly different here: Once again, no percussion and the only sound other than Graham's burry lines about hotels and red skies is a guitar shuddering somewhere between feedback and reverb in a manner that's nearly drone metal. Imagine the first minute and a half of the original pitch-shifted several octaves and ran through dot-matrix distortion. In essence, it's the original being turned inside out, exchanging eruptive catharsis for a tension that's enthralling and almost unbearable. Listen too close and it's almost like a soundtrack to delirium tremens. It's a neat trick, but after the first 10 minutes, it's one they threaten to use too often-- even as Snowed clocks in at a modest six tracks, it gives a bit of credence to the criticism of Fourteen Winters as being a bit samey. The title track is the only new original, and though it's an arresting use of acoustic guitars, glockenspiel, and fan organ, Graham goes a little too Bono too soon, wailing from the get-go like they band's been at it for three minutes. The most radical alterations might be the most rewarding-- ""Walking for Two Hours"" does away with distortion almost completely and instead colors the edges with a subtle harpsichord accompaniment and cymbal sizzle, achieving a sort of gothic reinterpretation of the Walkmen. And while they're not the first band to cover Daniel Johnston's ""Some Things Last a Long Time"" this year, it certainly takes the most liberties with it-- it's quite an accomplishment to be drafty and billowed to the point where Beach House is concise by comparison, but not once during its seven minutes of bittersweet accordian hum (an instrument that's unfortunately phased out live) does it sound like the band is losing sight of the message and longing. As strong as this EP is, don't think it's looking to transcend its status as a mere stopgap or fan curio-- the band itself admits Snowed isn't meant to forecast any future artistic arc. But even without Snowed as a guideline, it follows the idea of what they could do in order to surpass a debut that seemed like a single idea executed perfectly-- they've added a touring member from like-minded Glaswegians Aereogramme (who ably produces here) and dabbled in outside projects like bassist Craig Orzel's lo-fi pop (as Orzelda) and the band's soundtrack for NASA footage of the sun. Similar to Bloc Party's Silent Alarm Remixed, this might actually be a more satisfying listen, at the least a more diverse one, and more importantly, it sounds like a band realizing they can't go to 12, but they can horizontally integrate their volume in a way that makes their engrossing suburban ruminations deeper and more expansive.","Scottish band follows its critically acclaimed debut with a six-song EP collecting four alternate versions of older tracks, a new original, and a cover of Daniel Johnston's ""Some Things Last a Long Time"". All in all, it sounds like a sort of gothic reinterpretation of the Walkmen.

The Stand Ins,Okkervil River,by: Stephen M.

On The Stand Ins, it's a lousy rock show. As the interchangeable titles and puzzle-piece album covers imply, this new record is an extension of its predecessor, a further untangling of themes and ideas about music, art, celebrity, love, and the folly of it all. The Stand Ins doesn't quite match the gusto and brainy emotionalism of The Stage Names but it exceeds its bleakness. Pop songs lie, tortured singer-songwriters are wealthy narcissists, groupies have regrets, music scenes wither, nothing changes. Rock promises redemption but delivers only destruction, or at best, cultish relative obscurity. Okkervil River are the anti-Hold Steady. They should tour together. At first listen, the main difference between The Stand Ins and The Stage Names is that Okkervil's latest lacks the sense of surprise. The band's 2005 record Black Sheep Boy came out of nowhere, a thematic and musical step forward after two strong earlier albums, and The Stage Names revealed a tight, resourceful band who played with enough force to redeem leader Will Sheff's doomed characters. The Stand Ins continues that ambitious musical development, further roughing up the group's sound while sharpening its attack to an even finer point, and refining some of their old tricks while introducing new ones (see: the country shuffle of ""Singer Songwriter"", Sheff's smooth croon on ""Lost Coastlines"", and the short orchestral interludes tying everything together like incidental film music.) The Stand Ins begins with an orchestral prelude, before filling in the pages of Sheff's tattered songbook with ""Lost Coastlines"", whose boat metaphor and buoyant bassline hint at a connection with Stage Names closer ""John Allyn Smith Sails"". The song changes shape often, toggling between an acoustic jangle and a tense electric groove until it finally drifts out to sea on a sing-along of la la la's. Those syllables carry as much weight here as any other lyrics. It's a thrilling introduction, maybe even more apt than ""Our Life Is Not a Movie or Maybe"". Touring almost constantly since well before Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River have transformed into an urgent rock band that imbues Sheff's songs with as much energy and personality as he does. At times, The Stand Ins sounds like a bassist's album: Patrick Pestorius plays like he's quit the rhythm section, adding unexpectedly melodic riffs that lend subtle gradations of color to these compositions. It's his bopping theme that connects the dots on ""Lost Coastlines"" and ""Calling and Not Calling My Ex"". When ""Singer Songwriter"" threatens to topple under its top-heavy accusations, Brian Cassidy and the Wrens' Charles Bissell right the song with their determined roadhouse gallop and piercing guitar licks. Then the band does a 180 and follows it up with the soulful, horn-laden midtempo groove of ""Starry Stairs"" (which may or may not be a sequel to ""Savannah Smiles"") and the grandiose show-closer ""Blue Tulip"", which ends with a perfect Byrdsy guitar riff-- one of the album's best moments. In short, the band complements and counterbalances Sheff's cerebral songwriting simply by rocking out. His braininess is perhaps his greatest asset, and he's become one of the best lyric-writers going in indie rock, with a dense and distinctive style that trades on wordplay and internal rhymes. Song for song, he can jerk a tear with a carefully observed detail or turn of phrase (""Blue Tulip"" in particular is a backlash tragedy on a human scale), but it's the way those songs talk to one another that makes Okkeril River albums so durable and fascinating. Sheff wants to look beyond common pop song notions to discover something truer and more essential, no matter how disillusioning it may be, which is the central, enthralling contradiction for Okkervil River: Even as they ruthlessly deconstruct pop music, they make great pop music. The darker Sheff gets, the more honest he sounds and the more absorbing the song. By that equation, the stand-out on The Stand Ins is ""Pop Lie"", an exquisitely bleak dismantling of singer-songwriter pretensions. The pop singer lies in his songs, ""and you're lying when you sing along!"" (Hey, Hold Steady...) It's not hard to imagine a venue full of excited fans singing along, although it's difficult to determine whether he would view their participation as a bitter irony or a sincerely funny cosmic joke. Or if he would just smile and enjoy the moment, knowing that any listener can take that pop lie and make it true.","Life was a crummy movie on Okkervil River's breakthrough album, The Stage Names.

Heartbreaker,The Dark Romantics,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb15e6ef95969322ed2/1:1/w_160/e9ce2d64.jpg,2008-09-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12153-heartbreaker/,Lujo,"Deciding to call your modern-rock band the Dark Romantics is sort of like christening your rusted 1993 Dodge ""the Pussy Wagon,"" or naming your boring TV show Dirty Sexy Money: just saying something, unfortunately, doesn't make it so. In the case of the Dark Romantics, the ""romanticism"" seems to mostly come from lead singer Eric Collins, who throughout Heartbreaker (more wishful thinking), imitates Julian Casablancas' prematurely world-weary monotone down to each drowsily drawn-out syllable. As for the ""darkness""-- well, I suppose that refers to trenchant observations like ""Love and pain/ They are one and the same."" The Dark Romantics' second full-length offers a competent snapshot of current corporate rock, which is steeped in half-decade-old reference points. Thus, Collins is an eager descendent of the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos, Placebo's Brian Molko, and the Killers' Brandon Flowers, wearing the vague air of dissolution like so much Axe body spray. ""She's got stars in her eyes and money in her ears,"" he sings in ""Hush Your Mouth"", trying to leer knowingly like Jarvis Cocker; unfortunately, this guy is to Jarvis Cocker what Scott Stapp was to Eddie Vedder. Jarvis effortlessly exudes an intoxicating mixture of sex, cruelty, and compassion, while Collins sounds like he might keep a dog-eared copy of the Neil Strauss's The Game under his pillow. ""She breathes new life in me when I'm drowned in clichés,"" he sings of his beloved on ""Love & Pain""-- she must have her hands pretty full. The band, meanwhile, does a pretty decent approximation of the sleek dance rock that the Killers rode to success, but no one in the room has the songwriting chops to manage a ""Mr. Brightside"" or ""All These Things That I've Done"". As a result, the band just sounds like another misbegotten hopeful, another group that will bust their ass playing hundreds of shows and enduring endless morning-show radio interviews in the vague hopes that one day, a song of theirs will be picked up and used for background music in an episode of ""Gossip Girl"".","The Dark Romantics' second full-length offers a competent snapshot of current corporate rock, which is steeped in half-decade-old reference points.

The Way That It Was,Pierre de Reeder,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb05e6ef95969322ed0/1:1/w_160/c8d3e3aa.jpg,2008-09-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12152-the-way-that-it-was/,Little,"Despite their crack rhythm section, the focus in Rilo Kiley has always been on Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett, the former-child-actors-turned-indie-darlings. But if Lewis and Sennett are the group's Lennon and McCartney, does that make bassist Pierre de Reeder Rilo Kiley's George Harrison, a soft-spoken sideman who is panting for an outlet for his own songs? The Way That It Was, de Reeder's first solo outing, proves he's been hoarding material. As his band's songs have grown larger and glossier with each subsequent record, de Reeder has clearly saved his most intimate, organic impulses for his own work. The elegant, elegiac folk-pop contained here is so small in scope, so undeniably personal-- the third track, ""Sophia's Song"", was written for his young daughter-- that it would have sounded out of place amongst the synth-heavy odes to sin and sleaze that pervaded Under the Blacklight. But while Wonderwall, Harrison's first extra-Beatles release, announced an experimental spirit that the Fab Four couldn't contain, The Way That It Was actually proves the opposite about de Reeder. He is a traditionalist who is well-served playing in a band he's not leading. Neither album opener ""Shame on Love""-- an easy shuffle featuring de Reeder's gentle acoustic strum and laconic, Elliott Smith-like delivery-- nor its successive track, the twangy mid-tempo strut ""I'll Be Around"", would have sounded out of place on early Rilo Kiley albums (which isn't surprising given that the only other person playing on the former track is Rilo drummer Jason Boesel). But the rest of the record is a love letter to 1960s soft rock and 1970s MOR radio, smudged with the fingerprints of Harry Nilsson, Eric Carmen, and Christopher Cross. Though ""Not How I Believe"" (the album's best, featuring a huge campfire choir) and ""Where I'm Coming From"" allow him to use mellow accessibility to indulge in charmingly unabashed earnestness, his throwback sensibilities don't always work to his benefit. Without his edgier guitar sound, ""Sophia's Song"" becomes a schmaltzy string-laden piano ballad and ""Young and Old"", with its cringe-worthy rhymes (""And would you throw all the best things in life away/ Just keeping all of your troubles at bay"") and thinly sung, sweeping chorus, plays either as an update of ""All By Myself"" or a missing tune from the Fame soundtrack. It's admirable, however, that de Reeder has given himself over entirely to his newfound easy listening leanings. This collection is definitely cohesive because of it, and its themes of adulthood, responsibility, and the pains of growing up are well matched with melodies that would fit in between a Loggins and Messina superset and a long-distance dedication of Bread's ""Baby I'm-A Want You"". And generally speaking, his lyrics-- though unashamedly gushy-- are moving because they are so personal yet universally relatable. With poignant verses about the surprise of one day finding that you've matured (""I've grown up somehow/ Oh no, I never thought I'd change/ I know that's not possible/ But hey, hey, hey/ Just feel more comfortable that way"") are insightful lines about the inevitability of the process. ""If you're so damned scared of growing old, old, old/ That might come sooner than you know"", he sings on ""Never Thought"". Good advice, not just to the legions of today's nipped and tucked Botox worshippers, but also the extended adolescents in the world of indie rock. After all, nothing is designed to make you look older than trying too hard to look young. And with this collection of dad rock Pierre de Reeder certainly avoids that trap, even though he sounds like he's having more fun at his day job.","Rilo Kiley bassist explors adulthood, responsibility, and the pains of growing up on his soft-rock solo debut.

The Ruiner,Made Out of Babies,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb6eb335119a49ecd13/1:1/w_160/3d3f65b8.jpg,2008-09-05 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12157-the-ruiner/,The End,"Julie Christmas has one of rock's most versatile voices. Technical range does not necessarily equal emotional range, and Christmas is one of a select few who have both. Like Björk, Jarboe, and Diamanda Galas, Christmas can plummet within seconds from sweet nothings to feral growls. Even at her lightest, she retains an edge. Her voice is tart and taut, and her screams feel more like inevitabilities than conscious extensions of range. Unlike her counterparts in heavy music, who often replicate male roles, Christmas' presence is quite feminine; Babes in Toyland's Kat Bjelland comes to mind. A vocal instrument as magnificent as Christmas' requires a suitable context. She has had problems finding one. Her main band, Brooklyn's Made Out of Babies, has been hit-or-miss. At best, they coalesce into fearsome heavy metal thunder. At worst, they devolve into aimless, plodding sludge. Christmas' other band, Battle of Mice, often has the same problem. Battle of Mice's last record, A Day of Nights, was musically earnest, lyrically honest, and virtually unlistenable. Christmas' projects have tended to over-emphasize her voice's abrasive side. The Ruiner is the first record that truly harnesses Christmas' range. This is because it's the first that truly harnesses Made Out of Babies' range. Due to time constraints, the band's writing process fractured, with members working individually or in small combinations. This produced their most varied, nuanced record to date. For the first time, Christmas has a backing palette with colors to match. Guitars unspool jangly curlicues; drums and bass joust with the suppleness of Jesus Lizard. ""Stranger"" dangles eerie dewdrops of melody over abstract chords. The song perches precariously between dark and light, as Christmas lashes it with throat-shredding howls. ""Peew"" likewise plays with balance. Wordless cooings course over chugging riffs, which burst open with punishing percussive flurries. ""The Major"" recasts Björk as a doom metal diva, while ""Invisible Ink"" is a tour de force of melisma and major thirds à la Trent Reznor. Noise-rock and metal comprise much of The Ruiner, but it's really the heir to PJ Harvey's Rid of Me. That record's Led Zeppelin-esque bombast (recorded by Steve Albini, who also engineered The Ruiner's predecessor, Coward) appears here in big, boxy drums and Christmas' dramatic vocals. Like Harvey, she sings, screams, and seduces all at once. In ""Cooker"", the words ""Run, run for your life"" repeatedly erupt from her throat like napalm. They feel like something Charlie McGee might have said in Firestarter before she set the world alight.","Julie Christmas, lead singer of this Brooklyn-based noise-rock/metal band, has a voice with a rare combination of technical and emotional range, but she's had trouble finding the right context for it.

Sunshine Lies,Matthew Sweet,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8aeb335119a49ececd/1:1/w_160/5e1ef547.jpg,2008-09-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12344-sunshine-lies/,Shout! Factory,"As tempting as it may be to credit Matthew Sweet's crossover success with his expertly assembled band, which featured dueling legends Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd, the two hired guns wouldn't have had anything to hang their solos on had Sweet not come up with the goods during his golden run-- 1991's Girlfriend through 1993's Altered Beast and 1995's 100% Fun. It all starts with the songs, and for a minute there, Sweet was churning them out, one power-pop nugget after the next. The price of success is inevitably calls for more of the same, but for the past several years Sweet's been a lot more hit or miss, settling into cult status with a series of so-so releases that didn't so much coast on earlier glories as fail to live up to them. Albums such as 1999's restless In Reverse or the initially Japan-only Kimi Ga Suki were best when they came closest to Girlfriend, at least in spirit (the latter even featured most of Sweet's Girlfriend-era band). Sweet subsequently treaded water with buddies Pete Droge and Shawn Mullins as the inconsequential Thorns, and his 2006 covers disc with pal Susanna Hoffs mined the obvious: the 1960s. This all sets up Sweet for a big comeback. Sunshine Lies isn't it. Sweet's eased into the solid but rarely exceptional point in his career. He's consistent to a fault. The guy needs a challenge, and longevity alone doesn't seem to be it. On ""Room to Rock"", Sweet sounds eerily like Tom Petty, while ""Byrdgirl""-- well, the title alone gives the game away, though ""Daisychain"" is even Byrdsy-er. Meanwhile, Lloyd's lead guitar livens up the likes of ""Flying"", enough so that his absence on most of the disc's other tracks is somewhat glaring. Sweet at his best at his most gentle, as with the lovely ""Feel Fear"" or ""Pleasure Is Mine"". In his defense, Sweet (like Petty) has managed to cobble together his own identity out of all the giants he references, but that just makes overly-familiar songs such as ""Burn Through Love"" and the anticlimactic closer ""Back of My Mind"" (which features more awesome work from Lloyd) so disappointing. ""Solid"" doesn't suit a guy who's shown he can do better. As much work as Sweet clearly put into this disc, hearing him glide instead of soar makes it all sound too easy, which sadly makes it that much easier to forget.","More of the same from Matthew Sweet, only minus the fireworks of his best work.

"That Night, a Forest Grew EP",The Clientele,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc5eb335119a49ecd3a/1:1/w_160/875cc396.jpg,2008-09-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12171-that-night-a-forest-grew-ep/,AcuarelaThe Clientele,"For more than a decade now (wow), the Clientele have been reminding their faithful that music that on its face seems like simple tunefulness can disguise a very real, tangible art-pop aesthetic. In their case, they've been playing with small gradients of shadows and light, memory and nostalgia, ephemera and mundanity, love and despair, and the tricks that each of the above can play on the heart and mind. Whether bathed in reverb-- as they often were at the start-- or performing more crisp, sunny indie pop, the group's charms could seem slippery or elusive but, once hooked, most people are willing to follow them around from album to EP to one-off track and back again. Well, this is one of those EPs. Available now through eMusic and soon via venerable Spanish indie pop label Acuarela, That Night, a Forest Grew is a four-track collection steeped in the growing sonic confidence and clarity of the Clientele Mk. II but harkening back to their earlier lyrical pursuits. Unlike the band's previous two, between-album EPs-- the hazy, London-soaked Lost Weekend (2002) or Ariadne (2004) and its minimalist sound sculptures-- That Night seems less of a unified statement and more of a collection of songs. Thematic and sonic themes are intertwined throughout the record, but there are no instrumental interludes or breathers or mood pieces. Lead track ""Retiro Park"" seems like a throwback on paper-- particularly if one assumes the titular place is a London landmark. Instead it relocates the group to Madrid. There's a certain irony in the group leaning a bit on brass once they depart London, and these subtle touches unsurprisingly blend well with the walking guitar lines that have populated their last two albums. Sonically, ""Retiro Park"" is very much a post-Strange Geometry track, and a nice table-setter for what's to come. Middle tracks ""Share the Night"" and ""George Says He Has Lost His Way in This World"" are among the more upbeat songs the band has produced, with hints of the uptight disco of Orange Juice settling nicely alongside more traditionally Clientele influences such as Tom Verlaine. Straightforward pop songs, they find the group swinging and grooving about as much as they're ever apt to do. Compact and tight, they each even betray hints of Alasdair Maclean's more rugged, aggressive guitar playing, which at times comes to the fore during the band's live performances. The EP wraps up with the title track, which-- as fans might have guessed from the title-- is a spoken-word track that, although it bears no obvious ties to childhood, at least seems to flirt with magical realism. Dark and slightly sinister, the track envelopes the protagonist and his negotiation of unfamiliar settings both likely real (a London fog) and possibly imagined (the forest of the title), locating sides of suburban England that the group had yet to articulate. All in all, it's another charming and fully satisfying release from one of the world's more unsung and quietly wonderful bands. Despite containing some of the group's most immediate work, this EP won't change anyone's mind about them but it won't do anything to disappoint the many who already care.","Available now through eMusic and soon via venerable Spanish indie pop label Acuarela, That Night, A Forest Grew is a four-track collection steeped in the growing sonic confidence and clarity of the Clientele Mk.

Luminous Groove,Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc9abf31b7dc7155dd2/1:1/w_160/ff93690a.jpg,2008-09-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12174-luminous-groove/,Yep Roc,"Even in his youth, Robyn Hitchcock never exactly seemed young. As the frontman of the Soft Boys, Hitchcock seemed driven by the bitterness of a precocious young man scorned, taking up characters such as an ""Old Pervert"" with a mocking and self-deprecating sense of humor. In the period immediately following the dissolution of the Soft Boys, Hitchcock adopted a tenuously adult position, maturing in sound and approach while coveting both the comfort and the trauma of childhood. Luminous Groove, the second well-curated and impeccably packaged Hitchcock box set released by Yep Roc, showcases an interesting and sorely underrated moment in Hitchcock's career. After releasing the excellent acoustic psychodrama I Often Dream of Trains, Hitchcock formed the Egyptians, a backing band consisting former Soft Boys Andy Metcalfe and Morris Windsor, and keyboardist Roger Jackson. In a sense, it's the first time in Hitchcock's career where he seems firmly grounded in the present, maintaining his interest in vivid and dream-like imagery without obsessing over the bitterness of burgeoning adulthood or the lost innocence of youth.
*
Fegmania!* is the first and best of the albums compiled in Luminous Groove and among the strongest in Hitchcock's entire catalog, marrying the force and confidence of the Soft Boys with the focus and dexterity of Hitchcock's early solo work. Throughout Fegmania!, the structural complexity of Hitchcock's songwriting is emphasized and expanded upon by the capable Egyptians; unexpected turns and chord changes are at once more striking and less obtrusive when delivered by Hitchcock's tight and forceful band. Hitchcock's vocals are beautifully sophisticated as well, incorporating a Dylanesque sing-speak into the weirdly intimate delivery of his acoustic output. Even when the Soft Boys were at their best, Hitchcock's vocals always seemed somehow tethered to the band's gestures, but on these records-- and Fegmania! in particular-- Hitchcock seems much less constrained and more adventurous. Perhaps as a result, his storytelling often seems more purposeful; while Hitchcock could get downright silly on his earlier albums, the undercurrents of absurdist humor in songs like ""My Wife and My Dead Wife"" are more subtle and, ultimately, more unnerving. Released just a year after Fegmania!, Element of Light fully succumbs to the grand pop gestures hinted at by its predecessors. The album's verses are sly and serpentine, its choruses almost obscenely indulgent. Hitchcock's delivery is alternately smooth and unhinged, at times unifying a song's melodic intricacies and at times serving primarily to enhance a song's rhythmic texture. Many of the same musical tics that Hitchcock would later develop on Eye are apparent here, not quite as coherent as on later records but bolstered by the energy of Hitchcock's backing band. Gotta Let This Hen Out! documents a live performance from 1985 (with the addition of several later live cuts), and shows the Egyptians at their most muscular. Opener ""Sometimes I Wish I Was a Pretty Girl"", originally from I Often Dream of Trains, explodes the original version's claustrophobia, stomping out the song's preciousness and highlighting the strength of its chord progression and overall structure. Similarly, a performance of the Soft Boys' ""Kingdom of Love"" speaks to Hitchcock's newfound skill as an arranger, bringing out subtleties that were undetectable in the original. Weirdly, the straight-to-tape sound of Gotta Let This Hen Out! is a breath of fresh air when compared the the stately-yet-dated sound of the albums proper. One thing that Hitchcock's acoustic solo records do have over his work with the Egyptians is a vague but intriguing sense of thematic consistency; the bonus tracks included in this reissue (which, including the Bad Case of History 2xCD set, far outnumber the proper album cuts) don't add to the overall mystique of Hitchcock's work in the same way that the bonus cuts on the previous set did. However, the rarities selected for inclusion in this set are for the most part actual rarities, and in fact more consistent than the tracks re-released as ""rarities"" for the I Wanna Go Backwards set. Bad Case of History offers one disc of previously unreleased studio outtakes and another of well-recorded live performances, both of which are great listens and help flesh out Hitchcock's stylistic concerns during the two-year period primarily documented in this set. The more psychedelic offerings on the studio disc are particularly strong, making an excellent case for Hitchcock's use of 12-string guitar textures. The albums towards the middle of an extensive catalog like Hitchcock's often get overlooked in favor of influential early records and more recent records that benefit from endorsements and/or musical contributions from younger artists inspired by those early records. But the concurrent excitement and confidence of Luminous Groove make for a box set that is every bit as inspiring as anything else in Hitchcock's catalog. Hitchcock may be best known for his influence on and collaborations with R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, his off-kilter lyrics, his odd demeanor, his patterned shirts, and a cameo in a Jonathan Demme film, but first and foremost he is a songwriter. To that effect, Luminous Groove may be the most compelling testament yet to Hitchcock's talent.","Luminous Groove, the second well-curated and impeccably packaged Robyn Hitchcock box set released by Yep Roc, showcases his early time fronting the Egyptians, an interesting and sorely underrated moment in the songwriter's career.

We Have Cause to Be Uneasy,Wild Sweet Orange,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcad13d197565213b395/1:1/w_160/3cb01144.jpg,2008-09-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12149-we-have-cause-to-be-uneasy/,Canvasback,"The boundaries of Birmingham, Ala., foursome Wild Sweet Orange are decidedly populist-- strains of Coldplay's paradoxically epic modesty, the rootsy instrumentation of a Merge Records hopeful, and lyrical confessionals both church and Dashboard. At one point, I believe this approach might've been called ""college rock,"" and though Wheat's cruelly overlooked Per Second, Per Second, Per Second... Every Second is a precedent, this sort of alchemy can still sound novel-- particularly since Wheat all but gave up on it by their next record. Wild Sweet Orange appear to be on their way to greater success, if only because they recognize the signs of the times-- that the ability to sound bummed over soaring arrangements for twenty seconds at a time can be more beneficial than a way with a melodic hook (and you wonder why people resent the fact that they don't make 'em like ""Hey Jealousy"" anymore-- it did both). And believe you me, lead singer Preston Lovinggood (real name, no gimmicks) is one dark dude. By the first track, a Mobius strip melody details him keeled over the toilet bowl, paralyzed by the sight of ""Ten Dead Dogs"" on the way to his girlfriend's house. The tempo is laconic, but the playing still feels tightly coiled and menacing, a double-time guitar thrum hinting at a catharsis that isn't achieved until the following ""Tilt"", where Lovinggood bursts into let 'er rip caterwauls reminiscent of any number of Buckley disciples, his voice showing endearing cracks amidst an appositely tepid alt-rock strum. And right at that moment, it introduces a problem that ultimately submarines Uneasy, namely that it's so eager to please that it forgets to risk anything, so as to be actively likable as opposed to merely pleasant. Thanks to the blue state-heavy geography of modern rock, it's tempting to project some sort of Birmingham-specific attributes to Wild Sweet Orange, but it's not exactly a perfect fit, since the only real evidence of protruding Southern influence is in how the songs are coated in a Nashville glaze as thick as any countrypolitan record. At their most down-home (""An Atlas to Follow""), the springy vocal reverb and polite banjo has a latter-day M. Ward thing going on at best, and any attempt to kick up dust is promptly hosed down (the militant beat of ""House of Regret"" is strangely muted and the feedback never truly goes into the red). Moreover, Uneasy sounds like a document of a band caught up in a fishbowl effect of becoming the hot band in a smaller metro area-- they've achieved a success that's allowed them to tour beyond their confines, but Wild Sweet Orange are way ahead of themselves in terms of MOR rainbow chasing. Though a bit embarrassing in their directness, ""Seeing and Believing"" and ""Sour Milk"", a long, ruminative recollection of divorce through a child's eyes, have the ability to hit at a gut level as a debut should. Instead, they get lost in arrangements that could be described as ""tasteful,"" until you realize the production is flat and featureless-- beyond the fact that ""Seeing"" is one of those songs where you start off earmarking lyrics for later cliché exposure until you realize you'd have to quote everything, it's inaccurate to even call it a power ballad as the distorted guitars that come in during the inevitable climax sound sanded of all grit. The three-song/seventeen-minute span that follows ""An Atlas to Follow"" finds Lovinggood taking the onus upon himself to sell Uneasy, and in a way, it resembles the pained, suburban laments of Twilight Sad-- nothing much happens, but there's a underlying tension that begs to be explored. But where the latter band's eruptive dynamics captured the hormonal rush of teenhood, ""House of Regret"" and ""Crickets"" (which coasts on intriguing delay effects for a minute before becoming far less interesting) mostly just recall the horizonless vistas one sees staring out the window during the stretches of I-20. By the time they finally reach closure with the puppy-dog pout of ""Land of No Return"" (yeah, it was on ""Grey's Anatomy""), it's hardly a triumph so much as collapse from a long drive home-- simultaneous exhaustion and comfort. Still, if it catches on with the college kids this time of year, it wouldn't be surprising-- like all these incoming freshman, Wild Sweet Orange sound like they're willing to sort out the particulars of their own path provided they fit in first.","Band from Birmingham, Ala., whose ""Land of No Return"" was on ""Grey's Anatomy"", reaches for Coldplay's paradoxically epic modesty while sticking with the rootsy instrumentation of an indie hopeful on its full-length debut.

We're in the Music Biz,Robots in Disguise,by: William Bowers,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcaeeb335119a49eccfd/1:1/w_160/cd0dd0e3.jpg,2008-09-04 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12150-were-in-the-music-biz/,President,"Unless you're one of those easeful folks who can just readily access/appreciate ""fun"" without overthinking, Robots in Disguise open up an abyss of compromises. To offer a personal example: I've always been a righteous objector to crushing on bands, yet I'm totally schoolyard-smitten with this duo. Which is weird, because I've historically found self-exploitative peek-a-boo sexuality to be the pinnacle of tackiness, and lo, these girls have upped the soft-porn cover-art ante from their last album (which featured pretty much just their asses in tight jeans) by appearing topless in body paint. But, hey, in interviews they're well stoked about feminism and equality… It gets much worse. I mean, their moniker comes from the old Transformers catchphrase, but they mostly do mindless retro right. They're completely derivative, but of dozens of great bands. They're conspicuously mode-ish, but they've been clattering around since way back in 2000. They embrace meta-tropes and inside gags, but their performances are so committed that they somehow transcend novelty trappings. (Gawd, that makes them sound like Electric Six.) They have fake names-- Dee Plume and Sue Denim-- that translate to ""fake names."" (Drumwork, human and otherwise, gets credited to Ann Droid, hardy-har-barf.) As if they weren't already at risk of being considered a spoof band, they've performed as a more satirically electro-trash version of themselves called Kraftwerk Orange on Britcom The Mighty Boosh. (Plume's even a UK tabloid bit-player as a result of dating Boosh star Noel Fielding, while Denim's romantically linked with their producer, Sneaker Pimp Chris Corner). So yeah, a pic of one of them in a diamond-checkered bodysuit is my pathetic bachelor-pad desktop background (and I can't even deal with that press photo floating around, the one with the chinstraps and the biting each other). Plus: I'll admit that this record is abysmally sequenced-- the weakest tracks are the tinnier-than-tinny opener and the how-dare-they closer; ""We're in the Music Biz"" is a self-deprecating bit about, you know, being a band, while ""Don't Copy Me"" is way audacious coming from ladies whose sound is about original as Skechers' shoe designs. Ah, but everything in between yields some great rewards. The multivalent ""Can't Stop Getting Wasted"" and ""The Sex Has Made Me Stupid"" are Hold-Steady-caliber in their roles as both hell-raising party anthems and hungover lifestyle warnings. (I'd go so far as to say that the brilliantly simplistic, irresistibly catchy, and comprehensively remorseful ""Sex"" is the most tragic absentee from Pitchfork's Top Tracks of 2007.) New single ""The Tears"" is an angular, jokeless threat-vamp that cribs from Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"" (which Robots already snaked on 2005's ""Turn It Up""). ""I Don't Have a God"" conflates sexual and spiritual tension as stirringly as Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"", or Linda Sundblad's churchy masturbation-apology ""Oh Father"". Meanwhile, ""I'm Hit"" boasts a monster bassline, evoking a super-Anglo CSS. So, as much as one might conceive of oneself as inured to the appeal of bratty, sneering fashionistas copping gram-bags of everything vogue, from no-wave to dance-punk, Robots in Disguise stake out some middle ground between obnoxious and hot, grating and seductive, escapist and sober. And that's despite intervals that sound like Stereo Total or the Runaways at their worst. The undertone of loss and accountability throughout this album refutes naysayers who claim (as a recent Adbusters cover story did) that hipstercult has no capacity for reflection, and protects this witty project from getting dismissed as an other-gendered send-up, a Weird Alice or Vaginal Tap. Indeed, hearing these gorgeous voices beg an abusive lover, like masochistic Oliver Twists, ""Please sir, can I have some more,"" and plead to the economy, ""Help me, I'm greedy!"" ranks among the most intense and passionate moments in my listenership this year.","Bratty, sneering fashionistas copping gram-bags of everything vogue, from no-wave to dance-punk?

Motörizer,Motörhead,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb5abf31b7dc7155da4/1:1/w_160/9f241d93.jpeg,2008-09-04 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12156-motorizer/,Steamhammer,"Motörhead has one song. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's slow, but it's basically unchanged after 33 years. Its sound is recognizable within seconds. The drums are driving and utilitarian. Guitars run 1950s boogie woogie, 1970s dinosaur rock, three-chord punk, and proto-heavy metal through cranked stacks. Leading the charge are Lemmy's trademark Rickenbacker bass-- distorted like a guitar, with everything turned all the way up-- and his equally gruff vocals. Lemmy's microphone stand is impossibly high, so that he looks like he's singing to the sky. Motörhead's song is an electric missile with a three-minute trajectory.
 
The song's enduring power is due as much to its message as its sound. Motörhead's themes are drinking, fighting, fucking, and anti-religion. (Each album typically features a surprisingly eloquent indictment of Christianity.) Lemmy won't win awards for his lyrics, but they're perfect for his songs. They're blunt, memorable, and the essence of rock'n'roll. Take ""Built for Speed"", from 1986's Orgasmatron: ""I was born with the hammer down/ I was built for speed."" Or ""America"", from 1982's Iron Fist: ""America, fast cars/ America, the girls, the bars/ America, don't make no fuss/ America, get on the bus.""
 
These lines matter-of-factly sum up the band's life as road dogs. Motörhead built its name with its classic lineup of Lemmy, guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke, and drummer ""Philthy Animal"" Taylor. From 1977 to 1982, this trio made five records that yielded most of Motörhead's hits: ""Ace of Spades"", ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"", ""Overkill"", ""The Chase Is Better Than the Catch"". Since then, Motörhead have essentially reprised these early successes, with slight variations in production values and occasional sonic experiments. (The two major aberrations are 1983's relatively ornate Another Perfect Day, featuring Thin Lizzy's Brian Robertson on guitar, and the unfortunate cock rock of 1992's March ör Die.)
 
Since Motörhead's output has basically been an excuse for touring, it's best measured against the band's hits. In other words, could new songs fit next to old ones in a live set? By this standard, Motörizer is a success. Like most other Motörhead records, it has a few stone-cold classics, some interesting detours, and many iterations of its one song. ""Runaround Man"" is prime Motörhead, exuding braggadocio and a wall of distortion. Having played with Lemmy for over 15 years, guitarist Phil Campbell and drummer Mikkey Dee have undeniable chemistry. ""English Rose"" finds Lemmy oversexed as always (he's said to have bedded thousands of women), with his catchiest chorus since 1991's ""No Voices in the Sky"". ""Buried Alive"" is a barreling barnburner, the kind that's influenced a list of bands as long as this review. (A few examples: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Darkthrone, Entombed, High on Fire, Doomriders, Disfear, the entire subgenre of crust punk.)
 
A few surprises pop up on Motörizer. Lemmy waxes pointedly political on ""When the Eagle Screams"": ""Still the young men come with zest and zeal/ I'll tell you why they want to fight and die/ Because the people over them are full of shit and lies."" ""The Thousand Names of God"" slathers slide guitar atop atypically lockstep metal. ""One Short Life"" is a slow, heavy blues. But otherwise, Motörhead do what they do best: be Motörhead. Motörizer avoids the bland hard rock that larded up some of the band's recent records. Instead, its 11 tracks efficiently clock in at under 39 minutes. Lemmy turns 63 this year, but he still sounds half his age.","Avoiding the bland hard rock that has larded up some of the band's most recent records, the efficient Motörizer finds Motörhead doing what they do best: being Motörhead.

Adorata EP,The Gutter Twins,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb9eb335119a49ecd19/1:1/w_160/19aa1d76.jpg,2008-09-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12160-adorata-ep/,Sub Pop,"Over the course of his career, whether in the Afghan Whigs or Twilight Singers, Greg Dulli has covered acts as diverse as the Supremes, TLC, Fleetwood Mac, Björk, and John Coltrane with often striking results. At the very least, such earnest, even revelatory stunts revealed a craftsman's grasp of context, the notion that even the tried and true can be taken in a new direction by a different voice. Indeed, Dulli's honed his personality as the premier alpha letch to such perfection that he's able to twist whatever material he's singing to suit his needs. Were his schedule lax enough to allow such an indulgence, he'd make one hell of a wedding singer. Given Dulli's track record, it's no shock that the Gutter Twins would get around to recording some covers of their own. At the least, Dulli and partner/complement Mark Lanegan have just a single album's worth of material to their collective name, so an eight-song EP of mostly cover tracks (plus a couple of previously unreleased originals) injects some new blood into a project. Another impetus for Adorata was the passing of Eleven/Queens of the Stone Age singer/organist Natasha Shneider, who died of cancer earlier this year. Portions of the EP's proceeds will go to her memorial fund. Frankly, getting Shneider's name out there, not to mention covering Eleven's ""Flow Like a River"", could make more of an impact than whatever money is raised by the internet-only sales of this solid EP. ""Flow Like a River"", from Eleven's 2003 disc Howling Book, is a perfect fit for the Gutter Twins, who don't reinvent the song so much as give it a little kick. The same could be said of some of the other cover choices on Adorata-- Vetiver's ""Belles"", for example, is pushed slightly out of psych-folk mode, but the version here sticks pretty close to the spirit of the original. Swedish songwriter José González, however, gets the full treatment with his ""Down the Line"", which is given a set of cojones courtesy tough drums and some pounding piano, transforming this track into a veritable anthem. Elsewhere Primal Scream's ""Deep Hit of Morning Sun"" is given a funky facelift that streamlines the hallucinogenic cyber-punk ""Venus in Furs""-isms of the original to suit Dulli and Lanegan's collective M.O. The traditional ""St. James Infirmary"", which Lanegan recently recorded with Isobel Campbell, is reprised here, with Dulli as duet partner and Lanegan's baritone once again perfect for the mournful blues of this death ballad. He's great on Scott Walker's ""Duchess"", too, another track that the Gutter Twins leave largely alone, wisely recognizing it as a song you don't mess around with. While no one would ever accuse the enigmatic Walker of excessive sunniness, there's an airiness and openness to this reading at refreshing odds with the Twins' more typical claustrophobic sound. Which brings us to the band's new tracks, which should surprise no one by reverting back to the expected darkness and intensity. It's called playing to your strengths, which the slow-burn ""Spanish Doors"" and the particularly Whigs-y ""We Have Met Before"" (both led by Lanegan) do well. Or well enough, since flipped on their head those same strengths could be seen as limiting weaknesses. Certainly no one expects smiley face music from these guys, but it'd be nice to know such a side exists in more than just fleeting glimpses. As the pair gets more and more comfortable with the idea of being a band rather than a one-off, maybe we'll start to get more of the risks this EP only hints at. Until then, Adorata simply keeps the fire stoked and the scent of brimstone swirling as the group's smoke-obscured future comes into focus.","Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan keep the fires burning darkly on an EP of mostly covers, tackling songs by José González, Scott Walker, and Primal Scream, among others.

Brotherhood,The Chemical Brothers,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc413d197565213b3bf/1:1/w_160/a09f4d80.jpg,2008-09-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12170-brotherhood/,Virgin,"In 2003, the Chemical Brothers celebrated a decade in the business by compiling most of their A-Sides onto a single-disc. Chronologically arranged-- and packaged with a second disc of B-sides, alternate mixes, rarities, and the fantastic non-LP single ""Loops of Fury""-- Singles 93-03 provided a one-stop reminder that this was a dynamite duo in the 1990s, and, well, still a duo in the 2000s. Now Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons return with another compilation, Brotherhood, that leans heavily on the same set of songs gathered half a decade ago: Nine of the 13 songs from Singles are repeated here, with six songs recorded over the past five years-- including a pair of new tracks-- taking the place of ""The Test"" and ""Get Yourself High"" (hooray!) and ""Song to the Siren"" and ""The Private Psychedelic Reel"" (boo!). The questions that spring to mind are: Why this and why now? There aren't any easy answers. Anyone looking to be reminded that the Chemical Brothers amassed a vital body of work throughout their career has not only a strong trio of proper albums to reference but also that last Singles collection. Newer fans who've gravitated to the group by way of their recent collaborations with Q-Tip (""Galvanise"") or Bloc Party's Kele Okereke (""Believe"") ostensibly already own those recordings and, rather than re-purchase them alongside other tracks, would still do better with the earlier Singles collection. (Or Exit Planet Dust. Or Dig Your Own Hole. Or Surrender.) That said, there are two arguments that could be made in favor of this collection over Singles: This new record is a more favorable look at the 00s Chemical Brothers than its predecessor, and its 2xCD version features a better bonus disc than the 2003 model. Of the quartet of songs from this decade on Singles, only ""Star Guitar"" (a fantastic track I grossly underrated here at the time) wasn't a collaboration. Not coincidentally, it's also by far the best of the four. Despite the surprisingly solid ""Believe"", most of the Chems' best work this decade has resulted from abandoning their revolving door of guests. While it was nice to find them expanding beyond their early LP guest-star template-- messianic Northern English rock guy, American psych-rock artist, Beth Orton-- other partnerships both largely failed and took up an increasingly large amount of space on their records. Where they once melded pop and art into rolling, blissful tracks or urgent combinations of sub-bass and Bomb Squad-like beats, throughout this decade the Chems have increasingly and disappointingly cordoned off their pop from their art, with the former reflected in mostly awkward stabs at the UK charts and the latter finding them continuing the acid/trance-infused work they started on Surrender. The much-missed ""My Elastic Eye"" aside, songs like ""Star Guitar"" and ""Saturate"" successfully gather the best of the group's work this decade. Another boost comes with the new track ""Midnight Madness"" and a Spank Rock collaboration, ""Keep My Composure""-- the best Chems/MC pairing to date. But the real highlight here-- and the reason for longtime fans to even flirt with buying this-- is the gathering of the group's 10 ""Electonic Battle Weapon"" sides, a series of dancefloor test pressings. Of the 10 tracks, all but one wound up officially released in some capacity. Individually, these cuts are more curiosity than quality, but collectively, the series fills in an important and engaging chapter in the Chemical Brothers' history, and functions as more than scattered odds and ends. As expected, they're on the whole more track-y and dancefloor-oriented, but again, considering the duo has always shown more acumen for extended instrumental work than concise chart thrills, that's a plus. Five years ago, while reviewing Singles, I concluded that ""For more than 10 years, the Chemical Brothers have been one of the most vibrant post-acid house artists in the UK, but the only clear reason for their fans to plump for this disc are located on the now-requisite limited-edition bonus disc."" And while Brotherhood is a well-sequenced listen-- and one that, in ""Star Guitar"", ""Saturate"", and ""Keep My Composure"", highlights a few lesser gems-- that's even truer today.","Five years after their last compilation, the Chemical Brothers return with another career-spanning collection-- one redeemed mostly by a bonus disc gathering the group's ""Electronic Battle Weapon"" series of DJ test pressings.

Waiting in Vain,James Jackson Toth,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca9ea9e61561daa7518/1:1/w_160/cd38c226.jpeg,2008-09-03 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12146-waiting-in-vain/,Ryko,"James Jackson Toth's solo work-- Waiting in Vain is ostensibly his fourth solo record, though the three prior all flew under the Wooden Wand banner-- has traced a linear path from the bizarre psych-folk of Harem of the Sundrum & the Witness Figg to the layabout dust-rock of last year's James and the Quiet. Those albums, increasingly structured and tuneful, felt like a natural reaction to Wooden Wand's unstructured heathenism. Here, however, Toth transforms from hip(pie) priest to forlorn wanderer via a cocktail of Casanova-isms, armchair psychology, and alt-country. That Toth swung fully the other way was no surprise, but it was always a dicey proposition: Toth is neither an excellent vocal stylist nor a particularly clever wordsmith, and his intrigue has always been based on a mixture of homespun oddity and improvisational excess. To think that his world is now vying for a(nother) Bright Eyes opening gig-- see: ""Beulah the Good""-- or hacking college radio playlists places that intrigue in the rearview. Waiting in Vain is deeply invested in Americana aesthetics, positing Toth as the pose-able Kris Kristofferson action figure. Early on, it becomes apparent that given a lilting, slow-beat ballad, Toth will wind himself in knots being poetic: enter the detestable ""Doreen"", in which all of Toth's worst lyrical tendencies-- arrogance and vagary amid simple rhymes-- pop up. To wit: ""I'm dreaming in a room with a complicated clown,"" ""You tell me I ain't your dad/ But I'm better than the one you had,"" and, most vexing, ""You're the water/ I'm the trace of lead inside."" ""Look in on Me"" presents ""Cocaine and bourbon, pinball and pool"" as personal attributes, as if they represent a sense of despair or emotional investment. ""Poison Oak"" (NB: not the Oberst song of the same name) drags depressingly (""Your father oughta have his old head busted in/ For raising you up like he did""); ""Do What You Can"" is soggy and shapeless. Too bad, because ""Look in on Me"" represents one of a handful of songs on Waiting in Vain that contain both competent hooks and a careful arrangement. Toth has always had really cool friends, and here Vetiver's Andy Cabic shows up. Nels Cline (Wilco, the Nels Cline Singers) and Deerhoof's John Dieterich take turns on guitar; the brilliant, harmonic squiggles on ""The Dome"" and ""The Banquet Styx"" are likely theirs. The beefy, uptempo rush of ""Beulah the Good"" and ""Styx"" help overcome Toth's missteps. On ""Beulah"", he momentarily discovers his inner Blonde on Blonde-- ""I was miserable and bitter/ Life was easy,"" ""I used to have seven wives/ I can't even count to six""-- and finally seems at ease in his druggy self-consciousness. ""The Dome"" is particularly frustrating: Its seven minutes of doom-folk sound like someone bloodied R.E.M.'s ""Everybody Hurts"" and as Toth drones ominously about ""the telephone zone"" it becomes clear that this displaced drudgery is a better fit for Toth's demeanor than jaunty, pretty country-rock. Wooden Wand more than proved Toth an idiosyncratic artist worthy of attention, but Waiting in Vain trades oddity for reasonably executed convention far too often. The result is pale, beefy, and contemptuous.","Deeply invested in Americana aesthetics, the fourth solo album from James Jackson Toth-- the three previous ones flew under the Wooden Wand banner-- finds him abandoning his bizarre psych-folk for alt-country. Members of Wilco and Deerhoof make guest appearances.

The Lord Dog Bird,The Lord Dog Bird,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca7ea9e61561daa7511/1:1/w_160/9afa4db2.jpg,2008-09-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12144-the-lord-dog-bird/,JagjaguwarThe Lord Dog Bird,"Read the Lord Bird Dog as a dispatch from the Wilderness camp and it's a guaranteed disappointment. In 2005, Wilderness unleashed a spectacular debut-- a dense, demanding gnarl of pitiless howls and spidery guitars. The Baltimore four-piece's solid second LP remained within previously drawn parameters and received, predictably enough in this age of novelty, a cooler reception. So to better manage expectations, you might want to approach Wilderness guitarist Colin McCann's solo LP as the modest, small stakes ""How I Spent My Band's Hiatus"" document it is. Even for fans of the homemade and rough-hewn, the record isn't going to reshuffle any mental year's-best lists. McCann's got a couple good song ideas, but he's committed them, apparently, to a machine rigged of tin cans and string. Twenty years ago, he might not have had other recording options, but today, hiss-scribbled, gunked-up 4-track ephemerality is a conscious choice-- one that can be effective if you have super strong tunes and a well-defined aesthetic. While lo-fi lends a vaguely vintage UK mystical underground folk vibe (one reinforced by songs titles like ""Druids"" and ""Song for Woodthrush"") to the record, it doesn't do McCann's diffident melodies or plodding percussion any favors. The Lord Bird Dog's label, Jagjaguwar, has wisely offered album closer ""The Gift of Song in the Lion's Den"", to the downloading masses as the album's free (free to post on your blog without fear of legal repercussion, anyway) mp3. Given its low-key acoustic milieu, the song is surprisingly rousing and anthemic, drawing considerable strength from a rigid beat, relentless and insinuating looping guitar figure, and McCann's high, resonant, reedy voice. Opener ""The Shedding Path"" is another gem molded of rudimentary melodic and rhythmic materials and apocalyptic testimony (""There was blood in your mouth/ And the song was sprung from all you see""; ""Set a table for death/ Make the path straight""). But most of the seven tracks crammed between these fine bookends, including two undistinguished instrumentals, run together in a modal drone, lacking urgency or emotional inflection. Really, they're no better or worse than what you'd find on the average bedroom taper's MySpace page. In fact, the Lord Dog Bird might have eluded the attention of all but the most committed lo-fi folk fans if it weren't for two critical factors: a respected independent label with promotional muscle and a superlative parent band that's been silent too long.","Wilderness guitarist Colin McCann's solo LP is a modest, small stakes ""How I Spent My Band's Hiatus"" document, a homemade, rough-hewn release from Jagjaguwar.

From the Great American Songbook,Tom Carter and Christian Kiefer,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca6eb335119a49ecced/1:1/w_160/e3bea08d.jpeg,2008-09-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12143-from-the-great-american-songbook/,Preservation,"The Band-- the self-titled second album from four Canadians and an Arkansas drummer unfortunately known best for backing Bob Dylan and hosting The Last Waltz-- was released September 22, 1969. Just three weeks had passed since an American Army officer was charged with premeditated murder in the My Lai Massacre. In six weeks, Richard Nixon would ask the nation to support his policies in Vietnam. The bluegrass-based soundtrack for O Brother, Where Art Thou? was released December 5, 2000, one month after the election of George W. Bush and 10 months before the September 11 terrorist attacks. The record sold six million records after September 2001, compared to only two million before it. Just as Greil Marcus has long suggested that the Band's shambling Americana offered shelter from 1969 storm, Pitchfork critic Amanda Petrusich intimates similar fuel for the O Brother explosion in her second book, It Still Moves: ""It seems inevitable that a film soundtrack packed tight with ancient American folk songs would soar to the top of the pop charts in a year when nearly everything 'American' was being challenged."" Indeed, in the face of crisis, people often revert to the basics. Seeking an old, familiar sound seems as natural as asking parental advice or eating comfort food. The trouble, though, is moving on: Second-rate roots-rockers like the Eagles were the 1970s equivalent of fat 'n' happy, and most anybody picking political bones and a flattop guitar these days warrants an NPR feature. From the Great American Songbook, the follow-up to last year's mostly perfect debut collaboration between California multi-instrumentalists Christian Kiefer and Tom Carter, doesn't suffer the recent or ancient past as much as it does mine it, steering the old gaze forward with erudite, imaginative recastings of eight stateside standards. That is, Kiefer and Carter embrace history. Then they advance it. You may recognize Carter's name from his work in Charalambides, his guitar-duo-plus with ex-wife Christina. They've long adorned simple melodies with serpentine passages and spectral textures. With units like Mudsuckers and in recent collaborations with percussionist Robert Horton, he's explored progressively dense drones and long-form improvisations. Kiefer, on the other hand, earned his doctorate in American literature last year and plays what Harp once called ""post-folk""-- sturdy singer-songwriter fare with surprising flourishes and misdirections. Songbook pushes all of those tendencies-- power hum, snaking string duets, high learning, post-everything-- into extreme territory: A sonically and conceptually liberal ""folk"" album, Songbook amps rich source material with a union of mighty drones and dissonant skree, clawhammer banjo picking and ragged old sangin'. Check the technique, too: Kiefer recorded the duo's improvisations around songs ranging from ""Will The Circle Be Unbroken"" to the Scott Joplin rag ""The Entertainer"", then recruited friends like Califone's Ben Massarella to add their own contributions remotely. In essence, he added overdubs to improvisations on songs sometimes more than a century old. Kiefer and Carter then invited eight other musicians-- from microtonal maestro Tony Conrad to Japanese improviser Tetuzi Akiyama-- to write about one track. Appropriately, the excellent Australian label, Preservation Music, released this multimedia retooling of American cultural grails. The results are as intriguing as they are varied: Four of the eight tracks are steadfast instrumental exercises, taking originals like ""Hard Times Killing Floor Blues"" and ""Jesse James"" and stretching certain motifs or sections. ""The Coo-Coo Bird"" moans its songs with electric slide guitars, slow and mournful and eerie. The album's other half bends familiar pieces into alien voices, though: ""Pretty Polly"", a murder ballad about a boy who walked his love to her shallow grave, is haunting and damaged here, guitar noise flooding Kiefer's singing like the sinister electricity that filled the air that night so many years ago. Only the basic piano line remains for Joplin's ""The Entertainer"", which becomes either the soundtrack to a carousel spinning off its axis or the perception of a music box through acid-altered ears. Still, it's the duo's 12-minute variation on ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" that takes the grandest aims here. Save a sense of chord changes, the duo lifted very little musically from the pre-Depression Carter Family tune, which essentially reconfigured an old gospel number and made it a hit. Played with a pump organ, an E-bow applied to an electric guitar, and drums, Songbook's version swells into a monolithic, top-heavy drone that's wobbling by the six-minute mark. Kiefer improvises on the keys, inducing arrhythmia and atonality. Things converge on the other side, though, culminating as a musical manifestation of that old lyrical axiom about death and reunion and eternal life. After all, last year marked the 100th anniversary of the song's copyright. And here, alongside seven other classics you probably know just from living life, it's been reborn with bright and bold ideas, not nostalgia and mawkishness. Periodic revolution is as important to music as it is to politics: Especially in troubled times, bless anyone handling a sacrosanct songbook with such vigor and vision.","Best known for his experimental folk work in Charalambides, Tom Carter teams here with singer and multi-instrumentalist Christian Kiefer (with Ben Massarella of Califone on percussion) for an improvisatory and forward-thinking take on American standards like ""Will The Circle Be Unbroken"" and ""The Coo-Coo Bird"".

That Lucky Old Sun,Brian Wilson,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb4eb335119a49ecd0c/1:1/w_160/4c2b35f2.jpg,2008-09-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12155-that-lucky-old-sun/,Capitol,"In 2004, Brian Wilson finally climbed one of the biggest artistic mountains of his life, recording and releasing a complete version of Smile, which since 1966 had been perhaps the most legendary unfinished album ever. It was a triumph that returned Wilson to the spotlight, crowning an extremely spotty solo career with a true jewel. In fact, Wilson had already released the now nearly forgotten Gettin' in Over My Head earlier in 2004, to virtually no fanfare. Smile, though, was different. We knew it was brilliant before we even heard it, and though I still prefer my own bootleg of the original 60s recordings, it was something of a relief to hear Wilson finally purge the project that derailed him so long ago. If Smile finally cleared out Wilson's closet, That Lucky Old Sun neatly closes the circle he began drawing in 1961 with the single ""Surfin'"", returning him to an idealized Southern California after Smile brought him across the country and through its history. Musically and lyrically, That Lucky Old Sun is as cohesive as its predecessor, though more modest in scale and ambition. Wilson and co-writers Scott Bennett and Van Dyke Parks have created an amazing portrait of L.A. and Wilson's place within it, blending nostalgia with hope for the future and honest biographical detail. The title track is an appropriately chosen oldie, written in 1949 by Beasley Smith and Haven Gillespie with lyrics that contrast the toil of life with the easy indifference of nature to our travails. In the past, it's been a hit for Frankie Laine, Louis Armstrong, and Frank Sinatra, but here, Wilson uses it as a musical thread to tie his album together, reprising it three times after opening the album with it. Also aiding the album's suite-like feel are four spoken interludes written by Parks that paint images of L.A. life with the writer's characteristic sense of wordplay and rhythm. From a listening standpoint, these are the low points of the album, as Wilson's narration isn't very compelling, especially when he's asked to wield a series of Spanish phrases after ""Mexican Girl"". The narratives do, however, flesh out the album's geographical portrait. The lyrics to the songs themselves are often just as vivid, such as the opening verse of ""Morning Beat"", which borrows its rhythmic feel from the Beach Boys' early singles. ""The sun burns a hole through the 6 a.m. haze/ Turns up the volume and shows off its rays/ Another Dodger blue sky is crowning L.A."" perfectly captures a sunny day in the city Wilson still loves. References to star-studded concrete, the Capitol Building, the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood Hills, and even smog are sprinkled throughout the album and complete the picture. Wilson's backing band, largely similar to the crew that worked on Smile and he has been touring with, is versatile, handling both old-school rock'n'roll and big, pretty ballads with ease. Members even do their best to approximate the harmonies of the Beach Boys when necessary-- especially since, with Wilson's falsetto gone, it's up to his mates to hit the high notes. Though it's just as orchestrated and complex as some of Wilson's classic work, the record doesn't capture that sparkling, big-room sound; as a result, it can occasionally feel a little hermetically sealed, especially with the way the background vocals are mixed and compressed. As interesting as the portrait of Southern California the album paints can be, it's the self-portrait Wilson embeds in his wider narrative that carries the majority of the album's emotional weight. ""Forever She'll Be My Surfer Girl"" is clear self-referential nostalgia, but he digs deeper elsewhere. ""I am a diver, a long line survivor,"" he sings on ""Live Let Live"", a line knowingly provided by Parks. ""Oxygen to the Brain"" and ""Midnight's Another Day"" are direct attempts to put Wilson's past mental and substance troubles to bed. ""I laid around this old place/ I hardly ever washed my face,"" he signs on the former, following it up on the latter with, ""Swept away in a brainstorm/ Chapters missing, pages torn."" Wilson washes his hands of those missing pages on two celebratory numbers, ""California Role"", which uses its title's nearly unforgivable pun to actual good effect. But it's ""Going Home"" that most firmly validates his renewed artistic currency: ""At 25 I turned out the light/ Couldn't handle the glare in my tired eyes/ But now I'm back."" And he is, with his finest non-Smile album since the golden age of the Beach Boys. Lucky us.","After the long-awaited, triumphant official release of Smile, the former Beach Boy returns-- along with co-writers Scott Bennett and Van Dyke Parks-- creating an amazing portrait of L.A. and his own place within it.

The Recession,Jeezy,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb813d197565213b3a6/1:1/w_160/0110122f.jpg,2008-09-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12159-the-recession/,Def Jam,"Young Jeezy ""fucks with John McCain,"" but he's an ardent Barack Obama supporter. This confused stance makes more sense after listening to the Atlanta MC's third LP, billed as a response to the country's current economic troubles. But really, The Recession relates to the recession about as much as McCain relates to pacifist immigrants; there's no mention of subprime mortgages or the credit crunch throughout its 18 tracks. Jeezy, like McCain and Obama, is a quality politician who knows how to appeal to his base. So instead of offering Economist-style predictions and Dowd-y editorials, Jeezy gives us a Jeezy record: synthetic beats that come down like anvils, ad libs by the freight load, and all-or-nothing Bald Bull punchlines. Like the world's most famous 72-year-old Republican, the rapper is trying to tweak a working formula to his advantage. If there's any sort of recession happening on the album, it's a mental one-- for the first time, Jeezy questions the world around him instead of simply reveling in it by any means necessary. And, like a certain history-making Harvard Law School alum, Jeezy is searching for change from the inside out while trying to maintain a superhero guise. ""It's a recession, everybody broke/ So I just came back to give everybody hope,"" huffs the street preacher on the title track. This is Young Jeezy the Savior-- the same guy who wore a Marvel-like seal on the front of his chest at a recent New York City concert. It's the guy who stacks his hoarse vocals in an effort to inspire and motivate on albums like The Inspiration and Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101. Minutiae is his enemy. After all, there's no time for Plato (or KRS-One) style philosophizing in 2008, when sound bites talk and your iTunes hotness pales compared to the Jonas Brothers. In this version of The Dark Knight, Jeezy is everyone: caped crusader, diabolical villain, jolly fatalist, big guy who surprisingly takes the moral high ground. On the wicked Okayplayer bitch slap ""Word Play"", he drops a drug-selling campaign slogan (""You niggas want word play but I got bird play""), reveals his anti-matter approach as ingenious strategy (""I'm way too intelligent to play up my intelligence""-- still President Bush, take note), and floats democratic ideals before snatching them back with an iron fist (""If [Pac] had to pass the torch that bitch would go to me/ Now wouldn't you agree?/ Doesn't matter, I accept!""). A few songs later, on the regal ""My President"", he begins by throwing out his cue cards (""I ain't write this shit, by the way!"") and suckering old-guard delegate Nas to finish things off sounding tinier than ever. Chalk up another win for the NYC outsider with the hearty guffaw. But not even this highly inflatable rapper can solve all of America's problems with a tautological twist and a spirited ""yeeeaaahhh!"" Whereas he once supported going crazy, Jeezy's now thinking twice about a planet gone nuts on ""Crazy World"". Flip-flopper? You decide: ""They want that Young shit, that dumb shit, that 'where you from' shit/ That ride around your hood with your gun shit,"" he starts-- whether it's a lament or a statement of purpose isn't entirely clear. He later considers swiping his ""granny's nerve pills"" before ending up at a ""how many houses do you own?""-esque dilemma: ""I want a new Bentley, my auntie need a kidney/ And if I let her pass her children never will forgive me."" Apparently, Def Jam's health care package is kinda stingy. The self-recession can be ridiculous, but it's there if you look hard enough. Though he's made mainstream inroads with cameos on tracks from Usher and Mariah Carey this year, ""Hustlaz Ambition"" has Jeezy retreating from the spotlight: ""As far as award shows, we all know how that goes/ So what's all the doubt about, because he ain't sellin' out?/ Because he ain't givin' up?/ Because he don't give a fuck?/ I guess he ain't lame enough."" While Jeezy may piss away his Grammy chances, he also allows Mr. Grammy Family, Kanye West, to spew Auto-Tune and steal all sorts of shine on stellar single ""Put On"". Between his verse's wrenching pleas to his late mother and mildly intimidating pick-up lines, West embodies the crazy world Jeezy is still too scared to fully admit exists. People like to see their heroes break down now and then. The Recession is a third-term bid that can't help but repeat talking points of its previous incarnations. Bolstered by a gimmick and a catchphrase, the album is by-and-large Jeezy qua Jeezy, and the new fissures aren't enough to keep pundits gabbing. Nobody else can pull off this brand of big, and its singularity is noteworthy but oftentimes second-rate: ""Welcome Back"" was more welcomed when it was called ""Standing Ovation"" or ""Hypnotize"", and ""Circulate"" pulses Philly Soul like a less crazed ""Go Crazy"" or ""Mr. 17.5"". ""I know I ain't there yet, just know I'm gonna be,"" says Jeezy during a rare moment of self-reflection. But where is ""there""? A staid state of survivalism characterized by baseless crowd pleasing or something more dynamic, elusive and ultimately hopeful? The choice is his.","The Atlanta MC's third album is billed as a response to the nation's current economic crisis, but instead finds him appealing to his base: synthetic beats that drop like anvils, ad libs by the freight load, and all-or-nothing punchlines.

"Hummingbird, Go!",Theresa Andersson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca1ea9e61561daa7501/1:1/w_160/c5a2d386.jpg,2008-09-02 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12138-hummingbird-go/,Basin Street,"There's a video floating around the internet that shows Theresa Andersson performing her song ""Na Na Na"" in her kitchen. It's just her, barefoot with denim cuffs rolled up, surrounded by a phalanx of instruments. The clip starts with her playing a few chords on a zither, then pounding out the drumbeat on two toms, then looping the rhythm back as she switches to guitar, keys, singing, and violin. The technique is nothing new or necessarily innovative-- this sort of looping is fairly common in indie pop-- but Andersson the one-woman-show makes it look as easy as playing Rock Band. And possibly more fun. Of course, it's not easy. ""Na Na Na"" is carefully instead of casually constructed, taking the limitations of this approach (no room for solos or much spontaneity) and casting them as limitless possibilities. Most of her third album, Hummingbird, Go!, was recorded in that very kitchen and similarly builds from the drumbeat up, whether she's playing it herself or sampling from another source. ""Na Na Na"" changes very little from YouTube to CD: It still turns on a gently insistent hook and Andersson's bright vocals, although the saxophone on the album version sounds superfluous. Still, give her credit for daring to show the seams of her songs. Andersson is an anomaly of sorts: Born in Sweden, she moved to New Orleans in the 1990s, where she has recorded off and on ever since. Her first album was Dixieland jazz; on a later EP she switched to Louisiana blues-rock similar to early Lucinda Williams. The degree to which Andersson has reinvented herself might imply she has no musical center or, worse, that she is an opportunist, but Hummingbird, Go! instead reveals a musical restlessness guiding her career. The album is all over the place. Immediately following ""Na Na Na"" comes ""Clusters"", which crafts a strange, soft backdrop-- not unlike that recent Silje Nes album-- for a loving ode to her garden, finding the perfect melody for terms like ""butterfly oxide"" and ""cerulean tulips."" ""Birds Fly Away"" skitters on a skipping beat (courtesy of Smokey Johnson's ""I Can't Help It, Pts. 1 & 2""), handclaps, and backing vocals that suggest ""ornate Motown production"" without actually trying to sound like an ornate Motown production. That hint of R&B reappears in the short ""Introducing the Kitchenettes""-- nothing but sha-la-la-la's and woo-woo-woo's-- and ""Hi-Low"", in which the falsetto Kitchenettes comment on Andersson's playful vocals. ""Japanese Art"" is a showtune in search of a show, with the singer's vocals turning brassy and bold like a slightly dialed-back Liza Minelli. ""Innan du Går"", a Swedish-language duet with Ane Brun, is muted and graceful, a whisper among laughs, while ""God's Highway"" with Tobias Fröberg is a more accessible folk-rock song that gives them a tender melody on which to hang their harmonies. Traces of her jazz and blues-rock past remain, such as the exuberance of her Dixie-klezmer fiddling on ""Japanese Art"". These elements add splashes of unexpected color to these songs, bringing the extroversion of those styles to the too often introverted genre of indie pop and making Hummingbird, Go! sound to big for any kitchen to contain.","Born and raised in Sweden but based in New Orleans, Theresa Andersson's career seems guided by a musical restlessness. Early albums focused on blues-rock and Dixieland jazz, while this latest effort flits from indie pop to showtunes in search of a show to the sound of vintage R&B.

Crippled Lucifer (Ten Psalms for Our Lord of Light) / What You Don't Know Is Frontier,Burning WitchAsva,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9eabf31b7dc7155d77/1:1/w_160/f35d1199.jpg,2008-09-02 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12137-crippled-lucifer-ten-psalms-for-our-lord-of-light-what-you-dont-know-is-frontier/,Southern LordSouthern Lord,"Over the past few years, Sunn O))) have become synonymous with the concept of ""art-metal."" At best, the idea suggests that heavy, guitar-based bands are thinking creatively about how to sound more brutal than their forbearers-- recording vocals inside a coffin, for example; or warping the five-minute Black Sabbath dirge into a 15-minute-long, beatless storm of frequencies admittedly engineered to induce defecation. At worst, the idea nourishes a well-established sense of superiority over metal's fans: One New York Times headline addressing the so-called trend read ""Heavy Metal Gets an M.F.A.""-- a title whose cleverness kicks in only if you believe that people who like heavy metal are not only stupid and unimaginative, but poor, too. The idea's crowning irony, though, is that most art-metal practitioners seem more indebted-- and endeared-- to their vulgar cousins than, say, art-pop groups or underground rappers. No volume of style-section garbage can cover up the fact that Sunn O)))-- a band co-founded by former Burning Witch guitarist Stephen O'Malley-- stakes their reputation on monoliths of noise called ""Helloween"" and ""Bass Aliens"". And when asked if 2004 was a good year for metal by the website Lords of Metal, Asva principal (and former Burning Witch and sometime Sunn O))) bassist) Stuart Dahlquist said, without irony, ""No, Dime[bag Darrell, of Pantera] got killed""-- the party line. In an interview from 2001, Stephen O'Malley described Burning Witch's two EPs-- recorded between 1996 and 1998 and collected on Crippled Lucifer-- as ""slow, heavy music playing around with time."" On 1996's Steve Albini-recorded Towers, the band finishes only five songs over 47 minutes, demonstrating not only stubbornness, but alien restraint. Every note is choked; every crevice between is pulled taut and splattered with feedback. Songs bottom out minutes before stopping. Vocalist Edgy 59's lyrics plunge into familiar forms of loneliness and self-destruction, but he sings them with the sustained hysteria of someone boiling. He could make a dessert menu sound unpleasant. Like great horror movies, Towers doesn't just play with time, it punishes it for moving too fast. Shock-- quick, cheap, and explosive-- is subjugated to duration, which is meant to be agonizing. When I talk to friends about what compels me to horror movies, I bring up the scene in Dario Argento's Suspiria where a girl falls into a pit full of barbed wire: Seeing her fall gives me a jolt, but it's watching her try and crawl through it that takes my breath away. And while time-- specifically, their commitment to distorting it-- is of the band's essence, its real innovations are in syntax: the way riffs fit together and songs are structured. While 1998's Rift.Canyon.Dreams contains more boilerplate, blues-influenced heavy metal riffs than Towers, they cycle at odd intervals, collect extra notes from nowhere, stretch, and spiral. By drifting back toward an established vocabulary, the band is able to play off listeners' expectations: If Towers is a foreign language, Rift.Canyon.Dreams, like Deerhoof or Captain Beefheart's music, is a familiar one tortured and scrambled to reveal new definitions-- a dictionary for much of what followed them. After Burning Witch disbanded, Stephen O'Malley formed Sunn O))) with Greg Anderson, and bassist Stuart Dahlquist formed Asva with help from Burning Witch drummer B.R.A.D. Like Sunn O)))-- but unlike Burning Witch-- Asva is a band whose music prizes tone and atmosphere over composition. That's not to say that Dahlquist isn't traditionally musical-- he is, staunchly. But compared to O'Malley's near-clinical austerity with Sunn O)))-- at times, an exerise in charting every gradation between extremely heavy and unbearably heavy-- Dahlquist's approach sounds homely, almost arcane. What You Don't Know Is Frontier, his second full-length, is a testament not to metal's extremity, but to its epic grandiosity-- a trait that sometimes aligns it more closely with 19th-century opera and Ennio Morricone soundtracks than hard rock. The imagery conjured by the album is lonely and pre-civilized: cliffs, lightning, animal-on-animal fighting-- the Awesome, as defined in books featuring God. WYDKIF is humane, almost personal. Dahlquist even allows the occasional groove to foment. But only for a second, and with absolutely no smiling. Grooving-- and all related looseness-- has no place on long journeys into the void. But even if light-heartedness isn't what draws listeners to epic metal, seriousness has limits, and sometimes, Dahlquist finds them. At least the music stays gorgeous, the compositions well-structured, and the musicianship-- from members of Secret Chiefs 3, Mr. Bungle, and Earth-- excellent. Dahlquist's ear seems to have gotten broader since 2005's Futurists Against the Ocean, too: instead of leaning on rock-combo brutalism, he stakes his compositions on delicate percussion, wordless vocals, and quilts of sine waves. It's like he just realized there's more than one shade of gray. Asva makes extreme music, but I wouldn't call it avant-garde by any stretch-- its passion is too familiar, its forms too recognizable. (It's worth adding that the title comes from a poem written by Dahlquist's brother, former Silkworm drummer Michael, who was killed in 2005-- a continuing trauma that has been a professed influence on Dahlquist's music.) They say the true aesthete can marvel at the beauty of the waves even as they drown-- a sentiment Dahlquist, unquestionably a feeler, would probably echo. For all the chatter about ""heady metal,"" it's nice to hear a musician managing to stand apart from his genre without much thought at all.","

Images of Sigrid,Poni Hoax,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca4eb335119a49ecce8/1:1/w_160/6f80c9d3.jpg,2008-09-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12141-images-of-sigrid/,Tigersushi,"Poni Hoax submit another species of French electronic cool, a far cry from today's universally celebrated Daft Punk and Justice. They favor a pewter-dark take on disco to all the neon stagecraft and cut-and-paste primitivism of their fellow countrymen: instead of bright-lights, big-city fare, you'd call this a music of the grubbier districts, of the alleyways and cabarets. The enigmatic single that announced this new species, 2006's ""Budapest"", only partly prepared us for their new release, Images of Sigrid. That song oozed a kind of Slavic menace-- though you could spot hints of the Philly International in those darting, impudent strings. The same twinges of darkness, not just disco, are everywhere on this record. They're in Franco-Cambodian frontman Nicolas Ker's voice, a lusciously creepy instrument that descends from the house of Nick Cave and Bryan Ferry. And they're in that Italo glisten, a cool wind felt in the more mechanized compositions. You even find them, literally, in the album art: cheerleaders who appear to inhabit a Nietzschean abyss. This loopy pall drops across the length of Sigrid. No doubt the title of the lead single ""Antibodies"" gave the game away. Addressing the deathless subject of germophobia in the club, Ker sings in staccato spurts that mimic the faltering synths and rock guitars, as if he's tiptoeing obsessive-compulsively over sidewalk cracks, before raging out, in a flare of mental liberty, through the piano-pounding chorus. The follow-up single disorients in a different way. The screech of synths that open ""Hypercommunication"" call to mind receipts printing, before slinking into the decadent squelches of Goldfrapp-style keyboards. Outside of the singles, ""You're Gonna Miss My Love"" and ""Pretty Tall Girls"" number among the record's stronger entries. There's a sharp edge in these tracks that may remind listeners of post-punk. In fact, most of the record luxuriates in some form of 1980s malaise. (The track that rang in this whole affair, ""The Paper Bride"", manages the feat of welding German motorik and downtown skronk.)  Lucky for us, this adventurousness never turns self-serious: a song called ""My Own Private Vietnam"" is less Gus Van Sant meets Michael Herr, perish the thought, than kitsch meets glitch. The band sails with ""Faces in the Water"" to a startlingly soothing finale. Morrissey acolytes will delight in the slow burning (13 minutes!) melancholy, but those who came to dance may balk at the radiantly sedate, Eno-worthy comedown. But the care that Poni Hoax takes in these complicated dances of emotion and genre, as they restlessly strut between Human League impressions and Donna Summer tributes, assures there'll be something for everyone here. Whether these are glitter-ball tunes for the sulky eyeliner set, or vice versa, is beside the point. These gothic grooves will comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Images of Sigrid is just that perversely good.","French outfit on Tigersushi offers a darker, grittier take on dance-pop; instead of bright-lights, big-city fare of countrymen like Daft Punk and Justice, theirs is music of the grubbier districts, of the alleyways and cabarets.

Slime & Reason,Roots Manuva,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb2c0084474cd0c2b45/1:1/w_160/66f1bed3.jpg,2008-09-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12154-slime-reason/,Big Dada,"Maybe it's just the phonics of Rodney Smith's rap handle, but listening to Slime & Reason, I keep coming back to the word ""ruminative."" Though ""I'm not a rapper"" has been mostly co-opted in the post-Jigga era by young turks who place T-shirt design and ""the grind"" (i.e., selling/annoying you with their demo on the streets) above working on their rhyme skills, it sorta fits the bill in a non-pejorative way for Roots Manuva's thoughtful, almost didactic slow flow. He talks in a manner where he either says the first thing on his mind or he plays with it internally for far too long, a frustrating combination of writer's block and an overactive brain. Not surprisingly, Roots' output has more in common with Wu-Tang than Weezy-- just four albums since 1999. As such, Slime & Reason tends to work best when it's straying far from a typical rap record. ""The Show Must Go On"" should be a sonically harrowing account of a radioactive nuclear family, the narrator watching his wife and child evacuating the premises as he drunkenly stews in his own piss. But in between long stretches of pained R&B vocals, Roots sounds like a specter hovering above the situation, still shellshocked at how far gone things are. The same goes for ""2 Much 2 Soon"", which breaks down his ambiguous role in hip-hop with the bemusement of a bored kingpin: ""Bouregouis hippies wanna fight my flow/ I'm wishin' I was a Trustafarian/ I wouldn't have to hustle and I wouldn't have to swear at them,"" he moans. Beyond the expository tracks, the most successful parts of Slime & Reason are those that break completely from a rap template. There's always been a dubby influence on Roots Manuva records, but here, there's a distinct bhangra/dancehall vibe coming from 2-step producer Toddla T that's reminiscent of So Addictive. ""Do Nah Bodda Mi"" in particular works with a very Timbaland-ish earworm hook, while ""Buff Nuff"" surprisingly turns out to be something other than a rewrite of ""Fit But You Know It""-- taken in context of its Benny Hill-summoning video, it's a welcome reprieve from what is usually an oppressive stoneface. But while Manuva's unorthodox style is a unique pleasure, too often his flow can be laconic to the point of being subliminal-- a good portion of Slime & Reason's midsection demands attention, but doesn't necessarily deserve it, not when the beats that support his rhymes are just-below-scale like the budget g-funk of ""Kick Up Ya Foot"". Too often, the claim of British rappers getting lost in translation has more to do with impenetrable slang, but for those familiar with Run the Road or even the Bug's atomic London Zoo, Slime & Reason can fail to hit on a visceral level. Which is why the mental fisticuffs of ""Well Alright"" becomes all the more alluring-- you can hear equal parts defiance and sarcasm when Manuva boasts ""I push my pen and blend in with big spend-ahs"" before likening himself to Jesus (because ""God's my dad"") and summing up his career (""I ate with the devil but I still ran back to God""). Ruminative is all well and good, but even when Manuva stays rooted, the thrills on Slime & Reason come from a maneuvering mind.","Here on his fourth album, UK rapper Roots Manuva is at his best the more he breaks from a traditional rap template.

Everything That Happens Will Happen Today,David ByrneBrian Eno,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcafeb335119a49ecd01/1:1/w_160/28ad7f26.jpg,2008-09-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12151-everything-that-happens-will-happen-today/,self-released,"There's nothing like a nice surprise from musicians you love. In 1981, Talking Heads frontman David Byrne and producer Brian Eno united for one of the most fruitful partnerships of the post-punk era to release My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, a groundbreaking record that made prominent use of sampled soundbytes and disembodied voices in place of singing. The album, recorded between sessions for the Talking Heads' essential Remain in Light LP, was released with surprisingly little fanfare, yet pioneered and popularized methods that have since become part of our musical lexicon. Last April, Byrne revealed that the partnership would be revisited for the first time in 27 years, for another full album. But while Everything That Happens Will Happen Today reunites this iconic duo, the record shares almost nothing in common with its predecessor-- down to the process. Where My Life in the Bush of Ghosts resulted from hours of close collaboration, the self-released Everything That Happens occured when Eno asked Byrne to add lyrics and vocals to a number of tracks the producer had created independently. The two began passing tapes back and forth, and then onto a series of session players and studios until the record was complete. Described by the duo as ""electronic gospel,"" the album is a beautifully melodic, unpretentious offering-- and nothing whatsoever like its predecessor. One of the first sounds here is an acoustic guitar-- an early sign that this is a very different sort of album from those these two have made together in the past. The disc opens with one of its strongest songs, the expansive ""Home"", fitting the duo's description. Byrne sings long, drifting phrases to lyrics that temper domestic nostalgia with a bit of honesty. His outlook here is generally positive-- or maybe more accurately, tinged with hope or determination: ""Chain me down but I am still free,"" he sings on the catchy chorus to the fluid ""Life Is Long"", as Eno's arrangement incorporates understated brass and a wall of keyboards that burst with melody. Most of these tracks are strikingly immediate, considering the relaxed creative process that brought them to fruition. ""Strange Overtones"" has a great shuffling beat with a hooky bassline and a giant chorus-- Byrne sings directly about the process of songwriting, mulling what a chorus should do even as he sings it. It's the kind of effortless pop song Talking Heads might be playing today if they'd stayed together. The album does have a few less satisfying moments, though, which tend to come when the easy flow of the music is disrupted. The buzzing synth hook and plodding beat of ""Wanted for Life"", for instance, feels somewhat out of place amid the billowing textures that surround them, and the echoey, spoken passages of ""I Feel My Stuff"" are plain awkward. Still, it's a welcome release from this duo-- the kind of assortment that makes one hope they don't stop here. Byrne will be touring this material without Eno, but hopefully, as Eno accumulates more tracks in the future, he'll remember the off-handed brilliance of this album's best moments and pick up the phone. Whether we're talking about this record in 30 years the same way we talk about My Life in the Bush of Ghosts today is of little consequence-- it's an enjoyable listen in the here and now, which is all an album has to be, even when created by giants.","Not a follow-up (or even a cousin) to their groundbreaking 1981 record My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, this surprising and rewarding pop record has been described by its creators as ""electronic gospel.""

(Daughtry, on the other hand, is playing a Foreigner song at both conventions.) And so, with the Republican National Convention on their home turf, Minneapolis collective Doomtree's eponymous debut is well timed if nothing else. Doomtree are about as politically correct as any hip-hop collective: Rolling as deep as the Supreme Court, they're multiracial, multigender, they flow in Spanish sometimes, and a guest emcee called I Self Devine even has a line about mock duck. Though they don't trash talk specific politicians much (as crew member P.O.S. said on his 2006 Rhymesayers' effort Audition: ""First of all/ Fuck Bush/ That's all/ That's the end of it"") the group is hellbent on venting their frustrations with corporations and the wealthy. And yet, even folks without 18 leftie bumper stickers on their cars will find it hard not to get caught up in the group's enthusiasm. Mostly forsaking the punk of Audition, Doomtree's beat-makers, led by Lazerbeak and Turbo Nemesis, are focused on updating golden-era structures to get the listener hyped-- particularly, ""Drumsticks"", ""Game Over"", and ""Liver Let Die"". At the same time, the production is nimble enough to pull back when it needs to, such as on the jazzy ""Last Call"", which recalls the narrative, working-class moments of Atmosphere's latest, touching on everything from lesbianism to pool sharkdom to alcoholism to waitressing. But like many liberal firebrands, Doomtree don't spend much time with anecdotal narrative, quickly returning instead to class warfare and conspiracy theories: ""I sense a set-up through the bent antennae settling/ Federally approved amphetamines Ephedra peddling,"" claims Sims in one example. If you're a ninth-grader living in St. Paul, Doomtree will be your shit, but when the politics here turn preachy, you'd be forgiven for wanting a bit more balance between the two.","P.O.S. and the rest of this Twin Cities collective make for great left-wing politics, but even those voting McCain might find it hard not to get caught up in the group's enthusiasm and golden-era sounds.

Laughter,Rahim,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9cea9e61561daa74f8/1:1/w_160/195032bb.jpg,2008-08-29 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12136-laughter/,Pretty Activity,"Since they debuted with 2005's Jungles EP, Rahim have imbued the anxious sounds of 1990s D.C. post-punk with a twist of pop savvy. The New York-based quartet skipped over the scrappy, unpolished debut album that's so common to indie bands. They were together for a few years before they released Jungles, but judging solely by their discography, they seem to have emerged fully formed. This developmental glitch is apt for a band so obsessed with the vagaries of evolution. Many bands spend their 20s exploring emotional states, placing themselves at the exact center of the universe. Rahim take a broader, more aloof view, regarding their lives as blips in a vast, chaotic system. Instead of friends, enemies, and lovers, they only see architecture rising and falling-- civilizations, too. It's not that the emotional is absent in Rahim's music, they simply don't give it much credence: ""My friends are beautiful, but they all know/ That they're all accidents..."" Evolutionary developments, not emotional ones, are the pendulum they use to mark time. ""500,000 years on land/ 500,000 years and we grow back again."" Rahim's position is essentially amoral: If everything's an accident, no one's accountable. But their finesse with these weighty themes makes them more than nihilistic; they strive for meaning even as they reject it. The ceremonial ""Vision"" makes an oblique case for human continuity. A verse about atavistic rituals sets up a chorus that's worth quoting at length: ""Each change in my world/ As the sea has changed before/ I remember every word in my simple way/ Frenzied as we were/ Did we see this view before?/ I remember without benefit of vision."" Even if existence is an accident, we can still locate patterns, echoes, and connections. These moments, when Rahim discovers traces of value in the process of tearing it down, are redemptive. Laughter's musical light-footedness also helps its ponderous themes go down easier. Singer Michael Friedrich's slightly nasal voice is a bit like Elvis Costello's, and he wraps it around surprisingly mobile melodies, making this the rare post-punk record that you can hum. The band's guitar parts are spiky and spangled, but avoid the genre-pitfall of rigidity; they actually swing a bit, in periodic surges and glides. Tactful horns, synth washes, and vibraphones ruffle the limber yet ironclad core instrumentation like faint updrafts. Instead of variations on clangor, we get genuine diversity: ""The Same"" drones majestically, ""Tired Man"" slouches with the aid of wheezy synths, and ""Of Course"" shaggily unfurls. Rahim seem to take the same bird's-eye view of their albums as they do of history. They have perceived Laughter as whole and enlivened it, strategically, with inventive embellishments. Drummer Phil Sutton deserves a lot of the credit on this score-- he's great at dropping in a few agile clicks or subtle cowbells to unobtrusively color or complicate a rhythmic structure. One of the album's best moments comes on ""Cities Change"": on the last word of the verse, the whole band goes ""woof"" as the drum pattern retreats to the rim, making a pivot that slingshots us into the chorus. (""Woof"" sounds silly on paper, but it really does sound awesome on the record.) It's kind of funny that, despite Laughter's evolutionary themes, its merits owe equally to its intelligent design.","While imbuing the anxious sounds of 1990s D.C. post-punk with a twist of pop savvy, this New York-based quartet take a broader, more aloof view in terms of lyrics, regarding their lives as blips in a vast, chaotic system.

"In the 7th Moon, the Chief Turned Into a Swimming Fish and Ate the Head of His Enemy by Magic",Kasai Allstars,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca2eb335119a49ecce3/1:1/w_160/2b516f35.jpg,2008-08-29 05:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12139-in-the-7th-moon-the-chief-turned-into-a-swimming-fish-and-ate-the-head-of-his-enemy-by-magic/,Crammed Discs,"Kasai Allstars hail from the same traditional/electric Kinshasa music scene as the better-known Konono No. 1. Stylistically and sonically, they're an obvious cousin of that band, building their songs around amplified likembés (thumb pianos), thudding percussion, circular rhythms, and vocal chants. Kasai Allstars add clear-toned electric guitar and xylophones, with as many as 20 musicians participating on any given track. Whereas Konono's members are all from the same tribal group, the Bazombo, Kasai Allstars include members of five different ethnic groups, incorporating the traditions of all five. The result is predictably more varied in terms of melody and overall feel-- the underlying rhythms also tend to be slower and more complex, especially with so many interlocking parts. This is the third volume of Crammed's Congotronics series-- the first was a Konono No. 1 album, and second a compilation of many artists that included both Konono and Kasai Allstars. It undoubtedly has the year's coolest title, and it shares the only genuinely unfortunate aspect of other audio recordings of this music, which is that you can't see the dancing it accompanies. This doesn't make it less enjoyable, just less complete. At any rate, it takes about 30 seconds to hear how special their sound is on this album as the xylophones and likembés lock into a haunting minor key figure, the percussion hammers away to propel the call-and-response chanting and the ethereal guitars dance weightlessly on top. It gives the sense of a constantly descending chord progression in spite of the fact that cycles continuously back to its starting point. Once you get into the overall sound, the joy of listening to the record is in the search for the details, the intricacies of how the music is arranged and played. The slit and resonator drums tend not to be rhythmic drivers so much as accents or even lead instruments. At a moment of rhythmic tension, a hard staccato phrase on the deepest drum (which, as I understand it, often signifies a change in the dance) triggers a subtle shift-- musically, it's a similar function to that of the pitched drums in Senegalese mbalax music. One of the album's most stunning extended moments, though, may actually be ""Tshitua Fuila Mbuloba"", when all the instruments go silent for an a cappella passage. Over the course of the song, voices unite and then disperse into a polyphonic choral movement, following in a strong choral music tradition in Kasai-- check Les Troubadours du Roi Baudouin's Missa Luba album on él Records for a different take on it. This album is a vital addition to the Congotronics series, and anyone who's enjoyed the series so far needs to hear it. For beginners, Konono No. 1 might serve as a more natural point of entry-- that group made the world stage first because of its immediate parallels with rock and funk, whereas the average Western listener will probably have to listen a little harder to understand Kasai Allstars. That said, you won't have to listen too hard to get it, as it's very naturally enjoyable music, it just comes from a different mindset structurally. At any rate, it's an excellent, diverse recording that adds a fantastic new chapter to an already fascinating story.","Hailing from the same traditional/electric Kinshasa music scene as the better-known Konono No. 1, Kasai Allstars also build their songs around amplified likembes (thumb pianos), thudding percussion, circular rhythms, and vocal chants, but they also add electric guitar and much more, with as many as 20 musicians participating on any given track.

Moody Motorcycle,Human Highway,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca5c0084474cd0c2b28/1:1/w_160/e820e693.jpg,2008-08-29 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12142-moody-motorcycle/,Secret City,"Human Highway, the collaboration between singer/songwriter Jim Guthrie and Nick Thorburn (of the Unicorns and Islands), took their name from a Neil Young country-rocker, so it should come as little surprise that Moody Motorcycle is a collection of genial, acoustic folk-rock, full of high harmonies and peaceful, easy feelings. Breezy platitudes abound (""Got nothing left, but it ain't bringin' me down/ I'm just gonna follow the sound"", Guthrie sings.) The closest you're getting to perplexity on the album's first few songs is when Thorburn yawns, on ""Get Lost"": ""Woke up early/ That's so unlike me."" The acoustic guitars drifting gently in the background reinforce the impression; this is prime beach music, best accompanied by a shit-eating grin and a good beer buzz. Jim Guthrie (grandson of Woody, by the way) played with Thorburn's main project Islands for a while, and the two have a nice chemistry. Their keening two-part harmonies, channeling the spirit of folk-rock duos past, provide the most obvious evidence; yet you can also witness their intuitive bond in the lilting rhythms of the songs, which rise and fall with the naturalness of contented sighs. Throughout Moody Motorcycle, Guthrie and Thorburn seem to be anticipating each other's movements, and the effect is both soothing and absorbing. This cozy familiarity bleeds into every song, however, which works against the pair when they try to darken the mood. The title track, for instance, aims for brooding loneliness, managing instead only a glamourpuss pensiveness. Their cover of Billy Taylor's ""I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free"" (more famously covered by Nina Simone) drains the song's seemingly bottomless well of sadness and urgency. And as far as tributes to Santo & Johnny's still-beguiling 1959 instrumental ""Sleepwalk"" go, the version here (""Sleep Talking"") has nothing on Modest Mouse's classic reimagining. Sometimes, Guthrie's chirpiness is grating; when he brightly announces, in ""What World"", ""I eat too fast, all these foods I've made up/ Till the real ones all taste rotten,"" he sounds like Ralph Wiggum. And a few of the tunes (""The Sound"" is the biggest offender) feel like castoffs from Guthrie's sideline as a jingle writer. ""Ode to Abner"", on the other hand, conjures a glowing intimacy with just two minutes and a few beatifically sung, evocative couplets (""I was born in November/ In a small town/ I don't remember""). Human Highway work best in this inviting, flickering-campfire headspace, and for an amiable if ephemeral 40 minutes, Moody Motorcycle offers a pleasant soundtrack to the dwindling days of the summer.","Human Highway, the collaboration between singer/songwriter Jim Guthrie and Nick Thorburn (of the Unicorns and Islands), took their name from a Neil Young country-rocker, so it should come as little surprise that Moody Motorcycle is a collection of genial, acoustic folk-rock, full of high harmonies and peaceful, easy feelings.

Los Angeles,Flying Lotus,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc97abf31b7dc7155d64/1:1/w_160/d4213170.jpg,2008-08-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/,Warp,"Hip-hop's earliest records often relied on faded, scratchy source material run through entry-level equipment. Even as technology advanced, the grain and the gristle stuck around-- sometimes out of necessity, sometimes as an extra ingredient. Over time, those aged, decaying sounds burrowed their way underground to crop up in pockets of IDM, dubstep, and indie hip-hop, resulting in music, built around texture more than bass or treble, that often sounded ragged at birth. With his second album, Flying Lotus (aka Steven Ellison) has mastered this texture. Los Angeles is filled with the crackle of static, but there's something about this ambient noise-- a nuisance to audiophiles, a sign of weakness in radio signals-- that feels oddly comforting. Rather than audio damage or interference, this deceptively entrancing record (stick with it, it's a grower) feels like nature; it's almost as though Ellison went out of his way to digitize and filter the sound of rain hitting a sidewalk to accompany its beats. Opener ""Brainfeeder"" bristles with sharp rattling taps, while ""Breathe. Something/Stellar STar"" transmutes it into boiling-water burble, and even the 1960s sci-fi foley-room chatter on the 43-second ""Orbit 405"" is underpinned by snarling, distorted, pre-amp buzz. It sounds less like an album built on damaged, beat-up, pre-existing vinyl loops than a clean, shiny new LP put through four decades' worth of wear and mishandling. The static, of course, is just a single (if crucial) ingredient in the character of Los Angeles: What this album relies on specifically is the way that crackle and buzz reacts to the rhythm at the core. Flying Lotus shares passing similarities to the late J Dilla and fellow Cali beat creator Madlib in the way he puts together his beats, and it's not hard to hear touches of James Yancey's Ummah-era production tricks infused with the same off-kilter slipperiness you might find on a recent Beat Konducta release. And in Ellison's hands, these tricks are stridently odd where they could have been safely derivative, revealing a deep affinity for psychedelic lushness and digital distortion that puts him in his own class. Los Angeles is also prone to letting its beats hang loosely in the air. Ellison often slips empty space inside the rhythm (another place where the ambient static comes in handy), and even when the tempo accelerates past the album's typical leisurely pace and finds itself driving a track packed with wall-to-wall bass, little of it seems hectic or jarring-- even the jittery tweaker-electro of ""Parisian Goldfish"" smoothes out into a pleasant pulse once it sets in. At its most stirring moments, the music can be soothingly meditative, though the booming low-end, sharp drums, and all that crackle and fuzz keep it from sounding too polite. With its accomplished fusion of debris and warmth in a place somewhere between b-boy head-nod and laptopper experimentalism, Los Angeles is a big step forward for a still-young career, an album well worth revisiting years from now-- preferably on vinyl, where the pops and clicks can only multiply.","Sharing passing similarities to two of modern indie hip-hop's top producers, Madlib and the late J Dilla, L.A.-based Warp recording artist Flying Lotus has created a darkly meditative fusion of debris and warmth, b-boy head-nod, and laptopper experimentalism out of static, texture, and rhythm.

The end result had the feel of leaner, glitchier jazz fusion. You half-expected a Weather Report homage to come next. No such luck. On Thorns, Beans goes back to puffing himself up as the ""Ornette Coleman of this rap shit."" He sees himself as a maverick, a straight-talking deviant with zero respect for his art form's commercialism. And it sure beats ""I'm the John McCain of this rap shit."" Fiercely talented and out-there as he is, Beans isn't cutting a path into the vanguard, nor is he cooking up some landmark union between rap and Mbuti water music. The MC is simply good at what he's good at, putting together bushy, crooked beats with rhymes that are both confessional and evasive. Before Antipop Consortium temporarily called it quits in 2002, they all but invented this brainy style, assuming their name because they saw pop as a straitjacket: the freedom they sought for hip-hop, as 2002's accurately titled Arrhythmia attests, wasn't far in spirit from Ornette's all-bets-are-off vision of free jazz. Here Beans taps artists with the same joyful impatience with smooth surfaces. Ghostly International producer Dabrye sets the tone, sculpting ""Thundermouth"" out of malfunctioning, grocery-scanner blips and looped strings that, with their brittle energy, call to mind a horror movie score. A posse of Casio-wielding improvisers from Toronto, Holy Fuck, lend a very Antipop twitch of chaos into three tracks. From the campy Nintendo bass lines (""No Thrills"" and ""Sudden Death Academics"") to the buzz-saw synth tones (""Razor Boss""), it's as if the band jury-rigged the whole affair, E.T.-style, out of household gadgets and children's toys. All this ragged innocence plays well against the moodier raps. The darkest of the lot, ""No Thrills"", goes on the warpath against G.O.P. ""family values,"" the hunt for Osama, and unappreciative black hip-hop heads -- an all-over blitz held together by Beans' outrage and Holy Fuck's low tech anti-arrangements. His own creations, stylistically, stay closer to classic Antipop with a twist. ""MVP"" may be the exception, the way it takes the chintzy ambience of a low-budget soap opera -- kitschy harps, syrupy licks, comically synthetic strings -- and applies it to a self-deprecating love letter that never takes itself too seriously. Texture is king, for the most part. But the open spaces, found between the flutes and flutter of ""Fingers"" or in the a capella ""Best of the Losers"", leave more room for his blazing, lava-thick phrases to take center stage. Thorns proves that Beans can smoothly career between maximalism and minimalism when he's in his element, building on the sci-fi slam poetry heritage he created with High Priest, M. Sayyid, and Earl Blaize.","MC, Antipop Consortium member, and self-described ""Ornette Coleman of this rap shit"" returns with an album of bushy, crooked beats with rhymes that are both confessional and evasive.

"Alas, I Cannot Swim",Laura Marling,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9aea9e61561daa74f1/1:1/w_160/e03a86b7.jpg,2008-08-28 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12134-alas-i-cannot-swim/,Virgin,"The fact that bracing Brit-folk singer/songwriter Laura Marling was just 17 when she recorded the Mercury Prize-nominated Alas, I Cannot Swim has become every much the bit of biographical shorthand as mentioning Lily Allen's famous dad or Robyn's late-90s U.S. stardom. It may seem at first unfair given how many pubescent rockers come down the pike, but artists who mine a folkier, more personal vein, like Marling or Conor Oberst or Patrick Wolf, do tend to open themselves up to greater scrutiny-- yet are also more readily rewarded with touts of prodigal genius. Such clearly heard, lyric-driven music almost can't help but assume an aim towards profundity regardless of its actual goals. When such striving stumbles, we call it ""precociousness"" and assume the neophyte will continue to hone his or her introspective powers with each passing year. But is this always a good thing, to encourage a young artist of deep feeling to continue burrowing more deeply? The thing I worry about with Marling is that she's already being heralded for evincing wisdom beyond her years-- what happens when the years catch up? Will she feel compelled to keep turning more and more starkly inward, and sacrifice her charm in the process? Lyrically, Alas is a sober document, but its best songs don't demand an abundance of explication or poetics to work their sad-eyed magic. Liking Marling best when she keeps things at the level of teenage romance may sound reductive, but young love is one of pop's bedrocks, and clearly the young songstress can tap into reservoirs of immediacy that a team of balding middle-aged guys crafting expert teen-pop chart-toppers can't as easily manage. As a vocalist Marling may evoke the grown-up weariness of Beth Orton, but the superior first half of Alas is consumed with depictions of decidedly youthful ardor, whether it's the young man in ""Ghosts"" who ""went crazy at 19"" from his inability to escape the memory of past loves, or the general teenage fatalism conveyed in ""Old Stone"" and its refrain, ""10,000 years and you're still on your own."" Marling flashes wit in ""Failure"" in her realization that a once-worshipped rock singer's ""songs were pathetic,"" and the accompanying music of the album's first act admirably matches her heart's cynical but still intense effusions, whether it be the tense gallop of ""Ghosts"", the swelling melancholy strings of ""Tap at My Window"" or the genuine electric momentum of ""You're No God"". Almost perceptibly ""maturing"" before our ears, however, Marling spends much of the record's second half mired in vague symbolism and unfortunate logorrhea, with her music frequently seeming to grind to a halt from the strain. That's not to say Marling lacks the facility to put across complex thoughts and feelings, only that she needn't confuse wordiness with depth, which is just the sort of thinking that leads to groaners like ""the gods that he believes never fail to amaze me"" or ""the sky and I, we've had our fights, and I'm coming 'round to rain,"" which damn near ruins the otherwise lovely and gripping ""The Captain and the Hourglass"". It was a mistake for Marling not to find a place on Alas for ""New Romantic"", a song from an earlier EP that ended up lending two thoroughly inferior tracks to her debut long-player. Instead of the gothic stiltedness of ""Night Terror"" (which has nothing to do with cobras, sorry), ""New Romantic"" finds Marling bemoaning her ""lonesome gait,"" but also worrying about things like being thin and turning into her mother in far more pragmatic terms while reminding us (and herself) that ""I'm still pretty young."" Hopefully, 90s baby Marling will remember there's nothing wrong with this assertion for at least a good little while.","Promising Brit-folk singer/songwriter finally has her Mercury Prize-nominated Alas, I Cannot Swim-- recorded when she was just 17-- issued in the U.S.

Angles,Dan Le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9babf31b7dc7155d6e/1:1/w_160/e01f316b.jpg,2008-08-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12135-angles/,Strange Famous,"If you're an American reader familiar with the British hip-hop duo Dan Le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip, I'm willing to bet one out of two things tipped you off: you saw that ridiculous name starting the Friday slate at Coachella and wisely chose to sleep in, or you got forwarded a YouTube for their signature track, ""Thou Shalt Always Kill"". From here on out, you can assume I'm speaking without hyperbole-- ""Thou Shalt Always Kill"" is the sort of song that makes me borrow something first said about ""My Humps"", namely that it transcends merely being horrible music and places itself into the realm of pure evil. A wanna-be novelty hit if there ever was one, it consists of Scroobius Pip (yeah, that's the rapper's name) rattling off a litany of ""ooh...countercultural!"" broadsides (examples: ""thou shalt not buy Coca Cola products,"" ""Bloc Party [they're] just a band"") that assume absolutely no intelligence from the listener. It's a bizarre target audience this thing courts-- people ""elitist"" enough to sneer upon corporate brainwashing, yet simple-minded enough to surrender themselves to the ethos of Scroobius Pip. If it stopped there, maybe they could be brushed off as a minor annoyance, but then Pip sets the scene for the rest of Angles with this: ""Thou shalt remember that guns, bitches, and bling were never part of the four elements and never will be."" (Never mind that a minute earlier, he deifies Johnny Cash, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix-- good luck finding no-good women and violence in their songs.) Now, it's bad enough when we hear KRS-One go off on tangents like this, but at least he made Criminal Minded, which included for-the-ladies chestnut ""The P Is Free"" and had the Teacher GRIPPING AN A-K ON THE FUCKING ALBUM COVER. Dan Le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip, on the other hand, have Angles, one of the most musically bankrupt and altogether philosophically fucked albums you'd be wise enough to avoid this year or any. It's one of those rare occasions where you'd rather them just go with the whole ""let's take it back to '88"" shticks-- we could just shove them off to the sidestage at Rock the Bells and get on with our lives. But as ""Fixed"" boasts, ""Dan Le Sac versus Scroobius Pip! Here to fix hip-hop, the best we can"" (trust me, it's way funnier to hear than in print). How's that? Well, by jacking ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"", the lone celebratory track from one of the decade's most introspective and compelling rap records, and turning it into a demand that hip-hoppers stop trying to make pop hits and instead ""be smart."" And remember that it's ""art."" While there have been plenty of well-considered arguments that look inward at the genre and demand more of its practitioners, more often than not, it's from the perspective of an artist concerned about banking off the advancement of self-defeating racial stereotypes. Here, it just lays down an incredibly awkward subtext as to why the rest of ""pop"" (read: black) hip-hop owes it to these guys to straighten up and fly right. Did the era Sac and Pip constantly glorify not have just as much, if not more ""dumb"" party music? Just imagine some asshat telling the Fat Boys that ""Wipe Out"" was killing hip-hop. Mealy mouthed Pip apologizes, ""We think there are some great artists out there, don't get me wrong,"" but judging from Angles, it's entirely unclear who the fuck they could be possibly be talking about. OK, rap needs to be smarter. But apparently it, uh, needs to sample ""smart"" bands such as Radiohead like these guys do. For those interested, ""Letter From God to Man"" shits out ""Planet Telex"" undigested, a completely artless grab that flaunts none of the nuance of the Roots and Kanye West when they bit from Thom Yorke. Mind you, these are two popular acts. Way to go, Pip. To be fair, Dan Le Sac tries to be game here, pulling glitch-hop from its staticky grave with cut-up acoustic riffs that sound like that one time I tried to sample Iron & Wine's ""Woman King"" over a breakbeat and it ended up like Kid Rock (don't ask). An instrumental Angles wouldn't be intolerable. But it's all ruined by Pip doing his Oliver Twista thing all over it-- because he's so smart, he's gonna enjamb as many words as possible into his verses despite the fact that his complete lack of breath control has him sounding like a pre-teen Victorian bootblack halfway through every line. ""I'm not an alcoholic/ I just drink a lot/ I'm a genius/ Or maybe I just think a lot""-- this is how the second verse of ""Development"" begins before Dan Le Sac mercifully cuts Pip off, castigating him to get on some new shit before he can embarrass himself any further with this train of thought. But he soldiers on-- ""I'm not trying to bore you/ I'm just tryin' to be a good role model for you."" This comes immediately after an entire verse that quotes from the periodic table and right before he tells you who his role models were-- Chuck D, Rakim, and, of course, KRS, who should probably make it up to PM Dawn by having Prince Be bumrush the show during their next festival appearance. It's bad enough that these guys pretty much owe their career to Sage Francis (now there's a guy in touch with the roots of this shit) and try to present their version of music as hip-hop in its purest form, but as ""Back From Hell"" pounds your face like Eminem's worst productions at 245 bpm, Pip spits ""when I get back from hell again/ I'm gonna be so elegant/ The relevance of my benevolence is evident."" Yup, looks like Party Fun Action Committee didn't ether Paul Barman after all, and now he's back with Mike Skinner's accent and the entitlement of a New Yorker subscriber.","Fucking hell.

Forth,The Verve,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca813d197565213b38e/1:1/w_160/861d8779.jpg,2008-08-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12145-forth/,On Your Own,"Despite the fact that Verve singer Richard Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe share a mutual regard that's more Sting and Stewart Copeland than Hall and Oates, or that it's been nearly a decade since the Wigan-based group was last functional, their reunion was a pretty easy call. You could take the succession of cheese-scented flops known as ""Richard Ashcroft solo albums"" as evidence. You might also see the appeal of being a British band that makes epic-sounding symphonic pop at a time when Coldplay are basically the biggest rock band in the world. Really, though, the reason is more elemental-- something everyone from Jay-Z to the Spice Girls knows is true: No self-made messiah can exist without a resurrection. Of the top-tier Britpop-era heavyweights, Oasis catch the most flak for delusions of grandeur, but all they ever really wanted was for people to sing along in adoration: It's hard to imagine Noel Gallagher writing a song for any reason other than single-minded devotion to 1) hugeness, or 2) the chorus. Ashcroft wants you to sing along, too, sure-- but he also wants to heal, soothe, and illuminate. What else could the parting skies and emergent God rays on Forth's cover mean but that He hath returned? To be fair, musically speaking, about half of Forth is as good as the band's commercial breakthrough, Urban Hymns-- and, if you consider the general hit/miss ratio of decade-removed comeback albums, that's actually a pretty respectable showing. It also helps to explain why at least some of the British press have met this new record with typically effusive praise: the soft bigotry of low expectations. (Granted, the Verve's two earlier records were actually a lot more interesting than Urban Hymns, but that's ancient history now.) The most useful thing about Forth is the mirror it reflects back on us now. In 1997, this kind of thing-- crisp, echoing guitars, provincial strings, existential moodiness-- actually sounded kind of exciting. Just over a decade later, though, the exact same recipe, prepared exactly the same way, conjures up new dominant aftertastes: false profundity, compositional laziness, and outsized egos. What changed? Is it just that we now have better access to more and wider varieties of music? Is monoculture dead? Are big-label bands with these sorts of impulses the dinosaur rockers of the 00s? Maybe it's just that Forth seems so telegraphed and formulaic that its most awful moments, like the watered-down space-rock of the seriously appalling ""Judas"" (sample lyric: ""New York, I was Judas/ She said a latte double shot for Judas"") or the toothless blues jamming on the interminable ""Noise Epic"" (on which Ashcroft, uhh, raps), end up weighing heavier than the album's highlights. Those hoping to find the Verve in full-on cloud-parting mode may be able to plug comfortably into songs like ""Sit and Wonder"", ""Rather Be"", ""I See Houses"", and ""Valium Skies"", but even these tracks feel simply like safe, calculated throwback exercises. Ashcroft wants this to be his holy hour, but to many of us, it'll sound a lot longer than that.","The second Verve reunion album, released 11 years after the last one, finds them still trying to be the biggest band in the world-- and still failing.

However, even in its natural habitat (say, Bomp! Records ca. 1999), 2 would still sound exhausting and redundant. It's not like these guys don't have potential either. For what it's worth, Mark E. Smith hand-picked frontman Tim Presley and bassist/singer Rob Barbato to work on the Fall's Reformation Post TLC, and Presley, along with ex-Distillers drummer Andy Granelli, cut his teeth in cult hardcore act the Nerve Agents. The problem lies more in the band's miscalculation of its skills. Even for their somewhat narrow field of vision, Darker My Love are all over the place, tracing psych-rock through each of its incarnations since the 1960s. Despite their lyrical focus on L.A.-inspired imagery and existential meltdowns, DML sound surprisingly British. Presley's chirpy vocals offset the droning riffs on ""Blue Day"", emulating the limp fist-pump perfected by muscular shoegazers like Ride or Swervedriver. ""Pale Sun"" is practically a dance song, looping its Madchester bassline around a heavily harmonized-- though hardly memorable-- melody. Yet while it's possible DML may be taking a stab at British understatement, they're more likely aiming for a certain idealized California coolness-- and coming up short in the process. ""Talking Words"", featuring the line ""Baby you got me talking words,"" provides 2 with a much-needed sense of humor, but the song's merely a rehash of ""Bohemian Like You"", which was merely a rehash of...well, you get the point. If Presley and Barbato could just muster some semblance of a threatening sneer, their effects pedals wouldn't have to die in vain. Sadly though, most of 2 relies on slow burners and underwhelming soundscapes intended to overwhelm. The ""freakouts,"" if you can remain awake for them, typically consist of additional strings, additional wah-wah, or a baffling mixture of the two. The prolonged outro to ""All the Hurry and Wait"", which piles crest upon crest of cymbal splashes and reverb leads, especially proves how safe and easy a supposedly subversive genre like psych-rock can be. If DML had merely wanted to serve up psych/shoegaze fan fiction, it would've at least been an understandable move. But they had to go ahead and muck it up with pompous codas and celestial posturing, all without any sort of backbone to hold the whole mess up.","With 2, a slightly louder, more expansive re-imagining of their 2006 debut, L.A.'s Darker My Love continue pushing slick, devil-may-care psych rock, meticulously modeled after like-minded Californians who've either exhausted their dangling-cigarette cool (B.R.M.C.), pissed away their potential (Brian Jonestown Massacre), or simply never had much hope in the first place (the Warlocks).

Ancestor,T.K. Webb & The Visions,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc90ea9e61561daa74da/1:1/w_160/948ce92d.jpg,2008-08-27 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12124-ancestor/,Kemado,"Dutiful research tells us that Thomas Kelly Webb has been rocking and rolling for a long time, since his then-tiny fingers could first flip through Jimmy Page's mighty riffbook. Since relocating from Kansas City to Brooklyn in the late 1990s, Webb has developed a name downtown for his fire-breathing guitar heroics, laying lonely Delta sounds to tape but often busting amps and heads when the dedicated come to see him plug in and make with the shred. But anyone ready to hear more of the empty suitcase blues that inhabited Webb's previous outing, 2006's Phantom Parade, should prepare for a superfuzzed-out departure of redwood-sized proportions. Ancestor is the fitting title of Webb and his newly christened Visions' first offering. Formed last summer, the Visions feature ex-members of Love as Laughter and Blood on the Wall, the most noticeable addition being second guitarist Brian Hale. Alongside the Visions, Webb's sound and songwriting vision (not intended) have taken a King Kong leap towards achieving a breadth that mirrors his talents, even if the result occasionally misses its mark. Maybe it's not such a leap after all. From the first few groans and juggernaut kicks of opener ""Teen Is Still Shaking"", it becomes clear that Webb has come back to his first love: hard rock. Ancestor is a Porterhouse-thick compendium on rock: From the golden 1970s to the muddy 90s, J Mascis to Kim Thayil, leather to denim, David Allan Coe rebel honky-tonk to Paul Westerberg's scrappy white boy blues, Webb is all over the map here and much of the album's fun is found in spotting footnotes, every lick and flourish arriving to as much sweet bewilderment as many of the pop snippets sewn together on a Girl Talk party jam. If you're a guitar rock junkie. If not, Ancestor's still impressive. Though he flirts dangerously with rock's pitfalls, Webb's developed a strong ear for fusing all these elements and styles together his own way without coming off like a cornball. This, from a man with a catcher's mitt voice like Mellencamp's (Don't run! It's awesome!) and a gift for radioactive solos that could both unzip dresses and leave shiners. Two of said solos bookend the monstrous ""God Bless the Little Angels""; more sensible men would probably place an eight-minute study in psychedelic uppercuts somewhere in the waning breaths of an album, but the Visions switch to kill fairly quickly. ""Patience & Fortitude"" is a great name for an acoustic sigh that requires both, while ""Isle of Grizzly White"" and ""Shame"" feel like throwaways unable to subsist on faceless crunch alone. Which is precisely why closer ""Time to Go"" saves the day by showing some restraint. Clocking in at just over three minutes but still containing all the lard-less dreamweaving you'd expect, it's a nice parting gift that even features vocals from Love as Laughter's Sam Jayne. Webb's dalliances with purist blues were a respectful, accurate channeling but this feels more like home. Where Phantom Parade tapped that vein so specifically, Ancestor opens floodgates similar to the giant door that sits front and center on its cover.

Swimming,French Kicks,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf913d197565213b43b/1:1/w_160/ecbf7cd5.jpg,2008-08-27 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12211-swimming/,Vagrant,"Garage punks French Kicks have lit on a sound that is boldly, authentically, uniquely their own. Those adverbs have run their course, but here they describe a young band's maturation from victims of their scene and prisoners of their studio into a band willing to tinker with composition and to savor accident. Gone is the hip shtick of past outings, each riff and melody weighed down by polish and forethought. Now they've realized that fucking up is part of art. Rock'n'roll is all about romance and instinct, they say, and about the possibility of being betrayed by both. You have to risk it, risk error. As an Irish writer rightly assured himself: Mistakes can shove an artist toward discovery. The French Kicks discovered that they can peer inward. Maybe they're no longer burdened by the pressures to be a New York Band alongside the Strokes and the Walkmen, or by some duty to radiate tragedy and defibrillate post-punk. Production plays a large part in the band's turn to richer, larger emotions. Mixing and producing their new album, Swimming, has enabled them to wring truth and wrest intimacy from the sterile, unromantic process of music making in the laptop era. They bid adieu to the high-tech sheen of 2006's Two Thousand. It's a bravely nostalgic turn, to curb the impulse to digitally cut, paste, and Ctrl-Z your work until a radically reworked seventh take seems immaculately conceived. And that is how it seems. Swimming channels the medium-voltage jolt of the French Kicks' recent live appearances: not too much, not too little. Easing down a middle path, ""Abandon"" wipes away the memory of the New York bandwagons, and replaces it with rock's version of the way of all flesh: the ""growing up and mellowing out"" record. This is the rare case where this doesn't translate into soul-swallowing boredom. There's irony in the song title, as this Brooklyn lullaby is short on rebel wildness. But in another way, the title hits the target: The band is abandoning abandon. No more of that secondhand scorn of well-heeled kids trying to ape the Stooges or Gang of Four. Here the sass is concentrated in that pointy, chiming guitar line, only to be washed out, like a splotch of marinara, by the onrushing harmonies. Post-punkers who warm to ""Abandon"" will take to the equally jagged ""Love in the Ruins"". The cavernous bump of the percussion has not only a human warmth, courtesy of the roomy recordings, but a solidity that balances out all the weightless surroundings. Like clockwork, the bass drum tramples and thwacks, while the Talking Heads nod ""Carried Away"" soars and glistens. Along the same lines, swinging stick-work firmly grounds the Beach Boys breeze wafting through ""Atlanta"" and ""Said So What"". As Josh Wise and Nick Stumpf swap time at the microphone, their earthy falsettos-- evoking both a backwoods longing (""All Our Weekends"") and an urban malaise (""The Way You Arrive"")-- accomplish the bipolar task of launching the songs skyward and rooting them in the soil. Thick with both a springtime twinkle and autumnal heartache, Swimming makes good on the band's early promise. Trading layers of mood and melody and meaning for layers of Pro Tooled artifice, French Kicks have razored off the bullshit, leaving a core of beguilingly honest tunes.",,7.6,
Woodpecker OST,James Lavino,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9413d197565213b367/1:1/w_160/87f6a99d.jpg,2008-08-27 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12128-woodpecker-ost/,Brookhaven,"At this point, most people acknowledge that there's indie rock-- music produced without corporate financial backing-- and Indie Rock, a corporately funded mainstream genre that's defined by normative musical aesthetics, not ideology or actual practice. The same idea carries over to indie film. There's a festival and art-house circuit that's essentially Hollywood's shadow, governed not by artistic and financial freedom but by its own internal hierarchies and genre trappings. A number of tiresome trends have infected this circuit in recent years, including a cynical approach to ethnic and identity politics to garner perfunctory acclaim, condescending caricatures of rural types, and the accumulation of quirks and non-sequiturs in lieu of credible characterization. The first thing you notice when you visit the website for Woodpecker, a new film by Alex Karpovsky, is that it's been burning up the indie festival circuit-- it has more garlands than an ancient Roman senate. To me, this sets off warning bells, which are not stilled by the film's plot summary-- bird watching enthusiasts (ding) converge on a small town in Arkansas (ding ding) to search for the elusive Ivory Billed Woodpecker (DING DING DING!). Right there, you've got idiosyncratic milieu and risible rednecks, not to mention a light existential allegory-- and, bonus, a tie to Sufjan Stevens. But despite these misgivings, this seductive, subtle soundtrack makes me want to see the film. Woodpecker was scored by the notable choral and concert music composer James Lavino, who has a few prior soundtrack credits (including Karpovsky's The Hole Story). Its players include Radiohead's Colin Greenwood (whose prior soundtrack work is limited to a credit on his more experienced brother's Bodysong OST) and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Sargent brothers, Lee and Tyler. Each track matches a scene in the film-- e.g. ""The Gift Store"", ""The Haircut""-- to one simple, complementary theme. The melodic impact of each theme is bold but reserved; the music's discretion increases its quiet allure. The only real drawback to the soundtrack is that it's rather slight. We get 15 themes in about half an hour, and most of them are strong enough that you wish they'd go on a bit longer. The record conjures the magical feeling of the forest, the coolness of stream-cooled tree shade, the peaceful sensation of walking on pine needles. The music more resembles a hummingbird than a woodpecker: It lightly hovers and flits. The tone is established from the start-- ""The Thing With Feathers"", a synthesized dirge that evokes woodwinds, with dreamy acoustic guitar chords rolling through-- and remains unbroken through the twittering chimes, house backbeat, and Spanish guitar of closing track ""The Bird Suit"". The soundtrack stays interesting by complicating a single mood with multiple genre allusions. ""How to Look at a Bird"" is smoldering lounge-noir. ""The Gift Store"" is arpeggiated folk. Tambourine and enchanted guitar flourishes give ""Raising Pigeons in Phoenix"" a trippy spaghetti western feel. ""Peeling Bark"" is sugar-coated blues, ""A Powerful Need"" is a shimmying Latin dance, and ""Rediscovery"" is twangy country. Lavino and company have stripped away all the context from these genres and rendered them as sonic wallpaper, which is appropriate for a film score and surprisingly satisfying on its own. There's no rawness in their blues, no pain in their country, no ideology in their folk, no drugs in their psychedelia, no sex in their samba. As such, the focus shifts to the fineness and restraint of the playing and the imagistic potency of the themes. It's difficult to imagine the Sargent brothers playing on this: CYHSY aren't exactly known for their subtlety, and the Sargents seem especially Ritalin-deprived when performing live with that band. Here, they're calm and deliberate instead of eccentric and frenzied; hopefully the film (which has yet to hit theaters) applies the same judicious energy to its potentially over-the-top concept.","Radiohead's Colin Greenwood and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Lee and Tyler Sargent add their talents to this soundtrack, penned by notable choral and concert music composer James Lavino for Alex Karpovsky's indie-fest hit.

"Tea Parties, Guns and Valor",Truckasauras,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8213d197565213b33d/1:1/w_160/c755cf21.jpeg,2008-08-27 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12111-tea-parties-guns-and-valor/,Virgin,"We've got the champagne on ice for the day the word ""hipster"" finally kicks the bucket. Until that day comes, though, there's no shortage of people willing to go down with the ship, criticizing indie rock fans who refuse to abide by some passé codification of the black t-shirt wearing Lou Barlow disciple that avoids fun and hip-hop with equal tenacity. These people probably already have their minds made up about Truckasauras. They might even be preparing to misuse the term ""ironic"" to slag off the Seattle collective. And why not: The band presumably takes its name from a ""Simpsons"" episode so old that most us have forgotten it. The album's title and cover evokes fellow ""are they seriously serious with this kid stuff?"" act The Go! Team. The video for ""Fak!!!"" is doctored to look like the Ultimate Warrior is fellating Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania. And to top it off, there's a track on Tea Parties, Guns & Valor named after the famed NES Konami code-- something that'd already been done to death by the time even the Deftones finally got around to it two years ago. Truckasauras' biggest obstacle, though, is their choice of instrumentation-- Commodore 64s, decades-old software, and various 8-bit components. The trend is reaching its tipping point: Over the past few years especially, countless bands, producers, and remixers have mined these archaic electronics for laughs, gimmickry, or to amp up the kind of electro tracks that have recently run rampant on mp3 blogs. What's different about Truckasauras is that they take their cues from artists like M83 and Boards of Canada, constructing fuzzy-warm nostalgia from previously disposable parts. And while they don't quite reach the stratospheric heights of, say, Music Has the Right to Children, their task is arguably tougher. Surprisingly accessible and mellow without reverting to wan psychedelics, this record's closest sonic embodiment might actually be WALL-E. It's as cartoonish or resonant as you want it to be, often relying on little more than suggestive beeps and primitive futurism to convey a core of positivity with just enough implied melancholy to chase it down. There's only one heel-clicking blissout, and even that retains a strong sense of momentum. Recalling the playful electro-pop of Super Furry Animals' Guerrilla, ""Angels Sound Like Bottle Rockets"" rides a nasal bassline while panflute-ish synths contribute interlocking counterpoints in a moment that embodies the album's M.O.-- it's deceptive headphones music with compositional depth that's evident once you realize that those Nintendo engineers weren't just fucking around. It's a groove they could ride out longer, but at the moment where it feels like the track could burst, Truckasauras drop the top and reveals quasars of chimes amidst clap-happy drum machines. On the other side of the spectrum, ""Ain't No Danbo (When He's Gone)"" rattles along to an 808 pattern reminiscent of Organized Noize's strip-club bangers while a pedal steel-like effect does a lonesome whine underneath. Like anything else here, it's completely open to suggestion-- not quite instrumental hip-hop, yet too melodically focused to be considered straight-up techno. Closer ""Porkwich"" has an evocative melodic turn that betrays its in-jokey title, almost passing for degranulated Fennesz. And ""Fak!!!"" (also, questionable title aside), could easily plateau on its blocky, nearly Arabic chord change, but its hook happens when the track splinters into wildly panned darts of treble. As Philip Sherburne wrote about ""Super Copter"", an astounding cover of the Airwolf theme, Truckasauras make the kind of electronic music best suited for basement parties, but as as a result, Tea Parties flows more like a mixtape than a suite. The collection's few flaws lie in its sequencing-- as the album's lone vocal track, ""Hold On"" is jarringly dropped between ""Angels"" and ""Danbo"". And while there's plenty of killer moments in the remix addendum, at seven tracks deep, it nearly doubles the length of the LP. In the end, though, the idea of this record as a mixtape actually strengthens it-- too often, ""heart"" or ""human"" is lazily applied only to electronic records that feature vocals or acoustic guitars, but Tea Parties, ever playful and ebullient just says, ""here, hope you like it!"" Those that don't might be trying too hard.","Seattle-based collective Truckasauras make music with Commodore 64s, decades-old software, and various 8-bit components, but rather than rely on these materials for tongue-in-cheek gimmickry, they take cues from M83 and Boards of Canada, constructing fuzzy-warm nostalgia from previously disposable parts.

Animals,Minilogue,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8d13d197565213b353/1:1/w_160/be970f24.jpg,2008-08-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12121-animals/,Virgin,"On their debut long-player Animals, longtime 12"" fiends Minilogue settle themselves long enough for electronic fans to get a good look. Like Lindstrøm-- with whom Minilogue share little, if anything else, in common-- the Swedish duo of Sebastian Mullaert and Marcus Henriksson have long favored singles, issuing slabs for Traum, Wagon Repair, and Wir, among others, that feature some combination of minimal, house, and trance. Animals, released on Germany's excellent Cocoon Recordings, flouts the conventions of 12""s, offering four sides of music-- two of traditional Minilogue fare and two dedicated to ambient platters-- that clock in at more than two-and-a-half hours. Animals takes mammoth amounts of dedication, and its rewards come mostly in the form of dark, room-shading atmospheres, no matter the tempo. Minilogue have always seemed a little bit playful-- see their name, a conflation of ""minimal"" and ""dialogue,"" or the cheeky synth-work on their ""Space"" single-- but Animals, apart from its weirdly mesmerizing cover art (and the fact that one track is named ""Giant Hairy Super Monster""), plays things fairly close to the vest. The first disc is the tech-house LP Minilogue fans have been waiting for, and it seeks weedy, murky terrain. It leans heavily towards modern minimal, unleashing deep bass concussions that leaving chalky, muted imprints. Inch the volume too low and Animals is nothing more than a surface twitter, a light frost in your living room. Appropriately leveled, Animals rumbles and ducks; you can imagine the tiny clay bedevilments that adorn the cover art marching in file to ""33000 Honeybees"" or lounging gamely during ""Hitchhiker’s Choice"". ""Jamaica"", the album's best track and appropriate recipient of a follow-up EP, is the duo's sweet-spot: sternum-high bass clutter lays the groundwork for seagull calls and tittering percussion. It is as spunky as the record’s title implies and as winkingly conducted as the duo's prior output. Sequenced like a DJ mix, Animals coalesces into one long under-radar flight. The jazzy keyboard sounds of ""Giant Hairy Super Monster"", the whooshing electronic film of ""Hypnotized"", the jumpy arpeggios of the title track-- all of these are competent, well-executed gestures, but they also feel rote, like Minilogue has a minimal/trance/house checklist and is crossing sounds off. It is strangely unadventurous and staid, blue-collar in the face of the duo's previously toucan garb. The disc-closing ""In a Distance"" and its warm, softly brushed pulses, while drawn from the duo's regular palette, offer the first glimpse of the bog into which the duo wanders. On the second disc, Mullaert and Henriksson take the disembodied tones that float through their work and spread them over long beatless passages; macro photographs of the bass-bass-skitter of the first disc. Repeated notes or the occasional muffled kick-snap offer some measure of timekeeping. It's alien territory, but Minilogue sound neither lazy nor disconnected: ""Old Water"" is a meditative prayer; ""Swamp Op"" makes eyes at cabin fever as a rusty guitar leaks notes; ""Even the Wind Seemed in Deep Sleep"" ends gorgeously, with falling rain and subterranean tones. The occasional clipped dialogue gives the record a sci-fi feel, like Boards of Canada or music from the Ghost Box label. One such clip in ""Six Arms and One Leg"" provides Animals a mantra: ""Strange words in the dark/ And elephants on the wall."" Appropriately disembodied and hushed. Animals is a distended exploration of known sounds and moods-- first through traceable beatmaking and then, strangely, through ambient blur-- and its successes arrive at unexpected times. The second disc is sure to drive some tech-heads bonkers, but it feels breezy and weird after the tightened screws of disc one. Enjoy the whoosh when the band releases the pressure and hope they’ve got more big surprises up their sleeves.","Sequenced like a DJ mix, Minilogue's debut LP offers four sides of music-- two of traditional Minilogue tech-house fare and two dedicated to ambient platters-- that clock in at more than two-and-a-half hours; it takes dedication, but its rewards come mostly in the form of dark, room-shading atmospheres, no matter the tempo.

Small Vessel,SJ Esau,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc895e6ef95969322e7c/1:1/w_160/edbc79ca.jpg,2008-08-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12117-small-vessel/,Anticon,"SJ Esau started his career as a barely adolescent MC in the late 1980s Bristol scene before becoming an electronic/indie songwriter, and Small Vessel is his second album for anitcon. When Esau (given name Samuel Wisternoff), keeps his head and his guitar here on earth, Small Vessel produces more than a few cute, quixotic songs. He merges his sophomoric, not-taking-himself-too-seriously approach to lyrics-- ""I can only be reasonable for some,"" he mews-- with modest (by his standards) studio tinkering: only a few fuzzy loops and peeled strings haunt the background (""Bastard Eyes"", the album's best song), and there's often only a bloated bassline and crackling, steady drum machine for company (""What Happen'd""). These few songs are far from outstanding, but they're at least strong enough to hint at a face behind the sonic experiments. Like hundreds of other paint-, sound-, or word-flingers, Esau in fact does his most resonant and reasonable work when he puts himself inside the neat bounds of convention. It's when Esau indulges himself, and turns his internal aesthetic notches to ""challenging,"" that his strengths and charms run into each other and then run aground, churning out maddening scraps of would-be tracks less than a minute long, compositions sliding into a sort of tweedy discursiveness where parcels of bells and re-wound loops glare like catchphrases repeated and then repeated louder. Esau is smart enough to at least tailor his lyrics to this almost manic obsession with rebooting-- ""The catalyst/ I-den-tify/ And kill!"" But skit-length fragments, no matter how self-aware or tongue-in-jowls they may be, do not an album make. As refreshing as the title track's Decemberists-cum-Why? shanty chant is, it's still only 18 seconds of refreshment. Esau is neither Wire nor J Dilla (though, to be fair, who is?). His attempts to conjure songs or collages of sound in 90 seconds simply will not stick. These shards fall into two categories: microscopic, rote guitar riffs or the DJ doodle that attempts to weld a looped infant cry, the sound of pouring water, and what sounds like a gasp in reverse. The four or five songs actually carried to term have nothing to prop them up. Begging for shape, denaturing under the sheer plethora of contributors (the liner notes have close to a dozen other drummers, cellists, singers, violists-- most of whom stop by for a single song), Small Vessel instead is passively sequenced, naked of thematics (nautical images and self-loathing would be the closest), and does everything in it's power to bury its moments of tranquil success (""Depth Perception Lack"", ""Bastard Eyes"", ""Under Certain Things"") under heaps of artiste futzing. But even those caveats feel inaccurate. Small Vessel's strengths aren't unique; you can find dozens of whimsical, pseudo-surreal songwriters of this ilk (Why?, The Guillemots, Thee More Shallows, to start) who clutter their discs with fewer scribbles and less back-handed flippancy.","Singer-songwriter's second album for anticon. is packed with instruments-- guests play piano, strings, horns, and more-- and styles, with songs that run from Decemberists-cum-Why? shanty chants to abstract sound collages.

Inlandish,Hans-Joachim Rödelius & Tim Story,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7fea9e61561daa74ba/1:1/w_160/0a30fe56.jpg,2008-08-26 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12109-inlandish/,Grönland,"It's almost impossible to ignore the still-fresh imprint that keyboardist and composer Hans-Joachim Rödelius has left on electronic music. The influence of his groups with Dieter Moebius, Cluster and Harmonia (the latter also included Neu!'s Michael Rother), is difficult to overstate. But now, at 74, Rödelius seems just as comfortable plonking out Satie-like piano themes as he is touring the States with Cluster, now ambient celebrities. In the midst of said tour, Rödelius has released Inlandish, his latest collaboration with American composer Tim Story. This time, Rödelius left much of the electronic arrangements to Story, spending only ten days in the studio laying down piano before letting the American elaborate on his themes with neoclassical synths, cellos, and oboes. The result often fronts a certain contemplative neutrality (or as the two composers term it, ""emotionally ambiguous soundscapes""), which might otherwise be mistaken for the pretense of new age serenity. But there's no affected or meditative agenda hidden in the fluttering synthesizers, save perhaps that Story's treatments sometimes borrow a little too much from his collaborator's best works. More often, Tim Story's treatments add a sort of melodic counterbalance worthy of previous HJR associate Brian Eno. It's a stark contrast from their last collaboration, 2003's Lunz, which heavily featured Rödelius' piano work and relegated his American disciple's embellishments to second-chair groundswells. Here, the collaborators let the piano lines form a supple backbone while Story's arrangements continually extend the work: sinuous synthetic flesh built upon a delicately evolved frame. And while Cluster and Harmonia were always known for their centripetal force, wrapping tight progressions around ever-changing repetitive themes, Rödelius melds his best ambient works with a patience gleaned off his looser works of the 1980s and 90s. Each piece unfolds methodically, each pulsating rotation of Rödelius' theme sloughing off another layer of Tim Story's arrangements, themselves playing out like the elegant evolution of a rock or blues solo. The ""rock thing"" is a funny observation, since Tim Story says that Rödelius came to his attention just as he was searching for an alternative to rock music. But Inlandish certainly carries within it a rockish underpinning-- at the very least, consciously acknowledging post-rock luminaries like Tortoise as well as their progressive rock ancestors. It's intriguing that Rödelius and Story are perceived as guys who try to breathe life into a form that protests the cold rock'n'roll machine, because it seems like Tim Story is sometimes playing pop god with his German collaborator's delicate essence. While it's true that he sometimes overpowers his subject and crushes that little spark with dated beats (""Riddled"") or melodic fusions of new age and ambient forms (""Downrivers""), the two composers nurse their supple little creation, their fragile little life form, charged with the empirical DNA of the same electronic figures Rödelius once revolutionized.","The latest collaboration between Cluster and Harmonia visionary Hans-Joachim Rödelius and American composer Tim Story is a meld of neo-classical and ambient composition that both soars and stumbles.

In Flesh Tones,Azeda Booth,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc83abf31b7dc7155d32/1:1/w_160/60a0e4eb.jpg,2008-08-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12112-in-flesh-tones/,Absolutely Kosher,"Consider the lullaby: sets simple melodies to simpler rhythms; sounds twinkly; native to habitats as diverse as the music box, the mobile, and the matronly au pair; makes babies sleepy. Synonymous with being soothed and coddled. Makes adult humans sleepy too, which presents a problem for bands who want to avail themselves of the lullaby's somnolent power while keeping their audience alert. Because you know, when someone says that a band puts them to sleep, they don't usually mean it as a compliment. Azeda Booth's solution is to render lullabies on the scale of anthems. The Calgary, Alberta, quintet's starry meditations for laptop, synths, and guitars are as delicately formed and colored as soap bubbles, yet they drift with a paradoxically leaden sense of weight. They've created a signature sound that is both idiosyncratic and durable enough to sustain a whole album: Each track on In Flesh Tones is comprised of chirpily androgynous vocals (with hints of subterranean soul), ice-baths of beatific mood, and insistently sputtering glitch tracks that thread a thin wire of urgency through the indeterminately unfurling melodies. In Flesh Tones should appeal to fans of the laptop-ier side of Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins (specifically, Adore), the Notwist, and Broken Social Scene-- maybe imagine an album's worth of ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl""-- but these comparisons are insufficient, and this is a crucial part of Azeda Booth's appeal. At a time when many popular bands' touchstones can be divided without remainders into Blogger tags, there simply isn't anyone doing exactly what these guys are doing right now. From the first fluctuating tones and galloping, hard-panning snares of ""Ran""-- even before the first airy gusts of singing appear-- you feel yourself immersed in a profoundly intuitive musical vision. Intuition seems to govern the songs' general movement as well as their particulars-- they are meandering yet memorable, a rare combination. Forget progression, this is osmosis. The syncopated lope of ""In Red"" flattens out into halting flourishes on the one-beat so gradually that the transition is all but undetectable. ""First Little Britches"" is a marvel of loose cohesion, with drifting refrains subbing in for verses, ambient tone beds for bridges, a few well-placed, shaggy claps for choruses. Furthermore, the individual tracks blur into one another cunningly-- the frictionlessly skating chords that open ""Big Fists"" seem shaken loose from the shuddering electronic drum circle that caps ""Numberguts"". This meandering quality might put off some listeners, but to my ears, Azeda Booth have figured out how to reconcile pop music's infectiousness with ambient music's nebulous aura, and have produced one of 2008's most unique and immediately pleasurable albums.","Albertan band's starry meditations for laptop, synths, and guitars are intercut with glitches and topped with ethereal, androgynous vocals, resulting in an album that combines pop infectiousness with ambient music's aura.

Astrological Straits,Zach Hill,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc93abf31b7dc7155d5a/1:1/w_160/e3df6005.jpg,2008-08-26 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12127-astrological-straits/,Ipecac,"Anyone familiar with the drumming of Hella's Zach Hill-- a relentless, octopus-limbed style that has earned him three different gear-endorsement deals-- might expect his solo debut to be a one-man parade of kick-drum barrages and cascading toms. And though he employs many collaborators on Astrological Straits (including members of No Age, LCD Soundsystem, and his Hella colleagues), the album can feel like one endless drum solo. Hill's torrential beats roll over everything else-- even his own voice and guitar-- puncturing each song like bullets fired into a balloon. Whether that's good or bad depends on your tolerance for skull-crushing polyrhythms. But even the most gun-shy listener should find something to dig in Hill's frantic beat-marathons. At its best, Astrological Straits is a mashup of Liars tribalism, Boredoms bombast, Smell-scene art-punk, Lightning Bolt repeti-grooves, and Frank Zappa prog-overload. All this sonic hyperactivity can be exhausting, and Hill's fondness for effects, especially in his Vocoder-ish vocals, makes some tracks robotic, more like exercises than songs. Take ""Uhuru"", a spastic drum workout that's almost all muscle. If Guitar Center had a weight room, ""Uhuru"" could be its muzak. But for every ""Uhuru"", there are tracks filled with angled melody and odd sonic invention, creating more than the sum of their multiple drum parts. The best example is the three-song stretch that precedes ""Uhuru"". ""Hindsight Is Nowhere"" sprints around the stereo spectrum like a HEALTH song in a hall of mirrors, with Hill declaring ""You can twist the arm of fate/ It will bend but it won't break"" in semi-Angus Andrew moan. The next two songs, ""Ummer"" and ""Stoic Logic"", feature Dean Spunt and Randy Randall of No Age, and they're the album's most melodic, with simpler rhythms and sparkling guitar. As Hill chants imperatives-- ""cut lines in your palms with the night like you own it""-- dreams of an expanded No Age with Spunt on guitar and Hill on drums are irresistible. The rest of Astrological Straits probably won't inspire dreams, but its pummeling energy might at least get you seeing stars. Even when Hill makes questionable moves, like blurting clichés on opener ""Iambic Strays"" (""That's my name/ Don't wear it out"") or ending with an indulgent prog-metal blast featuring Primus' Les Claypool on bass, his music exudes a geeky charm. And his final gambit, a bonus one-track disc, is a total winner. After a spoken intro by Marnie Stern, ""Necromancer"" delivers 30 minutes of high-level free-jazz in duo with Brooklyn pianist Marco Benevento. Time to dream again: Here's a vote for Hill to move to New York and start playing jazz. His unstoppable drumming would surely fit in well with that city's vibrant improv scene.","Hella drummer enlists No Age, members of LCD Soundsystem, Marnie Stern, and Les Claypool for his solo debut, which features hints of Liars tribalism, Boredoms bombast, Smell-scene art-punk, Lightning Bolt repeti-grooves, and Frank Zappa prog-overload.

Producers Paul Epworth and Jackknife Lee put their own distinctive sonic marks on the band's first two studio albums, but both made big, universal sounds rather than personal ones: Epworth's work on Silent Alarm introduced the group as cold and harsh, while Lee's A Weekend in the City was brash and flourescent-- a better fit for the band, even as singer Kele Okereke's increased candor has saddled his songs with clumsy, self-pitying lyrics. Still, thanks to the enduring goodwill they earned with that first album and their super-serious attention to craft, it wasn't unthinkable to view Weekend as their October, an endearingly awkward transition between a bracing debut and a masterpiece every bit as outsized as the ambitions of its creators. Sadly, album number three is less War than Evil Urges. In a recent interview with Pitchfork, bassist Gordon Moakes admitted that Bloc Party haven't toured much of the album yet, and as a result, much of Intimacy feels overthought and underwritten, its jack-in-the-box studio effects attempting to cover for a lack of substance. Where ""Like Eating Glass"" and ""Pioneers"" steadily built towards barely controlled chaos with unpredictability and positive tension, ""Ares"" engages in all-out sonic warfare: Russell Lissack's guitar blares like a air raid siren, Okereke's vocals gets processed into Cheez Whiz, and if the rhythm section was in the studio at any point during the recording, you'd need surveillance videos to prove it. The same goes for the garish lead single ""Mercury"", which at least sticks due to the nagging repetition of its pie-eyed hook. Though Lee and Epworth share production credits, it's obvious who Bloc Party is casting their lot with; maybe it's the quick turnaround or a desire to see Intimacy in a better light, but it's easy to judge this as Another Weekend in the City: The B-Sides. With its lulling arpeggios and hushed chorus, ""Biko"" (not a Peter Gabriel cover) feels like an unfinished demo of the band's own ""Uniform""-- precisely the point where their last record went south. Where Lissack and Okereke's guitars once pierced with precision, the riffs of ""Halo"" and ""One Month Off"" haphazardly stack sixteenth-notes in search of the right angle. And while Okereke isn't as stuck on the minutiae of his hangovers, his romanticism still often results in clunky poetry-- the live-wire fritz of ""Trojan Horse"" is immediately short-circuited by bad Robert Smith karaoke (""You used to take your watch off before we made love/ You didn't want to share our time with anyone""). Another issue lies in the sequencing, as the record's second half shows more promise: ""Better Than Heaven"" hurtles through a steely echo chamber into Intimacy's only satisfying rockout, while the endless headrush of ""Ion Sphere"" proves the band can be epic without dozens of guitar overdubs-- a lesson lost on ""Zephyrus"", which hides Bloc Party's weakest tune yet under drum machine clatter. And like some sort of fever dream from 2005, ""Signs"" dreamily offers sweet nothings over a combination of Illinois interstitials and an ebullient synth pulse. It's gorgeous, but with all those bells and chimes, how could it not be? Even as the highlight of Intimacy, it's still evidence of an overarching problem plaguing the band, going from the implied, tightly coiled menace of the prophetically titled Silent Alarm to Protected-by-Viper obviousness. While Okereke has described Intimacy as a break-up album, it feels like more of a document of a band disconnected from itself. Bloc Party's area of expertise as of late seems to be gloopy love songs, and their increased willingness to leave behind the spiky post-punk of Silent Alarm should conceivably only help them. But it's almost like they're embarrassed about it, or at least regretful that they've paved a path that can only allow them to get bigger. Rather than exploring depth, detail, and texture, the band puts their willingness to experiment in the hands of Lee, a rock producer, and like his charges of the past (Snow Patrol, R.E.M., U2), Bloc Party is encouraged to delve into electronic music in only the most arena-ready terms possible. Credit the band with being too restless to just rewrite ""Price of Gas"" 12 times-- we're just hoping they're bold enough to realize that songs like ""Ion Sphere"" and ""Signs"" prove they're now closer to next making Adore than War.","We hoped Bloc Party's last record, A Weekend in the City, would be the group's version of U2's October-- an endearingly awkward transition between a bracing debut and a masterpiece every bit as outsized as the ambitions of its creators.

Back to the Cat,Barry Adamson,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc845e6ef95969322e74/1:1/w_160/8a5a6016.jpeg,2008-08-25 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12113-back-to-the-cat/,Central Control,"A few records back, Barry Adamson opened an album with a song called ""Cinematic Soul"", a phrase that seems destined to go down as the best way to describe his extensive solo discography. It captures what he does at least as well as another phrase sometimes used to describe his work, ""soundtracks for films never made"" (he's done some actual film work, too-- see David Lynch's Lost Highway). Either way, Adamson, who's spent a fair amount of his career in music as a sideman for Nick Cave and also played bass for Magazine in the late 1970s, follows his own script in his music, trends be damned. This unfortunately means that he's likely to work forever under the radar, but it seems that, with his dark songs that spend their time exploring life on the wrong side of the tracks, he'd rather have it that way. It's harder to get away with murder in a crowd, after all. Back to the Cat, Adamson's ninth album, is one of his most pop-friendly records, emphasizing compact, melodic songs that still bear the mark of his twin senses of humor and the macabre. It opens right in his wheelhouse, with the jazz noir gutter ballad ""The Beaten Side of Town"", complete with a horn arrangement topped by a muted trumpet and a flute hook. Like most of what he does, the song has a great feel-- you can sense the air between the notes, and the temperature of that air is cold. The cinematic soul tag fits like a glove, as it does a few tracks later on the instrumental ""Shadow of Death Hotel"". With a creeping funk beat, dramatic, occasionally dissonant horn section, and burbling Hammond organ, it's like a tossed salad of John Barry, Henry Mancini, and David Axelrod, with a number of great harmonic substitutions and surprises, including a short flute solo. The horn section turns up on nearly every song, and the arrangements are usually inventive. ""Walk on Fire"" does well expanding on the feel of ""Shadow of Death Hotel"", coming off like the theme for a future Bond movie with its strings, horns, and dueling guitar parts, one of which drops surfy lead lines while the other cranks out a ""Shaft""-y chicken scratch. Even the title sounds like something Ian Fleming would've dreamed up-- either way, it'd be a kickass soundtrack to a tense game of mahjongg with a supervillain. In amongst all the moody material are two surprisingly boisterous pop songs, ""Straight 'Til Sunrise"" and ""Civilization"". The former matches a swinging, carefree beat and Adamson's cabaret-like vocal to lyrics about an irremediable breakup that may have crossed the line to murder-- the song also balances chilly passages topped with a police siren with an instrumental bridge straight out of Burt Bacharach's dreams, with vibes and a smooth-as-silk horn section. ""Civilization"", meanwhile, is a catchy pop tune that casually slips out lines like, ""I wandered through a wasteland that was passing as a glimpse of Heaven's door."" It's great to hear Adamson harness his talent for creating atmosphere to punchy, immediate songs like this. When he cheerfully sings ""People/ They're no good"" on ""People"", it makes an instant impression, and even when the album wanders a bit it still feels good.","Ninth album by one-time sideman to Nick Cave and member of Magazine balances Adamson's cinematic approach to soul with a punchier pop sensibility.

Lose Big,Eef Barzelay,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7babf31b7dc7155d1f/1:1/w_160/1da420cd.jpg,2008-08-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12105-lose-big/,429,"After six albums, a couple of EPs, a major-label misadventure, a fleeting moment in the primetime spotlight, and a fresh start with a new indie imprint, one hopes Eef Barzelay would take his own go-for-broke advice: ""If you're gonna lose then/ Might as well lose big then,"" he sings on the title track to his new album, Lose Big. Unfortunately he's chosen instead to take his cues from the record's Eeyore-esque opening number, ""Could Be Worse"": ""Please forgive me if I leave you feeling uninspired,"" Barzelay wearily mewls, ""my only pleasure is to make that bubble burst."" Knowing the Clem Snide leader's fondness for super-sized irony, he might just be tweaking fans' expectations, or playing up critics' claims about his purportedly pro-forma folk-rock. Sadly, that withering couplet could serve as an honest-to-goodness apology for what Lose Big has to offer. Even at his most esoteric and flippant-- for example, writing from the point of view of a hip-hop video dancer with aspirations for medical school, or talking about love in terms of sweatsuits and ankle sprains-- there's an earnestness in how Barzelay catalogues idiosyncratic details. On Lose Big, Barzelay eschews such scenic routes for a more straightforward tact, and it does him no favors. Cutting to the quick makes Barzelay's sentiments sound disingenuous and crass, especially on ""The Girls Don't Care"", where he offers lovelorn hipsters some words of wisdom regarding the fairer sex-- ""Don't listen to Frank Zappa/ Play Coltrane, Faust, or Can...the girls just want a sweet melody."" The song tries to let itself in on the joke by closing with a half-ass rave-up, the sort of self-indulgent move the ladies purportedly don't fall for. It's a fitting trick ending for a track that's not half as clever as it wants to be. Less showy songs fall prey to the same missteps. The heavy-handed condemnations of ""How Dare They"" are leaden enough without Barzelay adding obnoxious nudging distortion to the track's graceless stomp. ""Apocalyptic Friend"" aims for grandiose poesy about the end of the world, going so far as to nick My Morning Jacket's vocal reverb to lend his words an ominous effect, but falls well short of its mark. Even the relatively enjoyable ""Numerology""-- the whimsical tale of a con man winnowing his way into the life of another mark-- beats itself into the ground to make sure there's no misunderstanding about the song's intentions. Would that some of this hyper-emphasis had found its way into ""Take Me"", a story about a young would-be runaway filled with evocative fragments (""fill my lungs fast and let them fly my kite"") in desperate need of a more substantial foundation. It's only with the title track, nestled deep in the album's second half, that the record finds its bearings. Barzelay pulls no punches in ""Lose Big"", sketching out the travails of a musician caught between his marriage and his love of music. At the song's start, he's all but ready to give up on the dream for the 9-to-5 lifestyle. By the song's end, he's hobnobbing with drunk girls and traveling to Europe. When Barzelay returns to the song's beginning-- ""If you're gonna lose then/ Might as well lose big then""-- it becomes clear what the narrator was truly risking. It's a powerful and beautiful song, and it's followed by two equally effective tracks-- ""True Freedom"", concerning a bittersweet modern-day Romeo and Juliet, and ""Song For Batya"", a gorgeous and fragile elegy-- both notable for their lyrical acuity and musical restraint (two hallmarks of Barzelay's superior solo debut, Bitter Honey). The album ends with two previously released songs-- ""No Me"", from Barzelay's soundtrack for the 2007 indie film Rocket Science, and a faithful rerecording of Clem Snide's ""I Love the Unknown"" from the group's only major-label album, Your Favorite Music-- but ""Batya"", with its wistful refrain of ""death is just the moment/ When the dying ends,"" is the record's true finale, and it's a fine note to finish on. It's just a shame that much of the rest of Lose Big rings off-key.","After six albums, a couple of EPs, a major-label misadventure, a fleeting moment in the primetime spotlight, and a fresh start with a new indie imprint, the Clem Snide singer returns with a new solo record.

Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill,Grouper,by: Mike McGonigal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8bea9e61561daa74d0/1:1/w_160/dc388a6f.jpg,2008-08-25 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12119-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/,Type,"Liz Harris, who does business as Grouper, strips away much of the effects-laden gauze of her earlier work on this, her third proper album. Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill is ethereal and hazy, but never overly so. Two songs reference sleep in their titles, three water. Some strong-ass melodies and actual songs always lurked deep inside-- or perhaps underneath-- Grouper's music, but you had to work to hear them underneath layers of sonic muck. Here, those elements are more prominent, and there's something simple and beautiful but also a little bit obscure going on. Laconically strummed acoustic guitars and gently plunked pianos serve as the primary instruments, abetted by ambient washes and echo boxes (which this time are not all set to 11). Released earlier this year, the record has already been compared to classic releases from the British label 4AD, especially their flagship act the Cocteau Twins. This makes sense in that both have subdued, minor-key melodies. And both feature whispery-voiced female singers whose words are tough to pick out. Beyond that, though, it's about as exact as comparing KISS to the Ramones-- both those bands were loud and made records in the mid-1970s and had lead singers who were dudes, but that's about it. This remarkable album is actually what I personally always wanted 4AD records to sound like, only they never quite delivered the hazy pleasures their beautiful sleeve art promised (with the exception of Kurt Ralske's rock band Ultra Vivid Scene). Dead Deer is druggy and sexy and arty and pretty, but never pretentious. Others have made similarly reverb-drenched, pastoral psychedelic pop before. In terms of contemporary musicians, the work of the Portland, Ore.-based compatriots Eva Saelens (aka Inca Ore), Charalambides co-founder Christina Carter, and Honey Owens (aka Valet) might spring to mind. Inca Ore's music is far heavier and murkier, however. And Christina Carter is more firmly working within a psych-folk idiom, while Valet is much more on a bluesy, guitar-based trip. Let someone else criticize me for making my own inexact comparisons to sounds of yore: A handful of these songs bring to mind the criminally forgotten records that Lida Husik recorded for Shimmy Disc in the early 90s. On ""When We Fall"" and ""Invisible"", Harris sounds like Vashti Bunyan singing in an echoey hallway. Others bear some resemblance to the band Clay Allison (who later became Opal and, in a different configuration, Mazzy Star) ca. their 1984 Fell From the Sun EP. And ""Traveling Through a Sea"" recalls the work of the always echo-friendly New York-based singer-songwriter Azalia Snail. I had the best experience playing this album on a long drive the other week. It's easy to apply whatever music you're listening at any given moment to your surroundings; when the music plays and you're by yourself, you can imagine it as the soundtrack to the imaginary movie you star in. Anyway, here I was driving in the morning past farmland north of Eugene, Ore. This would not be the most fascinating movie, OK. But I kept seeing these small dirt storms form out in the unplowed fields to the left while the lovely ""Fishing Bird (Empty Gutted In The Evening Breeze)"" played on repeat. I'm not sure this album is the perfect road trip music for everyone-- I'd certainly caution against playing it late at night when you're already sleepy, or operating other heavy machinery as it plays-- but since these songs seem to appear and then vanish into the air, the mini-tornadoes gathering themselves together lazily out of the wind and the dirt seemed the ideal, hypnotizing accompaniment.","Strong melodies and actual songs always lurked deep inside-- or perhaps underneath-- the music of Liz Harris' Grouper, but you had to work to hear them underneath layers of sonic muck; here, she strips away much of the effects-laden gauze and the result is an arresting album of pastoral psychedelic pop.

Pro Tools,GZA,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc92eb335119a49eccc6/1:1/w_160/44464d27.jpg,2008-08-25 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12126-pro-tools/,Babygrande,"In a crew filled with acrobatic swordsmen, drunken boxers, and masters of the flying guillotine, GZA always struck me as the type of dude who kills opponents with carefully placed acupuncture needles: not quite as flashy, but just as impressive considering the pinpoint precision it requires. GZA possesses a well-worn, refined delivery that packs a lot of calculating wordplay behind a relaxed, almost deadpan façade. It's a smooth presence that makes workmanlike beats sound like taut head-nodders and meticulously crafted production like pure cinema. His new album, Pro Tools, is another in a line of notoriously delayed Wu-Tang-affiliated records; as a result, instead of being greeted with excitement it's being considered the work of a guy with something to prove. What Pro Tools does prove is that the Genius is still lyrically sharp. The conceptual rhymes he's known for work well without getting too overbearing, and GZA still has a knack for building metaphors without stretching them thin. Sometimes it's simple, like the chorus to ""Alphabets"", which fuses Five Percenter linguistic mysticism and show-off vocab in a divine trip through the ABCs (""Universe, Victory, Wisdom, unknown/(why/Y), zig zag zig, and now back home""). Other times he runs through every possible twist of phraseology, as in ""0% Finance"", which runs with the girl-as-car metaphor and throws in enough make and model name references to fill an issue of Road & Track. And the title of ""Columbian Ties"" looks like a typo until it becomes clear that he's switched the rise-and-fall-of-a-hustler references from victims of Bogota cartels to people killed from D.C.'s foreign policy, and it's a cutting joke that he didn't have to change the scenario too much (""A place where the majority is goin' for self/ With the agenda not far beyond personal wealth""). Like most upper-tier MCs, GZA can still sound compelling big-upping his own skills (""Pencil"") or taunting his foes, as he does in G-Unit dis track ""Paper Plates""-- which is actually pretty damn funny. But aside from his lyrics, his biggest asset is the pull of his voice and how it bolsters even the most perfunctory, cheap-ass-sounding production-- which is fortunate, because there's not much here that you'll remember for the beats. Most of them are passable enough, even if they consist largely of textbook digital-era RZA mannerisms and the occasional derivative knockoff (particularly Jose ""Choco"" Reynoso's beat for ""0% Financing"", which sounds like a Xerox of Arabian Knight's beat for Legend of the Liquid Sword cut ""Stay in Line""). And they compare semi-favorably to the two tracks that the RZA himself contributes-- the tinny but sinister ""Paper Plate"" and ""Life Is a Movie"", which liberally incorporates Gary Numan's ""Films"" to compellingly weird effect. But it's hard to overlook how ordinary they sound when the voice connected to them is the same one that spit over some of the most immaculate beats ever put together by the RZA (Liquid Swords) or DJ Muggs (Grandmasters), and even production-by-committee records like Beneath the Surface and Legend of the Liquid Sword had more stylistic cohesion to them. As a pure lyrical record goes, Pro Tools doesn't disappoint, but fans who want everything to be a banger will be let down to find that there's not a lot of headknock here. The buzz around Pro Tools is that GZA just sounds too tired to get people amped, and while that's a more negative assessment than he deserves, this still doesn't really sound like the kind of album you'd call on to fill anyone's late-summer barbeque party soundtracking duties. But high-energy anthems aren't what made GZA great in the first place, and if you're into his most characteristic attributes-- high-concept extended-metaphor lyrics, hard-boiled storytelling, that calmly authoritative voice-- Pro Tools is still sharp enough to draw blood.","On the heels of a disappointing Bobby Digital record, another longtime Wu-Tang member proves he still has a deft command of language, metaphor, and narrative.

Where You Go I Go Too,Lindstrøm,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc91ea9e61561daa74dc/1:1/w_160/4300ebee.jpeg,2008-08-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12125-where-you-go-i-go-too/,Smalltown Supersound,"My favorite trick on the opening title track to Lindstrøm's Where You Go I Go Too was first revealed on his 2005 album with Prins Thomas: During long stretches of its near half-hour length, the arrangement does this wonderful and unsettling thing where the music simultaneously seems to expand outwards, curl in on itself, and then unexpectedly swerve off to the side. With its shimmering, strobing synthesizer melodies, dizzy layering, and measured rhythmic pulse, ""Where You Go I Go Too"" superficially resembles the depth of Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians and the cheesy grandeur of Tangerine Dream. But, as with his recent covers of Can (""Mighty Girl"") and Jon & Vangelis (last year's ""Let It Happen""), its logic is all Lindstrøm: The more he embraces the work of others, the more he ends up sounding like himself. The rest of Where You Go I Go Too transposes the ambitions of the title track into shorter settings: With its floating chords and bubbly enthusiasm, ""Grand Ideas"" is close to Lindstrøm's more classicist disco work and given a heightened intensity by its placement in the middle of the album, like a moment of clarity amidst the disorienting swirl. Closer ""The Long Way Home"" apes the title track's splendor but with a twist: The synth work of its first half is complemented by hyper-manicured guitar breaks. In its second half, the track capitulates entirely to its cornier impulses, shifting into plush and suffocatingly slow electronic disco-funk. Stretching three tracks over 55 minutes and occasionally wandering far away from the dancefloor, Where You Go I Go Too has all the hallmarks of a masterpiece from a reclusive auteur. And while it shares its bloat, excess, and splendor with any number of cosmic disco or Balearic producers at the more decadent end of disco revivalism, it begs for a context more weighty than ""disco revivalism."" Paradoxically, Lindstrøm knows all the right moves to give his own brand of spacey disco an air of transcendence, but the result feels so effortless that his facsimile and the ""real thing"" become indistinguishable-- a fake so real it's beyond fake.","The latest from Norwegian electronic producer Hans-Peter Lindstrøm finds the missing link between the modern classical works of Steve Reich and Tangerine Dream's cheesy grandeur, resulting in a fist-pumping, hyper-cosmic space-disco epic that conjures both the retro-futurism of Logan's Run and Manuel Göttsching's influential 1981 electro-prog mammoth  E2-E4.

Waiting for the Sunrise,David Vandervelde,by: Stephen M.

Since releasing his mini-album debut in January 2007, the Michigan native and then Chicago resident moved to Brooklyn, then quickly relocated to Nashville, although he mostly stayed roadbound behind The Moonstation House Band. Musically, he's equally nomadic: That album stomped like T. Rex and glammed out like Bowie, but his new follow-up, while staying more or less contemporary with its inspirations, mellows out considerably to Fleetwood Mac or to Gerry Rafferty, England Dan & John Ford Coley, and other K-Tel fodder bands. Listening to Waiting for the Sunrise, it's difficult to determine whether those acts have consciously influenced him or have indirectly filtered into Vandervelde's brain like fluoride in the water (he was born at least 10 years after most of his heroes' heydays). Mostly that's besides the point. What matters more is how well Vandervelde fares in a genre that-- tongue-in-cheek yacht rock revival notwithstanding-- is not especially defensible at the moment. Or really at any moment, for that matter. For Vandervelde, this type of soft rock plays as a style that allows and perhaps encourages experimentation, which is not necessarily unheard of (see: 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love"") but which allows him and his band to tinker in the studio. Opener ""I Will Be Fine"" floats by on a summer breeze that might seem a little too harvest gold/avocado green, but as it progresses, the songs seems to grow weirder: The echo on Vandervelde's vocal track becomes more pronounced (essentially reducing his words to syllables and his syllables to sounds), the reverb on the piano makes it emanate from the apartment upstairs, and Emmett Kelly's guitar dodges in and out of the song. As the song gently dissipates on the wind and fades away, it becomes something more than mere genre exercise. Of course Vandervelde has rock-star dreams, so not everything is quite so stoner-mellow and summery. The band's marching pace and cascading guitars make ""Hit the Road"" sound nearly psychedelic, and the not-quite-reggae rhythm that propels stand-out ""Someone Like You"" is created by an acoustic guitar strumming on the and beat, which has been annexed by the rhythm section to create a loose groove. At times the big rock sound is so black-hole dense that melody cannot escape it, which robs ""Knowledge of Evil"" of its hook and makes those four minutes a drag. On the other hand, ""Lyin' in Bed"", which could have been a Moonstation outtake, begins with an unusually heavy riff before building into a fiery show-closing guitar meltdown that plays to the double meaning of the song title. It seems wholly predictable that these songs would run too long. Most could be cut by a minute, some by two. ""Need for Now"", the rare exception, starts its long fade-out on the very first notes, but that only reinforces its setting-sun mood. ""Someone Like You"" really does overshoot. The triumphant ooh-wooh-woohs at the four-minute mark initially sound like a solid outro and a natural conclusion for the chorus melody. But that's just the bridge. The song has two more minutes, during which Vandervelde and the band can only repeat themselves to diminishing returns. Extravagant song lengths, like big-ass cars and expensive gas (hey, wait a sec), are touchstones of the 1970s rock that obsesses Vandervelde, but he shouldn't be quite so slavish in his recreations and reinterpretations. ""Someone Like You"" is the stand-out track on a fairly solid album, but how much better would they have sounded with a little judicious editing and a sharper focus","After an album that hewed closely to the glammier sounds of Bolan and Bowie, this former Chicago-based musician has now moved to Brooklyn and mellowed his sound, creating a soft-rock record that recalls Fleetwood Mac or Gerry Rafferty.

Eccentric Soul: The Tragar & Note Labels,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3dea9e61561daa7426/1:1/w_160/1347bf22.jpg,2008-08-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12051-eccentric-soul-the-tragar-note-labels/,Numero Group,"By 1968, Jesse J. Jones, Jr. was a seasoned veteran of the music business. He started out at 17, touring with Jimmy Witherspoon in 1948, formed his own band in 1949, and ruled the Atlanta club scene until he broke for L.A. in 1956. He also gave a young saxophonist named Ornette Coleman one of his earliest gigs. In L.A., Jones worked for Specialty Records, cut a few sides for Ebb and launched his first two labels, Lita and Four-J. It was the failure of the second imprint that cost him his home and sent him back to Atlanta. Despite being at the very heart of the chitlin' circuit, Atlanta had a relatively small independent soul scene. One of the biggest obstacles to establishing a productive black record industry in the city was a the lack of a studio that catered to it. There was no Motown, no Vee-Jay, no Chess, no Stax, no Revilot-- no one had established a bedrock label to fuel a scene that had ample live venues at its disposable. And so Jones set up shop, pulling together the best band he could, securing financial backing, and booking time at the National Recording Company studio, which until then had specialized in country music. The first few Tragar singles were good examples of music succeeding (artistically, not commercially) on the strength of passion and songwriting rather than studio expertise. Barbara ""Tokay"" Lewis penned and sang the A- and B-sides of Tragar's inaugural single; the B-side, ""What Can the Matter Be"", is where her magic can be heard-- it's a waltz-time deep soul burner stuffed with blistering blues guitar and topped with a righteously dejected vocal. Even as the label grew from the ground up, its first two years produced an amazing clutch of great music that neatly straddles the line between smoky Southern soul and the sophisticated arrangements that adorned the crossover sound of the North. Numero Group's enormous 2xCD, 50-track retrospective of Tragar and its successor, Note, focuses mainly on 1968 and 1969, devoting all of Disc One and two-fifths of Disc Two to those years. Good thing, too, because the labels' diverse cuts rivaled the best contemporary soul of the time. Franciene Thomas' ""Too Beautiful to Be Good"" is a stunning ballad with a billowing, sorrowful melody; L. Daniels' ""Nitecap"" is a fantastic, funky instrumental led by a big, Broadway sax; Sandy Gaye wails like a woman possessed on the burbling workout ""Watch the Dog That Bring the Bone""; and Chuck Wilder does justice to the time-worn sad clown theme on ""The Clown"", a dejected, dramatic, and even somewhat psychedelic slow-burner with a string part descended from ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"". A couple of male vocal duos turn in exemplary cuts as well: Frankie & Robert channel Sam & Dave on ""Sweet Thing"", backed by a horn part to match, while Langston & French's ""Tumbling Down"" is its morose but sweetly soulful antithesis. The greatest discovery of Tragar's early phase, though, was Eula Cooper, who was only 14 when she had her first impromptu audition for Jones, walking into his office at 799 ½ Hunter St. and singing her own ""Shake Daddy Shake"" for him. Cooper has 11 songs on this compilation, and she's the epitome of the talented should-have-been. ""Shake Daddy Shake"" was certainly good for a 14-year-old, and it charted locally, but it was a warm-up. Her adept and sensitive reading of the Holland/Dozier/Holland chestnut ""Love (Makes Me Do Foolish Things)"", recorded one year later, is a stunner, but it pales next to her original ""Try"", a sweeping, uptown soul number with a great vibraphone melody and mature vocal. Cooper continued to record for Jones throughout the early 70s, but she never achieved more than a local hit. ""Beggars Can't Be Choosey"", from 1973, is a fine pop-soul tune, and ""Let Our Love Grow Higher"", recorded at Muscle Shoals, has a brilliant rhythm track and sharp bounce that was diverted from the charts by lack of promotion. As Jones soldiered on until financial ruin in the 70s, the sounds he was making echoed larger national trends, smoothing out and flirting with the rise of disco. A few of these are outstanding-- especially the Young Divines' ""Ain't That Sharp"", a swinging slice of well-honed harmony soul that could've stood with the Stylistics if it had received the proper backing. The greatest find of Jones' later years was Alice Harper, who chose the stage name Alice Swoboda, taking the surname from a New York Yankees outfielder. Her two tracks on this compilation, both from 1972, are sophisticated soul numbers that dip into funk, psychedelia, and folk. Her self-harmonizing over the relentless clavinet groove of ""I Think It's Time (You Were Mine)"" is jaw-dropping, as is the shuddering orchestral arrangement that backs it, while her strange mid-point between Joni Mitchell and Nina Simone on ""Potter's Field"" is weirdly arresting. She was a singular talent who probably should have been releasing albums on Elektra or Harvest, and these sides are truly great finds. Jones persevered for as long as he could, sporadically churning out singles until the end of the decade, but all dreams have to end, and Jones' concluded without ever managing the true breakout that could have come if luck had merely sided with him once. This sweeping collection reveals his many highs and a few of his lows with great affection, finally shedding some light on the greatest player in Atlanta's strangely undersized independent soul scene.","Numero Group's latest release focuses on Jesse J. Jones, Jr.'s Atlanta labels, which produced an amazing clutch of great music between the late 60s and early 70s that neatly straddles the line between smoky Southern soul and the sophisticated arrangements that adorned the crossover sound of the North.

Why Are We Not Perfect? EP,Jesu,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8cabf31b7dc7155d45/1:1/w_160/6c24f329.jpg,2008-08-22 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12120-why-are-we-not-perfect-ep/,Hydra Head,"It was bound to happen. With the release of 2007's Lifeline, and the full-length Conqueror it supplemented, Justin Broadrick inched even further away from the monolithic dirge-metal and slow-slung elegies he created on the first handful of Jesu releases. Instead what he mined was something more polished, much more melodic, almost soft. On Why Are We Not Perfect?, the third of many Jesu releases this year, and an alt-take aided CD version of the songs he contributed to last year's Eluvium split, the former Napalm Death and Godflesh flagshipper seems to be tiring even further of girth and his guitar-- or at the very least, of the way he's been using it for the past 20-odd years. Why Are We Not Perfect?, like the introductory Heart Ache EP, features Broadrick on all instruments. In at least one way then, this EP is a fitting bookend for another transformative stretch of his ever-transforming career. Only where Ache's directness came in its smoke-breathing detuned dirginess, Perfect is an exploration of the un-metal sonics of shoegaze and general pleasantness that Broadrick has been gravitating towards since adopting the Jesu banner in 2003. Here, for better or worse, those smeared, treated tones that underpinned the crushing guitars of past records are the guiding force, leaving behind a distillate that couldn't conceivably be called heavy, and that rarely achieves the trancy throb that has become Jesu's hallmark. Basically, if the earlier stuff was a crushing metal wall of My Bloody Valentine, this EP resembles something like a wobbly, drum-machine Slowdive, drenched in syrup and slowed to a crawl, stretching and contorting fewer, less dense elements over Jesu's characteristic plod. Of course, the pare-it-down and turn-it-down schematic serves Broadrick's evolving, increasingly refined palette well in spots. Here, he's forced to make each element as rich as possible, creating a kind of texture that still suggests Jesu's characteristic layering, despite the general sparseness of the record. It makes for a surprisingly compact and strong three minutes on the instrumental ""Blind and Faithless"", which is built from a muddy, slow-phaser Ride guitar strum and codeine-supping trip-hop drum programming. Extra accoutrements? An accumulating wind like a Gregorian chant, a two-note synth string tone that squeals like a firework, and little else. For a dude specializing in suffocating meganess, the track's simplicity is almost refreshing. And it doesn't hurt that ""Faithless"" is the only instrumental song here, forgoing Jesu's weakest asset: Broadrick's increasingly dewy vocals. But where Perfect truly fails is in its decision to pit four-fifths of the album against itself. Not only does his two-songs-done-twice thing draw attention to the ineffectiveness of the increasingly prominent drum programming on many tracks (or the general sameness of Broadrick's compositions), but adding the second takes of the album-opening ""Farewell"" and the title-track undercuts what came before and forces the listener to pick between strikingly different versions of the same songs. Still, in a lot of ways that's apropos. If anything, Broadrick is a non-committal songwriter, never settling in any set of footprints too long. And he likely won't pitch a tent here. Which is reassuring to know when listening to Perfect, a sleepy little record that loses the map just as Broadrick reaches his latest fork in the road.","Justin Broadrick's third release of the year, this is an exploration of the un-metal sonics of shoegaze and general pleasantness that the former Napalm Death leader has been gravitating towards since adopting the Jesu banner in 2003.

L.A.X.,The Game,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8fabf31b7dc7155d50/1:1/w_160/39310c44.jpg,2008-08-22 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12123-lax/,Geffen,"Reality used to be a friend of Game; these days, he's better off with its close cousin, perception. Statistically, his short but eventful career is in a freefall-- his sophomore album, Doctor's Advocate, sold several million fewer copies than its predecessor, The Document**ary, his first feature film (Waist Deep) couldn't even be enjoyed ironically, and I've never seen his Converse Hurricane shoe in stores, let alone in public. And I live in L.A. Yet, the perception is that he's riding a head of artistic steam into L.A.X. due to, as Pitchfork contributor Jayson Greene put it, shedding the impression that he's one of the least interesting rappers to ever go platinum. Where he was once reverent of anyone in hip-hop that had been in the same room as a record deal, the Game soon alienated nearly everyone responsible for The Document's success-- as far as role-playing goes, unstable psycho was infinitely more entertaining than name-dropping money pit. The problem is, self-immolation is an artistic ideal that doesn't leave much of an exit strategy, and once the dud singles and release dates started piling up for L.A.X., Game was left to do his A.J. Soprano routine in magazines, unable to handle his daddy issues and at times threatening to kill other people or himself. The perception of Doctor's Advocate as career suicide made it a voyeuristic pleasure for the message-board rubberneckers Game actively courts. That inferiority complex and desperate need for approval keeps L.A.X. surprisingly entertaining even though there are far more weak tracks on it than good ones. Still, it's difficult to keep seeing him as a loose cannon (""Hated on so much/ Passion of Christ need a sequel,"" he raps) when most of his adversaries respond to his beefs by completely ignoring him, and when nearly every viable hip-hop artist (plus Travis Barker) makes a guest spot here. Obviously, a lot of those spots are late-90s-style padding: If DMX's performance on the intro and outro are any indication, his gospel-rap ambitions should result in the comedy record of the year, and while Tha Carter III has sold 25,000 copies in the time it takes to read this paragraph, the beyond-hideous hook of ""woe is Game"" weepie ""My Life"" suggests Lil Wayne's too in hock to buy an autotuner that can work at full capacity. Befitting someone who, to be honest, is still learning on the job, Game continues to improve although there are certain handicaps that he'll never overcome-- he compares himself to Chris Paul (""I never dribble out of bounds""), but he's more like Shaq trying to run a fastbreak. There's something almost endearing about the confidence he has in his lumbering flow (watch him try a double-time spit on ""L.A.X. Files"" or lope triplets on ""Cali Sunshine"") and limited ability to create on the fly, but really, you just brace yourself and hope no one gets seriously injured. His similes can still be painfully awkward (""flow like oregano""?), his boasts more idiot than savant (""Word to Martha Stewart/ If I can park a Buick/ I can flip a Brinks truck/ I've got the heart to do it""), and he relies on variants of ""fuck"" to fill up syllables to the point where charging money for a clean version is a ""fuck you"" in itself. At least he only threatens to break into Dr. Dre's house once. For better or worse, his increasing confidence has allowed him to aim for concepts beyond the usual talk of how dangerous California is, trading darts with Raekwon and making a bilious rainmaker with Cool & Dre that rejiggers ""She Works Hard for the Money"" into Game's very own ""Push It to the Limit"". But then you get idea tracks like ""Never Say Goodbye"", which is rapped from the perspective of 2Pac, Biggie and Eazy-E right before their deaths; the ""One More Chance"" karaoke in the middle portion is probably the most embarrassing thing Game will ever do in his career, which is saying something. But at least that seems like a noble failure-- no matter how much better Game gets on the mic, he'll never record a decent love song or stop trying. His bullish voice, however, sounds more convincing talking about Ice Cube's Lethal Injection than anything with the faintest hint of eroticism-- not even David Tyree would vouch for ""beautiful as an Eli Manning pass"" as a viable pickup line. After Ludacris effortlessly sasses up ""Ya Heard"" like Game never could, he laments the attention given to Kanye and Weezy before asking, ""Y'all act like y'all don't hear me spit/ Like selling 7 million records ain't shit"". It's an absurd boast but it's a canny move to align himself as a peer of those two as opposed to an adversary-- the hundreds of barbs Game threw at 50 Cent had a fraction of the impact Wayne and Kanye exerted by speaking the only language Curtis understands: record sales. But the Game may have at least unloosened the screws for G-Unit's epic collapse. Relatively, he's won Round 3 by making his third straight album that's better than it has any right to be-- but the fact that the Game can make perfectly uncompelling competence sound like victory is proof that he's a master thespian of hip-hop theater. Waist Deep notwithstanding.","With his career in a statistical downfall, the L.A. rapper and his inferiority complex return for another round.

Life Is Sweet,The Lodger,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc85abf31b7dc7155d38/1:1/w_160/9ac61fae.jpg,2008-08-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12114-life-is-sweet/,Virgin,"Music affects memory, research has shown again and again, though exactly how depends on whose studies you read. I've been going through a period of long-dreaded nostalgia lately, listening to cassettes I made as far back as before I was teenager, and it's amazing to realize that I still know every word to pop songs I'd forgotten about for more than a decade-- and how their very familiarity can make them sound more inviting. No, I don't remember when rock was young, but I can see how Elton John's ""Crocodile Rock"" would've charmed 1970s listeners not only for its own sake, but also for the reminiscences its 50s-style piano pop sound and references would've evoked. On the sophomore album by Leeds, UK, indie-poppers the Lodger, life is often sweet, but the memories are usually sweeter. Life Is Sweet reveals a wistful, bouncy three-piece not just aware of their pop lineage, but also appropriately hopeful about their place in the current pecking order. The album's best song (by far) wonders whether the present moment will be tomorrow's ""The Good Old Days"", and earns itself a spot in the ol' brain tissue by bringing refreshing, hook-filled simplicity to the Orange Juice blend of disco and sensitive jangle-pop. Much as Okkervil River sing of the travails of ""a mid-level band,"" the Lucksmiths-like ""A Hero's Welcome"" undercuts ""The Good Old Days"" with a self-deprecating recognition that hoping your genius will be recognized ""is a hopeless and pointless charade."" Opener ""My Finest Hour"" is lightweight by comparison, but it's easy to imagine the charms it might have onstage one fine hour in a roomful of like-minded twee-pop fans. The good old days were never as good as we remember them, though. Recalling teenage thrills on the slower ""Falling Down"", singer/guitarist Ben Siddall chides, ""You're a cruel, cruel girl,"" only at the end adding, ""But you're mine."" On the flute- and string-laden ""Honey"", he compares this anguish to music: ""Singing another kind of song/ Finding new hooks to hang upon/ Why are you always hurting me, honey?"" One track after bemoaning having ""Nothing Left (to Say)"" on the most Sound of Young Scotland-like song on the album, Siddall turns around and asks, ""Is there something new that I could bring to the conversation?"" That one doesn't have much to add, no, what with its painfully forgettable chorus of ""I don't want to fall in love/ I just want to rise above,"" but the sprightly ""A Year Since That Summer"" (""I was your other,"" Siddall recalls) or the weather-obsessed melancholy of ""Running Low"" could someday fill today's Voxtrot or Vampire Weekend fans with bittersweet nostalgia. ""So it goes/ You have one last throw of the dice,"" goes the maudlin, waltzing finale, ""Famous Last Words"". At least ""The Good Old Days"" will always be there, in 1's and 0's or analog grooves-- pleasantly imperfect sound forever for our imperfect memories.","On the sophomore album by Leeds, UK, indie-poppers the Lodger, life is often sweet, but the memories are usually sweeter.

This Is Alphabeat,Alphabeat,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc79c0084474cd0c2acf/1:1/w_160/8a1a919b.jpg,2008-08-21 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12103-this-is-alphabeat/,Charisma,"In my day job, I once got into a discussion with a major company about their brand image. ""We want,"" said their representative, ""to own happiness."" He was so affable that I didn't realize right away how sinister it sounded. Watch the video for ""Fascination"", Alphabeat's breakout European hit, and you might think they're playing the same game. It's a dayglo grin-a-thon so unreservedly perky that you scrabble desperately for some kind of side to it, some hidden agenda. Nobody, surely, can have this much pep? The Danish pop outfit have recently relocated to London, a wildly successful move. With bands like Scouting for Girls and the Hoosiers, Britain has rediscovered a taste for naggingly upbeat pop. Those bands tend to find a barely adequate hook and whip it till it coughs blood: Alphabeat in comparison are masters of sophistication and craft. ""Fascination""'s pre-chorus would be the centrepiece of most songs; its real chorus is a juggernaut; and the song hits a supremely giddy peak with its back-and-forth middle eight. ""The word is on your lips-- say the word!"" Everybody does. There's something a little rote about its celebratory woah-ho-hos, but ""Fascination"" is still one hell of a calling card. It's also the only track to survive unaltered from Alphabeat's first draft of this debut, a self-titled album that came out in Denmark a year and a half ago. Three of its songs have vanished entirely from This Is Alphabeat, and the band have re-recorded and re-arranged others. The effect has been to transform a well-turned power-pop record-- which attracted approving blogosphere comparisons to the New Pornographers-- into a strange kind of mid-80s wax museum. ""Boyfriend"" offers the clearest example. On the Danish album, it's keyboard-driven new wave pop-- the lead vocal has some of Cyndi Lauper's spiky relish, the backing chants nod to Big Country. On This Is Alphabeat, it's mid-80s eurodance, canned bell and brass presets bubbling in the background and Stine Bramsen is doing a Sam Fox impression, softer and more come-hither. Finally, the new single remix is late-80s hi-NRG, like a lost collaboration between Kylie Minogue and the Pet Shop Boys. This perfectly observed mix happens to be my favorite Alphabeat thing by miles, but it can't quite dispel the impression that there's something a little hollow about a song which changes its period costume so quickly and liberally. Other refixes are less successful. ""Rubber Boots"", brooding and endearingly odd on the original, is shinier but draggier here. ""What Is Happening?"" ruins its desperate break-up bounce with a pancake of unnecessary strings-- but by now I'm so wary of Alphabeat's retro expertise that I wonder if this sabotage isn't somehow deliberate, a pastiche of New Pop's meltdown into overproduction. It's not all bad news: Throwing dance-pop into the mix may have diffused Alphabeat's focus, but they do it very well-- new tracks ""Go Go"" and ""Touch Me Touching You"" are highlights, the latter's sequencer overdrive and falsetto a delightfully demented moment on a rather well-choreographed record. Their fine work is slightly wasted by a bubblegum take on PIL's ""Public Image""-- a jolly wheeze in principle, let down by John Lydon's baffling decision not to give his venomous comeback blast a jaunty melody. So why did Alphabeat tinker with a solid record to make this curate's egg? The last Danish group to make it big worldwide were Aqua, and certainly the Alphabeat video experience can feel like a vanilla version of ""Barbie Girl""'s kindergarten craziness. They would have been tagged as retro anyhow, and this version of their debut presses more nostalgic buttons than its tighter Danish sibling did. On the evidence of the ""Boyfriend"" remix and the new tracks, if their time machine got stuck in 1987 they could make a more diverting album. But This Is Alphabeat feels labored, sacrificing identity in its endless eagerness to please.","With a deserved European smash single, ""Fascination"", Denmark's wonky pop band aims for the same sort of crossover appeal enjoyed by Girls Aloud, Sugababes, and (finally) Robyn.

As High as the Sky,The Mole,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc76abf31b7dc7155d17/1:1/w_160/9424a15d.jpg,2008-08-21 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12101-as-high-as-the-sky/,Wagon Repair,"It's simple, even for a casual fan, to separate the disco world into hemispheres: those acts who relied on synthesizers and sequencers-- e.g. the pioneering work of Patrick Cowley or Giorgio Moroder-- and those acts whose disco was funk-based-- e.g. Chic or Bohannon. Subsequent iterations have naturally blurred the lines, be they the semi-legible musings of punk rockers like Liquid Liquid, the deck work of Carl Craig, or the machines-aping-instruments whir of Hercules and Love Affair. On his debut album As High as the Sky, the Mole submits his own inversion, pairing recognizable, sampled signifiers-- galloping basslines, cooed refrains, riddling breakbeats-- with uptempo electronic machinations. The result falls somewhere between the minimal, splotchy watercolor of the Field and Luomo's version of house, robbing the source material of some of its effusiveness by applying it to Serious Dance Music but also offering pleasantly familiar floor-filler. The Mole is Colin de la Plante, a Montreal resident whose singles and remixes have been popping up on a variety of labels, including Spectral Sound and Philpot, but mostly on Wagon Repair, this record's home. De la Plante has moved away somewhat from the heavy techno sounds of his early singles, now favoring an inviting, cut-up whir, though you wouldn't know it from the stoic electronic cawing of ""Still in My Corner"", the album's first track. That atmosphere doesn't last long: the opening moments of ""Ain't the Way It's Supposed to Be"" features a glossy gospel cry-- ""Lord take away the pain""-- as plenty of familiar accoutrements sashay into the mix: handclaps, orbital strings, and, two-and-a-half minutes later, a humming bassline. Throughout As High as the Sky, de la Plante seeks the line that falls between recognizable and the composed; he's a tease. During the seven-plus minutes of ""Baby, You're the One (Edit)"" the title phrase is diced and sprinkled throughout, constantly present but ungraspable. That's the point: de la Plante's idea of ""recognizable"" seems to have a lot more to do with looking across the floor at your friend and going ""awwwww yeeeaaah"" ecstatically than exhibiting his crate-digging skills. As High as the Sky features no sample credits, and the repeated phrases-- ""Baby you're the one,"" ""Like the way you move""-- are so familiar they're nearly untraceable (though some clever Googling can get you halfway there). So anyone without an encyclopedic knowledge of his potential sources might have trouble discerning between where de la Plante's samples end and his own compositions begin, but count that as a credit toward the fluidity and hearth of As High as the Sky. He erects smoky, sturdy homes for his loves: ""Like the Way"" is mousy and elusive, even during its near-ambient coda. ""Knock Twice"" is comparatively restrained, offering its vocals and snapping guitars only a burly bass thump and handclaps. As High as the Sky rarely falters or stalls, moving seamlessly from awfully danceable to quite danceable and back again. This structure, though, does seem to stunt some inter-track growth: songs, while not formally mixed, often arrive fully formed and vary minimally throughout long runtimes. The clever emotional tricks-- ""hey wait...awww yeah""-- he pulls during ""Ain't the Way"" disappear somewhat as the album rounds into full swing. But As High as the Sky does find a sixth gear, peaking with its final four tracks, right down to the lock-the-doors-club's closed breakbeat-isms of ""When It Tastes So Good You Deserve It"", which sounds like Prefuse 73, exhausted and drooping. It is a conflagration of the vaguely familiar-- trite phrases, muscle-memory guitars, rumbling bass sequences-- that de la Plante guides to enviable heights.","After a number of singles, Montreal resident Colin de la Plante issues his first album as the Mole, on which he pairs recognizable, sampled signifiers-- galloping basslines, cooed refrains, riddling breakbeats-- with uptempo electronic machinations.

While you've probably become familiar with that collective's Sparks-fueled spazz-offs (see: Dan Deacon, Videohippos, Death Set, and Ponytail), Gonzalez is steeped in Anglophilic folkie steez, shaking hands with the likes of Donovan and Fairport Convention but keeping to a cartoonish, lyrical sensibility that owes as much to the songwriter's own visual art as it does from the poetry of Edward Lear, whose ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" is adapted here. It's a weird fit for his scene's humid, hypercolor warehouse freak-outs. Yet despite large helpings of whimsy, Gonzalez's wan-pleasant songs don't feel as vibrant as those of his peers. Opener ""A Magic"" is a buttered, breakfast commercial strummer that Gonzalez trots out of the driveway with ease. It's a strong statement with simple aims, but its lyrical repetition drains it of any romance. Its pacing remains steady throughout. ""Pinecone Eyes""-- dragged down by icy fingerpicking and magic realist lyrics-- is one of a few tracks that recalls the feathery vibrato of Devendra Banhart. Ditto that for closer ""Mostly a Friend"", a castanet-enhanced earworm with Latin juices. But for the most part, chord progressions are familiar and warm; the leapfrogging of ""Build a Tiny Hill"" has the fragile lilt of a new Death Vessel lullaby and ""Love for Longer"" features a stunning ascending melody. Gonzalez has a ragged way with his acoustic guitar that augments the record's matchlit feel; I just wish he'd let loose more often-- maybe even plug in.","Despite being a card-carrying member of Dan Deacon's Wham City, Cuban-born, Baltimore-based Lesser Gonzalez Alvarez is steeped in Anglophilic folkie steez, shaking hands with the likes of Donovan and Fairport Convention rather than the Death Set and Ponytail.

Music Tapes for Clouds and Tornadoes,The Music Tapes,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc86eb335119a49eccae/1:1/w_160/97ee8947.jpg,2008-08-21 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12115-music-tapes-for-clouds-and-tornadoes/,Merge,"The word ""timeless"" is bandied about carelessly in music writing, often incorrectly as an indication that something is more than a fad. But Music Tapes For Clouds and Tornadoes, the long-time-coming sophomore album by Julian Koster's Music Tapes project, is the rare case of a record that literally sounds timeless, or not of a specific era. With liberal use of banjo coupled with the tones of the singing saw and the intimacy of a lo-fi or field recording, Music Tapes comes across like a sweeping summation of the history of 20th century American white-boy music, from the sounds of Appalachia or the Grand Ole Opry to MGM movie musicals and K Records do-it-yourself twee. You'd be forgiven if the band name the Music Tapes doesn't ring a bell. They released their only other record, First Imaginary Symphony For Nomad, nine years ago-- ages ago in these accelerated culture days. The group revolves around Koster, one of Jeff Mangum's partners-in-crime from Neutral Milk Hotel, and a collective of Elephant 6-related musicians (Of Montreal's Kevin Barnes, A Hawk and a Hacksaw's Jeremy Barnes, Olivia Tremor Control's John Fernandes and Eric Harris, NMH's Scott Spillane, among others) who lend a hand fleshing out his psych-folk fantasias and laying them to tape. Few records encourage listeners to identify recording equipment-- who, save engineers and musicians, cares what kind of microphone was used?-- but the Music Tapes use the scratchy textures of vintage equipment as a key component of their sound. The fuzzy crackle of Koster's cadre of toys-- from the record lathe (think ProTools for the phonograph age) and Depression-era wire recorders to a handheld tape recorder-- is as much a part of creating Music Tapes' aural character as the instruments played. And the combination of such unusual equipment with such surprisingly accessible melodies creates a pleasingly disorienting sense of déjà vu. Album opener ""Saw Ping Pong and Orchestra"" starts with a rhythmic sputter and haunting singing saw that sounds like the soundtrack to a black-and-white B movie, but then, with the addition of weeping, waltzing strings, blossoms into a score for a 1940s melodrama. Willfully and wistfully cinematic, ""Freeing Song By Reindeer"" sets Koster's plaintive, reedy voice against cabaret accordions, like he's an E6 Edith Piaf, for a psychedelic take on a Parisian-café sequence. ""Tornado Longing for Freedom"" builds an off-kilter campfire song on a stop-start banjo line and ghostly background drone, like an acid-fried ""Rainbow Connection"". And closing track ""In an Ice Palace"" features the jingle-bell percussion, groovy Magnus organ, and jazzy rhythms of the mod 60s. Listeners will also be reminded of Koster's tenure in Neutral Milk Hotel. ""The Minister of Longitude"", the album's most anthemic track, bursts with the kind of tinny-yet-rousing folk and ramshackle horn orchestrations of ""Holland, 1945"", and ""Song for Oceans Falling"" is the sort of crackling, aching ballad that would have been both shambolic and heartfelt enough for In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Don't get hung up on such weirdness, though. Sure, Koster and his cast of collaborators use lyrical abstraction and experimental recording techniques, but the melodies at the heart of each song are welcoming and familiar. And even the unusual way they've been gussied up only adds to their poignancy. These 15 tracks were certainly worth the almost-decade-long wait.","The long-time-coming sophomore album by former Neutral Milk Hotel member Julian Koster's Music Tapes project comes across like a sweeping summation of the history of 20th century American white-boy music, from the sounds of Appalachia or the Grand Ole Opry to MGM movie musicals and K Records do-it-yourself twee.

Remember,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8eea9e61561daa74d5/1:1/w_160/f0689591.jpg,2008-08-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12122-remember/,Thrill Jockey,"There's nothing wrong with manipulating a live performance before you cut it to record-- it all depends on what you do with it. The Fiery Furnaces have waited this long to release an official live album, and it's no surprise that they would try to surprise us. The Furnaces' live show is infamous: Instead of just staging the songs, the band rearranges them, reshuffles the parts, and strings them together into lengthy medleys that can run the length of a whole set. And the next time they hit town, they've usually shuffled the deck again, with a new setlist and sometimes even a new band behind the Friedberger siblings, who are the only constant. On top of all that, the ever-wacky Matt Friedberger and bassist and mixer Jason Loewenstein have added another layer of reinvention: They've taken several gigs and spliced those together into seamless medleys, one per CD, that span all the band's studio albums in two hour-plus marathons. For an added gag, the longer tracks splice tapes of completely different shows into a single performance, so the line-up keeps changing and the sound quality jumps from soundboard to bootleg and back again. It's original, and it's ear-achingly annoying, and for that matter, so is the rest of the album. Remember's core flaw is its pacing. Disc One in particular is a marathon that's run like a sprint. Those frantic medleys are never as relentless in person as the digital fiction constructed on this record; this is anxious music that's been honed to its most keyed-up sections with no release, endlessly dry-humping your ear. A rare half-minute of downtime during ""Don't Dance Her Down"" is stomped by a synth blitzkrieg while Eleanor's vocals-- whose scraps of lyrics have become arbitrary and meaningless-- sound ever-more hectoring. And then comes ""Single Again"", again. The disc fares better in small chunks. The Blueberry Boat tracks include ferocious bootlegs and classic rock guitarwork, yet the album's long epics fall victim to the most aggressive editing: ""Chief Inspector Blancheflower"" roars up to what could've been the album's best moment before it cuts abruptly to a deathly quiet recording of the Friedbergers having a sibling moment. ""Chris Michaels"", opening Disc Two, is the only track to get through unscathed. The Bitter Tea section with added percussionist Michael Goodman comes across with the best flow and the fewest distractions, and the brisker, grandmother-free Rehearsing My Choir material stays just on the right side of manic. But by the end, Widow City is cut to a taster that whizzes by in the last few minutes-- which is ironic, since the that tour has featured straightforward, song-by-song setlists. Remember disappoints because it cheats us out of the chance to hear a near-miracle. The Friedbergers always go into the studio with erratic ideas and indulgent conceits-- Inuit lyrics, quirk-prog fables, tongue-in-cheek chance compositions, and of course, the underappreciated tale of Olga Sarantos. Yet they always take these disparate ideas and pull them together with a solid conceit, consistent themes, and deliberately naïve bravado. It's something else to see them pull off the same trick on tour, where the stakes are so much higher. The joy of watching them not fly off the rails made even the weaker shows worth hearing. But in turning that experience into a scrapbook, Remember kills the magic. Put simply, it's strange for such a great album band to make a live record that fails as an album. But give it credit for one thing: It captures the live experience, warts and all. Why else would they include Eleanor flubbing a line right on track two, after they went to such pains making all the other edits? Feel free to invent your own meta-message about the unpredictability of touring, the chaos of tackling ever-trickier setlists for stubborn hipster crowds, and the spirit of taking risks in the moment that could haunt you to the rest of your days. Take it with a sense of humor. Or just trust the sleevenotes, which warn, ""Please do not attempt to listen to all at once.""","The Fiery Furnaces finally put their infamous live shows on record-- and as the band does onstage, the record re-arranges and shuffles songs and moments, with Matt Friedberger and bassist and mixer Jason Loewenstein splicing several gigs into seamless medleys (one per CD) that span all the band's studio albums in two hour-plus marathons.

Correcto,Correcto,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc77ea9e61561daa74a8/1:1/w_160/ab8aa926.jpg,2008-08-20 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12102-correcto/,Domino,"They've been dubbed a Scottish indie supergroup, but for those not subscribed to either contemporary Glaswegian rock or Domino's mailing list, just call Correcto as you see 'em-- another plucky indie rock band. Hiring Franz Ferdinand drummer Paul Thomson nets these guys some catchet, and ex-Royal We bassist Patrick Doyle will rile up hometown crowds, but in reality Correcto's little more than a vessel for little-known singer/songwriter Danny Saunders. Unfortunately, the band fancies its tenuous supergroup status a little too strongly, and there's little built-in intrigue here to hedge the threadbare compositions and lackadaisical attitude. On the bright side, these guys clearly dig all the bands you do. From the windmill power chords of Townsend-esque opener ""Inuit"" to the tear-in-beer-glass drawl of fake Libertines ballad ""When You Get Away From Me"", this debut provides a walking tour of Great Britain's rich rock history. That said, the tour's a look-don't-touch deal, with many of the hit-and-run genre shifts feeling brusque and unfulfilling. Saunders exudes an airtight ennui in his vocals, a nice tactic to use when blatantly copping your influences, but his versatility gets stretched to its limits. Sure, he can rough up the Buzzcock-y melody of no-brainer single ""Joni"", but on mellower tracks like ""Walking To Town"" or ""Even Though"", Saunders can't decide whether to go off-pitch completely or hope all his cussing and self-loating distracts the listener from otherwise cutesy melodies. When they're not dragging their feet through droopy Britpop dirges, Correcto bag some noteworthy rawk tracks, each one pumping its fist in its own nuanced way. ""Do It Better"" accurately captures Wire's twitchy guitar work, but the barked vocals claim the song for Correcto. Even when they get sloppy and act all irreverent, the band can't hide the fact that they want these hooks to sound huge. Saunders may let his delivery sag on ""Here It Comes"", but the epic opening guitar riff belies his tongue-in-cheek understatement. ""Something Or Nothing"" almost sounds like Pavement, tranquilizing a Stooges-style power chord flurry until it lapses into a jazzy, laid back chorus of ""ooh's."" Even considering these highlights, though, Correcto's debut feels sparse and indifferent, and it has little to do with Saunders' fuck-'em-all demeanor. The tracks follow a typical rock album progression for rock album's sake, with little indication of any higher artistic aim. There's a big opener, a pair of singles, then mashers neatly separated by ballads until the half hour's up. Obviously the band's middling in low stakes territory here, but the filler could at least be a lot more fun if it's not going to be challenging. Maybe for Glaswegian scenesters, this outfit is their Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young or Cream, but most outsiders will find this supergroup sounding pretty mortal.","With members of Franz Ferdinand and the Royal We in tow, Correcto's been called a Scottish indie supergroup; in reality, they're a vessel for little-known singer/songwriter Danny Saunders.

Electric Aborigines,Awesome Color,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc725e6ef95969322e4f/1:1/w_160/0a19d67a.jpg,2008-08-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12097-electric-aborigines/,Awesome Color,"The MC5, 1968: ""The Motor City is burning."" Awesome Color, 2008: ""In Detroit, the fires burn."" Beyond suggesting that, after 40 years, Detroit is no more closer to joining the ranks of America's most livable cities, these lines don't so much illustrate what connects Brooklyn-via-Ann Arbor trio Awesome Color and their spiritual forbears-- namely shared Michigan roots and a mutual love of fierce, fuzzboxed riffage beefed up by a fleeting free-jazz jones-- as what separates them. Coming from the MC5, the song ""Motor City Is Burning"" was a direct response to the race riots that had set the city ablaze in 1967, but also a resigned one, its sluggish bluesy lurch suggesting that, in an impoverished America, violent urban unrest is a sad inevitability. Awesome Color's ""Burning"", on the other hand, is not some Iraq-era update to the MC5's Vietnam-generation address; it's really just about burning shit up on a Devil's Night bender, because, presumably, fire is, like, totally rad. That would make Electric Aborigines something like Kick Out the Jams as rewritten by Beavis and Butthead, which isn't a completely ridiculous proposition-- for all their John Sinclair sermonizing and White Panther provocation, the MC5 just wanted to get laid like any other bunch of longhairs (""I'm the man for ya baby!"") and as such, Awesome Color's band of scuzz-rock is decidedly less interested in teenage riots than teenage lust. In their hands, an exhortation to ""step up!"" is not a call to arms to overthrow the government, but a stern warning not get cock-blocked by other dudes in the bar who are macking on the same girl you've been eyeing. If Electric Aborigines assumes a pronounced cock-rock strut than Awesome Color's more wiggy 2006 debut, it's a shift that at least accurately reflects the evolution of Michigan rock at the turn of the 1970s, when the MC5 and their proto-punk peers the Stooges were swept aside by the arena-conquering likes of Grand Funk and Ted Nugent. That's not to suggest the band have degenerated into Jet-level bar-band buffoonery; Awesome Color's formidable guitarchitecture still produces some moments of awe-- particularly in the gale-force psych-jazz splatter of the opening ""Eyes of Light""-- and their riffs don't so much crunch as twitch and tremble, lending them a simmering tension that makes the band something more threatening and strange than a simple classic-rock revivalist act. But all the energy expended on figuring out cool effects-pedal settings means that certain other matters-- melodies, hooks, lyrics-- are treated as after-thoughts. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if the band were dealing in extended, Comets on Fire-style freakouts, but the songs on Electric Aborigines are beholden to traditional verse/chorus/geetah structures that ultimately emphasize their shortcomings in the songwriting department. So what you're left with are half-baked tunes that confuse the repetitive for anthemic (""Outside Tonight"", ""Step Up""), or that issue vague commands to ""taste it right now"" (""Taste It"") and ""do it right tonight"" (""Do It Right""), without really making us give a shit about the ""it."" Like the Hallow's Eve fires described on the aforementioned ""Burning"", Electric Aborigines is a celebration of cheap thrills without purpose. But even if you're prepared to accept it on those limited terms, you still feel short-changed.","This Brooklyn-via-Ann Arbor trio shares not only geography but also a love of fierce, fuzzboxed riffage beefed up by fleeting free-jazz with progenitors the MC5.

My Fellow Sophisticates,William F. Gibbs,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc655e6ef95969322e34/1:1/w_160/cfd12e52.jpg,2008-08-20 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12086-my-fellow-sophisticates/,Old Man,"William F. Gibbs makes what I might term pop Americana. His music takes the country, folk, soul, and rock that fills our past and provides an indie rock distillation that's easily accessible and, if not terribly unique, pleasant to listen to. His tendency to leap into his falsetto range in otherwise normal-range passages is his most distinctive vocal calling card-- regardless of the register he sings in, his voice has just a touch of grit at the edges. On his debut album, My Fellow Sophisticates, the South Carolina songwriter sounds comfortable in his songs and gives the overall impression of mid-1990s Grant Lee Buffalo viewed through the lens of M. Ward. At the album's heart lie two songs that indicate Gibbs' future potential. ""Brother John!"", a song about an unbelieving priest, opens with a brief choral passage (not a full choir, just Gibbs and some friends) before leaping into a locomotive rhythm that buoys an excellent vocal melody that leans away from the falsetto in favor of a rapid-fire delivery that boosts the song's momentum. Shouted backing vocals and a wild, ragged guitar solo add even more frazzled energy to the song. ""Here Comes Your Steamboat Brother! Here Comes Your Freightline Sister!"" has a similar underlying rhythm, but the country-ish lead guitar lines and female backing vocals give it more of an Appalachian feel-- he sounds like he's learned from M. Ward's propensity for combining roots music with flowing electric guitar lines. The album's musical extremes provide its two other most pronounced high points. Gibbs spins a wonderful, organ-soaked ballad on ""Oh Pollyanna"", keeping the rhythm moving forward with acoustic guitar and piano as he sifts through love's contradictions, singing ""If I could lie to make you happy/ I think I should."" At the other end of the spectrum, ""Streetfighter"" is a tough, funky rock song with heavy drums and chicken-scratch guitars that offers a late burst of energy near the end of the album, where it feels needed after the slow and hazy ""Operate"" and ""Ankle Deep in the Atlantic"". On the former of those two, his falsetto trick begins to feel like a lazy ornament, though the guitar solo, which sounds a bit like George Harrison, is nice. The album's low point is ""LA Money"", which is just a generic slice of modern singer-songwriter fodder. Gibbs is at his best when he can cook up a good rhythm to push his songs along, and he does that often enough to make this a solid debut. He has clear talent as a songwriter and an interesting voice that he should be able to do great things with if he can break out of simply using his range to borrow an occasional note from a neighboring octave. While it may be uneven, the good parts of My Fellow Sophisticates outweigh the bland.","Drawing from country, folk, soul, and rock, the debut from this South Carolina singer-songwriter gives the impression of mid-1990s Grant Lee Buffalo viewed through the lens of M.

Total 9,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc88ea9e61561daa74c8/1:1/w_160/10e16555.jpg,2008-08-20 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12116-total-9/,Numero Group,"People have complained about the institutionalization of the Kompakt brand for so long now that the complaint itself has become something of a cliché, and it seems gauche even to acknowledge it here. More surprising than the persistent quality of the German dance label's annual compilations is the fact that anyone expects anything else at that stage: Its apparently endless stream of glistening tech-house chugathons shows no sign of flagging. It's a reliability that conjures up descriptions rarely applied to dance music-- ""staunch"" and ""stalwart"" come to mind. But reliability invites complacent enjoyment, which can easily degenerate into contempt. It probably doesn't help that the last few volumes of the Total series have progressively sanded down the label's spikier tendencies in an increasing commitment to softcore lushness. On Total 9, only the blocky, discordant piano strut of Wolfgang Voigt's ""Geduld"" reflects how Kompakt releases could occasionally make for difficult listening back in the day, and the fact that Voigt resurrects his old Freiland moniker for this track suggests he's keenly aware of the label's changed identity. If the excellent Total 7 was the label's prettiest collection, and the quite-good Total 8 its most fashionably Detroit-inspired, this year's marginally superior round-up embraces both of those attributes and pushes them further. Disc Two delves deeper than ever before into the melodic, viscous, trance-inflected techno that is becoming the label's bread and butter, offering a puree of synth sweeps that coalesce into arpeggios, harden into riffs, blur into chords, and then melt into dub echo-- most radically on Kaito's ""Everlasting Dub"". As mood muzak it's superlative, if occasionally forgettable, though it's hard to fault the delicate Detroit ripples of Dubshape's ""Droplets (Early Night Mix)"", or the gorgeously aching throb of Jonas Bering's ""I Can't Stop Loving You"". Disc One may be the label's most pop-minded assemblage, as well as its most light-hearted, as if the arch cheerfulness of last year's Supermayer album opened a floodgate. Jürgen Paape's irresistible ""Come Into My Life"" is the label's shiniest piece of propulsive pop-house to date, while Supermayer's ""Hey Hotties"" is a radical improvement on the dubious disco-funk blueprint they established with ""The Art of Letting Go""; conversely, the grin of Superpitcher's Soul II Soul-mangling solo effort ""Disko (You Don't Care)"" comes off slightly forced. Happily, all is forgiven with his marvelous (albeit self-cannibalizing) brood-fest collaboration with Congosound, ""Say I'm Your Number One"". But the real standouts come from the label's two resident malcontents: DJ Koze's ""Zouzou"" reconstructs ""tribal house"" with only the genre's name to go on, offering a disorienting melange of grunts, sighs, whispers, and fluttering gamelan; even better is Matias Aguayo's sly, addictive ""Minimal"", a tongue-in-cheek critique of contemporary European techno (""'cause that music got no groove
got no balls
no me hace pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'!"") performed as sleazy mutant disco. Moments like these provide a timely reminder of how perverse the label's muse can be, even as it becomes more familiar with age. Ideally, the Kompakt aesthetic wouldn't need to change: imagine its core group of artists as a tech-house equivalent of the Blue Nile, periodically emerging from their hermitage to unleash another collection of perfectionist and atemporal emo-house, unabashedly lush and swooningly romantic. Were Kompakt less prolific, less popular, and (above all) less available, one could well imagine such a brand-preserving mystique accumulating around their timeless aesthetic. After all, a moribund fetish for privation is basically all that keeps the critical hosannas for Basic Channel-aping dub-techno flowing thick and fast. In this sense, Kompakt are hamstrung by the inescapable fact of being a major dance label, heroically attempting to regularly satisfy the demands of both superclubs and solitude. This allows the label to produce two reasonably solid discs of highlights each year-- an enviable feat-- but in dance music healthy activity can cut both ways: a glut of good product can clog up the waterways, making lines of flight and innovation hard to see and even harder to move towards. Dissatisfactions with Kompakt are for the most part less about Kompakt itself than what its persistence represents; a world in which the label remains viable, let alone pre-eminent, is a world without revolutions or ""year zero"" transformations. Total 9's biggest talking-point is Jorg Bürger's ""Modernism Begins at Home"", a gentle lounge-house cover of Human Resource's brutalist early nineties rave anthem ""Dominator"", its cheerful, polite rejoinders (""in other words, sucker, there is no other!"") and lush arrangement reminiscent of Senor Coconut injecting a tropical sway into Kraftwerk's ""Showroom Dummies"". Conceptually, if not sonically, it's the ideal Kompakt track, more about rave culture rather than of it, and seeking to short-circuit the distance between dance music's (increasingly rare) penchant for functionalist oblivion and its keen sense of history, the outside, the everything else it forsakes in pursuit of that goal. This has been Kompakt's story since before its inception, ever since Wolfgang Voigt looped eerie, faded German schlager vocals over a murky schaffel groove on ""Fackeln Im Sturm"" 10 years ago. A good story, and well-told still, but there's less cause to hold your breath when you already know how it ends.","Still a reliable brand in 21st century dance music, Kompakt offers its ninth (!) installment of the now stalwart Total series. Among the artists featured are label bosses Wolfgang Voigt, Michael Mayer, and Jürgen Paape, plus Superpitcher, Justus Köhncke, Gui Boratto, and Kaito.

Oceans Will Rise,The Stills,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8013d197565213b33a/1:1/w_160/61bd734a.jpg,2008-08-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12110-oceans-will-rise/,Arts & Crafts,"It’s hard to remember that not too long ago Echo & the Bunnymen worship seemed novel and stealing from Joy Division seemed edgy, but after countless forgettable albums by countless forgettable bands, brooding post-post-punk has lost its power to effect. Montreal's the Stills were lucky; they got in under the gun in 2003 with Logic Will Break Your Heart, a good, not great, collection of classic gothic tones, percussive guitars, and expansive melodies (made all the more dramatic by Tim Fletcher's lovely, expressive voice). Smartly, by the time fickle crowds had moved on, so had the Stills, embracing a looser, Americana-influenced sound on 2006's Without Feathers. Across both albums are wonderful singles (though none as infectiously winning as their first, ""Still in Love Song""), but also an awful lot of filler. And with a sound that is so mercurial and a spotty hit-to-dud ratio, it's easy to be trepidatious about album number three. Luckily, Oceans Will Rise is at least on par with its predesessors. Here the Stills have reconciled the mannered 1980s sound that first got them noticed with the open-hearted earthiness of their sophomore effort. For instance, album opener ""Don't Talk Down"", with its synthesizer effects and spacey harmonies, takes on shades of the Steve Miller Band's ""Fly Like An Eagle"" (albeit with flashes of the sort of ""Killing Moon"" swooning you've come to expect from the Stills). And ""Hands on Fire"" has the sexy high gloss and decadent melody of Rilo Kiley's ""Dreamworld"", which is already a modern take on the easy, coke-party California of Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac. Those who preferred the twangy, grittier vibe of Feathers will be reassured by ""I'm With You"", with its acoustic guitar underpinning and Fletcher's Bono-like, earnest delivery, and ""Statue of Sirens"", with its electric arpeggios and intimate vocals. But the darkly romantic, epic overtones of their debut are back, too, though in a rawer form. Sleek ""Panic"" would've sounded at home on Logic but for the intricacy of the multi-part harmonies singing the chorus (the mark of a maturing band) and the shockingly brutal and delightfully out-of-place percussion freak-out that comes roughly two-minutes in (the mark of a more experimental one). For a group that has always been chasing the dragon of their breakthrough hit, it must be sweet relief to come as close as they do on the album’s first single, ""Being Here"", which blooms from its ethereal, droning opening to a sunny chug, climaxing in an anthemic chorus. And ""Everything I Build"" is a welcome ballad. With a reverberating pulse and sweet, doo-wop-ballad bridge, it is bursting with the kind of heart that that bands like Interpol (to whom the Stills have constantly been compared) have always sorely lacked. But there is filler here too. The repetition in ""Snakecharming the Masses"" is a blatant attempt to out-Radiohead Radiohead, but without a hook to hold on to or some more dynamic melody choices, it falls flat. And ""Eastern Europe"" is enjoyable as a tightly coiled Spoon homage, but the Stills wear the song like an ill-fitting suit. Oceans Will Rise is not a bad album, but it is very much the sound of a band still trying to figure out who they are-- and in fairness, they have lost and gained a member since their first record. But three albums into a career, they should have a better idea than this.","On their third album, the Stills have reconciled the mannered 1980s sound that first got them noticed with the open-hearted earthiness of their sophomore effort, creating a record with the kind of heart that bands like Interpol have always sorely lacked.

And yet here I am, reviewing in August an album released in April (and self-released in 2007) to little fanfare anywhere save a handful of mp3 blogs. A few spins through the record, though, and the reason for the band's relative anonymity presents itself: they're taken for granted or simply missed altogether because they sound so familiar. Jealous Girlfriends make straightforward, moody, and melodic guitar rock, in a niche established by the more stylish New York guitar bands of the past five years. If Interpol, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, Blonde Redhead, etc. formed a mini wave, then Jealous Girlfriends are what washed up on the shore a bit after the initial tide receded. The current quartet, which has been kicking around since 2004, represent a tidy compendium of their predecessors' slick, dense production, howling vocals, and dark subject matter. The Girlfriends' vocal duties are split between Holly Miranda, blessed with a Karen O/Katrina Ford wail, and Josh Abbott, whose macho howl most closely resembles Billy McCarthy, lead singer of Brooklyn's Pela. They harmonize well-- dig the sweeping ""I Quit""-- and Abbott gets center stage on a few numbers, but Miranda is the main attraction here, able to command the spotlight on the woozy, hopeful album-opener ""Secret Identity"" as well as the (unfortunately-titled) highlight ""Roboxulla"", a wistful and narcotic piano-driven ditty straight from the Concretes' 2004 playbook. Abbott beefs things up a bit on the blustery ""How Now"" then airs it out again with the electronic flourishes of ""The Pink Wig to My Salieri"", which ends with a majestic synth/guitar/""na na na""earworm that takes a while to dislodge. At their best, the Girlfriends suggest they've got the ability to crank much more of this stuff out in the future. They've certainly got the chops to move beyond their influences, but the Girlfriends' combination of vibe-- musical as well as lyrical, as their gently bitter name would suggest-- and sticky hooks gets a bit predictable and sameish as it plays. The record's core signposts might be a few years past their sell-by date, but their familiarity has led to one sort of notice: Savvy television viewers will recognize more than a quarter of the record from spots on a few popular shows: ""Lay Around"" appeared on Showtime's ""The L Word"", ""Something in the Water"" and ""Roboxulla"" on ""Grey's Anatomy"", and ""Carry Me"" could be heard on ""CSI: Miami"". This must be some sort of record, but it's also evidence that the Jealous Girlfriends are nothing if not pros, who know how to absorb and reshape their surroundings into tunes which, when they catch you just right, sound perfectly comfortable.","The band name might not sound familiar, but if you've been watching television lately, about a quarter of the songs will.

Mothertongue,Nico Muhly,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc53abf31b7dc7155cc2/1:1/w_160/7045d9e2.jpg,2008-08-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12070-mothertongue/,Bedroom Community,"At 26 years old, the uncannily poised and precocious Nico Muhly has already reached a level of success most classical composers only dream about. He studied at Juilliard under Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Corigliano; he works for Philip Glass; he writes string arrangements for Antony Hegarty and Will Oldham; and he was recently the subject of an eight-page New Yorker profile, in which Rebecca Mead followed him around Chinatown, reporting on his apartment décor, iPod playlists, and ragù-making methods. (The photo accompanying the article, an arresting shot of Muhly's impossibly wide blue peepers, was captioned: ""Muhly's eclecticism is facilitated by both Google and iTunes."") Muhly's works are practically ubiquitous on new-music programs in New York these days, and Peter Gelb, the hotshot new general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, has alluded to plans to commission a Muhly opera. In other words, Muhly has attained certifiable whiz-kid status in an impossibly short time. He's become the de facto poster boy for a growing movement of young composers divorced from the rock-vs-classical culture wars of the 1970s. (In their genre-blind abandon, such composers have, on occasion, been known to go so far as to publicly endorse the music of both Radiohead and Björk.) The wide-ranging catholicism of Muhly's resumé is heartening, and he has done exquisite work on some seminal indie records. The unearthly strings on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's The Letting Go are his, for example. (But not those on Björk's ""Hidden Place"", as we had incorrectly claimed-- thx/sorry, Björk.) But Muhly's solo albums-- the recently released Mothertongue and his previous record, Speaks Volumes-- suffer from glib imitation and facile pastiche, common failings among talented and clever young musicians. The problem is most evident on the album's opening ""Mothertongue"" suite. Over a distinctly Dntel-sounding electronic buzz (sync it up with ""The Dream of Evan and Chan"" for reference), mezzo-soprano Abigail Fisher speak-sings a series of numbers and place names-- a jumble of all the different addresses Muhly has called home during his life, the liner notes inform us. The four-movement piece lights briefly on some promising notions in its twenty minutes-- found-sound samples of mundane morning routines (the crunch of breakfast cereal, muttering during the shower), for example-- but flits away distractedly before anything interesting is allowed to materialize. The suite is a tepid wash of atmospherics, ebbing away with the same air of dreamy inconsequence with which it drifted in. You know you're in trouble when the audio sample of a burbling coffee machine or the sound of a knife scraping butter on toast exerts as great a hold on the listener's interest as everything that preceded it. The second full piece on Mothertongue, the three-movement ""Wonders"", opens with tinkling harpsichord and the ethereal vocals of Icelandic singer Helgi Hrafn Jónsson, paying tribute to the choral music of Renaissance-era English composers like William Byrd and John Taverner. On paper, the work is a riot of ideas: to this regal setting, Muhly adds samples of whistling wind, the sound of butcher knives scraping together, and whale fat sloshing around in a bucket. Yet the curiously faceless result reflects none of this anarchic, try-anything spirit-- again, mostly because Muhly seems unable to let any of these ideas settle or gather any weight. Instead, they come and go leaving little impression-- after having listened through the piece several times, I'd still be hard-pressed to tell you where that bowl of whale flesh comes in. The record's single striking moment comes when Muhly lets friend and singer-songwriter Sam Amidon croon a plaintive, simple folk song over a plunking banjo in ""The Only Tune"". Even then, Muhly doodles irritatingly with the song, under the impression, apparently, that randomly isolating vocal lines and surrounding them with Reich-aping repetitive figures represents, as he puts it, ""an explosion of the folk song."" Here and elsewhere, the music's glassy surface never reveals greater depths, and the result comes off like minimalism for the age of ""continuous partial attention."" (Interestingly enough, in the same New Yorker profile, Mead mentions that Muhly, while composing, will often simultaneously maintain ""multiple online conversations"" and ""many games of Internet scrabble."" Irrelevant, maybe, but one wonders: If the composer doesn't bother to give this music his undivided attention, why should anyone else?) To his credit, Muhly has talent and an eager curiosity; the problem is, this inquisitive intelligence often finds more meaningful expression in his interviews (or on his gabby, regularly updated blog) than in his music. His best work remains in the indie sphere, where his skillful arrangements and expansive musical vocabulary offer welcome dimension to pop songs. He has also demonstrated himself to be a musical ambassador par excellence, a patient, generous, and enthusiastic bringer-together of worlds. This skill was eminently on display in the Brooklyn Philharmonic's transcendent concert with Antony and the Johnsons last fall, for which Muhly wrote the arrangements. Thanks to Muhly's irreverent streak, the concert's encore included a fully orchestrated take on Beyoncé's ""Crazy in Love"" that transformed the original's synapse-fusing excess into mournful, restrained chamber pop. It was the sort of unlikely alchemy at which Muhly excels.

And I Love H.E.R.: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Danny!,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6113d197565213b2e2/1:1/w_160/75c015cb.jpg,2008-08-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12082-and-i-love-her-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,1911 Music,"Making a hip-hop concept record in which the unifying referents are the Beatles and Common's ""I Used to Love H.E.R."" sounds like a recipe for stodgy, safe-as-milk canonical hell, and those aren't the only strikes against South Carolina rapper-producer and recent Def Jux signee Daniel Swain. The young man who performs as Danny! has already spent much of his brief career simultaneously cleaving towards and sternly rebuffing a musical and image-based resemblance to Kanye West, who, by the way, himself recently released a song that borrowed Common's gimmick of describing a relationship with an impersonal thing (in West's case, Chicago) through the metaphor of a romantic dalliance-- a song, no less, that Swain actually freaking quotes on his new album, And I Love H.E.R. For the record, Swain is far better described as a less-righteous Lupe Fiasco than any kind of Kanye clone, and surprisingly And I Love H.E.R. is an engaging, thoroughly promising album regardless of its dubious origins. Yes, a great many of these songs can be heard as veiled presentations of Swain's complex feelings towards hip-hop, but for the most part you can also take them on their face and still be no less rewarded (and quite possibly more enriched). A thousand words could be spent on pondering why some of rap's most honest and affecting odes directed at a feminine Other have actually been personifications not at all concerned with flesh-and-blood women, but Swain may be able to have it both ways here. If you read the successive tracks ""I Want H.E.R. (She's So Heavy)"" and ""At What Price"" as genuine meditations on the rosy and sour sides of love, they're truly satisfying, avoiding assholishness, and perhaps more importantly, avoiding self-congratulation for avoiding assholishness. Temporarily letting down even the pretense of his conceptual guard, Swain hones in on the source of much of his generation's gendered antipathy, dedicating ""Do You"" to portraying how the roots of misogyny are planted in unstable homes. Swain seems eminently capable of empathy, but most of his time is spent chewing on deeply personal concerns, with the result being that the record can feel a bit hermetic at times. Lucky for him, then, that his personality is sufficiently engaging and his music sufficiently buoyant that we don't mind following him down his private rabbit holes, especially not when he flashes such consistent cleverness, boasting that ""No one's effin' with me on this Guitar Hero shit,"" taking a jab at Tyler Perry's Madea plays, and dropping references to Flickr, Theo Huxtable, and Colin Quinn. While Swain's grappling with the pressures and pitfalls of hip-hop may occasionally grow tendentious, he doesn't allow grouchiness or self-excoriation to seep into his music either. In fact, the beats on And I Love H.E.R. offer a fascinating counterpoint to his navel-gazing, being almost uniformly generous, breezy, and life-affirming. Of course, were the lush strings of ""Intro"" or warm horns of ""Guess Who's Back"" paired with equally insouciant lyrics, the effect might trend towards the too-relaxed province of a thousand blithe Golden Age revivalists, so it's a blessing that Swain does almost always remember to undercut his symphonic settings with serious ruminations or sardonic wit, skewering the sunny ""Hey Ya"" lilt of ""The Groove"" with a mid-song mocking interpolation of ""Crank That (Soulja Boy)"". Still, the shopworn agonizing over hip-hop's strictures and shortcomings you can read in ""Where You Goin'"" and ""After the Love Has Gone"" do represent a sore worried too insistently. The brightest hope for Swain's future lies in him finding a way to channel his internal wrestling into the stuff of wider resonance, which is exactly what makes the drum-laden ""Wanderland"" the album's most compelling moment. Swain offers vignettes of a 37 year-old, eternally aspiring emcee tired of ""seeing the same 112 fans on MySpace"" and an archetypal starry-eyed girl who goes to California to pursue singing dreams but ends up duped and ""on the pole."" But these characters aren't just cautionary tales to Swain, they're kindred spirits, and recounting their struggles pushes him to ponder, ""I fear I'm headed down the same path sometimes/ Worried if my dreams of hittin' big are asinine.""","South Carolina rapper/producer, who already has several under-the-radar releases to his credit, continues to mature and gain confidence; here he could be described as a less-righteous Lupe Fiasco, an artist capable of empathy who spends most of his time chewing on deeply personal concerns.

Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us,Death Vessel,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7313d197565213b318/1:1/w_160/35dfb7dd.jpg,2008-08-19 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12098-nothing-is-precious-enough-for-us/,Sub Pop,"Simple and modest, Joel Thibodeau's music is more versatile than it lets on. On first listen, his second album as Death Vessel may seem passive, even flat-- just competent, non-descript folk-rock. Give it time, though, and Nothing Is Precious Enough For Us proves more intriguing. Thibodeau's un-flashy songs dip into many genres-- country, jazz, bluegrass, even hard rock-- with a subtlety that makes their range easy to miss. But then almost everything about Thibodeau's music is easy to miss, due to the hypnotic appeal of his voice. A flowing, siren-like croon, it has garnered attention for how feminine it sounds. But even more stunning is its effortless power. Thibodeau rarely varies his style or cadences, often staying locked in step with each melody, yet his singing is consistently striking. Though his enunciation is a bit blurry and he's slightly buried in the mix, his voice shines like a high-beam through fog, more emotive instrument than literal communicator. Even when you can hear what Thibodeau is singing, his meaning is elusive. Characters and descriptions hide and disappear, with restraint that seems fearful of language. ""I am versed in silence,"" he purrs in ""Block My Eye"", a tune that pulls back whenever it could step forward. Later, ""Bruno's Torso"" offers a hero who's ""bad at words"" and deals in ""unspoken promises,"" a ""mantis without a prayer."" Even on the bouncy ""Obadiah in Oblivion"", Thibodeau sounds cryptically shy: ""If halvsies are equal to none/ And nothing is precious enough for us/ Then we are none, perfectly none."" Musically, the album is similarly restrained. Most songs have simple melodies with sparse accents, a mix akin to late-period Camper Van Beethoven. The best are gentle and meticulous, such as the fading ""Peninsula"" and the banjo-driven hymn ""Fences Around Field"". But Thibodeau can muscle up too-- on ""Exploded View"", his forceful swing culminates in a noisy guitar solo. A final climax comes on ""Circa"", whose swaying melody recalls Will Oldham circa Ease Down the Road. That conclusive tune would be a great ending to Nothing Is Precious Enough For Us, but Thibodeau falters by adding the slight ""Belt of Foam"", dragged down by a smarmy trumpet solo. He recovers immediately on ""Taken Up Again"", an instrumental that revisits previous melodies in winding-down, ready-for-bed mode. Subtracting his voice from that final song is a risky move, but an appropriate one for an album that suggests literal words are no match for suggestive sound.","Joel Thibodeau's second album as Death Vessel (and first for Sub Pop) proves more intriguing over time, as his un-flashy songs dip into many genres-- country, jazz, bluegrass, even hard rock-- with a subtlety that makes their range easy to miss.

Chemical Chords,Stereolab,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8a5e6ef95969322e7e/1:1/w_160/01518761.jpg,2008-08-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12118-chemical-chords/,4AD,"Part of the fun of following Stereolab over the years has been following the declarations of mastermind Tim Gane, who has an uncanny ability to plant contextual seeds of albums in advance. The albums don't need it necessarily, but from the beginning-- when Stereolab paid prescient tribute to the likes of Neu! and Martin Denny-- on through to their present triumphant twilight, Gane has always come across as an ideal kind of character: a mix between a thoughtful critic and an excitable collector geek who gets off on trying out the ideas he hears on records he loves. Before 2004's Margerine Eclipse, Gane talked about using puddles of rhythm as the basis for songs that sparkled like reflections. For the new Chemical Chords, he's spoken of making good on an affinity for Motown. To mention it more than once is to overstate the degree to which Chemical Chords actually does sound like Motown, but another part of the fun of following Stereolab is listening in for subtleties of inflection. With a sound so omnivorous and open to influences that span decades and styles (not to mention planets), the Stereolab discography has become a series of churning extrapolations on a steadfast set of ideas. And Chemical Chords counts among the best of those extrapolations, no matter how familiar that original set of ideas has grown in time. ""Neon Beanbag"" opens on a jaunty note, with organs on harpsichord settings and Laetitia Sadier doing her scat-minded best to summon the spirit of doo-wop. The Motown influence is hearable in the way the guitar slides around from chord to chord, in swing-time and not embarrassed to fall a bit behind the beat if it means racking up style points. ""Three Women"" follows with a little extra wiggle and the kind of bulbous two-note bass-line that might have come out of Detroit in the days before funk changed things. Horns figure into many of the songs on Chemical Chords, all of them intricately arranged but most surveyed rather impressively as accents more than as subjects themselves. To that end, the whole album has a lightness of touch that makes it sound warm and comfortable, especially after the sad weight evident on the also-excellent Margerine Eclipse. The songs sound tossed off in the best way: not as sketches that could have benefited from more time or care, but as songs that just presented themselves in the studio and submitted to being laid down in simple terms. ""Valley Hi!"" is a driving pop song with a catchy lean, with Sadier singing in a trance of falling melodies delivered with her special brand of disinterested zeal. ""Silver Sands"" bounds along with circles of loopy xylophone. ""Nous Vous Demandons Pardon"" sounds like three or four different moody Emperor Tomato Ketchup-era tracks fitted together in a deft assemblage. And then there's ""The Ecstatic Static"", a cosmic rendering of Brian Wilson chords pushed along at a pregnantly plodding tempo, with strings falling out and martial drums angling in: It draws on every era of Stereolab's past without seeming concerned with anything more than what might sound cool in the next measure.","With a sound so omnivorous and open to influences that span decades and styles, Stereolab have carved one of the more intriguing and rewarding catalogs of the past 15 years; their new horn-laded album, Chemical Chords is one of their strongest outings in some time.

True North,The Occasional Keepers,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc66c0084474cd0c2aa4/1:1/w_160/60fa845d.jpg,2008-08-18 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12087-true-north/,LTM,"When it comes to soft, sad, suburban indie pop, few can claim more classic songs than Bobby Wratten, whose band the Field Mice helped sensitive kids survive those dark years between the Smiths and Belle and Sebastian. In his recent albums with Trembling Blue Stars, however, Wratten's music has largely gone from bedsit to bedtime. Despite the usual highlight or two, the English songwriter's latest studio collaboration with Carolyn Allen and Gerard ""Caesar"" McInulty (both formerly of fellow Sarah Records band the Wake) is more of the snooze. The three-piece came together as the Occasional Keepers for 2005's The Beauty of the Empty Vessel, a slow-paced album of acoustic introspection, at its best on atmospheric ballad ""Rose-Scented Fire"". Follow-up True North points its compass down the same path, bringing along additional electronic elements. Longtime collaborator Ian Catt, also known for his work with Saint Etienne and Heavenly, ensures the album is at least vividly produced. Using field recordings, True North conjures up a cold, quiet, foggy North Country the way its predecessor managed to channel the arctic blur of its cover. Opener ""If the Ravens Leave"", an Allen-McInulty composition, mingles everyday concerns with images of falling kingdoms, setting the scene with the album's most irresistible melody. The Wake duo's ""Town of 85 Lights"" marks the biggest departure from the last outing, working a horn-backed groove that Beck wouldn't turn down. It's outshone, however, by Wratten's gentler melancholia on ""Leave the Secret There Forever"", which evokes not only his reclusive persona, but also the loss of control that artists have over their work-- particularly in the digital era-- once it's unveiled to the world. As with any lengthy expedition, True North can be a drag when it gets monotonous. ""Factory Records"" is a lumbering, ambient instrumental with a great name (the Wake also recorded for Factory), but its sustained synth swells, yearning bass line, and melodica fail to hold interest for all six minutes. Beth Arzy of Trembling Blue Stars and Southern California indie-poppers Aberdeen sings on ""The Life of the Fields"", a folk-tinged song about a fertility ritual; despite delicately recorded acoustic guitar, set to the crackling of a fire, it's more like something you'd have to sing in school than a track you'd actually put on for pleasure. All the orchestral production in the world can't make soft-rocking eco-bummer ""I've Realized"" sound like an epiphany, and seven-minute finale ""A Distant Piano on a Foggy Night"" is more fog than piano. If you drift north long enough, you'll get pretty cold, but then before you know it you'll start to feel warm again. Turn back-- that's hypothermia.","Trio comprised of the Field Mice's Bobby Wratten, plus fellow Sarah Records expats Carolyn Allen and Gerard ""Caesar"" McInulty, release their follow-up to 2005's The Beauty of the Empty Vessle, blending electronic elements with field recordings to conjure up a cold, quiet, foggy North Country.

I Saw the Ghost of an Unknown Soul and It Said...,Okkyung Lee,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7cabf31b7dc7155d21/1:1/w_160/a91b9a10.jpeg,2008-08-18 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12106-i-saw-the-ghost-of-an-unknown-soul-and-it-said/,Ecstatic Peace,"Still just in her early thirties, cellist Okkyung Lee has already complied an impressive résumé. In the late 1990s, the Korean native earned a Bachelors in film scoring from Berklee and a Masters in improvisation from the New England Conservatory of Music. Moving to New York in 2000, she became a mainstay at the avant-garde nightclub Tonic, collaborating with a massive list of musicians including John Zorn, Nels Cline, Chris Corsano, and Thurston Moore. Lately, when she's not on the road as part of Laurie Anderson's touring ensemble, you can find her playing and volunteering at Zorn's Lower East Side performance space, the Stone. Lee's musical pursuits coalesced in 2005, when she put together her debut album for Zorn's Tzadik label, the mature and diverse Nihm. Working with an array of colleagues including drummer Tim Barnes and ex-DNA member Ikue Mori, Lee swung confidently from melodic jazz to chamber music to open improvisation. The album was a full summation of her talents, but it also represented a chance to clean her slate. Locking down versions of compositions she'd worked on for years allowed her to, as she said at the time, ""[achieve] some sense of final realization, and move on to something new."" ""Something new"" has turned out to be a lot of different things, including a duo recording with Christian Marclay and a book/CD collaboration with artist Colin Stinson. But Lee's furthest divergence from the composed, collaborative Nihm is I Saw the Ghost..., an LP of solo cello improvisations for Moore's Ecstatic Peace label. Recorded by Barnes in 2006, the session is by turns subdued and fiery, atonal and beatific, multi-phonic and minimal. Her all-alone musings can sound as stark and solitary as the silent films Andrew Lampert has made of her (a still from one graces the album's cover). But despite the change in format, Lee captures as many moods as she did on Nihm, perhaps even more. That range comes from the numerous sounds, notes, and noises Lee coaxes from her instrument. Bowing, slapping, and plucking her cello, she burrows a path of constant creation, akin to the hypnotic bass explorations of William Parker and the hyperactive violin journeys of Billy Bang. On opener ""One"", she scrapes out high tones that sound more like upper-register sax than cello. Tactile string rips dominate the epileptic bursts of ""Two"", while on ""Four"" she generates bird-like chirps evoking Eric Dolphy's outward-bound solos. Lee ends the album with her longest track, ""And..."", a stunning compendium of all the moves she's made to this point, as well as some new squalls, rumbles, and percussive slaps for good measure. Such limitless invention serves as both fitting end to I Saw the Ghost... and tantalizing hint of what Lee might dream up next. Her ambitious collaborations will surely continue; she already has September dates lined up with Corsano, Bill Nace, and Carlos Giffoni. But regardless of what her future discography holds, this album is another fine step in what will hopefully be a long journey of sonic discovery.","A mainstay in New York's avant-garde circles, cellist Okkyung Lee-- who has worked with John Zorn, Nels Cline, Chris Corsano, and Thurston Moore-- releases her first record for Moore's Ecstatic Peace label.

Popular Songs of Great Enduring Strength and Beauty,Camper Van Beethoven,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5beb335119a49ecc45/1:1/w_160/68d724f2.jpg,2008-08-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12077-popular-songs-of-great-enduring-strength-and-beauty/,Cooking Vinyl,"Camper Van Beethoven's college rock reign won the band much acclaim, and their original, impeccable, endlessly inventive run of 1985's Telephone Free Landslide Victory through its 1989 swan song Key Lime Pie has withstood the test of time. Yet despite all this, CVB remains somewhat unsung and overlooked. The line between smart and smart-aleck is a tough one to define, and CVB gleefully straddled that line almost until the very end, when the more serious turn CVB took with Key Lime Pie finally solidified the band's reputation. In retrospect, that disc may be the band's masterpiece, but at the time even some of its most ardent supporters didn't know what to make of it, and if it wasn't for David Lowery's subsequent success in Cracker, who knows? Maybe even the great Camper Van Beethoven would have been relegated to the dustbin of history, and their clever mix of ska, punk, Eastern European folk, psych, rock, raga, country, and beyond written off, forgetten or, worse, dismissed as novelty. Since stealthily reforming in 2000 or so, the group has made up for lost time, however erratically and confusingly. First came a mysterious compilation called Camper Van Beethoven is Dead. Long Live Camper Van Beethoven. Next came a track-for-track cover of Fleetwood Mac's Tusk, a longtime favorite of estranged violinist Jonathan Segel and a test to see if the reunited band could get along in the studio. In 2002, just about everything the band ever released was included in the boxed set Cigarettes & Carrot Juice: The Santa Cruz Years, which was packaged with a live disc amusingly called Greatest Hits Played Faster. That disc's the closest Camper Van Beethoven has ever come to releasing a best-of, and for good reason. Each of the band's albums is wonderfully sequenced (though annoyingly re-sequenced for the subsequent stand-alone reissue of the group's formative output), and the band's catalog is filled with so many gems any best-of is bound to leave many of them behind. It's better to just buy them all and make your own, really. Still, Popular Songs of Great Enduring Strength and Beauty, a new single-disc career overview, does a pretty good job capturing all that was great about Camper Van Beethoven, from the somber side to the silly side and all sides in between. Track for track, all 18 cuts, from the goofy ""The Day That Lassie Went to the Moon"" and ""Take the Skinheads Bowling"" to the somber ""All Her Favorite Fruit"" and ""Sad Lovers Waltz"", to the satirical ""When I Win the Lottery"" or ""Club Med Sucks"", hold up really well. While the hardcore might not appreciate hearing these songs in a radically new context, some care has obviously been taken to make sure the thing flows. To the group's credit, they don't try to sneak in any songs from their otherwise OK comeback New Roman Times, either. But then there's the matter of what's missing, songs such as sentimental favorites ""Heart"" and ""She Divines Water"", rockers ""(We're A) Bad Trip"" and ""Turquoise Jewelry"", or even any of the group's oddball covers of bands as diverse as Pink Floyd, Black Flag, the Kinks, the Clash, the Monkees, and Sonic Youth. Any fan will cite their own favorite glaring omission, though in the case of at least a few of the AWOL tracks, there may be a reason they didn't show up. Controversially-- or intriguingly-- the band had to re-record a handful of songs from its two-album Virgin catalog after the label refused to relinquish the masters (jerks). They're not remakes, they're careful recreations, and they're remarkably faithful to the originals, so all's good with these ""new"" versions of ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" ""Eye of Fatima"", and ""One of These Days"". Unless, like me, you think Chris Pedersen was one of the most creative drummers of the 1980s, and that Cracker drummer Frank Funaro isn't a total ringer for his idiosyncratic style. Or that Key Lime Pie is one of the coolest sounding albums of all time (David Lowery once told me to thank veteran engineer Csaba Petocz, as well as what was often the case with CVB, copious amounts of marijuana). But only a fan would notice the difference, and a fan has everything already. For the uninitiated, on the other hand, Popular Songs of Great Enduring Strength and Beauty will do just fine. It's the band's white rabbit-- ""Curiouser and curiouser!""-- demanding you follow it down the rabbit hole.","The somewhat unsung yet consistently great California band, whose music blended ska, punk, Eastern European folk, psych, rock, raga, and country, gets a proper best-of.

...Earth to the Dandy Warhols...,The Dandy Warhols,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7513d197565213b31d/1:1/w_160/34180df5.jpg,2008-08-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12100-earth-to-the-dandy-warhols/,Beat the World,"More than anything, the Dandy Warhols are perfectly named: The band seems consumed with scenester mannerisms, with leader Courtney Taylor acting as a socialite participant-observer-- just inside enough to know what's going on, but removed enough to snipe from the sidelines. One sequence from the documentary Dig!-- a document of the band's quest for fame via unapologetic poseurism-- illustrates this perfectly: The band breaks into the Brian Jonestown Massacre's disgusting apartment, taking pictures of themselves amongst the detritus. From a perspective of authenticity, the Dandys are really easy to hate for the way they drape themselves in grimy finery like hack method actors preparing for a role. In the past, however, they've displaced this conception in the best way possible, with highly enjoyable singles (""Boys Better"", ""Not if You Were the Last Junkie on Earth"", ""Bohemian Like You""), and one solid LP, 13 Tales from Urban Bohemia. Aside from their highpoints, however, the Dandy Warhols are most known for feeding into their worst and most indulgent musical instincts: meandering psychedelia, implausible conceptual larks, and skit-length ideas stretched to epic proportions. All of which adds up, more or less, to the entirety of ...Earth to the Dandy Warhols..., the band's sixth album, and a how-to guide for outsize imitations of rock'n'roll debauchery and spirituality. It's no surprise that its prevailing themes-- outer space, dubious Eastern mysticism, ""Talk Radio""-- are all known for being infinitely large and depthless. ""The World the People Together (Come On)"" seemed by itself an odd choice for a first single, especially from a band that's had a few winners in the past-- it's mostly wordless, some vibey chanting that suggests the Go! Team after taking their Ritalin-- but it does effectively catalog Earth's (and the band's) schtick of glacially paced and arena-sized but ultimately pointless sentiment. Earth is a whopping 70 minutes long, and at no point in it do we get an idea of what exactly the fuck the Dandy Warhols are trying to tell us. Like one of those New Age retreats that turns out to be a pyramid scheme, you emerge on the other side of the album a bit worn out, confused, and bitter for lost time. (The final track, for example, is a nearly 15-minute minute studio dickaround about a museum for candy bars.) ""Wasp in the Lotus"" is a ""Sexy Sadie"" redux, about the sour intentions just beneath claims of transcendence, and they play it po-faced enough. But then they fall into that exact same trap on ""Mission Control"", with meaningless advice like: ""It's not quite like you think it's/ Not that obvious"". When they stick to what they're good at-- lifting musical ideas from the late-60s-- they still sometimes succeed: ""Love Song"" is a hyper-jangly folk-rock pastiche, but while ""Valerie Yum"" pulls from Tommy James and the Shondells, it does so for seven minutes, the last four of which sees Taylor exposing his real reason for writing the song. Here's a hint: remove the ""erie"" from ""Valerie"", then add the ""Yum"", and repeat it out loud. See what he did there? That said, I can't hate on the Dandy Warhols only for their simplistic parody. If they were really good at commenting on celebrity and hipster culture from an aesthetic remove-- and if they could write good, empathetic songs about their subjects-- they'd be Pulp, and, well, there can be only one Pulp. What I can take issue with, though, is the fact that the Dandy Warhols, perhaps more here than on any previous album, are trying to have it both ways: Commenting on the absurdity of something while unquestioningly embodying it, and in the process adopting irony as an ironic performative schtick. All of this is neatly encapsulated in the abysmally titled ""Welcome to the Third World"", a tale of a ""college town"" refugee burning a fatty on a tropical beach while avoiding the nuisance of shotguns on the dancefloor. It's quite literal, of course, but ""Third World"" makes it only fair to call the Dandys on their bullshit; after all, everybody hates a tourist.","Take it from them, they used to be rock stars for pretend.

You & Me,The Walkmen,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc63abf31b7dc7155ce7/1:1/w_160/44bddf4b.jpg,2008-08-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12084-you-me/,Gigantic,"On both record and onstage, the Walkmen have always reached for the rafters-- often at the risk falling on their collective faces or completely overshadowing their moodier material. In the light of their previous powerful singles and go-for-broke performances, the New York band's latest album, You & Me, might seem like a step down. However, it's the first that fully commits to their seductive, eminently soused-sounding late night sulk. If there are people who still consider the Walkmen a singles act-- granted, that will happen when you write a couple of the best rock singles of the decade-- You & Me might finally convince them otherwise. The album begins with a whimper-- the tentative patter of ""Donde Esta la Playa"" followed by instrumental ""Flamingos (for Colbert)""-- but there's one striking, early difference between this record and all their previous work: You can make out what singer Hamilton Leithauser is saying. It's a good thing, too; among hazy tales of reckless vacations, the album's most vivid tracks are often its most lyrically straightforward: ""Red Moon"" is about missing a girl, ""The Blue Route"" is about missing better days. Those are simple, well-worn topics, but nearly all of these songs are buoyed by some small, cautious detail that-- while it might sound slight on paper-- make for indelible musical moments: The woodsy whistling on ""On the Water"", the horns that make ""Red Moon"" gorgeously mopey, or the warm hum of organ and harp-like piano fills on ""Long Time Ahead of Us"". Elsewhere, the fantastic, clattering percussion on ""Postcards From Tiny Islands"", ""Four Provinces"", and more reaffirm drummer Matt Barrick is the band's MVP. Moreover, these songs refine old ideas scattered throughout the Walkmen's catalog, mostly building them into stronger tracks than their predecessors: ""Red Moon"" takes the ostentatious horns from ""Louisiana"" (from 2006's A Hundred Miles Off) and use them as essential pieces of atmosphere and mood. The loping guitar and offbeat drumming of ""Look Out the Window,"" from their 2002 split EP with Calla, are folded into the late-game clincher ""The Blue Route"". Here, all the band's wanderings coalesce with more focused lyrics and assured songwriting, neither racing nor shuffling towards its ambiguous climax. With all the elements of a Perfect Walkmen Song-- cavernous echo, stinging guitars and straining organ, vocals where you can hear the veins on Leithauser's temples bulge-- it would easily fit on the band's peak, Bows + Arrows. You & Me isn't as hard or immediate as the band's earlier records, but that's not a complaint; its sound is coy, and invites you to spend time with it. Its lyrics are direct and its pleasures are simple-- as easy to notice as the mournful horns on ""Red Moon"", or hearing Leithauser hoping to get home to his loved one on the same song. While the Walkmen likely have more hits in them, if they keep making records as consistently engaging this, they won't sink for a lack of them. This is the sound they've reached for since the very beginning, and they've never played it as gracefully or confidently as they do here.","After a downturn with 2006's A Hundred Miles Off and a grisly full-album cover of Nilsson/Lennon's Pussy Cats, the Walkmen triumphantly return to form. You & Me is more than their most focused record to date-- it's also their most carefully crafted and heartfelt while simultaneously feeling totally effortless. Rarely has the word ""unambitious"" translated into such a positive attribute: They just make it look that easy.

Summer of the Whore,Shannon McArdle,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6213d197565213b2e5/1:1/w_160/c2d6253a.jpg,2008-08-15 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12083-summer-of-the-whore/,Bar/None,"It's easy to conflate Shannon McArdle with the characters in her songs. Summer of the Whore, her first album since the end of both her former band, the Mendoza Line, and her marriage to Line singer Timothy Bracy, is full of first-person songs that document romantic splits with such alarming detail and carefully parsed emotions that it seems they must be autobiographical. And they are, but only up to a certain point. In a recent interview, she asserts she's exaggerating her feelings to make a point and evoke a very specific despair. So Summer of the Whore is fictional autobiography: Those who know McArdle from the Mendoza Line want all the drama and the blame, the recrimination and conflict, and she doesn't fail to deliver. Regardless of how closely they match up with her experiences, these are frank, tough-minded songs that convey McArdle's maturity, humor, and self-destructiveness-- a potent combination-- in the face of such heartache. As the drums and guitars settle into a hypnotic circular pattern, opener ""Poison My Cup"" recounts either one final coupling or some one-off hook-up: ""Don't have to tell me you love me, baby, I'll still go down,"" she sings dryly, as if describing a business transaction, and the back-up singers turn that phrase into an unexpected chorus. The title track is equally candid, drawing out the long ""o"" in ""whore"" languidly, truly owning it. Because she's casting and accepting these assignations herself, McArdle retains her dignity and authority, such that Summer of the Whore is best when it's most poignant, as on ""Paint the Walls"" when she asks, ""Do I sleep on my side or in the middle of the bed?"" and the back-up singers echo her resignation: ""You're really not coming back."" At times these songs play like the narrator of Exile in Guyville disillusioned anew with adult relationships, and you won't be blamed for hoping Liz Phair has a late-career album in her that's so brutally candid and complex. But that implies Summer of the Whore is on par with that album musically, and it's not. In leaving the Mendoza Line, McArdle has also left all traces of the hard-bitten alt-country with which the band made its name. A clean break is understandable, but she has replaced it with a more urban, placeless sound that doesn't have much character. At its most interesting, Summer of the Whore flirts with lo-fi but keeps nearly every song drably midtempo. That's fine on tracks like ""I Was Warned"" and ""CA DRL & 170"", which gain their power from their measured pace, but even the garage-rock of ""Leave Me for Dead"", with its twisty rhythm and stabs of organ, plays hesitantly. Why not cut loose on a song that obviously demands a sense of rambunctious abandon? This ruminative approach seems designed to showcase McArdle's vocals, but she's spent nearly a decade now proving she can hold her own against anybody. When she makes an album that's as bold and witty musically as lyrically, she'll finally escape the shadow of her former band.","On her first album since leaving both the Mendoza Line and husband Timothy Bracy, Shannon McArdle departs from her former band's hard-bitten alt-country sound and offers a semi-autobiographical document of her romantic splits.

Carefree,Devon Williams,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6c13d197565213b304/1:1/w_160/a12b62c2.jpg,2008-08-15 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12092-carefree/,Ba Da Bing,"Devon Williams' timing sort of sucks. As a teenager in the late-1990s/early-00s fronting SoCal punk outfit Osker, he was a good 15 years late for hardcore's salad days and a tad tardy to enjoy the post-Offspring spotlight that lit up the L.A./O.C. scenes. Notable mostly for the youth of its players, Osker was a decent-enough band in the sing-songy, suburban angsty vein-- decent enough, anyway, to get signed by Epitaph. Fast forward 10 years and the hipsters are sample-splicing, tribal-beating, and tapping out ironic 80s tributes on analog synths. Devon Williams? He's just released a solo record of heavily orchestrated pop crooners cobwebbed with Harry Nilsson's wistful romanticism, the Everly Brothers' rhythmic urgency, and the mighty sonic wall of Phil Spector. Dude might want to recalibrate his zeitgeist meter. Even if it isn't trendy, Carefree, whose emotional centerpiece ""Elevator"" turns on a corn-syrupy pun (el-le-va-tor = ""I love her"") and moonstruck vocals, is a long way from beer-drenched basements and might, therefore, come off dilettantish. Not really. Williams has composed pop ditties in his bedroom for years and spent the past one sponging up sweetness and light as guitarist for Lavender Diamond (does it get any less punk than Becky Stark's fairyland fantasia?). Then there's the fact that Williams is no longer a child, and has, to some extent, put away childish things. Carefree's closer, ""A Day in the Night"" mulls the difficulty of navigating the surprisingly rocky chasm between guy with a band and professional adult: ""Once was a musician, but now I just say artist/ 12 years must stand for something."" Not that he totally rejects the direct stage-to-audience channels of punk: ""Stephanie City"" is an enjoyable couple of minutes of pop pogosticking. Album opener, ""Please Be Patient"", however, is more typical of Carefree's mid-tempo fare. With a string section arranged by Lavender Diamond's Steve Gregoropoulos and torn from ""Then He Kissed Me"", cooing girls, and bomping-bomping guys, ""Patient"" could score a pink tulle, white jacketed prom circa 1963. ""Honey""'s rippling 12-string guitar and echo-chambered vocals, is even retro-dreamier, its melody-- like many of Williams' tunes-- recalling those of the new wave era's 60s-pop revivalist, Marshall Crenshaw. But ""A Truce"" trounces both tracks for sheer stylistic conviction. Conflating god-devotion with girl-devotion and boasting an awesome game of drum and tambourine tag, the song recovers the lost white boy R&B-pop tradition of Dion. Unfortunately, Williams doesn't sing as well as Dion or those Everly boys. His tenor is slightly nasal and his delivery can be flat and, well, a little callow sounding, distracting from the lush sophistication of Carefree's music. But you've gotta give the guy credit for his superb pen. Like Nilsson and Crenshaw and other men just slightly out of step with their times, Williams ultimately could build a reputation as a fine songwriter.","One-time member of the SoCal punk outfit Osker and current member of Lavender Diamond releases a solo record of heavily orchestrated pop crooners that brings to mind Harry Nilsson.

B-Boy Records: The Masterworks,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc685e6ef95969322e3c/1:1/w_160/90f60a5b.jpeg,2008-08-15 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12089-b-boy-records-the-masterworks/,Numero Group,"It'd be nice to open this review of B-Boy Records: The Masterworks with a brief but detailed synopsis of this crucial independent hip-hop label's history. Problem is, the label was so short-lived and shrouded in mystery that details are sketchy. Discogs.com has a brief, frustratingly vague two-sentence description of the label: ""Founded in 1987 by Jack Allen and Bill Kamarra. The label was later forced to closed down when Bill Kamarra was sentenced to jail."" (And even there, they got the year wrong-- the label's first 12"" dropped in 1986.) Allmusic.com drops hints that B-Boy Records was ""rumored to be a front for a pornography operation"" in their bio of KRS-One, the MC that paired with DJ Scott La Rock to make the label's defining hit record, Boogie Down Productions' Criminal Minded. And from what I've gathered after a bit of research, getting a definitive answer on what really happened at that label both creatively and financially is probably not too likely: both Allen and Kamarra have set about reviving the B-Boy Records name independently of each other, and there seems to have been a number of bridges burned between the two men. But the main reason the heart of the label's rags-to-riches-to-nonexistence story eludes me is because B-Boy Records: the Masterworks-- for all its exhaustive cataloguing of releases, production credits, label art, catalog numbers, and archival photos-- tells you nothing that you can't already hear in the music itself. This, frankly, should be plenty for most hip-hop fanatics: here you can divine the beginnings of independent, street-level hardcore rap lyricism during the key transitional point that shifted the dominant production style from the 808 drum machine to the SP1200 sampler. Every single recording the label ever released, ranging from BDP's ""The Bridge Is Over"" to B Boys Christmas Album, is represented on this four-disc MP3 box set, and it's populated with a dizzying array of past icons, future legends, coulda-beens, never-weres and more than a few acts you probably haven't heard of that caught lightning in a bottle for one 12"" record. Naturally, the shadow of BDP looms heavily over this collection, and despite the relatively short period of time they recorded with the label-- 1986 to 1987-- 54 of this collection's 262 tracks feature them at top billing. The hook for this set seems at least in part to be ""the label that brought you Criminal Minded,"" which is understandable. But aside from the La Rock tribute Memory of A Man and His Music, most of the BDP stuff, including an all-instrumental ""Hot-Club Version"" of Criminal Minded and all the single versions of tracks that showed up on identical form on the album, is strictly for completists. And since anyone remotely interested in this box probably owns Criminal Minded anyway, a more compelling reason to check it out is the chance to hear music that's long been lost to time. Aside from J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E.'s enduring classic ""Strong Island"" (included both as a single and as part of their 1988 album Doin' Damage), almost everything on here without Boogie Down Productions' name on it is a relative (or not-so-relative) obscurity, with latter-period jams from old schoolers Spyder-D (""Try to Bite Me Now"") and KG the All & DJ Tony Crush from the Cold Crush Brothers (the scarce 1988 LP Troopers) mixed in with little-known names like former graffiti artist turned MC Levi 167 or the dance-crazed Sean Baby and Ninja D. Most of the artists on the label stuck to the same technique that made BDP break big-- minimalist but hard-hitting drum programming fueled by both synthesized and sampled beats, overlaid with fierce battle-rap swagger. (One single, Soul Dimension's 1987 ""Trash-An' Ready,"" even takes a nod from KRS' pioneering usage of ragga/dancehall inflections.) But they do it all to different ends, and the roster here proves that B-Boy Records wasn't afraid to expand its horizons. Of course, there's a fine line between expanding  your horizons and stretching yourself thin, and some excursions worked better than others. B Girls Live & Kicking was a novelty for 1987-- hell, it'd probably still be one if a similar underground rap label released a collection of all-female rap-- but the lineup, which includes Sparky D, Five Star Moet, Baby Doll, and L.A. Star, all rhyme with the kind of motivation that only comes with the urge to knock Roxanne Shanté off her throne. Efforts to cater to various racial demographics are a bit trickier: Crazy 8 Posse's ""La Cucaracha"" is a great piece of Latin rap with a rapidfire, overlapping three-man delivery copped neatly from Run-DMC. But Frozen Explosion-- a white MC whose self-titled LP was recorded in Belleville, Ill., (!!)-- has the tendency to bring lifeless hooks and a cloying delivery, and his pidgin-Japanese single ""Iwo Jima"" has to be one of the most irritating rap singles ever recorded. Still, for every failed attempt like that, The Masterworks unearths something truly and wonderfully fucked up, like, say, Wacky Wrapper, whose sole single (1988's ""Rub-N-Dub"" b/w ""Yo Hoe, Go Home"") makes him sound like a cross between Just-Ice and ODB. Account for a number of tracks that have aged a lot more poorly than ""South Bronx"" or ""Strong Island"" (a number of circa-1988 singles succumb to the brief but traumatizing late-80s fad of using cheap, tinny synthesized horn melodies) and factor in the general mixed-bag nature of any ""complete works"" comp compared to your standard cherry-picked best-of, and you might think twice about dropping $90 for this. But the deeper you dig, the more you'll find stuff where the phrase ""lost classic"" comes to mind: Incredible Two's dis track ""Moe Dee Get Mad""; Soul Dimension's funky old school-meets-James Brown jam ""Soul Power""; Jewel T's alternate-universe-LL banger ""I Like It Loud"". And the obvious benefit of having clean copies of some really scarce and pretty damn good material is compelling. Even after removing the redundant singles and dated mediocrities (not to mention the stuff that already appeared on last year's comp B-Boy Records - The Archives: Rare & Unreleased), it's a pretty huge batch of good hip-hop that would otherwise be difficult to find in digital format-- at 320 kbps, no less-- and prohibitively expensive to track down on the original vinyl. If you buy this, you might not know a hell of a lot more about the circumstances from which this music came, but you'll get a fascinating snapshot of hip-hop history nonetheless.","Featuring 262 mp3s spread across four discs, this set contains the complete works of the B-Boy Records imprint, a significant player in the developement of hip-hop in the 1980s best known for issuing the hugely influential Boogie Down Productions LP Criminal Minded.

"The Horse, the Rat and the Swan",Snowman,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4cabf31b7dc7155caa/1:1/w_160/b23de9e2.jpg,2008-08-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12064-the-horse-the-rat-and-the-swan/,Dot Dash,"The name Snowman may not jump out at the average North American, but in the quartet's hometown of Perth, Australia, a snowman is actually somewhat exotic-- given that the city has only recorded one temperature below freezing in its entire history, it stands to reason that there haven't been a great many of them built there. But while their name may be a little mundane, the music they make is anything but. Over three records, they've established themselves as a band bent on carving their own path, and The Horse, the Rat and the Swan is their most distinctive album yet. It's also an album that deserves to be addressed as a whole, because it really is a complete listening experience without an obvious single. The band's music walks a strange, fine line, alien but not alienating, noisy but never grating. It's practically biblical in the way it strikes you with one hand while pulling you closer with the other. They masterfully layer their songs, countering shuddering guitar noise, amplifier feedback, and shouting with melodic backing vocals, occasional keyboard and violin, and an oceanic vat of reverb. There's a strong surf underpinning to the band's sound, in fact-- you don't get any pick-melting Dick Dale guitar runs, but the guitars nip at the album's edges with intermittent bursts of booming twang. Drummer Ross DiBlasio steadfastly avoids playing straight rock beats, preferring to guide the songs with deliberate patterns that frequently take on a propulsive, tribal quality. So while there's not really a word for what they do, there are enough familiar signposts that it's fairly easy to get into. Guitarist Joe McKee, guitarist/violinist Aditya ""Andy"" Citawarman, and bassist Olga Hermanniusson share the vocal duties. Citawarman handles the contorted, shouted leads, McKee offers deep, oddly calming intonations, and Hermaniusson is something of a melodic balm for Citawarman's most ragged outbursts. Opener ""Our Mother (She Remembers)"" plays well with that tension, as Citawarman gets himself so worked up he can barely pronounce the words he's singing, while the backing vocals come in like ice on a sore. The album is impeccably sequenced, following the hellish surf-punk fit of ""Daniel Was a Timebomb"" with ""A Re-Birth"", a low-key track that seems to interpret its title as the band being recast as machines-- by the end it sounds as though you're listening to the welders and riveters on the assembly line. The album emerges from the dark on closer ""Diamond Wounds"", with McKee crooning Bowie-like about awakening from the wreckage-- the shifting arrangement is maybe the only thing that's ever simultaneously reminds me of the Surfaris and Flying Saucer Attack. If anything on the album is close to a standout, it's probably ""We Are the Plague"", an apocalyptic electro track with processed verse vocals, cool, clear ""ooh ooh""s, and bouncing, buzzy bassline. But that doesn't really seem to be the point, given the palpable, primal journey the band takes on the album. You'll catch little bits of influence here and there-- from King Crimson to the Birthday Party and early Bad Seeds to the Atlantics to Bowie to the Pop Group-- but it all adds up to a unique whole and a great album.","Quartet from Perth, Australia manages a personal and highly distinctive musical fusion, as they incorporate surf guitar twang, spiky post-punk, space rock, and abrasive tribal thrash.

Stardust: Legacy Edition,Willie Nelson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6bea9e61561daa748c/1:1/w_160/5b46738e.jpg,2008-08-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12091-stardust-legacy-edition/,ColumbiaColumbia,"The standards album has suffered a lot of abuse during this decade, as aging singers use it as a shorthand for artistic revitalization and as a shortcut to career revival. Nothing communicates serious intent quite as earnestly or as cheaply as recording a 75-year-old song, as Rod Stewart, George Michael, Cyndi Lauper, and others who used to be much cooler have discovered. As a result, even the word ""standards"" provokes an admittedly healthy skepticism in many listeners, but it wasn't always so. Thirty years ago, Willie Nelson took a typically left turn and followed up a string of successful albums (starting with 1975's career-making Red Headed Stranger) with a covers album of songs made famous by decidedly non-country musicians like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong. It's difficult to understand today how unusual this sort of album was, going against the grain of the contemporary country business. Label execs initially balked, but Stardust become one of the best-selling country albums of all time, spending nearly a decade on the country charts. Stranger is touted as country's first concept album and one of the foundations of outlaw country, which gives it a sheen of originality in a genre nominally interested in tradition more than innovation. But Stardust sounds like the riskier album and is by far the more rewarding collection, which is to take nothing away from Stranger. What makes the record so thrilling and very often beautiful-- and what separates him from today's ham-handed vocalists-- is Nelson's facility as an interpreter. It's not enough for him just to sing ""Georgia on My Mind"" or Kurt Weill's ""September Song"" or even to translate these songs into a country setting. With his tender, textured voice and intuitively around-the-beat phrasing, Nelson gives these songs fresh readings, with just the touch of sentimentality and nostalgia they demand. The cliché ""makes them his own"" certainly applies here: He sings them as they've never been sung before or since, which is quite a feat considering their age and popularity. Hardened from endless touring into a tough, tight roadhouse revue, Nelson's band gives a surprisingly supple performance on each song, which reinforces the album's sweetly ruminative mood. Producer Booker T. Jones, of Stax fame, facilitates every aspect of the band's sound, showcasing the performers' range while ensuring the arrangements play to the lyrics and vocals without overwhelming them. The organ and restrained rhythm section hint at the soul records Jones made a decade before, while Bobbie Nelson's piano, perhaps mimicking her brother's vocal style, adds gospel and jazz flourishes to ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"" and Mickey Raphael's harmonica, one of country's most distinctive instruments, moans lonesome on ""Moonlight in Vermont"". Nelson and his band blur the distinctions between all of the stylistic elements to create a sound that is best described as simply ""American."" As such, Stardust has the force of a statement album, yet it's unlikely anyone ever intended it as such. Its casual demeanor may ultimately be the record's most winning trait. Stardust, however, was not an anomaly in Nelson's career. Previously, he had regularly tackled standards and non-country tracks, and he has continued the practice up to the present. Rather than weigh down this 2xCD Legacy Edition with lesser-quality alternate versions or sessions outtakes, compiler Gregg Geller has collected Nelson's versions of other chestnuts from previous and subsequent albums like Angel Eyes in 1984 and The Promiseland in 1986 (both of which, stunningly, are out of print). The range of material on this second disc, if not the quality or overall cohesiveness, surpasses even that of Stardust, with Nelson returning to Carmichael (""Ole Buttermilk Sky"") but also tackling the Dixieland jazz of ""Basin Street Blues"" and the smoky lounge of ""The Gypsy"". That these songs are all previously released and most of them readily available doesn't diminish their impact here. This reissue, besides being absorbing as music, almost has the feel of an essay on Nelson's interpretive abilities. It's not being billed as such, but this Legacy Edition marks the album's 30th anniversary. While country music has changed dramatically since then, Nelson continues to tour like crazy, record nearly constantly, and generally follow his own muse wherever it takes him. In the past few years he has collaborated with artists as diverse as Ryan Adams and Kenny Chesney (surely Timbaland is in line). He rarely writes new material anymore, but continues to reinterpret his own and others' past hits. Generally the songs he chooses are so durable and his style so personal that they allow and even reward countless variations. As such, even more than the sustained narrative of The Red Headed Stranger, Stardust set both the template for Nelson's career and the standard. Few artists have treat the American Songbook so affectionately and so cavalierly.","It's difficult to fathom today, but Stardust-- a collection of standards-- was a risky left turn for an artist of Willie Nelson's power and magnitude. Now the record is reissued with a set of other Nelson covers from throughout his career.

12 Steps,Tittsworth,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6dea9e61561daa7492/1:1/w_160/cf06266a.jpg,2008-08-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12093-12-steps/,Plant MusicPlant Music,"Baltimore club music broke out of Baltimore clubs a while ago, at least at the DJ and blog-nerd level. Defined by former Pitchfork writer Tom Breihan as ""a cheap, hard, frantic, fiercely regional strain of black house music that exists only within Baltimore,"" the style has been cropping up for a few years now on releases by indie-oriented artists like Diplo, Spank Rock, and Ghislain Poirier, among others. Albums by hometown B-more heroes like Rod Lee have been getting reviews from national mags. And then there's HBO's ""The Wire"", which gave local musicians a national TV platform and eventually spawned a fine major-label compilation, Beyond Hamsterdam: Baltimore Tracks From The Wire. A Washington, D.C.-based DJ/producer with a pronounced Baltimore club influence, Jesse Tittsworth uses the tinny breakbeats and raunchy subject matter of this once-local subgenre within a broader dance, pop, and hip-hop context. Last year, Tittsworth put out a couple of sample-driven EPs, Afterparty and EZ-T, both in the Baltimore club style, and he got together with the like-minded DJ Ayres for a Baltimore/Miami loops-and-grooves battle record called T&A Breaks. But Tittsworth also joined the electro-house hordes churning out ""D.A.N.C.E."" remixes for Justice. A free Tittsworth DJ mix posted online to promote his first proper album, 12 Steps, jumps from Baltimore's Blaqstarr to Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Daft Punk, Soulja Boy Tell Em, Hard-Fi, and George Michael. Clearly, this could've been Baltimore club's pop moment. Unfortunately, 12 Steps is too little, too late-- the free mix is worth more of your money. The sort of electro-rap synthesis this album achieves has been done before, and better, not just by West, but also by his associates like A-Trak, Kid Sister, Flosstradamus, and Cool Kids, or even by Alaska-based Curtis Vodka. Kid Sister, a charismatic young Chicago MC whose ""Pro Nails"" does for manicures what Lil Mama's ""Lip Gloss"" did for L'Oreal, appears on one of 12 Steps' catchiest tracks, ""WTF"". But the ""whassup, whassup"" hook, despite reportedly being sung by post-M.I.A. it-girl Santogold, is as dated as the old Budweiser TV campaign; Pase Rock's rhymes about ""So Fresh, So Clean"" and ""Trapped in the Closet"" fall as flat as day-old beer. On blippy first single ""Broke Ass Nigga"", with an orchestral melody similar to the ""place in France"" playground song, Tittsworth skirts the obvious issues inherent in a half-white, half-Asian guy throwing around the n-word by bringing on guests DJ Assault, Kenny B, Jinxx, and Frankie Baby. The result is mildly funny, particularly the deliciously absurd closing non sequitur: ""Can I hold your fish, man? I need some company."" But 12 Steps is more interesting when it sounds less East Coast, more European. Tittsworth, whose background is also in hip-hop and drum'n'bass, gets the album off to an energetic start on ""Haiku"" by combining those distinctive Baltimore handclaps with robotic filter-disco buzzing and dramatically swooping synths. And on ""4.21"", he turns crackling distortion, hard-edged beats, and light, floaty electronics into what could've been one of Simian Mobile Disco's more contemplative tracks. By comparison, predictable fare like the gimmicky ""Bumpin'"", in which a DJ complains about a drunk guy bumping into his turntables, or the raucous Baltimore-club update ""Drunk as Fuck"", in which a knife sound accompanies rappers the Federation bragging about ""cut[ting] up the pussy like the movie Hostel,"" sounds like (mere) childish imitation. Tittsworth has produced, by and large, an album of potential novelty singles. That's fine-- you can argue that some of the best records are novelty records-- but the problem is that most of the tracks on 12 Steps are neither particularly novel nor memorable. The guitar-coated ""Almond Joy"" begs you to-- wait for it-- ""play with my heart like a toy,"" and the soppy light R&B of ""Here He Comes"" nicks a melody from Hall and Oates' ""Maneater"", which Timbaland referenced with Nelly Furtado two years ago. As many words as the Clipse have for snow, Baltimore club and its cousin Miami bass have for sex, so letting guest rapper Pitbull settle for such Kindergarten Cop-level laziness here as ""spread legs like a gynecologist"" is an insult. Not to his Miami base, not to Baltimore clubbers, but to pop fans. We're fickle-- not stupid.","A Washington, D.C.-based DJ/producer with a pronounced Baltimore club influence, Jesse Tittsworth gets help on his debut LP from Santogold, Spank Rock, DJ Assault, Pitbull, and Kid Sister.

Spirit,Apse,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc54abf31b7dc7155cc6/1:1/w_160/1462c56a.jpg,2008-08-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12071-spirit/,AcuarelaAcuarela,"Apse hit on enough touchstones to rouse familiarity within fans of instrumental post-rock, psychedelia, or even industrial rock, but they never completely settle into one or the other on Spirit. Even calling them post-rock isn't a perfect fit; after all, the album does have vocals, as sparingly used as they may be. Now reissued by ATP Recordings two years after its original release on Acuarela Discos, Spirit is a moody and mostly instrumental affair, but it's strikingly different than any similar act running today; this is something much more haunted and sparse. Many songs are dominated more by the echo of a piano key or the warm hum after a guitar string settles than the notes themselves. Deliberate one-note bass and steady horse-clop drumming leads a floating sing-song vocal on ""From the North"", sounding not just ""cinematic"" and sweeping, but dreamlike. The vocals here are breathy, high, and nearly ghostlike, used as just another texture among many. The eventual crescendo isn't uncommon among Apse's peers, and while they do raise the volume and the distortion here, the buildup might be the more captivating part. Even when thrashing away, they seem to know the value of open space, and they know when enough is enough, cutting their well-earned climax surprisingly short. ""Legions"" is bult on a music-box melody, muffled and faint just below the exchange between the rhythm section and a once-strummed chord. The rhythm suddenly becomes much more discernible and urgent, and a voice kicks in, singing a mantra for more material issues (""We love our lovers, but we want to be loved by another."") From there, they veer back and forth between rollicking and atmospheric, using their quickly mutating composition to stretch out the tension. ""Shade of the Moor"" and especially ""The Crowned"" have lyrics that demand more attention without stealing the focus, and ""Crowned"" is where the tribal rhythms of the album really start to take shape. This continues later with ""Ark"", with pounding, primal drums that eventually recede into ominous radio static. ""Wind Through the Walls"" brings the record into haunted-house territory, courtesy of piano and layered vocals through chamber-of-souls-level echo, and even the quiet, tiptoeing rhythm of ""Blackwood Gates"" sounds vaguely threatening, as does the forebodingly slow closer of the title track. But whether it's a séance or a sacrifice they're conjuring, the tone and feel of the record stays uniform, for better or for worse. What could be a consistent sound and mood for some may be an endless revision of one song for others. Either way, it's the band's grasp of tension and space that makes Spirit a distinctive and not-so-easily-bracketed album. Its big crescendos feel paranoid and desperate, its slower moments vibrate with danger, and its creeps are subtle but visceral.","Now reissued by ATP Recordings-- two years after its original release on Acuarela Discos-- the haunted and sparse Spirit is a moody and mostly instrumental affair, but it's strikingly different than any similar act running today.

Such attention came, at first, in the form of breathless reviews of early festival appearances and accounts of their tireless slogs across the country, but most of the headlines since have focused on the inter-band tribulations: losing their frontman during their first year of existence and then suffering an even bigger setback when drummer/co-founder John Ryan Pike was found dead early last summer after a show in Providence, Rhode Island. But finally, with the release of their full-length debut, Ra Ra Riot are placing the emphasis firmly back on musical matters. Nautically named and themed, The Rhumb Line reminds us why we cared about this band in the first place. Its mournful cellos and haunting violins are dissonantly (if pleasingly) matched with triumphant rhythms and exultant melodies, resulting in a record that is at once grand and intimate. With moments of pop savvy reminiscent of their pals in Vampire Weekend and the emotional subtlety of the Shins, Ra Ra Riot's songs inhabit a space that is both bubbly and bittersweet. To wit, swirling album opener ""Ghost Under Rocks"" blooms from a melancholic cello line into skittering, propulsive post-punk percussion. And their excellent cover of Kate Bush's ""Suspended in Gaffa"" finds the appropriate whimsy in the bounce of the melody, but makes the song safe for those who are uncomfortable with Bush's theatrical trilling. But Ra Ra Riot, as their name implies, are not only capable of autumnal, Arcade Fire hymns. ""St. Peter's Day Festival"" and ""Can You Tell"" represent the breezier, brighter side of the band, taking perky melodies and swelling them with luscious string arrangements. Those strings prove to be the secret to Ra Ra Riot's success; ""Too Too Too Fast"", on which they lean on synths rather than the organic warmth of a cello or violin, is the flattest of the bunch. Much of The Rhumb Line sounds like an elegy-- though Pike co-wrote roughly half of this album's songs before his passing. ""Dying Is Fine"", with its ee cummings-borrowed lyrics (""Death, oh baby/ You know that dying is fine/ But maybe/ I wouldn't like death, if death was good"") is sadly apropos, but it eventually explodes into an anthemic, cheery chorus. ""Winter '05"", set before Pike's death, is more mournful: You can hear the band's loss in the elegant, weeping strings, the descriptions of lonely cemeteries, and Wesley Miles' vocals as he sings, ""If you were here/ Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow."" It's rare for a band to survive the death of a key member, but Ra Ra Riot are actually thriving, turning The Rhumb Line from a potential ""what could've been"" record into a rousing, poignant testament to Pike's life and his former bandmates' resilience.","Who remembers blog rock? Well, the long-time-coming debut from Ra Ra Riot is the sort of album that got people excited about the stuff in the first place.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 10: 1970",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6eea9e61561daa7496/1:1/w_160/e125a330.jpg,2008-08-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12094-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-10-1970/,Numero Group,"Compiling and annotating the complete singles discography of Motown and its host of sister imprints is a massive task. Recordkeeping in Hitsville, U.S.A. was good enough that turning up session notes and catalog details isn't too challenging, but molding all that data into a narrative, digging up all the master tapes and remastering them, and packaging them with hundreds of archival photos takes a huge amount of time and effort. Hip-O Select's Complete Motown Singles series is a godsend to collectors, both as a reference tool and a convenient place to get everything that ever graced one of the Motown label family's 45s. They mean it when they say complete, too-- in addition to both sides of every 45 Berry Gordy ever saw fit to release, the series includes planned releases that never came out, putting a lot of them on CD for the first time. In its 10th volume, the series crosses the decade barrier into 1970, but it's instructive to realize that what we figuratively consider ""the sixties"" is roughly the period from 1965 to 1973, when the United States was embroiled in the Vietnam War and undergoing the paroxysmal changes that made it into a true democracy for the first time in its history. Indeed, the social concerns of the 60s are on bolder display here than on any of the series' previous volumes-- despite Gordy and his quality control department's reluctance to allow the music to drift into political commentary for fear of compromising its commercial appeal. The music changed a lot at Motown in 1970. Edwin Starr stared the specter of Vietnam in the eye on ""War"" and the even more pointed ""Stop the War Now"" and didn't blink; Martha & the Vandellas looked at the conflict through a personal lens on ""I Should Be Proud"" (Martha Reeves' brother fought in Vietnam); the Spinners went looking for chart action with their own version of the Temptations album track ""Message From a Blackman"" (and didn't find it); and Norman Whitfield continued his reinvention of the Motown Sound with the Tempts' explosive and blunt social commentary track ""Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)"", among others. This fire had been building for years; 1970 was merely the year it finally spread through the label's roster. Across the six discs of this set (discs 50-55 in the series), there's also a palpable tension between making the music funkier and making the music smoother-- either way, the sound of young America was growing up along with its listeners. The trend toward smoother, lusher arrangements is perhaps best exemplified by Marvin Gaye's production work for the Originals, whose silky vocal harmony smash ""The Bells"" leads off the set. Even as Motown's studios upgraded to the latest equipment, there remained an essential rawness to the tracks laid down by the Funk Brothers-- one of their drummers was nicknamed Pistol for a reason. Nevertheless, ""The Bells"", and indeed everything the Originals released that year, had a refined sound arranged to the hilt with big, creamy strings, velvet-toned sax, and fulsome bass. Not a moment too soon, either, as Detroit's status as the North's soul capitol, already compromised by Berry Gordy's move to L.A., was being challenged by the Philadelphia Sound, which today is synonymous with smooth, harmony-and-orchestration-laden soul. In fact, the Spinners, who had been with Motown since the mid-60s and had almost nothing to show for it, would go on to become one of the prime players in the rise of Philly soul after their Motown contract expired late that year. Musically, though, they had a hell of a final year in Hitsville. The aforementioned ""Message to a Blackman"" is a haunting indictment of racial prejudice, setting spoken word against a ghostly wordless chant cut with producer Johnny Bristol, but it was Stevie Wonder who finally put the group on the map. Wonder was 20 years old and phenomenally talented-- his biggest hit of the year was the immortal ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours""-- and he liked what he heard in the voice of G.C. Cameron. He wrote ""It's a Shame"" with that voice in mind, and Cameron did him proud, nailing a powerhouse performance that ends with a startling jump into Cameron's falsetto range in one take. The song has an amazing, unstoppable rhythm and is barely orchestrated by Motown standards-- Paul Riser simply added a few answering phrases on the horns. Though it couldn't save the Spinners' career at Motown, it established Wonder, already remarkably successful, as the label's star of the future. Gladys Knight & the Pips skillfully bridged the divide between funk and the more adult soul offerings of the label, working with producer Clay McMurray on the incomparably majestic ballad ""If I Were Your Woman"", directly on the heels of the gritty, bouncing soul explosion of ""You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)"", one of the Motown family's nastiest funk cuts. The label's kid sensations, the Jackson 5, built on the momentum of 1969's ""I Want You Back"" with ""ABC"", ""The Love You Save"", and ""I'll Be There"", moving from bouncing pop to heartfelt ballads with seemingly little effort. Michael's incredible rapid-fire vocal on ""The Love You Save"" confirms that at just 11, he was a natural. The brothers had four #1 singles and released four albums in the span of 10 months from late 1969 to late 1970, a rate of production that's nearly impossible to fathom today. The Jacksons were the most commercially successful Motown act in 1970, but Gordy was to pin his future commercial hopes on a huge gamble: replacing Diana Ross in the Supremes with Jean Terrell and building Ross into a solo artist. Ross sang her last show with the group in January and debuted in April with the inspirational slow song ""Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)"", which peaked at a (for her) disappointing #20 on the pop charts. Gordy was stunned and took emergency action, dispatching sales chief Barney Ales to the studio to record a message to the label's distributors emphasizing how important it was for the next Diana Ross release to find its audience. The message is included in this set, and it's undeniably craven in its emphasis on achieving sales and airplay at all costs, and just a little threatening in its subtext. As he ostensibly thanks the distributors for contributing to past success, Ales pointedly announces that he wants to be able to thank them for the success of Ross' next single at the upcoming sales convention. The message apparently got through: That next single, an overblown, bloated cover of the Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell classic ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" tricked out with Isaac Hayes-style spoken passages, lodged at #1 for three straight weeks. The Supremes, meanwhile, carried on just fine in the absence of their erstwhile frontwoman, scoring with ""Up the Ladder to the Roof"" and ""Stoned Love"", which were perfectly calibrated to the trio's balance of gentle grace and cool sophistication. Fellow Motown vets the Four Tops didn't quite have the massive sales success as the Supremes, but, working now with producer Frank Wilson, they became one of Motown's most progressive acts, cutting the label's first cohesive, conceptually grounded LP, Still Waters Run Deep, from which the dual title tracks were drawn as a single. It's an odd 45, each side putting a different spin on a similar theme and holding off on the chorus for much longer than usual. Marvin Gaye was paying attention as Wilson and the Tops branched out conceptually, noticing the suite-like construction of the LP. It was in 1970 that he took his first pass at ""What's Going On"" (Gordy hated it) and began to conceive the album of the same name, but creatively it was nearly a lost year for him otherwise. Much of his output in 1970, as a performer and a producer, was taken from the vaults. The release of his final duet with Tammi Terrell, ""The Onion Song"", coincided almost precisely with her death from a malignant brain tumor, which rocked Gaye. He was reported to speak to her as though she were still alive for months afterward. As the core of soul music business charged forward strong as ever in spite of all the changes, releasing more than half the songs that topped the R&B charts in 1970, Motown's groping forays into the rock world continued to miss the target, though not as completely as before. The Rare Earth label, established as a haven for rock bands, gained a bit of traction with the band Rare Earth's fuzzed-up cover of the Temptations' ""Get Ready"", but couldn't effectively follow through. Michael Denton's ""Just Another Morning"" is excellent pop-rock, and Canadian import Allan Nicholls offers an organ-drenched slice of proto-prog on ""Coming Apart"", but Motown simply didn't know how to compete with CBS and the other labels that dominated the rock market. Similarly, Hugh Masekela's Chisa imprint released a handful of solid 45s ranging form the South African trumpeter's own jazz-funk cover of ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"" to a good double-sider of imaginative soul jazz from the Jazz Crusaders, and saw little in return. The true value of these sets becomes apparent in their juxtaposition of hits with worthy but forgotten tracks, such as Buzzie's funky, psychedelic disco precursor ""Stone Soul Booster"", available here for the first time since its original release, and it's a huge find. And the story and history behind every hit and miss is illuminated in the accompanying book with great clarity. Motown weathered a changing musical world adeptly in 1970, managing to go in more than one direction at once without getting lost. The emphasis of the label's operations continued to shift from the Motor City to the West Coast, with Gordy looking ahead toward an entry into the film business, but there were still a few good years ahead before the cord tying the label to its hometown was finally cut.","Despite marking a shift in decades, the latest installment in this invaluable Motown series finds the social concerns associated with the 1960s on bolder display here than on any of the series' previous volumes.

Blue Lambency Downward,Kayo Dot,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5deb335119a49ecc4c/1:1/w_160/f1f7295e.jpg,2008-08-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12079-blue-lambency-downward/,Virgin,"Blue Lambency Downward, the third album from Brooklyn-via-Boston symphonic-metal/somnolent-prog outfit Kayo Dot, is the folly of unwieldy ambition: Across its seven tracks and 43 minutes, lone constant member Toby Driver edits both the scripts of Kayo Dot and his former progressive metal outfit Maudlin of the Well. Kayo Dot's first two albums, 2003's Choirs of the Eye and 2006's Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue, could be overbearing and melodramatic, their distended build-ups and full-thrust, exhaustive climaxes sounding sometimes more like Spiritualized Slint soap operas than anything else. But Blue Lambency Downward-- a monolith of interwoven slinking horns and strings, understated guitars, piano, electronics, and hesitant vocals from a guy who used to sing as though possessed-- goes overboard in tedium. An album as high on concept as it is on constricts, Lambency trickles by without much impact at all. First listens to old Kayo Dot records were hours of discovery and backwards wanderlust: ""How did I get to this very loud place?"" But this first listen is a continuum of impressionistic instances in which can you see the big rising action in the distance but never get too close. Drums tumble and struggle through much of the 10-minute opening title track, their rhythmic unrest suggesting a catapult that never comes. Likewise, ""Clelia Walking"" intimates tension through its drums, which roll and empty into melancholic strings before repeating, and ""Right Hand Is the One I Want"" uses fitful figures-- staggered vocal lines, violin motifs that shoot away at sharp angles, drums that still dodge the rhythm-- only to suggest excitement. The back half is at least more dynamic, but an instrumental and two short numbers do little more than maintain the record's tepid temperament. Only closer ""Symmetrical Arizona"" pushes near potency: Over 11 amorphous minutes, Driver does his best singing as the band offers its most provocative arrangements. A slow build through billowing horns and textural percussion suggests a rockist Varèse, especially as the horns stretch over bumps and syncopations in bright blue notes. Chiseled guitars add suspense, and the impressionistic passages suddenly make an imprint. But it's not enough to counter the previous half-hour or suggest more than Grizzly Bear making a (polite) left turn. Lambency's lack of contrast and its vacuum of irresolution are only symptomatic of the record's holistic problem: there's not much memorable to grab onto. Records don't need a sense of catharsis, redemption, or even emotional upheaval to be effective. But-- like a perfectly placed line, a well crafted hook, or a smartly built texture-- certain elements allow bands to lift listeners along into a self-made world. For an album so singular, Lambency offers a disappointing number of those devices. Aside from the playful melodic phrases of Skerik (whose associations range from Critters Buggin and Hella to Trey Anastasio and Stanton Moore) and violinist Mia Matsumiya (the band's only other full-time member), very little sound lingers here. Lyrically, Lambency is a Cedric Bixler-Zavala-sized wreck, full of political quips too vague to register and elliptical discursions that hinge weakly on phrases like ""bifurcated ammonites"" and ""tiffany redoubts."" ""We hope the clouds stop bouncing each other off the mountains/ We hope the wooden lookout has a gutter it can use,"" Driver sings on ""The Awkward Wind Wheel"". As bad as that reads, he manages to make the tangled texts even worse when he sings them. His best Jeff Buckley is graceless and unconvincing, the deliverance of his words seemingly more important than the manner in which they're delivered. Hell, at least he didn't waste his best breath.","Third album from symphonic prog-metal outfit finds the band pared down to just two primary members-- Mia Matsumiya on strings and vocals and ex-Maudlin of the Well member Toby Driver on guitars, strings, reeds, and vocals-- but their sound is just as huge and melodramatic.

Memory Span,The Lines,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc58ea9e61561daa745c/1:1/w_160/17410af3.jpg,2008-08-13 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12074-memory-span/,Acute,"""No weak men in the books at home,"" Gang of Four famously sang of popular history's subliminal, suppressing biases, and the same adage appears to hold true for the steady stream of reissues and compilations that have documented and repackaged the 1978-84 post-punk era for a new generation of indie-rock and dance-music enthusiasts. Maybe it was the sheer volume of DIY-minded acts springing up at the time that relegated London outfit the Lines to the margins of an already marginalized movement. Despite nominally sound credentials-- Miles Copeland's mentorship, a 1980 Peel Session, personnel links to Alternative TV, shared bills with the Cure and Birthday Party-- the Lines have thus far been shut out of comprehensive compilations issued by the likes of Soul Jazz Records and Rough Trade Shops, and earned nary a mention in Simon Reynolds' exhaustive post-punk tome, Rip It Up and Start Again. But there's enough evidence on Memory Span-- an 18-track overview of the band's output between 1978 and 1982-- to suggest the Lines were undeserving victims of attrition.
 
Perhaps their first obstacle to hipster acceptance was that, unlike their contemporaries in Wire and Gang of Four, the Lines had yet to completely sever their trad-rock roots before releasing their first single. The Lines' earliest recordings serve as a reminder that, for all its no-future provocation, punk's amateur aesthetic provided refuge for artists looking to recapture a not-so-distant past-- specifically, a bygone 1967 when bands like the Kinks, the Who and Pink Floyd would let their whimsy run wild before fossilizing into arena rock. While the breathy melody of 1978 debut single ""White Night"" makes frontman Rico Conning's debt to Ray Davies' plain, the lo-fi production, rickety drum beat and askew blues riff mark the Lines as a definite product of their era, and perhaps a more contemporary one, too: in ampheta-mod rave-ups like ""Uneasy Affair"", you can hear precursors to the Arctic Monkeys' scrappy pub-punk.
 
But short of providing Alex Turner with potential cover-song material, Memory Span really justifies its existence once the focus shifts to 1980's Cool Snap! EP, where the Lines began to absorb post-punk's angular, polyrhythmic and dub-wise qualities without corrupting their melodic fortitude-- most effectively on the brilliantly twitchy ""Background"", a psychedelicized companion piece to the Cure's ""10:15 Saturday Night"". And yet even this progression provides scant set-up for the revelation that is ""Nerve Pylon"", on which the Lines shed themselves of their lo-fi limitations and go for the Big Music, with a snowglobe-scenic atmosphere and ascendant chorus that, in an alternate reality, would be getting regular VH1 Classic heavy rotation alongside the Icicle Works' ""Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)"".
 
But if ""Nerve Pylon"" finds the Lines prepping for their close-up, the fact that it never came might explain why they spent the rest of their brief career recoiling from it. As Memory Span delves into the band's final 1981-82 singles, the delicate post-punk/paisley-pop balance that defined the band's prior releases topples over into extended dub (""Part II""), disco-punk (""House of Cracks"") and proto acid-house (""Old House"") workouts that, while providing illuminating displays of the Lines' increasingly tangential trajectory, sound timid next to more adventurous avant-dub experimentalists from the era like Pigbag and 23 Skidoo. (Tellingly, Conning would go onto a career in producing and engineering for clients including Wire and Depeche Mode.) So the fact that Memory Span closes with an abrupt reversion to winsome 1978 ""White Night"" B-side ""Barbican""-- a last-call pint-raiser that points to the corrosive indie pop of the Clean-- feels less like a novel, full-circle conclusion than a necessary reassertion of where the Lines' real strengths lay.","Acute reissues another lost post-punk band, this time a London outfit in the mold of Wire or Gang of Four, who shared personnel with Alternative TV and bills with the Cure and Birthday Party.

Prepare to Qualify EP,Hallelujah the Hills,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc51eb335119a49ecc35/1:1/w_160/d7a2c0e4.jpg,2008-08-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12068-prepare-to-qualify-ep/,Misra,"In an interview before the release of Hallelujah The Hills' debut LP, main singer/songwriter Ryan Walsh was asked what discouraged him about music making. ""Limitations of my voice, my playing, and my equipment,"" was his answer, limitations he said he confronted like ""a school-yard taunt."" On the Prepare To Qualify EP (available for free from the band's website) Walsh and the rest of the Hills write around-- or rather, push through-- those limits admirably: bluster and pomp cover over technical shortcomings, and Walsh's tangled lyrics make up for his shaky voice. But these solutions can't altogether make up for HTH's pallor. All seven tracks' little peaks and valleys flatten into a homogeneous plain after a few cycles through. Unpacking Walsh's lyrics is still the best part of listening to HTH; but the songs themselves, dense and overburdened, could use a little unpacking too. Read further into interviews with Walsh, and he frequently brings up Davids Lynch, Byrne, and Foster Wallace. Walsh identifies with their work and shares, in a small way, their desire to leave ends unraveled, to create scenes without pushing them toward a conclusion. This is Prepare To Qualify's unifying and best aspect. Detail and dialogue cross opening track ""Nurses 5 Float Past"", where a doctor asks, ""Is this an epilogue?"", gesturing to the interstitial qualities of EPs in general, and confusing beginnings and ends. But there are few tricks past this trickery: drums bluster under wordless choruses, smooth strings hover over sampled clips and transistor detritus. Rather than focus on the EP's standard lo-fi fare, you should pocket Walsh's best phrases, alliteration like ""He left with a limp and a cut on his lip"" (""Let It Wave""), or tongue twisters like ""Built by science/ 'The dysphemic alliance'"" (""Cataloging Candy's Demise""). The songs detail, in passing, Armenian waitresses, locksmiths, and doctors, but they also weave from first to third person and back. They are specific and vague at once, as if the narrator can, in overcontextualizing his surroundings, cover for his missing internal considerations. These fragmented stories even make up for the EP's ridiculous puns and long titles, like track two's ""Don't Take the Law Into Your Own Hands But Take Mine in Yours"", or ""When night falls/ Who picks it up?"" from a track of the same name. Though such verbal extravagances are occasionally forced, they're usually entertaining. In such overcrowded songs, though, redeeming moments can fall by the wayside. ""When Night Falls"" has a Steven Wright-like pun, okay, but its chain-gang vocals simply seem unnecessary, and they persist through the whole album. Prepare To Qualify could have been a more spacious record if they had occasionally abandoned the mass vocal line, but as it is, the songs, which are constricting already, feel sweltering and crowded with the additional voices. As Eric Harvey mentioned in his review of Collective Psychosis Begone, one of HTH's earliest tracks was culled from Jonathan Lethem's ""Promiscuous Materials"" project, where the novelist put up lyrics to songs he had abandoned, and left them for musicians to use as they liked. This ""Monster Eyes"" is different from the one Harvey quoted, but it remains unusually minimal for HTH. The repetitive, country-tinged waltz is menacing: ""Best thing I ever did for you/ Was get you out of range,"" Walsh sings, though its threat is softened by how distant he sounds, as though the band recorded the song to acetate. But ""Monster Eyes"", and the live closer ""(You Better Hope You) Die Before Me"" make for a nice finish because they both showcase HTH sans the bells and whistles (and strings).","A seven-song EP offered by the band for free download, Prepare to Qualify continues with the massed vocals and exuberant arrangements of their 2007 debut, but puts an even more intense focus on wordplay, alliteration, and surreal juxtapositions.

But ""that one thing they did 15 years ago was pretty good"" only works for Nas these days, and Double Bubble doesn't do a whole lot to dispel the concept of this comeback as anything but novelty. In all honesty, take the name off the CD spine and there's really not a whole lot to pique interest. At the very least, Stereo MCs realize that ""baggy"" is no longer a feasible fashion sense or sonic M.O. Far from being dated, Double Bubble is plenty contemporary; although for a lot of contemporary indie-crossover dance acts, that means coming to the ""Setting Sun"" crossroads and choosing Be Here Now. Regardless of what track number you're on, you can be assured that the treble will be aggressive, the overdubbing will be indiscriminate, and the bass will be damn near theoretical-- you can hear the lower-pitched instrument, but you certainly can't feel it. No, the true issue is just how darn quaint it all sounds; between acid house and bass, this is right in the middle, a straight 7 on the pH scale. And while the BPM stay at a rate that will certainly keep things poppin' at LA Fitness, it befits a maximalism not attributable to Basement Jaxx (though the mildly curried Bollywood strings and onomatopoeic hook of ""Gringo (Ragged and Ruthless)"" could sneak into Rooty embarrassingly underdressed) so much as a Chinese buffet-- you pile 11 presumably different things on your plate, and yet they all kinda taste the same after stewing in the same sauces. ""Karaoke"" has a half-decent cod reggae thing going, while the wildly jutting synth bursts of ""Get On It"" are a neat hook, but as each song tries in vain to be the lead single, no sort of interstitial narrative develops between tracks. Because it takes about a minute or so to remember, ""oh yeah-- these guys rap."" Not in the traditional sense of, um, MCing, but the sort of interstitial jibber jabber that can kills time until the hook hits again. We're in a situation where Cut Copy will top more than a few year-end lists; certain allowances have been made with lyrics, so you need to really be fucking up with the pen game to make it a sticking point.  The ""breakdown""/""shakedown"" rhymes are harmless, as are the cornball ""does anyone know the way to San Jose"" interjections, but the moment they try to grit their hands, all suspension of disbelief is forfeited. ""There will be no revolution/ You will drown in your own pollution""-- yeah, it goes on like this. And I really wish there was more to report about this-- it's difficult to say whether it's mediocre or a disappointment considering that by now few people would have legitimate expectations. Problem for Stereo MCs is they now have more competition, and Double Bubble is neither deep or dense enough for electronic connoisseurs, nor is it brash enough to spawn another ""Connected"" with kids sprung off of Justice or Hot Chip. Seems a bit trivial to bestow a sort of martyrdom on this piffle, but the disposibility of Double Bubble is definitive proof of how far we've come.","Sixteen years after their breakthrough, Connected, Stereo MCs release a new album that's plenty contemporary but-- unlike comeback records from Portishead and the Verve-- will struggle to find an audience that may no longer be waiting for it.

BCD-2,Basic Channel,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc60eb335119a49ecc54/1:1/w_160/8d91dc02.jpg,2008-08-13 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12081-bcd-2/,Basic Channel,"Once the slipperiest of entities, Berlin's Basic Channel long ago hardened into one of electronic music's most enduring touchstones. In 1993 and 1994, when every few months brought a new 12-inch single from the label-- featuring minimal information, cryptic lettering, and the strangest, most insidiously corkscrewing grooves every to come out of a tangle of boxes and wires-- no one quite knew what to make of them. Who was Cyrus, the label's first artist? Were these Detroiters in disguise? What exactly was Basic Channel, anyway, given that the name was shared between the label and the artist responsible for most of its releases? By 1995, when the compilation BCD-- their CD debut-- collected selections from those singles, little had been cleared up, but the self-destructing cardboard sleeve-- and the sticker on the back commanding, ""buy vinyl!""-- suggested that whoever they were, they were serious about creating not just a different kind of music, but a new kind of musical entity. Much like Detroit's Underground Resistance, Basic Channel were injecting DIY electronic dance music with a degree of mythmaking that would become as central to techno as its 4/4 pulse. A lot can change in a decade and a half. When The Wire's Biba Kopf interviewed the two guys behind Basic Channel in '96, they agreed only to give their first names. Now, of course, Basic Channel are widely known as Mark Ernestus and Moritz Von Oswald, the figureheads of an empire that includes not only Basic Channel but also numerous offshoot projects, including the more ambient-leaning Chain Reaction, the house-oriented Main Street, the rootsier Rhythm & Sound. More than just a collection of labels or a community of artists, Basic Channel is a vertically integrated organization encompassing the vinyl mastering facility Dubplates and Mastering and the legendary record shop and distributor Hard Wax. While their organizational structure inevitably helped fuel much of the myth behind Basic Channel-- and, in the process, created a model that would be followed by organizations like Kompakt-- music was source of their power. Plainly put, Basic Channel invented dub techno, though that two-word tag isn't really adequate to describe the unity of their sound, their entirely holistic vision. Their influence hangs over hundreds or even thousands of artists and labels; without Basic Channel, its difficult to imagine minimal techno, or ""minimal,"" existing as we know it. Most striking of all, though, is the fact that Basic Channel are widely acknowledged not only to have invented, but perfected, the genre; even some of their most talented followers will readily admit to being only imitators. Following 13 years after BCD, BCD-2 is only Basic Channel's second CD release, and again, it revisits previously released work. The tracks included-- taken from catalog numbers BC-01, 02, 05, 07 and 09-- are 14 and 15 years old now, but their reissue couldn't be more timely. Dub techno's currency is at its highest point in a decade. Contemporary artists like DeepChord, Echospace, and MLZ pump out vaporous grooves faithful to Basic Channel's template, while producers like Martyn and 2562 apply Basic Channel's tonalities to dubstep's rhythmic framework. And Pole, a member of dub techno's second generation, has just reissued his album trilogy from the turn of the decade, in which he further mutated Basic Channel's hissing pulse. BCD-2 may surprise listeners who thought they knew the Basic Channel sound, however. Most of their notoriety is due to the music showcased on the original BCD, awash in steely, aquatic color and blown this way and that by colliding waves of delay, sometimes driven by a muted 4/4 kick but just as often propelled by a broad, feathery pulse with no distinct center. (These fizzy, fuzzy, watercolor studies in the sublime remained the focus of the Chain Reaction label, helping to further cement their reputation as listing towards bliss.) But while Ernestus and Von Oswald infused the delicate with surprising, sinewy heft, they could also be straight-up muscular, and it's in this far more techno territory that BCD-2 spends most of its energy. To begin with, the tracks are often faster: ""Enforcement"", from the first single, is roughly 150 bpm (noticebly faster than the 128 bpm pace reigning today), and the rest of the album hovers in the 140s, with the exception of the closing ""Phylyps Trak II/II"". (At around 128, it's not coincidental that the archetypal ""Phylyps Trak II/II"" sounds the closest of anything here to contemporary minimal house and techno.) But it's not just a question of tempo: the tracks here are fiercer and far more raw than anything on BCD. On ""Enforcement"", jagged acid arpeggios cut through the middle frequencies like a band saw. It feels strangely flat, as though an enormous range had been compressed into two dimensions-- the opposite of the expansive spatial tactics for which Basic Channel are best known. ""Phylyps Trak"", while graced with billowing chords and more liquid depths, is overrun with a nagging open hi-hat, insistent and unmodulating, propelled with a singlemindedness that verges on the disturbing. Both tracks are absolutely minimalist in spirit, limiting themselves to a slim handful of elements-- all rigorously tonal, but never melodic-- and letting filters and delay create the illusion of movement. But they're far more banging than virtually anything flying under the banner of ""minimal"" today, reminders of early 90s Berlin where a kind of frenzied frontier spirit ruled, in place of today's more complacent nightclub lifestyle. ""Inversion"", like ""Enforcement"" and ""Phylyps Trak"", is in many ways a study in genre: A 909 drum machine, spiraling acid bass, and glancing, syncopated chords render Detroit techno as a kind of ideal type before turning to dub as a mediating influence, using reverb and delay to smear it all into something hazy and indistinct. It's here that Basic Channel's taste for the amorphous really begins to show itself on BCD-2, along with their ambitions of scale: ""Inversion"", essentially a single groove stretched in a thousand directions, runs to nearly 18 minutes long. (Four of the cuts here are 13 minutes long; ""Phylyps Trak"", the album's shortest selection, is 10. There was no mistaking this for pop music.) ""Octagon"" and ""Octaedre"", both sides of BC-07, continue to nudge the CD into the Basic Channel sweet spot. Everything you need to know about techno is here-- the kick drum, the flayed hi-hats, the stabbing chords-- but they're treated in such a way that they lose their identity; stripped of character, they cede to the art of repetition, the real star of the show. Every track is a repetition of the others, and every repetition grinds on into infinity. Even at 13 or 17 minutes long, they feel like snippets clipped from a continuum-- particularly the closing ""Phylyps Trak II/II"", the dubbiest and most hypnotic of the collection's pieces. It will be interesting to see how BCD-2 appeals to fans of the label who remain otherwise unconvinced about techno; the CD presents a far more complicated relationship between genre and genius than does BCD or, indeed, Basic Channel's reputation itself. (It's tough not to verge upon hagiography when writing about Basic Channel; such is the power of the myth surrounding them.) But whatever the case, BCD-2 is an essential and long-overdue overview of one of the most important projects in all of techno, usefully muddying the waters around a group that made ""muddy"" one of their signature tropes. It all begins here.","Berlin's Basic Channel-- one of electronic music's most enduring touchstones and greatest mythmakers, as well as the founding fathers of minimal techno-- have rather quietly released a second volume collecting some of their 1993-94 12"" singles, none of which appeared on their inital 1995 CD release.

Vol. 1,Wooden Shjips,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc52ea9e61561daa7451/1:1/w_160/37cebcac.jpeg,2008-08-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12069-vol-1/,Holy Mountain,"Somehow, Wooden Shjips still manage to get blood out of experimental rock's oldest and stiffest arteries. The band's best moments are born out of extended repitition, studio experimentation, and reckless amateurism. If you didn't know better, you might think that the San Francisco quartet's murky single-chord jams were unearthed from some long-forgotten record crate-- an acetate sandwiched for ages in between two moldy Tangerine Dream LPs-- rather than conceived within the last couple of years. Vol. 1 collects Wooden Shjips first three vinyl-only releases-- including ""Shrinking Moon For You"" 10"", the ""Dance California/Clouds Over Earthquake"" 7"", and the ""SOL '07"" 7""-- onto a single LP. Together that's six songs and a scant 35 minutes of music, but the compilation contains Wooden Shjips' fullest sounding work. Formed by guitarist Ripley Johnson in the early part of the decade, Wooden Shjips' began by honing in on the mantric drone vibe of bands like Velvet Underground and Pärson Sound. By recruiting non-musicians-or forcing skilled musicians to play unfamiliar instruments, Johnson prevailed in reducing improvised space-rock into a relatively focused product. Wooden Shjips' music still unspools into the ether beyond rational thought, but it does so with relatively predictable results. The songs that make up Wooden Shjips self-released debut single-- the ""Shrinking Moon For You"" 10""-- nail the necessary narcotic feel. Originally pressed in a limited run of only 300 units, the band gave the record away at performances and mailed them out to people who requested copies. After a few positive reviews the 10"" went quickly out of print as collectors and fans scooped them up, creating a buzz around a group that might have otherwise slipped into obscurity. ""Shrinking Moon For You"" is Wooden Shjips finest moment thus far. It's eight and a half minutes of foreboding lo-fi bashing and Schedule 1 substance buzz-- a single two-note bass riff is repeated ad infinitum while a guitars and keyboards ascend up the register and into abstraction. Everything is distorted, convoluted, and delayed. The motorik rhythm sounds like it was made by shaking a drawer full of kitchen utensils. B-side ""Death's Not Your Friend"" treads simillar thrillingly haphazard territory-- guitars ping-pong across the stereo field, anchored by a thrift store organ that sounds like a car alarm. Meanwhile, ""Clouds Over Earthquake"" inverts the formula. Here Wooden Shjips abscond with lysergic chugging for a languid a new age haze. Skeletal guitar melodies float over the refrigerator hum of a distorted keyboard, as Johnson moans distant and blissed out nonsense. In comparison to the best songs on Vol. 1, Wooden Shjips debut full-length-- also on Holy Mountain-- was disappointing. The band stripped down too far, peeling off a layer of murk and toning down the stoner kinetics, leaving only thin and anemic grooves that sounded like Morrison Hotel pitched down two octaves. A few tracks even broke the Velvet Underground's cardinal rule--""never play the blues."" But Vol. 1 finally makes Wooden Shjips first, fuzzier, efforts easily available. And for these songs, one chord is still more than enough.","One of the more rewarding experimental rock bands around, Wooden Shjips here collect their first three vinyl-only releases onto a 35-minute, single-disc LP.

Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails,The Baseball Project,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4fabf31b7dc7155cb5/1:1/w_160/7cfb280b.jpg,2008-08-12 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12067-volume-one-frozen-ropes-and-dying-quails/,Yep Roc,"Baseball is unquestionably the hipster sport de rigueur, its clean mathematical order and heavy reliance on neatly sortable statistics engenders the type of nerdy admirers who probably share psychological profiles with record obsessives. The game boasts more esoteric lore than the combined histories of the Residents and Jandek, and has given us more colorful characters than Elephant 6. It sometimes requires (and rewards) the same amount of faith and patience as a Stars of the Lid record. One other thing-- baseball and indie rock are both places where guys can still get paid for doing ""kid"" stuff into middle age. As with Julio Franco or Jamie Moyer, so it goes for Peter Buck (R.E.M.), Steve Wynn (the Dream Syndicate), and Scott McCaughey (the Young Fresh Fellows, Minus 5), the alt-rock vets and principals behind the Baseball Project, a diamond-themed endeavor responsible for the wonderfully lively and humane Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails. Poring through hardball's rich history with the exhaustiveness of true geeks but the wit and empathy of born songwriters, Wynn and McCaughey repeatedly manage to draw effortless metaphorical lines between baseball and life. For one, the game, like life, is full of men who are bitter, forgotten, and misunderstood. Most of the record's songs focus on one specific player, and Wynn and McCaughey are particularly fascinated by pioneers and scapegoats, guys who either made a sacrifice without commensurate reward (Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood) or who suffered unduly for committing a common transgression (Mark McGwire, Jack McDowell). Of course, the biggest danger with this sort of individualized approach lies in reducing the game's most famous and infamous figures to biographical caricatures, a fair criticism of ""Jackie's Lament"", which unimaginatively posits that Robinson would rather have been remembered as a ballplayer than a hero. ""Gratitude (For Curt Flood)"" could have been a similarly predictable summing-up, but the anger Wynn musters for baseball's first free agent keeps the tribute raw and interesting, evoking the image of ""well-paid slaves"" while reciting a laundry list of today's hugely-compensated stars (A-Rod, Barry Zito, and the like) who owe Flood a spiritual debt. Songs like these and the clemency plea for McGwire, ""Broken Man"", may remind us that baseball isn't insulated from injustice and regret, but Wynn and McCaughey also find within the game symbols for the fleeting joys and happy quirks that make life worth living. Riding bright pop hooks and gleefully bashy garage-rock rhythms, the pair revel in the glorious iconoclasm of legends like Satchel Paige, Fernando Valenzuela and especially the immortal Ted Williams, whom Wynn nails perfectly in a wonderful portrayal of ""The Splendid Splinter""'s lovably cantankerous sense of his own unsurpassed greatness. Charming as unforgettable characters like these (as well as hard-luck perfect-gamer Harvey Haddix) may be, there remains one sobering fact common to all baseball careers-- at some point, they end. On the facts-crammed opener ""Past Time"", wistfully Who-ish ""Long Before My Time"" and martial ""The Closer"", Wynn and McCaughey suggest the ephemerality of all things, be they moments of glory or shame, or entire careers and lives themselves. These two rock lifers clearly found meaning and joie de vivre in music long ago, and it's clear that baseball too has bestowed not only a bond, but also its own share of lessons both cautionary and affirmative.","Alt-rock vets Peter Buck (R.E.M.), Steve Wynn (the Dream Syndicate), and Scott McCaughey (the Young Fresh Fellows, Minus 5), along with Linda Pitmon, created this wonderfully lively and humane endeavor, repeatedly managing to draw effortless metaphorical lines between baseball and life.

Don't Be a Stranger,The Moondoggies,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4eeb335119a49ecc2e/1:1/w_160/ad4b3b29.jpg,2008-08-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12066-dont-be-a-stranger/,Hardly Art,"A quick perusal of the track names on this Seattle quartet's debut should give you a clue to the sound of the music contained within. After all, songs called ""Ain't No Lord"", ""'Ol Blackbird"", or ""Bogachiel Rain Blues"" aren't likely to be black metal (well, maybe just the first one). No, songs with such titles should glow with warm Rhodes organs, twangy harmonies, and whiskey-soaked, thowback guitar melodies, pledging allegiance to the three Bs of vintage Californian Southern rock: beer, bellbottoms, and beards. As such, listeners won't be surprised to note that the Moondoggies, like their Northwestern brethren in Blitzen Trapper and Fleet Foxes, take their cues from Laurel Canyon, circa 1970, imagining neighborly collaborations that may or may not have happened: Crosby, Stills and Nash harmonizing over Graham Parson's country-rock riffs; Crazy Horse's fuzzy, bloody knuckled blues mingling with the Byrds' psychedelic organs; the Band flying in from Big Pink to add some gritty Americana backbone to the Eagles' easy, druggy melodies. On Don't Be a Stranger the Moondoogies are meticulous in their immersion in that era's sound-- a sound that is, by the way, older than even the band's most mature member by more than a decade. Frontman Kevin Murphy has the keening, reedy voice of Neil Young, so it is no wonder that he gravitated toward such cosmic countrified rock. Keyboardist Caleb Quick adds soul and graceful longing to Murphy's ruggedly masculine licks, while the rhythm section of Carl Dahlen (drums) and Robert Terreberry (bass) hold down boozy, plucky grooves. But it's the rich three- and four-part harmonies that really give the Moondoggies' expansive, epic jams their distinctive, vintage sound. (Well, that and the impressively authentic vocal drawls that these Washington-bred men are able to imitate.) The almost eight-minute stop-and-start suite ""Night & Day"" opens with a sweetly rolling acoustic guitar that wouldn't sound out of place on an Iron & Wine weeper, but almost halfway through, it becomes the Moondoggies' ""Southern Man"", a slow-burning surprise (albeit without any political implications) built on an insistent roadhouse piano line, pounding percussion, and a fiery country-blues arrangement. The aforementioned ""Bogachiel Rain Blues"" is the Moondoggies at their most sprawling. Honky tonk pianos lead the melodic charge, with gurgling Freedom Rock riffs in hot pursuit. As Murphy blows a wanton harmonica, the cacophony of voices gives the impression of a drunken campfire sing-along.  And ""Jesus on the Mainline"" feels similarly tossed off, a revival tent improvisation of cabaret piano vamping and crisp handclaps. But the intricately layered harmonies-- squeaky falsetto bleeding into volcanic bass and buttery tenor-- give away just how much foresight goes into tracks that sound this spontaneous. Don’t Be a Stranger is a charming collection by a confident and competent group of musicians, but its drawback is its same-ness. Sure, these 13 tracks are a rollicking good time-- a soundtrack to the open road, a score for all the neon lit biker bars on the interstate, and an expression of the joy at returning home-- but there is little dynamic diversity between them. Almost every song is played at a hazy, stoner pace-- slow enough to allow for impaired motor skills, but fast enough to build a repetitive, jammy groove-- with only delicate acoustic tracks like ""Old Hound"" and ""Undertaker"" for respite from the mid-tempo boogie. But, in the end, that's not so bad. After all, you knew what you were getting into. The tracklisting warned you.","Like their Northwestern brethren in Blitzen Trapper and Fleet Foxes, the Moondoggies take their cues from Laurel Canyon circa 1970, with lots of harmonies, bits of psychedelic organ, a few country-rock touches, and a gritty Americana backbone.

DJ Drama Presents: The Preview,Ludacris,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc67ea9e61561daa7484/1:1/w_160/f91061da.jpg,2008-08-12 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12088-dj-drama-presents-the-preview/,Gangsta Grillz,"Feels a bit silly blaming the deflation in Ludacris stock on account of 2006's Release Therapy being uneven--- it's a Ludacris album. They're all that way. What made it a letdown was that there was a twinge of stewing rage in there, the work of someone who tried to do the right thing and still got fucked over anyway. Despite his gregarious and accessible persona, noted hip-hop scholars such as Oprah Winfrey and Bill O'Reilly made it a point to single Ludacris out as a ""gangsta rapper"" (this is equivalent to Death Cab being blamed for teen suicide), while the ascendancy of trap-hop/crunk/etc. painted him as softbatch in his own city (which he vehemently address on ""Been Puttin On""). I know we have enough trouble dealing with one Common as is, but if Luda would rather just keep his hair short, pen mahogany love jams, and stick with taking roles in questionable action movies (Max Payne-- coming soon!), hell-- I wouldn't blame him. With that comes DJ Drama Presents: The Preview, and on one hand, well-- this simply has to be better than something label-sanctioned. No ""Splash Waterfalls""! No shitty Neptunes beats (okay, he does rap over ""Blue Magic"")! No Tommy Lee skits about green living...probably! It's typical ""this is for the streets/the love"" stuff, meaning that Luda's using his incredible vocal elasticity describing an unstoppable appetite for weed, women, beatdowns, and general act a fool-ness. And of course, punchline after punchline that's just barely before its freshness date (""I'm 'bout to fuck a bitch and get off like R. Kelly!""). And befitting a mixtape, it's stocked with lame skits, unnecessary guest raps from the DTP crew, and it's about 10-15 minutes too long. The main difference is, for the most part, a carefree tone, with Luda raiding my 2000 Winamp playlist-- he handles Prodigy's ""Keep It Thoro"" and Gangsta Boo's ""Where Dem Dollars At"" with typical agility, and really, dude could turn an El-P instrumental into something for your kid sister to bounce with. Yet while his beatjacking is rarely short of competent, there's something lost in the translation-- there's almost no track here that improves on the original. How is that a guy who's made a career out of stealing tracks with his guest verses (""Holidae Inn"", ""Oh"" to name a few) can't actually steal a fully made song and call it his own? When you try hard, then you die hard-- the best Ludacris moments have tended to be the ones with the least amount of guile, and as such, the more scripted moments of humor are straight open-mic night. You'd have to be a total prude to disapprove him turning quite possibly the only good hip-hop track that advocates against smoking weed (OutKast's classic ""Git Up, Git Out"") into a tutorial on puff-puff-pass protocol, but it's done in such a lazy manner that it actually bolsters the original point in a roundabout way. And, hoo boy-- the skits. Cross Tucker Max with N.W.A.'s ""Automobile"" and maybe you've got ""Ordinary Negroes"", and while hearing Jim Jones through an autotune is quite possibly the highlight of the record, the fake ad for ""the robot thingie!"" belongs in the trash bin of an aspiring ""Mad TV"" writer. Bigger problem is that DJ Drama is also trying to reassess the value of his ""stamp of approval"" at the very same time, and in a manner that's completely contrary to what Ludacris is doing-- not since Best of Both Worlds have two rap superstars shared an album less on the same page. Obviously, Drama's greatest contribution is acting like he's trying to shout down Stephen A. Smith-- just say ""DRAM CRUISE-- I DO MISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE!"" or ""GOOD CHOICE!"" or ""IT STARTS WITH YOU LIKE IT STARTS WITH ME"" out loud and see what a dumbass you sound like. Not to mention the extraneous dross that drops in under his stewardship (Playaz Circle, I-20), none more otherworldly than LA the Darkman's ""Coogi Down"" (what year is this?), wherein he and Willie Da Kid boast about eating chicken parmesan at Italian feedbaggery Maggiano's without the slightest bit of self-deprecation. All of this would've made a mixtape digested and forgotten by the time Theater of the Mind comes out on October 21 if it wasn't for ""Politics as Usual"". Just his luck-- Ludacris is just trying to do something nice for Obama and ends up in the recycle bin with Scarlett Johansson's e-mails. Essentially, this is Obama's Sistah Souljah moment, giving him the opportunity to make bold disapprovals of Luda's views of Hillary (""she hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant""), Dubya (""mentally handicapped""), and in the money quote, McCain (""don't belong in ANY chair unless he's paralyzed""). But let the volley fit the serve, as Luda spends as many lines describing his car's paint job as he does Obama's qualifications. It's a non-story on all fronts, but nothing requires constant churn like hip-hop gossip and election muckraking. More telling is that it's three months from election day and the support of Obama from the pop community feels awfully similar to the Rock for Change campaign of 2004-- most of it generated on bold and yet incredibly vague promises of change. At least for Ludacris, we'll see by October whether he plans to deliver on his end of the bargain.","Ludacris' newest mixtape made political headlines for its ostensibly pro-Barack Obama content, but is it actually any good?

A live 2005 collaboration between Sonic Youth (in its quintet formation with the redoubtable Jim O'Rourke) and special guests Merzbow and Mats Gustafsson, here the noise rock fountainhead invites an extreme electronics pioneer and one of free jazz's most ferocious instrumentalists ever over to jam. Things could get crowded. Fear not: Instead of tripping over its own talents, SYR8 is a focused 57-minute communal improvisation, building naturally and collapsing ultra-violently. The concert, performed between sets by Sunn O))) and Black Sabbath at Denmark's Roskilde Festival, is essentially a process piece imbued with its players' personalities. During the first half, they arrive onstage one-by-one. During the second half, they exit in first-on, first-out order. Steve Shelley and Kim Gordon take it from the top, Gordon moaning about saving souls over her own ugly electric guitar arrhythmia and Shelley's tom-and-cymbal ellipses. The crowd cheers when Thurston Moore rushes in, his brittle guitar tone initially charging but eventually locking with Gordon's. After guitarist Lee Ranaldo joins, the band spends 10 minutes cresting and falling in classic Sonic Youth style, the drums either skittering or charging, the guitars either prickling or feeding back. O'Rourke, who left Sonic Youth three months later, splits his time here between guitar and keyboards. Gustafsson's entrance, though, feels like the main event: As the band slinks and reorganizes after a surge, he slices through, his first note matching the mood of the guitars before peeling away into sharp, painful squalls. As Gordon sings her final words, the whole thing lifts steadily like a curtain, revealing Merzbow and his dual Apple laptops. His imprint-- a blitz of static at a belligerent volume-- is deep and unmistakable. Over the next 30 minutes, the players exit, eventually leaving O'Rourke, Gustafsson, and Merzbow onstage, shaping their individual cacophonies into interlocking rivets. Gustafsson's reeds fit between Merzbow's whirs, and O'Rourke's pedal patterns steam through them both. He exits through a single shot of feedback, leaving the two guests to battle side-by-side on the gear-littered stage. No one wins. Gustafsson just leaves. Merzbow sounds forceful and fresh in this context, qualities sometimes absent in his 29-year career. On SYR8, some of the best in the business sound even better. In June, almost three years after this performance, Starbucks released a seemingly well-intended disc called Hits Are for Squares, a collection of 15 Sonic Youth tracks picked by bands like The Flaming Lips and Radiohead and, uhh, people like Chloe Sevigny and Diablo Cody. Long-running criticisms of the band-- which released its first record on a major label in 1990, once practiced near the World Trade Center, and made nearly $500,000 for playing three shows in 2007-- as money-hungry hit new heights. While Hits Are for Squares isn't a pinnacle of the band or its decision-making process, those branding the band as sell-outs only consider the most convenient side of the story: The members of Sonic Youth are perhaps more invested in financing outsider art than any other major American act (see Ecstatic Peace, Moore's noise albums on tiny labels, Gordon's art and advocacy). What's more, Sonic Youth is the only American band to be active and evolving a quarter century after its inception, without interruption-- Melvins and Yo La Tengo possibly excepted. They've released alternative rock gems and covers of Steve Reich pieces, a 7"" about Mariah Carey, and an homage to Ted Hughes. If Hits are for Squares is an attempt to cash in, Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth-- literally, Other Sides of Sonic Youth-- is an ace reminder that this band hasn't lost its abrasive edges or its risky ideas. After all, I've always wished my favorite bands got paid more like our best athletes. If Starbucks can enable that even a little bit for a band that still puts out peerless slabs of improvisation like SYR8, blessed be both benefactors.","A live 2005 collaboration between Sonic Youth (in its quintet formation with the redoubtable Jim O'Rourke) and special guests Merzbow and Mats Gustafsson, Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth is the eighth album in Sonic Youth's self-released, experimental series known as Sonic Youth Recordings, or SYR.

Songs on the Rocks,Nôze,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4deb335119a49ecc2c/1:1/w_160/d6ed905f.jpeg,2008-08-12 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12065-songs-on-the-rocks/,Virgin,"Sometimes it seems as if French duo Nôze are taking their label's imperative moniker, Get Physical, a little too seriously. Nicolas Sfintescu (aka DJ Freak, founder of the Circus Company label) and Ezéchiel Pailhès have always been hands-on-- their debut, Craft Sounds and Voices,was clattery music for the dust-up between the club and the bed-- but moments of Songs on the Rocks take things too far. Pailhes seems to play piano with his forehead; Sfintescu may be holding the backup singers at gunpoint. Songs on the Rocks retains its predecessor's funk affectations but applies them instead to cabaret pop, burying their rhythmic loops in the background. The results sound like the regurgitated Beefheart-isms of Man Man, but more condensed and cloistered. ""L'Inconnu Du Placard"" opens Songs with a nervy conga drum and childlike xylophone, followed by a smoothly harmonized chorus. Then, ugliness: A guttural voice shouts absurdities alternately moving and laughable-- ""C'mon baby!/ There is other ways/ To be happy,"" but later, ""When I wake up in the morning/ I drink some wiiiiiiine."" Guitars cluck and whinny while a rumbling bass loop undercuts the elliptical drum pattern. On eight-minute-plus centerpiece ""Childhood Blues"", a low-slung choir fights for room with minor-key piano chords and the album's most blip-worthy beat, as Sfintescu and a free-form electric guitarist fight over who sounds more risible. ""I was not an unhappy kid!"" he screams, and suddenly Funkadelic sound coherent by comparison. If that all sounds a little loosey-goosey, it is: Nôze are best when they fit their oddities into skin-tight arrangements. The woodblock percussion and irritable horns of ""Ethiopo"" hew closest to the debut's wordless minutiae. ""Slum Girl"" marries the duo's most ambitious arrangement to date-- pulsing horns, martial tom hits, cinematic strings-- to a literalist, Waits-ian growl: ""She was a little girl/ And she lived in the slum/ Didn't know her father/ Neither knew her mother."" ""Remember Love"" gets it all right, taking the debut's hooky chanting and placing it over Pailhes' roiling piano and a wormy, club-ready beat. ""I seize the daaaaaylight...Everybody's happy to be living love,"" goes the chorus, and suddenly the bizarre, empathetic storytelling of ""Childhood Blues"" and ""Slum Girl"" make a lot more sense. ""Remember Love"", though, feels like an anomaly on Songs, which is ultimately a mess. ""Kitchen"", the bass-pop single that should've provided a blueprint for the whole record, is reworked as a dour Radiohead ballad. It ends a loose pot of ideas that barely hold together as an album-- gypsy blues, free-jazz skronk, minimal beatmaking, or just two Parisians in a room taking Macca's ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" a little too seriously, for 47 minutes.","The latest from this French duo retains its predecessor's funk affectations but applies them instead to cabaret pop, burying their rhythmic loops in the background

That overlap is surprising only because This Is Ivy League's studiously tweedy sound seems so completely at odds with their day job's hipster-glam hooks and right-place-right-time low-level popularity. Alex Suarez and Ryland Blackinton have obviously spent a lot of late night cramming for their Collegiate Folk Pop of the 1960s final, and they've developed a strong sense of the era and its telltale sounds: gossamer melodies, gentle harmonies, wistful guitars, lovelorn lyrics. Their self-titled debut delivers it all with a polite tap on the shoulder rather than a knowing wink. No way is ""London Bridges"" ironic appropriation, not with that bouncy bass line and nursery-rhyme hook. There are, of course, significant dangers that come with such a backwards-looking project, namely its tendency for re-creation rather than interpretation. This Is Ivy League don't entirely skirt these pitfalls: ""Viola"", ""Modern World"", and ""Visions of Tokyo"" come across as pastiche, imitative rather than innovative. At moments like these, their musical affections sound closer to hipster affectations, but more often, the duo filter a modern sensibility through their studyfolk, singing about indie backlash (""The Richest Kids""), the rigors of touring (""Love Is Impossible""), and wrecked relationships (""Don't Waste Your Love on Me""), all firmly planted in a particular scene. They're neither as shut-in as Kings of Convenience nor as mordantly funny as Belle & Sebastian, but there is something refreshing about how they take this music away from the library carrels and show it around Brooklyn. Noses out of books, Blackinton and Suarez make folk-pop a soundtrack for shindigs and get-togethers, all populated with frenemies and hook-ups. They write a surprisingly poignant paean to their circle of friends on ""Celebration"" (""When we get together, feels like all my worries disappear""), although it's followed by ""A Summer Chill"", their takedown of a ""well regarded party girl"" that sounds too bitter despite its sugary hook. At times listening to the album can be like scrolling through a stranger's Flickr account-- who the hell are these people?-- but typically, Ivy League add enough musical flourishes to keep you clicking through, usually in the form of a succinct chorus or, in the case of closer ""Don't Waste Your Love on Me"", a guitar riff that sounds like skipping a stone across some autumnal pond. When they throw a party, they invite everyone. They don't teach that in school.","Dudes from Cobra Starship moonlight as 60s-fueled twee-pop and try to avoid sounding like mere pastiche.

Clouded Staircase,Starling Electric,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3aeb335119a49ecbfb/1:1/w_160/5cc02c32.jpg,2008-08-11 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12048-clouded-staircase/,self-releasedself-released,"It's hard enough keeping up with the deluge of new bands and releases each week. But nestled in with the new releases in the prominent register-side display case at my local record store are such ""new"" releases as Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, Beck's Odelay, Lynyrd Skynyrd's Street Survivors, and Dennis Wilson's Pacific Ocean Blue. When nothing old stays that way and old becomes new again, how in the world can anyone be expected to keep up with what's never been released before, overshadowed as it is by the constant stream of albums getting released again? Starling Electric's Clouded Staircase was first released just a couple of years ago, in 2006, so even factoring in the Ann Arbor band's relative obscurity, a 2008 relaunch seems a little, well, premature. Adding redundancy to redundancy, Clouded Staircase is power-pop through and through, which makes it an intrinsic mish-mash of much that has come before it. Beach Boys. Byrds. Beatles. Big Star. Even a few bands that don't begin with ""B."" The group's website boasts that ""we specialize in everything truly great about pop music from 1965 to 1977."" That's smug enough to instantly turn plenty of people off, but power-pop deserves a certain degree of leeway. It's a genre that exists within its own carefully circumscribed bounds. Too much deviation means it's no longer what it set out to be. Clouded Staircase turns out to be is an impressive enough achievement, at least taken on its own terms. Recorded at home, mostly by bandleader Caleb Dillon but fleshed out with a little help from his friends, it hits all the right notes-- the harmonies, the chiming guitars, the baroque arrangements, the slightly psychedelic twists and turns. The question is whether the disc adds up to more than just the sum of its Frankenstein monster parts, but it's hard to muster up much excitement for an album where ""been there, done that"" is the stated and all-too-achievable goal. Starling Electric has audaciously declared the disc ""a call to arms for anyone still interested in melodies, harmonies, and the power of good pop song,"" which is a little strident, even as far as calls to arm go. Sure, ""The St. Valentines Day Massacre"", ""Camp-Fire"", ""New Era"", ""All Through the Fall"", and ""To Flunker, With Love"" are solid, as is the multi-part suite that is the title track, its pieces united by gently played piano. But an album that is almost by definition little more than stitched-together homage and affectations can only get you so far. In fact, from start to finish, all 18 songs are of such a piece with one another, so carefully do they adhere to the rigid rules of retro, that Clouded Staircase itself comes across as one long suite (albeit thankfully at an LP-friendly 51 minutes length). On one hand, that's a testament to the disc's cohesion. On the other, the approach is somewhat limiting, and occasionally even stifling. Dillon is a talented young guy (he supposedly started work on the album while still in high school), and the kudos he's already earned from peers such as the Posies and Robert Pollard are commendable. But as much as Dillon may aspire to the glory days of 1965 to 1977, that creative path is self-defeating. Those golden years of power-pop are long gone, and until he finds a way to put his own stamp on what's come before, he's unlikely to escape the fate that's befallen so many of the other ambitious but anonymous copycat acts that have likewise come after, stars in their eyes but other people's ideas in their minds.","Ann Arbor's power-pop purveryors Starling Electric, championed by Robert Pollard and the Posies and obsessed with the sounds of 1965 to 1977, re-release their 2006 album.

Basta EP,Rainbow Arabia,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4a13d197565213b2b2/1:1/w_160/cd4cb47a.jpg,2008-08-11 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12062-basta-ep/,Tiny Man,"The opening seconds of Rainbow Arabia's debut EP are more knuckleball than curve: ""Omar K"" begins with chanted call-and-response vocals, and what at first seems like it might be a well-timed study of traditional West African music quickly veers a good distance eastward, and makes clear which global destination the duo have actually mined for so much inspiration. With a name like theirs, of course, you should have little trouble figuring out where to look to get some sense of what informs not just their keffiyeh-fied aesthetic but their Cairo-via-Echo Park primitivist dance hybrid as well. Big hint. Rainbow Arabia are married couple Danny and Tiffany Preston, formerly of L.A. dub-punkers Future Pigeon. As with their earlier band, Rainbow Arabia are out for your hips, and this first effort is strangely propulsive. While press materials state that the two combine Middle Eastern flavors with American experimental dance music, I'm not sure there's anything especially ""American"" about their project aside from its mailing address. On the other hand, because their music is so attached to the region and its rumble, I can't help but wonder what kind of reaction the Basta EP might elicit from ears that grew up with those sounds. Fairly or not, questions of authenticity are destined to haunt this band. Musically, Rainbow Arabia work a pretty minimal setup. While the overall vibe stays in place, their means of execution requires many parts. The synth and drum machine workouts are certainly house-meets-tribal, but the menacing beats realized in ""Let Them Dance"" and ""Hear No See No"" aren't what lend those particular cuts their bones. What really sticks out are the serpentine guitar lines that slither their way through the EP, sometimes taking on the shape of post-punk spikes, garage crunch, and Edge-like delay effects. That sort of guitar eclecticism is mirrored in turn by Tiffany Preston, whose yips, yaps, and prairie crows work well in the Rainbow Arabia's efforts to transport as much as immerse. An easy reference point would be Ponytail's whirling frontwoman Molly Siegel. While her vocal turns aren't nearly so easy to place stylistically, the two both hit high registers some might call distracting more than complimentary. The fifth and final track on this 20-minute EP, ""The Basta"", opens by sampling video game effects that, according to the eternal geek in me, can be traced to 80s SEGA quarter-vacuum Altered Beast. That's one way to kick off an off-kilter dance track punctuated most memorably by Tiffany Preston's last few yelps, I guess; but it also points to a possible way forward. You could easily argue that, given their commitment to their influences, Rainbow Arabia don't have many options when it comes to their next move. Could be, but this closer shows that that they've still managed to find a few interesting keepsakes in this bazaar they've gotten lost in.","Former members of L.A. dub-punkers Future Pigeon pay tribute to the music of the Middle East with a brief EP filled with danceable rhythms and region-appropriate ululations.

Live 1977-1978,Suicide,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5fc0084474cd0c2a92/1:1/w_160/9219928e.jpg,2008-08-11 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12080-live-1977-1978/,Blast First Petite,"Performing one of his anything-goes solo tours in 2005, Bruce Springsteen frequently surprised sold-out crowds by closing his sets with a cover of Suicide's ""Dream Baby Dream"". An unlikely encore perhaps, but Springsteen frequently cites Suicide as the inspiration for the bad-trip barks and howls punctuating his haunting ""State Trooper"". In fact, Springsteen's just one of many likely and unlikely acts influenced by the confrontational New York duo of Alan Vega and Martin Rev. A good hunk of Jason Pierce's back catalog, both with Spacemen 3 and Spiritualized, owes a debt to Suicide songs such as ""Cheree"". Ric Ocasek was an early fan even though the Cars went off in a different direction. Nick Cave proudly swims in the band's stream. Just about every synth/singer duo or electroclash act-- from Soft Cell to the Kills-- owes something to Suicide. Still other future acts simply left Suicide gigs with lasting lessons on how to piss off a crowd in less than 20 minutes. No question, for whatever confluence of reasons, Suicide proved their own sort of punk rock: either you left a show rocked, or you likely felt punk'd. The enduring Live 1977-1978, a box set comprising 13 complete Suicide sets either recorded in New York or in Europe (where the band was opening for the Clash and Elvis Costello), give new listeners the chance to hear the good, bad, and ugly sides of the band, even if all those sides were ultimately presented as one hugely confrontational façade. A little like the VU with a few extra doses of ""we don't give a fuck,"" Suicide specialized in hypnotic/annoying electronic dirges propelled by primitive beats and driven by Vega's crazed vocals. It's a stunt disclaimer, but a warning stamped on the back of this box reads: ""These recordings are not for the fainthearted or casual fan."" There's only one Suicide show that transcends those parameters, on historic grounds, and that's the infamous tape of the band performing in Brussels, a show that ends after 23 minutes with a fan commandeering the mic. That set is here, as well as possibly too many more: Live 1977-1978 is really about overkill, a series of lo-fi tape recordings every bit as confrontational as these 13 performances, each captured as long, unbroken tracks. Unlike the VU, whose treasure trove of bootlegs recorded by Robert Quine comprised the essential, illuminating Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes, Live 1977-1978 virtually rubs your face in its inessentialness, offering essentially the same thing, 13 times in a row. Which begs the question: Were there ever any Suicide gigs that ended well? Were there any performances that didn't bring you to the brink and threaten to push you over, just for kicks? Were there every any Suicide shows that were actually a good time? ""Our attitude was, 'Fuck you buddy, you're getting the street right back in your face,"" Vega has said. ""And some."" Well, ""Live 1977-1978"" is some and some more. It's grunge. It's grime. It's the sight of several days of dirt built up under your nails as you try to scratch your own eyes out. Unless you're a die-hard Suicide fan-- and, to be fair, that's who this set is made for-- you may never want to put it on more than once, but that first time through is still a blast.","Six discs-- and 13 whole sets-- provide an exhaustive, limited-edition look at the New York electronic band's early live performances.

'Til the Band Comes In,Scott Walker,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6a13d197565213b2fd/1:1/w_160/7e187adc.jpg,2008-08-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12090-til-the-band-comes-in/,PhilipsPhilips,"By now the story of Scott Walker's career is fairly well known: Former pin-up idol dissolves his mid-1960s pop group the Walker Brothers then releases four records of challenging and existential baroque pop, placing increased emphasis on his own compositions. When the fourth and best of these records, 1969's Scott 4-- the first to feature only Walker originals-- tanks, he hides in a world of covers, country & western detours, and MOR schmaltz before re-emerging as a songwriter in 1978 and spending the next three decades releasing infrequent, increasingly difficult material. It's a great story-- one of more unexpected and fascinating in modern music-- but in order to heighten the sense of tragedy behind Walker's semi-retirement as a songwriter, it neglects to include the lost, long-out-of-print 'Til the Band Comes In. Released in 1970, a year after Scott 4, 'Til the Band featured 10 new Walker compositions (as many as there were on either Scott 3 or 4), plus five interpretations of other people's songs, all of which were sequenced at the end of the record. Sure the album-- disowned by its creator and famously dissed on Pulp's Walker-produced ""Bad Cover Version""-- is a concession of sorts, a retreat from the increasingly personal and singular work Walker was producing at the time, but it never deserved to be relegated to a mere footnote. The Walker originals are a step down from those on his previous two albums but they are worthwhile nonetheless. Credited to Walker and his manager Ady Semel, most of the original songs were designed to be part of a concept record about the residents of a particular apartment complex. Six of the tracks that made it to the record fit this design, telling stories of mostly broken, beaten-down people, from lonely pensioner ""Joe"" to former dancer-turned-stripper ""Jean the Machine"" to a man pathetically pining for the ""Time Operator"". (Exactly what Semel's contributions to process was remains a mystery; the only hint came from the 1996 CD release of the record, whose liner notes credit him with editing the songs to remove content that would ""offend old ladies."" With Walker at this time on the cusp of abandoning his more adventurous material and focusing purely on entertaining mothers and grandmothers, this sadly may not have been a joke.) Walker's originals here-- eight of which were featured on box set Five Easy Pieces, suggesting that Walker isn't disowning the entire period-- don't demonstrate the sort of growth that can be found in his 60s work, but they are frequently stunning. With the aid of longtime arrangement partner Wally Stott, Walker's songs are exquisite and delicate, tales of people with the best days of their life firmly behind them, a fate that Walker, still only 27 at the time, may have felt himself. Of these tracks, at least three rank among his best work, particularly ""Thanks for Chicago Mr. James"", a Dear John letter to a homosexual sugar daddy (a fact only mentioned in passing rather than dwelled upon). The title track, another melancholy break-up song, and the rousing ""Little Things"", which lists atrocities-- from starving children and suicidal neighbors to car and airplane crashes-- that provide a break from the horrors of the Vietnam War, are nearly as good. The jazz-inflected ""Joe"" and ""Time Operator"", all-too-brief ""Cowbells Shakin'"", gently funny ""Jean the Machine"", and tranquil ""The War Is Over (Epilogue)"" conspire to make this a worthy addition to the Walker catalogue. But what of those oft-dismissed covers, songs that Jarvis Cocker compared to cutural missteps like the Rolling Stones' 80s work and the ""Tom & Jerry"" episodes when the typically silent cartoon cat and mouse find their voice? Well, outside of a rather awful take on Kenny Rogers & the First Edition's ""Reuben James"" and a ho-hum Henry Mancini song ""The Hills of Yesterday"", they aren't bad. The other three-- all arranged by another frequent Walker collaborator, Peter Knight-- include covers of Classics IV's U.S. hit ""Stormy"", Michael Legrand's now-standard ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life, and a frankly pretty great take on Jimmie Rodgers' ""It's Over"". Maybe these songs were included to entice Walker's ""old ladies"" constituency to pick up the record-- as late as 1969, Walker was performing standards on his own BBC TV show, and that year released a record of those performances-- but at least three are worth hearing regardless. In the end, those songs are inherently compromises and disappointing signposts of what was to come, but they're not cringeworthy, as they've been made out to be. (That tag, unfortunately, is true of much of the rest of Walker's 70s output.) It would be a stretch to call 'Til the Band Comes In a lost classic, but it was honestly lost-- even difficult to find via file-sharing-- and its reissue is a welcome addition to Walker's fascinating discography. (The record now is being released next week, having been delayed, but can still be pre-ordered at Amazon and doubtless other places.) It's tempting to lament the missed material that Walker could have produced throughout his lost decade, and there are very few clues here of how he got from elegant pop to the clattery, mechanistic post-punk he created eight years later. Considering how surprisingly rich the long, drawn-out fourth act of Walker's career has been, however, he may not have so forcefully set out to prove himself or comfortably engrossed himself into the avant-garde had the process been either gradual or dotted with commercial and creative success. Walker's personal sacrifices turned out to be our reward, and now he's paying us once again by allowing the final incredible link of his career see the light of the day.","The lost, long-out-of-print 'Til the Band Comes In is finally reissued, filling in an important link in one of the more unexpected and fascinating careers in modern pop.

The Second Gleam EP,The Avett Brothers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc41eb335119a49ecc0d/1:1/w_160/53f9f4fd.jpg,2008-08-08 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12054-the-second-gleam-ep/,Ramseur,"I want the Avett Brothers to go unplugged about as much as I want Sonic Youth to do the same: not at all. The North Carolina band's appeal lies in their spirited deployment of just about every trick they know to get their songs across. Their self-produced albums range from electrified neo-string band to brooding alt-country to emphatic Beatlesque pop to hollerin' punk, all coalescing into something resolutely idiosyncratic. The downside to this approach is that the Avetts' albums can be messy affairs, although usually spectacularly so. For something as perfect as ""The New Love Song"" (from their third album, Mignonette) to work, it needs a counterpart like the overreaching ""The Ballad of Love and Hate"" (from Emotionalism), whose bluntness throws everything else into sharp relief. It's not so much that the bad makes the good sound better, but that listening to either of those albums is like watching someone walk a tightrope: They could lose their balance with any note and plummet to the ground, yet for all the wobbles, they rarely ever do. Forsaking this anything-goes and anything-can-happen aesthetic, their 2006 acoustic EP The Gleam refined their scattershot approach by covering only one corner of the Avetts' sound, dispensing six pensively downtempo songs performed with the same arsenal of instruments-- guitars, banjo, violin, and harmonica-- but without the musically omnivorous bravado of their full-lengths. It shouldn't've worked at all, and in some cases it didn't: ""Yardsale"" managed to be both maudlin and overconceptual, and ""Find My Love"" featured some pretty ridiculous falsetto. But ""When I Drink"" worried over mortality like a hangnail and ""Backwards With Time"" made earnestness sound like righteous dissent. It's odd to have a sequel, even odder that The Second Gleam improves so thoroughly on the original, marking the band's considerable musical growth over just a few short years. These six songs align along their two favorite themes-- death and memory-- and thread together stray thoughts, good and painful memories, whimsical what-ifs into what sound like internal monologues. The new EP is eloquent but not showy, reflective but not self-absorbed, tender but not saccharine. ""Tear down the house that I grew up in/ I'll never be the same again,"" they sing on opener ""Tear Down the House"", a quietly plaintive coming-of-age song about destroying the artifacts of your past. After that, ""Murder in the City"" sounds like a logical conclusion as the Avetts imagine a world without them (""If I get murdered in the city/ Don't go revengin' in my name""), a bit like George Bailey with a mandolin. Throughout the EP, the Avetts' playing is subdued and occasionally too tasteful, showy only insofar as a few quiet fret taps count as grandstanding. The stripped-down music sells their ruminative approach to the subject matter on centerpiece ""Bella Donna"" and closer ""Souls Like the Wheels"", and their sincerity lets them get away with a line like ""Always remember, there was nothing worth sharing like the love that let us share our name."" That line, from ""Murder in the City"", does exactly what it's supposed to do: It reminds me to call my mom. The Gleam EPs are interesting asides to the Avetts' discography, but because they only show one facet of this multifaceted group, they sound experimental, incomplete, secondary, even despite the new EP's sturdiness. For this reason alone it seems strange that The Second Gleam will be their final release for Ramseur Records, the North Carolina indie that shepherded them to larger venues and greater sales. The Avetts have signed with American Recordings and are currently working with Rick Rubin. Let's hope he doesn't pull a Neil Diamond on them and polish away their rough edges, which have taken them a long way so far.","This sequel to the Avett Brothers' 2006 acoustic EP aligns along their two favorite themes, death and memory, and improves greatly on the original, marking the band's considerable musical growth over just a few short years.

Miami Ice,Icy Demons,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc435e6ef95969322de1/1:1/w_160/eb5c605f.jpg,2008-08-08 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12056-miami-ice/,Obey Your BrainObey Your Brain,"For most of their discography, Icy Demons have drifted in an experimental krautrock haze, keeping the stylistic boundaries malleable to maximize the fruits of their geographic cross-pollination. Headed by Bablicon's Griffin Rodriguez (aka Blue Hawaii) and Man Man/Need New Body's Christopher Powell (aka Pow Pow), the Demons' remaining revolving-door lineup consists of musicians from Athens, Ga., Philadelphia, and the Chicago area. While past albums have featured their fair share of bright spots, Miami Ice, the duo's third LP, makes a stark turn towards accessibility, and it's the kind of coup that elevates the Demons from ""side project"" to putative band status. Icy Demons may chug along to stoic kraut pulses and amorphous jazz jams, but their sense of humor has always shone through. With Rodriguez's vocals now positioned front and center, the Demons sound more playful than ever. The eponymous track grooves on a Devo-like synth line, with Pow Pow's work on the skins galvanizing what could've been another motorik drone. The track's a bona fide single by any band's standards, and elsewhere on Miami Ice the Demons tinker with other methods of fusing catchiness and experimentation. The jerky waterfall melody on ""1850"" takes a cue from XTC, dazzling the listener vocally while constantly keeping them off balance with octopus-armed percussion. Even when lacking vocal hooks, Ice's cerebral arrangements can sound surprisingly tender. The twinkling guitar arpeggios on ""Jantar Mantar"" feel like Battles shrunken down to fit in your palm, and the sixty-second keyboard instrumental ""Who There???"" does Ratatat better than Ratatat seems able to these days. Occasionally the genre-hopping veers into ridiculous territory, such as the elevator muzak on ""Summer Samba"" or the disco-punk one-off ""Crittin' Down to Baba's"", but a tongue-in-cheek touch makes sure these blunders don't detract from the rest of Ice. The detached, touch-and-go songwriting creates a glass ceiling on the album, and you get the sense they're almost robotically pinpointing some of these styles. Still, to take such sterile post-rock and extract this much fun from it is an accomplishment in the vein of Are We Not Men? Side projects are best when utilizing their low-stakes situation to take the kind of risks established bands balk at, and, by injecting a pop feel to their inchoate sound, the Icy Demons achieve this ideal. That is, if you still consider them as merely a side project.","Band headed by Griffin Rodriguez of Bablicon and Christopher Powell of Man Man and Need New Body has evolved past being just a side project, and here the group's genre-hopping aesthetic-- krautrock, easy listening, disco-punk, and more-- takes a stark turn towards accessibility.

There's a metaphor in there, especially when your singer is as striking as Sciubba and your band as smooth as Brazilian Girls. With these guys, it's all too easy to get caught up in the surface, whether basking in the clubland grooves they produce or being struck by Sciubba herself, sexually aggressive yet supermodel aloof. But beneath that surface there's a lot of work going on to make such an eclectic soundscape so seamless, and if the strangeness of album number three, New York City, is too well thought out to sneak up on you, that's not for lack of effort. If anything, we've become so attuned to listening to acts stick unlikely stuff together that hiding the stitches is virtually impossible. Yet it's still impressive the way ""Strangeboy"" morphs from downtempo lounge to full-on techno-dub breakdown, or how ""Losing Myself"" alludes to everything from catwalk fodder to New Order's ""Confusion"". ""Ricardo"" captures the chaos of 21st century urban living by way of jazzy horns, a menacing bass throb, and manic interrupting voices. ""I Want Out"" borrows ingredients from Brazilian drum troops, industrial music, and Krzysztof Komeda's spooky soundtrack work for Roman Polanski. The single ""Good Time"" is bubblegum dance punk that, despite its title, jettisons the banal hedonism du jour in favor of something far more fun and inviting. The woozy and swooning ""Mano De Dios"" is My Bloody Valentine by way of Latin America. Brazilian Girls have no problem making their mish-mash sound downright normal, which in a way it is. Sciubba sings in several languages, reflecting not just her background (she was born in Rome and grew up in Munich) but an increased familiarity with polyglot cacophony and culture clashes. Albums like New York City stress that in 2008, everything-- people, music, whatever-- is a hybrid of some kind. For the Brazilian Girls, its casual exoticism isn't just a point of honor, it's the only path that makes sense.","New York's dance-fusion pranksters Brazilian Girls broaden their already broad horizons, and have a blast in the process.

Sample and Hold,Simian Mobile Disco,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc645e6ef95969322e31/1:1/w_160/63d1328f.jpg,2008-08-08 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12085-sample-and-hold/,Fabric,"With all due respect to ""Songs Inspired by,"" ""Mark Ronson Edit,"" and ""ft. Wil.i.Am"", I'm hard pressed to come up with any phrases that invoke my insta-cynic as definitively as ""remix album."" After years of being duped, continually, against mounting odds, into hoping that a remix record of [insert artist here] might actually turn out to be great, or least sort of kind of enjoyable, or at least not a dog's breakfast, I'm pretty much ready to give up on the format as a whole. With a handful of exceptions (and even those are EPs), pretty much every remix record that comes to mind felt more like a play at cred points, a contractual obligation, or a self-congratulatory exercise than anything I'd actually put on for pleasure. The remix game is pretty Darwinian anyway; the best ones always do the rounds. Maybe these things just don't work. Sample and Hold is a remix album from someone you'd think would know better: Bristol's Simian Mobile Disco, who, lest we forget, have racked up some pretty impressive remixes for others over the years. With a discography that peaked with high-profile work for Klaxons, the Rapture, Air, CSS, Ladytron, and Bjork, you'd think these guys would have at least enough appreciation for the form not to sully what was, in retrospect, a sort-of underrated debut (2007's Attack Decay Sustain Release, undercut by the pre-release over-familiarity of some of its biggest singles and overshadowed by Justice's concurrently released †) with a posthumous release of warmed over, go-nowhere remixes from a cast of unknowns, b-level producers and the weirdly resilient Cosmo Vitelli. Sadly, Sample and Hold is a depressingly phoned-in thing, right down to its cover art, which-- you guessed it-- consists of a slightly re-modified version of the debut's. The misses start early: Simon Baker's opening remix of ""Sleep Deprivation"" wrinkles the original's rushy pulses into a twerked out tech-house epic that has the audacity to pulse along for 10 minutes without burdening itself with anything remotely resembling a second idea; the Invisible Conga People color over the exuberant, filtered 80s pop of ""I Got This Down"" with stately piano tinkles and, uh, congas; the Oscillation re-imagine the acid workout ""Tits & Acid"" as a noirish, proto-big beat clunker in the vein of early Fluke; even Silver Apples, as welcome as they are on this roster, deface the pleasantly billowy closer ""Scott"" with some detuned synth grunts and a purposely off-kilter drum track. The few submissions that aren't completely skippable come courtesy the album's more recognizable contributors. DFA's Shit Robot transforms the sleek, liquid-sounding ""It's the Beat"" into a serviceable grinder, unleashing its titular one-liner in at least some of the right moments, while Studio !K7's Joakim imagines ""Hustler"" against an entertaining-enough procession of different sounds and techniques. Elsewhere, the album's best moment comes from Erol Alkan, whose sturdily crafted ""Beyond the Wizard's Sleeve"" remix of ""Love"" outclasses everything around it by half. In the end, though, those middling highlights hardly amount to much. What's worse is that one of the album's more interesting initial features-- the fact that it's a track-for-track remix record rather than a collection of available leftovers-- ends up working against it. From here on out, it's going to be tough to listen to Attack Decay Sustain Release without flashing on its mutant twin brother. It should have finished him off in the womb.","Undercut by the pre-release over-familiarity of some of its biggest singles and overshadowed by Justice's concurrently released †, Simian Mobile Disco's Attack Decay Sustain Release remains weirdly underrated-- but did it need a remix album companion?

Strength In Numbers,The Music,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4213d197565213b29c/1:1/w_160/edd6de13.jpg,2008-08-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12055-strength-in-numbers/,Virgin,"The Music were never going to be a good band. Ever since they decided that dumbshit alpha and omega name was going to stick and titled their first EP You Might as Well Try to Fuck Me, they were dead set on greatness, even if it was the kind of greatness that meant ""big or immense, used in the pejorative sense."" Funny part is, due to the 2007 maelstrom of blog-house/nu-rave/what-have-yous, someone might look back at these guys-- basically Kasabian with less interesting interviews-- and think they were onto something with heaters like ""Take the Long Road and Walk It"" and ""Breakin'""? Whatever claim to prescience they had was forfeited, however, when they slinked back into classic rock riffery with producer Brendan O'Brien on 2004's Welcome to the North. But the truth is, they're more of a risible band than a bad one, suffering critical barbs usually reserved for the unlistenable. Call it incremental progress if you need to, but Strength in Numbers is far from unlistenable-- I don't know if your free time is spent sorting through stacks and stacks of charmless indie rock CDs that have the nerve to call themselves ""pop,"" but when the chorus of the title track hits with the subtlety of a latter-day Nas album title, it's damn refreshing to hear a group bound for glory as shamelessly as the Music. But as the saying goes, those who are good with hammers see nothing but nails, and despite recruiting Orbital's Paul Hartnoll to slim them down to a slithery club-rock hybrid, Strength in Numbers is more like a musical montage retelling the legendary Slam Dunk Contest performance of Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen-- it's all in good fun when you tank a tomahawk throwdown the first two or three tries, but 10 times of screwing up the same exact way...? Whatever surface differences exist between this and anything else the band's done in the past, it's still Music music-- one-word titles that could pass for ""American Gladiator"" names (""Spike"", ""Drugs"", ""Fire""), Adam Nutter running his guitar through the past three decades of pedal technology, and the same wallop of sound greeting every single hook, as if the only thing they culled from O'Brien is an admiration for Stone Temple Pilots. But hey, at least the relatively serene verses sound like ""Miami Vice"" incidental music, or at least the best electronica rock 1998 had to offer. Of course, there's vocalist Robert Harvey, who previously conjured an unholy union of Richard Ashcroft's egoist shamanism with Geddy Lee's range, and to an extent, he still does. But the story behind Strength in Numbers is that Harvey spent its four-year incubation period struggling badly with addiction, getting clean, and eventually cutting off his Elijah Wood locks. In a way, the music reflects a sense of sobriety, even if Harvey still traffics in dope/guns/fucking in the street flashpoints. But it's a sobriety where ""harder, better, faster, stronger"" or ""I can't go on, I'll go on"" gets snatched off the dance floor and shouted by a spinning class instructor. ""Idle"" isn't necessarily stronger than anything surrounding it, but at least it's different, relatively restrained with hard-panned acoustics, a sinuous, Elbow-like chorus, and whatever Harvey is blathering about obscured by a cloudbank of dubby reverb. But whatever thrill one can get out of glitzed-up bangers like ""The Spike"" is cancelled out by the sheer relentlessness-- Hartnoll's wall-banging production raises serious questions about whether human hands actually made anything on Strength in Numbers, and this is most obvious with Phil Jordan, who's saddled with riding nearly the same hi-hat swish/snare on the 2 and 4 that's been played out for almost a quarter of his 25 years. And really, that's why the Music have fallen on deaf ears for many since the beginning in spite of their crushing volume. Awesome, they seek greatness, but that title-- they only find power in a fabricated sense of populism that feels more assumed than earned and frankly feels a bit ridiculous after 10 minutes. So yeah, I guess in 2008, those Verve comparisons really do make sense.","Google-proof band is still going at it, this time with help from Orbital's Paul Hartnoll.

Unicycle Loves You,Unicycle Loves You,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc44eb335119a49ecc15/1:1/w_160/6ed161a3.jpg,2008-08-07 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12057-unicycle-loves-you/,Highwheel,"For a band in a nascent stage of their career, Unicycle Loves You was lucky enough to get Brian Deck behind the boards, and for the first 30 seconds of their self-titled record, you're ticking off his sonic calling cards-- clattering, junkyard percussion, odd time signatures, squiggly keyboards. The record has everything but Tim Rutili. Then again, Unicycle Loves You are confident enough to snatch it right back and turn the next half hour or so into the kind of ebullient indie pop record you'd never associate with the guy. They're a band with a vision, sure, even if said vision is a quick-cutting highlight reel through nearly every indie-pop hook of the past 20 years. ""Great Bargains for Seniors"" is almost a sonic thesis statement; in quick succession, Unicycle Loves You reveals a deep (if not a little narrow) knowledge of craft within its cramped confines-- male/female harmonies, old-fashioned palm muting, cyclical melodies, all within a sort of riff-rocky martial shuffle usually attributable to Ted Leo. It's a real nice problem for a band at this stage to have, matching youthful hunger with opening-act eagerness to please. Second song ""Kiki Bridges"" ups the tempo with a cocktail of faux-glam sass and popular-kid emo; for its first eight minutes, the album passes the ""American Bandstand"" test. But this is a situation where you start thinking to yourself way too early, ""Wow-- do these guys already have enough hooks to last a whole album?"" unaware of just how right you are. Take enough left turns and you ultimately start going in a circle-- as the record progresses, the melodies become doughier, and ULY gets progressively caught in a comfort zone of girls & booze indie-- in lieu of quoting any other lyrics, it's all but wrapped up in the line that sells ""Dangerous Decade""-- ""And she sold me out/ Now I'm gonna hit the bottle."" Without running through a list of ULY's artistic creditors, it can be hard to distinguish the latter half of the record from the dozens of other guys doing the same exact thing. ""$ + ¢"" is where the record starts to get overripe, Jim Carroll's barfly lyrics and strong hook fighting for space amidst an unusually crowded mix of keyboard presets. The casual misogyny of ""Under 18"" is the least of its concerns-- check your gag reflex before enduring the spoken-word breakdown and check your Dramamine supply before the band careens between time signatures. Any of its jagged offroading-- some B-52's synth jazz, faux-Aerosmith riffing, etc.-- could have made at least an interesting song if explored further, but as a mashed-up stew, it's almost like the Mae Shi in fast forward. Meanwhile, ""Yum Pla Muk"" is a misguided trip into minor keys, and ULY show they can't really navigate shadowlands at this point. Classic debut problem, in that if Unicycle Loves You have more worries about being understood than merely being heard, they have trouble conveying it. The question now is whether Unicycle Loves You will make more sense with time or whether Unicycle Loves You will.","Despite making ebullient indie pop, this Chicago band teamed with producer Brian Deck-- more known for odd time signatures and clattering percussion-- for its debut album.

The Colourful Life,Cajun Dance Party,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5613d197565213b2ca/1:1/w_160/340487c4.jpg,2008-08-07 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12072-the-colourful-life/,XL,"Bernard Butler produced the Libertines' first single, ""What a Waster"". Six years later, the former Suede guitarist and co-songwriter has become a producer of choice for aspiring NME pinups. Butler totally deserves his status as Britpop legend, but his recent reemergence was anything but preordained. Aside from his short-lived 2005 reunion with Brett Anderson as the Tears, Butler's post-Suede output has tended to be, at best, unexceptional. His production credits-- including the 1990s' Cookies, Sons & Daughters' This Gift, and the Veils' Runaway Found, but also Black Kids' Partie Traumatic and Duffy's Rockferry-- have been similarly scattershot. Black Kids have a handful of good songs, all of which sound simply inept rather than charming on the album. London five-piece Cajun Dance Party are better off-- they only have one good one! And it's better suited to the sort of rollicking, punched-up production Butler gave the Libs or the 1990s. Cajun Dance Party released first single ""The Next Untouchable"" last year, when the group's members were all younger than 18; the song's snakelike guitar riff combines with Daniel Blumberg's pinched, impassioned cries to overcome unremarkable boy-girl lyrics (""Do you really like me?/ 'Cause 1 and 1 and 1 makes 3""). Another jittery post-Supergrass rocker, it loses less than ""I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You"" when Butler polishes off the appealingly rough edges. The rest of The Colourful Life is, ahem, less colorful. Most of the blame shouldn't go to Butler, but to these not-so-ragin' non-Cajuns. There are many reasons critics tend to adore the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner, and one is that he doesn't write songs like this album's sunny opener (and second single), ""Colourful Life"", which cautions, ""Don't crush the bird just for fun/ Because that's not fun for everyone."" Another single, ""The Race"", exerts a great deal of Arctics-like energy answering an age-old question: If the sun rises and no one's around, does it still rise? (Um, yes.) And Blumberg's breathy whisper-to-shout antics quickly grow old, particularly on the ""Creep""-aping coda of ""Buttercups"" or the empty, Travis-like melodrama of ""Time Falls"", which fails despite mentioning a wildebeest. Not that Butler completely evades responsibility. The sentimental strings draping ""Yesterday""-style ballad ""No Joanna"" don't make up for its fundamental silliness and ethereal moaning that must have Jeff Buckley rolling in his (watery?) grave. Nor do they help second single ""Amylase"", which opens with a suspiciously Go! Team- or Black Kids-like group chant of ""1, 2-- 1, 2, 3, 4!"", has big bendy Oasis guitar bits, and is disappointingly nothing like ""Animal Nitrate"". That's from Suede, dudes. This slight album's ninth and final track, ""The Hill, the View, and the Lights"", is pleasant but befuddling, with keyboardist Vicky Freund briefly turning things into a Neko Case gothic fairytale as she gets her first turn on lead vocal. Earlier, within dud ""The Firework"", Blumberg sings, ""This is now and that was then,"" a cliché that means no more on The Colourful Life than it does here. One thing Cajun Dance Party's future selves have going for them, though: They aren't called Beirut.","Another in a series of jittery, post-Supergrass rockers, this young UK band released an excellent 2007 single, ""The Next Untouchable"", and now follows that with a Bernard Butler-produced debut album.

Stars EP,Ulrich Schnauss,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc5a5e6ef95969322e1a/1:1/w_160/c3ec2577.jpeg,2008-08-07 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12076-stars-ep/,Domino,"In the wake of a Top 10-of-'08-contending bit of psychedelia from M83 (Saturdays=Youth) and a resoundingly successful comeback from the previously left-for-dead My Bloody Valentine, Ulrich Schnauss might be wondering if his own reinvention as a shoegaze revivalist wasn't slightly mistimed. Certainly, the German-born musician has been smuggling elements of shoegaze into his work since the gleaming, careening electropop of his 2001 debut Far Away Trains Passing By, but he didn't fully embrace the form until 2007's uneven Goodbye-- a dense patchwork of starburst guitar squalls, billowy atmospherics, and cloudbusting pop. The four-track Stars EP-- released on the back of Schnauss' American summer tour-- is a gentle reminder that Ulrich's still banging on a chorus pedal or seven, and yet it feels undercooked. Featuring three new iterations of the title track (a new, previously unreleased edit from Schnauss as well as remixes from Mahogany's Andrew Prinz and Maps) along with another new mix of 2007's ""Look at the Sky"", it instead comes across like an unwitting throwback to a completely different early 90s mainstay: the Maxi-CD. You remember those: They generally came packed with lots of vaguely distinguishable variations of the same track, none of them particularly definitive, urgent, or illuminating. Nobody liked them. As pleasant a single as ""Stars"" is, that's basically what this EP amounts to. Schnauss' zippier, aerodynamic new edit might elevate the song to Ladytron-caliber pop, but it's hardly compelling enough source material to warrant a whole release. It doesn't help that the Prinz and Maps remixes are relatively faithful, the former a ""dub"" mix that slightly pares back the original's energy and hyperactivity; the latter a bit twitchier and denser. Call it lack of sheer repetition, but in the end, ""Look at the Sky"" emerges as the best thing on here. A pretty blend of swirling guitars, reverbed pianos, and pulsating rhythms, it's as lovely a 4AD homage as you're likely to hear. As the basis of a deeper, wider-ranging companion set, those highlights might have more convincingly argued a case for Goodbye; in its current form, though, it's hard to see how anyone thought this would be a useful addition to Schnauss' catalogue.","Released on the back of Ulrich Schnauss' American summer tour, this EP features three new iterations of the title track (a new, previously unreleased edit from Schnauss as well as remixes from Mahogany's Andrew Prinz and Maps) along with a lovely new mix of 2007's ""Look at the Sky"".

The Clipse Present: Re-Up Gang,Re-Up Gang,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc59ea9e61561daa7460/1:1/w_160/d4107b4f.jpg,2008-08-07 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12075-the-clipse-present-re-up-gang/,Re-Up,"Though it'll always be a very distant second to coke-pushing, one narrative surrounding Clipse prior to their 2006 breakthrough Hell Hath No Fury was the duo's underdog status. But after years of being denied should-have-been fame and fortune, Malice and Pusha T are now in a sweet position not unlike that of, oddly enough, the Roots-- a cozy label deal, almost unconditional internet love, and slots on typically indie playlists. With the turn of 2008 came the We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3 mixtape, but without much to complain about, Clipse turned to fabricating ""spirit of competition"" subliminals against Lil Wayne which backfired when the critical and commercial success of Tha Carter III proved that Weezy's fanbase not only included the critics who fawned over Hell Hath No Fury, but also an additional million people who don't mind paying for their music. If there's anything that tends to deflate Clipse's infallible guise, it's an awareness of this very situation-- check the sneering admission on ""Re-Up Gang Intro"" that ""Writers scream 'More!'/ Yet they don't run to the store.../ To write a verse is like a chore."" However real that writer's block is, The Clipse Presents: Re-Up Gang improves upon Vol. 3 in that it contains actual conflict: a clash of Re-Up's modest merits with its reasons for existence. We're strictly ""Stans only"" here, considering the mixtape's stopgap timing and limited commercial prospects. And yet, as evidenced by the numbingly iced-out single ""Fast Life"", too much of Re-Up Gang is done in the style of Lord Willin's baffling Jermaine Dupri collaboration ""Let's Talk About It""-- a track I imagine most of Clipse's current fanbase absolutely loathes. The problem here is that the egalitarian make-up of Re-Up Gang means half of the record is taken up by Ab-Liva and Sandman (still doing that ""cannnnnn-on"" thing before every verse, thanks for asking), who need no introduction, and are pretty much without peer when it comes to subsidiary foot soldiering. Really, though, they've got enough trouble distinguishing themselves from one another, let alone coming close to stealing any track they share with the Thorntons (what, Rosco P. Coldchain was busy?). As a result, Re-Up Gang is sort of like going out for a nice meal and filling up on bread. Beyond that, well... this is the Koch release. I mean, ""Grindin'"", ""Hello New World"", and pretty much the entirety of We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 2 proved Clipse know good beats, so you can't expect anyone's A-game on these Dre carbon copies, with drums that knock like first-gen ringtones. Though not ""dense"" in the Def Jux sense of the word, Clipse's flows, jam-packed with quotables as they are, require attention and room to breathe*.* Nothing here could possibly bring out the best in Re-Up-- not ""Money"" (the hook-- ""money, money, money, money, money-- give me some!"" in chickenhead patois), not the interminable yo-yo flows on ""We Know"", and definitely not the flatulent buckshots that pockmark ""Bring It Back"", which sounds like Dipset's house producers asleep at the EQ. A line on the faux-cover of Jim Jones' ""Emotionless"" (reprised from Vol. 3 with a new beat) goes, ""I'm empty inside like Hollow Man/ I'm here but I'm not, like a hologram."" If the first part of that quote played an integral role in the tundraic heartlessness of Hell Hath No Fury, the latter is more indicative of the ghost-in-the-machine feel of Re-Up Gang, which basically amounts to Koch's attempt to wring legal tender out of Vol. 3 (good luck with that). With the already announced (and already pushed-back) Clipse album Til the Casket Drops on the way, it's likely Clipse know better than to waste their best material on this format.","Despite recycling a lot of lines from We Got It 4 Cheap*, Vol. 3*, recent Re-Up Gang material gets a proper release-- albeit one with limited promotion and commercial prospects.

Migration,Takka Takka,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3babf31b7dc7155c8d/1:1/w_160/820ac55e.jpg,2008-08-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12049-migration/,Virgin,"Beware, all you rockers looking beyond your country's borders for inspiration. At best you'll be branded a novelty, a curiosity, maybe even, reluctantly, a pioneer; at worst, a dilettante, an interloper, even a neo-colonialist. Yet the threat of breaking this potential taboo, of committing this kind of cultural transgression, only seems to weigh over acts in the West-- no doubt because it's the West that writes the rules and determines when they could or should be broken. Indeed, no small amount of hand-wringing accompanied breakthrough albums by the likes of Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads and other acts, despite the good they did in opening ears to new sounds. Bringing us a bit more up to date, when a Brooklyn band incorporates Afropop, red flags go up-- ones unlikely to greet, say, a Senegalese band that sounded like the Strokes. Takka Takka's subtle if not seamless global-rock is less academic than that of the Dirty Projectors, less unctuous than Vampire Weekend, a little less prog-rock cold than Yeasayer, just to name three of the Brooklyn band's loosely likeminded peers. The group's also not defensive about the one-world direction taken by the aptly named Migration, a disc that doesn't differentiate that much between the indie-din of the New York boroughs and, say, the Gamelan music of Bali. Migration, Takka Takka's second album, was produced by Clap Your Hands Say Yeah drummer Sean Greenhalgh, and also features that band's guitarist Lee Sargent, which perhaps explains the still lingering links to straight indie-rock, but those connections are tenuous. This music aims for something new, something occasionally otherworldly. The unabashedly portentous pan-national approach pays off immediately with the Peter Gabriel-esque mood-setter ""Monkey Forest Road"", whose sequenced ostinatos lead into a web of interlocking guitars and pounding percussion (courtesy of the great Conrad Doucette, with an assist from the National's always on-point Bryan Devendorf). The alternately tribal and chugging ""Silence"", with its cool synth flourishes and awesomely precise polyrhythms, recalls Gabriel circa Security or Talk Talk. ""The Takers"" is breezier and a lot less alien, but ""Everybody Say"" proudly pilfers its percussion and guitars from a hodge-podge of vaguely African sources. The instrumental electro-acoustic ""(The Optimists Were Right)"", as well as its more menacing companion ""(The Optimists Were Wrong)"", are merely fragments that could have been better developed. But the former does set the stage for ""Homebreaker"", a dreamy meditation until an indomitably funky backbeat and guitar break the reverie to good effect. Similarly, waiting while the guitars coyly sniff around one another on ""Fall Down Where You Stand"" is worthwhile for the more aggressively interlocking end result. In fact, it would have been nice to hear the group stretch these grooves out a little further, as respectable as Takka Takka's restraint may be. It's no coincidence, given the context, that the relatively standard-issue ""Lion in the Waves"" with its conspicuous acoustic strum is the most mundane moment on the disc. Minus the interplay of exotic imported embellishments, ""One Foot in a Well"" might have been just another spooky indie-folk excursion, or ""You and Universe"" would have fallen short of satori. ""Change, No Change"" wouldn't be out of place amongst the slow-burn anthems of the National were it not for Gabe Levine's sweet, soft-spoken singing voice. But at least the band is honest about where it comes from. Trying to capture the spirit of rootlessness does not mean ignoring your own (indie rock) roots, and Takka Takka (testing out the latest in constantly shifting lineups, no less) does a commendable job bridging the familiar with the more mysterious. If the results are a little too conservative to be revolutionary, a little too carefully composed, understated, and clean to be radical, the group has nonetheless opened the door to new possibilities to be explored at a future date.","Brooklyn's Takka Takka metaphorphize from NYC indie rock to the latest of that borough's global ambassadors, with sometimes breathtaking results.

Wars and Tornadoes,Drakkar Sauna,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc34abf31b7dc7155c7d/1:1/w_160/2d8feebb.jpg,2008-08-06 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12045-wars-and-tornadoes/,Marriage,"As the heart of flyover country, Kansas is primarily a conservative state, with a cozy college town, Lawrence, serving as its cultural hotspot. Based in Lawrence, Drakkar Sauna-- the duo of Wallace Cochran and Jeff Stolz-- embrace the rich traditions of American folk, bluegrass, and country, yet do it as outsiders, sticking to the backroads and playing up the Old Weird America eccentricities with a subversive wink. The group's Rover, for example, features a song blithely titled ""O, God, I Have a Canoe"" that's played like a murder ballad (it's about a couple escaping marauding bears). Jabraham Lincoln features ""There's Not Enough Tits on a Wolf"", a quirky blues number that references the myth of Romulus and Remus and sounds like smarty-pants Camper Van Beethoven had they swapped Santa Cruz for the Blue Ridge Mountains. The group has also recorded a suite nicknamed ""Very Much Alone Pentateuch"", which culminates in a chapter called ""O, Fuck, I'm Fucked. Fuck."" Wars and Tornadoes, the duo's latest album, is a covers album that pays exclusive tribute to the Louvin Brothers, which makes sense. The Louvin Brothers clearly informed Drakkar Sauna's previous works, not to mention the fact that they were kind of eccentric themselves, singing songs refuting Satan and exploiting the atomic bomb as an excuse to get right with God, all while staying true to their gospel routes and showing off some of the best close harmonies ever recorded. To borrow the title from one of their best albums, the Louvins sang ""tragic songs of life,"" sometimes slightly tongue in cheek, mostly dead serious. Given the general goofiness of Drakkar Sauna's early works, you might predict this project will be similarly delivered with fingers crossed. But the biggest surprise may be that the disc is played totally straight, with Cochran and Stolz (and a few other friends) sticking close to the template laid out by the pioneering brothers Ira and Charlie. Tellingly, Wars and Tornadoes digs just a little deeper than the usual greatest hits, revealing a wider familiarity with the Louvins catalog of originals and interpretations and not shying away from the religious material, either. ""Tiny Broken Heart"" leads off the collection, and while the set touches on such standards as ""The Family Who Prays"" (whose lyrics give Wars and Tornadoes its name) and ""When I Stop Dreaming"", it does skip crowdpleasers such as ""Pitfall"" and ""Cash on the Barrelhead"", let alone the oft ironically covered ""Great Atomic Power"". Instead it tackles the earnest likes of ""The Weapon of Prayer"" and ""Are You Afraid to Die"", the former about the power of faith and the latter a harmonium-enriched open-letter to unrepentant sinners. Each of these nine tracks is played faithfully and respectfully, right down to the rootsy arrangements and tight harmonies, a sound closer to the Louvin Brothers' heyday than the self-aware here and now. And therein lies the rub: Why bother with these expert reproductions when the real deal is yours for the listening? Several single-disc collections of the Louvin Brothers are widely available. Bear Family released an incredible 8xCD set that's worth a few hours of your life. Only a total curmudgeon wouldn't be enlightened by some time spent with the Louvin Brothers, and surely Drakkar Sauna would concede the point. That Wars and Tornadoes is made with such care and respect is almost irrelevant, since such a good faith stab at the Louvins all but demands you start instead with the real deal. If you like what you hear-- and you likely will, at least some of it-- then you can follow the Louvin Brothers' lasting, living influence down through the decades and right up to the present. Wars and Tornadoes should be the end of the road, not the beginning.","Nutty Kansans tone down the crazy and go for broke with a disc of Louvin Brothers classics, respectfully covered.

Deuces Wild,Vast Aire,by: Ben Westhoff,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3c13d197565213b28f/1:1/w_160/bd2db014.jpg,2008-08-06 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12050-deuces-wild/,One,"There are good and bad things about having El-P make you one of the best underground hip-hop albums of the decade. The bad: People will compare everything you ever make again to it. The good: Everyone will give you their best beats from here forward. So it goes on Deuces Wild, the second solo CD from Cannibal Ox alum Vast Aire. El-P is nowhere in sight, but the album takes its apocalyptic sonic cues from Cannibal Ox's 2001 classic The Cold Vein, which he produced. Many of the tracks come courtesy of Brooklyn newcomer Melodious Monk, and they are full of shimmering, goose bump-inducing samples and crashing bass. Though the show is predictably stolen by Pete Rock on ""Mecca And The Ox""-- a reunion track with Cannibal Ox's Vordul Mega, which sounds like it samples not a water bong, but one of those plastic birdie whistles-- the beats here are universally good. Perhaps too good, because really, how are you going to have a song called ""Lunch Room Rap (It's Nothing)"" with a synth track that sounds like it was crafted during a cyborg attack in 2094? But despite the musical fireworks, Vast himself is the main reason Deuces Wild is a return to form after the misstep that was his solo debut, Look Mom...No Hands. On that effort he was crowded by better-known MCs and suffered from weak punchlines and a seeming lack of self-confidence. There was no reason this should have happened; Vast is a giant man who spits from his chest, and when he's in control of his singular flow-- as he is throughout Deuces Wild-- he sounds dynamic, authoritative, funny, and sinister all at once. It's a sign of his success here that whenever any of the (mostly B-list) guest MCs come on, you're immediately pining for Vast's return. ""Take Two"" sounds something like the Flaming Lips' ""Fight Test"", and is full of sharp taunts like, ""I know piranha rap niggas that'll eat you thin,"" and ""You thought rap was dead/ Nah, you was on Prozac/ It's all your head."" In ""Shu (The God Of Aire)"" he raps: ""I was here before man was scorned/ I was here before man was torn/ If I could finish the rhyme/ I would run around space and wrap up time."" No, I don't know what that means, but it sounds cooler than anything RZA has been talking about recently. The album is highlighted by ""The Crush"", a raunchy school-days reminisce about ""Karen, or was it Anetta, or was it Vanessa, Stacey, or Trecee?"" The sexual metaphors are frequent and satisfying, although some are more obvious (""She got the sweet potato/ I got the corn on the cob"") than others. But even when he's telling jokes Vast sounds earnest, and thus the album never loses its cohesion or its edge. There's not really a bad track on Deuces Wild, although the comic book and action star references wear a bit thin (Terminator, C-3PO, Indiana Jones), and there's really no need to turn himself into a superhero called ""Vast Man."" But what's most impressive about the work is that it succeeds without succumbing to the trends of hipster rap, emo rap, or radio rap. Its only precedent is The Cold Vein, and it continues nobly in the progressive indie-rap mold created by El-P.","Solo outing from Cannibal Ox member takes its apocalyptic sonic cues from his main group's iconic 2001 album The Cold Vein, even though El-P, that album's producer, is nowhere in sight; the result is a huge improvement over his 2004 debut, *Look Mom...No Hands.

Sand,Philip Jeck,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3fc0084474cd0c2a49/1:1/w_160/7c8cbc73.jpeg,2008-08-06 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12052-sand/,Touch,"One way to learn about a culture is to retrieve and study what it throws away. The multimedia artist and turntablist Philip Jeck, then, is an excavator. He finds worn vinyl records, tinkers with their surfaces, then plays them on any number of old, sturdy turntables, allowing their layers and loops to build and fall while he folds in bits of keyboard or other effects. Jeck hears things in those old records that others don't hear-- a short, banal passage might be fed through a pedal just so to create a startling new sound, or a saccharine bit of Disneyfied strings might bubble up from a dark cloud of overpowering surface noise. He takes old, discarded junk and sends it back to us like a reflection. Sand is Jeck's eighth solo album and, like many of its predecessors, it's constructed in large part from edits of live performances. He dedicates it to his late mother, and there's a famous quote inside from Emily Dickinson about death, so it's about mortality on some level. I also hear Sand as a political record, because of the combination of the album's title (a possible allusion to the Middle East) and the prominent use of the patriotically charged ""fanfare"" motif in three tracks. ""Fanfares"", ""Fanfares Forward"", and ""Fanfares Over"" are the glue that holds the record together. An element in each is Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"", which Copland composed in 1942 as part of series that commissioned new works to uplift a nation at war. ""Fanfares"" takes a short segment of the original, a whoosh of string and horns all warbly and tumbling over itself, adds bits of delay and noise, and gradually folds the various elements into a constantly shifting drone of overlapping loops. It's a powerful track because it triggers so many feelings simultaneously. On one level, the sterling pomp of the ""fanfare"" is the institution you want desperately to believe in. It's Cub Scouts learning how to fold the flag, the winner's circle at the Olympics, a moon landing-- music designed to make the heart swell. But Jeck, through the use of surface noise, processing, and editing, dips the sentiment into the acid bath of reality. Sometimes, the passages he samples are assembled to sound like ""Taps"". Indeed, you can feel something ending when you listen to ""Fanfares"", a way of life crumbling, some sort of dream slipping away. It's easy to be swept along by the mournful horns, but the constant sense that something is wrong pervades. ""Fanfares Forward"" shoves the whole burning city of the earlier track underwater, slowing things down and drowning it in an aquatic space with the high-end rolled off. And the closing ""Fanfares Over"" begins with a broken, dubbed-out calliope, returns to the main theme, and then explodes the whole thing in a perpetual flange filter that feels like strafing jet fighters. These are terrifically complex and layered pieces that are among Jeck's best. Unlike parts of Stoke and 7, there's never a moment here where you are unsure that you are listening to turntables. Beyond the ""fanfare"" pieces, Jeck finds passages of twinkling, almost sentimental beauty lifted from records of orchestral works (""Chime Again"") and infuses them with poignancy through layering and repetition. He also takes bits of indeterminate sound and stretches them into thin, eerie drones that almost sound like a field recording (""Shining""). You could say that these other tracks find Jeck in his classic mode. On a purely sonic level, however, Sand isn't his most appealing album. It's packed with mid-range information and sometimes comes over as blaring, which might suit the material but can be a little tiring to listen to. Still, in terms of its composition and the power of the music, Jeck continues to function at a high level, and he seems to have stepped up his game in terms of emotional complexity. Throughout Sand you can hear opposing forces-- grandeur and loss, beauty and ugliness, clarity and ambiguity-- bumping against each other, and the tension makes for some seriously rich listening.","Multimedia artist and turntablist Philip Jeck creates loops from worn vinyl, locating passages in old records that others don't hear; with Sand, his eighth album, he manages to do his work in large part from edits of live performances.

Daniel Variations,Steve Reich,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4013d197565213b295/1:1/w_160/9877e13b.jpg,2008-08-06 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12053-daniel-variations/,Nonesuch,"Daniel Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and subsequently beheaded in January 2002 by a group of Pakistani terrorists later linked to the September 11 attacks. That's the headline, but Pearl, like anyone, was more than a few facts printed on some newsreel: Born in New Jersey and raised in California, Pearl was the son of a UCLA professor, Judea, and a mother of Iraqi Jewish descent, Ruth. He was a passionate musician and listener, playing jazz and bluegrass fiddle, buying records by Miles Davis and Antonín Dvořák, and quoting at least one song title by bebop violinist Stuff Smith in casual conversation. In 1994, he wrote a story about a Stradivarius violin, the ""Duke of Alcantara"", that someone purportedly found at a freeway on-ramp in Los Angeles. Steve Reich, considered to be one of the four major minimalists in American music, is best known for his 20th-century classical innovations with phases, processes, counterpoints, and pulses. That's the synopsis, but Reich, like most any musician worth your time, means more than four techniques spread over four decades. Born in New York, Reich is the son of a Jewish father, Leonard, and a mother, June, who sang in and wrote lyrics for Broadway musicals. After his album Music for 18 Musicians became a relative commercial success, he met his wife, video artist Beryl Korot, with whom he visited Israel. They later explored shared Jewish and Muslim ancestries in a work called The Cave, and much of Reich's work has mined similar personal interests. The politics of the day have never been far behind, either. One of Reich's most famous pieces, ""Come Out"", sampled the voice of a boy who had to squeeze the blood from the blue bruises on his black skin so cops would believe he'd been beaten during 1964 Harlem riots. Reich's compositions have since explored cloning and the atomic bomb. Reich and Pearl's parallel paths meet in Daniel Variations: Conceived after a conversation between Pearl's father and Reich and commissioned in part by the Daniel Pearl Foundation, ""which is dedicated to cross-cultural understanding and music,"" Daniel Variations is the latest in a long line of Reich pieces to combine massed voices and meticulous instrumentation. Sections one and three use lines from a conversation between Nebuchadnezzar the Great-- a Babylonian ruler who, according to Jewish and Christian texts, destroyed Jerusalem-- and Daniel, who became his adviser. ""I saw a dream. Images upon my bed and visions in my head frightened me,"" Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel. Those sentences are repeated three times in Reich's recasting, and their orderly presentation by the 12-voice Los Angeles Master Chorale splits and stacks the syllables like the square stones of menacing palatial walls. Four minor chords-- pounded in pulses by pianos but stretched into tense suspensions by a string quartet-- offer the sense that the horizon beyond those walls will fold in, the staggered rhythms indicative of a steady tumble of troubles. Quotes from Pearl serve as Reich's fodder for the piece's triumphant even sections, two and four: Reich employees the same instruments, but he lets the violin lead many of the turns as a tribute to Pearl's own enthusiasms. This time, four major chords bounce off of one another, countering the darkness of their counterparts, even as the chorale sings one of the final sentences Pearl spoke before being beheaded on video: ""My name is Daniel Pearl."" In the final and longest of the sections, the chorale presents a variation on a Stuff Smith song title, ""I Hope Gabriel Likes My Music"". When questioned about his belief in the afterlife, Pearl once replied with that title. ""I sure hope Daniel likes my music, when the day is done,"" the text reads here, Pearl's words augmented by Reich. The music's bounce is at first relentless, the pianos flashing quickly as the strings flit in romantic figures overhead. Gradually, it all slows, letting the liminal message-- a musician quotes a journalist, who once quoted another musician-- settle like a luminous cloud: When you're gone, will the universe approve of your contribution? That said, the most intriguing component of Daniel Variations is its reminder that what's often made Reich so daring is the humanist blood pumping into his scientifically executed forms. Daniel Variations doesn't eclipse Reich's past vocal works, and its message isn't one of courage, as some have suggested, as much as it is one of solidarity. Light versus dark, you know? It's smartly built and perfectly played, just like the record's second half, the instrumental dance ""Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings"". Rhythmically and melodically, it's classic, resplendent Reich, but he's made these sounds with more vigor. Both pieces, then, are interesting without being essential, constituting the sort of record that-- thanks to the context of Pearl and Reich-- will be remembered but never mistaken as a masterwork from the composer The New Yorker once called ""the most original musical thinker of our time.""","The renowned composer-- no stranger to topical music, from the early ""Come Out"", which explored violence and race, to works since on cloning and the atomic bomb-- here creates a piece inspired by the life and interests of Daniel Pearl, the journalist who was brutally murdered by terrorists in 2002.

Fasciinatiion,The Faint,by: William Bowers,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc57c0084474cd0c2a80/1:1/w_160/6316d5a9.jpg,2008-08-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12073-fasciinatiion/,blank.wav,"Ten years in, the Faint are a) self-producing, b) on their own label, c) still letting Ticketmaster fleece their faithful, and d) as hard to hate on as they are to get excited about. I mean, these stylish Nebraskans, whose packaging always apes vintage Russian poster art, are, in terms of longevity, where Depeche Mode was when Violator came out, and Fasciinatiion is just not Violator solid. This act might have ""pioneered"" the re-cooling of 1980s keyboard textures in indie rock, but (like the Mode) they've stayed themselves while others ran with their inspiration into the respective electro, dance-punk, and now bloghouse, abysses. Weirdly, bands list them as an influence on press releases these days-- like, they've been lapped by hungry hosts of the very textures they reintroduced. (For proof, consult how Does It Offend You, Yeah?'s remix of this album's first single plays like a decadent, overprocessed ""update"".) Genre was never their preoccupation, though, and they've openly resented their critics'/fans' synth-related comparisons/pigeonholing. The Faint play Faint songs, see, and gosh, Fasciinatiion is awful darn Fainty-- if a tad minimal and midtempo compared to their last two platters. Ever since they became a ""Societal Ideas"" band on Danse Macabre, you know you're going to get some clumsy, too-little-too-late jams about the Big Issues: ""Get Seduced"" decries cretinous nip-slip tabloidery (kind of a writ-large sequel to Macabre's anti-gossip ""Let the Poison Spill From Your Throat""), while the earnest protests of ""A Battle Hymn for Children"" are almost condescendingly recycled: ""In the name of peace we make war,"" etc. Its stuff about guns-as-toys and violent video games is straight out of Terminator 2, which, like the Faint, awesomely hyper-utilized machinery and digital aesthetics to warn us about the horrific dangers guaranteed by the hyper-utilization of machinery and digital aesthetics. ""Battle Hymn"" is just one part of a whole suite of tracks during which frontman Todd Fink (formerly Baechle, he chivalrously ""took"" wife Orenda's name-- suck it, patriarchy!) attempts to, I don't know, deal with technology. ""The Geeks Were Right"" (pretty much sung to the tune of their classic ""Agenda Suicide"") already has the folks at Wired grateful for the acknowledgement of their supreme Gandalfness. The song's dread of the future sounds both rational and like a by-product of, um, getting old. The incredible ambition of ""Machine in the Ghost"" just makes its choral chant more painful; Fink and his mates try to reconcile, er, everything: ""Let's ask the atheists, let's ask the astronauts/ Let's ask the priests! The cults! The witches! The pope!...The monks! Shaman! The nuns! Buddha! The Holy Ghost!/... Meditators, pyramids, mathematicians, acidheads, theologians,...black magicians, physicists..."" etc. To be fair, Fink lands some interesting turn-of-phrase blows during the verse part, re: mortal egos wrapped up in a culture of fasco-mystical B.S., but that wack list-as-refrain ruins the song. Let me applaud Fink for trying. Yes, bro, it is frustrating to feel like people on this planet in 2008 need to be scolded about the bad faith inherent in killing for their god-nation of choice (see ""Battle Hymn""), and, man, I too mourn the absence of philosophy-as-such in the popscape, and hey, I also sometimes get tired of songs about riding on rims and boyfriends-n-girlfriends. But the Faint are sounding way out of their depth on the Important Concepts front, while seeming perfectly at home on material about relationship-muck. Both ""I Treat You Wrong"" and ""Psycho"" are standout cuts, and they're complex, knowingly ironic self-admissions to a disrespected romantic partner. ""Psycho"", an amendment to  Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" over sonics from the B-52's' debut, is also remarkable for giving mononymic guitarist Dapose something to do-- methinks he'll enact his Falco-esque running-in-place thing quite a bit on this tour. ""Fish in a Womb"" is also excellent, a ballad that suggests OMD duking it out with Her Space Holiday for a prominent soundtrack slot in a cyborg-directed homage to John Hughes' oeuvre. But even it-- and Clark Baechle's refreshingly very human/analog drumming-- can't save an album whose knob-twisty aural flourishes too often sound like a catalog of simulated farts (from pinched whistlers to airy whorls to wet foghorns). Something's not as vital here-- the band sounds more committed to the songs, at the expense of the neato spazz-outs. Maybe the strangeness of being the elder statesmen of retro-futurism is weighing on them, but at this point, whole-heartedly embracing the imaginative possibilities of their inherent theatricality and campiness would be more revolutionary than preaching the occasional sermon.","More than a decade into their career, Omaha's the Faint-- now self-producing and releasing their music on their own label-- have seen their infatuation with 1980s synth pop become an indie cliché; their first album in four years balances songs about geopolitics and technology with musings on the politics of romance.

Woo Lae Oak / The Death of Don Juan,Carl StoneElodie Lauten,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc36ea9e61561daa7415/1:1/w_160/446675c2.jpg,2008-08-05 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12047-woo-lae-oak-the-death-of-don-juan/,WizardUnseen WorldsWizardUnseen Worlds,"The Texan label Unseen Worlds reissues, in their words, ""accessible avant-garde music""-- a claim that suggests they're either idealistic or lying. Thankfully, the reality is as blurry and lustrous as the rhetoric: With two recent releases, of Carl Stone's 1983 tape piece Woo Lae Oak and Elodie Lauten's 1985 opera The Death of Don Juan, they continue to document a post-pattern style of composition that aspired to a humility and looseness uncommon in modern classical music. It's music that kept ties to the academy, but didn't bleat its pedigree, music that often sounded uncomplicated; small, even. It's not accessible-- most listeners don't seek out 56-minute drone pieces-- but it is, in a way, approachable. Woo Lae Oak, commissioned in 1981 by CalArts as a piece for radio broadcast or live performance, is a drone built on two sounds: an unspecified string, continuously rubbed for a tremolo effect, and air passing through a chamber-- a flute, or the sound of someone blowing across the mouth of a bottle. The sounds are recorded onto tape, layered, sped up, and slowed down. In the album's original liner notes, Alan Rich called it a ""musical ground zero."" But more than a ground zero, Woo Lae Oak is an amnesiac for itself, an ever-renewing blank slate. The problem with assessing records like this is that they rely on the listener's tolerance and imagination, which, comfortingly for all parties involved, nobody has any control over. Some might hear it as a gorgeous expanse, as therapeutic and undemanding as warm tea; others might hear it as foofy, inert bullshit peddled by charlatans to suckers who would stoop to intellectualize a rock. But for the converted and reluctant alike, some qualities of Woo Lae Oak stick. When Stone layers his sounds, the overall picture doesn't expand, it blurs. No logic surfaces, no figure takes shape. As a result, it burdens its audience with freedom-- an impossibly unmemorable experience that feels different on every listen. And unlike many drones, Woo Lae Oak has no earthy, imperial frequencies, no rumble. Stone even named the piece after the Chinese restaurant of his choice, a self-effacing gesture that acknowledges peace as marketable chintz-- where other composers might aspire to recreate ancient prayer scrolls, Stone takes refuge in fortune cookies. Even when I can't fully immerse myself in it, I leave with the important lesson that there's no inherent grandeur to size, no necessary seriousness to serenity. Lauten's The Death of Don Juan-- a more structured piece-- leaves me feeling more ambiguous. At her most conservative, she hugs traditions forged by Terry Riley or, to an extent, Steve Reich: motorized pentatonic-scale keyboard patterns overlapping endlessly, with melodies swelling out of the mix. In other sections-- ""Duel"" or ""Despair""-- she hashes noise, samples, speech, and guitar, a marker of a time in composition where, especially in New York, ""composers"" could've easily been mistaken for lead singers or the homeless. (Among other downtown musicians on Don Juan, Arthur Russell, who traversed and unified art, rock, and classical worlds, plays cello and sings.) It's Lauten's unwillingness to settle*-- Don Juan* is alternately mystical and exuberant; it marches stiffly for minutes on end and then dissolves into noodling-- that makes it a milestone. As a recording, it has a remarkably diverse vocabulary. But the slang of 1985 is the vernacular of 2008, and even in Lauten's most beautiful moments, the work dates itself in distracting ways. Call it the unique burden of being an innovator. And though both of these works were released in an era of great, likeminded composers-- Robert Ashley (especially Perfect Lives and Atalanta), Meredith Monk, ""Blue"" Gene Tyranny (whose Out of the Blue was Unseen Worlds' first release)-- they're essential as points on a map being drawn 20 years after the territory was first discovered. As a phrase, ""accessible avant-garde"" might stretch the reality, but it clings to the ambition.","With two recent releases, of Carl Stone's 1981 tape piece Woo Lae Oak and Elodie Lauten's 1985 opera The Death of Don Juan, Texan label Unseen Worlds continues to document a post-pattern style of composition that aspired to a humility and looseness uncommon in modern classical music.

Leo Magnets Joins a Gang,The Curse of Company,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc355e6ef95969322dc3/1:1/w_160/92511e9c.jpg,2008-08-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12046-leo-magnets-joins-a-gang/,Dangerbird,"David ""Wiley"" Rennick seems like a guy with a good sense of humor. Everyman for Sydney indie-pop outfit Dappled Cities, the guitarist/keyboardist/producer came up with a great name for his first trek into side-project territory: the Curse of Company. A concept-ish four-piece that includes Sarah Kelly and Tim Rogers of the Red Sun Band and Jack Ladder, it's what someone familiar with the scene might call a Sydney supergroup. Dig or no dig, Rennick has taken a turn of understated variety. Well, sort of. Dappled Cities' last outing, Granddance, was a tasty study in upside-down guitar pop that took comfort in stretching melodies out skillfully and often with lasting effect. But as much as Granddance boasted nun-tight songwriting, its eclecticism (the scattering of pages torn from the books of bands like Flaming Lips, Shins, Strokes, and others) was often its strongest muscle set. They kicked out large (they're still reported to be releasing a follow-up to last year's Granddance sometime in 2009) kaleidoscopic jams, and they did it democratically. The Curse of Company departs from this vantage point; with the exception of spectral vocal calls from Kelly, this is very much the Wiley Show. And though these songs lurk in quiet spaces, the album's period-piece aesthetic is torn of a much grander fabric. Based on the myth of Leo Magnets-- hermetic ruffian, wanderer, and composer, who, according to press release mystique, has beefed with Rennick since the 90s-- Leo Magnets Joins a Gang relies heavily on myth and not enough on Rennick's gifts for hooks. Magnets is said to hail from the Australian bush and its many vistas serve as backdrops here, though void of any healthy dollop of color. It's the sort of cinematic imbalance one could relish, but unfortunately its ideas obscure any entry point to the album more than illuminate it. In the end, it serves more as food for imagining than listening. Opener ""The Parade Devine"" sets the tone early-- a snare-fueled march that's capsized by its own sighing, it's a caplet of the sluggish, minor-chord pageantry and quiet-loud-quiet-loud dynamics that cage a lot of the album's many prettier moments. Caverns worth of echo and reverb lend Rennick's vocals a distance fitting for the sort of epistolary longing his musings would require, though it strips away much of the immediacy for which these songs tend to pine just as intensely, if not more.  And though vocal interplay between Rennick and Kelly become routinely angelic (see: ""Homecoming""), their turns mirror the few speeds this baby has: plod and clop.  Alone or together, nothing could exemplify the problem more than ""Side By Side"", a torpid waltz that wobbles and moans for just south of nine non-descript minutes. But despite that chasm in the middle of it all, ""Oh Brother"" washes dude clean of many a sin. It's a taut, rusted-string guitar closer with lines as precede them but with a catch. All that waiting and building leads somewhere: an exit point that's not only cathartic, it kinda rules.","Dappled Cities singer David Rennick creates a sort of Sydney indie-pop supergroup-- albeit one that is focused on its leader's strengths, a period-piece aesthetic wth songs that lurk in quiet spaces.

To Survive,Joan as Police Woman,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3313d197565213b278/1:1/w_160/69722996.jpg,2008-08-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12044-to-survive/,Cheap Lullaby,"Both Joan as Police Woman albums offer engaging NPR-friendly pop music, the type that blurs the very thin line separating beloved cred-laden ladies like Neko Case and Cat Power from contentious Adult Contemporary staples like Norah Jones and Sarah McLachlan. Both albums focus squarely on Joan Wasser's smoky croon, and her sumptuous arrangements. In addition, both albums feature Wasser dueting with one of her former collaborators-- swap out Rufus Wainwright with Antony (of ...and the Johnsons fame) on the new disc, and it might be easy to mistake To Survive with her first record. Unfortunately, the qualities that To Survive shares with its predecessors belies its shortcomings-- what once sounded novel and fresh comes off as staid and static the second time around. To be fair, Wasser's songcraft is admirable-- at its best, like on the laid-back ""To Be Loved"", a simple chord change coupled with the right phrase can open up the entire song. For every successful track like that, however, there's one like ""Furious"", an awkward attempt to talk tough which comes off as fussy and overwrought-- ""Are you not furious enough?"" she asks throughout as the flitting backing vocals and bassy instrumentation plays a sort of distracting shell game with the listener. When Wasser opts to forgo ornate arrangements, the results are equally mixed-- where a piano-driven ballad like ""To Be Lonely"" (with a sly nod to ""The Long and Winding Road"" in its intro) sounds overcooked despite its bare structure, the addition of a few strings to the lone piano in title track creates a gorgeous backdrop for Wasser's unaffected singing. This song-to-song inconsistency is exacerbated by the album's wonky pacing. It starts strong (with the pensive ""Honor Wishes""), and ends on a high note (with the title track leading into ""To America"", Wasser's duet with Wainwright). Unfortunately, the middle of the album, burdened with turgid low points like the aforementioned ""Furious"" and the cold implored passions of ""Hard White Wall"", drags it down into a tasteful morass that Wasser would be best to avoid. It's that sonic purgatory where music seems at once both adventurous and unimaginative, where a song takes too much effort to say very little, where the look and the sound quality stand in for anything substantive. Joan As Police Woman's debut flirted along the edge of this gulf, and while it fell in as often as it escaped unscathed, it had the benefit of being a debut. To hear the second album make the same mistakes in a different, albeit more assured, manner isn't surprising so much as it's disappointing.","Joan Wasser's second album follows much of the same template as her NPR-friendly debut-- right down to a high-profile, vocally gifted guest; the first go around it was Antony Hegarty, this time it's Rufus Wainwright.

Bits,Oxford Collapse,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4b5e6ef95969322df2/1:1/w_160/5edec339.jpg,2008-08-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12063-bits/,Sub Pop,"Bits begins with an engine turning over, a car peeling off, and, a moment later, Brooklyn three-piece Oxford Collapse barreling along like an excited pup chasing after it. Throughout that hectic rush, opener ""Electric Arc"" finds its grounding in one of its few lyrics-- ""I can remember things/ I just don't know what to do."" Guitarist/vocalist Michael Pace could just as easily be saying ""I can't remember things,"" and either way would work, as the two main ingredients in Oxford Collapse's songwriting are reminiscence and getting fucked up (see the title of their last record, Remember the Night Parties). But as much as Bits continues their exploration of post-collegiate drinking songs, they don't romanticize either aspect in the manner that Vampire Weekend or the Hold Steady do. Think more of the twentysomething working for the weekend, but giving up by Wednesday, enjoying post-work happy hours to the point where Thursday's sure to be a hassle. Or as the stein-hoisting hook of ""Young Love Delivers"" goes, ""We're doing fine/ For our steady, slow decline."" If this stasis has been explored thoroughly throughout the band's career, the concept of growing up has been less so, perhaps necessarily. The greatest pleasures on Remember the Night Parties were borne of amateurism-- think the the hilariously flubbed drum fill on ""Please Visit Your National Parks"" and ""Lady Lawyers""'s complete ignorance of pitch-- while the pokey moments resulted from an experimentalism that felt a bit too forced (the middle of ""Loser City"", ""Return of the Burno""). Nothing here hits with the immediacy of ""National Parks"", but consider it a blessing in disguise-- that song towered over its surroundings, whereas Bits is the sort of record where your favorite song could change weekly. For the first time, the band's neither over nor underproduced, and it results in a marked improvement that doesn't owe itself to a sea change of songwriting or sound. I wish there was a more exciting way to describe it than ""they're just better,"" but those who liked Remember the Night Parties and left wanting that vague sense of ""more"" are rewarded. Yes, this is hardworking indie with Sub Pop values, steeped in a continuum of 1980s college rock acts and 90s bands influenced by 80s college rock. Bits is streaked with irreverence, whether for C&W formality (the intuitively simple melodies of ""Featherbeds"" and ""Young Love Delivers""), instrumental tightness (at times, they can make No Age sound like the Famous Flames) or lyrical artifice. Most likely students of Advanced Malkmus, the most resonant moments still feel in-jokey: ""My love came back from Sweden/ Brought me some bathroom reading,"" ""He got jacked up playing leapfrog/ And he was never quite the same."" Even the record's most obvious sonic curveball (""A Wedding"") is only that because it's based off the sawdust cellos that punctuated the more shadowy moments of There's Nothing Wrong With Love. As is, the string lines mirror Pace's subtly trance-like guitar parts, weaving in high-register licks while an open G or D drones beneath it. Or, more thumbnail-style, perhaps a response to what doubters asked about Nouns-- what if you got rid of the static and the talking points? Lead single ""The Birthday Wars"" broils in distortion, initially feeling like it's following the mini-trend of having Dave Fridmann red-level your important follow-up. But it's not a slam-dunk hook that sells the song; it's the way Pace keens ""whoa"" at the end of each line. That's evidence of how the band has become wiser about apportioning big moments rather than simply dumping them on you. Similarly, ""Vernon-Jackson"" and ""I Hate Nobody"" both sound strangely plateau'ed-- the band gets incrementally louder throughout, suggesting a massive payoff that Oxford Collapse might have awkwardly delivered on in the past. Unfortunately, listeners too often get caught up in using a lack of coolness as a backhanded compliment, and even if there is a return to a DIY aesthetic with OC (along with Times New Viking, Wye Oak, No Age), it's still disarming.

Madvillainy 2,Madvillain,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc49c0084474cd0c2a63/1:1/w_160/af741cb9.jpeg,2008-08-05 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12061-madvillainy-2/,Stones Throw,"Allegations of lip-syncing on-stage impostors, rumors of health problems, long-since-announced records that never arrive-- what the hell is going on with MF Doom? The villainous mystique routine is an integral part of his personality and all, but when an MC who used to drop great-to-classic albums yearly winds up mostly vanishing save some sporadic guest-spot duty, it's enough to make you nervous and probably a little frustrated. What little he's given us over the last year has been sharp; his verses on the Mighty Underdogs' ""Gun Fight"", J Dilla's ""Mash's Revenge"", and the ""Strange Version"" remix of Heliocentrics' ""Distant Star"" do more to belie his quasi-hiatus than justify or explain it-- assuming they're not raided from some circa-2004 vaults, anyway. But where's his Ghostface teamup Swift and Changeable? Where's the hinted-at KMD reunion? And where's the Madvillainy sequel? Because this ain't it. Apparently Madlib got so impatient sitting around waiting for Doom to record some new verses for a followup to their classic 2004 collaboration that he just up and grafted a bunch of new beats to Doom's old verses. That's a risky idea: It's a thankless task to create a completely remixed version of an album that was already borderline-perfect. And no matter how hot the beats get on Madvillainy 2: the Madlib Remix, it's hard to sit back and let everything click into place, not when you've had more than four years to let the original etch itself into your brain. ""Accordion"", for instance-- well, there's no accordion anymore, and it's been renamed ""Borrowed Time"". Its transformation into bass-rattling, Dilla-esque minimalism with a ghostly choir backdrop results in maybe the single best beat on the whole album, but with the tone altered so drastically it's hard to call it either an improvement or a letdown compared to the original. There are a couple identifiable letdowns, though: The lighthearted ""Curls"" has been mutated into the claustrophobic ""Pearls"" and, like a lot of the tracks, it takes forever for Doom's verse to actually start, the natural side effect of tacking on another minute's worth of music to 90 or so seconds' worth of lyrics. Part of the appeal of the original ""Rainbows"" was hearing Doom flatly, coolly harmonize with the woozy melody in Madlib's beat, and with that melody gone he sounds untethered and adrift in the straightforward boom-bap of ""Drainos"". And while the beats are up to Madlib's usual high standards, they're not quite as stylistically unified; going from the crackling sixties soul decay of ""Fire in the Hole"" to the upfront, fat-dude-walk horns of ""Heat Niner"" to ""Monkey Suite""'s clean, Hi Records groove makes for good variety but fails to set a consistent mood. To make matters more bewildering, every little interstitial chunk of characteristic weirdness from the original album-- the 1960s UHF talk show intro to ""Figaro"", the harrowing snippet of Steve Reich's ""Come Out"" from ""America's Most Blunted"", the historical movie villain narrative bookends-- is replaced with some other hijinx that largely lack the comic-book drama and yellow newsprint tone of the original. Instead what we get are a jumble of Redd Foxx one-liners and hippie comedy bits that sound like they stumbled into the wrong record on the way to a Quasimoto album. And what's a DangerDoom track doing in here? Jeez. (It also can't be a good sign that ""Monkey Suite"", which initially showed up on the first Chrome Children comp as a teaser for what would've been the real Madvillainy 2, winds up here instead as if it had nowhere else to go in the future.) Now there's no real bad beats on here; many of them, particularly the aforementioned ""Borrowed Time"" and the jazz fusion of ""Strange Ways"" revamp ""Cant Reform 'Em"", are worth copping in their own right no matter how much they tweak your memories, and a number of these tracks would've worked well if they were released on the flipside of a circa-2004 12"" as bonus remixes. But over the course of an entire album it feels a bit like the hollow accomplishment of a pointless idea done well. I feel bad panning this: Madlib's definitely one of the most fascinating and reliably creative producers of our time, so I don't really want to do him a disservice here, and I admit that if it wasn't so difficult for me to let go of the idea of Madvillainy's original sound, I'd like this more. But messing around with an album like that is a problematic thing to do, even with the original sonic architect at the boards. It's like watching a version of A Fistful of Dollars starring Lee Marvin instead of Clint Eastwood: he may be every bit as good a leading man, but you can't shake the feeling that it's just not right.","Apparently Madlib got so impatient sitting around waiting for MF Doom to record a followup to their classic 2004 collaboration Madvillainy that he just up and grafted a bunch of new beats to Doom's old verses.

The Muslims,The Muslims,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3213d197565213b273/1:1/w_160/711e74ef.jpeg,2008-08-04 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12043-the-muslims/,1928,"Good thing the Muslims didn't have to release their eponymous debut in 2001. I mean, there's that reason, but beyond that, it's of benefit to these transplanted San Diegans that we've reached a point where no one's really holding their breath for a First Impressions of Earth follow-up-- seven years ago, their soft-garage sound would've thrown these guys in the caboose of the Strokes gravy train quicker than you could say ""French Kicks."" The good news then is that the Muslims have themselves a consistent sound, even if it isn't exactly the most exclusive one-- souped-up double time drums, three chords or less dusted with distortion and laconic, mannish boy vocals. And the couple of tracks they've got floating around on the internet have put them in position to capitalize on a minor groundswell of hype. All of it resulted in a killer EP. Only problem is that they kept going and Muslims matches its latter-day Weezer length (10 songs, 30 minutes) with latter-day Weezer inconsistency. It's unfortunate that for music that demands so little, Muslims plays out as a cat and mouse game of expectations and results. Matt Lamkin's lyrics not doing much for you? Not cool with the meek keyboard of ""Nightlife"" being the only sonic curveball, save for the pleasingly dissonant riff of ""America""? Hey, man-- it's three minute pop-rock, done up like 1977. Isn't it supposed to be that way*? Muslims'* uneventful midsection lacks urgency and intensity, and the band is left to mechanically dole out diffident three-chord strummers with lyrics that volley rhymes with the predictability of Wii tennis-- ""Hey all you killers hey, hey/ Why don't you all just call it a day"" (from ""Call It a Day"", natch). ""Everybody's talking 'bout rock'n'roll/ Everyone's talking about having soul...everybody wants to be in the know/ Everybody wants to know where to go."" ""You work all day and all of the night/ You've got nowhere to go, nothing to show/ So you're looking for the nightlife."" (from ""Nightlife"", double natch). Entire songs are built off lines like these, their distracting placeholder-ness forfeiting any chance to stumble onto profundity (as the Strokes are wont to do). At least they've got the sequencing down, as Muslims ends like it began: with a straight-up heater. ""Bright Side"" is four and a half minutes where everything goes right-- guitarist Matty McLaughlin handling the chunky riff like a hot potato while Gabe Patuzzi's double time drums barrel forward under just enough control. And while ""Right and Wrong"" does owe a pretty heavy debt to the Pretenders' ""Back on the Chain Gang"" (or even something from the Libertines' first record) it does manage to show a less obvious path for the band to consider. Mind you, I hope this doesn't get construed as another ""blogs stay losing :("" hip check-- god knows it's nice to have bands worth getting excited about, particularly in a city like San Diego that's almost completely ignored in indie discussions. Yes, the Muslims are good band-- they've obviously got some songwriting chops, their live show is a brisk good time, and they've got the right people in their corner. But The Muslims isn't a great record, rather a progress report of a group that can write awesome songs, very lazy ones, and few that fall somewhere in between. But it's foolish to write them off so quickly when they have one thing going for them that many of their comparisons never had-- a chance to get better with time.","After an excellent EP, this Strokes-like group aims to capitalize on a minor groundswell of hype and deliver a striking debut.

Nukkuu,Lau Nau,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc31ea9e61561daa740a/1:1/w_160/10dcb94f.jpg,2008-08-04 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12042-nukkuu/,Locust,"With oblique angles, high contrast, and blur, photographer Moriyama Daido has famously transfigured Japan's urban prosaic-- sewer gratings, stray dogs, strippers, bar patrons-- into stark, defamiliarizing visual poetry. This year, Finnish singer/multi-instrumentalist Laura Naukkarinen (aka Lau Nau), will provide the backdrop to an exhibition of Moriyama's prints with her own work. The pairing makes sense when you hear the first track of Lau Nau's sophomore album, Nukkuu. ""Lue Kartalta"" plucks, whistles, sings, and rings an almost-violent clash of pentatonic notes, converging in a discordant melee. Asian insinuations aside, Lau Nau's composition, like Moriyama's images, argues against complacency, taking sometimes-familiar/sometimes-not instruments and sounds and throwing them into a disorienting, disruptive new context. Lau Nau has further scored several contemporary screenings of silent film classics (including, intriguingly, Carl Dreyer's gorgeous, solemn The Passion of Joan of Arc). Playing a subordinate role to others' work may seem incongruous given Lau Nau's distinct, obtrusive style, but her music just happens to be remarkably flexible. The album translates to ""sleep"", and I've taken afternoon naps to its wisped strands of melody and hypnotic drones. I've also, as on one soupy, heat-paralyzed day in July waiting for the bus with my iPod, become agitated, almost panicked, by ""Rubiinilasia""'s confrontational drum punches, spooked moans and emergency sirens. Music for airports-- and chain retailers-- it ain't. Of course, songs whose lyrics are lost in translation will always adapt more easily to a listener's environment or mental states. Record buyers outside of Finland will hear the relatively obscure tongue sung here as sleek syllabics phrased as incomprehensible incantations, it's easy to understand why someone might put Nukkuu to use as ambient backdrop. But the album-- steeped in new folk's idioms, particularly its psychedelic tangles of string, wind, and percussive instruments and Lau Nau's delicate, breathy, multitracked soprano-- does reward active listening, whether you seek out lyrical translations or not. ""Painovoimaa, Valoa"" is a ravishing lullaby adorned by Nukkuu's most lucid and insinuating melody, and rendered strange by the rusty creak of the jouhikko, or lap-violin. Another highpoint, ""Vuoren Laelle"" is a simple, measured, and beautiful piano-accompanied duet. Nukkuu also reflects Finland's underground scene's experimental credos: tonal collisions, eerie piecing and sampling (such as ""Mooste's"" music box figment), and a vaguely pagan ceremonial vibe (""Jouhet"" sounds like a sacrifice to a sun god, or possibly an alien landing). Naukkarinen migrated to her country's isolated hinterlands after the recent birth of a son, but her CV documents her tenure in collectives including Kiila, Hertta Lussu Ässä, and Avarus, and she recruited former colleague Pekko Käppi, as well as partner Antti Tolvi, to support her on Nukkuu. Lau Nau's press materials report that the album was written and recorded in the stolen intervals spacing her child's naps, and that it reflects her newfound rural domestic bliss. As lovely (and convenient from a marketing standpoint) as this narrative reads, Nukkuu doesn't actually depart much from its also-excellent predecessor, 2005's Kuutarha. Which is probably a good thing. Lau Nau's chosen medium offers ample room for variation and growth. And with the exception of scene flagship, Paavoharju, Finland's exciting sounds have only slowly, sparingly slipped its borders. So Lau Nau's ethereal vocals, original structures and arcane orchestra of instruments (that include, according to the liners, Estonian 10-string kantele, baby phones, Russian candy bird flute and homemade horsehair bows), are all still refreshingly new to most of us.","Written and recorded in the stolen intervals spacing her child's naps, the sophomore record from Finnish folkie Lau Nau doesn't actually depart much from its also-excellent predecessor, 2005's Kuutarha.

"Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump, Original Heavyweight Afrobeat, Highlife & Afro-Funk",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0ec0084474cd0c29d9/1:1/w_160/afe457ae.jpg,2008-08-04 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12014-nigeria-70-lagos-jump-original-heavyweight-afrobeat-highlife-afro-funk/,Numero Group,"Nigeria is a huge and diverse country. Expertly, thrillingly, Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump captures a CD-length slice of that diversity, taking in nearly as many styles as it has tracks to offer a brilliant panorama of the country's popular music in the 1970s, with a bit of bleed into the two adjacent decades. The compilation isn't so much an attempt to provide a cross-section or a road map to the music, though, as it is a simply great pass through the tens of thousands of LPs and 45s that were cut in Nigeria's many cities from about 1968 to 1981. Compiler Duncan Brooker and liner notes scribe Quinton Scott aren't writing a textbook, they're telling bits of a story that we in the West had largely not heard until the recent explosion in releases that chronicle the music of the era. Both men have an admirable history with the music. Brooker was responsible for the dynamite Afro Rock compilation on his own Kona imprint in 2002, while Scott's Strut label has a solid history itself as the source of the Disco Not Disco compilations, the two Club Africa volumes, Tony Allen, Segun Bucknor, Peter King and Orlando Julius reissues, and the original Nigeria 70 compilation, which was one of the first to cast light on the incredible well of great music waiting to be discovered in Africa's most populous country. Over the course of 16 tracks, you get hard funk, Afrobeat, juju, highlife, reggae, rock, psychedelia, blues, ballads, jazz, and simple, sentimental pop, not to mention fusions of all those things. Sir Shina Peters & His International Stars open the compilation with a seven minute juju-funk blast called ""Yabis"" that features a slow but relentless groove built around a constantly repeated guitar phrase and thundering percussion that features a deep, variable-pitch drum. It's naturally heavy music that features a witty lead vocal poking fun at Africans with Western pretensions. If Peters' music is naturally heavy, its polar opposite might be the Peacocks Guitar Band's ""Eddie Quansa"", a lilting, weightless tribute to a Ghanaian highlife great. The guitars on the song scarcely repeat a phrase, intertwining in a constant melodic dance as the rhythm bounces and the vocals thread through, moving between solo verses and harmonized choruses. ""Eddie Quansa"" is just one of a handful of intensely beautiful songs on the disc. Rex Williams' poppy ""You Are My Heart"" is a bright and disarmingly direct love song, sung in English with great chorus harmonies and an infectious circular guitar riff that sets up an impeccably phrased solo. This song was a deserving hit and is the first of a final trio that take the listener out on a gentle note-- the organ that swells unexpectedly throughout Sir Victor Uwaifo & His Melody Maestroes' ""Dododo (Ekassa No. 1)"" raised some serious goosebumps the first time I heard it, and the arrangement deftly crescendos by nicking a common early rock'n'roll chord progression. Ifeanyi Eddie Okwedy & His Maymores Dance Band take us out with ""Happy Survival"", a dark-toned, even ethereal song that stays grounded through its sharp and loud drums. In this respect, the compilation is sequenced in much the same way a good DJ would sequence his set, pulling the listener (who, for many of these songs, may also be a dancer). Peter's King's awesome jazz-funk track ""African Dialects"", which features ghostly vocals, Rhodes piano, and muted horns, sets a chilled-out table for Dynamic Africana's ""Igbehin Lalayo Nta"", which slowly constructs an elaborate Afrobeat groove and patiently holds back the vocals until the four-minute mark. Likewise, the Immortals' cranking, brief garage rock track ""Hot Tears"" is a great come down from the 10-minute Afrobeat groove and spoken narrative of Eric ""Showboy"" Akaeze & His Royal Ericos' ""Wetin De Watch Goat, Goat Dey Watcham"". If you're like me and will never get enough of vintage African pop music, this is another in a bountiful 2008 harvest of great compilations with a very distinctive feel and approach. It sits perfectly on the shelf next to Sound Way's Nigeria Special compilations and Analog Africa's African Scream Contest, not to mention Strut's own original Nigeria 70 compilation. I only hope the floodgates stay open permanently, because I can always use more discs like this.","Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump captures a CD-length slice of diversity, taking in nearly as many styles as it has tracks to offer a brilliant panorama of the country's popular music in the 1970s, with a bit of bleed into the two adjacent decades.

Preteen Weaponry,Oneida,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc245e6ef95969322d97/1:1/w_160/a1991b5b.jpg,2008-08-04 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12031-preteen-weaponry/,BrahBrah,"Ever since their epic 2002 song ""Sheets of Easter"", Oneida seem to evoke something wild and transcendent in the press and the minds of their fans. Eager listeners await each release, ready to have their minds expanded and bodies exhausted, but the band has spent the past few years subtly changing course. After nearly perfecting their distinctive groove on 2004's Secret Wars, the following year's The Wedding was concise, diverse, and often gorgeous, while 2006's Happy New Year felt tentative and even somber (save for a few monster tracks like ""Up With People""). Time has proven these records all fascinating and rewarding in their own right, and this year brings another surprise from the band: an album that's not only nearly all-instrumental, but all one track. Or so they claim. It's not quite one long song, as it's divided into three distinctly different ones with track breaks, though they do flow together fairly gracefully. Whatever fans expected, Preteen Weaponry is neither a definitive statement nor some sort of a Herculean display of ability. It's simply another example of a band that never tires of challenging itself, and nearly always rises to the occasion. As the first track begins, the drums play loose fills around the edges of the beat, a faraway pulse of guitar keeps the time, and garbled wah-addled noise fills the mid-ground. But as the track comes into focus, the instruments start to discern themselves, the drums take hold of a sophisticated but primal groove, and Oneida start to jam. The layering of sound in this first segment, and how subtly it shifts, is striking: Primal grooves evaporate into faint whispers, inscrutable noise becomes a foundation for sparse and clean guitar notes, then acoustic guitars and incidental organ tones lighten the atmosphere. Divert your attention for more than a minute and you'll forget where the song had just been, and how it got to its present state. In the second segment, guitars squeal over bowel-shaking bass with sluggish, almost ceremonial drumming. Its one chord is stretched and teased until high and lilting vocals finally kick in, almost chanting, and the guitars scrape and squiggle like a pickup's engine in its last throes. All that fades into the background once the third track kicks off when a few laser-like tones come in and the song shifts to a major key. Oneida's love of repetition gets them saddled with more than a few krautrock tags, and drummer Kid Millions' work on the final track could actually fit in on a Can or Neu! record. That said, the rhythm is still irregular and askew, with Millions nonchalantly dropping beats as the melody whizzes around him. Soon, all the members intermittently drop in and out of the mix, almost dub-like in the segment's final minutes, as the band begins to use the studio as another instrument. Even if Preteen Weaponry is one more left turn out of many in the band's catalog, it nonetheless reaffirms what makes Oneida stand out: How they take something so endlessly parroted and tempered as psychedelic rock and stretch it, with equal parts discipline and abandon, into something more artistic and, more importantly, unique.","Surprising and delighting its fans over the course of a fascinating career, this Jagjaguwar band again delivers a successful detour-- a record that consists of one three-part, nearly all-instrumental track.

Conor Oberst,Conor Oberst,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc48eb335119a49ecc20/1:1/w_160/429ee0da.jpg,2008-08-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12060-conor-oberst/,Merge,"Both as a prodigy addled with ""new Dylan"" acclaim and an emo icon with a bratty attitude and nose-grazing bangs, Conor Oberst has been a squirrelly performer, whipping between genres and moods. Still, whether it's Desaparecidos' frantic punk-rock or Bright Eyes' folksy mewling, Oberst infuses most everything he touches with an awkward, frantic desperation; as a vocalist he sounds perennially uncomfortable, muscles tight and prepped to sprint away from the microphone. On his self-titled Merge debut, Oberst is focused on making escapes-- moving on, moving over, breaking out, hitting the streets, leaving it all behind, don't look back. ""There's nothing that the road cannot heal,"" Oberst vows in the Tom Petty-esque ""Moab"", and he's never sounded more convinced: Conor Oberst figures escapism as its own kind of religion, a workable belief system for kids that can't sit still. The notion of the road-as-savior isn't new-- for one, see decades of country music, from ""Lost Highway"" on-- and Oberst again embraces high, lonesome twang as his medium of choice, packing this record with the loose country rock that's ruled much of Bright Eyes' recent catalogue. The pervasive gripe about alt-country is that it's too gracious, too polite and predictable, and Oberst occasionally succumbs to Hank Williams-raising cowboy tropes [""Help me get my boots on, help me get my boots back on!"" he yelps in ""I Don't Want to Die (In the Hospital)""], but mostly, the genre suits his craggy vocals-- and his seemingly infinite supply of wistfulness. Like anyone on the hunt for meaning, Oberst is compelled by mystical or metaphysical enclaves (see Bright Eyes' 2007 LP Cassadaga, named after a spiritualist compound in Florida populated, mostly, by psychics), and he opted to record Conor Oberst in the Mexican city of Tepoztlán (the name of his new backing band, the Mystic Valley Band, was inspired by the city-- where, legend says, the Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl was born). It's not surprising that Oberst ditched the U.S. to make a record about flight, but even from Mexico, he manages to skewer American soullessness: Oberst has always had a knack for spitting out tiny, dismal nuggets-- ""There are pink flamingoes living in the mall,"" he sighs in ""Lenders in the Temple""-- that successfully (and succinctly) suggest a kind of cultural and moral apocalypse. Since his days as a spastic, barking teenager, Oberst has traded in a lot of his post-adolescent trembling for a calmer, less unbridled melancholy, but Conor Oberst is still packed with disheartening realities, and Oberst refuses to temper his pessimism, even when it starts to feel heavy and contrived, more like a narrative tic than anything else. Opener ""Cape Canaveral"", with its acoustic strums and barely-there percussion, is a lovely, quasi-nostalgic meditation of the 1969 moon mission (the ""red rocket blaze over Cape Canaveral""-- an epic escape if there ever was one). The song ultimately transforms into an ode to movement-as-salvation, setting the scene for the eleven tracks which follow. ""Hey, hey, hey mother interstate,/ can you deliver me from evil,/ make me honest make me wedding cake?"" he wonders. ""Atone, I will atone."" ""Sausalito"" is a rollicking daydream about camping out on a houseboat in California; ""NYC - Gone, Gone"" is a stomping, distorted burst about leaving New York for Mexico. ""Gone, gone from New York City,/ where you gonna go with a head that empty?"" Oberst demands. ""Milk Thistle"", which closes the album, is a grim acoustic song about dying (Oberst never mentions alcohol explicitly, but milk thistle, a purported hangover cure, is often employed, holistically, to treat liver disease-- so it doesn't seem unreasonable to read ""Milk Thistle"" as a song about suicide-via-whiskey). ""Milk thistle, milk thistle, let me down slow,"" he trembles. ""If I go to heaven I'll be bored as hell."" It feels like a fitting, if morbid, way to end a record about escaping life-- about escaping everything.","On his self-titled Merge debut, the Bright Eyes star is focused on making escapes-- moving on, moving over, breaking out, hitting the streets, leaving it all behind, don't look back.

Rest,Gregor Samsa,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2013d197565213b24f/1:1/w_160/0f4fdf3b.jpg,2008-08-01 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12028-rest/,Kora,"Rest, the third album of slow and subtle motion from quad-city collective Gregor Samsa, is like the beautiful person whose face you can never quite picture. The charms invite second and third glances. But, before long, what was first instinctual becomes intellectual: You only love the face or the music because it reminds you of something you've already loved, or it aligns with your accepted idea of what pulchritude had better be. Even as it's the glint in your eye or the grace in your ear, it fails to make its own impression-- it's forgotten until it reappears. The old loves preventing the distinction of Gregor Samsa-- a band that's been releasing distended, pretty music since the beginning of this decade-- shape a fairly predictable litany: There's something of Sigur Rós' cathartic aplomb and afterglow; the suggestive, electric atmospheres of Europeans as varied as Jóhann Jóhannsson and Max Richter; the placid, mesmerizing motion of Kranky Records titans like Labradford and Stars of the Lid. As with Sigur Rós, relatively aggressive highs drop quickly into gorgeous lows (the end of ""Pseudonyms"" or ""First Mile, Last Mile""). As with Jóhannsson, melodies occasionally stretch like gauze-- slowly unwinding ends brushing lightly against field recordings (opener ""The Adolescent"")-- or several distinct elements slowly bleed into one (the ways the vocals and piano sync on ""Abutting, Dismantling""). As with Stars of the Lid, the simple phoenix of single notes creates a circadian, pattern-based romanticism (""Company"", as close to pure imitation as Rest gets). Like the forgotten face looks, Rest sounds like a map of recent, fond musical memories. Perhaps the above referents suggest a monastic or melodramatic instrumental band. Both assumptions over- and undersell Gregor Samsa. Rest is, without exception, symphonic pop music, even if it exploits a set of influences different from those of a baroque baiter like Sufjan Stevens. Rest-- written by a core of the album's 11 contributors via e-mail exchange between Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Brooklyn-- softens the band's formerly sharp edges with generous piano, celesta, strings, and singing. During ""The Adolescent"", dreamy organ sustains and twinkling triads push against Nikki King's dreamy, doubled female vocals, while Champ Bennett's voice splits the difference between gentle percussion and chiming piano on ""First Mile, Last Mile"". ""Jeroen Van Aken"" teases with a duet refrain, as though Low's Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk were beckoning to one another as Charon's ferry reaches the other shore, leaving one of them behind. Most of the record's redeeming moments come when these ethereal melodies can sweep one into their slow surge. But words-- or, more precisely, definitions-- often strip music like this of abstract glory (perhaps all such bands should invent their own Hopelandic?), and Rest is no different. Images of self-doubt and self-reflection-- ""I'm not going to fake this, I won't lie: there's something I'm missing"" or ""And then things seem clear: We've been lost from the start""-- are the norm. Rivers Arms, this year's excellent debut from Texas duo Balmorhea, was not unlike Rest in its use of comfortable classical sounds. In its wordlessness, though, it kept contextual constraints to a minimum, allowing Balmorhea to focus and fuss over the meaning and malleability of every sound. Gregor Samsa often diverts attention from instrumental passes we've heard before with unremarkable but fair voices singing words we think we've heard before. That's not to suggest that Rest would be better if it were instrumental. It wouldn't be. Instead, singing is just another of those things that Gregor Samsa does dandily, just not well enough to be more than indistinctly easy on the ears. That is, every facet is decent. Not one is breathtaking.","The third album of slow and subtle motion from this large collective alternately evokes Sigur Rós, Labradford, and Stars of the Lid while adhering more closely to pop structure.

Yet despite the fact that Algeria spent most of the 20th century either colonized by the French or reeling from the effects of the aftershocks of an independence movement that had repressive Islamist, authoritarian, and military factions vying to fill the political vacuum, Algeria's rai and chaabi music scene thrived. Not that it didn't take some effort: Censorship and repression remain prevalent, and several of the country's greatest musicians currently live in exile. Even then, the tale of Abdel Hadi Halo and the El Gusto Orchestra marks something of a triumph. While working on an upcoming documentary chronicling Algerian chaabi (the more traditional of Algeria's two prominent strains of pop music), filmmaker Safinez Bousbia tipped off Damon Albarn, who headed down to the Conservatoire D'Algiers with his Honest Jon's crew to capture Abdel Hadi Halo & the El Gusto Orchestra of Algiers, who performed after a lengthy period spent underground while Algeria developed more hospitable mores. The project's already drawn more than a few comparisons to the Buena Vista Social Club, and the comparison largely holds. Here's a once vibrant music, chaabi, making a comeback, brought back into the spotlight thanks to the dogged work of a select few but mostly Halo, who tracked down graduates (all aged 60 to 90) of his chaabi pioneer father El Hadj El Anka's music school, and brought them together in Algiers. (The story gets better, too: After meeting with Albarn, Abdel Hadi Halo reunited with several Jewish-Algerian musicians who had long since fled the country. That reunion and a couple of historic gigs will be documented in yet another upcoming film and reportedly further recordings.) Produced by Albarn (in the Ry Cooder position), Abdel Hadi Halo & the El Gusto Orchestra of Algiers does justice to its name, although even though ""el gusto"" translates to ""good mood"" or ""joy,"" there's a melancholy air hovering over the music. With Halo on piano, he leads the large Orchestra through half a dozen often-long compositions, each a subtle and seamless blend of North African, French, Andalucian, and Latin American influences. Rhythm reigns supreme, with the small army of oud, qanun, bendir and derbouka meshing with accordion, violins, flute, and, of course, piano as various singers lay bare their souls. One can only anticipate the elated faces captured in the forthcoming film, as these musicians are given the opportunity to reacquaint themselves with this music once again. Fortunately much of that exhilaration is conveyed by the impassioned performances themselves. More exotic, mysterious, and religious than its Cuban counterpart, El Gusto Orchestra of Algiers is nonetheless just as stirring and sometimes quite surprising. ""Fatouma"", for example, spends most of its 10 minutes in a near trance-like state before shifting into double time two minutes before its conclusion. The elegiac start of ""Fi Bahr El Hob Mwadji, Kifash Nwassi"", featuring several well-integrated solos, extends for several minutes before erupting in a din of excitement; following it, the much, much shorter ""Min Yaati Kalbou Lil Melah"" works as a palate cleanser. In ""Lalla Fatima"", Halo's pounding piano injects an element of European otherness in music too often branded ""the other"" itself, at least from the Western vantage. ""Win Saadi"" erupts with massed vocals and instruments, while the musical and vocal call and response of the album's climax, ""Mal Djifni"", is downright virtuoso, nearly reaching the 20-minute mark but feeling like it could go on even longer. The character of each instrument and voice is respectively retained by Albarn's hands-off production, which sounds like it consisted largely of getting the mics in the right place, or close enough, and simply stepping away quietly, letting these masters do what they do best as he, the ethnographer-as-fan, surely sat back and smiled while the real experts did the work.","Damon Albarn heads down to Algeria to catch the country's chaabi renaissance in full swing.

Derelict Dialect / Vernacular Violence,Slim Twig,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbda13d197565213b1a3/1:1/w_160/f88ba0c3.jpg,2008-08-01 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11972-derelict-dialect-vernacular-violence/,Paper Bag,"If the name and face of Slim Twig seem familiar to you-- assuming you're not a regular concert-goer in downtown Toronto-- it's probably because you recently took a chance on a rental of The Tracey Fragments, a bizarro 2007 psycho-drama from director Bruce McDonald in which Slim stars opposite a pre-Juno Ellen Page (but with background music provided by Broken Social Scene instead of the Moldy Peaches). I bring this up not to score quick Google hits from curious Ellen Page fans (though thanks for sticking for around if this is how you wound up here), but to suggest that knowledge of Slim's acting career goes some way to help understand the music he creates. Not all of it, mind you; as one half of Toronto garage-punk duo Tropics, Slim simply lets loose with a feral take on the Birthday Party's blitzkrieg blues. But the two releases that bear his own name-- the Derelict Dialect and Vernacular Violence EPs-- are more revelatory looks inside the actor's studio, capturing both the desire to cultivate a persona and extract an enduring mythology from it. So fascinated is Slim with documenting the process of his own becoming that his first widely available release, Derelict Dialect (issued this past spring on Paper Bag Records), is essentially an odds-and-sods collection doubling as creation myth. The seven-song mini-album collects early experiments that would assume a more steely shape on the new Vernacular Violence EP, whose songs were recorded after the Derelict Dialect material, but several of which were actually first released beforehand last fall in a limited local run under the title of Whiite Fantaseee. Having approached Derelict Dialect after spending several months with the Whiite Fantaseee/ Vernacular Violence material, what's immediately striking is that, for recordings made months apart, the two relate very little to one another-- and that, depending on your perspective, Slim has either evolved or stripped his music down to its pure essence. Derelict Dialect does introduce elements that would become more pronounced on Vernacular Violence: Slim's fondness for self-reflexive characterization (see: ""The Austere Gentleman"", an off-kilter ode to old-school virtues) and an overdriven analog-keyboard fuzz that immediately aligns him with an oft-invoked reference point, Suicide. But rather fasten him to that band's synth-punkabilly tradition and ascetic cool (that would come later), Derelict Dialect documents the messy process of, as Slim likes to call it, ""songsculpting""-- where you're not sure what exactly you're creating until you take a step back from it. And even then you're not quite sure what you're looking at: ""The Replica & the Martyr""-- Derelict Dialect's most intriguing and confounding track-- finds Slim leaning on his keys and harmonizing with himself in ominous monotone over a marital drum beat, only to switch up the game plan a minute in, leaving the original melody to defend itself against a ringing, repeated piano chord and a flurry of arrhythmic ticks. Derelict Dialect's wobbly foundations-- a collapsing pawn shop of wheezing synths, beat-up acoustic guitars, and hiccupping drums-- are manifest in Slim's elastic voice, which assumes the devilish tenor of Liars' Angus Andrews (""The Replica & the Martyr"", ""Birthing & Birthing""), Dylan-esque nasally ascensions (""Trembeltongue"") and even motor-mouthed hip-hopped spiel (""The Austere Gentleman""). But despite its occasional bouts of scatterbrained inscrutability, there is a certain logic at play here: the carnivalistic quality of that pervasive keyboard sound serving as an apt reflection of the songs' funhouse-mirror shapes. Perhaps by design, ""Trembletounge"" closes out Derelict Dialect with two minutes of eerie, haunted-house organ drones-- a retroactive setting of the scene for Vernacular Violence's zombie a-go-go. While ostensibly more minimal in presentation than Derelict Dialect-- with that album's sea-sick rhythms replaced by precise drum-machine motions-- Vernacular Violence immediately feels more fleshed out: Slim sashays into the lounge-lizard lechery of ""Brothl Hunting!"" and the sleazy samba of ""Tormen"" with a newly perfected Nick Cave bellow that lends him a more creepy charisma, and a more coherent set of lyrical signifiers (shark skin suits, snake-oil salesmen) to better complement the grease in his pompadour. (Though curiously, the one new track that distinguishes Vernacular Violence from its previous Whiite Fantaseee edition, ""Street Proposition"", is a morose beatbox-troubadour warble that's more in line with Derelict Dialect's hermetic aesthetic.) True to his self-referential persona, Slim explicitly outlines his transformation in ""Gate Hearing!"" which refashions the austere gentleman of old as ""that elegant smoker with the hair so slick and styled that there ain't another man for at least 10 miles, baby."" But for even more compelling evidence of Slim's progress, look no further than the EP's mesmerizing 10-minute centerpiece, ""Whiite Fantaseee"", in which Slim's growing confidence as a performer dovetails with his early interests in exploratory composition, producing a future-shocked junkie-punk epic that plays out like Suicide's ""Frankie Teardrop"" re-cut with Lou Reed's ""Street Hassle"" string section. Atop a tick-tock beat that doesn't waver for the song's entire duration, Slim lets his voice echo through a desolate cityscape for two minutes before his repeated incantation of the song's title summons an overwhelming swirl of cellos and layer upon layer of intensifying synth drones; when Slim returns at the five-minute mark to shout out the song title again overtop this sinister symphony, his reverb-drenched voice trembles with the dread of someone who can't believe what he's wrought-- even the drum machine sounds a little spooked-- before the song slowly dissolves into a gothic funeral march. Never mind his multi-instrumental facility; like all fine actors, Slim Twig's real talent is making his fantassee feel so real.","Two EPs from this theatrically-inclined Toronto musician/actor-- he starred opposite a pre-Juno Ellen Page in the 2007 film The Tracey Fragments-- show his desire to cultivate a persona and extract an enduring mythology from it, as he brings to mind kindred spirits like Nick Cave, Lou Reed, and Suicide.

Ragga Twins Step Out,Ragga Twins,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2613d197565213b25c/1:1/w_160/c774ce4b.jpg,2008-08-01 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12033-ragga-twins-step-out/,Soul Jazz,"The Ragga Twins don't have a Wikipedia entry. They don't have a biography on allmusic.com. As of the end of July, none of their releases on iTunes feature a single customer review. They're strangely underrepresented in the annals of pop music, even by the standards of overlooked pioneers. Blogger Matt Woebot set about trying to rectify this by putting their 1991 debut (and only full-length) Reggae Owes Me Money at #7 on his list of the 100 Greatest Records Ever, one slot behind Kraftwerk's Computer World, calling it ""the best record to emerge out of the UK acid house scene… it's also, by default, the best record to come out of the UK's Dancehall scene. And the best Grime LP ever!"" It's a bit of canon-tweaking, sure, but the only fault with that particular summary is one of omission: The Ragga Twins, with the backing of legendary underground production team Shut Up and Dance, also happened to create the first great blueprint for jungle. Not exactly jungle as we remember it now, technically-- the Ragga Twins' 1990-92 output, which comprised the majority of their career work until their mid-aughts comeback, lacks the 150+ BPM pace and ""Amen"" break-chopping most obviously identified with the genre by 1994. But it was a solid prototype, as Soul Jazz's compilation Ragga Twins Step Out proves. A collection of nearly everything worth hearing from the crew, including several singles, two early pre-Ragga Twins tracks, and all but two cuts from Reggae Owes Me Money, this 2xCD set is their definitive document-- at least as far as copyright can allow. Shut Up and Dance, comprised of Philip ""PJ"" Johnson and Carlton ""Smiley"" Hyman, were an up-and-coming production duo with their own label, and one of their earliest releases forged their partnership with Trevor and David Destouche, better known as Flinty Badman and Deman Rocker. The two MCs were veterans of London's Unity sound system, and after SUAD came to Deman to ask for permission to sample his toasting for their 1989 12"" ""Lamborghini"", the Ragga Twins were born. The evolution was practically immediate: The two pre-SUAD cuts on this comp, ""Hard Drugs"" and the Thatcher-baiting ""Iron Lady"" (both recorded under the name Deman Rockers), are fine digital dancehall in the tradition of close Unity associate King Jammy. But once ""Ragga Trip"" dropped, with its TB-303 acid house squelch and its unmistakable b-boy drum break, things promised to be radically different. What arose was a sound that melded hip-hop, digital dancehall, and acid-- something that you might get at the union of a Criminal Minded/""Under Mi Sleng Teng""/""Voodoo Ray"" Venn diagram -- and provided a rougher, street-level counterpoint to rave's giddy utopianism. Production-wise, some of this feels a little like a transitional way-station (albeit a crucial and exciting one) on the road to jungle, as the production on many of the tracks-- ""Rudeboy"", ""The Truth"", ""The Homeless Problem""-- sound a bit more like hardcore techno and acid house gone extra-fierce than a clear path towards drum'n'bass. But that doesn't necessarily make it archaic on its own, and even out of its turn-of-the-nineties context the beats still sound rugged. The way ""18 Speaker"" welds downtempo dub to uptempo breaks isn't just a slick rhythmic maneuver, it's a particularly intense highwire act where spaced-out piano and slow, rumbling bass battle with packed, charging beats. ""Wipe the Needle"", meanwhile, takes a sample of Mantronix's classic electro monster ""Bassline"", rivets a harder, faster beat to it and cranks up the intensity from head-bobbing to arm-waving. And if the production didn't always anticipate jungle, the MCing definitely did. Flinty and Deman's booming voices weren't just conduits for Shut Up and Dance's production style, they were the ideal complement, ratcheting up the intensity and grime in the lyrical content as sure as the beats raised the stakes for hardcore. ""Ragga Trip""-- a rewrite of ""Hard Drugs""-- is about the dangers of getting fucked up on heavy narcotics at raves, ""Illegal Gunshot"" relates a club shooting scenario, and classic badman themes and invocations crop up in cuts like ""Rudeboy"" and ""Hooligan 69"" (included here as a remix; the original's Prince samples proved unclearable). While SUAD's production nicely accommodated guest spots from sweet-singing reggae stars like Junior Reid (""Shine Eye"") and Richie Davis (""Good Times""), its primary purpose was to give early-90s rave a dancehall ruggedness, a task that Flinty and Deman would parlay into an explosive underground movement. Which brings us to a bit of sad irony: Shut Up and Dance nearly got sued out of existence when their 1992 production ""Raving, I'm Raving"" drew some unwanted attention for an uncleared sample of Marc Cohn's ""Walking in Memphis"". Left without a label, the Ragga Twins wound up signing with EMI, and in 1995-- when they could have been knee-deep in the jungle scene they helped spark-- they instead wound up recording the Australia-only Rinsin' Lyrics, a jazz-influenced record produced by Us3 (remember those guys? ""Cantaloop""? Yeah). Despite a hiatus for much of the late 90s and early aughts, the Ragga Twins have endured, and they're still working in scenes ranging from drum'n'bass (numerous electro-inflected cuts with Aquasky) to dubstep (""Reverse Rebel"", from Neil Landstrumm's superlative Restaurant of Assassins). But by making a lot of previously-scarce material accessible once again, Ragga Twins Step Out should hopefully help shed a bit more light on how much they really mean to the sound of London.","Strangely underrepresented in the annals of pop music-- even by the standards of overlooked pioneers-- the Ragga Twins are rescued from the dustbin of history by Soul Jazz, which presents this 2xCD collection of their music, among the first great blueprints for jungle.

Parallel Lines: Deluxe Edition,Blondie,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc45c0084474cd0c2a5b/1:1/w_160/ea8ec31e.jpg,2008-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12058-parallel-lines-deluxe-edition/,Capitol,"""Blondie is a band,"" read the group's initial press releases. The intent of this tagline was clear, as was the need for it: ""This is an accomplished bunch of musicians, a tight, compact group versed in everything from surf to punk to girl group music to erstwhile new wave,"" it seemed to say, ""but, oh-- I'm sure you couldn't help but focus on blonde frontwoman Debbie Harry."" In America, however, people didn't notice the group quite so quickly. Their first two records-- a switchblade of a self-titled debut and its relatively weak follow-up Plastic Letters-- birthed a pair of top 10 hits in the UK but had been, at best, minor successes in the U.S.; the debut didn't chart, while Plastic scraped the top 75. Despite savvy marketing-- the group filmed videos for each of its singles, that now-iconic duochromatic cover photo-- the group's third and easily best album, Parallel Lines, didn't take off until they group released ""Heart of Glass"", a single that abandoned their CBGB roots for a turn in the Studio 54 spotlight. Though its subtle charms included a bubbling rhythm, lush motorik synths, and Harry's remarkably controlled and assured vocal, ""Heart of Glass"" started as a goof, a take-off on the upscale nightlife favored outside of Blondie's LES home turf. The swift move from the fringes to the top of the charts tagged Blondie as a singles group-- no shame, and they did have one of the best runs of singles in pop history-- but it's helped Parallel Lines weirdly qualify as an undiscovered gem, a sparkling record half-full of recognized classics that, nevertheless, is hiding in plain sight. Landing a few years before MTV and the second British Invasion codified and popularized the look and sound of 1980s new wave, Parallel Lines' ringing guitar pop has entered our collective consciousness through compilations (built around ""Heart"" plus later #1s ""Call Me"", ""Rapture"", and ""The Tide Is High""), ads, film trailers, and TV shows rather than the album's ubiquity. Time has been kind, however, to the record's top tier-- along with ""Heart of Glass"", Parallel boasts ""Sunday Girl"" and the incredible opening four-track run of ""Picture This"", ""Hanging on the Telephone"", ""One Way or Another"", and ""Fade Away and Radiate"". The songs that fill out the record (""11:59"", ""Will Anything Happen?"", ""I'm Gonna Love You Too"", ""Just Go Away"", ""Pretty Baby"") are weak only by comparison, and could have been singles for many of Blondie's contemporaries, making this one of the most accomplished pop albums of its time. In a sense, that time has long passed: Blondie-- like contemporaries such as the Cars and the UK's earliest New Pop artists-- specialized in whipsmart chart music created by and for adults, a trick that has all but vanished from the pop landscape. Parallel Lines, however, is practically a blueprint for the stuff: ""Picture This"" and ""One Way or Another"" are exuberant new wave, far looser than the stiff, herky-jerky tracks that would go on to characterize that sound in the 80s; ""Will Anything Happen?"" and the band's cover of the Nerves' ""Hanging on the Telephone"" are headstrong rock; ""11:59"" does run-for-the-horizon drama, while ""Sunday Girl"" conveys a sense of elegance. The record's closest thing to a ballad, the noirish ""Fade Away and Radiate"", owes a heavy debt to the art-pop of Roxy Music. Harry herself was a mannered and complex frontwoman, possessed of a range of vocal tricks and affectations. She was as at home roaming around in the open spaces of ""Radiate"" or ""Heart of Glass"" as she was pouting and winking through ""Picture This"" and ""Sunday Girl"" or working out front of the group's more hard-charging tracks. That versatility and charm extended to her sexuality as well-- she had the sort of gamine, sophisticated look of a French new wave actress but always seemed supremely grounded and approachable, almost tomboyish. (That approachability was wisely played up in the band's choice of key covers throughout its career-- ""Hanging on the Telephone"", ""Denis"", and ""The Tide Is High"" each position Harry as a romantic pursuer with a depth and range of emotions rather than simply as an unattainable fantasy.) Already into her thirties-- ancient by pop music standards-- when Blondie released its debut album, Harry (and many of her bandmates) had years of industry experience and music fandom; at the turn of the next decade, they would combine pop and art impulses like few bands before or since. The lush, shiny sound of Blondie still greatly informs European pop-- which pulls less from hip-hop and R&B than its American counterpart-- as evidenced by the Continent's best recent pop architects and artists (producers Richard X and Xenomania, plus Robyn, Girls Aloud, and Annie); in America, however, the group is oddly seems tied to the past, a product of its era. Even the release of this record is built on the tentative need to celebrate its 30th anniversary. (An opportunity not fully explored: This latest reissue of the record includes a new album cover, as well as a DVD with four videos of television performances and a quartet of mostly unneeded extras-- the 7"" edit of ""Heart of Glass"", a French version of ""Sunday Girl"", and a pair of remixes.) In that sense, this isn't a record that needs to be re-purchased-- if you own it already, skip this. Sadly, I get the feeling not many people under a certain age do own the record, however, which justifies the reason for trying to re-introduce it to a new audience-- it's still as sparkling and three-dimensional as ever.","Blondie's third and best full-length-- a whipsmart album from the days when there was chart pop made by and for adults-- is an oddly undiscovered gem with charms that extend far beyond its iconic, oft-compiled singles.

Kissing the Contemporary Bliss,Dredd Foole,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2d5e6ef95969322dac/1:1/w_160/1b97d5de.jpg,2008-07-31 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12038-kissing-the-contemporary-bliss/,Child of MicrotonesChild of Microtones,"The terms used for experimental folk music in recent years-- ""free folk,"" ""psych folk,"" ""freak folk""-- have been stretched so thin, they've lost a lot of their meaning. But one, ""New Weird America,"" has held some water. That's because when David Keenan coined the phrase in the August 2003 issue of The Wire, he meant it less as a style than a region-- a specific collective of Northeastern artists centered around the Brattleboro Free Folk Festival in Vermont. Getting even more specific, Keenan noted that most of this group were influenced by one particular record: Dredd Foole's 1994 classic In Quest of Tense. That album is a mesmerizing collection of exploratory guitar, haunting vocals, and dark reverb, evoking the rituals of Velvet Underground associate Angus MacLise, the psych of early Pink Floyd, and the outsider art of Jandek. But In Quest of Tense didn't make a huge dent when first released-- Foole even conjectured in a 2004 interview that 80% of its 1,000-copy run still sat unsold in the Forced Exposure warehouse where he once worked. But it did impress contemporary avant-folk musicians like Christina Carter of Charalambides, Ben Chasny of Six Organs of Admittance, and Matt Valentine of Tower Recordings. The latter has worked extensively with Foole, releasing his work as small-edition CD-R's on the Child of Microtones label. Valentine and his MV/EE partner Erika Elder also play on the 2xCD Kissing the Contemporary Bliss, the second Foole release on Microtones to get reissued by Family Vineyard, following last year's Daze on the Mount. Though In Quest of Tense was completely solo, Foole's projects are often collaborative. He's played with a diverse array of musicians since the early 1980s, when his group, the Din, consisted of post-punk pioneers Mission of Burma. The Din has since counted among its ranks Thurston Moore, Chris Corsano, J Mascis, and members of Pelt and Sunburned Hand of the Man. On Kissing..., Foole incorporates Valentine and Elder's contributions smartly, and you can hear their signature string plucks, note loops, and kitchen-sink rumble, all bubbling inside Foole's improvised tunes. Still, no one familiar with Foole's work would have trouble identifying this album as his. The first track, ""Dog Star Waltz"", establishes his trademark tone immediately: Over a scraggly collection of sliding strums, Foole chants and raps impulsively, forging coherence from what at first feels like random, unsynchronized elements. A few tracks do resemble written songs, such as the spacey ""Above Ground Friend"" or the aching ""Once I Was Not"", which sounds oddly like a fried, backwoods version of Joy Division. But most of Kissing... marks the farthest Foole has ever ventured musically, from the squawking bird-call of ""Jungle Nigh High"" to weird tone-poem covers of Bob Dylan and Robert Johnson. The latter-- a fired-up take on ""Stones in My Passway""-- even re-imagines the King of the Delta Blues as a noise artist, like Prurient with an acoustic guitar. Indeed, as fascinating as these 16 songs are, their relation to traditional folk is more one of spirit and instrumentation than actual sound. Much of Foole's approach is unstructured and anti-melodic, and his singing is unfettered by notions of pitch, much the way Jandek expresses raw emotions through off-key exploration. So anyone just now approaching the avant-folk pool might want to dip their toes in something closer to the surface. But if the far reaches of experimental folk-- the truly Weird America-- keep pushing forward, Kissing the Contemporary Bliss could provide a blueprint, much the way In Quest of Tense did 14 years ago.","The second Child of Microtones release to be reissued on Family Vineyard, this record by the New Weird America pioneer features contributions from Matt Valentine of Tower Recordings and his MV/EE partner Erika Elder.

Cheekbone Hollows,The Childballads,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2cabf31b7dc7155c64/1:1/w_160/cd2a7146.jpg,2008-07-31 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12037-cheekbone-hollows/,Gypsy Eyes,"Jonathan FireEater were well-educated children of privilege playing would-be NYC rock'n'roll stars, sort of like the Strokes of their time, minus the payoff. Not long after a huge record company advance resulted in the bust that was the largely unproven band's Wolf Songs for Lambs, the group went belly-up. Several Jonathan FireEater members went on to form the Walkmen. Singer Stewart Lupton, whose drug use allegedly played a big role in the group's dissolution, went nowhere, dropping out of sight supposedly to continue his poetry studies. The Walkmen turned out OK, and now Lupton makes a belated return as well with the Childballads. Certainly time away has served to deflate expectations, assuming any residual goodwill or excitement still existed. Further, if Jonathan Fire*Eater specialized in over-blown, dramatic garage rock, the Childballads thankfully tone things down considerably on their debut EP Cheekbone Hollows. Here the biggest touchstone is shambling old school rock'n'roll á la the Rolling Stones or even Bob Dylan at his shaggiest. The last thing the world needed was more music in this vein, which even if done well frequently comes off frustratingly redundant. Unfortunately, Lupton and the Childballads don't make much of a case for their short slab of more of the same. In its defense, Cheekbone Hollows is just a six-song EP, more a modest sounding board than some grand statement (though perhaps Lupton would beg to differ, given the poetic bent of the lyrics, nonetheless often distractingly slurred and distorted with a bullet mic effect). What's missing is a sense of excitement, or even a worthy vector for Lupton's submerged words. The shuffling music, mostly acoustic-based if not always strictly acoustic, sounds like a product of a casual guitar-circle get-together, steeped as it is in tried and tested riffs and familiar strums. ""They Hunt Us We Run"" and ""Blackbird Trax"" are variations on the same waltz-like theme, and if the self-conscious sloppiness of ""Old Man October"" and ""Laughter from the Rafters"" (which cops ""Beast of Burden"") has its charm, the casual approach robs the songs of any edge or intrigue-- the music's so laid-back it's practically flat. There is potential here: Some projects arrive DOA and others arrive simply not all quite there. The Childballads fall into the second camp, and minus the almost narcotic aesthetic affectations, Lupton could still very well engage the band into gear rather than simply grind well-trod ideas further into the ground. But if you're going to come back from nowhere, it'd help to have something that even hints you're going somewhere, and Cheekbone Hollows isn't it.","Stewart Lupton, formerly of Jonathan Fire*Eater-- whose members went on to form the Walkmen-- returns from nowheresville (well, studying poetry) to take another shot at indie rock success.

I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too,Martha Wainwright,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc275e6ef95969322da2/1:1/w_160/bf485974.jpg,2008-07-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12034-i-know-youre-married-but-ive-got-feelings-too/,ZoeZoe,"At the structural level, Martha Wainwright's compositions are not necessarily remarkable. She favors melodic, arty, periodically driving mid-tempo piano rock that shares obvious stylistic kinship with the likes of Tori Amos and Kate Bush. As the daughter of famed folk songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, her lyrics perhaps predictably reflect a lifestyle of tweedy-bohemian cultural privilege, laden with references to farmhouses, Captain Beefheart, and the BBC, and frequently seeming to chronicle relationships with-- surprise-- other artists and songwriters. Almost the entire thrill of Wainwright's music is tied up in her vocal performance, which of course is something that's been said at times about Amos and Bush as well. The second best thing about I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too may be its title, but the absolute best is the way Wainwright attacks so many of these songs, transforming lyrics that might otherwise be faintly ridiculous into vital testaments, taking music that's mostly MOR and wringing from it a startling wealth of shiver-inducing moments. Wainwright has no boundaries and no shame when it comes to her delivery, and hence it's inevitable some listeners will find her squeals and moans and unusual phrasing unbearably florid and perhaps even comical. Yet the popularity of a guy like Antony Hegarty suggests many of you don't always demand plainspoken grit from your singers, so hopefully you too can be mesmerized by how Wainwright adds druggy, Lethe-like connotations to her pronunciation of the word ""river"" on the operatic, austere ""Niger River"", or the teasing way she stretches words on ""Jesus and Mary"", giving us something that sounds like ""I'll keep you a-round-ha-hownd/ This dirty old town-ha-hown."" Even bigger chills come when the music's intensity actually matches Wainwright's. ""You Cheated Me"" carries a tightly spring-loaded chorus that belies her musical debt to Fleetwood Mac, and Wainwright is every bit its match, cramming her lines with all the filigrees and exhortations they can hold. ""Comin' Tonight"" is messier and even better, Wainwright bleating, ""I could steal a melody"" with open-throated abandon before descending into such incomprehensible emoting that it's clear melody is actually the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, understanding or even making out the words on Wainwright's best songs is largely ancillary-- this kind of concentrated, spine-tingling fervor doesn't really require context. Wainwright does lean pretty heavily on this formula of mild, occasionally rocky folk-pop doused with generous measures of vocal swooping and diving. And admittedly it can be somewhat wearying to try and consume the record in one sitting, especially by the time you get to the wailing ""So Many Friends"" or the arch, gothic ""In the Middle of the Night"". The album's arrangements do go a long way towards mitigating this exhaustion-- in the case of an artist like Wainwright, ""tasteful"" need not be a pejorative, not when the dusty drum rolls and taut guitar thrum of ""Hearts Club Band"" offer their own kind of drama, bereft of histrionics for a change. Of course, histrionics remain Wainwright's bread and butter, and they don't come much more cathartic and hair-raising than the unexpected dam bursts of ""Jimi"". The verses tease our ghoulish interest with their passing reference to Wainwright's famous dad, but it's the straightforward simplicity of the chorus that really compels, as Wainwright bears down and rides the music's rising squall to declaim, ""It takes up so much time/ And it makes up for nothing"" with a passion and purpose that seem for a moment to overwhelm even her love of precious language and vocal virtuosity.","The daughter of Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle (and sister to Rufus) continues to forge her own artistic identity, with an album of taut songs driven by her intense vocal delivery.

Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1971,The Byrds,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2213d197565213b254/1:1/w_160/f9570b53.jpg,2008-07-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12030-live-at-the-royal-albert-hall-1971/,Sundazed,"The Byrds weren't just one of the greatest and most influential bands of all time, they were several of them. There was, of course, the original folk-rock version of the Byrds, which begat the psychedelic version of the Byrds, which in turn begat the country-rock version of the Byrds, which in turn begat a hodgepodge of all those iterations before the group burned out once and for all. Each version of the Byrds likewise showcased what could generously be categorized a shifting lineup, with Roger McGuinn the sole constant up through the band's somewhat unsung end in 1973. Yet McGuinn's not the star of the lineup captured on Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1971, the masters of which the singer recently found sitting in his archives. Rather, the focal point is former bluegrass prodigy turned rocker Clarence White, whose short-lived career ended around the same time the Byrds did, when he was struck and killed by a drunk driver while loading gear. White got his start in the Kentucky Colonels, crossing paths with the Byrds several times before McGuinn eventually invited him to join in 1968 as a permanent member. His virtuoso solos and interplay with McGuinn are what kept the band interesting, especially in its later years and particularly for a band never renown for its live prowess. Albert Hall 1971 isn't the Byrds' only live album-- portions of 1970's (Untitled) were recorded live, and 2000 saw the release of Live at the Fillmore - February 1969. By this point the band's flame was growing dimmer, its focus diffuse, and you can hear the roots of the nascent jam-band movement as the songs' melodies give way to relatively aimless noodling. Just listen to how Bob Dylan's ""My Back Pages"" is given a rushed and busy reading en route to a rendition of Jimmy Reed's ""Baby, What You Want Me to Do"" which recalls what the Grateful Dead (also frequently drawn to Reed) was up to on its parallel folk-rock route. A few of the Byrds' better known songs are well represented, but renditions of ""So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star"" and ""Mr. Spacemen"" are loose and hardly definitive. The setlist is also distractingly schizophrenic, veering from the likes of ""Lover of the Bayou"" to Dylan's laid-back ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" with little in the way of segue. Singing lead on a handful of songs, such as Jackson Browne's ""Jamaica, Say You Will"", White offers a vocal counterpart to McGuinn, but the harmonies from the band's heyday are largely nowhere to be found. The a cappella ""Amazing Grace"" that closes the set is a far cry from the McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman frontline that helped make the band famous. But then there's the guitar. McGuinn and White tear it up on cuts like ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" and ""Lover of the Bayou"". ""There are so many songs we'd all like to hear, and there are so many songs we'd like to do for you, but there's only a little bit of time,"" apologizes McGuinn before someone requests ""Nashville West"". ""You want to play that one, Clarence?"" he asks, before letting White off his leash. Even acoustic, the pair shines. The traditional ""Black Mountain Rag/Soldier's Joy"" includes two of the disc's best minutes, easing into a 12-string free ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", Woody Guthrie's ""Pretty Boy Floyd"", and Leadbelly's ""Take a Whiff (On Me)"", tracks that showcase McGuinn and White sans clunky rhythm section. Indeed, the two later lead a radically reworked ""Eight Miles High"" past the 18-minute mark, but that also includes a lengthy interlude featuring the plodding bassist Skip Battin and drummer Gene Parsons who, frankly, drag down the John Coltrane-inspired epic (the liners note the section was mostly inserted to give McGuinn and White a cigarette break). It's partly their fault that Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1971 never quite reaches the heights McGuinn and White aim for, but it's also clear, instrumental aptitude or not, that the Byrds had moved beyond the logical end of its creative road. Listening to this set, it's easy to imagine the band deciding to tour forever, like the Dead did, existing for fleeting moments of ephemeral glory while memories of its better days faded away. But that was not to be, and in retrospect, with fine but hardly earth-shattering documents such as this one as proxy witness, pulling the plug was probably for the best.","Roger McGuinn discovers a long-forgotten soundboard of the Byrds' last true live lineup sitting in his garage, sharing the flashback to a time when the band was on its way down while virtuoso guitarist Clarence White was on his way up.

Meanderthal,Torche,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc15c0084474cd0c29ea/1:1/w_160/ded7fcdf.jpg,2008-07-31 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12020-meanderthal/,Hydra Head,"After establishing themselves as fine purveyors of metallic sludge over the course of an album and an EP, Torche's second full-length, Meanderthal, refines their penchant for volume and proves that there's more in their bag of tricks than Melvins-like metal. The record kicks off at a breakneck pace with a half-dozen tar-thick tracks. The fleet-fingered math of ""Triumph of Venus"" gives way to the triumphant bombast of ""Grenades"", a track that's barely finished before ""Pirhaña""'s stop/start stomp kicks into gear. Through these six songs-- including ""Sandstorm"", ""Speed of the Nail"", and ""Healer""-- nothing necessarily feels out of the ordinary when compared to what Torche have done in the past. The hard left turn-- and perhaps the breaking point with ""true"" metal dudes-- comes with ""Across the Shields"", a tune that could find a nice home on modern rock radio. Musically, the group finds a comfortable middle ground between their speed trials and more turgid pace, allowing Steve Brooks' militant holler-- usually more reminiscent of Helmet's Page Hamilton-- to take on a melodic bent that could bring to mind anyone from Dave Grohl to Jawbox's J. Robbins. There's even an honest-to-goodness hook: ""I am your armor,"" Brooks sings as the guitars descend. The moment stands out due to producer (and Converge guitarist) Kurt Ballou; the crisp sheen he lends to Torche's sound makes everything stand out and shimmer. Torche follow that breakthrough with a second half that contains a quick and clean 30-second instrumental (""Little Champion""), more catchy hit-and-run slabs (""Sundown"", ""Without a Sound""), and a thunderous one-two punch (""Amnesian"", ""Meanderthal"") to finish an album that shows Torche spreading their wings and exploring new territory while still creating their heaviest music yet. It's a fitting send-off to an absolutely killer rock record-- one that's likely to appeal to listeners into any stripe of heavy music from the past 20 years.","Shifting between dense, sludge-rock epics and upbeat, melodic moments that could fit into modern rock radio playlists, Miami stoner-rockers Torche spread their wings and explore new territory while still creating their heaviest music yet.

Pretty Loud,MouseRocket,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc25abf31b7dc7155c56/1:1/w_160/6b64945f.jpg,2008-07-30 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12032-pretty-loud/,Tic Tac Totally,"In some ways, Memphis has never gotten over garage rock. Largely left to their own devices by an industry that had little use for the city after the 1970s, generations of local musicians have been rethinking, reformulating, and in some cases re-creating that 60s sound and attitude. Following the Grifters, Simple Ones, and Oblivians in the early 1990s, the members of MouseRocket have mined these influences for more than a decade in numerous outfits: Alicja Trout in Lost Sounds (with Jay Reatard), the River City Tan Lines, and Black Sunday; Robby Grant in Big Ass Truck and Vending Machine; and cellist Jonathan Kirkscey in, um, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. In 2004, with rhythm section Hermant Gupta and Robert Barnett, they released a self-titled debut full of dirty guitars, distorted vocals, raunchy organs, and covers of Love and the Nightcrawlers. Gloriously dark and weird, MouseRocket sounds like a one-off, but it wasn't. Four years later, the band has launched its follow-up, Pretty Loud, which they recorded locally over two years and are releasing exclusively on vinyl (the LP includes an afterthought CD, but it sounds significantly better on a turntable). It's a swifter- and cleaner-sounding record, less distracted by all the noisy interludes, spoken-word samples, and studio shenanigans that gave the debut its oddball flair. In a word, Pretty Loud sounds professional: a concerted effort by a real live band rather than just a bunch of friends screwing around in the studio. Both approaches have their merits, of course, and opener ""All Been Broken"" immediately lays out the virtues of this new attack. Beginning with Grant's low vocals over Kirkscey's elegant cello, the song crescendos into a heavy riff that sounds like the fossilized skeleton of a Dinosaur Jr song. MouseRocket have carefully arranged the song for maximum impact, ratcheting up the soft-loud dynamics until everything falls into place on the last chorus, which smacks you squarely in the jaw. MouseRocket reshuffle the garage rock deck effectively, adding classic-rock guitars, punk vocals, new wave keys, prog drums, and Kirkscey's dexterous cello, which reinforces Grant and Trout's brazen riffs, bolsters Gupta's booming bass, and generally adds a distinctive texture to these songs. A curiously calm, nearly Byrdsian guitar theme opens ""Never Stand a Chance"", which builds over three minutes to an ear-splitting freak-out finale. Trout and Grant trade off vocals, each proving a commanding frontperson: He gives ""All Been Broken"" and ""44 Times"" a world weariness that contrasts nicely with the songs' frantic energy, and she alternates between sing-songy vocals on the country-pop ""Set on You"" and shouted attacks of the glam-metal ""Shadows"", whose abrupt, punchy chorus is one of the album's best moments. The album flags toward the end. Following a buzzy cover of Steven Calhoun's ""Fall Down South"", ""Steal"" deconstructs itself aimlessly, barely holding together, and the start-stop momentum of ""Aphrodite"" is more stop than start. They're followed by an ""electro"" version of the MouseRocket closer ""Missing Teeth"", whose paranoid lyrics about fluoridated water are illustrated with muted beeps and clicks that cannot improve on the original. Sequenced together, they close a strong album weakly, which is especially a shame considering that most of Pretty Loud manages to put a distinctive stamp on familiar styles. Most bands never get around to doing that, but MouseRocket have done it twice already.","Four years after its self-titled debut, this collective-- which features members of Memphis' garage-rock community-- creates a swifter, cleaner-sounding record than its predecessor.

Es Tiempo,Allá,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf313d197565213b1e1/1:1/w_160/db21593d.jpg,2008-07-30 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11991-es-tiempo/,Crammed DiscsCrammed Discs,"The number of Spanish speakers in the United States hovers somewhere around 35 million, making the U.S. the fifth largest Spanish speaking country in the world. Of that group, roughly 28 million Spanish-speaking Americans are of Mexican descent, and that includes around a million people in Chicago alone (two-thirds of whom were actually born in Mexico). That leaves the Windy City the second largest Mexican immigrant community in the United States, after Los Angeles. Which is all to say, when the inevitable Spanish language indie big bang happens, it's as likely to begin in Chicago as just about anywhere else in America. Sure, right now the cool kids may prefer their exotica in French, Portuguese, or Swedish-accented English, but demographically speaking, more and more of those future cool kids will be Spanish/English bilingual, at least, and the music they listen to will likely reflect that. It's practically a statistical certainty, especially once you factor in Mexico's own ongoing alt-rock and indie explosion. That's where Chicago's Allá steps in. Brothers Angel and Jorge Ledezma cram countless fresh ideas and stylistic conflations into each track of Es Tiempo, Allá's debut, and without the usual distractions or whimsy. Singer Lupe Martinez's gorgeous oohs and ahhs are overdubbed into a wall of breezy coos. The loping rhythm of ""Tu Vida"" is rococo yet subtle, the drum breaks and scratching for once relegated to the background instead of shoved in your face. Several songs-- like ""Solo un Milagro"", ""Una Dia Otra Noche"" (with its sprightly strings), and ""Sigue Tu Corazon""-- ride Latin rhythms but never lean on them like a crutch. ""El Movimiento"" is funk-laden shoegaze. The title track is a lovely, dreamy cloud with a vague allegiance to trance-inducing krautrock drone. And as if the music weren't great enough, the backstory's a winner, too: Jorge, then playing with brother Angel in the band Defender, threw himself into his day job and moved in with his parents, all in an effort to save up the cash to bring the music in his mind to life. Seven years and reportedly $40,000 later, Es Tiempo is it, and the investment of both time and money may explain why the results sound so self-assured. Steeped as it is in pop, jazz, mild psych, and post-rock in equal measure, the group comes off a little like a south of the border Stereolab. Granted, Stereolab's already got more than a little Mexico in it (R.I.P. Esquivel), and anyway, such comparisons, while perhaps initially useful as an entree, remain superficial at best. The nicest thing about Es Tiempo is the way it not only recalls disparate cool touchstones without ripping them off, but also avoids the sorts of crass pitfalls and clichés that could have sunk the project. Indeed, Allá's ambitions are such that one suspects (and hopes) more acts will follow in the cross-border path-- both geographical and metaphoric-- that this band is blazing.","Singing in Spanish and touching on pop, jazz, mild psych, and post-rock in equal measure, Allá come across as a meeting of a Mexican-American Stereolab and Os Mutantes.

Into the Trees,Sybris,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc28ea9e61561daa73f5/1:1/w_160/c4bba27d.jpg,2008-07-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12035-into-the-trees/,Absolutely Kosher,"Sybris' self-titled debut encompassed the whisper-to-a-scream dynamics of grunge, the scorched yet melodic chug of pop-metal, the cosmically inclined grandeur of 1990s shoegaze, and the hazy romantic recrimination of pre-millennial alternative music in general. Their second album, Into the Trees, suggests that they've no intention of changing course. They seem to exist in a bubble, suspended in the moment between Nirvana and electronica; the effect is sharpened because this band (so evocative of the thin yet distinct seam between indie and mainstream that prevailed until widespread consumer internet blurred it) seems so ambivalent about the 90s music of their native Chicago-- no free-jazzy squalls, post-rocky metrical shenanigans, or improv aesthetics contaminate their loping indie rock. This isolation makes them seem benignly reactionary-- at a time when a new genre is minted every day, Sybris remain charmingly retrograde. Into the Trees begins with a bit of a red herring that exemplifies by contrast how staunchly monolithic the album proper is, a refreshing approach in an era of rampant dilettantism. """"The Beach...(Intro)"", just shy of a minute, finds Angela Mullenhour's ten-story voice reduced to a long-distance croak, as a fatigued beat and an indifferently recorded guitar jangle shrug out a melody. You might wonder if Sybris have become jaded and feel alarmed because jadedness would be anathema to their music. But these doubts are dispelled when the shaggy beat and cooing guitar leads of ""Oh Man!"" plow in, a track that suggests Yeah Yeah Yeahs at their most *Show Your Bones-*y accessible. It's also one of the catchiest, sweetest-sounding songs to ever feature lyrics like, ""Where'd you get those drugs, from a pusher?/ Where'd you get that pussy, from a hooker?"" Lines like these-- not to mention the tautological ""hot metal's hot when you touch it""-- seem apt for a band that revels in the thrillingly obvious. Sometimes, drummer Eric Mahle unobtrusively backlights Phil Naumann's sparkling guitar. At others-- e.g. ""Safety City"" and ""Something About a Darkhorse or Whatever""-- he's much more cunning, picking out patterns that kind of metastasize outward, and you realize that each of these songs had the potential to slant catchy or crafty, pretty much at Mahle's discretion. A nice balance of both keeps the album moving-- catchy ones like ""Oh Man!"" hit hardest at first, but the craftier ones have longer legs. At its most compelling, Mahle's cascading interplay with Naumann's leads recalls the starry spirals of Life Without Buildings' Will Bradley and Robert Johnston. Still, Mullenhour's voice, an instrument capable of spanning the range between campfire intimacy and inferno force in the space of a single line, can't help but hog the spotlight. Throughout the cosmetic variations-- ""Burnout Babies"" has a jagged quality, ""Hurt Hawk"" is a folky drift, ""St. Veronica"" swings a bit-- the moments that stick with you most are the steamrolling upsweeps, where the guitar figures corkscrew down the neck, drum rolls pushing them along, as Mullenhour's voice opens up into a shuddering howl.","Chicago band seems to exist in a bubble, suspended in the moment between 1990s grunge and electronica, but its out-of-time quality proves to be an asset.

Estacion Proxima: Esperanza / Radio Bemba Sound System,Manu Chao,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc29eb335119a49ecbcc/1:1/w_160/7047e300.jpg,2008-07-30 05:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12036-estacion-proxima-esperanza-radio-bemba-sound-system/,Nacional,"Reading the news section on Manu Chao's website, you have to wonder whether you're looking at an artist's updates or some sort of multi-lingual, alternate reality CNN ticker. In between items about tour and festival dates, written in a mix of French, Spanish, Italian, German, and English, there are updates on the Saharawi independence movement in Western Sahara, Colombia's FARC rebels, and other causes and interests of the singer. This is only fitting for a musician who makes left-wing politics the lyrical centerpiece of his relentlessly globalist music and happens to be good friends with the Zapatistas' Subcomandante Marcos. Chao is a superstar in Europe and Latin America but hasn't quite connected in the U.S., a country where his politics can seem fringy even to the left. But leaving aside his ideological drive and tendency to sing in up to seven languages on his albums (English among them), his music has a melting-pot logic to it that actually seems quite well-suited to a diverse society like ours. It's easy to look at his history, compare it to where he is now, and conclude that Chao was destined to become a musician without borders-- he was born in France to a Galician father and Basque mother who were living in exile from Franco's Spain, which made him a dual minority in his ancestral homeland and part of an immigrant family in the country of his birth. Chao spent more than a decade playing in punk-influenced rock bands, including Los Carayos and Mano Negra, the latter of which punched his ticket to notoriety with its strange tours of South America by boat and train. In the late 90s, Mano Negra split up and Chao recruited musicians from Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina into his new band, Radio Bemba Sound System, which he named partly for the word of mouth communication system favored by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara during their revolutionary campaign in Cuba (radio bemba is a Cuban colloquialism akin to rumor mill, bemba meaning lip). He recorded his first solo album, 1998's Clandestino, with this loosely assembled band. His current label, Nacional, perhaps looking toward the wider exposure Chao gained in the U.S. with last year's La Radiolina, has now reissued Chao's second and third albums, Proxima Estacion: Esperanza and the live album Radio Bemba Sound System. Esperanza, whose title translates to Next Station: Hope, a reference to a stop on the Madrid transit system, has a unique feel, flowing like a blocks-long street party through 17 varied tracks. By the time of the album, Chao had moved mostly away from his punk musical roots in favor of a sound that incorporated elements of Spanish and Latin American folk, reggae, African rhythm, and hip-hop, as well as samples of crowds, radio broadcasts, and individual voices. The album is not quite the masterpiece it is occasionally framed as (it was huge in parts of Europe, where just after it came out you couldn't escape the image of its cover), but it is a very good, cohesive, and internally consistent record that functions as a continuous suite. Chao's adenoidal voice is not spectacular, but it ably delivers his multi-lingual message of universal justice and equality, and helps him keep his melodies simple and straightforward. Many tracks are brief, textural excursions that serve as connective tissue between more fully developed songs. The way the Cuban-style horns rise on ""Eldorado"" is reminiscent of a car driving by with the windows open and the stereo up, ""Papito"" is a nearly unclassifiable mix of ska, Roma brass, circus music, New Orleans street funeral, and European pop, while closer ""Infinita Tristeza"" is an urban soundscape, casting somber acoustic guitar and organ into a sea of voices speaking different languages. Reggae beats figure prominently, mixing with surf guitar on ""Me Gustas Tu"", and subtly buoying the sonar-ish lead guitar on ""Homens"". Radio Bemba Sound System captures a 2001 live performance featuring songs from Esperanza, Clandestino, and the albums of Mano Negra. The recording, a blend of two performances, never lets up, packing all or part of 29 songs into an hour, and I think it captures the inclusive spirit of Chao's music even better than his studio work. The cheers at the end of ""Bienvenida a Tijuana""-- when the final line offers a ringing endorsement of sex and marijuana-- are amazing, and the transformation of punky Mano Negra songs such as ""Peligro"", ""The Monkey"", ""Mala Vida"", and ""Machine Gun"" into multi-genred beasts is something to hear. ""Machine Gun"", for instance, begins as slow reggae, kicks up to a quick ska gear and ends as a blazing punk song. Chao's 10-piece band is extremely versatile, augmenting a standard rock set-up with horns, accordion, and extra percussion. They leap from reggae to funky merengue to punk to flamenco with flourishes of surf, blues, North African rai, Central African rumba, mariachi, and rock'n'roll while also switching languages, sometimes in mid-song. Esperanza's subdued reggae track ""Mr. Bobby"" is much funkier live, with a great psychedelic guitar solo and second, dancehall-ish vocal from Bidji. Because it samples two shows, a few songs appear twice but that feels like an appropriate side effect of the collage approach. My biggest complaint is the way the sound obviously cuts back and forth between recordings-- the fades on the crowd noise can be very abrupt and even distracting. Each reissue appends a bit of bonus video content, which is plenty worth watching, but there are no audio extras. Essentially, this is a chance for Americans who missed out on these records the first time to hear one of the world's most popular musicians. They're definitely worth the investment for anyone who loves popular music that blurs the lines between cultures and sounds.",,7.7,
London Zoo,The Bug,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfe13d197565213b1f9/1:1/w_160/07df1190.jpg,2008-07-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12000-london-zoo/,Ninja Tune,"Kevin Martin, under a dozen-or-so aliases and across numerous genres, has been screwing around with deep bass for well over a decade. 1997's Tapping the Conversation-- a concept album conceived as a surrogate soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation-- was his first release as the Bug, and in retrospect, it sounds like an alternate-universe prototype of dubstep, based on instrumental hip-hop rather than UK garage rhythms. By the time he issued his 2003 follow-up Pressure, he'd already charged headlong into heavy digital ragga, building a repertoire of grimy, distorted beats that mutated dancehall into a glitchy, blown-out commotion. Martin's latest Bug album, London Zoo, is very much in keeping with that permutation, which stands out amidst the recent wave of dubstep in a way that makes Burial's Untrue sound like Music for Airports. But it also takes the Bug's work into a somewhat cleaner, less abrasive area-- it streamlines the sound, shaves away the distortion, and draws most of its impact from the rhythms themselves. Of course, ""less abrasive"" doesn't necessarily mean it hit any less hard: Martin knows how and when to drop a heavy beat directly on top of you, and there's a carefully crafted tension throughout this record, no matter how sparse or dense that beat actually is. Sparseness and density tend to work in tandem on London Zoo's strongest tracks: Bass hits at machine-gun intervals, leaving deep, tube-station echoes disintegrating in its wake and giving a number of these tracks a simultaneous sensation of freeness and claustrophobia. Reverberating, distorted voices and spare synth melodies close in on you even as they recede into the distance, and the rhythms are so pervasive and locked in that after a while you start hearing the spaces in between as much as you're hearing the beats themselves. Martin has also enlisted an army of top-notch singers and toasters for the record, ranging from dancehall veterans like Tippa Irie to Burial and Kode9 collaborator Spaceape. However, three names in particular stand out. First, there's Roll Deep member Flowdan, whose grumbling, elastic baritone contributions to the chaingun-rhythm ""Jah War"" (heard on the fantastic 2006 Planet Mu comp Mary Anne Hobbs Presents the Warrior Dubz) and last year's sinster, headknock single ""Skeng"" show up again here. Flowdan is also at the center of the manic ""Warning"", which features one of the album's best hooks and a hell of a rampaging performance; there's one cool bit about halfway through where he ratchets the intensity in his voice down to a conversational rumble to match a moment in the song where the bass draws back, then resumes shouting right when it drops back in. Singer/toaster Ricky Ranking shows up on three tracks as well, and his vocal range-- switching from sweet melodies to foreboding chants-- is impressive, even if he's best suited to the slower numbers (especially the dirgelike closer ""Judgement""). And the two appearances from Warrior Queen are knockouts: ""Poison Dart"", originally released as a single last year, is ruffneck feminism (""Though me na sling no gun, a boy think sey me soft/ But me a real poison dart"") delivered with a sharp, wailing sneer over more low end than most MCs could contend with, and ""Insane"", which augments a chirpier, more buoyant flow with a smoothly-sung chorus and a few out-there adlibs, including a funny little riff on Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"". The only caveat concerning London Zoo is how far it might skew away from your traditional notions of dancehall-- and even then, it helps to recognize that, if anything, this record is another manifestation of how London has transformed the sounds of Jamaica to its own ends, from 2-tone to jungle to dubstep. It's a tense record, sure, but that tension is palpable in a crossover-friendly way, invoking Babylon and fire while avoiding the more problematic aspects of ""slack"" lyrics. It's angry and ferocious, but always triumphant: When it threatens to bust out your windows and rip holes in your speakers, it crackles with the kind of force that makes you want to punch the air as hard as your subwoofers do.","London-based producer the Bug knows bass, and on London Zoo, it hits at machine-gun intervals, leaving deep, tube-station echoes disintegrating in its wake.

Liars and Prayers,Thalia Zedek Band,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1113d197565213b22e/1:1/w_160/fa9ba148.jpg,2008-07-29 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12017-liars-and-prayers/,Thrill Jockey,"Dinosaur Jr. reunions, Sebadoh reissues, Evan Dando acoustic tours-- the present-day indie-rock marketplace is rife with reminders of the crucial role Massachusetts bands played in defining the late-1980s/early-90s alt-rock era. However, the reemergence of Boston-based Thalia Zedek-- who, in her two-decade career, has shared stages and/or collaborated with all those mentioned above-- does not trigger the same feelings of nostalgia that greet her recently resurrected peers. And it's not just because she never enjoyed the same, fleeting bouts of MTV-abetted crossover success, but also because her music-- most notably, with underrated 90s blues-punk grinders Come-- was too stridently unsentimental to soundtrack any wool-toqued teen's brand new love. Rather, Zedek's songs documented a struggle to avoid sinking into the same ol' shit: lies, betrayals, and redemption that never comes. In the wake of Come's turn-of-the-decade dissolution, Zedek's first three solo albums-- 2001's Been Here and Gone, 2002's You're a Big Girl Now and 2004's Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch Of Madness-- retained her former band's drifty, open-ended approach to composition, but greatly tempered their scabrous, twin-guitar attack into a more subdued guitar/viola/drums trio set-up (a la The Dirty Three) to better illuminate the wistfulness that always underpinned her dirty-ashtray voice. But after years of stripping-down, Zedek is ready to power up again, her latest album appending the word ""Band"" to her name and supplementing her usual cast of David Curry (viola) and Daniel Coughlin (drums) with bassist Winston Braman and, most crucially, pianist Mel Lederman. Liars and Prayers' hefty seven-minute opener ""Next Exit"" provides an instant compare/contrast between Zedek's old and new aesthetics, the band providing an ominously quiet, instrumental preview of the song's verse/chorus cycle, before crashing in at the 80-second mark in full, stormy Bad Seeds swing and setting the stage for Zedek's black-cloud lyrics (allegedly inspired, like the album title, by life during Dubya's wartime, following in the tradition of Come's oblique Clinton-era critique Don't Ask, Don't Tell). However, the newly acquired ""Band"" mantle reflects not just the weightier sound, but also Zedek's generosity of spirit: Liars and Prayers is Zedek's heaviest, most tumultuous album since her Come tenure, but she rarely leans on her guitar for cathartic effect, instead summoning Curry's dissonant string swirls, Lederman's forceful keystrokes, and her bolstered rhythm section to drive set-pieces like ""Do You Remember"" and ""Body Memory"" into torrential mid-song jams that break down and cohere at just the right moments. The band can't always make epics out of Zedek's matter-of-fact narratives-- ""Wind"" is interspersed with foreboding builds that don't quite jibe with the song's cowpoke pace and placid, pastoral imagery-- but like her old friend J Mascis, Zedek's sand-papered vocal cords can make plainspoken, seemingly throwaway lines sound deeply affecting: when she cries, ""And I know that I tried to call you/ But it was very haaaaarrrrd,"" (""Do You Remember"") you can practically see her in some rain-beaten phone booth, scrambling for a spare quarter. But there's also the growing sense on Liars and Prayers that Zedek is getting tired of apologizing for past mistakes, and it's only a matter of time before resignation turns to rage: on the searing closer ""Begin to Exhume"", Zedek's contorted guitar screech and raspy wail assume complete control-- tellingly, she sounds most alive when railing against the Iraq war's wasted dead-- before her last spiteful words stop the song on a dime just shy of the six-minute mark. Liars and Prayers' success is owed as much to the band as its leader, but in the end, there's still no doubt about who's working on whose watch.","Former frontwoman of underrated 90s blues-punk grinders Come returns with her fourth solo album, in which dark, politically-inspired songs of betrayal and loss are delivered in her distinctive dirty-ashtray voice.

Big Star,Haley Bonar,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9213d197565213b102/1:1/w_160/525979af.jpg,2008-07-29 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11914-big-star/,Afternoon,"The title Big Star comes with pushcarts of baggage. In the early 1970s, the Memphis cult band took the name from a regional grocery store chain before creating records completely out of proportion with the inkling of stardom they actually achieved. Since then, so many acts-- the Replacements, Matthew Sweet, the Posies, et al.-- have played up the romance of Big Star-level obscurity that it's easy to miss that reference on Haley Bonar's fourth album, as she seems to take few musical cues from Alex Chilton or Chris Bell. She's much more folksy than pop, although Big Star sounds catchier and fuller than any of her previous albums. It's unclear whether she intends that title to carry a kernel of irony or if it's just a shrug and whatever. Is it a mission statement or a painful joke? Bonar (rhymes with honor) is a fairly prolific singer-songwriter originally from small-town South Dakota but now holed up in the big Twin Cities. She plays almost all of the instruments on Big Star herself, produced the record, and sells her own hand-sewn t-shirts at live shows. More crucially, she possesses a voice that's ideal for conveying mixed emotions about romance, fame, life, what have you: On ""Arms of Harm"" and opener ""Green Eyed Boy"", she sounds freshly bruised and tender, but sings forcefully rather than quietly. Tempering that vulnerability is a natural wryness on ""Better Half"" and the country-tinged stand-out ""Highway 16"". She never sounds better than at the end of opener ""Green Eyed Boy"", singing wordlessly but emphatically as the song crashes around her. Still, Big Star sounds like a glass-half-empty album, which isn't necessarily a complaint: Her previous album, 2006's Lure the Fox, was thematically bleaker and musically sparser-- a fatal combination then. Two years later she's crafting bigger hooks and a much more intricately textured folk-rock sound that swells and fades naturally with her voice, but she still sounds pre-jaded regarding any romantic or music-industry contract, despite the upward trajectory of her career. The title track is an anti-sellout anthem, told from a girlfriend's point of view: ""Go out and get a haircut and stumble out into the morning/ They'll all hate you tomorrow when no one buys your single,"" she sings, before concluding: ""I can't make you happy, I can't make you money/ I can only fold your laundry."" But it's the chorus itself that sells the conceit of ""Big Star"": As the already spare instrumentation falls away, she projects those two words dramatically, straining just enough to convey her desperation. Her flinty skepticism keeps Big Star from slipping into post-Lilith-isms (she bears more than a passing vocal semblance to 90s folk-pop singer Shawn Colvin), but it can be a bit much to take. Rock'n'roll, she sings on ""Queen of Everything"", ""will tear you from the inside fuck with your spine, take you to the same place I lost my mind."" Which raises the question: Why's she in this racket to begin with? She answers that question in the next song, the two-stepping ""Highway 16"". Leaving a good job and a good man, she hits the road on her own: ""Hitting the highway is so sweet when it's nothing but you and your own two feet/ Who says life's weighed down to a rickety old town?"" Bonar dreams of the same elusive freedoms as everyone else.","Despite the title, this singer/songwriter takes few cues from Alex Chilton or Chris Bell; instead, on this self-produced record, she's crafting intricately textured folk-rock that swells and fades naturally with her voice.

The Mixtape About Nothing,Wale,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbceea9e61561daa7313/1:1/w_160/ede453a1.jpg,2008-07-29 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11963-the-mixtape-about-nothing/,,"""The underground just spun around and did a 360!"" When Eminem spit this rhyme in 2000 on The Marshall Mathers LP, he was, as usual, talking about himself, but I imagine the line must sound depressingly prophetic to circa-2008 underground rappers surveying the last eight years. In a strikingly short time, all of the mutually understood rules of independent rap's mid-to-late-90s golden age have been overturned, rendered obsolete by a combination of shifting critical opinion and the democratizing bulldozer of the internet, and indie-rappers have been struggling to gain footing in their bewildering new landscape ever since. Criticizing mainstream hip-hop's misogyny, violence, and materialism, for instance, once meant approving, pat-on-the-head reviews from mainstream rock publications like Rolling Stone and SPIN. These days, it is the quickest route to being derided as a self-righteous ""backpack rapper,"" a term that has soured into a reflexive sneer. In short, things just ain't the same for (non)gangstas, and any rapper who finds himself uncomfortable inventing a storied criminal past has learned to step carefully. D.C. rapper Wale (pronounced Wah-LAY, as he carefully points out early on) is all too aware of these potential pitfalls, and on his expertly crafted, exuberantly witty, and endlessly surprising new Mixtape About Nothing, he makes an art out of high-stepping lightly through a minefield. ""An iPod mind to you Walkman guys,"" he calls himself at one point, and the adeptness of the rhyme matches the neatness of the distinction. Throughout the tape, Wale displays an almost Road Runner-like ability to evade classification. ""I ain't a street nigga, but my niggas is some,"" he rhymes on ""The End Credits"", adding later, ""I'm not a Muslim; my grandmomma was one."" He likens stylistic comparisons to Lil Wayne and Lupe Fiasco to being ""locked in a box,"" lamenting, ""We apples and oranges, but everybody pair us."" The endless self-positioning might seem obsessive, but Wale instinctively understands that categorization means the death of a three-dimensional personality, and he is determined not to be easily dismissed. He has succeeded. On The Mixtape About Nothing, Wale emerges fully-formed as a rapper and as a thinker, a lightning-witted, irreverent guy blessed with both an infectious swagger and a sound moral compass-- twin gifts that enable him to accomplish some of the mixtape's most audacious feats. The central conceit, for example, might read on paper like nothing more than white-boy bait: as the title suggests, it's an album-length riff on Seinfeld that incorporates snippets of dialogue from famous episodes and features an endearingly goofy ""drop"" by Julia Louis-Dreyfuss (""Don't you think my kids are gonna think I'm so cool that I'm on this mixtape?? Mothafucka!!"") But Wale's genuine love for the show rescues the venture from drowning in cheap irony. On the disarmingly earnest love song ""The Grown Up"", after Wale confesses, ""I gotta be a man before I can become a father,"" the voices of George Constanza and Jerry weigh in like some Manhattanite take on the Greek chorus: ""We're like children! We're not men! We find all these stupid little reasons to break up with these women!"" The slyly perceptive joke-- that men of all classes and races shrink equally fearfully from the demands of adulthood-- only hints at the sort of unexpected emotional resonance Wale manages to mine from his unlikely setup. Indeed, by effortlessly flipping this source material, Wale proves that there is almost no topic he can't handle. Rapping in a blaring voice oddly reminiscent of Rich Boy, he comes across equally funny and engaging complaining about Soundscan, illegal downloads, and ""ringtone rappers"" as he does while gleefully comparing his bank account to ""brunch at a synagogue."" When he tackles trickier issues-- mainstream hip-hop's prevailing misogyny and violence, for instance-- he demonstrates an uncanny knack for seeing all sides of the argument without losing his footing. On the masterful ""The Manipulation"", he flips with frightening and instructive ease between unctuous, Common-style lover-man and the vilest Pimp C-style misogynist. ""The Kramer"", meanwhile, builds from the still-sickening audio of Michael Richards screaming racial epithets at nightclub patrons into the most thoughtful examination of the insoluble problem of the prevalence of the word ""nigga"" in rap music in years. ""A nigga write 'nigga' in his lyric/ Expects a white boy to omit it/ The white boy spit it like he spit it/ Recite it to his friends-- who by the way, ain't niggas."" The white friends ""incorporate the lyric into their everyday living,"" until a black friend eventually overhears them. He lets it slide-- ""it's so insignificant and little""-- and soon: ""The things they say went a little too far/ He couldn't tell the difference between 'a' or '-er'/ So they just kept saying 'nigga' to his face/ There's nothing he can do/ He let it get away/ It came to the point he couldn't look them in the face."" No matter Wale's tone-- sternly critical or goofy, reflective or boastful-- the coursing music maintains a joyful momentum. Most of the original beats on the tape come from the D.C. production collective Best Kept Secret, who punctuate straightforward throwback-rap tracks with rattling bongos and woodblocks borrowed from D.C.'s go-go scene. But, just to show us he can, Wale also runs circles around the Roots' ""Star"" beat, the ""Roc Boys"" instrumental, and Shawty Redd-style synthesizers alongside Lil Wayne on ""The Cliché Lil Wayne Feature"". Wale is fully aware of his potential-- ""Hip hop heads see a new day, and I is one,"" he proclaims near the end of the tape-- but he also squirms away from coronation as the next great hope, a label as constricting as any other. ""You see, kings get killed, or at least overthrown,"" he notes on ""The Vacation From Ourselves"". His ""mixtape about nothing"" is really a mixtape about almost everything, and with it Wale has produced one of the year's most improbable and inspiring successes.","D.C. rapper's ""What the..?"" concept-- an album-length riff on Seinfeld that incorporates snippets of dialogue from famous episodes and an endearingly goofy ""drop"" by Julia Louis-Dreyfuss -- surprisingly leads to a solid record filled with wit and ideas.

"I Was Raised on Matthew, Mark, Luke & Laura",PAS/CAL,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2f5e6ef95969322db1/1:1/w_160/737ec9cf.jpg,2008-07-29 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12040-i-was-raised-on-matthew-mark-luke-laura/,Le Grand Magistery,"PAS/CAL are quick to please, but they sure take their sweet time revealing the full extent of their pleasures. The Detroit septet had an indie pop hit off their very first EP, 2003's The Handbag Memoirs, with sunny, urbane ""The Bronze Beached Boys (Come on Let's Go)"" eventually soundtracking a Saturn advertisement. Two more EPs, five years, and countless delayed release dates later, PAS/CAL's full-length debut, I Was Raised on Matthew, Mark, Luke & Laura, does Electric Light Orchestra baroqueness, Of Montreal schizophrenia, and Belle & Sebastian to rival any of its short-playing predecessors. You could go out tonight, but every stitch you'd have to wear is sewn into the music's eccentric finery. The people in PAS/CAL's songs would probably prefer just to stay in, anyway. An outsider's anthem from the outset, ""Glorious Ballad of the Ignored"" starts with a false start before touting the future prospects of ""the ugly ones, made fun of,"" amid piano, strings, lush harmonies, and sophisticated time-signature changes. ""You're not pretty like so many girls are pretty,"" frontman Casimer Pascal sings on ""O My Cherry"", the third track in a three-track suite of organ-psych bridging Stereolab and the Zombies. She isn't informed or well-read, either. ""Oh, honey, we're ridiculous, like the overweight or the crippled/ Like, there are nasty names for people like us,"" Pascal acknowledges on ""O Honey We're Ridiculous"", which comes one letter short of the title of (but does not appear on) second PAS/CAL EP Oh Honey, We're Ridiculous. ""I'll go to the floor for you,"" that one concludes; these characters may stay in, but you get the feeling they at least know some good ways to spend their time there. Opener ""The Truth Behind All The Vogues She Sold"" pairs a 15-year-old girl and a pervert over intricately off-kilter piano. Probably no coincidence the next track is ""You Were Too Old for Me"", hyperactive and handclapping. ""Everyone needs someone they can pray to,"" Pascal sings, and it's not a stretch to imagine this prayer could be like Madonna's. Stripping oneself bare is ""the fashion of the season"" on ""Summer Is Almost Here"", originally released on a split 12"" with New York's La Laque. ""You're wrong and you know it/ To leave it hidden under a myriad of clothes,"" Pascal admonishes on the album's crowning, closing track, the darkly XTC-like ""Citizens Army Uniform"", originally intended-- with good reason-- as the title number (it also updates and expands upon the 2006 Dear Sir EP's appropriately wispier ""C.A.U. (Sans Muscle)""). If nerd-rock and subtle kinks don't do it, the sheer sound of I Was Raised... should. Taking seven years to make an album may be decadent, but it's a decadence intrinsic to PAS/CAL's music, executed with an attention to detail uncommon in the often-slapdash world of indie pop. You can expose your soul through your clothes, even if they hide your body; this group's raiment ranges from the whistling and scratchy guitars of ""We Made Our Way, We Amtrakked"" to the lavish orchestration of ""Dearest Bernard Levine"" or the Byrdsian jangle, ghostly male-female harmonies, and outer-space synths of the Suite Cherry suite. ""We're willing to die for/ What some people won't blink an eye for,"" Pascal sings on the opener, which could be another way of saying ""art for art's sake."" That doesn't mean the arrangements don't sometimes overwhelm the songs. But such excess is part of the songs. Overstatement becomes PAS/CAL: ""Even Christ got hung up on the early-thirties blues,"" Pascal observes near the end of the Suite Cherry suite, in one of the song's most grandiose metaphors. And then, as it is written in the book of Matthew-- or perhaps Laura: ""La la la la la la.""","After a few great EPs and a lengthy wait, the Detroit indie pop band finally issues its debut album, a well-crafted record of baroque charms that will likely receive love/hate reactions.

Top Ranking,DiploSantogold,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc30eb335119a49ecbe1/1:1/w_160/26b9eb41.jpg,2008-07-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12041-top-ranking/,Mad Decent,"A fashionable, upcoming singer with 5,012 crazy-ass bloggers for fans? Check. The opportunity to piggyback on that artist's widescreen view of music as a philosophical jumping-off point for your own dilettantish DJ inclinations? Yup. More dancehall dubplates than you've got waking minutes for? Uh huh. On paper, Diplo's second artist-centered mixtape might seem like an attempt to re-capture the lightning he bottled with the first, but to stop at that shallow assessment would be doing Top Ranking a pretty big disservice. In the end, the similarities between this collaboration and Diplo's first-- 2004's M.I.A.-trumpeting Piracy Funds Terrorism mix-- are as superficial as those between M.I.A. and Santogold themselves. For one thing, it's a different time-- not just in the year (Top Ranking comes in time for the summer's hottest months, whereas Piracy Funds Terrorism dropped in December, sparking an extended Maya-is-the-new-Santa Clause riff from an exuberant Nick Sylvester) or in each parent album's release cycle (Arular hadn't even been issued yet, whereas Santogold is months fresh), but also in music. Piracy Funds Terrorism was more than a great mix, it was also a crystallization of a lot of parallel arcs that were trending upwards at the time: the emergence and influence of the Diplo/Hollertronix/Low Budget crew, and the legitimization of mashups as promotional vehicles for new music. Top Ranking has none of those things going for it. Santogold's best songs are already in the public consciousness, Diplo and his crew are respected but hardly upstarts, and the mashup's appeal is gradually waning. If anything, by returning to this format with an artist so frequently derided as an M.I.A. knockoff, Diplo probably opened the door for lots of charged questions regarding his own aesthetics and personal politics. If he were an inveterate cool chaser, as he's often accused of being, this wouldn't be the move he'd make. A lot of those questions resolve themselves in the music. Where PFT was authoritative, electric, and undeniably of its time, Top Ranking feels less immediate, and less like an attempt to surf any one particular wave. Spanning hip-hop, reggaeton, new wave, classic rock, indie rock, club, reggae, and dubstep, it's far rangier than its predecessor. Whether that actually helps or hinders it is up for debate (the mix doesn't really get going until the second act, after an opening chapter that includes a bumpy Aretha Franklin/Devo/B-52's/Gerri & the Holograms detour), but credit Diplo with playing to his artists' tastes. Just as PFT's muscular and slightly more style-conscious tracks reflected M.I.A.'s slightly avant and beat-heavy pop, Top Ranking feels appropriately on point: It's more versatile, and digs even deeper. There's another, more obvious reason that Santogold's a smart candidate for a Diplo refix. Despite boasting strong singles like ""L.E.S. Artistes"" and ""Creator"", almost half of her debut fell flat. Under Diplo's ear, a lot of those same songs-- or at least bits of them-- get a second chance. From Diplo's mix of ""I'm a Lady"" (which features a scene-stealing bubblegum verse from Philly MC Amanda Blank) to the Radioclit remix of ""Get It Up"" (on which M.I.A. herself pops up, as if to acknowledge the mix's elephant in the room and replace it with, like, real elephant sounds), Santogold owns 12 of the mix's 35 tracks. And for the most part, hers is consistently among the best material here. Even the previous show-stoppers are re-incarnated as show-stoppers, including the pulsing, outré-sounding XXXchange mix of ""L.E.S. Artistes"", which is arguably better than the original. Despite the stretch that begins with that XXXchange mix and ends with a Ratatat/Richie Spice mashup and a phenomenal four-song dubstep/grime run during the mix's final third, Top Ranking's highs aren't nearly as immediate as PFT's. What it comparatively lacks in rapid-fire thrills, though, it makes up for in generosity. Clocking in at 75 minutes, this is a plentiful set from a DJ who's clearly got ideas and records to spare. As long as he keeps delivering mixes like these, all that other peripheral stuff should be inconsequential.","Move beyond the shallow comparisons to Diplo's 2004 M.I.A. mixtape Piracy Funds Terrorism, and the rangier Top Ranking-- spanning hip-hop, reggaeton, new wave, classic rock, indie rock, club music, reggae, and dubstep-- is more versatile, and digs even deeper.

Not Noiice,When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1ac0084474cd0c29f5/1:1/w_160/53f03aad.jpg,2008-07-28 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12023-not-noiice/,Chalk Circle,"There's a curious irony running all through the new record from When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, Not Noiice. The band's name comes from the old B-movie of the same name, but it also references the terrible, prehistoric force of the group's lumbering rock. Singers Jesse Hodges and George Dishner don't so much sing as grunt and scream their way through the record's eleven riff-laden tracks. The dead giveaway as far as the band's M.O. doesn't happen until the record's closing track: the relentlessly self-referential ""Finally Grunge"". Based on what came before, we had an idea that When Dinosaurs are a group of beer-swilling dudes who love the Melvins and other Aberdeen rednecks, but that title clinches it. That's not, however, all they're up to. Their ham-handed heavy guitar touches have firm roots in both late-1990s stoner sludge and, surprisingly, in no wave, especially on cuts like ""It's Casual"" and ""Hairvest"". But what's in a name? When Dinosaur's first record, Snacks, was all about mindless fun-- punk like the Minutemen with a slipped disc, or maybe Slint's retarded cousin. With their new album, the band seems somehow more focused. But while their song titles are fun, they seem to be playing itinerantly to genres rather than really rocking out. Not Noiice has been blessed with a title that indicates a curious and blank-slated sense of irony, but the fratty reference game played on record displays no such deft logic. Whether or not listeners get the movie reference in the band name, they certainly understand the sentiment behind the moniker, and the second word in the title Not Noiice will click as a portmanteau of Nice and Noise. Unfortunately, this sort of recognition can typify the problem with the record: it's a known quantity. While there are some great instrumental jams, some nice riffs, some mesmerizing spoken-word bits coursing through, the album is as constricted as the media on which it was pressed, spinning around itself, never really going anywhere. When Dinosaurs are at their best when they're at their most enigmatic, as on ""Big Fuck Party"" and ""Hypnotic Locks"", where they seem willing to let the interplay of their chaotic elements guide the work. There's something here that almost offhandedly threatens to be really special, so once they manage to sort out where their sludgy irony belongs and where their ecstatic sincerity can shine, they should have something that's really noiice.","Second full-length from Austin collective dabbles in sludge and grunge tropes, lacking a cohesive center but offering excitement around its rough edges.

Here We Stand,The Fratellis,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1dabf31b7dc7155c43/1:1/w_160/326518c6.jpg,2008-07-28 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12025-here-we-stand/,Island,"For such self-styled pub hooligans, Glasgow trio the Fratellis really struggle to get the breathalyzer jumpin'. Their clumsy enunciations and girl-bitten angst have earned plenty of bread, thanks largely to UK audiences' infatuation with Pete Doherty-like behavioral patterns, but the drunken rock posturing here is just a bunch of beer cans filled with Kool-Aid. The band's 2007 debut Costello Music, which can be heard by tuning your TV to practically any ad, hedged its shameless derivation with twitchy compulsion, copping seminal British rock in quick enough succession to absolve the band, at least partially. Here We Stand, a thoroughly complacent, watered-down effort, can only wish to be so lucky. The Fratellis' darkest moments are lined with a juvenile harmlessness. Apparently charges of misogyny and recklessness get thrown at these guys, but I don't see any vulgarity in occasional ""c"" words (""I'm a cynical cunt/ And I'm much too lazy to change""), especially when used in toothless Neil Diamond sound-alike ""Look Out Sunshine!"" Sure, the crosshairs stay fixed on women throughout the album, but the band's limp attempts at machismo preclude any potential male chauvinism, or catchiness. First single ""Mistress Mabel"" digs a new low for the group, its easy-to-swallow blues riffs venturing into Hootie territory and beyond. Arguably one of their most challenging love screeds, ""Jesus Stole My Baby"" derides a religious chick, though the gesture's diminished, seeing as how the band didn't wish to include the track on their U.S. release and possibly alienate pious consumers. Ultimately, though, I'd rather hear the Fratellis become better musicians than become bigger assholes. When true to their own innocuous selves, they can sound somewhat pleasant, if not charming. ""Babydoll"" doesn't dress its 1960s pop sources in bells, whistles, or alpha dog affectation, and, after a vestigial intro riff, the similarly nostalgic ""Lupe Brown"" achieves similar success. Sluggish Arctic Monkeys aping and clumsy blues swagger fill out the rest of the album, with frontman Jon Fratelli neither witty or loveably debauched enough to pull off either style. Now for the big question: Can the Fratellis really be this ignorant of their own unoriginality? On its brighter spots, Costello Music at least knew what it was doing, borrowing feverishly, but in an engaging manner. On this follow-up, they're simply grasping for straws. For example, Jon mocks the eponymous female and her genre on ""Acid Jazz Singer"", only to sound even more ridiculous doing the kind of country-blues muzak ballad reserved for chili cook-offs. Even worse, do they realize the ""She can't help it/ The girl can't help it"" intro to clunker ""Stragglers Moon"" eerily resembles the Little Richard sample from Fergie's ""Clumsy""? The Fratellis have comfortably nestled themselves among the ranks of British rock's most besotted, but even relative to their contemporaries they still manage to come off sounding bored, tired, and downright silly-- a sad feat considering they're probably not even drunk.","Glasgow band, whose 2006 debut Costello Music hit the top 5 in the UK after the song ""Flathead"" was used in an iPod commercial, is far less charming on its sophomore album.

"She's the Dutchess, He's the Duke",The Dutchess and the Duke,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0fabf31b7dc7155c23/1:1/w_160/aa0e31da.jpg,2008-07-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12015-shes-the-dutchess-hes-the-duke/,Hardly Art,"It's hard to imagine if you were born, say, after 1965, but there was a time before the elder statesmen of rock'n'roll had become parodies of themselves. Before Mick Jagger was known for fathering supermodels' babies and strutting across the stage like the world's wrinkliest peacock; before Lou Reed's dark, downtowner guise was obsessed with more dangerous pursuits than tai chi; before Bob Dylan was picking up establishment prizes like a Pulitzer and an Oscar and being impersonated by Cate Blanchett. Many will never know the thrill of hearing those artists in their original context, but the debut by Seattle duo the Dutchess & the Duke is a pretty good consolation prize. The 10-track album celebrates the time before those personalities became personas and those musical styles became canonical. The purity of spirit that Kimberly Morrison (the titular Dutchess) and Jesse Lortz (her childhood friend and Duke) bring to this spare collection of bluesy ditties makes them sound as strange and fresh as the Velvet Underground must've sounded to ears unaccustomed to their kind of menacing sexual deadpan, yet the duo injects their songs with just enough punk spirit to remind us of how raw those early records really were. But She's The Dutchess, He's The Duke is not just a walk down memory lane. It's ingredients are few-- sexy, gritty male vocals, some sweetly sung co-ed harmonies, nimbly finger-picked acousti-blues guitar, restrained (if any) percussion-- but its magic is palpable. Perhaps it's due to the intimacy of recording on an 8-track, but though every song is reminiscent of one you've heard before, they have a sense of immediacy and audible grit. It actually sounds as if you're hearing them from inside the studio as they are being taped. The vocals are recorded at such close range that they are almost tinny, and you can practically visualize Morrison and Lortz brushing their lips against the microphones as they sing. Instead of Pro Tools perfection, there is an organic grunginess to the production that comes from the voices bleeding into the guitars and the guitars, in turn, spilling into the brassy tambourines. Though ""Reservoir Park"", the album's opener, is classic Stones, with crisp handclaps punctuating the rootsy, ""Ruby Tuesday""-worthy guitar as Lortz's swaggers and moans against Morrison's naked, wistful mezzo-soprano, the album isn't entirely Glimmer Twins influenced. ""The Prisoner"" finds them taking on shades of Leonard Cohen, with Lortz allowing his libidinous vocal drone to dwell in its lowest, louchest register. Morrison's voice sounds ethereal next to her partner's earthy tones, matching the incongruously bright timbre of the hippie-ish flute accompaniment (which is, by the way, one of the only times the arrangements on the album are broader than just guitar and tambourine). On ""Back to Me"", the Dutchess & the Duke tease us with a riff on the Dylan's ""Hurricane"" chord progression, and later, on ""Mary"" with its repeated, rolling, ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" guitar line, they manage to make a Dylan homage out of a Dylan homage. Everyone is going to say that these faux royals sound timeless because they play the sounds of the past with the adventurous spirit of the future, but they'll be wrong. The Dutchess & the Duke have released a record that's calculatedly crafted to sound dated, and that makes it-- in more ways than one-- sound classic.","Every song on this Hardly Art debut may remind you of one you've heard before-- most of them recorded in the mid- to late-1960s-- but they still have a sense of immediacy and audible grit.

49:00,Paul Westerberg,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc21ea9e61561daa73de/1:1/w_160/3435fd2f.jpeg,2008-07-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12029-4900/,self-released,"On December 31, Paul Westerberg will turn 49. Now, 49's not the most famous or familiar of birthday milestones, but for a guy who once embodied the frustrations and reckless follies of youth, turning almost 50 may be milestone enough. It means Westerberg's officially old, for whatever that's worth, more likely closer to the end than to the beginning, though given Westerberg's life and career, the man may yet shock us all. Certainly 49:00, Westerberg's first album in four years, is a big surprise in and of itself. Even in this age of internet giveaways and pay-what-you-want schemes, it came as a minor bombshell when Westerberg, with no warning, dropped this home-recorded album-- which arrives as just a single long track with no song titles-- selling it for the nice stunt price of $0.49. That's a little bit more than a penny a second (the album runs a perverse 43 minutes rather than the expected 49), which may very well be what Westerberg spent to create it. The guy felt the need to get something out of his system-- and get it out fast, free from the usual fanfare, and, most importantly, free from any expectations. 49:00 feels not unlike something Westerberg might have stuck on a cassette and mailed to his best friends in lieu of a Christmas card. Say what you will about Trent Reznor's generosity, The Slip freebie still felt delivered on his rigid terms. The no-frills 49:00, on the other hand, feels downright liberated, absolutely no strings attached, other than the ones connecting Westerberg to his past. If there's anything to be learned from the Replacements' various ups and downs, it's that loose and sloppy, two ways to describe  the bash and pop of 49:00, is sometimes the right approach. Songs fade into one another like one weak radio signal on a road trip supplanted by the next as the car crosses some invisible border. Two tracks occasionally play simultaneously. Snippets of a dozen cover songs-- Beatles, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, the Partridge Family-- are squeezed into the span of a few minutes. Lyrics fade in and out of the mix, sometimes clearly, sometimes not. ""I'm going to stick around and spoil your morning."" ""It wouldn't hurt to see your grandma every now and again."" ""Everyone's stupid in our classroom, even our friends."" ""Whether you're famous or nameless, you never go dancing in the street."" ""Goodnight, sweet prince."" And of course: ""I gotta get it outta my system!"" Best of all, the melodies and sentiments Westerberg has always been able to spin out, seemingly at will, are here in full force, sometimes fragmented, sometimes implied, sometimes more fully formed, but rarely less than heartfelt. And really, that is and always has been Westerberg's greatest gift: To go beyond the context and simply connect, however casually. On 49:00, cobwebs or no, that uncanny ability has rarely been clearer as he channels the spirit of the Stones or Faces, not to mention the Replacements, or other classic rock touchstones, though his own unique spectrum. That something so overtly slapdash could still come off so oddly sincere is no small part of the album's appeal (see also: prime Guided By Voices). In fact, if 49:00 turns out to be the rock equivalent of a transitional hip-hop mixtape, and some of these by turns brilliant and baffling bits and pieces end up polished and expanded on a proper album, there'll still be a place for 49:00. It's music with no pretense, no purpose, no baggage, proof that when it comes to labors of love, the latter is a much more important ingredient than the former.","Released with no fanfare, this ragged Paul Westerberg record may be his first solo album to fully capture the spirit as well as the sound of the Replacements-- and it's being sold for the easy-on-the-pocketbook price of $0.49.

Beautiful Future,Primal Scream,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1beb335119a49ecbb6/1:1/w_160/cb05b23d.jpg,2008-07-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12024-beautiful-future/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"At the turn of 90s, Primal Scream were one of the first groups to transform themselves from a conventional rock band into a production team. Breaking down traditional instrumental roles, the band became studio silly putty, collaborating with any number of producers. It's a concept that's since been embraced by the likes of Radiohead and the Flaming Lips, but where those groups have taken a studious, science-lab approach to their experimentalism, Primal Scream still project a venerable image of rock'n'roll hedonism. They unapologetically celebrate (and occasionally decry) their chemical consumption in song, mouth off in the press about crap bands and evil politicians, and load up their videos with Kate Moss cameos. Taken as a whole, Primal Scream's scattershot, trend-spotting discography doesn't so much represent a search for new sounds as a search for the best drugs: ecstasy (1991's epochal acid-house address Screamadelica), weed (1997's dubtronic odyssey Vanishing Point), speed (2000's explosive XTRMNTR), coke (2002's totally wired Evil Heat), and whatever horrific substance deludes them into releasing a Rolling Stones knockoff every 12 years (1994's Give Out But Don't Give Up, 2006's Riot City Blues). Beautiful Future is an especially rich title coming from a band with such a sloppy past, but its concise, laser-focussed 10-song tracklist-- bearing the pop-golden touch of producers Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, the Rapture) and Bjorn Yttling (Peter Bjorn and John, Lykke Li)-- suggests Primal Scream's latest high is sobriety. The opening title track features the most joyous, clear-headed melody they've sung since Screamadelica's ""Movin' on Up"", but in a much different dressing. Here, their Exile-era Stones influence yields to the cheeky glam of Sparks, from the jaunty piano riff, hand claps and ascending chorus, to Bobby Gillespie's wry commentary on middle-class privilege: ""Congratulations/ You're living the dream/ In the dead heart of the control machine."" The lyric may read like a typically agitated Gillespie spiel, but since assuming the role of techno-punk provocateurs on XTRMNTR-- in retrospect, a prescient anti-Bush/Blair manifesto-- Primal Scream's music has turned less pointedly political; rather than wage a carpet-bomb attack on governmental institutions, Beautiful Future seeks to serve those who live under their rule, seeming more sympathetic to the notion of materialism as escapism. Military references are either deployed playfully (the ""gas chambers"" on ""Beautiful Future"" standing in for a culture choking on over-consumption) or lazily (""Suicide Bomb"" being a cheap, ripped-from-the-headlines metaphor for goin' crazy), but even in the latter instance, the self-immolating image is followed by Gillespie declaring, ""I see the beauty in everything."" So it's fitting that Beautiful Future, musically, is drawn to the allure of cool, shimmering surfaces: ""Can't Go Back"" retrofits the brutalizing guitar holocaust of XTRMNTR's ""Accelerator"" as slick, Korg-crazed new wave, while the ""Billie Jean"" beat and Italo-disco sheen of ""Uptown"" glosses over its working-class-heroic chorus, positioning the band as unlikely but eager elder statesmen to the nu-romantic electro of Sam Sparro and Calvin Harris. In a sense, Beautiful Future finds Primal Scream turning into the sort of bright, bouncy 80s pop band they initially stood in opposition to. And yet, the transition is pulled off with such guileless enthusiasm and steely precision that the mid-album drift back to ultraviolet stoner/psych dirge (""Suicide Bomb"", ""Beautiful Summer"") feels like an unnecessary regression better left to the likes of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. But the group also stumbles when they force the fun: The woeful ""Zombie Man"" repurposes several Screamadelica signifiers, but squanders them all on a stupid, sore-thumb chorus chant (""Hey hey zombie man/ Gonna put you in a can""). Fortunately, the record's weak center stretch is redeemed by a great closing trifecta that again finds Primal Scream putting their far-reaching Rolodex to use: CSS' Lovefoxxx trades cool come-ons with Gillespie on the evil-heated ""I Love to Hurt (You Love to Be Hurt)"", which sounds like the Plastic Ono Band rager ""I Found Out"" given an Ed Banger remix; an elegiac, Linda Thompson-assisted cover of the Fleetwood Mac Tusk track ""Over and Over"" effectively fills Primal Scream's one-soul-ballad-per-album quota; and though Josh Homme doesn't actually sing on the closing ""Necro Hex Blues"", his presence is made obvious by the song's relentless, motorik-metal pulse, giving the band's long-standing Stooges fetish a 21st-century makeover. Much like Screamadelica's acid-rock/acid-house crossover nearly 20 years ago, Beautiful Future proposes an equally unlikely union between Primal Scream's traditional leather-jacketed indie/Britpop base and today's neon-capped, bottle-serviced club kids. And if this attempted reconciliation produces moments of both elation and frustration, well, the band's erratic track record gives us no real reason to expect otherwise.","Veteran shapeshifters' 10th album is focused and concise, bearing the pop-golden touch of producers Paul Epworth and Bjorn Yttling.

Deified,Keak da Sneak,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc14eb335119a49ecba8/1:1/w_160/11492995.jpg,2008-07-25 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12019-deified/,Keak Da Sneak,"Next to Keak Da Sneak's catalog-- solo joints, albums with Bay Area trio 3XKrazy, guest spots with E-40 and others-- occasionally indecipherable MCs Lil Wayne or Young Dro sound like Garrison Keillor. Less a croak than a gravel whistle, Keak's voice takes off over bubbling, restless hyphy and hyphy-esque melodies (it'd get subsumed and lost in anything East Coast and Gothic), and Deified, in all its practical KOCH-approved wisdom, never strays from Keak's wheelhouse. Bay Area native Young Mozart produced all but two tracks on the album, and as Deified runs through its kinetic 23-three song, 80-minute walkabout from the sopping-wet handclaps of ""19 Dummy"" to withering G-funk on ""N Fronta Ya Mama House"" to album-closing ""Super Hyphy"" and its overpowering teeter-totter synth, the record flexes a crude functionality. Deified's sound is so big and so unconcerned with the men rapping above it (the forgettable guest roster includes Paul Wall, Daz, Chingo Bling, and Messy Marv) that it only makes room for snippet's of Keak's barking. We can pick out references to police horses, ghost riding, and Smeagol-sound-alike boasting (like on the whipping, irresistible ""X2"") for a handful of bars before the album slides back into sonic burial: Keak snarling and moaning, nearly wordless; famished keyboards and 808s beating the landscape senseless. But no one listens to a Keak album the way they listen to an Aesop Rock joint. Deified is built for sweatbox clubs and car systems. Dizzying, effective songs (""X2"", ""Blurpt"", ""Who Started This"", ""That Go"") far outnumber the for-the-ladies concessions (""Nothing Without You"", ""Her Name""). While you'd never call a rap album this long ""nimble,"" Deified's banquet of sounds and songs goes about its business swiftly, skit-less, with minimal delusion and with maximum pace. The Bay area's sound, however, hasn't ignited the out-of-towners in the way, say, those from Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, or Memphis, have, and-- possibly Turf Talk aside-- in this contracting, compressing marketplace, it's not likely to convert any listeners not already conversational in its quirks and vocab. That will hardly matter to Keak: He's been a rapper since high school, and, depending on who you ask, he coined the term ""hyphy"" in 1998. He probably doesn't mind that if Deified were filed in the dance or electronic section, he'd win as many new fans as a choice position in your local Best Buy. Keak falls into that estuary of regional rappers that are big for their local pool, but not quite vicious, unique, or just plain brilliant enough for a chunk of the major pop market (see also: Redman, Slim Thug, and Z-Ro). Keak's relatively low profile is likely down to that voice-- occasionally unintelligible, spouting frequently sloppy lines or dense slang. He's not anonymous though-- Keak's throat is plenty memorable-- but his tracks are often without hopes, fears, stories, or a personality that last longer than three minutes. Maybe that's the point: Deified may be Keak's last, best shot at a nation-wide audience, and it's pure comfort zone: Keak as the peak of a sonic landscape, rising above a plain of burps and bassline twitters like a cold mountain-- rough, frozen, faceless, and iconic.","The gravel-voiced MC's latest never strays from his hyphy wheelhouse-- all but two of its 23 big, claustrophobic tracks were produced by Bay Area native Young Mozart.

Au Contraire,Pas Chic Chic,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc07abf31b7dc7155c17/1:1/w_160/759f7b11.jpg,2008-07-25 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12008-au-contraire/,Semprini,"The party line on Pas Chic Chic is that they're pursuing a psychedelic take on ""francophone pop"" or ""French pop""-- terms that appear in the band's biographical materials and press with startling persistence, despite their numbing ambiguity. Exactly which French pop tradition this umbrella term might refer to remains mysterious. Are we talking about the chansons of Jacques Brel, the yé-yé of Francoise Hardy, or what? Roger Tellier-Craig does seem to offer a flattened version of Brel's lusty, florid phrasing, but I can't speak French well enough to say whether or not Marie-Douce St. Jacques' lyrics reflect the arch naiveté of early-1960s yé-yé. If commentators on the band have been satisfied to recycle this line unquestioningly, and if I'm not rushing to my French-English dictionary to decode the lyrics, I suspect the music's uninviting surface is to blame-- it's hard to work up enough investment in the album to want to figure it out. It's not that the band isn't doing what it claims to be doing. Drawn from a familiar pool of Montreal musicians (including members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Fly Pan Am, and Set Fire to Flames), Pas Chic Chic are in a much better position to understand the traditions in question than I am. The problem is that drawing a line between a traditional idiom and a modern one isn't automatically a rewarding enterprise, although it will earn you perfunctory praise from people afraid of appearing to have missed the point. On Au Contraire, this connection seldom seems to transcend the academic, and the music, despite flashes of interest, is mostly tedious. The most glaring culprits for this tedium are the shrill Farfisa organ and Mellotron tones that haze the bulk of the arrangements, flattening whatever interest resides in them into an enervating shriek. It also muscles out the percussion, making it sound wimpy (although its sprightly, insistent quality does convey a touch of yé-yé jubilance). Both singers are capable, but neither has any particular charisma; the melodies and arrangements lack direction. Songs like ""Vous Comprenez Pourquoi"" begin at full-blast, noise around for a bit, and end at full-blast, which makes them feel oddly static despite all of their smoke and thunder. Pas Chic Chic are best when they leave enough space in their tracks for songs to resolve. The svelte pulse of ""Mlle Mille"" is a welcome respite, at least until it explodes into an FX orgy; ditto for the bouncy Tropicalia of ""Se Mirer Mare"" and the reverb-brushed dirge ""Aude Aux Ondes"". But overall, one leaves the album with a memory of relentless bombast and fanfare, not distinct songs. You could argue that a deep knowledge of various French pop styles is required to enjoy the album, but this seems like a strike against it-- shouldn't music's value speak for itself, in any language or style?","Pursuing a psychedelic take on various styles of French pop, this Montreal band includes members of Godspeed You!

Fate,Dr. Dog,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1fc0084474cd0c2a06/1:1/w_160/fbbe830e.jpg,2008-07-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12027-fate/,Park the Van,"Dr. Dog have never released an album called Do You Like Rock Music? and I suppose that recent actions taken by British Sea Power ensure they never will. But that question always feels implied in the Dr. Dog experience-- just ask anyone who's not picking up what this Philly fivesome is throwing down and is subsequently accused of not digging ""real music, mannnnn."" And maybe their version of ""realness"" triggers an unfortunate sense of self-loathing, because ""Beatles-esque"" has for so long been the preeminent last-resort adjective for critics-- virtually meaningless, undeniably lazy, avoided at all costs. Fate is the fifth straight time Dr. Dog has made it abundantly clear that they're not gonna make it any easier on us. At the very least, Fate is something of a survivor album: the saliva's long been dry from Kelefa Sanneh's sloppy tongue kiss of a profile in The New York Times and the band isn't exactly selling out arenas, so backlash can only be wielded by the extremely petty. Besides, far shittier bands have come along since that time with a similar sound and bigger sense of entitlement (file under: Kids, Cold War). More importantly, Dr. Dog have been gradually able to amp up their budget to record the album they ""were destined to make,"" sounding like they've done something other than going straight to Maxell tapes. Ironically for a band whose rep was made on its live shows, this spit polish does Dr. Dog huge favors. On last year's relatively posh, 24-tracked We All Belong, their ear for sonic simulacra was impressive: the full-bodied and well-placed harmonies suggested a band far less amateur than they were willing to put on, organs trilled modestly, and the tightly-mic'd drums of Juston Stens were a dead ringer for Ringo St... goddamnit, see what I meant in the first paragraph? All that said, Fate still manages to be a master class in illusory ""good"" songwriting. The bulk of it is so fenced into classicist templates-- chamber-y pop meets maximum R&B with the occasional smidge of ""tasteful"" gospel/parlour games (""Hang On"") that, even when merely competent, it can still win over those unimpressed with all that punk and hip-hop riff raff of the past three decades. While Fate was rolling, I thought I'd be able to tell you about how delicious the descending melody of ""The Old Days"" is, or how their stabs at Bonzo Dog Band irreverence manages to come across as genuine. The problem is, once it's over I can hardly remember how any of it went. Fate is actually stronger for having a viscosity suitable for sliding in one ear and out the other, because the more memorable moments are the worst, due in large part to the insufferable anachronisms of dueling vocalists Toby Leaman and Scott McMicken. During the ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" jazzmatazz of ""The Ark"", Leaman bemoans, ""God, he called for rain/ So I built an ark but no rain came/ I was ashamed,"" before he goes off the rails during a similarly AAA-rhymed rant about war (it's bad!). ""The Beach"" is about as much fun as you'd expect an environmental plea from these guys would be (and, oh man, that ""fixing a hole..."" bit). And amidst the slouching piano rag of ""From"", Leaman waits for the ""choo choo train"" in, of all places, the ""choo choo rain."" I guess it wouldn't be fair if we didn't at least consider the possibility that Dr. Dog are the subject of a double standard because their influences aren't novel-- bands like Cut Copy, No Age, Hercules & Love Affair, and Fleet Foxes are also obviously indebted to a specific period of time, and they seem to do fine around these parts. But like their fellow Philly-retro-author-cause célèbre Marah, Dr. Dog often view their predecessors like museum pieces instead of inspiration, only these guys are probably too shook to consider some sort of disastrous about-face like Float Away With the Friday Night Gods. Plus, the overly serious takes on religion and politics, combined with Leaman and McMicken's tendency to project their voices past ""Hey Jude"" huzzahs into soul papa smarm (""Army of Ancients"", amongst others) and ""I gave my love a cherry"" sobriety, make you wonder exactly how much credence to put into the idea that ""they're just having fun."" Maybe, this is the kind of thing that will ultimately sound better half-heard at an Indian summer BBQ or even live, but until Dr. Dog realizes what would've resulted if their idols just reheated the past as unambitiously as they do, forget all those Beatles and Beach Boys namedrops and stick with ""average white band."" No caps.","Something of a survivor album, Dr. Dog's latest finds the group-- permanently poised on the edge of a commerical breakthrough that never comes-- amping up its budget on this relatively posh-sounding record.

"No, Virginia...",The Dresden Dolls,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0a13d197565213b216/1:1/w_160/52e01fbc.jpg,2008-07-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12010-no-virginia/,Roadrunner,"As if actor types weren't punchable enough, the Dresden Dolls set their thespian flair to rock music, resulting in a sub-genre known by names like ""dark cabaret,"" ""gothic rock,"" and-- the duo's preferred tag-- ""Brechtian punk cabaret."" While this looks catastrophic and/or tacky on paper, the Dolls don't sound like a novel act, just an indie group that happens to dig piano/drums arrangements and Weimar-era aesthetics. Thanks to their dramatic chops, the Boston duo also knows how to grab an audience's heart and shove it in a grinder. The question is, how does a band that's always ""on"" reconcile their spotlight-swallowing energy with such an inherently low-stakes release as an odds'n'sods album? In a way, they don't even try to, and that makes No, Virginia... an album on par with the Dolls' two fully conceived LPs. The duo claims these songs were excluded from full-lengths because of poor cohesion, not quality. I'm not sure why a dark sexcapade (and highlight) like ""Lonely Organist Rapes Page Turner"" couldn't have been wedged between two of Yes, Virginia's many lusty ditties, but if they feel the LP's narrative arc was so unaccomodating, I'm not going to argue. The somewhat laughable explanation for most of these cast-offs is that the Dolls found them too poppy. With the exception of a forgettable ""Pretty in Pink"" cover, nothing here feels saccharine or simplistic. Singer/pianist Amanda Palmer just deploys too many mindfucks, warping a song like ""Ultima Esperanza"" from 1990s female singer-songwriter detritus to an unsettling ballad of turbulent yelps and lyrics about an amputee. Multi-track harmonies and a killer chorus hook sweeten ""Sorry Bunch"", but Palmer's sneering delivery and despair (""here's to alcohol/here's to chemicals"") stave off corniness. Drummer/vocalist Brian Viglione continues to move further upstage after his riveting contributions on Yes, providing both muscle and fidgety tension on otherwise straightforward songs like ""Dear Jenny"" and ""Night Reconnaissance"". The compilation's not all gravy, obviously, but the valleys on No aren't egregiously low, either. ""The Mouse and the Model"" and ""The Gardener"" further illustrate a chronic pitfall for the Dolls-- overly long and brooding dirges, one of the few instances where histrionics hamstrings creativity. In that vein, seven-plus minute closer (and Yes B-side) ""Boston"" goes for the big finish and actually nails it, ranking as one of the duo's finest epics to date. With some trimming, the Dolls could've passed about five or six of these spare parts off as a kind of mini-opera EP. That said, any B-side, no matter how problematic, should be viewed strictly as bonus, and the ever-dashing Dolls bring it in buckets here.","Dresden Dolls release an odds'n'sods collection of songs they claim were excluded from full-lengths because of poor cohesion, not quality.

Donkey,CSS,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1013d197565213b22b/1:1/w_160/882cb99c.jpg,2008-07-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12016-donkey/,Sub Pop,"Had my shit been more together, I'd have written about Cansei de Ser Sexy's debut in our recent Sub Pop staff feature. To my ears, CSS was a NSFW Blondie, with Lovefoxxx and Adriano Cintra pulling their flamboyant aesthetic equally from the realms of disco and punk, as if ""Atomic"" were the exemplar of all music and its refrain of ""your hair is beautiful"" the highest compliment one could be paid. Though Cintra wrote all the music, Lovefoxxx was the heart and soul of the group; that rare lead singer able to easily slip between emotional extremes. At her best she was empathetic and jubilant, but she could turn misanthropic and snarky with equal vigor, aiming her venom at Art Bitches and Paris Hilton after preemptively guarding against a return blow on the opening track, ""CSS Suxxx"". Donkey, to put it lightly, brings a different type of energy; Lovefoxxx's presence is still strong, but Cintra's production and songwriting takes the music in a distinctly different direction. In a recent interview with Pitchfork's Paul Thompson, Lovefoxxx described Donkey as not only produced on the road (on their year-long, worldwide tour), but also for the road. Through playing live over their extensive world tour, she explained, they gradually smoothed the sharp extremes of the debut's ecstatic disco and garish electro, and Donkey was built from the idea that its songs would be much easier to recreate live. As a result, most of CSS' nuance, sense of irony, and genre schizophrenia have been excised in favor of, well, the exact sort of bland dance-punk they so skillfully avoided on their first album. Debut single ""Rat Is Dead"" hinted at this shift; stylistically, its closest cousin from CSS is ""Off the Hook"", the most traditional track on a record that defined itself through the jaggy peaks of dissimilar dance styles. ""Rat"" is of course much darker-- the band's own ""Goodbye Earl"", more or less-- and like ""Hook"" it would be fine as the sole bearer of its tone. As it stands, though, ""Rat"" is the lone bright spot on Donkey's surprisingly bad first half, which aside from the lightweight and forgettable ""Reggae All Night"", scarcely rises from a gloomy modern rock swamp. Despite hat tips to ""Ab Fab"" and John Waters, opener ""Jager Yoga"" isn't glitzy and grotesque but clunky, like ""Take Me Out"" reimagined for a hipster step-aerobics class. Considering that no other Donkey track deigns to reference pop culture, ""Yoga"" plays like a vague memory of CSS, with much of the rest a depressing capitulation to a newfound mediocrity. Appropriately for a record made in airports, hotels, and buses, travel (and what gets lost between destinations) is Donkey's most prominent lyrical conceit, but more often than not it leads the band astray. Cintra-penned ""I Fly"" is glossy riff-rock that metaphorically represents a touring musician as, you guessed it, a buzzing fly, and ""Give Up"" is ultra-orthodox love-on-the-road stuff that's not flattered by its Editors-esque backing track. ""Left Behind"" finds Lovefoxxx singing Cintra's lyrics over dirty laser synths, lamenting a cheating beau in Helsinki and contemplating flying back there to burn her shit and go on a table-dancing bender. These are all competent enough songs to suggest the work of a set of session musicians, but predictability is far from CSS' strong suit. More depressingly, these moments sound like a band that made its name by sniping from afar at the rich and well-traveled more or less becoming part of music's world-conquering, festival-hopping jet-set. Donkey's highpoints happen when Lovefoxxx's personality shines through clearest: ""Beautiful Song"" is her take on touring, and the tune is predictably sweet and joyful: it's ""Flying high on the rug, with the ones you love,"" breaking beds instead of sleeping on them, taking goofy photos of your friends. ""Believe/Achieve"" and ""Air Painter"" capture her most endearing creative trait: merging romance with an abiding, and equally profound, love for music and art, so wonderfully rendered on CSS via ""Music Is My Hot Hot Sex"" and ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above"". Here, atop ""Achieve""s breezy new wave, Lovefoxxx wants to literally and figuratively explore the tastes of her lover, singing ""I'm going to eat all your food/ To try to feel what is that/ That music brings to you."" ""Air Painter"" is a romantic lament that glosses as a love letter/CD combo slipped into a suitcase: ""Send me a postcard, write me a letter/ And sing this song as loud as can be!"" The joycore bricolage of CSS is all but missing on Donkey, but hopefully the band hasn't allowed itself to become completely jaded by increased celebrity and the rigors of globe-trotting. We're only young once, and it's too much to ask of any artist to maintain the same wide-eyed sense of abandon that made us fall for them in the first place. The road weariness that led to Donkey's by-the-books professionalism seems to have set in so quickly, though; here's hoping it wears off just as fast.","Through near-constant live sets, CSS have gradually smoothed their debut's ecstatic disco and garish electro into meaty fuzz-rock, creating a record that strips the band's nuance and sense of irony and seems primed to appeal to a wider demographic.

Love to Make Music To,Daedelus,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc12eb335119a49ecba6/1:1/w_160/fca441c7.jpg,2008-07-24 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12018-love-to-make-music-to/,Ninja Tune,"There are 50 ways to leave your lover, and Daedelus (aka Los Angeles-based electronic composer and trained jazz man Alfred Weisberg-Roberts) wants to sell you 15 more. Love to Make Music To, his ninth album since 2002's Invention and first on Ninja Tune explores love and lust in all their facets, but never quite gets there. LTMMT's global shortcoming is a catalogue of micro-errors: the clashing of chintzy, tip-glass pianos and chattering hi-hats that make ""Get Off Your HiHats"" sounds like a castoff from a mid-90s car racing game; a vanishing bassline that tosses wincingly bad verses from Paperboy and Taz into the naked foreground of ""Touchtone""; ""Drummery Jam"" and its timbre-muddling shifts from 808s to yet another chintzy piano loop; the X-ed out lounge ballad ""I Car(ry) Us"" leading off with a female voice whispering ""I'm so high!""; the woeful song titles; the tourette-esque shifts in mood and timbre; the goofy album cover. Daedelus may be productive and talented (peep his Throw a Fit EP), this album's lack of cohesion lumps it in with any one of a thousand amorphous DJ mixes. The real pain is just how gamely LTMMT tries to show a heart. Album-opening ""Fair Weather Friends"" trots out a coy PSA vocal sample over modest handclaps: ""You know, when the weather gets warm, we get the same things on our minds as you boys do!"" Message received. The sound and sentiments keep piling and piling, but the fun keeps draining and draining. It's not that Weisberg-Roberts has the wrong idea. Labelmate Ghislain Poirier tried, and fully succeeded, in grafting general concern with airy electronic earlier this year with No Ground Under, an album as sly with its globalization and political bones as LTMMT is ham-fisted in romance. The difference? There is nothing meticulous about LTMMT, which loses shape in sloppy transitions, sacrificing landscape and pacing for an eager-to-please ADD. Daedelus does ocassionally display some focus: A simple backbone of bells and chants float ""You're the One"" along a breezy mid-tempo draft; ""Only for the Heart Strings"" works a buzzing, hornet-nest synthesizer over hi-hats. Prefuse 73's haunting, sonically fragmented break-up epic One Word Extinguisher is the platinum standard for abstract hip-hop producers embracing emotion, and while Daedelus' LTMMT is aiming for a more southern latitude (hips and areas south) than Extinguisher, it is impossible to ignore just how ragged this sounds held next to any one of a dozen of other electronic albums shooting for the same conceptual stars. Talent levels have little to do with it. Weisberg-Roberts has made fine, thoughtful albums before. He'll do so again. What is at stake is the old adage from Faulkner on editing, ""kill your darlings."" Had Weisberg-Roberts edited closer, trimmed neater, and not given every move and twist a internal gold star, then LTMMT might have been a more complete record.","Daedelus' ninth album since 2002's Invention and first on Ninja Tune, embraces love and lust in all of their facets.

No Fun Demo,Dino Felipe,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0bea9e61561daa73a3/1:1/w_160/1aa35437.jpg,2008-07-24 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12011-no-fun-demo/,No Fun,"Miami-based sound wizard Dino Felipe has made a lot of records-- more than 30 in the past decade, if you count his various groups and compilation appearances-- but very few of them sound alike. His primary M.O. is electronic noise, but he's also good at droning ambience, fractured punk, sample-heavy frivolity, and weirdo bedroom pop. He's made a subterranean career out of dodging definition, so it figures that his first record for No Fun, the noise label run by his friend and colleague Carlos Giffoni, would be his poppiest to date. It may not also be his best, but it's up there. Of course, pop is a relative term when it comes to Felipe. There are melodic, structured songs here, but his approach is still hazy, off-kilter, and weird. Most of his tunes sport skewed hooks and off-key riffs which get dipped in fuzz and echo, half-hidden by distortion, pitch shifting, and ghostly distance. This puts No Fun Demo in the same ballpark as the AM-radio lo-fi of Ariel Pink, but Felipe's songs are more sturdy, and the album is more consistent than any Pink record save the underrated House Arrest. In that sense, its title is deceptive: These tracks may initially sound like four-track demos made alone in a basement, but they hold up as well-crafted songs, the kind that couldn't have been whipped up in a single lonesome evening. Take ""Found 2 Photos""-- its mid-tempo drum machine, loping bass line, and two-chord organ seem to follow one simple idea. But a closer listen reveals clever guitar flourishes, random percussion, and a vocal line that sounds like Silver Jews filled with helium. The same goes for ""Working on Not"", a looping electronic piece that's like a pop take on Can or Excepter, and ""Rabbit Head"", whose sneaky melody at first seems lethargic, but eventually becomes energetic and almost tight. A few of Felipe's songs are just flat-out, unfiltered pop. ""I Wanna Feel Better"" bends and twists around a syrupy hook, while the bouncing ""Chandeliers"" (a Haunted House cover) features scorched chanting over a driving piano line. Felipe only falters when he gets too retro-clever-- check the blatant 80s-synth exercise ""What's Wrong With Me?""-- or repeats himself (a few of the slower pieces feel identical). But at least No Fun Demo is stylistically consistent. Felipe rarely deviates from his own oddball logic, and if his worst sin is not enough variety to give his music a wider appeal, well, maybe that's just another feather in his bulging cap.","Prolific Miami-based sound wizard Dino Felipe has made a lot of records-- more than 30 in the past decade, if you count his various groups and compilation appearances-- but this is his poppiest to date and first for No Fun, the noise label run by his friend and colleague Carlos Giffoni.

See You in Magic,The Night Marchers,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1eabf31b7dc7155c48/1:1/w_160/35d4d61c.jpg,2008-07-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12026-see-you-in-magic/,Swami,"To be a fan of John ""Speedo"" Reis is to know tough love. In the past two years alone, the man has stepped away from not one but two of America's most fierce and fearsome indie-rock bands: brass-balled busters Rocket From the Crypt and the deadly Hot Snakes (itself a recombinant version of prematurely deep-sixed 1990s math-punk heroes Drive Like Jehu, itself a recombinant version of the seminal San Diego punk-rock band that shares a name with this website). But seeing as how Reis has played a hand in no fewer than 20 albums over the past 20 years-- with those mentioned above as well as lower-profile projects Back Off Cupids and Sultans-- it'd be safe to assume the recent demise of his two flagship acts does not portend a lifetime spent on golf courses working on his tan.
 
Ergo, the Night Marchers, a new four-piece-- featuring former Hot Snakes bassist (now guitarist) Gar Wood and drummer Jason Kourkounis, and CPC Gangbangs bassist Tommy Kitsos-- who are essentially to Rocket From the Crypt what Hot Snakes were to Jehu: A more refined, controlled version thereof, in this case, retaining RFTC's affinities for 50s rockabilly romps and punk-rock stomps, but with the muscular riffage stripped down to a more angular jangle, and the brass ballast removed to place renewed focus on the melodies and lyrics (which, ironically, for someone starting down the big 4-0, have become even more depraved). Nothing on See You in Magic constitutes uncharted territory for Reis-- its most righteous rave-ups, ""I Wanna Deadbeat You"" and ""Bad Bloods"", could've figured on any of RFTC's Interscope-era records-- but where sensitive, sing-song turns like ""Used"" once constituted anomalous respites on RFTC records, here they're inching more to become the rule, thus presenting a 20-year vet like Reis with a new challenge: to carry the songs on his vocal cords rather than power chords.
 
It's one he's eager to meet head-on, opting for a clean, unfussy production, with a natural reverb that put the vocals up front and centre, well above the sinewy guitar lines and Kourkounis' swing-beat drums. But if the herky-jerky new-waver ""Total Bloodbath"", and the ""Ticket to Ride""-styled charmer ""Partner in Crime"" find Reis comfortably adapting to the pop approach, the mix can also leave Reis hanging out to dry, particularly on the smooth '70s-Stones strut ""You've Got Nerve"", where the droning qualities of his rasp are overemphasized by a chorus that simply repeats the title ad infinitum. And it's just one of a handful of songs here that suffer from that same affliction-- the ""oh oh oh oh"" breakdown on rockabilly shuffle ""Open Your Legs"" goes on for a good 20 reps, and Reis shouts out the chorus of ""In Dead Sleep (I Snore ZZZZ)"" so many times, you'd be liable to do the same if weren't for the ascending, needling guitar riffs pricking up your spine. ""Headlights fade but I keep marching on,"" Reis declares on ""Jump in the Fire"", an inspired, I-will-survive anthem worthy of becoming his new mission statement. But next time out, he just needs to be careful not to goose-step in circles.","Ex-Rocket From the Crypt man John ""Speedo"" Reis here leads a new group, one that features his former Hot Snakes bandmates Gar Wood and Jason Kourkounis and functions as a more refined, controlled version of RFTC.

A Certain Feeling,Bodies of Water,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc16eb335119a49ecbad/1:1/w_160/d7a66820.jpg,2008-07-24 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12021-a-certain-feeling/,Secretly Canadian,"With a Mamas and the Papas-ish lineup of two men and two women, Bodies of Water blend the revival-tent theatrics of the Danielson Famile with the joyous cacophony of Tilly and the Wall and the dimly lit kraut rock of Electrelane. Only a year after their debut (Ears Will Pop & Eyes Will Blink), the L.A.-based quartet led by husband-and-wife team Meredith and David Metcalf have returned with a collection that plays up the communal feeling of their combined singing, but also mixes it with something shadowy and enigmatic. No longer straightforward in their blissfully SoCal re-imagining of gospel-pop, they now sound steeped in candlelight, moonlight, and gaslight-- something ephemeral that shines uncertainly in the darkness. Though A Certain Feeling maintains the expansiveness and drama of Bodies of Water's first album, it's colored more darkly. Instead of major-key, Polyphonic Spree-esque celebrations, the overwhelmingly minor-key songs are now more hushed, haunted, or introspective. If Ears Will Pop & Eyes Will Blink was the sound of walking into a boisterous youth group service, A Certain Feeling is the sound of entering a stately cathedral. That's not say that the vibe is too grandiose or serious: ""Darling, Be Here"", the album's best track, melds a Broadway-worthy vocal melody with a proggy, Yes-influenced guitar-and-organ extended intro, and ""Water Here"" funks up the band's playful Godspell gospel with a breakdown of skronking horns and rhythmic guitars. And while Bodies of Water are always noted for their vocal prowess, those guitar parts, like the fuzzy garage-rock figure that drives ""Under the Pines"" alongside a psychedelic organ vamp, showcase a newfound muscularity to David's playing and riff writing. And for those that miss the unbridled positivity of their debut, Bodies of Water close this record with their prettiest, quietest song yet. Stripped of all their reverb and built on a gently poignant piano, ""The Mud Gapes Open"" is lyrically concise, containing only eight words in its entirety. In fact, the track's only other lyric, outside of the ones in its title, is the line, ""we're not that worried,"" delivered in delicately sweet co-ed harmony. Which seems an appropriate note to end the album on. If Bodies of Water can continue to create such richly textured, expressive music, that's exactly how they should feel about their future.","Scaling back the unbridled positivity of their debut, California-based Bodies of Water mix their earlier communal, gospel-pop feel with something shadowy and enigmatic.

Boy / October / War,U2,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc17abf31b7dc7155c3b/1:1/w_160/2c8f2808.jpg,2008-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12022-boy-october-war/,IslandIsland,"In 2008, it's nearly impossible to imagine U2 as teenagers rehearsing in a Dublin kitchen. Today, they're a powerful brand, a group with closets full of Grammys, more than 170 million records sold worldwide, stadium tours, membership in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and a lead singer whose charitable initiatives have allowed him to hold court with some of the world's most powerful people. It's funny, then, to think that the band is still the same four guys who first got together in 1976 to form the Larry Mullen Band. When David ""the Edge"" Evans, Paul ""Bono"" Hewson, Larry Mullen, Jr., and Adam Clayton released their first EP, Three, in 1979, they were still teenagers with an attitude and naïveté that didn't quite dovetail with the rest of the post-punk world. Even on their earliest recordings, they didn't sound like a band that could be contained by small venues. U2 had to be big. Those earliest recordings are among the huge clutch of rare tracks-- studio B-sides, previously unreleased tracks, live shows, radio sessions, and remixes-- that populate the bonus discs accompanying these new reissues of the band's first three albums, 1980's Boy, 1981's October, and 1983's War. The first EP, included with Boy, isn't great, in part because the dry percussion is ill-suited to the band's (and particularly the Edge's) textural style; their debut album is another story. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, it opens with ""I Will Follow"", a surging colossus of a song that still ranks among the best tracks in the band's catalog. Bono's powerful vocals-- he got his nickname from a shorter form of Bono Vox (Good Voice)-- bring immediacy and energy to the album. And he was matched by the Edge's guitar playing, which he approached like a painter does a brush, using it as a tool to coat the canvas of the song with sound rather than resorting to basic riffs or simple strumming. The version of ""Out of Control"" on Three had been dry and punky; the version on Boy is a near-anthem, with Bono's yelp transformed into an arcing croon and the Edge's slashing guitar grown into a huge, curling wave. ""A Day Without Me"" sounds like a rehearsal for an arena gig that was still years away-- the line ""started a landslide in my ego"" must have had different connotations back then for Bono than it does now. Lillywhite does a great job of capturing what made U2 unique (the Edge's remastering work is also vastly superior to the original CD transfer), and it makes sense that the band re-hired him for its rushed second album, convincing the producer to break his self-imposed rule of never working with an artist more than once. That sophomore effort, October, is a bit of a wobble for the band. The sound is there, and even more fully fledged than it was on the debut, but the band were staring at a songwriting deficit after Bono's lyric notebook was stolen from a backstage room. Both their improved playing and lack of solid new material are evident on the album, a good-enough record that kept the band on its feet and signed to Island Records after a near-breakup. Here, Bono atypically relies on repetitive lyrics and at times possesses an uncharacteristic tentativeness. Opener ""Gloria"" displays some musical dynamism, but its Latin-language chorus tempers its anthemic qualities, with only the Edge's searing guitar to cover for the loss. October does, however, nearly match its predecessor on several songs. ""Tomorrow"" is a beautiful ballad that gives Bono a chance to show his range, and nods to the band's homeland with its use of yearning Uilleann pipes, while the title track is a spectral, slow song that, unusually for U2, is grounded by a piano. Elsewhere, ""Scarlet"" is essentially an instrumental, the only lyric being Bono's repetition of the word ""Rejoice"", one of a handful of vaguely religious references on the album. ""With a Shout"" comes closest to matching the sweep of ""I Will Follow"" with its racing rhythm track and strange, dubby horn interjection, but doesn't quite have the hook. October wasn't an affirming hit and, by its own admission, the band felt pressure to deliver on its third album, believing Island could cut them loose if it bore similar results. It doesn't take long to hear that the band was aiming for something different on War, which opens with a sharply staccato snare drum that sets up a startlingly martial beat. A piercing violin anticipates Bono's entrance: ""I can't believe the news today/ I can't close my eyes and make it go away/ How long, how long must we sing this song?"" The bass line is a dry, raw rumble, while the Edge slides back and forth between a funky scratch and his signature searching lines. ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", pointedly named for the shooting of 26 civilian protesters by members of the 1st Battalion of the British Parachute Regiment in Derry, Northern Ireland in 1972, was an instant anti-war anthem and carried an urgency that outpaced even that of ""I Will Follow"". The energy and insistence of the opener is sustained across the album. ""Two Hearts Beat As One"" and ""New Year's Day"" are thrilling, finally showing the intense passion Bono's voice was capable of imparting when he had the right words to wrap it around. Outside its three flagship hits, War was eclectic but still entirely U2. ""Seconds"" rides a hypnotic bass line to a final verse that conflates nuclear standoff with a dance craze; ""The Refugee"" aims for a sort of downtown NYC alt-disco vibe and is faintly ridiculous for it; ""Two Hearts"" nails a hard funk-punk groove; and ""Surrender"" features an early dose of the Edge's fractured slide guitar style. The propulsive ""Like a Song..."" perhaps sums up the album's immediacy with the opening line ""Like a song I had to sing."" As much as these were songs that Bono sincerely felt, he clearly wished that the world was a good enough place that it wouldn't require them. On gentle album closer ""40"" he returns to a refrain from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", saying ""I will sing, sing a new song/ How long to sing this song,"" regretting the need to sing about the world's ills. The U2 we've known ever since had arrived on War, and even today it sounds vital. As much as cynical critics and listeners often swipe at U2 for their earnestness, it's still refreshing to hear a band that cares so much, wants to be heard by so many, and isn't afraid to show it. As if to hammer home the point, the reissues each include contact information for half a dozen activist charity organizations. These reissues nicely chart the progression of U2 from wide-eyed kids with a great sound to purposeful musicians and activists several paces down the path to mega-stardom. As products, they do everything a reissue should, presenting the original albums with improved sound in excellent, informative packages-- the 2xCD versions will reward committed fans with a handful of good-to-great live recordings and every available studio curio from the era. (It's admittedly weird to hear ""New Year's Day"" turned into a club track, but intriguing nonetheless.) Whatever some may say of them, there's no denying that U2 have been an enormously important band for nearly 30 years now, as well as an extraordinary force for good as the members have leveraged their fame to bring attention and funding to innumerable worthy causes. Even the biggest stars have to start somewhere, and these discs are a strong reminder that the best of U2's beginnings remain worthy of attention.",,8.3,
