Assemble,Hi Red Center,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d2ea9e61561daa4b37/1:1/w_160/a9828b2c.jpg,2009-03-10 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12764-assemble/,Joyful Noise,"With its cheerful collision of disjointed guitar rhythms, unpredictable drumbeats, and strained soprano vocals, it is almost impossible to listen to Hi Red Center's second album, Assemble, without being reminded of the musical pandemonium exemplified by San Francisco quartet Deerhoof. The excellently titled opening track, ""Toothless Beau"", sounds uncannily like an outtake from Deerhoof's Friend Opportunity, bridging the same terrain between bracing chaos and cutesy charm that makes that band so entertaining. The similarities between the two groups are so apparent at first that it takes a few tracks before Hi Red Center's own quirky personality comes out to play, finally coaxed out of the shadows of its influences. Assemble is more focused and crisp sounding than the band's 2005 debut, Architectural Failures, and this type of production better suits their current material, providing space for all the intricate layers of sound to radiate through. The New York-based six piece have an extensive amount of ideas up their sleeves, the most obvious being their penchant for juxtaposing seemingly oppositional sounds and demonstrating how well they can work together. The two dominant tones on this album are fractured, dueling U.S. Maple-style guitar lines that rub against the delicate plinks of a vibraphone, such as on the song ""Littlest Giant"", which shows the band at their hyper-experimental best. Not an instrument to be underestimated, the vibraphone's prominent place on Assemble is a light melodic springboard, always present for the other sounds to bounce off. Since vocalists Laura Barger and Marla Hansen joined the original core members in 2007, the band have also been able to experiment more fully with gang vocal rounds, and on tracks like ""Symmetry Chameleon"" this brings a sense of unity to the recording, tying the shards of guitar together with staggered, rich mini-choir interludes. Although the sheer hyperactivity and stop-start nature of Assemble can make it a somewhat uncomfortable listen at first, it is worth rising to the challenges Hi Red Center present. Their experimental noise rock is frequently defined by a deceptively disheveled structure that is in fact highly restrained, much like the SKiN GRAFT label's 1990s catalog. While it takes a bit of patience, this energetic, rhythmic approach combined with moments of unabashed, childish glee makes for some highly adventurous pop.","Disjointed guitar rhythms, unpredictable drumbeats, and strained soprano vocals make unavoidable the comparison to Deerhoof.

Thank You Very Quickly,Extra Golden,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d1ea9e61561daa4b33/1:1/w_160/22343d79.jpg,2009-03-10 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12763-thank-you-very-quickly/,Thrill Jockey,"Extra Golden's third album closes with the title track, a song thanking the band's fans for donating money to keep the Kenyan members' families out of harm's way during the violent convulsion that heaved through the country after last year's contentious election. It's a buoyant song that typifies the band's seamless blend of American rock music with benga, Kenya's ebullient and propulsive dance music, but like a lot of benga songs, it packs a serious message into the lilting, doubled vocals, sung mostly in Luo, with an English verse by Ian Eagleson. ""Next time, it could be you,"" Eagleson reminds English-speaking listeners; near the end, there's a cry of ""ok-oyot!"" amid some celebratory cheering, a reference to the title of their debut LP, and a phrase that roughly means ""It's not easy."" And nothing has been easy for this band. For a moment, set aside the fact that half the members live on one continent and the other half live on a separate one, a challenge in itself, and consider their path to this point. Original member Otieno Jagwasi died of AIDS-related illness before the first album could be released, and his brother Onyango is now in the band, dueling with Eagleson's guitar. The other original Kenyan member, drummer Onyango Wuod Omari, sings lead on ""Ukimwi"" an impassioned plea to wipe out the disease that killed Otieno Jagwasi and holds much of eastern and southern Africa in a terrible thrall. Three years ago, the Kenyan members needed intervention from then-Senator Barack Obama to get visas to enter the U.S., and the threat posed by last year's violence is self-explanatory. So it's a small triumph that the band even still exists. The music on Thank You Very Quickly is a triumph of a different sort. Extra Golden have conquered whatever divide there once was between rock and benga to create a distinct sound of their own that respects both traditions. They've gained so much confidence in their sound that they've even begun to expand it beyond that collision. ""Fantasies of the Orient"" is a hard-grooving track laced with psychedelic organ and three-against-four rhythms that recall the pop music of Kenya's neighbor to the north, Ethiopia. Eagleson and Jagwasi trade lines throughout the song, dueting in two languages while their guitars carry the multi-lingual conversation into the music, pitting distortion against clean fluidity. I'm grateful that Extra Golden have continued their partnership, not only because of the quality and uniqueness of the band's music, but also for the fact that the band is a powerful symbol for the good that can arise from an interconnected world. They're a community-building entity on multiple levels, from the way they inspired fans to reach out and help their families in a time of tremendous need, to the way they feed into notions of global community. Thank You Very Quickly is an album for everyone from four guys who've discovered a way to make our world just a bit smaller.","Thrill Jockey releases another seamless blend of American rock music with benga, Kenya's ebullient and propulsive dance music.

"The Art of Field Recording, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2db13d197565213896e/1:1/w_160/61fe42ca.jpg,2009-03-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12770-the-art-of-field-recording-vol-2/,Dust-to-Digital,"In November 2007, Atlanta's Dust-to-Digital Records released The Art of Field Recording, Vol. 1 , a sweeping, 4xCD collection of field recordings assembled by the folklorist and visual artist Art Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum's considerable personal collection (which spans a half-century, contains thousands of hours of tape, and is supplemented by Rosenbaum's own photographs, paintings, and drawings) demanded more than just four discs; Dust-to-Digital plotted a second volume in response. Vol. 2 follows the same basic organizing principle as its predecessor: The four discs are arranged by theme (Survey, Religious, Accompanied Songs and Ballads, Unaccompanied Songs and Ballads), and are comprised exclusively of field recordings, provoked and captured in living rooms, churches, front porches, backyards, graveyards, and parlors across the Southeast, Midwest, and Canada. Without discounting the participants' musicianship, the real pleasure of these boxes is in the peripheral noise, the clinks, rustles, guffaws, giggles, and snorts of ordinary life, the self-composed and self-delivered introductions, the soft-spoken folklorist nudging from the corner-- that's the true and precious miracle of field recording. We now know, for example, that there exists no more sublime a preface to ""Steamboat Bill"" than Iowan Jack Bean-- in his deep, gnarly, slightly-too-loud voice-- barking ""My name is Jack Bean, I live in Wapello, I'm 70 years old, and I'm a half-assed musician. Or was."" This is how folk music functions; this is what it means. It is as real as anything. The scope of Rosenbaum's work makes it difficult to talk about these volumes in general terms; although this is all ""folk music,"" in the broadest, most earnest sense of the word (see Louis Armstrong: ""All music is folk music. I ain't never heard no horse sing a song""), it's also a gloriously diverse package of styles and eras. (Rosenbaum himself addresses the nomenclature issues in his sharp and graceful introductory essay.) Maybe what's most remarkable is how well Vol. 2 actualizes the (shriveling?) notion of acoustic blues, folk, and gospel music as a malleable oral tradition (""The deep river of song,"" as Alan Lomax put it), destined for splicing and rearranging-- here, over and over, bits and pieces of traditional songs emerge and recede, providing both context and ornament. Even though charting the origins of these fragments is pretty much impossible (and entirely beside the point), it does make the controversy over samples and mash-ups feel heavily foreshadowed, if not kind of moot. Although it's certainly worth consuming whole - give yourself a full, glorious Sunday on the couch-- there are a few unmissable highlights: Otha Cooper and Imogene Riggens' a cappella rendition of ""There's a Man Going Around Taking Names"" (recorded in Athens, Georgia in March 1981) is barely 90 seconds long, but the sadness and seriousness in their voices lingers for weeks, maybe longer. Rev. Willie Mae Eberhart and Sister Fleeta Mitchell (who also appear on Vol. 1 , accompanied here by Eddie Ruth Pringle) offer up a prickly version of ""A Charge to Keep I Have"" (according to Rosenbaum's notes, the melody is moaned so the Devil can't hear it), while Mary Lomax, another star from Vol. 1 , sings ""Billy Staffer"" with unparalleled aplomb-- ""The way my paw used to sing it,"" she explains. Helen McDuffie's ""Talking Blues"" is a textbook example of the kinds of talking blues that inspired Woody Guthrie and later Bob Dylan; Mabel Cawthorne's ""Going Up the Country (Some Kind of Blues)"" features some of the richest (if stubbornly imperfect) piano-playing around, and her vocals-- un-self-conscious, raw, squealing, cracked-- are genuinely riveting. It doesn't require a crack sociologist to understand how America's oral traditions are changing (most of the performers Rosenbaum captures here are of advanced age, and come from relatively rural climes), but there's still something comforting about the notion of a song as a family heirloom (it can never be lost in a fire), and Rosenbaum's work will make you yearn for childhood lullabies, for-- precious as it sounds-- the songs that you keep in your heart.","Atlanta's Dust-to-Digital releases another sweeping, vital 4xCD collection of field recordings.

(a)spera,Mirah,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30aea9e61561daa4bb7/1:1/w_160/32fc1e5e.jpg,2009-03-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12809-aspera/,K,"Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn has played a vital role in the Pacific Northwest's indie scene since releasing her breakthrough album You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This, a 4-track collaboration with fellow analog enthusiast and sad-eyed songwriter Phil Elverum of the Microphones, back in 2000. Since then she's had far more ups than downs, hooking up for collaborations with artists such as Black Cat Orchestra and Tara Jane O'Neil, releasing 2004's outstanding C'mon Miracle, and providing the soundtrack for the excellent political documentary Young, Jewish, and Left. Fittingly for such a skilled lyricist, the title of Mirah's latest solo album, (a)spera, is a play on the Latin words ""asperak,"" which means ""adversity"" and ""a spera,"" which translates as ""hope."" And it's between the fine lines of this double entendre that the roots of this album begin to grow. It encompasses a range of ideas on a grand scale, as the listener wades through her candid musings on unrealized love, death, the nature of time, emotional suffering, and the shedding of material wants. Mirah's songs have always thrived on modest instrumentation, which tend to belie the careful intricacy of their structures, and are often emphasized by one instrument in particular, such as the commanding drumbeats that gave Advisory Committee's wonderful opening track ""Cold Cold Water"" such a fiercely memorable edge. (a)spera keeps the trick rolling, except that in the last few years Mirah has grown markedly as a songwriter and the emphasis is now mostly provided by expansive string orchestrations, bold bursts of horns, and deftly placed vocal harmonies that recall early Cat Power. It's been five years since her last studio release, but from the opening violin flourish of (a)spera's startling opening track, ""Generosity""-- arguably one of the strongest songs she has ever written-- it is clear that Mirah's walking a different path, and whatever route she chose to get there proves to be well worth the wait. Until now, Mirah's most appealing quality as a songwriter has been her immediate intimacy and sincerity, which manifests itself at the center of every song. While these characteristics are more present than ever on (a)spera, they have been taken to another level through the sheer diversity of her choice of instrumentation. She has completely avoided the trap of sounding too repetitive-- a curse of many solo singer-songwriters who have released a few albums-- and instead chooses to employ a different approach to every song. On the Phil Elverum-produced ""Shells"" she drafted the remarkable Mandinka harp player Kane Mathis to provide the soundtrack to her tale of a diver hunting for a dinner of mollusks for a land bound lover. Later, she moves into the intricate, bossa nova-inspired frenzy of ""Country of the Future"", sparse electric guitar interplay on ""Bones & Skin"", and animated conga accents on ""Gone Are The Days"". Not only does each song have a vivid personality of its own, there just isn't a weak track on here-- a mighty feat indeed. (a)spera is the sound of a musician accomplishing the challenges she has set herself, both musically and communicatively. There's an interdependent exchange of significance between the music and lyrics, and their subtle yet compelling message ends up staying with you long after the stereo is switched off.","Latest from Pac NW singer-songwriter is marked by lush sound and diverse instrumentation.

Little Hells,Marissa Nadler,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3109d034d5c69bf2d2e/1:1/w_160/316e3f87.jpg,2009-03-10 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells/,Kemado,"The core of Little Hells-- Marissa Nadler's elegiac and elegant fourth album-- is appropriately wedged in the middle: After moving alongside dual Wurlitzers and a theremin throughout opener ""Heart Paper Lover"", slowly waltzing above a country quartet on ""Rosary"", and augmenting a dark conversation between a man and his tired wife with industrial-iike programming and synths for ""Mary Come Alive"", Nadler settles back into her minimal roots for the next four tunes. During those 14 perfect minutes, it's just her voice and finger-picked acoustic guitar, augmented cautiously by piano, organ, and ripples of electronics. Surrounded by little else but her own melancholy, Nadler sums up her career's existential despair: ""Ghosts and lovers/ They will haunt you for a while,"" she sings. And while they do, Little Hells suggests through 10 of Nadler's best songs yet, the sadness will either kill you or keep you going. Nadler's earlier albums delivered this somberness almost exclusively through songs for acoustic guitar. On those records, her backing musicians seemed intent upon emphasizing the spectral, lost-love tendencies of her words, adding ominous cello shrieks, sinister electric leads, or raggedy lo-fi touches, which found her tagged from the start as a freak-folk artist. As late as her most recent album-- the exquisite breakthrough Songs III: Bird on the Water-- she did little to dispel that categorization, filling the record with archaic language and outsider accompaniment by New England experimentalists like multi-instrumentalist Greg Weeks and cellist Helena Espvall. At last, Little Hells moves Nadler well beyond easy categories, thanks to a newfound clarity in her words, a compelling link between her songs, and production that sharpens her old strengths wheile brightly exposing new ones. Sonically, her reach is wider and more assured. On ""Mary Come Alive"", circular drumming, gauzed vocals, and synthetic harmonium suggest the unlikely union of Cocteau Twins and Swans. Meanwhile, ""Loner"" stacks organ sustains and submerges them beneath Nadler's strum and half-hummed coo. It's like Grouper coming back down the Hill or Valet emerging from the Acid, but more memorable and accessible than both. But the LP's highlight is still the four-song core that recalls vintage Nadler-- now played, captured, edited, and arranged better than in the past. Her only solo turn here, ""Brittle, Crushed & Torn"", is crisp and concise, the presentation revealing the strength of the melodies in her bass-heavy picking and the wispy vocals above. ""The Whole Is Wide"" uses only that voice and Dave Scher's staccato piano march; the simplicity helps the album's most lyrically complex song translate off the page as Nadler intertwines the stories of two women, Sylvia and Laila, who waste their life away in the absence of a man. Nadler swaps first- and third-person pronouns and twists verb tenses, building tension by suggesting that they're both dead or at least headed that way. That time-and-person slipstream is what binds the 10 tracks of Little Hells so well. Nadler mixes images of individuals in various stages of love and loss, often pairing them with imagery of death, decay, and rebirth. What Nadler's done on Little Hells suggests Antony and the Johnson's work on one of the year's other accomplishments, The Crying Light. Hegarty too alternated between thoughts of giving up, getting out, or fighting back. To do that, he eschewed the guests of I Am a Bird Now, choosing to sing with himself through fascinating harmonies, vocal lines intersecting with one another in unexpected patterns. He also expanded his sound in unexpected directions while refining what he'd always done well-- luxuriously layered arrangements-- through subtlety and tension. Nadler does all of that on Little Hells, and-- like Antony-- she's transcended freak folk as a result.","Marissa Nadler's elegant new album is also her most expansive, with production that sharpens old strengths while exposing new ones.

Song of the Pearl,Arbouretum,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e6c0084474cd0c0155/1:1/w_160/c690295f.jpg,2009-03-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12779-song-of-the-pearl/,Thrill Jockey,"Of the eight tracks on Arbouretum's second album and first for Thrill Jockey, 2007's Rites of Uncovering , only four finished their damaged, crunchy, soul-blues sighs in less than four minutes. The others barreled beyond the five, seven, eight, and 11-minute marks, respectively, all powered by the spiraling guitar solos of Dave Heumann. At Rites of Uncovering 's best, Heumann sounded like indie rock's new guitar idol, unpredictably dodging strict meter, melody, and form. Like Jerry Garcia circa 1972, Heumann crested the rhythm section, pulling his outfit through thundering rock and scorching noise. The band was plenty good, you know, except the show belonged to this guy . But of the eight tracks on Arbouretum's third album, Song of the Pearl , only one breaks the six-minute mark (and barely so). What's left of Heumann's guitar heroics have largely been folded into the songs-beneath or between the verses-or truncated so that they no longer comprise the album's apex. Song of the Pearl feels more like the work of a seasoned rock band that's experimenting with textures like strings and piano while focusing the songs with conventional restraints. Thing is, before Song , this quartet only recorded three tracks as a band. On Kale, the band's 2008 split with labelmates Pontiak, the unit's workmanlike stability gave Heumann's ideas room to roam. The promise of those tracks goes largely unfulfilled on Song . Arbouretum becomes less of a trio supporting Heumann and more of a quartet featuring Heumann here. The move doesn't play to Arbouretum's strengths, meaning that-at worst-this hits like a ""jam band"" flatlining through a proper studio session. Like Rites , Song of the Pearl is alternately driving or drifting, anxious or languid. The extremes are less compelling, though, and the bulk of the record feels too staid to be effective. The first four tracks float right by, the band plodding through opener ""False Spring"" and ""Another Hiding Place"". The title track trots in and out at mid-tempo, strings rising swiftly between each line. It's an awkward stumbling block for the song's sidewinding motion, and it leaves little of an impression. The second side is a bit more aggressive, at least, from the italicized beat and strident electric tone of opener ""Thin Dominion"" to the multiple spiraling guitar passes that sprint in every direction during ""Infinite Corridors"". Closer ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" is Arbouretum's best slow number yet, a smoldering reflection for a guitar with strings that sound as if they've been gathering rust for an eon, played through an amplifier sutured with string and scotch tape. Heumann's voice acts just as beleaguered, barely able to wash past the damage. Change often hinges on trade-offs, and Arbouretum's shift from the rangy dynamism of Rites to the stunted kinetics of Song of the Pearl is no different: Though he leads us less with his guitar, Heumann's words are sharper now. On Rites , he felt like a formal poet, filling his verse with forced end-rhymes that reflected allegiance to rules, not song. Heumann relaxes here instead, taking the rhymes when they come but not overreaching. Song 's more considered writing is the record's real payoff. As the band rages through ""The Midnight Cry"", the story of 19th century New England priest William Miller's failed apocalyptic prophecy, Heumann relies on repetition and redundant rhymes to differentiate the verses-- a smart strategy that binds the cascading narrative. On the other hand, Heumann's anxious imagery during ""The Fall Line""-- the collapse of the sun, the evil eyes of wolves, the peering watchman of the moon-- tumbles down without rhyme, meaning our narrator has more pressing worries than propriety. Perhaps praising Heumann's improved writing plays like faint praise, but it's as significant a step in the right direction as tightening the instrumental belt is in the wrong direction. That it took just two years and one album to do both reflects Heumann's ability and desire to take this band anywhere. Movement, after all, made those old guitar solos glorious. You've got to think that, even after this net setback, Arbouretum's best work remains in its future.","Thrill Jockey's Arbouretum tone down both guitar heroics and song lengths while honing lyrics and song structures.

If you're part of Sinden's presumed audience-- young, multicultural, and stimulant-friendly, with omnivorous taste in hook-centric dance music-- you could easily fall in love with his Fabriclive mix. Despite a few clunkers, mostly in an opening stretch of what can only be described as 21st-century hip-house, Sinden collects great cuts from around the world. Like Caper's ""Hybrid"", which pairs a grinding, circa-1997 speed garage bassline and a delicate synth-pad breakdown off a classic ambient jungle tune. An easy contrast between dark and dainty, but one that makes for a great dance record. Shiver inducing, even. Fabriclive 43 is littered with similar small gems. And like all Fabric mixes, Sinden blends them quite adroitly, regardless of country of origin, tempo, or release date. But over the long haul, his top-tier DJ's skillfulness actually proves draining. That's obviously a problem. The disc's momentum is pedal-to-the-floor throughout-- this a very club-centric, peak-time sound. There are few chances catch your breath, just one tightly-wound record slamming into another, and the lack of variation in Sinden's pacing quickly becomes as exhausting in your living room as it would live. Granted, this lack of variation isn't stylistically; Sinden's taste is laudably liberal on paper. But even if you're into furiously-paced dance mixes, you might still wish Sinden had slowed to ask, ""Should I really mix these records together?"" His inclusive aesthetic occasionally strips each subgenre of its idiosyncracies; dubstep really should conjure a different mood than blistering pop-house, not that you'd know it from Fabriclive 43. Sinden's commitment to keeping the party flying at top speed, without sacrificing eclecticism, works best when he sticks to records that emulate the ginormous b-lines and clattering snares of turn-of-the-millennium London. (Roisin Murphy chopped up like an old-school UK garage diva? Count me in.) The digital wobble of the dubstep stretch is Fabriclive 43 at its most gripping, for what it's worth, but Sinden still fixes on the most jittery examples of a notoriously torpor-centric sound. Even when he can stick to one mood, his agitator's instincts get the best of him. Common sense says dance mix is obviously supposed to energize you, the listener/dancer. And Sinden's high-energy antics would obviously keep an adrenaline-charged dancefloor's momentum at a howling peak. But clubbers might stumble for the door after an hour or so, worn down by the relentless channel-surfing between bass-heavy blog favorites. Outside the club, Fabriclive 43 could probably push you through that afterwork gym session or hardcore housecleaning you'd rather avoid. Slogging through it otherwise might be more work than it's worth.","UK producer/DJ mixes French techno with Baltimore club and anything in between.

More than a businessman, lyricist, and guitarist, Franco was a musically innovative bandleader: someone who worked over old traditions, someone who refocused trends through own vision, someone who built genres. In his compositions, Afro-Cuban rumba that always sounded brittle and formulaic to me sounds pliant and flush with possibility. By slowing down a dance rhythm for ""Likambo Ya Nana"", he isn't just writing a slow dance, he's revealing and reengineering where accents in the music fall, he's changing its character and breathing patterns. Other recordings, like ""Kinsiona"", unfold in strange, protracted waltzes filled with the chatter of syncopated percussion-- styles that sound approachable but almost without precedent. The difference isn't between good and bad music, because there's plenty of expertly played music that follows formula-- it's between the work of musical thinkers and of musical entertainers . As far as I can tell, Franco was both. Not that I hush and murmur over Francophonic-- it's not always that poetic. Franco records are, primarily, music for the masses and their asses, even if his arrangements seem to give asses undue philosophical consideration. There's ""AZDA"", which I later found out was used as an ad for a Congolese Volkswagen dealership-- fortunate for them because it's exhaustingly catchy. There are children's choirs and snatches of conversation that remind me of hip-hop skits. He didn't just have a broad ear for great melodies; he had a mind to be sneaky with them, delaying the listener's gratification, stretching tunes out until they wind down somewhere you didn't expect them to. Though I don't know Lingala, I understand, second-hand, that Franco wasn't bad with lyrics, either, punning about how great his band, OK Jazz, was; cataloging the evils lovers do (force-feeding each other feces, apparently); flashing dialects that upset the government; and singing about AIDS just as people started realizing what it was (but after, as most agree, he started dying from it). OK Jazz were full of brilliant musicians and had a slew of vocalists, so Franco's presence can sometimes feel secondary. He sidestepped the center of attention to assume the subtler, more controlling role of directing where the audience's attention would focus. He occasionally sang, but the guitar was his true voice. On some songs-- first to memory is ""Tcha Tcha Tcha de mi Amor""-- his playing suddenly sputters over the arrangement as if to remind his band who the fucking boss is. Francophonic , which spans two discs and the best years of his career, is an essential release, whether you know Franco's music or not, or even whether you know central African music or not. It does the important service of collecting his greatest music released stateside with stuff most of America has never heard.","This innovative bandleader refocused trends and built entirely new genres in his native Congo.

It sounds giddy and spontaneous, though for all I know it could've been recorded the day after McCain claimed ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"" and saved for November 5th. Coming from a rapper who made his name on social contemplation, righteous anger, and battle-rap vengeance, Ali's joy and (guarded) hopefulness in the humbling face of history resulted in a rare but revealing moment of optimism. Question is, how much of that's going to carry into his subsequent work? Being a comparatively small collection of B-sides, outtakes, and new material, The Truth Is Here EP doesn't completely answer that question. Meant to tide fans over until the projected fall release of his follow-up to The Undisputed Truth, The Truth Is Here catches the lingering shockwaves of that 2007 album's fierce momentum, packages them under a title that invokes one of its more defining hooks, and somehow manages to work as an album without giving off that stale odds-and-sods feel. It wouldn't seem the least bit out of place as a pack-in with some theoretical future deluxe edition of The Undisputed Truth: there's a whole lot of beats by his regular producer Ant, who contributes some comfortingly familiar barfly lounge-jazz vibes in the woozy muted horns of ""Real as Can Be"" and the somnambulant last-call piano of the ironically-titled (or at least ironically-sequenced) closer ""Begin Here"", not to mention the usual brand of uptempo, heavy-bumping soul-derived anthems that's permeated Ali's last couple records (""Palm the Joker""; ""The Believers""). And when it comes to subject matter, The Truth Is Here hews pretty closely to its predecessor album's b-boy snapshot of political (and personal) turmoil at the conclusion of the Bush years. And, let's face it, the beginning of the Obama years, too: With the continued expansion of settlements on Israel's West Bank this spring and February's shooting death of a 14-year-old Palestinian stone-thrower by an IDF soldier, Ali's ""Philistine David""-- originally part of the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's 2007 documentary Jimmy Carter Man From Plains-- could've been recorded last month. It could turn out to be one of his most contentious tracks-- which is saying a lot for the man who recorded ""Uncle Sam Goddamn""-- but by stepping into the perspective of a teenage, Palestinian potential suicide bomber and depicting him as a sympathetic figure with understandable (if desperate) motives, he's articulately humanized a struggle in a way most artists have a difficult time doing. Closer to home, ""Little Rodney"" examines the psychological damage that comes with being incarcerated (""Boxed in, dropped in a hole and forgotten/ Frozen to the core of your soul feelin' rotten""), ""Good Lord"" is an introspective, gospel-tinged examination of his Muslim faith, and ""Palm the Joker"" teems with non-specific but interconnected diatribes about an overwhelming sense of urban despair: ""I see a poor victim's face/ Reflected on the pawn shop's glass pistol case/ The breath make it foggy and then it gets clear/ Now which metal here would fit best in the ear?"" These are subjects that aren't just going to trundle down to some Crawford ranch and disappear, so there's no reason to imagine Ali's firebrand politics are going to diminish any-- and if they inexplicably do, there's still his mic-controller pride at stake. Ali's battle-rap bonafides serve as a sort of flipside to his political facet; quite literally, in the case of ""Talkin' My Shit"", since it originally came out as the B-side to one of the limited-edition 12"" pressings of ""Uncle Sam Goddamn"". It's one of those classic Ali trash-talk cuts, mixing self-effacement with hard-assedness-- ""Labels turn me off, I ain't what they lookin' for/ I ain't got a six-pack, tattoo or a bullet hole/ But I'm muscle underneath all that, you get your peanut smacked/ I scrap like Butterbean on crack""-- but it comes across with a vibe of grateful, earned arrogance. There's more of it where that came from-- including the requisite Minneapolis summit with an enjoyably snotty Slug on ""The Believers""-- but it doesn't necessarily dominate. Then again, between the politics, the road anthems, the battle tracks, the gratitude tracks, and the love song (""Baby Don't Go""), no one aspect of Ali's personality really dominates. The Truth Is Here is all the stronger for it, and that can only be considered a good sign.","Collecting B-sides and outtakes along with new material, this EP finds rapper Brother Ali mixing political commentary and shit-talking.

"Mama, I'm Swollen",Cursive,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a31513d19756521389e6/1:1/w_160/0f81ee1d.jpg,2009-03-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12818-mama-im-swollen/,Saddle Creek,"Since the release of their breakthrough album, The Ugly Organ, in 2003, Cursive have taken three-year sabbaticals between recordings. Fans waited until 2006 for Happy Hollow, which showed the quartet developing in leaps and bounds musically while earnestly exploring themes such as the conflict of religion in North American society and the depressing blandness of suburban life. It signaled an enterprising departure for the group, both lyrically and melodically, and seemed to open up abundant possibilities for their future development, as though Cursive could go in any number of directions. So it's a little disappointing that their latest full-length, Mama, I'm Swollen, rarely strays far beyond the most palpable and predictable emo-punk. It's a straight shot of melodramatic misery and despair from beginning to end. During a tour in 2007, original drummer Clint Schnase left Cursive and was replaced by Cornbread Compton of Engine Down, whose fantastic beats really make their mark on Mama, I'm Swollen. Singer Tim Kasher, also of fellow Saddle Creek band the Good Life, has more than proved his mettle as a lyricist in the past. Here he turns his attention to an obsession with hell, the worthlessness of humanity, and the Peter Pan Syndrome of adults who want to ""live life duty free"" (""Cavemen"") or fuck away their fears (""From the Hips""). Kasher's words, like his vocal delivery, veer from whisper to anguished yowl. At times he is on top form, particularly on ""We're Going to Hell"" and ""Mama, I'm Satan"". But lines such as ""I'm at my best when I'm at my worst"" and ""Every record I've written has left me smitten/ It's a career in masturbation"" sound like they belong in a teenager's journal and feel somewhat pathetic coming from the mouth of a 34-year-old-- an opinion that Kasher is no doubt slamming throughout the record in his defense of social nonconformity. All the same, it's a bit humdrum in light of what he's capable of. Musically, Cursive's range is subtler here compared to their previous albums, but there are some satisfying occasions when everything pulls together nicely. Shifting time signatures keep the more straightforward songs from getting dull, and there are plenty of thoughtful guitar hooks interlaced with brass sections, strings, and an intermittent flute. Unfortunately, it's the occasional appearance of these additional instruments that sparks the most excitement while listening to this record. The final song, ""What Have I Done"", a tale of a man holed up in an El Paso motel scratching lyrics on paper plates instead of writing a great novel, turns out to be the album's most memorable track. It impresses with its swell of electronic ambiance, growling bass, and triumphantly dejected chorus as Kasher keeps screaming ""What have I done, what have I done, what have I done!"" until he is out of breath. Considering their devout following, Cursive fans are likely to be divided by Mama, I'm Swollen. There is of course a huge market for their kind of angst-ridden emo, and in many ways-- particularly lyrically-- this album sounds like it's been lifted straight from the emo handbook, which may well satisfy many listeners. For the less committed, however, the lack of the band's usual wit and musical inventiveness will be missed.","After another three-year break, Cursive return with a straight shot of melodramatic misery and despair, leavening the shouty intensity with orchestration.

Ye Viols!,Lithops,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ea13d197565213898f/1:1/w_160/126846e3.jpeg,2009-03-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12782-ye-viols/,Thrill Jockey,"Jan St. Werner always seems to use his Lithops moniker as a conceptual clearing house, fleshing out new ideas on record as he hashes out the ever-shifting sounds of his much beloved, much scrutinized project Mouse on Mars. St. Werner's best Lithops pieces are tightly wound sonic anomalies sparking out of white noise with transient, implied melodies. Unlike the malleable and transilient sounds of Mouse on Mars, Lithops compositions are, almost as a rule, embryonic and fragile ambient works. Ye Viols! plays with the model at its own peril. Ye Viols! compiles St. Werner's recent forays into composition for art installations, with these 11 instrumental narratives forming keenly rhythmic commentaries on a technophile world. Synthesizers flow and loop with urgency, beats arrive promptly on the downbeat, subroutines whir in the background. Each piece visits a different corner of the industrial maze, appealing to Zuckerzeit -era Cluster on ""Graf"" while rushing the listener through factory floors, WWII radio rooms, and gamelan orchestras in ""21. jhrdt"". But for all the ""recombined industrial iconography"" adorning Ye Viols! , its works resist cohesion. The rave-tinged mechanics explored on ""Apps 1"" and ""Apps 2"" fritter along as a sly rejoinder to the sweat of the dancefloor, whereas the following piece, ""Bacchus"", whirs statically like a jet engine. The record ends up a jumble of techno-organic identifiers: Eleven works singing 11 vaguely similar tunes in 11 different keys. The installations that source the compilation reportedly span a number of themes: ""Graf"" accompanied a series of futuristic architectural sketches, whereas ""Bacchus"" soundtracked collages of imagined hybrid life forms. Decontextualized from their sensory environment, the pieces share only a superficial grasp at the wonders of technological innovation. As today's dominant technological upheaval, the Information Age, forces the evolution of music consumption, composers such as St. Werner are (for the better) diversifying their creative output in order to stay relevant. Ironically, while St. Werner has the chance to engage listeners on a new medium, this limited-edition run of 1,000 individually numbered Ye Viols! CDs seems chained to a fast-dying world of shiny discs and brick-and-mortar commodities. The compositions on Ye Viols! can hint at his Lithops' dynamism, but they are tailor-made for the passive participation of art installations, not for home listening. In its greatest and most banal irony, this futuristic package begs for the minor middle-ground of a simple accompanying DVD. As it is, Ye Viols! belongs not in the auspices of Jan St. Werner's varied works, but in a museum gift shop.","Jan St. Werner of Mouse on Mars compiles recent works commissioned to accompany art installations.

May a Lightning Bolt Caress You EP,Aleks and the Drummer,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b9ea9e61561daa4af5/1:1/w_160/fbcddbf2.jpg,2009-03-06 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12743-may-a-lightning-bolt-caress-you-ep/,self-released,"Note to any female singers looking for help from the production hand of TV on the Radio's David Sitek: you may fare better if you can't actually sing. (Or if you're already famous for something else, I guess.) Despite TVOTR's high-and-gaining profile, Celebration's excellent Sitek-produced The Modern Tribe flew under the radar in 2007, and there's nary a peep about Aleks and the Drummer's 2008 EP, May A Lightning Bolt Caress You , outside of the two-piece outfit's native Chicago. A shame, because this band might be the most distinctive of the bunch, pulling equal inspiration from punk and from older traditions. And Sitek's name on the back might actually be his biggest contribution; the band seems to have a pretty clear idea of what its going for here. The percussion-plus-Farfisa combo may read like kitschy carnival-punk territory, but the music of Aleks and the Drummer has its roots in something deeper and thrives on opposing forces. The most prominent of those tensions is the urgency of the music and the graceful, almost mannered voice of Aleks Tomaszewska-- clear and distinct, every syllable exact, soaring and cutting through the clutter while the band stops and starts in fits. ""I Want to Melt His Eyes"" starts out with surf-rock drum patter and B-movie one-finger organ riff. Then the vocals kick in, operatic and melodramatic, muttering the title just once over a musical figure never repeated. It's a fine example of the manic drumming meeting the icy calm of Tomaszewska's voice and organ. Though the melody takes a its share of twists and odd angles, it's still simple and approachable, like a child making up her own nursery rhyme. The two-note shuffle and descending chorus of ""Closer"" is similar in tone, if catchier, featuring an odd break-beat bridge and a rhythm that clangs mercurially behind the simple and stark melody. ""Co Mi Panie Dasz?"", introduced with maximum vocal warble and a concise burst of psychedelia, is a jittery recast of a traditional Polish song, as Tomaszewska's voice goes from recital-ready proper to increasingly desperate. And then on ""Paper Crown and Sugar Shoes"" her breathy vibrato is almost soothing, until the song ascends with the grace and swagger of a 1970s rock-radio dinosaur. While the band's palette of sounds is necessarily small, their melodies and inspirations are unpredictable, and they certainly have a few deft tricks when it comes to rhythm. The drums belong in the most rabid surf-punk outfit, and the Farfisa brings a nervy psychedelic edge, but Aleks Tomaszewska's graceful and powerful vocals are the most assertive element in a duo that juxtaposes old-world melodies with modern post-punk, giving their music a timeless-- or just out-of-time-- feel.","Chicago-based organ/percussion two-piece combines punky energy with the music of Eastern Europe.

Carboniferous,Zu,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d35e6ef959693204eb/1:1/w_160/47050ceb.jpg,2009-03-06 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12765-carboniferous/,Ipecac,"Catching the attention of Ex-Faith No More honcho Mike Patton and being picked to join the ranks of his highly regarded Ipecac label in company with artists such as Melvins, Hella, and the Locust, would be one hell of a high point for the majority of heavy, avant-rock bands currently making music. Zu, one of the most progressive no-wave metal bands ever to come out of Italy, were recruited by Patton for the release of their 14th album, Carboniferous , and one cannot conceive a more fitting home for the trio. Drummer Jacopo Battaglia, saxophonist Luca T. Mai, and bass player Massimo Pupillo, formed Zu in Rome 10 years ago. Since then, aside from releasing records at the rate of more than one per year, the band have toured the world relentlessly (their self-described Black Flag-esque work ethic has motivated them to play over 1,000 live shows), and collaborated with an impressive range of sterling artists such as Hamid Drake, the Ex, Han Bennink, Damo Suzuki, Alvin Curran, and the Stooges' saxophonist Steve MacKay. Given their predilection for ingenious improvisation, combined with the ability to absorb and incorporate an exhilarating variety of musical styles into their material, it is not surprising that Zu often sounds like a hundred bands in one, although the way they piece together their wild sonic jigsaw is unique to them alone. Entirely instrumental except for Patton's guest vocals on ""Soulympics"", Carboniferous veers alternately from free jazz and punk, to sheer metal, math, and hair-raising noise. By the time the album reaches the finish line, there aren't many stones left unturned. It sounds as though Zu have wrung out every last drop from their musical cloth, yet one doubts whether their imagination can possibly run dry. Arguably the most aggressive album the band has ever recorded, Carboniferous is relentless in its volatile ferocity. Any brief moment of calm is torn from limb to limb by a monstrous tide of free jazz or Behemoth-style mania. On a song such as ""Carbon"", Mai's saxophone, the perfect melodic replacement for Zu's lack of vocals, sounds like it is fighting a battle as it screams and struggles against the rhythm section in an effort to set itself free. Other tracks take the listener inside the workings of an industrial factory. ""Chthonian"" and ""Axion"" are so forcefully precise and metallic sounding that it feels as though you are trapped in a steel foundry, narrowly escaping darts of sparks and rivers of molten metal. At times the songs can sound cold, as though they want to keep their distance, refusing to shed any armor. Although this could be a handicap on other albums, it only serves to makes Carboniferous more intriguing. Not exactly an easy ride, it will undoubtedly be too dense, tough, and quite frankly deranged for some listeners to take in. For others, particularly fans of fellow Mediterranean math rockers Uzeda, John Zorn's Cobra improvisations, and all Patton-affiliated projects such as Fantômas and Mr. Bungle, Zu's massive accomplishment will be nothing short of breathtaking.","Mike Patton recruits Italy's most progressive no-wave metal bands (as far as we know) to his eclectic Ipecac roster.

Money Will Ruin Everything: The Second Edition,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f8b1335d7bf16985f7/1:1/w_160/e6633b12.jpg,2009-03-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12794-money-will-ruin-everything-the-second-edition/,Rune Grammofon,"Rune Grammofon's labelhead, Rune Kristoffersen, has business on his mind: It's right in the title of this comp, a follow-up to the first 2xCD + book collection of the same name. Volume 1 marked his label's fifth anniversary, and this one lands just after the 10th. The lengthy and unedited interviews with Kim Hiorthøy included in each book capture Kristoffersen's struggle, not so much to maintain cash flow, as to deal with a product that seems anachronistic. Kristoffersen, who hates compression, doesn't pay much attention to his download business, and isn't so sure how this MySpace thing works, admits that he's a dinosaur. His vision of a record label entails releasing strong, well-packaged albums and hoping people listen to them, and he has a pretty good roster to fulfill that vision. But a crappy CD costs the same $13-20 bucks as a CD by Supersilent, and so when it comes time to offer the fans something grander, Kristoffersen turns out a book like this one-- a for-the-fans collectible, featuring gorgeous pages of cover and sketch art, photo portraits of the artists, and a pair of CDs that collect album tracks and a few unreleased and live cuts. It's smaller than a coffee table book, unlike say, European art label ECM's Sleeves of Desire , a similar self-celebration that now fetches hundreds of bucks on eBay. But at $65, it's strictly a way for collectors to satisfy their passion for the label. No one will buy this just for the music, but that's not to say it isn't a good listen. In 10 years, the label hasn't moved far from its roots: Atmospheric electronica and refined European improvisation still prevail. Kristoffersen sought to stretch the profile with rock/pop acts like Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, and Shining. But here, they both sound more like ecletic art bands. Shining's cover of King Crimson's ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" is crisp and zany, and even the ferocious axework comes with a wink. On her two cuts, Susanna's gorgeous voice and ghostly heartbreak are unmoored from any real-world context. She's also gains much from Helge Sten, the producer whose grave sound helped shape much of the label's catalog. Sten's also a member and the producer of Supersilent, the electro-acoustic quartet that gave the label its first album and remains its strongest act. Supersilent contributes ""C-6.1"", which sounds like an outtake from their last LP, 8 ; strange and engrossing, it also tends to meander. The quartet's members show up on several other cuts, including the opening ""Mono Hum"" by Humcrush, a stately and sentimental improvisation by the duo of Supersilent keyboardist Ståle Storløkken and Food's Thomas Strønen. The sublimely soothing keyboards remind me how often brainy, European art music seems tailormade to charm little kids; see also Phonophani's toy-like electronic piece ""The Atlantic"". But Arve Henriksen, in collaboration with Jan Bang, chips in the even mellower ""No Horizon"", a wisp of a world ambient piece that gives fleeting glances at his falsetto vox and delicate trumpet tone. But before you assume that frowning concentration is the label's signature, acts like Box shred into view: a new supergroup that includes Storløkken, Trevor Dunn, and Scorch Trio guitarist Raoul Björkenheim, they contribute a metalloid freak-out that pairs a diligent guitar riff with deep shocks of keyboards. The Scorch Trio also appears here, with ""Hys"", a power trio jam that smokes but never burns. And Jono El Grande changes things up completely for exactly one track: ""Eva's Horse Dance,"" an avant circus riot featuring garbled vocals, squawking soprano sax, and a whomping beat. The 1960s-slash-70s never died-- but they don't always sound this lively. Though Jono's been with the label a while, he's one of the few surprises on the set. Little new blood has appeared on the roster since the last Money Will Ruin Everything five years ago; outliers like Jono El Grande or MoHa! (not featured here) don't exactly refresh a label that started with folks like Supersilent, Maja Ratkje, and Arne Nordheim. Growth and riches were never on Kristoffersen's agenda-- he's not kidding about the album title-- but he also refrains from making a grand artistic statement, or shaping (or pruning) the nebulous field of improvised electronic art music. But the book's ultimate point is clear: Rune Grammofon remains a primarily Norwegian, primarily excellent label built entirely on the tastes of its owner. And his is a brand we can still count on.","This outstanding experimental Norweigian label celebrates its 10th anniversary with a 2xCD + book collection.

Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6,Madlib,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ddb1335d7bf16985b9/1:1/w_160/67f5d7d9.jpg,2009-03-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12772-beat-konducta-vol-5-6/,Stones Throw,"Another month, another meditation on the legacy of James Yancey. It's been three years since Yancey's untimely death and his grip on the imagination and inspiration of hip-hop artists still hasn't loosened-- and somehow, for the most part, hasn't crumbled into exploitative shamelessness. You can chalk that up to most of the tribute-paying artists-- Q-Tip, Common, Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli, ?uestlove, Erykah Badu, damn near every hip-hop artist in Detroit-- having known and respected the man on a collaborative level (and, in the case of Yancey Boys' Illa J, as family). Madlib's own personal musical tribute to Dilla is particularly faithful: They were two producer-MCs who had forged a mutual stylistic compatibility, one that began with beat-tape trading by mail and resulted in the underground classic Champion Sound, and in that album's wake they both wound up inspiring and pushing each other to expanded vistas. Donuts might have sounded like a drastically different album without the choppy, grimy aesthetic of The Unseen and Madvillainy's production mind as a creative sparring partner, and Madlib's early Beat Konducta work, the creation of which ran largely parallel to the construction of Donuts, benefited greatly from his study of Dilla's meticulous drum and bassline construction. Among all the things that were lost to hip-hop heads with Dilla's passing, the possibility of future collaborations and stylistic cross-pollinations between these two beatmaking auteurs was one of the most significant. As an elegy, a payment of a gratefully-acknowledged artistic debt and an expansion of one man's sound, the fifth and sixth volumes of Madlib's Beat Konducta series are a stirring culmination of everything Dilla did to affect Madlib as a musician. Granted, there's little mistaking it for anyone other than Madlib: There's a constant volley of vocal snippets, lyrical and otherwise, that fit his thematic blend of fragmented quasi-narrative and off-kilter humor. Plus, his restless, loop-jostling production style is instantly-recognizable here in one of its most dubbed-out, bass-heavy and atmospherically THC-soaked incarnations yet. Still, the Dilla influence is clearly evident in a number of ways, especially the way vocals are chopped and truncated to serve as melodic hook, percussive exclamations, and reconstructed grooves for several tracks, as well as the recurring presence of that weighty, synthesized bass Dilla loved to lace his tracks with. And there's a few other flourishes-- like the air-raid siren that popped up every so often on Donuts, or the ""Make It Funky"" clip of James Brown saying ""I don't know"" used on the Slum Village track of the same name-- that range from obvious nods to what seem like elaborate in-jokes between friends. At 42 tracks stretched across 67 minutes, this looks a bit like an unwieldy collection of fleeting ideas when the tracklisting's all splayed out in front of you. And it's a bit difficult to get a firm grasp on everything, even after several listens: There's just so many ideas Madlib's managed to cram into even the shortest minute-long loop that it's hard to point to a particular track and highlight its characteristics without taking the rest of the album into account. There's some particularly inspired standout moments that'll stick with you: the soul strings that get hacked up into hiccupping, off-beat tics on ""The String (Heavy Jones)""; the way ""The Get Over (Move)"" actually welds the guitar riff from the Buzzcocks' ""Boredom"" to an archetypal Yancey boom-clap and somehow makes it make sense; the muffled/smothered beats on ""Smoked Out (Green Blaze Subliminal Sounds)"" where nothing's clear or amplified except a persistent tambourine slap. But this isn't an album that benefits from a track-by-track dissection or a thorough inventorizing, even if the bulk of the beats sound attention-grabbing enough when they pop up as individual moments in a divorced, shuffle-mode context. More than any other collection of semi-instrumental productions Madlib's assembled, the combined Dil Cosby Suite and Dil Withers Suite is a complete work. The best way to listen to this album is to throw it on, zone out and keep your finger away from the controls, letting the rhythmic detours and left-field segues sneak up on you before dissolving into the next beat (abetted, every so often, by some sparse but well-placed scratches from guest turntablist J-Rocc). Before long you'll click with its flood of sounds and ideas and emotions, and the everywhere-at-once scope-- mournful and celebratory, solemn and comedic, starting from soul and circulating its way through every other vein of hip-hop production structure. Three years later, after all the eulogies for Dilla, this record stands as one of the most meaningful.","Madlib pays tribute to the late J Dilla, a producer with whom he created the classic Champion Sound.

Songbook,Woodpigeon,by: Kasia Galazka,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2afea9e61561daa4ae1/1:1/w_160/b72bccb9.jpeg,2009-03-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12734-songbook/,End of the Road,"I imagine Woodpigeon founder and frontman Mark Hamilton has a good heart, saw especially exotic animals in clouds as a child, and probably doesn't watch ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"". Listening to the Canadian band's debut Songbook , an earnest bundle of hushed folk-pop, you can't help but picture Hamilton tossing cards into an upside-down empty hat when he's sad. The album's large cast-- human and instrumental-- makes the otherwise tinny songs sound more plush, but its loosely wound orchestration too often feels flimsy. Sillily enough, Hamilton's first band, which formed in Scotland, went by the moniker Woodpigeon Divided by Antelope Equals Squirrel. Upon returning home to Canada, W/A=S was multiplied by an antelope and deducted a squirrel, leaving him with Woodpigeon, a word he adores and maintains looks like a rollercoaster when written in cursive. This simple, unabashed admiration is apparent throughout Songbook; the eight-member band, which occasionally (and daintily) slurps in additional members to fiddle with lap steels, glockenspiels, and flutes, isn't ashamed to sound pretty. Amid the piano toddles and chiming bells reside sentiments like ""Why must love play games with geography?"" and overlapping lines ""I listen for your footsteps/ Never come""-- lyrics indicative of Hamilton's admirable skills to keep his melancholy in high spirits. His wistfulness is interrupted with the ""Death by Ninja (A Love Song)"", a light-hearted lullaby about going to ninja school, then continues on its maudlin way. Though Woodpigeon's arrangements are more bashful than those of Sufjan Stevens, they have a few things in common. Hamilton is undoubtedly prolific, extracting these 14 songs (even borrowing from ""Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing"", the same hymn Stevens covers for one of his Christmas collections) but writing in his press release that he's got about 100 others waiting to be picked for the next team. Both share a tendency to have the occasional long song title (though Stevens' word count has got Woodpigeon beat 53 to 12 with the second track of Illinoise , which iTunes finds intolerable). But where Stevens succeeds with lushness and excessive punctuation, Songbook 's lack of cohesion becomes clear in the orchestral arrangements that more often than not dwarf Hamilton's timid voice. Even the band's feathered harmonies feel like more of a crutch than an embellishment throughout. A handful of the songs could have been sheared off to make the album tighter, allowing less room for what sound like haphazard arrangements. To echo the title of their closing track, that was good, Woodpigeon, but you can do better.","Hushed folk-pop with orchestral flourishes and the occasional whimsically long song title mark this Calgary band's debut.

Selected + Collected: An eMusic Selects Compilation,Various Artists,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f9c0084474cd0c0186/1:1/w_160/9299171e.jpg,2009-03-05 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12795-selected-collected-an-emusic-selects-compilation/,eMusic,"It's hard to expect much from a compilation album. The ratio of great songs to filler is usually pretty low. Rarely do the tracks have anything to do with one another, save their performers' political affiliations. And the songs rarely give context to one another by being collected together. But because they are usually thrown together to raise money for a charity or salute a musical hero, it feels mean-spirited to critique them. Selected + Collected , however, doesn't have that problem-- or those teflon advantages. It's a business venture, a collection of eMusic Selects acts-- favorite unsigned or rising bands that the online retailer features once a month-- designed to celebrate the program's first anniversary and lend the assembled acts a little bit of exposure. And as such, being brutal seems fair. Fortunately (or unfortunately, if you're the sort who loves to read scathing reviews), that isn't necessary; the album is a charming surprise. (Full disclosure: eMusic is one of our retail partners.) Selected + Collected proves eMusic editors deserve a pat on their backs for their astute curatorial efforts. Case in point: San Francisco's Girls, a breakout band who haven't even released an album. Rarely does a song earn a seven-minute run time. And it's even more rare when that song has just a handful of repeated lyrics. But Girls' ""Hellhole Ratrace"" (which snuck in at number 100 on Pitchfork's list of the best tracks of 2008) stokes the impatience for the band's debut with its layers of dreamy fuzz, gooey backing vocals, and strummy acoustic guitar that's punctuated by echoing sleigh bells and handclaps. Joining the hard-to-Google band (and 14 others) on this comp are recent Best New Music recipients the Pains of Being Pure At Heart. For those who have already worn out the grooves on their recent full-length and are jonesing for new songs, there's ""Kurt Cobain's Cardigan"", which showcases the exuberant yet nostalgic lo-fi pop brilliance that made their album one of the first must-buys of 2009. Not all the tracks assembled here are new or previously unavailable, but with so many of the collection's artists releasing albums either on their own or through tiny independent labels without widespread distribution, they may all seem new to you. Rademacher's standout ""If U Got Some Magic"", for example, is taken from the band's 2007 full-length debut, Stunts , but its appearance here will have you kicking yourself for ignoring the smart, sprawling piano anthem for more than a year now. Mostly Selected + Collected is a rock and pop collection, but its two forays into other genres are so good that you'll wish there were more. ""Buttermilk""-- the collection's lone hip-hop contribution-- is a welcome burst of rhythm, falling victim neither to groovy backpacker clichés nor tough-guy braggadocio. The funky, female-sung hook that the track is built on adds a soulful, vintage dimension to Queens MC Homeboy Sandman's melodic flow and sparse arrangement. And despite the glaring throat-clearing that mars Victoire's dreamy fantasia ""A Door into the Dark"" halfway through, it is a pleasingly accessible entrée into the world of modern pseudo-classical music (or perhaps it's just a particularly baroque piece of instrumental chamber pop). There's a lot more to like on this overstuffed album, too. Man/Miracle's ""Pushing and Shoving"" sounds like David Byrne sitting in with the messy, insistent rhythm section of the Velvet Underground while playing ""Heroin"". She Keeps Bees' ""Bow"", with its simple, fierce guitar chug, economical drumming, and abrupt ending, sounds like the Pretenders doing rockabilly. My Teenage Stride's ""Weirder Nightmare"" wraps hooky, horn-studded 1960s pop in layers of very modern-sounding feedback. And Glasser's ""Apply"" marries tribal percussion to an otherworldly synthesized drone and a strikingly clear female vocal, which easily maneuvers from jazzy trilling to guttural squeaks, grunts, and Yoko Ono-like ululations. There are few misses, and even those are worth a listen. Rick Froberg, of Drive Like Jehu and Hot Snakes fame, is easily this collection's biggest ""star,"" but as an introduction to his new band Obits, ""Light Sweet Crude"" isn't the best first impression. Coming on like a sexy-voiced Stones fan hell-bent on a sloppy garage makeover, Obits get the snarled, gritty vocals right, but their repetitive, strangely spare music lacks the requisite swagger. And while it is definitely enough to pique listeners' curiosity for the band's forthcoming Sub Pop debut, it doesn't stand out in such elevated company. That is nitpicky criticism, though, of an album that is so uniformly enjoyable and surprisingly filler-free. One can only hope that, like the similar series curated by UK record shop Rough Trade, the bigwigs at eMusic make Selected + Collected an annual celebration.","The online retailer gathers the best of their Selects choices into a handy CD-sized collection.

Glider,The Sight Below,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b6b1335d7bf169855c/1:1/w_160/aab80e5c.jpeg,2009-03-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12741-glider/,Ghostly,"The style of ambient techno that Wolfgang Voigt (Gas, Burger/Ink) minted has proved to be massively influential. It gave us the Field, who leans heavily on the techno side of the Gas aesthetic, arranging pithy scraps of musical information into deathless pulsations. It also gives us Seattle's the Sight Below, a mirror image of the Field. Burying the thump and emphasizing the ambiance, Glider could have been marketed as a lost Gas album while raising only the most initiated eyebrows. It's a cunning facsimile, but a facsimile nonetheless. Luckily, Glider gets by just fine on the sensual pleasure of Voigt's style. And there is a key distinction: While Voigt worked mostly with samples, the Sight Below creates his tracks with autonomously generated sounds. Running a guitar through a variety of looping, reverb, and delay stations, he uses the E-bow, the slide, and tentative picking techniques to circumvent the physical essence of the strings and to marshal clouds of edgeless tone. Only the 4/4 drum tracks-- consisting of cymbal snips, crisp snares, and hypnotic bass bumps-- keep these translucent songs from floating away. The Sight Below's emphasis on melodic and rhythmic regularity makes his music serene and contemplative; it also creates a limitation. This is largely static work, with very little by way of build or release. Ideas presented near the beginning of each track tend to vary only cosmetically, then peter out. Some songs are extremely abstract: On ""At First Touch"", a continuous sub-tone breathes out long, celestial resonances for a few minutes, then gently rocks to a stop. The gusty, towering ""Without Motion"" describes itself accurately. The tracks where palpable textures are admitted tend, naturally, to be more engaging. On ""Dour"", fragments of discernible guitar glint through the streaming haze; on ""Life's Fading Light"", they seem to pull backwards against the pneumatic beat and atmospheric hum. Glider 's derivativeness and inertia put a cap on its capacity to astonish, but it has a protracted shelf life. It's consummate mood music, which goes a long way toward compensating for its shortcomings. And the more I listen, the more esoteric divergences from Gas I start to perceive-- a different personality shining through, aloof and expansively pensive. Voigt alleged that he wanted to ""bring the forest to the disco""-- the Sight Below lines up behind the velvet rope arm-in-arm with the sky.","Seattle artist inverts the minimal techno aesthetic of Gas-- burying the thump and emphasizing the ambience.

The Law of the Playground,The Boy Least Likely To,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f0b1335d7bf16985e5/1:1/w_160/8dcfe570.jpg,2009-03-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12787-the-law-of-the-playground/,+1,"Childhood isn't kids' stuff. Like Tom Cruise, or life in Hobbes' state of nature, it can be nasty, brutish, and short. Language that would make Rahm Emanuel or a ""South Park"" writer blush. Intolerance enough to have Rush Limbaugh sound like Gandhi. A mini shock'n'awe campaign of child-on-insect violence. And, every now and then, brief glimpses of nudity. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. UK twee-poppers the Boy Least Likely To didn't disappear after 2005 debut The Best Party Ever reclaimed the schoolyard. But their vividly imagined mix of whimsy and melancholy has attracted a magic-threatening share of the spotlight. A steady drip of TV, film, and retail licensing for single ""Be Gentle With Me"", originally released in 2003, culminated (so far) with a Coca-Cola commercial during this year's Academy Awards broadcast. At the same time, in a world where Noah and the Whale exist, hipper-than-thou tastes have shifted back toward harsher, rougher sounds, or else impossibly perfect Auto-Tune chart-pop. Boy will be Boy. Delayed by record-label collapse, sophomore album The Law of the Playground evokes a nostalgia that has as much to do with those innocently optimistic days before financial meltdown, fake celebrity Twitter posts, and Hipster Runoff as with lazy summers. This still isn't kids music. But TBLLT's child's-eye perspective on English anorak pop, sunny West Coast harmonies, Belle and Sebastian-y folk, country, and soul, is now certifiably... theirs, just theirs. Dexys Midnight Runners-like strings join banjo, recorder, handclaps, synths, and glockenspiel. If the enchantment has weakened a smidge, the craft-- and the extreme cuteness-- sure haven't. TBLLT have covered both George Michael and the Field Mice; their own best songs combine the former's chart-conquering populism with the latter's practically mind-expanding wimpiness. ""I've got puppy powers,"" TBLLT lyrical and vocal half Jof Owen murmurs on current single ""Every Goliath Has Its David"", as multi-instrumentalist/composer Pete Hobbs wields birthday-party orchestration like a giant-killing slingshot. Yet whether on gung-ho opener ""Saddle Up"", or self-pep-talk ""When Life Gives Me Lemons I Make Lemonade"", fear and neurosis almost always undermine the cheery arrangements. It's an old move, not just for these guys, but on advance download-only single ""I Box Up All the Butterflies"", with its twang and ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" oompah, TBLLT give gnawing insecurity a welcome charm. After ""the birds and the bees"" beset Owen when he's being entomologically cruel, dude reaches a koan-like understanding on acoustic ballad ""The Worm Forgives the Plough"", itself halfway between Sarah Records indie and Weezer's Pinkerton ""Butterfly"". Harmonica- and glockenspiel-led ""Stringing Up Conkers"" juxtaposes grown-up body image problems with... shoving pencils up your nose. Self-referentiality adds to The Law of the Playground 's sense of déjà vu even as it lets the band try new angles on familiar themes. ""The Boy Least Likely To Is a Machine"" is a sad scientist's-workshop concept-song... sort of their ""Dr. Carter""; brassy swooner ""The Boy with Two Hearts"" could be the duo's autobiography (with its accompanying anxieties) or a love song (with its accompanying anxieties); ""The Nature of the Boy Least Likely To"" slows down and stretches out, fighting the same demons as The Best Party Ever 's ""The Battle of the Boy Least Likely To"". An old Calvin & Hobbes Sunday strip has been making the rounds again lately. Calvin tries to sell Susie Derkins lemonade, overcharges her because of ""demand"" for an exorbitant salary, uses sludge water to cut costs, goes to mom for a bailout when Susie won't buy. As strong and unusual as The Law of the Playground is, especially out of step in 2009, it never quite feels as inspired, as fraught with conflicted beauty, as past songs ""Paper Cuts"" or ""Be Gentle With Me"" or ""Monsters"". But that doesn't mean melody, harmony, and earnest self-expression of the funny pathos of being human are any less relevant this year than they were in 2005. ""I'm still as stupid as I was before,"" Owen sings on poignant finale ""A Fairytale Ending"".","English band follows The Best Party Ever with more sunny harmonies and anorak pop.

Frontier,Rio en Medio,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc5c0084474cd0c2d8d/1:1/w_160/afd0647d.jpeg,2009-03-05 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12751-frontier/,Manimal Vinyl,"If you believe the back story, Danielle Stech-Homsy, the daughter of a costume designer/flamenco dancer mother and a gay Syrian painter/set designer father, had no intention of releasing her first album, The Bride of Dynamite . That is, until while living in (where else?) Brooklyn, she was approached by (who else?) a curious and enthusiastic Devendra Banhart, who introduced Rio en Medio to the world via his Gnomonsong imprint. The rest, as they say, is indie history, at least for the handful of folks turned on to Stech-Homsy's quirky brand of bricolage. If The Bride of Dynamite was a product of private experimentation and serendipity, Frontier is more considered. Recorded in Stech-Homsy's native and current home of New Mexico, the project supposedly began as a series of poems, which she subsequently fleshed out and expanded into songs. That non-musical literary foundation thus frees her up to design soundscapes sympathetic to her words, but the process doesn't affect the results too obviously. If someone said Stech-Homsy began with the sounds and added the words as an afterthought, that would likely fly, too. Frontier may have been recorded in New Mexico, but at times it sounds like it was mixed on another planet. The basis for most of the songs is frequently a simple guitar pattern (or perhaps baritone ukulele, her axe of choice) and Stech-Homsy's hushed voice, but overdubbed are various found-sound samples, synth squiggles, and a host of other intrusions, sometimes very much at odds with the ghostly mood but somehow still complementary to the tone Stech-Homsy means to convey. Is ""The Umbrella"", for example, a spooky folk song enhanced by synthesizers and a mournful (fake?) trumpet, or is it a strange synthesizer track enhanced by the folky underpinning? Are the quiet static clicks, choral effects, and whale cries of ""The Diamond Wall"" intended as kitsch, invoking a scratchy sound-effects LP from grandma's basement, or are they meant to accent the melodramatic and oddly anachronistic orchestral elements, like Popul Vuh updated for the sampler age? (Eight-minute closer ""The Visitor"" all but demands its own Herzog film.) Yet Stech-Homsy is also capable of relatively conservative folk of the stately British school. Indeed, were it not for the minimal pitter-patter of programmed percussion, ""Standing Horses"" could be a lost Vashti Bunyan track. Likewise ""The Last Child's Tear"". The title track, however, is pure psychedelic collage, while ""Fall Up"" approaches reserved electro-pop. ""The Light House"" sometimes sounds literally phoned in, as if from another dimension. Almost all these tracks go on a little too long, yet hide too many surprises-- like the backing vocals that burst into the hypnotic ""Nameless""-- to warrant cutting anything short. These perplexing musical contradictions help keep Frontier -- even at its most indulgent or confounding-- captivating and sometimes fascinating. If the album never quite sets, like a sculpture that refuses to dry, there's little doubting Stech-Homsy's dedication to her particularly inscrutable vision. Part cosmic fun house, part haunted house, it keeps you on your toes, waiting to see if the next song will amuse you, entrance you, or scare you silly. Or all three.","Part cosmic fun house, part haunted house, Danielle Stech-Homsy's sophomore release began as a series of poems.

All Y'All,Gringo Star,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2bbb1335d7bf1698568/1:1/w_160/df269ebf.jpeg,2009-03-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12745-all-yall/,My Anxious Mouth,"It's not fair to judge a band by its moniker. If it were, even more great but stupidly named groups would fall by the wayside than do already. Even so, ""Gringo Star"" brings to mind no less than a novelty Tex-Mex Beatles cover band, and that's asking for trouble. (In my conception, Gringo is joined on stage by Juan, Pablo, y Jorge, each donning a sharp suit and wearing a lucha libre mask.) Granted, Gringo Star is already a better name than A Fir-Ju Well, the former nom de rock of the Atlanta band (a play on the last name of band brothers Peter and Nicholas Furgiuele). So that's progress. Yet Gringo Star aren't about progress so much as stylized regression to the expertly captured golden age of garage and British Invasion rock. In fact, it's easy to imagine catching Gringo Star one night and leaving persuaded you've witnessed the second coming. This kind of stuff-- packed with hooks, propelled by larger than life swagger-- tends to make converts when it's blasting in your face, and the band is doing everything in its power to make you pay attention. So: hooks, attitude, and a dead-on 1960s aesthetic-- what's not to like? On its otherwise solid debut, All Y'All , Gringo Star pretty much reveal everything you're going to get on the lead title track, which features all the usual 60s hallmarks and accoutrements-- handclaps, tambourine, tight harmonies, a thrilling riff here, a twangy lead there, a short but snarling solo tossed into the middle of it all-- each expertly shaped and assembled by producer Ben Allen into a perfect period reproduction. Then the band does it again with ""Ask Me Why"". And again with ""Up and Down"". And again with the infectious ""Come On Now"". And so on. After just a few songs in it begins to dawn upon you: this is good stuff, catchy and hyper-confident, but is it enough? More to the point, does it need to be? Expectations lowered, or at least tempered, what's left is to simply enjoy the disc as the throwback that it is, as if it were the first disc of a hypothetical boxed set that captures a band's early days before it gets even better. That the particular parallel band in this instance happens to be the Kinks doesn't necessarily do Gringo Star any favors, since lyrically the Gringos don't connect as easily as the guitars do. When the tempos slow, as they do on ""Transmission"", the words become more apparent, and while the reveal offers nothing to be ashamed of, it's a far cry from the wit and bite of Ray Davies. If it's unfair to judge a band by its name, it's just as unfair to judge a band by its primary influence, particularly that one influence. But when a band all but demands the comparison, it's setting itself up to fall short. After all, to attempt to match the Kinks is a losing proposition, since at best you're going to come close enough to emphasize how far you still are. Working in the band's favor, however, is the fact that (for the time being) Gringo Star exists and the Kinks do not, so every time the band hits the stage it can rest assured that in the uncontested Gringo Star/Kinks live showdown, Gringo will always end the night triumphant. The songs are strong, but it's the sweat that will need to do the convincing.","Atlanta band-- working here with Animal Collective producer Ben Allen-- crafts its own version of British Invasion rock.

Surf City EP,Surf City,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ba9d034d5c69bf2c7c/1:1/w_160/535f6a86.jpeg,2009-03-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12744-surf-city-ep/,Morr,"Once upon a time, New Zealand produced dozens of great guitar bands, from the Clean to the Dead C. They almost seemed to produce more bands than the tiny South Pacific paradise knew what to do with, and certainly more than one might expect a nation outnumbered by its livestock to be able to support. For all we know, the island is still awash in just as many excellent acts but, without a label like the currently less-than-prominent Flying Nun to serve as a filter or point the way, fewer New Zealand bands than ever are making their way to ears outside the Antipodes. Surf City, a Kiwi band formed by Davin Stoddard and Josh Kennedy and formerly known as Kill Surf City (and before that, the Fibs), sound like they spent a good deal of time studying Flying Nun's initial output of awesomeness, especially the Clean. A quarter-century after the release of the ""Tally Ho"" single, the Clean remains New Zealand's indie-rock standard-bearer, and Surf City's ability to channel that group's punky psychedelic pop is impressive. Indeed, 25 years ago, just about any of the songs on Surf City's debut EP could have been ""Tally Ho"", too-- or, caught up during that initial Flying Nun flurry, at least ""Tally Ho! Part 2"". ""Headin' Inside"" begins with the twang of surf guitar before congealing into a fuzzy guitar rush, with what sounds like a recorder echoing the Clean's rinky-dink Casio and the massed vocals and giddy shouts of ""1-2-3-4!"" hearkening back even further to punk's formative years. The simple but effective melodies of ""Records of a Flagpole Skater"" (this time there's an actual rinky-dink keyboard) and ""Dickshaker's Union"" (which recalls the shimmering glory of early Chills) keep the throttle on the way-back machine firmly engaged. Not surprisingly, ""Canned Food"" and ""Mt Kill"" don't break from form. The latter blends perfectly into ""Free the City"", which, if you're not paying attention, could fool you into thinking it's actually the anthemic second half of the same song. Needless to say, it's 2009, not 1981. But Surf City's backwards-looking NZ rock comes off not redundant but absolutely charming. Even at a brisk and easy-to-miss 20 minutes, the six-song EP provides pure pop nostalgia but also a reminder of what some may have missed the first time around. Heck, even the disc's brevity feels like a throwback, as does the fact that this set of rousing guitar-pop sounds like it could have been recorded in an actual garage. All that's missing is the crackle of vinyl for the illusion to be complete. How far the group can take its second-hand facsimile is another matter entirely, but for the time being, Surf City's pleasure for pleasure's sake approach already has me pining for more.","A New Zealand band paying tribute to Kiwi bands of the past, Surf City are a glorious throwback with a sense of purpose.

Black Moses / Juicy Fruit (Disco Freak),Isaac Hayes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf713d197565213b436/1:1/w_160/f6f9a86d.jpeg,2009-03-04 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12760-black-moses-juicy-fruit-disco-freak/,StaxStax,"During my first years out of college, I hung out every week at a friend's apartment in Midtown Memphis. Like most college grads' first apartments, the place was sparsely furnished and barely decorated-- an old couch, a few Salvation Army chairs, a desk lined with neurobiology textbooks. There was one effort at wall art, the LP cover of Isaac Hayes'  Black Moses  , which folded out into a cross with the singer-- clad in a Biblical caftan and sunglasses-- holding out his hands not in a crucifixion, but in blessing. The actual LPs stayed in their paper sleeves next to his TV, but from that place of honor on the wall, the apostle of funk-- one of Memphis' patron saints-- looked down upon us benevolently through many parties and late nights. It became so totemistic to this circle of friends that the music and the artwork are completely inseparable in my mind. I'm happy to report that Stax's new reissue of Black Moses , unlike the initial CD release in 1990, retains that original foldout packaging. It may be glossy instead of the matte finish I remember, and it may be CD-sized instead of the full LP measurements, but it still folds out into a cross, smaller but still somehow holy. In this case, the packaging for this album remains particularly important, not because of my personal attachment to it nor as a reminder that pop's material culture is slowly disintegrating in the digital age. Black Moses was at that point one of the most elaborate LP packages issued for a black artist and as such represented a show of faith that Hayes, fresh off the unprecedented success of the Shaft soundtrack in 1971, could command sales to rival those of his white contemporaries. And like that foldout cross, it was a massively ambitious statement album, a collection of covers and originals that documented the collapse of Hayes' marriage. It was an enormous success, lodging at #1 on the black charts for seven long weeks. The album title was not simply a glorifying nickname, but a sort of prophecy. Hayes led his people not to a promised land (racial relations in America during the 1970s were so complex and heated as to make any such place almost impossible to visualize) but to a freer musical sensibility that emphasized synthesis: rock, funk, disco, and new strains of soul music marked by elaborate arrangements and lengthy running times. Black Moses is brashly, lushly, and lovingly orchestrated, each track piled high with soundtrack strings, insistent horns, tender flutes, sultry back-up singers, and of course lots of wakka-chikka guitars, a Hayes signature. As far out as he got, Hayes always stayed rooted in pop music. Most of these songs are covers: Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"" a moody, pleading reminiscence; Bacharach-David's ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" a slow burn; the Jackson 5's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" a dramatic testimony; Little Johnny Taylor's ""Part-Time Love"" a breathless groove; the Motown hit ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" a luscious jam. ""Good Love"", the lone Hayes original here, may be a minor horndog proposition, but in this context it sounds like a knowing smirk: ""We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin,"" he intones in the intro. ""Let all the young women crowd around before the news begins."" Some of the joy of listening to Black Moses is hearing Hayes explode these songs from the inside, unpacking their groove potential yet leaving them recognizable. ""(They Long to Be) Close to You"" had already been a hit for the Carpenters and has since become a key exemplar of 70s pop cheese, but Hayes anchors it to a laidback drumbeat, adds the Hot Buttered & Soul singers in the background, and unfolds it into a nine-minute jam. It's startling to hear him sing the opening lines-- ""Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?""-- in his supremely honeyed bass, but he gives the song a straight reading. At the time some critics derided these songs as aimless and self-glorifying, and Hayes' ornate orchestrations still carry a whiff of kitsch, but Black Moses remains unapologetic, often moving, and always entertaining. Stax is also reissuing Hayes' 1976 album, Disco Freak (Juicy Fruit) , accompanied by a similarly over-the-top packaging. The cover shows him shirtless in a pool blowing a kiss to the camera while surrounded by a bevy of fruit-draped beauties. Open the gatefold to see the women's feet with panties 'round their ankles. That packaging, likewise, is important: It may be the most interesting aspect of this album, which reveals Hayes' weaknesses just as surely as Black Moses reveals his considerable strengths. It begins with three full minutes of barely intelligible chatter, as Hayes and friends chat up a woman in the studio. By the time the clamor bleeds into the title track, you may have already tuned it out. Fortunately, ""Disco Freak"" saves it by immediately establishing an elastic groove complete with gasping guitar licks, throbbing basslines, and a bridge that goes ""Juicy Fruit sure is cute in her sexy jumpsuit."" This is Hayes in full disco mode, as the title makes clear, yet he never sounds quite as comfortable here as he does with the expansive hybrid soul covers of Black Moses . Hayes, who had written many of Stax's biggest hits, penned all of these songs himself, but here the Bacharach-David influence becomes clear-- and clearly curbs his audacity. The choruses of ""The Storm Is Over"" and ""Lady of the Night"" sound too smoothly polished to be very uplifting or seductive (the latter is particularly ridiculous), and upbeat numbers like ""Music to Make Love By"" and ""Thank You Love"" slip too easily from horny funk into a sort of lite jazz, without the urgency or drama of his best work. Hayes sounds comical, a humorless, one-dimensional ladies' man rather than the wounded romantic of Black Moses. This is not where he promised to lead us.","Two reissues-- one that finds Hayes at his orchestral soul peak and a lesser-known disco excursion.

SpaceShipp,J Spaceman and Matthew Shipp,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c65e6ef959693204c6/1:1/w_160/325eda42.jpeg,2009-03-04 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12754-spaceshipp/,Treader,"From the first recordings of Spacemen 3 in 1984 to last year's sixth Spiritualized album, Jason Pierce-- known sporadically during the last quarter century as J Spaceman-- has never seemed settled. On his ragged teenage recordings, Pierce pitted walking with Jesus against dropping some drugs and howled the fixing-to-die blues when he wasn't moaning resignation to his depressed existence. One year after Spacemen 3 released their benchmark cosmic rock album, The Perfect Prescription , the band busied itself with turning a London arts center into a recreation of La Monte Young's Dream House , issuing a 90-minute drone that caused-- according to one review-- mixed indignation and awe. Similarly, Spiritualized vacillated between the 100-plus musicians who contributed to Let It Come Down and the smaller ensembles that finished Pierce's subsequent records. Sessions with jazz improvisers, orchestrations with massive choirs, electric oblivion with a rock trio: Instability and its inspiration have linked the Spaceman's discography from the start. So Pierce's dismissal of ""Soul on Fire""-- the glorious pop-gospel triumph at the top of last year's Songs in A&E , the band's first LP since 2003-- shouldn't have surprised anyone. ""I didn't want that on the album,"" Pierce told me last June in a Pitchfork interview. ""I'm constantly fighting with this thing inside of me that says I should be sitting in a room with Matthew Shipp, or I should have Han Bennink on drums, or this song should be playing for the next 20 minutes in my head, not a silly little pop song."" Just two years earlier, Pierce was sitting in a room with experimental pianist Shipp, recording SpaceShipp , their first release as a duo but their third album as collaborators. Spaceman and Shipp worked together on Amassed , the 2000 record from collaboration-prone, outbound electronicists Spring Heel Jack. They later toured England with a larger Spring Heel Jack ensemble that included bassist William Parker and the mischievous Bennink. SpaceShipp divides into two tracks, a 41-minute hypnotic drone called ""Inner"" and an 11-minute pointillist improvisation called ""Outer"". The pieces work as stylistic but not dramatic foils; the second track isn't an attempt to resolve the first. Consistent with the careers of Spaceman and the prolific Shipp, who's made dozens of records this decade with artists ranging from Susie Ibarra to El-P, it represents a chance to try something different. As La Monte Young suggested for his own Dream Music, ""Inner"" simply appears, as if Shipp opens the lid on a room-filling Harmonium hum that was waiting latently in the corner. A scrim of electric guitar noise floats just at the surface, and, for the next 40 minutes, they drift into each other like two slow streams. Young suggested that his own music was eternal, and ""Inner"" inherits that philosophy. Every time Spaceman's guitar growls a bit or Shipp shifts to the next dissonant note, the counterpart adjusts, pushing the track forward while keeping the sound itself fluid. ""Outer"" works through similar interplay. Shipp spells out little melodies, sometimes in short, rapid bursts, sometimes in slow, well-spaced trickles. Spaceman lets his guitar drift through whorls of feedback, breaking the still with angry, snarling moments. ""Outer"" grows quiet but discordant and restless, fading out just as ""Inner"" faded in. SpaceShipp could barely have less in common with Guitar Loops , Spaceman's 2006 album for Treader, recorded just three days before he was admitted into a London hospital and diagnosed with the case of double pneumonia that nearly killed him. Loops was impatient and busy, digging through and discarding ideas like an unsatisfied antiques collector at a Sunday market. But patience unites SpaceShipp 's dual tracks, recorded almost exactly a year after Spaceman was released from the hospital as he attempted to resume work on Songs in A&E. While it's opportunistic to read into the change in Pierce's pacing and his health, SpaceShipp seems neither stunted nor stretched. It sounds like a well-paced, comfortable exercise between two experimenters risking nothing but a bit of trust in one another, their notes and effects pulling and pushing against the other's until things smear or stumble into some vast, unseen and unexpected horizon.","Their third collaboration, SpaceShipp again pairs the Spiritualized leader with experimental pianist Matthew Shipp.

Once something of a left-field mystery, the hype around him has built steadily throughout this young year. Now with drummer and a press photo, Williams has probably played about as many shows as he has songs to be heard. A spate of recent outings in New York a few weeks back had the scene in such a tizzy, The New York Times sent a dispatch to bear witness. And, just a few days later, to capitalize on the swell, his new label expedited the digital release of Wavvves , his second full-length in just four months. Without delving too deeply into the muck of Williams' proper (and purely self-titled) debut LP, Wavves , it's worth noting that each of his twin long-players share more than just a menu of goths, weeeeeeed, demons, breakers, and vintage skate photography. While his second is the marginally less abrasive, more realized of the two efforts, both feature the same roach-encrusted punk pop. Be it in the opening power chords of ""Beach Demon"" or ""To the Dregs"", there's a couple of fried amps' worth of trusted guitar tropes and distortion-- tricks borrowed from the Wipers and Sonic Youth-- enveloping Williams' carbonated choruses. The vocal hooks themselves come fast, usually propelled by titanic drumbeats nicked from 1960s girl group music. It's not immediate--- and hardly the ""pop"" record that some have characterized it as-- but deep in the froth of highlight ""No Hope Kids"" lurks more than just a thick dose of teenaged ennui or even volume. There's thrilling evidence of compelling, thoughtful craftsmanship as well. Wavves' no-fi bent has been compared to No Age's. But while those guys tend to reach far outside of their own feedback for spaces more expansive, Wavves' music feels more insular, self-contained, and unsettling. These aren't shouts from a house party, but from a solitary bedroom. And Wavvves ' outbursts are often tempered and sandwiched between clipped electronics (opener ""Rainbow Everywhere"" and ""Goth Girls"") or experimental noise (""Killer Punx, Scary Demons"") that help congeal the album as a whole. As the hubbub surrounding his music and name game began to gather serious cybersteam over the past few months, the San Diego native wisely moved his signature from small-time imprint De Stijl, to the bigger, much more historically distinct Fat Possum. Business measures and consonant gimmicks aside, the hop down South makes perfect aesthetic sense-- this young man is most certainly singing the blues. Hopeless stoner/loner incantations are scattered throughout, though two of the album's most bulletproof moments are also it's most deliciously bleak. Next to the pains of ""No Hope Kids"" (no car, no friends, no family, no friends, no girl), ""So Bored"" leaves memorable blisters. It's the record's one slam-dunk earworm, and it's a total bummer. Over three melted chords and his own back-up oooooooh's and aaaaaah's, Williams' moans a mantra that's bled into every track: ""I'm sooooo booooored, I'm sooooo boooored."" Not for much longer.","One-man noise-pop project Nathan Williams delivers on his first widely released LP.

Secrets Are Sinister,Longwave,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a3c0084474cd0c00b6/1:1/w_160/a68284eb.jpeg,2009-03-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12721-secrets-are-sinister/,Original Signal,"Secrets Are Sinister is undoubtedly a lame album, but not because it takes the majority of its sonic cues from recent U2. It's not a template that typically scores a lesser-known band a whole lot of style points, but pointing the finger at Longwave's most readily identifiable influence is the easy way out. Especially considering the undeniable potency of this shit done right-- Bono may not have the solutions to the world's ailments, but his band sure sounds like they believe they do. No, Secrets Are Sinister is lame because it solidifies Longwave's position in an identifiable subset of acolytes-- Ours, Athlete, JJ72, and so forth-- that invert the presence of Larry Mullen and Bono to present a supposedly superior U2 that values modesty over any sort of ""pop,"" be it populism or popularity. And while that might seem like a potentially interesting idea, Secrets Are Sinister comes off bloated and boring, the work of a band that hardly believes in its own message. If only Longwave could figure out how to stretch the thrills of ""Sirens in the Deep Sea"" into something that can last longer than the flavor in a wad of Big League Chew. ""Sirens"" isn't a great song or even an original one, but it at least makes an impression. They fire off all their guns at once here-- Steve Schiltz howls falsetto to the championship banners, a guitar solos with honest-to-goodness 32nd-notes, and a twinkly keyboard fills what little empty space is left. So you know that these guys are up to date on their Thatcher rock. Meanwhile, new addition Morgan King plays Kim Deal licks plated with titanium-- you won't hear a bigger bass sound outside of the Bug's London Zoo. While nearly every track on Secrets follows that path, a surprisingly bum production job by Peter Katis (the National, Twilight Sad) and David Fridmann renders Longwave merely loud instead of epic. You usually see ""shoegaze"" thrown about, but while the guitar is supposed to envelope like a tidal wave (or maybe their own ""Tidal Wave""), they sound like firehoses here-- direct, narrow, and brutal. Even the palm-muted rising action on ""The Devil and the Liar"" overpowers the vocals, and the relentless distortion of ""Shining Hours"" and ""Life Is Wrong"" add some steak and sizzle to the soggy whitebread of Coldplay's ""Yellow"". But even if you liked that song, since when were you all, ""Turn that shit up!""? So yeah, Secrets Are Sinister is a lame album, but not because Longwave never managed to be as cool as any of the early-00s New York bands they were wrongly lumped in with. Hell, in the past three years alone, French Kicks have released more enjoyable records than the Strokes and Interpol combined. No, them problem here is more one of direction. Secrets has its finger on the pulse of mainstream radio, judging from its oppressive (note how ""oppressive"" almost sounds like ""overly compressed"" when you say it really fast) sonics. But stuck between a tired, nebulously elucidated artistic direction and their own nebulously elucidated commercial aspirations, they just sound a whole lot like the major-label also-rans that they actually are. Even if Longwave probably deserve better, it sucks when the suits are right.","New York band's latest again infuses turn-of-the-millennium Strokes moves with more bombastic stadium rock.

The Good Feeling Music of Dent May and His Magnificent Ukulele,Dent May & His Magnificent Ukulele,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a89d034d5c69bf2c54/1:1/w_160/3be23e4b.jpeg,2009-03-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12725-the-good-feeling-music-of-dent-may-and-his-magnificent-ukulele/,Paw Tracks,"By now you may have heard that young throwback crooner Dent May was discovered by Animal Collective during the recording of Merriweather Post Pavilion in Oxford, Miss., and subsequently signed to the group's Paw Tracks imprint. That fact has a lot of folks excited about the newcomer, but May is not your typical A.C.-related artist. In fact, on the wide spectrum of musical styles he's probably as far away from labelmates Black Dice and Excepter as, um, David Banner or Taylor Swift. The Mississippi native offers here a kind of modern-day lounge act-- approaching his material as part sentimentalist, part jokester-- and sings in a manner closely reminiscent of indie pop vocalists like Stephin Merritt and Jens Lekman. May shares those gents' strong grasp of melody (his songs are nothing if not hook-laden) but unlike them he is a strict genre specialist. For this record, at least (allegedly there's a dance project in the works under his Dent Sweat alter ego), he functions entirely within the boundaries of the schmaltzy barroom pop and suburbanized island music of the 1950s and 60s. (""Meet Me in the Garden"", all tiki torches and umbrella drinks, might as well be the soundtrack to a backyard cookout thrown by Mad Men 's Betty Draper.) Combined with his tongue-in-cheek lyrics, it can be a lot of shtick to swallow at once. Since it's inseparable from the album's content, one really has to buy into the persona May is selling in order to enjoy The Good Feeling Music of Dent May and His Magnificent Ukulele . That's much easier to do with a fellow like Jonathan Richman (with whom May shares an innocent-guy outlook and is often compared to), because his naiveté comes across as genuine and is leavened with humor. But May's attempts at winking cultural criticism often undercut his authenticity. On ""College Town Boy"", he awkwardly pokes fun at the academic set, singing, ""Since graduation day he feels like a fraud, he still regrets he never studied abroad."" Yikes. Prompting more winces on ""You Can't Force a Dance Party"", May revisits a hipster get-together gone awry: ""All the way from Brooklyn, Sally came to see me"", he says, but laments spoiling the fun by being ""in the corner reading poetry and prose."" If you can look past these cringe-inducing moments, The Good Feeling Music occasionally lives up to its title. One of the record's most charming cuts is ""Oh Paris!"", which finds May doing his best Morrissey atop strumming ukulele (yes, it is omnipresent) and ""shoo-be doo-be"" backing vocals. Just as pleasant is his reverential take on the Four Preps' 1957 classic ""26 Miles (Catalina)"", a wise cover choice since it fits snugly within his aesthetic. Alongside ""Meet Me in the Garden"", these songs represent a sufficiently enjoyable portion of the record. But to compare May again to one of his peers, there's nothing on par with Lekman's ""Black Cab"" or ""Maple Leaves"" here. At this early point in his career, May's tunes, while positively catchy and at times a lot fun, just don't have that kind of depth. They also lack heart, and that seems harder to forgive.","Mississippi native's debut on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks imprint finds him working in the realm of schmaltzy barroom pop with a style that's sometimes evocative of Jens Lekman or Stephin Merritt.

Shrag,Shrag,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a69d034d5c69bf2c4f/1:1/w_160/1822598b.jpeg,2009-03-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12723-shrag/,Where It's At Is Where You Are,"During the first wave of UK indie, Gang of Four wrote anti-love songs while bands like the Slits, the Raincoats, and X-Ray Spex rejected not only romance but also traditional femininity. In the Britpop 1990s, Blur snarkily claimed to see no difference between ""Girls and Boys"", and Elastica made sexual demystification a lot more fun (""You could call me a car lover/ 'Cause I love it in a motor""). Brighton's Shrag are a sharp up-and-coming poppy post-punk band smearing their own dark lip gloss on sex and gender. But you can always tell deep down they're looking for real, vital connection. They find it in more ways than one on their self-titled debut album, which mostly pulls together songs released on mp3 and 7"" going back to 2006, when ""Don't Speak""-ably stinging breakup ballad ""Hopelessly Wasted"" made a few waves. More often the three-girl, two-boy guitar-synth rioters are more bellicose-- hitting the giddy stratospheres of early Long Blondes singles (minus the glamour) while tremblingly shouting down a cheating lover on spiky-riffed ""Lost Dog"", or holding a ""long term grudge"" on fast, still-furious ""Long Term Monster"". Shoplifting is hard on the unrepentantly unruly ""Intelligent Theft"", but bratty MySpace-quote pop sounds easy. The most divisive track is likely to be Kate Nash-conversational ""Talk to the Left"", a bare electro-punk update on awkward sex jams (""Did he really say, 'Baby, now I'm heading south?'"") from the Au Pairs' ""Come Again"" to Art Brut's ""Rusted Guns of Milan"". ""Cupboard Love"" should get basement crowds belting out requests for W-2 information. You just haven't earned it yet, baby. Like many of us in our increasingly autistic age, Shrag seek not just physical connections, but to participate in shared culture-- the essence of the English DIY movement. Even when they're talking about their bodies, Shrag use the language of fans. Love Is All-ish sax spree ""Pregnancy Scene"" is the best petulant protest against all our friends growing up and having babies since the Boy Least Likely To's ""Monsters""; the only previously unreleased non-instrumental, ""New Favourites"", obsesses over a clique-changing best mate like she's a once-favorite band; ""Mark E. Smith"" is the indie kid's ""Would you do that if Barack Obama was watching?"". My absolute favorite song here, ""Forty Five 45s"", is a beautifully crafted, basically one-chord wonder sung by a narrator who'd notice every nuance in the mixtapes you give her and then be really fucking pissed when you take off with all her mp3s except Jeff Buckley. You could've at least left the Los Campesinos! zine. Only connect? Not hardly: ""Different Glue"" grapples with groping strangers who will make you glad you stayed at home tonight. ""Women get hassled at gigs if they're not with a bloke,"" Gang of Four's Jon King told critic Greil Marcus in 1980. The name Shrag, sort of a nice onomatopoeia for the younger group's tough-talking shambling, is also an actual English word that's obsolete. King's statement isn't-- neither is a good fanmade antidote to pop music that's some dying conglomerate's idea of how much self-expression you can handle. Things aren't perfect, but we've come a long way.","Brighton, UK's Shrag are a sharp, up-and-coming poppy post-punk band smearing their own dark lip gloss on sex and gender while also looking for real, vital connection.

Reviver EP,Abe Vigoda,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2acea9e61561daa4ad7/1:1/w_160/ec54fed2.jpeg,2009-03-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12728-reviver-ep/,Post Present Medium,"The problem with having a sound unique enough to summarize in two words is that people will use that tag. A lot. L.A.'s Abe Vigoda are self-described ""tropical punk,"" and Google results say this phrase appears 1,640 times next to their name. It's totally accurate. The band's second album, Skeleton , mixed steel drum-mimicking guitars and stilted, hard-to-play (easy to call ""tropical""; more accurately ""syncopated"") rhythms. L.A. all-ages performance space The Smell was their musical home base. On Reviver Abe Vigoda take the next logical step in the development of their easy-to-peg sound: they abandon it. Skeleton was great, but also hinted that there were more variations and textures hidden inside the songs. Just as on Skeleton , Abe Vigoda establish an aesthetic right from the beginning of Reviver . Or rather, they establish what it is not; and this time it’s ""not-tropical punk."" This EP contains five songs, but shows Abe Vigoda presenting a different but equally developed sound from ""Don't Lie"" onwards. On ""Don't Lie"", guitarists Juan Velazquez and Michael Vidal turn their instruments on an angle; and their guitars sound strident, and strained. The whole song feels darker, more languid than anything on Skeleton . Vidal, the band's fresh-faced singer, croons-- actually croons-- ""Don't Lie"" and the rest of the EP as if he's lived several lifetimes since their last album. There's a slowness to it that feels like weight, but not drag, and this pull goes in many directions. Abe Vigoda pan their tracks to emphasize the contrasting guitar melodies, but their low production values let them blend and swirl together at times. Still, the separation is the most enjoyable across the EP. ""House"", for example, has that familiar jagged, unsteady beat, but the best and most disorienting sounds are its guitars. Here the guys do a crisp little tone in one ear, and spikier guitar stabs in the other. They don't clash, really, but they compete for your attention. Abe Vigoda wants to make their adjustments explicit, by recording songs that've been done before. They cover both their own track, Skeleton ’s ""Endless Sleeper"", and Stevie Nicks' 1983 hit ""Wild Heart"". Reviver 's ""Endless Sleeper"" runs slower but shorter. There are no drums here, and the song turns into jelly without either a backbone or the hard, bright guitar of the original. It's a proof-of-concept for their new sound, but it doesn't beat out the energy that charges through the band's first edition. Their ""Wild Heart"" interpretation comes off better. The band sing only a fraction of Nicks’ lyrics and keep Vidal’s voice low. One of those lines, ""Another chill off an already broken heart"" defines the way the vocals work: Vidal's voice sounds deeper and dispassionate across the EP's five songs. ""Wild Heart"" rests on a five-note guitar melody and simple bass line. It feels methodical, sparse, and totally unlike them, which is exactly what they want. If Skeleton was island punk, Reviver moves the band out to sea. The drumming feels less straightforward here and only adds to the dizzying effect that makes you feel like Abe Vigoda's members are working at cross-purposes. Sometimes it feels like they're playing two different songs, working from two different ideas. There's no steady view of the horizon anymore. It's disorienting, but charming, to hear their parts blend, settle, and separate over and over again. I can't think of a name for it.","On their debut, L.A.'s Abe Vigoda made self-described ""tropical punk,"" mixing steel drum-mimicking guitars and stilted, hard-to-play rhythms; on this new EP, the band takes the next logical step in the development of their easy-to-peg sound: they abandon it.

Middle Cyclone,Neko Case,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ad13d197565213890f/1:1/w_160/5dd3229e.jpeg,2009-03-03 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12729-middle-cyclone/,Anti-,"Neko Case is a force of nature. Her voice can knock you over-- it's one of the strongest in any genre. She has immense control and surprising physical and stylistic range, able to jump from cowgirl honkytonk to pop muse to Americana banshee with ease and grace. However, on her fifth studio album, Middle Cyclone , she literally becomes a force of nature: Case sings opener ""This Tornado Loves You"" from the point of view of an actual tornado, tearing up trailer parks and cutting a 65-mile swath in search for its beloved: ""I carved your name across three counties,"" she sings defiantly as the guitars whip around her and the snare patters frantically, suggesting destruction can be a demonstration of love. Later she's a cyclone, an elephant, a killer whale, a dove, a magpie, and possibly a mollusk. ""I'm an animal,"" she sings on ""I'm an Animal"". ""You're an animal, too."" Middle Cyclone is another strong entry in her strange catalog, a culmination of some of the lyrical and musical concerns she's been exploring since Blacklisted , when she started receiving full songwriting credit. That 2002 album marked a turning point for Case as she abandoned the straightforward country-soul of 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby for a spookier sound that favors odd song structures and odder imagery about serial killers, downed planes, and automobile accidents. Fox Confessor Brings the Flood developed those ideas and Middle Cyclone further refines them. It plays almost like a culmination of her career this decade, the final installment of a trilogy about the weird American wilderness of her mind. Listeners more familiar with Case's previous work will appreciate the tendrils of mythology that reach from this album into her recent catalog. With its first-verse image of a man ""filleted on the stairs,"" ""Polar Nettles"" recalls the bloodspatter lyrics of ""Deep Red Bells"" on Blacklisted ; ""Red Tide"" and ""Magpie to the Morning"" play with critter imagery similar to ""Lion's Jaws"" and ""Maybe Sparrow"" on Fox Confessor . In fact, ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" sounds like a sequel of sorts to ""The Tigers Have Spoken"", from her live album of the same name. Both concern zoo animals who rebel against their prisons, and both end, tragically and inevitably, in bullets. The album, however, doesn't demand any special context to be enjoyed: It sounds impressive and immersive on its own, so those who've only heard her name will find much to admire in her skewed songs. But because Case doesn't really write hooks and typically avoids the standard verse-chorus-verse song structure, Middle Cyclone may take even longer than previous albums to reveal their charms and mysteries. What ties everything together is her unmistakable voice. Pushing herself, she shows off a few new tricks in these songs. On ""People Got a Lot of Nerve"", she fashions one of the album's best hooks from the repeated syllables of ""man man man eater"", then ascends a vertiginous scale on the bridge, hitting that impossibly high note with no loss of tone. She layers her voice to create an airy chorus on ""Magpie to the Morning"" and a dramatic gospel on her cover of Sparks' ""Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth"". ""Prison Girls"" may be her best performance here, with an emphatic vocal that gives the chorus-- ""I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes""-- new meaning and greater menace with each repetition. Case remains her own best muse, a strong, feminine presence who demands you meet her songs halfway (she calls herself a control freak in every article I've read), but her band deserves credit for creating the ambient, dark-night setting in which her tales of murder and animals sound natural and compelling. Middle Cyclone features the same core group she's been playing with for years-- including guitarist Paul Rigby, bass player Tom V. Ray, multi-instrumentalist Jon Rauhouse, and back-up singer Kelly Hogan-- along with a supporting cast that includes regulars Garth Hudson of the Band, M. Ward, Sarah Harmer, and members of Calexico, the Sadies, and Giant Sand. With an increasing familiarity between them, this cast finds new ways to sell her songs and couch Case's vocals in unpredictable arrangements. ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" kicks off with a chiming Byrds riff that makes it impossible not to perk up and listen to the song, and a strangled guitar line staggers through ""Fever"", implying an unnamed threat just off camera. Much of the album is acoustic and subdued, and a few of the slower songs start to sag a bit. The album picks up considerably towards the end, as ""Prison Girls"" lurches ominously like film noir and ""Red Tide"" generates a rumbling garage-rock stomp. Middle Cyclone ends with ""Marais la Nuit"", which translates to ""The Night Marsh"". True to its title, it is 30 minutes of frog noises that Case recorded at her farm in Vermont, just outside the barn where most of these sessions were held. It's not surprising that her animal lyrics would break down into real animal sounds, and as chill-out music for any domesticated wildlife in your home, it's not unpleasant. It is, however, nearly as long as the album proper. Its inclusion show just how thoroughly Case has imagined her own little world on these three albums and how thoroughly she rules that realm.",,7.9,
The Bridge: Concept of a Culture,Grandmaster Flash,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a95e6ef95969320478/1:1/w_160/69ea3ea8.jpeg,2009-03-02 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12726-the-bridge-concept-of-a-culture/,Strut,"For all of the hip-hop landmarks to see the light in 1988-- It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back , By All Means Necessary , Straight Outta Compton , Critical Beatdown , Long Live the Kane , The Great Adventures of Slick Rick -- one detail that often goes overlooked is the fact that it was also the year Grandmaster Flash released his last LP, briefly reuniting with Melle Mel to drop the commercially disappointing On the Strength . After it tanked, Flash shifted his focus to become a highly in-demand touring DJ, which wasn't the worst career move: His status as a musical icon is indelible in any case, and some of the mixes he released-- like 2002's b-boy break/scratch showcase The Official Adventures of Grandmaster Flash or 1997's disco mix Salsoul Jam 2000 (re-released in 2005 as Mixing Bullets and Firing Joints )-- are essential for anyone who likes old-school hip-hop. But while I won't begrudge Flash for wanting to get back into the studio and reassert his place in the hip-hop pantheon, maybe we should all agree to pretend that The Bridge doesn't actually exist. Expecting a great, sonically relevant album in 2009 from one of the few hip-hop artists to get pressed on wax 30 years ago might be a bit naïve-- especially when the artist in question hasn't dropped a full-length album of original beats since the Reagan administration-- but it's Flash , dammit, the man who personified the DJ for an entire generation. How could he have a hand in anything so sub-par? The reason is simple: he's trying to be something he's never been. The production of The Bridge sounds like it came out of an extended catch-up session, the work of a man best accustomed to the breakbeat era's techniques trying his hand at the last ten years' worth of club-rap digitalism. That's why there's almost no samples on this album-- and, alarmingly enough, a severe dearth of actual scratching and cutting, aside from the interlude-length track ""Zuka the Sound"" and the clusterfuck ""Here Comes My DJ"", which features DJ Kool and DJ Demo and a lot of sub-Khaled yelling. ""Tribute to the Breakdancer"" is the only other track that sounds like it has some connection to the old-school continuum Flash helped establish, and it's such a fossilized, half-hearted remember-the-80s cliché that it marks the first time I've actually rolled my eyes when the immortal ""Apache"" break popped up. The rest of the album is built on a foundation of flat-sounding synths and stylistic confusion: fluffy faux-Soulquarians (""Shine All Day""; ""Grown & Sexy""), tinny, stagger-step pretend-Timbaland (""Bounce Back""), club-pop beats that Fergie would have to think for a minute or two about before green-lighting (""Those Chix""), and a number of post- Mary J. Rap&B sounds that could've been constructed any time in the last 15 years (""Unpredictable""; ""Swagger"").   ""  Oh Man  ""  , the album-closing showcase for Natacha Atlas and MySpace find Syndee, is the least tone-deaf track on the album  --  and it  '  s essentially just straight-up house music. I don  '  t doubt for a moment that Flash has kept his ear to the streets at every opportunity over the last several years, but this kind of thing just doesn  '  t play to his strengths. The guest list bears some of the blame for The Bridge 's failings, too, though it's a bit of a disappointing surprise how perfunctory some of these legends sound. Q-Tip's verse on ""Shine All Day"" tries to extend the love vibes of The Renaissance and comes up with Hallmark mawkishness (""ominous clouds come and get dreary/when you're around though, girl, I'm never weary""), Snoop Dogg's pimp-autopilot verse on ""Swagger"" isn't passable enough to endure Lynn Carter's syrupy, pitch-corrected hook for, and if you were geeked to find out that Big Daddy Kane shows up twice on this album, keep in mind it's ladies-man Kane and not best-MC-ever-candidate Kane. KRS-One comes closest to surprising, taking the potentially didactic world-without-hip-hop scenario of ""What If"" and, after stating that an entire culture would be poorer without it, admitting that criminal culture wouldn't be as widely celebrated either. Inner conflict? In my nostalgia trip? Flash does deserve some credit for giving some relative unknowns a chance to shine on a record with  hip-hop'  s most legendary DJ on the cover, though it says something that the most intriguing-sounding of the album  '  s obscure MCs  --  Sweden  '  s Afasi, Spain  '  s Kase-O, Japan  '  s Maccho, and Senegal  '  s Abass, who liven up  ""  We Speak  hip-hop""--  don  '  t even rap in English. The notion that Flash is an international ambassador of  hip-hop--  and a man who escaped the meat grinder of pop music  '  s disposable star culture to make it as an independently-operating veteran-- means a lot more than his ability to get behind the boards and crank out some generic club bangers. Weak as The Bridge is, it  '  s not even remotely enough to damage his legacy or his true skills on the wheels of steel.","The musical legend and hip-hop pioneer-- who has spent the past few decades DJing-- issues his first record of new beats since the Reagan administration.

When Glasgow's Bis laid down their ""Teen-C Revolution"" manifesto in the mid-1990s, a vague but confrontational screed against fascists, homophobes, and adults, they put an expiration date on their band. But if their lyrics hadn't made it explicit, their music-- a mix of playground taunts, synths, and guitars-- would have spoken the same manifesto. You can trace a crayon line from Bis to young, shouting, dancing bands like the Gossip and Los Campesinos!. And so, a decade and a half years later, and on her first solo record, Bis singer and keyboard player Amanda MacKinnon (still using her Bis stage name Manda Rin) finds herself trying to catch up to bands that were, no doubt, influenced by Bis. She experiments with variations on the bright, kandy pop that Bis perfected and finds a more nuanced form of rebellion, but she can't find the reinvention she needs. Shedding the shackles of Bis probably sounds ridiculous when most Americans have probably never heard of the band. In America the band are best known for writing the end credits song to ""The Powerpuff Girls"". But in 1996, the band played ""Top of the Pops"" before they even had a record deal-- the first group ever to do so. They released three albums and numerous EPs on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label here and the Delgados' Chemikal Underground imprint in Europe-- and sold 100,000 copies of their debut album in Japan. Straight off, it's easier to see her connections to Bis rather than her defection. MacKinnon is in cartoon form on My DNA' s cover, just as she was on many of Bis' EPs. But it shows her staring solemnly into a mirror at her real reflection, still wearing her trademark hair barrettes, but definitely looking more mature. On ""Tell It to the Kids"" Bis bragged that Manda Rin used her ""childlike appearance"" as a weapon-the My DNA cover shows her older and a bit defenseless. My DNA tries on different variations of dance pop: disco, electro, even glassy Scandinavian dance. Sometimes these songs work: The title track's laserbeam keyboards and rubbery bassline are brash and fun enough to make up for Manda Rin's more subdued vocals. She's less relenting on ""The Word Out"", where her chants (""Did you ever write the perfect song/ Did you ever say sorry to who you should"") serve as cheerleaders for the song's ripsaw guitars. Manda Rin reaches for icy pop princess sheen on ""Love to Hate You"". Her voice can't support the tension. It aims for delicate but comes off thin. While the new tonal and rhythmic palette betrays desire to branch out, the results show more courage, but less confidence than her material with Bis. Bis were never subtle, but MacKinnon wants more nuance and less shouting on My DNA . She takes issue with issues like body acceptance (""Less Than Zero""), abuse (""Bruises"") and relationships (""Break-Up/Breakdown""). But lines like ""Boys say go/ Girls say no"" (""Guilty Pleasure"") are too flat to make their point. For an album about being comfortable with yourself, My DNA is still not sure what it should be.","Bis keyboardist and singer's first solo album finds her still experimenting with variations on the bright, kandy pop of her former band.

Here We Go Magic,Here We Go Magic,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a75e6ef95969320475/1:1/w_160/fbefdc01.jpeg,2009-03-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12724-here-we-go-magic/,Western Vinyl,"Luke Temple's first foray into pseudonymical songwriting territory feels as current as did Snowbeast and Hold a Match for a Gasoline World , his prior two records released under his given name. But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like Sufjan Stevens and Danielson, Here We Go Magic works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters Temple's psychedelic muse through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The title itself indicates that Here We Go Magic might just be a spur-of-the-moment lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time. The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes Magic as both a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with Temple agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has Temple singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of xylophone, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 Paul Simon acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: Temple's vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests Simon, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions. The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from Temple's unconscious. The best bits of Magic are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", Temple blanches his voice to Perry Farrell territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in Temple's undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with glimmering synth flecks, over which Temple's voice offers sympathetic counsel. Only swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A fleeting glimpse of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see. By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, 11 minutes of Magic's brief 38 are taken with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. Deerhunter, No Age, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but Temple doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but Temple seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those bits suffer in comparison to those other 27 minutes of Magic: a sculpted version of that same disarming din, with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing.","Luke Temple's new project finds him letting his psychedelic impulses take over, as he adds hazy electronic textures, loops, and extended bits of ambience and noise.

Labyrinthes,Malajube,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ab5e6ef9596932047d/1:1/w_160/76ecc34d.jpeg,2009-03-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12727-labyrinthes/,Dare to Care,"""Malajube's music is labyrinthine,"" Pitchfork's Brian Howe wrote by way of praising the French Montreal band's breakout sophomore album, Trompe-l'Oeil , in 2006. With their city then under the indie rock microscope, Malajube (still say it MAL-a-zhoob) scanned as yet more ramshackle hyper-pop, language less a barrier than a Dungen-esque point of difference-- when it counted, say on the hook to commercial-bait standout ""Montréal -40°C"", these inaugural Polaris Music Prize nominees sounded no more francophone than, I dunno, Electric Light Orchestra. Media hype now gone home, Malajube up the labyrinthine stakes on Labyrinthes , daring re-entry. It's not for the faint of heart-- or the fain to double back. How do you say ""gone all prog"" en français ? The change is as much context as content-- multipart Trompe mini-epics ""La Monogamie"" and ""Le Crabe"" already were reminiscent of contemporaries such as Mew-- but jarring structural changes are the norm on Labyrinthes , suggesting Malajube's former ""progressive emo jam band"" MySpace descriptor may have been more apt than absurd. Six-minute opener ""Ursuline"" boldly announces the new approach-- and, if you understand the submerged lyrics (or read the interviews), the Catholicism/mortality-minded lyrical themes-- as blistering guitar solos, chopsy drumming, and portentous chants descend upon a placid piano intro, leaving only church bells in their wake. Juxtapositions juice a couple of the best songs: ""Casablanca"", which veers from hazy Tropicália-tinged pop to a fleet-fingered guitar coda, and ""333"", all gallops and screeches and echoes except when its inner ""Dust in the Wind"" breaks out. Where Malajube fall flat, it's not due to complexity, but grim reality: Comedy rarely translates well. Jerry Lewis, anyone? ""It's good to have humor in music too,"" drummer Francis Mineau, lead singer Julien Mineau's brother, told the National Post . The most immediately accessible tracks here-- spiky video selection ""Porté Disparu"", with its Ed Wood-worthy synth line, or the harmony- and piano-driven ""Luna""-- translate as light-hearted whether you know that ""Les Collemboles"" refers to eating bugs someday or just like to hum along with its call-and-response chorus. The more sinister ""Le Tout-Puissant"" and ""Cristobald"" convey instrumental prowess and grandiosity, sure, but I could use a pie in the face (OK, the closing growls almost count). So although Labyrinthes further establishes Malajube as French Canadians worth following, this time you may not make it far enough to save your brother from the Goblin King.","Montreal band follows its breakout sophomore album, Trompe-l'Oeil, by amping up the prog with multipart mini-epics and jarring structural changes.

No Line on the Horizon,U2,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2aeb1335d7bf169854a/1:1/w_160/7411caea.jpeg,2009-03-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12730-no-line-on-the-horizon/,Interscope,"Why U2? How did these four Irishmen become the blueprint for every band with stadium aspirations? The Edge's churchly guitar chime-- which thrives on the same arena acoustics that can turn otherwise booming bands into mud-- is certainly a factor. So is their weakness for the big gesture-- whether it be a giant lemon, heart, or mouth. And Bono's cathartic mix of modern panacea-- love, God, mass culture-- gives them a reach to the back row and beyond. But, perhaps above all else, the band's restlessness and willingness to challenge both themselves and their patrons is why the Killers, Kanye West, and Coldplay want to be the next U2 and not the next AC/DC. It's why these four Irishmen still represent the punk spirit decades after they emerged from it. ""You've got to balance being relevant and commenting on something that's happening today with trying to attain timelessness,"" philosophized the Edge in the early 1990s. The quote sounds like rock star bullshit...until you realize that's pretty much what U2 did for 20 years. From 1980 to 2000, it was difficult to tell exactly what the next U2 album would sound like. Briefly: They added atmosphere to new wave, looked for God and found hits, exhumed their rock'n'roll heroes, sent-up those same heroes while losing their religion, and punctured pop via mutated techno. Each move was more audacious than the last-- even 1997 knee-jerk victim Pop saw the world-beating act taking completely unnecessary musical and financial risks in the name of Warholian post-modern pastiche. They then also managed to surprise on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind by successfully returning to form after shrugging off the notion for so many years. But 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its subsequent tour were troubling. That record saw four guys famous for dabbing classic rock into all sorts of impressionistic frames (or dismantling it entirely via Village People costumes) uncomfortably grasping for old-fashioned riffs, when they weren't mindlessly feasting on their own past. It was completely predictable (""City of Blinding Lights""), canned (""Vertigo""), and depressingly Sting-like (""A Man and a Woman""). But the group did little to hide the fact that they were basking in their early-century comeback's afterglow; in concert, in place of the ATYCLB tour's heart-shaped runway was a, um, circle-shaped runway. Still self-aware enough to sense stagnation, the quartet began to work on what would become No Line on the Horizon with new producer Rick Rubin and an imperative to break all those piling U2 trappings once again. As Bono told The New York Times this week: ""When you become a comfortable, reliable friend, I'm not sure that's the place for rock'n'roll."" Sixteen years ago, U2 worked a snippet of Public Enemy's ""Don't Believe the Hype"" into their technologically prescient Zoo TV tour-- perhaps fans should heed that bit of sampled advice right about now. Because while this group of slick talkers may have set out to expand their own definition once more, they've ended up with old collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois --along with an album that's neither relevant nor timeless. First single ""Get on Your Boots"" is a worrisome harbinger-- to call it a mess would be generous. The song combines sub-Audioslave riffs with Escape Club's ""Wild Wild West"" and sounds more disjointed than the worst Girl Talk rip off. ""I don't wanna talk about wars between nations-- not right now!"" claims Bono on the song, before extolling the virtues of tight leather boots. His off-the-cuff attitude and delivery suggests a cheekiness missing from U2's music for more than a decade, but it's a red herring. While other tracks like ""I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"" and ""Stand Up Comedy"" feature knowing lines that examine the singer's faults and hypocrisy, the album is heavy on half-assed word-salad characterizations and the sort of meaningless platitudes Bono used to be so great at (barely) avoiding. And there's a strong theme of resignation running through the record; whereas many classic U2 tracks have come from Bono's struggle with faith and certainty, he seems content to give up agency on songs like ""Moment of Surrender"" and ""Unknown Caller"". ""I've found grace inside a sound,"" he sings on ""Breathe"", and the line seems like a cop-out from a man who spent so much time struggling with salvation. Meanwhile, the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms (the three-note ring Edge nicks from ""Walk On"" for ""Unknown Caller"", the ""oh oh oh"" outro from ""Stay"" apparently copied and pasted into ""Moment of Surrender"", etc.). While Eno used to work his unique sound-bobbles and ambiance into the fabric of U2 songs, he seems content to offer spacey intros totally disassociated from their accompanying tunes here (see: ""Fez - Being Born"", ""Magnificent""). And oftentimes the band mistakes risk-taking for ill-fated arrangements and decisions. ""Surrender""-- reportedly improvised in one seven-minute take-- comes across as lazy indulgence, and the title track's hard-nosed verse is torpedoed by its deflating fart of a hook. As the go-to sonic innovator of the group, the Edge dials in a particularly dispiriting performance throughout; his rare solos usually pack in enough panache to fill stadiums but his bluesy blah of a spotlight on ""Surrender"" would barely satisfy a single earbud. ""It keeps getting harder. You're playing against yourself and you don't want to lose,"" Adam Clayton told Q last month. And he's got a point. After nearly 30 years of chart crashing and sell-outs, starting afresh can't be easy. There's only one ""One"". In a way, U2 spoiled their followers by consistently questioning themselves while writing songs that straddled the personal and collective consciousness. But Horizon is clearly playing not to lose-- it's a defensive gesture, and a rather pitiful one at that.",,4.2,
Holler and Stomp,Dressy Bessy,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2965e6ef9596932044e/1:1/w_160/0d12f262.jpg,2009-02-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12713-holler-and-stomp/,Transdreamer,"When Dressy Bessy are good, Dressy Bessy are very, very good. They've excelled at the kind of head-bobbing tunes you'd expect from the Kindercore record label and, starting with their self-titled 2003 album, they also essayed the sort of enjoyable grrl-fronted rock that could fit right into a playlist between ""Seether"" and ""Bright Yellow Gun"". Throughout, Tammy Ealom's brash and giddy charm coupled with the group's way with a melody often won out over any objections. When they were not so good, Dressy Bessy exemplified what many would consider most obnoxious about both indiepop culture (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of greasy kid stuff) and Ye Olde Elephant 6 collective (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of 1960s psych-pop sounds and signifiers). But if the group could be accused of rubbing their pigtails in everyone's faces, even the grumpiest Gus would at the very least begrudge them their often inescapable hooks. But that would be before the group's latest album, Holler and Stomp. It's a 13-song journey through a world where Dressy Bessy turns themselves into everything critics thought they were-- amateurish, tuneless, puerile, purveyors of the sort of ""catchy"" songs that spring the CDC into action. It's as if the group chose to stoop to and limbo beneath the subterranean lows established by the awful cover portrait (with all due apologies to fans of the ""airbrushed street scene festooned with MS Paint graffiti and Oscar the Grouch trash cans"" school of artistry). Some might be more generous, but there are only two tunes that stand out from this mess for their non-awfulness. The album's nominal single, ""Simple Girlz"", features a sassy multi-tracked Ealom kicking up her walking boots in the general direction of shiftless dudes looking for easy breezy ladyfriends. The other track is ""Left to the Right"", a stop-start number where Dressy Bessy, which to this point of the album comes off as existing somewhere between ""listless"" and ""inert,"" sound like they're actually enjoying what they're playing. There's more than a bit of irony to be had, though, with Ealom repeatedly singing the line ""Gimme something to sing"" in a song that's all the better for keeping her singing to a minimum. Even the most casual listener would notice a change between Ealom's voice over the years-- her girlish chirp from the group's early days has developed a little husk and heft, making her sound not unlike Kim or Kelley Deal. On most of Holler and Stomp, unfortunately, she sounds like a Deal sister looking for a melody and a paper sack. It's bad enough that the songs, separate from the vocals, are pretty weak-- if the tunes on turds like ""Ease Me Down"" or ""Anyone Can See"" aren't bad enough, the use of cheesy Casio trumpets (on the former) or a rinky-dink drum machine (on the latter) make sure this shit stinks. Then Ealom shows up, slightly out of step with the songs in question, singing melodies she's seemingly forgotten tied to lyrics that are best left forgotten. Her performances comes off as awkward karaoke, and it's even worse when it comes on songs like ""Automatic"" or ""Sindy Says"" that superficially resemble what the group's done in the past (and done better). If the future promises to bring more moments where Tammy Ealom croaks ""I want to steal your candy"" like a nic-fitted Wicked Witch, then it's probably time for folks to stow Dressy Bessy in the attic.","Denver-based Elephant 6 OGs are still chugging along, their power-pop tendencies now mixed with a bit of alt-rock grit.

Haven't Slept All Year,Cobra Verde,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a293c0084474cd0c008f/1:1/w_160/82ee0622.jpg,2009-02-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12710-havent-slept-all-year/,Scat,"For a band of middle-aged Cleveland art-punk misfits born of record-collector rock tradition, Cobra Verde have adapted rather well to the new-school indie economy, turning themselves into a TV-licensing machine and landing plum placements on ""Entourage"" and ""The O.C."" But if Cobra Verde's eternally youthful swagger belies their almost two-decade pedigree, the story of the band's sixth album provided a sad reminder that you can't be a kid forever-- upon its initial completion in summer of 2007, frontman John Petkovic was forced to care for his cancer-stricken mother, who passed away that December. The album, and the band, were put on ice for over a year-- during which Petkovic through suffered severe, prolonged bouts of insomnia. So that album title is no exaggeration. But if the songs contained within predate Petkovic's breakdown, they suggest that, even before his familial trauma, the singer was well-accustomed to an after-hours regimen of strip clubs and booze. Cobra Verde's music has always simmered with nocturnal menace and seedy suggestion, but on Haven't Slept All Year, there's a greater awareness of the price for staying up all night: Having to make amends in the morning. The result is an album plays out in a binary sequence of comically over-the-top drunk-rock benders and sincere, open-hearted pleas for forgiveness. But until the morning comes, Cobra Verde are happy to appeal to the most base-ic of instincts: ""Entourage""-approved opener ""World Can't Have Her"" is essentially a rewrite of AC/DC's ""Girls Got Rhythm"". But as certified students of rock'n'roll mythology (Petkovic is a journalist by trade; guitarist Frank Vazzano teaches pop-music history at Cleveland State University), Cobra Verde project a keen self-awareness: the Clash-city rocker ""Riot in the Food Court"" climaxes with a deadpan declaration of ""I'm in love with strippers on drugs,"" while the Replacements-styled nightclub jitters of ""Wasted Again"" carry the admission that ""drinking songs are so typical."" The implication is that Cobra Verde aren't playing around with hard-rock conventions merely for populist appeal and easy soundtrack money, but because it's precisely the sort of music that you'd hear blaring in the peeler bars and neon-lit corner dives that Petkovic's protagonists inhabit. Cobra Verde also realize their ""drunken sex addict"" anti-heroes are not the sort of people you want to spend an entire album hanging out with-- particularly when they start leaning too heavily on the bar-band swing (""I Could Go to Hell for You""). So for every time Petkovic is called on to play the sleazeball, there's a chance to redeem himself as the sweetheart, and for the band to apply the more expansive approach that marked 2005's Copycat Killers all-covers collection: ""Home in the Highrise"" colors in its sketch of skyscraper-living sterility with rich Byrdsian harmonies; the turn-a-new-leaf anthems ""Something About the Bedroom"" and ""Run Away"" outfit Pavement with skinny ties and keytars. By penultimate acoustic ballad ""Can't Believe"", Petkovic is seeking forgiveness for all his sins-- á la Lou Reed on the Velvets' ""Jesus""-- from a god he doesn't believe in, at which point he's sentenced to an afterlife in the ""Haunted Heavens,"" where he's surrounded by devils and dead lovers, but where-- judging by the pristine jangle-pop presentation-- they're spinning the Flamin' Groovies for all eternity. In light of Petkovic's annus miserablis, that's the kind of hell he can certainly deal with.",,7.0,
Tchamantché,Rokia Traoré,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2919d034d5c69bf2c1b/1:1/w_160/1177f398.jpg,2009-02-27 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12708-tchamantche/,Nonesuch,"When it comes to a region with a musical heritage as rich and varied as Western Africa, it's hard to tell if the artists that gain global notice represent the cream of the crop or merely the tip of a vast iceberg. Mali alone is home to so many spectacular musicians it boggles the mind. There's so much myth and mystery swirling about Mali that it's just as easy to discount the hype surrounding any specific artist as it is to take the country's impressive cadre and caliber of musicians for granted. Of course, Rokia Traoré didn't decide where she would be born. But being born in Mali instantly puts her in the same musical circle as acts as diverse as the late Ali Farke Touré, Amadou and Mariam, Salif Keita, Toumani Diabaté, and Tinariwren-- all established West African superstars. Yet if many of Mali's great acts have musical roots that stretch back decades or even centuries, Traoré represents something of an anomaly. The privileged (by ethnic birthright) daughter of a diplomat, Traoré gravitated toward music independently, as a college student, and that same sense of independence has imbued her music with a special quality that sets it apart from that of many of her erstwhile peers. Traoré's outlook has always been notably international in scope, not through compromise-- she sings primarily in Bamana, after all-- but in ambition. While still firmly allied to Mali, Traoré has accepted many opportunities to broaden her own musical palette. In 2006, she premiered an original piece in Vienna as part of a celebration of Mozart's 250th birthday. In 2005, she took part in a tour alongside the likes of Dianne Reeves paying tribute to Billie Holiday. Her 2004 release Bowmboï featured contributions from the Kronos Quartet and drew comparisons to Björk, one presumes not because Traoré's sounds like Björk (she doesn't) but because the two artists share a certain singularity of purpose. Traoré's latest, Tchamantché, proceeds from a similar singularity of purpose, namely the sound of her Gretsch guitar. Indeed, Tchamantché is a guitar album, albeit a guitar album of a particularly understated bent. Engineered by the legendary Phill Brown (whose credits stretch from Bob Marley to Talk Talk), the album is hauntingly spare yet ridiculously well-defined, the timbre and tone of every string presented in perfect resolution, the occasional accompaniment of a rhythm section or Sly Johnson's human beatbox reserved but wholly effective. Yet sharing top billing with those guitar tones is Traoré's voice, powerful without over-projecting, forcing you to meet her halfway rather than wait passively for her to bowl you over. Singing in Bamanan, French, and (in one conspicuous instance) English, Traoré weaves poetic declarations of love, of Africa, of pride. ""Tounka"", in fact, is the rare anti-immigration screed directed toward the potential émigré from their perspective. ""Are we not rich in Congo-Zaire? Are we not rich in Nigeria? Are we not rich in Mali?"" she asks. ""Say no to exodus."" Other tracks are more deeply philosophical. In the aptly titled ""Zen"" Traoré acquiesces to the passage of time with the declaration that ""Day after day, I will afford myself the pleasure of doing nothing."" In the title track, she observes that ""We arrive in this world somewhere between the past and future,"" and that ""balance lies in relativity.""  And then, in the midst of all this solemnity and heaviness (which ultimately needs no translation), Traoré drops an English cover of Gershwin's (by way of Holiday's) ""The Man I Love"", which she first performed as a duet with Reeves and here is sung in accented English, a testament to the borderless nature of all great music. An artist of less integrity might have recorded an entire album of Holiday songs, or more songs sung in English, but Traoré doesn't seem inclined to go that route. There's no need to pander, since the same qualities that make that cover so special flow throughout Tchamantché, namely those gorgeous guitar tones and Traoré's quiet vocals. These twin strands of transnational DNA-- guitar plus vocals-- wend through all music, but here they're made more entrancing by Traoré's refusal to abandon her roots while at the same time working subtly but assiduously to build upon them.",,8.4,
War Child Presents Heroes,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a299c0084474cd0c00a1/1:1/w_160/aacc3245.jpg,2009-02-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12716-war-child-presents-heroes/,Astralwerks,"Despite being written off either as well-meaning fund-raisers or product tie-ins, the various artists comp may be the ideal product for the digital age. Because it has less musical than conceptual cohesion (and sometimes neither), it plays as if on shuffle, one song by one act leading to another song by another act and making no demand on a listener's attention greater than three or four minutes. If/When the album finally surrenders to the single as the primary product of the music industry, various artists comps-- whether tribute albums, charity collections, or soundtracks-- will likely continue to haunt the periphery of the industry, like ghosts of the CD age. Worth at most a listen or two, most have a few solid tracks mixed in with failed experiments or dull B-sides, but usually they're panned as driven more by marketing or good intentions than by solid musical ideas. A good example of possibilities of the form, the 15-track Heroes certainly benefits a good cause: War Child works globally to protect children living in war zones. On top of that, it has an intriguing organizing premise, an approach that sets it apart from others of its ilk. It's a covers album, but rather than pick 15 contemporary artists and have them choose their songs, Heroes takes the opposite tack: The producers asked older artists to pick younger artists to cover their songs. Bob Dylan picked Beck, and wise choice: He turns ""Leopard-Skin Pillbox Hat"" into a Guero stomp-- part T. Rex glam, part Spike Jones noise fest, and nearly unrecognizable from the original. U2 commission Elbow to cover ""Running to Stand Still"", one of the few Joshua Tree tracks that doesn't have U2 stamped all over it. The cover moves more slowly, but with a more psychedelic goal as the band stretch out the coda until it nearly stands still. There are, almost out of obligation, some unimaginative pairings. The Kinks' ""Victoria"" gets covered by the Kooks, which means it's pretty much the same song, and of course Iggy Pop hires former duet partner Peaches to go down on ""Search & Destroy"", which sounds no better, no worse, and no different than you'd imagine. But obvious choices don't always breed obvious results. Estelle turns in what sounds at first like a pretty straight cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"". It's not much of a stretch, but she starts scat-singing the horn line, threads in some wakkachikka guitar, and gives her version its own character. Other pairings are much less obvious and either more satisfying or more puzzling. Duffy transforms Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" into a smoky soul number about the curdling of youthful idealism, opting for seductive rather than ominous or threatening. She even corrects Paul McCartney's infamous grammatical gaffe (""this ever-changing world which we live in,"" she sings with a copyeditor's eye), but I wish she didn't mewl over her consonants: Crisper enunciation might have turned a novelty into a solid reimagining. Rufus Wainwright has better luck choreographing Brian Wilson's ""Wonderful"" and ""Song for Children"" into a charming, droll stage medley, complete with muted trumpets and skipping piano. On their airy cover of ""Transmission"", Hot Chip hang Christmas lights and steel drums on the gloomy despair of the original, no doubt pissing off a lot of Joy Division fans in the process. However, because Alexis Taylor can sound simultaneously downcast and upbeat, this cover retains a kernel of melancholy angst. Other acts on Heroes play a game of what if, exhibiting a deep and playful knowledge of their subjects' histories. What if Bowie had flown west instead of east and recorded in New York rather than Brooklyn? He might have come up with a version of ""Heroes"" as busy and flightless as TV on the Radio's? What if Sheena herself sang ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker""? It'd no doubt sound like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' cover, which is infectious (""What is she, Joey??!!"" Karen O shouts) despite never veering too far from the original. And what if Springsteen had turned those Nebraska demos into an E Street Band album? What if Clarence Clemons had played sax and Roy Bittan had played piano on the central riff of ""Atlantic City""? The Hold Steady may seem like an obvious choice to cover the Boss, but that mantra-- ""Everything dies, that's a fact / Maybe everything that does some day comes back""-- converges nicely with the Catholic imagery of Separation Sunday. And that's the point of V/A comps like this-- well, beyond the pint of raising money and awareness for a worthy cause. It's about hearing your favorite acts in new contexts and discovering new currents of influence between the veterans and the rookies.",,7.0,
Super Roots 10,Boredoms,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a298b1335d7bf1698513/1:1/w_160/2c7c0b57.jpg,2009-02-27 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12715-super-roots-10/,Avex Trax,"Ten years ago it would have been ridiculous to use the word ""formula"" when talking about the music of Osaka's Boredoms. In 1999, they were riding a wave of creativity the likes of which most bands can only dream about. In the year prior they'd released both Super Roots 7, which on better days sounds like the final word on the visceral power of rock'n'roll repetition, and Super Ae, on which they revealed themselves as masters of playful trance-inducing psychedelia with spiritual underpinnings. And they were about to put out Vision Creation Newsun, boasting a gentler but no less immediate vision that seemed, especially after Yamantaka Eye's Rebore Vol. 0 re-working a bit later, to suggest that the musical possibilities in the decade to follow would be endless. All of this came after 10 previous years of painful noise, bad punk, hilarious song titles, pointless screams, and occasionally unmatched rock power. You couldn't pin this band down. But in the decade since Vision Creation Newsun, Boredoms have interrupted long periods of quiet with absurdly grand gestures (the 77 Boadrum and 88 Boadrum events) and a couple of records that referenced or expanded upon past glories but never came close to matching them. Seadrum/House of Sun, from 2005, had two 20-minute-plus tracks that were not nearly as beautiful as the advance word made them sound, even if they managed to summon inspiring amounts of energy. (We heard talk of Eye leading his percussion-toting followers to the edge of the sea to record, conjuring images of the greatest drum-circle jams since the twilight of the Pleistocene.) And then 2007's Super Roots 9 was a 40-minute monster for drummers and pitch-shifted choir that took one thing the Boredoms did well-- gradual builds to ecstatic climaxes-- and let it play out forever. Tracks going on for far too long filled with ideas that were beaten into the ground 10 times over has always been part of the band's M.O. But when releases are so rare, they don't serve the same prankster function that they once did. Now it kind of sounds more like the Boredoms doing that one thing the Boredoms do. Again. Which, if you happen to freaking love that one thing, isn't so terrible. A new Boredoms release is still an event, even if you no longer feel the need to rush out and tell all your friends about it. Super Roots 10 snuck up on people when it appeared for sale on a website in Japan earlier this year (by which time it was already sold out-- I'm reviewing this from downloaded mp3s). It is, with one huge exception I'll get to in a second, just the Boredoms being their post-VCN drum-happy, DayGlo-streaked, build-up-and-breakdown selves. After a short intro of bassy static, we hear a track called ""Ant 10"", which exists in a nine and a half-minute original mix and is then spun off into four different remixes that mostly flow one into the next. So it turns out to be essentially another 40+-minute track. The main features of the original version are layered tribal drums, an analog synth out of early-70s Tangerine Dream running scales, and Eye, sounding as joyful as ever, singing/shouting /chanting ""Ah-u!"" and ""Hey!!!"" and layering his voice in all sorts of fun ways. Toward the end there's some tape manipulation and huge cymbal-rushes, and then everything breaks down to silence, leading into ""Estero 10"", a remix by Japanese producer Altz. The Altz remixes (another of his called ""Mineral Dub Break"" closes) and a remix by someone called DJ Finger Hat (my guess is it's Eye, which would be pseudonym number 1,328) offer an expected range of theme and variations-- drums get a bit housey, voices are extended into drones, Yoshimi's voice is added and layered to sound a little like an interlude from Einstein on the Beach, a guitar pattern is chopped into tiny pieces and sequenced. Even though it's now become so familiar and-- hate to say it-- formulaic, this stuff still has the capacity to thrill. The huge exception to the Boredoms-by-numbers feel is the almost 11-minute mix of ""Ant 10"" by Lindstrøm. The Norwegian producer essentially takes his space disco approach and toughens it up considerably to meet the forward-leaning aggression of Boredoms. Heavy drums find their way to a 4/4 beat augmented by all manner of percussion fills, a Moog sounds for a moment like it's playing the intro to the title theme from Grease, a rubbery funk bassline for the ages folds in, and ""Superstition""-style Clavinet starts bouncing around. There are a million things going on, but it still grooves. Long-time Pitchfork contributor Dominique Leone, who reviewed the last couple of Boredoms releases here and released material last year on Lindstrøm's Feedelity imprint, even drops by, adding some ""Bow bow bow"" vocals at the precise moment they're needed. Even if Lindstrøm's remix is 90% Lindstrøm's and 10% Boredoms, the change-up is hugely welcome. It's like all of a sudden Boredoms find themselves in the middle of a crazy party, where someone left the front door open and you've no idea who is going to wander in next. Time was when all Boredoms get-togethers felt that way.",,7.6,
Two Nice Catholic Boys,Loren ConnorsJim O’Rourke,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a292b1335d7bf1698506/1:1/w_160/5a176586.jpg,2009-02-26 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12709-two-nice-catholic-boys/,Family Vineyard,"Jim O'Rourke is a sly collaborator. It's tempting to call him a chameleon, given the way he slides into musical partnerships without imposing his will on them. But O'Rourke doesn't mimic so much as he finds the parts of his creative personality that best match whoever he's playing with. Think of his affiliations with Wilco and Sonic Youth, his meshing with Jeff Tweedy in Loose Fur and Fennesz and Pita in Fenn O'Berg, his wide-ranging production work with Faust, John Fahey, U.S. Maple, etc. In nearly every case, it's hard to pick out which sounds and ideas are O'Rourke's, but the music is clearly affected by his presence. Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, In Bern, and it's equally true of Two Nice Catholic Boys, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as In Bern. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged. Take the first track, ""Maybe Paris"". It begins with overlapping sheets of fuzz, as the pair ignites flames by rubbing guitar sounds together. The wiry wails sound distinctly Connors-esque, but all the sounds mesh so well, they could be coming from either player. Five minutes in, the track shifts abruptly into sparse, gentle reflection. This section is pure Connors, a hypnotic string of notes that hint at melody but never fall into repetitive patterns. It's stunning how quickly and naturally O'Rourke adapts to this development. The two players circle each other so responsively that the piece is like a sonic Mobius strip. Each note feels like both a leader and follower, as if someone has discovered the world's first four-handed guitarist. ""Or Possibly Koln"" follows, leaning more toward the heavy end, including a thunderous section halfway through. But again, Connors and O'Rourke swerve into a restrained passage, mixing rhythmic loops with single notes in a way that recalls Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison's simple interplay on songs like ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and ""Jesus"". Only on the closer, ""Most Definitely Not Koln"", does the pair drift off-center a bit, with distant sounds that seem oddly disembodied. But even that track wakes up eventually, with a sudden passage of screaming noise on the level of feedback-wranglers like Jimi Hendrix or Keiji Haino. Such peaks are testament to the tenacity of these two accomplished musicians-- even at its most placid points, there's always the threat of surprise lurking around the corners of Two Nice Catholic Boys.","Recorded during the 1997 Euro tour that birthed In Bern, this is the second collaboration between these two avant heroes.

The Blue Depths,Odawas,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29513d19756521388dd/1:1/w_160/da7f97cd.jpg,2009-02-26 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12712-the-blue-depths/,Jagjaguwar,"Originally formed in Indiana and then shuffled across the Midwest to the Bay Area, Odawas have often seemed as much an ambitious studio project as a full-on band. Now trimmed to the core duo of songwriter Michael Tapscott and arranger Isaac Edwards, this is even more the case on The Blue Depths. Fueled by a passion for Vangelis soundtracks, 1980s-era Joni Mitchell, and the West Coast sounds of Jack Nitzsche, Odawas have here clearly chosen to immerse themselves in the enveloping comforts of the studio. On their two previous Jagjaguwar albums, 2005's The Aether Eater and 2007's Raven and the White Night, Odawas dabbled in a little bit of everything: dreamy folk tunes, distorted psych-rock, and expansive high-concept librettos. For The Blue Depths, however, they've left behind nearly all of their more melodramatic art-rock moves, showing a newfound restraint only hinted at on Raven. Here their sound is rich and sumptuous, steeped in the willowy textures of homemade and/or vintage keyboards and Tapscott's yearning, romantic lyricism. Though this more streamlined approach does reduce some of the sheer anything-might-happen thrill of their earlier work, Odawas have here clearly found their niche, and it is a pleasure to listen as they fully commit themselves to this chosen course. The subtle shift in the group's approach is evident from the first notes of ""The Case of the Great Irish Elk"". In the past, Odawas' various acoustic and electronic elements have sometimes co-existed uneasily in the mix, but here everything is submerged into the same graceful and luxuriant stream. Tapscott's acoustic guitar and harmonica are treated and processed in the same manner as Edwards' supple layers of St. Elmo's Fire keyboards, while rogue elements of strings and percussion rise almost invisibly to the surface. As a result, The Blue Depths is by far Odawas most coherent and consistent work, as the duo are able to find a precise sonic and emotional tone and sustain it for the full length of the album's eight tracks. Buoyed by the album's production, Tapscott delivers his most emotive performances to date, though like everything else his lyrics are frequently obscured in the gentle tides of the mix. His vocal style will always draw comparisons to Neil Young, but the electronic arrangements here are unlike anything in Young's catalog, hewing closer to Jason Lytle's work with Grandaddy circa The Sophtware Slump. The homespun radiance of Odawas' production serves to make Tapscott's voice sound all the more fragile and human on such dreamy tracks as ""Our Gentle Life Together"" or ""Moonlight/Twilight"", striking a reassuring harmony between the organic and the artificial. Though there is nothing here quite as majestic and immediately captivating as ""Alleluia"" from Raven and the White Night, on the album's best tracks Tapscott seems effortlessly able to communicate a certain indefinable sense of loss and longing. On the chorus of the shadowy ""Swan Song of the Humpback Angler"" his voice keens with emotion, while the buoyant pop rhythms of ""Harmless Lover's Discourse"" help disguise what might be a lament of goodbye. His vocals drenched in reverb, Tapscott's specific words can get muffled, but more often than not that only helps to add a welcome sense of mystery to The Blue Depths, as for the first time it seems Odawas know precisely where they want to go and how they plan to get there.","Jagjaguwar band leaves behind most of its melodramatic art-rock moves, showing a newfound restraint and a rich and sumptuous sound.

I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful,Nimrod Workman,by: Stephen M.

When he recorded the sessions that make up I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful, he was 87 years old but had a mighty voice, a keen sense of humor, and a strong memory, recalling songs he had learned at the beginning of his life. Born in rural Kentucky in 1895, he began working in the coalmines at 14, and when he retired more than 40 years later, it was only due to a slipped disc and black lung. He was a union man, marching with Mother Jones in the 1920s and lobbying Congress in the 1960s for black lung compensation. He drank, smoked, fathered 13 children with his wife Mollie, released two albums in the 1970s, inspired a documentary, appeared in Coal Miner's Daughter in 1980, and recorded these Beautiful sessions in 1982. Never trained as a musician, the octogenarian sings with all the giddy irreverence of a five-year-old. These sessions were recorded by Mike Seeger, a musician and folklorist (and Pete Seeger's half-brother) who received an NEA Folk Arts grant to document Workman's vast repertoire of songs. He spent several days at the singer's home in East Tennessee, interviewing and capturing his off-the-cuff performances. With no accompaniment, Workman rattles off hymns, jigs, comic tunes, dance numbers, war whoops, and Appalachian ballads, his sandpapery voice ringing clear with every note. It doesn't take much prompting to get him started talking about his grandfather's service in the ""Yankee Rebel war"" or about the long hours in the mines, when he would sing to himself while he loaded the coal cars. Workman is certainly entertaining company. He keens out ""Casey Jones"" with remarkable power and worries over mortality on the eerie ""Oh Death"". Toothless, he makes a mash of consonants, but spits out the impossibly wordy ""Good Morning"" and ""Little David, Play on Your Harp"" with fast-talking verve and precision. He composed innumerable songs, but rarely, if ever, wrote them down: ""42 Years"" and ""Coal Black Mining Blues"" have real gravity in their low-key melodies, the latter stopping abruptly so Workman can recount his fight to make black lung a medically recognized ailment. A few tracks later, he's savoring the nonsense syllables of ""Sourwood Mountain"" and testifying mightily on the traditional ""Barbara Allen"". For Workman as for many of his generation, singing served a very different purpose than it does for most current artists. During a time when music had a largely social function-- providing entertainment at gatherings or simply a reason to gather-- circumstances made it a solitary pursuit for him: Workman sang to keep himself company in the mines and to derive that simple pleasure from creating a joyful noise. His memory remained strong, recalling songs several decades old that still carried powerful meaning for him. He treats them like old friends, and that affection makes I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful not simply a catalog of 20th-century songs, but an amusing and affecting record of a man gleefully singing his autobiography.",,8.8,
To Be Still,Alela Diane,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a297c0084474cd0c009b/1:1/w_160/43bb86e2.jpg,2009-02-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12714-to-be-still/,Rough Trade,"Alela Diane's new record may come as a pleasant surprise to those who haven't checked in on the Portland-based singer-songwriter since 2006's The Pirate's Gospel. On that charming but demo-ish jumble sale of an album Diane sorted through familiar folk forms (sea shanty, blues lament, narrative ballad) with a couple of chords and some sleepy arpeggios. If neither her vision nor her musicianship changed the conversation about the then-full-flowering new folk scene, Diane's arresting voice-- simultaneously vehement and serene-- put plenty of people on notice, including, apparently, a sizeable chunk of France. (Her Blogotheque Take-Away Show illustrates why big in France isn't necessarily aspersive: With her mass of dark hair and chic short boots, the girl was born to busk Paris' boulevards.) Still, Diane thus far has played in the shadow of better-known Nevada City, Calif., product (and childhood friend) Joanna Newsom. As inevitable the comparison, it's not a very sensitive tool for evaluating either artists' work. Newsom, after all, pens wildly idiosyncratic songs for the harp and sings them in... a voice that takes some getting used to. On the aesthetically focused, meticulously arranged To Be Still, Diane is a traditionalist, partial to broad, universal themes-- nature, childhood, family, friends-- and gentle, lilting melodies that recall traditional ballads. She's also ditched many of the vocal tics and lower-pitch ranges that lent Pirate's Gospel a haunting melancholy and drew adjectives like ""eccentric"" but, in retrospect, better suit someone like Jolie Holland. Diane demonstrated her broad range and flexibility, interpreting songs by artists as disparate as Vashti Bunyan, Jesus and Mary Chain, and Daniel Johnston on 2008's The Silence of Love, which she recorded with some musician friends as Headless Heroes. To Be Still will never fire up any parties, but its emotional range is as wide as that covers project's-- from ""Age Old Blue"", a wistful duet with craggy-voiced troubadour Michael Hurley about Diane's sharecropping Scottish ancestors, to the flushed-cheek, string-surging ""My Brambles"". Lead track ""Dry Grass and Shadows"" sets a playful tone, the sigh of steel pedal underlining her languid, country-twangy come-on: ""I like to look at your teeth lined up in perfect rows... Where the flatlands stretch inside your mouth/ And when you laugh all the star thistles tumble out."" A little hippie-dippy, but also utterly enchanting. The album's first single, ""White as Diamonds"", best showcases her expanded musical ambitions and the record's pristine sound (coproduced with her bluegrass musician father in his studio). Two years ago, accompanied by acoustic guitar, Diane previewed the newly hatched song for Daytrotter (second station of the cross for up-and-comers after Blogotheque) and claimed ""Diamonds"" is about silence and uh, snow. Disingenuous-sounding, for sure, but it's not like she's the first artist who'd prefer not to parse lyrics. She's also absolutely right: Simplicity is key to the song's stark power, and its uncluttered vocabulary of fiddle, cello, guitar and drawn-out, warbled ""wooooahs"" are as head-clearing as a cold February morning. Fill its white spaces with what you will. When people speak of Diane's voice Sandy Denny's name comes up with increasing frequency, and the young American certainly shares her British predecessor's grace and gusto. But To Be Still is rooted in a different geography-- jagged California hills and faded towns that might be populated by doomed Steinbeck characters. In ""The Ocean"", the thick thump of bongos and a nervous flutter of mandolin sketch the numbing existence of a mountain woman who, landlocked by ""dirt ditch paths and pine cones... old hubcaps on the picket fence,""  dreams of the sea. It's a hybridized folk idiom and undeniably American. Working with material hog-tied to the past and performed with traditional trappings puts Diane at some risk for creative stagnation and worse-- the kind of anonymity and irrelevance enjoyed by vast swathes of the contemporary folk universe. To Be Still avoids these traps thanks to Diane's spectacular voice and, well, the little, mostly indescribable things. The record's best moment comes somewhere in the center of the cautiously joyful ""The Alder Trees"". As Diane, easy-swaying sings ""girls clapping,"" a ragged clap-- hollow and a touch behind the beat-- emits from the back of the room. It's the kind of perfect little flaw that makes a record almost perfect, almost flawless.",,8.0,
Dark Was the Night,Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29bea9e61561daa4aaa/1:1/w_160/bf2a2016.jpg,2009-02-26 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12717-dark-was-the-night/,4AD,"Charity albums all start wonderfully-- with good intentions and noble causes. Alas, they frequently end poorly, entering the world as collections of outtakes, abandoned ideas, and uninspired covers. Whether that matters is another thing: If you share Natalie Portman's interest in the value of microcredit, or any number of executive producers' hope for more Darfur awareness or money for Doctors Without Borders, getting a decent Death Cab song or Afrobeat comp should simply be a bonus ""thank you"" for your minimal contribution. For 20 years, the Red Hot Organization has been-- along with War Child, more on them in the upcoming days-- the gold standard for the charity album. Battling HIV and AIDS via pop culture, Red Hot came out of the gate with an eclectic winner, the Cole Porter covers record Red Hot + Blue (1990). Most of our readers are likely more familiar with their 1993 No Alternative disc, which collected tracks from Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Pavement, and others. Two decades later, they follow with Dark Was the Night, a collection of 31 new and exclusive songs from most of the heavy hitters of the NPR-friendly wing of indie music. Produced by Red Hot, along with the National's Bryce and Aaron Dessner, the vast majority of the songs on this collection are worth owning regardless of where the money is going. The first of the two CDs, in particular, is full of gems. David Byrne and Dirty Projectors keep their vocal affectations on the right side of awesome on ""Knotty Pine""; Feist adeptly teams with Death Cab's Ben Gibbard on a cover of Vashti Bunyan's ""Train Song"" and later slow burns through the outstanding Grizzly Bear collaboration ""Service Bell""; and both Yeasayer's nimble ""Tightrope"" and My Brightest Diamond's smoky version of ""Feeling Good"" are eyebrow-raising lateral moves. A few things that looked a bit too on-the-nose on paper turn out to work: Bon Iver, in the process of breaking away from the lazy ""guy in a Wisconsin cabin"" narrative, delivers a song about... a small town in Wisconsin; the Books, a half-cello, half-electronics duo, and José González, a Nick Drake-like singer-songwriter still best known for his covers, get together to do Nick Drake's ""Cello Song""; Kronos Quartet boldly transform Blind Willie Johnson's gut-wrenching, crucifixion-inspired 1927 blues moan ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"" (the track that gives the comp its name) into a chamber ensemble piece. Not to be outdone by their invitees, the National shout-out Pavement on the languid ""So Far Around the Bend"", recalling Pavement doing the same to one of their favorite bands (R.E.M.) on No Alternative. Aaron Dessner pairs with Bon Iver for one of the record's several ghostly tracks, ""Big Red Machine"", while brother Bryce goes one better, teaming with Antony Hegarty to cover Bob Dylan's take of the traditional ballad ""I Was Young When I Left Home"". Antony in particular shines, giving it a somber matter-of-fact reading that lends the entire song, not just the purgatory of its final verse, a note of tragedy. Disc One saves its best for last though: Sufjan Stevens breaks his relative silence with a cover of the Castanets' ""You Are the Blood"", scrapping his baroque preciousness for tactile avant-pop. Infusing the track with a twitchy, restless quality, Stevens re-imagines the song-- musically as well as lyrically-- as a tussle between the subject and his body, an appropriately haunting quality for this compilation. (Buck 65's remix, ""Blood Pt. 2"", isn't as successful.) Stevens teams a more cacophonous version of his traditional arsenal of horns and choral vocals with the sort of minimalist electronics he leaned more heavily on in the days before he earned indie-level fame. Disc Two is more of a mixed bag. Spoon kick it off with a badly needed injection of rhythm; their ""Well-Alright"" feels like the jaunty bar-bandisms that used to soundtrack National Lampoon films-- think ""I'm Alright"" or ""Holiday Road"". Arcade Fire follow with a similar but less-interesting version of the same idea. From there things oscillate between meh and engaging, with quality contributions from the New Pornographers (covering one of their bandmate Dan Bejar's Destroyer songs), Yo La Tengo, Riceboy Sleeps (featuring members of Sigur Rós), and Conor Oberst with Gillian Welch. Standing out even more positively, My Morning Jacket's laid-back ""El Caporal"" and Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings' swivel-hipped Shuggie Otis cover ""Inspiration Information"" bring warmth to the proceedings; Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch-- one of the few non-North Americans here-- adds lyrics to an old Scottish folk song, and the resulting ""Another Saturday"" is one more quiet triumph for him in a career full of them. Best in class on this disc, however, goes to TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, whose version of the Troggs' ""With a Girl Like You"" is like a Stephin Merritt pastiche with horns grafted onto it, but it's glorious because of, rather than despite, its obvious homage. I confess though: My first reaction to listening to this all the way through was negative. When focusing on what's not here rather than what is, Dark Was the Night comes off as a gray, monotone look at the current indie landscape and, as a result, works best in small batches. It's missing not only rhythm and electronics-- more hip-hop, anything in the DFA axis, M.I.A., Animal Collective, etc.-- but volume and velocity as well. Sure, it's a charity record not a party soundtrack, but No Alternative was full of actual rock songs. On this evidence, today's guitar-based indie is primarily folkie tunefulness, baroque lines in which the guitar is subservient to other instruments, or, based on the original Simon Reynolds definition of the word, post-rock: ""Using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords."" Dissecting the reasons for this and determining the consequences, if any, is another matter altogether, but it's a shame that the diversity of previously successful charity comps-- the Red Hot ones mentioned, War Child's The Help Album-- is missing here. Naturally these artists are more popular than their experimental, electronic, and rock brethren-- Gang Gang Dance, Air France, or No Age would sell fewer records than the Decemberists on any day of the week-- but the idea that rock is less central than folk music in underground North American music is not only really weird but a very new phenomenon. Again though, these songs are uniformally excellent, so it's a minor and possibly misplaced quibble. And, who knows, maybe-- hopefully!-- Red Hot is in the process of asking the Hold Steady or Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Hot Chip or the Knife, to help craft sequels.","Red Hot comp features Arcade Fire, Spoon, Feist, Decemberists, Cat Power, Antony, Bon Iver, members of Sigur Rós, and many others.

Recovery,MatmosFenneszJason ForrestRyoji IkedaBarbara MorgensternSNDMika Vainio,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28d13d19756521388d1/1:1/w_160/a983a638.jpg,2009-02-25 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12704-recovery/,Fractured,"I'm sitting on the floor, next to the stereo, computer in my lap. I'm listening to songs like ""Running Up That Hill"" and ""Billie Jean"" and ""Back in Black"". I'm parked here next to the turntable because I'm playing 7"" singles, which means I need to be ready to put something new on every three or four minutes. But something strange is going on: ""Back in Black"" consists only of a couple of sine wave tones for bass and a few blasts of white noise static for the guitar riff; ""Billie Jean"" is little more than a few clicks, and you can just barely make out the bassline; and I can't tell you what is going on with this crazy ""Running Up That Hill"". Recovery is a 7"" box set (10 singles, 20 tracks) put out by the Fractured label. It comes housed in thick box and the design of the set (by Graham Dolphin) is sharp and well put together but not too fancy. It feels a bit more like an art object more than a functional set of music, which I guess is appropriate. The people behind Recovery asked 20 artists working in the realm of experimental music-- they are drone purveyors, laptop abstractionists, extreme techno minimalists, and improvisers, but they don't have much truck with popular music-- to cover a song from the past that's been especially significant to them. So we get extreme minimalist Ryoji Ikeda doing AC/DC, UK click'n'cutters SND doing Michael Jackson, and Mika Vanio, best known for his post-industrial work in Pan Sonic, doing Kate Bush. In the best tracks here you can hear a sense of discovery and the fresh crackle of energy that comes from two aesthetics colliding. Richard Chartier makes highly detailed microsound pieces, and Russian producer/composer CoH is too prolific to pin down, though he has a fondness the harsh and noisy. But they come together on for a version of Soft Cell's ""Bleak Is My Favorite Cliché"", slowing the original to half-speed, adding some mechanized hum, and whispering the lyrics. It feels like isolationism/dark ambient soundscaping mixed with proper goth, and the effect is thrilling. BJ Nilsen, best known now for his albums of field recordings, covers Joy Division's ""Heart and Soul"", keeping the tense, grinding groove of the original almost exactly but fleshes it out with judiciously placed distortion, and the affection he brings to the material is palpable. Thoughtful re-works these might be, but the pleasures are immediate and obvious. Matmos' terrific choice of cover, Bow Wow Wow's ""C30, C60, C90, Go!"", is a sly reminder that Recovery is a defiantly physical object (vinyl-only, no mp3s), comprised of songs from a time when all music could be held in the hand. Google the lyrics of the 1980 hit and marvel at how accurately they predict present modes of music consumption (Matmos thought enough of the words to print them on the 7"" label here). Matmos also deliver musically, mirroring the clattering Burundi beat of Bow Wow Wow quite closely while adding some wicky high-pitched squelches and whispered vocals for a net effect that is cartoonish and playful. (Here I note that Matmos' Drew Daniel has written for Pitchfork.) The flip of the Matmos single is Barbara Morgenstern doing New Order's ""Temptation"", which serves as a reminder of how hard it is to mess up a brilliant song, though her slightly awkward phrasing and modest bedroom pop production nicely play up the song's vulnerability. Interesting but perhaps not surprising is that most of the songs chosen come from the 1980s and, depending on how broad your definition, can be loosely classified as new wave. It's a clear reminder of how much sway that era held for artists later working in the electronic field, even the bands that haven't since been canonized. Both Fennesz' version of A-Ha's ""Hunting High and Low"" and Jóhann Jóhannsson's take on OMD's ""Souvenir"" zero in on the lush romanticism of the new pop era's sonics, blowing things up to 70mm widescreen proportions. Though in the press notes for the set Jóhannsson claims that his track is ""revenge"" for being seduced by OMD as a kid before later discovering their superior influences, these two tracks feel like loving homages that demonstrate how almost any song's unexplored corners can be transformed into something new by a good listener. Serving as counterweights to these highs are the handful of tracks that seem like conceptual goofs, some of which are pretty fun (Ikeda on ""Back in Black"") some of which are boring (Vanio's track is nice enough, but its relationship to Kate Bush is vague at best) and some of which seem pointless (never really dug SND's original stuff, and this ""Billie Jean"" does nothing for me.) It goes out without saying that cover comps these days are a dime a dozen. Indie artists pay tribute to heroes, smirk along to guilty pleasures, and logroll with like-minded contemporaries to keep their names in the blogs. It seems a harmless trend, if uninspiring. But the artists here aren't involved in such games. These are intellectual types, people with concepts, who think things through when taking on new projects. Recovery reflects this more cerebral and considered stance, and some of these covers seem like commentaries or venues to work through ideas more than musical tributes (or, for that matter, send-ups). Which means that Recovery is ""interesting"" more often than it's ""fun."" But there's still enough variety in the mix to make the whole project worthwhile.","Recovery is a 7"" box set (10 singles, 20 tracks) put out by the Fractured label; the imprint asked 20 artists working in the realm of experimental music to cover a song, and the results include Matmos doing Bow Wow Wow, Jóhann Jóhannsson on OMD, Barbara Mortgenstern tackling New Order, and Fennesz covering A-Ha.

Fabric 42,Âme,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27c9d034d5c69bf2be9/1:1/w_160/6bccf8c7.jpg,2009-02-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12696-fabric-42/,Fabric,"Âme's career has been a long voyage into sternness-- from 2005's eerie classic ""Rej"" onwards, the German duo have progressively shed the playfulness and levity of their prior lush disco-house blueprint. In most cases they've gained more than they lost: From the shamanic trance of 2006's ""Where We At"" (in collaboration with Henrik Scwharz and Dixon) to the dynamic surge of 2007's ""Balandine"" and ""Enoi"", the increasing seriousness of Âme's aesthetic is never in vain. In fact the portentousness of their sound is of the best sort, not so much awesome as itself awed and alienated by some apocalyptic vision somewhere off-screen. But in taking this route, Âme are swimming against the tide, discovering the strange joy of masochistic submission at the same time as their peers retreat further into the safe harbor of deep house re-re-revivalism. So while 2007's Coast 2 Coast mix was a near-perfect document of the latter impulse (reveling in the soft warmth of deep house old and new), they spend much of Fabric 42 carefully retracing the steps of a scene that is abandoning them, offering up a combination of viscous minimal techno and rigorous tech-house; the vibe starts off anxious, ends up muscular, and on the way somehow bypasses ""sexy"" and ""soulful"" altogether. Fabric 42 certainly shares Coast to Coast's lack of pretension, more interested in constructing a cruisy, enveloping feel than making any kind of statement or wowing with its diversity; but whereas the easy gentility of Coast to Coast's deep house sound made it a charming home listening or dinner party staple, Fabric 42 is just hard-edged enough to seem slightly ill-suited to any context other than the dancefloor itself. All of which serves to make Fabric 42 appear rather inessential, and I must confess that I found it hard to pay adequate attention at first. It doesn't help that Âme have deliberately avoided including any established or even potential bangers, with the exceptions of their own churning epic ""D.P.O.M.B."" (a homage to DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" early-1990s house sound, again composed in collaboration with Schwarz and Dixon) and the riveting old school techno classic ""Loop"" by LFO vs Fuse-- included at the end of this mix like a victory lap, the hour-long grimace of concentration relaxing into a broad, triumphant grin. Earlier, things can get a bit grim at times, although not always for the worse: The ungainly groove of Jens Zimmerman's ""Modmod Blubbblub"" is not at all helped by the pseudo-existential wordplay of its detached narrator vocal, but the far superior ""Raw Structure"" by Edward (seething old school house propping up an excoriating slam poetry vocal) shares the explosive furrow-browed intensity of its blueprint, Green Velvet's ""Preacher Man"". It's a grimness that has to sneak up on you to work. When I actively concentrate on the music, I want a lascivious diva vocal, an impudent piano riff, or a camp string arrangement to appear somewhere, anywhere; switch my concentration to something else, though, and the music's inexhaustible physicality takes on a compulsive power, locking in to the ""jack"" component of house with a fierceness you'd think would be beyond two effete German boys. And, as usual, Âme distinguish themselves with some inspired (if unflashy) transitions: the arrival of the skanking waterlogged drums of STL's ""Something Is Raw"" over the top of the fading acid bleeps of Armando's ""Don't Take It"" sounds so perfect, so exact in its unlikely mix'n'match, that the eventual emergence of the dominant organ riff on STL's track seems vaguely disappointing. The duo spend much of the second half of the mix alluding to their taste for all things ""Wild Pitch""-- a weakness they share with Tiefscwharz, who have plotted a similar stylistic trajectory from lush prettiness to riotous intensity. What's at stake here is nothing less than the function of dance music itself: unlike other current revivalist trends, Wild Pitch revivalism maintains a vision of house music as rave-flavoured and populist rather than soulful and specialist. This secret compact with hectic populism survives as a ghostly undercurrent even when Fabric 42 threatens to get a bit dour and greyscale, and it's that undercurrent that makes those moments worth sitting (or, better, scrubbing) through.","The German duo behind ""Rej"" and other recent 12"" wonders offers the famed Fabric mix series a combination of viscous minimal techno and rigorous tech-house.

Choral,Mountains,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27eb1335d7bf16984ec/1:1/w_160/6a9fe593.jpg,2009-02-25 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12698-choral/,Thrill Jockey,"Thrill Jockey claims that most of Choral, the third album from Brooklyn drone-duo Mountains, was recorded without overdubs, the group's guitars and organs and various other noisemakers looped and fractured mostly in real time. It's a semi-unique practice for quasi-experimental, long-form composition but ultimately one of those ""it sounds like a turntable but it's really a guitar""-constructs that matters very little when a record is coming out of your speakers. This is especially true when the duo's bushel-full of ""organic"" instruments (""Metal bowl?"" ""Books?"") are garbled to the point where they are unrecognizable anyway. But Choral is still the most coherent Mountains offering yet, its six tracks moving in definable, familiar arcs. The eponymous opening track feels transformative, an a.m. burst of percolating electronic undercurrents, reverberating piano chords, and wordless sighs. Each of its nearly 13 minutes is perfectly balanced, a base to whatever acids exist in your headspace. Mountains are Brendon Anderegg and Koen Holtkamp; they founded the Apestaartje label in 1999 and have produced two albums of nimbly grand, organ-driven drone since 2005. Since their eponymous debut they've been unwinding their unwieldy compositions, leaving tracks whose instrumentation and mood hew closer to folk music than the electronic tone-poems of some of their peers. The duo works mostly with recognizable sounds-- an organ key held until the gain huffs and pants, shimmering 12-strings, ruminative accordion swells-- and even when they employ electronic noises their compositions seem pleasantly threadbare. The Fahey-lite acoustic pickings on ""Map Table"" solidifies the idea that ""avant-folk"" is probably as appropriate a title for Mountains' work as drone or ambient. Choral's palpitations and slow climbs make a comparison to someone like Jack Rose seem like a stretch, but Mountains can find camp near the warmed explorations of Charalambides or Six Organs of Admittance. On ""Melodica"" the plateau'd organs act like a bug zapper for skittering detritus before the track yields to pillowy, fingerpicking. ""Telescope"" laces together humble electric guitars, resembling the slight dissonances of Flying Saucer Attack or Windy & Carl. The bubbling loops of ""Add Infinity"" buoy the song's lake-clear acoustic thrum. Mountains remain fairly straight-laced for an experimental project, and Choral contains many moments of blissful saturation. But the duo's build-build-fuzz-comedown formula leads to shiny moments that are pleasing but not exactly hard-earned. ""Add Infinity"" abandons its ear-pricking acoustic progression and descends into a typical white-noise fog; ""Telescope"" suspends movement for a long, trebly note before it fades; even ""Melodica"" rises to a cinematic swell. Aurally pleasing moments, all, but their inevitability precludes the total blissouts those tracks suggest. As a result, Choral sometimes feels staid and a little postcard-y: a pretty gesture that fails to eclipse the experience of actually going somewhere. That's OK: The best parts of Choral-- the title track, ""Melodica"", most of ""Add Infinity""-- suggest that the band's moniker refers less to the vistas their music may or may not evoke and instead to the shifting strata of sound they create. On Choral, Mountains arrange those layers in ways just subtle and precise enough to shift your headspace.","Brooklyn-based drone duo offers up their most coherent album yet, balancing organic instrumentation with percolating electronic undercurrents.

An Imaginary Country,Tim Hecker,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2905e6ef9596932043f/1:1/w_160/56856319.jpg,2009-02-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12707-an-imaginary-country/,Kranky,"The first thing that comes to mind when considering Tim Hecker's work is his sense of scale. The Montreal-based drone composer has, over the course of the decade, built oceans of ambient noise capable of submerging his listener. His last album, 2006's Harmony in Ultraviolet, took this large-canvas technique to its logical end, so for his latest project, Hecker focuses instead on shorter individual pieces-- albeit with the same deliberateness and meticulous detail we've come to expect from him. An Imaginary Country is, as its title suggests, an otherworldly landscape. Serving as our tour guide, Hecker uses each track to dream up one of its distinct regions, necessitating his more tightly focused approach. Take this journey with Hecker and you'll be introduced to the coastal tide ebb and flow on ""The Inner Shore"", the track's synths inhaling and exhaling to mirror the current's natural rhythm. On ""A Stop at the Chord Cascades"", a wall of descending chimes recalls the titular waterfall. And while there isn't much human life on this predominantly instrumental voyage, ""Utropics"" brings you closest to Hecker's imagined natives: A choir of haunted voices far off in the distance. Hecker is able to achieve this transportive quality because he paints these portraits in painstaking three-dimensional detail; the music is strikingly colorful. That said, An Imaginary Country isn't purely concept-driven or a kind of ambient-techno pop-up book. Like all worthwhile atmospheric music, there's a sense of choose-your-own-adventure here that allows the listener to build his own interpretations. Alongside his more vivid storytelling, Hecker also wisely brings a broadened emotional palette to the record. A primary criticism of his prior work was that, while gorgeous and immense, his compositions often came across as studied and technical to the point of feeling impersonal. (See Harmony in Ultraviolet's academic ""Harmony in Blue"" suite.) With An Imaginary Country, though, Hecker appears willing to address those concerns and more eager to convey drama. On ""Paragon Point"", he juxtaposes dissonant shoegaze chords with feathery choral synths to create a poignant, hopeful heartache. Like stepping into the sunlight after a long, depressive stretch indoors, the song expresses regret at time lost but also a sense of optimism for a new day. Together with these displays of deeper sentiment, Hecker also showcases here a capacity for coaxing natural textures out of his electronic arrangements. Album centerpiece ""Borderlands"" demonstrates it best, where he establishes a plane of twinkling, piano-like synths and lets gentle gusts of organic noise drift above it. The digitally rendered effect feels remarkably untreated, somehow indistinguishable from the earthly gust of wind it mimics. This naturalism, combined with Hecker's sense of fantasy and mirage, is part of what makes the album such a satisfying listen. Most impressive, though, is that Hecker has built for us this make-believe area to inhabit, to explore with him. While there's a bit less room in this space than those he's constructed before, it's still very much an achievement, and one to be celebrated.",,7.7,
Invaders Must Die,The Prodigy,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28f5e6ef9596932043d/1:1/w_160/488036ae.jpg,2009-02-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12706-invaders-must-die/,Take Me to the Hospital,"By the time he'd wrapped up his first decade recording as the Prodigy, Liam Howlett had released at least a dozen great singles, from his earliest squeaky rave classics to the snarling big beat that made him a millionaire in the late 1990s. Howlett's proudly inelegant grooves made him a boogieman among critics allergic to bubblegum, even as the Prodigy enjoyed the kind of mass culture success that any dance producer would secretly envy. If you want to take a break from minimal techno to relive the rush of zillions-selling mainstream dance-- and you've misplaced your Chemical Brothers collection-- any of the three solid albums the Prodigy released between 1992 and 1997 will do the trick nicely. Unfortunately, as he now wraps up his second decade recording as the Prodigy, the nicest thing you can say about Howlett is that his healthy attitude toward self-cannibalization occasionally makes for decent music. Very occasionally. 2004's Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned-- the first Prodigy full-length following 1997's multi-platinum, America-wooing The Fat of the Land-- was mostly a crass reiteration of Howlett's greatest financial success, offering slight tweaks to Fat's booming breakbeats and pissed-off rock vocals. But if you stuck to the singles you could almost hear the glowstick gleam of the old hooks under the not-so-scary noise. The new Invaders Must Die, however, may in fact be a cry for help. Howlett will not be budged from his noisy comfort zone, however much his fanbase shrinks in the face of creative burnout. From the first track through its final seconds, Invaders joylessly stomps through overly familiar territory. It's another lunkheaded, loud mash-up of rock and dance, a sound now so beefed-up and campy that it's perhaps only suitable for shotgunning cheap beer and practicing UFC chokeholds with your pals. The album-opening fade-in is about the only subtle touch on Invaders; Howlett's music is more intractably aggressive than ever before. When he takes an instrumental breather on Invaders, with ""Omen Reprise"", the result's closer to the dumb, portentous rush of a gabba techno track, minus the drums. As for the ""songs,"" Howlett's motley crew of vocalists pull out all of the sneers and grimaces and nu-metal tricks to match the music's testosterone level. To say nothing of the volume level: The Jamaican chatter on ""Thunder"" sounds like he's straining to be heard over a double-decker stack of Marshalls, rather than nicing up the local dance. One track at a time, it sorta works, even with the non-stop bludgeoning of the rhythm programming and Howlett's complete lack of taste in rock. What doesn't work is an album that tries to fill even half its running time with Mockneys shouting dumb-ass catchphrases like ""your world's on fire"" over hip-house so heavily distorted it's become one big digital smear. Who knew we'd one day praise ""Smack My Bitch Up"" for its relative sonic nuance? Even a quarter-hour of Howlett's music has become exhausting. Blessedly but briefly, halfway through Invaders the non-stop stadium rock posturing gives way to a fond look back the Prodigy's earliest (and best) records. ""Take Me to the Hospital"" and ""Warriors Dance""-- with their diva samples and sped-up dancehall soundbites and ambulance sirens and all the trimmings-- are the cheap tracks of the Prodigy's first phase re-budgeted for an era of shrill French techno and restraint-free blog house. They're pretty thrilling. But only a track later here's Prodigy pal Dave Grohl laying down a meathead motorik rhythm while Howlett displays a cringeworthy fascination with the oompah keyboards of modern day ""clownstep"" drum 'n' bass. At least it sounds like he's having fun. But then you'd expect Howlett-- a 37-year-old man who's made a pretty penny by shamelessly holding onto the hormonally-amped constitution of a teenager-- would still find enjoyment in this stuff. For the rest of the planet, Howlett's brand of glee may no longer provide the same rush as when we were on the cusp of adulthood, fist-pumping to Fat of the Land. While it'd be nice if Howlett found a new generation of teenage dirtbags to take our places, the occasional burst of cloddish nostalgia-- dig that old school house piano on ""World's on Fire""-- doesn't alleviate the sad fact that even the Prodigy's singles, a source of mild throwback pleasure as little as four years ago, have becoming a slog.",,5.8,

Molly Schnick won't be getting back the 10 years she spent as cellist with Bay-Area-turned-Brooklyn electro-punks Out Hud, but she's been spending the time since their 2005 breakup with herself again. On the debut of solo project Jean on Jean, Schnick wonders aloud whether she's losing her taste for the nightlife. The answer, based on this strummy bedroom chamber-pop U-turn, is a qualified yes. Jean on Jean boots almost everything about Schnick's old band, down to the dub-chamber vocal effects and Fall Out Boy-like song titles. The songs themselves convey intimate, everyday experiences with homespun charm. Over the uncharacteristic electronic beats of ""Cold Horse"", the narrator gets to her train station, then to one of life's forks in the road; ""You and I"" makes ""a sink of party dishes"" a metaphor for what's left after lost love. A couple of the most emotionally resonant tracks for me raise the sorts of questions people nearing 30 might jot in their FaceSpace/Twimblr. ""Will I ever again own the night?"" Schnick asks between castanets and tambourine on ""Grown"". To which methodical working-stiff lament ""Change"" appends, ""Where is the harm in comfort/ And not going out at night?"" A gentle soul throughout, Schnick layers her endearingly plainspoken vocals over cellos, ramshackle guitars, keyboards, various reverb-coated percussion instruments, and, on wavy beach meditation ""Hawaii"", even bird noises. The album is almost always more intricate than its modest tone suggests, with the best tracks recalling wallflower tunesmiths from the Zombies' Colin Blunstone to the Softies. (Schnick cites Blunstone and late California folkie Judee Sill as influences; Blunstone's catchier, Sill's twangier, and Jean on Jean can't match either great just yet.) Opener ""Tonight"", the first video selection, may not quite make you pull over to the side of the road the way its narrator does, but it's right up there with the Headlights' similar 2008 track ""Cherry Tulips"". Schnick's string arrangements, meanwhile, should grab some fans of Joanna Newsom, Andrew Bird, or Beirut-- see the classically elegant bridge on finale ""Finally"". If you can root against Schnick as she goes it alone in such a super vulnerable way, you're an asshole. But that doesn't mean her album is flawless-- pretty sure that's part of the appeal. The one-two punch of ""Circle"", a folkier number with Schnick's breath as percussion, and ""Summer"", with 1960s psych-pop keyboards and harmonies, walks the line between minimal and monotonous. For such a pop-tinged album, choruses in general tend to be a bit unremarkable; for such a personal-sounding album, a couple of lyrics ring jarringly un-conversational notes here or there. That Jean on Jean isn't perfect piles heartache on heartache. But it shouldn't stop a small, hopefully devoted cult from cherishing this album. And it shouldn't stop Schnick from trying on her Canadian tuxedo again some other rainy day. For wild nights out, there's still her guest work with ex-!!! guy John Pugh's Free Blood.","Former Out Hud cellist Molly Schnick drops almost everything about her former band on this new project, a collection of strummy bedroom chamber-pop.

Recordings 1969-1988,Ursula Bogner,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27a5e6ef95969320411/1:1/w_160/3a7aedf7.jpg,2009-02-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12694-recordings-1969-1988/,Faitiche,"According to German electronic musician Jan Jelinek, the homemade recordings of the late Ursula Bogner might never have been heard outside her immediate family had Jelinek not discovered them through a random encounter with Bogner's son. I say ""according to"" because rumors that Bogner's story is a hoax-- a cover for music Jelinek made himself-- have already circulated. Some cite the recordings' rather clean fidelity, odd for music purported to be this old and inexpensively produced; others claim to hear Jelenik's minimal style in Bogner's simple compositions. Then there's the fact that Recordings 1969-1988 is the first release on Jelinek's label, Faitiche-- a name the label's own website claims is a French/German hybrid meaning ""factish,"" or ""a combination of facts and fetishes [that] makes it obvious that the two have a common element of fabrication."" Barring any denials or confirmations from Jelinek, that's probably all we'll ever know. His entertaining liner notes make Bogner's story seem plausible. Born in Germany in 1946, she became a pharmacist, wife, and mother by her early twenties, but still found spare time to study painting, printing, and electronic music. The latter interest led her to record her own synthesizer-based compositions on reel-to-reel tapes in a studio she built herself. Some songs survived intact, while others had to be assembled by Jelinek from individual, unmixed tracks. The truth of this tale is ultimately a minor concern, because as intriguing as the story is, the songs on Recordings 1969-1988 are much more interesting. Bogner's work fits squarely in the world of early electronic music-- the period from the late 1950s to the early 70s, when synthesizers were so new that using them to craft melodic songs and create abstract sound were both considered ""experimental"" pursuits. The king of this era was Raymond Scott, whose whimsical jazz was adopted for cartoon soundtracks, and whose electronic inventions resulted in radio commercials, Jim Henson film scores, and unique curios like Soothing Sounds for Baby, a series intended to help parents pacify their infants. Bogner's music bears much of Scott's playful spirit, finding common ground between nursery-rhyme simplicity and the absurd humor of abstract art. Some of these songs are practically direct Scott rip-offs, but you can also hear echoes of Scott contemporaries and descendants: the radio concoctions of Daphne Oram, the comic pop of Perry and Kingsley, the conceptual art of the Residents, even the post-rock repetition of Black Dice. Most of Recordings 1969-1988 sounds simultaneously like pop and art. Bogner's M.O. is to take a few simple loops-- rumbling bass, water-y plops, chirping squalls, laser-like blasts-- and overlap them, producing songs so sweet they'll make you laugh (the elephant-march opener ""Begleitung für Tuba""), so repetitive they'll hypnotize you (the swinging ""Inversion""), and so inventive they sound alien (the robotic ""2 Ton""). At best, like on the jazzy ""Punkte"" and the cresting ""Expansion"", she crafts pulsing, organic melodies that burrow into memory like tree roots gripping the ground. I've often wondered why the music of Raymond Scott, as catchy as it could be, is frequently relegated to the status of odd curiosity or gear-geek niche. The same will certainly happen with Bogner, whoever she ""really"" was/is. And sure, the songs on Recordings 1969-1988 (as well as the included shot of her with big glasses and floppy bowl cut) have a tech-y, art-nerd sheen. But give these tunes time, and you may find yourself humming them randomly, much the way a 60s housewife might have unwittingly memorized Scott tunes via the background noise of his sneaky radio jingles.","The first release on experimental electronic producer Jan Jelinek's label Faitiche, the homemade recordings of the late Ursula Bogner might never have been heard outside her immediate family had Jelinek not discovered them, or recorded them and conceived the entire backstory himself, depending on who you ask.

Founded around the turn of the century by Lawrence English, the label has become the prolific home of many of Australia's best ambient and electronic musicians, as well as a rest stop for guys like Keith Fullerton Whitman, Philip Jeck, Oren Ambarchi, David Toop, Thurston Moore and Luc Ferrari. Japanese singer and experimentalist Tujiko Noriko's here makes her second appearance on the label. Noriko's 2005 effort for Room40, Blurred in My Mirror, had a beguiling and murky atmosphere but nonetheless offered moments of stunning pop clarity-- this collaboration leans much more heavily to abstraction and the pure celebration of sound. John Chantler, whose association with Room40 goes back to its beginnings, and label founder Lawrence English play a variety of rock instruments in a decidedly un-rock way, but they focus mostly on their synthesizers, while Noriko layers her voice to build on their soundscapes. She seems to revel in the juxtaposition of different types of singing. On ""Make Me Your Private Party"", she very cleary carries the central melody in sharp, child-like ""la la las,"" surrounding them with slightly processed vocal parts that feel somewhat sinister. The effect rolls between fantasy and nightmare. English has curated compilations that focus on illustrating the sleep state, and he and Chantler seem keen to explore that territory here, creating a series of musical backdrops that often sound like half-remembered songs or mirror the way external stimuli can wiggle into our dreams. ""12 O'clock on the Highway"" opens things strongly, with a nebula of Noriko voices softly meandering in and out of harmony, before the song shifts into an abstract psych groove. Much of the album expertly bridges obtuse style and pleasing sound, though it closes meekly with a wandering track comprised mostly of accordion, Noriko's quietest mumblings and crackling samples of voices. Whatever its fleeting shortcomings, though, this is an album of singular vision, and one that's bound to appeal to admirers of all three artists. It's perhaps a bit more outré than many of Noriko's solo ventures, but it still fits well within her body of work, especially when her previous Room40 records are considered.","Japanese singer and experimentalist releases her second album for the Australian Room40 label, collaborating with its founder English and associate Chantler, who help her expertly bridge obtuse style and a pleasing sound.

Hungry Bird,Clem Snide,by: Paul Thompson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28eea9e61561daa4a8c/1:1/w_160/69714b8f.jpg,2009-02-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12705-hungry-bird/,429,"A breakup may not be the time to pull out that ""it's not me, it's you"" chestnut, but it also might be your last chance to leave 'em with something to remember. Such is the balancing act at play on Hungry Bird, veteran countrypolitan rockers Clem Snide's bow-out that wasn't. A few years back, after a decade and a half as Clem Snide, songwriter Eef Barzelay announced the end of the Clems, while his own solo output (never far from the Clem Snide aesthetic anyhow, given Barzelay's strong presence and Clem Snide's oft-changing lineup) multiplied. A final album of Snide songs, recorded around the time of Barzelay's 2008 sophomore solo effort, Lose Big, had reportedly been laid down around the same time; now it surfaces as Hungry Bird. One twist: In December, Barzelay announced that Clem Snide had patched things up and are giving this band thing another go. There is a resigned quality to Hungry Bird that stands in sharp contrast with the sprightly, slightly goofy tack the band took on 2001's career highlight The Ghost of Fashion. Gone, too, is most of the twang that characterized a good chunk of the band's sound, replaced with a series of spare, watery soundscapes that threaten to spin out into either a Pablo Honey-style fiery crash or, erm, ""adult contemporary."" This record does indeed sound wounded, and Barzelay's songs feel as if they might be his last set for a while, no matter whose name wound up on the spine. (A little digging suggests Hungry Bird details some sort of post-apocalyptic vision. I didn't get that on my own, nor I suspect will you; awfully dull-seeming end times, anyhow.) But ""wounded"" isn't the best look for a sometimes-humorous band who found early fame warming up collegial sorts at Ben Folds solo shows. A decade ago, Barzelay might've turned one of the ultra-earnest brooders here into a ""Joan Jett of Arc"", slipping just a hint of light and pathos into an otherwise stone-faced ballad. There's just not much levity at play on Hungry Bird, and-- as occasionally overdone as it is throughout the Clem Snide back catalog-- it's funny just how much you miss it when it goes away. ""Me No"" kicks things off with a slack-strummed guitar and splattering drums, but the song itself-- a series of pleas, however impassioned-- falls apart in a series of ""bah-bah-bah""s. Highlight ""Born a Man"" has a nice, easy way about it and some of the set's best lyrics, but it's bogged down by a Bruce Hornsby-like piano and an all-too-easy lyrical climax. It goes on like this, bouncing between mood pieces and more standard folky fare, with Barzelay doing precious little to invoke either the ""see what I did there?"" lyricism of old or revealing much about whatever's so clearly bothering him. Lambchop associate and Nashville producer of note Mark Nevers surprisingly had a hand in this one (as he did on 2005's End of Love), though the production's credited to Barzelay himself. The sound of Hungry Bird shares more than a studio rat (and a bunch of musicians) with Kurt Wagner's ever-changing crew, but whereas Lambchop find a way to make 300 people sound like just the right number, the six musicians who comprise the Clem Snide of Hungry Bird sound as if someone's halved their efforts. A few End of Love songs share this sparse approach with Hungry Bird, but that's just it: a few. I get that these songs are meant to sound ""intense,"" what with all the strategic volume bumps and Barzelay opening up his throat as minute four turns to minute five. But virtually all 10 tunes here share the same threadbare twilit veneer, and it causes the album to feel far longer than its 46 minutes. It doesn't take long for the best of Hungry Bird's vocal melodies-- ""Burn the Light"", ""Born a Man"", ""Hum""-- to become familiar, even though the same can't be said for the lyrics themselves. That's an admittedly odd bit of encouragement for a band like Clem Snide, who once got by on so much more. Alt-country is all too often such serious business, so it was nice to have a band around who might elicit at least a simper now and again. It takes no stretch of the imagination to tie the dour tone of Hungry Bird to the apparent split in the wake of its creation, and maybe its unpleasant bitterness is just a temporary side-effect of Barzelay's heartburn. Whatever it was, though, it wouldn't have been the first breakup in history due to a lack of interest, and that's ultimately the impression left by Hungry Bird.","Originally slated as the final album from Eef Barzelay's Clem Snide, which may or may not be defunct, Hungry Bird substitutes the band's erstwhile lighthearted alt-country with more sober, standard folk fare.

The Century of Self,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28ab1335d7bf16984f7/1:1/w_160/46721209.jpg,2009-02-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12703-the-century-of-self/,Richter Scale,"So, here we have a record from a group that's recently relocated to Brooklyn and uses pre-release interviews as a way to send mash notes to the likes of Dirty Projectors and Yeasayer, bands they bear no sonic similarity to at all. Yeah, big deal-- we could be talking about any number of new jacks with a competent PR team. But this is ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead-- fiercely Austinite and not the kind of people you'd call ""joiners."" If you're checking in for the first time since 2002, Trail of Dead followed up the monumental Source Tags & Codes with a spending spree of goodwill, beefing with label execs, hectoring reviewers, and having their live shows punctuated with intraband violence. And yes, they made albums, too. While I won't tell how high the perversely enjoyable, self-immolating clusterfuck of Worlds Apart ranked on my 2005 year-end list, I can assure you my enthusiasm for it placed me in the minority. On its follow-up, So Divided, Trail of Dead didn't even bother trying to be provocative. It would've been the sound of a band bottoming out if they hadn't gone on to open for Dethklok in one of the most emasculating turnarounds in rock history. Having departed Interscope, and now far enough under the radar to avoid the BS of backlash for backlash's sake, Trail of Dead are in their best position in years to resuscitate their image. What stands out on The Century of Self is a sense of confidence in what Trail of Dead have become-- though they're still sorting out their big-top ambitions a bit too prog for radio airplay (but not too prog to necessarily discourage it), gone are the overbearing orchestrations and baffling genre experiments that often served as cloaking devices for either weak songs or a dearth of ideas. It's easy to overstate the ambition thing-- much of this LP approaches the six-minute mark with discernible ""movements"" and the overreaching religious tirade is given a name like ""Isis Unveiled""-- but the architecture is easy to navigate. ""Bells of Creation"", for example: First featured on last year's Festival Thyme EP, the song throws in a Who-style midsection of anticipatory drum rolls and key trills but it merely serves as a welcome jolt between the piano drone of the verses. The use of piano, certainly increased, isn't the story or the scapegoat it could be made out to be. Trail leader Conrad Keely's always had a taste for sap, and here he often embraces softer, streamlined arrangements: ""Fields of Coal"" moves from a feathery waltz-time appropriation of Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs to a stein-raising sea shanty, and it ushers in a surprisingly potent run of ballads. It shouldn't work-- Trail of Dead have rarely been at their best when it leads with Keely's voice. But while he strains and slides against the slicker numbers, his voice displays a nice worn-in quality. One of the better songs they've written, ""Luna Park"" evolves from a Screamadelica comedown to the most naturally epic crescendos of Century with a directness often missing from the rest of the album. But even when the music takes a lighter touch, Trail of Dead can't quite resist heavy-handedness. *Century'*s second half is bookended by ""Insatiable (One)"" and ""Insatiable (Two)"", a couple of ""Scarborough Fair"" non-starters that are still too close in sequencing to really generate any sort of thematic quality. So in a way, The Century of Self turns out to be every bit as stubborn as its predecessors, even as it goes a certain way towards justifying them. The naysaying didn't suggest a path towards redemption using a sort of Coldplay/Secret Machines hybrid, yet you'll recall that both of those bands made decent records as recently as 2008, and really, this is the sort of company that Trail of Dead should feel most comfortable around: Keely's now 36, and I'm fairly certain he can't afford to smash a piano every night.",,6.8,
How Will You?,Azita,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a281ea9e61561daa4a6e/1:1/w_160/49f59727.jpg,2009-02-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12700-how-will-you/,Drag City,"As a Steely Dan fan, I found the past two Drag City albums by Chicago singer-songwriter Azita intriguing. Startling, too-- at least considering her background in the Fall-meets-Melt-Banana noise-punk group Scissor Girls and the no-wavey Bride of No No, who were about as far from the pristine smoothness of Aja as you could get. Unlikely as the source may have been, 2003's ballad-wracked Enantiodromia and the following year's marginally poppier Life on the Fly (which actually went so far as to mimic the cover-art aesthetic of Countdown to Ecstasy) were likeably skewed mutations of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen's sardonic, piano-driven jazz-rock, right down to Azita's outsized caricature of the latter's hiccupy vocal tendencies. But Azita Youseffi seems to have gotten most of the ""Doctor Wu"" out of her system for How Will You?, a more traditional (if subtly unnerving) take on cabaret-pop. It's harder to pinpoint a singular aesthetic here-- she's expanded the range of her voice, settling into a more comfortable and subtle series of melodies that still retains some of her unique character, and she's branched out into a broader array of musical styles that give her more room to stretch out her compositional artfulness. Ideally, this expanded palette would sound like a breakthrough for an artist once constrained by a more specific frame of reference, yet still retain fans who enjoy piano lounge music transformed into brooding strangeness. The problem is that, musically, it's a bit too polite: the jazz-rock influence is still evident on ""Things Gone Wrong"", but it sounds a little mannered, more in the vein of Ben Folds Five's arch faux-cheeriness than the moody melancholy of her last two albums. ""Scylla and Charybdis"" boasts the most startling vocal performance on the record-- an aching, keening wail that evokes Debbie Harry undergoing a complete nervous breakdown-- but that vocal has to carry the entire song, since it's backed by a listlessly strummed acoustic guitar that might as well be an afterthought. And even with only nine songs on the album, she goes to the well more than once on one idea: The early 1970s post-Beatles mode of ""I'm Happy""-- think Badfinger in their more downtempo moments-- is a compelling-enough opener, but then it's practically reprised, with only a couple of chord changes and some additional atmospherics, two tracks later on ""Away"". The compelling moments are there if you're patient. ""Come William"" is a wintry, slow-build piece that pits a brisk, intense piano against an otherwise-elegaic arrangement, and the gradual shift in ""Laughter Again"" from lonely-sounding early Joni Mitchell balladry to vigorous alt-country-tinged guitar rock should make Neko Case fans happy. But most of the appeal to this album will be in Azita's voice and lyrics, which are accessibly versatile and somewhat impenetrable, respectively. It's saying a lot that she can make some of this stuff work; lines like ""Hey you with the lightning eyes and the starry fate"" (""Things Gone Wrong"") and ""Bonafide when the summer calls the tune/ In pale alabaster"" (""Laughter Again"") read a bit like bogus poetry without her alluringly sharp/sweet voice to back it up, and it's easy to drift away from listening to what she's singing in favor of the way she sings it. If this album evokes anything, lyrically or otherwise, it's the feelings that arise when love and ambivalence cross paths, maybe best personified in the last line of ""Come William"": ""I don't want to mean or believe or seem anything/ Only want to carry along."" Maybe that's why so much of How Will You? sounds only halfway captivating.","On her third Drag City solo album, Azita scraps most of her Steely Dan-like tendencies for a more traditional (if subtly unnerving) take on cabaret-pop.

Feel. Love. Thinking. Of.,Faunts,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2829d034d5c69bf2bf8/1:1/w_160/caee9207.jpg,2009-02-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12701-feel-love-thinking-of/,Friendly Fire,"There are many dubious reasons for a band to release a remix album, whether it's to kill a contract or kill time. But when Edmonton quintet Faunts released theirs (the imaginatively titled Faunts Remixed) late last year, it was a logical continuation of a process that began with 2006's M4EP, which saw the band's hazy sprawl refashioned into extended electronic-based workouts. Now, Faunts' second full-length, Feel. Love. Thinking. Of., provides greater evidence that the remix project helped not simply to reconstuct the band's back catalogue, but the group itself: slow-motion shoegazers reborn as purveyors of luminous and deeply affecting electronic pop. There is, of course, precedent for this sort of evolution-- most notably, Joy Division's transition into New Order. But beyond a surface stylistic debt, Faunts share with their Manchester forbears the ability to vividly reflect their surrounding urban environment in their music. If you've never spent a winter in Edmonton-- a sizeable but geographically remote city in central Alberta-- Feel. Love. Thinking. Of. reconstructs the sensation well, with an austere presentation that effectively puts the ""ice"" in isolation, but infused with beautifully melancholic melodies that beg for the thaw. Part and parcel of this transfromation is the promotion of the voice from obscured, textural detail to emotional focal point, with Faunts' trio of singers-- brothers Steven and Tim Batke, and Paul Amusch-- stepping up to join Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan and the Notwist's Markus Acher in the pantheon of sad-robot balladeers. And like those bands, Faunts' production intricacy is nicely complemented by their emotional simplicity: While the pulse-quickening opening title track approximates the rush of a burgeoning romance, second song ""Input"" has already fast-forwarded to relationship's end, the emotional stagnation and disconnect echoed by a skittering beat that struggles to cohere into a groove. But rather than play on typical human-vs-synthetic dynamics, Faunts score their most moving performances when their singers are at their most numb, and must rely on technology to fill in the blanks: the effects-pedal fireworks that close out the haunting ""Lights Are Always On"", or the quivering, pitch-shifted synth line that essentially serves as the wordless chorus for Amusch's ""It Hurts Me All the Time""-- a track that, for all the contemporary bands dancing on Joy Division's grave, is one of the few to capture the glacial beauty of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart."" For an album mostly preoccupied with cataloguing past relationships and the mistakes that did them in, it follows that Feel. Love. Thinking. Of. would manifest those feelings with nostalgic sounds, some welcome (""Das Malfitz"", which reimagines Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in The Wall, Pt. 1"" as a vintage Detroit-techno track),  others less so (the too-slick guitar riff underpinning ""I Think I'll Start a Fire"" that sounds like an attempt to further last fall's unwanted Fixx resurgence). And if the album's more languorous second side serves up too much wallow and not enough wallop, it could just be a strategy to make closer ""Explain"" feel all the more euphoric: with a fade-in a la New Order's ""Temptation"", the song springs forth on a sunset-bound motorik beat and waves of rippling guitar riffs that carry with them the promise to leave all those doomed romances, regrets, and miserable winters behind. This year in Edmonton, spring comes early.","On their second album, these former slow-motion shoegazers are reborn as purveyors of luminous and deeply affecting electronic pop.

The Mountain,Heartless Bastards,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27d9d034d5c69bf2bed/1:1/w_160/aa5f806c.jpg,2009-02-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12697-the-mountain/,Fat Possum,"Since 2005, Heartless Bastards have been writing traditional blues-rock that they record in a simple and more or less lo-fi manner, which means they bleed authenticity from both ends. So the cleaner and more carefully arranged sound of their latest album, The Mountain, is a new step for them. From the opening title track, it sounds like a confident one. A muffled guitar introduces the simple minor-key progression, but then the whole band kicks in, stretching the sound from pan-and-scan to widescreen, while a soaring electric slide guitar adds to the song's understated majesty. Producer Mike McCarthy has done a fine job of making the band sound clean without being antiseptic, but the focus is very much on the dirty guitars and the voice of frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom. Her voice is distinctive, powerful, and exudes an easy lived-in authority; it's the kind of voice any band playing this kind of straightforward rock would die to have fronting them. Heartless Bastards seem like their trying to grow and diversify without losing sight of themselves or their sound-- a tricky undertaking since they've made it thus far on bare-bones rock. But even with the added touches, The Mountain still a pretty austere affair. The most ostentatious moments are the record's softer ones. ""Wide Awake"" is one example, with its reserved strum augmented by mandolins, a martial drumbeat, and Wennerstrom singing an ambitious, vaguely Eastern-sounding vocal melody (Led Zeppelin III seems seems like the band's North star on how to add depth). ""Early in the Morning"" and ""Out at Sea"" are more typical plugged-in mid-tempo stompers, the latter having a few overdubs and incidental noise that slyly suggest a psychedelic touch. ""Nothing Seems the Same"" is that song's simmering cousin, gradually building and receding without ever bursting through, with some of the same production touches. If anything drags The Mountain down, it's tempo. The title track is immediately deflated by the acoustic campfire strum of the following ""Could Be So Happy"", though the simple ascending chorus promises that it'll linger in listeners' minds once it's over. . ""Hold Your Head High"", however, is maudlin world-weary, little-help-from-my-friends tripe that even Wennerstrom's voice, hammering every brassy high note within reach, can't save. ""So Quiet"" is another folky detour, with a string chart that screams starched collars in comparison to the band's blue ones, and they follow that right up with ""Had to Go"", more acoustic fun with added banjo and fiddle. Compared with the record's earlier slow songs, ""Had to Go""'s languid tempo seems purposeful and patient, with Wennerstrom in total control of the melody-- but most arresting is the open space that they've allowed into the song. The last two songs signal a return to volume and normalcy, but while closing track ""Sway"" is a perky step sideways from the record's somber tone, ""Witchypoo"" is not nearly sublime enough to sustain its sluggish pace. With The Mountain, Heartless Bastards have shown that they have the tools and the talent to take at least tentative steps forward into a more ambitious and diverse sound. But it's surprising that they sound so introspective here when they could, and occasionally do, sound world-beating.","With Spoon producer Mike McCarthy behind the boards, this blues-rock band from Dayton, Ohio, aims for a slightly cleaner sound to accompany songs that are a touch more introspective.

The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience,Peter Tosh,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27bb1335d7bf16984e7/1:1/w_160/d98668de.jpeg,2009-02-23 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12695-the-ultimate-peter-tosh-experience/,Schanachie,"""If I wasn't a singer,"" Peter Tosh once said, ""I'd be a bloodclaat revolutionary."" Funny he didn't think he could be both, because that's basically what he was: six-foot-three, stiff-lipped, carrying a guitar shaped like an M16 (a gift from a fan), cursing every 10 seconds, serially high, and considered such an effective agitator by cops that they beat him half to death in mid-1978. ""I survived them by intellect,"" he said later. Yuh. Tosh may have been a natural mystic, but I'm sure pot helped. His reggae career started alongside Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston in the Wailers, a group he left in the mid-70s after Island Records' Chris Blackwell refused to release his first solo album. No surprise, really-- compared to Marley, Tosh was nearly unmarketable. On love songs: ""You turn on the fuckin' radio, 24 bumboclaat hours a day you hear, 'Darlin I love you.' A man wouldn't sing to the almighty a rasclaat, him love a woman more than the creator who create the sun and the moon and the bumboclaat star."" On the enlightenment of the common man: ""I am going to kill the fuckery out there. People is going to be in demand for the truth."" If ""One Love"" was Bob Marley's song about paradise, ""Equal Rights"" was Tosh's: ""Everyone is crying out for peace, none is crying out for justice,"" a reminder that nobody argues against feelgood platitudes, but nobody works to make them come true, either. But one season's rebel is the next's vogue, and by 1978, Tosh was guesting on ""Saturday Night Live"" flanked by Mick Jagger dancing like an electrocuted game hen. In 1987, two years after the first digital dancehall single (King Jammy & Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"") radicalized Jamaican music, Tosh won a Grammy for No Nuclear War, a lukewarm hash of roots reggae-- the kind of muck longtime contributors to their fields finally win Grammys for regardless of quality. Months later, he was murdered in a botched robbery. For the volume and intensity of Tosh's anger, he had a poetic side, animated by magic and religion-- factors more obscure than politics, though equally as susceptible to bullshit. Stepping Razor: Red X-- a documentary packaged in The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience-- is based on a series of cassettes called the Red X Tapes, part biography, part philosophy, part folktale. Much of it is babble, but it's artful, seductive babble. This is the part of Tosh that sounds unreliable on record, but compelling in the form of a documentary, where anonymous commentators rally to elevate him to the level of myth. Even though the documentary isn't part of Tosh's output as a recording artist per se, it helps highlight what made him interesting: The conflict between art as a tool to disseminate truth to the masses, and as a way to mystify it as private ritual. Now to the product at hand. The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience is a $35 package containing one 14-track audio disc and two DVDs: Stepping Razor: Red X (which is already commercially available) and footage of several performances. It's not what it claims to be. His most famous songs-- ""Legalize It"", ""Equal Rights"", and ""Stepping Razor""-- are either absent or represented by alternate versions. There's nothing from his first album, Legalize It, and there are two versions of ""Wanted: Dread and Alive"". Why? I'm guessing it has to do with licensing. Shame on Shanachie Records, frankly. Tosh's biography was always more interesting to me than his music, but he certainly wrote some good songs, played with great sidemen, and released some brawny, tuff reggae-- all reasons he deserves a lovingly selected single-disc compilation behind his name. In fact, he has one already. Several. There's a part of the Red X Tapes where he talks about a time the devil wrapped him in barbed wire, which sliced peepholes in his eyelids that let him see the world's hypocrisy and corruption. I wonder what he'd see in this.","With two DVDs alongside an oddly selected 14-track audio disc, The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience isn't exactly what is claims to be.*

200 Million Thousand,Black Lips,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2839d034d5c69bf2bfc/1:1/w_160/5c1858ab.jpg,2009-02-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12702-200-million-thousand/,Vice,"Whatever you like to call the Black Lips' particular branch of guitar rock-- garage, revival, their own ""flower punk"" tag-- it's an easier sell whenever the band in question is painted the fastest, craziest, or most depraved in the land. But it's long past time we put the band's reputation and ridiculous press aside and look at them for who they are; they're neither buffoons nor savants, and they deserve to be judged on their music, which was plenty maniacal without taking any outside factors into consideration. Now on the verge of a potential breakthrough-- maybe because of it, who knows-- on 200 Million Thousand, Black Lips sidestep expectations and make a record less approachable than its predecessor. Indeed, the cleaner sound and summery pop of Good Bad Not Evil has been ditched here for a psychedelic haze. From opening track ""Take My Heart"" onward, vocals are more obscured by echo, guitars play queasy, atonal leads, and the rhythm section pokes and ambles around the beat. Some tracks are subtly weird-- like the simmering breakdown of ""Drugs"", where the band's voices get not so much quieter as they do smaller-- and there's more full-on psychedelia on""Big Black Baby Jesus of Today"", a Southern swamp shuffle drenched in toothache-inducing guitar bends and unhinged vocals. Closer ""I Saw God"" takes an already near-inscrutable ode to a minor drug epiphany and manipulates it with tape-masking and censoring ""bleep"" noises, before its full-band climax goes off less like a tidal wave of sound and more like someone falling over a drum riser. If there's beauty in imperfections, some of these songs are shrines. No one's going to mistake this record for anyone but Black Lips, but they are stretching out as band here, pulling back their own tics in favor of things like style and tone. Vocal duties are spread more democratically among the band, and more styles are dabbled with, though they haven't moved the needle too far on the college radio dial. There's faux-innocent greaser-pop like ""Drugs"", some Byrdsian jangle added to the sobriety pledge of ""Starting Over"" (""while I'm still lucid... my wounds won't stop oozing""), and ""Trapped in a Basement"", a weirdly theatrical number that combines country twang with woozy keyboard tones.  But before you say there are no surprises on the record, there's also a rap song: ""The Drop I Hold"" is a definite departure, though maybe not one as drastic as it first seems. The scratchy orchestral loop underneath that would be more appropriate for an early Wu-tang record, but Cole Alexander rap-sings its lyrics, sings its hook, wails like a ghost in the background in the same way they hit the high notes in ""Trapped in a Basement"", and even imitates a turntable scratch with childlike exuberance. It's as if he's singing along to a favorite song that existed already. You could say the same about many of this band's best songs, and that's no criticism. They're obvious about their influences, but thankfully never fussy or precious about them. The results still hold something palpably reckless and earnest, refracting tradition through their own filthy lens. Black Lips haven't lost their lack for songcraft-- ""Short Fuse"" is so sleekly and effortlessly catchy that any disparate sound they graft onto it (paisley 60s pop, hammy piano hammering, an ancient B-movie whoosh) sticks by force of inertia. But whether or not Black Lips have changed their M.O. much, 200 Million Thousand is less consistent than any of their previous albums, with more winding paths than real peaks.",,7.3,
Wrecking Ball,Dead Confederate,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26813d1975652138876/1:1/w_160/75d36f66.jpg,2009-02-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12675-wrecking-ball/,Razor & Tie,"Like anybody else in the early stages of dreaming up a rock'n'roll band, Dead Confederate could have come up with any number of less evocative monikers. Instead, the Georgia five-piece receives perfect marks for settling on a name that reads exactly like what it implies: the first in what is sure to be a wave of new, poker-hot bands that puree alt-country tropes together with the muddy crash of grunge-- specifically in the unmistakable, steamrolling style of a one Kurt Donald Cobain. They are a band out of time, not place. Snatched up last year by the same Gary Gersh that signed Sonic Youth and Nirvana to Geffen Records in the early 1990s, the Atlanta-via-Augusta (via-Aberdeen, har) quintet's riff formulas are throwbacks on many a level. Recorded in the Austin studio wherein The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's grisly sound effects were captured, the fusion wears its stitching well. Much of the arranged marriage between grunge and Southern-rock figures feels spurred on not by any subtle deviation in sonics, but the inescapable way in which frontman Hardy Morris pitches his fits. As soon as the first riffs of opener ""Heavy Petting"" kick tires, Morris looses Cobain-ified moans with a twist: drawl. Sure, there's the seductive blend of country-fried guitar tones and steel-mimicking wails any MMJ or even Band of Horses fan might jump at. But it's the all-too-familiar way Morris lacerates his vocal cords that glues it all together so powerfully. During the minor chord writhing of ""Start Me Laughing"", Morris' cribbing of Cobain comes dangerously close to tracing the bloody coughing of Bleach's ""School"". And if you recall that classic CD's closing track (er, ""Downer""), you should have a pretty good idea as to the origins of Dead Confederate's lyrical aims. The songs, penned primarily by Morris, have a darkness to match the tar-black, wind-through-dead trees arrangements. In the drag of ""Goner"", one of Wrecking Ball's shortest (and most direct) cuts, Morris returns time and again to a chorus that colors all sides of the record: ""I could be gone, you would never know."" Short and not so sweet, but that's just fine. Album centerpiece, single, and religious right invective ""The Rat"", finds all of these elements in a perfectly formed storm of tears and suds. And while ""All The Angels"" briefly lets a bit of light peek through, it shuts it out just as quickly. When one slaps loner angst like this on top of coiled chord progressions, the result can't feel like anything but a drawn-out gutting. Ultimately, Wrecking Ball's successes holler at the kind of new genre hybridization that's become all the more welcome as early 90s alt-rock anthems take their seats in the classic rock pantheon. But the quiet-loud-quiet-loud dynamics and turgid crunch taste and feel just like middle school. And even if that weren't the case, it's safe to say we've heard aches like just these before. That was then, and this isn't a good kind of hurt.","Georgia band purees alt-country tropes together with the muddy crash of grunge on their debut full-length.

I Don't Know Where I'm Going But I'm on My Way,Murry Hammond,by: Stephen M.

Locomotives have inspired scores of country and western songs from ""Waiting for a Train"" to ""Let the Train Blow the Whistle"", which have made them metaphors for loneliness, wanderlust, death, freedom, imprisonment, and so on and so forth. Possibly only zombies have more allegorical potential. Hammond's day-job band, the Old 97s, is named after a train song (""Wreck of the Old 97""), and his first album as a solo artist, I Don't Know Where I'm Going But I'm on My Way, is a collection of originals and mostly covers that employ trains as vehicles for a spiritual journey, casting life's tribulations (Hammond's: the death of his father, the hard times in the Old 97s) as treacherous mountain passes and arduous treks along miles of tracks until it reaches a heavenly destination. It can be heavy listening, but Hammond's ear for odd, droning soundscapes, his fondness for shuffling brushed-snare beats, and his liberal take on old songs lend it a sense of real discovery. This is an album steeped in history, but not beholden to it. Hammond takes liberties with these tunes, showing himself to be a curious sonic tinkerer. In retrospect, he seems an underutilized presence in the Old 97s, where he is overshadowed by frontman Rhett Miller. But I Don't Know Where I'm Going sounds more musically adventurous than anything that band has ever done, despite Hammond's reliance on traditional tunes. The album opens with Texas jackleg preacher George Washington Phillips' ""What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?"", which Hammond turns into a Jimmie Rodgers-style yodel. The Carter Family's ""I Never Will Marry"" descends from Appalachia for a high lonesome sound that's as flat as a Texas plain, and Hammond draws three train songs (""Life Is Like a Mountain Railroad"", ""You Will Often Meet Obstruction"", ""As You Roll Across the Trestle"") from a work by renowned Mormon poet Eliza R. Snow. But his greatest risk may be the ""Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down"" triptych, which begins as an instrumental performed on a homemade kit banjo, transforms into a strange reading of scripture (man's prayer in one ear, God's answer in the other), and ends as a stalwart reading of the hymn. Covers dominate the album, nodding to country-music and railroad history, but Hammond includes a few originals that stand up alongside his best work with the 97s (namely, ""Valentine"" and ""Crash on the Barrelhead""). ""Wreck of the 97"" is a pensive account of tough times in that band, with Hammond's vocal phrasing rushing the song forward at a pace just shy of reckless. I Don't Know Where I'm Going closes with two of his best compositions: ""Other, Younger Days"" places a major-key acoustic guitar over a droning harmonium (recalling his track on the Teach Me to Sing compilation) to create a sense of wide-open space, with Hammond's vocals drenched in reverb, and on the spare ""I Believe, I Believe"" his high, keening yodel-- so searching earlier in the album-- sounds contented and fulfilled, as if he has finally reached the end of the line.","The Old 97s bass player releases his solo debut, a collection of originals and mostly covers that employ trains as vehicles for a spiritual journey and that sounds more musically adventurous than anything his band has done.

Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl,Van Morrison,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a276c0084474cd0c0051/1:1/w_160/18fd00dc.jpg,2009-02-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12688-astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl/,Manhattan,"I loved the idea of Astral Weeks before I loved Astral Weeks. I'm sure I'm not alone. Irishman who sang proto-punk ""Gloria"" and drunken dorm-formal singalong ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and went on to do Moondance goes into a midtown Manhattan studio with top-notch jazz sessionmen. Pours out stream-of-consciousness stuff about love, rebirth, and a pain that passes all understanding, in an impressionistic folk-jazz-blues idiom that transcends existing rock conventions. Nobody buys it. A decade later, Lester Bangs calls Astral Weeks ""a mystical document."" In 1995, MOJO ranks it the #2 album of all time; eight years later, Rolling Stone ranks it #19; in between, damn thing finally goes gold. To a hopeless romantic, what's not to love? Only Astral Weeks the album could live up to Astral Weeks the legend. A 23-year-old Van Morrison howls, he hollers, he cajoles, he grabs hold of the ineffable and caresses its edges, bending and reiterating it like an instrumental virtuoso. Guitarist Jay Berliner (Charles Mingus' The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady), bassist Richard Davis (Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch), and drummer Connie Kay (of the Modern Jazz Quartet) create an improvisatory space for Morrison's haunted freeform meditations; Larry Fallon's overdubs add strings, woodwinds, and harpsichord. You breathe in you breathe out, baby baby baby, way upon way upon, dry your eye your eye your eye, too late to stop now, the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves, I know you're dying. The legend is with the album, and the legend is the album. Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl was a pair of concerts held last year at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, honoring the legendary album (scheduled to be reprised February 27 and 28 at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden). Now Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl is also an album honoring the shows that honored that legendary album. Sadly, one thing that this record isn't: legendary. Astral Weeks was released 40 years, almost to the day, before Van Morrison performed the whole thing live two straight nights last November. ""We did the songs and took them somewhere else. Transcended the originals, if you know what I mean."" That's Morrison talking to the Associated Press recently. The shows featured guitarist Berliner from the 1968 sessions, along with other previous Morrison collaborators and a full string section; they were generally well-reviewed. As recorded on Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the performances retain the improvisatory approach from the record, right down to changing the song order-- the all-loving, possibly transvestite-themed, vaguely pro-civil-rights hymn ""Madame George"" now closes, rather than atmospheric mortality rumination ""Slim Slow Slider"". There's much rejoicing. I guess you had to be there. On disc, Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl is a bland, bluesy celebration you can afford to miss. Oh, it still consists mostly of great songs-- the two ""bonus"" tracks slightly less so-- performed with skill, and recorded at fine quality, but it's hard to imagine why anyone other than souvenir-seekers or live-music absolutists would need to listen to this more than once as long as the original LP remains in print. An album brave enough to embrace life in all its ugliness and anguish, right on through to its inevitable end, becomes just another document of the rock'n'roll generation's stubborn confidence it will outlive itself. Sort of like those Dick Clark teeth on the cover. ""I believe I've transcended,"" Morrison sings on an extended outro to the opening, title track. ""Slim Slow Slider"" is now jammy, incongruously upbeat, fixed in time and place by the live audience-- some guy loudly cheers the song's placement after a newly percussion-crowded ""Beside You"". An ignoble thunk disrupts the harpsichord in the left speaker near the start of ""Cyprus Avenue"", which now inexplicably follows swinger ""The Way Young Lovers Do""-- and lacks the dramatic, showstopping interlude described by Bangs, documented on 1974's It's Too Late to Stop Now live LP. Morrison's voice here is heavier, still distinguished, but as he slurs his way through the ordinarily sublime verses of ""Sweet Thing"" before breaking off for a superfluous harmonica solo, this much is clear: A work of art can withstand the ages. People never do. A high point is ""Ballerina"", the possibly prostitute-themed song where Morrison's voice sounds richer and fuller; his growled ""get on up!"" evokes both James Brown and Morrison's own Brown-esque ""good God!"" barks back in his youth. ""Madame George"" ends with Morrison's communal invocation to ""get on the train""-- well, actually, it ends with some hokey guy shouting Van Morrison's name over and over into a microphone. Still, better than the drippy bonus track version of ""Listen to the Lion"", originally from St. Dominic's Preview, where the same dude bellows, ""Vaaaan Morrison! The one! The only!"" as a saxophone hits barge-like brown notes. If it sounds like I'm overstating my complaints, it's only because listening side by side with Astral Weeks can't help but magnify them. You don't need Pet Sounds Live, either. There's a case to be made that Astral Weeks, the album, never quite captured Astral Weeks, the idea. Morrison has complained about producer Lewis Merenstein's chosen running order. Then again, he has also denigrated his accompanists and described Astral Weeks as a ""rock opera"". The repetitions in Morrison's songs carry over to his discography: Prior to Astral Weeks, he recorded other studio versions of ""Madame George"" and ""Beside You"". A 10-minute ""Slim Slow Slider"" was supposedly edited down to 3:18; nothing's set in stone. OK, so maybe what Astral Weeks represents to so many of us can't be perfectly recorded, whether on vinyl or in 1s and 0s-- definitely not in words. But I can feel it in my bones when I listen to the original album (turn it up, so you know it's got soul). When I listen to Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, I just feel lonely, and old.","One of rock's most legendary cult records, Astral Weeks has now inspired a series of concerts and an inevitable live document honoring those shows.

God Loves Ugly,Atmosphere,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26db1335d7bf16984c2/1:1/w_160/dbe8bddb.jpg,2009-02-20 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12680-god-loves-ugly/,RhymesayersRhymesayers,"Sometime in the first half of this decade it became a minor sport in rap nerd circles to get pissed off at Atmosphere's Slug, a sport that Slug more or less acted like the commissioner of. The combination of self-loathing, female troubles, and stress-fueled antagonism in his lyrics could be off-putting to heads whether they liked Mos Def or UGK, and for a while Sean Daley seemed to revel in it, like he knew that the backlash against his growing modest-scale fame was pre-ordained. He responded with a sort of self-effacing rope-a-dope strategy, putting together a portfolio of tracks filled with a conceptual hook of Slug as Dickhead, as though it'd mollify the skeptical listeners who already harbored that suspicion. Of course, he also offset that with an increasing amount of humorous good will and been-there sympathy (something last year's When Life Give You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold thrived on). From the first-track get-go of ""Trying to Find a Balance"", from 2003's Seven's Travels, he really started to master the process of fine-tuning his lyrical persona until he made it, if not always likeable, at least easier to imagine having an empathetic beer with. That makes the re-release of 2002's cusp-of-fame album God Loves Ugly stand out that much more as a grim, almost completely joyless anomaly in Atmosphere's discography. While the melancholy and broken-up bummer-rap Slug became (in)famous for was manifest on 2000's Lucy and Ford One & Two EPs, it didn't dominate nearly as much as it did on this follow-up album. God Loves Ugly is propelled almost completely by a mixture of distrust and anger, which makes it a difficult listen for reasons almost completely unrelated to Slug's talent. It's not that he isn't good at what he does here, or that he doesn't have good beats to accompany him; he is and he does. It's that he's so in tune with a specifically bleak, hostile, and borderline self-destructive character. Add some of the sparest, gloomiest beats Ant's ever put together-- glowering dub on ""Blamegame""; half-gothic stagger-step boom-bap on ""The Bass and the Movement"" and ""Flesh""; post-RZA soul melancholy throughout -- and you'd have to be in a rarified state of misery to actually get the most out of listening to it. Most of what you need to know about the defensive-slash-aggressive tone of the album comes in most tracks' first lines: ""We came here to slit your throat""; ""I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp""; ""She abandoned me, left me out in the cold/ No surprises, I guess that's how it goes"". Hell, the first moments of the album consist of a couple girls chanting ""you're so ugly, you're so ugly"" (to Slug, or the listener?) and Slug snarling the name of his group a couple times before barking ""Atmosphere, and maybe you don't like us."" Atmosphere was still in the process of building their national following and solidifying their craft when God Loves Ugly was being recorded, and whether Slug's sour tone was the direct result of some real-life personal struggles or just their first really ambitious concept record-- or maybe a bit of both-- it set the tone for many of the preconceptions and misconceptions that would follow him throughout his career. The two major targets of Slug's angst on this album are women and himself. If anything offsets whatever potential misogyny might be in that lyrical turf it's the fact that it's not entirely clear who's at fault. ""Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence,"" he shouts in ""F*@K You Lucy"", and it's harder to tell if he's angrier at her for fucking up his love life or himself for obsessing over it. (Maybe he was predicting how many people would start seeing him as ""that dude who always raps about that girl who left him."") He's a bit more glib and casual about his stressed-out love life elsewhere, like the admission on ""Saves the Day"" that ""I sleep next to women that I don't deserve/ They like to hurt my pride while I work their nerves."" And even when he tries to play slick, like he does on  standout single ""Modern Man's Hustle"", he does so in a way that reveals he still can't quite let go and that he wants to make things right again. Shit, maybe it's just god and/or fate that's to blame for fucking everything up anyways: the only people who really seem to hit it off without a hitch on this record are the two partygoers in ""Hair,"" and they die in a fatal car crash in the last line. Aside from that, there's the haters and the doubters and the nameless targets of various dick-based trauma who earn Slug's wrath for being in his way on tracks like ""The Bass and the Movement"" and ""Blamegame"". Those moments feel kind of weird, since time's shown Slug to be more gifted as a smartass than a hardass, and they don't quite ring as true as the times where he focuses more abstracted variations of his frustration on post-9/11 paranoia (""Vampires"") or ruminates on his potential post-death legacy (""Lovelife""). Since this reissue throws in the tour video diary Sad Clown Bad Dub 4-- labeled with the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer ""the camera followed us around… so we smiled a little more than normal""-- it's easier to see where Atmosphere were headed once they got this catharsis out of their system: with that much success in front of you, all that anger doesn't seem so damn serious anymore.",,6.6,
March of the Zapotec / Holland,Beirut/Realpeople,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a277b1335d7bf16984d6/1:1/w_160/c193ff7b.jpg,2009-02-20 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12689-march-of-the-zapotec-holland/,Pompeii,"After the remarkable efforts of Gulag Orkestar and The Flying Club Cup, Zach Condon's offbeat hybridization of traditional Eastern European motifs and Western indie pop reached a glorious pinnacle. But where take things from there? Rather than resting on his laurels, the 23-year-old Santa Fe native packed his bags, hopped on a plane to the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, and began recording a selection of new material with local 19-piece collective the Jimenez Band. Aided by a translator to help communicate their compositional ideas, Condon and his cohorts worked tirelessly on March of the Zapotec, a slew of songs composed in the small weaver village of Teotitlan del Valle during the spring of 2008. Condon's self-confessed Francophile leanings still run strong, particularly in his Jacques Brel-meets-Serge Gainsbourg vocal delivery, and Balkan folk patterns continue to remain at the core of his musical references. Yet his flourishing interest in Mexican wedding and funeral music, highlighted by the animated huffs and puffs of a ""barely rehearsed"" brass band, inevitably takes these recordings somewhere different. March of the Zapotec is the sound of a musician continuing to evolve and, most importantly, allowing himself to be persuaded by his inspirations without losing sight of his own creative personality. Like many young, culture-hungry travelers, Condon seems to be embracing as much as possible, re-shaping his interior musical landscape as he continues to learn the tricks of the trade from masters and street performers in various parts of the world. Just as Mexican funerals are known not only for reflection and mourning but also for the celebration of life, the six songs that comprise March of the Zapotec sound as joyous as they do melancholy. The jolly three-step-waltz of ""La Llorona"" and ""The Shrew"" wouldn't sound out of place on a soundtrack to Emir Kusturica's dark and memorably shambolic wedding scene in the film Black Cat, White Cat. ""The Akara"" is similarly expressive, introduced by a bold but despondent trumpet fanfare that slips into a lively melody as Condon sings through his malaise, ""so long, my fate has changed, it's hindering."" But March of the Zapotec is just one half of this intriguing and disparate 2xEP. The second is very different, and closer in sound to Condon's pre-Beirut bedroom recordings, when he went under the alias Realpeople. Having spent years making electronic music as a teenager before focusing on the elaborate acoustic inventions he is now known for as Beirut, it seems only natural for Condon's older methods to finally see the light of day. Although he has more than proved his mettle as a masterful, highly visionary musician, it will perhaps be a relief to fans of Beirut that Holland does not feel out of place beside the material that initially drew Condon to popular attention. It is after all, an extension of an already strong musical direction or, in his words, ""different aspects of my personality."" These five songs, mostly recorded alone, begin with the lyrically superb ""My Night With the Prostitute From Marseille"" and take more than a few notes from the Magnetic Fields and, perhaps a little surprisingly, Boards of Canada. ""Venice"", with its dreamily atmospheric intro, which gracefully crackles in the background like old letters burning on a fire, is a fine example of Condon's apparent knack for constructing a home-- whether permanent or temporary-- on a wide range of melodic turf. As a concept, this EP could be seen as rather puzzling with its marrying of such stylistically different material. However, listening to the two discs back to back allows insight into the development of Condon's burgeoning ideas. Rather than re-tracing the path that made him popular, he has hacked into the wilderness of his new inspirations, no matter how divergent, and emerged triumphant. As another of his favorite French luminaries, Jean-Luc Godard, once famously said: ""It's not where you take things from, it's where you take them to.""","Zach Condon continues to surprise if not amaze on this intriguing and disparate 2xEP.

Exodus,Alex Moulton,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a271ea9e61561daa4a53/1:1/w_160/b21a16f1.jpeg,2009-02-19 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12684-exodus/,Expansion Team,"In the Web 2.0 era, the successor to the concept album seems to be its user-generated counterpart, the mix CD. But for DJ and music video director Alex Moulton, the two aren't mutually exclusive. As the founder of media production house Expansion Team, Moulton lords over scores of tightly wound marketing storylines for corporate clients like Target and McDonald's. His debut full-length Exodus gives him the freedom to confront those filmic aspects while wearing his DJ hat. With Exodus, Moulton constructs an instrumental science-fiction adventure that, unencumbered by lingual constraints, functions as a narrative mirror, its proggy signifiers pursuing only an obsessive sense of escapism. The single visual that accompanies Exodus, its cover, depicts such a sci-fi scene: A shirtless stud holds a damsel in distress, both suspended in time, frozen in flight from a fiery cityscape. The CD's label is a mockup of printed vinyl grooves. And from the first stabs of Moog arpeggios cutting across ""Overture"", the proverbial laser-stringed harp of Jean-Michel Jarre looms large. Moulton said of Exodus: ""I wanted to make something like a Pink Floyd record, where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey."" The nostalgia that he invokes is clearly the kind that imagined an analogue future. However, Moulton's idea of psychedelia is more Tangerine Dream's Klaus Schulze than Floyd's Roger Waters, embracing the Berlin school knob-twiddler conflict between man and machine rather than any Cambridge or Canterbury absurdity. In the course of Exodus, he bounces between his retro muse and one of its fast-forwarded descendents, filter disco, and the shadows of Daft Punk and Alan Braxe appear out of his gauzy synthesized lines in ""Out of Phase"", ""Meridians"", and ""Paradise"". Just as often, however, his dance beats give way to live drums and even tribal rhythms. Interludes play a central role in Moulton's story, linking nightclubby action scenes, otherworldly jungle chases (""The Sacrifice"") and somber love themes (""Together Again""). Indeed, the mood changes so drastically and so often-- nearly every song-- that it's sometimes hard to feel in tune with his greater conceit. That's one of the reasons why Exodus leaves so many unanswered questions. ""Exodus"" sounds like the climactic battle, and the final two cuts, ""Ad Astra"" (""to the stars"" in Latin) and ""L'Arc en Ciel"" (""the rainbow"" in French) hint at some sort of romantic transcendence, but Moulton leaves the details up to the listener. As its conceptual cousin Interstella 5555 visually depicted, the success of an otherworldly storyline can't mask the awkward realities of his medium. Exodus's 14 tracks and 68 minutes rise and fall like 14 little films, with the larger narrative rising almost exclusively from the songs' shared analog antiquity. Moulton's concept falters when the listener tries to piece these sensory experiences into a linear progression, but Exodus is still a fascinating and problematic listen as a whole. It's the individual works, however, that emerge as the stars of their own little show. In that sense, Moulton has not only met his goal of the simultaneous concept album and DJ mix-- he's exceeded it by light years.","This debut album by filmmaker and media production head Alex Moulton scores an imagined science-fiction adventure with classic Vangelis and French House flourishes.

Davy,Coconut Records,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26bc0084474cd0c003a/1:1/w_160/14c7d1cd.jpg,2009-02-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12677-davy/,Young Baby,"Compared with other Hollywood actors moonlighting as musicians, say, Jared Leto or Juliette Lewis, Jason Schwartzman enjoys a fair amount of indie audience and critical goodwill. And unlike Scarlett Johansson or Zooey Deschanel, it's not in part cuz he's pretty. Nighttiming, Schwartzman's 2007 multi-instrument-playing debut as Coconut Records, didn't meet with rapturous Interpraise, but it wasn't pummeled with virtual fruit, either. Hey, dude's Max Fischer-- he gets a pass. And, unlike most of his thespian peers, Schwartzman has played in bands longer than he's acted in films. Remember the theme to that Fox teen drama everyone used to watch before they watched ""Gossip Girl""? As Schwartzman deadpans on new Coconut Records album Davy, ""I was a drummer in a band that you've heard of""-- or at least, heard. The other reason the guy gets a pass? He doesn't totally suck. Yeah, so it's a shin-high bar. But even pitting Davy against similar small-scale pop projects, it's a credible effort, laying claim to several instantly likeable, catchy songs indebted to the one-off British invasion cuts favored by director pal Wes Anderson, Revolver/Sgt. Pepper's-era Beatles, and the artists who revived those sounds in the 90s, like Weezer, Elliott Smith and Matthew Sweet. At its weakest (second-half tracks ""The Summer"" and ""I Am Young"" tread Olympic-sized pools of water) the tunes are never worse than forgettable. There's little ego-tripping to hate on, either. Schwartzman's face graces the album's cover, but it's etched with spidery white lines like someone's used it as a scratch pad. And while Davy's lyrics are fed by a network of autobiographical arteries, this source material only fortifies the record's moderately angsty life-in-your-twenties concept with concrete, ground-level detail. The aforementioned ""I Was a Drummer"" is probably Schwartzman at his most personal, but album opener ""Microphone"", with its pensive Elliott Smith-style acoustic guitar and piano arrangements and spot-on lyrics like ""I know that you're not coming home/ There's nowhere to park after it gets dark,"" is the one destined to join ""Heartless"", ""For Emma"", and some Flight of the Conchords track on 2009 breakup mixes. ""Saint Jerome""-- the album's best track-- pulses with ""A Day in the Life""'s jaunty rhythms, and despite (or perhaps because of) Schwartzman's limited vocal range, its ""Saint Jerome, I don't never ever want to be alone"" chorus is less agonized lament than laid-back, sun-baked musing. Coconut Records, in fact, never suggests that much is at stake, and Schwartzman doesn't pull any muscles attempting to articulate strong feelings. Songs like ""Courtyard"" and ""Is This Sound Okay?"" are only ever just a little bummed out. Schwartzman neither leverages nor squanders his celebrity capital with this project, seeming content to play a modest guy with a guitar and a handful of hooks.","Actor Jason Schwartzman-- who, to be fair, was making music before he was making movies-- returns with another rewarding small-scale pop project, reminiscent of 60s British Invasion artists and 90s artists like Elliott Smith and Weezer who aped them.

Cinematic Shades (The Slow Songs),Booka Shade,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26cea9e61561daa4a3f/1:1/w_160/c91393bd.jpeg,2009-02-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12679-cinematic-shades-the-slow-songs/,Get Physical,"Every DJ faces the same question once they step into the studio: how, and how far, will their alone-in-a-room sound range beyond their sway-the-crowd sound? Walter Kammermeier and Arno Merziger of Booka Shade, the crown jewel of their Berlin label Get Physical, have built a loyal following from their globe-hopping career as a DJ duo. Fans wondering if the atmosphere and groove could transfer found on Memento, their impressively cohesive electro-house debut, were pleased that it did. Not so in last year's The Sun & the Neon Light, which skipped schizophrenically between uptempo spark and downtempo fizzle. For the most part, the record was greeted with furrowed brows and question marks. This should not have come as a shock. At its core, the expansive sound of Booka Shade is marked by restraint and repose, not trance's rollercoaster crests and troughs. Movements was a show-stopper, but it is hard to deny that, apart from ""In White Rooms"", the album's Apollonian cool doesn't make it easy to work into hot-blooded Dionysian DJ sets. The slower tempos and softer beats didn't stop there. Listeners discovered that the elegant lightness of the first two LPs was also missing in the recent The Sun & the Neon Light, which had a languorous density that brought to mind Cluster, Depeche Mode, and the Orbital of Snivilisation and In Sides. There will always be a gulf between Booka Shade the DJs and Booka Shade the recording artists; as it widens, the gulf is merely being enshrined in their new compilation. ""Outskirts"", the first track from their last record, opens this collection as well. Recast by Trentemoller, the relatively conventional, slow-burning original morphs into a cosmic journey, proceeding at trip-hop speed into space-western territory. It seems to be the perfect entryway into a compilation clumsily dubbed Cinematic Shades (The Slow Songs). All the looped bloops and blips of digital percussion on the Movements version of ""Night Falls"" withdraw, in the Larry Gold reimagining here, to the wings. What's left isn't so much the orchestral maneuvers of Philly International disco baroque, but instead something closer to, believe it or not, a Van Dyke Parks arrangement: layers of violin given to peppy flutter and assertive stabs. These are the strong points. Six tracks are filed as Cinematic Shades edits, over half of which we encountered over the past few years. Obviously we heard the title track of the last album on, you know, the last album, but we also heard, for instance, ""Outskirts (Cinematic Shades Edit)"" there as well, billed simply as ""Outskirts"". So plainly the problem with Cinematic Shades isn't the aesthetic: as far as chillout records go, this one operates a very high level of artistry and sonic detail-- though it isn't unreasonable to bemoan a stylistic slip from Berlin's warehouses toward Washington D.C.'s Eighteenth Street Lounge. Most long for the old Metro Area vibes of Memento's ""Vertigo"" or Movements' ""Night Falls"". The problem is that we have heard these before, not the general sound but specifically these songs, and their resurfacing here will strike fans as unnecessary.","Get Physical stars return with a digital-only compilation of reworked and formerly issued material.

Extra Cheese EP,Ryan Adams,by: Stephen M.

That entry was quickly deleted, signaling either a renewed commitment to songcraft or a realization that he's more qualified to be a singer-songwriter than anything else. So perhaps his impending nuptials are the reason for the more-intense-than-usual weirdness emanating from Camp Adams and for Extra Cheese, an iTunes-only EP featuring six previously released songs and a studio version of an obscure, 10-year-old live track. Ostensibly this collection of babymaking music is a Valentine's Day tie-in, but it might double as a mixtape to the future Mrs. Adams. Or triple as a sort of non-chronological career retrospective-- a greatest-hits package with no actual hits. As such, Extra Cheese is fairly thorough, drawing from nearly every stage of his Universal/Lost Highway career. So there's no Whiskeytown or Heartbreaker, which is a shame, but also no Rock N Roll or 29, which is a relief. Instead, the EP culls from Gold, Demolition, Cold Roses, Easy Tiger, Follow the Lights, and Cardinology-- arguably the highlights of his tenure at the labels. ""Two"" may be the best song here and one of his best songs period, with a strong hook justifying the laidback vibe and Adams' voice mixing nicely with Sheryl Crow's. It actually could have been a hit, or at least the soundtrack for a sappy TV drama (oh wait, it was). ""Answering Bell"", from his would-be breakout Gold, is less impressive. Adams affects his vocals mawkishly, the band pales next to the more inventive Cardinals, and hey, is that Hold Steady tourmate Adam Duritz singing backup? ""Blossom"", which is not about the 1990s sitcom, hails from deep within Adams' short-lived Grateful Dead phase with a steeply ascending hook that shoots for pretty but comes off as gangly. As Extra Cheese proceeds, Adams strips away the instruments until only he, an acoustic guitar, and a harmonica remain. ""Desire"" sounds like it was scribbled on a Waffle House napkin at 2 a.m., then stuffed into his jeans pocket until he discovered it weeks later and hit ""<RECORD>"". It feels lived in and off-the-cuff-- a setting where Adams shines-and after so many full-band tracks, its modesty is refreshing and reassuring. ""Evergreen"" and ""My Love for You Is Real"" both reach for the same intimacy, but like much of Adams' recent material, they sound too slick and deliberate. Finally, there's ""Hey There Mrs. Lonely"", which is only sorta new: The song first appeared on the bootleg Live at Almost Blue in 1999, recorded around the time Whiskeytown disbanded. Even on this studio version, with its double-tracked vocals and intertwining guitars, ""Hey There"" remains spare and melodic, but the young Adams' lyrics overreach: ""I'm the plastic three-inch armies you destroyed,"" he sings. ""I'm the monster underneath your bed you ain't afraid of yet."" What makes ""Hey There Mrs. Lovely"" stand out isn't its newness, but the hints of conflict and lust mixed in among the childhood metaphors. There's no real angst and very little desperation in these songs; instead, a general neediness permeates Extra Cheese, trying to pass itself off as heart-on-sleeve earnestness. But Adams is much more interesting when he's writing and singing about romantic confusion than when he's pledging his desire and devotion, and he gets no points for acknowledging his schmaltziness with that tongue-in-cheek EP title. This drowsy set of songs may represent the mainstream crossover Adams aspires to be, but it gives little clue to the complex artist he actually is.",,4.1,
Incredibad,The Lonely Island,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2789d034d5c69bf2be1/1:1/w_160/608c49e8.jpg,2009-02-19 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12690-incredibad/,Interscope,"The best comedy is inherently nerdy, and the best music is (usually) pretty cool. So part of me wants to apologize for racking up more plays from the Lonely Island's Incredibad than any other album this year. I feel like a nerd. But I think the Lonely Island have found a populist way to elicit the same nerd thrills one would get from the best sketches from ""The State"" or ""Upright Citizens Brigade"". Comedy fans first noticed the Lonely Island's Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer when their series, ""The 'Bu"" debuted on Channel101.com, a site that pushes or pulls comedy shorts based on viewer votes. Because they came from the web, Lonely Island's ""Saturday Night Live"" work understands viral video, so much so that the bulk of their audience may come days or weeks after the original air date. That contributes to the stickiness of their videos. Lonely Island's digital shorts don't care about the instant gratification of ""SNL""'s premise-based sketches (a gratification so instant it usually ends minutes before the sketch does). They're more interested in sustained laughs, clinging tenaciously to tangents, or using repetition to unfold a new layer of weirdness in each iteration. All of those traits apply to their musical shorts, and thus to their first major release, Incredibad. (The album also comes with a DVD of shorts, everything you've seen on ""SNL"" except ""Iran So Far"" and ""I'm on a Boat"", plus two older Lonely Island videos, ""Just 2 Guyz"" and ""Bing Bong Brothers"". ""Just 2 Guyz"" gets remade as ""We Love Sportz"" on Incredibad, but the amazingly awkward original remains the better track.) Incredibad seems unique among musical comedy projects. Production and delivery-wise, ""Lazy Sunday"" and ""On a Boat"" are honest-to-goodness hip-hop tracks. But if you think the target of the satire is hip-hop itself, you're missing the point. Lonely Island don't sell genre parody or irony. These dudes, particularly beatmaker Jorma Taccone (who often writes with his brother Asa Taccone), are obviously hip-hop fans, as Incredibad is appreciative homage, more Beastie Boys than (simply) white and nerdy. That's not always true. Sometimes part of the joke is the contrast between the singer's subject matter and their delivery, (""Lazy Sunday"", ""Natalie's Rap"") though the latter is really all about character destruction, not parody. Most of their jokes come inside the lyrics. Even ""Ras Trent"", their riff on trustafarians, is more about lines like ""Me toil part-time at ja Cold Stone Creamery"" than Rastafarianism itself. Although ""Dick in a Box"" and others are available online, the album-only tracks make it worth getting Incredibad, instead of firing up Hulu.com. ""Like a Boss"" and ""Dreamgirl"" [ft. Norah Jones] deserve video treatment on ""SNL"", but both are hilarious on their own. Like their best, ""SNL""-aired material, these songs get better as they go on, mostly because of the way the lyrics carry the joke to its logical and grotesque endpoint. ""Like a Boss"" begins making fun of Rick Ross and Slim Thug (""Talk to corporate (like a boss)/ Approve memos (like a boss),"" but ends with the singer fucking a giant fish, turning into a jet, and crashing into the sun. Absurdity is the Lonely Island's strongest suit, and thus, the premise-based songs sometimes fall flat. E-40, playing Carlos Santana on ""Santana DVX"", puts in the funniest verse on this premisey song, but Jack Black can't save the guys' one joke on ""Sax Man"". Also, the dudes found another way to respect their favorite genre: Their between-song skits aren't very funny. The Lonely Island understand repetition and exaggeration. On SNL, that was most apparent in their ""Dear Sister"" sketch, its melodramatic, ""O.C.""-savaging death scene iterations getting funnier and funnier. On Incredibad it's the ""boiled goose"" line on ""Boombox"", the endlessly repeated chorus of ""I'm on a boat!"" from ""I'm on a Boat"". Basic comedy stuff, sure, but the guys also have a good sense of when to quit (see also the ""cool beans"" segment in ""Hot Rod""). Maybe it's that same sense of rhythm that guides their songwriting. Maybe that makes this comedy music, instead of musical comedy, because it's hard to tell which one's modifying the other. Still, good timing's good timing.",,7.7,
sBach,sBACH,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbeabf31b7dc7155ffd/1:1/w_160/d2edbd66.jpg,2009-02-18 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12678-sbach/,Suicide Squeeze,"If there's one thing than sBach proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, it's that Hella guitarist Spencer Seim can play the hell out of the drums. This isn't to dismiss his work behind the skins with the Advantage, but to simply point out that Seim spends the majority of this album banging away at his kit at a frenetic and maddening pace. If he can find the space squeeze in another handful of bass drum kicks, or rattle off more snare and cymbal notes, he does it, and then throws in a few more at no extra charge. Seim's percussive generosity wears out its welcome pretty damn quick, which is endemic of this one man group's debut as a whole. While sBach is now a full-fledged band, everything on this album was performed by Seim-- all the frisky fretwork, all the eight-bit power-upsmanship, and all the aforementioned Animal-esque thrashing. It's all done in the service of a record that, despite its relentless attempts to stand out and grab your attention, comes off as an underwhelming, exhausting, and (ironically) anonymous effort. It's only fitting, then, that Seim didn't bother to name the record's 13 tracks-- if you want to make reference to a tune you like, you'll have to make like you're ordering Chinese take-out. And instead of describing the album's lead-off bait-and-switch with easy-to-use song titles, I have to write the following: The first 30 or so seconds of the album's first track are actually from the start of Track 8. So instead of getting the devil-horned payoff promised by the intro's gradual cymbal-laden crescendo, Track 1 takes a sharp left and turns into a guitar plucking exhibition backed with obnoxious high-pitched ringing tones. Eventually, Track 8 comes along and gives listeners the promised payoff, but its big beat and fuzzed-out tones are undercut by Seim's need to make like the Yngwie Malmsteen of drums at every opportunity. (Track 4's pro-forma post-rock lien is a more successful variation on this theme.) Thankfully, Seim doesn't take the same can't-drive-55 approach when it comes to the other instrumentation-- if he mangled his guitar with the same ferocity that he uses on the drums, this record would be wholly unbearable. Instead, he shows relative restraint when, for example, sprinkling Track 2 with a fair helping of MIDI sounds, or leavening the squealing guitar in Track 3 with some small helpings of organ. Once in a while, Seim finds a happy middle ground for his inventiveness and his virtuosity to thrive-- Track 5's transition from loping squelches to triumphant victory march would be the perfect soundtrack for a Legend of Zelda speed run, and the trickling synths draped across Track 6 discreetly disguise Seim's bass-pedal orgy. But for those minor victories, there are plenty crash-and-burn moments like the album's first song, or Track 10, where extra lives and Koopas run full-bore into a severely thorough soundcheck. These sorts of song-length missteps, coupled with the little stylistic hiccups that frequently crop up, undercut any sort of momentum sBach tries to maintain, and turns this one-man labor of love into a chore for the listener.","Spencer Seim, guitarist for Hella and drummer for the Advantage, here takes multi-instrumentalism to its logical conclusion, playing every instrument on this Suicide Squeeze release.

...For the Whole World to See,Death,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26613d197565213886e/1:1/w_160/7a259832.jpg,2009-02-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12673-for-the-whole-world-to-see/,Drag CityDrag City,"No matter how extensively technology's all-seeing eye attempts to catalog every rock recording ever made, Drag City's recent stream of reissues keeps unearthing uber-obscure excellence at a steady clip. After resurrecting 70s folk singer Gary Higgins and early 80s punk polymath JT IV (John Timmis IV), the Chicago-based label brings us Death, an all-black punk/hard-rock trio from Detroit (not to be confused with the 80s speed-metal band). Comprised of brothers David, Bobby, and Dannis Hackney, the band started out in 1971 playing R&B but switched to rock after hearing the raucous proto punk of their neighbors the MC5 and Stooges. That incarnation lasted only a few years and seven songs, and after balking at Columbia Records' demand for a name change, the band relocated to Vermont and reinvented themselves as a gospel rock group. ...For the Whole World to See, recorded in 1974, requires more ballpark adjustments than your average reissue. For one, most bands today fusing breakneck punk with arena rock bombast do so under a massive cloak of irony, and are commonly shunned (c.f. Electric Six). Making matters worse, Death espouses earnest political views while walking that tightrope. Luckily though, there's enough stylistic diversity and ahead-of-time knick-knacks on the album to prove Death more than just fanboys fawning over Kick Out the Jams and Raw Power. Leaning heavily on pregnant pauses and choppy two-note melodies, opener ""Keep on Knocking"" confirms the rock+punk arithmetic of the band's mission statement. The other six tracks don't play out so predictably. ""Let the World Turn"" starts out in a Pink Floyd-style haze of reverberated guitars and detached vocals before igniting into a frenzied speed punk chorus. The ho-hum AOR verses of ""You're a Prisoner"" collide with a doomsday refrain straight out of an Ozzy Osbourne nightmare, while ""Freakin Out"" stands the test of time as the band's most innovative song here, anticipating the jittery pop punk that'd soon arrive from the UK. The album falls short of a diamond-in-the-rough-caliber discovery, but considering these seven songs are the remains of an aborted 12-song full-length-from a band that reinvented itself every three or four years, For the Whole World holds up well alongside, say, concurrent Blue Oyster Cult or New York Dolls albums. This is the kind of reissue that re-instills faith in today's frustrated rockist, the listener whose fidelity gets tested by a rogues gallery of calculating rock revivalists every year. Armed with profound musicianship and the bona fide origin story so many less interesting bands' press kits grasp for, Death comes across as extremely likeable despite gleefully ripping off all the obvious influences.",,7.1,
Studio 1,Studio 1,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26f13d197565213888b/1:1/w_160/60773bb1.jpeg,2009-02-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12682-studio-1/,Studio,"Wolfgang Voigt is one of techno's most impressive figures by any measure (clarity of vision, crispness of technique, and radness of hair chief among them), but of special note now is how important he's been to those who might not have turned to techno without him. When Voigt's work started oozing out of electronic-music circles around the mid-1990s, the notion of German techno retained a significant aura of the exotic and the alien-- engaging with it was more difficult than simply administering a download queue. Voigt's early records-- under aliases like Mike Ink, M:I:5, Gas, and Studio 1-- trafficked in variegated sounds that seemed to share a common project, most likely related to connecting the ineffable qualities of mystery to the strict constraints of structure. And then came offerings from his epochal labels Profan and Kompakt, which helped establish Voigt's hometown of Cologne as a fully functioning electronic-music lab with municipal interests. To legions of far-flung listeners reared on post-rock and curious about snatches of electronic music heard here and there (Autechre, Oval, Aphex Twin), Voigt played as a unique sort of techno ambassador. He was experimental but functionally inclined, meticulous but free, a spirited scenemaker whose singularity was hard to mistake. The classic 12""s made under the name Studio 1 represent Voigt at his rigorous and minimalistic. Indeed, no history of minimal-techno could go long without acknowledging Voigt's debt. But Studio 1 is more than a mere historical artifact, in part for the ways it continues to make the ""present"" its project. One of Voigt's special touches as a producer is the way he articulates everything with a mix of delicacy and force that proves hard to pull apart. It's not far into ""Neu 1"", the first of 10 tracks collected here, when it becomes clear that very little, if anything, is going to change by track's end. (Voigt, in all his guises, is a serious maestro of repetition.) But with that realization comes the strange spectral thrill that attends paying attention to nothing beyond what is most fully and firmly in view. With no prospect of a soothing interlude or a dramatic drop in the offing, focus turns entirely to the tss-tss of the hi-hat, the roundness of a bassline, the clarity of the snare. And from that follows a secondary realization that, in fact, everything is going to change, at least a little. ""Blau 2"" starts with the stoic sound of a warehouse party happening a couple of blocks away, before the steady accrual of minute details gives the whole thing a manic galloping energy. Tracks of that sort scan as ""techno"" in the most austere sense, but others like ""Rosa 1"" delve deep into something more like dub, with shorted-fuse sounds layered over top rhythms that lean back and stay out of the way. And then there’s something like the hyper-hectic ""Rot 2"", which follows clicky formalism to such extremes that it turns to pure abstraction without ever announcing its departure. To that end, every track on Studio 1 plays like a serious study of the ways that articulation means the most when the message starts to stray.","A collection of early techno tracks by German scenemaker and Kompakt co-owner Wolfgang Voigt (aka Gas) marks an embrace of formalism as a way toward something new.

Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a270ea9e61561daa4a4f/1:1/w_160/7c811740.jpg,2009-02-18 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12683-jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit/,Lightning Rod,"The first time most of us heard Jason Isbell was on ""Outfit"", his initial offering on the Drive-By Truckers' 2003 album Decoration Day, the group's first with the Alabama native. An extraordinarily perceptive and sensitive song, especially coming from a 24-year-old, ""Outfit"" finds a working-class father lending advice to his rock star-wannabe son, narrating along the way his own story of teenage rebellion curtailed by the adult responsibilities he ultimately came to cherish. ""Don't sing with a fake British accent"" was one of dad's more memorable dictums, and regardless of how true-to-life ""Outfit"" may have been, it's a charge Isbell has taken to heart. During his five-plus years with the Truckers, Isbell impressively gained a songwriting reputation on par with the band's longtime principals, Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. Yet while Hood's unconventionally hoarse yelp attracted twang-wary indie fans and Cooley's gunslinger drawl was irresistible no matter how you felt about country, Isbell's booming, manful voice irredeemably marked him out as the least hip of the Trucker singers for the duration of his stay. Being the overweight guy in the group for a spell probably didn't help either. Even when Isbell slimmed down considerably, however, he still retained the voice of a guy who takes ham with every meal. When Isbell sings it's not hard to picture an artless blooze belter at some sadly anonymous roadhouse. Now add in the fact that since leaving DBT he's delved much more deeply in musically treacherous blues-rock waters than his erstwhile mates. What it all amounts to is a guy who has just released his second solo record in less than two years and who nonetheless seems destined to be eternally underrated. His occasional bar-band leanings may cause some to miss that Isbell is an invigorating songwriter and one of the better lyricists of his generation. Indeed, Isbell has had trouble catching a break. His 2007 solo debut, Sirens of the Ditch, mildly disappointed some of his staunchest admirers with its lack of historical or regional specificity, spoiled as they were by the likes of DBT songs like ""Outfit"", ""Decoration Day"", ""Danko/Manuel"", and ""The Day John Henry Died"". Yet what Isbell's achieved over the course of that album and his self-titled newest is no less admirable for its paucity of proper nouns, finding unique ways to approach sex, politics, and isolation while delivering rousing, hooky rock'n'roll. So while ""Seven Mile Island"" does reference a real place, and ""However Long"" definitely does seem to reflect an Obama-spurred sense of societal optimism, they're not the album's real lyrical standouts. That honor belongs to the ruminative ""Streetlights"", which shows us an itinerant musician calling home from some faraway bar, and especially ""Soldiers Get Strange"", an utterly spellbinding snapshot of a serviceman who comes home from overseas and finds a return to marital sex and ""toeing civilian lines"" to be a psychological impossibility. Many of the songs on Isbell's sophomore release don't necessarily aim for (or achieve) such profundity, yet they still compel through sheer verve and Isbell's unwillingness to let an unhip sound or idea discourage him. Sure, ""Blue"" sounds like Los Lonely Boys filtered through RHCP's ""Under the Bridge"", but it's still a damn fine song, Isbell showing off his ability to at least be evocatively oblique when he's not exactly hitting his lyrical mark. And if you're going to ape 1960s Stax soul, you might as well dive in headfirst like Isbell does on ""No Choice in the Matter"", an unrepentant throwback that nonetheless nails the warm horns and spindly guitar sound of a classic Otis session perfectly. Sometimes all that's needed is a big, singalong-ready chorus-- they're never as easy to craft as you think, yet Isbell delivers on ""Sunstroke"", the barnburning ""Good"", and especially ""Cigarettes and Wine"". The latter is just as much about faded male vitality as it is sex, drugs, and drink, and is hence destined to be a crowd-pleaser with those ruefully eyeing receding hairlines and spreading paunches. Yep, the only ""hip"" here is the aching one that's sooner or later going to need replacing.","On his second solo album, the former Drive-By Truckers member sticks with what he does best, offering detailed and evocative songwriting in a bar-band setting.

The Spirit of Apollo,N.A.S.A.,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a273b1335d7bf16984ce/1:1/w_160/b8adfac2.jpg,2009-02-18 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12686-the-spirit-of-apollo/,Anti-,"Credit where it's due: Sam Spiegel and Zé Gonzales evidently have really next-level Rolodexes. Spiegel is Spike Jonze's brother, and Gonzales is a pro skateboarder, so it stands to reason that they'd both know some famous people. But the sheer number and scope of guests on The Spirit of Apollo is just absurd. As the sticker on the cover proudly trumpets, the album features ""over 40 guest performances,"" and they come from all over the genre map. Plenty of the contributors here are the type who would show up to the studio if you promised them a half-empty bag of Doritos (looking at you, ca. 2009 David Byrne). But Spiegel and Gonzales have also corralled people like Tom Waits, Sizzla, Scarface: legends with uber-devoted core fanbases who don't have to guest on anyone's album, who only record collaborations when they feel like it. It's tough to calculate what combination of people skills, time management, and networking Spiegel and Gonzales must've put into this thing. They must have some really, really great Doritos. But it would be nice if The Spirit of Apollo had a compelling reason to exist beyond just showing off these guys' Buddy Lists. Because this album is a mess. And worse than that, it's a directionless, vaguely condescending mess that wastes the talents of some people who really should've had better things to do. ""Music and art have the tremendous power of bringing people together, and this is our goal: To show through these mediums that we are all one race of human beings,"" say the liner notes. Which, okay, fine. Noble goal, even if it is the sort of thing that 10th-graders say when they're trying to sound sensitive. But when your idea of creating community is to mush artists of different genres together into a character-free paste, all you're really doing is making a good argument for genre xenophobia. Spiegel and Gonzales are producers, and their beats on this album are total washed-out dorm-room funk, the sort of things that Prince Paul would've tossed in the garbage even at his White People nadir. ""The People Tree"" is an excessively polite bloopy organ groove. ""Way Down"" is the reason acid jazz no longer exists. ""Hip Hop"" is a horribly boring attempt at ca. 1998 sunny smiley-face West Coast indie-rap. And on it goes. These guys were too busy making friends to figure out how to make a beat knock. And if you were wondering how they'd even find room to cram all these guests in, the answer is that they didn't, really. Seu Jorge gets reduced to David Byrne's backup singer, which, I mean, that guy was in City of God. Lykke Li sort of chirps underneath Santogold (who is now called Santigold), and you have to be concentrating hard to even hear her. About half the tracks feature consequence-free wickety-wickety scratch solos from vaguely famous turntablists. And even when the guests actually get to make their voices heard, in most case they shouldn't have bothered. N.A.S.A.'s lighter-than-air uptempo beats have the unfortunate effect of making half the guest-rappers sound exactly like Chali 2na of Jurassic 5. And all I can say about that: If Chuck D shows up and it takes you a minute to realize that he's not Chali 2na, you've got a problem on your hands. Another damning example: ""The Mayor"", buried near the end of the album. The last time Ghostface and Scarface showed up on the same track, it was on one of those goofy Kay Slay official mix albums. And Slay, not exactly known for his great instincts, at least had the good sense to give them a banging low-budget NY rap beat and a gimmicky song title (""Face Off"") and just let them rip. Spiegel and Gonzales give them a cluttered cartoon-funk beat and force them to share space with a DJ AM scratch-solo and the motherfucking Cool Kids. Even those of us who like the Cool Kids acknowledge that these guys don't have anything approaching the gravitas you need to share a mic with these two. Look, it's not all terrible. On ""N.A.S.A. Music"", E-40 and Method Man manage to get a nice little back-and-forth going, and the beat, with its windy guitar and Afrobeat horn-stabs, stays out of the way. ""Gifted"" is a decent shot at glossy Richard X electro-pop, and Kanye West and Santigold handle it ably. M.I.A.'s chorus on ""Whachadoin?"" will not leave my head, ever. But I'm still planning on deleting the not-terrible tracks from my iTunes the second I turn this review in. Even the best of these songs are not worth the hard-drive real estate. If anything, The Spirit of Apollo should serve as a cautionary tale. These clusterfuck all-the-cooks experiments, more often than not, add up to way, way less than the sum of their parts. It might look great on paper to get weirdo visionaries like Kool Keith and Tom Waits on the same track, but if you actually do it, you'll probably end up with Keith blathering non-sequiturs all over the beat while Waits makes sandpapery fart noises. And as for the impression of Donald Duck busting a nut that someone does at the end of ""O Pato"", I can't imagine that even looked good on paper.",,1.6,
Emerald Eyes,Fight Bite,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a265ea9e61561daa4a2c/1:1/w_160/687e680b.jpg,2009-02-17 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12672-emerald-eyes/,self-released,"While a name like Fight Bite may conjure images of ""CSI"" investigations or that Tyson/Holyfield ear kafuffle, the music of this Texas-based duo is so placid and peaceful as to make their moniker a joke. On Emerald Eyes, their self-released debut, they spackle a hazy wash of Leanne Macomber's wispy, French-pop-star voice over molasses-slow keyboard drones and icily removed synthesized beats. The result is somewhat akin to the sexy somnambulance of Beach House or the eerie ambiance of Julee Cruise, and thus Fight Bite join other members of the freshman class of 2008 (see also: Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts) who are obsessed with Phil Spector's girl-group pop and aloof shoegazer effects. Unlike their classmates, however, they are neither from Brooklyn nor are they interested in garage-rock throttle, so their dreamy, dense songs are infused with a suburban innocence and drained of anything resembling aggression or rebellion. Fight Bite first made a name for themselves in 2008 with their blog-beloved single ""Swissex Lover"", and that gossamer duet is still the standout: Macomber's whispery voice leaks into the shimmering keyboards, whose drowsy calliope tones are almost indistinguishable from Jeff Louis' faraway backing vocals. Most of the nine other tracks on the collection follow a similar formula: slow, haunting keyboard chords fill up the track leaving little room for the tinny percussion or watery, remote singing that spills into a wash of diaphanous melody. Specific lyrics are, therefore, hard to identify, but clearly these are bruised love songs, as the ache is palpable. There are few tracks that rise above the album's purposely laconic pace, but those that do are among the collection's best. ""Age of Faith"", with its percolating ""ba ba ba""s and Macomber's Shangri-Las-indebted spoken-word patter, is a welcome moment of levity, even if much of its bright coloring is buried behind a thick cloud of foggy reverb. ""Widow's Peak"" is a stinging tune built on a buzzing keyboard foundation that begins as videogame bleeps and evolves into a gothic carousel stomp. And ""Small Wonder"" raises the pulse of the rhythmically mannered record with almost-dancefloor-worthy beats and a melody that, despite being delivered in a glossy coo and cocooned in lovely harmony, can't help but remind you of the chorus to Rick Springfield's ""I've Done Everything For You"". The main problem, however, with this charming album it's that it is too one-note. With not enough dynamic difference between them, the gauzy songs start to bleed together. But that's a rookie mistake. Fight Bite definitely have more songs in them like ""Swissex Lover"", and their moderately up-tempo numbers show a lot of promise. Perhaps on their next outing they will have developed enough confidence in their sound to stray outside its strict parameters. In the meantime, we have the analog warmth of Emerald Eyes-- a perfect hibernation soundtrack-- to keep us cozy during this chilly season.","This placid and peaceful Texas-based duo favors molasses-slow keyboard drones and heavily reverbed vocals, sometimes evoking the dreaminess and eerie ambience of Beach House or Julee Cruise.

Black Forest (Tra La La),Pale Young Gentlemen,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26913d197565213887a/1:1/w_160/3aa45ffe.jpg,2009-02-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12676-black-forest-tra-la-la/,Science of Sound,"Here's the conclusion from my review of the Pale Young Gentlemen's 2007 self-released debut: ""while Pale Young Gentlemen is frontloaded and slightly naïve...there's more than enough reason to anticipate what they're capable of when they decide to get darker, older, and less gentle."" I love it when bands make it easy for me: Though the concept of ""growth"" can border on illusory, the shady, gnarled Black Forest comes on less strong than Pale Young Gentlemen, but is ultimately a lot harder to shake than its charming, if slightly hammy predecessor. Similar to fellow Wisconsinites Violet Femmes, PYG essentially render a normally bombastic framework in acoustic terms: For the former, it was punk; for the latter, it's orchestral pop. ""We could talk for hours/ Or maybe not at all"" doesn't read like much of a mission statement, but sunk within album centerpiece ""Kettle Drum (I Left a Note)"", it's indicative of a band learning to leave more to the imagination. Despite massive turnover amidst its ranks and less than a year removed from Pale Young Gentlemen, what distinguishes Black Forest is the patience of confident survivors, not just of their first tour, but the easy comparisons to more maudlin and forthright old world-influenced acts like Beirut. And it's tough record to initially get a hold of with all of its novel textures-- like their self-titled, Black Forest begins with a stuttering acoustic riff suggesting hip-hop as much as folk, but ""Coal/Ivory"" morphs into something more expansive and majestic, replete with the keenest coal lyric this side of ""Oxford Comma"".  Nearly every track is built off a new string instrument, from the stumbling, thumbed arpeggios that give ""I Wasn't Worried"" a subtle charm to the washed-out harp of ""We Will Meet"" to the pizzicato, agreeably bumbling chorus of ""Wedding Guest"". Throughout, Michael Reisenauer's maundering vocals holds the disparate arrangements together like putty, though his lyrics are just shy of scrutability for the most part, overcast invocations of women and wine. The light touch might still be a turnoff to some, since they're occasionally boxed in by their commitment to a sort of pop music that more archaic than Arcade-ish. ""The Crook of My Good Arm"" is the most obvious ""rock"" moment, with a vigorous tempo and a cello riff simulating the bass-- a trick also used by A.C. Newman. More surprising is how the violin jabs of ""Our History"" recall ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and its martial stridency: Reisenauer's cry ""I was like a child/ You can't touch me!"" is more of a well-earned moment of release than a cheap joke. Which is not to call these guys prudes-- it's a testament to their mastery of subtle suggestion that a line like ""Bodies twist and hips crash/ Kissing thighs in between"" can blend in without triggering a gag reflex.","Stripping down orchestral pop to something acoustic and approachable-- much like fellow Wisconsinites Violent Femmes did with punk a quarter-century ago-- Pale Young Gentlemen make nice strides on their second album.

Tight Knit,Vetiver,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a267c0084474cd0c002f/1:1/w_160/932c962f.jpg,2009-02-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12674-tight-knit/,Sub Pop,"Just in case there was any lingering confusion, Andy Cabic and his cohorts in Vetiver did an excellent job in 2008 of further outlining their overall musical objectives. On their covers album Thing of the Past and the supplemental EP More of the Past, Vetiver paid faithful homage to a very specific brand of dazed Americana, covering songs by Townes Van Zandt, Norman Greenbaum, and Michael Hurley, as well reviving several long-lost obscurities by such lesser-known songwriters as Garland Jeffreys and Elyse Weinberg. All of the source material for these covers can be roughly dated to 1969-73 time period, and throughout their performances Vetiver showed a virtually effortless affinity for the playing and production styles of that era's folk-rock and cosmic country. Now Vetiver make their Sub Pop debut with Tight Knit, their first album of original material since 2006's To Find Me Gone and fourth album overall. Though the songs are all written by Cabic, he has learned well the lessons of Thing of the Past, and his new work remains very much in that same early-70s headspace. Produced by longtime Vetiver associate Thom Monahan, Tight Knit is built with a keen ear for detail, be it a subtle dose of pedal steel or a gently rippling guitar effect, and it features Cabic's most consistently engaging batch of songs to date. As has been the case in the past, Vetiver's roster on this album straddles the line between a full band and a Cabic solo project. On several tracks here Cabic plays all the instruments himself, while others feature the touring group that includes well-traveled drummer Otto Hauser and Currituck Co.'s guitarist Kevin Barker. To Cabic and Monahan's credit, however, these shifts in personnel are largely invisible, and the songs all hang easily together as a coherent whole. In what seems a show of Cabic's genial self-assurance, he kicks off Tight Knit with ""Rolling Sea"", a sun-dappled country ballad that wouldn't have startled a soul if it had drifted out of an AM radio 35 years ago. Elsewhere Cabic takes greater chances, such as on the standout ""Another Reason to Go"", which adds Clavinet and horns to a well-turned hippie groove that seems a distant cousin to the Grateful Dead's ""Estimated Prophet."" Equally memorable is the melodic ""On the Other Side"", whose easy gait is measured by the steady clip-clop of a drum machine, and on which Cabic issues what could be his mission statement, gently decrying those unmellow types who ""get nervous and act uptight"" or otherwise ""fuss and fight"" before he helpfully points out ""that just ain't my speed."" Nice and midtempo-- that's more Cabic's speed. And even at its most innovative, Tight Knit still finds Vetiver returning time and again to the familiar shores of West Coast country-rock and the untroubled pace of their Thing of the Past forefathers. Yet in the face of Cabic's relentless positive vibrations it feels somehow unacceptably churlish to say harsh words against either the driving, Gene Clark rhythms of ""Everyday"" and ""More of This"" or the dreamy, pastoral folk of the closing ""At Forest Edge"". With their boundaries and ambitions by now well established, on Tight Knit Cabic and company largely succeed in luring the listener hazily back in time and into Vetiver's comfort zone.","The fourth album (first for Sub Pop) from this folk-rock/cosmic country band is built with a keen ear for detail, be it a subtle dose of pedal steel or a gently rippling guitar effect, and it features leader Andy Cabic's most consistently engaging batch of songs to date.

Hush,Asobi Seksu,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2729d034d5c69bf2bd4/1:1/w_160/332472e3.jpg,2009-02-17 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12685-hush/,Polyvinyl,"They've never really overhauled their sound, but Asobi Seksu have still managed, with the release of Hush, to subvert my expectations three consecutive times. In 2003, a name that loosely translates to ""casual sex"" and a J-Pop-inspired album cover certainly didn't add up in my mind to ""passable c. 1996 Lush pastiche."" Three years hence, after I'd forgotten about them, they go and drop Citrus, either a feat of reinvention or maturation, depending on who you ask, but a minor miracle either way. I still find myself listening to the gauzy, slo-mo bubble-gum of ""Thursday"" once or twice a week: a John Hughes film-ending, ""Kim & Jessie""-style jam, it retains the power to make a simple walk down the street intensely melodramatic (and is by itself better than anything Lush ever did). Now, another three years have passed, Citrus made me look forward to Hush, and here I am again, a bit perplexed. And not just because I can't figure out what those mysterious woodland creatures are surrounding Yuki Chikudate on the cover. The last two album titles are instructive: Citrus was lively and sharp, while Hush too often refuses to rise above its inside voice. Now whittled down to the duo of Chikudate and James Hanna, Asobi Seksu have moved to the middle of Citrus' broad tonal palette rather than expanding upon its quietly experimental tendencies. ""Me and Mary"", for some reason buried at the end of the album like it's playing under the closing credits, is the most chipper tune they've ever recorded. It's also the most satisfying track on Hush because it doesn't simply suggest something without delivering; it's all bridge-chorus indulgence, something that the band is good at, and which the music itself suggests might be part of its DNA. Earlier, ""In the Sky"" and ""Meh No Mae""-- essentially low-key rewrites of ""Thursday""s gossamer, multiple-crescendo approach-- acquire much of their distinctiveness from being surrounded by opalescent mood pieces. And that's the thing: Hush uses the same tools as Citrus-- treated guitar arpeggios, wobbly organ drones, rumbling drums and Chikudate's piercing high soprano-- but recombines them in ways that don't add up to much that sticks. Like Blonde Redhead and School of Seven Bells (and the Cocteau Twins before them), Asobi Seksu are studio-rat dream-pop conjurers, crafting sophisticated sky-castles designed to whisk us alight. Over the past two years, however, the first two groups have made glimmering, propulsive variations on essentially the same aesthetic template as Hush, yet one based around what felt like an M.O. of songs first, style second. The paint-by-numbers preciousness of ""Gliss"" and queasy Brit-Pop of ""I Can't See"", while pleasant enough on their own terms, don't bring it enough for Chikudate and Hanna to keep up with their most recognizable contemporaries. None of this is to say that Hush is a bad album-- far from it. It is a work that shows a band still struggling to come to terms with itself, discovering on record the music it wants to make, and settling for a safe middle ground in the end. On ""Familiar Light"", an early track that again teases toward something grand but stops mid-bloom, Chikudate seems to hint at her current creative methodology: ""I stared at the ceiling/ To regain some feeling."" Question: Was the ceiling stark white, perhaps with a stucco texture, maybe with occasional jagged cracks breaking up the uniformity? Hmm. Perhaps for album four, looking out the window again might be a better idea.","Now a duo of Yuki Chikudate and James Hanna, Asobi Seksu return with a third album that takes the dreamy shoegaze palette of 2006's Citrus into a quieter and and more reserved place.

Hold Time,M. Ward,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26eb1335d7bf16984c4/1:1/w_160/2e0771fb.jpg,2009-02-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12681-hold-time/,Merge,"Matt Ward is no longer at the point in his career where you devote an entire album to the memory of an obscure folk guitar hero. The Portland-based singer, songwriter, and accomplished guitar player is enjoying his highest level of mainstream recognition yet, thanks in no small part to a fine, comfortingly nostalgic collaboration with actress Zooey Deschanel last year as She & Him. He has shared stages with Norah Jones, Jenny Lewis, Bright Eyes, and My Morning Jacket. During the presidential primary season, he played a benefit show for Barack Obama. On Hold Time, Ward loses himself to find himself. With increasingly expansive production and broader lyrical themes, Ward's sixth studio album polishes away a little bit more of the individual character that makes his best recordings so human and rewarding. Paradoxically, that mostly just reinforces Ward's defining trait: a conviction that simple songs can transcend time, and that categorizing music by era can be just as artificial as categorizing music by genre. Ward argues his case pretty convincingly for much of the album, if not quite as eloquently as he has in the past. Hold Time is not an album-length diatribe about your cable company's understaffed customer-service call centers. ""If only I could hold time,"" Ward's winningly cracked voice sighs wistfully on the title track, a strings-and-piano ballad that sounds like ""The Long and Winding Road"" and name-checks the Beach Boys compilation Endless Summer. Where 2003's Transfiguration of Vincent was inspired by a memorial service for folk legend John Fahey, 2005's Transistor Radio had the golden age of radio, and 2006's Post-War had wars, Hold Time is conceptually similar to Ward's underrated sophomore album, 2001's End of Amnesia. Back then Ward was helping us remember. Now he's making time stand still, with old sounds, a few old songs, and age-old subjects: love, god, old songs. He also has some indie-famous guest stars. Bigger arrangements; same folk, rock'n'roll, and Americana roots. With mixing and assistance from Saddle Creek mainstay Mike Mogis, plus strings by Peter Broderick (Horse Feathers, Efterklang), Ward keeps his voice sounding lo-fi even when the production is Phil Spector-sized. ""Never Had Nobody Like You"" alludes to The Dark Side of the Moon while basically rewriting The Music Man's ""Till There Was You"" as a stomping glam-rock duet with Deschanel. Ward could've stopped writing ""Stars of Leo"" early and called it ""I Get So High"", but to his credit he keeps going; the cascading guitars, vivid verses, and multi-layered percussion make it one of the album's best tracks (though it's not actually ""above"" the name-checked ""Sea of Love""). However, orchestration and vocal overdubs aren't enough to save acoustic strummer ""Jailbird"" from dying in its cage, despite some twangy, lyrical lead guitar work. God is the perfect subject for a songwriter of Ward's aspirations toward timelessness. Shuffling guitar hoedown ""Fisher of Men"" extends one of Jesus' favorite metaphors, while the organ-kissed surfer-folk wisdom of stripped-down ""Blake's View"" is touching and beautifully phrased, its potentially grating reference to Blake perhaps a way for Ward to distance himself from the song's reassuring sentiments even while offering us comfort in them (pretty close to Transfiguration's ""Dead Man"", though). ""If you're trying to sing an old song/ You're getting all the words wrong,"" he sings, crediting Paul, whether the Apostle or the Beatle, on strings plus banjo acid-rocker ""Epistemology"". Grandaddy's Jason Lytle fits well enough into the Wall of Sound on bouncy, clever ""To Save Me"". Suggested alternate title: ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands (So Would It Kill the Motherfucker to Answer a Guy's Prayers?)"". Covers are another way Ward sets Hold Time out of time. One of them sure goes on forever, anyway: a ponderous rendition of country classic ""Oh Lonesome Me"" with awkward call and response vocals featuring an out-of-place Lucinda Williams. Buddy Holly's ""Rave On"" matches up nicely with Ward's simple-is-good philosophy, and this laid-back remake is sonically detailed enough (another Deschanel guest spot) to justify itself-- it has nothing on Transfiguration's irony-free cover of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", though. Meanwhile, Ward's instrumental take on Billie Holiday-sung jazz standard ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" is a smoldering guitar showcase recalling Neil Young's Dead Man soundtrack work or the solos of Giant Sand's Howe Gelb, who released Ward's debut a decade ago. Memory is the world's greatest liar. So it's possible that Ward's past albums seem a cut or two above Hold Time only through the rose-tinted lens of hindsight-- sort of like how we've come to romanticize the Old West, say, or previous eras of rock'n'roll. But the new one, although steeped in American music tradition, could use some more of the pioneering spirit that got us here. Hold Time is an enjoyable, well-constructed album, and as good a place as any for newcomers to start-- it just doesn't hold many surprises. If it all seems too familiar to you, too impersonal, try the back catalog. As memory turns to myth, some myths are worth remembering. Not only John Henry, but Prometheus, too.",,6.8,
Anthology 1997-98,Faraquet,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25c9d034d5c69bf2b9f/1:1/w_160/50369adc.jpg,2009-02-13 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12665-anthology-1997-98/,Dischord,"Faraquet's history reads like a love letter to Washington, D.C. punk. Former Smart Went Crazy band members Devin Ocampo and Jeff Boswell formed a math-rockin' power trio with Chad Molter in 1997, released various singles and a split before stepping up with their only full-length, The View From This Tower, in 2000. In 2001, Faraquet disbanded, and Ocampo and Molter went on to play in Medications. To generalize: former members of forgotten, underrated post-punk band coalesce into a second forgotten, underrated post-punk band that yields an unknown, presumably underrated post-punk band, most of this occurring on, where else, Dischord Records. This progression is D.C. punk's version of ""growing up and getting a real job."" Anthology 1997-98 is a collection of the scattered tracks that Faraquet recorded in and after the dying months of Smart Went Crazy, before the release of their debut album; what it lacks in crucial insight it makes up for with nostalgia and completeness. The ""Why?"" alarm in your head is surely sound sounding: Collections like this don't need any Herculean purpose, but neither should the primary reason to anthologize a band's material be ""just because,"" especially when said anthology more than doubles the number of songs available. The best reason may be this: The View From This Tower stands as perhaps the best representation of ""the Dischord sound"" this decade, what with Fugazi mostly on hiatus, Q and Not U weirding out, and Lungfish being and sounding like Lungfish. Anthology is the rollup to View, 10 tracks of Ocampo's boiling guitar and Molter's creatively nervous drumming that contain whiffs of scene-y righteousness mostly overpowered by the group's meticulous anti-jams. For the official ledger, the whole of Faraquet is now available, with these recordings lovingly remixed and remastered. The list of journalistically approved adjectives for groups of Faraquet's ilk goes like this: precise, angular, frenetic, and shout-y. Apply those liberally to Anthology but also realize that even as Faraquet mimicked the hoary guitars of Fugazi and the controlled rush of Nation of Ulysses, they were (conservatively) incorporating synthesizers, horns, and string sections into their arrangements. The band's truest influence on Dischord, thematically at least, is probably Jawbox, another declarative, hot-city combo. Not showy instrumentally, Faraquet's feeling-out process led to indefinable song structures on tracks like ""Yo-Yo"" and ""Study in Movement"", both of which might provide tidy sub-headlines for any discussion of Faraquet's melodic ideas. Not that all of this is apparent from ""Parakeet"" and ""Um Die Ecke"", together the competing sides of Faraquet's first single, the former building momentum from an aggressively lapping riff and the latter winding tightly with syncopated rhythms and Ocampo's still-evolving growl. Ocampo's vocals are the surest barometer of the group's progress; on early songs they echoed the frustration and gnash of his guitar, but by 1998's split with Akarso, they were contemplative and considered, even as he hovered too long on consonants and clipped lines short. Ocampo at times seems conflicted about whether to express his ideas vocally or via guitar, resulting in verses and choruses that appear in odd intervals. On ""Rex"" and ""Sea Song"" (an alternate take on a View track) Ocampo augments his band's strident, mid-tempo vamps with a young man's regrets: ""I'm drunk again."" It remains difficult to recommend to anyone not already a convert a 10-song odds-and-sods collection of a not-seminal band that released one nine-song album most of a decade ago. Anthology provides ample reason to reevaluate View, but it does not improve or expand upon it. Faraquet re-formed in 2007 to play several shows; hope that those performances and this documentation remind the band of the creativity and excitement they had just begun exploring on the recordings contained here.","This collection gathers stray tracks and singles from the short-lived and underrated D.C. band on Dischord that grew out of Smart Went Crazy.

Recitement,Stephen Emmer,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05513d197565213836c/1:1/w_160/7af2554b.jpg,2009-02-13 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12625-recitement/,Allegro Music,"On Recitement, the Dutch composer Stephen Emmer builds music around spoken literary texts. Because of that sentence alone, I'd wager that some of you are aiming for your browser's back arrow. Spoken word gets a bad rap in part because of a hoary yet persistent caricature: the finger-snapping, beret-wearing, boho poet who declaims jive over noodly jazz or po-faced folk. This straw man is so pervasive in popular culture-- it gave us Maynard G. Krebs, Cool Cat, and Shaggy from ""Scooby-Doo""-- that it's easy to forget the beatnik way isn't the only way. Recitement, which features Emmer's music supporting poems and stories of different eras, some of which are read by their original authors, does occasionally flirt with stereotype. Sometimes the results are enchanting anyway-- you can practically smell the clove smoke wafting through the smooth horns of ""Mondo Sparito"", which features Andrea Piovan reading from Alessandro Baricco's novel City-- and sometimes they're off-putting. Emmer courts pigeonholing when he backs a reading by Beat archetype Allen Ginsberg with bombastic folk-rock on ""Disconnected"", and Michael Parkinson hams up a lovely Thomas Hardy poem on ""Invergence of the Twain"". These few missteps emphasize how admirably Emmer succeeds in avoiding cliché on most of the tracks, which are mainly arranged and played by the composer himself (with a bit of help from auxiliary musicians), and bolstered by Tony Visconti's limpid production. Emmer's miscellaneous musical career, which encompasses free jazz, rock, electronic noise (he was a member of the Factory-signed band Minny Pops), and points outlying, is reflected in the startlingly diverse music on Recitement. This breadth of capability allows him to achieve the most difficult trick of spoken word music: symmetry of form and content, with neither feeling subordinate to the other. So Yoko Ono's ""Listen, the Snow is Falling"" (sung by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino) gets arctic drone-rock that accentuates its stateliness; Lou Reed's humble rendition of an excerpt from Paul Theroux's travelogue The Great Railway Bazaar gets elegiac piano and strings that conjure stations streaming across train windows; Kurt Schwitters's seminal sound poem ""Ursonate"" gets syncopated avant-jazz that draws out his nonsense language's decorative, expressive quality. Elsewhere, Emmer avails himself of hip-hop, ambient, chamber music, and techno influences, always keeping his sights on the twin goals of sounding good and drawing out the resonance of his selected texts and voices. The best compositions create harmonious interplay between the various tiers that spoken word music contains: The sound of the voice, the sound of the words, the images the words embody, and the images the music embodies all dissolve into one boundless mass. On ""The Leaden Echo"", the late Welsh actor Richard Burton draws out the fleet rhythms of a stunning poem by the experimental Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins; Burton's crisp, theatrical diction blends into a haze of swirling strings with a few subtle voice manipulations at certain enjambments. On ""Absolutely Grey"", jazz wordsmith Ken Nordine's rich baritone echoes itself in whispers amid camera whirs, sonar blips, and shifting percussion that helps him hover or surge without changing his inflection. The balance of poppy, purely musical tracks and esoteric, more sculptural ones keeps the record lively, and it has considerable archival value as well: For book lovers, the drowsy lounge-music strains of ""Everness"" are almost beside the point; to hear the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges reading in his native tongue is sufficient. Song lyrics are not poetry and poems are not songs, but that doesn't mean poetry and music can't agreeably coexist-- even, in the right hands, enhance each other-- as Emmer so convincingly asserts on Recitement.","The versatile Dutch composer Stephen Emmer, with production from Tony Visconti, combines music and spoken literary texts, with readers like Lou Reed, Allen Ginsberg, and Jorge Luis Borges tackling words by Yoko Ono, Paul Theroux, Samuel Beckett, and more.

The Bright Orange Years / All-Night Lotus Party,Volcano Suns,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25fb1335d7bf16984a6/1:1/w_160/3320bfb6.jpg,2009-02-13 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12668-the-bright-orange-years-all-night-lotus-party/,HomesteadHomestead,"Given how bracing and rough they could sound, 1980s Boston trio Volcano Suns were impressively multi-dimensional. There's humor in their lopsided beats and wise-guy lyrics; muscle in the fuzz and grit of their spilling guitars; catchiness in their power-poppish melodies; and a classicism in their sing-along choruses. Take ""The Mouth That Roared"", from their 1985 Homestead debut The Bright Orange Years (recently given deluxe reissue treatment by Merge, along with the band's follow-up, All-Night Lotus Party). Opening with blurting horns and a hard-headed beat, it rides Peter Prescott's loudmouth hollers over a subdued bridge into a soaring, anthemic climax, finally collapsing with his dying wail. Not bad for a simple 4/4 post-punk song. If that anthemic part sounds familiar, that's because it was also a hallmark of Prescott's previous band, Mission of Burma. He naturally brought a lot of the rhythmic juice and songwriting skills he had honed in that group to Volcano Suns. But while MoB were an equal melding of three personalities, the Suns were distinctly the brainchild of Prescott, who sang, drummed, and wrote most of the songs. Before you can even begin to admire such multi-tasking, Prescott mocks it on Bright Orange's insta-classic opener, ""Jak"": ""Jack of all trades and master of none,"" he snarls. ""How can a person get anything done?"" The propulsive melody answers that question, as does the rest of this masterful record. From the ascending instrumental ""Truth is Stranger than Fishing"", to the charging punker ""Cover"", to the unabashedly pretty ""Cornfield"" (featuring a rambling piano solo), Volcano Suns can seemingly do no wrong-- and when they do, it sounds like they know it and are ready to make things right again. Even the nine bonus tracks (including a surprisingly earnest live cover of Prince's ""1999"") offer little to complain about, and lots to love.__ Released a year later, All-Night Lotus Party doesn't quite catch the debut's magic. With fewer brain-sticking melodies and swelling choruses, it favors the blunter end of the Suns' spectrum, with overdriven songs that tend to blur together. Still, there are gems like the swinging ""Sounds Like Bucks"", the beatific ""Room With a View"", and another perfect opener, ""White Elephant""-- a pithy ode to an obsessed collector who becomes just another possession in his crush's romantic stockpile. Merge's addition of some frenetic covers (the Beatles' ""Polythene Pam"", Amboy Dukes' ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"", even Spinal Tap's ""Jazz Odyssey"") pushes the reissue back toward the kind of reckless fun Bright Orange is drenched in.__ Volcano Suns would make another album for Homestead, two for SST (including the sprawling 2xLP masterpiece Thing of Beauty), and a 1991 swansong for Quarterstick, Career in Rock. All are fine expressions of Prescott's idiosyncratic vision, which in turn has rippled back through the recent work of Mission of Burma Mark II. But as a summation of his many talents, The Bright Orange Years has no peer.",,8.2,
Goodnight Oslo,Robyn Hitchcock,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25e13d1975652138858/1:1/w_160/43e8f552.jpg,2009-02-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12667-goodnight-oslo/,Yep Roc,"As a seasoned iconoclast of alternative British rock, former Soft Boys guitarist Robyn Hitchcock has an impressive if somewhat scattered discography. After the Byrds-influenced post-psychedelic jangle of the Soft Boys came to a grinding halt in 1981, Hitchcock went on to establish a solo career with nearly 20 erratic albums of varying standards, all of which are harnessed by his proclivity for sharp, surreal lyrics and experimental yet accessible song structures. Goodnight Oslo, the second album Hitchcock has recorded with the Venus 3 (a cast of rock veterans including Peter Buck and fellow R.E.M contributors Scott McCaughey and drummer Bill Rieflin) falls in the center of the discography pack, nipping at the heels of Hitchcock's better moments from the last three decades, such as Fegmania! (1985) and Olé! Tarantula (2006). Never shy of incorporating a wide range of styles into his music, Hitchcock mirrors his influences with thoughtful enthusiasm while throwing his characteristic sardonic humor into the mix. As usual, echoes of Syd Barrett, the Beatles, and Television Personalities are heard frequently. Yet Goodnight Oslo is a capricious affair, veering from big band grandiosity to quirky pop and rollicking country ballads. Just as the content darts around stylistically, so does the overall quality of the songs. ""Your Head Here"", for example, is a wonderfully dynamic combination of Fall-esque half-spoken/half-sung monologues, driving beats, and vague guitar chords which provide an ideal platform for Hitchcock's wry lyricism. After such a magnetic highlight, the disappointment of the following track, ""Saturday Groovers"", comes as a stiff blow. Suddenly we've gone from solid, enigmatic, and well-developed songwriting to a kitschy singalong in the style of Herman's Hermits! It's a shame these rough patches rear up from time to time, because there is plenty of great material on Goodnight Oslo. The common problem with musical prolificacy on the scale of an artist such as Robyn Hitchcock is that the musician is in danger of forgetting to pluck the weeds from a field full of flowers. Strong tracks such as ""Up to Our Nex"" or ""Sixteen Years"", which has a beautiful, spiraling guitar line and pensive harmonica interlude, tends to upstage rather than compliment the tepidity of ""TLC"" or the pub rock sounding jam of opening track ""What You Is"". Hitchcock has a vibrant, accommodating and well-explored musical aesthetic, and it's always reassuring to hear more mature artists continuing to experiment and develop throughout an ever-expanding canon. However, one gets the feeling that with a little more ruthlessness about what makes the final cut, Goodnight Oslo could offer more hits than misses. As it is, it falls just a little short.","Iconoclast and leader of both the Soft Boys and his Egyptians, Robyn Hitchock again teams with R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and well-known utility player Scott McCaughey on his latest solo record.

Paul’s Boutique,Beastie Boys,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a264c0084474cd0c0025/1:1/w_160/28dbee9d.jpg,2009-02-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12671-pauls-boutique/,CapitolCapitol,"It’s easy to forget exactly how painted into a corner the Beastie Boys were after Licensed to Ill came out. Every complaint people harbor against so-called “hipster rap” today had its genesis in that debut album nearly 23 years ago—a bunch of upper-middle-class, never-been-battled punk rockers in leather jackets and skinny jeans bellowing knowingly obnoxious, semi-ironic lyrics—and it only escalated once the question of the inevitable follow-up came around. The only thing that would piss purists off more than the notion of three clownish white Jewish kids accidentally inventing frat-rap is the fact that they wound up ditching a beloved hip-hop label in Def Jam for the corporate juggernaut of Capitol Records. Not to mention jetting their asses to Los Angeles to cut records with the dudes who produced Tone Lōc’s “Wild Thing.” When Paul’s Boutique famously tanked upon release—peaking at #14 on a pre-Soundscan Billboard 200 and, even more damningly, only #24 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Top Albums chart—the haters triumphantly chortled along with 3rd Bass: “Screamin’ ‘Hey Ladies,’ Why bother?” Twenty years later, nobody’s asking that question. Paul’s Boutique is a landmark in the art of sampling, a reinvention of a group that looked like it was heading for a gimmicky, early dead-end, and a harbinger of the pop-culture obsessions and referential touchstones that would come to define the ensuing decades' postmodern identity as sure as “The Simpsons” and Quentin Tarantino did. It’s an album so packed with lyrical and musical asides, namedrops, and quotations that you could lose an entire day going through its Wikipedia page and looking up all the references; “The Sounds of Science” alone redirects you to the entries for Cheech Wizard, Shea Stadium, condoms, Robotron: 2084, Galileo, and Jesus Christ. That density, sprawl, and information-overload structure was one of the reasons some fans were reluctant to climb on board. But by extending Steinski’s rapid-fire sound-bite hip-hop aesthetic over the course of an entire album, the Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers more than assured that a generally positive first impression would eventually lead to a listener’s dedicated, zealous headlong dive into the record’s endlessly-quotable deep end. There’s a lot that's already been said about the daring eclecticism and arguably irreproducible anything-goes technique with which the Dust Brothers assembled the album’s beats. The music is a big, shameless love letter to the 1970s filled with a conceptual bookend (the Idris Muhammad-sampling, ladies-man ether frolic “To All the Girls”), numerous line-completing lyrical interjections from Johnny Cash, Chuck D, Pato Banton and Sweet, and, just for kicks, nine truncated songs spliced together and stuck in at the end as a staggering 12 and 1/2-minute suite. If the sonics on It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back evoked a sleep-shattering wake-up call and 3 Feet High and Rising a chilled-out, sunny afternoon, the personality of Paul’s Boutique completed the trinity by perfectly capturing the vibe of a late-night alcohol and one-hitter-fueled shit-talk session. Even now, after being exposed to successively brilliant sample-slayers from the RZA to the Avalanches to J Dilla, it’s still bracing just how meticulous the beats are here. These aren’t just well-crafted loops, they’re self-contained little breakbeat universes filled with weird asides, clever segues, and miniature samples-as-punchlines. There’s dozens of clever touches and big, ambitious ideas that still sound inspired: a cameo appearance by the opening drumbeats of Mountain’s “Mississippi Queen” in “Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun”; the manic yet seamless percussion rolls and the giddy tour through the Car Wash soundtrack on “Shake Your Rump”; the two-part slow-to-fast tweaking of late-period Beatles on “The Sounds of Science”; a sparingly-used Alice Cooper guitar riff adding a mockingly pseudo-badass counter to the whimsical Gene Harris-based soul jazz backbone of “What Comes Around.” It all gets writ large in “B-Boy Bouillabaisse,” the aforementioned album-closing suite, which careens through turntablist striptease, a not-yet-throwback 808/beatboxing showcase, funk grooves of every conceivable tempo, and a Jeep-beat bass monster so massive and all-consuming that Jay-Z and Lil Wayne 2.0’d it in late 2007. Even the less-frenetic moments are sonically inventive; there’s only two acknowledged and minimally-tinkered-with samples in “3-Minute Rule,” augmented with a starkly simple bassline from MCA himself, but it’s one of the finest examples of deep, cavernous dub-style production on any golden age rap record. And, of course, there’s Ad-Rock and MCA and Mike D themselves. Where the aesthetic of Licensed to Ill could have permanently placed them in the crass dirtbag-shtick company of “Married With Children” and Andrew Dice Clay if they’d kept it up, Paul’s Boutique pushed them into a new direction as renaissance men of punchline lyricism. They were still happily at home affecting low-class behaviors: hucking eggs at people on “Egg Man”; going on cross-country crime sprees on “High Plains Drifter”; smackin’ girlies on the booty with something called a “plank bee” in “Car Thief”; claiming to have been “makin’ records when you were suckin’ your mother’s dick” on “3-Minute Rule.” But they’d also mastered quick-witted acrobatic rhymes to augment their countless pop-culture references and adolescent hijinks. “Long distance from my girl and I’m talkin’ on the cellular/She said that she was sorry and I said ‘Yeah, the hell you were’”—we’re a long way from “Cookie Puss” here. While each member has their spotlight moments—MCA’s pedal-down tour de force fast-rap exhibition in “Year and a Day,” Mike D having too much to drink at the Red Lobster on “Mike on the Mic,” and Ad-Rock’s charmingly venomous tirade against coke-snorting Hollywood faux-ingénues in “3-Minute Rule”—Paul's Boutique is where their back-and-forth patter really reached its peak. At the start of their career, they built off the tag-team style popularized by Run-DMC, but by ’89 they'd developed it to such an extent and to such manic, screwball ends that they might as well have been drawing off the Marx Brothers as well. It’s impossible to hear the vast majority of this album as anything other than a locked-tight group effort, with its overlapping lyrics and shouted three-man one-liners, and it’s maybe best displayed in the classic single “Shadrach.” After years of post-Def Jam limbo and attempts to escape out from under the weight of a fratboy parody that got out of hand, they put together a defiant, iconographic statement of purpose that combined giddy braggadocio with weeded-out soul-searching. It’s the tightest highlight on an album full of them, a quick-volleying, line-swapping 100-yard dash capped off with the most confident possible delivery of the line “They tell us what to do? Hell no!” As reissues go, the 20th Anniversary re-release of Paul’s Boutique is relatively bare-bones. There’s a richer, cleaner audio mix remastered by the band, a tracklisting that splits “B-Boy Bouillabaisse” into its separate parts, and a sharp mini-gatefold package highlighting the iconic cover photo. That so little has been changed is more of a relief than a problem; between the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd samples, you’d think the clearance issues would be prohibitive. Just the fact that this album’s being reissued with all this care and attention should be enough. After Paul’s Boutique failed to move units, it wasn’t entirely out of the realm of possibility that the Beasties would wind up like the protagonist of “Johnny Ryall”—with “a platinum voice/But only gold records,” reduced to obscurity while their most ambitious work faded into cutout-bin purgatory. As it turned out, they created an album we’ll probably never hear the likes of again—good thing it’s deep enough to live in forever.","The Beastie Boys’ landmark second album is remastered and reissued 20 years on.

In the House of Mirrors,Hector Zazou & Swara,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25b5e6ef959693203cd/1:1/w_160/d8ea0653.jpg,2009-02-12 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12664-in-the-house-of-mirrors/,Crammed Discs,"French-Algerian composer Hector Zazou, one of the world's most prominent-- and most prolific-- musical synthesizers, died last September. He spent much of the past 30 years crossing border after border and culture with culture, with sometimes striking results. His was the rare name linking disparate Western avant-pop luminaries (such as Björk, Peter Gabriel, David Sylvian, John Cale, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, and many, many more) with a host of similarly diverse fellow composers and performers gathered from around the globe. He often dealt in concept albums, with inspiration drawn from the Arctic, Africa, and all points in between. In the House of Mirrors, released just a few weeks after Zazou's death, features the composer's final fusion, bringing together four primary players from India and Uzbekistan-- Toir Kuziyev on tambur and oud, Milind Raykar on violin, Ronu Majumdar on flute, and Manish Pingle on slide guitar-- to record in Mumbai compositions envisioned as modern updates of Indian classic music. But for a man who loved his concept albums, Zazou here keeps the focus woozy and blurry. It's like a Ry Cooder record by way of Fripp & Eno, all over-lapping notes and drones, the melodies often entrancing but also tantalizingly open-ended and prone to meandering Like similar-minded projects from Cooder (among other well-intentioned culture-vultures) the curiosity factor is one of the primary attractions of In the House of Mirrors, though the link between Uzbekistan and India is less than obvious. The musical traditions of the Central Asia country and the Indian subcontinent may overlap somewhere down the Silk Road, and one way or another the pan-Asian quartet (who call themselves Swara) wound up in Mumbai as eager collaborators. But their roots have less to bear on the results than the way they individually and collectively lend a tactile exoticism to what might have ended up just another mushy of electro-acoustic project à la Bill Laswell. Which isn't to say tracks such as ""Wanna Mako"" don't flirt dangerously with new age, like the aural equivalent of burning incense. Or that the nearly 12-minute ""Darbari (With Soul Without Rules)"" doesn't sound like a film score wandering about in search of some visuals to. But Zazou, like many of his more ambitious fellow travelers, at least understood the importance of discord and darkness to his music, with mystery and ambiguity undercutting the more smoothed over surfaces. Certainly ""Sisyphe"" hums with a spooky sense of dread, while ""Twice as Good as We Are"" mines the collision of jazz, traditional Asian music, and the evocative echo of empty space with results worthy of the best of the ECM label. Taken as a whole, however, Zazou's swan song is ironically hurt by one of its most prominent attributes. Zazou is such a seamless synthesist that he neglected to leave more of those aforementioned rough edges intact. For all its shadowy turns, In the House of Mirrors still remains simply too placid to make the most of its various and varied ingredients. After all, one of the most exciting things about fusion of this sort is the sense of recognition, parsing where all the pieces of the musical puzzle meet and how they may have mutated. In the House of Mirrors, on the other hand, is tour-brochure slick. While the collision of centuries old traditions with contemporary sounds has produced countless curiosities in the past, this particular one is ultimately missing the dirt and feet-on-the-ground grit needed to help it transcend the sterile bounds of the studio and achieve something more affecting rather than merely effective.","The late cross-cultural composer Hector Zazou's final work fuses Indian and Uzbek musicians for a modern update of traditional Indian music.

Interoceans,I Heart Lung,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbc13d197565213b5e5/1:1/w_160/54d169f4.jpg,2009-02-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12663-interoceans/,Asthmatic Kitty,"""Freedom,"" at least when it comes to music, is a loaded word. Theoretically, anyone with a guitar is free to play any way he or she feels like playing. The same holds true for any other instrument, or combinations of instruments. But rare is the act that doesn't sound like the sum of their instrumentation. It's pretty inescapable: no matter what they do, no matter what they try, no matter what they aspire to, a guy with a guitar and a guy playing drums will more often than not sound like guys playing guitars and drums. Where the California duo of Chris Schlarb and Tom Steck find freedom as I Heart Lung is not in their sound, per se, but in flexing the boundaries of all the potential sounds they can make. They shift, they stretch, they bend, they change form, they break rules, all in search of what feels right. And when they find what they're looking for, they move on to the next thing. If that implies restlessness, it shouldn't. I Heart Lung is experimental but still methodic, process music akin to watching the fluffy fractals of storm clouds shift and transform across the sky, or the tide rolling fresh waves in from who knows where, like clockwork but still different every single time. It's no coincidence, then, that I Heart Lung have called their latest opus Interoceans. A four-song suite, of sorts, each long piece boasts an appropriately aquatic subtitle of ""Upwelling"", ""Overturning"", ""Undercurrent"", and ""Outspreading"". The disc aims less for the galvanizing effect of, say, such distant ""free"" predecessors as John Coltrane and Rashid Ali's Interstellar Space than it does for something more pastoral, even oddly blissful. It's also, despite the band's billing, only technically the work of a duo playing without a net. Schlarb and Steck reportedly recorded the disc's basic tracks together, but over the course of several months steadily layered and altered those improvisations with a series of overdubs and studio manipulations, occasionally enlisting ringers such as Nels Cline and trumpeter Kris Tiner to add their respective stamps. While the general flow of the four extended movements clearly stems from improvisation, each is layered with more consciously composed embellishments. The results are a little like an artist switching palates halfway through a painting, reusing the canvas but leaving plenty of the original piece peeking through. It's been said that composition is just very slow improvisation, and Interoceans finds that line being continually blurred. ""Interoceans I (Upwelling),"" for example, begins with a wash of feedback and rolling drums before shifting to folky acoustic strums embellished by what may be nature sounds-- rain, chirping bugs. ""Interoceans II (Overturning)"" features humming, buzzing guitar leads and trumpet over a meditative drone. ""Interoceans III (Undercurrent)"" nods to Asia, a theme continued in ""Interoceans III (Outspreading)"", at least until the feedback returns to redirect the music closer to where the suite started. It's an impressive bit of sleight of hand, pointing the way one direction before pulling you right back to where you came from. But if the journey ends close to where it began, there's still a sense of distance traveled. And when the final notes of the disc's dim cacophony fade to silence, you're pleasantly primed for all the unexplored places this duo has left to go on future trips.","Beginning with a bedrock of improvisation, California duo I Heart Lung transform their spontaneous creations into lengthy composed pieces layered with multiple instruments and sound effects.

Coastlines,Windsurf,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25db1335d7bf16984a4/1:1/w_160/0dd963fc.jpg,2009-02-12 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12666-coastlines/,Internasjonal,"Damn if it didn't rain nearly every day the week Windsurf's Coastlines showed up in my mailbox. I say this reticent to fuel any notion that Pitchfork grades are assigned according to something as random as the weather, or to suggest that certain sounds and constructions are only ""appropriate"" in certain climates. But there they were, Windsurf's resolutely optimistic slow-disco grooves and Coastlines' sunkissed cover art contrasting with the week's slow drizzles. This is where your average glass-half-full Windsurf fan would jump in and say, ""But at least the drizzles were slow,"" punctuating ""slow"" with a swoop of his pointer finger. Fair: Windsurf trade in a laconic, beachside brand of electronic music inexactly referred to as ""Balearic."" Comprised of San Franciscans Dan Judd and Sam Grawe, Windsurf built their presence last year through an EP and remixes for bands like Low Motion Disco and the Tough Alliance, and Coastlines exists partly in thanks to ubiquitous Norwegian Prins Thomas, who released the record on his recently created Internasjonal label. Windsurf create music lighter and less bulbous than that of their peers. Coastlines is seemingly composed of sets of cleanly drawn lines. Listening to ""Moonlightsun"" progress is not unlike watching someone draw with a new pack of thin-line Magic Markers: wires intersect, bold and un-muddied by each other's presence. Percussive echoes are undisturbed by a quickened bassline, which sits idly beside organ patches and an ascending synth line. The first chord change doesn't arrive for nearly two and a half minutes, and when it does it serves as a release valve for any lingering discord, however slight. Even when a track carries on a bit long-- the extremely pleasant ""Future Warriors"" probably doesn't need its full six minutes-- Coastlines' clean, balanced mix is a blessing: training your ear on one of those many weaving lines can unlock new perspectives. Such is the way the synthesizers, drum machines, guitars, and occasionally vocals on Coastlines interact with one another. Windsurf's languorous grooves develop naturally, less a product of exacting composition than carefully cultivated vibes. Instruments and melodies rarely seem out of place, but neither is any individual element essential. The big-sky chords that populate the band's namesake track are almost orchestral in their warmth and breadth, but they don't distract from the track's jaunty snares. The confluence of bass sequencers and hardy synth lines in ""White Soweto"" sound almost like Boards of Canada (to whom Windsurf owe a partial debt for their 1970s seaside sprawl) remixed skyward. The whittling funk of ""Light as Daylight""'s guitars are the home-y side of predictable. The duo might not get a pass on their questionable vocals. ""Light as Daylight"" skates by because its mumble-mouthed couplets exist only during the song's tremulous budding (the moment when the voice drops and the song's hammy, clean-struck piano chords fall is one of Coastlines' most strident). ""Bird of Paradise"", though short, doesn't fare as well, its evenly plucked nylon-string guitar drowned by the singer's mundane drawl. * Coastlines* remains likeable even during the placid, 12-minute fadeout of ""Crystal Neon"", but Windsurf's easy-going stroll does have trouble supporting the album's 70-minute runtime. Some vacations do last too long, etc. Windsurf prove themselves careful guides, however, never letting the relaxed pacing and sonics of Coastlines slacken their careful details. Just try to keep it off of the turntable when the sky goes gray.","After remixes for kindred sprits like Low Motion Disco and the Tough Alliance, San Francisco duo Windsurf bring their brand of clean and chilled-out beachside music to Prins Thomas' Internasjonal label.

Major General,Franz Nicolay,by: Paul Thompson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a263b1335d7bf16984ae/1:1/w_160/03318f04.jpg,2009-02-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12670-major-general/,Fistolo,"We've been in the same room maybe a dozen times now, but I'd never heard Franz Nicolay speak until I saw him play to a half-empty house on a Saturday night a few weeks back. Over the last few years, the wine-swilling, Rollie Fingers-looking keyboardist for the greatest rock'n'roll band going-- that'd be the Hold Steady-- and charter World/Inferno Friendship Society member has proven himself to be his band's not-so-secret weapon. Still, Nicolay manages to largely hide in plain sight where the Hold Steady's concerned, deferring to the outsized stage presence and unmatched lyricism of one Craig Finn. You'll forgive me for dropping this particular bomb on you: Franz is not, as it turns out, the premier songwriter in his more famous coterie. In some ways, it ain't even close-- the competition's stiff, after all-- but on Major General, Nicolay's proper solo debut following a 2007 collection of demos, proves him a surprisingly close second. Eclectic and ambitious but unshowy, Major General is about as satisfying as any solo effort from a member of an established band still killing it themselves as I can think of. If Franz didn't spent most of his nights in the enviable position to the right of Finn and the rest of the Hold Steady, with songs like these it's not hard imagine him having an awfully good go of it on his own. Major General moves a fair piece between the Hüsker Dü-like urgency of opener ""Jeff Penalty"" to the loungey, languid closer ""I'm Done Singing"", hitting mid-1990s alt-rock, tipsy Billy Joel balladry, Sunday afternoon swing, and Eastern European folk-tinged rave-ups along the way. I can't quite tell if ""Jeff Penalty"" is a highlight or the highlight, but it's certainly a winner, spinning a note-perfect yarn of seeing the Jello Biafra-less Dead Kennedys revue. In Nicolay's tale, the crowd reluctantly accepts ""Jeff Whatisname"" and refuses to stop believin'. It's as good a song about navigating aging in the scene-- never selling out, after all, just turns you into the old guy in the room-- as any on the Hold Steady's Stay Positive, and if they were to slip it into a setlist sometime soon, they wouldn't miss a step. From there, Nicolay moves all over the place, heading into the boisterous, almost Tom Waitsian ""Hey Dad!"" to the lovely (if unfortunately titled) ""World/Inferno vs. the End of the Evening"" and the almost operatic stomp of ""Dead Sailors"". The sound largely vacillates between the rockers, the ballads, and the spindly gypsy-folk numbers. Because Nicolay's got some opera in his throat and some unusual stuff in his arrangements, something like Frog Eyes might be the best reference point for these. But however you care to call 'em, they're the most compositionally assured things here, and also the least effective. Nicolay's fondness for unorthodox rock instrumentation-- the guy does play both the banjo and the accordion quite a bit on this set, as he does with ""World/Inferno""-- is nice to hear. But the songs he writes with a lot of pickin' and-a-squeezin' don't hit the gut like the rest, favoring lyrical flights of fancy and big bursts of sound over the acutely rendered observations of the more traditionally rocky stuff here. Apart from those and the relatively slight ""Do We Not Live in Dreams?"", though, Major General hits some massive highs and nary a single crushing low. ""Jeff Penalty"" is a monster and ""Confessions of an Ineffective Casanova"", despite another lousy title, might be even better, finding Nicolay spitting game about a strange relationship over a freewheeling guitar chug that would've fit nicely on a playlist next to the Gin Blossoms and, oh, Sugar. It's just as easy to imagine ""Jeff Penalty"" inspiring the most meta mosh pit ever, as it is to see legions of grown folks raising a glass to the wine-drunk ""End of the Evening"", and Nicolay's skill at playing punk sage on one song and slightly troubled troubadour on the next is really something special. Of course, a record that flirts with this many genres can feel a bit unfocused, and the slight sag to the back half-- and either one too many klezmery tunes or one too few punkers, I can't quite decide-- keeps Major General from feeling like an album rather than a baker's dozen songs in sequence. But if the old adage is true and the first LP really is a lifetime of ideas on wax, Nicolay's laid out an awful lot here. Let's just hope he doesn't feel compelled to say quite so much if he ever gets around to making another one.","The Hold Steady keyboardist and member of the World/Inferno Friendship Society packs a lifetime of ideas into his solo debut, touching on mid-1990s alt-rock, tipsy Billy Joel balladry, Sunday afternoon swing, and Eastern European folk-tinged rave-ups.

Keep It Hid,Dan Auerbach,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a261b1335d7bf16984aa/1:1/w_160/862a992e.jpg,2009-02-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12669-keep-it-hid/,Nonesuch,"Relative to the garage-rock outfits with whom they were compared to in the first part of this decade, the Black Keys have more or less stuck with their thing: austerely nostalgic, drums-and-guitar-in-a-dying-industrial-city blues-rock. Singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney have managed to forge a career and five albums out of variations-on-a-theme riffs and stripped-for-parts grooves, outliving almost all of those peers. They lack the audacity of Jack White (in fact, their blues-rock extends more from Midwestern modesty than from self-aware showboating), and the Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright has a stronger melodic sensibility and more potent lyrical venom. Their limited range, however, stands in inverse proportion to their sturdy longevity, which always seemed built into their conceptual underpinning, as if the sheer quantity of songs legitimizes their Spartan approach. But last year's Attack & Release saw the Black Keys' resolve weakening: Auerbach and Carney collaborated with Danger Mouse and wrangled additional players-- including Jessica Lea Mayfield and Carney's uncle Ralph. That the additions of a high-profile producer and programmed beats only augmented rather than expanded their sound was both a bit comical and strangely commendable. You take the Keys out of their basement studio, but you can't take the basement studio out of the Keys. Now Auerbach has made a solo album, and in retrospect, this turn of events seems inevitable: Ostensibly he wanted to escape even momentarily his band's self-imposed restrictions and give vent to his wildest ideas, like having a bass player. Like Attack & Release, Keep It Hid takes only a few baby steps up the basement stairs. There are plenty of new song shapes and sound textures here, from the softly strummed opener ""Trouble Weighs a Ton"" to the brief din of ""Because I Should"" to the Smithsy guitar on ""Heartbroken, in Disrepair"". A sacred organ drenches ""Real Desire"" like profane sweat, and ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" struts on a Stax rhythm section and a nifty descending melody. ""When the Night Comes"" ends Side 1 on a quiet note, with soft keyboards and piano decorating some of Auerbach's most tender lyrics to date. Side 2 loses some of Side 1's urgency, as ""Mean Monsoon"" and especially ""When I Left the Room"" sound uncharacteristically unfocused. Nothing here, however, would sound at all out of place if ""Black Keys"" were written on the jewel case spine. Whether Auerbach should be criticized or credited for his consistency could be debated, but the approach, the mission, and the music here all sound pretty close to what we've heard before from his day-job band. As a Black Keys album, Keep It Hid sounds less detached and distracted than the Danger Mouse collaboration, but lacks the thickfreak sound of their earliest releases and the sharp songwriting of Rubber Factory. Auerbach has written horndog riffs like ""I Want Some More"" and ""Street Walkin'"" many times before, and neither is the best of his lot. And no offense to the dependable drumming of Bob Cesare, but these songs lack Carney's crafty, unhinged beats, which work overtime to fill in Keys' songs as much as possible. The biggest change here might be Auerbach himself, whose vocals have loosened up somewhat since The Big Come Up in 2002. On ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" and ""My Last Mistake"" he actually sounds indistinguishable from John Fogerty-- and the swampy drumbeat on the latter suggests he's aware of it. Rather than put him at the head of a small studio band like this, one wonders how he would sound either as a player in a more democratic unit (much like White in the Raconteurs) or backed by a pre-existing group like Drive-By Truckers, where he might have to work outside of himself to adapt to a communal sound. As it is, the more Auerbach changes things, the more they stay the same.",,6.2,
All of Us In Our Night,Modern Skirts,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a251b1335d7bf1698481/1:1/w_160/1c9ba0e0.jpg,2009-02-11 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12654-all-of-us-in-our-night/,Self,"The Modern Skirts' 2005 debut, Catalogue of Generous Men, presented them as facile young power-poppers, short on vision or grit but long on effortless melodicism. Cresting on the ""O.C.""-pop wave churned up by the likes of Phantom Planet and Rooney, the Athens, Ga., band's guileless hummability went a long way towards overcoming its lack of originality.
 
The Skirts of 2005 were a tuneful act for sure, though not exactly one you'd take all that seriously, even in their frequent melancholy moments. It seems likely this presumption of mop-toppery got under the band's skin in the intervening years, because its follow-up, All of Us in Our Night, is noticeably darker and less immediately accessible than its predecessor. It's also not as good, falling into the familiar trap of a young band striving for substance and consequently getting in its own way, unnecessarily upping the degree of difficulty and undermining many of the elements that made its music enjoyable in the first place. That's not to suggest these guys became free jazz dadaists overnight or anything, yet many of the more easily abused traits of maturing artistry show up here-- oblique lyrics, a more sober vocal delivery, songs that seem to go in circles rather than a straight line. Too much of the album feels bloodless and hermetic. It starts with ""Chanel"", a worrying laggard of an opener with weird wordless background vocals that sound borrowed from TV on the Radio's cover of Pixies' ""Mr. Grieves"". The sex-and-drugs reverie ""Soft Pedals"" at least has lyrical specificity on its side, icky as those lyrics may be (""You got on top and we both got off again""). Still, it does little to pick up the tempo, which can also be said of the following track, the spaciously puzzling ""Chokehold"".
 
Things don't really get moving until ""Radio Breaks"", and even then this heavily piano-dependent band is only maintaining a roughly Ben Folds-ian pace. ""Face Down"" boasts a nicely rippling riff, but it introduces another tendency that frequently hamstrings sophomore efforts, namely the urge to write about pop life and the road, manifested here in the backhanded plaudit (perhaps self-inflicted), ""you're famous in a small room."" Such tunnel vision seems also to inform ""Coversational"", the Third Eye Blind-ish (not necessarily an insult) ""Eveready"", and especially the Mike Mills-produced ""Motorcade"", with its invocations of money and amphetamines. ""Mrs."" (who ""misses a good thing"") feels like the most intriguing lyrical sketch, but at a slight three minutes that's all it has a chance to be: a sketch.
 
Athens has a proud history of disparate bands-- from R.E.M. to Olivia Tremor Control-- who challenged lyrical and structural conventions in interesting ways while still managing to deliver pleasurable pop. Were the Modern Skirts content to replicate their debut and continue making sad-sweet tunes to soothe the bum trips of Bulldog fratties after watching Matthew Stafford throw another laser-guided interception, they'd already be in fine shape. All of Us seems instead to suggest a desire to transcend this modest scope, which is admirable for sure, though it's also clear the band will need some time to grow into the role.","Athens, Ga., power-poppers follow up 2005's tuneful Catalogue of Generous Men with an album noticeably darker and less immediately accessible than their debut.

At the start of 12""s compilation The Singles, the Brooklyn duo of erstwhile !!! singer/drummer John Pugh and fashion designer Madeline Davy makes more like Free Beer. Downtown no wave takes the L train to Brooklyn dance punk, buys pills instead of that Polish beer, and basement-punk hedonism warps into a studio-funhouse manifesto. Comedown's a doozy, though: remix after interminable remix working buzz into buzzkill and ending up too drunk to screw. Like Jimmy Buffett fans. The Singles' six originals would make for a disconnected night out, and no doubt an energetic live show, but they're a wild ride in headphones. The unpredictable twists and turns-- the Jack Johnson acoustic-guitar shambling at the end of bass-centered ode to excess ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"", or the ear-splitting TV on the Radio soulful-rock futurism of ""Weekend Condition""-- don't leave much to hold onto, but they're varied and relatively fun. Most of the time, though, Free Blood are closer to the dub-chamber of Gang Gang Dance or the rangey punk-funk of Pugh's prior band, getting kinky with the piano-plinking rhythmic clatter of ""Royal Family"" or lost in the layered percussion of ""Parangatang"". Weird contrasts abound: On ""Surf Music"", Pugh and Davy chant ""I'm high"" until it sounds like the name of the Buckeye State. On the suggestively undulating ""Grumpy"", Pugh exclaims, ""Obama!"" Maybe Ludacris knows what it all means. The five remixes drag out Free Blood's free-loving freakout without boosting the booty-shaking factor; it's as if The Singles is taking the new President's ""set aside childish things"" and getting stultifyingly adult with it. ""I'm not playing silly games,"" Pugh sings on ""Quick and Painful"", still a nice bacchanalian pastiche, but the Hot Chip remix is painfully absent here. Barfly's ""Surf Music"" remix separates out the instruments and emphasizes a bit of a rock feel with a bass hook that's part the Troggs' ""Wild Thing"" and part the Breeders' ""Cannonball"". Scotty Coats and Wes the Mes recognize the expressiveness of Pugh's ""Weekend Condition"" vocal, then make a screechy version of Jose Feliciano's ""Light My Fire"" with it. Brothers' ""Royal Family"" revamp fares best, frosting militaristic house beats with radioactive synths; ""Grumpy (Greg Wilson Version)"" is serviceable but sleepy space-disco, and ""Parangatang (Tim 'Love' Lee Mix)"" sounds like your alarm clock or the guy jackhammering outside. Party too long and it gets tedious (I'm told!). Wake up and it gets worse.","This Brooklyn duo-- which counts !!! singer/ drummer John Pugh as one of its members-- hit and miss on this collection of their six singles.

Dissolver,Iran,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a257ea9e61561daa4a02/1:1/w_160/df187f4c.jpg,2009-02-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12659-dissolver/,Narnack,"We all know the popular adage about lo-fi musicians-- they're more than just tape hiss, background noises, sloppy playing, etc. Real honest-to-goodness songwriting lies under that mess, and they could record a conventional pop/rock album if they really wanted to. While the cleanlier output of groups like Guided by Voices, Pavement, and Sebadoh lend credence to this belief, I hesitate to greet a spiffed-up Iran album with open arms. With two arcane, challenging, and beautiful albums released in the beginning of the decade, the San Francisco trio reveled in its enigma status, aided by a spectral production (or lack thereof) that rendered many riffs and melodies indecipherable, let alone lyrics. Nearly seven years after the stunning The Moon Boys, Dissolver's first surprise is the crisp, direct songwriting chops of frontman Aaron Aites. With an assist from TV on the Radio guitarist Kyp Malone, Aites trades cloak-and-dagger garbling for fist-pumping ""come on's"" and ""woo-hoo's,"" cutting a straight up guitar album indebted to bowl cuts and flannel. On twangy opener ""I Can See the Future"" we find Aites' vocals still slouching, but their clarity recalls David Berman or, as one Pitchfork staffer noted, one of Ween's drawling indie rock parodies. For better or worse, Iran's adopted a meaty rock swagger at the cost of their mystique, and they're not looking back. For all the ballyhoo surrounding Malone's contributions and fellow TVOTR member Dave Sitek's co-production credit, the true highlights occur when Aites' hooks are at their sharpest, and he often struggles to integrate the hi-tech gadgets into his material. A couple of tracks-- most notably the sprawling ""Airport '79""-- smother ho-hum folk ditties with space-age guitar effects and busy overdubs, seemingly to make Iran compatible with 00s indie 2.0. The window dressing's most egregious on ambient instrumental ""Digital Clock and Phone"", a nod to Iran's tUMULt-era sound collages that's plopped between the album's tidy, organized songs. Not surprisingly, ""Where I'm Going"" and ""Can I Feel What?"", two brooding ballads with distorted vocals, stand out. Nicely layered guitars do the heavy lifting, allowing Aites' pretty melodies to remain as stubbornly low-key as on past highlights ""Four-Armed Star"" or ""Fading Out"". While it's gutsy stepping out from behind the lo-fi curtain, you have to wonder to what extent Iran considers Dissolver their coming-out party. Alongside the signature slacker pathos there's a faint yearning for bombast, whether in the ""Buddy"" reprise (replete with stadium cheers and a drunken howl of a performance by Aites) or the power pop escapism of stompers like ""Evil Summer"". Yet the album's also bogged down by too much garden variety bar rock that's obliquely produced to masquerade as forward-thinking indie. It's certainly not an infuriating or even annoying direction for the band to go-- and considering their obscurity I can't imagine hoards of people up in arms over Dissolver-- but Iran's M.O. has pulled a complete 180. Once producing dense, complex music that rewards each additional listen, Dissolver's content as comfort food for rockists, too quickly sating the listener.","After two arcane, challenging, and beautiful albums released in the beginning of the decade, this San Francisco trio reveled in their enigma status for years. Now they're back with the cleaner, leaner Dissolver. TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone and Dave Sitek help out.

Odessa,Bee Gees,by: Bob Stanley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25213d1975652138844/1:1/w_160/e34c08cd.jpg,2009-02-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12655-odessa/,PolydorPolydor,"Less than two years after leaving Australia and scoring their first Anglo-American hit, ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"", the Bee Gees had matured to the point where they they had the confidence to write neo-classical instrumentals with titles like ""Seven Seas Symphony"" and ""With All Nations (International Anthem)"". In 1969, while others were paring back and amping up, the Gibb brothers were building a wall of sound that owed more to Edward Elgar than Phil Spector, let alone Muddy Waters. Odessa was the sprawling result, a 2xLP in a luxuriant red velour sleeve-- there was no doubt this was an Important Statement from a group considered, up to this point, to be purveyors of sweet, harmless orch-pop. Barry Gibb was a pin-up and, as far as the serious press was concerned that slotted these guys alongside the Monkees. It meant little that ""I've Gotta Get a Message to You"" (a UK No.1 from the previous year) was about a convicted killer's dying request, or that their first three albums had featured thrilling psychedelic pop that trumped since-fetishized British acts like July or Blossom Toes. The only hit single on Odessa was ""First of May"", a ballad that goes for world-weary significance (""Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by/ Someone else moved in from far away"") without making much sense-- this is a recurring Bee Gees lyrical trait, and an endearing one. ""First"" also boasted a melancholy music box arrangement and one of Barry Gibb's more sonorous croons. It is extremely pretty. It also caused a rupture in the group that would lead them to split up for the better part of two years. When Barry's ""First of May"" consigned Robin's ""Lamplight"" to the B-side, the festering jealousy between the brothers was made very public. Robin quit, made one odd solo album (Robin's Reign), and an even odder unreleased one (Sing Slowly Sisters) before the three were reconciled at the end of 1970. ""Lamplight"" doesn't sound like a hit, truthfully. No matter. From its heavily thrummed acoustic intro and unintelligible echo-ridden opening verse to the massed harps and a storyline that alludes to lost love and candlelit Victoriana, it seems Robin is unsure of what he wants to say, yet knows exactly how to say it: loudly and tearfully. You get the feeling he wished he'd been born 50 years earlier. Both songs are ambitious, then, but you can understand the younger brother's pique. Rubbing salt into Robin's wounds, the title track had been given a catalogue number but was withdrawn in favor of ""First of May"". This would have been a brave and extraordinary single, the kind-- like ""Good Vibrations"" or ""Left to My Own Devices""-- that can prove almost impossible to follow. ""Odessa (City on the Black Sea)"" is about the sinking of the (fictitious) ship Veronica on Valentines Day, 1899. Over nearly eight minutes, it takes the form of a letter written by a shipwrecked sailor to his sweetheart, and careers between surreal music-hall observations (""You love the vicar more than words can say""), Flamenco flourishes, and the most dolorous, vast chords; on the final chorus Robin Gibb is reduced to a wordless wail that sounds rather a lot like the baring of his soul. It seems cheap to claim a single album would have doubled Odessa's strength, but nevertheless there are a clutch of weaker tracks, some of which include lyrics that sound tetchy and petulant (""You'll Never See My Face Again"", the draggy ""I Laugh in Your Face"") when you know the familial back story. None of them is ""How Do You Sleep?"". Still, you'd miss Barry's straighter pop cuts (the sunny ""Melody Fair"", a No. 1 single in Japan, the oboe-led ""Suddenly"") if Robin had got everything his own way. This reissued edition expands the release even further. Both the mono and stereo mixes are included, along with a bunch of intriguing demos (a rough version of ""Odessa"" itself with a cod-American spoken intro, a vocal version of the comically pompous ""With All Nations"") and the previously unheard ""Nobody's Someone"", a real gem that anticipates the early-1970s country-soul direction of ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"". It seems that the flock sleeve and the fact it's a double has-- as the group doubtless intended in 1969-- led critics to lend Odessa a status some way above the other Bee Gees albums of the period. If it kept up the level of intensity on the title track, ""Lamplight"", and ""Black Diamond"" (another high-seas adventure of a song) it would merit the legend. As it is, Odessa is a feast that's hard to fault for ambition but too rich and occasionally too stodgy to take in one sitting.","Rhino's 3xCD reissue of the Bee Gees' ornate and ambitious 1969 album includes mono and stereo mixes and an extra disc of demos and previously unreleased tracks.

"It's Not Me, It's You",Lily Allen,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25aea9e61561daa4a0c/1:1/w_160/0779a43c.jpg,2009-02-11 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12662-its-not-me-its-you/,Capitol,"""I might not write a very good second album. The thing to do is not take yourself so seriously. The moment when you sort of start to believe all that stuff is when you get in trouble."" That's Lily Allen talking to this website in November 2006. At that point, her MySpace clarion of a debut, Alright, Still, was four months into what would become a 17-month stint on the UK's album chart. With her bluntly nonchalant, blog-like songwriting about dudes with small dicks, breezy beats worthy of a terrible Ska-lright, Still joke, and link-happy marketing campaign from the web up, Allen offered the music industry a way forward if not fiscally, at least artistically. She was the New Pop Star-- slight voice, bawdy, prom dress 'n' trainers, self-sufficient. The Anti-Idol. ""Refreshing"" followed her; ""candid"" was her friend. And, more than anything, Lily Allen was funny, excelling in the droll British humor of someone who had sold drugs in Ibiza at age 15 and realized the absurdity of a 15-year-old selling drugs in Ibiza. So it seems odd for this chart guerrilla to fall into so many trad-pop trappings on sophomore album It's Not Me, It's You. There's the sound: Alright, Still's hissy, homey samples are booted for decidedly more streamlined and schizophrenic backdrops. The voice: Allen's conversational and unpredictable flow is replaced with broad, upfront lines. The words: Since she's the story day after day now, the singer's journalistic wisecracks have turned inward-- and this time Lily's taking on biggies like religion, family strife, and drug abuse. The publicity: photo shoots for every wheezing print mag left, including brooding black and whites for Interview and Blender. She's taking herself a bit more seriously, in other words. It's troublesome. But there is such a thing as good trouble. The push-pull between Lily's sober side and the side that slurred about how she'd ""still fuck"" 82-year-old Tony Bennett at an awards show last year can make for some appealing and slippery social commentary. Take first single ""The Fear"", part admission, part brag, part apocalyptic vision. ""I want to be rich and I want lots of money/ I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny,"" she starts, ""I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds/ I heard people die while they're trying to find them."" For almost any other artist, the lines would be barbed, sarcastic, and, ultimately, uppity and bland indictments. But not for the loudmouth who recently told Spin about how she hopes to marry a multi-millionaire and admitted to The New York Times that she spent $143,000 on clothes and jewelry in 2008 alone. She's part of the problem and is plagued by an overwhelming sense of collapse; she has her cake, throws it around the restored dining room and then feels a tinge of panic while observing the mess. This is perceptive pop for a consumer culture OD'ing on consumer culture and Houdini investments. ""I don't know what's right and what's real anymore,"" she confesses, sounding like the world's loneliest Real World alum. When she turns her nose up at easy targets-- W., faith, hypocritical druggies-- this typically beyond-her-years 23-year-old can seem naïve. Futuristic Justice-meets-Care Bears synths flit by as Allen condemns cracked-out teens and their prescription parents on ""Everyone's At It"", but such revelations come off about as insightful as one of those ""but Dad, I learned it from you"" PSA's. Righty-baiting ""Fuck You"" utilizes ""Sesame Street"" piano plinks to serve its too-goofy hook-- and makes it clear just how easily Allen's winsome brattiness can turn into grating novelty. In her Spin cover story, she talked about her penchant for older men, complaining how 25-year-olds ""think they know everything and they're just fucking idiots."" Given songs like ""Fuck You""-- and considering her usually savvy self-awareness-- the quote is particularly unfortunate. Aside from a couple Alright, Still-type kiss-offs-- the quotable country lark ""Not Fair"" about an underwhelming bedmate and oom-pah circus lark ""Never Gonna Happen""-- Sincere Lily takes grip on the rest of the LP. Family-minded tracks ""Back to the Start"" and ""He Wasn't There"" attempt (and fail) to hide rote therapy maxims behind maddening electro and faux-jazz, respectively. Britney/Kylie/Nelly producer Greg Kurstin works like a radio-ready Jon Brion, tossing out disparate styles with ease, but the stunt arrangements sometimes sound entirely divorced from Lily's accompanying sentiments. But form meets function well on two mid-tempo love songs, ""I Could Say"" and especially ""Who'd Have Known"". An airy, angst-less rewrite of Kelly Clarkson's ""Since U Been Gone"", ""I Could Say"" is snarkless and lovely-- Kid Icarus theme music via bulletproof Europop. ""Who'd Have Known"" is prime Lily 2.0, growing up without the heavy-handed, 2D ""maturity""; it's a knowing ode to early love and all the uncertainty, excitement and irrationality that goes along with it. ""I don't have anything that I'm really passionate about. Maybe I just haven't found what it is yet. But it's not music, which is a shame, because it would be good if it was."" That's Lily Allen talking to the New York Times last week. After the quick-hit success of her offhand debut, such a blasé attitude toward international success would be understandable, if a bit nuts. But, given the more considered It's Not Me, It's You, the quote comes off more like hedging; there will always be someone for vultures to photograph, but she's wise enough to know it might not always be her. Even if the new album can be cheaply on-the-nose and opportunistic at times, it's hard to root against Lily Allen. Her plight-- bare, self-conscious, petty, fearful-- is familiar.

Come With Me If You Want to Live,Goblin Cock,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a256ea9e61561daa49fd/1:1/w_160/0e85aa5d.jpg,2009-02-10 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12658-come-with-me-if-you-want-to-live/,Robcore,"Well, this has officially gone on longer than anyone expected. As a lovingly silly metal side project from Rob Crow (Pinback, Heavy Vegetable), Goblin Cock's first record had had a certain air of expectation: If you were going to put the offending titular member on the front cover of your record (pierced and poking out from the robes of a magisterial goblin), you had to deliver something that sounds like metal. On that end, Crow and co. acquitted themselves with fervor, but it was a novelty in any sense of the term. Now, because no one asked for it, they're back with a second record, and the cover isn't even dirty. This time there's nothing left to do but write songs, and the ones on Come With Me If You Want to Live seem more likely to be played more than once. To those who are concerned about false, dilettantish, or ""hipster"" metal, know that there are many things Goblin Cock are not: punishing, uncompromising, extreme, dour, and most of all, hip. But they are often a lot of fun. There's less metal posturing here than before, and the songs have taken on a slower and sludgier bent. Much like Crow's other projects, there are numerous little melodies, counter-rhythms, and unexpected earworms tucked into the songs. With Goblin Cock, gleeful boneheadedness meets melodic restlessness. ""We Got a Bleeder"" should gain steam from the relentless repetition of its one-note chug, but Crow can't help but have the song fold back on itself with a vocal harmony. Thundering bass lays out a melodic anchor to the slow churn of ""Big Up Your Willies"", which closes with a glassy, alien instrument tapping out new rhythms, all while Crow sings ""raise our willies high up"" on the key-changing chorus (if I've deciphered the lyric sheet correctly; it's written in runes). As the riffs get slower and the guitar tone soggier, some of it starts to sound more grunge than metal, like the marble-mouthed vocals on the sludge-pop of ""Loch"" or the languid low-end riff and disaffected singing of ""Haint"". And of course, some of it sounds a lot like Pinback, but less fussy and with more palm-muted rapid downstrokes and more general swagger, none of which is really a bad thing. Slow, melodic riffs and pristine harmonies dominate ""Ode to Billy Jack"", and in place of the joke-metal filler from the first record, we get tracks like ""Tom's Song (T.O.F.)"", a double-tracked duel between acoustic and electric guitar, with a slow-burning chorus and clean, concise hook. If the record seems like a bit of an anachronism, maybe it's not just the cover art or the hopelessly outdated reference of the title. You're more likely to see a metal band sporting a grin than many indie acts with guitars these days, and there used to be bands that had a sense of humor without being a joke themselves. Now, we just have side projects called Goblin Cock, and I'm kind of glad we do-- Come With Me... delivers self-aware smiles as well as unabashed, unashamed medium metal. What more were you looking for?","Pinback's Rob Crow is still pressing on with his lovingly silly metal side project; it's now moved beyond the novelty stage-- as the improved songwriting shows.

7 Trx + Intermission,D. Lissvik,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a250ea9e61561daa49ec/1:1/w_160/eee974ab.jpeg,2009-02-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/,Information,"Despite running a label called Information, spaced-out duo Studio are among the most mysterious of Gothenburg, Sweden's recent up-and-comers. An enigmatic bunch, all: Jens Lekman signs off one of his best songs ""yours truly,"" but he's an entertainer pure and gifted enough to make fictions ring true when he ""reconstructs and remodels the past."" The Tough Alliance named their label Sincerely Yours, but they're as apt to hear sincerity in a Paris Hilton single as in a cult classic. What's more, both ""Information"" and ""Sincerely Yours"" turn out to be the titles of tunes by fellow Gothenburg pop impresarios the Embassy... who have shared a label with each of the aforementioned Swedes, at least at some point. What these musically broad-ranging townsfolk have in common are 1) Unpolished vocals of the Bernard Sumner/Shaun Ryder school, and 2) An interest in the freedom of expression supposedly allowed by indie rock, only 3) Without indie's other typical, readily cooptable aesthetic conventions. So Lekman croons romantically over easy-listening samples, while Sincerely Yours signee Joel Alme bangs the piano to within an inch of Billy Joel's life. For their part, Studio split time between mesmerizing instrumentals and emotive new-wave pop. Their story so far has been one of addition, building from early 7""s and EPs to two 2006 vinyl-only releases and, finally, full-fledged 2007 debut CD Yearbook 1; last year's remix-based Yearbook 2 added outside singers' vocals. Studio half Dan Lissvik also produced the latest Embassy single, irie Peter Bjorn and John-esque pop gem ""State '08"". Lissvik goes without bandmate Rasmus Hägg on 7 Trx + Intermission, unveiled amid little fanfare last November. If less isn't quite more here, it's often still enough. Despite the name, 7 Trx + Intermission has nine tracks, titled only by number and spread out over almost 45 minutes. Studio ""half"" was right: Gone are the synths, vocals, and most of the Spanish guitar flourishes. Instead, Lissvik's electric guitar rambles across Mideast-at-midnight dune-grooves. Joining the usual Nordic mix of krautrock repetition and Vini Reilly's resplendent lyricism is every percussion instrument that ever clattered-- bongos, castanets, the clock from ""60 Minutes"". Those rich bass sounds unifying Studio's proper albums are back, reverberating across the syncopated spaces at tempos just too slow for dancing. Remember ""Regulate"" with Warren G? On track seven (aka ""B3"" if you're spinning vinyl), birds squawk over a groove that's almost its drowsy, staccato cousin. As a set of cerebral Arabian Nights bedroom jams, Aladdin to 2007's The Lion King, 7 Trx + Intermission works best when it stretches out. Listeners should probably do the same. You don't need a hookah to enjoy the dune-whistling woodwinds on track five or the undulating reverbations on track six, but I imagine it would help. At nearly 11 minutes, the third track's neatly interwoven guitars have plenty of room to turn hazily distorted, the meditative poolside listen you never thought you'd need in January. If 7 Trx + Intermission eventually starts to blur together and wear me down on focused, repeat listens more than Studio's celestial drifts ever do, that's probably to be expected from an album more about surreptitiously effecting a certain mental state than keeping us glued to the edge of our seats. One of the original English meanings for ""information""? Giving form or shape to the mind.","One half of Balearic revivalists Studio, D. Lissvik dismissed his group's synths and vocals here to focus primarily on the electric guitar.

"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Bobby Dee Bobby Dee",Benjy Ferree,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a258b1335d7bf1698496/1:1/w_160/5d4ec89e.jpg,2009-02-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12660-come-back-to-the-five-and-dime-bobby-dee-bobby-dee/,Domino,"Surveys suggest that the greatest fear in life is that one will die alone. A concern this monumental makes even the glut of books and albums about death seem paltry. So while maybe ""welcome"" isn't the right word, Benjy Ferree's second album, Come Back to the Five and Dime, Bobby Dee Bobby Dee, which is about the tragic life and lonely death of Disney child actor Bobby Driscoll, mines an inexhaustible subject. His album serves as a tribute to the child star, as well as a meditation on youth, fame, and death. But Driscoll's story never fully transitions into the realm of universalizable metaphor. The way Ferree approaches his life, from personal relationships, to Disney ephemera and 1950s doom, is slightly overwhelming, but it never quite passes beyond the specific constraints of its story. It's hard to see yourself in Driscoll's story, or to live inside these songs. You can't even die in them. Driscoll's story plucks at the heartstrings, for sure. He acted and did voices for several Disney hits, starring in films like Song of the South, Pecos Bill, and Treasure Island. He voiced Peter Pan in the 1953 animated Disney production. Then Driscoll grew up, and, after a bad case of acne, was dropped from his Disney contract. The subsequent details of his life are bizarre and heartbreaking: he went on to do bit parts on network TV dramas, got married as a teenager, had three kids, got addicted to heroin, went to jail, got paroled, moved to New York, became part of Warhol's factory, became disillusioned, and finally disappeared. When his mother came looking for him she found out he had died 19 months earlier of a drug-related heart attack in an East Village tenement. He was buried in a mass grave in a New York's potter's field on Hart Island. Ferree's obsession with Peter Pan led him to Driscoll's story. It's thematic gold: the child who played Peter Pan grew up and lost his innocence, was manipulated by both Hollywood and the avant-garde, and died alone. Ferree trades in whistles, four-part harmonies, falsetto, and big guitars. His music is quirky, drawing from both Americana and British rock: doo-wop and folk next to Queen bombast and blues stomp. In that sense he's come into his own with Bobby Dee; the sinister side of Disney's glee machine sits well with Ferree's dark cheer. That makes songs like ""Fear"", a doo-wop ballad where Ferree harmonizes beautifully on lines like ""When a mailman wears a mask and brings a ticking box"" and ""it pours blood into every dream,"" worth listening to. He lets children take over the ""yeah yeahs"" on the chorus of ""Blown Out (Gold Doubloons and Pcs of 8)"", as if the contrast of eternal youth and eternal death wasn't explicit enough. Driscoll's story isn't vague inspiration. Ferree uses specific names, places, and references throughout. ""What Would Pecos Do?"", for example, references the Pecos Bill character. If you watched the movie a ton, you'll recognize pieces from its story in lines like ""Drink up all the water/ What was a lake is now a crater."" If you didn't, then you're kind of screwed here. Three years ago Ferree released his debut album, Leaving the Nest. Bobby Dee is a better record in many ways: Ferree obviously loves his source material, and the way he weaves in the references throughout is ingenious. But something about the pleasure he takes in his obsession cloisters it away - he can't quite make his subject matter in a way that transcends Bobby Driscoll's life and death. His interest in and empathy for Driscoll means he could give a shit about yours. This is Driscoll's and Ferree's album. ""This is my memory/ Yet it's your eyes that swell"" Ferree sings on ""Pisstopher Chrisstopher."" We're not that ""you.""","Singer-songwriter's second album veers from doo-wop and folk to Queen bombast to tell the story of the tragic life and lonely death of Disney child actor Bobby Driscoll.

To Willie,Phosphorescent,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25313d1975652138849/1:1/w_160/6ab29f1c.jpg,2009-02-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12656-to-willie/,Dead Oceans,"What could be a better cred-building exercise for a young indie-folk songwriter than to cover the works of Willie Nelson? Yet Matthew Houck, aka Phosphorescent, isn't interested merely in demonstrating the depths of his scholarship and reverence for the forerunners of his craft with his all-covers tribute to the Red Headed Stranger, To Willie. He wants, as Hot Chip might put it, to half nelson full nelson Willie Nelson, to wrestle intimately with the man's songs and what they're capable of communicating. In doing so, Houck proves himself an adept interpreter of Willie's piercing Christian grace, while indirectly revealing by the limitations of his scope-- the true remarkable human breadth of Nelson's artistry. Houck does a couple of things extremely well, and to his immense credit he spends most of To Willie working in those veins. As he's demonstrated over the course of Phosphorescent's three very fine LPs of original songs, Houck is a master at conveying weariness, desolation, and spiritual hunger, often through a cracked, warbling bleat. That open-throated yelp is absent here, but Houck's keen understanding of fallenness and deliverance suffuses almost all of the album's best efforts. The opening ""Reasons to Quit"" is an addict's lament Nelson recorded as a duet with Merle Haggard (and was penned by Hag, actually), and while the original may have flashed a perverse resilience towards self-destructive behavior, Houck burrows into the numbing futility contained in a line like ""coke and booze don't do me like before."" It's followed, powerfully, by ""Too Sick to Pray"", an overlooked gem from Nelson's 1996 album Spirit that epitomizes spiritual exhaustion, with Houck sadly and perfectly putting across its overwhelming loneliness. Likewise, on ""It's Not Supposed to Be That Way"", desperation again cracks all of Houck's surfaces, his tremulous uncertainty echoed in the out-of-tune-sounding guitars. The music of the church has informed Houck's own work for some time, and at his best here he treats Nelson's songs like precious, fragile hymns. ""Walkin',"" ""The Party's Over"", and ""Can I Sleep In Your Arms"" are all undergirded with solemnity, with the third a revelation. It might sound like heresy considering Red Headed Stranger's ""Can I Sleep"" is perhaps the most revered song of the collection, yet Houck arguably improves it, adding a heartbreakingly delicate lilt to the end of each verse's penultimate line that wasn't there before. Talented and sympathetic though he may be, Houck is still working with a far more muted palette than Nelson, a fact most evident when he tackles jauntier, more clever material like ""I Gotta Get Drunk"", ""Pick Up the Tempo"", and ""The Last Thing I Needed (First Thing This Morning)"". Certainly it's admirable Houck didn't just pick 11 of Willie's most woebegone efforts to best suit his own forlorn MO, yet it's plain he lacks the wry humor and restless humanity of his interpretive object. Houck's impressive effort nonetheless inevitably sends you back to Nelson's originals, only illuminating their brilliance-- the sly threat of ""It's Not Supposed to Be That Way""; the proud, tight-lipped terseness of ""Too Sick to Pray""; the bitter wisdom of ""Permanently Lonely"" (which Houck does a nice job recontextualizing with spacey, narcotized synths). And, of course, there's Nelson's comic facility, which often cloaked his most devastating revelations, like how the accumulation of everyday bullshit on ""The Last Thing"" (""I opened the door on my knee"") gives way to overwhelming loss and grief. It's simply more proof that Nelson's matchless command of so many song styles and emotional states poses a daunting challenge to any presumptive handler of his canon. Houck still deserves plenty of plaudits for nailing the ones he knows.","Matthew Houck, aka Phosphorescent, follows three fine LPs of original songs with a tribute to the Red Headed Stranger, Willie Nelson.

Factory Records: Communications 1978-92,Various Artists,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2599d034d5c69bf2b98/1:1/w_160/547d8f52.jpg,2009-02-10 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12661-factory-records-communications-1978-92/,Rhino,"Four CDs covering 15 years in roughly chronological order: Communications 1978-92 has the difficult task of summarizing a famously wayward label. As you might expect, it can't do the job painlessly. Factory's magnificent, quixotic approach to branding-- catalogue numbers for buildings! Record sleeves that lost money on every purchase!-- helped build its legend, but also acted as a smokescreen for its erratic quality control. Almost every label makes duff signings, but Factory's were somehow excusable because of the mystique surrounding the organization-- founder Tony Wilson's charm, patter, and heroic whim giving the impression that allowing Crispy Ambulance to make awful records was part of the grand plan as surely as the menstrual egg-timer (FAC 8) was. Take away the aura the label cultivated, and a lot of the music on the box set feels awkwardly exposed. What saves it is Factory's uniquely local quality. Born out of Wilson's enthusiasm for the Manchester arts beat he covered for a regional TV show, Factory had a close relationship with the city's music scene from the start, which became positively symbiotic when the label opened a club there. ""The Haçienda must be built"" was the situationist slogan that gave the venue its name: ""The Haçienda must be filled"" was the more pragmatic principle guiding much of the Factory aesthetic from the second disc of this box set onwards. The club provides one (literally) concrete reason for Factory's status as the UK indie label that engaged first and fiercest with dance music, and tracks here from Quando Quango's bubbly ""Genius"" to Happy Mondays' threatening ""Hallelujah"" were designed for its dancefloors. And though the Haçienda never funded Factory, its legal and financial struggles amid the decline into violence of Manchester's club scene formed one backdrop for the label's collapse. Being the center of a local scene has a big impact on the kind of bands a label works with. If you're a Manchester group in 1979 and you idolize Joy Division, who are you going to send your demo tapes to? Wilson may have been the presiding artistic spirit at Factory, but the musical agenda was set by whichever band was making the running and the headlines in the city-- Joy Division, then New Order, then Happy Mondays. Not only is each group well represented on this box set, so are several acts who sound roughly like them. This has the unfortunate effect that the most famous music here is almost by definition the best. Luckily, each formula was rich enough to allow a few kinks, and time has often been kind to acts who were crucified as copyists in their day. Tunnel Vision's ""Watching the Hydroplanes"", a rant against 1950s Britain and its legacy set to monotonous hand-me-down post-punk, received across-the-board pans back in 1981: Free of that context you can better appreciate its odd, venomous intensity. There's also a sense in which the most generic, trend-chasing music can be more sharply evocative of a time and place than its innovators are-- the clumsy, defiant lilt of Northside's ""Take 5"" tells you more about British indie's response to dance music than the Mondays' far superior ""Kinky Afro"". So by telling a story, Communications manages to make its mediocre tracks more interesting than they actually are. Luckily, there's also plenty of purely musical intrigue. The songs you already know are great sound greater still in the context of what they inspired, and there's also fun to be had tracing the careers of Factory stalwarts like A Certain Ratio from the primitive gloom of ""All Night Party"" through the rippling unease of ""Knife Slits Water"" and ""Flight"" to the slick, stiff funk they ended up playing (their whistles-and-tracksuits Latin dance incarnation is mercifully absent). More than this, the label's parade of non-hits and fleeting pleasures brings out a few gems. It's hard not to like John Dowie's comical ""It's Hard to Be an Egg"", especially coming in the midst of the grey-raincoated first disc. OMD and James appear in early, rough-draft versions-- bands working in very different styles, but both giddy with ideas they're not quite up to realizing yet. Miaow's ""When it All Comes Down"" is a delicious piece of tweepop, Marcel King's ""Reach for Love"" is yearning digital soul, and Cath Carroll's elegant ""Moves Like You"" had the misfortune to be cool and thoughtful at a time when what the press wanted from Factory was libidinous lads. And through it all runs the beat. ""Blue Monday"" and the Happy Monday's ""W.F.L."" may have kickstarted different phases of the label's relationship with dance music, but Factory was always ahead of the pack when it came to exploring the possibilities of space and groove: Martin Hannett's experiments in rhythm and dread helping set an agenda that the label never backed away from. Tony Wilson's death in 2007 makes it tempting to view this box set as a testament to one man's vision, ear, and dreadful business sense, and it's true that you'd probably have to be Tony Wilson to enjoy everything here. But what Factory achieved was greater than that-- it helped build a city's idea of itself, and, in the wider community of British independent music, it kept the door open for eclecticism and idealism. The strength of this set is that you can hear that in the bad stuff as well as the good.","This 4xCD box set covering 15 years of music from Manchester's legendary Factory imprint-- Joy Division, New Order, OMD, A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, and many more are represented-- has the difficult task of summarizing a famously wayward label.

In the City,Kevin Rudolf,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07013d19756521383a8/1:1/w_160/0aa8cab4.jpg,2009-02-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12649-in-the-city/,Cash Money,"We'll likely see dozens of real name, no-gimmicks singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist ""triple threats"" make their debuts this year, but I seriously doubt any are packing the kind of C.V. boasted by Kevin Rudolf. After spending the past five years laying down riffs on hits by Lil' Kim, Nelly Furtado, and Black Eyed Peas, he now has a legit radio staple of his own in ""Let It Rock"". He's got the kind of connections that can land laudatory guest spots from Lil' Wayne, Nas, and Rick Ross. By an ungodly measure, he's already the best guitarist that will ever be signed to his record label. While this might initially read like a welcome relief amidst working the conveyor belt of crusty dudes with a bedraggled acoustic and Bon Iver champagne wishes, none of the above matters because In the City envisions an alternate dystopia of rock music where Rudolf's Kurt Cobain, Shop Boyz are the Pixies, and I suppose N.E.R.D. are the Beatles. But whereas ""Party Like a Rockstar"" was t-t-t-totally aware of its oncoming obsolescence, In the City is proof that you can co-opt the most retarded aspects of 80s corporate rock and still not be any fun. Or maybe Andrew W.K. and the Darkness made it look too easy-- Rudolf instead honors everything synthetic and awful about his two homebases (Miami and New York) by consolidating Jani Lane's cherry-poppin' misogyny, Jon Bon Jovi's bleached-out street tales (first lines: ""Every day I'm a star in the city/ Walk the streets like a wanted man""), and Jefferson Starship's staunch belief in the redemptive power of rawk in the face of urban decay. As expected from a rock record released on Ca$h Money, this the kind of thing you might hear in a body spray ad-- there is little indication it was constructed by real people in real time. Then again, considering ""No Way Out"" is an honest-to-god Wizard of Oz metaphor writ large, I can't imagine Rudolf himself is familiar with a lot of rock music. I will admit that undersells Rudolf's range a bit: In the City spans dead ringers for that acoustic Incubus song to tracks that could soundtrack the montage where the picked-on kid finally preps to push it to the limit with Billy Zabka (""Welcome To The World""). And then...Rick Ross shows up to Leon Lett all over a beat that's about 30 bpms faster than anything he should rap on. It's best to fast forward to just about any other point on the record, where chances are that Rudolf is going on about the City and its many Lights. Paul Banks can no longer boast the most lyrically awkward song called ""NYC"", not after Rudolf boasts a cynicism that far outstrips his celebrity: ""In the city of dreams/ You get caught in the schemes/ And fall apart in the seams."" And then Nas manages to namedrop Mayor Bloomberg and Scatman Crothers, which admittedly is sort of surprising to hear outside the context of an MF Doom record. Look, it's no secret that rappers have pretty suspect taste in rock music: John Mayer, just about any of the source material for Diplomatic Immunity, Kanye including Lenny Kravitz in any discussion of Prince and Hendrix. Which means In the City makes a lot of sense, existing in some sort of triangulation of these coordinates and somehow missing all consumer markets outside the most stubborn poptimists and/or Ca$h Money completists who didn't give up after Turk's Young & Thuggin. Judging from what we've heard in his rock forays thus far, Lil' Wayne thinks In the City is the shit (or maybe his kids do), and in these days you could probably find less compelling reasons to rush a record out into the public.  But just in case you're taking a half-full approach to Rebirth, you might want to hear this first.","Ca$h Money release a rock album; not surprisingly it sounds like N.E.R.D. or a body spray commercial.

"Yes, I Smoke Crack EP / Water EP",Salem,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a073c0084474cd0bfba0/1:1/w_160/f9369000.jpg,2009-02-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12650-yes-i-smoke-crack-ep-water-ep/,Merok,"Bass becomes SALEM, a witchy Chicago/Michigan/New York trio consisting of John Holland, Heather Marlatt, and Jack Donoghue. In the wake of last year's resurgence of lo-fi noise pop, an aesthetic that leaned heavily on treble, their emphasis on the low end distinguishes them from other young bands immersed in 4AD haze. And, as part of SALEM's apocalyptic lo-fi murk-pop aesthetic, it no doubt helped bring them to the attention of Patrik North, previously associated with Montreal label Summer Lovers Unlimited (Crystal Castles, the Tough Alliance, the Teenagers). Last year North co-founded a new label, Acéphale, with DJ friend Rory Them Finest, and SALEM's debut, the Yes, I Smoke Crack EP, was their inaugural release. London-based Merok (Klaxons, Crystal Castles, the Teenagers-- getting the picture?) picked up SALEM for a follow-up, the Water EP. Each limited-edition, vinyl-only release reveals a group with a distinctive style and a couple of should-be indie hits, but not quite the craft or consistency of their finest labelmates just yet. Their best track, ""Redlights"", opens both EPs. Marlatt's ghostly, Cocteau Twins-like vocals ring around scything guitar textures, funereal synths, and a rudimentary, bass-heavy electronic beat you might expect from Polow Da Don. It's the kind of disembodied, hard-to-pin-down pleasure that made Burial's Untrue so welcome a couple of years ago, with the indie production values and cigarette-smoking nihilism (Crack? ...Really?) of 1980s goth. As on Burial's ""Archangel"", the hook is just an evocative fragment, in this case about some things that are hard to remember, and some things-- the ones we haven't done yet-- that are hard to forget. It's not really so far from M83's electronic shoegaze circa Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. What ""Redlights"" illuminates, the rest of the EPs explores, to mixed effect. Slowed-down spookout muddles ""Water"" and ""Snakes"" hint at, but fail to fully inhabit, the downtuned alien vocal style of the Knife's Silent Shout. One of the quietest tracks, the calypso-tinged murderscape ""Deepburn"", sounds so rough as to seem unfinished-- are we really ready to get just as excited every time some new band without proven-tastemaker connections sends us a track like this? Still, listening to the Halloween shoegaze of ""Dirt"", the thudding violence of ""Skullcrush"", or the deadly sexual confidence of ""Whenusleep"", you can hear not just bass, but also a promising new group who-- like Glass Candy in the realm of after-hours Italo disco-- have a signature style, and now just need to develop it. Bass should be a means, not an end.",,6.1,
Pantheon of the Lesser,Ocean,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06f13d19756521383a5/1:1/w_160/358c9c15.jpg,2009-02-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12648-pantheon-of-the-lesser/,Important,"How much smaller will the world become? Technology's sporadic cycle has taken us now from foot to sea to wires to air to wireless, so that what I'm typing this instant could be read by someone in many of the world's countries the next. Whatever it is you want, your computer can probably give it to you right now. With that progression, our attention span has regressed dramatically: We text as we eat, watch funny videos as we lounge, and use the internet as the television blares. With music, shuffling and skipping have compromised the most fundamental units of consumption, the album and the song. In several interviews for last year's Songs in A&E, Jason Pierce-- who's explored hour-long drones in Spacemen 3 and escalating ecstasy in Spiritualized-- said, ""People aren't taking albums. They're taking tracks. I'm waiting for when they just want the chorus."" He wondered if people will only need the notes-- the A and the E-- soon enough. Maybe he's onto something: In a world where anything can be here any second, will we want something that takes any longer? It's a bit too convenient to reduce Pantheon of the Lesser-- the monolithic sophomore album from Portland, Maine's long-and-heavy metal quartet Ocean-- into an act of defiance to this speeding, shrinking world. But the 36- and 23-minute tracks that comprise Pantheon do feel a bit like revolt. They crawl through big riffs, rewarding the attentive with method and nuance, an achievement that recalls the subtle payoffs of classical composers Arvo Pärt and Philip Glass. Expectations and options become exits and entrances, trapdoors that allow the band to keep its familiar guitar-drum-bass space churning and fresh. For this, Ocean never feels selfish or ungrateful with its audience's time. And the payoffs? Imagine the climax of your favorite post-rock explosion lasting longer and gilded with the heavy elements and themes of desperation. Indeed, among the relatively crowded field of viscous, torpid metal (doom, drone, sludge or otherwise), Pantheon of the Lesser feels like a new benchmark. Check opener ""The Beacon"": A colossal drum hit blows the album open, only to be trailed by a slow riff that fingers through scrims of its own feedback note by note. The drums keep coming, directing the action and scattering the riffs like cannonballs, everything marching in unison alongside vocalist Candy's subterranean, super-serrated growls. The track moves in and out of that mold until it all collapses, leaving only a martial drumbeat above washes of feedback. And just when the climax hits, the band breaks into a sublime haze of guitar glow and drum decay. ""Of the Lesser,"" the second and final track, opens like ""The Beacon"" in reverse, a minute of silence punctuated by lonely guitar chords that hover in the air. The familiar march begins, but this time, the guitars pull away from the beat, lunging back from its forward progress. The guitars eventually charge ahead, and the drums even race into a double-time pound. During the first half of Pantheon and most of 2005's Here Where Nothing Grows, Ocean often alluded to one central riff, a low-slung chord progression that's always been stunted or subverted at the last second. But about 16 minutes into ""Of the Lesser"", they launch directly into it, stating it and repeating it three times. They begin the riff again, but sustain one note, returning to march formation. After those riffs, the last six minutes become but a blissful afterglow. ""Salt"", the second track from Here Where Nothing Grows, was an exercise in writing into and out of that riff; much of that album's third track, ""The Fall"", employed the same maneuvers. Pantheon, then, is an arrival, delivering on a three-year-old promise. That's a long time to wait for a riff to be resolved, but-- no hyperbole intended-- it's made every bad MP3 shuffle or bland slow-metal album I've heard since Here Where Nothing Grows worth it.","This monolithic sophomore album from Portland, Maine's long-and-heavy metal quartet Ocean-- two tracks, almost 60 minutes-- is like an act of defiance to this speeding, shrinking world.

Patches,Andy Moor and DJ/rupture,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a075ea9e61561daa4585/1:1/w_160/354efc01.jpg,2009-02-09 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12652-patches/,Unsuitable,"Upon hearing that DJ/rupture is following his stellar 2008 mix, Uproot, with an Andy Moor collaboration, for a second there we worried the dude in question was the trance producer. After all, in 2009 all bets are off, and logic can basically go fuck itself: Hot Chip recently recorded with Robert Wyatt; Chris Cornell with Timbaland (although this makes a weird kind of sense for Cornell-- too pretty for Grungetown, too grungy for Prettytown, he's always been stuck between worlds). And now, this. In fact, the Andy Moor in question is the Netherlands-based guitarist from such revered anarcho-punk bands as Dog Faced Hermans and the Ex. Patches consists of live, improvised tracks the duo recorded while touring together-- Moor on guitar, Rupture on turntables. In some ways, it's the opposite of Uproot: guitar-centric, spontaneous, and brittle. It sounds like an odd match, but if any punk guitarist is equipped for this sort of thing, it's Moor. Like Rupture, the Ex is known for incorporating a broad variety of non-Western styles into its music. Moor also has improv chops, as evidenced by the Ex's extemporaneous double-LP Instant and In the Fishtank collaborations with Sonic Youth and ICP. Rupture and Moor use different media, but their curatorial interests are alike. Together, they've forged an often-delirious concoction of post-punk serration, dubstep duskiness, hip-hop swagger, and free-jazz texture. As a general tendency, Moor vamps on arid, precise riffs, around which Rupture weaves loose nets of manhandled breaks. Then he tightens the net as the riffs become more assertive, as if to keep them from galloping away. Some of Rupture's samples are glaringly obvious-- another shift from the arcane selections of Uproot. On the dubby ""Ella Speed"", Moor plays spidery figures as Rupture flips the wolf whistle from Juelz Santana's ""There It Go (The Whistle Song)""; on ""One Hundred Month Bloom"" toneless guitar meets a tweaky version of the famous overture from Smashing Pumpkins' ""Today"". On ""Jimmy Rogers"", Diana Ross sings ""My World Is Empty Without You"" over disembodied vocals, shrieking pitches, and subliminal chords. Tracy Chapman shows up on ""Tracy"", its time-bomb riff ticking down to an echoing excerpt from ""Behind the Wall"". These moments feel like an unusually arty Girl Talk set, and are balanced by a ton of stealthy samples I'm helpless to identify. The vibe is persistently chilly, the terrain merciless-- even when Moor sets controls for the heart of the sun, as on the riff-heavy ""The Sheep Look Up"", he can't thaw Rupture's unforgiving tundra. Some tracks are spectral and nebulous, like the watery, de-tuned ""Tidal"". The riddim-oriented ones are better-- on ""Chisanga"", Moor's string-bent squiggles gradually flatten out into a hitching riff, which Rupture surrounds with a phalanx of strafing drums. But the ones where they truly mind-meld, rather than Rupture chasing after Moor's riffs with periphery-bound FX, are best. On ""Hot Pink Orleans"", mercury-slick sonar blips, pinging whammy-barred guitars, and scudding bass amass into a well-balanced dubstep apparatus. On ""Sometimes It Can Be Difficult To"", nervous guitar skitters, nervous scratches, and reverbed snares build into something resembling a terrible car crash. ""Our Enemies Have Watches But We Have Time"" astonishes with its violent drum breaks, which make Moor's snarling riff sound meek by comparison. True to its circumscribed nature, Patches lacks the awesome diversity of Uproot. But it's impressive that this improvised work packs a clandestine socio-political payload, which usually resolves in some latent irony between samples and song titles (although Tracy Chapman's lament of police uselessness is politically loaded from the start). If you know that ""Ella Speed"" is the title of a blues song about a man who becomes obsessed with a prostitute and shoots her to death, those Juelz whistles become less of a ""hey I recognize that"" gimmick, and more of an astringent comment on predatory male lust. The machine-gun drums and land-mine chords of ""Our Enemies Have Watches But We Have Time"" are a bit chilling if you know the title is a Taliban slogan. ""The Sheep Look Up"" takes its title from a dystopian sci-fi novel by John Brunner, which deals with environmental degradation in the U.S., making its party vibe rather sardonic. Careful listeners will discover other secret polemics, buried so deeply as not to disturb those who simply want to marvel at the killer instincts and catlike reflexes of Moor and Rupture live.","DJ/Rupture's first release on his new label, Unsuitable, is a collabaration with the Ex guitarist Andy Moor. Consisting of live, improvised tracks the duo recorded while touring together, the often-delirious concoction is almost the opposite of Rupture's 2008 mix Uproot-- guitar-centric, spontaneous, and brittle.

Afro Samurai Resurrection,RZA,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a074c0084474cd0bfba2/1:1/w_160/766ca3b6.jpg,2009-02-09 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12651-afro-samurai-resurrection/,Wu Music Group,"When RZA oversaw the Ghost Dog OST, it had the perfect kind of soundtrack symbiosis-- between lyrical themes, helpful bits of dialogue, and the Wu mythology, you could listen to the music and have a good idea what its parent film was about. But you didn't need to actually see the Forest Whitaker movie to know the record knocked something serious. Due to RZA never really breaking character when choosing alter-egos/side projects, I expected something similar from Afro Samurai Resurrection, the follow-up to 2007's manga soundtrack Afro Samurai. However, if I'm to take the music as face value indicative of its inspiration, the two things I'd figure about Afro is that 1) He derives his power from some sort of headband, and 2) He was a lot better at doing what he does about 15 years ago. This whole ""return of the 90s!"" thing could be mashed into a fine paste before it reaches outside of internet writing circles, but the main problem hip-hop isn't sharing with, say, Slumberland and noise-pop redos is that most of the artists trying to revive Clinton-era styles actually recorded during that time. And really, RZA's too busy chopping it up at Guitar Center tech displays and on set with Russell Crowe to realistically compete with his past.  Sonically, it's not far from anything he did on Digi Snacks or Birth of a Prince-- simultaneously too slick and digital to work towards his strengths, but not plush enough to suggest he could have anything but a Rik Cordero video treatment without Afro's attendant Kill Bill meets Boondocks animation. We've heard these elements before-- Shaolin hand-block snare, steamy funk guitar, bass that hits like a depth charge of The Chronic. But where RZA would weave each together into backdrops as bloody and vibrant as a freshly opened vein, here he's content to chop a sample and let it repeat every four bars, if not even more often than that, and it's hard to imagine anyone fighting to get the first crack. There are a couple of ripe exceptions, notably ""Dead Birds"", which has System of a Down (well, the bassist at least) helping conjure an El-P-style dystopia, but you just spend three minutes wishing it was an actual El-P track. ""Girl Samurai Lullaby"" could pass for some touristy Reggae Sunsplash shit from the softest day in Shabba Ranks' 1992; ""Nappy Afro"" is a throwback to a time when trying to rip off She'kspeare was the quickest way to radio rotation. Things really aren't that much better on the mic-- god bless RZA, but at this point, he's all but ignoring meter completely, flowing like a three-legged race. Sixteen years after Method Man expounded on the genesis of Inspectah Deck's name, we can only sit back and watch him play himself: ""I'm looking for some get back/ I'm quick to push your wig back/ You shouldn't have did that."" Fortunately, we get some much-needed career resuscitation from Rah Digga (though neither beat does her justice) and ""Whar"", the strongest track and the one that has the least to do with the plot. And yet, even as Kool G Rap (sounding a lot like Jim Jones now that he's ad-libbing) and Ghostface kick nice punchlines about Al Capone's syphilis and Abe Lincoln's beard, it's still somewhat by-the-numbers. But after the initial burst of brand recognition, we're left with the same Wu affiliate filler that most of us have been wisely ignoring for the better part of two decades. Killah Bees don't die, they multiply and spit martial raps full of discipline and bereft of any iota of personality that could distinguish between Wu-Tang Name Generator figments like Prodigal Sunn, Rugged Monk, and Moe Roc. The Black Knights stand out by matter of (relative) familiarity, and if you happen to be a blood relative of someone on ""Take The Sword Pt. III"", you might be able to make it through all 10 minutes. Look, it's no fun either way-- to plow through Afro Samurai Resurrection, or to bitch and moan about back in the day, a fate that befalls something like 99% of all mainstream releases. But at least the video game looks tight, which is something you can't say about Wu's output in that market back in the rec-room era. In this economy, that's just choosing your battles wisely.","The follow-up to 2007's manga soundtrack Afro Samurai, Resurrection finds RZA working with many of his Wu-Tang cohorts.

Mirror Eye,Psychic Ills,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06d13d19756521383a0/1:1/w_160/5f69896d.jpg,2009-02-06 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12646-mirror-eye/,Social Registry,"A staple on the Todd P circuit and tourmates of better-known, similarly minded experimental acts such as Black Dice and Gang Gang Dance, NYC's Psychic Ills have been making a racket since the early part of this decade. We last heard from them in 2006 when the band released Dins, which garnered moderate praise for combining drone-y elements with loosely structured melodies. In other words, there were enough quote-unquote songs buried in the album's murk to keep folks interested. With Mirror Eye, though, the group has decided to fully indulge their abstract tendencies, eschewing all traditional means of songcraft for a record that is almost wholly improvised. Sound like a bad idea? It is. Neither a well-thought-out conceptual piece nor an attempt at instrumental ambience, Mirror Eye plays like a meandering, impromptu practice session recorded just for kicks. It seems designed only to please its creators and the band wastes no time pushing listeners away: They open the record with ""Mantis"", a tedious 11-minute drone sketch built around a continuous synth loop encircling a simple hand drum. Intrepid souls who don't give up there will find ""Sub Synth"" equally off-putting: Two aggravating minutes of hearing your dad's power tools in the garage through the walls of your living room. Not everything here fails in such catastrophic fashion, but because the band noodles its way through Mirror Eye's druggy, sitar-laced exercises without any thought towards coherence (or completion), even its few promising tracks feel slapdash and unfinished. There's no reason that the blurry, vocal-treated ""Meta"", for instance, couldn't be fleshed out into something far more complex and hypnotic. (""Fingernail Tea"" might also be rendered halfway decent with some extra TLC.) So it's hard not to question Psychic Ills' commitment to this improvisational technique, not only because it doesn't work, but also because we're watching their peers (have you heard Animal Collective have a new album out?) succeed at this very moment by doing the exact opposite: toning down oddball inclinations in favor of pop structures and greater accessibility. Perhaps most frustrating about the group's failure is that, for all of Mirror Eye's drones, for all of its half-baked attempts to lull you into some psychogenic state, the record never enchants its listener and never intoxicates. (""I Take You as My Wife Again"" probably comes closest, before abruptly deteriorating into background noise halfway through.) Which is unfortunate, because when music like this is done right (see Kranky acts such as Valet and White Rainbow) it can be not only seductive but also beautiful and grand in scale. In order to achieve those qualities, though, it's necessary to approach the work with much greater care than Psychic Ills have done here. If the band wants to be known for this sort of atmospheric rock (or any other type, for that matter), they're ignoring a crucial component to success: effort.","Contemporaries of Gang Gang Dance and Black Dice, NYC's Psychic Ills here fully indulge their abstract tendencies, eschewing all traditional means of songcraft for a record that is almost wholly improvised.

Month of Madness,Freeway,by: David Drake,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05dea9e61561daa4559/1:1/w_160/cf6b3976.jpg,2009-02-06 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12633-month-of-madness/,self-released,"In a genre with a reputation for inconsistency, 32 well-written, expertly produced tracks-- released once per day for the month of December, then compiled as Freeway's Month of Madness-- deserves critical attention. For a distribution gimmick primarily focused on generating internet buzz, even complaining about the length of the compilation misses the point. And if you do find one track that isn't worth your time-- say, the sub-par feature with James Blunt-- then you can always wait until tomorrow, or hit forward on your iPod, and there's a good chance there will be a track you dig. Month of Madness has a lot going for it-- consistency, quality, and the bottomless hard drive space of the iPod age-- but 32 straight bangers can also be an artist's own worst enemy. Freeway is a great rapper; he's never lazy, writes detailed, interesting verses, and spits them with unique, frantic urgency. He has great taste in beats, using producers that hew closely to the 2000s' Roc-A-Fella soul-sampling blueprint; newcomer Blunt, who produces the bulk of the tracks, and 2008 It Producer Jake One both have great emotive moments. There are even a few outside-the-box tracks for needed diversity, with assists from Erick Sermon and the Alchemist. Don Cannon takes a break from looping classic soul to drop spinning chainsaws on ""Bank Rollz"". These are welcome changes from the de rigeur soul sampled banger for which Freeway is known, although they're also safe variations within the same narrow template. And this is how Month of Madness proves that ""quality"" doesn't always supersede tedium. It's as if Free has decided that he's foreman at a street rap factory, churning out endless iterations of the same basic structure. Contrary to critical consensus, one of the standout tracks on Free At Last was ""Take It to the Top"", where a 50 Cent hook helped Free transcend this one-note production with a little bit of pop dimension. Not topical dimension-- Freeway has always managed to spit on a variety of subjects with perspective and intelligence-- but some stylistic flexibility. As a performer, Freeway raps one way and does it very, very well. If you already love the ""typical Freeway banger,"" then you have no complaints. But it does suggest Free's not interested in expanding his audience beyond the converted, in building street buzz like Gucci Mane, or bothering Kanye on Billboard. Freeway has never really seemed bothered by this. And to criticize him for it is typically hypocritical, since I've been a big fan of DJ Premier's ability to churn out endless variations on the same motif for the past decade. But if the best he can get is fifteen minutes of internet buzz, then maybe consistency isn't what we're really looking for after all. This revolutionary method of distribution has provided Freeway with a niche, to build the kind of fanbase he wants by saturating the same channels as inferior blog-hype rappers. He's very good at what he does, but two hours of great music still draws attention to what he doesn't.","Philly rapper compiles 32 well-written, expertly produced tracks-- released once per day for the month of December-- into the overlooked Month of Madness mixtape*.

Volume One: The Vodoun Effect (Funk & Sato from Benin's Obscure Labels 1973-1975),Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05f9d034d5c69bf26d8/1:1/w_160/3e4926e7.jpg,2009-02-06 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12635-volume-one-the-vodoun-effect-funk-sato-from-benins-obscure-labels-1973-1975/,Analog Africa,"Recording more than 50 albums and hundreds of 45s, Orchestre Poly-Rythmo were one of the most prolific bands of the 20th century. They were also one of the best. An innovative group that developed its own distinctive style of hard-driving funk but still found time to record in just about every style imaginable, from highlife, Afrobeat, and rumba to rock, jazz, soul, and folk. And yet, as of today, they don't even have a Wikipedia page. That peers of Bembeya Jazz National, Orchestra Baobab, Rail Band, OK Jazz, Fela's Africa 70, and every other great African band of the 1950s-70s has managed to remain this obscure and unheard is frankly baffling-- and attributable more to the capricious nature of fame than any other single factor. The band's geographic location probably didn't help. Their home country of Benin, a relatively small nation bordering Nigeria, is often overshadowed in the eyes of the rest of the world by its neighbors, and because the former French colony and its even smaller neighbor Togo are surrounded by the Anglophone giants Ghana and Nigeria, their recordings sometimes found it difficult to travel far outside their borders. (Though they did tour much of Africa and even France during their 1969-1982 heyday.) Still, Poly-Rythmo and its most prominent members are household names in their homeland. Compiled by Analog Africa's Samy Ben Redjeb, The Vodoun Effect gathers 14 of the band's rawest, funkiest cuts into a thrilling hours-plus album. The generous, 44-page liner notes inform us that while the band did most of its recording, and certainly its most prominent recording, for the Albarika Store label, it also cut dozens of sides for smaller labels of more modest means. This compilation focuses on those releases. Many of these tracks were recorded with a microphone or two plugged into a Nagra reel-to-reel machine, but you'd never guess the setup was that simple from the incredible depth and fidelity of the sound. Pressings of these 45s rarely exceeded 500 copies, and distribution scarcely ever reached outside the coastal cities of Cotonou and Porto Novo, so this is the first any of these songs save one have ever been available outside Benin. (There's no overlap at all between this and the other two Poly-Rythmo comps available in the West, Sound Way's excellent, funk-focused Kings of Benin Urban Groove and Popular African Music's highlife-centric and also great Reminiscin' in Tempo.) The engine of the band was its rhythm section: drummer Yehouessi Leopold, lead guitarist Bernard ""Papillon"" Zoundegnon, and bassist Gustave Bentho. Leopold was a master of the polyrhythmic foundations the band was named for, effortlessly playing three against four to give the band's songs a swaying, unstoppable feel and adapting the Vodoun (aka voodoo) ceremonial rhythms sato and sakpata into unique funk that drove the band at a frenetic pace. Just as the sound is stripped down on these recordings, so too is the band, with the horns frequently absent, leaving just the core of drums, bass, and two guitars, with some buzzing organ and a singer or two. The immense rhythmic power of the music is the primary attraction, but the compositions are also quite sophisticated, setting contrasting sections against each other, hinging on memorable refrains and still leaving space for the band to stretch out and strut its stuff. The telepathic tightness of the band is a strength: The group latches onto the relatively slow sakpato beat of ""Mi Ni Non Kpo"", entwining the guitars around the sturdy bassline and crackling percussion to create a psychedelic whirlwind of intertwining rhythm. Elsewhere, ""Se Tche We Djo Mon"" simply rides a pulsating, non-stop groove, slathering it with Papillon's weightless lead guitar, which carries one of the disc's most memorable riffs. Papillon's solo on ""Assibavi"" is jaw-dropping, deploying rippling waves of notes soaked in heavy reverb to create a shimmering soundscape above the din of the band. ""Mi Homlan Dadale"" features a dramatic rhythmic shift to a majestic organ and guitar phrase between its verses, then jumps back into pocket again while the vocalist hangs on for the ride. There's not a single track that doesn't have a groove worth talking about, and there's not a single groove whose power can be adequately translated into words. Papillon and Yehouessi Leopold both died within a year of each other in the early 1980s, just as mainstream artists and listeners around the world were finally getting clued in to African sounds, and it's tough not to think what might have been had the classic rhythm section been able to carry them into that era. At the very least, those outside Benin are finally getting to hear this music, delivered in a beautiful, informative package stuffed with photos and even a small-label 45 discography, and for that we should be grateful.","One of the most prolific and underappreciated bands of the 20th century-- Benin's Orchestre Poly-Rythmo-- finally gets its due.

The Crawling Distance,Robert Pollard,by: Paul Thompson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a062b1335d7bf1697fe2/1:1/w_160/53d6cfa0.jpg,2009-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12637-the-crawling-distance/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","When Microsoft gawkily rolled out their Songsmith program-- you know, the thing that takes your live vocals and puts silly music behind 'em-- my first thought was of Robert Pollard. Who else but the overgenerous ex-Guided by Voices tunesmith could benefit more from a device that merely needs a vocal melody to cough up a song? Forget the album-a-month pace Pollard's seemingly been keeping these days, with his recent work from his Boston Spaceships, Circus Devils, and his latest solo effort The Crawling Distance; we'd be getting an album-a-day from Bob and his imaginary backing band. Part of me thinks that sort of thing's not so far off for Mr. Pollard already. Guided by Voices were once a fairly centralized recording concern, but Bob's long been fond of rock-by-correspondence. And he's found quite a pen pal in Todd Tobias, a late-era GBV associate and the strongman to Pollard's bearded lady in the Circus Devils. Pollard and Tobias have been working in this manner for some time now, and the arrangement, I gather, goes like this: Pollard writes the songs, crafts some vocal demos with rudimentary instrumentation, shoots them off to Tobias for fleshing out, and sits around writing the next one while waiting for the results. It's an arrangement with its share of successes-- 2006's From a Compound Eye and last year's Robert Pollard Is Off to Business spring to mind-- but it's also one that's made for some awkward fits; Pollard's the dude responsible for the gloriously crappy-sounding pastiche of Bee Thousand and Propeller, whereas Tobias' workmanlike efforts never sound that far from the backdrop of a ""Dawson's Creek"" episode. Never has that rift between Pollard the songwriter and Tobias the arranger been more transparent-- and more problematic-- than on the formless, often dull The Crawling Distance, a particularly blank batch of Pollard tunes dressed to the nines in Tobias' perfunctory sheen. Pollard's always best when he's tossed a little grit in the arrangements and kept the song lengths down to a minimum. There are almost certainly some crappy hooks on, say, Guided by Voices' Alien Lanes, but you have a much harder time picking them out when they're buzzing by your head at such a pace. The last several GBV records and Pollard's recent solo work are chock full of songs that approach the five-minute mark, and almost without fail, they tend to plod. So when Crawling Distance kicks off with the characterless piano-led four-minute rocker ""Faking My Harlequin"", it's a stumble the album never quite recovers from. ""Harlequin"" sounds a bit like a modern-era Sonic Youth song before the inevitable noise freakout, but here the tension builds but is never released. Instead, the record moves into the earwormy but stupid swagger of ""Cave Zone"". ""Red Cross Vegas Night"" is nothing more than your standard-issue Pollard-style slow starter-turned-fist pumper, ""The Butler Stands for All of Us"" rides a nice little rolling mod-pop melody and a sneaky guitar line into mediocrity, and the strummy dirge of ""It's Easy""-- though a bit like Mag Earwhig!'s ""I Am Produced"" in tone-- really only has the one thing going for it: the line ""tax exempt with Touchdown Jesus."" The second half fares a bit better, with the curious circular melody and Sebadoh-like downstrum of ""No Island"" and exciting post-punker ""By Silence Be Destroyed"". Alas, then there's ""Imaginary Queen Anne"", a nice enough slow jam sung with feeling that Pollard could-- and, hell, maybe does-- knock out on trip to the fridge at this point. ""On Shortwave"" is one of those maudlin but intense things Pollard's been brooding over since at least the Universal Truths days. Finally, there's ""Too Much Fun (Is Too Much Fun)"", on which Pollard wastes a killer verse melody with some truly dumbass lyrics then progs up the place at every other point in the song with entirely too much riffage. Hey rockers, wanna end your records on a weird note? Write one about whimsy that is in almost no way enjoyable. Works every time. Though his vocals are fairly strong throughout, Pollard sounds a bit out of gas while pushing the pen, and these songs by and large aren't much on either structure or substance. But enduring a few lousy Pollard songs in a row is pretty much par for the course for fans of the man these days, so placing the blame for Crawling Distance's failure on Pollard's shoulders would be grossly unfair. It'd all be easier to take if Tobias were doing anything at all interesting with the melodies he's crafting around Bob's tunes. But apart from piling a few extra effects onto the plodding ""Harlequin"", he's giving each and every song its most baseline pop-rock arrangement. Hell, if Tobias is producing most of the stuff Pollard's putting out these days, he's a busy character, and that may go some way to explaining why all these songs were given this unimaginative treatment. And perhaps this is what Pollard wants; more records, more often, with passable sound and enough new tunes to get him through the next all-too-rare tour. But, weak as these tunes appear in their current form, one can't help but wonder how they might've sounded chopped into morsels and fleshed out with a bit more fervor. Or, hell, through Songsmith. Just about anything but how they are right now.","Robert Pollard and Todd Tobias continue a working relationship that has enjoyed its share of recent successes, most notably 2006's From a Compound Eye and last year's Robert Pollard Is Off to Business.

The Pains of Being Pure at Heart,The Pains of Being Pure at Heart,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06b13d197565213839a/1:1/w_160/6758b248.jpg,2009-02-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12644-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/,Slumberland,"Like plenty of other bands in the internet era, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart seem poised to attract an audience that will far outstrip that of their easily identifiable precedents-- in their case, groups like Rocketship or Shop Assistants, each obscure these days even by Approved Indie Influence standards. A few other twee/noise-pop revivalists arguably pulled off that same trick last year, but Pains of Being Pure at Heart are likely to appeal to listeners beyond online name-droppers and Brooklyn scenesters. That these second-wavers are getting first-rate attention shouldn't be a worry unless you're into dick-measuring contests about the late-1980s (but I was there) or still holding a grudge against Vivian Girls and Crystal Stilts. Despite being such a streamlined listen, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart acts as something of an indie Rorschach: Once our staff got a hold of the fuzzy, major-chord fizz of ""Come Saturday"" or ""Stay Alive"", it raised comparisons to everything from Sleepyhead to Black Tambourine to even Peter Bjorn and John (at their most shoegazy) and Ride (at their most heavy-lidded). In other words, you'll dig this record as long as you're a fan of trebly, melancholy pop music. Which is quite a lot of people reading this review. What distinguishes POBPAH from the rest of their modern peers is a sense of craft located in the sweet spot between wilfull amateurism masking incompetence and not gumming things up with bells and whistles. It's immediate and substantial, but initially, it can seem distracting that the band is built more for speed than muscle. Yet these aren't songs that need anchors-- as much as Alex Naidus' bass plays an integral role in pushing everything forward, he's more likely to contribute melodic counterpoint than low end. Kip Berman's voice is appropriately unaffected, working in melodies that almost feel like 45-degree angles-- exact, acute, and just right. Keyboardist Peggy Wang-East doesn't harmonize in a traditional sense with Berman very often, but particularly on ""Young Adult Friction"", her vocals are a hook in themselves, taking an already strong chorus to a higher plateau. So yeah, they've got the sound figured out, but what ensures that this will be something that'll make it past the point where the indie cycle of life goes on and bands are inevitably starting to cop the sounds of, say, Archers of Loaf? Regardless of the b&w cover art, there's more gray matter than initially appears. The title alone of ""This Love Is Fucking Right!"" is enough to set off the sugar shock factor (it's a nod to the Field Mice), and that's before the chorus which renders the f-bomb ""feckin!,"" but the invocation of ""you're my sister"" before the title is as dark as you want it to be. ""Stay Alive"" is the record's centerpiece, boasting the most anthemic chorus; initially, it could pass for cloyingly optimistic, with bell-like keyboard pinches accenting thumbs-up signifiers like ""shoot at the sky"" and ""you'll stay alive."" But once again, after closer listens it takes a darker tone, possibly talking down a suicidal friend. Most tellingly, ""Come Saturday"" sets the stage for the rest of the record with a promise of ignoring parties for a summer wasting and spent indoors. It's every bit as heartfelt as the later lyrical nod to Another Sunny Day. But then again, sincerity never made me turn up the volume. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart simply made a slyly confident debut that mixes sparkling melodies with an undercurrent of sad bastard mopery, and you're just being a dick if you think the past has some kind of patent on that. That's just the way good pop music works.",,8.4,
Changing Horses,Ben Kweller,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06eb1335d7bf1697ffd/1:1/w_160/87cc9848.jpg,2009-02-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12647-changing-horses/,ATOATO,"Ben Kweller's Changing Horses joins the likes of Beck's Sea Change, Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics, and Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi on the list of albums with titles that tell you what the artist is doing with his or her career. In Kweller's case the mid-stream leap is being made from polite, mannered 1960s-influenced indie-pop to polite, mannered 1970s influenced alt-country. It's a clear shift but not a terribly shocking or risky one; in fact, it's practically a rite of passage at this point for an articulate, prodigious young indie songwriter (Conor Oberst, Jenny Lewis) to eventually confuse an acceptance of artistic adulthood with a need to embrace maturity through old Hag records and lots of pedal steel guitar. Of course, for a college radio staple like Kweller, goin' country doesn't necessarily entail digging deep into the genre's roots or taking cues from any of its more successful modern practitioners. Instead, its sources are typically secondary rather than primary, rockers who themselves leaned, dabbled, or dove headlong into country like Bob Dylan, the Band, Gram Parsons, and Tom Petty. Lazy and timorous as this kind of borrowing may seem, it's probably the best route for an artist of Kweller's genial modesty and perpetually adolescent vocal stylings to take. When he ventures out into country's deeper waters, the results can be disastrous, as evidenced by the embarrassing ""Fight"", in which Kweller goofily rhapsodizes a long-haul trucker and exhorts ""you've got to set your sight on the Lord in your life"" with a unearned casualness that's downright insulting (the song lacks the kind of parodic conviviality that could have at least put it in the vein of the Stones' ""Far Away Eyes""). Similarly, some of Kweller's more overtly whole-hog immersions in twang end up feeling like strategies for papering over go-nowhere material, particularly on ""Wantin' Her Again"" and the poky opener ""Gypsy Rose"". The tough, Petty-ish ""On Her Own"", meanwhile, has plenty to recommend itself from a structural standpoint, yet as a performer the winsome Kweller can't come close to mustering the easy swagger necessary to pull it off. Unsurprisingly, Kweller is at his best here when churning out his patented nervously peppy indie pop and simply coloring it with something a bit down-home. The empathetic, just-plain-agreeable likes of ""Hurtin' You"", ""Ballad of Wendy Baker"", and ""Things I Like to Do"" (full of endearing asides such as ""I like talking at the diner 'stead of screaming in the noisy bar"") sit far more comfortably in Kweller's wheelhouse, and outshine any full-on retro pastiche like the late-Beatles rip ""Sawdust Man"". (Seriously, leave that stuff for Dr. Dog). Remember, even though Kweller's self-titled 2006 album was too 60s beholden, he possesses a fine, almost entirely self-sustaining album to his credit, 2004's affecting rocker On My Way. While I certainly can't hold it against Kweller for trying something different and playing dress-up with a Nudie suit, Changing Horses nonetheless finds his half-assed over-countrification and half-assed under-countrification to be equally ineffectual.","As the title suggests, here Ben Kweller jumps from making polite, mannered 1960s-influenced indie-pop to polite, mannered 1970s influenced alt-country.

"Love, Hate, and Then There's You",The Von Bondies,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06ac0084474cd0bfb87/1:1/w_160/7846bcbb.jpg,2009-02-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12643-love-hate-and-then-theres-you/,Majordomo,"The first time I saw the Killers, at a South by Southwest party in March 2004, they looked like they had just stepped out of Early 2000s Alt-Rock Central Casting: you had Brandon Flowers facing the 95-degree sunshine in a black suit, as if he were auditioning to be Carlos D's Interpol understudy; guitarist Dave Keuning playing the part of the Rapture's Luke Jenner with his tight jeans and afro; and, with his long nose and blond moptop, it appeared bassist Mark Stoermer was modeling himself after Von Bondies frontman Jason Stollsteimer. Back then, wanting to be a Von Bondie wasn't such a crazy idea: They had just released their acclaimed, Jerry Harrison-produced major-label debut, Pawn Shoppe Heart, powered by a heavily rotated single (""C'mon C'mon"") that would land them on Letterman. And if their early, career-boosting friendship with the White Stripes had already soured (following an infamous December 2003 altercation at a Detroit nightclub between Jack White and Stollsteimer), Pawn Shoppe's release was fortuitously timed to capitalize on the sensationalist attention. Of course, in the five years since, the Killers would go on to sell several million albums while the Von Bondies were practically on life support, losing bassist Carrie Smith and guitarist Marcie Bolen, effecting a nasty split with Sire and surviving largely by the use of ""C'mon C'mon"" as the opening theme to F/X series ""Rescue Me"". Compared to the buzz that greeted Pawn Shoppe Heart, the release of the Von Bondies' new third album, Love, Hate, and Then There's You has been beyond low-key-- after the band first announced its release over a year ago, it arrives now on fledgling Shout Factory offshoot Majordomo Records. But despite all this upheaval and tumult, Love, Hate, and Then There's You sounds like it could've come out five months after Pawn Shoppe Heart, never mind five years. On that last album, the Von Bondies were already initiating a spiritual break from the Detroit garage-rock scene that birthed them, tempering their blues-punk swing with bubblegum-sweet choruses; Love, Hate shifts that process into overdrive, enlisting producers Butch Walker and Rick Parker (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) to gloss over the last vestiges of the grease. On opening track ""This Is Our Perfect Crime"", Stollsteimer welcomes his band back into indie-dom by declaring ""we are the underground,"" but the song around him has other designs: armed with a crisp, clipped riff, melodramatic mid-song breakdown/build-up, and group-chorus-as-manifesto, the new Von Bondies reemerge with all the stern-faced intent and self-belief of, well, the Killers. For those who remember the Von Bondies as trashy maximum-R&B revivalists on Sympathy for the Record Industry, it'll be hard to get back onboard-- in the absence of their fuzzbox boogie, the band's doomed-romance laments (""Only to Haunt You"", ""Pale Bride"") could be the product of any number of NME-mugging modern-rock acts adopting new-wave affectations. And like any rock band trying to survive in the post-Arcade Fire era, the Von Bondies succumb to the obligatory bout of U2/Springsteen stadium-baiting, building a slow-percolating synth intro into a typically blustery finale on ""Modern Saints"", which climaxes with a martyr-ready cry of ""Take my heart away/ Forevermore!"" The Von Bondies don't embarass themselves with these grandstanding gestures-- Stollsteimer's got the voice for the job-- but they don't distinguish themselves either. Where their earlier records thrived on the tension between Stollsteimer's gut-spilling confessions and the band's raucous, raw-powered attack, on Love, Hate and Then There's You, we get all the pleading, but without the violent, cathartic release. But Stollsteimer is nothing if not self-aware of his polarizing capabilities, and he spends about half of ""Shut Your Mouth"" taunting the skeptics by repeatedly asking, ""Can you say a good word about us?"" Most certainly-- when Stollsteimer eases up on the chest-beating dramatics, the Von Bondies can be a pretty great and very fun power-pop band: The glam-slammed ""Accidents Will Happen"" is the sort of bouncing-beat rocker you wish the Strokes would get back to writing, while ""21st Birthday"" and ""Chancer"" are Cheap Trickeriffic three-minute kiss-offs, with new guitarist Christy Hunt and bassist Leann Banks ably replacing Bolen and Smith as Stollsteimer’s cool-chick vocal foils. ""You don't look so cool but you look so alive,"" Stollsteimer sings on ""Chancer"", and for the new Von Bondies, the latter point matters more than the former.","Five long years on from Pawn Shoppe Heart and their alt-rock moment, the Von Bondies reemerge with a stern-faced intent and self-belief that sounds more like the Killers than their former friends and contemporaries the White Stripes.

Leave It All Behind,The Foreign Exchange,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05a9d034d5c69bf26cf/1:1/w_160/330c541c.jpg,2009-02-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12630-leave-it-all-behind/,Nicolay Music,"The 2004 album Connected by the Foreign Exchange (North Carolina rapper Phonte and Dutch producer Nicolay) was a record of unusual warmth and vibrancy. And yet, one bum line from Phonte still threatens to derail it with every listen-- ""Applied for the job of rap nigga/ But I was overqualified."" For better or (mostly) worse, this sort of mindset has boxed in just about everything he's done since with Little Brother, his project with rapper Big Pooh. Though obviously in pursuit of commercial adulation and positioning himself as a vanguard of thinking man's hip-hop, Phonte too often casts those who are more successful in simple and condescending terms while offering a one-step solution to all hip-hop's ills-- increased sales of Little Brother records. A slew of missed opportunities and disillusion with the game have resulted in a whole lot of disappointing Phonte projects. But knowing this can't prepare you for just how closely Leave It All Behind hews to its title, as Phonte opts out of hip-hop with a nearly full-on R&B record with exactly two rapped verses. And there's really no way of preparing for how good it actually turned out. I mean, Phonte's never shied away from doing hooks, but who knew he wanted to go all-out like this? But go straight long enough from the grid of the mainstream and you'll end up where you were-- word is that rapper-ternt-sanger is a pretty big with the kids these days. But while Leave It All Behind can certainly be judged in a different light post-808s and Heartbreak, it actually has more in common with Yo La Tengo's *And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-*Out, a similarly muted, lovely, and humane take on adult relationships worth working for (which makes it the complete opposite of the often embarrassingly juvenile petulance of 808s). Grown and maybe not-so sexy, but certainly lived-in. ""All or Nothing/Coming Home to You"" begins with the always-charming intro where its narrator arguing with a woman you can't see or hear. But when Phonte mutters, ""That's cool-- I wanted to play Xbox on the big TV anyways"" after being shuttled off to the couch, it's reminiscent of the kind of knowing detail Mike Skinner used to master in before coke and zen fucked up his brain. Phonte's voice isn't really suited for heavy lifting, but he's hardly alone on Leave It All Behind, getting contributions from Nicolay's more unheralded collaborators and making it rightfully feel like a conversation. Darien Brockington's easygoing lilt raises ""Take Off Your Blues"" out of a dangerously Love Below sentiment, while Musinah and Yahzarah give earthy counterpoint to the siesta soundscapes of ""Daykeeper"" and ""If She Breaks Your Heart."" And musically, Nicolay's in his comfort zone, making the sort of album he'd been more or less heading towards since Connected, an album that, while certainly rooted in hip-hop, knocked like a pillow fight. It's characteristically consistent, melodic, but rarely cloying, owing its dominant sound to ghost-white sheets of Rhodes and Stevie Wonder chord leaps that terms like ""milky"" do no justice. Opening track ""Daykeeper"" successfully applies the opaque synths of ""Kid A"" to a completely opposite exploration of bedsit contentment. Likewise, it's tempting to see the title of ""House of Cards"" as bait for curious Radiohead fans, but the liftoff it achieves during its hook is stunning on its own terms, live drums and guitar glimmers twisting in the wind. Wisely, Nicolay manages to steer clear of boilerplate neo-soul, or at least the interesting parts do. Leave It All Behind is mostly butter, but occasionally lapses into cheese. After ""If This Is Love"" pleasingly recalls Total's ""Trippin'"" with a simple but effective late-90's electronica touch, ""Something to Behold"" is the sort of crossover loverman rap that Little Brother would probably limply parody on The Minstrel Show. Meanwhile, some pretty terrible lyrics are hiding in plain sight amidst borderline easy listening. The closing title track tucks the kids in to bed while hoping they ""dream of lullabies and clowns,"" and I dunno-- clowns singing lullabies tend to freak most discerning kids the fuck out. And above all, there's the possibility that it can be tagged as a great R&B album that spans the late hours and early morning...if you're into that sort of thing. And really, as with Connected, it would be a shame if Leave It All Behind were merely lauded for how it stood in opposition to more commercially dominant hip-hop trends or derided for the same reason. It's difficult to figure how to address these qualms without the whole Foreign Exchange franchise folding altogether. For guys who haven't spent a whole lot of time together, Phonte and Nicolay get lots of mileage out of the idea of their music being handcrafted as if they were actually were hanging out in the studio. Would Leave It All Behind be a better album if Phonte didn't admittedly sound something like Maxwell with weaker lungs so often? Would it be better if Phonte rapped more? Probably not-- these sorts of projects too often inspire catcalls to keep a day job, but the Foreign Exchange may have just earned an unexpected promotion.","North Carolina MC Phonte and Dutch producer Nicolay continue their partnership with an unexpected left-turn, crafting a surprisingly strong full-on R&B record with almost no rapping.

The Memorial Collection / Down the Line: Rarities,Buddy Holly,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0675e6ef9596931ff38/1:1/w_160/355bf8b4.jpg,2009-02-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12642-the-memorial-collection-down-the-line-rarities/,Geffen,"There's no question Buddy Holly deserves the big reissue treatment. For less than two years during the late 1950s, he helped revolutionize rock'n'roll with his hiccupping vocal style, inventive arrangements, tenderly exuberant songwriting, and gut-wringing guitar-slinging. He has been exalted in the dead-rock-star pantheon and overly romanticized in the process, but his music still encourages starry-eyed wonder. For a catalog so deeply entrenched in the rock canon, it sounds unusual even today: stripped down but with mind-boggling range, at once sweetly romantic yet revved and horny. Recording most of his best-known songs in a small dive studio in Clovis, New Mexico, he embodies the DIY spirit. Although anyone could play these chords and follow these riffs, who else could make them sound so lively? The list of artists Holly has influenced includes-- directly and indirectly-- just about anyone who has picked up a guitar in the last half-century. He's been covered by everyone from the Rolling Stones to M. Ward; Elvis Costello wouldn't have worn those nerd-punk specs without Holly's example; and a million twee bands wouldn't exist without ""Everyday"". But does the world need another Buddy Holly collection? That's a trickier question. The single-disc, 20-track From the Master Tapes is his most persuasive collection from start to finish, and the 2xCD, 50-track Buddy Holly Collection dilutes the quality only minimally. Statistically speaking, the new, 3xCD, 60-track Memorial Collection-- released to correspond, somewhat morbidly, with the 50th anniversary of Holly's death, or, as the boomers call it, the Day the Music Died-- must be the least of the three. It includes all the likely songs and encompasses all of Master Tapes and most of the Buddy Holly Collection: hits like ""Oh Boy!"" and ""Maybe Baby""; covers like ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"" and ""Ready Teddy"", which is more ferocious than even Elvis' version; and ""Not Fade Away"", which provided a career roadmap for a generation of musicians. Like any Holly comp, the Memorial Collection showcases his talent for minimalist and intimate arrangements. Especially with the original line-up of the Crickets (bass player Joe B. Mauldin and drummer Jerry Allison), he constantly looked for new sounds, either employing new instruments-- like the celesta on ""Everyday""-- or eliciting new sounds from old instruments. Allison, one of rock's unsung drummers, is crucial: he uses mallets to soften the beat on ""Words of Love"", slaps his knees on ""Everyday"", and switches to what sounds like a boxtop on ""Not Fade Away"", forming a playful patter against Holly's jumpy guitar. The Memorial Collection, however, also culls from the margins of Holly's career, starting with his earliest recordings. In Lubbock, Texas, he joined a ""Western and bop"" band with his junior high friend Bob Montgomery, and the three tracks, all previously unreleased in the U.S., are all originals, showcasing Montgomery's songwriting and the duo's rollicking dynamic. These three tracks, especially the staticky ""Soft Place in My Heart"", bear the crackle and warp of years in storage, but the duo's energy comes through nevertheless, creating a context for the music that follows. Buddy & Bob formed and disbanded in 1955; two years later, Holly would start notching a few hits; two years after that, he would be dead. He left a deep vault of recordings, including alternate takes of popular hits, unfinished demos, undubbed instrumentals, and assorted potential B-sides. The Clovis label continued releasing new Holly material for the next tent years, often piecing together vocal and instrumental tracks to create ""finished"" versions of ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"", and others. The Memorial Collection includes several of the raw, undubbed tracks: intimate takes featuring Holly singing and playing an acoustic guitar. They're skeletons of songs he intended to flesh out, and as such, they nicely showcase his inimitable vocals, which could move effortlessly from a staccato whoop to a velvety croon. Still, it seems odd to include these rough cuts without the final releases. On one hand, it highlights the person above the legend, quarantining his output from others' influence, yet those versions are part of his biography now, as indispensible as any of his other hits. Those undubbed songs might be better relegated to Down the Line, a 2xCD, 59-track rarities collection that gathers similarly unfinished tracks from every phase of Holly's brief career. It opens with a home recording of Hank Snow's ""My Two-Timin' Woman"" that Holly made when he was just 13 years old. It's barely intelligible, but shows his grounding in country music. You can hear the point when he saw Elvis perform in Lubbock, an event that had a profound impact on the Texas teen: I'd put it right between the loping ""You and I Are Through"" and the revved-up ""Down the Line"". His music sounds newly energized, more dependent on his harmonies with Bob Montgomery than on uncorked rock-and-roll energy. That newfound bravado is on full display throughout the Garage Tapes, which Holly recorded in the family garage with drummer Jerry Allison and an unknown bass player. They're mostly covers: Holly's Bo Diddley is anemic, his Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry is hilarious, his Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins more than respectable, and his Elvis nearly out-Elvises Elvis on ""Good Rockin' Tonight"". Compare them with the mostly acoustic Apartment Tapes, which Holly recorded shortly before his death in the Manhattan apartment he shared with his new bride, Maria Elena. They're intimate settings for these casual demos. You can hear what sounds like a sink running during the opening chords of ""Love Is Strange"" and what could be a breeze through an open window on most other songs. At times it's too intimate-- the three minutes of ""Buddy & Elena Maria talking in apartment"" makes you an eavesdropper-- but recordings like ""Learning the Game"" and ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"" display his light interpretive touch, and the tremolo-laden ""Untitled Instrumental"" shows an interesting direction he might have pursued. While it's important to have both the Garage and Apartment tapes in print, Down the Line nevertheless feels like an addendum to the Memorial Collection rather than a stand-alone release, a fans-only collection that will likely fatigue newcomers with its repeated songs and fluctuating sound quality. Ultimately, these two releases might have sounded better compressed into one enormous chronological tracklist, as they need each other for context and comparison. As is, neither feels especially definitive, but both are certainly welcome.",,7.7,
Live Session EP,Deerhoof,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06cb1335d7bf1697ff9/1:1/w_160/55becf45.jpg,2009-02-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12645-live-session-ep/,iTunes,"Deerhoof became a better band over their nine-album career, but live they've always been something special. The first time I saw Deerhoof play, at an all-ages venue in Arizona, there were less than 10 people there. Despite this, Deerhoof played as if the house was packed: drummer Greg Saunier smiled widely and singer Satomi Matsuzaki kept her gaze focused and intimidating. The interaction between the two already seemed almost psychic. I've seen them several times since; every time they've sounded like a new band, but their enthusiasm for playing in front of people was the same. You knew how good they were-- the records told you that. But you understood how fun they were by watching them play. Like the iTunes My Morning Jacket EP, Deerhoof's live exclusive iTunes EP features the band recorded live, inside a studio. Without an audience to reflect back at the band (a feature you either love or hate in a live recording), there isn't much live-ness to the EP. And unless you've got the original queued up (or have the every detail committed to memory), the live arrangements here won't sound drastically different from their studio counterparts. If it were a game of EroticPhotohunt, you'd be counting nipple hairs. Part of the trouble is that Deerhoof chose three songs from their latest, and more controlled LP, Offend Maggie, to re-record here. It's difficult to breathe new life into songs that are this airtight. The biggest change on opener ""The Tears of Music and Love"" lies in its slightly softer finish. The EP's languorous take on ""Buck and Judy"" attenuates the album version's bass punctuations, while ""Basket Ball Get Your Groove Back"" is just as nutty, though live it shimmers and widens, but again, just slightly. The two older tracks, Milk Man's title track and Apple O's ""Blue Cash"", undergo slight makeovers. The live version of ""Blue Cash"" reflects its namesake, countrifying the original with a slide guitar doubling the vocal and a sparse beat propelling it from behind. ""Makko Shobu"" is the EP's sole new song (though even it was released previously as the B-side to 2007's ""Matchbook Seeks Maniac"" 7""). Saunier abandons his kit for the piano while Matsuzaki sings in Japanese. These are the only two instruments on the song. As on many other Deerhoof tracks, Matsuzaki's voice follows the lead melody, while Saunier's chords unfurl in all directions. Since this is an iTunes-only EP, you can buy individual tracks. ""Makko Shobu"" and ""Blue Cash"" are the surest bets. But with the glut of readily available Deerhoof live videos, with from-the-board recordings or from-the-audience crowd noise, it might make more sense to download those. Because, again, the compelling thing about live Deerhoof is, well, live Deerhoof: The way Saunier keeps his arms close to his sides, Matsuzaki's personal sign language, how John Dieterich's and Ed Rodriguez's guitars respond to each other. No record can recreate the physicality of that (or, indeed, any) live performance, but this EP is at least responsible for some decent flashbacks.","Like the recent iTunes My Morning Jacket EP, this exclusive Deerhoof EP features the band recorded live, inside a studio. Mostly drawn from last year's Offend Maggie, the six-song set does feature one new song.

Devastator,Catfish Haven,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05bc0084474cd0bfb59/1:1/w_160/98b79439.jpg,2009-02-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12631-devastator/,Secretly Canadian,"Catfish Haven are named for bandleader George Hunter's childhood home (a trailer park) and their music deals in hand claps, long necks, hard women, and that eternal American rock'n'roll promise, a slice of interstate transcendence lying in wait beyond the next off-ramp. Hunter-- singer, songwriter and lead guitarist-- is the voice behind these shouts and promises, and as such a lighthouse for all the thematic, compositional, and tonal colors of Devastator, the band's second full-length. Seemingly every moment lives and dies on his voice, such as when he dashes through durable 4/4 roadhouse stomps and roars, ""I've been handed to the dogs before / Make my bed on someone else's floor"" on ""Are You Ready"". Hunter's bronzed, baritone howl is so vivid, and hearkens back to so many classic rock voices, to listen to him is to submerge yourself in nostalgia: Joe Cocker's flecked grit, Billy Gibbons' spelunking caterwaul, even John Fogerty's emotional grace through vocal tails, valleys and peaks. Bassist Miguel Castillo and drummer Ryan Farnham aren't weak, nor unsatisfactory, just handcuffed. Devastator expands the band's sound beyond their previous set up, introducing saxophone, keyboards, backing vocals, harmonica and banjo, and, frankly, Castillo and Farnham have less to do. Basslines are kept simple, kicks and fills are tamped down. It's the new toys that draw attention. ""Buying My Time"" revisits a harmonica riff before each chorus as Farnham just dutifully (and monochromatically) works a snare. The title track's coda weaves in blustery saxophone whines, leaving only itself and Hunter's guitar crashes to soak up all the acoustic space. After a while, the album begins to sound more like a studio playground for Hunter and his new tools than the traditional set up it so clearly wants to ape. It is, after all, Hunter's show. He put it bluntly in a 2006 interview: ""I feel like this is my barbershop quartet. Everyone has their part. We don't have another songwriter in the band and I'll never have another songwriter in my band."" The band's matte durability, its strong suit, loses a bit of its independence in Hunter's lyrics. He turns a sharp phrase-- ""I got my shiny coin and I'm getting to the vanishing point""-- but he gives so much of his lyrical content up to naked tips of the hat to other songwriters that his songs can veer from effective nostalgia into the plainly derivative. He waters down the Lizard King's imagism and fatal imperatives (""Don't try to run and hide/ There is no other side"") parrots Stax croons (""Baby doll, you can have it all / A diamond ring or a shiny car"") and swoons with forgettable mystic love (""Wrapped in white/ First I saw your eyes/ Then I saw your smile""). It's ironic that Hunter's voice gains so much from its ""classic"" richness, its hearkening back to rock giants of the past, while his lyrics often lose their way retracing the same history. And history is what is at stake here. Catfish Haven and Devastator are so counter ""post-modern,"" counter ""indie,"" deliberately and confidently well-worn, that when the sketches of American rock history lose their way, the band and its songs sounds like supporting players to gorgeous voice and a shared passion for what was.","Chicago-based bar band on Secretly Canadian adds some additional instrumentation on their second full length, but still lives and dies on the strength of lead singer George Hunter's voice.

Civil War,Dillinger Four,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05c9d034d5c69bf26d3/1:1/w_160/4fce4135.jpg,2009-02-04 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12632-civil-war/,Fat Wreck Chords,"Relative to their pop-punk peers, the Minneapolis-based Dillinger Four always seemed angrier, boozier, and too clever by half. They've found a home at the Fat Wreck Chords label and-- based on their newest, the oft-delayed Civil War, which comes six years after their last studio full-length-- they seem to have ""gone political."" Dillinger Four have been together for almost 15 years, so it makes sense that they'd start to show some signs of maturity. To that end, there's even a song here that starts slow and stays that way for almost two whole minutes. Point being, Dillinger Four are still unmistakably pop-punk, from the songs built with a few overdriven power chords to every squeaky pick scrape and ""Hey!"" or ""Whoa-oh."" And they've also managed to keep the little things that have made them distinctive over the years, from their pithy song titles and wry lyrics down to the extraneous pre-recorded intros. So if their boisterous edge has tempered somewhat, it's only a trade-off for more assured songs and lyrics about lost time that feel all the more trenchant now. The band still banks on frequent change-ups in rhythm and melody to pull in and surprise listeners. From the very first track, ""A Jingle for the Product"", there are hooks for at least four different songs shoved into under four minutes, from galloping verses to some of those aforementioned rapid-fire ""Whoa""'s and the descending twin-guitar lines of its half-time outro. While the lyrics are more politically conscious in a vague, occasionally clumsy way, they're often overshadowed those shout-along lines the band always uses as punctuation. There are songs tailor-made for lifting a beer to (""Fruity Pebbles"") mixed in with a few potshots at the rich and famous, from the obviously titled ""Parishiltonisametaphor"" to the less-so ""The Art of Whore"". And the politics are sometimes fused with something more personal: ""Minimum Wage is Gateway Drug"" is a major-key hand-to-mouth anthem that sounds unflappable and genuinely, justifiably pissed off all at once. Civil War shows a band that's matured in some typical ways-- as if anyone was clamoring for ""broadened perspective"" from these guys-- and some unexpected and not unwelcome ones. Songs like ""Gainesville"" show the advantages of slowing down and letting the hooks sink for more than a fleeting moment, from its nostalgic lyrics to the call-and-response between vocals and bass on a muted, simmering rhythmic shift. There's yet to be a good answer on how irreverent punk bands are supposed to grow up. While this kind of cautious refinement may not be the most exciting or innovative approach, coming from the Dillinger Four, it does at least seem honest.","Minneapolis pop-punk band returns with its first studio album since 2002, a politically-focused record that shades typically rowdy moments with a newfound maturity.

RTZ,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a063b1335d7bf1697fe5/1:1/w_160/cf7c3ab5.jpg,2009-02-04 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12638-rtz/,Drag CityDrag City,"Ben Chasny may not be Drag City Records' biggest seller, but more than any other artist on the Chicago label's roster, the Six Organs of Admittance mastermind seems to best embody its idiosyncratic spirit. In nurturing the careers of Will Oldham, Jim O'Rourke, and Bill Callahan, the label helped lay the foundation in the 1990s for what has come to be known as the New Weird America, yet it has upheld an equally fervent desire-- from Royal Trux to the Fucking Champs to Monotonix-- to r-o-c-k in the U.S.A. Likewise, Chasny's three albums for Drag City since his 2005 signing have displayed a similar balance of these twin affinities, infusing his meditative acoustic excursions with a magma-thick electric guitar squall imported from his sideline gig with San Fran acid-rockers Comets on Fire. What's more, after a steady stream of releases on various micro-indies, trading up to Drag City affords Chasny the opportunity to illuminate the more neglected corners of his dense discography. But the 2xCD/triple-vinyl set RTZ is no straight-forward career retrospective. Rather than present a linear overview of Chasny's pre-Drag City progression, its side-long movements are seemingly sequenced according to their degree of obscurity: four pieces (average length: 18 minutes) pulled variously from split-12"" releases, subscription-only CDs, and Chasny's personal tape stash, followed by a reissue of 1999's Nightly Trembling album, whose original release (as legend has it) was limited to 33 copies. RTZ (aka Return to Zero) is named for the reset button found on Tascam four-track recorders, the device that documented these recordings and, in light of the more singer/songwriterly nature of Chasny's recent albums, the collection is a timely, if at times exhaustive, introduction to the Six Organs origin myth. Chasny, of course, was not the only psychedelically minded artist in the late 1990s enamored with cheap home-recording technology, but where the likes of Guided by Voices and the Elephant 6 collective often used four-tracks as a means to recapture a certain AM-radio innocence, Chasny's early Six Organs recordings emphasize the medium's corrosive, claustrophobic qualities. The opening five-part suite, ""Resurrection"" (taken from a 2000 split EP with Charalambides) establishes the various modes-- a perpetual drift between lunacy and ludicity-- and fascination with Eastern mysticism that play out on the rest of RTZ (and throughout the entire Six Organs discography, for that matter). An intense, introductory flurry of acoustic plucks-- approximating the sound of a sitar being ripped apart with a screwdriver-- yields to the melancholic folk hymnal ""Bury Dreams"", which mutates into a passage of furiously strummed repetition and ghostly drones dubbed ""Resurrection Song""; ""The Gardener (For Ryan Hildebrand)"" then reestablishes the opening theme but interlaces it with squeaky high-pitched frequencies, which dissolve into the mournful, slow-picked melody of ""Her Breath, A Prayer"". As scattershot as all that may read, the piece is unified by the tactility of Chasny's acoustic guitar tones, which never fail to remind you that you're listening to human flesh scraping across steel wires coiled to a piece of wood. RTZ's other movements aren't quite so overwhelming and abrupt in their multi-sectional maneuvers: ""Warm Earth, Which I've Been Told"" (from a 2003 split CD with Vibracathedral Orchestra and Magic Carpithans) is an accelerated psych-rock raga that fades into a deservedly soothing church-organ hum for a good seven minutes. But the real prize here the is the 2002 Three Lobed Recordings subscription-CD track ""You Can Always See the Sun"", which forges a blessed union between Chasny's excitable acoustic finger-picking, electric-guitar feedback shards and mantric vocal harmonies, resulting in a slowly swelling set piece that eventually erupts into a surge of Boredoms-style psych-noise splendor. Comparatively, RTZ's lone previously unreleased work, ""Punish the Chasm With Wings""-- an alternating succession of ambient drones and guitar wig-outs-- is far less involving, and serves more as a palate-cleanser for the three-act thriller Nightly Trembling (which sports the prog-as-fuck subtitle of ""Redefinition of Being Featuring Creation Aspects Earth, Air, Water""). The piece's recurring, chanted melody relates closely to the one heard previously in ""Bury Dreams"" from the ""Ressurection"" suite, but here it accrues all the dread of a death-cult procession, with Chasny fashioning a guttural, almost campy, vocal rarely heard from him since. The middle section's chilling, scorched-earth desolation is answered by an equally disturbing third act where Chasny's strangulated vocals and squealing guitar make it sound like he's being burned alive. In one of Nightly Trembling's few discernible lyrics, Chasny is heard to ask, ""Do you know me?"" It's a testament to RTZ's enduringly enigmatic material that, over the course of two hours and six album sides, you're never really sure if you know the answer to that question.","Ben Chasny illuminates the more neglected corners of his dense discography on the 2xCD/triple-vinyl set RTZ, which takes from split 12"" releases, subscription-only CDs, and Chasny's personal tape stash, plus a reissue of 1999's Nightly Trembling album, whose original release (as legend has it) was limited to 33 copies.

Never Better,P.O.S,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a060c0084474cd0bfb66/1:1/w_160/4f28ea0d.jpg,2009-02-04 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12636-never-better/,Rhymesayers,"Punk rock is a genre that was largely formed on the mindset that anyone should be able to express themselves musically, regardless of talent. Hip-hop traditionally lives and dies by skills, and it widely rejects the idea that anyone can pick up a mic and rock a stage without putting in hard work and sweat and dedication to their craft. Any artist that tries to fuse those two worlds has to be more than aware of how tricky a dichotomy that has to be; Minneapolis punk-rap artist P.O.S. alludes to this by claiming that his performing name stands for both ""Promise of Skill"" and ""Piece of Shit."" If that's too confusing, ""Pissed Off Stef"" works fine; it's Stefon Alexander's biggest unifying factor. It could also be the biggest barrier to enjoying his work, even though Never Better-- the third solo album from the member of the nine-person Doomtree collective-- is P.O.S.' tightest album yet. Everybody's supposed to be high on hope right now, however guarded and pragmatic a hope that it is. But with a lead-off track (""Let It Rattle"") that scoffs via repurposed Nas lyrics that ""They out for presidents to represent them/ You think a president could represent you?"", Never Better sets a confrontational tone that makes the album a potentially rough listen. But that bristling anger is subtly infused with a smart-assed insight and a thing for folding pop culture touchstones into unrecognizable shapes. P.O.S.' lyrics have more in common with allusive free-spitters like Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic than, say, Gym Class Heroes-- giving you the gist of an idea while leaving you to try and calculate the deeper meaning in all the supposedly disjointed phrases ricocheting off each other. Some of the more intense lyrical moments, like ""Grave Shovel Let's Go"" (""They turning in they grave/ We dig 'em up and rearrange, aim/ Take 'em out the way they came"") and ""The Brave and the Snake"" (""Slip through the sidewalk/ Skip to the hard part/ Tip to the card shark/ Rip through the rampart""), seem to run almost entirely on the fumes of some random-thought anxiety, threatening to drown out any first-listen comprehension with a barrage of aggressive internal rhymes and his meter-defying flow. But the further you sink into it, the more sense it makes, and you're able to more clearly pick out the themes-- the recession rhetoric of ""Low Light Low Life""; the post-trauma love story of ""Been Afraid""; the fuck-what-they-think defiance in ""Purexed"". Worn ground, maybe, but the language makes it spark. And all that abstraction makes the matter-of-fact details in the autobiographical ""Out of Category""-- which takes its titular hook from Lil Wayne's verse on Birdman's ""Neck of the Woods""-- stand out a lot more starkly. When P.O.S. reminisces over his coming of age as a black punk rock kid, he captures the identity crisis vividly: ""Found his kin, brothers at school think he tryin' to rewrite skin/ Others are fools, never seen some shit like him."" As far as the aforementioned punk/rap contradictions, you might wind up forgetting that there are any in the first place. There's still some nods to punk rock, lyrically (a quote of Fugazi's ""Five Corporations"" in ""Savion Glover"") as well as in the guest personnel (None More Black's Jason Shevchuk shows up to yowl all over the end of ""Terrorish""). And ""Drumroll (We're All Thirsty)"", the most immediate, throat-grabbing track on the album, is some straight-up hardcore get-in-the-pit business that lives up to its percussive title. But the majority of the album fits a wider array of rockish hip-hop beats and hip-hop-influenced rock rhythms: ""Savion Glover"" rides on an uptempo combination of minimalist electronic percussion, splintered guitar chords, and rapidfire scratching, and there's a slick, borderline-pop sound to lead single ""Goodbye"" and deep cut ""Low Light Low Life""-- produced by Doomtree members Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger, respectively-- that pushes it to the level of college radio's most crowd-pleasing indie-rap offerings. From front to back, the album's an acquired taste, and even if it's not the big paradox that an album mixing punk ethics with rap virtuosity might risk becoming, it doesn't have a universal appeal, especially for heads leery of anything that might approach the misnomer of ""emo rap."" But P.O.S. knows this, and he's apparently come to terms with it: ""We make our own and if they don't feel it, then we are not for them,"" he sings in ""Optimist (We Are Not For Them)"". And then, almost as an aside, he adds: ""And that's cool."" He could be all things to all people, but he succeeds when he remembers who he is to himself.","Fusing hip-hop and punk, the third solo record from this Minneapolis-based rapper and member of the Doomtree collective is his tightest album yet.

The Time of the Assassins,Nickel Eye,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06413d1975652138390/1:1/w_160/dbcab16e.jpg,2009-02-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12639-the-time-of-the-assassins/,Ryko,"When the Strokes debuted, the group was often treated like a gang, a throwback to the all-for-one glory days of punk. Yet as the band stuck around that bond of brotherhood seemed to weaken, eventually turning into an ongoing hiatus. Inevitably, band memebers peeled off and formed side projects: First came Albert Hammond Jr.'s solo career; next came Little Joy (featuring Fabrizio Moretti); now here's Nickel Eye, led by bassist Nikolai (get it?) Fraiture. Fraiture recently went on record hinting the Strokes were ready to head back into the studio, which, if you believe him, only further emphasizes Nickel Eye's side-project status, if not diminishes expectations outright for Nickel Eye's debut The Time of the Assassins. The disc hasn't exactly been pressing on Fraiture-- he only dove into the project when the Strokes hiatus stretched on longer than expected. Yet Fraiture has also claimed inspiration for the disc stems from a road trip he took when he was 19. Fraiture is now 30. That's one long incubation. Well, maybe it was the lack of pressure and the entirely casual nature of Nickel Eye, but Time of the Assassins actually turned out OK. Recorded with some help called up from Fraiture's Rolodex roster, including Regina Spektor, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and members of the London outfit South, Time provides 35 minutes of disaffected, country-inflected post-punk, rock that comes close enough to the Strokes that people might recognize the family resemblance but not so close that anyone would confuse this for a carbon copy. The most immediate difference between Time of the Assassins and the output of Fraiture's main gig is the generally acoustic approach of the disc, not in the coffee house sense but in its shuffling, laid-back vibe. Even when the rhythms bounce off one another in tight, tricky lockstep, songs such as ""You and Everyone Else"", ""Back From Exile"", and the ska-tinged ""Brandy of the Damned"" are in fact willfully mellow. Fraiture dampens things down even further on tracks like ""Where the Cold Wind Blows"", ""Fountain Avenue"", and the whistle-led ""This is the End""-- cowboy songs for people walking concrete streets. On ""Another Sunny Afternoon"", Fraiture even dusts off the harmonica. Alas, the disc would have been better off had Fraiture stuck to the harp, since as a singer he's a heck of bassist. Each track bathes Fraiture's nasally vocals beneath a ton of echo at odds with the otherwise dry recording, but the self-conscious disguise still isn't enough to hide his modest abilities. As if to emphasize his inadequacies, the album's final track is a cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye""-- it's lovely, but in comparison even Cohen's famously limited voice makes more of an impression than Fraiture's own distracted mumble. Time of the Assassins could have used a few more trips to the Rolodex to bring in a ringer of a singer or two, since Fraiture doesn't seem up to the task, or necessarily even into it.","Strokes bassist Nikolai Fraiture is the latest member of the band to start a side project.

Clomeim,No Neck Blues Band,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a066ea9e61561daa456b/1:1/w_160/46c53b3c.jpg,2009-02-03 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12641-clomeim/,Locust,"Veterans of the tape-trading and micro-label cultures, Harlem septet No Neck Blues Band formed in the early 1990s and began releasing music in roughly 1995, but Clomeim counts as only their fourth proper studio album, following 2001's Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones But Names Will Never Hurt Me, 2003's Intonomancy, and 2005's Qvaris. All of the band's work is dominated by free-improv squiggle and spasmodic outbursts, but the troupe has managed to carve out unique sonic spaces on their studio works: Appalachian folk on Sticks and Stones, needling post-rock on Qvaris. Clomeim abandons those idle fascinations as the band touch on metal's sonic heft and under-surface collision. To be clear*, Clomeim* doesn't sound at all like Black Sabbath, and it's fitting that its sonic similarities to metal is found only in groups-- Om, Earth, Isis-- who stripped any blues influence from their music. No surprise, certainly, but it's still worth noting NNCK's increased use of metal signifiers: prolonged, unintelligible growls, churning bass, saturated, speaker-eating distortions. These elements are folded into NNCK's eerie cawing guitars and brittle rock rhythms. ""Ministry of Voices"" opens with a discordant, fog-horn guitar chords and free-jazz horns; five minutes in, a deep, bruised scream escapes the mix, competing to the song's end with a comparatively straight-laced guitar lead. ""Walking Wind"" is a sickly raga, its clean-channel wanderings eventually replaced by a bullying rumble. ""Salai Widnalas"" layers uncomfortably treble-heavy guitar chords over a looped, descending bass riff, both of them leaving plenty of room for caged recitations. Halfway through the album, the NNCK return to more familiar territory, trading menacing for strange: ""Make Love""'s breathy whispers act as a strange, rhythmic blanket; ""La Promesse Miruco"" bubbles and blisters, its phased guitars circling funk; ""Again"" employs a silvery guitar that continuously hints at jazz phrasings. No strangers to sprawl and churn, NNCK's treasure hunts don't always fascinate, however. ""Ialas Saladiw"" finds a weird pastoral-industrial purgatory that sounds like lukewarm Nurse With Wound. ""WOAIHB"" gropes at the upper reaches of an organ and doesn't find much besides whittled, piercing high-end. ""Silurist"", pieces of which bookend the album, sounds like an orchestra pit of drone artists finding pitch. NNCK rarely produce discrete pieces of good or bad music, so it's no suprise that Clomeim's thorny bristle pricks in random intervals, leaving you time to admire its tangles. After close examinaton, Clomeim reveals itself as a burly, chatty record from an often-cloaked band; that NNCK can draw any discernible themes from its knotty bulges suggest that they're still worthy of careful admiration.","Veterans of the tape-trading and micro-label cultures, No Neck Blues Band have been releasing music for more than a decade but this is oddly only their fourth proper studio album-- and it finds the band touching on metal's sonic heft and under-surface collision.

Eine Kleine Nacht Musik,Eine Kleine Nacht Musik,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0589d034d5c69bf26c8/1:1/w_160/52e12068.jpg,2009-02-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12628-eine-kleine-nacht-musik/,Modular,"If things continue apace, everyone will eventually own a record with some variation of the phrase ""Eine kleine Nachtmusik"" in its title. For classical buffs, there's Mozart's original, a popular serenade for strings. For metal heads, there's the 1986 live album by proto-black-metal band Venom. And for fans of electronic music, there's this loving krautrock homage by producer Henry Smithson, better-known as Riton. Putting aside his usual electro-house, Smithson mans up with an analog synthesizer and a sitar to get kosmiche in this mash-note to DAF, Cluster, Kraftwerk, and Wolfgang Reichmann. Like all modern krautrock, Eine Kleine Nacht Musik sounds dated in some ways and contemporary in others. Dated, because Krautrock's hallmarks-- rigid motorik beats, spacey synths, and intricate FX sweeps-- are so specific and intimately bound to their era. These weren't just aesthetic choices, they were informed by the limitations of analog gear: The originators pushed their tools to the limit, while Smithson imposes limits on himself by wishing away the expanded possibilities of the digital age. But the approach turns out to be modern, too, because the tacit assumption underlying krautrock-- better living through technology-- is still very much with us today. A belief in the mechanical utopia's continual progress (or, at least, the echo of that belief) radiates through every infinite pulse and optimistic filter tweak on Eine Kleine Nacht Musik. So this is clearly a nostalgic genre exercise, and it's easy to understand the appeal of this sort of regression. Limited tools whisper of infinite potential, while our broader modern capabilities seem to mock us with our own imperfections. The album is thick with longing for an era when the recipe for transcendence was simply a stark 4/4 beat and enough tape, but Smithson's enthusiasm and skill save it from being clinical or overly arch. The krautrock formula is still potent when handled with care, and here, everything's in its right place. There's plenty of contrast between taut funk and ambient space, and the non-synthesized instrumentation (including guitar, strings, xylophone, and more) adds a songwriterly dimension: ""Gotterdemmerang"" night-cruises on a boomeranging synth pattern and clipped flute-like melody, then turns weirdly organic with meandering piano and eruptive strings. Some tracks even eschew backbeats entirely, like ""Die Fontaine"", which could be arranged for solo harpsichord without much trouble. Other criteria of good krautrock are ably fulfilled: From the sizzling whistles of ""Feverprobe"" to the pitch-bent breakdowns of ""Fachgeschaft"", arresting and minute details abound. And the admirably succinct progressions (no side-long odysseys here-- the longest track is five and half minutes) pay off. Sometimes they do so in an obvious but satisfying way, as on opening track ""Ertrinken"", which moves inexorably from inert fanfare to soaring momentum; sometimes it happens more craftily, as on ""Besuchen Sie Mich Einmal"", where chaotically drifting space debris gradually arranges itself into a decisive orbit. The best thing about the album is its balance of interest and ease: Despite all of its lively variation, it seems to coast on cushion of air. It may be old-fashioned, but a little night music never goes out of style.","British producer Henry Smithson, best known for working as Riton, adopts a new moniker and crafts a loving homage to krautrock.

"The Singles, Vol. 6: 1969-1970",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a059c0084474cd0bfb53/1:1/w_160/640e8d3d.jpg,2009-02-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12629-the-singles-vol-6-1969-1970/,Hip-O Select,"It was no surprise when James Brown's band collapsed in early 1970-- its members must have been incredibly frustrated. They were at the height of their powers, a devastating live act with a string of hits that showed no sign of abating. They also had a star who was barely recording with them while he chased a badly misunderstood crossover ideal in an attempt to reposition himself as a Frank Sinatra type, and whose vacillations about what to release made Hamlet look like John Wayne. The sixth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only retrospective of Brown's singles and scheduled-but-unreleased singles opens with ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"", a surefire hit with a chattering groove that broke new ground for him; it almost got pressed before he decided to scrap it, and it stayed in the can until the late 80s. In 1969, JB covered Chuck Jackson's ""Any Day Now"" with an arrangement by his new protégé Dave Matthews (not that one), scheduled it as an A-side, changed his mind about that version, re-recorded it, scrapped it in favor of an original called ""I'm Shook"", had 35,000 copies pressed, then decided he didn't want to release it after all. ""I'm Not Demanding"" was prepared as a single twice, then canceled. ""The Brother Got to Rap"" was another funk grenade cut with the touring band, prepared for rush release, then scratched before it could be pressed. (When the band fell apart a few weeks later, Brown remixed it, faded down its on-mic references to specific musicians, and released it as ""Brother Rapp"".) ""Talkin' Loud and Saying Nothin'"", a surprisingly awesome stab at acid-rock (recorded with Matthews and a Cincinnati band that also made a dubious psychedelic album under the name the Grodeck Whipperjenny), was pressed, then yanked before it could be distributed. Meanwhile, the stuff that actually did make it into circulation often seemed like bizarre choices. The instrumental hit ""The Popcorn"" was followed by a remake of ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"" with ""Popcorn"" shoehorned into its title, then by the instrumentals ""Lowdown Popcorn"" and ""Popcorn with a Feeling"", as well as ""Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn"" and its follow-up-- the second half of the same take, ""Part Two (Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn)"". JB put a huge promotional push behind ""World"", an overwrought, funkless ""Let the Sunshine In"" ripoff (with strings), which he thought would be his big outreach to the hippies. (They preferred to dance to his good records.) The singles he actually did release with his touring band included a pair of improvised warmup jams. And damned if he didn't call it more often than not. ""Mother Popcorn"", the new version of ""You Got to Have a Mother"", was one of the hottest singles he ever made-- Clyde Stubblefield's cymbal smashes are as galvanizing as funk gets. Stubblefield's prestidigitative drum break at the end of ""Funky Drummer"", one of those wait-the-tape-was-rolling? jams, became the king of all samples. Both halves of ""Let a Man Come In"" hit the R&B Top 10. Even ""Talkin' Loud"" pales next to the hard funk version he released for real a few years later. Of all the volumes in this series so far, this one's actually got the fewest clinkers-- a Christmas single whose melody Soul Brother #1 evidently didn't learn before he walked into the booth, ""World"", another top-heavy ballad called ""A Man Has to Go Back to the Crossroads"". Even the throwaways (Matthews-arranged versions of ""Georgia On My Mind"" and JB's oldie ""Bewildered"", a duet with Vicki Anderson on ""Let It Be Me"", a six-minute call-and-response from an Apollo gig) are at least worthy of the man's sandpaper-and-lava voice. And the cuts with the touring band still glisten with power like sweat on a champion heavyweight: the jawdropping paean to male dominance ""It's a New Day"", the impossibly tense percolator ""Ain't It Funky Now"", and especially the two-part throwdown that replaced ""You Got to Have a Mother"" on the schedule, ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)"". A victory strut with a three-against-four rhythmic switchup, it was one of Brown's most bluntly political statements, but it was also a personal manifesto, and a warning for anyone who tried to get too close to him. James Brown needed other people to realize his vision, but his erratic whims were just more proof that he was running the show.","The latest in this Hip-O series finds James Brown in transition and caught in many minds, recording essential sides even when he made off-the-wall choices.

Decent Work for Decent Pay,Diplo,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05e5e6ef9596931ff22/1:1/w_160/baf81359.jpg,2009-02-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12634-decent-work-for-decent-pay/,Big Dada,"Whether you feel it's deserved or dubious, Diplo's high profile meant a collection of his remix and production work was probably inevitable. Fans have no doubt snapped these tracks up via promo MP3s, mixtapes, or their parent albums. But one day even non-fans may pull out Decent Work for Decent Pay with bemused historical interest; it's generic enough make a handy snapshot of the ongoing, internet-fueled glut of quickie rock/rave/rap remixes. Take Diplo's remix of Daft Punk's ""Harder Better Faster Stronger"". He loops and stutters a snatch of the original's robot rock, adding an off-the-rack Baltimore club beat. That's it. It's as simple, and as uninspired, as it sounds. There's no spark that suggests why it needed to be enshrined on CD rather than forgotten with last week's MP3 mixtape. Bloc Party's ""Where Is Home?"" gets fitted with the same clattering snares and acidic Ed Banger keyboards heard on dozens of similar dance rock do-overs during the past five years. If you're looking for any glimmer of surprise left in rock sonics rubbing against electronic textures at club tempos, well...sorry. Now those remixes ""work."" They're well-produced, sonically. They're generic, but not awkward. But some of the other tracks on Decent Work are evidence of a more serious handicap. Namely that, for a guy who works with so many rappers, Diplo's got an occasionally wonky handle on how to frame the human voice. On Kano's ""Reload It"", neither Kano's sluggish flow nor D Double E's double-time rhymes ever harmonize with Diplo's house-tempo breakbeat. The friction is irritating, rather than engaging, and similar mismatches pepper the disc. For instance Lovefoxxx likewise sounds either draggy (the chorus) or rushed (the verses) to fit the moody new electro beat Diplo gives CSS' ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above"". So along with a handful of cuts like (duh) M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" and the bubbleheaded Brazilian bounce of Bonde Do Role's ""Solta O Frango"", the instrumentals work best. Samim's ""Heater"" and Claude VonStroke's ""The Whistlerz"" were already blessed with hooks that verged on the annoying, but at least they're not competing with out-of-place vocals. And surprisingly, at least since I haven't listened to his 2004 debut album Florida since its year of release, it was the instrumentals bearing only Diplo's name that I actually replayed for pleasure rather than duty. ""200"", a grime-esque vignette of clonking drums and sour synth flutters, is as beguiling as Gang Gang Dance's similar London-to-America experiments. And ""Way More Brazil"" weaves together multiple layers of percussion as deftly as the most ornate classic UK garage cut or turn-of-the-millennium dancehall track. (And far nimbler than any actual Baile funk I've heard.) Like most remix comps, Decent Work is ultimately a grab-bag. But these solo tracks suggest a return to Diplo's Ninja Tune roots might not be such a bad move between the globetrotting.","This selection of Diplo's remix work-- including refits of tracks by Daft Punk, M.I.A., and Bloc Party-- highlighs a bunch of songs you likely have on MP3 or a mixtape, plus a surprisingly deft selection of instrumental work.

Years of Refusal,Morrissey,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0659d034d5c69bf26e1/1:1/w_160/717b66a5.jpg,2009-02-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12640-years-of-refusal/,Lost Highway,"Last time we saw Morrissey, on a rather slapdash Greatest Hits compilation, he was singing a song called ""All You Need Is Me"" and promising ""You'll miss me when I'm gone."" Neither proposition seemed watertight: His 2000s return to action had been welcome but rarely spectacular, and the man looked set on a twilit career of gently diminishing returns. So Years of Refusal comes as a gratifying shock: It's his most vital, entertaining, and savage record since 1994's Vauxhall and I. What's surprising is that so little seems different. The personnel are largely unchanged: backing band the Tormentors and co-writers including old hands Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte. The approach is unchanged: muscular rock with plenty of room for Morrissey to roam and gesture and half an ear on live performance. Even some of the songs are unchanged: the new tracks from Greatest Hits show up again, though ""All You Need Is Me"" is transformed by context-- surrounded by fine new songs, you notice its snarl, flamboyance, and garage rock grind. Rather than try and reinvent himself, Morrissey has rediscovered himself, finding new potency in his familiar arsenal. Morrissey's rejuvenation's most obvious in the renewed strength of his vocals. On the barnstorming opener, ""Something Is Squeezing My Skull"", he switches from fruity to fierce with impeccable timing-- the ringing leaps up the scale on ""skull,"" the matter-of-fact checklist of drugs and mental treatments, and then the break into anger and desperation: ""How long must I stay on this stuff?"" On his old album sleeves, Morrissey would sometimes capitalize stray phrases for particular emphasis-- these days, when he wants to make a point, you hear those capitals. By ""Skull""'s ferocious closing he should have won stray fans back, and he keeps the energy levels high across most of the record. Much of the album was tracked live in the studio, and their leader's vigor seems to have rubbed off on the band. Not only do the songs have a snappy ferocity, they're full of unexpected touches in the arrangement-- the discordant keyboards on ""Mama Lay Softly on the Riverbed"", or the cod-mariachi flourishes on ""One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell"". This makes Years of Refusal a rarity-- a Morrissey record you can dig into without caring much about the man's lyrics. When you do pay attention to the words, Morrissey is on typically quotable form. He long ago got into the habit of paring his lyrics down into aphorisms-- ""You don't like me but you love me/ Either way you're wrong""-- which run the risk of sounding too pat and polished: The source of much of the ""self-parody"" flak that flies his way. There's plenty of sigfile fodder here, but it's balanced by more startling imagery: ""I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine""; ""I was a small fat child in a welfare house""; and perhaps his most eyebrow-raising couplet ever: ""The motion of taxis excites me when you peel it back and bite me."" For much of Years of Refusal Morrissey is turning his fire outwards-- taking on lovers, enemies, wannabes, or some combination of all three. On ""The Last Time I Saw Carol"", his younger admirer winds up dead and Morrissey responds with detached regret. On ""You Were Good in Your Time"" he paints a mournful and wandering picture of a dwindled hero-- he knows and you know he's self-aware enough to be singing partly about himself. But only partly: This is Morrissey's most venomous, score-settling album, and in a perverse way that makes it his most engaging. Fitting then that Years of Refusal's peak is its angriest track: ""It's Not Your Birthday Anymore"" starts tender, but something callous is stewing beneath its padding drums and gentle croon. ""Did you really think we meant all those syrupy sentimental things that we said?"" sings Morrissey, before the song takes a still darker turn into grudgeful, violent sexuality. In its cruelty and intensity, it's a cousin to Pulp's ""This Is Hardcore"", and it's the most disturbing, gripping Morrissey track since 1994's ""Speedway"". Even though the album dies away after ""Birthday"", it and its more raucous predecessors suggest an artist as pugnacious, confident, and necessary as he's ever been.","Morrissey and his Tormentors continue their 21st century winning streak with a record that, while offering no new twists or surprises, finds the former Smiths co-leader in strong voice-- both as a singer and songwriter.

Parplar,Larkin Grimm,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a025ea9e61561daa44d9/1:1/w_160/1de7f1d2.jpg,2009-02-02 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12580-parplar/,Young God,"Over the course of several self-released albums, Larkin Grimm has carved a niche for herself among the freak-folk contingent-- as an actual freak. In most cases, that's an ill-fitting, derisive label for today's folk revivalists. But Grimm, who was born in a Memphis commune, looks like a Dolce & Gabbana model, writes lyrics so raw they'd make Peaches blush, and cultivates a pagan earth mother/witch persona, would be unlikely to argue with it. As much as her public self and acoustic guitar-based music reveal genuine eccentricity (would Michael Gira have signed her to his Young God label otherwise?), Grimm is Yale-educated, well-traveled and no feral naïf. Indeed, her reworking of folk traditions and the roles women play in them share core concerns and strategies with early academic feminists and the deconstructive fiction of Angela Carter, who famously re-injected blood/sugar/sex/magic into the fairy tales of those other, Victorian, Grimms. As with Carter's fiction, Grimm's music, particularly in her latest, Parplar, can be wondrous and wildly inventive, as well as self-indulgent and, well, kinda icky. Parplar's lead track, ""They Were Wrong"", is one of those thrilling numbers, a spooky portrait of loss and mental disintegration in which Grimm's voice develops a subtle shake through its stark four-minute run. ""Anger in Your Liver"", one of the short tracks clustered in the album's second half, is another simple composition with an aching vocal performance reminiscent of more mainstream Americana singers like Alison Kraus or Gillian Welch. Among the more eclectically arranged songs, the title track is a charming dish of bitterness served on a plate of whimsy-- Grimm's own tenacious ""damn the man"" lyrics serenaded by Ganges-river horns, slide whistles, and bubbly synthesizer patterns, and queasy, pitch-shifting. ""How to Catch a Lizard"" is weird (in large part due to Grimm's eerie double-tracked vocals), but effective. She can interpret folk standards just fine, too-- in the case of ""Fall on Your Knees"", as a twangy, Cajun barn dance. But the album makes just as many awkward, even confounding, moves, and Grimm frontloads it with her creepiest cuts. ""Ride That Cyclone"", with its retro Western stylings and eye-rolling double entendres, is as catchy-- and gimmicky-- as a carnival tune. ""Blond and Golden Johns"" poses as some kind of feminist re-appropriation of the old whore archetype and is stained by bon mots like ""I've been penetrated/ So I'm welcome everywhere I go"", a line one-upped only by ""Dominican Rum""'s ""The microscopic spoiled eggs inside my uterus/ Are sparkling and bursting with the greenest yellow pus."" Elsewhere, Grimm tosses off several ""Huh?"" remarks about acid rain and bus exhaust-- proving, if nothing else, that her somewhat anachronistic rhetoric isn't limited to sexual politics. Sure, there's something to be said for risk-taking. Most folkies stick with the milk-safe, hoping to get by on the sweetness of their sounds, while Grimm serves sour with courageous gusto and humor. And Parplar is a beautiful, exciting-sounding record (coproduced by Grimm and Gira), exploding with banjo, fiddle, trumpet, accordion, dulcimer, and glockenspiel, among a score of other instruments. In fact, considering much of its lyrical content, it would be far better as an instrumental album.","Latest from this eccentric sing-songwriter on Michael Gira's Young God label can be wondrous and wildly inventive as well as self-indulgent.

Immolate Yourself,Telefon Tel Aviv,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a049ea9e61561daa4524/1:1/w_160/bbb11278.jpg,2009-02-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12611-immolate-yourself/,Bpitch Control,"Hit the right couple of notes and you could convey even the most complex of feelings. Our ears are hyper-attuned to nuance, whether we notice it or not, and certain sounds can telegraph an avalanche of emotion. Enlisting this shorthand sometimes encourages laziness in musicians, but nobody minds when the results work. For example, ""The Birds"", the lead track from Telefon Tel Aviv's third album Immolate Yourself, isn't much on paper-- some sequenced synths, an insistent snare, some ghostly, hard to make out vocals-- but its six or so minutes set the stage so nicely for greater things to come it doesn't matter that there's not much there. The fact that the rest of the disc only occasionally delivers on that promise shouldn't be held too strongly against its achievements. Immolate is arranged and produced with almost microscopic attention to detail by the Chicago team of Joshua Eustis and Charles Cooper, who was tragically found dead the week of this album's release, and the emotions it evokes are undeniably effective-- and musically similar to Junior Boys or M83, sentimental groups that specialize in electronic music imbued with a certain elusive pop glow. Indeed, one of the pleasures and frustrations of Immolate is how subtly it similarly exploits the nearly invisible barrier separating song from simple synth sketch. Yet unlike the more cohesive albums from those aforementioned acts, Immolate is a one-step forward, one-step back proposition, marching in place to an internal setting somewhere between chilly background mood and something more melodic and engaging. It's impeccably crafted but oddly non-committal, pulling you in and out like a dream. Part of the problem stems from the practical matter of sequencing-- not in programming terms but simply how the album progresses. Following ""The Birds"", ""Your Mouth"" pulls off nearly the same sleight-of-hand trick, implying more substance than what's actually there, priming you for something bigger to happen but ultimately leaving you hanging. The payoff arrives with the next track, ""M"", which after its slow swoosh of a start develops into an honest-to-goodness song, with vocals, a hypnotic hint of a melody, and herky-jerk drums equally informed by the clubs and contemporary top 40. It's not a Technicolor Wizard of Oz moment, but the effect is largely the same. Something's different, something clicks, or at least clicks and connects in a better way than what came before, even more so on ""Helen of Troy"", which sounds like a great lost Depeche Mode single-- there's even an actual chorus! With the subdued but still solid ""Mostly Translucent"", it again sounds like Telefon Tel Aviv found their inner Martin Gore, and the super ""Stay Away From Being Maybe"" finds the group heeding that advice, the listening experience shifting to a more enthusiastic ""definitely."" Then, disappointingly, Telefon Tel Aviv retreat back to mood piece on the pretty but ephemeral ""Made a Tree on the World"", which once again relies too much on a few well-placed chords and the easy sentiments they suggest. ""Your Every Idol"" doesn't justify its five minutes of echoing drums, droning synths, and disembodied voices and the record closes with the relatively perfunctory title track and like riding a Mobius strip, we feel back at the beginning again. For all the pleasant stops along the way, the album hasn't come full-circle so much as spun its wheels in place.","Telefon Tel Aviv's latest-- released on the heels of the death of bandmember Charles Cooper-- is a detailed and smartly programmed reimagining of 1980s synth-pop.

The song was a pastiche of New Morning-era Bob Dylan, and Nau used it to flip Dylan's own c. 1970 script, shedding himself of the Christian folkie character he'd been playing since 2004. Nau's cardigan-wearing teenage boy contingent weren't exactly the type to yell ""Judas!"" on their blogs, but that didn't stop Nau from shutting down Page France's precious passion play with Telephone. He'd been recording on the side as the Cotton Jones Basket Ride, and Paranoid Cocoon marks the emergence-- minus the ""Basket Ride""-- of Nau's latest iteration of 60s psychedelia. Cotton Jones is Nau's vehicle, but Whitney McGraw's presence is just as strong. Together, their harmonies and trade-offs, immersed in a languid surround of smoky organs, Opry earnestness, and an abundance of steel guitar, suggest a place on the spectrum for the duo somewhere between late-60s Johnny/June and Ira/Georgia c. And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. Appropriately then, McGraw is a steadying presence on Cocoon, as Nau's muse predictably wanders around the constraints he's set for himself this time. On opening track ""Up A Tree (Went This Heart I Have)"", he drops low into Jim Morrison range, and the bluesy cadence of the song follows suit. Two tracks later, though he doesn't show up until well over two minutes into the song, he morphs the pleasant shuffle established by ""Some Strange Rain"" into what feels like a minor My Morning Jacket cut. Indeed, Cocoon's pleasantness and low stakes are its most recommendable traits. You know after the first 10 seconds of the record what you're in for, and while your mind's never blown, it's also never let down. ""Gone the Bells"" is indicative of the album as a whole: a narcotic stroll through a dimly sunlit park with no particular reason for anything that happens, save the faintest hints of romance and regret. As an aesthetic, it's comparable to an out-of-focus photo in an old shoebox, or the early morning sunrise viewed through a dew-covered windshield. But who knows how long it'll last?

It's an obvious statement, of course, for those who've followed Page France until now, not to mention one that's bit bold on a record that works so well at the level of suggestion.

Boombox,Kylie Minogue,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a054ea9e61561daa453e/1:1/w_160/44644ef4.jpg,2009-02-02 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12621-boombox/,Parlophone,"""Kylie herself could be said to look like a robot. A robot version of herself in human form, a version of herself manufactured in the minds of robots. The buildings around her might exist only in the imagination of the robots. The sound we hear, the soundtrack to her journey, might exist only inside the imagination of the robots."" This is a vision of Kylie Minogue, spied driving in the video for ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", as she figures throughout Paul Morley's brilliant 2003 book Words and Music: A History of Pop in the Shape of a City. Morley was writing in the wake of Kylie's monster hit and its attendant album Fever, both of which established Minogue as a mesmerizing figure fit for all manner of imaginings. She could be a minx, a glamor puss, an oblivious messenger, a wizened pop emblem. She could even be, as the storied post-punk critic Morley sketched in delirious detail, a worthy hero to measure against the most lionized icons of music as serious capital-a Art. Part of Minogue's pliability owes to the way she seems to recognize and understand her many various roles, but part of it owes to her voice, which is simultaneously blank and playful-- the coy coo of a character who knows that she herself matters less than what her spirit (as Morley took pains to note) ""might"" or ""could be said to"" suggest. This is the Kylie who would figure into Boombox, a collection of remixes from 2000 to 2008. Or so it would seem. Opener ""Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head"", one of the older tracks here, sets Minogue's best song against the instrumental backdrop of New Order's ""Blue Monday"". Her voice sounds a bit rootless, floundering in the best suggestive way. Listen closely and it's almost like Kylie knows she's implicitly conflicted within the rub of what plays now like a throwback to a time when mash-ups consciously toyed with the tension between source material and imaginary ideals. It's a rich start, but unfortunately an anomaly in a collection that leans more often on less-interesting mixes that cast Kylie as little more than a dance siren. She's a good dance siren, to be sure. The Chemical Brothers' enticingly gaudy and patient remix of ""Slow"" gains a lot from the sly sensuality in her voice as it stretches out, and she sounds defiantly human within the constraining squeeze of Fischerspooner's lithe electro mix of ""Come Into My World"". But too many tracks rate as generic ""club"" mixes that relegate Kylie to a mere bit player with little to say in the midst of overly splashy electro-house beats and trance-y longueurs. She sounds like a Gwen Stefani-aping cheerleader in Death Metal Disco Scene's mix of ""Wow"", and she's barely audible at all in Kid Crème's vocal dub of ""Love at First Sight"". It's as if the remixers, with so much at their disposal, thought less about what Kylie can signify than she herself seems to when adopting her own stock strategies.","Kylie Minogue's 2000s resurrection as an electro-pop superstar is celebrated on this remix collection, which includes reworkings of her songs from artists such as the Chemical Brothers and Fischerspooner.

I Think We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat,The BPA,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05213d1975652138365/1:1/w_160/b59280f1.jpeg,2009-02-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12619-i-think-were-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat/,Southern Fried,"This isn't Norman Cook's first song-based album, not by a long shot. As Fatboy Slim, he finessed the idea of dance track as pop song-cum-loop, isolating the best moments of crate-dug tracks and repeating them until he hammered them into hooks; as Beats International, he roped in a crowd of vocalists to sing their own songs and a few covers and some weird but fun throwaways; in the mid-1980s, he was the bassist in the Housemartins, who were a straight-up guitar-pop band with the occasional a cappella curveball. And now he's the central figure of the BPA, or Brighton Port Authority-- a catchall for stuff Cook does with various vocalists. They have a confusing fictional backstory involving recently rediscovered tapes from the 70s, but that doesn't even make sense: you can hear the software in every chopped-and-pasted rifflet on the record. (The count-ins at the beginning of most songs are a gag.) They're also the most referential pop act this side of Girl Talk-- although, beyond the perplexing covers that bookend their debut album, they refer to modes more than to particular songs. Every synth setting and drum sound and vocal technique on I Think We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat is a pastiche of a sort of thing you've heard before. See, for instance, ""Should I Stay or Should I Blow"", whose guest is house producer Ashley Beedle. It isn't a variation on the Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" (or Thee Stash's ""Should I Suck or Should I Blow""); instead, it's some kind of Frankensteined-together cybernetic rocksteady creature. Its construction couldn't be simpler: a spy-surf guitar sample (or quasi-sample) that serves as its intro and bridge, a two-bar cut-and-paste job of a riff that repeats for the entire remainder of the song (with some wobbling Jamaican organ slapped on to underscore the refrain), two verses, three choruses, and a faux shortwave-radio solo. The chorus-- ""Every day it's yeah yeah yeah/ And every night it's no no no""-- is lifted from a nonexistent Jimmy Cliff record. The whole thing sounds like a party if you hear it in the background, and crumbles into flakes the moment you start paying attention. One thing an album with a different singer on every track can do is make points about singing voices and what they can mean. (See, for instance, Stephin Merritt's 6ths' albums.) Bigger Boat mostly blows that opportunity-- its lesser-known singers mostly deliver by-the-numbers Britpop technique. Justin Robertson's ""Island"" sounds like the David Bowie of the 90s forgetting the words and the tune to ""'Heroes'""; Jamie T's ""Local Town"" sounds like a three-sheets-to-the-wind John Lydon forgetting the words, but not the tune, to a medley of PiL's greatest hits. Cook gets it very right a few times, though: ""Spade"", the album's other Jamaican-inspired track, presents Martha Wainwright with a phased and sparkling approximation of mid-70s lovers rock, and she responds by alternately gliding over the rhythm like a Studio One pro and clipping her phrasing to try to synch up with its twitchy reggae guitar. And ""Toe Jam"", the single from last year with the boobs 'n' black bars video and David Byrne high on life and Dizzee Rascal cramming as many syllables as he can into the middle eight, is a geeky-and-proud bonbon. Cook knows how to sequence songs to work a crowd, and Bigger Boat flows like a mofo all the way to its floor-clearing closer, a cover of Nick Lowe's ""So It Goes"" rendered by Olly Hite as the slinky come-on it emphatically isn't. But the other cover here-- the Monochrome Set's ""He's Frank"", intoned by Iggy Pop-- exemplifies what's frustrating about the BPA. The original version of the song is one of the greatest post-punk multi-guitar cockfights, so Cook waggishly boils its cross-talk down to a dopey riff; the Monochrome Set's Bid sang it as a dry-witted portrait of a rentboy who's a little bit past his sell-by date, and Iggy sings it as an amalgamation of odd phrases that don't mean anything in particular. (It doesn't help that he blows some of the lyrics: The first line of the song is ""he's got secular joy,"" not ""circular."") It's catchy; it's got a good little beat. But, like too much of the album, there's something not just dumb but dumbed down about it.","Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, returns as the central figure of the BPA, or Brighton Port Authority-- a catchall for stuff Cook does with various vocalists, including David Byrne, Iggy Pop, and Dizzee Rascal.

Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future,The Bird and the Bee,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00b9d034d5c69bf2607/1:1/w_160/284cf2da.jpg,2009-01-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12558-ray-guns-are-not-just-the-future/,Blue Note,"While it's not exactly fair to say the Bird and the Bee were born with the keys to the city in hand, it's probably safe to suggest the Los Angeles duo initially had enough connections and friends in the industry to make things at least a little bit easier. Singer Inara George is the daughter of late Little Feat singer Lowell George, while Greg Kurstin is one of those L.A. session linchpins whose name crops up in credits all over the place. If that combined background didn't earn the duo complete carte blanche, it no doubt got the group a leg up on other virtually out-of-nowhere acts. The thing is, the Bird and the Bee didn't exactly come out of nowhere so much as evolve organically after George and Kurstin first connected when the latter was enlisted to work on the former's solo debut. The project morphed into the Bird and the Bee's eponymous 2007 bow, a generally cool (in every sense) collaboration just subversive enough to reveal the freedoms afforded by industry cachet. The unlikely success of the pair's single ""Fucking Boyfriend""-- as a remixed dance hit, no less-- and some prominent song placement only further enhanced their theoretical independence. So what have George and Kurstin drummed up with their newfound power, prominence, and (relative) fame? On album number two Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future, George's winning coo remains charmingly aloof, while Kurstin's exotic space-age jazz production has stayed decidedly eccentric. In other words, it's basically more of the same. The difference, of course, is the loss of the element of surprise. Rather than spend some of that accumulated capital and go farther afield, as with most sequels the pair has instead played it safe, if always pleasantly so. Yet while the results are sonically impeccable, they're also only intermittently compelling. After a brief introductory fanfare (titled ""Fanfare"", natch), the Bird and the Bee reel us in once again with the bittersweet ""My Love"", which fuses cinematic sweep with playground jump-rope beats, sort of like a more street-wise Air. ""Diamond Dave"" immediately skirts closer to novelty, but how could any tribute to the erstwhile Van Halen singer be anything but? ""What's in the Middle"" maintains the pep level, featuring skittering percussion and hypnotic monotone vocals, with George's singing overlapping almost like a harmonious synth patch. By the down-tempo sigh of a (semi-) title track ""Ray Gun""-- the mix of whimsy and innocence, delivered with distracted daydream dispassion, like someone singing while staring out the window of a rocket ship-- starts to get a little cloying. And ""Love Letter to Japan"" is much sillier than it is clever, posing as a too-cute piece of international pop piffle, with the fluff polished to a sheen even as it half-seems to be taking the piss out of itself. The gleam of ""Meteor"" is equally blinding but also shockingly banal, its ""shooting star"" metaphor so neatly on the nose you keep waiting for a punchline that never comes. Considering the group's breezy Brazilian leanings, it's a pleasant surprise to find that ""Baby"" is not the umpteenth version of the Tropicalia standard but an equally winsome beauty redolent of a bygone age, back when a dramatic spoken-word turn could be taken as anything other than camp. In fact, any group that would give a drum roll its own title and track number must be full of its share of rib-nudging in-jokes, so it would have be nice had the group lowered the mask for a track or two and let the rest of us in on them. Indeed, ""Polite Dance Song"" would sink under the weight of all the disaffected irony (""Would you please clap your hands?"" George politely implores) were the song not so delightfully arranged, like a meeting between Fiona Apple and the Brazilian Girls. The same could be said of the 21st century update of Dixieland jazz ""You're a Cad"", which provides a litany of anachronistic romantic putdowns-- bounder, rogue, rascal, crook, ""but still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook."" It's less sly than George and Kurstin make it sound, but it could be so much more. As the disc winds down, the melodramatic ""Witch"" is no match for the smooth and sweet ""Birthday"", which percolates like the best 1970s TV theme transformed into a torch song, but the album closer ""Lifespan of a Fly"" turns out to be the perfect end to an album perhaps too self-satisfied with its own chilly whimsy. Here, both George and Kurstin finally get to tone things down, with George's voice no longer utilized as a breathy special effect and Kurstin's backing spare and cabaret singer suitable. The space and more tactile heartache in the track help distinguish it from what came before, where George and Kurstin seem so overly intent on providing ear-candy that they neglect to leave much in the way of soul. Like a Mojave Desert mirage shimmering tantalizingly before disappearing, Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future is ultimately left little more than a string of sweet nothings, there for your fleeting pleasure. It's a pop tease.","The second album from L.A. scenesters the Bird and the Bee sticks close to their original template, with more cool electro-exotica flecked with global pop touches.

Sparklace,Cale Parks,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0439d034d5c69bf2690/1:1/w_160/28478def.jpg,2009-01-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12606-sparklace/,Polyvinyl,"Hang around with bands long enough and you are bound to hear some drummer jokes. They aren't the most sophisticated expressions of humor: What do you call someone who hangs out with musicians? A drummer! Even kindergarteners can pick up on the subtlety of the stereotype-- drummers are stupid!-- but they are a time-honored tradition that must be at least as old as rock'n'roll itself. So with the announcement that the drummer from Aloha and White Williams is releasing his second album, it's not hard to hear a punchline. (What's the last thing the drummer said to his former band mates? ""Hey guys, let's play one of my songs!"") Especially since his solo debut, 2006's brainy, ambient collection Illuminated Manuscript, seemed to prove so many of those jokes right. But luckily there is something different about Sparklace. Perhaps Cale Parks is finally letting his day-job work seep into his solo career. Aloha have moved away from their vibraphone-heavy, experimental sound into sweet indie pop territory, and, on Sparklace, Parks fills in his chilly, sample-heavy ambiance with charming melodies that listeners can latch on to. And White Williams is a master of the kind of glassy, glammy groove that Parks now uses as the foundation for all of his aloof compositions. So the result is an album that maintains the cerebral focus of its predecessor while giving in to the hedonistic impulses that were missing from it. ""Every Week Ends"" oozes a wistful 1980s vibe similar to M83's ""Kim and Jessie"", complete with those big, fist-in-the-air, Breakfast-Club drums. And ""Two Haunt Me"", the disc's best song, feels like the emo-techno of the Postal Service's Jimmy Tamborello thanks to a repetitive, gurgling keyboard line, the addition of some ethereal female vocals, and a heavily sedated melody that drifts languidly over a muted recording of skittering, thumping dance-punk rhythms. Other songs feature even more addictive beats. ""A Long Time in the Air"", for instance, finds a nice islands-inspired groove, and spazzy ""Some Sew, Some Find"", with its krautpunk throttle and funky disco breakdown, is proof that if Parks allows his music to reflect his rhythms instead of fight against them, he can be a success. Ironically, given Parks' primary role as a percussionist, there is very little dynamic diversity throughout the album, with almost every song registering a languorous, narcoticized pulse. The tape experiments that bookend the collection are superfluous. And though the organic nature of his samples slightly warms up his frosty aesthetic-- Parks is actually playing those manipulated drumbeats and vibraphone clangs, not just spinning them out of synthesizers-- it often feels too detached to fully invest in. The songs, therefore, bleed into one another without much to distinguish one from another, and Sparklace feels like it's been painted in a wash of pastels without much vibrancy to jump off the page (save the practically neon-hued ""Some Sew, Some Find""). Criticisms aside, this disc still represents a huge step forward from Parks' last solo outing. There's one drummer joke that goes: What's the difference between a drummer and a savings bond? The savings bond will mature and make money (ba dum bum). And while we don't know whether Sparklace will rake in the dough, the album is certainly concrete proof of its creator's maturity. So although listeners will inevitably suffer some fatigue from so many similar-sounding songs, Cale Parks may get the last laugh after all.","Drummer from Aloha and White Williams releases his second solo offering, a departure from his brainy, ambient 2006 debut Illuminated Manuscript, that augments his cerebral beats with charming melodies and glassy, glammy grooves of his day-job bands.

You and I,Cut Off Your Hands,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a053ea9e61561daa453c/1:1/w_160/079ef2da.jpg,2009-01-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12620-you-and-i/,Frenchkiss,"Last October, Cut Off Your Hands played a CMJ showcase at Cake Shop, a basement venue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with oppressively low ceilings and the ambience of a crowded subway car. There were probably 50 people in attendance. Thirty seconds into their first song, lead singer Nick Johnston-- a pouty-handsome blond kid with wispy bangs and the lithe, compact frame of a skater-- ran into the audience. He leapt onto the bar. He jumped back onstage and ran through every lead singer pose in rock history in three minutes. The energy was equal parts dumbfounding and disarming, and it sent a resounding message: Cut Off Your Hands are rock stars. Or rather, they will be within the year, if they have anything to say about it. After a brief, uneventful stint as a Dischord-style hardcore punk band in their hometown of Auckland, New Zealand, they moved to London, hooked up with Libertines producer and ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, and abandoned their hardcore roots. On You and I, their full-length debut, they aim for a synthesis of starry-eyed Britpop with post-punk's brittle rhythms and girl-group harmonies. On lead track ""Happy As Can Be"" it meshes incredibly well: Over a down-from-Valhalla drum roll straight out of ""Then He Kissed Me"" and rumbling guitars, Johnston yelps a descending melody in his baby Robert Smith tenor that recalls ""Be My Baby"" when it doesn't echo ""Please Please Me"" while his compatriots bellow ""whoa-oh-ohs"" into the great beyond. From there, Cut Off Your Hands get more winsome (""Oh Girl"", ""Turn Cold"", ""Still Fond""), more wry (""It Doesn't Matter""), and more confrontational (""Expectations""), but, though the journey is boppy and ingratiating, they never re-bottle the lightning of ""Happy As Can Be"". It's certainly not for lack of trying: Between quoting an encyclopedia's-worth of UK guitar pop influences (Buzzcocks! The Smiths! The Jam! Collect 'em all!) they also somehow manage to lift the melody of Weezer's ""Holiday"" wholesale for ""Heartbreak"". In their slightly glib mastery of pop-song forms, and their apparent belief that great pop music can be forged through sheer force of will, Cut Off Your Hands sometimes recall Bloc Party. The difference, thankfully, is that Nick Johnston seems far more appraochable and grounded. One shudders to think what Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke might do with a song title like ""In the Name of Jesus Christ""; Johnston, in a moment of pure Ray Davies, mostly just uses it to wryly point out that his mom's best friend's husband, the church accountant, ""stole from everyone we knew."" He flashes a similar impishness on the self-deprecating ""It Doesn't Matter"", a sunny ode to his afternoon hangover that boasts a chorus nearly matching first-album Killers for swagger. Johnston might want to keep that shit-eating grin around for the inevitable indie stardom that surely awaits him; it's a good look.","After moving to London, abandoning their hardcore roots, and hooking up with ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler as producer, this spirited, young New Zealand rock band is finally ready for its close-up.

A.M.,Magnetic Morning,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a050b1335d7bf1697fc3/1:1/w_160/44e4059f.jpg,2009-01-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12617-am/,Friend or Faux,"After giving Magnetic Morning's inauspicious debut EP a thorough savaging, this site's Nitsuh Abebe allows for a little bit of optimism near the end of his review, positing that ""maybe they have the makings of a decent album tucked away somewhere."" Given the pedigree of the two more notable names involved-- in case you missed it, former/current Swervedriver Adam Franklin and Interpol backseat steady-at-the-wheel driver Sam Fogarino (now joined by the Album Leaf's Jimmy Lavalle, among others)-- one would hope something good would come from their Wonder Twins powers activating. What's offered on A.M. (just released on CD and LP after being available digitally since last fall), however, is a more elaborate reiteration of what the group, as a duo, presented on its debut. The extra wiggle room gives Magnetic Morning more space to state their case, but it's doubtful anyone's mind will be changed by what's available here. For those who hoped freeing Fogarino from his day job's mid-tempo morass and hooking him up with the guitar hero of 90s Britrock (non-Shields division), will result in volatile, invigorating rock, there's slim pickings. In that vein there's the ""Roadrunner""-checking ""Motorway"" (which features a fair amount of MBVish whammy bar abuse), and the epic fuzzy thud of ""And I Wonder"". The rest of the album takes a more stately and baroque turn. In case you haven't gotten the memo, Franklin uses a measured cover of the Shangri-Las' ""Out in the Streets"" to make it clear-- ""he don't do the wild things that he did before."" At least, he doesn't when he's not out on a reunion tour. This means, instead of more tunes like ""Motorway"", listeners get subdued tracks with extra helpings of clavinet and mellotron (like ""Indian Summer""), songs on which Franklin makes like a slowhanded shoegazer (""At a Crossroads, Passive""), or a trip-hopping track that sounds like an outtake from a second-generation shoegazing conglomerate like Doves (""Come Back""). And it also means Franklin continues to smother his smoky charisma within the mix. More often than fans of his voice might like, he's content to let his guitar do the talking, leaving his voice to murmur sweet nothings in the background as the music glitters and shimmers around him. Thanfully, the album's not a completely dour and listless affair. With Fogarino, the group has a drummer who's at once both laid-back and assertive, someone that can ground and propel these songs without overwhelming or being overwhelmed by what's happening around him. Filling out the group with more players is a definite boon, and there are enough bells and whistles on these tunes to help them stand out from each other and give A.M. some distinguishing textures (something lacking from the group's initial five-song bow). Still, there's that unmistakable ""side project"" air surrounding this record, the sense that this is just an enjoyable way to wile away time during hiatuses in other endeavors. It's enjoyable enough in that regard, but there's enough here (especially when they cut loose) to make me wonder what would happen if this turned from a pleasant distraction into Franklin and Fogarino's main gig.","Swervedriver's Adam Franklin and Interpol's Sam Fogarino re-connect after a lackluster EP and give themselves room to make a case as more than just another side project.

Stay Awake EP,Times New Viking,by: Paul Thompson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a045c0084474cd0bfb1d/1:1/w_160/e48d8f72.jpeg,2009-01-30 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12608-stay-awake-ep/,Matador,"That racket. It is what we talk about when we talk about Times New Viking: the bullhorn shouts, the buzzsaw guitars, the Keith Moon-meets-caveman drums. Times New Viking write killer punk rock with a bent towards Kiwi pop, but the thick layer of scum that envelopes Times New Viking's otherwise taut tunage is still their signature sound. Of course, it's that very racket that keeps a lot of folks away from Times New Viking. Their records jump out of earbuds, all but eradicate thought in slightly bigger headphones, and keep the cats away on the turntable. Unlike, say, Sonic Youth, who'll kick up the scuzz when the time is right, TNV tend to just let it ride, and once you've spent enough time with these kids way the hell out in the red, it's a little hard to imagine their music living anywhere else. Here we have Stay Awake, a five-track EP that follows, almost to the year, 2008's stellar Rip It Off. The songs on Rip It Off were, as ever, great, but more than the two records that preceded it, the album's dry, fat-production aesthetic seemed even more assured, more consistent, and-- again, as much as can be expected from a three-piece punk band with the will to sound this distorted -- more nuanced. Levels of scuzz rose and fell with the instruments, the occasional clean-sounding element was introduced into the mix, and for the first time, what they made felt more like a proper front-to-back record than a bunch of ripchord jams played inside a dishwasher. Stay Awake sees our Vikings moving forward on that path-- if you'd told me they were from the same sessions, I'd have believed you. Stay Awake's neither a coda nor a collection of cast-offs or curios. In just over 10 minutes, the EP not only lays out five fresh TNV cuts worthy of any of their LPs, but throws a whole lot more of that ""nuance"" business all over the place. The dirt's still very much under this band's fingernails, of course, but if whatever they do with production seemed intentional-- rather than a product of necessity, which it clearly isn't for a band on Matador-- it most certainly does now. The blanket of fuzz is just slightly more arid than the last time out, and far less encompassing, letting in a little room between the instruments and largely forgoing the pastiche of previous records for more sonic dynamism within the songs themselves. Hell, you might even pick out a lyric or two. Oh, god, and the songs. If ""Faces on Fire"" and ""(My Head)"" from Rip It Off didn't have you convinced that these kids know their way around a hook, peep ""Pagan Eyes"", a Clean-like stomper rife with organ bleats and an actual shout-along chorus. And when some of the squall dies off at the end of ""Pagan Eyes"" and you hear Beth Murphy singing-- even if you still can't quite make out everything she's saying-- you quickly realize these folks know precisely what they're up to. Opener ""Call & Respond"" veers a little close to the first couple tracks on Present the Paisley Reich and the terrific tumult of ""Hate Hate Hate"" doesn't last long enough to quite get one off, so the big prize goes to ""No Sympathy"". Opening with a quick shot of a klezmer-y sample-- uncredited, it would seem-- the track burns slowly, rolling on into near-epic length as Beth Murphy gives perhaps her most affecting (yes, affecting!) vocal performance to date. Stay Awake plays itself out in high style on bright young punker ""Sick & Tyred"", which finds Adam Elliott and Beth Murphy matching shouts as Jared Phillips' guitar reaches fever pitch. And then, when it squeals to a close, well, then you turn it over and play it again. You've still gotta get through all that fuzz to find the songs underneath, you know. A bit of advice? Don't fight it, feel it.","Neither a coda nor a collection of cast-offs or curios, this five-song EP lays out five fresh new cuts worthy of any Times New Viking LP.

First single ""Highways of Gold""-- one of the best pure punk tracks of 2008-- feels like the product of Portland-based osmosis, triggering fond memories of Dig Me Out via ex-Brother Johnny Whitney's shape-shifting voice, which crosses over into Corin Tucker territory at several points during the song. From there, the band-- which includes Jay Clark from PGMG and Blood Brother Cody Votolato-- pastes all-ages club punk, pop metal, prog, and classic rock into an incandescent collage spiked with furious lyrical streams-of-consciousness. Like the Blood Brothers, Take Me to the Sea is united by Whitney's voice, impossible to ignore as it slides between seemingly any style that could be described using the verb ""wail."" Whitney's words perfectly mirror his timbre, evoking a world of post-apocalyptic post-consumer waste from which-- evidenced by the album's title-- he desperately wants to escape. ""Jaguar Pirates"" is the best example of the album's prevailing themes; it's more or less a recruitment poster for the disaffected. Consider this call-to-arms dialogue: ""Are you broke? 'Yes I'm broke!' Are you hungry? 'Yes I'm hungry!' Are you sleeping in a ditch filled with cellulite and concrete?"" You get the point, but it's nonetheless hammered home: ""Everyone take back the rad world. Join the jaguar pirates!"" Sweet, where do I sign? On ""Georgia"", the thick organ lines and slower tempo is redolent of the blown-up R&B of the 1970s as much as At the Drive-In, with even a slight whiff of nostalgia threading through semi-clunker but still evocative lines like ""We'll swim so far in that ocean crammed with shopping carts."" A band like Chairlift sunk itself last year with a po-faced/nü age approach to this same sort of far-lefty anti-consumerism, but Jaguar's balls-out sensationalism makes it go down much easier. Sea is histrionic, that can't be argued, but it's also sentimental in parts: both for an age without rampant consumption as the prevailing mode of existence, and, somewhat surprisingly, for family. The hard-charging acoustic anthem ""Bats Over the Pacific Ocean"" opens with Whitney bemoaning being evicted, and having all his shit strewn across his front lawn. As he picks through his stuff, finding old family pictures sends him on a hallucinatory trip through the past, reconnecting with his mother at age 17 and brother (stationed in Afghanistan) in some alternate-universe backyard barbeque. From this angle, though, nothing beats ""The Man with the Plastic Suns"": it's the moodiest song on the record, essentially a fable told by a son about his hard-luck gambler of a father. The title refers to a casino owner, and Whitney paints him as a nefarious overlord, ""inventing diseases just for fun."" Getting to these themes, rewarding as they are, requires peeling back several layers of high-octane flash and overbearing pushes toward ""revolution"" (their official website is called takebacktheradworld.com, after all). It's understandable for some to stop at the positively Judas Priest overtones of ""Vagabond Ballroom"" and ""Humans Evolve Into Skyscrapers"", or even to kvetch at another record fed up enough with late capitalism to devote several songs to its impact on society. I can't say I'm immune from either of these reactions to Take Me to the Sea, but at the same time, I found myself more often than not getting swept up in the sheer intensity of Jaguar Love's approach.",,6.8,
Dream Island Laughing Language,Lucky Dragons,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01fb1335d7bf1697f4c/1:1/w_160/412adb03.jpg,2009-01-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12573-dream-island-laughing-language/,Marriage,"You often hear Lucky Dragons, the Los Angeles-based duo of Luke Fischbeck and Sara Rara, discussed in the context of Animal Collective. There are some connections: Both groups are fond of looped hand percussion, day-glo melodies, and spirited improvisation. And recently, both camps released albums that hung on techno-conceptual conceits-- in 2007, Animal Collective's Avey Tare issued backwards-running Pullhair Rubeye, which magically turned into folk music when reversed. Lucky Dragons had Widows in 2006, an album of speedy glitch tracks that transformed into something very much like Animal Collective songs when slowed and pitched down about 50% (download Audacity and see for yourself). Widows was great; Rubeye was not, and this gets at why comparing the two groups is off-target. In short, Animal Collective's project is fundamentally musical. Lucky Dragons' project is fundamentally conceptual, rooted in the broader context of the art world. Their work is better suited to galleries than nightclubs and was, in fact, included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial exhibition. To Lucky Dragons, process seems at least as important as results, and their process is heavily indebted to Pauline Oliveros' methods of turning spectators into actors. Lucky Dragons' music is inextricably bound to their other pursuits, so the album format presents obvious challenges and even seems to contradict the essentially participatory nature of their projects. Segregated from their interdisciplinary practice and audience interactions, on record their music inevitably sounds dislocated; only a fraction of the music's contextual scope is perceptible. Dream Island Laughing Language therefore sounds more like a sketchbook than an album, but it's quite rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Lucky Dragons throw a lot of stuff at the wall here; it's remarkable how much of it sticks. The short interludes are clever and seductive-- the 36 seconds of numinous peals on ""Clipped Gongs"", the mini-madrigal ""Oh I Understand"", the minute or so of whiplash interference on ""Where's Adam"". A whole album of this might have been frustrating, although there's more than initially meets the ear-- there are secret melodies stashed in precise tangles of pitched percussion on tracks like ""Morning Ritual"", ""Typical Hippies"", and ""Desert Rose"". Mysterious as they are, the set pieces work great as mortar between more realized, intelligible bricks. There are sleek beats folded in, like the vigorous ostinato on the Crystal Castles-esque ""I Keep Waiting for Earthquakes"". ""Free Guys by the Sea"", with its clattery percussion and sprightly flutes, is just a few vocal affectations away from bhangra. Electro-acoustic spasms full of cut-up singing, such as ""Wooden Cave Loop"" and ""Givers"", evoke the cartoon glitch-world of Dan Deacon. The overall impression is that, almost 10 years into their career, Lucky Dragons still haven't chosen a certain kind of cultural product to be. That redounds to their credit on Dream Island Laughing Language, where each track seems to document the group's rebirth as (to borrow from their manifesto) ""new and temporary creatures.""","Los Angeles-based duo, whose conceptual work is often discussed in the context of Animal Collective, release a sketchbook of their diverse musical influences that throws a lot of stuff at the wall; it's remarkable how much of it sticks.

Dear John,Loney Dear,by: Jayson Greene,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0519d034d5c69bf26b5/1:1/w_160/b9180385.jpg,2009-01-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12618-dear-john/,Polyvinyl,"Emil Svanangen is a cuddly compulsive songwriter from Sweden whose heart pumps pure, high-grade twee. His songs are tentative, sweet, and irrepressible all at once, and they tend to gather energy as they go, bubbling over like an endearing record nerd's barely suppressed enthusiasm for his pet band. Then, at the end, they shoot skyward, spilling trumpets, oboes, flutes, and ""na-na-nas"" all over the place-- it can sometimes seem like Svanangen was engineered in a lab by movie execs to soundtrack indie films about quirky young love. His 2007 Sub Pop debut, Loney, Noir, was charming, slight, and egregiously misnamed: Loney Dear is about as ""noir"" as a squirming puppy. On his new one, Dear John, however, he has tapped a surprising a vein of melancholy, and it suits him. The beaming, California-sunset optimism of his previous record, Loney, Noir, grew wearying, even over a short 10 songs: You can only hear someone skip through a field of gillyflowers so many times before you start groping for your hip flask. Here Svanangen struggles poignantly with alien emotions like ambivalence and disappointment. ""I used to make you songs so easily/ But things have turned so different from now,"" he laments on ""I Was Only Going Out"". It seems he went and got himself tangled up with an actual, flesh-and-blood woman, as opposed to an ideal sung to in a pop song. ""I bought a ticket to Hell when I met up with you,"" he sings on ""Airport Surroundings"", and his vindictiveness is jarring. The music, too, has become considerably darker. Svanangen still layers obsessively (he can't seem to go eight bars without cueing up another synthesizer preset), but on Dear John he avoids stacking all these sounds into unwieldy piles. On ""Airport Surroundings"" and ""Under a Silent Sea"", two of his most sophisticated productions to date, sounds pop up briefly and then disappear into the fabric, creating a subtle, shifting environment. ""Under a Silent Sea"" begins with simple acoustic finger-picking and a mournful haze of strings before a glittering trance synth hits and the track mutates into a majestically sad piece of Euro-house. If you walked into the room in between verses, you might think you had stumbled upon some brilliant outtake from 808s and Heartbreaks. Instead, it's Svanangen's record in miniature: It preserves what was fleetingly great about Loney, Noir while proving that Svanangen has more tricks in his bag than most people thought possible.","On his new album, indie-twee songwriter Loney Dear taps a surprising a vein of melancholy...and it suits him.

Sur La Bouche: Live in Montreal 1993,Superchunk,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04f5e6ef9596931feff/1:1/w_160/3cc6a1fa.jpg,2009-01-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12616-sur-la-bouche-live-in-montreal-1993/,Merge,"A few days before Christmas last year, a friend asked me to spin some records with her during a lazy afternoon broadcast on WKNC 88.1 FM, the student-run radio station of N.C. State University in Raleigh. The students were gone, and the request lines were silent. We plundered the school's music library, stacking gems in a to-play pile that grew quickly. When I found a copy of Foolish, the fourth LP from Superchunk, I demanded we hear ""Driveway to Driveway"", a strident march of double guitars, heavy rhythms, and Raleigh native Mac McCaughan's thin sneer. Halfway through, my friend grimaced: ""I just don't get it,"" she said, standing in a studio that's about 500 yards from a smal club where Superchunk played one of its first shows in 1989. ""I don't understand why people around here are so crazy about Superchunk still."" I stumbled through an answer, depending more on context than an actual defense of, like, the music: Superchunk had been crucial in an indie rock uprising that took root not long after she was born. Their success and North Carolina roots served as a crucial foundation-- or, at least, a seemingly irreplaceable building block-- for the local music scene in which we both worked. After all, Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance and guitarist McCaughan co-founded Merge Records before releasing their first three LPs on Matador. Those records found them an audience, landing the band on the cover of NME and Melody Maker. They brought that success home, releasing their later records on Merge alongside Polvo, the Magnetic Fields, Arcade Fire, Destroyer, and Spoon, among others. ""Without Superchunk, where would music here be?"" I wondered, hiding behind the easy veil of revisionist history. But hearing Sur La Bouche: Live in Montreal 1993-- the fourth release in Superchunk's live, limited-edition Clambake series-- hit me with the best defense for the question of Superchunk's staying power and relevance, just as the tape of any loud, 80-minute, two-encore set should: It's the songs, silly. Then as now, Superchunk remains endearingly devoid of bullshit, devoted to writing songs that barrel straight ahead, powering them with energy and volume. On record, Superchunk didn't divert to quirk or gimmick (see Pavement, Dinosaur, Sebadoh, bless 'em all). Instead, they played the songs, presenting them as best they could with a dose of treble on top. On stage, they did the same: At the start of Sur La Bouche, McCaughan asks a technician to kill the spotlights and dry ice. They plow through 18 tunes without much banter, delay, or artifice. They say goodnight, and they're gone. The riffs and counters of McCaughan and Jim Wilbur slice through the club: ""Cast Iron"" is a staggered, snarling beast with distorted, whining electric leads as teeth. ""Untied"" finds the right note and lets its feedback wrap around the head of the melody. The march of Ballance and Wurster inspires a dance party down in front: ""Skip Steps 1 & 3"" lunges forward only to pull back only to lunge forward, its rhythm both maddening and intoxicating. It's a wonder the pounding ""Punch Me Harder"" never inspired a riot. Superchunk's directness is revealing, since the record captures the band at a pivotal point: They were positioned to reach non-indie rock fans. Drummer Jon Wurster had been playing with Superchunk for two years, but the tunes from On the Mouth-- the band's third and final record for Matador, released just a month before this show-- marked his writing and recording debut. On the Mouth augmented that straight-charging Superchunk sound with acoustic guitars for texture and two slow jams for dynamics. Album closer ""The Only Piece That You Get"", Superchunk's catalog equivelant to Pavement's ""Here"", did both. But live, it's aching and mean, its electric guitars creeping through Wurster's cymbal destruction. Similarly, on record, ""I Guess I Remember It Wrong"" eases open with an acoustic guitar that pops into a spry jangle, somewhere between R.E.M. and Teenage Fanclub. On stage, you hear McCaughan quip ""Hit it, Laura"" just before Ballance drops a distorted bassline. The band tears through a scrim of feedback, picking up the tempo and dropping the studio's easygoing esprit. Despite making a landmark record with bigger production and more finesse, Superchunk hit the stage with the grit and grind that made their most immediate work their best. In the end, that singularity and focus-- the band's chief strengths-- will win fewer converts than, say, ""Chelsea's Little Wrists"" or ""Don't"". But there's nothing about this band to get: Just good songs about grand defiance, coupled with a spirited presentation that still surprises 15 years after one cold night in a hot Montreal club.","The fourth release in Superchunk's live, limited-edition Clambake series, Sur La Bouche: Live in Montreal 1993 finds the band endearingly devoid of bullshit and devoted to writing songs powered by things often, oddly missing from today's indie rock: energy and volume.

Mx6: Twitch's 60 Minutes of Fear / Sleepwalk,JD TwitchOptimo,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a015ea9e61561daa44b2/1:1/w_160/14f73017.jpg,2009-01-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12567-mx6-twitchs-60-minutes-of-fear-sleepwalk/,Rvng Intl.,"The first radio personality to earn the tag ""disk jockey"" didn't just play records-- he wove an elaborate illusion. Whether newsman Walter Winchell was talking about horse racers or machine operators when he invented the phrase in 1935, it's clear that the coinage emphasized a brand new skill set, specific to a particular moment in the evolution of recorded media. Winchell's subject was Martin Block, a New York radio DJ who revolutionized the medium when he began broadcasting records during downtime in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial. To keep his listeners tuned in, Block played records between dispatches, upping the drama further by insinuating that the bands were playing live in the studio. Block's gift to recorded music was to create a figure that was part storyteller, part snake-oil salesman. (It's also worth noting that Block would go on to steal the name of his show, ""Make Believe Ballroom,"" from Los Angeles radio DJ Al Jarvis; consider this the Original Sin for which every DJ ever wrongly accused of ""simply playing other peoples' records"" must atone.) A talent for mystery, trickery and control has been the crux of the DJ's job ever since, both on the airwaves and in nightclubs. But if this role has remained largely the same-- the practice of the art of catching ears and moving butts-- recent technological developments are altering the task in significant ways. The DJ's burgeoning toolbox has grown from a few basic instruments-- two turntables, a mixer and (maybe) a microphone-- to include CD players, effects rigs, and computers, tools which have led to an increasing atomization of musical raw materials. (The pre-history of these techniques is found in disco and early house, which incorporated reel-to-reel recorders, cassette players, and drum machines as means for expanding the hypnotic groove towards its infinite horizons.) Once upon a time, you needed advanced motor skills to break down a song's constituent parts and build them back up again; today, a copy of Ableton and a little preparation are enough allow amateur DJs to extract blips, beats, breakdowns, and bass lines, and reassemble them. Two new mixes from the Glasgow's DJ team Optimo-- one from the partnership of JG Wilkes and JD Twitch and one from Twitch alone-- buck current trends, avoiding traditional (and non-traditional) mix trickery to emphasize the DJ's curatorial role. What's most striking about these mixes is that both almost entirely forsake beatmatching and blending in favor of simple sequencing-- at times, to the point of letting a track play out in its entirety, complete with a slim cushion of silence before the next selection begins. This is even more notable given that the pair's previous mixes, like How to Kill the DJ (Part Two) (2004), Psyche Out (2005) and Walkabout (2007), favored lickety-split cuts and teasingly seamless blends. Both mixes are less like dance parties than late-night radio broadcasts discovered in the last quarter-hour of a long drive home-- left-of-the-dial Sirens that seduce you into an extra hour of circling the suburbs, the hidden FM messages suddenly far more important than the hour or the price of gas. Mx6: Twitch's 60 Minutes of Fear, published by New York's RVNG, is an unorthodox survey of American and UK punk and hardcore, mostly from the early and mid 80s. It succeeds by taking the only route it possibly could: to ignore any blinkered definitions of hardcore or punk. No single style, region, or era dominates, but the mix also doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive survey. A one-two punch from UK anarchists Zounds and Crass quickly gives way to the droning ""Viva le Rock 'n' Roll"", from L.A.'s Savage Republic, a group more often canonized as post-punk; later, Mark Stewart's dub-indebted Pop Group leave an augmented guitar chord hanging in the air as SoCal's Minutemen careen into the funk-inflected ""This Ain't No Picnic"". Like some mammoth un-parting of the seas, the moment is a sublime meeting of the Black Atlantic and the Black Pacific. Just after that, there's a delicious moment of friction as Hüsker Dü's ""Don't Wanna Know if You Are Lonely"" leads into Big Black's ""Jordan, Minnesota"". It's a cheeky move, slotting a song from the Hüskers' major-label debut-- the record that would lead hardcore's doctrinaire die-hards to brand them sold-out pariahs-- alongside a song from punk's cantankerous kingpin of anti-corporatism. And musically, it makes perfect (if counterintuitive) sense, Hüsker Dü's slow-fast cyclone of drums and guitars touching down exactly at the point where Big Black begin clear-cutting a swath of drum machines and guitars through through ""Jordan, Minnesota"", mapping a direct line between emo and automatic rage. There's a whole thesis on America's 80s underground in that juxtaposition alone. A goodly portion of the mix is given to what might loosely be termed post-punk, as might be expected from a DJ with a documented fondness for Throbbing Gristle and Suicide. One of my favorite chunks pairs Swans' throbbing ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" with Sonic Youth's oily, droning ""Brother James"". A few years separate the songs-- the former dates back to a 1985 session, while the latter was recorded two years prior-- but what's most surprising is how two bands with such intertwined histories could take droning, detuned guitars to such different ends. ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" is proper death disco, while ""Brother James"" is punk at its melting point, extroverted anger disassembling itself into a mercurial, interior bleed. (It's all the more striking to realize that ""Brother James"" rides a steady 4/4 thump that sounds almost techno, in retrospect.) If any ideology dominates Twitch's mix, it's a fealty to punk's experimental, iconoclastic spirit. You don't often hear about the sound of punk-- more about its fury, its breakneck tempos and its short, sharp shocks-- but leave it to a record nerd like Twitch to lend as much attention to the mutant sonics of the recording process as he does to more traditional concerns of songwriting, arrangement and style. 60 Minutes of Fear is a gelatinous mass of warped tape and weird, glassy high end; a sound fetishist's treasure trove of the accidental glories of no-fi technology. It's a particular, highly personal, gladly revisionist take on punk-- this is no Hardcore 101-- but it could also serve as a wonderful primer for anyone that didn't grow up listening to the stuff. Above all, what makes 60 Minutes a DJ mix, rather than a particularly well curated compilation, is its flow. The experience of the thing obliterates anything you could say about it, and yet, at the same time, the stories it suggests beg to be told and re-told; it's history as a living thing that demands your participation, whether it's a trip to Wikipedia or the shelf where you keep your tattered copies of Flipside. Minutemen's suggestion, ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"", takes on a whole new meaning when re-interpreted by a selector like JD Twitch, the distant discographies having become the raw material for disk jockey DIY. A companion 10-inch includes Twitch's rhythm-centric edits of songs by Zounds, Honey Bane and Flux of Pink Indians, which further blur the line between punk and ""dance music"" at its most primal. I haven't laid my hands on the actual object, but from the looks of things, the vinyl/CD package, complete with liner notes and a fold-out poster, is a thing to behold, a reminder of what it felt like to send a slim wad of grubby dollar bills to an address found in the back of Maximum Rock & Roll, and receive something like a revelation in return. The wait was always the worst of it, in those snail-trailed, pre-Internet days; you may be shocked to realize, when you finally hear this, that this is exactly what you've been waiting for, all these years. Its arrival is right on time. Optimo's Sleepwalk is different altogether. Where, until now, Optimo's mixes have retained at least tenuous footing on the dance floor over which the two DJs have presided, every Sunday night, since 1997, Sleepwalk-- the followup to 2007's Walkabout-- is a fever dream of ambient muckracking and fucked-up balladeering. ""Beats,"" in the debased vernacular of dance music, are few and far between; that the most uptempo cut here comes courtesy Mulatu Astatke, best known from the Ethiopiques series (and prime placement in Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers) should say something about the mix's profoundly narcotic vibe. This is head music, ""listening"" music, something like an alternate history of easy listening played out in uneasy selections from the likes of Nurse With Wound, Cluster, Coil, and, of course, those avant-garde stalwarts, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. There are moments that sound like background oceanscapes for run-down spas (SPOILER ALERT: they're Chris Watson, the Touch/BBC field recording artist, and former member of Cabaret Voltaire) and there are moments that sound like Rod McKuen over Wendy Carlos. Throughout, across tempos that range from the soporific to an easygoing Codeine andante, the melodic line sticks to a wormy sort of furrow, with dated synthesizers morphing into flutes, into voice, into trombones, into guitars flying 80s telltale delay, into fiddle, into still more dated synthesizers. In love with the midrange, the mix follows a line as unstably sure as the median strip on a particularly lysergic midnight drive. And having said all this, I'm actually loathe to explain any more about Sleepwalk. In fact, I'd like to propose an experiment. Buy the CD, if possible, and do what you can to avert your gaze from the tracklisting. If your habit is to immediately rip CDs into your computer, don't copy the artists or track titles. And then just live with the thing for a while. I had the good fortune to receive my review copy as a single, 73-minute MP3 with no identifying information attached, and the sheer experience of the thing, as hypnagogic as its title promised, was visceral and overwhelming, even in partial doses. Later come the reflective, intellectual surprises: this 80s throwback revealing themselves as secretive experimentalists, that Krautrock staple surely referencing magic mushrooms in their track title, and a particular (there could only be one) avant-disco figurehead dropping down in a shining beam of cello and trombone (ok, so I've given that one away-- it's Arthur Russell) at his most otherworldly and eternal and perfect. There will be plenty of time to go back and pore over the tracklisting, Google the things you don't know, find connections cleverer than any I've made here. But all of that pales in comparison with listening to the thing and losing yourself in its invented universe. This is the Make Believe Ballroom at its most credible and all-encompassing. It's an illusion you don't ever want to end.",,8.4,
How Little Will It Take,Landed,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00e5e6ef9596931fe7a/1:1/w_160/8efbaea4.jpg,2009-01-28 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12561-how-little-will-it-take/,Load,"In the late 1980s and early 90s, a loose strain of underground rock-- a kind of muscular, sloppy post-punk-- dotted the rosters of labels like Touch and Go, Amphetamine Reptile, and Sub Pop. The bands in question played metallic power-sludge that teetered on the edge of insanity, yet never collapsed fully into noise. Think Tad, Halo of Flies, the Cows, Unsane, and my personal favorite, the almighty Jesus Lizard. By the mid-90s, the sound splintered in different directions, such as the math marathons of Don Caballero, the deconstructions of U.S. Maple, or the minimalist metal of Noxagt. Excellent bands all, but less immediately accessible than their forefathers. And so the ""genre""-- noise rock? scuzz punk? garbage metal?-- faded a bit, no longer a huge attention-getter. A resurrection may be afoot via bands like Pissed Jeans and Clockcleaner, but for now the jury's still out. All of which means that if Providence's Landed had come along in the early rather than later part of the 90s, we might see them at the next Touch and Go anniversary. Instead the band has labored mostly in obscurity, forging a grimy, drooling bluster that mixes AmRep sweat with the art-howl of Japanese bands like Boredoms and the Gerogerigegege. How Little Will It Take collects an out-of-print Load LP with live tracks and compilation appearances, making a convincing case that if the Jesus Lizard ever had a proper heir, Landed were it. The best measure of a band playing this kind of simple slobber is how hypnotic their most primitive songs are. Landed consistently hit home runs on this count. Take ""Longest Winter"", which is essentially just one big chord repeated slowly and endlessly. As Rick Pelletier adds ascending snare and Dan St. Jacques screams blurrily, the track gets more and more transfixing without ever really changing. It might be odd to get philosophical about music this primal, but Landed's lumbering pound is not far from a Zen mantra-- devout repetition that over time reveals multiple shades of the same single truth. But Landed can get complicated too. On ""War / Us vs. Them (and You)"", they switch beats on a dime, adding a Black Sabbath-like chug. Later, on the epic ""Hit the Land"" they melt a proggy beat into churning industrial noise. Still, even at their trickiest, Landed sound more monster than human, never letting brains get in the way of flailing brawn. How Little Will It Take isn't Landed's last word-- according to Load, they've recently ""mutated into a breakcore booty crew with a mush mouthed grape ape singing."" Evidence comes here via a 2006 recording called ""Pass the Buck"". Crunchy and overloaded, it pulls Landed's mono lurch into the territory of Mouthus or Sightings. If this is their new direction, it may not win them new fans, but it'll surely hold onto any heads smart enough to already be along for the ride.","Collecting an out-of-print LP with live tracks and compilation appearances, How Little Will It Take makes a convincing case that Providence's Landed were the proper heirs to the Jesus Lizard's noise-rock throne.

Traitors,Misery Index,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00dc0084474cd0bfa88/1:1/w_160/0f163e15.jpg,2009-01-28 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12560-traitors/,Relapse,"For those who deride heavy metal as escapist, Misery Index's Traitors is a convincing rebuttal. The subject matter of its 11 tracks:
 
1. U.S. government deception in peace dealings with Native Americans.
2. Separation of church and state.
3. Privileged liberals.
4. A ""terrorist"" to some is a ""freedom fighter"" to others.
5. Anarchist fighters of the Spanish Civil War.
6. Middle East occupation by Israel and the U.S.
7. A fantasy about uprising by the masses.
8. ""Work your whole life, and you die with nothing.""
9. Celebrity worship.
10. The world is going to hell.
11. State-sponsored torture in secret locations.
 
Whole Foods this is not; Misery Index's brand of progressivism is decidedly bleak. (One song on Traitors, though, is almost upbeat in its defiance: ""This land is fucking your land/ And not through them defined/ By fucking flags on SUVs/ or Super Bowl halftimes."") The band began in 2001 when half of the similarly political Dying Fetus seceded. Early efforts sounded like Terrorizer covering Slayer; in recent years, the band's sound has slimmed down to a precise, melodic blend of death metal and grindcore. Unlike colleagues Brutal Truth or Napalm Death, Misery Index have grown less experimental over time. They rely on standard minor scales with occasional flatted seconds and fifths for color. The message is progressive, but the sound is conservative.
 
It hits hard, though. Recording engineer Kurt Ballou dials in a sound falling somewhere between ""battering ram"" and ""machine gun."" Adam Jarvis' drumming is astonishingly athletic; he propels otherwise slow half-time passages with helicopter rotor kicks. In the title track, he rotates fluidly between thrash polka and clattering blastbeats. The riffs are streamlined and hefty. A few ornaments add texture-- stinging string rakes in ""Ghosts of Catalonia"", black metal-esque jangles in ""Partisans of Grief"". Bassist/vocalist Jason Netherton sounds like a very angry man; he pulls no punches at his political blog, www.demockery.org.
 
Despite its blunt force, this record is a thought-provoking package. In the liner notes, Netherton accompanies each song with a famous quote. For example, there's Albert Einstein's ""Never do anything against conscience"" line, and Nietzsche's oft-cited saw about gazing into an abyss. Such invocations could come cheaply, but they match the songs. They also add depth to the polemics, though Netherton can turn a good line himself. (On Hollywood celebrities: ""They are ink and pixels... yet they walk the earth as gods."") Relapse graphic designer Orion Landau pairs the text with politically charged montages indebted to antiestablishment artists John Heartfield and Larry Carroll. These polarized times call for constructive discourse. But if Misery Index can destroy the opposition six ways 'til Sunday, so be it.","Misery Index's latest album wraps the band's precise, melodic blend of death metal and grindcore around a progressive political message.

On 2003 debut album Love, Love, Love, the Portland, Ore. duo of Ida No and Johnny Jewel caught the no-wave wave; back then, they had a drummer named Ginger Peach. Since moving to Italians Do It Better and focusing on dark-alley Italo disco, they've released upwards of three dozen tracks spread out across 2007's occasionally great but overrated B/E/A/T/B/O/X, the same year's excellent After Dark compilation, a couple of killer 12""s, a few 7""s, and now ""singles, B-sides, and rarities"" disc Deep Gems. After you throw out alternate mixes, godawful skits, and a reworking of their 2005 reworking of ""Iko Iko"", you're left with at most 22 discrete Glass Candy songs-- only 19 originals. Even then, the quality has been mixed. Few bands really need a rarities collection. Glass Candy aren't one of those bands. Although Deep Gems maintains the after-hours glide of Jewel's recent work for Glass Candy or labelmates Chromatics, along with No's heavy-lidded Debbie Harry purr, it underscores just how few essential tracks Glass Candy have made so far. A hypnotic melody, murky bassline, and echoey keyboard splash-pulse help make ""Animal Imagination"" the most interesting ""rarity,"" but the lyrics would embarrass ""Celebration of the Lizard""-era Jim Morrison, and it shows up again, in an abbreviated lo-fi version, as ""Soft Boundaries"". Also pleasant enough is ""Geto Boys"", the aforementioned ""Iko"" update, a worthwhile purchase for anyone clamoring to have Glass Candy revisit the Mardi Gras favorite over the Geto Boys' 1991 hip-hop classic ""Mind Playing Tricks on Me"" (and who hadn't already downloaded the track's widely posted free ""MySpace Demo"" version). Belle Epoque cover ""Miss Broadway"", one of Glass Candy's best tracks alongside the 12""-only ""I Always Say Yes"" and B/E/A/T/B/O/X's ""Rolling Down the Hill"", is still decent in an unnecessarily busy, demo-ish ""Ms. Broadway (Remix)"" form. ""Poison or Remedy"" is just a cheap-sounding version of B/E/A/T/B/O/X's ""Beatific"". If you paid 99 cents for it on iTunes because you thought it was a new song, I'm sure Glass Candy are sorry. Outside of its self-cannibalizing standouts, Deep Gems tends toward the sort of the sort of forgettable nu-disco synth noodlings that shouldn't make the cut for a proper album. The best of the rest: ""Feeling Without Touching"", with its chirpy ""Da Da Da""- or ""Fortress/Deer Park""-esque synth repetitions, and ""The Beat's Alive"", where No emits high-pitched squawks over uptempo handclaps. ""Theme From Deep Gems"" is a minute-and-a-half synth-orchestral piece fit for a lesser Stanley Kubrick score. Finale ""Silver Fountain"" is seven minutes of slow-motion keyboard drones, multi-layered percussion, and raygun noises, with No occasionally murmuring about and/or moaning about ""misty mountains"". Where B/E/A/T/B/O/X opened with a lame exercise-instructor skit, Deep Gems starts with the Glass Candy equivalent of a telephone error message. Glass Candy may be busy finishing up their next album, but that doesn't mean we all have to act like being put on hold is the same as having a good conversation.","A ""singles, B-sides, and rarities"" disc, the latest from Italians Do It Better linchpin Glass Candy suggests that not every band needs an odds'n'sods collection-- at least not this early into its career.

Skin of Evil,Blackout Beach,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a044c0084474cd0bfb19/1:1/w_160/5057ff8e.jpg,2009-01-28 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12607-skin-of-evil/,Soft Abuse,"As the brains behind the tongue-twisting pop shards of Frog Eyes and (with Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Wolf Parade/Sunset Rubdown's Spencer Krug) one-third of Swan Lake, Carey Mercer's wordy lyrical conceits often meet his aural ambitions head-on. Classical phraseologies are bleated over serpentine arrangements; the results are often as confounding as they are strangely appealing. You could liken it to a very abrasive book on tape. As Blackout Beach, Mercer retains that same attention to scope and language. That project's 2004 debut, Light Brings the Putrid Dawn, was an admirable albeit disorienting trip, with song contours often aimless or difficult to follow. As Mercer wrote in a note to Pitchfork a few months back, Skin of Evil is his attempt to stay on task. Here he's succeeded: Using minimal instrumentation-- itchy drum machine, ripples of guitar-- and sounding like Nick Cave or Scott Walker, Mercer's crafted a loose concept album about a siren named Donna and the many men left wrecked in her wake. It sounds like another academic exercise, but it's at once gloriously claustrophobic and engaging from start to finish. Mercer introduces his subject on first single and opener ""Cloud of Evil"": ""I think there was men before me, who were too scrambled by Donna's awesome, awesome power. But did any of them ever fly?"" Moving forward, there's mention of blood-filled goblets and castration, though neither Mercer's trademark delivery nor his grand poetics ever threaten to upset the sonic universes into which he catapults them. Skin of Evil's textures and rhythmic bend exist in eerie harmony with his cries, barks, and stutters, with each chapter swimming seamlessly into the next. All in all, this is a remarkable feat in atmospherics. From the storms of standout ""Three Men Drown in the River"" to the crescendo of ""Nineteen, One God, One Dull Star"", Mercer's able to fill cavern-like spaces with the might of his many soliloquies. Easy listening or not at all, it's why Skin of Evil-- here and gone in just 30 minutes-- remains so gripping: Some turns are capable of provoking a physical reaction. Some aren't. But no matter how off-kilter the sense of theater or disturbing the image, he and his listeners remain in constant, enveloping conversation.","As Blackout Beach, Carey Mercer (Frog Eyes, Swan Lake) retains his careful attention to scope and language but here stays on task and creates something gloriously claustrophobic and engaging from start to finish.

Hot Chip with Robert Wyatt and Geese,Hot Chip,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04e5e6ef9596931fefd/1:1/w_160/e9c577d9.jpg,2009-01-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12615-hot-chip-with-robert-wyatt-and-geese/,EMI,"On a ranked list of unlikely collaborations, Hot Chip and Robert Wyatt would probably place just above the Decemberists and Hinder, just below Philip Glass and DJ Drama. The mystery isn't why Hot Chip would jump at the chance to work with Wyatt, an avant-music elder statesman since founding the seminal prog-rock band Soft Machine 40-odd years ago, but why Wyatt, who's collaborated with established titans like Brian Eno and David Gilmour, would be interested in a young and (relatively) untested electro-soul band. They even look odd together-- Wyatt with his wild white mane and beard, Hot Chip with their cable-knit sweaters and chunky glasses. It's as if mighty Zeus split open Cronus' stomach and released a gaggle of nerdy-chic reference librarians. But it makes perfect sense once you hear the music. On a pragmatic note, this EP came about simply: Hot Chip remixed Wyatt's patricianly funky song ""This Summer Night"" (a collaboration with Bertrand Burgalat) as a minimal electro seether. They contacted Wyatt, who liked the remix, and asked him if he'd like to cover any of their songs. Wyatt chose four, and entered the studio with Hot Chip to record new versions of three. The fourth, ""One Pure Thought"", was remixed by Geese, which comprises two members of Elysian Quartet, who also lend imperious strings to the ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" cover. On the aesthetic end, Wyatt's voice (he duets with Alexis Taylor on ""Whistle for Will"" and ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"", and provides off-kilter vocal architecture elsewhere) has a soft-bellied vulnerability to rival Taylor's, and his accessible out-music touches breathe new life into Hot Chip's arrangements. Take ""Made in the Dark"", the first song to be released from the collaboration. It was already one of the latest Hot Chip LP's strongest tracks, and Wyatt improves it by retaining Taylor's indelible vocal melody while jettisoning the soft-rock arrangement in favor of something much livelier, something that feels organic without resorting to folksiness. It's spacious and strange, its aching chord progression dressed in melancholic horns and toothsome harmonies by Wyatt. A mouth harp responds to the lead vocals' calls, achieving the tricky feat of being amusing and sonically compelling at once. It also seems to somewhat cheekily allude to the current craze for digitally mediated vocals, positing the mouth harp as a proto-vocoder. Quirky yet approachable touches like this define the EP. Wyatt is just as good at revivifying Made in the Dark's slighter songs, like the sultry ""Whistle for Will"". The original had the barest intimation of a beat and an unclear melodic progression, like rain disturbing a puddle. Wyatt draws its form into sharp relief, piling on honeyed strings and rooting them to a cavernous backbeat. ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" recapitulates the formal inventiveness of ""Made in the Dark"", opening with a flurry of reversed sounds and clipped breaths, then resolving into a harmonious braid of independent parts-- strings bowed and pizzicato, genial whistles, cut-up vocal palimpsests. Its cacophonous conclusion is the only instance of Wyatt sacrificing clarity for obscurity on the EP, and it works well as such an isolated counterpoint. And Geese do a ground-up overhaul on ""One Pure Thought"", dropping a part of its vocal line into what sounds like a tangle of layered kalimba and halting strings. At a time when many albums contain an EP's worth of ideas, an EP containing an album's worth is a nice change of pace. Collaborations between obviously comparable artists tend to be somewhat handcuffed: Listeners understandably expect a certain kind of result. The unlikelihood of the Hot Chip/Robert Wyatt connection gives this EP a sense of unfettered freedom, and of generosity-- it's a fan service for adherents of each contributor, and best of all, you can download a couple of the tracks for free from Hot Chip's website. Hot Chip gains cultural capital by working with a legend, Robert Wyatt gets a dose of youthful energy, and we're left with the feeling that popular music could be more exciting all around if more artists were willing to collaborate outside of their commercial niche, producing wonderfully inessential labors of love. Suddenly, a ""Music in 12 Parts"" mixtape (with cameos by Lil Wayne, Ludacris, and Michael Nyman) sounds almost plausible.","Hot Chip draft avant-music elder statesman Robert Wyatt-- and Geese; don't forget Geese-- to re-imagine a quartet of their own songs, giving the band cultural capital by working with a legend, while Wyatt himself gains a dose of youthful energy.

Flower of Evil,Susanna,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00ab1335d7bf1697f22/1:1/w_160/a8de12c7.jpg,2009-01-27 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12557-flower-of-evil/,Rune Grammofon,"There's a certain amount of hubris inherent in every covers record. Surely many if not most begin quite innocently, like a fan letter to a favorite act. But the implication is still that the singer or band thinks that they can bring something new to someone else's song or performance. Perhaps they feel that they can even make the song better. The fact that this rarely happens apparently deters no one. ""Playing covers... is not the same as, say, recording your favorite songs of all time,"" elaborated Norwegian singer Susanna Wallumrod when an interviewer from The Guardian asked about her propensity toward re-imagining the songs of others. ""That wouldn't be interesting. It is about trying to make good music of your own."" Truth be told, Susanna's strategy to date has largely been about making someone else's good music her own. Susanna and the Magical Orchestra's first album, 2004's List of Lights and Buoys, featured a couple of covers, including a morphine-slow take on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"". But 2006's Melody Mountain was comprised of nothing but covers, including such ringers as ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the umpteenth recording of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"". These less adventurous selections were offered along with more eclectic stabs at the likes of AC/DC, Prince, and, um, KISS. And 1980s KISS, no less (though if you want to pick a song to make better, you couldn't do much better-- which is to say worse-- than ""Crazy, Crazy Nights""). In 2007, Wallumrod-- sans former Jaga Jazzist keyboardist Morten Qvenild, aka the Magical Orchestra-- emerged with the album of originals Sonata Mix Dwarf Cosmos. But she's back to her old tricks with her second solo disc Flower of Evil, another collection of radically rearranged covers. Well, mostly covers. Susanna slips a couple of originals onto this disc, too, but ""Goodbye"" and ""Wild Is the Will"" tend to blend right in, so thoroughly does Susanna adapt each chosen song to her particularly despondent milieu of dramatic piano and spare accompaniment by pals Helge Sten and Pål Hausken. Frankly, it's hard to tell what we're meant to take away from Wallumrod's introductory take on Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"", no matter how heartbreaking she makes it, especially when she's backed by the master of malleable sincerity himself, Mr. Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. Will Oldham turns up again later as duet partner on Badfinger's ""Without You"", and his own ""Joy and Jubilee"" gets the Susanna treatment, too. It's a great fit, brittle and beautiful in all the right places, getting to the heart of Oldham's song in a way that the elusive songwriter himself sometimes disallows. A few other tracks prove apt fits as well, particularly Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"", Roy Harper's ""Forever"", and Nico's ""Janitor of Lunacy"", songs you'd think couldn't get any more melancholy or morose...until they do. Black Sabbath's ballad ""Changes"" especially benefits from its new setting, not to mention Susanna's female touch, as does Tom Petty's ""Don't Come Around Here No More"", plucked from its 80s trappings and remade as a funereal hymn. Fresh readings of Prince's forgotten Lovesexy track ""Dance On"" and ABBA's ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" highlight the strength of lyrics too often subsumed by each respective original song's ace production, even if in the latter case, the original Eurodisco trumps Susanna's Eurodirge. Yet whether you're Chan Marshall, Mark Kozelek, or Susanna, when a cover goes beyond mere interpretation to outright reinvention, it does raise a question: If you're going to radically change a song until it's virtually unrecognizable, why not go all the way, write new lyrics, and call it something else? Revisiting Lou Reed's Transformer nugget ""Vicious"" as a piano ballad or ""Can't Shake Loose"" (a solo hit for ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog) as chamber gloom unfortunately further amplifies the perils and pointlessness of this kind of novelty. Sure, recontextualizing songs can sometimes reveal something new about the source material. At least that's what the most gifted interpreters accomplish. But in Susanna's case, more often than not, the literal meaning of the lyrics is left intact after all else has been jettisoned. With every track projected through the same spectrum of depression, sadness, and misery, the song becomes unimportant and we're left only with her affected, ultimately monochromatic approach. As morbidly effective, thoroughly gorgeous, and sometimes wrenching as the results may be, in the end Susanna simply doesn't own these songs. She smothers and snuffs them out like a candle.","Susanna (sans her Magical Orchestra) tackles another slate of cover songs comprising unlikely selections from Tom Petty, Thin Lizzy, ABBA, and more. Will Oldham duets on several tracks, including a version of his Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy song ""Joy and Jubilee"".

The Thrush,Chandeliers,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01bb1335d7bf1697f43/1:1/w_160/b62bb1eb.jpg,2009-01-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12570-the-thrush/,Obey Your Brain,"While there's not a deafening public outcry for mostly instrumental Moog-laden space-funk right now, Chandeliers breathe new life into some familiar sounds on their debut, The Thrush. Members of stalwart Chicago acts like Mahjongg, Icy Demons, and Mucca Pazza lend their talents to the group, and they manage to borrow elements from all without sounding anything like these precedents. With the mysterious echo of vibraphone, the studious pitter-pat of fluid basslines, sophisticated rhythms, and chilly and cerebral atmosphere, it's sound and feel will be familiar (especially to native Chicagoans), but this is more insistent and less heady-- Chandeliers mostly want you to dance, in your own stilted, highly disciplined way. Mechanical chirps and machine-like bass keyboards lean on some busy but very human drum work on opener ""Mr. Electric"", a track full of dropped beats and rhythmic twists and turns that amidst its steady momentum and progressively more layered and melodic keyboards. Watery tones play repetitive, circular themes over the stiff funk of the brief ""Maldonado"", but ""Mango Tree"" sticks around long enough for a few different modes: hushed percussion and nearly whispered vocals before, slick Ray-Ban-ready keyboard melodies, and cartoonish day-glo funk. The electronic tones of tracks like ""Big League"" fall into place like pistons in an engine, while both muttered vocal suggestions and subtle horn accompaniment color the moderate groove of ""Gold Rush"" as it quietly builds towards its ascending melody. The bass is deeper and the vibe darker on ""Bamboo"", while it's springy keyboard tones retain a smirk while it's echo-laden vibraphones add unexpected texture-- though by the record's end, a little guitar and junkyard percussion doesn't do much to spice up the sparse ""Graffiti"", and the loopy march of ""Body Double (UK Mix)"" only raises the record's pulse slightly. The final moments of The Thrush maintain a vibe and atmosphere at the cost of growing repetitive. While it's only steps away from post-rock, Chandeliers have taken these elements their own way for a more distinctive whole, and a surprisingly cohesive album. It's both moody and danceable, but far more of the former.","Members of stalwart Chicago acts like Mahjongg, Icy Demons, and Mucca Pazza come together to create mostly instrumental Moog-laden space-funk.

Artifacts,Aether,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a018ea9e61561daa44ba/1:1/w_160/6b4f714f.jpeg,2009-01-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12569-artifacts/,Exponential,"Remember the Mo' Wax aesthetic? I kind of miss it. Their early-to-mid-1990s vanguard of instrumental downtempo breakbeat peaked with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing... and, much like jazz fusion, their hip-hop fusion had a brief window of innovation followed by a period of watered-down stagnancy. But fond memories of Headz have a way of coming back to you, and the urge to listen to psych-prog noodling and ambient/illbient trip-out jazzbo riffs over heavy Class of '88 boom-bap breaks is going to need to get fulfilled sooner or later. And with Shadow gone halfway hyphy, RJD2 turned into a twee Stevie Wonder, and Diplo getting most of his artier tendencies out of his system with Florida over four years ago, that urge has gotten harder to sate as of late. This, then, should tide you over fine. Aether is one of several projects from San Antonio musician and graphic designer Diego Chavez, who has a couple of backup aliases (Otic Angst; A.M. Architect) in case one of the eight other groups out there operating under the name Aether sends a cease-and-desist. And within the first 13 minutes of Artifacts, his first full-length release as Aether, that familiar blunted vibe you might remember from those old UNKLE tracks you bumped 12 years ago comes creeping back in. Opener ""Forgive Me"" pulses its way into melancholy, electric piano-driven life like a wintry cousin to one-beat wonder Peter Panic's production on Jay-Z's ""Regrets"", and subsequent sounds-- the head-nodding sparkle of ""Dejame Dormir"", the stomping orchestral b-boy sweep of ""To Her"", the combination of hard, skittering beats and aloof folk-pop on ""Anywhere""-- reveal a simultaneous impulse towards percussive force and delicate, occasionally baroque melodic flourishes that give Artifacts a high-contrast personality. Those first 13 minutes, interestingly enough, comprise nearly a third of the entire album's length. Artifacts lacks the slow-build, long-drive sprawl of its mid-90s progenitors in favor of a more concise approach that shares a similar ear for the brief interlude-turned-song as Boards of Canada, moments which play out briefly between the margins of more extensive musical concepts. But while Artifacts throws its songs at you short and quick, they're all interlinked in an album-length ebb and flow that's smartly paced and meant to be a quickly shifting exercise in mood alteration. It's fitting enough that the only tracks that break the four-minute mark come at the album's midpoint peak (the disco-paced, borderline-Bollywood ""Orfeu Negro"") and the very end (""Makeshift Sanctuary"", which quotes lyrics from A Tribe Called Quest's ""Get a Hold"" over minimalist piano and maximalist drums). How's that for mid-90s revivalism-- an album best listened to front-to-back.","Bringing back the blunted mid-1990s aesthetic of labels like Mo' Wax, San Antonio producer Aether also exhibits a flair for economy on this smartly paced and and quickly shifting exercise in mood alteration.

Gutter Tactics,Dälek,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03513d1975652138320/1:1/w_160/2c759ecd.jpg,2009-01-27 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12595-gutter-tactics/,Ipecac,"In 2008, few things pushed the buttons of American insecurities more effectively than the sermons of Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Forget that most of the speeches the media and political opponents of Barack Obama got hysterical over were made years ago, in 2008 Wright was your bogeyman, and news coverage ensured his ""God damn America!"" refrain will echo down through the ages. Wright caused millions of knees to jerk with those words when they were dug up and aired, but I've thought all along that he got a bum deal in a media that wants to smack you with a sensation and would prefer it if you didn't bother to think deeply. That's not to say that I think America should go straight to hell of course, but I at least think his comments come from somewhere intellectually and emotionally honest, and taken in their context-- whether you believe Wright is a raging, aging relic, a traitor, or a righteous prophet-- are a powerful exercise of the First Amendment. The duo behind Dälek apparently agrees, as Dälek (the MC the band is named for) steps back and gives the opening verse on Gutter Tactics to the Reverend, playing a long excerpt of a sermon in which he enumerates a series of American atrocities against Native Americans, blacks, and others, riding a slow crescendo in which he reminds his parishioners that many of the people who die under our bombs are just ordinary folks trying to live their lives and put food on the table. Listening, I think it's not so much the content of his message that makes us shift in our seats so much as the bluntness and lack of a leavening agent, the part where he says, ""Well, America has its faults, but when you get right down to it it's a pretty great place."" He never provides the counterargument, and in that respect, he could probably join Dälek full-time, because verbal bluntness and sonic brutality are basically their stock in trade. To Dälek and the band's producer half, Oktopus, dystopia isn't some abstract future; it's what we're living in right now, and though I'm sure that on at least some level they were happy to see a member of a minority elected President, they aren't letting on here. They say as much on ""No Question"", Dälek rapping, ""A black president don't ensure the sunshine/ A rich president represent his own kind/ As it stands now, the blind lead the blind."" Even if you don't share their cynicism, the conviction of the delivery sells it anyway-- Dälek are as methodically effective as ever, their signature blend of simple beats, carefully sculpted noise, and straightforward flow still highly unique after more than a decade. The vocals and lyrics, as always, play a much more secondary role than in basically any other rap group, with the little bits that stand out coherently above the mix providing about all the parts of the picture you need to construct the whole. ""Los Macheteros/Spear of a Nation"", for instance, calmly chronicles the injustices delivered upon Nelson Mandela by the Apartheid government of South Africa amid a hellstorm of processed drums and cascading sheets of feedback, with bits of muffled dialogue and South African choral music crying out from the depths. On the other side of things, ""A Collection of Miserable Thoughts Laced With Wit"" is actually quite pretty, dappling an echoing beat with smears of backward keyboard and piano. The vocal is buried and processed, used more as a rhythmic tool than a lead or focal point. While the intensity of their earlier records is still mostly intact, Dälek have hit on a more spacious, open method for arranging their sounds, so that even a pounding dirge like ""Who Medgar Evers Was..."" feels more inviting than assaultive. There's no ""Black Smoke Rises"" endurance test here. Of course, it wouldn't be a Dälek record without at least one track decrying the state of hip-hop, and ""We Lost Sight"" provides that. Still, I've never bought the idea that Dälek was rap for people who hate rap. Some people who aren't normally crazy for hip-hop will undoubtedly enjoy this album, but I think it's primarily for people who believe that hip-hop is a broad canvas that demands people who color in the fringes, and Dälek do that, musically and politically. The opening Wright sample is a hard look back at a year most people would already rather forget, but it's a perfect intro for Gutter Tactics, an album that draws much of its strength from the same well of outrage and disaffection.","Ipecac indie hip-hop group return with another set of verbal bluntness and sonic brutality, helping to color the fringes of rap with musical and political gusto.

Working on a Dream,Bruce Springsteen,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04db1335d7bf1697fbd/1:1/w_160/d2072048.jpg,2009-01-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12614-working-on-a-dream/,Columbia,"Working on a Streak is more like it. First, there's that Golden Globe for ""The Wrestler"", then a performance at the We Are One concert at the Lincoln Memorial, a handful of Grammy noms for a two-year-old song, a greatest-hits package exclusive from Wal-Mart, this weekend's Super Bowl halftime show, and a just-announced reissue of Darkness on the Edge of Town. So that Oscar snub can't sting too much. In the middle of a pretty amazing month, Bruce Springsteen is releasing his 16th studio album, one whose title sounds more like a campaign slogan than a rock record. Maybe that's intentional: After spending much of this decade playing up to listeners' notions of post-9/11 recovery and conjuring up bleak visions of Bush-era America, the Boss settles into some sense of contentment on Working on a Dream, as if that Dream had already been achieved. In this regard, the album sounds like the final installment of a trilogy he began with The Rising in 2002 and continued with Magic in 2007-- ignoring Devils & Dust, which isn't hard to do, and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, which remains his best and most freewheelin' late-career album. Tracing his personal-- and, arguably, our national-- mood from wounded to outraged to somewhat contented, these albums are linked by Springsteen's ongoing collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien, whose work has grown increasingly capable and adventurous with each release. Despite removing any trace of regional shuffle from these songs, O'Brien puts them across like the proficient bar band they are, roaring through ""My Lucky Day"" and ""What Love Can Do"" with professional abandon. O'Brien erects an impressive 1960s wall of sound on ""Surprise, Surprise"", with its carnivalesque organ and girl-group backing vocals, and in general he streamlines the E Street Band's sound to highlight one central melody or riff. Opener ""Outlaw Pete"" rides an ascending/descending theme not dissimilar to KISS' ""I Was Made for Loving You"". Strings protrude from the song at odd angles, Springsteen's vocals echo through what sounds like a deep valley, and Roy Bittan contributes a hyperactive organ as the song spins a yarn about an outlaw so vague he sounds only theoretical. The track is overstuffed with ideas, and at eight minutes, it's a strange, ineffective opener, setting a curiously detached mood for an album that is, for Springsteen, typically engaged. Of his three E Street Band releases of the 00s, Working on a Dream is the one that most sounds like a solo album, indulging a range of ideas that reveal Springsteen as still musically curious and more than willing to play around with his sound. Another American rock saint-- Brian Wilson-- shows up in the walking bass line on the title track as well as in the Pet Sounds percussion and ba-ba-ba's of ""This Life"". The scribbly guitar on ""Life Itself"" recalls the Byrds on ""Eight Miles High"" more than Nils Lofgren or Steve Van Zandt, providing a tense backdrop for Springsteen's pleading lyrics. The garbled-blues ""Good Eye"", one of the album's weirdest tracks, ratchets Springsteen's distorted vocals to a yelping beat and electrified banjo, but like his recent one-off download ""A Night With the Jersey Devil"", it feels like merely a demonstration of studio technique. Working on a Dream works hard on sound, but sleeps on actual songs. ""Queen of the Supermarket"" may be the worst thing he's ever written, an overly symphonic ballad about crushing on the stock girl. It's sweet, but there's something about the high-flying strings and the intensity of the imagery (""A dream awaits in aisle number two"") that suggests parody. The checkout beeps that help the song out to its car certainly don't dispel the wink. ""At night I take my groceries and drift away,"" Springsteen sings, but here his working-class identifications sound a little condescending and inappropriate. Just as ""57 Channels (And Nothing On)"" failed to convince anyone that Springsteen watched a lot of TV, ""Queen of the Supermarket"" can't persuade listeners that he does his own grocery shopping. Now that his big dream has come true, Springsteen doesn't seem to know what to do with himself.

Dragon Chinese Cocktail Horoscope,Michael Zapruder,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00fc0084474cd0bfa8b/1:1/w_160/0ab26ec7.jpg,2009-01-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12562-dragon-chinese-cocktail-horoscope/,SideCho,"Way back in 1999, Michael Zapruder set himself a challenge: to write, record and post to his website one new song every week for a year. In the era of MySpace pages and their music players, music blogs, Last.fm, and countless other way to get your music out digitally, this doesn't seem like such a big deal. But back in 1999, hardly anyone used the web that way. Though his act didn't make him famous, it established Zapruder as a guy willing to experiment and push himself to be creative. His early embrace of the web as a tool to connect people to music (and vice versa) also got him a post as Pandora's music curator, though that's a position that could cease to exist next year if SoundExchange doesn't wake up and smell the 21st century coffee of internet radio. Counting 52 Songs, Dragon Chinese Cocktail Horoscope is Zapruder's fourth album, and possibly also his most sedate and intimate. He's brought back Scott Solter, who mixed his last album, as co-producer, and the long list of collaborators is used sparingly, with less of the full-band backing and pronounced orchestration that characterized 2006's New Ways of Letting Go. This paring back-- let's call it de-Sufjanification-- gives the music a markedly darker feel, aided by Solter's adeptness at accenting the low-end and muzzling brighter tones. The album's opener and closer, ""Happy New Year"" and ""Experimental Film"", both benefit from minimalist rhythm beds, which are sonically antiqued by the liberal application of grainy filters that help Zapruder's merely adequate voice stand out more as a clear instrument. Such onic juxtapositions are the album's secret weapon and ultimately its defining characteristic. The drums on ""Lucy's Handmade Paper"" are as straightforward and direct as can be, but the Moog and other keyboards that color the background give the song a ghostly edge. This edge carries over into several other songs, such as the hollow piano dirge ""Can't We Bring You Home"" and ""South Kenosha"", the latter of which sounds like it was recorded in a very cold, large room. The album's extremes are best typified by the startling, loud all-drum coda of ""Bang on a Drum"" and ""Harbor Saints"" and ""Second Sunday in Ordinary Time"", which are basic guitar-folk tunes with just a hint of ornamentation. The album's greatest highlight is ""Ads for Feelings"". If Beck's ""The New Pollution"" and Joni Mitchell's ""Free Man in Paris"" conceived a child, it might sound something like this, with its great, mellow lead vocal, quick tempo, and psychedelic flute breaks. It's perhaps not a coincidence that the wildest, most heavily adorned song is the best. As much as Zapruder's new stripped-down approach can be charming and sometimes captivating, the sparest folk songs he comes up with here can also be a tad boring. With a more distinctive voice or stronger melodies they'd have more of a chance. Still, Dragon is another solid album, if a slight step down.","Singer-songwriter's fourth album, again co-produced with Scott Solter, finds him paring back his sound and opting for a markedly darker feel.

"Oh, the Places We'll Go",LAKE,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02ac0084474cd0bfad5/1:1/w_160/4958a2e5.jpg,2009-01-26 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12584-oh-the-places-well-go/,K,"The Lorax speaks for the trees. Who will speak for Theodore Geisel? The rhyme-slinging children's author/illustrator known to millions as Dr. Seuss kept the multimedia licensing of his assorted whozits and wockets pretty well in pocket until close to his death, even hatching a Christmas classic with the animated TV adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. Geisel's widow hasn't been so lucky with her licensing decisions. Although I have to admit I sort of enjoyed ""Seussical: The Musical"" when I saw it in Boston before all the critic-induced rewrites, and a CGI-animated Horton Hears a Who! hit theaters to solid reviews last spring, it's hard to overlook disasters like Jim Carrey's Grinch or Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat. Graduation gifts mean the last Seuss book most people get before having kids of their own-- Oh, the Places You'll Go!-- is also one of his unfunniest. Good news for people who love the good Doctor: Oh, the Places We'll Go, LAKE's K Records debut full-length, should help ease some of the pain caused by Hollywood's Seuss-icides. Not to be confused with German prog-rockers Lake, this Olympia, Wash.-based lo-fi pop collective fill out their ramshackle boy-girl sing-alongs with enough horns, flutes, jazzy guitars, synths, and handclaps for Bartholomew Cubbins-- or at least a groovier Architecture in Helsinki (or a shoe-string budget Free Design). And they do it without lapsing into the kind of overblown naiveté that boring adults sometimes ascribe to kids, but Seuss' best characters-- and his young fans-- always knew was bullshit. Kites are fun. Growing up isn't. They're the sort of group you'd only find on K, with a rotating lineup that ranges from from three to six members and has included labelmate Karl Blau. You get the picture: guileless vocals, modest recording setups, twee-kid sincerity. Oh, the Places We'll Go has stiff competition among K's recent output, including discs by Blau, Jeremy Jay, the Blow, and the promising Desolation Wilderness. It's not always strong: Despite a piercing lead guitar line and a pulsing outro, ""Counting"" isn't going to help all good children go to heaven, and speaking of Kingdom Come, you can believe in the jangly piano-pop romance of ""Heaven"" without finding the song particularly remarkable. Still, LAKE introduce themselves as pop dreamers of an unusually levelheaded kind: ""Oh, the places we'll go/ We don't actually know,"" they acknowledge on deceptively upbeat opener ""Oh, the Places"" and, a scant 25-plus minutes later, on closing track ""Oh, the Places Two"". Wherever those places are, it sounds like boy and girl are going there together, but that doesn't make those rudderless moments of early adulthood any less terrifying. LAKE coin an all-too-appropriate adverb: ""Disillusionally."" The rest of Oh, the Places We'll Go is divided between faster-paced glee-club soul and trippier, jazzier reveries. The album is at its best on ""Blue Ocean Blue"", an indie-pop should-be hit that calls out those of us ""always looking to obscure the most beautiful bits"" while exploring ""unexplainable emotions"" over brass and cowbell. ""Dead Beat"" is where LAKE's two sides cohere, showing us sisterhood (not ex-husbands who don't pay child support) as instruments dart between urgent verses and dreamy, splayed-out choruses. It's not Sexy Kids' ""Sisters Are Forever"", but not everybody cooks up green eggs and ham. More interesting are the thick bass lines (see also K releases by Jeremy Jay or Atlas Sound) and psychedelic-leaning lyrics of ""Bad Dream"" and ""On the Swing"". With a South American rhythm and reedy keyboard, ""Minor Trip"" offers up a truism no one will give you as a graduation present: ""Fearing the unknown will keep you down/ But fear of death and dying will keep you trying to live."" Is it Shakespeare? Hell no. But I bet it would sound hilarious in anapestic tetrameter.","Twee-ish band on K consists of pop dreamers of an unusually levelheaded kind, while their music moves between between faster-paced glee-club soul and trippier, jazzier reveries.

Johnson&Jonson,Johnson&Jonson,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03213d1975652138317/1:1/w_160/d2a3df0c.jpg,2009-01-26 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12592-johnsonjonson/,Tres,"There's always been internal personality conflicts in hip-hop, especially when an aspiring MC gets his lyrical technique down and wants to use it to express who he is-- or who he wants people to see him as. It's how you get the battle-rap/lover-man dichotomy of vintage LL Cool J, the pseudo-bipolar lighthearted sociopathy of Eminem, and David Banner's pop-that-pussy-and-educate-yourself agenda. Los Angeles rapper Blu, meanwhile, has a split personality of his own, one that emerges on his semi-pseudonymous Johnson&Jonson collaboration project with producer Mainframe, and it's one that many hip-hop fans see in themselves: the split between being a smart-ass kid and a grown-ass man. Johnson&Jonson-- much like his standout debut, the Exile-produced Below the Heavens-- finds Blu's lyrics filled with invocations of youthful indiscretion and coming-of-age epiphanies, some sounding like decade-old memories and others coming across like they happened last week. This is where the smart-ass kid comes in-- joking about drinking gin at age 10 on opener ""J&J"", recalling classroom put-downs of Michael Jackson and proper usage of the word ""bitch"" on the two-part ""Up All Night"", catching a contact buzz off his father's blunts and aspiring towards his friends' Menace to Society status in the process of ignoring his mom's warnings in ""Mama Told Me""-- and rapping like a young-and-hungry shit-talker with something to prove on just about every track. It's not unfamiliar turf, but it's put together and delivered from the perspective of an older, wiser man who still has some lingering affection for his young-and-ignorant days, some of which might not entirely be behind him. While the liquor-and-weed vibe and frequent pimp-hand proclamations give Johnson&Jonson its freewheeling vibe of fun-seeking, youthful arrogance, there's moments where it comes across like grinning admissions of benign, remorseless guilt-- not self-absorbed or defensive, but with an undercurrent of relief that he somehow escaped fucking things up for himself. It's mostly implicit (if not absent) in the party/battle cuts; if there's any grown-up sentiment in ""Half a Knot""'s euphoric swagger or the disco-fied Hollywood swingin' of ""Wow"", it's mostly in the feeling that comes with showing up on your old block with more money and skills than you left it with, or the freedom of being able to play the part of a bar-hopping high-roller without worrying about getting caught with a fake ID. But this album was recorded in 2006 when Blu was 23, which is a good age to take stock of what you've done so far and where you're going from there, and here's where the grown-ass man aspect takes hold. ""Another joint lit without a brother I can pass it to/ Another black suit I gotta buy, and I've had two,"" he laments on the Lennon-sampling hidden track ""Hold on John"", an inventory of personal and political strife which feels like a strung-together series of realizations that you can't really go back to being an escapism-obsessed kid so easily. It's a sentiment backed up in the mournful homecoming of ""Long Time Gone"", with its wistful Hugh Masekela-fueled vibe and its lyrics reminiscing over a permanently irretrievable childhood. And he sounds like he's struggling against his (and others') old habits on ""The Only Way"", where he waxes frustrated over early 70s soul and admits that he's ""a little better by stayin' humble/ I still hear my grandpa mumble, 'stay out of trouble, boy'"". All that personality, and the record sounds amazing, too. A lot of it has to do with how well Blu meshes with some unpredictable, frequently left-field beats: Mainframe's production style reveals him to be one of 2008's biggest out-of-nowhere surprises, and he delivers a dizzying conglomeration of rock, classic soul, and funk that provides some of the most densely packed and restless sonics of any rap record in 2008. The beats on Johnson&Jonson are the most psychedelic since Edan's Beauty and the Beat-- only they go beyond acid-fried weirdness into all-out party-rocking breakbeat psychosis that had me thinking vintage Prince Paul with an even weirder record collection. And while Blu's insights are deep, his mic control's deeper, and if the heavier meaning of this album eludes you the energetic power of his voice won't. He delivers some jewels, flashy when he needs to be and agile at a whole bunch of different tempos, yet still down-to-earth enough to make sure his words are in the service of messages that area clear and relatable. With the best of two worlds-- the supreme comedic cockiness of the youngster and the insight of a lyrical vet who's already grown up fast since he first started rhyming-- Blu should have the underground on lock for a long time to come.","Mixing invocations of youthful indiscretion and coming-of-age epiphanies, Los Angeles rapper Blu and producer Mainframe create one of the best and most underrated underground hip-hop records of the past six months.

"Jon Brion Remix EP / Synecdoche, New York OST",Of MontrealJon Brion,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03b5e6ef9596931fed2/1:1/w_160/5fd828a3.jpg,2009-01-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12600-jon-brion-remix-ep-synecdoche-new-york-ost/,Polyvinyl,"In a recent web feature following Jon Brion as he shops at Amoeba Records in Hollywood, the noted producer/songwriter/performer reveals what goodies he picked up that day, including Fats Waller, Liam Finn's solo debut, and a set of Glenn Gould DVDs. At the end of the piece, however, Brion holds court on Of Montreal, picking up two of the band's albums to give to a friend and generally extolling the virtues of Kevin Barnes' project. ""I think he's the best thing going these days,"" says Brion. ""There's nobody else I hear that I really have it for in the same way."" Maybe that's because Brion, a musical mastermind by many standards, recognizes a kind of kinship with Barnes. Certainly Barnes is possessed of a similarly manic genius, and as with Brion, he sometimes seem unable to stop the ideas from spilling over. Brion's talents, however, are typically tempered by his own good taste. The unfiltered Barnes, on the other hand, has no such compunctions, which is why the idea of Brion remixing Of Montreal is such an intriguing idea. One idiosyncratic oddball bringing order-- maybe-- to the other's sexy, excessive Id explosion? Bring it on. Approaching the ADHD-addled sonic landscape of Of Montreal's Skeletal Lamping, Brion not surprisingly gravitated to two of the disc's more straightforward songs, ""An Eluardian Instance"" and the disco orgy ""Gallery Piece"", and also not surprisingly, considering Brion's respect for both song and auteur alike, his remixes are more like refinements. The slightly rearranged and edited ""First Time High (Reconstructionist Remix of An Eluardian Instance)"" sticks pretty close to the original while giving it a lusher sheen (as well what sounds like some subtle ukulele and possibly some added vocals). The results tone down the Barnes version just enough to help bring its relentless hooks into sharper focus. ""First Time High (of Chicago Acoustic Version)"" is, as billed, a version of the song stripped down to its simplest acoustic components, as provided by Brion (replete with more uke and some nice guitar embellishments). One can easily imagine this version being close to how Barnes himself began it, before he headed into the studio and started piling on the crazy. Likely sensing a shared affinity with Prince, Brion also tackles ""Gallery Piece"" in a way the Purple One might have done in his 12"" heyday: with a remix, a long version, and an instrumental. The remix adds numerous synth squiggles on top of the existing Barnes vamp, throbbing up the low end not in an effort to make the track more dancefloor friendly, but, as if it were even possible, to make it more giddy and gonzo. And even if the remix doesn't accomplish that, the extended version-- featuring five extra minutes of synth madness-- does the trick, recalling no less than one of Brion's own infamous improvised and overdubbed live Largo performances. Compared to this, the instrumental version is an aftershock. As much as Brion may see some of himself in Barnes, he's on even more familiar ground with the soundtrack to Synecdoche, New York, the latest melancholy metaphysical mind-fuck of a movie from screenwriter and now director Charlie Kaufman. Aside from the opening, self-explanatory ""Tacky Entrance Music"", the rest of the score comprises the usual chamber pieces and quirky cues featuring strings, keys and guitar, and each is informed with a sense of sadness, confusion and menace befitting the film itself. Few of these cues last more than a minute or two, and several circle recurring motifs, which makes the soundtrack a little too repetitive for casual listening. Still, some tracks, at least those closer to songs, stick out. The slightly discordant guitar meditation ""Something You Can't Return To"" alludes to Brion's beloved Beatles without any of the bells and whistles, while it's easy to imagine ""Transposition"" or the three gorgeous ""Piano"" pieces transformed into complete verse-chorus compositions. The soundtrack does end with two tracks that feature vocals, each co-written by Brion and Kaufman (who surely did a pass on the lyrics, not the music). The heartbreaking ""Little Person"" (which appeared in the trailer) and ""Song for Caden"" both showcase singer Deanne Storey, and Brion, on piano, understands to stay out of her way, which is another of Brion's many gifts and the talent he probably ports over from all his serve-the-artist session work. Once again, as with Brion's previous scores, anyone looking for every last bit of original music composed for the film will be disappointed that not every cue-- or song-- has made its way here. Then again, both the Synecdoche soundtrack and the Of Montreal mixes serve as reminders that very little from Jon Brion ever makes it way beyond his person, period. Aside from his various production credits and live appearances in Los Angeles, the only Jon Brion record to his name to date is 2001's Meaningless, which basically means that when it comes to Brion, a guy that generously spends so much of his considerable creative energies on other artists, you take what you can get.",,7.2,
Tonight,Franz Ferdinand,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a047b1335d7bf1697faf/1:1/w_160/4905b10f.jpg,2009-01-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12609-tonight/,Domino,"The standard line about having your whole life to write your first album and only six months to write your second seemed especially true in the case of Franz Ferdinand. The Glaswegian band issued its sophomore effort You Could Have It So Much Better some 18 months after its 2004 self-titled debut-- a narrow window considering that first record yielded three top 10 UK singles, a Mercury Prize, and a steady touring itinerary that saw them ascend from clubs to concert halls to the Grammys. But the quick turnaround and life on the road didn't affect the quality of the material so much as the band's performance of it-- sounding brawnier and brasher than on their debut, Franz Ferdinand ripped through the album's 13 songs. Franz Ferdinand must've therefore been happy to sit out the past three years. In the time since Franz released their last album, their American contemporaries the Killers have already gone Springsteen and then swung back to their synth-pop roots, while next-generation UK upstarts like the Arctic Monkeys have weathered their own cycle of hyperbole, hibernation, and orchestral side projects. During that time, Franz Ferdinand first seemed poised to reemerge as the biggest pop band in the UK-- having initially tapped Girls Aloud guru Brian Higgins (Xenomania) to produce their third album-- or the most commercially suicidal, eventually parting ways with Higgins and indulging in extended studio jams, electronic experiments, and deconstructed, Martin Hannett-like recording techniques (complete with tales of using human bones for percussion). In his review of You Could Have It So Much Better, Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe praised Franz Ferdinand for making albums that played like compilations of discrete but equally great singles, refreshingly bereft of the conceptual heft that marked the band's indie-rock peers at the time. Here the group dial that back from the start: ""Ulysses"" is less immediately striking than the band's previous headlining singles, as well as more lean and mechanistic. But it ably asserts Tonight's slow-burn methodology: If that ""la la la"" chorus sounds unremarkable at first, by the third round, it's unstoppable. Instead, Tonight's patient pacing supports Franz singer Alex Kapranos' claims that these tracks share a nocturnal theme, reinforced by a gradually arced dusk-to-dawn sequence, a wandering spirit, and surprises that spring out of the shadows: ""Send Him Away"" comes on as a cool snap-along Sly Stone strut before intensifying into an unlikely but effective Afro-psych-funk jam; ""Bite Hard"" is a piano ballad reborn as a thick-heeled glam-rock gallop; the slo-mo-disco group chant ""What You Came For"" explodes into roadhouse-metal thrashing. But seeing as many of these arrangements were extracted from improvised jams, the shifts rarely feel forced, sounding more like the inevitable climaxes to Kapranos' seedy, increasingly desperate, club-crawling narratives. It's only on Tonight's would-be epic ""Lucid Dreams"" that the album's exploratory approach works against the band's pop instincts. Appearing in a considerably different, elongated eight-minute version than the one that debuted on the band's website last fall, the song is now outfitted with a re-arranged, slowed-down chorus that makes it stumble where it should soar. But if the extended fade out feels overlong and anti-climactic on its own terms, in the context of Tonight it provides an effective, slate-cleaning set-up for the album's two sweetly serene closers: space-age bachelor-pad lullaby ""Dream Again"" and a solo acoustic-troubador turn from Kapranos on ""Katherine Kiss Me"". More so than stoking the band's current commercial prospects, Tonight is an exciting record for what it could potentially spell for Franz Ferdinand's future-- from here, you could just as easily imagine the band further exploring electro-house productions, or stripping their sound down and making a folk record, or delving into tropical laptop-tronic pop. Or, if you just want them to keep re-writing ""Take Me Out"", well, hey, they can do that too-- see: ""No You Girls"", a standard-issue but still irresistible disco-floor stomper that imagines Bowie re-recording ""Oh You Pretty Things"" for Scary Monsters (and which recently assumed its natural habitat in an episode of ""Gossip Girl). As the band that provided the exclamation point to the post-punk revival of the early 00s, there was good reason to question Franz Ferdinand's current standing in the pop world, now that that trend is on the wane. However, as it turns out, their return is perfectly timed to remind us that, in a world where UK rock is so uninspired the Brits were forced to make superstars out of Kings of Leon, you really can have it so much better.","After a few years of non-stop activity that found them moving from clubs to a Mercury Prize win and Grammy performance, Franz Ferdinand took time off and have re-emerged with an album that, more so than stoking current commerical prospects, is an exciting look at the band's potential future.

Four albums on three different labels is one sure way to stifle momentum. And now a fifth release, Swimmer, has appeared on yet another label (this time self-released) following no small amount of wrangling when the label originally set to release it (V2) went under and the band was forced to make other arrangements. While the Standard have been busy label hopping, their gradual evolution and improvement have been somewhat lost in the shuffle. Granted, a nearly Google-proof name hasn't helped, but going by Swimmer, it's safe to assume that obscurity is not one of the group's objectives. The disc's aim-for-the-stars effort makes abundantly clear. Equally arty, anthemic, and fashionably agitated, the album is the kind of big statement one might expect from an act ill at ease with the world around it and compelled to translate those anxieties into something as banal as rock music. Indeed, Tim Putnam's world-weary vocals quiver and quake like he's bearing the weight of the universe on his shoulders, while the songs themselves are awash with evocative piano, spooky guitars, and the occasional taste of chilly keyboards, all intended to convey maximum menace with minimal muss. Yet also absent is some necessary muscle. For all the ominous sound and fury, there's not much here to actually bite into, and each rave-up is ultimately rather unremarkable. Further, while songs such as ""Through the Walls"", ""Lines"", and ""Hotel"" hit all the right notes, that isn't the same thing as hitting your own. The familiar tension and release arrangements belie too much button-pushing shorthand. It's as if the Standard spent some of their studio-bound downtime analyzing such bigger acts as, say, Muse, trying to figure out how to port a similarly atmospheric alt-pop-prog sound to an indie band on a budget. While every last minute of Swimmer screams ""major,"" its reach ultimately exceeds its grasp, leaving it yet another minor-key and melancholy reminder that moodiness is no substitute for meaning. Indeed, with so many other bands aiming for similar art-rock uneasiness, the album's problem is familiar: it's hindered by a sort of 21st century ennui fatigue, its grey-day grandiosity a dime a dozen when woe-is-me is the default expression.","Portland, Ore.'s the Standard go the self-released route on Swimmer, trying to find a way to make wide-screen atmospheric rock on an independent budget.

An Invitation,Van Dyke ParksInara George,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02c5e6ef9596931feb8/1:1/w_160/222cbec5.jpg,2009-01-23 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12586-an-invitation/,Everloving,"Inara George didn't want to be a musician. The daughter of the Little Feat frontman, Lowell George, she rebelled against the idea that her career was foreordained by her genes. Apparently, and luckily, she cottoned to the fact that music was in her blood, as half of lounge-nouveau duo the Bird and the Bee and solo and with her confessional debut All Rise. Her newest album An Invitation carries this eerie sense of destiny further: The genius behind the record's meandering baroque, Van Dyke Parks, met Inara shortly after she was born. Parks was friends with George's father and, of course, a collaborator. Years earlier, he wrote the words to Brian Wilson's ""teenage symphonies to God"" on the once famously ""lost"" Smile. Parks has more recently worked with Joanna Newsom on the epic Ys and Rufus Wainwright. After George watched the Edith Piaf documentary La Vie en Rose, she asked Parks to help recreate that sense of the solitary songstress, unencumbered and alone at the microphone, the music magically radiating from offstage. Handed a demo tape, Parks obliged. Soon he returned with arrangements that tracked the path of George's vocals-- every twist and turn-- with a painstaking, almost nanoscale precision. A 28-piece orchestra, heavy on strings, evokes both the Technicolor wonderlands of the Sherman Brothers and the rambling urbanity of Kurt Weill. And, for songs that touch on yearning and love's blindness (""Tell Me That You Love Me"", ""Rough Design""), the large orchestral sound strangely suits the intimate, introspective words: they match the size of the emotions. Recorded in two days at LA's Sunset Sound studio -- the room where Parks and Lowell George first worked together-- the album was produced by Mike Andrews, who considers An Invitation the father-daughter record the Georges never got to make. Lowell died of a heart attack when she was five. Parks takes an approach to composition that feels nearer to film (a holdover from his child-actor days, perhaps) and fiction than music. He views his pieces as connected by their characters and scenes. Married to a director, raised on Shakespeare, and briefly an actress, George was a perfect companion for this philosophy. It's no wonder the record betrays not only the drama of storytelling, but the sweep, color, and motion of the theatrical. They share the same multimedia creativity. With her steady, crystalline voice, the only voice heard, George sounds like the still center of a swirling one-woman musical. In ""Idaho"", she tells the story of people running away to the Potato State, sounding a bit like Keren Ann over the sharp-edged strings, a moody piano, and Parks's accordion. ""Drink the same drink, think the same thing,"" she says elsewhere, about either a post-breakup refuge in ritual, or the descent into lonely monotony. Everyone here is trying to work something out with themselves. ""We're on our way to what we are,"" George sings on ""Rough Design"", describing not only her characters' complex interior lives, but her own thrilling growth as an artist. An Invitation adds a new chapter to that story, told in an unmistakably American idiom fusing Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and Copland, spotlighting Inara George as a sophisticated new voice and confirming Van Dyke Parks, at 68, as an inexhaustibly vital national treasure.","The Bird and the Bee singer teams with baroque-pop hero, family friend, and recent Joanna Newsom and Rufus Wainwright collaborator Van Dyke Parks on a record inspired by Edith Piaf.

Silent City,Kayhan Kalhor & Brooklyn Rider,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0249d034d5c69bf2644/1:1/w_160/01363153.jpg,2009-01-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12579-silent-city/,World Village,"Kayhan Kalhor is a Kurdish Iranian master of Persian music and one of the greatest living players of the kamancheh, a four-stringed, upright Persian fiddle that's tuned like a violin but has a darker tone; Brooklyn Rider is a young American string quartet in the tradition of the Kronos and Balanescu Quartets. Together, their repertoire is a mixture of classic string pieces, modern compositions, and originals composed by one of the group's violinists, Colin Jacobsen, and fleshed out by a talented bunch, equally comfortable improvising and playing complex arrangements as they are performing in concert halls and small rock clubs. Kalhor and Brooklyn Rider met as members of Yo-Yo Ma's ambitious Silk Road Ensemble, a project seeking to unite the vast range of musical traditions along the historic trade route in a way that preserves each one but casts it in the context of something broad and modern. They continue in that spirit on Silent City, finding common ground between Persian folk and modern minimalism. The album's two short pieces, ""Ascending Bird"" and ""Parvaz"", bridge those genres directly, the former by adapting a piece of folk music, and the latter by retelling the same legend with a new composition by Kalhor. ""Ascending Bird"" balances slow and deliberate phrases from the quartet, with Kalhor's warm, searching kamancheh and frenzied santur (Persian hammer dulcimer) from guest Siamak Aghaei. Percussionist Mark Suter and double bassist Jeff Beecher are also on hand to widen the aural palette. Colin Jacobsen's ""Beloved, Do Not Let Me Be Discouraged"" fuses a passage inspired by the Central-Asian Romeo & Juliet story Layla & Majnun with a 14th-century Italian song, beginning with a long, solemn meditation on the latter before swelling and finally bursting into its rhythmic second half. Engineer Jody Elff has brilliantly captured the detail and dynamic depth of the group, and this is most apparent on the half-hour centerpiece, Kalhor's magnificent composition ""Silent City"". It begins nearly inaudible, with a slow improvisation that gradually grows to a heaving, jaw-dropping climax around the 17-minute mark, only to break back down to an aching, kamancheh-led passage. Where the first climax comes with a sudden shift from dissonance to gorgeous consonance, the second is a cathartic, celebratory dance movement, with Suter returning to percussion. Silent City has something for nearly everyone-- classical music fans will appreciate the fine quality of the playing, world music aficionados will enjoy the cross-cultural currents, and it's very easy to see kids reared on post-rock and miminalist electronic music feeling at home here (if you've ever liked anything released on Kranky, you're almost certain to enjoy this). Experimentalism is always more rewarding when it leads to resounding emotional depth, and this is as good an example as you'll find of a group of musicians achieving that ideal balance.","Brooklyn string quartet in the mold of the Kronos and Balanescu joins Kurdish Iranian virtuoso Kayhan Kalhor for an album that finds common ground between Persian folk and modern minimalism.

Vacilando Territory Blues,J. Tillman,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a040c0084474cd0bfb0f/1:1/w_160/0935bd2a.jpeg,2009-01-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12603-vacilando-territory-blues/,Western Vinyl,"J. Tillman joined Fleet Foxes last summer, after their Sun Giant EP had already converted many listeners into fans. Before that, he had been a solo artist for nearly five years, developing his own sound and identity on four limited-release albums. His voice blends so well with his bandmates and his drumming has just the right restraint that despite his absence from the liner credits, it's not difficult to imagine he's been with the band all along, lurking just outside the studio and harmonizing through the walls. From the first richly harmonized notes, Vacilando Territory Blues, Tillman's fifth album and first for Western Vinyl, only confirms that impression: Featuring two Foxes and a similarly deep-woods sound, the album may bring to mind the glacial songs of Damien Jurado, the subdued shimmer of Mark Kozelek's solo material, or the outdoorsy languor of Great Lake Swimmers, but it ultimately proves a strong, quiet complement to Fleet Foxes and, more crucially, the band's rougher, looser sound. The only constants on these songs are Tillman's wounded vocals and acoustic guitar, which he alternately strums with percussive force or patient restraint. Other instruments come and go, other voices join his, but each of these songs sounds like it was written on and for a lone guitar. This is no surprise, but it is important: Even as Vacilando adds new styles and instruments to Tillman's sound, it draws a straight line to his previous output, which is sparer and starker. Compared to Long May You Run, J. Tillman and Cancer and Delirium (both from 2007 and both reissued digitally last year on Autumn Tone Records), Vacilando sounds positively bombastic, but then again, those albums would make Nick Drake sound like Marc Bolan. Tillman continues to make virtues of slow and quiet, but here he finds new avenues to explore, using volume more liberally and enlarging his musical palette without losing the brooding, late-night post-buzz vibe. ""Steel on Steel"", a standout about the aftermath of a car crash, bolsters the crisp imagery and economical lyrics with mournful horns that give the sense of loss and regret an almost gravitational pull. Marimba and mellotron add tints of color to ""No Occasion"", and a mandolin and piano take turns with the central ascending theme of ""First Born"", as Tillman sings like a less granular Will Johnson. Beginning with a blast of discordant reed instruments that interrupts the album's brooding tone, ""New Imperial Grand Blues"" makes explicit the classic-rock influences that underlie all of his arrangements even as it suggests an experimental streak. The song rumbles menacingly, darker and crunchier than anything his day-job band has yet mustered. Sequenced immediately afterwards, the nearly lo-fi ""Master's House"", with its casual strums and blueslike structure, sounds all the more austere, revealing new contrasts and territories in his sound. Between these two poles lie Tillman's stock-in-trade folk songs, which sound solemnly intense and subtly melodic. Neil Young set the template, but Tillman puts his stamp on every note, wringing bare-bones poetry from evocative couplets. Occasionally, he stumbles, as on the overlong, overbaked ""Barter Blues"", whose soundtrack ambience can't sustain its seven-minute length, but more often, he writes toward a type of epiphany most often found in midcentury short stories: ""James Blues"", about a lovelorn character haunted by bad dreams, ends with the observation ""The universe makes more sense without a purpose,"" which sounds both gloomy and hopeful. ""Laborless Land"" makes an affecting chorus by repeated the word ""daylight,"" which sounds all the more poignant following his ominous hints of ""what I saw that blood-red morning."" He never specifies just what he saw, and that lack of disclosure gives the song a dark, almost gothic flavor. Tillman's stories sound as elliptical as his music, as if the lyrics demand such sparse arrangements. ""Everything moves so fast,"" he sings on ""Steel on Steel"", ""leave no time to ask, does nothing last? Do all things pass, just ash to ash?"" These songs whisper loudly to slow the world down, to preserve a moment and all its emotions, whether they're pleasant or-- more likely-- painful.","A solo artist for nearly five years, Fleet Foxes drummer and vocalist J. Tillman releases his first record since joining the suddenly successful Americana band.

The Eraser Rmxs,Thom Yorke,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04a9d034d5c69bf26a0/1:1/w_160/ad2784d9.jpg,2009-01-23 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12612-the-eraser-rmxs/,XL,"When the nine remixes that make up this CD officially hit the web in December 2007, surprisingly few paid them much attention. It wasn't a quality issue as much as timing-- an incredible marketing plan/album called In Rainbows had been set upon starving web consumers just two months before, and Radiohead fans were still in the glassy-eyed-wonder stage. At that point, Thom Yorke's The Eraser seemed like a harmless but necessary detour. While only a few would name The Eraser as their favorite Radiohead-related LP, the 2006 record gave Yorke the chance to air out his electrohead side before heading back to the band for In Rainbows-- the most naturalistic Radiohead album since OK Computer. The assumed logic seems sound: no Eraser, no In Rainbows. A little over a year ago, The Eraser was a tiny lily pad, so why fret about these redos courtesy of dudes from Yorkie's dubstep-heavy iPod? Though there's no discernible reason for The Eraser Rmxs finally getting a U.S. release right now (the songs were originally sold as MP3s, then a collection of three-song EPs, then as a CD in Japan last year), it sort of makes sense. Though the original album may have caused Radiohead to not make a record that sounds like it, the LP has caused some guy named Kanye West to do his best impression of it. Of the influences West cites in his recent Grammy ad, The Eraser lies directly in his head space. And there's no denying the spare sonic similarities between the record and West's current 808s and Heartbreak, which currently sits at No. 5 on the Billboard charts. Its current single, ""Heartless"", is No. 3. So it turns out The Eraser played a large part in both Radiohead's consensus return-to-form LP as well as one of the most galvanizing pop albums in recent memory. Maybe this record's more important that we originally thought. And so: The Rmxs. Always looking out for the next weird, bassy, scatterbrained electronic thing, Yorke collects a coterie of producers that would make Aphex Twin-philes split their pants. (Alas, Afx himself could not be reached for comment.) Three of dubsteb's most notable names-- Burial, the Bug, and Various-- chip in, along with laptop gurus Four Tet, the Field, and Modeselektor. Considering the amounts of hands turning knobs both tangible and virtual, there's an impressive consistency about The Rmxs. While The Eraser saw Yorke sulking about end-times and hopeless love against a pristine backdrop of ambient loops and tiny, click-clack percussion, The Rmxs dirties things up considerably. This is rebel music. No longer is Yorke wailing in his bedroom; he's whispering in a basement, plotting an overthrow. Burial starts it off and, in essence, ends it with the disc's best track. All the standard tics from dubstep's most enigmatic figure are apparent on his ""And It Rained All Night"" redo: sub-bass adorned with nothing but atmosphere-- Zippos flicker out and the clink of bullet shells hit the floor. Who's been shot? Nobody's saying. If this song soundtracked that awful Bacchanalia scene in The Matrix Reloaded, that movie would automatically be 10% more enjoyable. Unsurprisingly, Yorke's voice suits Burial's soupy concoctions just as nicely as those mysterious R&B divas he's usually fond of-- if this team ever decided to meet on an LP level, few would oppose. Cristian Vogel contributes two remixes, one of them the token overlong vamp that largely deletes Yorke's voice entirely, which is just silly. The Bug's ""Harrowdown Hill"" takes the singer's seething political indictment and turns it downright deranged-- it's almost Tricky-esque. The Field and Four Tet offer the only moments of relative hope with tracks that lift more than pummel. Four Tet even makes that ""artichoke heart"" line go down easy, with xylophones and pillowed drums sliding into a future with fewer head-scratching surprises, fewer reasons to throw things at the television. And, of course, In Rainbows' secret weapon was the H word our current president is so fond of. The Eraser is relevant now, but-- specifically at this moment, days away from that crowded Mall-- it also sounds like a relic. Even Kanye made sure to graft the record's sonics onto something-- searing, thoughtless emotion-- more evergreen than dystopian riddles. Economic crash withstanding, Radiohead turned out to be quite prescient, coupling their most openhearted LP with a new era of genuine compassion (maybe?). The Eraser Rmxs is an insulated, paranoid, technically proficient reminder of a time when it seemed like there was no way out. ""This is fucked up,"" repeats a pitch-shifted Yorke on Vogel's Bonus Beat ""Black Swan"" mix. And it is. But not as much as before.","Originally sold as MP3s, then a collection of three-song EPs, then as a CD in Japan last year, this collection of Thom Yorke remixes-- from such electronic all-stars as Burial, Four Tet, the Field, the Bug, and Various-- finally gets a U.S. full-length release.

Night Shot,Ruby Isle,by: Kasia Galazka,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00cea9e61561daa4498/1:1/w_160/f290b1eb.jpg,2009-01-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12559-night-shot/,Kindercore,"Ruby Isle banks on the same nostalgia-based fascination that keeps city thrift stores in business. Alongside guitarist Mark Mallman, bassist and vocoder handler Dan Geller pumps enough synth patches into their debut album to keep a solid power hour going. Their individual histories help explain their brand of relentless dance-rock: Geller founded Kindercore and electropop duo I Am the World Trade Center, and Mallman once performed a 52.4 hour-long rock song aptly titled ""Marathon 2"" (the first ""Marathon"" lasted half the time) a few years ago. What Ruby Isle lack in lyrical dexterity (""Hey hey hey, that kid's okay/ He's just another sucker with bills to pay""), they make up for with presence. Hearing their electro-fied cover of Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"", which features Geller's IATWTC counterpart Amy Dykes, will probably make most who hear it bristle and think, ""Why?"" But, admittedly, if I was harboring a lucid buzz and heard those staccato synths, I would probably grab the nearest party peon's lapel and exclaim, ""Do you hear that?! That's Gabriel!"" All covers cause an initial familiarity-effect joy, which can either fade into disdain or booze-fueled bopping. Ruby Isle will probably spur the latter-- not that they really give a shit. And that's why the best places to hear Night Shot are like those scenes in Can't Hardly Wait and every other teen-seeking-tail movie where kids are hanging off the stairs and puking into the pool. That's not to say Geller, Mallman, and drummer Aaron LeMay can't get you moving. They can, especially with pep-squad songs like ""Atom Bombs '09"". Even YouTube superstar Tay Zonday contributes guest vocals to the title track, sometimes sounding like his ""Chocolate Rain"" self, sometimes like the invisible ""Mortal Kombat"" referee indicating that you should probably start fighting. It's goofy party rock done more or less right, with programmed handclaps and unyielding (and borderline irksome) energy. The first pressing of Night Shot includes a bonus EP with songs from Ruby Isle's covers project. For a time, the band recorded a version of whatever song made the weekly top spot on music blog aggregator Elbo.ws; along the way, they managed to remove most of the whimsy and allure. Beach House's gorgeous ""Gila"" is wire-stripped into a cheerleader anthem, and the sound effects that propelled M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" onto radio waves are replaced with vocal imitations. The only version of these that doesn't sting too much is ""Cherry Tulips"" by Headlights, which always needed a slight makeover. In the end, though Ruby Isle are hit-and-miss with both their originals and their covers, there is a certain spunk here that's infectious; it's easy to admire their audacity, if not necessarily their sound.","Debut from electropop outfit that includes Dan Geller (formerly of I Am the World Trade Center) finds room for a cover of Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" and a guest spot from Tay ""Chocolate Rain"" Zonday.

Hold This Ghost,Musée Mécanique,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0115e6ef9596931fe86/1:1/w_160/d842b4be.jpg,2009-01-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12564-hold-this-ghost/,Frog Stand,"Portland, Ore., is lousy with folk acts, but Musée Mécanique distinguish themselves from the throng by ignoring Americana influences and infusing their brand of intimate melancholia with lush arrangements and electronic underpinnings. While they may not sound like other bands in their local scene, Micah Rabwin and Sean Ogilvie's collective is clearly an integral part of it. Witness their delicate, affecting debut, Hold This Ghost, which features contributions from fine hometown musicians like Laura Gibson and Norfolk & Western's Rachel Blumberg. Despite what their band name may imply, the Northwestern group isn't remotely French, taking their moniker, instead, from a California museum of old-fashioned coin-operated music boxes. The name fits them, as the ambiance they've created on Ghost is, at once, haunted, ornate, wistful for the past, and not of its time. Though almost every song is built on a foundation of gentle guitars, it is the baroque orchestrations of poignant strings, weeping accordions, and flickering organs that give this collection its hazy soul and hypnotic core. Album closer ""Our Changing Skins"" adds flourishes of the singing saw to its dulcet chamber orchestra and chirping-bird samples to temper its sweetness, tinting the tune with a nostalgic sepia tone. And ""The Propellors"" layers a similarly haunting saw swoon over its gauzy melody, illustrating its historical lyrics (""December 17th, 1903/ Propellers turn to wings/ The age of air at hand"") with its otherworldly ambience. The fact that Musée Mécanique choose to tell the story of the Wright Brothers' first flight, not as a celebratory pop song, but as a drowsy, ghostly apparition of one, tells you a lot about their aesthetic. Even their more straightforward acoustic folk songs use subtle, imaginative arrangements to imbue an antique patina to their goosebump-inducing melodies. ""The Things That I Know"", the album's most direct folk song, is built on a fingerpicked base that feels like a whispery Iron & Wine accompaniment, but its fairy-tale glockenspiels add a shimmering weightlessness to the heavy introspection. And ""Somehow Bound"" is the kind of aching, love-lost ballad that Elliott Smith mastered, complete with nakedly depressive lyrics-- ""I hear you laughing through the wall/ It's been two hours, just one call/ Talking on the phone with some guy that I might know/ I hope I don't know."" But by tweaking Smith's acoustic formula with a brooding keyboard drone in the background and twinkling glockenspiels adding a light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel brightness, Musée Mécanique artfully side-step the rote strumming and self-indulgent woe-is-me-ism that plagues many Smiths wannabes. Though their instrumental experimentalism is key to their overall sound, Musée Mécanique owe a great deal of their evocative power to Rabwin's emotive tenor. Like Sufjan Stevens without cheerleaders (or, frankly, cheer), Rabwin has an elegant clarity and regal sadness to his tone and, because he enunciates each word, listeners will not only understand every lyric he sings, but also feel them too. It is that ability to viscerally effect an audience that make Musée Mécanique such a powerful, if unusual, folk force. Their shy yet florid debut is tinged with sadness, like a painted carousel sitting empty in winter, mourning for a time they-- or we-- never even knew.","Band from Portland, Ore., dreams in sepia tones, combining acoustic guitar, singing saw, accordion, and organ to evoke an antique setting befitting their haunted songs.

Luniculaire EP,White Hinterland,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0349d034d5c69bf266a/1:1/w_160/130a84de.jpg,2009-01-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12594-luniculaire-ep/,Dead Oceans,"Like all Francophiles, Casey Dienel wants her Francophilia to be taken seriously. Or so you'd gather from the heady account of her new EP as a ""love letter to France, French music, and the French language."" Called Luniculaire, a whimsical name that suggests a train to the moon, you might expect these five songs to assume a dreamlike continental elegance that caresses the senses. You'd be wrong. Each of these songs, out of three covers and two originals, are rendered in a shaky French and touched with a spirit of curious experimentalism. All this might surprise admirers of Phylactery Factory, her comparatively traditional, and solidly English second album, the debut under her White Hinterland moniker. That gorgeous production drifted between nightclub sophistication and swaying, swinging folk. Sure enough, bits of this aesthetic do endure in Luniculaire. This is an elegant affair from any angle. But Dienel has ambitiously left much of the last record's refinement behind for a less forthright, at times abrasive, style of production: partial to broken rhythms, freeform meanderings, and atonality. ""Requiem Pour Un Con"", originally sung by Serge Gainsbourg in the 1968 Jean Gabin flop Le Pacha, crumbles a bit during White Hinterland's rowdy process of interpretation. Where the original vibrated with Gainsbourg's fusion of erotic confidence and bohemian suavity, the cover comes off as partly unhinged, even a little spastic. Blame lies with the chaos of squelches behind her, courtesy of guitarist Alexis Gideon: a wayward blurting that chips away at the chic edifice built up by all the spunky metallic breakbeats and restless vocals. Thanks to Gideon, we get the impression of a rudely interrupted dinner party. Too messy to be called a complete triumph, much of Gainsbourg's clattering minimalism and creepy-cool tension nevertheless survives in this daring recasting. (And extra points must be given to the brave woman who tackles this testosterone-drenched revenge ballad, which drops the Gallic c-bomb in the title, a more explosive term then: in 1968, the title was printed as ""Requiem Pour Un C..."") Gainsbourg was the éminence grise (and Humbert Humbert) behind yé-yé music, but it was Françoise Hardy who most thoroughly embodied this uniquely French species of pop, which joined innocence and romance in the body of the nymphet chanteuse. Hardy's classic ""Mon Amie La Rose"" poetically captured the dark truth behind the brightly flirtatious yé-yé, massaging the theme of beauty's impermanence by tracing the life of a rose in the garden. Gainsbourg all but lived by the girl-as-flower analogy, but Hardy dives deeper here, musing on mortality, not romance, in a silken voice that seems both existential and optimistic. Dienel's languorous update is less convincing, botching the Blochian final words: ""Believe, those who can believe/ Me, I need hope/ Or else I am nothing."" When the original's pathos-laden ballad edged dangerously close to cheesy sentimentalism, the clear-headed vocals, pillowy harmonies, and tender troubadour guitars pulled it back. The mopey, clumsy violins on the cover nudge it over the top. More adventurous is her fresh vision of ""J'ai 26 Ans"" from Brigitte Fontaine's criminally unsung Comme à la Radio, a record that houses the startling combination of yé-yé ingenue and free jazz wizards the Art Ensemble of Chicago. ""In the original Brigitte Fontaine song, there's a lot of implied drone, with the middle Eastern timbres in the bass lines that're being played,"" Dienel has explained. The fact is that the song was nearly all bassline. No surprise that, over a sea of delay, feral howls, and tribal percussion, the implied drone turns explicit, into a fiery dirge from the Fertile Crescent. A far cry from the haunting, artsy sparseness done by Fontaine, the busy maximalism still works as a clever interpretation. Dienel's own two compositions are impressive, and wildly different. Fans of Phylactery Factory will welcome the genteel swing of ""Lunirascible"", which restores the piano-- and that feathery voice-- to the fore. Alike in mood, but a radical departure in methodology, ""Chant de Grillon"" glides along like a Krautrock layered-guitar epic. It sails on a motorik groove over glistening, spacy effects, rising steadily into a Caribou-style frenzy of percussion. Luniculaire uncovers a surprising side of Casey Dienel. We knew her as the deviser of jazzy, brightly melodic, and somehow disarmingly childlike tunes. This EP introduces an artist willing to embrace the ugly sound, to forgo indie-pop politesse for art-rock attitude, to sing in a language she can't flawlessly speak. The missed opportunities and the overreaches here point nevertheless to that rare thing, a true and thoughtful risk taker, whose gutsy, thoroughly imagined songs signal new directions for an indie auteur in the making.","Casey Dienel's five-song exploration of her own Francophilia featurs three covers (of Serge Gainsbourg, Françoise Hardy, and Brigitte Fontaine), two originals, and a surprising spirit of curious experimentalism.

Numbers Lucent EP,Squarepusher,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a041c0084474cd0bfb11/1:1/w_160/03e53570.jpeg,2009-01-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12604-numbers-lucent-ep/,Warp,"One salient observation rarely made about Tom Jenkinson, aka Squarepusher, is that within his often-meandeirng canon, he skillfully navigates the path between invention and interpretation. Save a few releases (last fall's rock concert-fantasy Just a Souvenir among them), d'n'b freakouts like those on his new Numbers Lucent EP have dominated the rhythmic tenor of Jenkinson's schizoid suites. Jenkinson's virtuosic bass work and his jazz training, however, just as often forge a path between breakbeats and fusion. Such live-band musings, even if largely theoretical, have set him apart from his more austere dancefloor cohorts. On his new record, Jenkinson has adopted a relatively new trait: brevity. Just a Souvenir clocked in at just under 45 minutes, and Numbers is one of Jenkinson's few recent standalone EPs-- and one of his strongest. The EP streamlines Squarepusher's rave genesis in six shortish tracks. ""Illegal Dustbin"", for instance, presents breakcore salvos with a rough edge. It opens with a stock Amen break before continually upping the stakes, first letting loose glitchy, fuzzed-out synths and guitars then climaxing with double-speed axe work, as if he's apologizing for the rock-band dynamics of his last record.* Numbers*, admittedly a collection of ""textbook"" Squarepusher works, comes only a few months after the dramatic left turn of Souvenir, which is for all intents and purposes Squarepusher Unplugged. Despite their differences, Jenkinson seems to link the two thematically, and not only with similar album art: Souvenir is more psychedelic dream; Numbers Lucent perhaps delivers the rude awakening. ""Star Time 1"" riffs on the same funky theme as Souvenir opener ""Star Time 2""-- and it's the record's most melodic moment-- yet even it's full of acid-tinged synth lines and frantic bass runs. (Intriguingly, if the numbers refer to a chronology, it's possible the rave throwback cuts on Numbers were the original path trod for Squarepusher's 2008 LP.) In the end, Numbers Lucent feels, oddly for a rave record (though fittingly for a Squarepusher release), academic. Even compared to the existential sighs of 2004's Ultravisitor or the blissouts of Hard Normal Daddy, Numbers' grooves look like palimpsests recalling livelier days. Numbers instead reads best as a contrast piece to Just a Souvenir. While Souvenir re-casts Jenkinson as an artist of immediate payoffs, it's also way off the decades-long course he's plotted. Numbers provides the compass pointing the way back to Jenkinson's roots, a reminder that his sonic psychosis stems from the madness of the dance floor.","Hot on the heels of October's concept album Just a Souvenir, Tom Jenkinson gets back to his raving roots with six meditations on drum'n'bass, breakcore, and acid house.

He's been wandering that path since 2003's Weather Systems, when he retired his former band, the Bowl of Fire, and moved to Western Illinois to live with his thoughts on an old farm. On his new album, Noble Beast, Bird can sometimes seem too far inside his own head. And he also appears aware of it, addressing that solitude on ""Effigy"": ""When one has spent too much time alone..."" He doesn't answer with another lyric-- perhaps he doesn't have an answer. Instead, he lets you fill in the blank while he reels off a pretty, rustic violin figure. Noble Beast is, in many ways, a record that asks you to forget the way you currently approach the album. It didn't click for me on early listens. The sometimes drifting song structures, frequent tonal shifts, odd lyrics, and interludes presented a stuffed canvas full of interesting sounds that didn't seem to have a focal point, didn't seem to have a place where you were supposed to enter the composition. Eventually, however, everything fell into place. Marinating in an album in this way is old-fashioned in the overloaded peer-to-peer era, but it's a fitting approach from Bird, a guy who often wrestles with the implications of modern technology and communications. The sound of the album is as important as the notes Bird plays, and this extends to the lyrics, where he's gradually gone from word-play to syllable-play, often choosing lines for their sounds and tonal quality more than for their meaning. Nevertheless, Bird's music is still emotionally powerful-- he gives uncommon weight to odd phrases, sometimes backing off pronouncing a word fully. His diction comes and goes similar to the way Thom Yorke's does. Some of the phrases don't mean anything; others jump out oddly, like the way he follows a free-association game on ""Masterswarm"" with the startlingly cogent, even harrowing line, ""They took me to the hospital and they put me through a scan."" Bird injects the music with similar contrasts, opening ""Effigy"" with a spooky bed of looping, processed violins before shifting into one of the album's most traditional-sounding moments, with finger-picked acoustic guitar playing a simple, straightforward melody. Despite early listens, I quickly found myself returning to the record even as I corresponded about it with some nonplussed colleagues. And it revealed itself to be fantastically detailed, from the woodwinds that spice the electronic pulse of ""Not a Robot, But a Ghost"" to the bassline that comes out of nowhere at the finale of ""The Privateers"". More broadly, it takes you even further into the canyons of Bird's mind, and it does so with an organic, unhurried flow that's ultimately an improvement on 2007's Armchair Apochrypha, a record I felt was sometimes too fussy and mannered. Even the bonus disc that comes with the deluxe edition, Useless Creatures, has a captivating looseness that finally brings some of the high-wire energy of his unpredictable live shows into the studio. Noble Beast is has its weak spots-- ""Nomenclature"" in particular takes the repurposing of language purely for its sound a step too far, not least of which because Bird chose a cumbersome, ugly word-- but one of the benefits of working so far in your own sphere is that your mistakes will always be interesting, and better than that, you get to learn from them. I have no idea what Bird will learn from making this record, but he seems to have taught himself plenty about what his music can be during his time alone-- and now he's reminding us about the value of patiently engaging with music as well.","A detailed, patient grower in an era of overstuffed instant pleasures, the sound and tonal quality on Andrew Bird's latest album is often as important as the notes he plays or the words he sings.

Free Your Mind and Win a Pony,Golden Animals,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01cc0084474cd0bfaaf/1:1/w_160/631392e6.jpg,2009-01-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12571-free-your-mind-and-win-a-pony/,HappyParts,"The state of California is too large and diverse to have a defining sound. But say that something sounds like California rock circa the 1960s or early 70s, and people have a pretty good idea what you're talking about. The Golden State band Golden Animals mine that particular epoch of mild psych and blues rock-- especially the middle part, when 60s idealism gave way to the dope-daze haze of the 70s-- for all it's worth on Free Your Mind and Win a Pony, the duo's solid enough debut. What possessed guitarist Tommy Eisner (originally from Baltimore) and drummer Linda Beecroft (from Sweden) to specifically aim for the Doors above all else could well be a mix of laziness and audacity. Yet the music here is really-- to paraphrase Robert Christgau tackling the Cult aping Led Zeppelin-- the Doors simplified, with the band hitting all the major beats but falling short of anything cosmic. Whether this is by design or default is up for debate, but it does allow the group to skirt some of the many pitfalls that felled the Doors. In 2009, several of Jim Morrison's most glaring pretensions have been diffused by decades of parody (and this heaped upon his own tragic tendency toward self-parody); his moan remains a sort of shorthand for the milieu that countless bands-- cool and lame alike-- have mimicked or mocked. Where Eisner falls on the sincerity scale is anyone's guess, but certainly a few times over the course of the disc's brisk runtime you can almost sense the glint of a slight grin, as if he realizes the band is essentially a big goof and he's relishing the retread experience. You can't turn back time, but songs such as ""I Want You to Come"" and ""Queen Mary (The Flop)"" are so fully of another age that the approximation is just as fun as it is uncanny. You can thank producer Chris Coady for that, or just as likely Thom Monahan for his retro mix assist. Heck, you could even credit hippie-cult author Gordon Kennedy, whose Salton Sea home Eisner and Beecroft supposedly house-sat during the making of this record, a home apparently packed with Aquarian Age artifacts and LPs. But most of all you can thank Eisner and Beecroft for recognizing that to do this kind of thing right, you have to dive in wholeheartedly. It also helps that Eisner and Beecroft pilfer 60s signifiers but avoid borrowing some of the time's hoarier freak-out clichés. Indeed, if the Doors are reference no. 1, no. 2 are any number of blues-rock bands who knew that the power of a good searing lead or slide guitar trumps wacky hallucinogenic gimmicks any day. The mojo the pair capture on even a short track like ""Alice"" is impressive, and even if it doesn't sound like enough to sustain much more than a single album's worth of rearview mirror novelty, it's more than enough to sustain these 30 minutes of entertaining nostalgia.","California's Golden Animals make retro Cali rock, embracing their inner Doors while skirting many of the pitfalls inherent in such an undertaking.

Get Young,Pretty & Nice,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0115e6ef9596931fe82/1:1/w_160/d1c9efbc.jpg,2009-01-21 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12563-get-young/,Hardly Art,"By now, our collective new wave nostalgia hangover should be staggering. But there's something about the way Boston trio Pretty & Nice re-imagine the playfully manic, barbed-wire sounds of Devo, XTC, and This Year's Model-era Elvis Costello. Their approach is so guileless and giddy, you'll get drunk on that spazzy, sneering sound all over again. Though the rousing, delightfully messy songs on their sophomore album (their first for Sub Pop affiliate Hardly Art) are neither pretty nor nice, they do show off some masterfully economical riffs and herky-jerky (if not outright dance-y) rhythms. Get Young, which clocks in under 28 minutes, swells with energy and amphetamine-addled pop hooks, making it hard to ignore and near impossible not to like. More insistent and deliberately aggressive than the tunes they are modeled after, Get Young's tracks spit their muscular guitars out in percussive bursts, teasing listeners with a playful Jam-like melody or some flirty/flinty synthesized textures. But then, lest they sound too likeably pop, P&N wrap their songs in antagonistically tinny production that leaves them buzzy, muddy, and intentionally amateurish-sounding. Frontman Holden Lewis can't help that his reedy voice recalls Elvis Costello's (though he certainly could avoid the faux-British pronunciation), but it can make it hard to not see every song in light of the comparison. ""Tora Tora Tora"", with its choppy staccatos, sing-along chorus, and churning keyboards, admittedly owes more of a debt to the rhythmic weirdness of Devo. But the way that Lewis delivers his words, with that familiar demanding foghorn of a voice, he may as well be singing ""Radio, Radio"". But Pretty & Nice modernize their sound with computer-age flourishes. Songs like ""Hideaway Tokyo"" and ""Grab Your Nets"" bury a bleeping Nintendo soundtrack underneath their breakneck rhythms and prickly guitars, as if the Attractions added a game of Tetris as their secret mechanical fourth member. And with their fuzzy, blown-speaker frequencies, the keyboards often recall the screaming feedback of Justice's synths rather than the hollowed out 1980s versions of their heroes. Likewise, ""Peekaboo"" is a nice surprise, breaking up the album's disorienting rhythms and shout-singing with its easy, dreamy pulse. On that track Lewis' wispy falsetto spills over thrifty guitar strumming and drummer Bobby Landry's gentle-heartbeat percussion. Pausing for such a break three songs into their throttling collection, Pretty & Nice give you just enough time to catch your breath and give into the reverberating loveliness before diving back into the fray at a pulse-racing pace. It makes sense, then, that their album's title is a demand. It's not We Are Young or You Are Young or even Being Young; it's Get Young, the imperative. Pretty & Nice's songs challenge listeners to keep up with their blasts of catchy melody purposely obfuscated by noisy clatter or aggressive chugging. ""Get with it,"" the collection seems to insist. ""Give in, don't be such an adult!"" Some who won't like Get Young are probably too grown up for its enchantingly juvenile thrill ride, but there's something to be said for taking the album's titular advice to heart.","On their sophomore album, Boston's Pretty & Nice rework the playfully manic, barbed-wire sounds of Devo, XTC, and This Year's Model-era Elvis Costello.

The An Albatross Family Album,An Albatross,by: D.

Fitting for a bunch of dudes whose credo is some sort of mystical mumbo jumbo of cosmic love, fantasy animals, sci-fi weirdness, and-- as the new album expounds on-- space pilgrimages in search of world peace and harmony. And yet, I think they're serious! These love-in rambles only give the ballistic tunes that much more cheeky appeal. For their third full-length, The Family Album, AA continue their psychedelic aural terror, but dig deeper into the annals of kraut and classic rockdom. No doubt influenced by extremo screamo acts like Blood Brothers, At the Drive-In, and the Locust, their breakout EP We Are the Lazer Viking-- and to a lesser extent their second full-length, Blessphemy... of the Peace Beast Feastgiver and the Bear Warp Kumite-- displayed a grindcore/prog-rock hybrid with lots of new-wave synths and dancey spastic grooves. Whereas Blessphemy turned away from the new wave-y stylings in lieu of more organ sounds (Farfisa and Hammond B3) and space synths (Moog and Korg), Family expands on this golden age of keyboard rock (ELP, Deep Purple, King Crimson, Yes). If it weren't for the numbers-crunching turbo drumming, the engine of this operation would have to be keyboardist Phillip Price who seamlessly alternates between sleek interstellar atmospherics, shrieking dissonant attacks, rolling vamps, and carnival-esque monkey grinds. Take ""...And Now Emerges The Silver Pilgrim"", a sideways butt-shakin' number that vibes Arab on Radar (surely another big influence) but within its short two-minute run, flips between Herbie Hancock-like DayGlo splats and three-ringed clown-car chasing. The biggest change in the songs is the way they take already overstuffed freak outs-- usually averaging two and a half minutes-- and add even more textures to ramp up the epic feel: Album closer ""3,000 Light Years By Way of the Spacehawk"" (one of two songs clocking in over six minutes) adds a string section to the cacophony of vocalist Eddie B. Gieda III's bird-like squawk and the band's space truckin' rumble. ""The Psychonaut & The Rustbelt"" explores a kind of Oingo Boingo vaudevillian boogie complete with saxophone, death-metal blast beats, and Gieda's David Yow-channeling howls; and ""A Convivial Feast of the Peace Beast"" highlights ""Riverdance""-on-meth jigs with xylophone sprinkles. Album showpiece ""The Hymn of the Angel People"" pairs more turbo circus music with highbrow art rock: Halfway through the jam, things unravel into a tranquil angelic keyboard-and-saxophone-driven celestial hum where the band ethos gets pontificated by a British-accented poetry-reciting female. Not your dad's prog rock, but equally as smart and a damn sight more engaging.","Genre-splicers An Albatross-- who pack more riffs, time changes, and esoteric rock references in one song than many bands jam into an entire album-- sweeten the pot with string arrangements and assorted uncharacteristic textures.

Grand,Matt & Kim,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a033ea9e61561daa44fa/1:1/w_160/3b403e93.jpg,2009-01-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12593-grand/,Fader,"Maturity is a good look for some bands, but Matt & Kim, at first glance, don't seem the type. Over the past four years, the Brooklyn-based duo made its name from a joyously amateurish EP, a cheerily sloppy debut full-length, and an energetic live show that left a string of sweaty, satisfied audiences in its wake. Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino took Mates of State's spare, co-ed, drum'n'keys set-up and bled it of anything mannered or pretty, leaving just raw, bleeting synthesizers, shouty singing, and relentless drumming. So the last thing we'd expect from this spazzy synth-punk band is a slowed down, gussied-up sophomore effort, but Matt & Kim wear their newfound growth surprisingly well. Their previous recorded material was more like their propulsive stage show, so the first thing you'll notice about Grand is the band explores new textures and diverse dynamics. More than half of the 11-song album lives in the mid- downtempo range, making Grand feel more wistful and intimate than its predecessors-- likely the result of recording in Johnson's childhood bedroom in Vermont. ""Don't Slow Down"", despite its title and ""Just Can't Get Enough""-like staccato melody, proves an insistent kick drum and repeated keyboard stabs can sound reflective and poignant. ""Spare Change"" buoys its droning, buried organ with handclaps and foot stomps but still manages to sound vulnerable and lonely amid the raucous percussion. And ""Turn This Boat Around"", a drum-free ballad built on a charming calliope-like keyboard melody, is almost reverent in its relative stillness. Such changes are welcome-- a good band needs to evolve to continue to stay interesting-- but Matt & Kim are still at their best when they are at their fastest. ""I Wanna"" takes a cue from earlier tracks ""5K"" and ""Yea Yeah"", but even that track measures its breakneck pace with a slow section, settling its demanding verses into a more deliberate, looser groove. Instrumental ""Cinders"" features a melody so happily jerky and rhythms so dangerously spastic that you can practically hear paroxysmal crowds pogo-ing madly. With glossy (by Matt & Kim's DIY standards) production-- double-tracked vocals, synthesizer effects (check that violin-like sound on ""Good Ol' Fashion Nightmare""), and more clarity of sound-- a newfound emphasis is placed on Matt & Kim's words. Luckily, Grand features not only some of the band's most personal lyrics, but also some of its most universal. Though made in a more pastoral setting than these outer-borough denizens are used to, the album's subject matter is still decidedly urban. ""Don't Slow Down"", one of two tracks that namechecks the LP's titular Brooklyn street, is like a hipster ""We Didn't Start The Fire"", listing all of the tiny details of life in the creative underclass. ""Lock knees, no keys/ Brooklyn, Grand Street/ Four flights, late nights/ Black socks, white tights"", sings Johnson, and thousands of other kids in his zip code (and others like it around the country) feel like he's describing their Saturday nights-- even if this album is less of a party than their previous recordings.","Over the past few years, Matt & Kim have taken Mates of State's spare, co-ed, drum'n'keys set-up and bled it of anything mannered or pretty; here, they slow down their spazzy synth-punk, and it suits them well.

Get Guilty,A.C. Newman,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03013d197565213830f/1:1/w_160/7098594d.jpg,2009-01-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12590-get-guilty/,Matador,"Carl Newman's music, whether with New Pornographers or solo, is typically referred to through the deceptive category of ""power pop."" But concentrating on simplicity and force alone unfairly deflects attention from the nuance of Newman's approach-- in his lyrics, arrangements, and delivery, there's always much more going on than can be viewed at a distance. Because of the power pop tag, the emergence of Newman's ""quieter"" side-- best represented by 2004 solo album The Slow Wonder and the Pornographers' overlooked 2007 LP Challengers-- led many to question if, absent the effusive energy, his music was still worthwhile. Wonder's follow-up Get Guilty isn't going to satiate those looking for another Twin Cinema, but it helps solidify the fact-- known to fans for a while now-- that Newman's singularity as a songwriter lies in more than histrionics. Like Wonder, Guilty has its share of up-tempo tracks, yet its real pleasures are idiosyncratic, revealing themselves the more attentively and often you listen. Newman has himself compared (with tongue at least partially in cheek) late-album cut ""The Collected Works"" to Queen's ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", yet that bit of self-deprecation elides what happens after the first verse, when the bottom drops out of the song, leaving a piano to briefly dialogue with what sounds like a tiny, dying violin. ""Like a Hitman, Like a Dancer"" is an acoustic rocker with a recognizably whooped-up chorus, but those two titular characters, in Newman's world, are connected by virtue of the fact that they're ""all muscle."" During the verses of ""Elemental"", the harmonies of Nicole Atkins (along with Mates of State's Kori Gardner, Guilty's female vocal ringer) provide a subtle, high-register hum behind Newman. Gentle, swirling organs subtly enter the frame to signal that song's slight shift to a refrain, recalling the stately psychedelia of Elvis Costello's Imperial Bedroom. Like some of Costello's music, much of Guilty feels like a gambit-- a playful way of unsettling expectations with a fun-house mirror approach to musical structure and a fondness for meta-narratives. Newman, like buddy and collaborator Dan Bejar, has always turned his (and our) attention back toward the process of creating (see also: ""The Fake Headlines"", ""Twin Cinema""). The title Get Guilty is a deliberate wink toward postmodern author Donald Barthelme, and ""The Palace at 4 AM"" is a meta-romantic homage to the act of writing, nestled inside a life-on-the-road tale. On the stately, cascading album-opener ""There Are Maybe Ten or Twelve"", after singing the song's first lyric, Newman throws us off his path: ""That wasn't the opening line, it was the tenth or the twelfth. Make of that what you will."" Because he knows how to imbue them with purpose and drive, Newman's narrative fragments and impressionistic lyrics can work just as well without self-reflexivity. On ""The Heartbreak Rides"", one of his dozen or so best compositions to date, he sings, in his irresistibly nerdy falsetto: ""She led the modern sunset to your window, gestured with a plain-Jane hand, she said 'Let's go.'"" We don't get a direct sense of what the adventure entails, but the suggestion alone, like the song, is invigorating, like an unplanned road trip or the anxious rush of a romantic relationship. Always his own biggest critic, Newman remembers his youthful capriciousness on the string-flecked, nostalgic ""Thunderbolts"", singing ""We played it too green to start, to play it with any art,"" as the song pushes toward a crescendo that never comes. Perhaps he's remembering the time when it seemed only natural to substitute verse-chorus-verse with the much more satisfying ""chorus-CHORUS-CHORUS!!!"" and describe his group as mass romantics and new pornographers. Yet like ""Thunderbolts"", those ironic descriptors-- suggesting that his music inspired awe by appealing to sensations more than emotions-- indicate Newman's modesty more than they define his art. Revisit his earlier records with an ear toward refinement instead of sheer voltage, and the roots of Get Guilty will clearly reveal themselves amidst the clamor.","New Pornographers leader Carl Newman's second album follows the cues of his relatively quieter work-- 2004 solo album The Slow Wonder and the Pornographers' overlooked Challengers-- but still helps solidify him as a singular songwriter.

Stray Age,Daniel Martin Moore,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02eea9e61561daa44ec/1:1/w_160/be5076e3.jpg,2009-01-20 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12588-stray-age/,Sub Pop,"The one big headline that accompanies Stray Age, the debut album from Kentucky-based singer-songwriter Daniel Martin Moore, is that Sub Pop signed him based solely upon the strength of an unsolicited 4-song demo. And given Moore's humble songwriting and performing style, one might easily assume that this could be the only headline he's ever interested in making. So understated is Stray Age, in fact, that it is at least initially difficult to hear what exactly sparked Sub Pop's immediate enthusiasm, as there is nothing about this music that exactly explodes out of the speakers. Co-produced by Joe Chiccarelli-- whose extensive credits include work with U2, Beck, and the Shins-- the album is so hushed and intimate that most of it sounds like it could have been recorded with Moore seated in his favorite chair beneath the backyard oak tree. Technically, Moore's gentle, folk-based Americana is not miles apart from labelmates Iron and Wine or Fleet Foxes, but there is a straightforward simplicity to his work that immediately positions him at the most sonically conservative end of the Sub Pop spectrum. As a vocalist, Moore can call to mind a less-mannered Will Oldham, or perhaps what Mark Lanegan might've sounded like several thousand cigarettes ago. On Stray Age Moore's plainspoken vocals are frequently accompanied by little more than a lone acoustic guitar or piano, placing an enormous burden directly on the songs themselves. This is always a risky strategy, as it virtually guarantees that a handful of the better songs here will outshine the rest, patching the album with several minor dips and lulls. (Of course, it doesn't help that there is nothing particularly distinctive or memorable about any of Moore's homespun lyrics.) On the album's best tracks Moore is able to display an unforced, instinctive grace, giving his songs the necessary space to move so they can eventually steal in like shadows, lodging themselves firmly in the rafters of memory.
 
Stray Age does feature several cameo appearances from guest musicians, including Petra Haden on violin, Justin Meldal-Johnsen on upright bass, and Jesca Hoop on backing vocals. In these spare surroundings, each subtle addition can make a crucial difference, such as the lift Haden's violin provides midway through ""It's You"" to pull the gentle love song out of its tranquil slumbers, or the way Hoop's bracing harmonies help ""The Old Measure"" sound downright frisky. Elsewhere, however, Moore keeps his music stripped to the essentials, an approach that succeeds on the richly melodic ""By Dream"" or the introspective title track, but that eventually stalls the album's momentum before the (perhaps appropriately) narcotic closing track ""The Hour of Sleep"" wheels around. In addition to Moore's ten original songs, the album also includes a cover of Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"", a track that serves as well as any to represent Stray Age's dreamy, wistful tenor. Well-rendered though this cover is, Moore does little to reinterpret or reinvent Denny's song to his own design, and in so doing illustrates a general disregard for innovation. Simply delivered and packaged, Stray Age requires a considerable amount of patience from its audience, and truth be told if it hadn't been for Sub Pop's patronage I probably wouldn't have given Moore as many chances as it took for even his best songs to sink in. Promising though Stray Age can be, next time hopefully Moore takes pains to make more headlines through his music itself.","With help from Petra Haden and Jesca Hoop, Kentucky-based singer-songwriter Daniel Martin Moore very quietly delivers his Sub Pop debut.

How Shadows Chase the Balance,Boduf Songs,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc0c0084474cd0c2d80/1:1/w_160/4e5276a3.jpeg,2009-01-20 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12578-how-shadows-chase-the-balance/,Kranky,"According to Kranky, Boduf Songs' Mat Sweet is a musical fringe-dweller, a genuine outsider who participates in no ""scene"" and generally eschews the music business' promotional apparatus. Given the underground's long and relatively successful tradition of home-taping, self-releasing, and other sideways strategies for fanbase- and community-building, that's easily debated. You don't need to maintain a MySpace page (Boduf Songs doesn't) or do something like shake tambourines with Devendra and Joanna for an Arthur spread to participate in a larger cultural movement. In fact, the recipe that's nourished this one-man project over three LPs and several shorter recordings-- psych-tinged acoustic ramblings, spackle-thick atmosphere, and morbid lyrical preoccupations-- will be familiar to anyone who's spent time with the more apocalyptic segment of the robust indie-folk scene (see: Ben Chasny, David Thomas Broughton, and stylistic godfather David Tibet). Which is to say, a Boduf Songs record can be challenging, but is usually worth the effort. Ironically, it's in support of his most accessible record to date, How Shadows Chase the Balance, that Sweet's work is being promoted as a sub-basement to the underground. Where previous long-player Lion Devours the Sun often winged off (successfully) on found-sound and noise tangents, Shadows hews to popular song conventions; a couple of tracks even tender soft, shuffling percussion. Most are unhurried affairs that seep in like warm bathwater on streams of static, droned feedback, electronic pulses and field recordings, fluttering and throbbing acoustic strings, and Sweet's own grave murmur. But if songs like ""Mission Creep"" and ""I Can't See a Thing in Here"" develop incrementally, once they get where they're going, they're effective and affecting, with sticky-sweet melodies and compelling textures. This album's approachability, in fact, seems to come from Sweet's truce with sonic beauty. Boduf Songs provided glimpses of pretty in the past, but they were ephemeral as jellyfish, and just as menacing. Shadows' banjo-festooned tracks ""Things Not to Be Done on the Sabbath"" and ""Last Glimmer on a Hill at Dusk"", however, are night-blooming flowers that retain their glory past sunrise. The latter, with its swaying valedictory close, could slip unobtrusively onto a Sufjan Stevens tracklist-- as long as you disregard Sweet's Manichean outlook, that is. In Boduf Songs' brutal theology, darkness devours light, death defeats the living and nature and culture are at perpetual fisticuffs. The lyrical idiom is correspondingly pitiless: ""We fell to earth from pitch-black skies/ we feed upon the left behind"" (""Things Not to Be Done on the Sabbath""), ""We come to pick your bones/ Out of its eyes and through your skull"" (""I Can't See a Thing in Here""), or ""Lay down in the lamplight... tucked in on a bed of nails"" (""Last Glimmer on a Hill at Dusk"").
 
Perhaps the guy brings his day job at a Southampton university library home with him, because Boduf Songs is undoubtedly a textually dense, heavy tome to lift. That said, the music never becomes  inpenetrable, offputting or ""interesting"" but, alas, unlistenable. If it seems a strange critical tack to praise an independent musician by downplaying his underground credentials or off-road tendencies, it's only because I think music fans who might otherwise be put off by indier-than-thou rhetoric would actually really dig Boduf Songs.","Latest and most accessible record to date from Boduf Songs, Kranky's rep in the more apocalyptic segment of the robust indie-folk scene that also includes Ben Chasny, David Thomas Broughton, and stylistic godfather David Tibet.

Kuduro, which mixes rai and soca rhythms with local MCing and salvaged electronics, is the product of the same kind of environment and pressure that produced baile funk in Rio and kwaito in South Africa-- musics which make good touchpoints for kuduro's breakneck appeal. It was born in the Angolan capital Luanda and quickly jumped along post-colonial transmission lines to Lisbon, home of Buraka Som Sistema. The Buraka sound has been picked up by global tastemakers like Diplo and M.I.A., and debut album Black Diamond gives the crew an opportunity to show how kuduro works at fuller stretch-- and whether it can survive outside its specific locality. Kuduro is a pun on Angola slang for ""hard ass""-- much of Black Diamond takes this as an operating principle. Buraka Som Sistema tracks often have the marvelous thickness of early jungle, that sense of pushing through electronic thickets, senses on hyper-alert. But their rhythmic template is more often the relentless bounce of soca. Soca's perpetual chirpiness makes it an acquired taste, but there's no denying its kinetic power, and blended with Buraka's harder beats and harsher sounds it becomes a fearsome engine for their music. The first few tracks are both introduction and pummeling workout-- the frantic M.I.A. team-up ""Sound of Kuduro"" sets the tone for highlights ""Aqui Para Voces"" and ""Kalemba (Wegue Wegue)"", which are less chaotic but even more exhilarating. Opener ""Luanda/Lisboa"" starts with a keyboard throb that sounds like a generator powering up to the band can get enough juice to even play, and what's so attractive about the album is its constant flirtation with collapse-- everything's so furious, so quick-changing, so ramshackle that its tracks sound half-improvised. New riffs, bleeps and blurts constantly intrude, upsetting a tune's direction: the transitions between tracks are more like collisions. A song like ""IC19"" spends a while groping for a viable rhythm before rattling off on a chassis built from old school rave, dodging blasts of electro like oncoming traffic, before suddenly switching into the trancier, dirtier ""Tiroza"". Which in turn breaks down into what sounds like Portuguese folk music played on a crackly radio, a tune that becomes the digitally-tweaked basis for ""General""-- a song that halfway through bursts into a gloriously goofy ringtone melody. ""General"" is a good example of the group's more playful and atmospheric side, which emerges again when the tempo drops on the two-part ""New Africas"": their rumbling drum patterns show that the group's electro-world fusions survive a change in pace, but the somewhat mystical voiceover is an uneasy fit with the rest of the record's sharpness. Then again, not speaking Portuguese means I can't get the political references which are a big part of kuduro's Angolan appeal. As a sop to tourists like me, DJ Lil John has talked in interviews about how the band treat the voice as a percussive instrument, and it's an approach that works, with Kano's anglophone guest spot on ""Skank & Move"" an unwelcome spell-breaker. But even if you don't have the language skills to get their full story, Buraka Som Sistema are worth your time: Black Diamond is one of the fiercest dance records in recent memory.","The product of the same kind of environment and pressure that produced baile funk in Rio and kwaito in South Africa, the Angolan take on dance music called kuduro has a wonderful set of ambassadors in Buraka Som Sistema.

Johnny Cash Remixed,Various Artists,by: Stephen M.

But no, Johnny Cash Remixed is nothing quite so earth shattering or notable. It's more like a small, remote geyser through which a little bit of hell bubbles up into our world. Don't get me wrong: I don't consider Cash's persona or his music sacrosanct, so I have no reservations about any artist wildly re-imagining or remixing his songs. In fact, the Man in Black has become such a paragon of Americana ideals that a little pedestal wobbling could be more than welcome. We need a new way to look at Cash and his music, but Remixed isn't it. These artists are engaging more closely with the myth than with the music, which means this project, dubious even at conception, becomes just another needless attempt to argue for Cash's relevance. Alabama 3 are the worst of the lot, continuing their streak of lame hick-hop gothicisms that started well before their overrated ""Sopranos"" theme. They rewrite ""Leave That Junk Alone"" as a startlingly obvious cautionary tale in which they play the junkies that saintly J.C. must counsel. Never mind that Cash was never so saintly, that his own battles with that junk were more complicated than a standard recovery narrative would suggest, or that such ambiguity was key to his lasting appeal and moral authority. Instead, Alabama 3 give an overly simple portrait of the man over tired beats, and it's not hard to imagine him rising from the grave to counsel them against creating such junk music. Not simply unnecessary or misguided, Johnny Cash Remixed actively degrades Cash's legacy by showing how silly he sounds in such a determinedly modern context. And by ""modern"" I mean circa 1999. Midnight Juggernauts remix ""Port of Lonely Hearts"" with ethereal voices washing over the verses, and it might appeal to someone who still spins Play on a regular basis. At least it doesn't sound like Voodoo Child: Cash's ""Get Rhythm"" is so peripheral to the big beats of Philip Steir's remake that you could conceivably insert any song-- ""Umbrella"", ""Hey Ya!"", ""Yes We Have No Bananas""-- with no noticeable change. Hey, Philip! Get rhythm. Pete Rock's take on ""Folsom Prison Blues"" sounds inspired by Jon Spencer's risible remixes of R.L. Burnside, leaving Cash to sound like he singing from a stalled Ferris wheel rather than from a dank cell, and Sonny J remixes ""Country Boy"" to sound like ""Cotton Eye Joe"" by Rednex. Listening to it is like looking deep into the abyss and feeling only the coldness of cosmic solitude. You live alone, you die alone. Obviously these aren't the most innovative artists anymore, which leaves you wondering what someone like Dan Deacon or Girl Talk or the Avalanches might do with this raw material. The biggest name here is Snoop Dogg, who actually gets a producer credit despite being on autopilot for the remix of ""I Walk the Line"" by QDT Music (DJ Quik, Dogg, and Teddy Riley). Says the rapper who recorded Doggy Style: ""Big Snoop Dogg. Johnny Cash. Remix. 'Walk the Line'. Yo, Johnny, talk to 'em for a minute."" Responds a sample of the guy who recorded At Folsom Prison: ""I keep a close watch on this heart of mine..."" It's an absolutely ludicrous moment in a relentlessly ludicrous song-- a parody of hero worship. But at least we'll get to see the pool this project helped pay for on the next season of Fatherhood. So why doesn't this hell geyser get the full 0.0? Mainly for Count De Money's ""Big River"", which leaves that junk alone and subtly ratchets the Tennessee Two's rockabilly rhythm into a spry programmed beat. Despite retaining Cash's original vocal track, this remix says more about Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant than it does about Cash, specifically the way they were able to twist guitar and bass into an insistent, organic stomp. Not that you need this remix to point that out. Despite its redundancy, at least ""Big River"" has something interesting to say about Cash's music. That makes it an anomaly on an album that relies almost solely on received wisdom and perpetuates a tired hagiography that makes Cash seem less human with every year. The Cash boom is over.

Blood Bank EP,Bon Iver,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a026b1335d7bf1697f5e/1:1/w_160/d38fc853.jpg,2009-01-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12581-blood-bank-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"For Emma, Forever Ago-- Bon Iver's 2007 debut LP-- was nearly eclipsed by its own (endlessly repeated) mythology. Famously: Singer and songwriter Justin Vernon curled up in a ""remote northern Wisconsin cabin"" for three epic, torturous months of post-heartbreak introspection/catharsis, writing the songs which would ultimately comprise his first solo album. For Emma was self-released by Vernon before being picked up by Jagjaguwar and afforded a proper launch; grateful listeners swooned and shivered, circling the record like kids around a bonfire. For Emma became synonymous with dark winter ennui: the musical translation of earth's cruelest season. By the end of 2008, Bon Iver-- along with similarly bearded, folk-minded acts like Fleet Foxes-- became emblematic of a new, woodsier trend in indie rock. Although it boasted its own brand of (presumably unintentional) theater, For Emma was frequently cited as an antidote of sorts to Auto-Tuned, vocoder-laden pop. It seems particularly skewering, then, that Bon Iver's four-song follow-up-- the Blood Bank EP-- closes with a long, a cappella folk song wherein Vernon's voice is so aggressively filtered through a vocoder that you're likely to back off the stereo and double-check the contents of your drink. Recorded in four different locations at varying times (from December 2006 through June 2008, in an assortment of apartments, roads, hunting lodges, and studios), Blood Bank's A-side (""Blood Bank"", ""Beach Baby"") is considerably less jarring than its second half, although neither feels unprecedented-- while Vernon wrote these songs to be played with a band (unlike on For Emma, Vernon's got two steady backers here), the EP is still imbued with all the intimacy and desperation that made For Emma so beloved. ""Blood Bank"" opens with prodding acoustic strums and a series of hushed ""oohs"" (unmistakably reminiscent of Iron and Wine's lo-fi debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle), before Vernon begins: ""I met you at the blood bank, we were looking at the bags,"" he explains, tossing off the kind of opening sentence most aspiring novelists spend their whole lives praying for. ""Beach Baby"", with its steel guitar and stomach-punching lyrics (""When you're out, tell your lucky one to know that you'll leave/ But don't you lock when you're fleeing, I'd like not to hear keys"") feels spare and fleeting, disappearing into the runout groove before you realize it's over. ""Babys"" features a prickly, unrelenting keyboard riff and a curiously zoological refrain (""Summer comes, to multiply!"") but ""Woods"" is the most intriguing cut here: For armchairists prone to detached psychoanalysis, For Emma's legend might suggest that Vernon has a penchant for escapism, and there's no easier way to eschew the crags of your own voice than by piling on studio effects. Vocoder isn't exactly a shack in the mountains, but, when employed to excess, it's about as close as a vocalist can get to going off-grid. Still, ""Woods"" feels like more of a formal experiment than an emotional one, and the results are oddly and unexpectedly stunning. Vernon's folksinger-in-a-cabin origins might not be exceptional, but ""Woods"" sort of is-- it's disorienting and delicate, a mix of Vernon's staunchly organic vocals and otherworldly effects, punctuated, on occasion, by sharp, falsetto howls. It's the kind of thing that sounds hideous on paper, but eventually coalesces in practice; ironically, the Auto-Tune serves as more of a muddler than a safety net, and without it, it's hard to know if ""Woods"" would feel so intoxicating. Blood Bank certainly dispels concerns that Vernon's accomplishment was somehow environmental-- that For Emma's poetic circumstances, and not its contents, were responsible for its success. Blood Bank is still a wintry record-- there's snow on the cover, and lyrics about snow, and, if you listen on vinyl, the metaphorical snow of hissing surface noise-- but Bon Iver is hardly a seasonal taste.",,7.9,
Exotic Creatures of the Deep,Sparks,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a021b1335d7bf1697f54/1:1/w_160/d1272440.jpg,2009-01-19 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12575-exotic-creatures-of-the-deep/,Lil' Beethoven,"After decades of standing at the fringes of whatever kind of pop seemed modish, snickering, L.A.'s Sparks reinvented themselves impressively with 2002's Lil' Beethoven. That record's premise-- Russell Mael overdubbing himself into a mock-operatic chorus and playing up his mock-operatic diction, his brother Ron supplying mock-dignified orchestrations and keyboards, songs built around amusingly banal phrases endlessly repeated--was also the basis for 2006's even better Hello Young Lovers. And it's returned for this record, whose theme, to whatever extent it has one, is the collision of dignity and indignity, hence Ron Mael being replaced on the front cover by a chimp in a tuxedo. This time, though, the premise has worn thin. Virtually every song enunciates its central joke, then repeats it and repeats it and repeats it. And repeats it. And repeats it. And so on, with the repeating. (And repeating.) Very often, the title (""Let the Monkey Drive"", ""(She Got Me) Pregnant"") gives the whole thing away. Admittedly, ""Intro Reprise"" is a pretty good joke. So is ""I Can't Believe That You Would Fall For All the Crap in This Song"", by far the best song here because it's got actual dynamics and an actual groove: a smirky glam gallop underscored with a fabulous buzzing synth. Still, they're almost all jokes first and foremost, and very shallow jokes. The best Sparks songs-- ""Angst in My Pants"", ""Dick Around"", ""Throw Her Away (And Get a New One)"", ""This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us""-- have almost always twined emotional cut-and-thrust with their boffo yocks. These don't, even when they have the opportunity to. ""Good Morning"", for instance, starts with the premise of waking up next to a gorgeous stranger, and never gets very far past it: ""It must have been the best line from me ever"" is potentially funny, but not exactly biting, and it's undercut by Russell's lookit-me-I'm-a-stuffed-shirt delivery. ""Strange Animal"", in fact, addresses the problem with the current state of the Maels' songwriting head-on: a stranger walks into a song, does a bit more fourth-wall-breaking tomfoolery, then apologizes for noting that ""the song lacks a heart, comes off overly smart/ An emotional core, ain't that what songs are for?"" A bit later, he complains that it doesn't have a specific goal: ""Entertainment or art, one should know from the start."" Either the Maels think those ends really are distinct, which given the last 35 years' worth of their career is mighty unlikely, or they're trying to make their character look churlish as a proleptic response to their audience. Both possibilities are vaguely insulting. Even when the Maels' wit maintains a bit of its gleam, the incantatory, cod-classical mode in which they've entrenched themselves doesn't reliably work for them. ""Lighten Up, Morrissey"" is a great title, and a solid if lightweight lyrical conceit: ""If only Morrissey weren't so Morrisseyesque/ She might overlook all my flaws."" But it's so neo-Sparks-esque-- so stiff and mannered, so reliant on pounding in its catchphrase and central hook to the point of absurdity and beyond-- that it turns tedious. Loosen up, Sparks.","L.A. underground rock institution follows a recent upswing that began with 2002's Lil' Beethoven with a joke-filled album that explores the collision of dignity and indignity.

Tail Swallower & Dove,These Arms Are Snakes,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02bc0084474cd0bfad8/1:1/w_160/4bf093be.jpg,2009-01-19 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12585-tail-swallower-dove/,Suicide Squeeze,"As veterans of Minneapolis punk and hardcore math-rock bands, the members of These Arms are Snakes continue to tap that same angst and aggression of those scenes on this, their third full-length. In the tradition of many post-hardcore bands, there are winding time signatures, grinding guitars, and strained, often obtuse lyrics-- ""Prince Squid"" starts with a theatrical bellow over fast and heavy drum rolls, ""He wants to be the big shot in your eyes/ But he's in FLUX MEMORANDUM."" You know, your typical boy-meets-girl confusion. But there's no reason to get down on TAAS for the trappings of their sub-genre (or for not picking a name that makes a catchier acronym). While they're continuing in a tradition, it's clear from Tail Swallower & Dove that their ears have remained open. Swallower may feel familiar at first, but it's a record with many left turns. Some of them are more subtle than others. Opener ""Woolen Heirs"" starts out surging and swinging, with acrobatic guitar lines and punishing rhythms, but has a cool-down that includes faux-tribal chanting and some keyboard effects that'd be more at home on a Steve Miller record. And then there's repetition and patience in the closing minutes of near-epic ""Ethric Double"", marrying sparse, ominous jangle and a near-martial backbeat to a more traditional metal sound by the end. The second half of the record has the band stumbling and sputtering around foreboding electronic landscapes, growing more coldly mechanical with the end of ""Long and Lonely Step"" before the jagged lurch of ""Lead Beater"" and pitch-shifted vocals of ""Cavity Carousel"". The rhythm section bludgeons and swings with authority throughout all of it, with a surprising (and welcome) amount of the latter. While the keyboards and chanting in ""Woolen Heirs"" might illicit a giggle and the 8-bit electric piano groove on ""Lucifer"" is a little close to late-career Blood Brothers for comfort, for all the band's stylistic wavering and kitchen-sink compositions, they usually seem to land squarely on their feet. There's a lot of balance on Swallower-- the songs are diverse without losing their taut and tortured center, and they even balance prog-rock indulgences with songs that prize catharsis and big riffs above all. But in that diversity, they never fully inhabit one mode or the other. These guys are capable of a lot more than you might first assume, and yet, it'd be interesting to hear what they could pull off if they focused in just one direction.","As do mathy post-hardcore bands, Seattle-based These Arms Are Snakes deploy winding time signatures, grinding guitars, and strained, often obtuse lyrics.

1-2-3/Apple Tree EP / Next Year in Zion,Herman Dune,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a028b1335d7bf1697f64/1:1/w_160/e4a21365.gif,2009-01-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12583-1-2-3apple-tree-ep-next-year-in-zion/,Everloving,"In the United States, 2008 was a banner year for Herman Dune, the Franco-Swedish sibling duo of David-Ivar Herman Düne (the one with the beard) and Néman Herman Dune (the other one). Following the almost viral success of their video for ""I Wish That I Could See You Soon"", the band toured the States, played some festivals, and lined up three domestic releases: two EPs, I Wish That I Could See You Soon and 1-2-3/Apple Tree, and one full-length, Next Year in Zion. On each, the duo get by on naïve charm, affecting wonder and innocence even in the face of great tragedy, which gives David-Ivar's wordy lyrics and talky vocals an undercurrent real melancholy and which makes Herman Dune sound more substantial than most artists in the so-called anti-folk scene. Like the I Wish That I could See You Soon EP, 1-2-3/Apple Tree corrals a few B-sides behind a catchy, starry-eyed single. The title track is disarmingly simple in its construction (numerous verses, no chorus), but makes the most of juxtaposing flutes and guitars against David-Ivar's genial wordplay. The unassuming openness he's trying to communicate in the song comes through in the music, and the four songs that follow tease out similar ideas about affection and need. Despite the Kimya Dawson shout-out, the minor-key ""Your Name My Game"" sound apocalyptic by comparison to the upbeat title track, placing a tense guitar solo against David-Ivar's description of crows and deer acting out his own romantic angst. ""Song for Golda"", about his beloved dog, is a tender antidote for anyone who was dragged to Marley & Me, while ""Song of Samuel"", about a Jewish violin teacher in love with his pupil, sounds at first like a fable, but turns out to have the gravity of an old family story passed down through generations. Even its happy ending sounds earned. On 1-2-3/Apple Tree, Herman Dune seem determined to show their every facet and prove what all they can do with their limited set-up. Unfortunately, Next Year in Zion doesn't follow up on that. Perhaps because there is no obvious single to anchor the release (with its gentle horns and heraldic guitars, opener ""On a Saturday"" comes close), everything here sounds like a B-side. ""Try to Think About Me (Don't You Worry a Bit)"" and the slightly condescending ""Baby Is Afraid of Sharks"" both stumble on snoozy verses and only perk up on their very short choruses, and ""An Afternoon Dance Party"" and ""Lovers Are Waterproof"" get tangled up in their dense storylines. Herman Dune's particular charms aren't altogether missing from Next Year in Zion. On ""When the Sun Rose Up This Morning"", David-Ivar forgets a neglectful parent when a lover smiles at him; simple pleasures, he implies, can compensate for life's massive tragedies. Elsewhere, he gets a lot of mileage out of clever rhymes and oddball phrasing. On the title track, he manages to match ""Zion"" with ""fight like a giant,"" ""made of iron,"" and-- most memorably-- ""There are healthier things that I now get high on."" In general, though, the album sounds muted and lagging, emphasizing hazy melancholy over specific joy. We know Herman Dune can find a better balance.",,7.6,
Radio Retaliation,Thievery Corporation,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03f9d034d5c69bf2684/1:1/w_160/88af7afb.jpg,2009-01-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12602-radio-retaliation/,Eighteenth Street Lounge,"Even at the height of their popularity in the late 1990s and early 00s, it was always difficult to imagine anyone getting worked up over Thievery Corporation. A watery cocktail of cul de sac genres like downtempo, lounge, and ""world music"" (more on that in a second), the Washington D.C. duo's output has long worn its own inoffensiveness as a badge. If the fact that the press release for this album ledes with a quote touting them as ""quintessential ambassadors of the sophisticated global 'downbeat generation'"" doesn't put you on the scent of their relentless dedication to tastefulness, witness 2007's cover album, Versions, whose patently box-ticking tracklist included re-workings of songs by Sarah McLachlan, the Doors, and Astrud Gilberto. Eclectic!
 
Cover albums and mixes aside, Radio Retaliation is the pair's fifth studio album, and finds them once again failing to make anything but the most minute adjustments to the polite groove that is their stock, trade and-- in 2009-- monopoly. These guys have always been producers before songwriters, and, as such, their aesthetic reveals itself not through what they do, but rather, how they do it. Every broody atmosphere pad here is instructively reverbed, every rhythm perfectly loping, every whooshy sound effect painstakingly placed, every bluesy guitar curl appropriately perky, every edge sanded off, each fleck of grit, gristle and emotion dutifully rubbed out and dispensed with. With few exceptions, Radio Retaliation is both perfect and perfectly boring. Queen believed they were put on this earth to rock you; Thievery Corporation appear to have similar goals vis-à-vis anaesthetizing you. Now: the world music thing. At the very least, one might argue that the spate of travelogue-y lounge and downtempo mixes that lived in those chintzy cardboard cutout displays in major chain record stores around the late 90s and early 00s represented a necessary step forward in the legitimization and mainstreaming of non-Western music. This was before the full impact of the Internet and the MP3, don't forget; all music cost something, and any kind of musical curiosity still represented financial risk. In that climate, the slipstreaming of exotic sounds into mixes by reassuringly familiar DJs provided a degree of indemnity against that risk. So, even despite the fact that they almost always ended up diluting that which they were ostensibly championing, acts like Thievery Corporation provided a unique sort of utility. In 2009, things are very different, and yet, suspended in amber as Thievery Corporation's sensibilities are, Radio Retaliation's collaborations with Femi Kuti, Seu Jorge, and Anoushka Shankar still have the unfortunate effect of conjuring those weirdly uneven power dynamics. Kuti's track (""Vampires"") is easily the best thing here, but it doesn't compare, viscerally, to his own recordings. Meanwhile, Jorge and Shankar's contributions feel like they might as well have been recorded 10 years ago for some tokenistic, upmarket, double-disc dinner party compilation called Global Soundz. If you remember those records, and are perhaps embarrassed that they were even tangentially a part of your life, you might have a similar twinge of unease about hearing someone revive the template now. This is all, of course, in no way meant to suggest that Thievery Corporation are doing anything other than what sounds good to them; sometimes, though, tastefulness is its own worst enemy.","Will people host tasteful, upmarket dinner parties during the economic recession?

The Crying Light,Antony and the Johnsons,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a036c0084474cd0bfaf1/1:1/w_160/04a0d270.jpg,2009-01-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12596-the-crying-light/,Secretly Canadian,"The cover of The Crying Light, the third album by Antony and the Johnsons, is strikingly similar to that of its predecessor, 2005's highly-lauded I Am a Bird Now. The latter presented a stark black-and-white shot of transvestite performer Candy Darling lying on her hospital deathbed; this time, we get an even starker image of Japanese Butoh dancer Kazuo Ohno, a hero of bandleader Antony Hegarty since he first spotted her on a poster while studying in France as a teenager. As Ohno leans back, wrinkled and seemingly near death himself, the flower in his hair sits in the same position as the bright blooms that hover above Darling. But it's the differences between these shots that say the most about The Crying Light. Much of what the Darling image represents-- gender identity, performance art, downtown New York circa Andy Warhol's Factory-- is reflected in *I Am A Bird Now'*s stylistic range, as well as its use of guest artists who embody those subjects, like Lou Reed and Boy George. The symbolism of the Ohno picture is simpler. The dancer, cited by Hegarty as his role model for ""getting older as an artist,"" is now 102 and can no longer move or speak; he's been cast into a limbo between life and death. ""He really practiced his form until he couldn't move,"" Hegarty told The Wire magazine in December. ""And then he kept taking the right steps inside himself."" On The Crying Light, Hegarty is fascinated with those steps-- the transitions and overlaps between birth and life, life and death, this world and the next. ""From your skin I am born again,"" he sings in ""One Dove"", an ode to a bird from ""the other side"" that comes to ""bring me some peace."" Later, ""Aeon"" depicts eternity as a baby boy born to take care of his father, as time melts generations together. Similar concepts dot every song. With deft touch, Hegarty repeatedly uses words like ""womb,"" ""grave,"" and ""light,"" and he returns to primal metaphors-- water as life, dust as death, the earth as a place of both burial and growth. ""I'm only a child/ Born upon a grave,"" he insists in ""Kiss My Name"", nearly encapsulating the entire album in one potent declarative. Though easier to summarize, these ideas are no less complex than those on I Am A Bird Now. In fact, they're larger and more universal than that album's New York-tinted perspective. But they have also inspired Hegarty to craft simpler, subtler songs. Simultaneously sparse and rich, The Crying Light mines maximum intensity from a relatively minimal mix of basic melodies, pithy lyrics, and understated arrangements. It may be difficult to believe that an album crediting four arrangers and upwards of two dozen musicians could sound minimal. But the way Hegarty selects their contributions is more about precision than volume, more about carefully-chosen moments than multiple voices. Take the dark cello that closes ""Her Eyes Are Underneath the Ground"", the soft horn flourish in the middle of ""Epilepsy Is Dancing"", the fingersnap-like clicks at the end of ""The Crying Light"". These elements hint at fuller, busier versions of these songs. Maybe Hegarty did record more fleshed-out takes and then erased portions, letting their echoes float in the limbo that he sings about. Whatever his process, Hegarty's use of orchestration for accent and emphasis creates undeniable power, the kind that increased sonic density likely would have lacked. Of course, lots of power also comes from Hegarty's voice. What's most impressive about his singing isn't its range-- though his octave-gliding trill remains spellbinding-- but the way he consistently picks the right tone at the right time. On ""Epilepsy Is Dancing"", his hum crests into a shivery warble just as the song veers into surreal imagery. He flips the trick on ""Daylight and the Sun,"" pulling back during the most plaintive lines (""Now I cry for daylight""), then purring fluidly through an unexpected epilogue. Most striking is ""Dust and Water,"" a droning meditiation in which his lullaby tones seem sung in a foreign language, despite the plain English found on the lyric sheet. The Crying Light ends with ""Everglade"", one of the tracks Hegarty co-arranged with classical composer Nico Muhly. Filled with lilting flutes, rising strings, and operatic croon, it might be the most overtly dramatic track in the Johnsons' oeuvre, like a rescued score from some lost musical. ""When I'm peeping in a parlour of trees/ And the leaves are winking all around,"" he sings, ""'I'm home,"" my heart sobs in my veins."" That may read ultra-drippy, but on record it sounds decidedly profound-- a fully-earned approach to the precipice of the other world Hegarty has pondered for 40 fascinating minutes. In fact, the song's redemptive tone inspires similarly wild thoughts about the future. If Hegarty can craft an album this stunning about the path to paradise, just imagine how great the next one could sound, once he's actually there.","On The Crying Light, Antony Hegarty remains fascinated with the transitions and overlaps between birth and life, life and death, this world and the next, but he expresses them in more universal, more direct, but no less rapturous terms than he did on his New York-tinted breakthrough I Am a Bird Now.
