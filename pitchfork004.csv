Marry Me,St. Vincent,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18cc0084474cd0c1e24/1:1/w_160/40878edb.jpg,2007-07-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10457-marry-me/,Beggars Banquet,"""The most powerful weapon to conquer the devil is humility. For, as he does not know at all how to employ it, neither does he know how to defend himself from it."" -Saint Vincent de Paul (b. 1581 - d. 1660) Maybe that explains it. Maybe that quote from the real Saint Vincent, namesake of multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark's nom du rock, explains why, rather than step right into the spotlight, Clark instead chose to spend so much of her time as an oft-befrocked member of both Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree's flock. One might have assumed that, hey, maybe she was just more comfortable as a group utility player, but like most assumptions it's simply not borne out by the imposing reality of her various talents. As her St. Vincent debut immediately asserts, Clark's more than ready to be out front. In fact, it's amazing she didn't step into the spotlight sooner, considering the countless ideas swirling about Marry Me, an art-rock album at times redolent of prime Kate Bush and Lodger-era David Bowie. Maybe ""humility"" isn't the first word that springs to mind when you read the liners crediting Clark with ""voices, guitars, bass, piano, organ, Moog, synthesizers, clavieta, xylophone, vibraphone, dulcimer, drum programming, triangle, percussion."" Triangle? Is that really something to boast about? Then again, with its brilliant production flourishes and impeccably left-field arrangements, false modesty does not behoove the disc. In the case of music like this, the devil to conquer is preciousness and indulgence. No doubt, in lesser hands Clark's quirks and eccentricities would mark the St. Vincent project a no-go from the start. But at every turn Marry Me takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly sui generis vision into vibrant life. Clark's hardly alone in the endeavor. Not to be out-Spreed, Marry Me features, among other helpers, a chorus (used mostly as melodic and rhythmic counterpoint), Bowie pianist Mike Garson, and Polyphonic Spree/Man Or Astro-Man? drummer Brian Teasley, a wiz at picking the right beats for all the perfectly wrong places. But from the frenetic first half of the disc, where the ideas are coming fast and furious and Clark lets her inner prog run wild, to the mellow second, Marry Me is clearly the product of one person's fertile-- and clearly very well organized-- subconscious. ""Now, Now"" dances around a tricky little guitar pattern and Clark's sweet vocal melodies-- her big-girl voice a welcome respite from indie rock's lame habit of faux naivety-- as bass and drums push and pull the song taut then loose again. The grace of the track suddenly gives way to explosive guitar, the previous precision dissolved into distorted passion. ""Jesus Saves, I Spend"" bounds along in 6/8, with the chorus and sped-up vocals countering Clark's own coo. ""Your Lips Are Red"" mutates from throb to tribal freakout, a croaking, scraping guitar and sinewy lead hinting at the chaos that never quite comes. ""Apocalypse Song"" features a polyrhythmic voice, drum and handclap breakdown that vies with strings and more skronking noise. The war-is-not-over ""Paris is Burning"" is a woozy Weimar-esque waltz filled out by phased effects, a martial groove and sneaking, cynical lines like the Shakespeare allusion ""Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."" Elsewhere Clark slips in a few other memorable lyrics as well. In ""Your Lips Are Red"" she complains, ""Your skin so fair it's not fair."" In the title track, Clark gets off the lasciviously blasphemous come-on ""we'll do what Mary and Joseph did...without the kid."" The slower vibe of the last few tracks isn't as immediate as what came before it, but that doesn't make it any less impressive. ""Landmines"" is like ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" redone as a torch song. ""All the Stars Aligned"" plods along like a pleasant Beatles outtake, at least until Clark's mini-orchestra briefly (and curiously) quotes John Barry's ""James Bond Theme"". ""Human Racing"" begins as a gentle bossa nova before blossoming into a hypnotic pulse for its fade-out. The jazzy final song, ""What Me Worry?"" is as traditional as the disc gets, except for the fact that Clark picked it to end an album that spends most of its previous minutes exploring the unconventional. ""Love is just a bloodmatch to see who endures lash after lash with panache,"" Clark sings, without coming across nearly as precociously as she could have. ""Have I fooled you, dear? The time is coming near when I'll give you my hand and I'll say, 'It's been grand, but...I'm out of here.'"" And then she's gone. Oh, and the final sound you hear before you inevitably press play and listen to the whole beguiling thing again? A triangle. Guess those lessons paid off after all.","Sidewoman to the stars (well, Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree, at least) Annie Clark steps into the spotlight for her St. Vincent debut, with results so inventive and impressive you wonder what took her so long.

Noble Creatures,The Gourds,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b172b1335d7bf169a2a4/1:1/w_160/30873867.jpg,2007-07-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10435-noble-creatures/,Yep Roc,"The Gourds are perhaps best known-- or most notorious-- for their bluegrass cover of Snoop Dogg's ""Gin and Juice"". Still better than Dynamite Hack's ""Boyz-N-The Hood"" or (gulp) Barenaked Ladies' ""Fight the Power"", the cover was a live show stunt, and the Austin-based quintet are lyrically and musically above such hokey novelty. On the other hand, their tenth album, Noble Creatures, shows they're perfectly suited to the more, um, substantial novelty of the buoyant horns on ""How Will You Shine?"" and the tensely thrumming organ on ""Kicks in the Sun""-- two of the album's most inventive and catchiest hooks. Besides, the Gourds have also moved past bluegrass as an endpoint and have begun using it as a base for forays into other sounds and styles. Distinguishing them from one-time peers like the Hackensaw Boys and labelmates Chatham County Line, this new direction, as well as their punky restlessness and ongoing good humor, places them somewhere between the homespun artiness of Lambchop, the down-home exuberance of the Avett Brothers, and the give-'em-what-they-want chops of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Between these three nodes, they cover a lot of territory: the jamband harmonies of ""The Gyroscopic"", the slight country swing of ""Red Letter Day"", the Cajun dance party that is ""Cranky Mulatto"" and ""All in the Pack"", the swamp blues of ""Spivey"". The band contains not one, but two singer-songwriters-- Kevin ""Shinyribs"" Russell and Jimmy Smith-- whose voices have a similar country texture and whose lyrics tend toward smart-aleck non sequiturs. ""Take all the guts of the middle ages/ And the confessions from the glass cages/ Tie it all together on four stages,"" Smith sings on ""A Few Extra Kilos"", then wraps it all up with a Dr. Strangelove quote: ""Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good time with all that in Vegas."" Just when Noble Creatures begins to sound too wry for its own good, the Gourds offset the bouncy cleverness-- which likely plays well to excitable live audiences-- with slower, earnestly mournful songs like ""Last Letter"" and ""Promenade"". The latter is the album's best and most emotionally raw track, with a brutally rueful chorus: ""I traded yer sweetness for my loneliness/ Yer confidence for my own regrets/ Yer simple grace for this disarray."" Even the song's joke sounds knowingly pathetic, a chuckle that turns into a catch in the throat: ""Somehow my losing just comes natural/ Like a Southern democrat."" That they sound best on these soulful numbers proves the Gourds have more than a few tricks up their sleeves. For them, being underestimated just means they can surprise you more.","Tenth album from the Austin quintet best known for a novelty cover of ""Gin and Juice"" finds the band moving past bluegrass as an endpoint and using the genre as a base for forays into other sounds and styles.

Unbeast the Leash,Videohippos,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17b13d197565213a613/1:1/w_160/d297985c.jpg,2007-07-26 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10444-unbeast-the-leash/,Monitor,"Like members of any good scene, the bands in Baltimore's Wham City collective and satellite friends-- Dan Deacon, Ponytail, Lizz King, Lexie Mountain Boys, Santa Dads, Videohippos, to name a few-- approach a similar aesthetic from different angles. Common ground: the exclamation point (everything is invariably rad! or free! or awesome! or something you can yell), indulgence in rebellion and art-school regression (warehouse squalor, communal everything), and, relatedly, a warped sense of nostalgia. This last point, though, is where the bands part ways: Lexie Mountain Boys sound like a playpen getting knocked over, Dan Deacon has encouraged audiences to imagine themselves in the rec rooms of their parents' houses scarfing pizza, and Videohippos-- well, Videohippos took me longer to parse. It wouldn't be fair to call them the scene's melancholics, but let's propose a dichotomy: Dan Deacon makes kiddie overstimulation sound like fun. Relentless, ga-ga fun. Call the doctor! because I'm choking on fun. Videohippos' approach of wrapping simple, melodic pop-punk and Blondie riffs in toylike synths and effects pedals is that feeling's underbelly: numb, slate. Unbeast the Leash is 13 terse theme songs for an eight-hour day of cartoons and video games. And pre-adolescent boredom, lest you forget, is a rigorous bitch. Of course, the effect isn't just to retrieve that queasy, socked-out feeling from childhood, but-- and this is abundantly obvious from drummer Kevin O'Meara's video projections that blare during the band's performances-- to remind you that, yeah, media is still crammed down our throats, Bush Jr.'s smiling face is burned into our eager eyes, America eats its young, civilization is doomed, and so forth. In that sense, Unbeast the Leash is a uniquely sad record, one that reminded me at first of the way New Order made dance music for clubgoers and downcast eyes alike-- at a Videohippos show in mid-July, I was among only a few people dancing, and the dancing was more like swaying. Photographs subsequently revealed Smiths fans quarantined in suburban bedrooms. O'Meara's kit faces away from the audience. He could be replaced by a drum machine (and often plays along with one), but the irony of letting a human do a machine's job is too rich to pass up. Guitarist and vocalist Jim Triplett stands motionless, staring at nothing in particular. He lets would-be rallying cries fizzle into statements of resignation. He swallows his words, and whatever comes out, comes out faint. Unbeast the Leash hits the same emotional note for about 30 minutes, but a) That's part of the point, and b) It's a note that most bands aren't able to hit: the deep comfort of a true bummer. In that sense, they're Baltimore's shoegazers. They turn the garage-party aesthetic into a faded photograph the way My Bloody Valentine suffocated eros with a pillow. It's not that Unbeast the Leash is a triumph on the scale of Loveless by any stretch, but like that album, it sounds at once a part of its scene and completely contrary to it, the warm crash as the sugar wears off.","Band affiliated with Baltimore's Wham City collective uses melodic pop-punk riffs wrapped in toylike synths and effects pedals to express an uncanny melancholy.

Feil Knapp,Bjørn Torske,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18e9d034d5c69bf4a38/1:1/w_160/be28ce00.jpg,2007-07-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10458-feil-knapp/,Smalltown Supersound,"Oslo's Smalltown Supersound recently released a lovely and (so far) overlooked label sampler/mix CD called Sunkissed. In addition to tracks from Pitchfork favorites like Lindstrøm and Serena-Maneesh, the set features two tracks from Bergen, Norway's Bjørn Torske, both of which can be found here on his first full-length album since 2003's Trobbel. Of all the possible names for a compilation on which to find Torske, it'd be hard to think of one better than Sunkissed; though he has range as a producer and works in a fair number of different moods, everything here is crisp, bright, airy, and shot through with light. Torske is obviously in love with dub, and has a fondness for understatement. His music is often danceable and clubby, but there's never a sense of menace and it never seems like a soundtrack to hedonism. Instead, throughout Feil Knapp, Torske seem concerned with spaciness and warmth, and, above all, on creating a subtle but palpable sense of uplift. There's also a consistently engaging and playful sense of musical humor at work. ""Spelunker"" begins with some squeals and blips from a vaguely familiar video game-- 8-bits, maybe not even-- and then uses the sound effects to build a melody for deep, bottom-heavy, but still nimble dub. It's goofy but also terrific fun, as he essentially uses the game noises as high-pitched focus place of, say, Augustus Pablo's melodica. ""Kapteinens Skjegg"" is another dub excursion, but more driven and heavier, its insistent 1-3 upstrokes providing the foundation for all manner of echo and flange-laden percussion fills. Torske's palette retains roots reggae's earthiness while remaining happily unconcerned with any sense of authenticity. When Torske ups the speed, he keeps the dubby bass out front but adds jazzy chords and all manner of organic percussion untethered to the 4/4 grid. The snappy ""Tur I Maskinparken"" almost has a post-rock cast-- like a TNT-era Tortoise remix, say-- the way it blends elements like a quickly tapping drum machine with electric piano vamping. ""Loe Bar"" is much more danceable, as easy on the ears as mellow retail-ready house but far more engaging, incorporating drama with some yearning new wave synth chords and combining a hypnotic bounce with a striking tunefulness. The eight-minute ""God Kveld"", which was also on Sunkissed in abbreviated form, has a Miami-to-Brooklyn electro feel, with a synth melody ready to drive a Jan Hammer instrumental wedded to congas, acidic bass, and loose, rubbery drum percussion with the timbre of hand-claps. The breakdown in the song's middle is wonderfully odd and unpredictable, as Torske (or his digital proxy) seems content to bang on things just for the joy of hearing them make noise. A little while ago we highlighted ""Møljekalas"", the relaxed mid-tempo cut here that is both uncommonly blissful and clear-headed. On days when the sun is bright but the mercury is still reasonable and the humidity remains in check, not a whole lot from this year sounds better. Feil Knapp is a sense an easy record to overlook, since it contains little grit, zero angst, and next to no dark shading. It is, then, the perfect album for a certain kind of mood, a mood one hopes to find oneself in now and then as July turns to August here in the Northern Hemisphere.","Norwegian songwriter and producer's excellent, Smalltown Supersound-issued debut is crisp, bright, airy, and shot through with light.

Fantastic Playroom,New Young Pony Club,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19cc0084474cd0c1e36/1:1/w_160/6e593d1f.jpg,2007-07-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10471-fantastic-playroom/,Modular,"When exactly does a genre graduate from the fickle roller coaster of hibernations and revivals to the permanent pantheon of musical style choices? While some sounds come and go, accumulating new names from the critical taxonomy each time, others become gracefully perennial and stable. Only the most myopic among us can claim that genres like metal or psych or garage-rock actually ever go away, rather than momentarily exit the indie stage for a costume change every couple years. But other sounds are given a Welcome Back party, complete with banner and NME feature, whenever their frequency takes a small uptick. Post-punk is one of these latter characters, celebrated as returning so often it never leaves. Given that it has been being revived for pretty much all of the 00s, it's time to start thinking of it less as a houseguest than as a roommate. One sign of this permanence is when bands start making just plain really good competent examples of the genre that don't herald any kind of resurgence we need to get suitably jacked up for. Fantastic Playroom is one of these albums; though saddled with the latest tagline for 1981 nostalgia, new-rave, New Young Pony Club turn out a record that is meticulous and comfortable in its genre-specific craft, and excellent for it. While the full length's thunder is somewhat dampened by the almost three-year blog/single/EP ramp-up, it's still an impressive collection of single-worthy tracks. We've all heard and become lactose-intolerant to ""Ice Cream"" by now, thanks to Intel, but it's not the only bullet in NYPC's gun: The barb-wire guitar of ""Get Lucky"" and the slot-machine punk-funk of ""The Bomb"" measure up well to the jingle's stature. ""The Get Go"" doesn't sound quite as forceful without Trillville mixed over it (cf. A-Trak's Dirty South Dance) but instead floats and skitters simultaneously. There are enough post-punk touchpoints here to keep the Musical Shoplifting Police busy for hours, right before stamping them as frauds exploiting their audience's history blind spots. But even those who lived it the first time (or, you know, read books about the first time) should be able to hand NYPC credit for getting the sound right. ""Hiding on the Staircase"", irritatingly snide vocals aside, is a further reassurance that the kids keep studying their Remain in Light for an escape hatch out of the old slashing-guitars and hi-hat dead-end, while ""Grey"" feints a hi-NRG ringtone beginning before retreating to the first pages of the Cure discography. Thrill as ""Get Lucky"" morphs from tired old Gang of Four to less-tapped Depeche Mode. Even early Madonna gets a reference whirl on closer ""Tight Fit"", which mimes her post-disco sound. Credit Tahita Bulmer for adding enough personality to keep Fantastic Playroom from being just a meticulous period piece. Though the hard-to-get, disinterested come-ons of ""Ice Cream"" would become unbearably cloying stretched over an entire record, Bulmer shows off a deeper playbook, hopping easily back and forth between dreamy-pop singing and shouted tough-talk on ""The Bomb"" or drifting gently over the last-call of ""The Get Go"". Only toward the end of the album, when Bulmer slips into the fashionably-bored delivery of electroclash on ""Fan"" and ""Talking, Talking"", does she slip up, before making a nice, versatile recovery on the slinky ""Tight Fit"". The danger with Fantastic Playroom is that there's nothing new, or even re-polished here; even the most casual indie fans have become used to the strip-mining of the early 80s and know all the maneuvers. Consider NYPC a revival act, and the reaction is that they're late to the party, settling on the same reference territory as others before them. But if post-punk has finally earned tenure on the genre faculty, digging up some yet-to-be-unearthed obscurity to mime or adding new technology to a 25-year-old sound is less a priority. Fantastic Playroom puts the emphasis on the content, not the trend, and in so doing makes a damn good case for post-punk's matriculation.","Though saddled with the latest tagline for 1981 nostalgia, new-rave, New Young Pony Club turn out a record that is meticulous and comfortable in its genre-specific craft, and excellent for it.

Deadverse Massive Vol. 1: Dälek Rarities 1999-2006,Dälek,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1955e6ef95969322154/1:1/w_160/244bc39e.jpg,2007-07-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10465-deadverse-massive-vol-1-dalek-rarities-1999-2006/,Hydra Head,"Dälek don't do concessions: For the past nine years, the New Jersey duo has done its will alone, label-hopping from tiny local Gern Blandsten to the free-range Ipecac to the predominantly metal Hydra Head with intervening stops at a half-dozen international experimental outlets for collaborations, splits, and remixes. They count Faust, the Last Poets, and Godflesh's Justin Broadrick as partners and pit virulent, unflinching free verse against a production sense mostly indebted to 20th century art music (Robert Ashley, Merzbow, Tony Conrad) and very loud rock (My Bloody Valentine, the Mute usuals). Indeed, the ultimate question for Dälek remains one of audience: Even though we often hear from Will ""MC Dälek"" Brooks that this is hip-hop, who is this the hip-hop of, or for? And on what level(s) should it be approached? Sure, Dälek's standard boom-bap beats are potent head-nodders, and Brooks' lyrics offer social barbs, race repudiations, and a tetanic middle finger to the culture industry. But the stuff drifting above and between the beats is something else entirely, less inner-city streets and more record-store abstraction. Some love the production and hate the rhymes (see Tom Breihan's review of Abandoned Language: ""stodgy old-man battle-rap...not really a rap group...industrial-shoegaze IDM""), while others find the clamor a redundant distraction to Brooks' unguarded lyrical fire. Language's 10-minute titular track, for instance, begins with Brooks leaning on lines like, ""It's easier to start wars than it is to feed kids."" By the six-minute mark, those words wash under violin drones and heavy electronic noise, the beat persevering just beneath. You'll know what ""we"" are meant to get from this, but who is we, exactly? On that level, Dälek's first collection of rarities and remixes, Deadverse Massive, is fascinating. Functionally, it does what it should do, reaching across six years of Dälek's catalogue to place two unreleased cuts alongside material from five out-of-print splits and a remix from Enon's In This City EP. And it points to the vaulted echelon from which Dälek's long been working: Between opening cut ""Megaton"" (a 2001 collaboration with Broadrick's Techno Animal) and the final-third ""Maintain"" (from the 2006 Streets All Amped EP, included in entirety here), Dälek is consistently titan and bold. Deadverse doesn't get chronologically better or worse, more brave or more meek. It just keeps working: Dälek turn a 2002 Kid606 beat into a menace, the music stretched and screeching beneath Brooks' flow. They drench the metropolitan anxiety and naiveté of Enon's ""In This City"" with ounces of Lithium, letting the ugly city sound like it will swallow Toko Yasuda. But Deadverse is a rarified collection, partially answering its subject's prevailing question-- the one of audience-- while posing it anew with 13 pieces that master the Dälek gamut from different angles. Here, the production wing peels away from the rhyming/songmaking controls: The 17-minute instrumental ""Music for ASM"" is a collage-heavy marathon of 1,000 glitches bouncing off corroded long tones. With this separation, it becomes clear that Dälek are testing every limit, exploring every boundary, not taking any answers easily. When the duo's two sides come back together, as on the remarkable ""3:46"", force and impact peak in exponents. ""Here's your fucking three minute pop song,"" Brooks screams at track's end, his voice irate against Oktopus' swarm of harsh noise. Above the track's upheaval, the point of Dälek-- pieces united-- seems clear: At their best, they lock form to function and claw at a cause-- in this case, cheap fucking beats and rhymes. It's not impossible to love one side of Dälek while abhorring the other. In fact, it's too easy. That fault has less to do with two musicians from New Jersey making the music they want to hear than it does with audiences on both sides of the spectrum too queasy to admit that hip-hop and experimental music should question their own borders and see what they can share. Who says a rap group from New Jersey rhyming about American poor buying empty stock in expensive religion can't hand those verses to an electronic pop group from Switzerland called Velma for remixing? And that the same rap group can't take one of that group's pop songs and make it sound as sinister and suggestively unsettling as a man hiding his face beneath the halogen glow of a street lamp in New Jersey at night? Take the inverse of that answer, and Dälek should have the crowd they've long deserved.","The New Jersey duo's first collection of rarities and remixes reaches across six years to place two unreleased cuts alongside material from five out-of-print splits and a remix from Enon's In This City EP.

Introducing Kenge Kenge,Kenge Kenge,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17eb1335d7bf169a2b5/1:1/w_160/ffa2ee61.jpg,2007-07-25 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10446-introducing-kenge-kenge/,World Music Network,"The Kenyan octet Kenge Kenge makes music that sounds thrillingly new, but it's really as old as the hills of Kenya, or at least the people who live in those hills, the Luo. The band's name is a Luo expression that roughly means ""fusion of small, exhilarating instruments,"" and you have to love any language that has a colloquial expression for something like that. This music sounds for all the world as though it's being created at least partially by electronic means, but there's actually not an electric instrument in earshot on the band's debut album (apart from a bit of bass), which finds them plying a style similar to the driving benga sound that's dominated Kenyan pop music since Daniel Owino Misiani's Shirati Jazz band brought it to national prominence in the late 1960s. The twist here, though, is that benga, which developed over a roughly twenty-year period before becoming a mainstream force, is an electric form centered on the guitar. What the members of Kenge Kenge have done is look at benga, which is still a very popular style in East Africa, and subtract many of the foreign elements that influenced its evolution, including Congolese soukous and South African kwela. That means no electric guitars, or even acoustic guitars. Kenge Kenge have brought out the genre's Luo cultural roots by playing it on traditional regional instruments, including an eight-stringed lyre, a ""sound box,"" a small gong called a nyangile, assorted tuned percussion instruments, and a one-stringed fiddle. The driving rhythm of benga, with all four beats of the measure fully accented, is very much here, but the implication is that the pulse is one part of the overall benga sound that was supplied by traditional Kenyan styles. The lyrics, all in Luo, frequently deal with the subject of dancing, but love songs and praise songs (for both people and animals) are also on tap, and ""Piny Agonda"" is social commentary to dance to. If the great African styles-- benga, highlife, soukous, kwela, mbalax, juju, apala, Afrobeat, mbaqanga, local hip-hop subgenres, and others-- have much in common, it's probably the tendency to get people dancing to music that tells a story or comments on a the social condition, a descendant of oral history traditions such as West African griots and Ethiopian azmari. This music follows that tendency. The disc's opener, ""Kenge Kenge"", begins with a modal flute solo before the percussion enters; when the drums do arrive, it's like aliens landing in your Western ears. These drums have extremely distinct pitch and musical tone-- the underlying rhythm of the song is as much a melody as what the fiddle snaking around the vocals plays. The ""sound box,"" as it's credited, produces a piercing tone similar to striking metal with a mallet-- it also calls to mind the amplification of the thumb piano with which DR Congo's Konono No. 1 stormed the world a couple years ago. Lead singer George Achieng sings a series of cascading, fluid phrases over the beat, backed by a constantly repeating, three-part harmony recitation of the title. The beat on ""Anyango Mbeo"" sounds like a slow drum machine program until you listen closely and realize the subtle differences in each percussive sound and the spaciousness of the recording. Audio illusions such as this abound to tease our rock 'n' roll-trained ears. ""Otenga"" is a surging dance track that uses the flute as a rhythm instrument and features an odd horn that resembles a distorted percussion instrument. Western listeners accustomed to deliberate variety and song structures shaped by recording formats and commercial radio airplay concerns may find it somewhat difficult to sit still through the disc's full 70 minutes, but it's important to realize that Kenge Kenge are working with a completely different paradigm. With no verse/chorus structure and a tendency toward hypnotic stasis, this is somehow simultaneously folk music and melodic pop music that functions in much the same way that a lot of club music does: It aims to move you and keep you moving, and wants to tell you a story in the bargain. Whatever its musicological place, it does its job well, returning a popular style to its roots and making something new and fresh in the process.","Kenyan group works in the rhythm-driven benga style but steers the music away from non-native influences, creating hypnotic music designed for dancing that also tells a story.

Time On Earth,Crowded House,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16e5e6ef9596932211a/1:1/w_160/f1b922b1.jpg,2007-07-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10432-time-on-earth/,ATO,"Last spring at Coachella, the reunited Crowded House was given the thankless task of preceding the reunited Rage Against the Machine on the very same stage. Needless to say, reports were mixed as to how well the crowd, swelled by Rage fans staking out an early spot during Crowded House's set, responded to the band's comeback. But despite the antipodean group's intermittent success around the globe, there's never been a clear place for a songwriter like Neil Finn. Finn may lack the hip bona fides that Coachella thrives on, but he easily outclasses most of the competition across the board. When asked on a radio show several years ago to name a songwriter who sounded like the Beatles but didn't simply rip them off, Steve Earle quickly named Finn. Finn has fans in several other perhaps unlikely corners of the pop and rock world as well. His 2001 live album 7 Worlds Collide featured a band comprising Johnny Marr, Lisa Germano, two members of Radiohead, and Eddie Vedder. While Finn's perhaps best known for Crowded House, he's never been the type to coast on the Crowded House name. After all, the first signs of his pop genius came when he joined his big brother Tim in Split Enz at a mere 19 and immediately established himself as a pop wunderkind. Crowded House came next, finding great success first in America before conquering the rest of the world. Cult fame followed, as Crowded House was put on permanent hiatus and Finn's solo career showed him taking several idiosyncratic steps that further burnished his reputation as a pop songwriter par excellence perennially averse to clichés. Reuniting Crowded House, honestly, may be the ultimate cliché, but hey, Finn's always been the sentimental sort. Despite a sometimes contentious relationship with brother Tim in both Split Enz and, briefly, in Crowded House, he has occasionally re-teamed with him in the Enz and as the Finn Brothers, a celebration of their filial bond; despite Neil's solo career in progress, the Finns just did it again in 2004 after their mother died. As for Crowded House, the idea to dust off the name came after the 2005 suicide of founding drummer Paul Hester, who had left the band while touring behind its fourth and (then) final album, 1993's Together Alone. The absence of Hester is in part what makes Time on Earth such an initially dubious reunion. Yes, bassist Nick Seymour is back in the fold, but Hester's by necessity been replaced by a new drummer, Matt Sherrod, a veteran of Beck's band. Filling out the ranks is Mark Hart (a one-time Supertramp hired gun), who had joined Crowded House in time for Together Alone. As usual, it's Finn in control, so Seymour or not, why call it Crowded House at all? Yet just a few tracks into Time on Earth and there's no question how much the disc sounds not like Split Enz, not the Finn Brothers or solo Neil Finn, but, yes, like Crowded House. The economy of Ethan Johns' and Steve Lillywhite's production helps, as do the straightforward arrangements and, most important of all, Finn's most commercial and least quirky set of songs since 1991's Woodface, or even the group's self-titled 1986 debut. The mood is still often melancholic and dark, but the no muss four-piece interplay showcases Finn's gift, as demonstrated by ""Don't Dream It's Over"" on down, for finding optimism on the outskirts of defeat. ""Nobody Wants To"", with its atmospheric guitar and backing vocals, eases the transition from Together Alone, but by the first single ""Don't Stop Now"" the mood has perked. ""She Called Up"" crosses the manic glee of ""Something So Strong"" with a quirky nyah-nyah bridge worthy of prime Madness. Or Spilt Enz, for that matter. The lyrics are essentially Finn's take on making lemonade from lemons: ""The hurt that you have so close,"" he sings, ""is something better now."" ""Even a Child"" bears the unmistakable chiming stamp of Finn buddy (and co-writer) Johnny Marr, back for more, while the album elsewhere allows Finn to retool and reclaim ""Silent House"", his contribution to the Dixie Chicks' albm Taking The Long Way, as a tribute to Hester. As always, Finn's ballads shine, with the piano-led anti-war ""Pour Le Monde"" and the electric-piano and strings waltz ""You Are The One to Make Me Cry"" weepy without being wimpy (even if neither quite holds a candle to the hypnotic and graceful ""Gentle Hum"" from the last Finn Brothers disc). Then again, the perfectly named ""A Sigh"" sounds like just that, a gorgeous daydream of a song. All is not perfect. Like Woodface, at nearly an hour long and weighed down by a few too many mid-tempo tracks, Time on Earth gets a little out of the band's control. ""Transit Lounge"" features a distracting turn from singer Beth Rowley, while the nostalgic Old Country tribute ""English Trees"" probably would have worked better with brother Tim. These are minor quibbles, though, as Finn's forte has always been as a songwriter first and foremost, not a pretentious album-length crafter of grand cohesive statements or conveyor of didactic meaning. He writes deeply personal pop songs with oblique lyrics and deceptively tricky melodies, but no matter who (or what) Finn is mourning, he leaves it up to the listener to make it all fit. As easy as it may be for some to dismiss Crowded House as easy listening, it's the band's open-ended quality, its dedication to both bare emotion and ambiguity, that in some ways make it the most difficult kind of listen of all.","Australian band returns after a 14-year hiatus, picking up where it left off, buoyed as usual by Neil Finn's brilliant and beautiful songwriting.

Super Taranta!,Gogol Bordello,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1889d034d5c69bf4a2c/1:1/w_160/f2e6bdbf.jpg,2007-07-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10454-super-taranta/,SideOneDummy,"One look at the etymology of the word ""gypsy"" and it becomes immediately clear why the Romani people, their descendants and distant cousins, often find the generalized term so distasteful, if not outright derogatory. The word ""gypsy"" stems from a mistaken early belief that the Roma came from Egypt, and was long invoked as a pejorative to impugn their trustworthiness. Relatively recently, historians have more accurately traced Roma roots back to India, but they somehow wound up dispersed throughout the Middle East, what used to be the Soviet Union, Africa, the Americas and, of course, Europe and the Balkans. New York is the ultimate mixing pot and one of the few places on earth where you'll find people from all of those disparate places. New York is also, in essence, a city of gypsies, packed with people at once proud of their roots and their rootlessness. Gogol Bordello leader Eugene Hutz hails from the Ukraine, but from his brash appropriation of the word ""gypsy"" to the way his band (composed of a polyglot crew of diverse origins) incorporates just about every style of music that fits in the busy mix, he's a New Yorker to the core. Traditional Roma music draws from countless strains of folk. Gogol Bordello tosses in punk guitars and tempos, reggae, dance music, and whatever else strikes their fancy. It's the sound of the world, the West via the East, and from Beirut to Balkan Beat Box and even Basement Jaxx, it's become a full-on trend. Yet you know a trend has not just fully arrived but may actually be on the wane when Madonna finally co-opts it. Indeed, seeing members of self-proclaimed ""gypsy punks"" Gogol Bordello on stage with the Material Matron during the naval gazing Live Earth festival hints that Eastern European folk-influenced rock acts may have reached maximum visibility. Really, how much accordion, horn, and fiddle kitsch can we take? Apparently a lot, especially if done right. The gypsy-rock subgenre has thrived for decades. Wedding Present guitarist Peter Solowka did it with the frantic John Peel faves the Ukrainians. Camper Van Beethoven did it, and those Santa Cruz goofballs cited 1960s worldly psychedelic folk antecedents Kaleidoscope as one of their key inspirations. Maybe, rather than fade, the field will never shrink and only continue to grow, as more and more residents of the diffuse global village identify themselves-- both literally and figuratively-- as gypsy. But as the novelty of bands like Gogol Bordello wears off, its music, ironically enough, begins to sound more and more like a novelty. While I was playing the group's new album Super Taranta! my mother-in-law walked into the room and asked me if I was listening to Weird Al. I shrugged off the query, but she had a point. Gogol Bordello is an exceedingly silly band, and even if it's not laugh-out-loud ha ha funny, there's more than a little ridiculousness to its self-consciously eclectic kitchen-sink approach. Sure, the band knows how to entertain-- its breathless, breakneck live sets are the stuff of legend. But unlike the rough and ready Steve Albini-helmed Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike, Super Taranta! adds little to the group's musical vocabulary-- to be fair, perhaps an impossibility. When you start out with everything and anything, where do you go next? The closest relative to the group is the oft-cited Pogues, but the Pogues-- with their marriage of the traditional and the iconoclastic-- pulled off the trick with poetry and craft. Gogol Bordello, on the other hand, is more crass, all about the superficial rush, but without much going on beneath the surface; consequently, the rush grows exhausting. The music is spirited, but lacks soul, and after you've heard the insane three and a half minutes of the first track ""Ultimate"", you pretty much get the point. That's not to dismiss the pleasures of ""Harem in Tuscany (Taranta)"", the party crashing thrash of ""American Wedding"", or the adenoidal reggae of ""Tribal Connection"". But just as you can't listen to a light show, music this theatrical demands a stage. On disc it plays a bit like a conversation-starting party favor: colorful and bright, but no substitute for actually being there.","Self-proclaimed ""gypsy punks"" offer another disc of eclectic, breakneck rock that's as exhausting to listen to as it must be to play.

War Stories,UNKLE,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1935e6ef9596932214e/1:1/w_160/d7f323e2.jpg,2007-07-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10463-war-stories/,Surrender All,"With its sci-fi artwork and intergalactic bent, James Lavelle's UNKLE project has always hinted at a nebulous future realm. After all, UNKLE's DJ Shadow-assisted 1998 debut was dubbed Psyence Fiction and the first words heard on the record are ""somewhere in space, this may all be happening right now""-- a sample taken from the original Star Wars trailer. Lavelle's splintered media persona-- part clothing designer, part musician, part DJ, part label owner, part graphic designer-- lived up to this voyager ideal as well. And, with his penchant for throwing hip-hop, rock, dance and movie music into a zero gravity blender, Lavelle's intention seemed clear: Along with poorly-drawn, conehead-like aliens, the future will be marked by an über-genre mish-mash soundtrack. It's a nice idea. Psyence Fiction* was an inconsistent affair, but even its failures were intriguing for either their flourishing pomp or overreaching ambition. Plus, how many albums do you know that feature original vocals from both Kool G Rap and Thom Yorke? With producer Richard File replacing Shadow as Lavelle's sonic point-man, 2004's Never, Never Land traded-in hip-hop rhythms for dance beats, but the LP lacked A-list talent and largely went unheard (no big loss there). And, by the time of Never Land's release, the explosion of internet mash-ups and the proliferation of cross-genre mixers like Diplo and 2 Many DJs were threatening to put Lavelle and his home-grown UNKLE mix-ups out to pasture. Skip ahead to the present and artists like Girl Talk and the Ed Banger crew are mastering Lavelle's one-time sonic utopia, cut and paste style. What's an intrepid dilettante with a brand new label and clothing line to do? Give up and start looking to the past, apparently. War Stories* is the most unadventurous, most typically rock UNKLE release to date. With drums turned down and layers upon layers of fuzzy guitars and nonsensical hippie-isms turned up, it comes off like a castrated version of Primal Scream's searing XTRMNTR. Much of the new direction can be attributed to the addition of desert rock mastermind Chris Goss (Queens of the Stone Age, Masters of Reality), who helped out on production this time around. While Goss is undoubtedly a maverick when it comes to sunstroke sludge rock, his blurry style brings out Lavelle's lack of focus, resulting in several five-minute-plus mystical marathons that ride one mediocre riff all the way to glam-stomp oblivion. As for the guest list, either Lavelle misplaced a lot of phone numbers over the last decade or he's getting used to hearing ""no"" more often. Queens leader Josh Homme is joined by increasingly ancient Cult singer (and sometime Jim Morrison stand-in) Ian Astbury and Massive Attack's 3D. Elsewhere, second (third?) tier British garage rockers Duke Spirit, whiny folkie Gavin Clark, and producer File pop-up, too. It's even gotten to the point where Lavelle himself gets on the mic and does his best blank shoegazer on two tracks. Somewhere, Thom Yorke is not listening to War Stories. The album's few salvageable moments are also the most rhythmic. ""Burn My Shadow"", with its pinpoint, stop-start snares and Astbury's wilting croon is close to harrowing and, like ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"" and ""Eye for an Eye"" before it, the song's exceptional video gives its new-age lyrics some much needed context. The Homme-sung ""Restless"" is an industrial-funk high that takes advantage of the singer's lofty falsetto...even if it's nearly over by the time it fully kicks in. Hazy L.A. rockers Autolux's ""Persons & Machinery"" drags its ticky-tack metronome beat out about two minutes too long, but the song's central lyric-- a mix of apathy and anger aimed at Blair-Bush-- is one of the few that lives up to the album's provocative title: ""Please just follow your great plan through/ We've had it with you."" Elsewhere, moody epics ""Twilight"" and ""Price You Pay"" are so ethereal they quickly evaporate into nothing. The string-laden chug-a-lug scuzz rockers aren't worth mentioning by name. So, after trying to move things forward for so long-- first with his Mo' Wax label and then with UNKLE's early incarnations-- James Lavelle takes it back to a Britpop B-side wasteland filled with has-beens and never-will-be's. Such willful nostalgia doesn't do him many favors. While Lavelle's previous work can still be looked upon as visionary, his latest is anything but. Even with its repeatable tracks sounding instantly dated, War Stories marks the official end of this one-time progressive's soothsaying days.","James Lavelle offers his most traditional, rock-oriented release yet, collaborating here with Palm Desert sonic mastermimd Chris Goss.

What Is Free to a Good Home? EP,Emily Haines & the Soft Skeleton,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1859d034d5c69bf4a26/1:1/w_160/97736c98.jpg,2007-07-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10452-what-is-free-to-a-good-home-ep/,Last Gang,"Turns out the predecessor to the new EP from Emily Haines and her assembled band the Soft Skeleton was one of the more overlooked records of last year. With hindsight, Knives Don't Have Your Back was a comparatively grown-up whisper in the company of Haines' louder, more slickly aggressive work as the frontwoman of Metric. In this scenario, it was easy to superficially dismiss Knives at face value: A one-off vanity project from an artist very familiar with collaboration. Yet that appraisal couldn't be further from the truth; both Knives, as well as its five-song followup What Is Free to a Good Home?, are wonderfully singular works themselves, quite possibly representative of Haines' primary musical strength all along. Like much of the music from the Broken Social Scene cooperative, Home is forged with a muted eccentricity, rendering Haines' soft piano/voice jazz compositions woozy enough to complement the exhaustion in her voice. For example, the sighing brass that opens ""Rowboat"" and accompanies ""Telethon"" doesn't feel too far removed from the 3 a.m. trip-hop behind the remixed version of ""Mostly Waving"" that closes the record. Lyrically, Home is as lonesome as Knives, yet the songs here are tuned to the specific type of weary solitude that gradually coalesces after successive nights of public socializing. In the song that takes its name from her unfortunate afterhours destination, she bemoans to a clique, ""you left me in a bar at the bottom of the world,"" and on ""Telethon"", she's reached the point at which ""daylight's like fluorescent light."" She's both worn and reaching out, but in a language leftover from last night's jukebox, or perhaps a late-night VH1 Classic binge. ""Telethon"" finds her in a ""bruised, Billy Joel New York State of Mind,"" and on ""The Bank"", she asks, ""Just like Huey Lewis, I need a new drug...that does what it should."" Home's spirit isn't strictly devoted to pop-culture coated ruminations, however. Those with keen visual memories and/or an interest in the Canadian avant-garde might notice a similarity between its cover art (and Knives') and that of the 1971 record Escalator Over the Hill, a collaboration between pianist/composer Carla Bley and poet Paul Haines, Emily's late father. His 2003 passing cast a pall over much of Knives, and this EP's release coincides with that of his first poetry compilation, Secret Carnival Workers. Of Home, Haines admitted in in a May interview with Pitchfork's Matthew Solarski, ""It's kind of like the final installment of my homage to my freaky, avant upbringing."" The record shares its title with a poem Paul wrote for the guitarist Robert Wyatt (who wrote the liner notes for Knives), and also features a light-headed treatment of his poem ""Sprig"". Especially when considering the heavy-lidded sentiment preceding it, Emily singing Paul's line ""falling asleep for the fifth time early in the morning,"" is much too appropriate to be anything but familial.","This five-song follow-up to last year's overlooked Knives Don't Have Your Back is a wonderfully singular work that proves the Metric leader and Broken Social Scene member can flourish outside of the constraints of collaboration.

Lion the Girl,Midnight Movies,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17d13d197565213a615/1:1/w_160/0d09f068.jpg,2007-07-24 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10445-lion-the-girl/,New Line,"Reminiscent of the disheveled, gravelly properties of Electrelane, L.A.-based Midnight Movies' second album converges the vitreous vocals of singer Gena Olivier with the boat rudder effects of the band's instrumentation: grumbling organ, guitar, bass, and dutiful drums. These murky 11 tracks, produced by Steve Fisk of Soundgarden and Nirvana fame, mingle the listless, ruminative qualities of punk with, dare I say, a woman's touch. Bolstered by original guitarist Larry Schemel and the recent additions of bassist Ryan Wood and drummer Sandra Vu, Olivier's clear, often reverberated vocals are the sweet voice of reason behind the instruments' punch and the guitars' acerbic blows. On ""Hide Away"" her refrain, ""I will find you,"" is as flatly delivered and monotonous as any number of post-punk vocalists, yet it's still awfully effective and charming. ""Ribbons"", which follows, is a glittery, girly affair dressed in the moping heartache of the Cure, or better yet, a 1950s prom sendoff, full of plush, waltzing percussion, and a wide range of soulful, strong vocal notes. Here Olivier flirts with Becky Stark's impressive soprano work. But with her backup pumping out a weak pulse in the heavily echoed background, the effect is subtler and wins us over with the warm organ and bow-out lyric, ""You're all I want to know."" The song, in the end, has more feeling than a mirrorball'd high school gym, the last line bearing the weight of experience. Even if we leave aside imaginative, other-worldly titles like ""Coral Den"", ""Ribbons"", and ""Bell Tower,"" the Movies, here and there, show glimmers of the fleeting, ghostly structures of Beach House's 2006 debut. ""Bell Tower"" is the hung over, washed out, pretty vitriol to ""Coral Den""'s boisterous acceleration. ""Den"" only differs from the pervasive guitar monologues found on Electrelane's latest because it contains more lyrics, and while the Movies' little vertiginous cameos can hold sway on their own, this band is considerably more dependent on its lead singer. And what a minor key can do to suggest lyrical profundity that may not actually be there: ""Parallel Paramour"" possesses many of the decorations this album wants to show off: fingers-on-chalkboard acid guitar solos, undulating or piercing organ, and a slew of dark melodic moments that drag us into a damp fog of emotion, if only we could hear its verbal meaning. But on the punchy Doors throwback ""24 Hour Dream"" it suffices to nod in slow-mo head-bang to the heaving rainstorm of a chorus, a downtrodden yet ardent sticky-note about the end of time, or so the musical notes suggest. Creeping keyboards and wobbly effects pedals keep up the pleasant Zombies vibes through to the end, but never abandoning rock. ""Dawn"" may be an entire intro-- an ice-cream truck song remixed for the soundtrack of Blue Velvet, perhaps-- but ""Two Years"" insists on the oddly triumphant heft of sheer noise, both the sunny, shortlived intro and energetic chorus making a piece that goes from strength to strength, historical chapter to chapter.","L.A. band's second release adds a new drummer, bassist, and producer Steve Fisk to the decks for an effects-heavy, gauzy torrent of psych rock and punk remnants.

Moonlight Farm,Jakob Olausson,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17fc0084474cd0c1e11/1:1/w_160/17b1fa7c.jpg,2007-07-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10447-moonlight-farm/,De Stijl,"When De Stijl first released Jakob Olausson's debut, Moonlight Farm, on vinyl in 2006, it sent a serious ripple of astonishment throughout the folk underground. Olausson, a sugar beet farmer from Landskrona, Sweden, appeared to be particularly well situated to craft the sort of insular, deeply personalized outsider statement that has proven increasingly elusive in recent years. And true to its promise, Moonlight Farm beautifully evokes the best of the acid-folk private press, yet still manages to set itself apart with the deceptive elegance of its design. Now issued on CD for the first time, the album has lost nothing of its disquieting allure, as Olausson's deliberate, unhurried performances and gnomic songs serve to ensnare the listener again and again. On repeated listens, of course, it becomes clear that the music on Moonlight Farm is considerably less hermetic than it might initially appear. Though the album owes little to any easily tagged folk traditions, there are hints that Olausson has a comfortable working knowledge of his international loner-folk ancestry. With its hazy, swirling atmospherics and dim fidelity, Moonlight Farm at once conjures the afterimages of such self-documenting pioneers as Jandek or Skip Spence, as well as the work of 4-track luminaries ranging from Scotland's Richard Youngs to New Zealand's Graeme Jefferies. Though Olausson's homespun arrangements are filled with surprising touches-- a flourish of sitar, a momentary burst of flute-- they're all treated with such an organic, understated character that it often takes several listens for their presence to even register. Unlike such troubled figures as Spence, however, Olausson here sounds clear-eyed and direct beneath his surface mysticism, cautioning ""Don't hide your head in the sand/ for God's sake, don't run away to Neverland"" at one point on ""Silhouette V"". Yet thanks largely to his decision to double-track all his vocals, even relatively straightforward tracks like ""Welcome Traveler"" are delivered with a disorienting wobble, while the bent notes of the brief instrumental ""The Wind Combs Her Hair"" can sound almost South Asian in origin, as though they've strayed from some as yet uncompiled Sublime Frequencies collection. On such pieces as ""Napalm Sky"" or ""Live to Tell"", Olausson shows an admirable willingness to lapse into atonality and dissonance, but without ever fully abandoning the song's essential melodic aims. In contrast, tracks like the irresistible, violin-traced opener ""What Will Tomorrow Bring"" or the intimate ""Listen Sister"" are wholly hummable, and the electric guitar lead on ""At the Citadel"" sounds like it could soon to carry him into a far more conventional, rock-centric climate. As is often the case with such hushed bedroom broadcasts, Moonlight Farm leaves the listener with the tantalizing question of what might happen if Olausson were to ever find his way into a proper studio, ready to attack his song-based material with an adventurous group of musicians behind him. For the moment, he seems perfectly willing to let us wonder. His more recent projects have found him moving outward in several directions simultaneously, exploring homespun free jazz in his duo Sus & Jakob and heavier space rock with his group Renegade Scanners. The wayfaring nature of these outside projects only serves to reinforce the idea of Moonlight Farm as an especially happy accident, the brilliant labor of an enlightened mind captured at precisely the right place and in the right time.","This record-- created by a sugar beet farmer from Landskrona, Sweden and originally issued on vinyl last year-- beautifully evokes the best of the acid-folk private press.

Fancy Footwork,Chromeo,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16dea9e61561daa6793/1:1/w_160/f2ad7532.jpg,2007-07-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10431-fancy-footwork/,Vice,"Chromeo's Dave 1 keeps his cool, even in the middle of a domestic scrap. ""Let's keep the screaming and the fighting and the crying to a minimum,"" he says on ""My Girl is Calling Me (A Liar)"", ""and if the kitchen don't work we can fight in the living room,"" biting off that last syllable sharply enough to force the rhyme. Before the household battles, presumably, comes the pick-up, and he's good at that too: ""Let me tell you that I saw your boyfriend, walking down the street,"" goes ""Bonafied Lovin' (Tough Guys)"". ""He was standing all shaky, hands all sweaty, and he could hardly speak/ I might as well take a minute or two to put you on to some game: You got a boy like him, a man like me, and that's just not the same."" Best friends Dave 1 (aka David Macklovitch, A-Trak's older brother) and P-Thugg, who give one another common sense advice as part of their tracks, don't self-edit much. ""Just take her to movies and you're bound to work it out,"" interjects P-Thugg, via telephone, on ""My Girl Is Calling Me"". The band's self-consciously limited palette-- an electrofunk-by-numbers mélange of talk boxes, 808s, canned percussion, and Prince-style atmospherics-- is just another manifestation of their inability to tell a lie. If a song's called ""Fancy Footwork"", it's going to be about fancy footwork. Cocksmen they may be, but it's a thing they've got to talk themselves into. Faux-ballad ""Momma's Boy"" is a mashed-out keyboard confessional about a romance between a girl in love with her dad and a boy equally in love with his mom. A novelty song with a happy ending, the two of them figure something out: The girl looks like his mom, and he looks like her dad, so they're all set. On the 1980s throwback ""Opening Up (Ce Soir On Danse)"", Macklovitch is in the middle of baring his soul to a new girlfriend when he loses her number. He's got to ask her, ""Tell me what numbers to dial, 'cause I've been strung out for a while."" Going over the top here is just part of the package. The skin flick sax on ""100%"", the ripping, non sequitur guitar solo on ""Momma's Boy"", the straight ""1999""-rip that is ""Outta Sight"": These are the consequences of getting in the mood. Better that than the cynical grab at pop star detachment that is ""Tenderoni"", Fancy Footwork's first single and far and away worst song. Built around a bad bit of slang that fell out of favor years ago, Macklovitch utters platitudes like ""You and I/ Baby we go side by side"" before rapping about getting in those pants over some slap bass. All you need to save songs like these is to not blink in the face of the irony, the shtick, whatever-- just don't break the frame, right? More lovable is their ""Intro"", where over some tinnily epic synths the two Chromeos get a girl to chant their name, over and over, the three syllables ascending like stadium entrance music. This is surely what they come out to when they play live. And though it may hype a crowd it's obvious it's there for them too. Nerdy guys in sunglasses, they've got to convince themselves of their cool before they go to work on us.","Follow-up to 2004's She's in Control again finds the electro-pop duo successfully mining the 80s for inspiration, incorporating talk boxes, 808s, canned percussion, and Prince-style atmospherics.

Emerald City,John Vanderslice,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b18f9d034d5c69bf4a3b/1:1/w_160/0297c766.jpg,2007-07-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10459-emerald-city/,Barsuk,"After a two-year wait, John Vanderslice follows 2005's Pixel Revolt, an album waist-deep in post-9/11 dread and despair, with 2007's Emerald City, an album waist-deep in post-9/11 dread and despair. If the previous sentence makes the new album sound like it's a carbon copy of its predecessor, then you see what I'm getting at. Vanderslice reportedly wrote most of the album while trying to resolve some visa issues concerning his French girlfriend entering the U.S. The album's concluding track, ""Central Booking"", is the one song that directly addresses this issue, though its concluding thesis-- ""looks like September won once again""-- hangs over the entire album. As with Pixel Revolt, nearly half of the tracks make mention of, or allude to, the World Trade Center attacks, while the rest of the songs are awash in the debris and carnage from the tragedy and its aftermath. Even the album's title is a pointed reference, the ""Emerald City"" being a derogatory nickname for the ""Green Zone"" in downtown Baghdad. However, while Vanderslice's observations and commentary sounded fresh and fierce two years ago, the same essential message run through similarly sounding songs this time around rings hollow. Musically, Vanderslice is on top of his game, deftly walking the line between tasteful and ostentatious, but even his skill in this regard can't soften the heavy-handed rhetoric. The queasy acoustic guitars on ""Kookaburra"" lend the song (which details the apocalyptic power of ""lightning shot from the sky"", a recurring theme) an unsettling air, while the lilting piano figure of ""The Parade"" sets a happy scene for what turns out to be another ironically bittersweet paean to the collapse of the towers (never mind an awful case of synthesizer flatulence in the bridge). Throughout the album, Vanderslice chooses to use amplified acoustic guitars, similar to what you'd hear on Spoon albums. They lend the more aggressive tracks (like ""Time to Go"" and ""White Dove"") a percussive propulsion, but these gains are undercut by the lyrics' lack of oomph. In the past, Vanderslice could infuse both his fictional and non-fictional songs with a convincing emotional heft. This time around, he's as eloquent as he's ever been, refining and strengthening his short-story songwriting style. However, the constant referral to ""lighting from the sky"" and towers and drones flying by becomes as cloying and ineffective as the multiple references to 9/11 utilized by political hopefuls and pundits. Only on the album's concluding track does Vanderslice snap out of his insightful ennui and involve the listeners in what he's saying. The brief verses of ""Central Booking"" concerning the plight of his girlfriend and him being separated by distance and bureaucratic red tape ring truer than the purporetedly heady rush of imagery concerning a woman's dead daughter (""White Dove"") or a Cindy Sheehan-esque war protester (""Tablespoon of Codeine""). The worst offender is ""Time to Go"", the portentous story of a wagon-train trying desperately to cross the country (""Burn the wagon wheels for heat""). Even on a short-and-sweet track like ""Numbered Lithograph""-- a song that sounds an awful lot like something his last album's co-conspirator, the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, would put to tape-- there's something missing. The idiosyncratic references that would ground the lyric sound forced, and the more immediate details (""Your cellphone shuddered and blinked/ It was your boyfriend again"") don't resonate. Maybe the album falls short because of what Vanderslice claims at the end of ""The Minaret"": ""I can see both sides, and it paralyzed me.""","As with its predecessor, 2005's Pixel Revolt, nearly half of the tracks on this new John Vanderslice album make mention of, or allude to, the World Trade Center attacks, while the rest of the songs are awash in the debris and carnage from the tragedy and its aftermath.

Is Is EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b186ea9e61561daa67b5/1:1/w_160/7101376b.jpg,2007-07-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10453-is-is-ep/,FictionDress Up,"Karen O has a curious range. She possesses a low, clear, expressive voice that communicates tender-hearted vulnerability easily and evocatively. But she also effortlessly reaches upper registers of grotesquerie, brazenly barking and blasting wordless sounds at her audience. It's easy to take this range for granted or simply to disregard it as another element in O's high-fashion stage show, but it's a critical factor of her performance and identity. One style is tender and pretty, the other ugly and visceral. They're often considered the flipsides of the same complicated woman, but more likely they arise from the same confessional impulse: On ""Maps"", ""Cheated Hearts"", and ""Turn Into"" (the best songs she's written), she exposes her fears, needs, and insecurities in a straightforward and fairly conventional way, but on ""Black Tongue"", ""Art Star"", and ""Tick"", she turns herself inside out for her audience, showing her bones as well as her blood, guts, and organs. O tends towards the latter-- in concentrated form-- on Is Is, an EP collecting newly recorded songs written in 2004 between their 2003 debut Fever to Tell and their 2006 follow-up, Show Your Bones. With its martial beat and start-stop momentum, opener ""Rockers to Swallow"" is full of empty, threatening spaces, which O half-fills with barked commands that sound alternately like Ozzy on ""Crazy Train"" and a maniacal drill sergeant. Nick Zinner and Brian Chase-- who have just as much range as their bandmate-- sound like they're playing against each other. It's a shoot-out, with the audience caught in the crossfire. In fact, there's barely a song there. ""Rockers to Swallow"" is all performance. This is what they do best. Their self-titled debut and the follow-up Fever to Tell sounded like the band had cobbled the songs together from frayed scraps found in skuzzy alleyways, bars, dives, cheap walk-ups, and vacant lots-- in other words, from real experiences in New York-- which made them a compelling alternative to their club-bound peers. In contrast to Fever, Show Your Bones felt written, as if O deliberately sat down to put her feelings onto paper and the band booked studio time to turn those scribblings into songs. Produced by Australian Nick Launay (who recorded Gang of Four, Killing Joke, and Public Image Ltd), Is Is stands somewhere between the two albums: It never feels as fully lived-in as Fever, but sounds looser and more off-the-cuff than Bones. Like ""Rockers to Swallow"", the title track is an elaboration of grunts and riffs, with O growling to the rafters in other buildings and Zinner's aggressive guitar spiraling psychedelically around Chase's high-hat-riding beat. But the remaining three tracks are songs in a more traditional sense-- and good ones at that. ""Kiss Kiss"" achieves a throbbing forward motion, with Zinner's guitar churning a bass riff that propels O's tense, terse vocal melodies and sexually conflicted lyrics. Even when she's singing, she still punctuates her words with an arsenal of onomatopoeia: the girlish ah-ahs on ""10x10"" contrasting the wounded, nearly spoken intro; the yowls that precede the chorus on ""Down Boy""; the throat-scraping growl on the title track. Each aspect of her stage identity finds equal expression on these songs, which only makes them sound more immediate and affecting. In fact, Is Is may be their most instantly accessible release, which is not a critical dig but just a way of saying it finds a good balance between alienating and inviting, between song and performance. This dynamic could sustain an entire album, but the EP's brevity is the key to its appeal: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs know enough to leave you wanting more.","This EP collects newly recorded songs written in 2004 between the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' 2003 debut Fever to Tell and their 2006 follow-up, Show Your Bones, and as such is more reminiscent of the raw danger of the group's debut than its patient follow-up.

New Wave,Against Me!,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17a9d034d5c69bf4a15/1:1/w_160/144f9797.jpg,2007-07-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10443-new-wave/,Sire,"Against Me!'s Reinventing Axl Rose sounded a bit like the Clash or Billy Bragg on the first take-- hardly polished, ragged, and throaty. AM! filtered folk, country, and reggae through the veneer of anthemic punk rock; with no rhythm section to speak of, their songs shot forward on the rough engine of Tom Gabel's voice and the headlong disorder of the band's ragtag instrumentation. They sounded, basically, like glorified spoken word pieces, set to a tune. The band's refusal to do anything resembling a second take hit a kind of DIY nerve so precisely that within a few months of the record's emergence, it was on its way to becoming No Idea's all-time best-selling release. This was in 2002. Within a year there were hundreds of bands that sounded like them (check the excellent Plan-It-X label) and skeptics gritted their teeth, recognized a trend when they saw one, and waited for things to pass. Among these skeptics, it turned out, was the band itself. Against Me! saw the end long before most of their fans did-- it didn't help that their most popular song, ""Baby, I'm an Anarchist!"", was exactly the novelty it appears to be-- and this fact might explain how they ended up, five years later, on a major label, with Butch Vig at the controls, and seeking their third or fourth or tenth new audience in as many years. For a bunch of self-professed anarchists and DIY devotees, the jump to pop-punk haven and Warped Tour affiliate Fat Wreck Chords only a year after they'd talked thousands of kids into believing what they ostensibly did was about as a jarring and contradictory as it sounds. Two records later, they finished the job of demolishing their own fans' newly learned anti-capitalist ethic by signing to Sire, after making an MTV video and a documentary about how extremely they were courted by besuited guys with way more money to burn than Fat Mike. In a post indie-rock world where the Decemberists and Death Cab for Cutie and even Mastodon were cheered for making the major label leap, Against Me! became the first band of the 21st Century to actually succeed at selling out. ""We can control the medium"" are the first words you hear listening to New Wave: ""We can control the context of presentation."" Fan expectations aside, Against Me! built their sound in reaction to big-chorus guitar-rock, and this track, ""New Wave"", is almost exactly that: big jangly chorus, vague topicality (""Come on and wash these shores away!""), vocal overdubs by the scores. ""No signs of original thought in the mainstream,"" sings Gabel, and the anxiety is palpable. It's also, as far as these things go, an immaculately stirring song, a sing-a-long on the first pass kind of confection. This is comfortable territory on the Warped Tour axis, Against Me!'s adopted home. ""Trash Unreal"" is a Rancid-esque ode about a girl who gets mixed up with the wrong drugs and the wrong guys and the wrong crowd, dances to ""Rebel Yell,"" ages out of the scene, and wakes up a thirty-something junkie. ""Americans Abroad"" is an anti- cultural imperialism anthem. Tegan of Tegan and Sara guests on ""Borne on the FM Waves of the Heart"", an emo duet. ""White People for Peace"" concerns the desire of white people for peace; it's also the first single, and with its ""protest songs"" refrain you'd have to be a pretty lousy guy not to like it. These are longstanding punk tropes boiled down and Vig-ed up, removed of their typical dirt sheen and bolstered by a couple extra guitar tracks. Of course, the need to say something is a double-edged sword at this level, where Gabel's tasked with ways of making his standard stiff and excessive syllables-- ""East and West could not agree, so their Generals gave call and gathered troops at the border""-- sound like something you'd buy a ticket to see. Earnest self-importance of the Bad Religion school rear-ends latter day Green Day we-are-the-worlditude, and the next thing you know you're shouting ""civilian casualties had been a cost that was predetermined/when interviewed for report victims pleaded in frustration"" and wondering what the hell happened. For one thing, who even knows to whom this band is speaking anymore? ""Up the Cuts"", an agonized look at the failing record industry, is a song nobody thought Against Me! would write. ""All the insiders rumor over the decline in sales, all the buzz is happening in the new digital marketplace"" Gabel sings, or tries to anyway, and one feels for him. ""In MRR, someone asks the question...is the culture now a product that's disposable?"" Gabel asks, and on the lyric sheet, though not in the song, ""MRR"" is followed by a parenthesis: (Maximum Rock and Roll). Against Me! have come a long way indeed, when they need to explain to their audience what they mean by that acronym. And where they've arrived at, even they don't know. As Gabel sings, finishing the track: ""All the punks still singing the same song, is there anybody thinking what I am? Is there any other alternative? Are you restless like me?""","Self-professed anarchists and DIY devotees jump to a major label with this Butch Vig-produced record.

Atomic Yggdrasil Tarot,"Daniel ""A.I.U."" Higgs",by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17913d197565213a60f/1:1/w_160/185c30eb.jpg,2007-07-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10442-atomic-yggdrasil-tarot/,Thrill Jockey,"The explosion that marks the opening of ""Luminous Carcass Ornament"", the excellently gnarled first track on Daniel Higgs' Atomic Yggdrasil Tarot, is, even straight-to-cassette, one of the biggest cacophonies captured on record this year. The legendary, bountifully bearded Lungfish leader's swift follow-up to last year's Ancestral Songs continues the earlier's outer-space crunk transmissions (see, especially, the earlier ""Are You of the Body"" and ""Time-Ship of the Demogorgon""), but on these ""psychic loops of praise,"" his ambled, chanting vocal raga's passed over for pure instrumentalism. The six pieces are lo-fi stretches of piano drone (fingers, mallets, etc.) and banjos/guitars loaded with swift Eastern/Sun City scales, zoning static, eschatological subtexts, and spectral/emotional ambiance. Despite the absence of a sustained human voice or Ancestral Songs' apocalyptic incantations, bird chirps, incidental hums, and the hints of a bigger outdoors flesh-out Higgs' playing. Hell, 2005's jaw harp extravaganza Magic Alphabet was plenty full with even fewer puzzle pieces. Here ""Hems and Seams"" crams submerged jaw harp twang and simple, sharp, rat-a-tat percussion into a streaming haze; the opening mist of ""Cocoon on the Cross"" parts for a plaintive 11-minute guitar solo that sprouts craggy branches and speedy tributaries; ""Spectral Hues"" slips between whirring piano cuts, rapid taps, sustain, and Higgs' exhalations; the title track and sweltering ""Creation Moan"" birth sitars from raging, overloaded guitars. Higgs only opens his mouth to breath, but Atomic Yggdrasil isn't without lyrics. As any proper druid with Wikipedia knows, in Norse mythology, Yggdrasil, aka the World Tree, connects the nine cosmological worlds. Fittingly, Higgs connects half a dozen songs to a gorgeous 48-page hardcover book depicting a series of his totemic paintings and acrostics-- which delineate themes he's intoned about in the past-- including a climactic centerfold with two facing emblems after which the order of art/word shifts. After 20 years in Lungfish (plus earlier work with Reptile House) and his assorted side projects, it's fascinating to see Higgs traveling into such complex quarters with his solo material. (In terms of artists making the most of second or third-legs, he ranks with ex-Swan, current-Angel of Light Michael Gira.) As a continuum, it really feels like each dispatch depends on the others before and after it. Atomic Yggdrasil is truly heady stuff, but pair it with Ancestral's talking songs for the strongest results and clearest path. Higgs himself nails it in the acrostic for ""music"": ""Mighty / Undulations / Synchronize / Into / Cosmoses.""","The legendary, bountifully bearded Lungfish leader's swift follow-up to last year's Ancestral Songs continues the earlier's outer-space crunk transmissions. The disc also comes beautifully packaged with a 48-page hardcover book depicting a series of Higgs' totemic paintings and acrostics.

Eccentric Soul: The Prix Label,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b167b1335d7bf169a296/1:1/w_160/fd674dd1.jpg,2007-07-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10427-eccentric-soul-the-prix-label/,Numero Group,"In 2004, when Numero Group inaugurated its ambitious, by now essential Eccentric Soul series, it did so with a volume devoted to Bill Moss' Columbus, Ohio, label Capsoul. It was a disc that spoke to the enormous promise of such a project, and the imprint has since released five more excellent volumes in the series, excavating labels from Detroit, Chicago, Florida and Arizona. Perhaps it was just all the tantalizing names or references to the scene dropped in the liners of the Capsoul comp, but there was a sense of unfinished business regarding the world of Columbus small-label soul after that volume, and sure enough, Numero has returned to central Ohio for its latest. It would have been hard for a label to experience less sales success than Capsoul, but Prix Records, the distribution arm of the Harmonic Sounds studio, managed the trick. It was virtually unknown even in its day, serving more as a laboratory for musicians than a factory for hit 45s. In business for an eye-blink from 1969 to 1971, the studio and label nonetheless churned out a bonanza of killer funk and soul cuts, all of which went nowhere. And that's just what got released. Thirty years after the label closed its doors, a mostly unmarked box of demo recordings and a few finished masters showed up at an estate sale, waiting to be heard for the first time outside of Harmonic Sounds. Enter Numero, whose compilation mixes the released 45s with the unreleased stuff to tell the story of a remarkable assemblage of talent that was, alas, destined to toil in obscurity. Prix Records was founded by an unlikely duo: Mississippi-born Clem Price, a veteran who worked much of his life for a defense contractor, and George Beter, a floundering West Virginian lawyer whose brother introduced him to Price. The first group signed to Prix, the Royal Esquires, was drafted in its entirety after recording just one single, as apt an omen for the fate of the label overall as any. Both sides of that single are here, both of them fantastic vocal harmony numbers that blend doo-wop techniques with then-modern r&b production. The members do some nice lead-trading in the faster of the two, ""Ain't Gonna Run"", and both songs were co-written by member Ron Farthing, a talented multi-instrumentalist who worked at a studio across town. ""Melon Jelly"", credited to the Soul Ensemble, is actually Farthing in the studio by himself, doing everything from playing drums to singing harmony, playing lead guitar, and making himself into an entire horn section. Farthing was part of the Soul Partners, one of hundreds of extraordinary and completely unknown backing bands across the country who soundtracked the youths of an entire generation without anyone even realizing it. The Partners later had some small-scale success as the Buckeye Politicians, but that was after Prix was long-gone. Prix's central singing talent was the luckless Eddie Ray, who stopped performing alongside Sam & Dave just before they signed with Atlantic and started churning out hits under the guidance of Isaac Hayes. Ray's three tracks here are bolstered by two demos in the ""Extended Play"" section of the disc, and his voice is the first thing that stands out-- he was right up there with the best Stax had to offer, including Sam & Dave, gritty but melodic, and capable of powering his way over any backing track. His released singles, ""You Got Me"" and ""Glad I Found You"", were good, but it's the one that stayed on the shelf until now that's truly eye-opening. ""Wait a Minute"" is a breakneck stormer of a soul tune, draping a slow vocal melody over a whipping beat and billowing horns. I just get this picture of the drummer slowly melting into a salty puddle as the song progresses and he has to keep up this ridiculous rhythm. The horns alternate between jumping in the pocket created by the drums and playing against the rhythm with soft, open chords, and there's even a nasty psychedelic guitar part played by Joe King that crops up in the middle. King got his own crack at record-making, and, despite preferring to remain in the background, he sings his ass off on his two solo tracks. Had he chosen to, he could have held his own with classic soul singers like Billy Paul and Al Wilson. His ""You're My Everything"" is a stunning slow jam, his own wah-wah-soaked guitar stoking his soaring vocal on to ever greater heights of passion. Elsewhere, an old Eccentric Soul friend resurfaces: Marion Black had one of my favorite Capsoul tracks with the masterful ""Who Knows"", and he nearly equals it on ""Listen, Black Brother"", a slow-burning ballad on which he spills out all of his frustration over black-on-black crime as a flute screams away in the bluesy, beaten-down backing track. Capsoul's Ronnie Taylor also returns, this time at the helm of instrumental funk band OFS Unlimited. Prix had all the ingredients for success: talented lead performers, a stable of excellent backing musicians, solid financial backing and a studio of its own, and yet here we are three and a half decades, hearing some of this music for the first time, and most of the rest of it for what may as well be the first time. Like so many of its counterparts, the label simply petered out and dried up when success proved elusive, leaving behind a tiny but artistically memorable legacy that's thankfully been resuscitated years after it all went down. It's still worth hearing.","Another trawl through a forgotten Midwestern soul label's dusty archives-- this time the Columbus, Ohio, imprint Prix-- and once again the Numero Group unearths some lost classics.

Absolute Garbage,Garbage,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1789d034d5c69bf4a11/1:1/w_160/d13861d8.jpg,2007-07-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10441-absolute-garbage/,Geffen,"For all the hoopla made about the overnight transition from late-80s hair metal to early 90s grunge and the alternative music boom, people forget how equally quickly mindless top 40 rock had its revenge. In 1994, artists like R.E.M., Morrissey, Beck, and Nirvana topped Billboard's Modern Rock Track charts for a significant number of weeks. Then, just one year later, walking time capsules like Live, Better Than Ezra, Goo Goo Dolls, and Silverchair supplanted them. Armed with three producer-musicians and a jaw-dropping frontwoman, Garbage hatched from that aesthetic fall-out, poised to lay claim to the rock-radio vacuum. Absolute Garbage neatly documents their attempted coup, reminding us that, for better or worse, Garbage were one of the most memorable rock bands in the initial post-grunge years. Despite the number of grunge/goth markers they flaunted-- circles under the eyes, grainy, psychologically 'disturbing' videos, a self-flagellating ethos-- Garbage was undeniably pop from the onset. Absolute Garbage's tracklist and accompanying DVD attest to this, displaying how the band often milked five or six singles from an album and made the right music videos to sell them. Adhering strictly to chronological order, the album kicks off with the band's debut and best material. Techno-rock hybrids like ""Milk"" and ""Vow"" don't sound so novel today in a world Pro-Tooled to perfection, but the band's production troika, led by Nevermind and Siamese Dream svengali Butch Vig, deftly manipulated simple, catchy melodies and chord progressions to maximize their cross-genre fanbase. Bereaved Cobain apostles could rally behind ""Only Happy When It Rains"" for its woe-is-me irony and fuzzy bassline, while MTV-crazed teeny boppers simply couldn't get enough of Shirley Manson's girl group-friendly hooks. Validated by their debut's success, Garbage cranked up the hit machine to 11 with Version 2.0, a blockbuster of an album that contributes five solid tracks here. Feeding off the late-90s success of the Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk, the band's pop songs received a house injection with ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Push It"" soaring over newfound glitchy percussion and robotic guitar effects. However, the real apex here is ""Special"", an infectious Pretenders ode able to stand on its own without the studio bells and whistles. The turn of the century wasn't kind to the band, and the compilation's final third reminds us of this all too painfully. Creative juices clearly were in short supply by the 1999 Bond theme ""The World Is Not Enough"", a predictable ""Goldfinger"" permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big budget theatrics. When 2001's beautifulgarbage took a stab at more ""experimental"" territory-- a move Garbage weren't equipped for-- Manson ended up sounding as bubblegum as the girly-girl late 90s singers she distinguished herself from on earlier releases. ""Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)"" and ""Shut Your Mouth"" ape Gwen Stefani hella bad, while ""Bleed Like Me""'s boring acoustic guitar and sarcastic lyrics scream out Sheryl Crow. Spanking new single ""Tell Me Where It Hurts"", swollen with canned strings and Manson's Chrissie Hynde affectations, provides little hope for a Garbage rebound. The band's seemingly desperate to reinvigorate their cultural cachet, but Absolute Garbage's latter half emphasizes the depths they've fallen. Even on the enclosed DVD documentary, the band never appears as profound or engaging as the peripheral artists (c.f. Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor) they bump elbows with. Still, even the most hardened underground scenester may be surprised at how many quality hits they'll recognize on this collection. Whether classified as an extremely accessible grunge band or an extremely demented S&M pop outfit, the band left an indelible mark on mainstream rock in an era when boy bands, latin pop explosions, swing revivals and other cringe-worthy fads were gobbling rock bands up. It's just a shame Garbage had to outlive their usefulness to such an aesthetically displeasing degree.","One of the more distinctive bands to emerge from mid-90s modern rock cobbles together its best-known tracks for this terribly titled compilation.

Planet Earth,Prince,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1835e6ef9596932213a/1:1/w_160/9a58d79f.jpg,2007-07-23 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10450-planet-earth/,Sony,"We always expect too much of Prince, because it's difficult to accept that somebody who made records as astonishing as he did in the 1980s could repeat himself as egregiously as he has for the past 15 years or so. He hasn't been doing r&b-by-numbers or rock-by-numbers, which is why he gets away with it; he's just been doing Prince-by-numbers. And yes, he still brings it live. But his albums used to send everyone scrambling to catch up; now they're self-evidently whatever he deigns to knock out.  Princeophiles always have a few great recent songs we can trot out as evidence he hasn't really lost it. Last time, it was ""Black Sweat""; this time, it's ""Mr. Goodnight"", a sticky-hot seduction rap that all but acknowledges the genre's latter-day debt to Smoove B. He rhymes ""Moët"" with ""private jet,"" namechecks 3121 (maybe the album, maybe the club), shouts out ""mp3!"" and offers to lay out three dresses (so you can pick the one you like) and call you to find out which you've picked so he can wear a matching suit. Most of Planet Earth, though, is textbook bad Prince. It's one thing to work from the assumption that he's the hottest thing on two legs, because he's never lost that. But when he works from the assumption that his political thoughts are deep and meaningful, he bricks. The title track is an ecological anthem so dopey it makes saving the world sound like a questionable idea; the closer, ""Resolution"", is an antiwar anthem so self-righteous it makes peace sound smug. ""The main problem with war is that nobody ever wins,"" goes the first line, and as above-all-you-mortals as prime-period Prince's politics could get (remember ""Hello""?), at least he never tried to tell us what the main problem with war was. The rest of the album is stuff he's done before and better. ""The One U Wanna C"" is a blatant rewrite of ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" (right down to the declaration that ""you ain't no one night stand"") without the emotional depth, subtlety, or musical eccentricities. ""Guitar"", a reminder that he plays guitar, doesn't even have much of a riff. ""Chelsea Rodgers"" is an incoherently moralistic disco jam that squashes its groove between big, dangling quotation marks, as if it came to the West End Records sound by way of an Of Montreal tribute band. Where is the Thinker of Weird Thoughts who gave us ""Raspberry Beret"" and ""Starfish and Coffee""? Well, he's not entirely gone-- that's why we keep listening. There are always flashes of him, as at the end of the pedestrian slow jam ""Future Baby Mama"", where he goes into a purring little recitative, ending ""deep down, I know what you want-- you want your girlfriends to hate you."" Then he harmonizes with himself in one of his thick, layered harmony-clusters: ""'Cause they can't get your man!"" ""Somewhere Here on Earth"" is the kind of bedroom-eyed ballad he used to knock out one-handed in the Parade days, enlivened by his freaky but kind of fantastic Billie Holiday impression, but tragically oversold by witless jazz piano and an overdubbed ""crackly record"" sound. The album's cameo appearances by Wendy & Lisa and Sheila E. are overt signals that this is supposed to be a new manifestation of the prodigal Prince, the one who had all the hits; that he's going to spray us all down with his magical ejaculating guitar, just like the old days. And, you know, he might. He doesn't this time, but he might yet; if this were his first album, it'd be really promising. It's entirely possible that Prince's problem isn't sputtering talent but QC on the fritz. A whack to the right part of the machine, and his next whole album could be as hot as ""Mr. Goodnight"" and ""Black Sweat"" and, I don't know, ""Cinnamon Girl"". As it is, though, he's firmly settled in a stylistic niche that's delivering diminishing returns-- and what made him great in the first place is that he never settled down anywhere for long.","So far this year Prince has wowed at the Super Bowl, returned to First Avenue for the first time in decades, and gave this album away in UK newspapers. Unfortunately, his new music is unlikely to generate as much conversation.

Aelita,Tied & Tickled Trio,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1709d034d5c69bf4a02/1:1/w_160/354fa83e.jpg,2007-07-20 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10434-aelita/,Morr,"Band names are by nature so advertorial that truth in advertising standards ought to apply. Klaxons, LCD Soundsystem, and Pissed Jeans lead the way in responsible nomenclature, giving listeners an accurate sense of what to expect from the music. But the majority of band names are either meaningless or blatantly misleading. We could dispense with two of the most egregious offenders right off the bat by having Germany's Tied & Tickled Trio swap names with Australia's Architecture in Helsinki. The former's associations (giddy, quirky, spastic) attach seamlessly to AinH's disjointed pep-squad rock, while the latter's (stately, austere, glacial) handily summarize the sterile geometrical architecture Tied & Tickled Trio erect on Aelita, a quickie album (recorded in a handful of days) that abandons the group's usual electronic jazz (no horns) in favor of mechanically exact, interstellar wallpaper. Tied & Tickled Trio's recordings generally begin in improvisation and end in careful arrangement, and Aelita is no exception, although you'd never know it from the music's rigor mortised strains. Unlike the group's excellent 2003 album Observing Systems, no trace of the moment's lyricism or joyous serendipity has survived the composition stage. Instead, heavy-handed ranks of xylophone, glockenspiel, and mellotron plod turgidly toward foregone conclusions, and the album feels like some quiet, remote place where dub and trip-hop slink off to die. The three incarnations of ""Aelita"" are gauzy music-box minuets, variously obscured by mellotron hazes and ancillary harmonics. ""You Said Tomorrow Yesterday"" features a telegraphic rhythm track and Badalamentian chimes incrementally ramping up toward a post-apocalyptic shush. For bloggers, the following tags will be useful: Russia, sci-fi, 1920s. The brisk, splintery dub of ""Tamaghis"" is named for one of William Burroughs' Cities of the Red Night; the eerie ripples of ""Chlebnikov"" are an homage to Russian sound poet Velemir Chlebnikov, who died in 1922; the album's title might derive from Alexei Tolstoy's 1923 sci-fi novel about an expedition to Mars or the planned Soviet spacecraft named after it. Given all of this movement, suspense, and heady atmosphere, the album's feeling of deep stagnancy is hard to fathom. Maybe Aelita does too good a job of capturing that ""arcing through endless space in an escape pod"" feeling, with its lugubrious pacing, constrained interplay, and limited palette: After the initial wonder wears off, the endlessness of space becomes rather dull. Maybe it's too monolithic in this mood of starry abstraction, which dominates every chamber of the album, and too inflexibly linear in its execution-- each song's dynamics ratchet up with such surgical precision that the listener begins to feel like a musical Nostradamus, able to predict with pinpoint accuracy when the drum track is about to sprout an extra shimmy or the xylophone fugue an extra kink. Or maybe it's because we know, from previous Tied & Tickled Trio albums, Lali Puna's lively electro-pop, and especially the Notwist's still-stunning Neon Golden, that Markus Acher & co. are capable of doing more with less than they're doing here. At any rate, Aelita is perfect for art gallery openings, dinner parties, and scoring silent sci-fi films. But beyond its utility as a backdrop, it's an awfully cold, blank, and directionless void to trawl alone.","Markus Acher's recordings with Tied & Tickled Trio generally begin in improvisation and end in careful arrangement, and Aelita is no exception, working with xylophone, glockenspiel, and mellotron to aim for a record of movement, suspense, and heady atmosphere.

Streams,Excepter,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1705e6ef9596932211c/1:1/w_160/2ddff8fb.jpg,2007-07-20 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10433-streams/,Fusetron,"Excepter's recently released Tank Tapes came with a clause: ""This is not practice. This is training."" Because practice is what bands do to stop sucking, and if Excepter stopped sucking in the vernacular sense, they'd also stop being interesting. Excepter have made an art out of never actually playing a song, and in the interim, sort of turning around and facing the possibility of a song, sniffing it, chewing it, and throwing up on it. Practice implies a goal, and if Excepter has one, it's to never let sound capitulate into coherent music. So, training. Training takes place in a vacuum-- it's for athletes or soldiers whose terrain hasn't been fully revealed. Excepter's sterling history of reluctance and success in not playing a single pleasant note is captured, in jumbled time-lapse phonography, on Streams, a two-disc set distilling 30-odd hours of 36 podcasts the band recorded and released for free between 2003 and 2006. Give the title room to breathe and it's a pun on at least three levels-- streaming audio, water's perpetual motion, and Excepter's own stream of consciousness. And yet, Streams reveals an evolution of impetus: Excepter's soft, queasy abstractions have drifted further from the model of electro-acoustic improv set forth by tribes like the No-Neck Blues Band (who used to count Excepter's John Fell Ryan as a member) to something more rhythm-based, influenced by reggae's casual bounce and a corrosive, amateurish take on dub. 2005's Self Destruction was even pitched as a ""house record,"" which it wasn't, unless dancing requires a concussion. The devastation Excepter has wrought is not only in being either the laziest and most intense band in America, or the most enchanting and most repulsive, but in transposing the noncommittal stoner gunk of drone and head music into something we're supposed to move to. As mouthpiece, Ryan has coalesced: Where he once moaned at nothing in particular, he's managed to forge a hybrid of Jamaican toaster, Jim Morrison, and a homeless man. And make it a comedy routine. Sort of. But Streams, curated by superfan Robert Girardin (a task more trying than listening to Excepter or probably even being in Excepter), is only one person's perspective on the band's powers. The streams are still being consistently released; between those and last year's excellent Alternation, perspective travelers have better holes to fall in. Einstein said that ""the only reason for time is so everything doesn't happen at once,"" and I'm pretty sure he was anticipating Streams: for some bands, a compilation can be a gleaming sum; with Excepter, it feels better-- worse, sicker, more disorienting, in this case-- to be mired in the bog, crawling to no certain light, training for the void.","This two-disc set distills 30-odd hours of 36 podcasts the Brooklyn band recorded and released for free between 2003 and 2006.

All the Birds Were Anarchists,September Collective,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1615e6ef95969322103/1:1/w_160/90105a66.jpg,2007-07-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10420-all-the-birds-were-anarchists/,Mosz,"One night not long ago, lying in bed and listening to the September Collective's mesmerizing new album All the Birds Were Anarchists, the image of a snowglobe filled with swirling flecks of gold leaf flashed into my mind, at which point my mental camera slowly zoomed out to reveal the orb sitting on a shiny black grand piano, surrounded by velvet curtains even blacker than the lacquer on the Steinway. It was only one of a thousand such images I've enjoyed while listening to All the Birds over and over and over these past few months. Should you listen to the disc-- and I urge you to-- you will doubtlessly have wildly different visions, but I promise you that you will see something. It simply is that kind of record. September Collective is the trio of Barbara Morgenstern, Stefan Schneider, and Paul Wirkus. If you know any of those names you'll have some idea of what to expect, as each artist's voice rings through true and clear. Morgenstern has recorded a number of releases, principally for Monika Enterprise and Leaf, featuring her pellucid voice and delicate arrangements of piano and synthesizer that convey a drifting pop sensibility, in the broadest possible sense. Stefan Schneider is best known as a member of To Rococo Rot and for his solo work as the ambient dub outfit Mapstation. And Paul Wirkus is an improvising laptop artist working with a library of chamber music samples and a small kit of analog synthesizers and effects. The group says that the project was born out of a shared 2002 tour in which each artist had solo billing. ""After we played our sets we found it senseless to end up a concert just like this and we started to improvise in the end of our show,"" writes the group in its bio. ""Although everyone of us works with loops and computers it worked out perfectly. So we continued after this tour and founded September Collective-- a project which is based on improvisation and trying out new things."" Their nonchalant, even naïve approach to group dynamics is all over All the Birds, but they're no dabblers: The album offers an engrossing and profoundly confident mélange of styles and timbres. Two levels predominate: one an improvisational scrim of shirred textures and intermittent sequining via brilliant sonic details, and the other a more robust structure of composed melody and songcraft. The two run parallel throughout the disc, swapping places and playing games, both within individual songs and throughout the album's entire arc. The first track, ""Out of Intention"", opens with a whir of out-of-time loops: cardiac thuds, insect skitter, intermittent hi-hats, a dusky blue unfolding that might once have been a keyboard, or maybe a saxophone. A rudimentary bass line enters, shrugging its shoulders, and a delicate counterpoint blossoms in the piano's treble register. Far in the back, an unadorned drum machine keeps time-- with its MIDI cables apparently disconnected. (I love the way September Collective appropriates dance music's most basic tool to use pedestrian sounds in mercurial ways.) Against this nodding pulse, Morgenstern embroiders free, filigreed piano riffs that hang just this side of George Winston's property line before disappearing in the whir of Oval's hard drive. Beginning in the same shimmering approximation of key, ""Das Meer"" (""The Sea"") muddles its loops into an arrhythmic whirlpool. An electronic sound like a bassoon, a higher muted reed line, and an almost imperceptible Rhodes fuse into an inseparable three-part structure that sounds uncannily like something from Talk Talk's Laughing Stock. Haphazardly brushed drums suggest that everything could fall apart at any second-- until that piano returns, almost certainly Morgenstern's, stitching everything lovingly back together. From chaos, pop-- and in a rush of hummingbird's wings and fingered stemware, it all dissolves back into ether again-- again, a whole lot like late period Talk Talk. And that's just the record's first 10 minutes. ""Natura"", opening with looped and fizzed piano reverb, finds the players staking out their spaces in a three-cornered room, with what sounds like Morgenstern drifting into a melodic right-hand reverie, Schneider laying down dub-inspired sub-bass and melodica, and Wirkus doing his damnedest to untether his colleagues' steadfast mooring, letting a loop of close-miked piano clatter go flapping into the red. The same trick appears three tracks later, on ""Pausenband"", suggesting a box of ghosts hell-bent on breaking the locks, while the clacking percussion of ""Our Cat"" leads seamlessly into ""Essentially Unchanged"", where it plays out-- yes, essentially unchanged-- beneath limpid keyboards. Such recycled loops and recurring themes, far from suggesting meager hard-drive holdings, help not only to bind the record tightly together, but also to weave it into your very consciousness. I suspect that's one of the main reasons All the Birds has become one of my preferred bedtime listens of late. It's not simply that the record's palette is generally subdued and, well, mellow; but when the body is at rest and the brain slipping into hypnagogic drift, that's precisely when September Collective's quiet anarchy reassembles itself into such improbable, impossibly beautiful forms. Sometimes, it's better when music doesn't make sense, but like the iconography of dreams, simply runs free, making its own haphazard associations as it goes.","Trio of Barbara Morgenstern, Stefan Schneider, and Paul Wirkus creates electronic music that alternates improvisation with a more robust structure of composed melody and songcraft.

The Freed Man,Sebadoh,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b180ea9e61561daa67ac/1:1/w_160/e01b8269.jpg,2007-07-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10448-the-freed-man/,HomesteadHomestead,"""My soulmate is a special girl, a girl that's just like me/ She'll share tremendous oral sex and try everything she sees/ She won't be insane or hung up like most other girls/ I'll worship her until it hurts, 'cause she's on top of my world."" Those lines open Lou Barlow's wonderfully warbled love ballad ""Soulmate""-- on which, in less than two minutes, the gently tapping troubadour collapses into a hyper-strummed folk implosion. It's what I remembered most from Sebadoh's The Freed Man. I played the cassette version obsessively when it was released by Homestead; until recently, I hadn't heard it in close to a decade. It's weird what you forget. When the expanded reissue of Sebadoh's debut outing arrived on the doorstep, I dug through the boxes in my closet containing seriously musty Shrimper, Union Pole, Search For Terrestrial Intelligence, Eldest Son, and Catsup Plate cassettes. Beside two coffee-stained copies of Sentridoh's Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93, I uncovered a very worn The Freed Man Homestead original. The newbie has the same photo of Barlow and Eric Gaffney smiling and waving on the front. Listening to the oldie beside this expanded edition, though, is an entirely different experience. For starters, Lou and Eric's original pre-Homestead cassette has more than doubled in length. That first version is an incredibly rare self-released edition of 25 or so copies -- 30 minutes with two 15-minute sides, as Gaffney told me via email. He explained, ""I duped copies and sold those at Main Street Records, Northampton, MA for $1.00 in a box I made with Dr. Seuss art."" I have the Homestead cassette (32 songs), but was too cheap to splurge on the Homestead vinyl (which Gaffney told me was ""muddy, botched, redone a 2nd time""). It's kind of like detective work piecing together all these drafts. Gaffney noted that this new 52-song reissue is actually the fourth version: ""The reissue contains songs and versions (one each, not multiple) from the orignal cassette release... from the LP version [i.e. the Homestead version], a few of my songs, re-recorded, off The Freed Weed CD, and unreleased tracks, along with the 2nd and 3rd 'singles' and part of the first split."" Got it? Probably not. Whatever the math, the extras and different mixes/takes shift something once familiar into a gargantuan 79-minute lo-fi opera. It's fascinating from an archival standpoint, and I love that Gaffney painstakingly organized a brand new collage. This Freed Man is overstuffed and weird, studded with some duds, and entirely fitting. Part of the joy of early Sebadoh-- this collection through Bubble and Scrape, aka the Gaffney years-- is the clash of egos and brilliant songwriters. It's totally evident on this new version: 25 songs by Lou, 25 by Eric, and two covers, including a garage-punk take on the Beatles ""Yellow Submarine"". Pretty telling, right? To take it even further, the cassette was re-mastered at Abbey Road Studios. It's a lot of fun reading the separate notes provided by each player and figuring out the different histories. Gaffney's liners provide background about the record and trivia about his songs. Barlow's are briefer, but still historical: He mentions his favorite song of the bunch (""Jealous Evil""), and includes the totally dead-on statement that ""this record was intended to be a mess, a stinking garden of delights."" Hence the swamp-side photo on the cover (also mentioned by Barlow). Contextual shit aside, it's just great to hear Lou's downer folk countered by Eric's noise-punk-- that massive push and pull. Fittingly, random feedback invades even the album's prettiest ballads. Chaotic cut-and-paste cassette noise tramples ambling pop songs. Fragments are held together by 4-track tape experiments, thorny acoustic bits, psychedelic hardcore, samples of television and family time. After Gaffney left, the band felt emasculated and boring, so for a fan of the old shit, this is a rare treat. I remember certain days as a kid fast-forwarding through some of the noisier pieces to get to ""Soulmate"", Barlow's gently tapping ""True Hardcore"" (""True hardcore is forever young""), and ""Healthy Sick"", or cringing at the dorky ""Lou Rap."" Other days you stuck to Gaffney's amazing fuzzcore, like the bottomed out, phased ""Nest"". In the extras it's amazing to find skeletons: The patterns of ""Elements"" reborn as III's manic finale, ""As the World Dies the Eyes of God Grow Bigger"". Or to remember the things that were there all along like the forgotten brass on ""Punch in the Nose"", the crazed screaming and bleeding sounds turning into the harmonizing pop nugget, ""K-Sensa-My"" (Barlow, '86). So many new discoveries, too: ""Oak Street Raga"", ""Dance,"" ""Fire of July"", ""Jaundice"", ""The Lorax"". The earliest material is Barlow circa 1984 (""Pig"", not yet freed) and the newest, a live version of Gaffney's ""Attention"" (Hadley, MA, 1990). Of course, the irony of releasing The Freed Man now is pretty huge. The title was partly a response to Barlow's recent freedom from Dinosaur and his control-freak nemesis, J Mascis (his thoughts, not mine). At this point he's not only back with Dinosaur J, they managed to record a new record. It sounds great, sure, but it's divorced from the time that made it essential. This shit, though, is so of its time and place. It's necessary for anyone who prefers the Mountain Goats on cassette or likes noise with their morning breakfast and summertime poetry. It breathes gorgeous dope-smoking breaths all over the place. (Crazy to remember this was going on alongside Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me, Bug...all so amazing, but so amazingly different). Okay, before listening, consider this set-up: A DJ and zine editor who delivers pizza for the Pizza Factory and collaborates with the late Charles Ondras (who went on to become Unsane's amazing drummer, RIP) joins his Sentridoh pal, Dinosaur's bassist, who comes armed with a cheap, parent-purchased 4-track. The two start smoking pot (""things sounded better slow...""), experimenting, feeling giddy with the results. This is a history I actually care about. It's gorgeous on so many levels.","The expanded reissue of Lou Barlow and Eric Gaffney's Sebadoh debut now features 52 tracks (up from 32), turning something once familiar into a gargantuan 79-minute lo-fi opera.

Sticking Fingers Into Sockets EP,Los Campesinos!,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1379d034d5c69bf49bc/1:1/w_160/cb89447b.jpg,2007-07-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10382-sticking-fingers-into-sockets-ep/,Arts & CraftsWichita,"Los Campesinos! aren't the first act to make a name for themselves on MySpace. They may, however, be one of the first guitar groups in the UK who really sound like products of Web 2.0. The artists they idolize-- Pavement, Broken Social Scene, Yo La Tengo, Deerhoof, Destroyer-- are bands feverishly championed in blogs and online zines (yes, including Pitchfork), not the latest batch of tabloid-friendly lads who only listen to Oasis or the Clash. ""It's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters,"" Gareth Campesino! chimes in on MySpace hit ""You! Me! Dancing!"", then adds, ""Even if we were, it's not the scene you're thinking."" He's probably right. As it usually goes in the MySpace era, most of the songs on the young septet's jangly debut EP may already be familiar to you. Produced by one of the band's heroes, Broken Social Scene's David Newfeld, Sticking Fingers Into Sockets includes: (1) debut single ""We Throw Parties, You Throw Knives""; (2) flip-side ""Don't Tell Me to Do the Math(s)""; (3) the second single, a re-recorded ""You! Me! Dancing!""; (4) flip-side ""It Started With a Mixx""; and (5) a cover of Watery, Domestic's ""Frontwards"" that has the contagious enthusiasm of a first-rate music blogger. The only track on the EP you couldn't (legally) hear for free right now until recently was 30-second throwaway ""Clunk-Rewind-Clunk-Play-Clunk"", but now even that's streaming. And two respected indie labels expect people to buy this disc. You might even want to. Silly names aside, Los Campesinos! play superbly crafted indie pop that bounces off walls like Love Is All, grins with the childlike exuberance of Bis, and throws the toy chest into its arrangements like Architecture in Helsinki. Glockenspiels and pizzicato violin veer into reckless guitar riffs and full-bodied handclaps-- or fizz over, like Mentos and Coke, into happy-stupid crescendos. Gareth shares lead vocal duties with the similarly pseudonymous Aleksandra Campesino!, and their boy-girl exchanges give the music an extra, sweet frisson. Newfeld's treatment turns ""You! Me! Dancing!"" from a lo-fi rallying cry into an unstoppable force for converting spindly legs into dancefloor blurs. Some music should not be enjoyed sitting down in front of a computer. Beneath all the exclamation points, Los Campesinos! sneak in charming lyrics that range from the everyday to the absurd. In the tradition of mixtape songs since Bow Wow Wow's ""C30, C60, C90, Go!"", the band's ""It Started With a Mixx"" finds Gareth ""trying to find the perfect match between pretentious and pop."" While the Lesley Gore-referencing ""We Throw Parties, You Throw Knives"" could be anything from a political statement to another assault against lunkheaded Libertines wannabes, ""Don't Tell Me to Do the Math(s)"" imagines bookworms gone wild, spewing potential MySpace quotes: ""Don't read Jane Eyre!"" or the too-clever ""I will throw you high-fives if you keep your own secrets!"" You actually don't need ""Clunk-Rewind-Clunk-Play-Clunk""-- a tease with more shouts, glockenspiels, and vitamin-gobbling guitar hooks, but, most importantly for this paragraph, no real lyrics. ""Arctic Monkeys were an end,"" Simon Taylor-Thomas of UK dance-rockers Klaxons told Pitchfork, suggesting the Arctics are simply the best of a knackered bunch. They may have been made huge by MySpace, but they're also an example of the UK press giving the kids what they thought the kids should want; NME editor Conor McNicholas famously described his target reader as a 17-year-old who hates being stuck in Doncaster. The promise of the internet, however, is that no one is stuck. Los Campesinos! came up worshiping bands from America and Canada, and young people as far away as Chicago have posted YouTube videos of themselves dancing to ""You! Me! Dancing!"" As the song comes apart, like a roomful of revelers when the lights go on, Gareth falls into a speaking voice that recalls Scotland's Ballboy: ""We're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy."" And if your friends don't dance, then they ain't no friends of mine.","Cardiff-based band that idolizes North American indie has its infectious debut EP -- which features a Pavement cover-- produced by Broken Social Scene's Dave Newfeld. The result is superbly crafted indie pop that brings to mind Love Is All, Deerhoof, and Bow Wow Wow.

Burning Off Impurities,Grails,by: D.

Not because these densely packed astral-traveling psych- and Arabic-spiced jams aren't worthy, but because the Grails craft sprawling long players to be digested in one long gobble, much like the old-school lava-lamp-dripping and incense-burning albums of yesteryear. Songs subtly and dynamically build, flow, spiral, and explode-- following a similar formula as the band's most-likely signature influence Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- but unless one is paying close attention and is able to fight off the warm and fuzzy mistiness, one is unlikely to notice when the seven-minute-long tunes morph into a new jam. It's all about the LP, the kaleidoscope-turning ride-- and in this age of digital music, you don't even have to get up outta the beanbag to flip the side! If they haven't already, as the most excellent opening track, ""Soft Temple"" signifies, Grails really need to do soundtracks: light tribal drums introduce a Middle Eastern-sounding something-or-other (sounds like a banjo, but probably ain't) that gets hazed out by random percussion clouds and swirling guitar vapors; things chill in the opium den for awhile until galloping drums and a triumphant, melodic electric six-string signals the charge for higher ground. Another track to riff on world music modalities is the stormy, and-- gotta say it again, quite GY!BE-y-- ""Silk Rd"" that bellows out Indian drone (most likely from a sruti box) with serpentine sitar lines and electric axes that once again swell into an epic, tide-is-turning attack. Both numbers are totally cinematic, smartly layered, and quite unusual in that-- as California public radio station KFJC once perfectly coined-- ""Tibetan crime jazz"" sorta way. Keeping up the wide-screen vista themes, I'm guessing the Grails are intentionally aiming for such highly visual and ambient fare, but most notably because several pieces seem to vibe film score maestro Ennio Morricone. There's the title track, where piano and sun-drenched desert standoff guitars flip between the Western and the Middle-Eastern and then hit a crescendo with Bolero-blazing Spanish horns and Zeppelin III folky fretboard jangles. Or ""Origin-ing"", once again, tumbleweed-rolling via spaghetti-western accents and harmonica, but sounding like Morricone signed on one of the several atmospheric hovercraft rockers found on the Temporary Residence roster (Mono, Explosions in the Sky, Envy) for super-charged pick-me ups. Fans of Mogwai, Grails collaborators Red Sparowes, and the whole mostly non-metallic side of the instrumental-gaze school should freak on Burning Off Impurities, but considering their high-minded (both meanings) multi-instrumentation and multi-cultural scope, this Portland five-piece just may be the best, or at least most novel.","Globally-minded Portland band's instrumental rock takes the scenic route, journeying from the Middle East to an Italian vision of the Old West while making some intriguing stops along the way.

The Great Koonaklaster Speaks: A John Fahey Celebration,Various Artists,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1645e6ef95969322109/1:1/w_160/18ed8135.jpg,2007-07-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10423-the-great-koonaklaster-speaks-a-john-fahey-celebration/,Table of the Elements,"Sufjan Stevens, Lee Ranaldo, Devendra Banhart, Howe Gelb, Calexico, and a half-dozen others will forever be linked through the waste that is I Am the Resurrection, the 2006 tribute to late, great guitarist and composer John Fahey produced by M. Ward and Steve Brower. I Am the Resurrection is the first of four Fahey tributes released in the last 16 months, and, with the biggest names and the most opportunity to expose a new crowd to the man's work, it's the biggest failure. Sure, it's good-hearted enough, and some of the covers-- Banhart's cloudy, menacing spin on ""Sligo River Blues"" and Howe Gelb's clunky, grinning piano interpretation of ""My Grandfather's Clock""-- are convincing. But to think that I Am the Resurrection's alternately self-involved (Stevens) or irreverently unimaginative (Peter Case) interpretations gave newcomers invalid impressions of Fahey's catalogue is, really, a bit frightening. If Resurrection is the first and worst tribute to Fahey released since his 2001 death, The Great Koonaklaster Speaks is the newest and best, the clearest and most brazen picture of the onus and inspiration Fahey has left for modern music. Importantly, this is a tribute record, but it's not a covers record: Instead, it collects unreleased work from 11 current experimental acts that feel Fahey's influence and attempt to offer a glimpse of it here. Alternately humorous, solemn, grounded, and neoteric, the rangy work on Koonaklaster asserts that Fahey wasn't perfect or filtered, and that his legacy is at once challenging and lifting. It's not about critical doublespeak or who can pick the best six-string. Instead, its liner notes are a fictional mythology of Fahey's life written in his style, and the playing recasts the characteristics that fired his legacy. Bravo. Koonaklaster wastes no time: Jack Rose-- who appeared on one of Resurrection's better moments with Pelt-- opens with ""Since I've Been a Full Grown Man"", an 11-minute lament painted in layered motion by Rose's steel-on-steel slide moans dotted by the wonderfully expressive, wide chords Fahey wrangled so well. Rose is a guitarist of the highest order, and, from Fahey, he's not only borrowed technique but also extreme gravitas. Fahey once said, ""I can make syncopation sound like death""; ""Since I've Been a Full Grown Man"", then, is an ample weight for new shoulders. The disc's other bookend, a 12-minute closing piece in three parts from David Daniell, embodies the seeking, hybridizing nature of Fahey's best work. As a young guitarist, Fahey treated classical music, blues, country & western 78s, and pop fare as one body of music and attempted to feed it all through six steel strings. Later in life, Fahey married new interests in musique concrète and slower, almost droning pieces with this well-established, polyglot dexterity. Daniell gets this right with guitar motifs at the top and bottom, but-- between those poles-- the piece grinds through six minutes of menacing noise and drone. In doing so, Daniell encapsulates the best qualities of several other Koonaklaster contributions, like the loping comfort in music that Greg Malcolm references or the range of feeling that Ben Vida's theme-and-variation approach intimates. It speaks well of Fahey and those who've studied his moves. In these sorts of tributes, the artist baking in the spotlight of reverence is often parched of his personality: Fahey wasn't entirely morose or stoic, despite having Blind Joe Death as an alter ego. His collection of essays and short fictions, How Bluegrass Music Destroyed My Life, spills over with tiny jokes about the eternal war between cars and turtles; during the live set The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick, he laughs with delight after a fawning crowd cheers as he blows his nose. Pumice communicate hints of this levity with ""Ceremonial Knives"", a simple, repetitive figure beset by noise-makers and toy keyboards, their agility poking fun at the slow-moving guitar. In a more subtle move, Lichens-- who surprises with one of the best, most thoughtful tracks here-- begins with a beautiful, perfectly-paced acoustic, slowly peeling the guitar away to fill its void with a humming drone based on the tonic note. Later, flickers of the guitar dance around the pure tone, winking at it, teasing its unflinching devotion. Fahey wasn't a strict perfectionist, either. There was always a human risk (and sometimes error) involved in his music, and Koonaklaster communicates that as well. Near collection's end, Kentucky disciple R. Keenan Lawler fusses with time, tone, and tuning as he plays his resonator guitar, the overrunning phrases and uncertain rhythmic shifts communicating the challenges and rewards Fahey, his heroes, and his followers face by refusing to play too much too straight. It's a piece with personality, warts and quirks embedded among immense skill and imagination. After all, ""Fahey formed his vernacular through recordings,"" writes Nick Schillace, a Fahey student not included here, in his master's thesis, ""John Fahey and American Primitivism"". ""He took his basic technique and created an idiosyncratic cultivated style."" He didn't do it necessarily so that others could do the same. But Koonaklaster, at last a mighty tribute to a worthy subject, proves that he might as well have.","The fourth tribute to guitarist John Fahey released in the last 16 months turns out to be the best, as artists like Jack Rose, Lichens, and Pumice gather to offer original tracks that speak to the man's influence.

"Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever",The Cribs,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b175c0084474cd0c1dfd/1:1/w_160/afa3139d.jpg,2007-07-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10438-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever/,Warner Bros.,"The Cribs' 2005 breakthrough single ""Hey Scenesters!"" was a curious thing: A pointed piss-take of the only demographic who would probably care to buy their records. But instead of distancing the Yorkshire trio from the striped-shirt/black-jeaned plebes, it left you wondering: If these guys hate the scene so much, why do they seem so eager to join it by giving themselves a just-another-The-band name and pumping out standard-issue student-disco fare? That the band namedrop indie iconoclasts like Calvin Johnson and Bobby Conn in their bio while sounding like their record collection begins with Is This It and ends with Up the Bracket only makes the gesture seem more misguided. Well the lads are nothing if not tenacious, opening their new album with another meta-missive-- albeit this one's directed at the herd-like masses. But the smug self-satisfaction of ""Hey Scenesters!"" has been displaced by the more sobering realization that the only way to rise above indie insularity is ""to impress our bovine public."" And so Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever spares no expense in making sure the cows come home: The Cribs' major-label debut was helmed by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos (who assumes the famous-Scottish-producer role filled by Edwyn Collins on 2005's The New Fellas), mixed by alt-rock heavyweight Andy Wallace, and features perhaps the unlikeliest indie-celeb cameo since Laetitia Sadier showed up on a Common album. But all the marquee names in the world wouldn't mean a thing if the Cribs didn't step up in the songwriting department, and the trio answer Kapranos' ready-for-prime-time production with chart-gazing tunes. In contrast to The New Fellas' rough-sketch pub-rock slop, there's a marked increase in passion and precision-- it would appear Kapranos has taught frontman Ryan Jarman a thing or two about projecting his voice to the back rows. Opening trifecta ""Our Bovine Public"", ""Girls Like Mystery"", and ""Men's Needs"" charge out of the gate brandishing a familiar arsenal of morse-code guitar riffs, new-waved drumbeats and thick-accented shout-speak, but like the Futureheads on their first album (and unlike the Futureheads on their second), the Cribs have found a way to translate their twitchy tension into compact, exciting pop songs where the bridges are sturdy enough to be choruses. Though ""Men's Needs"" is answered later on by the Pixies-pinching ""Women's Needs"", the ""Whatever"" in the album title ultimately sums up the half-hearted attempt at conceptual narrative. And that's probably for the best, as the Cribs don't provide any probing insights into the mysteries of gender politics (in case you haven't heard: men are selfish pricks). And besides, Jarman's more charismatic when pointing the finger at himself: ""I'm a realist/ I'm a romantic,"" he sings on ""I'm a Realist"", before drawing attention to that admission's inherent contradiction: ""I'm an indecisive piece of shit."" But the lyrics are ultimately secondary to the album's spirited momentum, which maintains a steady clip until being derailed by the late-game curveball of ""Be Safe"", featuring a surprising, spoken-word appearance from Lee Ranaldo (though his past production work with You Am I suggests a certain soft spot for fledgling power-pop bands). But rather than running wild with his patented sci-fi/beat-poet spiel, Ranaldo narrates this lugubrious power ballad with a trite, anti-consumerist screed that could've been ripped straight from the diary of one of the Cribs' more depressed 16-year-old fans; Jarman's climactic, emo-kid chorus confirms the song's status as a second-rate knock-off of Nada Surf's ""Popular"". It's an unnecessary incongruity on a record that had already done well to fulfill its loftier ambitions, and the Cribs seem to know it-- is it a coincidence that the album closes with a humbling acoustic ballad called ""Shoot the Poets""?","The UK band follows its 2005 Edwyn Collins-produced breakthrough The New Fellas with a major-label debut helmed by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and mixed by alt-rock heavyweight Andy Wallace-- and it features perhaps the unlikeliest indie-celeb cameo since Laetitia Sadier showed up on a Common album.

Silent Shout Deluxe Edition,The Knife,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b176c0084474cd0c1e01/1:1/w_160/7fc892ab.jpg,2007-07-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10439-silent-shout-deluxe-edition/,Mute,"In his review of Swedish electro duo the Knife's 2006 meisterverk Silent Shout, Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik waxed ecstatic about how Olof Dreijer worked his sister Karin Dreijer Andersson's vocals through sickly FX, making her nursery rhyme delivery sound like it was coming from the bottom of a slimy well. But Dreijer's crude palette of old-school electro/techno sounds managed to exert a feeling of anxiety all on their own, picking under the scab of never-ending 1980s retro-kitsch until pus bubbled up from underneath. Now a little more than a year later, Mute repackages the album with a DVD featuring a spectacle of a live performance from Stockholm in 2006, where the visual aesthetic mines a similar vein of nostalgia for the heebie-jeebies that out-of-date technology can induce, plus 11 music videos and an extra CD containing the audio track from said live performance. For those of us who bought the record the first time around, it's basically your chance to buy a new Knife DVD, and if you're a fan, it's pretty much worth owning two copies of the same CD. The DVD, Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience, begins in an inky blankness broken by audience screams, as the emergency alarm bleeps and astringent arpeggios of ""Pass This On"" are slowly assembled. When the duo are finally revealed-- androgynous in what look like janitor's uniforms and bathed in cerulean light, with Olof jerking at his machinery and Karin pulling nervous mime moves-- they come off like a sinister cross between Devo's unsatisfied twitches and Daft Punk's studied roboticisms. Backed by exploding neon lights and arena-sized video projections, when Karin begins snapping her fingers and awkwardly swaying during ""You Make Me Like Charity"", she looks like an android go-go dancer or a space alien who has intercepted transmissions of late 80s episodes of ""Club MTV"". Even the human element of the Knife's performance feels artificial, some approximation of humanity knocked together by machines that's as intensely unnerving as their records. An Audio Visual Experience isn't so much a concert film as a 50-minute music video that's been extensively edited and tarted up after the fact, with enough quick cuts at jarring angles to feel as epileptic as the video games you can hear in the band's music. Orchestrated by Andreas Nilsson and Ossian Ekman, it's as decadent as cyberpunk Weimar cabaret. Rough-hewn digital imagery blurs into repurposed Super-8 home video, simple geometric paterns flare into life and spin across the screen like a perverted planetarium's laser light show, and throughout there's that pervasive unease. Like Boards of Canada with the queasiness cranked to 10, all those smudgy faces from someone else's home movies, pixilated effects from the days of 8-bit computers, and other visual tropes you half-remember from growing up mingle with the band's sour, often operatic black forest overhaul of synth-pop to radiate discomfort. An Audio Visual Experience isn't wholly successful; parts of it veer uncomfortably toward the feeling that you could be watching old Nine Inch Nails performances with the sepia-tinting replaced by deep blues and purples. But there are enough indelible images-- the Atari snowflakes that begin falling during ""Heartbeats"" for instance-- to give it more replay value than your average multi-angle concert film. The 11 music videos (and one short film) included on the DVD have a broader range and a lighter touch than the concert's unrelenting Grand Guignol. Culled from across the band's discography, they flit from the whimsical domestic scene (literally) sketched out in ""N.Y. Hotel"", to more crude CGI and home movies for ""Heartbeats"", to a heavily eyeliner-ed take on ""You Take My Breath Away"" that would almost feel like a parody of 80s revivalism if the band didn't really sell those leather jackets with ostentatious shoulder pads. ""Handy Man"", with its hyperreal colors and talking hammers, likewise feels like a loving pisstake of the pounding cheese that Euro-pop has been crapping out for decades and that you can still see weekly in U.S. gay clubs, and the dancing skeletons of a second take on ""You Take My Breath Away"" are so bargain basement that they briefly made me nostalgic for those charmingly crappy ""psychedelic"" computer animations of early 90s rave videos. And despite its forward-thinking rep, the Knife is clearly a pretty nostalgic band, too. As two twentysomething Swedes, these 80s and 90s visual signifiers are the broth their brains were boiled in while growing up. The siblings' enduring fascination with the evocative powers of primitive electronics, whether musical or visual, combined with the florid gothic streak that bloomed on Silent Shout, has resulted in a pretty rich stew. While the inclusion of the original album is superfluous and the second disc capturing the music of the live Stockholm performance is pointless, Silent Shout Deluxe Edition is worth picking up for its near pitch-perfect visual rendering of the band's appeal-- creepy but seductive images from the decade's most unexpected purveyors of bad dreams.",,8.0,
Death of the Sun,Matteah Baim,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a122ea9e61561daa470b/1:1/w_160/19e42822.jpg,2007-07-19 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10426-death-of-the-sun/,Dicristina,"Since most artists are understandably reluctant to have their work labeled and/or categorized, it seems natural to be skeptical when Matteah Baim preemptively dubs her debut solo album ""new age grunge."" What's more discouraging is the slow realization that the music on Death of the Sun isn't even quite as intriguing as Baim's descriptive red herring implies. Instead, the first album from the non-CocoRosie half of Metallic Falcons continues with some of that project's more spacious and atmospheric lullabies, but relies too often on wispy songs and melodies that appear to evaporate before reaching the ground. CocoRosie's Sierra Casady--Baim's befeathered cohort in Metallic Falcons--makes no appearance here, but several other artists from the duo's shared orbit make contributions, including Devendra Banhart, Jana Hunter, and Pit Er Pat's Rob Doran. As with the Falcons' mesmeric 2006 debut Desert Doughnuts, however, Death of the Sun seems to have far fewer fingerprints on it than it actually does. On these nine tracks, Baim frequently sets her rich, transfixing vocals adrift into an uncertain near-silence, with the assembled musicians playing their instruments so lightly it can seem as though they're attempting to not startle a skittish herd of antelope. Despite the album's brief 30-minute running length, this ethereal production and somnambulant performance leaves the listener with the unshakable impression that Baim simply didn't have enough top-shelf material to yet sustain a full-length album. As it stands, Death of the Sun is two songs and nearly ten minutes finished before Baim conjures her first truly memorable melodic turn on ""Wounded Whale"", a hushed (natch) ecological lament that empties into the restrained psych-folk of the title track. Before the album can build upon this cautious momentum, Baim then digresses into a narcoleptic and completely superfluous version of the traditional ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"", which is the type of performance that might work magic when actually gathered around the fire at a desert campsite-- maybe-- but almost certainly nowhere else. Baim recovers nicely with the spooky, flittering vocal harmonies of ""Seven Stars"" and ""Who Loves"", yet even these lovely pieces can seem half-finished and almost weightlessly ephemeral, their gauzy melodies always tantalizingly out of reach. Baim and her group finally take the shackles off and turn the volume up slightly on the album closing ""Up is North"". Though it's still a far cry from grunge of any variant, the drums do at last provide a satisfying punch while reverberant acid guitar figures encircle Baim's wraith-like vocals, punctuating the album's submerged themes of loss and recovery. And while the moment lasts, Death of the Sun seems a valuable new refraction of the Metallic Falcons' ""soft metal"" soundscapes, one that perhaps can eventually inspire Matteah Baim to truly develop new genres worth naming.",,5.5,
Nu-Med,Balkan Beat Box,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16213d197565213a5f4/1:1/w_160/331df09a.jpg,2007-07-18 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10421-nu-med/,JDub,"That colorful jumble of instruments new and ancient, parachuting camels, Martian dirt, and bright banners on the cover of Nu-Med, the second album from Balkan Beat Box, is, to be perfectly honest, a really cheesy Photoshop job. But it is also apropos for an album that sounds like this: the band stirs klezmer, gypsy horns, surf, dub, Arab taqsim, hip-hop, funk, jazz, electro, circus music, and a few dozen other things together to make a raucous ethno/electro-acoustic gumbo that highlights the increasing inadequacy of the generic ""world music"" tag. Founded by drummer/programmer Tamir Muskat and woodwind player and former Gogol Bordello member Ori Kaplan, both originally from Israel, the band gleefully adds its name to the ever-lengthening list of groups drawing inspiration from Eastern European sounds while rigorously avoiding sounding traditional. The lyrics, on the songs that have them, are in several languages, reflecting the music's transcendence of borders. The instrumentals simply revel in the collision of genres, and are played with a jazzy looseness in spite of their programmed undercarriages. ""Quand Est-ce Qu'on Arrive?"" even includes a sly quotation from Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" that brings the album's primary theme to the fore without saying a word. The album's opening track, a collage of crowd noise, rhythmic vocalizations, and muffled beats, sends the listener in a few directions at once, with snatches of hip-hop and dancehall reggae ultimately getting overwhelmed by klezmer horns. ""Hermetico"" follows this up with an elastic beat, a strangely elegiac horn part, and MC Tamer Yosef robo-rapping through a processor, his flow clearly influenced by Jamaican dancehall. The band makes interesting use of most of the vocals on the album. ""Joro Boro"" pairs surf guitar with gypsy horns and Bulgarian vocalist Dessislava Stefanova, who is multi-tracked singing microtonal harmony with herself in the tradition of her country's women's choirs. Guest Dunia is also multi-tracked, as she sing-raps over dubbed-out horns on ""Habibi Min Zaman"", mixing straight flow with Middle Eastern melisma and fluttering ululations. The show is largely stolen from the vocals by the horns, though. The horn section on these songs includes as many as seven members on certain tracks, with a full complement of tubas, trumpets, flugelhorns, as well as woodwinds including saxophones and the occasional clarinet. It can be light and fluttering one moment, then thunderous and commanding the next. One could be forgiven for thinking that a big pile of different sounds from around the world would amount to nothing more than a mess, but in the uniting embrace of well-executed beats, it all comes together to form an enjoyable spectacle. The biggest problem with the album is its somewhat excessive length-- there are passages that are too repetitive that could have been trimmed-- but it amounts only to a small portion of a few songs. At it's best, it's a brilliant collision that connects-- and in some cases, as with Jewish music and surf, re-connects-- genres in a distinctly 21st Century way.","Founded by drummer/programmer Tamir Muskat and woodwind player and former Gogol Bordello member Ori Kaplan, Balkan Beat Box adds its name to the ever-lengthening list of groups drawing inspiration from Eastern European sounds while rigorously avoiding sounding traditional.

Lucas,Skeletons and the Kings of All Cities,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b166ea9e61561daa678a/1:1/w_160/51745f8b.jpg,2007-07-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10424-lucas/,Ghostly,"During the song ""Sickness"", on the latest record from Matt Mehlan's revolving ensemble musical project Skeletons and the Kings of All Cities, he sings a lyric that seems ironic when considering his own grandiosity: ""You got a bad case of the big ideas."" Lucas is, on its own terms, a colossal-feeling record, teeming with crowds of instrumentation and refusing to settle on any particular musical idea for more than a minute or so. Its source of inspiration, however, should clear things up a bit. The record is named for the small town of Lucas, Kansas, which is home to the Garden of Eden. No, Mehlan's not a Mormon with an off-kilter sense of geography-- this Garden is a purely American tourist attraction, an eccentric bit of outsider art built in the early 1900s and devoted to one man's screwy vision of Biblical lore. Some have said the Garden's creator Samuel Dinsmoor had ""dementia concretia,"" an affliction suffered by those who've worked all their lives, and, upon retirement, can't shake the itch to create, but don't have the occupational structure to rein themselves in. It's a ""sickness,"" sure, but one that occasionally results in some extraordinary work. As far as I can tell, Mehlan's not one of the afflicted, but that hasn't stopped him from welding together an impressive musical contraption of his own, bound by anecdotal tales of an awkward life apart. Through Lucas' tangled narrative, Dinsmoor and his creation feel like tangential characters, the equally misunderstood later-life counterparts of the unique-looking boy posing for the album cover. A lyric from ""Hay W'happns"" could come from either: ""I got pockets full of gravel, my knuckles are skinned/ I got a wall made outta marbles and you're not allowed in."" Later, the vertigo-inducing strings and squelches of ""Like it or Not"" underscore the record's trend toward the stifled sexuality of the teenage unconscious: ""Every day he falls in love with the gorgeous backsides of every girl he sets his eyes on/ Follows them home to catch a glimpse/ But they never, they never, they never turn around."" ""Fake Tits"" is one example of Lucas mapping inner turmoil on the body's exterior, explained at the beginning of the song when its instrumentation mirrors the unnerving clamor of an overactive and nervous imagination: ""I don't have that much trust in my body/ It's down deep on th' insides but worn like a novelty tee shirt."" The slick urbanity of Git (recorded with the now retired suffix ""and the Girl-Faced Boys"") is largely gone, yet the experimental spirit remains. Like OOIOO's Taiga, Lucas is an outsize global-a-go-go mélange of unceasing polyrhythms, Afrobeat guitars, free jazz, and Timbaland's approach to kitchen-sink percussion. On ""W'happns"", a skronky opening segment suggesting a prehistoric diorama roaring to life gives way to a loping rumble. Opener ""What They Said"" starts as a disquieting, hollow church revival of clapping and stomping-- an uptempo version of Radiohead's ""The Gloaming""-- before a luminous guitar emerges to guide the song to its conclusion, as the choir revels in the anachronistic provincial maxim to solitude ""It's different o'er there, they keeps it to themsel's."" The nearly soulful, soft ""Let it Out"" is the record's emotional reprieve, as Mehlan's distant quaver gives way to a falsetto: ""Hope needs you to believe in it, sugar/ Ain't no other way out"". The band clearly knows its strengths, and the record's highlight is smack in the middle. The opening fanfare of the 11-minute ""Don't Worry"" marries guitars that recall both Frank Zappa's and the Grateful Dead's mid-Seventies output with a clacking tribal rhythm and punchy brass, which wanes and reappears with Mehlan's vocals, growing more and more restless and frenetic as it progresses. The lyrics mark a turning point on Lucas as well-- the moment when the internal negotiations start to realize themselves tangibly. The chorus is a note of pragmatic hope, on the way to fulfilling the promise of the band's new name: ""Don't worry, we can pump water to anywhere/ Electricity, too"". Skeletons never really make clear whether Lucas' Garden is one created through aged anxiety, adolescent escape, or something somewhere in the middle. They shouldn't have to, of course, and the record benefits from an approach that performs the intriguing disobedience of both.","Leader Matt Mehlan's Girl-Faced Boys are now Kings of All Cities, and Lucas is a tangled tale of intriguing outsiders building a place of their own.

5 Years Get Physical,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1605e6ef95969322100/1:1/w_160/0b9009b7.jpg,2007-07-18 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10419-5-years-get-physical/,Get Physical,"For even moderately successful German dance labels, the arrival of anniversaries almost inevitably prompt orgiastic feats of naval-gazing, in turn prompting bemused onlookers to question whether growing up doesn't also mean growing old. The bigger the label, the more divisive the celebration, and Get Physical are bigger than most: The label that held dancers' hands on the journey from electro-house to minimal was facing a backlash long before its fifth birthday party arrived. Nonetheless it's difficult not to conclude that the roster that once could do no wrong (and by ""once"" I mean about two years ago) is inviting criticism with its latest double disc release. The first disc is devoted solely to a collection of (mostly) new remixes of past classics, with the interveners usually chosen on a favor-returning basis. This leads to some counter-intuitive results, like Hot Chip trying and inevitably failing to enhance one of M.A.N.D.Y.'s best electro-house stormers ""No Stoppin""-- someone should explain to Hot Chip that dancefloor destruction is not as easy as their own remixers make it seem. With ring-ins such as Herbert, the Rapture, Moby, Señor Coconut, and Fujiya & Miyagi, the remix disc resembles a friends list on a MySpace page, more intent on demonstrating the label's diverse following and interconnectedness than on actually delivering results. In fact the collection isn't as painful as that list might suggest (even Moby only manages to bore with his wafting prog-house take on Djuma Soundsystem's ""Les Djinns"") but the often ridiculously eclectic transformations (Tropicália! Post-punk! Indie-rock!) of formerly streamlined instrumental dancefloor tracks seems at once calculating and ill-considered-- who could possibly want to hear all of them? The Larry Gold String Version of Booka Shade's ""Night Falls"" forms the disc's hubristic peak: a strings-only reproduction, its Faze Action-style disco classicism is undermined by a pervading air of pointlessness. The mistake being made here is to assume that, because Get Physical are feted for their anthems, it's the tunes that are important, and that listeners will want to hear the key melodic motifs of these tracks in a dozen different styles. In fact, what has always made Get Physical appealing is the music's superlative sound design, transforming rather conventional grooves into dazzling, widescreen soundscapes-- and at least initially this was largely due to the sonic fingerprints of in-house producers Booka Shade, who ensured that nearly every release shared the same full-bodied, luminescent glow. By outsourcing the grooves to such a disparate array of producers, this remix collection's main achievement is to ensure that this sound design, this aura of luxuriant perfection, is rarely in evidence (ironically, Henrik Schwarz, one of a very few artists whose baroque production touches could have worked magic on Get Physical's sonic blueprint, offers the disc's most understated and loyal remix, a murky dub of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo""). The second disc of exclusive new tracks is better, but surprisingly strives for understatement. Most of the inclusions cleave to a muted sound somewhere between electro, minimal and deep house: a fertile valley to be sure, but one which is left curiously uncultivated despite the artists' high production values, with lush house warmth or melodic melodrama largely jettisoned in favor of insectile production nuances, grayscale synth pads and self-conscious old skool signifiers. At its best, this approach produces quietly compelling grooves such as Audiofly X's ""Don't Panic 'Til I Said So"", a softly shuddering piece somewhere between the glistening dub-house of early Force Tracks and the Berlin-Detroit rendezvous of recent Mobilee releases. Elsewhere, on tracks like Riton vs Heidi's ""To The Gum"" or DJ T's ""Once in a Lifetime"", the effect is a slightly grim sense of restraint. Even the reliable Chelonis R. Jones marries his excellent Sartre-in-drag monologue to an unnecessarily dry house groove. The album's most inviting moments are a reminder of just how great this label can be: Lopazz's paranoid ""The Fact"" is gorgeously dark, endlessly hummable italo-techno that is unafraid to seize the pop jugular, perhaps because its cruel bass heft would silence any accusations of selling out. Even more radically, M.A.N.D.Y vs Booka Shade's ""Oh Superman"" is a gloriously straightforward and ecstatic remix of the Laurie Anderson classic, its key insight being that Laurie's repeated ""Huh huh huh"" makes for a fantastic dancefloor riff. The remix dates back to 2004, back when the sonic superiority of the label's aesthetic was so self-evident that there was no need not to be obvious. By contrast, the diversity of this collection's remixes, together with the terse self-containment of so many of its exclusives, suggest that the label is suffering from a momentary lapse of confidence in its own identity, chasing after stylistic rainbows while simultaneously sucking in its stomach in a bid to appear cutting edge. But the endless quest for relevance is not really Get Physical's main challenge at this stage. Having parked itself firmly on the invisible line between house and techno, the label can easily latch onto whichever trend flits closest, like a spider at the center of a vast web of interwoven scenes and sounds. The real challenge is for these artists to live up to their own past: Having been responsible for so many groundbreaking anthems in such a short timespan, it would be ignominious for the label to simply become a second Poker Flat, each year churning out a healthy modicum of quality product in the form of ""this year's model,"" but never sounding hungry, let alone dangerous. Surprise and excitement, rather than relevance, is what we loved them for: Let's hope that these aren't set aside along with other childish things.","German dance label Get Physical-- which helped usher this decade's move from electro-house to minimal-- celebrates its fifth anniversary with a 2xCD set-- one of new tracks from the label roster and the other a set of remixes, including efforts by Herbert, the Rapture, Moby, Señor Coconut, and Fujiya & Miyagi.

An End Has a Start,Editors,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b115ea9e61561daa670f/1:1/w_160/b6c2cd01.jpg,2007-07-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10352-an-end-has-a-start/,Fader,"Somehow, despite shilling hand-me-down post-punk in platinum-selling quantities to both Europe and the U.S., Birmingham's Editors have kept a low profile throughout indie's revivalist witch hunt. While the mere mention of the Killers, Kaiser Chiefs, or the Bravery incites your average post-punk/New Wave purists to grab their torches and pitchforks (pun intended), Editors' widespread fame and genre piggybacking is often met with a sigh and shrugged shoulders, an odd moment of tolerance and civility amidst the Lord of the Flies behavioral patterns exhibited towards their contemporaries. So I insert An End Has a Start into my computer, ready to expose their failings to cyberspace, pausing only to giggle at the LP's cornball title, when a funny thing happens: their songs don't totally suck. Like their debut The Back Room, the band's sophomore effort gets good mileage out of worn-out ideas, hoping to fiddle with heartstrings effectively enough to distract listeners from its myriad shortcomings. Frontman Tom Smith still channels Ian Curtis' dour spirit pretty shamelessly, but on songs like ""Bones"" or the title track he manages the occasional hook to raise up the crumbling wall of sound erected by his bandmates. A theatrical streak runs through An End, and it's about the only distinguishing quality between their two albums-- a pretty amazing feat considering how bloated Editors already sounded on The Back Room. If Smith could dislodge the frog in his throat, he'd be a dead ringer for Bono on life-affirming motivational numbers like ""Push Your Head Towards the Air"" and single ""Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors"", a stark contrast to their more fidgety (and less wordy) previous singles ""Bullets"" and ""Munich"". If only the band could better foster the instrumental bite heard in ""Escape the Nest""'s stratospheric guitar riff or the ""I Will Follow""-inspired lick that kicks off ""Bones"", the heaps of sap would be easier to stomach. Instead, Smith's emoting tells but doesn't show, eschewing the impressionism of his favorite bands in favor of protracted ballads and heart-on-sleeve lyrics crammed asses-to-elbows in choruses too small to hold them. On ""The Weight of the World"", perhaps the album's histrionic pinnacle, Smith resorts to the sort of sweet nothings found in a prom's closing song: ""There are tears in my eyes/ Love replaces fear/ Every little piece in your life/ Will add up to one/ Every little piece in your life/ Will mean something to someone."" It's a shame that premature commercial success has sullied Editors' creativity, because An End contains its share of bright spots. However, that ""weight"" Smith is feeling probably stems from a sudden need to bolster the band's sound proportionately with their massive fame, a move that a group like the Arcade Fire could pull off on a follow-up album, but not a Joy Division/Interpol/U2 cut-and-paste effort like Editors. In a perfect world, these guys would never escape the shadow cast over them by their predecessors, but they could at least do more than compromise them with mass-marketable bombast and arena posturing.","Big-selling post-punk revivalists from Birmingham, England return with a more theatrical second album, their sound sometimes approaching the arena-filling grandeur of U2.

Rise to Your Knees,Meat Puppets,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17713d197565213a60d/1:1/w_160/22567b94.jpg,2007-07-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10440-rise-to-your-knees/,Anodyne,"Along with friends and contemporaries the Minutemen, the Meat Puppets remain one of the most interesting and inspiring anomalies to emerge from the U.S. hardcore scene. The band's crooked path to alternative rock almost-stardom is well-documented, but their stylistic singularity and influence still remain largely underacknowledged. No other records before or since sound exactly like II or Up on the Sun; hazy and laid back but staggeringly tight and impeccably arranged. Guitarist Curt Kirkwood's intricate, handpicked style can be heard today in the multilayered playing of Oxford Collapse's Mike Pace, among many others. Unfortunately, the Meat Puppets have been best known as of late for the tragic misadventures of erstwhile Kirkwood brother Cris. The fact that this record was made at all is pretty amazing; the fact that it's not half bad even more so. The Meat Puppets have never been a band to stray too far from what they do best; with the exception of the sea change between their eponymous debut and their masterpiece II, the band's stylistic development has been gradual, sometimes to the point of stagnation. Rise to Your Knees strikes a fairly comfortable balance between the spare, spritely Meat Puppets of yore and the more polished and forceful Meat Puppets of the mid-1990s. The most pleasing moments on Rise to Your Knees often arise from the simple charm of its melodies; the instrumentation here is far from the propulsive intricacy of the Puppets' best work. Generally speaking, the choruses on Rise far outshine the meandering verses, as the band snaps into a more simple and straightforward groove that highlights the trademark Kirkwood drawl. And sure enough, time has proven surprisingly flattering to the brothers' voices, which come through rich and satisfying throughout. By the first chorus of standout track ""On the Rise"", it's clear that the Puppets' charms have remained intact, even if their new songs come up a bit short. With the exception of the baffling 311-esque ""Enemy Love Song"", there are very clunkers to be found here. On songs like the excellent ""Disappear"", the brothers Kirkwood actually find their way back some of the tight and propulsive guitar and bass interplay that marks the Puppets' best work. For the most part, though, the songs on Rise are hazy and unremarkable. As with most of the Meat Puppets' lesser records, this one is easy to space out to-- all dense harmonies, psychedelic guitars and unwavering drum beats-- but often fails to really capitalize on the band's unique strengths. As was the case with Dinosaur Jr's recent Beyond, Rise to Your Knees is an interesting reminder that the specific musical thread started by this band hasn't been fully picked up since; though a far cry from their strongest records, Rise finds the Meat Puppets thereofre sounding somewhat fresh. It follows, then, that this doesn't quite come off as a ""comeback"" album, but rather a middling addition to a prolific and distinctive catalog. As the title suggests, Rise to Your Knees isn't so much a glorious resurgence as a humble but definitive step towards recovery.","This unlikely comeback album strikes a fairly comfortable balance between the spare, spritely Meat Puppets of yore and the more polished and forceful Meat Puppets of the mid-1990s.

Dance Positive,Karl Blau,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16b5e6ef95969322114/1:1/w_160/237d60ab.jpg,2007-07-17 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10430-dance-positive/,Marriage,"Before even considering his music, you gotta love Karl Blau. The guy practically tells the online music scene to fuck itself with Kelp Monthly, a service in which every 30 days, via snail mail, subscribers receive another eclectic nugget of Blau's creativity, ranging from collaborations with fellow D+ (and ex-Beat Happening) members Bret Lunsford and Phil Elvrum to 12"" field recordings of crickets chirping. Give one of his releases a spin, and you'll appreciate more than just his grass-roots ethos. Picking up where his previous full-length Beneath Waves left off, Dance Positive features Blau putting his unique spin on 10 D+ songs penned by Lunsford, running them through a gauntlet of stylistic and experimental mettle. While here Blau alludes to dance music both in the album's title and its heightened sense of rhythm, these Lunsford ditties carry too much of Blau's lo-fi, Pacific Northwest musk to constitute a full-blown reinvention--especially for a guy so typically all over the map like Blau. While his vocals still possess that signature sylvan stoicism, Blau isn't afraid to put down the granola and venture onto the dance floor. ""Put Me Back"" glides over a pulsating synth line that overpowers its hissy accompaniment, while ""What's Not To Fall in Love With"" backs up its cocksure title with spastic drum machine blips and a suave delivery. The newfound swing in Blau's step espouses him with similarly glitchy, yet catchy, genre-hoppers like Caribou or Four Tet, as opposed to the poor man's Odelay some of his prior records settled for. ""The Business"" renders any presumable music industry commentary moot as silky power chords and tinny harmonics drown out Blau's near-whisper. Although heady psyche sprinkles every track here to some extent, ""Heatherwood"" blows the lid off, jamming on a space-age Hawkwind bassline and eerie horn parts. However, as the voracious music epicurean he is, Blau tends to snack so quickly through genres that the listener sometimes can't appreciate the flavor. Dance Positive lacks a stud track, just as Blau's discography lacks a landmark album conveniently encapsulating his canon, and there's really nothing wrong with that. Basically, the guy writes songs from the brain, not the gut, and while nothing here elicits a tear or two-step, Dance Positive is a nearly unlimited supply of cerebral candy you never grow sick on.","Picking up where his previous full-length Beneath Waves left off, Dance Positive features Blau putting his unique spin on 10 D+ songs penned by Bret Lunsford, running them through a gauntlet of stylistic and experimental mettle.

Keep Reachin' Up,Nicole Willis & the Soul Investigators,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15f9d034d5c69bf49ee/1:1/w_160/18f1e634.jpg,2007-07-17 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10418-keep-reachin-up/,Light in the Attic,"My knee-jerk reaction to the music on Keep Reachin' Up is to call it retro soul, and to a degree, that's quite accurate. It's soul music with classic-sounding arrangements and production, but the maturity of the compositions and the ingenuity of the string orchestrations that adorn several of the songs make the retro tag feel unnecessary. Really, this is just plain good soul music that touches signposts from New Orleans to Memphis to Philly to Detroit. This is solo joint #3 for Willis, who spent much of the 90s dropping guest vocals for The The, Deee-lite, Leftfield and other acts. She has a classic soul voice, sweet and cool but capable of rising up for a good wail when the song needs it. Where, for me, her first two records suffered a bit from their sound, this move to raw, funky immediacy and old-school economy works beautifully and lets her voice fulfill its potential. The Soul Investigators, who are largely responsible for the shift, hail from the soul Mecca of Finland, as does the Pekka Kuusisto String Orchestra, which injects a flash of silver into some of the records' darkest corners. The Soul Investigators must live and breathe old soul and funk 45s, because they've internalized all of the tropes and elements of the music to the point where they're able to invent new things with them. Drummer Jukka Sarapää holds a steady groove the whole way through, and the guitar, bass, and organ leave lots of room for Willis and the horn section, which includes Willis' husband, Jimi Tenor, on several songs. The record's opening salvo, the exuberant ""Feeling Free"", is sublime, building a driving beat around a repeated pizzicato string figure. ""I'm lovin' this music/ I'm feelin' free,"" sings Willis on the swirling chorus-it's a well-traveled ""weekend is for parties"" theme, but Willis, who writes all her own lyrics, puts a nice spin on it. The opener's ebullience is miles away from the epic waltz that lies near the album's other end. ""No One's Gonna Love You"" kicks off with a tipsy, palm-muted guitar part that drags you down into a sweaty, organ-soaked underworld, where Willis is menaced by the orchestra, which stalks the arrangement like her estranged lover haunts her thoughts. The chorus splits the song wide open with thunderclap drums, dramatic backing vocals and swelling horns. The song sounds like romantic turmoil feels. Most of the rest of the record is more in tune with its free-spirited beginning. ""If This Ain't Love (Don't Know What Is)"" strips the Motown sound to its essential elements, with the snare drum hitting every beat, but the heavily echoplexed flute solo, played by Tenor, injects a dose of psychedelia when you least expect it. Willis forms her own vocal jazz ensemble through overdubs on ""Blues Downtown"", while the horns get down with the slinky groove and slashing, noir guitar. Engineer/producer Didier Selin deserved a lot of credit for getting such a rich, three-dimensional sound out of the band. There are a few low ebbs: The instrumental ""Soul Investigators Theme"" plays like a backing track without the vocal, and the title track sacrifices the tune in favor of a funky groove, and hits one passage where it sounds like a skipping record-dig the drum break and horn arrangement, though. These minor transgressions are hardly worth talking about in light of how strong the record is on the whole, however, and Willis has snatched a solid position in the soul revival world. If I were to make a direct comparison, I might position her as the Martha Reeves to Sharon Jones' Irma Thomas, though that comparison is a bit too facile. In the end, it goes back to what I said at the top: This is just good soul music.","Third solo album for a singer who spent much of the 90s dropping guest vocals for The The, Deee-lite, Leftfield and other acts, and it's soul music with decidedly classic-sounding arrangements and production, mature compositions, and ingenius string orchestration.

New Waves EP,The Tough Alliance,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16a13d197565213a5fb/1:1/w_160/d23e4641.jpg,2007-07-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10429-new-waves-ep/,Sincerely YoursSincerely Yours,"Henning Fürst and Eric Berglund aren't ""real"" pop stars; they just play them in Sweden. As electronic pop duo the Tough Alliance, Fürst and Berglund perform their live shows without instruments, committing the ultimate rock heresy of dancing and miming to pre-recorded tracks. (Just ask the Knife. Or Milli Vanilli.) The tracks themselves seem to aspire to platinum status, matching shiny digital beats to vaguely tropical synths, sugar-sweet melodies, and cryptic yet simple lyrics that often involve romance. If you weren't paying attention, you might think they had more in common with Ace of Base than with other Gothenburg-born groups such as the Knife or Love Is All. Like Malcolm McLaren or the KLF, though, the Tough Alliance spike their pop with Situationist politics, sometimes to a point where it's difficult to separate the music from the group's broader arsenal of cultural weaponry. Fürst and Berglund certainly don't; as with Tony Wilson's Factory Records, their Sincerely Yours imprint (Air France, the Honeydrips) assigns a catalog number to everything from promo videos to bottles of wine. ""A way to escape or a way to wage war?"" they asked in Yours000, the first post on the label's website. The New Waves EP-- released last year in Europe and now finally available in North America via Summer Lovers Unlimited-- is probably both. The disc represents a step forward from the inexperienced shoutiness of neverthelesss promising 2005 debut The New School, though at only four tracks New Waves inevitably feels slight next to new full-length A New Chance (which Summer Lovers Unlimited also hopes to bring to these shores eventually). The bright synths, dubby drum loops, and wistful lyrics of ""Silly Crimes"" make it a clear standout-- the kind of track it's hard to believe isn't on a proper album. With just a few words and a cheesy spring break vibe, the song manages to be fragile and emotionally rewarding without affecting the trappings of seriousness, as so many current indie spoilsports do. Even a rare precious line like ""wasting love, ennobling hate"" is surrounded by those purring bird-call synth noises. The EP begins on a more confrontational note: ""Kill this compromise,"" a voice repeats through Daft Punk-like vocoder on ""Kill Kill Kill"", basically a song fragment. The lyric will recur on *The New School'*s ""Babylon"". A more substantial testament to the Tough Alliance's unique vision is ""25 Years and Runnin'"", which imagines a life spent looking for a home while forever unable to shake some deep-seated inner woe. Vivid melodies and globetrotting lyrics pull a yearning pop victory from the jaws of Eurodance synths, 4x4 beats, some oddly Caribbean-style percussion, and crazed sound effects: ""Now I know that New York is where a boy can have some fun/ If I only could change where I came from."" Cheeky finale ""Mine Was Real"" covers the heartbreaking 1970 soul classic by Rozetta Johnson, adding the duo's wall-of-can-sound production but seeming to lose none of the original's sincerity. Now that's what I call détournement. In keeping with the Tough Alliance's multimedia tactics, New Waves comes with a pair of videos. The clip for ""Silly Crimes"", called ""Simple Games"", shows girls jumping rope in the sun-dappled outdoors and in front of a film projection (a recurring visual motif of theirs) of splashing waves; its unbridled innocence leaves me wondering what darker subtext might or might not be lurking beneath. ""25 Summers and Runnin'"", the video for ""25 Years and Runnin'"", also encourages further scrutiny despite a somewhat more jumbled appearance, as a simple negative image of a running man is superimposed above shots of tennis players, migrating geese, and Tough Alliance gigs. If the duo's full political intentions aren't necessarily clear at the end of the EP, their musical ones are: Fürst and Berglund are a couple of punk-minded provocateurs who play pop not for camp value or hipster irony, but because it's the purest form of expression a boy has left.","Swedish pop band spikes its shiny digital beats to vaguely tropical synths, sugar-sweet melodies, and-- like a modern-day Malcolm McLaren or KLF-- Situationist politics, so much so that it's difficult to separate the music from the group's broader arsenal of cultural weaponry

"The Singles, Volume Three: 1964-1965",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15cea9e61561daa677d/1:1/w_160/0e3475c2.jpg,2007-07-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10415-the-singles-volume-three-1964-1965/,Hip-O Select,"As useful as completist reissue projects are, they inevitably run into some stuff that shouldn't have been issued in the first place. James Brown spent the better part of 1964 and 1965 playing chicken with King Records-- trying to get out of his contract, recording for rival label Smash, and continuing to tour on the back of his older hits and the random crap from the vaults that King kept tossing onto the market as singles. This will almost certainly be the weakest volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only complete-JB-singles series, just because its historical context yielded so much barrel-scraping. It also includes three of Brown's biggest hits, including at least one song that pretty much transformed all pop music after it, so that weakness is relative. Still, of the 36 A- and B-sides here, more than half actually predate 1964: Brown didn't hand over any new material to King for the first year and a half of the two years this two-disc set covers. Four tracks are edited, sometimes drastically, from the epochal 1962 gig that became the hit Live at the Apollo LP-- ""Think"" is slowed down almost 20% in order to hit the two-minute mark, an unfortunate antecedent of the chopped-and-screwed sound--and the eight-year-old ""Please, Please, Please"" is (totally unconvincingly) overdubbed with screaming fans to sound live. So is a lackadaisical cover of Louis Jordan's ""Caldonia"" that became Brown's first single on Smash; discovering that it ran only 2:07, Brown apparently decided to make it more radio-worthy by appending a little more crowd noise, then repeating its final 30 seconds. He scored one solid hit on Smash: the double A-side ""Out of Sight"" and ""Maybe the Last Time"", a proto-funk look toward the future and a hard-gospel wave toward the past. (The title of ""Maybe the Last Time"" was fitting: it was the final big single to prominently feature the Famous Flames on backing vocals, even though they weren't credited.) In response, King's boss Syd Nathan sued his star for breach of contract. The legal resolution was that Brown was still under contract to King for vocal recordings, but could record instrumentals for Smash. That gave Brown an excuse to cut a bunch of instrumentals that featured him playing organ with his band. He's legendary for his self-regard, of course, but releasing his organ solos as singles actually crossed the line into vanity. Fortunately, in mid-1965, King and Brown settled their differences, and Soul Brother #1, in turn, finally stopped dicking around. ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", the first fruit of the détente, singlehandedly invented funk: it's more space than sound. (It's hard to beat Dave Marsh's description: ""The only way ['Papa'] could be more bone-rattling would be if James Brown himself leaped from your speakers, grabbed you tight by the shoulders and danced you around the room, all the while screaming straight into your face."") He followed that up with ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"", and as hard as it is to hear that song now that it's become the soundtrack to an audio-animatronic James Brown doll, the single grinning tune that stands in for a raging 50-year career, it's still a hell of a record. With that left-right combination, his career pulled out of its two-year mire, and his mightiest decade got underway.","Latest volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only complete-JB-singles series consists of both barrel-scraping and three of Brown's biggest hits, including at least one song that pretty much transformed all pop music after it.

UFOs at the Zoo: The Legendary Concert in Oklahoma City,The Flaming Lips,by: Stephen M. Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1735e6ef95969322122/1:1/w_160/4f339c42.jpg,2007-07-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10437-ufos-at-the-zoo-the-legendary-concert-in-oklahoma-city/,Warner Bros.,"The Flaming Lips' first live document features a gigantic UFO, an army of fans in alien and Santa costumes, streamers, strobes, smoke machines, balloons, and massive amounts of confetti-- and that's just the first song. Most bands build up to this sort of explosive spectacle, but for the Lips, it's a starting point. Their shows are as much about spectacle as they are about music, which explains the hybrid technology on UFOs at the Zoo: The Legendary Concert in Oklahoma City. This document, which is neither simply an album nor simply a concert film, is being issued as an MVI album, which means it plays on DVD players but not CD players, and contains bonus digital material. In other words, it presents the visual and the musical with equal emphasis, but will likely be outdated before the second-gen iPhone is out. But for now, UFOs at the Zoo is about as close as you can get to the controlled chaos of a Lips show without actually buying tickets. The opening segment features shots of fans in a bacchanalian frenzy intercut with clips of zoo animals looking curious, dignified, and quiet. It's a nifty joke that goes on about a minute too long, creating a you-are-there mix of suspense and impatience. Pretty soon Steve Drozd, Michael Ivins, and surrogate drummer Kliph Scurlock descend from underneath the UFO, and Wayne Coyne appears in a giant bubble, which he takes into the crowd for a tremendous feat of crowd-surfing. What follows is half-party, half-rave, half-freak-out-- which is one too many halves but speaks to the maximalism of the show. There's the by-now traditional nun puppet, the mechanical bird that Coyne flies around stage like he's a child making airplane noises, a megaphone that spews dense smoke, and a mic-mounted camera that gets you a little too close to his beard. Of course, this would all be obnoxious if the music wasn't part of the equation, if it suffered even the slightest. But the Lips are in their element on stage, and even the creakiest musical idea sounds persuasive broadcasting across a sea of spastic bodies. Songs from the lackluster At War With the Mystics sound good in this setting: ""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"" might have been written explicitly for the sort of crowd participation Coyne uses it for, and ""Vein of Stars"" possesses a cosmic curiosity under the dark Oklahoma sky. Still, the old material got the band and the crowd moving more happily, especially ""Love Yer Brain"" (from 1987's Oh My Gawd!!!...the Flaming Lips), which makes an especially triumphant closer. There's an enthusiastic DIY quality to these proceedings: all the effects, whether musical or visual, are homemade, usually held together by duct tape and crossed fingers. Drozd's arsenal of instruments and equipment looks like he built everything himself, and to his credit, he probably did. The gigantic spaceship, which Coyne allegedly built in his backyard and which rises vertically to form a stage backdrop, is obviously a tinkered-with contraption, and in between-song footage, several stagehands wonder aloud whether it will fall and kill the band. This is a homegrown version of the arena rock show, slyly subversive of mainstream pyrotechnics and much more invested. The band-- especially Coyne-- appear genuinely pleased with their gimcrackery and excited to watch the crowd's reaction to each and every balloon burst and confetti explosion. When Coyne tells the crowd they're the best audience in the world and then explains that he really means it, it's obvious he really means it. The Lips' affection for their fans comes across as neither forced nor commercially motivated, and UFOs at the Zoo is the endearing chronicle of the obsessiveness of the musicians as well as of their fans. Short documentary-style interstitials interview hardcore fans who have traveled from all over the country, some in full costume (my favorite was the girl in the nun costume, who needed a Wayne Coyne puppet), others trying to check fake blood in their carry-ons (3-oz. containers, dude), and one working out ""The Sound of Failure"" on acoustic guitar. They comprise a joyous throng whose excitement seems barely contained, even when it's intensified by dope or booze. And Coyne presides over it with a kind of hippie benevolence that allows room for some realistic-to-the-point-of-pessimistic philosophies about life and music. When he and the band finally leave the stage, the camera settles on the crowd, who mill about the amphitheatre, reluctant to leave the spectacle behind.","The Flaming Lips' first live document.

Really? There has to be some sort of self-aware unrealness quotient behind the choice of that name, in which the palest of condiments (to the extent it was a punchline on ego trip's ""The (White) Rapper Show"") is slathered over decades of hip-hop tradition. You might be relieved to know that the Anticon producer and ostensible wheels-of-steelsman doesn't get that shticky, but his lack of a shtick is precluded by the lack of anything else in his music that might be considered a personality or a vision. Still Alive is Mayo's first solo record since 1999's 55 Stories, and time's progressed a lot more than his aesthetic has. You ever heard any indie rap that doesn't crib its production template directly from Pete Rock? Good, there won't be any need to talk you down from what might otherwise be a severe panic attack. After all, some of the beats on Still Alive are a bit eerie and downtempo and have static crackling over them, so you might feel a little creeped out if you somehow missed DJ Shadow and Massive Attack and Boards of Canada and Tricky and the 1990s in general. The warmed-over atmosphere of Still Alive is going to be familiar-- maybe painfully so-- to anyone who ever came within squinting distance of a MoWax comp or knows at least two Luke Vibert aliases, and if there's anything here that works, it works in the exact same way every aforementioned artist (except, OK, maybe Pete Rock) has worked in the past. So: opener ""Post Reformat"" galumphs along with flatulent synth-bass and Blue Man Group percussion, with the only vibrant element-- a brief, solitary pair of guitar notes-- coming at just past the three-minute mark. (Enjoy them while you can; they're immediately followed by some muddy, scraped-up vocal hook that sounds like Bugs Bunny imitating Milk D from Audio Two; what he's actually saying is anyone's guess.) ""The Windham Song"" is a promising idea gone sour, Southwestern desert noir funk with neon hums and a Robert Rodriguez-ready guitar undercut by an unfocused rhythmic momentum and a goopy Skinemax saxophone. ""Munjoy Moments"" is the requisite slab of indie-pop-meets-electro mush, with tinkling synthetic chimes that make it too precious to pop/lock/roll and a crusty, pigeonshit bassline rendering it too abrasive to be beautiful. And the one track with actual rapping on it, ""Strateegery"", features K-the-I??? cracking Dubya snaps too hackneyed for ""Lil' Bush"" and dropping first-draft bumper sticker phrases (""I salute the brave new world order""; ""Not me voting for the lesser of two evils"") that Mr. Lif would've tossed out at age 16. DJ Mayonnaise's website features a telling origin story, where the Anticon member later known as Alias shames a school-age Mayo for being big into Guy. That could be why Still Alive doesn't have any life in its rhythm -- even if Mayo spent the subsequent years learning the benefits of hip-hop, his music shows that he's spent even more time worrying about how to avoid the temptations of pop futurism. If the price you pay for ditching new jack swing is a discography filled with grooveless stasis, make mine Teddy Riley. And hold the Miracle Whip.","First solo album in eight years from the Maine producer brings back the sound of the trip-hopping 90s.

Especially since acclaimed outfits like Soulwax, the DFA, Teifschwarz, and Vitalic-- not to mention the entire electroclash scene-- have already for years propagated some of the same ideas now championed by Daft Punk-loving dance labels Kitsuné and Ed Banger. This shit isn't supposed to be novel, just really fucking good. A quick recap: Justice show no mercy; Simian Mobile Disco aim to please; and on the summer's third high-profile indie-dance debut, Hamburg duo Digitalism turn out to be the artists probably most dedicated of all to the idea of merging rock and electronic dance music. Unfortunately, such purity of vision works better in concept than on the group's first full-length, Idealism. Digitalism's first actual release, a re-edit of the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"", helped them become the inaugural Kitsuné signees. A series of 12"" singles followed, and the A-sides recur here in slightly edited form. Choked with heavy compression, these tracks show Digitalism making their Korg synthesizers and 900-MHz PC act like rock instruments, though without Justice's violent distortion. ""Zdarlight"" spreads repetitive filter-disco synths over nearly six minutes, climaxing after the beat drops out nearly halfway through (and the Air-y bass drops in). ""Idealistic"" puts lo-fi, Rapture-esque vocals-- ""I had the idea that you were near""-- atop similar electro-house pulses and guitar-like squiggles. ""Jupiter Room"", issued on Kitsuné Maison 3 in a ""Martian Assault"" version, sends French touch to Europa. Or is it Io, the one with the volcanoes? Idealism's house-rock cross-fertilization goes both ways. Overcoming their rudimentary instrumental skills via sampler, Digitalism give newest single (and album highlight) ""Pogo"" a New Order-worthy guitar riff, live drums, and whirring pop-ambient loops recalling Swedish savant the Field. ""Digitalism in Cairo"" dismembers the Cure's ""Fire in Cairo"" for a dizzying, bass-heavy almost-banger. But other rock-leaning tracks such as ""I Want I Want"" or ""Anything New"" wind up sounding like Brooklyn dance-punk fallout given a haphazard Klaxons remix. Even unabashed softies the Postal Service would blush at the heart-on-sleeve lap-pop of ""Apollo-Gize"". Despite strong if not earth-shattering singles, Idealism falters when expanding its house-rock, rock-house devotion to 15-track album. There's a tenuous story involving trips to Cairo and outer space, but that can't justify weak interludes like ""Departure from Cairo"" or ""Jupiter Approach"". The robot romance of ""Moonlight"" and ""Echoes"" falls flat beside the better tracks here-- or elsewhere in their burgeoning genre, whatever you want to call it. ""I have the biggest party ever at home,"" Digitalism brag over malevolent synths on ""Home Zone"". They're totally joking, but that doesn't make it true.","After a spate of singles, including early releases on Daft Punk-loving French imprint Kitsuné, this Hamburg house-rock duo pulls together work new and old for their first album.

Efdemin,Efdemin,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b157b1335d7bf169a272/1:1/w_160/7f18dade.jpg,2007-07-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10411-efdemin/,Dial,"The first time I visited Cologne, I suddenly understood where all those bell tones in Superpitcher's music came from: The city turned out to be full of cathedrals, and the steeple looming over my bedroom chimed a Gothic version of Kompakt's dreamy ambient shuffle every hour, on the hour. By this logic, Hamburg must be thick with bell towers, because virtually every release on the city's Dial label-best known until now for anchor tenants Lawrence and Pantha du Prince-thrums with brassy clangor. The debut album from Efdemin-- aka Phillip Sollmann, who is also a member of the duo Pigon-- takes this tendency further than ever, reveling in the swift attack, fat decay, and lingering tail of struck instruments, whether real or synthesized. (It's strange and somehow charming that a record so subtle and, in many places, so soothing, could depend so heavily on such relentless percussive battery-- but then, the piano is a percussive instrument as well, and Erik Satie, whose fondness for blurry aftermath is all over this lush, resonant album, didn't exactly make heavy music.) Suffusing nimble, minimal-house constructions with melancholic melodies and counterpoints, Efdemin hammers on virtually every chime on the rack: glockenspiel, vibraphone, church bell, doorbell, squelchy 303 clone and other, more fanciful and definitely synthetic sounds, like the subaquatic anvil and the Berghain alarm clock. I'd assumed that most of Efdemin's sounds were the products of FM synthesis, a form of digital synthesis that throws off overtone halos around every note. (The Knife made quite a big deal about FM synthesis when they released Silent Shout; you can hear its telltale shimmer in the steel drums of ""The Captain"" and the mallet-like chimes of ""From Off to On"", both from that record.) But it turns out that that's not the case: Sollmann told me that the opening track is sourced from field recordings in Vienna, where the MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) is covered in grey basalt tiles that make a muted sound when struck. With that in mind, the track's title, ""Knocking at the Grand"", makes perfect sense: he's literally knocking at what must be the grandest mallet instrument in the world. Seventy-two minutes long, the album never strains; it passes in a rose-tinted blur. That Sollmann plies many of the same ideas again and again is no criticism. Just as a rock band in the pocket settles upon its ideal means of treating, voicing and arranging a lineup of guitar, bass, drums, vox and whatever else they might throw into the mix, Sollmann has figured out a format that works time and again, offering plenty of opportunity for both timbral experiments and plain-old songwriting panache. Two tracks in particular prove highlights, however. ""Lohn und Brot"", first released as part of a split 12-inch single by the Liebe*Detail label (and previously covered in Forkcast), is an expansive, eight-minute wonder, slathered in shimmering chimes and as moody as your life. Acting like a perpetual motion machine, it seems to generate its own energy from the friction between its many contrapuntal melodies, and when the synths flare up at the song's climax, it feels like the heavens themselves are opening wide. ""Acid Bells"" is something else entirely: practically goth in its brooding, the song layers syncopated bell tones over an understated pulse of kick drum, brushed hi-hats and little else. Sollmann spends the first half of the song winding up a crescendo of sturm und klang; for the second half, everything unwinds as modulating delay snaps the real-time tethers and sends everything spinning into a dizzy, detuned din. Urgent and angry, it maps a space precisely opposite ""Knocking at the Grand"", knocking over that tune's architectural grounding and giving itself up to tempests from on high. Even moreso than the Field's recent album for Kompakt, Efdemin's debut album is a one-way ticket to the sublime.","Debut solo album from Phillip Sollmann-- who is also a member of the duo Pigon-- revels in the swift attack, fat decay, and lingering tail of struck instruments, whether real or synthesized.

Saturday Night Fever,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b168c0084474cd0c1de8/1:1/w_160/22baa05d.jpg,2007-07-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10428-saturday-night-fever/,RhinoRSORhinoRSO,"Disco's most popular document was, at the time of its release, also one of its least representative: Saturday Night Fever is disco for straight, white males. A phenomenon 30 years ago, John Badham's B-movie and its accompanying 2xLP soundtrack not only made John Travolta a star, but escorted the music out of gay discotheques and black nightclubs and into the glare of the mainstream. However, it did so by diluting disco's more extreme elements to create a safer, more marketable package. Even then, conservative audiences saw disco culture as a Sodom and Gomorrah rather than an alternative Eden. The recent surge of interest in the era-- specifically in Peter Shapiro's excellent history Turn the Beat Around, but also demonstrated by groups like Scissor Sisters and Franz Ferdinand-- only sets disco's outsider nature, as well as this collection's shortcomings, in sharper relief. The movie itself is seedy in a different way (rape, bigotry, death), but as film critic David Thompson writes, ""Children ignored its...sordid suburban context. That film only existed when Travolta danced."" In addition to his extraordinary dance moves, the actor's edgy, preening presence holds the camera's attention as it juxtaposes him with the lifeless neighborhood around him. Similarly, the soundtrack, which Rhino is reissuing on its 30th anniversary, is a showcase for hetero heartthrobs the Bee Gees, who contribute a third of the tracklist, get a writing credit for Yvonne Elliman's ""If I Can't Have You"", and even grace the cover as some sort of mirrorball Holy Trinity. It makes cynical sense: The Bee Gees played their own instruments; had a dubious history in sub-Beatles pop; and were white and handsome-- all of which made them more marketable to new audiences than their black, female, or homosexual peers. As such, they should be critical pariahs on par with Stone Temple Pilots or the Killers, but their six tracks on Saturday Night Fever are frequently brilliant and redemptively fun. With its snaking instrumental melody and sneaking beat, opener ""Stayin' Alive"" is all cocksure strut, even separated from Travolta's stroll through the credits, and ""Night Fever"" and ""You Should Be Dancin'"" have an urgency that makes dancin' seem like a life-or-death imperative. Their portion of the soundtrack forms a condensed hits package that few bands of the era can rival. Saturday Night Fever is by no means the definitive compilation of disco-- Rhino's 4xCD Disco Box, for example, is obviously more comprehensive, and Strut's Disco (Not Disco) comps and Tommy Boy's The Perfect Beats help capture proto-, post-, and underground disco-- but even beyond the contributions of the Bee Gees, it does have the potential to be a gateway comp, exposing listeners to a small range of disco subgenres. There's funk: ""Open Sesame"" doesn't rank among Kool & the Gang's absolute best cuts, but its silly vocals and breakneck horns are nevertheless impressive. There's soul: The Trammps' 10-story ""Disco Inferno""-- the extended cut, no less-- provides both the soundtrack's climax and its denouement. And of course there's novelty: Walter Murphy's ""Fifth of Beethoven"" is not just the height of disco-geek cheese, but also the precursor to ""serious"" undertakings by contemporary artists like Mirwais and Moby. Surprisingly, there are even Latin rhythms on Saturday Night Fever, most notably on M.F.S.B.'s ""K-Jee"" but also consigned to the souped-up incidental music by David Shire and Ralph McDonald. Ultimately, Saturday Night Fever doesn't disregard disco's underground origins so much as it simply sublimates them to the mainstream white experience. As a soundtrack, it works perfectly well, immersing listeners in the music (and therefore the spirit) of the film while selling more tickets. But as a pop-cultural document, it is significantly flawed, not only linked to a midlevel movie but also unable to fully capture the movement with which it has been so strongly identified. Thirty years later, after the ugly DISCO SUCKS trend and countless revivals both sincere and ironic, the appeal of Saturday Night Fever seems squarely nostalgic, but whatever its impact then or now, there is some amazing music on here-- and even more beyond.","To celebrate its 30th anniversary, Rhino reissues the classic soundtrack, the most popular document of the disco era.

The Else,They Might Be Giants,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1639d034d5c69bf49f3/1:1/w_160/07a86d5e.jpg,2007-07-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10422-the-else/,Idlewild,"Over the past few years, They Might Be Giants made such a smooth transition to children's rock that one would speculate becoming Raffi for the hipster-parent set was their ultimate destiny all along. But reducing their legacy to Wiggles-alternatives does injustice to a now quarter-century (!!!) run that has snaked its way through a variety of phases: sampler pranksters, full-band genre decathletes, frightfully prolific TV soundtrackers, and meta-lit accompaniment. Poll any segment of music fandom on their favorite TMBG era (we've all got one, don't even deny it), and the tallest bar will inevitably fall in the region of Lincoln > Apollo 18. It's no great mystery why; as with most bands, this early era contained all the seeds of the above-listed later TMBG phases in relatively equal amounts. But one seed apparently fell on rocky ground, being somewhat neglected as the Johns got a real band and bigger ambitions: The band's long-forgotten post-punk upbringing. Gasp if you must, but don't forget they started in 1982 and that early singles ""Don't Let's Start"" and ""Ana Ng"" could almost pass for the twitchy, catchy work of crit-faves like the dB's or the Feelies, bands too high on dork factor to have fit into the more fashionable environs of post-punk's cool cousin new-wave. No, really, listen to them again. Fortunately, as Johns Linnell and Flansburgh go somewhat gracefully into their middle ages, they seem to be recalling some of those tighter, tauter early days, when they were closer to Devo than Elmo. The creepy Marcel Dzama art of The Else would suggest so, as would the wonderfully stiff beat of ""I'm Impressed"", an anthem for beta-males with music as nervous as its message, not jokingly wrapped in big rock production like so much latter-day TMBG. That one's a Linnell, but Flansburgh is usually the one game for a power-pop throwback a la ""Twisting"", throwing together barre chords with some self-entertaining clever lyrics for the simple charms of ""The Shadow Government"" and ""Feign Amnesia"". Oh, but if only they had stopped there. For a band that could probably deal with a mild break from ambition, recruiting the Dust Brothers as producers is not a promising sign, though their presence isn't as blatant as it could have been. The fuzz-bass backbeat on ""Take Out the Trash"" may sound a bit like Odelay, but Flansburgh's (hopefully) unintentional biting of Smash Mouth is what ultimately sinks the song. And surely the siblings Dust can't be blamed for the train wreck that is ""With the Dark"", some sort of mini-epic, maybe about pirates, that can't stay in one genre for more than 20 seconds. As is becoming more and more common, TMBG are failed by their soft spot for musical humor and gimmickry, tendencies they used to keep in fine balance, but which have increasingly gotten away from them as their palette got wider. I mean, Christ, I'm a neurobiologist, and even I only got a one-time chuckle out of ""Contrecoup"", which filters a love song through traumatic brain injury terminology. Same goes for ""The Mesopotamians"" and ""Bee of the Bird of the Moth"", songs with words like ""mesopotamish"" and ""bugness"" that don't help the cause of anyone arguing that the band is more than a (particularly long-lived) novelty act. Perhaps TMBG are just happier making kid's music-- even when they try to grapple with adult situations on ""Upside Down Frown"" or ""Climbing Up the Walls"" it still comes out G-rated. Or maybe they just like being in a child's ideal of a rock band, with their addictions to needless guitar solos and brass parts, long overdue for an intervention. But if they could just concentrate on what it was like to be young, but not that young, for longer than the 2:39 of ""I'm Impressed"", they could remind people that they were once more than just licensing geniuses and rugrat headliners, they were nervy, high-strung, geek-rock kings. I don't want the world, I just want that half.","Recent converts to children's rock, Johns Linnell and Flansburgh here go somewhat gracefully into their middle ages by recalling their tighter, tauter early days, when they were closer to Devo than Elmo.

The Midnight Room,Jennifer Gentle,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15413d197565213a5e4/1:1/w_160/8774986a.jpg,2007-07-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10408-the-midnight-room/,Sub Pop,"The word ""psychedelic"" is often used to describe the music of Jennifer Gentle, an inevitability when you take your name from a Syd Barrett lyric. But in the case of this Italian outfit, the word is really just being used as another term for ""weird."" The defining qualities of psychedelia-- out-of-body transcendence, hallucinations, altered states of perception-- don't really factor into the experience of listening to The Midnight Room, Jennifer Gentle's second Sub Pop release. The album's backstory certainly proposes a supernatural subtext: after parting ways with long-time collaborator Alessio Gastaldello, founding member Marco Fasolo sequestered himself in a home studio where, according to legend (or record company bio), a prior owner had killed himself. The result is a hermetic, claustrophobic recording that, rather than distort the reality of your surroundings, makes you hyper-aware of them-- not unlike a sleepless night where every creak and squeak in the dark seems to pierce your ears and heighten the sense of panic. Given the grim history of Fasolo's recording space, it's appropriate that The Midnight Room opens with a song called ""Twin Ghosts"", making allusions to The Shining all the more explicit. Immediately, the song distances the new album from its 2005 predecessor, Valende, its hyperactive racket displaced by a disquieting sense of calm: over a wheezing church-organ drone, Fasolo sighs out a ghostly, indecipherable choral melody, while periodic guitar plucks and floor-tom beats delineate the existence of a chorus. This hazy stasis is echoed on the album's closing track, ""Come Closer"", essentially, a slow-motion revision of Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine."" But these tracks prove to be anomalies-- the dusk/dawn bookends to a very bizarre night that transpires in between. Fasolo plays every instrument heard on The Midnight Room, and in the album's middle eight-song string, he sounds like he's trying to record all his parts at once: guitar chords are played on single strings in circular patterns, each string pluck punctuated by a broken tin-soldier drum beat. The songs all share a curious, clockwork nature that effectively enhances the strangeness of Fasolo's voice, which often makes you wonder if the singer is seven years old or 70. But if Fasolo's intent on The Midnight Room was to evoke the feeling of a mind slowly deteriorating, he's done almost too good a job-- over the course of the album, the spare notes and martial rhythms accrue the maddening effect of a water-torture drip. This fidgety restlessness seems set to explode on ""It's In Her Eyes"", when a hard snare hit triggers a loud, power-chord riff and a scream; alas, it's the final note of the song. The blissed-out space-boy heard on Valende hasn't been completely lost in the void: Winsome turns like ""Take My Hand"" and ""Electric Princess"" suggest that Fasolo's fascination with Syd Barrett has little to do with the latter's acid-casualty legend and more to do with his plainspoken charms and innocent, romantic whimsy. But another pervasive influence appears to be Frank Zappa's Freak Out!, in the kazoo flourishes of ""Mercury Blood"" and the pervasive things-going-bump-in-the-night clatter, which hits a fever pitch in the cacophonous din of pounding pianos and typewriter bells that comprise ""Granny's House"". The Midnight Room is a masterful exercise in creating a peculiar and absorbing sense of mood and place. But, as befits an album born of extreme isolation, its painstaking, constricting song structures can also make The Midnight Room an unwelcoming place to be.","Italian explorers have the psychedelic references to go with the band name inspired by Syd Barrett, but ultimately aim for a more hermetic and claustrophobic sound.

At My Age,Nick Lowe,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14ab1335d7bf169a25b/1:1/w_160/b82ffd48.jpg,2007-07-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10399-at-my-age/,Yep Roc,"No artist gets to decide how they'll be remembered. If, as seems increasingly likely, Nick Lowe ends up remembered as the guy who penned ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"" back in the early 1970s, surely the songwriter will be satisfied. Yet fans and followers of Lowe know there's a nearly endless stream of legitimate second (or first) choices for pick of his defining moment. As a member of Brinsley Schwarz, Lowe helped bridge pub rock to punk. Lowe inaugurated the Stiff label with his single ""So It Goes"", and more explicitly helped pave the way for punk's indie movement by producing the Damned's epochal ""New Rose"". He subsequently produced key tracks for the Pretenders and several albums for Elvis Costello. But maybe most impressive of all Lowe's feats was ""The Beast in Me"", a song from his 1994 comeback album The Impossible Bird, long after he had faded from pop prominence. Later that same year, the song also became the best non-stunt cover of one-time father-in-law Johnny Cash's late-career comeback. It was a cred-boosting number all around, and proved once and for all Lowe's worth as a songwriter in the classic sense rather than just a snide wit with an ear for hooks. His nickname ""Basher"" stemmed from his ability/compulsion to just crank out songs, but The Impossible Bird and songs like ""The Beast in Me"" showed a more considered, thoughtful, patient side to Lowe. Fittingly and full circle, in many ways Lowe owes this mellow change of direction to ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"". Curtis Stigers covered the song on the soundtrack to ""The Bodyguard"", and in Lowe's own words it was like someone suddenly dumped a bag of money on his doorstep. Free from commercial considerations, Lowe started exploring his love of classic country, soul, r&b and crooner jazz, a path that continues with the new At My Age. There's been some talk of this most recent stage of Lowe's career as being too sentimental, or sans balls. But while Lowe's hardly up to his old tricks, his new tricks have more than their share of pleasures. If Lowe used to attack pop songs with a punk's cynicism and an ironic streak a mile wide, these days he exudes the illusion that he's settled down and settled in when in fact he's been happily exploring formalism with a sly wink. By his account, he started taking his guitar out to the country and playing old dancehalls, letting the new material breath and live a little until it resembled the pre- and early-rock era he aimed to emulate. In fact, both Lowe and his press materials have made a big deal about distinguishing the covers from the originals contained on At My Age, and Lowe's last few records have made a similar game of spotting the genuine classic amidst the songs that simply sound like genuine classics. It's a cleverly subversive strategy in its own right, the grey-haired and grown-up ex-punk making music his dad would have liked, though experience has added an air of increased authenticity to songs such as ""A Better Man"" and the almost imperceptibly skanking ""Long Limbed Girl"". Indeed, now Lowe is 58, both his parents have passed, and he's an unlikely first time dad, so it's somewhat hard to imagine him twisting the earnest sentiments of Charlie Feathers' ""A Man in Love"" to suit his former sarcastic mode. Of course, Lowe can still be funny, too, as he is on ""The Club"", which begins ""If you've ever had someone come along/ Reach in, pull out your heart and break it/ Just for fun/ As easy as humming a song/ Join the club."" On ""People Change"" (which features Chrissie Hynde and some nice Stax horns), he basically dismisses the call of nostalgia with a blithe but affable declaration of ""People change/ That's the long and short of it."" ""Now, you say those times you had were never that many/ Just be thankful you had any/ And cut yourself a slice of reality,"" Lowe gently advises, and he seems to have taken his own advice and moved on. At his age, Lowe's still young enough to get away with making music in his former mode, but he's old enough to know better. Instead of looking to the recent past for inspiration, he's looked to the even more distant past, if only because it's the music that-- square or not-- currently makes him the most happy and content. And for 33 minutes or so, if you follow Lowe's lead and let loose any baggage you might be carrying, you're likely to be as happy as he is, too.","The one-time Jesus of Cool continues his quest to chill out.

Extricate/Shift-Work/Code: Selfish,The Fall,by: Joe Tangari,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14dc0084474cd0c1dc2/1:1/w_160/2f8cfc6d.jpeg,2007-07-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11905-extricateshift-workcode-selfish/,FontanaFontana,"The Fall has been one of the most loved, talked-about post-punk bands throughout its thirty-year run as a forum for Mark E. Smith's sarcasm and bile, but the longevity and prolific nature that's helped fuel their improbable run is also the very thing that makes them so imposing for new listeners. Two dozen studio albums alone is a bewildering assortment, forget all the live albums, EPs, singles, compilations, boxed sets, and bootlegs that are floating around. It's widely accepted that the highest of the band's several peaks occurred in the early-to-mid-80s, when the line-up was reasonably stable and the players were at the peaks of their respective powers. I'm not here to challenge that assumption, because I happen to agree with it-- This Nation's Saving Grace, Perverted By Language, and Hex Enduction Hour are my three favorite Fall LPs. Nearly every phase of the band, however, has produced at least some interesting material, and they're all worth talking about. The Fall's three-album engagement with the Fontana label is one of the least-examined periods in the band's history, partly because the albums themselves have been sporadically available, and partly because the period marked a change in the band's music that many fans initially recoiled from. All three albums, 1990's Extricate, 1991's Shift-Work, and 1992's Code: Selfish, have finally received the reissue treatment, complete with obligatory bonus discs-- more on those later-- and remastering. Extricate was actually the first Fall album I heard, on the radio of my old truck during high school, when a friend bought it on cassette from a department store cut-out bin as we drove home after seeing local bands at an Elks Club lodge. I can't even remember what I thought at the time, but it wasn't until college that I approached the band on my own, taking the more common route through This Nation's Saving Grace and the 458489 A-Sides compilation. Coming back to this period through the lens of what went before and what came after, the music sounds different from archetypical Fall, but not so different that a genuine fan wouldn't find a lot to like. These albums still feature bassist Steve Hanley and guitarist Craig Scanlon, both holdovers from the classic era, and Simon Wolstencroft was well-ensconced behind the drums. So it's more a difference in approach and attitude that separates these albums from their predecessors. Mark E. Smith was coming off his divorce from his wife Brix, whose presence in the band had been a major shaping force in the latter half of the 80s. Extricate, the first post-Brix album, is marked by a far more melodic approach than your usual Fall joint. It's also loaded up with keyboards, nods to techno, and, in an unexpected but welcome twist, Kenny Brady's textural violin playing. ""Sing! Harpy"" is as caustic and deadpan as anything in the Fall canon, riding a spare, brutal groove as Brady's scraping strings fills in the gaps. It seems as though his divorce is fresh on Smith's mind. ""You know I why I hate you, baby?/ Because you make me hate you, baby,"" he sing-speaks on ""Black Monk Theme Pt. 1"", one of the band's many nods to 60s proto-punks the Monks. This immediately follows the sarcastic fake power ballad ""Bill Is Dead"", on which Smith sings, ""this is the greatest time of my life,"" over and over while organs swell behind him. It's hardly perfect, and ""Bill Is Dead"" wears thin once the novelty wears off, but Extricate is a more integral Fall album than it's often given credit for. They seem to be flagging a bit on much of Shift-Work, the very title of which could be taken to mean that their relentless pace was catching up to them. This is Smith's most prolonged flirtation with traditional singing-- the shockingly gentle ""Edinburgh Man"" isn't a prototype for the pop charts, but it draws as much of its staying power from Smith's melodic hook as it does from Scanlon's intravenous guitar or Scanlon's bassline. Elsewhere, actual backing harmonies populate the title track, and even songs with titles like ""The War Against Intelligence"" and ""Book of Lies"" don't have nearly the acerbic bite you might expect. Still, most of it works-- the album's principle problem is that it runs out of steam toward the end. Closer ""Sinister Waltz"" is godawful boring, and ""Rose"" is bleepy, sunny filler that feels out of place even on the cheeriest Fall album. Code: Selfish features a lean line-up of Hanley, Scanlon, Smith and Wolstencroft, with some keyboard work from David Bush. It's nearly as good as Extricate, bringing the band's nasty edge back full force without returning outright to familiar territory. And unlike Shift-Work, C:S doesn't leave you wondering what you're in for after the first track-- ""The Birmingham School of Business School"" leads things right off with a crackling beat and a jumble of church bell samples, with a double-tracked MES slurring out a sour serenade over the top and wrestling with Scanlon's squirming leads. Hanley essentially plays a would-be sequencer part manually on his bass. Hanley and Scanlon interact with startling precision throughout, but their finest moment is ""Two Face!"" which pits Scanlon's clean-toned note clusters and ringing chords against a see-sawing Hanley grind. ""Everything Hurtz"" has a cut-glass groove, with Wolstencroft masterfully controlling the song's momentum by switching up his beat. The single version is on the bonus disc. As one might imagine, the three bonus discs of these reissues present a widely varied and inconsistent mixture of b-sides, castaways, BBC recordings, and alternate versions. With nearly an hour of extras per album, the band's hardest-core obsessives-- most of their audience, come to think of it-- will have plenty to dig into. The BBC sessions (four tracks on each disc) are among the most valuable additions, but there are other gems, including the immortal ""British People in Hot Weather"", with its huge, sarcastic Caribbean keyboard hook and nasty funk groove, and ""High Tension Line"", which takes its title to heart in a its taut, wiry arrangement. All told, this phase of the Fall's long and strange career is definitely worth exploring once you've become hooked on them, but it isn't a place to start. If you've been waiting for quality reissues of the albums, these versions give you a lot for your legal tender, scraping mostly gold from the seemingly endless pit of rare Fall material.","Three albums originally released on Fontana in the early 1990s are reissued with the usual assortment of bonus tracks and b-sides, offering a deeper look at one of the iconic band's least-examined periods.

The Friends EP,Ween,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b143ea9e61561daa6756/1:1/w_160/54a5a0a8.jpg,2007-07-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10393-the-friends-ep/,Chocodog,"Proponents of Ween typically offer two arguments in the face of detractors: 1) The band deserves to be taken more seriously because they're ridiculously proficient musicians; or 2) The band shouldn't be taken so seriously, so loosen up and enjoy the ride. In most cases at least one of these defenses is plausible, though neither addresses the main issue that irks so many first-time Ween listeners: How can they so capriciously genre-hop, throw their voices and, worst of all, mar their virtuosity with lyrics about spinal meningitis and scatology? Unfortunately, Ween's newest release, the Friends EP, will certainly perpetuate all these qualms, especially once people realize it's a five-song mini-narrative ending with a ballad about guy-on-guy fellatio. Fact is, in the post-mash-up era of 2 Many DJs, Girl Talk, et. al., Ween's unpredictable, Janus-faced albums are easier to digest. As long as they're copping a genre people generally enjoy without relying too heavily on f-bombs or fart jokes, they should be fair game. Friends, however, tests these limits more than any Ween release in recent memory. An appetizer for the band's fall 2007 LP-- their first in four years-- this record lacks a single guitar-driven rock song, instead spoofing saccharine dance-pop and exotic tropical genres. Throw in the rainbow-colored packaging and Ween's completely gone from Pink Floyd to pink triangle here, penning the soundtrack to a-- hee-hee-- homoerotic one-night stand that thumbs its nose at the band's recent albums steeped in classic rock. The eponymous opener sets the tone pretty bluntly, harkening back to dreaded dance-pop phenomena like ""The Macarena"" or ""Numa Numa Dance."" Although standout track ""I Got to Put the Hammer Down"" tries to right the ship with a blistering synth line and prickly drum machine more closely related to CSS than the Venga Boys, the song's two-and-a-half minutes fails to stave off the EP's remaining kitsch. And then there's the Caribbean flotsam ""King Billy"", a reggae-tinged slow-burner that takes six minutes to go nowhere, reeking of something scraped off of Jimmy Buffet's poop deck. At a standard level of good humor, one can easily enjoy the closing duo of ""Light Me Up"" and ""Slow Down Boy"", two commonplace but well-executed stabs at genre co-option for Ween. I bet you don't even pick up one on the latter's naughty chorus (""Slow down boy...lay back and let him blow you away"") amidst the catchy faux-Orange Juice balladry. Still, Ween's tongue fares just as well hanging out the mouth as implanted in the cheek, and any release completely bereft of their hardcore and classic rock roots feels like a rip-off. Fortunately none of these tracks will appear on their upcoming full-length, so let's laugh at the novelty of these knuckleheads making a cheesy barbeque soundtrack and hope Friends is only one bizarre pitstop along Ween's continuing quest for hallowed (read: serious) rock and roll buffoonery.","Hoping to whet appetites for their first full-length in four years, Ween releases a five-song set including tongue-in-cheek stabs at Hi-NRG dance-pop, reggae, and new romantic balladry.

Family Tree,Nick Drake,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cc9d034d5c69bf27e3/1:1/w_160/430c69f1.jpg,2007-07-12 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/,Tsunami,"In a 1994 interview with Mojo magazine, Nick Drake's longtime producer, Joe Boyd, assured fans that ""Everything releasable has been released."" Boyd's pledge seems almost laughable now: As Drake's tombstone famously, presciently reads, ""Now we rise and we are everywhere."" The bulk of the material on the 28-track Family Tree-- a new collection of lo-fi home recordings produced on a reel-to-reel at Drake's parent's estate, Far Leys, plus eight tracks recorded on cassette while Drake was studying in Aix En Provence, France, one duet with his sister, Gabrielle, and two songs written and performed by his mother, Molly-- has already circulated widely on bootlegs, traded, and cherished by Drake completists, many of whom acquired the cuts by making a pilgrimage to Far Leys and requesting music from Drake's parents, who once welcomed their son's grieving fans. Even though some of these tracks have been around for years, posthumously publicizing Drake's private home recordings still feels a bit like an ethical landmine-- already, a glut of releases (compilations, unreleased recordings, greatest hits) is marring an otherwise-pristine three LP legacy, and dipping into something as personal and unfinished as home demos can seem a bit opportunistic, vaguely unnecessary, and maybe even a tiny bit cruel: Although his music is eerily ubiquitous in 2007, Nick Drake was a commercial failure in his lifetime, selling only a middling number of records before overdosing in 1974, at age 26. Still: Compiled by Drake's sister, Gabrielle, produced by his estate manager, Cally, and mixed by beloved engineer John Wood (who also produced Pink Moon, and recorded Drake's first two records), it seems likely that Family Tree was created and realized with the very best intentions. In the liner notes, Gabrielle, addressing her brother in an open-ended letter, is cautious, apologetic: ""Up till now, every decision I have taken-- I have been allowed to take-- on your behalf about your music has been guided by what I believe might have met with your approval...But now, I am endorsing the publication of an album that I am not at all sure you would have sanctioned."" Most cuts feel unfinished-- four are clearly sketches, clocking in at under one minute – and nothing here is particularly revelatory, but Family Tree is still worth snatching up if you're interested in hearing how Drake's patented coo-and-strum developed: All tracks pre-date Drake's 1969 debut, Five Leaves Left (early versions of ""Way to Blue"" and ""Day Is Done"" both appear here), and it's not difficult to hear the budding folksinger's style build and expand. Nick and Gabrielle pair up for a cover of traditional cut ""All My Trials""; based on a Bahamian lullaby, the cut was an omnipresent protest song in the early 1960s, and its closing couplet-- ""All my trials, Lord/ Soon be over""-- is typically read as optimistic, but given the gruesome ending of Nick Drake's story, the line (and Drake's muted delivery) suddenly seems ominous, foreboding. ""All My Trials"" is arguably the most riveting track here: Drake strums gently, and he and his sister harmonize (in the otherworldly way only siblings can), their voices naturally congruent, curling together, building on shared DNA. Drake covers a handful of Jackson C. Frank songs (""Here Come The Blues"", ""Blues Run the Game"", ""Milk and Honey""), Robin Frederick's ""Been Smoking Too Long"" (which also appears on Time of No Reply), the traditional ""My Baby's So Sweet"", Bert Jansch's ""Strolling Down the Highway"", and Bob Dylan's ""Tomorrow is a Long Time"", but it's ultimately his own work that shines brightest-- now and, in all likelihood, forever.","This 28-track collection of lo-fi home recordings-- many of which have been available on bootlegs for years-- was produced on a reel-to-reel at Drake's parent's estate, recorded on cassette while Drake was studying in Aix En Provence, France, or made in conjunction with other members of the late singer-songwriter's family.

Storyteller & the Gossip Columnist,Southerly,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15ab1335d7bf169a27d/1:1/w_160/7e3d33bb.jpg,2007-07-11 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10414-storyteller-the-gossip-columnist/,Greyday,"Why are you leaving the house? A concert? Stay home. Stream it. Why travel? You can always make trans-Atlantic friends with MySpace. Fodor's has some pretty brilliant photographs, too. And what's the deal with getting sweaty this summer? The air conditioner is so nice. Krist Krueger-- the 26-year-old Wisconsin-born, Portland-based songwriter that leads what was once a one-man-band called Southerly-- is terrified of living a safe life. He wants experience. ""So coax yourself to make believe/ That you'll come back in a cloud of smoke/ With guns blazing,"" he boasts on ""How to Be a Dreamer"", the literal and thematic centerpiece of his second album, Storyteller & the Gossip Columnist. ""And on that day, you'll find yourself/ The self that you've been struggling to be/ Just make believe."" Elsewhere, Krueger-- who leads a band, owns a record label, runs a booking agency, produces records and ostensibly has a personal life-- depicts the pretty, jaded girl snubbing romantic inquiries, ponders the empty pages lining the narrative of his life, and laments kids wasting their romantic youths while sitting in factory parking lots. If Krueger were a character in a Built to Spill song, he wouldn't be stuck at home in Twin Falls. That ideal of living the rich, full life cuts both ways on Columnist: There's a wonderful amount of variety here, from the crescendo that capitalizes on the potential energy of Krueger's coiled emotions during the self-doubting ""If We All Forgot"" to the pedestrian showmanship springing from the piano keys during the hopeful ""Soldiers"". Krueger is arranging for a full band with horns and strings on Columnist, and, thrown to the orchestra for the first time, he's remarkably accomplished, tastefully piling layers that augment rather than clutter. And the songs themselves come with bent, purposefully altered structures: One leads with the refrain, while another condenses its verses to a sum of 30 seconds and lets the edict-- ""Breathe, 'cause it just might be your last""-- and melodramatic violin movements occupy most of the other two minutes. Krueger also sings with the fidelity of a songwriter who's seen what he's saying. In fact, he's often better at conveying his sentiments with vocal nuances than with the words themselves: Lyrically, the cresting ""If We All Forget"" is a wash (""I'm afraid, scared to death...I'm a shell of who I once was""), but Krueger's voice-- a thin wisp of air barely passing through his high register-- articulates the anxiety perfectly. But when Krueger misses either lyrically or musically, his problems stem from rushed concepts, as though he's trying to say or live too much too fast. The most interesting lyrical ideas here are tossed-off. Krueger raises interesting lyrical ideas, such as his suggestion that John Lennon's love songs were about more than love, and that some hearts can actually be scared of future calluses. But he never really chases these ideas with the vigor and vision they warrant. The latter even gets treated like a Jason Mraz jangle, ""old man's eyes"" rhymed with paralyzed over a chafing acoustic guitar jerk and a lazy bass throb. Likewise, the handful of musical ideas that don't meet their potential on Columnist suffer from a lack of commitment: Only one of the four instrumentals here (the ponderous waltz of ""For the Speechless Coward"", foreshadowing ""Dreamer"", the album's pinnacle) has any sway on the imprint the album provides when its 38 minutes are up. Prelude ""Visage Sans Expression"" surrounds a fleet, fingerpicked acoustic line with strings both dark and bright. It's pretty and graceful but, ultimately, just passive. Likewise, 52-second closer ""Simple Simon"" tinkers with two concurrent guitar loops. It's an interesting trinket, but its ultimate effect is showing: All the sudden, you'll probably realize you've enjoyed your time with Storyteller & the Gossip Columnist well enough, but you don't feel too much about the music that's been soundtracking your last 38 minutes. That's more than a tad ironic, right?","On his second full-length, Portland-based Krist Krueger writes songs about the thirst for experience, fleshing out his lyrical ideas with orchestral flourishes and bent structures.

In Camera,Arthur & Yu,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15d13d197565213a5ee/1:1/w_160/ef5e6114.jpg,2007-07-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10416-in-camera/,Hardly Art,"Arthur & Yu's debut LP, In Camera (the inaugural release for Sub Pop's new imprint, Hardly Art) is cute, coy, and a little bit gooey. With twinkling flutes, wide-eyed boy-girl harmonies, and 60s folk-pop melodies, In Camera would be infuriatingly precious if it weren't also weird, druggy, and mesmerizing. Fronted by Grant Olsen and Sonya Westcott (""Arthur"" and ""Yu"" are their respective childhood nicknames), the Seattle-based duo have doused their songs with a bucket of reverb, and In Camera's throbbing guitars, muted vocals, and mawkish arrangements sound more like the Velvet Underground and Nico (or Karen Dalton, or Serge Gainsbourg) than anything you'd ever dig up on Twee.net. Vocal duties are split between Olsen and Westcott (who, incidentally, was Rogue Wave's original bassist), and their voices are nicely complimentary, weaving together almost flawlessly-- Westcott's pipes are more fixed, whereas Olsen's voice seems to constantly flit from coo to caterwaul. Still, the juxtaposition of control and chaos works well (critics everywhere have pointed to the pair's undeniable Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra dynamic); on ""Come to View (Song for Neil Young)"", especially, the vocals crest and wane over jangly guitar and honking melodica, lending a curious layer of psychedlia to an otherwise staid pop song. Bobby Wane, Ben Kersten, and Scott Blue help fill out the group's sound, but In Camera's instrumentation-- while rich and beguiling-- ultimately feels secondary to all that singing. Olsen and Westcott have publicly copped to the little-kid themes on In Camera, from their adopted monikers to the schoolyard/pellet gun musings of ""Half Years"", and much of the record has the grainy, nostalgic feel of an old, Super 8 home movie: conjure unsteady montages of toddlers with smeared faces diving onto swingsets, waddling in circles through backyard gardens, pawing at bugs, tugging at their diapers, giggling and eating dirt and hurling their arms around other people's bare legs. The record does offer up its share of darker moments: the smarmy ""Lion's Mouth"" explores burgeoning sexuality via vaguely creepy, nuance-heavy lyrics (""Oh, we coulda kept it fun...My fingers in your buttons,"" Olsen mews). Like the Raveonettes, Jesus and Mary Chain, the Clientele, or My Morning Jacket, how much you dig Arthur & Yu is probably directly proportional to how much reverb you can stomach without wanting to clean out your ears with cotton swabs-- but if you don't mind a good dosing of echo, In Camera is an impressive debut for both band and label.","The inaugural release for Sub Pop's new imprint, Hardly Art, this indie pop album is somehow both wide-eyed and indebted to 60s folk-pop as well as weird, druggy, and mesmerizing.

Sirens of the Ditch,Jason Isbell,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b149c0084474cd0c1dba/1:1/w_160/24fb60e2.jpg,2007-07-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10398-sirens-of-the-ditch/,New West,"Any fiction teacher worth his or her salt will tell you that details-- precisely chosen, concisely described-- are crucial for making stories and characters believable. At least from his very first songs with the Drive-By Truckers, Jason Isbell has proved he's innately aware of this maxim: ""Outfit"", ""Decoration Day"", and ""Danko/Manuel"" are crammed with telling observations, concrete imagery, and lots of proper nouns. Likewise, his debut solo album, Sirens of the Ditch, works so well because it sounds so specific, whether he's ostensibly singing about his own predicaments or about his characters'. On ""Grown"", he admits to ""dancing to 'Purple Rain'"" as a kid; on ""Try"", he advises himself to ""take a year off and go back home,"" as if he's already worked out a plan in his head. With its observations about ""bombs in the sand"" and ""scripture on grocery store signs,"" ""Dress Blues"" is the most complicated consideration of military heroism since the Dixie Chicks' ""Travelin' Soldier"". Best of all is the swamp-rock saga ""Down in a Hole"", which comes up one corncob shy of Faulknerian. In the first verse, Isbell describes a man ""standing in the window with his tongue hanging out/ With a dirty white suit, a big white hat, and a bullet in his pocket."" The man's wealth and ambition have corroded a small Southern town, but rather than preach outright, Isbell couches it in a character's advice to another not to work for this man. ""It's like selling your soul,"" he warns. Isbell himself is obviously an ambitious songwriter and storyteller, and perhaps that trait led to his exit from the Drive-By Truckers earlier this year. Who but the band really know? When Isbell came aboard for the Southern Rock Opera tour in 2002, filling out the band's Skynyrdesque three-guitar attack, his work fit perfectly alongside that of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, both of whom specialize in story-songs drenched in local color and rich with regional detail. In 2004 and 2005, when the Truckers released Decoration Day and The Dirty South, it seemed unfair that one band should horde three top-notch songwriters, but in 2006, the lackluster A Blessing and a Curse showed the cracks in the unit. Like that album, Sirens occasionally sounds too slick, as on ""Chicago Promenade"" and ""Brand New Kind of Actress"", like he's trying to sell us something. With several Truckers in tow-- including Patterson Hood (who co-produces), bass player Shonna Tucker, and drummer Brad Morgan-- Isbell shows off his mastery of heavy Southern rock riffage on ""Try"" (which could be an epilogue to ""Danko/Manuel""), but the mostly acoustic second half works hard to distance him from the Truckers' dense electric sound and to expand his lyrical and vocal range. ""Hurricanes and Hand Grenades""-- five minutes of Muscle Shoals soul-- is the most obvious departure and features Isbell's most effortless and powerful performance. ""The Magician"" strums along at a front-porch clip that underscores the ache of the lyrics (""I had a bride/ I sawed her in half"" is both sad and funny), and the tense guitars of ""Shotgun Wedding"" bolster its shoddy stalker story, but closer ""The Devil Is My Running Mate"" is dark and too heavy-handed, suggesting that political commentary isn't Isbell's forte. It's a weak ending for a strong debut full of the kind of confident, charismatic songwriting that just can't be taught.","First solo record by former member of Drive-By Truckers dips into heavy Southern rock riffage but leans more toward soul and acoustic singer/songwriter territory.

Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga,Spoon,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1405e6ef959693220c7/1:1/w_160/28a720f8.jpg,2007-07-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10390-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga/,Merge,"Prior to the release of Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, online buzz suggested Spoon's sixth record was a grower, a distinction also conferred upon the Austin band's two previous albums, each more experimental (and at times alienating) than its predecessor. That optimistic adjective-- which incorporates both the listener's failure to quickly grasp a record as well as a hope to eventually do so-- feels exceedingly appropriate for Spoon, who have cultivated an intense fan base while continuing to experiment (the frequent comparisons to Wilco are indeed apt in this case). A large contingent of Spoon's following has come from Britt Daniel's continual knack for, as he sang on 1998's ""Metal Detektor"", making ""the sound of getting kicked when you're down."" If any song were to be the quintessential Spoon pop single, then, the radiant, Jon Brion-produced ""The Underdog"", a Cliff's Notes encapsulation of Spoon's earnest compassion for the fucked-over, is it. With a three-piece brass fanfare, ""Underdog"" is a battle cry against succumbing to mediocrity masquerading as a middle finger to the standard-bearers: The lyric ""Get free from the middle man"" could also read: ""Get free from the middle, man."" Likewise, the slinky ""Don't You Evah"" (a cover of an unreleased song by former tourmates the Natural History) affirms Spoon's trend toward emotional trusses for the fairer sex, recalling Gimme Fiction's ""They Never Got You"" and Kill the Moonlight's ""Don't Let It Get You Down"". A different directive occurs on opener ""Don't Make Me a Target"", however, which revisits the obscurantist personal politicizing that many thought marked *Fiction'*s ""My Mathematical Mind"". With a few well-chosen phrases-- ""Here come a man from the star...Beating his drum...Nuclear dicks with their dialect drawls,"" both victim and perpetrator become crystal clear. Ga Ga travels past in a flash-- at 36 minutes, it returns to the brief runtime that Fiction well surpassed-- but leaves plenty of reasons to revisit. Daniel and drummer Jim Eno's tendencies toward studio-based devilry come full-flower here, each listen revealing craftsmen reveling in detail. What in lesser hands could be extra-textual gobbledygook instead feels the product of studio freestyling, something to which the murky mixing-board wizardry of Jamaican dub is an obvious precursor. Penultimate song ""Finer Feelings"" is one bit of proof, its wide-open guitars-- straight from Sandinista!-- augmented with a sampled toast from (Clash collaborator) Mikey Dread's ""Industrial Spy"". With the addition of echoed ambiance from a Brussels fair field recording, ""Feelings"" acquires the aura of a surreal Kingston sound system. Earlier, ""Evah""'s introduction dips into the self-referentiality the band flirted with on Fiction, featuring a diced-up, looped Daniel asking Eno to record his studio talkback. Two songs later, all manner of discordance enters and exits the reverb-heavy mix of the appropriately titled ""Eddie's Ragga"", which developed from a jam session with Eddie Robert of Daniel-produced Austinites I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness. Ga Ga's most intriguing sonic creation, however, is the song which takes the dub influence in the furthest direction: ""The Ghost of You Lingers"". A return to Moonlight's spooky sonic variegation, ""Ghost""'s pounding, echoed piano feels like a merged memory of the jabbed guitar from ""Small Stakes"" with ""Paper Tiger""'s moody expressionism. Daniel's unmistakable voice is a distant, gothic wail here, as he mourns his missing love with characteristic jargon: ""We put on a clinic/ If you were here would you calm me down or settle the score."" Daniel's gift for non-mawkish romanticism results in both Ga Ga's best moments, and three of the best songs the band has yet create. Especially on Girls Can Tell, Spoon's always flirted with straight-up blue-eyed soul, and ""You Got Yr Cherry Bomb"" is their full-on take-off of Elvis Costello's Motown M.O. on Get Happy! (perhaps purposefully, then, the album's bonus disc is titled Get Nice!). Backed by an irresistible Holland-Dozier-Holland gospel-pop-stomp, ""Cherry Bomb"" re-imagines the heart/sleeve cliché as a vivid bicep tattoo, as Daniel implores his love to three-point-turn and chill out. Ga Ga's real bang happens at its close, however, with the one-two send-off of ""Feelings"" and ""Black Like Me"". The former, which ostensibly documents a Memphis-based isolation, features a handclap-accompanied chorus as energized and unremittingly hopeful as Daniel's ever been: ""Sometimes I think that I'll find a love/ One that's gonna change my heart/ I'll find it in Commercial Appeal/ And then this heartache'll get chased away."" ""Black""'s melodic melancholy-- backed by a weeping piano/guitar motif that recalls Let it Bleed-- is simply gorgeous. Has Daniel ever written a lyric more crushing in its confused simplicity than ""I'm in need of someone to take care of me tonight""? Rather than attempt to relate with someone who's already taken leave, he splits, and so, apparently, does his mind. During the internalized call-and-response that follows, he appeals: ""All the weird kids up front/ Tell me what you know you want."" Thus, at the end of his emotional rope, he crosses the fourth wall and reveals the aching coda as a mutually lived performance. With Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Spoon have once again found a gray area between the poles of pop accessibility and untested studio theorizing, modifying a formula that has grown to feel familiar even as it wanders, and refusing to square the circle while doing so. Through whatever process they use, the band has also managed to create yet another wonderfully singular indie rock record, unafraid of unfettered passion or self-sabotage, and which affirms a shrouded, hybrid style as unquestionably theirs. Perhaps it is fitting to refer to Ga Ga, and Spoon albums on the whole, as growers, then, but with a different definition: one that takes into account the bands continual, and continually rewarding, approach to creative maturation.","The Austin band, which has cultivated an intense fan base while continuing to experiment, do so again here; this record finds band leader Britt Daniel and producer/drummer Jim Eno's tendencies toward studio-based devilry coming full-flower, each listen revealing craftsmen reveling in detail.

Goodbye,Ulrich Schnauss,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12613d197565213856d/1:1/w_160/21349ba9.jpg,2007-07-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10406-goodbye/,Domino,"Ever since the first person plugged in the electric guitar, players have been working overtime to make them sound like something else. In a sense this makes the guitar one of the earliest synthesizers, so maybe it's not shocking that a lot of that time and effort has been spent, with the aid of fretboard know-how and fancy pedals and effects, making guitars sound like actual synthesizers. You could hear it in the hum of Robert Fripp's experiments with Brian Eno, or Robin Guthrie's wall of sound with the Cocteau Twins. After acid house, countless UK artists like Slowdive and Seefeel did it. To an extent, Sigur Rós does it. You can even hear it in Christian Fennesz's soundscapes, where his guitar playing is chopped up like any other ingredient in his glitchy pastoral techno, and you can certainly hear it with Ulrich Schnauss, whose dreamscapes owe at least as much to his guitar as they do to his mushy new age melodies and mild beats. Goodbye, Schnauss' third record, follows two discs that wanted terribly much to be breakthroughs, 2001's Far Away Trains Passing By and 2003's A Strangely Isolated Place-- each a perfectly pleasant album that ultimately felt a few years too late. The superior A Strangely Isolated Place did incorporate amorphous vocals the same way it incorporated ethereal guitar, but it still sounded more than a little bit like background music, and not necessarily in a good way, all but demanding video accompaniment of white horses running in slow motion or time-lapse footage of flowers blooming. If A Strangely Isolated Place lacked a little of the darkness and mystery ambient music needs to grab a hold of you, you still could admittedly sense some stylistic storm clouds lingering at the edges of the compositions that hinted at better stuff to come. The good news is that Goodbye shows Schnauss now has an even a better grasp of structure and songwriting. Tracks like the trite but lovely ""Shine"", ""Stars"", the awesomely Curve-y ""Medusa"" and ""Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"" feel like more than just open-ended vamps, and, importantly, some tougher guitar adds to their impact. Some vocals are handled by Rob McVey from Longview and Judith Beck, but they're mostly mixed in like so many additional effects. The bad news is that the overwhelming vibe is still that of easy listening digital mush, with songs such as ""A Song About Hope"" and ""Never Be the Same"" are pretty Cocteau Twins retreads that show how something once radical can become utterly banal in the wrong hands-- or the wrong decade. A few moments, like ""Einfeld"" and ""In Between the Years"", veer into the realm of aural wallpaper, like Cluster on an uninspired day, the shimmering guitars/synths a little too preset pacific in their swells and swooshes. In this context the coarsely strummed acoustic that starts the final track ""For Good"" is downright obnoxious, the big reveal that surprises no one beyond its self-satisfied orchestrator. It's this self-consciousness that keeps Ulrich, album after album, from fully succeeding. As a maker of ambient music, Schnauss needs to pick a position. Does he want to lose himself in the music, to totally disappear, leaving behind nothing but a diffuse cloud of sound where a man and his terrestrial equipment once stood? Or does he want to keep exploring this pedestrian man-with-guitar-doing-weird-things field, where the musical impact is more academic than it is particularly cool or compelling? This lack of commitment is what makes Schnauss and Goodbye so frustrating. It's as if he's seen the light but, rather than share what he knows of the cosmos, chooses instead to offer a tantalizing but incomplete approximation of it.",,5.4,
Sacchrilege EP,Boom Bip,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1535e6ef959693220e8/1:1/w_160/8afbd327.jpg,2007-07-10 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10407-sacchrilege-ep/,Lex,"If you're already a Boom Bip fan, there's a chance that his Sacchrilege EP is going to piss you off. Until now, Bryan Hollon has produced electronic music for people who don't really like electronic music. His most exceptional work is also among his earliest: 2000's Circle album with leprechaun rapper Doseone, an unclassifiable and often nightmarish work that approached hip-hop as if it were action painting. But the solo album Seed to Sun and the two EPs that followed it found Hollon retreating to the jazzy, directionless territory DJ Shadow made safe for a whole generation of so-called experimental DJs. Hollon's music began to show signs of life again on 2005's Blue Eyed in the Red Room, an album with relatively unfractured beats and analog synth clouds describing coherent melodic arcs. With guest vocals by Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys (with whom Hollon is collaborating on a full-length project this year) and Nina Nastasia, not to mention a welcome transparency, it felt like an album that wanted to engage listeners rather than keep them off-balance. And now, the straightforward Sacchrilege culminates Hollon's seven-year transition from pandemonium to order. It's a tight quintet of techno-inspired synth jams that have a lot more in common with Eliot Lipp's simple yet vibrant sequencing or Ratatat's stadium-sized squelch than Odd Nosdam's soft-focused beat collage. Emphasis on techno-inspired: Sacchrilege finds Hollon severing his tenuous ties to indie hip-hop and jazz, but it will be a bit too rushed and songy for techno buffs. Instead, it's an album of driving electronic pop infused with Krauty mechanical pulsations, clubby, night riding synthesizers, and the sort of crystal-clear dynamic shifts Hollon has shied away from until now. And it has an infectious enthusiasm-- you can tell Hollon feels stoked to be making music that really moves, and in his eagerness, he tries on a variety of styles. Opener ""Snook Adis"" is an itchy Italo-disco sine wave that marks Hollon's first foray into music you could cruise to. ""Rat Tail"" is splashy, dot-matrix electro, and ""The Pinks"" is glossy new wave with interstellar synths and bucking cowbells. ""Coogi Sweater"" is a concentrically-rippled take on deep house, complete with coolly hedonistic lyrics from Ali Lee: ""Make your way/ To the bar/ Put me in your fancy car."" It's the album's surest sign that Boom Bip is letting his hair down and embracing a value that's often been lacking from his otherwise-intriguing music: fun. It's also what stands to alienate listeners who like Boom Bip as a defiantly un-jiggy undie auteur. People-- let a player play.","Tight, relatively straightforward EP culminates Bryan Hollon's seven-year transition from pandemonium to order.

In Dub,Black Devil Disco Club,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14b9d034d5c69bf49d2/1:1/w_160/ca1e41d5.jpg,2007-07-10 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10400-in-dub/,Lo,"So few caught on to the mysterious Black Devil the first time around that it's no shock the group/guy/studio construct's excellent second coming, 28 Later, also took people by surprise. The 2006 disc of classic-sounding Italo disco came with little corroborating documentation, and to this day its contents remain unclear. Did the album round up songs from the vaults, or did the elusive, reclusive Bernard Fevre come up with new tracks in the mold of his earlier late-70s/early-80s music? No one seems to know for sure. If the music did come from the vaults, and if there was more where it came from, you'd think Fevre would capitalize on it with a quick sequel. That 28 Later has instead been followed by a more or less rote remix album In Dub implies one of three things. One, there's nothing left in the vaults, leaving it to remixers to extend the group's already limited legacy. Two, there is more to be dusted off, but not much, and Fevre intends to dole it out at a leisurely pace. Or three, 28 Later was indeed of a more recent vintage than its retro sound indicated, but Fevre needed to buy some time to come up with more of the same. This being Black Devil, or at least their 21st century reincarnation, In Dub isn't quite what it's billed as. Anyone expecting deconstructed versions of Fevre's already spare and streamlined songs will probably be disappointed by the autuer's jittery takes on his own tracks, which generally clutter up his cool sci-fi disco soundscapes with unnecessary sonic distractions that detract from their cyber-sexy awesomeness. ""On Just Foot (Dub)"" is total b-side doofiness, while the best bits of ""Coach Me (Dub)"" and ""An Other Skin (Dub)"" are close enough to their original counterparts. Fevre (or whomever) has more fun with ""Constantly No Respect (Dub)"", playing with the levels, isolating some of the vocals, dropping the beat in and out, but nothing on Fevre's half of In Dub furthers advances the dialogue he decided to restart. The second half of In Dub, where Fevre lets a handful of likeminded fans have their way with his tracks, is also where the fun kicks in, and while it won't change the way you listen to 28 Later, it at least better hints how much this stuff clearly resonates with Fevre's erstwhile descendants and adherents. ""The Devil in Us (En Francais)"" gets some acid house touches from Elitechnique, the results sounding more 1980s than even what Fevre drummed up. Some of the dissonant menace is gone, the beat's been boosted and, oh yeah, now the song's in French. ""On Just Foot (Slide Inside)"" features Prins Thomas having his Norwegian way with the tune, weaving Fevre's vocal doots and synth squelches into an even funkier confection that magnifies the sequencer pulse. In Flagranti seemingly slows down ""Coach Me (Again and Again)"", accenting the disco backbeat and downplaying the melody until its throbs like a druggy afterthought. Quiet Village transforms ""I Regret the Flower Power (Fragments of Fear)"" into ambient microhouse bliss, and Black Mustang's decision to replace the snare with handclaps heightens the disco euphoria. Unit 4 doesn't do anything special with the minimalist vamp ""An Other Skin (Days of Blackula)"", but like the best remixes it brings a few fresh ideas to the table without completely ignoring the song's original attributes. Like the rest of the remixes proper, It's enough to make waiting through Fevre walking in place worthwhile, rewarding your patience with savvy takes on Fevre's decidedly unsavvy retro-futurism. It's nothing new, but like everything else Black Devil's done, it'll at least make you move.","The mysterious Black Devil Disco Club stretches out their unlikely comeback by enlisting some remix help that brings the music up to date without robbing them of their retro-futuristic kitsch appeal.

Promised Works,The For Carnation,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b146b1335d7bf169a257/1:1/w_160/b94580c8.jpg,2007-07-10 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10396-promised-works/,Touch and Go,"""Quiet,"" ""delicate,"" and ""low-key"" neatly summed up the For Carnation when they released two EPs (or one EP and one very brief album) after the breakup of singer/guitarist Brian McMahan's former band, Slint. But these words failed to catch the band's atmospheric raison d'être, and led the excellent self-titled album that would follow to be positively slept-on. Legacy's a bitch that way. Promised Works combines the two out-of-print EPs, Fight Songs and Marshmallows, released between the disbandment of Slint and the For Carnation's self-titled (and final) album. This re-release offers the band a chance to get out from under Slint's long shadow, but more than that, it undercuts the obstinate, near-religious seriousness with which McMahan's other projects are received, which is just maybe what casual fans mean when they reach to call Slint ""overrated."" Slint deserved the praise; the For Carnation could use a little more. The unaccompanied strum of ""Grace Beneath the Pines"" isn't much more than a whisper, sure, but it wields silence in the same rapier way as Slint. It also shows off McMahan's preternatural sense of timing, as he moves like an off-Broadway prodigy, with every chord change just a hair behind the beat. These EP's also rescued McMahan's voice from where it had been buried since Tweez and put it front and center, which was a brave choice, a refreshing change of pace, and maybe not actually the best idea: his callow creak on blunt noir-bent lines about ""crackheads and assassins and burn victims and millionaires sons"" undersells them. ""How I Beat the Devil"", however, quickly dodges expectation with an aimless little riff that bursts into a sunny, straightforward groove lasting just over a minute. Fight Songs ended on the hopeful but still meandering ""Get and Stay Get March"", and were all indeed pretty tentative when compared to Marshmallows, which would follow a year later. This is the record where the stone-seriousness garnered by the cult of Slint was deflated by a much more relaxed and human approach. ""On the Swing"" would be the perfect soundtrack to just that, a slow pendulum rhythm with lolling delivery from McMahan over gentle plucking from former Slint-man Tim Ruth. That cuts quickly to the mechanical groove of ""I Wear the Gold"", only interrupted by multi-tracked ""ooh"" and intermittent feedback. It's an experiment in tension, no more and no less. In contrast, ""Imyr, Marshmallow"" puts patient sing-song vocals over sprightly children's show keyboards, the oddest and most surprising texture they'd ever pulled out, and its flat delivery remains creepy as shit. While ""Winter Lair"" and ""Salo"" were just as gaunt as later Slint (though the former pricks the ears with some rising sirens that would foreshadow the subtle atmospheric details of the self-titled), ""Preparing to Receive You"" digs an unhurried and unpretentious groove, the careful release of the guitar's low-end making it, if not quite hypnotic, a jam with some purpose. I don't know what precipitated the jump to Matador for these two EP's, but having them under Touch and Go's auspices now just makes sense. Wary and even distrustful of aggressive self-promotion, Slint and their peers had curious listeners coming to them, and were it not for the label's saintly, stubborn insistence on keeping their records in print, Slint may never have developed the audience they did (Spiderland was actually-- surprise, surprise-- a slow grower). These two EPs are fairly divergent and don't make perfect sense on one disc, but it's a minor complaint when compared to the greater good: Now people will have time to revisit the For Carnation, and every last corner of the catalog is now available and accessible for discovery and re-discovery.","Two out-of print EPs from Brian McMahan's atmospheric post-Slint outfit are reissued on one disc by Touch and Go, offering another chance to hear this unfairly overlooked band.

93-03,Frank Black,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b144ea9e61561daa6758/1:1/w_160/eaf0be89.jpg,2007-07-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10394-93-03/,Cooking Vinyl,"For a guy whose individual records can be so willfully fragmented, Frank Black's solo career has run in a straight line. In the beginning, he sounded like someone who'd just broken up Pixies, and his first two solo albums-- Teenager of the Year, in particular-- are nearly on par with his work in the band. Then, Black settled into a sort of quirky classic rock phase with the Catholics, and has now spent the last several years in reflection, revisiting the Pixies with a reunion of the band itself and with his own solo re-examination of songs he made with the band on the two-disc set Frank Black Francis. These past few years, which also saw Black trying his hand at the singer-songwriter game in Memphis, aren't accounted for on 93-03, which covers the first nine albums of his solo career (plus a bonus live disc recorded last year that touches on some recent material). While the Pixies have been anthologized nearly to death, there's never been a solo Black survey before this, and it seems like a good time to take a peek back at the years between his times with the Pixies, because the straight line he's drawn so far feels like it has to branch off in a new direction from here. The 22 studio tracks gathered on 93-03 (there's one new one from his forthcoming Bluefinger album, too) are arranged in simple chronological fashion, which makes his gradual migration from out-on-a-limb to the roots of the rock family tree seem improbably smooth. But it also underscores how much more interesting his youthful ADHD delivery was when compared to his present-day trad-rock performances: Where Teenager of the Year was wildly unpredictable, showcasing Black skipping from one far-out genre to the next, Dog in the Sand and Black Letter Days crawled with familiar rock tropes and felt oddly wooden. It's no accident that Teenager is represented  here by five tracks while the following four albums are covered in just six. Track selection could've gone about a dozen different ways, since Black has no real hits apart from ""Los Angeles"" and the blissfully anthemic ""Headache"". The songs off his stranger early albums play mostly to the middle, focusing on oddball rock tunes like ""Ten Percenter"", ""(I Want to Live on an) Abstract Plain"", and the immortal ""Freedom Rock"". However, opener ""Los Angeles"" is about as out-there as this compilation gets musically, with its faux-metal riffage and doom-stricken keyboard bridge. There are a lot of solid tracks strewn through the disc after ""Freedom Song"" wraps up the early phase. ""You Ain't Me"" and ""Men in Black"", from 1996's disappointing Cult of Ray, are stronger than I remember (""Men in Black"", for what it's worth, was originally a Teenager B-side), but the Catholics years are mixed to say the least. ""All My Ghosts"", from 1998's Frank Black & the Catholics, and Pistolero's ""Bad Harmony"" both possess the manic energy that serves Black best, and the latter in particular is a great example of Black thriving in a pretty traditional rock setting. Dog in the Sand's ""Hermaphroditos"", though it sometimes feels like Frank Black trying to live up to being old weird Black Francis, is nevertheless greatly entertaining, with its squeezed-out chorus and freaked-out verses. Still, some songs are leaden: ""I Gotta Move"" has an awkward call-and-response chorus; ""Velvety"", from 2002's Devil's Workshop, is as close to outright bland as Black gets; and ""Manitoba"" is a ballad with horns and slide guitar that points the way toward Fast Man Raider Man, with a melody that isn't especially suited to Black's voice. The new song, ""Threshold Apprehension"", sounds like it may have been inspired by the Pixies reunion-- it's punkier and spazzier than anything he's done in years, coming off almost like a reaction to his mellow Memphis sessions. Black bleats and squawks his way through it like he might have in 1989, but the sonic character of its dry, straightforward production is closer to what we've grown used to in his work with the Catholics. 93-03 does serve as a nice overview of Black's first eleven years as a musical bachelor, and anyone listening for the first time should be able to get a strong sense of whether the album each track is drawn from might be worth pursuing further. Still, Teenager of the Year remains the first stop on any tour of Frank Black's solo career, especially for those seeking something closer to his original Pixies flair.","Pixies leader cherrypicks the best sounds from his first nine solo albums, plus adds a bonus disc of recently recorded live versions of newer material.

Our Love to Admire,Interpol,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b159b1335d7bf169a278/1:1/w_160/43f4bb36.jpg,2007-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10413-our-love-to-admire/,Capitol,"Despite its title, Interpol's 2002 debut Turn on the Bright Lights was marked by its seductive shadowiness. The product of a bygone New York City filled with dank alleys and smoke-choked dives, Interpol fed on their own mystery while translating cool kid record collections into sexy downtown paranoia. They received a few positive notices, too. In the glowing Pitchfork review of the LP, Eric Carr wrote, ""Although it's no Closer or OK Computer, it's not unthinkable that this band might aspire to such heights."" And now-- after the tight, familiar turns of 2004's Antics and a major label deal-- their lofty aspirations are finally kicking in. Horns, extended outros, strings, an oboe, and album art featuring more than three colors-- welcome to the new world of Interpol. Our Love to Admire is the sound of a minted Madison Square Garden band seeking to freshen its damp atmospherics. It's not a terrible idea: On Antics, even Interpol seemed tired of Interpol, capping the disc's 10 tracks with a couple drawn-out duds. But, as anyone who's bought laundry detergent knows, ""new and improved"" does not always mean ""new"" or ""improved."" Admire's predictable adornments quickly prove fleeting and expose Interpol's nagging limitations rather than their potential. With cleaner production and an arsenal of instruments at their disposal, the group indulges, and the songs often suffer. Tracks like six-minute opener ""Pioneer to the Falls"" and the limp lowlight ""Scale"" grate due to overly repetitive song structures that rely too heavily on choppy breakdowns and pointless solos. And the band's previously economical songwriting, built on quick, bursting hooks and seamless transitions, is now grand, stately, and bloated-- more like a depressing U2 than a poppy Joy Division. While it would be easy (and probably accurate) to blame Admire's flaws on the group's heightened commercial ambitions, that's only part of the problem. With their first two LPs, Interpol vaulted over like-minded contemporaries thanks to their superior interplay between rhythm and melody. Instead of letting Banks and guitarist Daniel Kessler dominate songs with their trebly timbres, bassist Carlos D. and drummer Sam Fogarino provided perfect complements, at times overshadowing their bandmates altogether. (Just listen to the loping low-end of ""Untitled"" or the stutter-step snares on ""Evil"" for proof.) But Admire finds the band's balance shifting significantly; the rhythm players often seem more like glorified session men than integral components of a sleek post-punk machine. Gone are the death-disco grooves that made ""Slow Hands"" and ""Obstacle 1"" strangely danceable, and without those dynamic rhythmic counterpoints, the tempos slacken, songs drag, and the focus inevitably turns to Banks' increasingly frustrating word splatters. Banks has always been a between-the-lines lyricist-- his default is somewhere between opaque and lazy free association. With each new song, though, it becomes less certain that there was ever anything worth searching for between the lines in the first place. On Admire, he's slightly more overt, but this time his gripes with the opposite sex sometimes take on a surreal 80s rock star quality. ""No I in Threesome"", ostensibly about convincing a girlfriend to invite her friend into bed, is either a hilarious parody of an embarrassingly self-serious Paul Banks song-- or just an embarrassingly self-serious ménage a blah. (It's not both.) ""The Heinrich Maneuver"" rails against a cold-hearted, phony, manipulative actress (shocking!) and ""Rest My Chemistry"" has the singer grappling with an eternal query: Can you ever be too worn out on drugs to have sex with a young groupie? (A young groupie subject to head-smacking lines like, ""You look so young like a daisy in my lazy eye,"" no less.) More than ever, Banks tries to add some sympathy to his reedy robot croon and nearly succeeds on the wistful ""Wrecking Ball"". Still, when he monotones, ""I've got this soul, it's all fired up,"" he sounds as thrilled as a sleepy Stephen Hawking. On ""Threesome"", Banks suggests, ""It's time we give something new a try."" And his quest for a guilt-free three-way is as doomed as Interpol's dalliances with heavy-handed, big-budget gestures on Admire. Can they make an OK Computer or Closer? At this point, another Antics would suffice.","After the tight, familiar turns of 2004's Antics and a major label deal, these dapper NYC rockers' lofty aspirations are finally kicking in.

Burn Your Own Church,Black Strobe,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14113d197565213a5ce/1:1/w_160/7f7692af.jpg,2007-07-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10392-burn-your-own-church/,Playlouderrecordings,"This French dance act has spent years and years living up to its name, turning out singles, mixes, and remixes with a lovably brutal aesthetic-- a grim combination of flickering synthesizers, clenched-teeth rave-era energy, and calls back to the epic, addled clanging of old European hardcore. Along with acts like Vitalic, you might even give them some credit for helping usher the electro boom of the early 00s into the new land of grand, buzzy electro-house. And now, after the very significant departure of founder Ivan Smagghe, after bulking up to an actual instruments-and-all band, and after finally having gotten around to producing an LP, they offer us...bad metal? Instead of keeping up the clean-lined flicker of their best work, Black Strobe have slathered Burn Your Own Church in rock stuff: bottom-heavy power-chord snarl, lascivious grunting, and levels of dark posturing that rival the most ludicrous depths/heights of the goth era. Lengthy stretches sound like Trent Reznor, Glenn Danzig, and Korn have teamed up to host a Belgian drag competition. I know, I know: That makes it sound kind of awesome, right? Except in this competition, Marilyn Manson wins, and the first ear-grabbing track is trying depressingly hard to sound like NIN's ""Closer"". The most mind-blowing thing about this album, in fact, is that it can spend so much time in the land of over-the-top ludicrous goth preening without ever getting any fun-- hell, not even any camp-- out of it. I mean, between Rammstein and last year's Eurovision song contest being won by guys who actually dress up as monsters, the stakes for dark-rock amazement are pretty high: Not even the French have much excuse for finding nu-metal chugging exciting and exotic, let alone anyone who's set foot in an American mall since 1992. Germany's T. Raumschmiere tried this two years ago, with his own electro-metal Blitzkrieg Pop, and it wasn't working then, either. Granted, there's still a decent quotient of raw, pulsing synth around here (""Buzz Buzz Buzz""). A few of the band's electro-rock hybrids even achieve some grinding grandeur (""Last Club on Earth"")-- no doubt you'd be perfectly happy to hear one on a night out. But consider that only one track embarrasses itself enough to really win hearts: a cover of Bo Diddley's ""I'm a Man"", done over as a shuffling glam stomp. With Parisian Bo Diddley vocals. With a video featuring what looks like a teddy-boy Lemmy strutting around his own personal version of Shaft. There's a reason the video starts in front of a mirror: If you're gonna listen to something ridiculous, you might as well be able to make ridiculous faces, poses along with it, snarl along like a jackass in your car. And that's something the bulk of these tracks-- camp Diddley aside-- are surprisingly bad at facilitating. Black Strobe may be a good thing, historically, but this record isn't: Stick with ""Me and Madonna"", or ""Italian Fireflies"", or ""Chemical Sweet Girl"", or their remixes of Bloc Party, Alter Ego, Playgroup, and the Rapture, or ""Nazi Trance Fuck Off"", or their ""Biggest Fan"" remix for Martini Bros.-- any of years and years of stuff that works a whole lot better than this.","French dance act-- in the biggest year for French dance acts in a decade-- reacts to the significant departure of founder Ivan Smagghe by bulking to an actual instruments-and-all band.

Inventions for the New Season,Maserati,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13f5e6ef959693220c2/1:1/w_160/b4b99025.jpg,2007-07-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10389-inventions-for-the-new-season/,OrchardTemporary Residence,"Last week's Beastie Boys release The Mix-Up didn't have much going for it, but it was funny. Mike D remaining a worthless drummer after a quarter century of being a worthless drummer was funny, and so was the ""Paradise City"" whistle on ""14th St. Break"". The concept was maybe even the funniest part: semi-dormant world-famous rap group releases weekend jam session and earns itself another four or five years off. No sweat, right? Can were funny. So were Out Hud. The Fucking Champs are still funny. Yngwie Malmsteen isn't, or not intentionally, anyway. Neither is Joe Satriani. A certain kind of white and underbitten sincerity was and is the death of that Guitar World crowd, a kind of hermetic obliviousness that just assumes people will bow down before a record because it's called The Beautiful Guitar or Surfing with the Alien. Maserati have jokes too, sort of. Newly recruited drummer Gerhardt Fuchs of !!!, Turing Machine, and the Juan MacLean has a disgusting mustache, anyway, and he once got !!! bandmate John Pugh to describe him as ""a robot built by cavemen"" in a Village Voice feature. Maserati is also a fantasy joke title for an all instrumental post-rock quartet, evoking as it does sanitized speed and that kind of nerd-guitar action verb (Flying in a Blue Dream, Rising Force, Marching Out) so beloved by the shredder set. But it is with a sick sense of recognition that a listener realizes that the thing that does in fact come to mind when listening to Inventions of the New Season, again and again, is the unwished-for sight of a Maserati doing 95 around a corner or headed to the beach, taking the turns like a champ. Progress on Maserati's new record is signified by things getting louder: an uphill climb that starts with idling guitars and ends at speed. For texture, imagine an instrumental U2-- ""Kalinichta"" is what would happen if ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" never made it past four bars. Delayed guitar lines weave in and out; bass and drums kick in, then push ahead. There is no counterpoint or contrast in up-tempo tracks like ""Inventions"", ""Synchronicity IV"", or ""Show Me the Season""-- just a forward lurch. Even the shoegazey ""Kalimera"" leans on the volume knob for its arc. With all the upward motion, Maserati dodges the post-rock quandary of build-and-release by skipping the release. But isn't that the really necessary part? In Jeff Hobbs's recent novel The Tourists he writes about a kind of kinetic sculpture, ""a single wing suspended in a glass vacuum,"" the effect of which is to ""isolate one of the most beautiful and magical of worldly phenomena-- motion-- and strip away the beauty and the magic until there's nothing left but form-- black and smooth and shapeless."" Hobbs means to suggest an inability to connect, a kind of problematic drive towards sterility and control. These are also the obsessions embodied by Inventions for the New Season: all instruments rushing forward, Maserati streamlining their momentum until it's the only thing left to hear.","Chops-heavy instrumental band from Athens, Ga., with new drummer Gerhardt Fuchs of !!! and the Juan MacLean, releases its third full-length.

Crystal Healing,GHQ,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13ec0084474cd0c1da7/1:1/w_160/becf2e1a.jpg,2007-07-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10388-crystal-healing/,Three Lobed,"Since ancient times, the mystical healing powers of crystals and charmstones have been used by shamanistic cultures around the globe. But most modern scientists and physicians would credit whatever benefits might be attained by their use to a placebo effect or the power of suggestion. A similarly powerful, suggestive aura surrounds the work of psych-drone trio GHQ, and their latest small-batch document Crystal Healing. As with their rest of their output, the album is dense with tantalizing drone figures and ghostly melodies that hang mirage-like in the hovering mist, with a transportive effect that feels far too potent for any placebo. Comprised of the prolific trio of Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogisu, Zaimph), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Spectre Folk, Vanishing Voice) and Steve Gunn (Magik Markers, Moongang), the discography of GHQ seems now to have progressed them beyond the status of a mere offshoot or side project. Crystal Healing is the second GHQ full-length offering on Three-Lobed, following 2006's excellent live set Heavy Elements, and it finds the group further developing its shared private vocabulary. Though still frequently driven by acoustic instruments, there seems a marginal increase here in overall electricity, and as a result it feels slightly less like stumbling upon the fire circle of some obscure beachside cult. Filled with darting firefly guitar leads and shadowy effects, the album's slow-moving acid clouds can at points resemble those that handsomely billowed from the earliest trio versions of Charalambides. Despite the continued simplicity of GHQ's general approach, Crystal Healing contains a surprising breadth and variety within its sun-damaged drones. ""Asphalt Rainbows"" could almost pass for Jewelled Antler folk at its most hallucinatory, with Nolan's zoned vocals constantly threatening to actually shape themselves into a coherent lyric. Elsewhere, however, on such amorphous tracks as ""Invitation In"" and ""Varunani Night Wave"" the trio strays much closer to the thick, seamless noise frequencies of Double Leopards. Throughout the album GHQ purposefully keep their exact sound sources and methods rather blurred, so that when an untreated acoustic guitar climbs to the forefront on ""Purple Sun for Exalted Ones"", or when what sounds to be a fuzzed-out electric bass threads its way through ""Radiance Illuminate"", the effect can be as that of catching the briefest glimpse of a lost city or forgotten civilization through the overgrown canopied forest. The album reaches its ceremonial apex on the nine-minute closing title track, a piece that masterfully incorporates all of GHQ's various strands into a boundless, transfixing whole. Over a lo-fi Tony Conrad/Henry Flynt scraping drone, Gunn's guitar moves in elliptical patterns, dropping single notes like tiny lanterns floated onto a glassy, unlit pond. Early copies of Crystal Healing arrived with an extra disc that feature two extended bonus tracks, but the album on its own feels complete and self-contained as it again illustrates GHQ's considerable restorative powers. Placebo? If the final curative result is the same, what's the difference?","Tantilizing drone figures and ghostly melodies from an abstract folk project including members of Double Leopards, Vanishing Voice, and Magik Markers.

Duet for Guitars #2,M. Ward,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15213d197565213a5de/1:1/w_160/abbbf788.jpg,2007-07-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10405-duet-for-guitars-2/,Ow OmOw Om,"Venerable rock critic Robert Christgau's strategy for appraising boxed sets and other retrospectives has always been a sensible one: Start with the end first and work your way backward. The thought is that acts generally don't get better over the course of their career, they get worse, so if the newer stuff tacked on at the end is as good as the older stuff, you're golden. It's not as simple with indie acts, though. Often the newer stuff is the music people hear first and like most, and the older material is the music people have to later seek out. Yes, there will always be fans that insist the new stuff pales in comparison to the old stuff, but when all it takes is a cheap recorder to document your songs forever, sometimes a little more experience (in life and the studio alike) leads to bigger and better things. So it's been with Matt Ward, whose artistic and commercial ascent has been consistently upward, and whose musical evolution has largely coincided with his recording budget. Long before he signed to Merge and recorded Transfiguration of Vincent, Transistor Radio, and Post-War, and well before he landed tour slots with pal Norah Jones, M. Ward was just another quiet and modest singer-songwriter aspirant. Just because the likes of Post-War helped solidify his place on the musical map should not discount Ward's early work, though. In fact, most of the pieces are already in place on Ward's debut Duet for Guitars #2, originally released back in 2000 on Howe Gelb's Ow Om label. If Ward's subsequent albums explored antiquated sounds by way of artifice, Duet for Guitars #2 came about the vibe naturally: it sounds ragged and lo-fi because it is, recorded on a shoe string but not necessarily the worse for it. In fact, the by-default austerity adds a lot to songs like ""Good News"", ""Were You There?"" and ""Who May Be Lazy"", though ""Look Me Over"" and the too-short ""Fishing Boat Song"" would have benefited from the clarity a better studio provides. There are certainly some lo-fi cobwebs draped over ""Beautiful Car"" and ""Not a Gang"" as well, but the dusty atmosphere works fine for what Ward is getting at. Elsewhere the two ""duet"" songs, ""Duet for Guitars #2"" (which starts the record) and ""Duet for Guitars #1"" (which ends it) even reveal a bit of the John Fahey fascination that bore strange fruit with Ward's appearance on the Fahey tribute I Am the Resurrection. Working backwards toward this record, stripping away the tricks and tools Ward has used to polish up his act, is a journey worth taking. If he stopped recording today, the M. Ward boxed set would be as solid as they come, with the beginning sounding like just that-- a beginning-- but the rare beginning that works as well at the end as it does at the start. The folk underpinnings of Duet for Guitars #2 point forward to what Ward most recently achieved with Post-War, just as every moment of Post-War (and each Ward disc in between) looks back to that first album, where he began.","M. Ward's first album finally gets reissued, and fans will likely enjoy discovering (or rediscovering) the songwriter's not surprising but surprisingly solid roots.

Zeitgeist,The Smashing Pumpkins,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b155ea9e61561daa6773/1:1/w_160/3a3b98c4.jpg,2007-07-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10409-zeitgeist/,Reprise,"There are many reasons-- cynical, sad, or artistic-- for Billy Corgan to pull the Smashing Pumpkins moniker out of the crawlspace. Corgan has hardly been in hiding since the Pumpkins were dissolved in 2000, making music first with short-lived supergroup Zwan and then under his own name for 2005's TheFutureEmbrace. That latter record's commercial fizzle was abetted by Corgan's newspaper-ad announcement-- on the very day of TheFutureEmbrace's release-- that he was getting the band back together. Of course, the only actual reunion taking place was between Corgan and his most famous brand; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was already involved in both post-Pumpkins projects, and James Iha/D'Arcy preferred to stay in hiding. Thus, one couldn't help but feel that the Smashing Pumpkins revival wasn't little more than a calculated move for cash or attention or both. And, unsurprisingly, the strategy worked-- nobody could claim that Zeitgeist or the corresponding tour would have attracted nearly as much attention if the words ""Billy Corgan"" were at the top of that awful cover art instead of Smashing Pumpkins. But, it's possible, just maybe, that Corgan had artistic reasons for the switchback, genuinely wanting to reclaim the muse that led to his most artistically and commercially successful work, and add to the legacy of his most famous project. Hey, stranger things have happened. Zeitgeist's replication of that old SP sound is impressive, despite the lack of half the original lineup...it's not like Corgan ever let D'Arcy or Iha do anything in the studio anyway. For a band that was stadium-size right out of the box, it's a return to the band's trademark overdriven and overblown M.O., inflated even further by a few tracks with legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker. Corgan's guitar tone remains utterly unique, folding umpteen overdubs into the razor-sharp solos and grinding chords that are recognizable as his from the first note of ""Doomsday Clock"". Chamberlin, meanwhile, bashes with the same enthusiasm of his much younger self, helped by production that isn't afraid to push the drums front and center. I'd be a liar if I didn't admit that it sounds big when compared to the relatively thin, wispy sound of the modern alt-rock competition. Songs like ""Doomsday Clock"" and ""Tarantula"" wave the flag of stoner rock like Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult without embarrassment, and could likely pass for Queens of the Stone Age if it wasn't for that characteristic Corgan whine. On the other hand, this hard-rock approach only used to be one aspect of the Pumpkins persona, call it the ""Zero"" dimension. By focusing only on this portion of the group's character, Corgan misremembers the versatility that launched his band to the A-list: not just guitar-god bludgeoning, but epic psychedelia like ""Rhinoceros"", fragile pop like ""Today,"" wide-screen symphonics like ""Tonight, Tonight"", and synth-loop ballads like ""1979"". Most of those flavors are suspiciously absent on Zeitgeist, making it far more aggressive than any other record in their catalog-- perhaps a preemptive response to charges of getting old and mellow. Unfortunately, that leaves the record rather homogenous; while Corgan still can pull out a melodic surprise (""7 Shades of Black"") or conjure up a dense effects-pedal atmosphere (""That's the Way (My Love Is)""), he lacks for variety. When he tries, the album-closing duo (depending on what chain store you bought the album from, I suppose) of ""For God and Country"" and ""Pomp and Circumstances"" are bland reminders of the synthy midtempo blandness that once tripped up Adore. When he stretches, as on the centerpiece ""United States,"" the result has none of the cosmic magnitude of previous 10+-minute Pumpkins epics, instead opting for a turgid, chugging pace and thimble-deep political commentary. That substitution of political angst for the personal kind is the one nod to maturity on Zeitgeist, though some of the get-happy sloganeering of Zwan persists as well on tracks like ""(Come On) Let's Go!"" Yet Corgan's serrated voice hasn't dulled with age, and unlike the refreshing heaviness of the band's restored sound, it sounds more and more ridiculous, well along the almost-inevitable march of all iconic rock voices towards self-parody. The disconnect between tortured nasality and lyrical content is never more awkward than on lazy tracks like ""Bring the Light"", where Corgan is content to merely whine the title with dozens of different inflections, or the chorus of Billys that backs up ""Starz"". Of course, nobody wants progression from the Smashing Pumpkins, that's the whole point of manufacturing this reunion in the first place. In that sense, Zeitgeist is interesting as a demonstration that the artist himself is usually not be the best person to play historian for his own career. Given the chance to revisit the good old days, Corgan has unearthed only a portion of the Pumpkins character-- and while that portion is meticulously revived, all the parts left behind remain sorely missed. In the end, it's the one-dimensional approach, not the lack of half the original members, that leaves Smashing Pumpkins Mk. II a cardboard cutout of the real thing-- not the empty ATM-reunion it could have been, but still a ghost of the old band.","A comeback of sorts, the only actual reunion taking place here is between Billy Corgan and his most famous brand; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was already involved in both of Corgan's post-Pumpkins projects, and James Iha/D'Arcy preferred to stay in hiding.

These six tracks, remastered and reissued by OxBlood in the band's native Kansas City, Mo., create a fuller picture of a band than many longer albums; at 33 minutes this is an EP bursting at the seams with hefty pieces that boast, indulge, and haunt. At surface level the references are clear: leader Shaun Hamontree is a Tom Waits fanatic, and everywhere are up-to-the-minute contemporary draws-- a Tarantino scene change, a Neko Case bridge, a Low vocal-- that serve as modern touches to gothic artifacts. This can lead us to several neighboring places. For one, the vertiginous funereal comedown of ""The Farm"", which manages to be both the warmest and most alienating of the tracks. At nearly eight minutes it alternately drones on and picks us up, like an unpredictable wind, the mournful vocals switching dominance with a more energetic percussion section, both of which Hamontree conducts with his central and overpowering role at the microphone. So early in the album this song could prophesy a leaden second half, but as it turns out, the band prefer to intersperse tempo ranges, alternating slow, heavily reverbed guitar tracks with the faster, stormier pieces dominated by drums. The musical cues evoked when the four members come together are far more interesting: It's a tumultuous yet controlled breed of rock that appears to communicate deeper than some of the rangy dustbowl guitar solos and explosively sad choruses elsewhere. ""Wither"" is the best example of this, though melodically it's more familiar, with twinkling, ominous arpeggios skittering around thick resolutions in bass and guitar at the chorus. The references in ""Wither"" are as much to sophisticated metal as to country and blues. The bow-out, ""Tension"", has a scintillating beauty that will remind listeners of Explosions in the Sky, whose fascination with simple repetitive guitar lines performed in peaceably empty outer space is transformed here, branded with American Catastrophe's smoke-filled noise-making. A delicate few notes on the electric guitar build up through their own monotony, leading to the inevitable crash and burn of cymbals and bass in the final seconds. As a teaser to what this band is currently working on (these songs were first recorded in 2005), Excerpts is confusingly colorful, painted in various shades of gray and blood red.","Former members of the Black Water and Sky Burial release a remastered set of shoegaze-y, gothic dirges.

Lose All Time,You Say Party,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af985e6ef95969321e23/1:1/w_160/1320002c.jpg,2007-07-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10008-lose-all-time/,Paper Bag,"Since the release of You Say Party! We Say Die!'s first album in 2005, the ante's been upped on their brand of fiery, female-led dance-punk. Blatantly spawned from the Pretty Girls Make Graves/YYYs c. 2004 model of aggro-new wave, their debut, Hit the Floor!, parlayed exclamatory song titles and chic leftist propaganda into a formidable album that dropped at a opportunistic time. The genre hasn't exactly experienced a sea change since, but new acts like Love is All and Be Your Own Pet have necessitated a more nuanced spin for dance party melee albums. Just ask Pretty Girls, Thunderbirds are Now! or Le Tigre-- you can milk one, maybe two, solid records by strictly adhering to the dance-spaz formula, but this fundamentalism ages poorly. Hit the Floor!, as rank and file as it was, provided the band with a number of potential aesthetic tangents for follow-up Lose All Time. They channeled Pretty Girls' complex histrionics while keeping a stake in gritty garage punk and buoyant Hot Hot Heat-style pop-- it was only a matter of further honing the sound that worked best. Lose All Time codifies these influences into a markedly more consistent effort, though the result's still strangely anti-climactic. Enthusiasm and the corresponding exclamation points are noticeably lacking on Lose All Time, and the band appears bent on maturing for maturity's sake. That's not to say sloganeering rockers like ""5 Year Plan"" or ""Poison"" don't have a pulse, but their breakneck austerity, when stretched over the span of an album, grows dull. ""Downtown Mayors Goodnight, Alley Kids Rule!"" and ""Opportunity"", while equipped with their share of explosive basslines and nifty hooks, demonstrate how much the band substitutes rote loud-soft dynamics for more original songwriting. The former even flaunts chorus riffs on an acidic level with Les Savy Fav, but it lacks that band's astute sense of rhythm, conceding instead to a vanilla verse that lackadaisically affixes high-hat sixteenths to a promising bassline. The story of Lose All Time is about what could have been. Right now this album's a great first draft, something to mull over before flipping these well-trodden ideas on their heads. To their credit, the band tries a few change-ups, most notably the faux-Stars track ""Monster"" and raw piano ballad ""Dance Floor Destroyer"". Dance-punk, however, can wear down as quickly as the hand-me-down Zildjian high-hats it features, and YSP!WSD! needs to stop treading water and put together a coup. Almost entirely bereft of Hit the Floor's political and musical quirks, you wouldn't know Lose All Time from a dance-punk Adam-- a shame considering how charming YSP!WSD!'s first impression was.","Album number two from aggro-new wavers sheds a few exclamation points and exhibits signs of maturity, but still retains its share of explosive basslines and nifty hooks.

Let's Drag Our Feet,BOAT,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13ac0084474cd0c1d9f/1:1/w_160/fe98639e.jpg,2007-07-06 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10384-lets-drag-our-feet/,Magic Marker,"Boys with perpetual colds who can kinda-sorta sing, hand claps of the generic indie variety, and the unfettered production made most odious/ingenious by Wolf Parade are three features of BOAT's second album on Magic Marker. This lengthy collection of fuzzy, crackling lo-fi jams does little more than their debut to convince us of the band's merit, but I mean that as a compliment. Their viscous sound, with each instrumental part given equally muffled or tinny weight, at times yields some heavy little rock lullabies. The makeshift, ad-lib familiarity of the songs are, as is often the case with this genre, what makes them accessible and enjoyable; for the melodies to dig to a more sophisticated depth is an added bonus; and for them to avoid the anemic desperation of Spencer Krug is all right, too. As members of Seattle's prolific rock scene, BOAT differentiate themselves most explicitly with songs like ""The Ferocious Sounds of Lobsters and Snakes/Mom, Dad, Me and You"", the first part of which has been floating around the Internet for a couple of years. Here, it takes on a re-recorded cleanliness, the tempo slowed just slightly and the guitar itching for a more substantial role than the easy two-note plucks in the chorus. The lyrics here, as elsewhere on the album, are comfortingly cliché: ""Don't you know, everything will be all right/ Don't you know, everything will be just fine."" The song is dead simple and inexplicably addictive. Such conciliatory ruminations appear in many tracks, but are often unintelligible thanks to the band's penchant for basements. But when the words want to reach us, they really do, albeit as adorably stupid adages: ""All I want's a telephone that rings for free,"" ""There's a lightbulb in your head/ If you break it you'll be dead,"" or a helpful suggestion about not being able to fall asleep if one drinks too many sodas. The lyrics are often role-playing in nature, particularly suggestive of an adult borrowing the voice of his parents to speak to his childhood self. Less enjoyable are the ""ooh""s and handclaps of ""Illustrate the History (When I Grow Up)"", a sound too many times tried and sold, and which here says nothing new. More interesting is what follows, ""The Whistle Test"", which howls a little higher, a bit like Man Man's meowing habit, then slows to a trot for a closely recorded chorus with long keyboard notes that enhance the longing mood. Both the song's colorations, which alternate several times, are sophisticated, the faster portion letting the drums take the spotlight with a quick, complicated rhythm that settles down for the pleasantly dreary chorus. The cheap production of these songs still allows for invention and different shades from the same instrumentation: the wall of noise of the synths in ""Period, Backlash, Colon"", the pretty vocals on ""A Phone that Rings for Free"", or the effects on the lovely closing minutes of ""Gold Veins (This One Hotel)"". Often what collects the drunken mess of the songs into an elegant pile, as in the case of ""Veins"", is D. Crane's vocals, which have the dexterity to volubly pack themselves in or stretch out over the course of the instruments' finicky tempos. But there are only a handful of songs that really delve immediately into our mind's ear and stay there, the rest still benefiting from their intra-song variety and general subversion to predictable structure. Showmates of the Shaky Hands, BOAT offer fewer hits but more keepsakes, with many of their songs becoming more adhesive as they simmer and soften over time.","Seattle trio's second album is a guitar-heavy collection of family snapshots and pretty, lo-fi messes.

Best of Bowie: 1980-1987,David Bowie,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bbb1335d7bf169a184/1:1/w_160/4da8e636.jpg,2007-07-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10274-best-of-bowie-1980-1987/,EMI,"Unlike many of his 70s peers, David Bowie had little trouble adjusting to the 1980s. After all, his career was built upon media-image manipulation entering a decade that, with the advent of MTV, would become obsessed with it. But instead of trying to out-glam the growing legions of synth-pop insurgents copping his old alien/androgyne persona, David Bowie's defining image in this era was to just be David Bowie: a debonair pop idol with pin-up-worthy blond hair, designer suits, movie-star ambitions, and a camera-ready smile that shone brighter than a paparazzi pit. But if the first few years of the 80s saw Bowie score his biggest hits, the latter half found him in danger of losing his relevancy, and faced with the impossibility of sustaining his early, carefully cultivated mystique and vanguard reputation. You can chart this wayward path by his choice of side men: In 1980 his guitarist of choice was Robert Fripp; by 1987 it was Peter Frampton. This third installment of the Best of David Bowie budget-comp series may begin at a year with a nice, round, inaugural number, but with respect to Bowie's discography, 1980 is a somewhat arbitrary entry point. Compared to what followed, the selections from his 1980 signature work Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) feel like the product of another era (not to mention another record company-- it was his last album for RCA before jumping to Virgin). The android funk of ""Fashion"", the Berlin-bound sleaze of ""Scary Monsters"", and the unnerving sing-along ""Up the Hill Backwards"" feel like the closing acts of a Teutonic-soul cycle that began with 1976's Station to Station, while the paranoid ""Ashes to Ashes"" sends the post-hippie/sci-fi idealism of Bowie's glam heyday crashing down to earth. As the ensuing decades have shown, these songs also marked the last time Bowie's pop and avant-garde instincts were so perfectly in sync. Following his triumphant Queen collaboration ""Under Pressure""-- a song so awesome, not even Vanilla Ice could kill it-- the 80s would begin in earnest for Bowie with Let's Dance, whose authoritative title track aptly opens this loosely chronological compilation. For an album so inextricably linked to the year 1983, its MTV-saturated singles hardly bear the musty scent of retro artifacts: On his 2002 Heathen tour, Bowie performed a veritable live mash-up of ""Modern Love"", grafting the song's melody onto the galloping guitar groove of the Strokes' ""Someday"", perhaps as a sly nod to the New York newbies' copying skills, but also to remind us of the song's ageless bounce. Like Bowie's production work on Raw Power 10 years earlier, the Let's Dance redux of his 1977 Iggy Pop co-write ""China Girl"" was a goodwill gesture to boost the earning potential of his down-and-out buddy, but Bowie's more dignified performance has surpassed Iggy's original as the definitive take (although its bare-ass video may have given it an unfair advantage). Amid the hair-raising ""Twist and Shout"" teases of ""Let's Dance"", you almost overlook the uncanny contrast between the song's alluring, horny-funk accents and Bowie's leering, almost dread-ridden delivery. The enduring appeal of Let's Dance is all the more remarkable when placed next to the poorly dated quality of Bowie's remaining 80s output. On previous Best of David Bowie installments, the obvious hits were supplemented by well-curated album tracks, but the paucity of exemplary material from 1984's Tonight (a.k.a. Let's Dance Some More) and 1987's Never Let Me Down don't provide much of an opportunity for reassessment: With its faux-steel-drum refrain and synth-polished easy-rock groove, Tonight's ""Loving the Alien"" is hardly the epic its seven-minute run time suggests, while Never Let Me Down's ""Day-In Day-Out"" captured Bowie in the unfortunate position of playing catch-up to Duran Duran three years too late. Additionally, the compilation is padded with Bowie's middling soundtrack contributions of the era, some of which hold up on the strength of the songwriting (the proto-Pulp soul of ""Absolute Beginners"", for instance), but several of which can't shake off their oh-so-80s accoutrement (the proto-Enigma new-age gothisms of ""This Is Not America"" from The Falcon and the Snowman, or the goofy ersatz gospel of Labyrinth's ""Underground""). But hey, things could be worse-- thanks to this compilation's 1987 cut-off date, we're spared the task of reconsidering Tin Machine.","This third installment of this budget-comp series starts with selections from his last ""1970s"" record, Scary Monsters, before picking highlights from David Bowie's chart-aiming 80s work.

Rushup Edge EP,The Tuss,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14c5e6ef959693220d8/1:1/w_160/b979bee1.jpg,2007-07-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10401-rushup-edge-ep/,Rephlex,"A quick introductory note for those with only a passing interest in home-listening electronic music: The Tuss is a new project on Rephlex that, due to a string of associations in the CD notes and various related MySpace pages, appears to have been authored at least in part (and probably completely) by Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin. If it turns out that someone other than James created the Tuss tracks, it was a brilliant hoax, complete with clues-- such as James hailing from Cornwall and ""The Tuss"" being Cornish slang for an erection-- scattered in all the right places. We don't know for sure if Rushup Edge is James' work, but it certainly sounds like a continuation of and expansion upon the ground covered two years ago with dogged thoroughness on the 11-volume Analord series. But where that project maintained clear aesthetic boundaries, in which tracks were generally grounded in early techno and electro and timbres were derived from analog synths, the tracks on Rushup Edge feel more open and less tied to orthodoxy. While the quality of the sounds still loosely refers to the late 1980s up through the mid-90s, there's a brisker, more breakbeat-driven approach to rhythm and less focus on repetition compared to the Analord project. The first two tracks in particular are packed with nimble but deceptively complex variation, and seem especially suggestive of James' programming and compositional virtuosity. ""Synthacon 9"" is almost six-and-a-half minutes of propulsive techno, but it dashes by in as instant, so full of ideas the track can't contain them. Every bar or two another element is introduced-- a grinding acid bass riff, bright synths neatly inverting the pattern, a brief rainfall of electronic handclaps, some indecipherable vocodered vocals-- and each is perfectly balanced, eminently logical but still surprising. ""Last Rushup 10"" also zips along at a good clip, churning through loads of compelling bass and drum interplay. Then, all of a sudden, a self-conscious but undeniably catchy ""Far East"" melody played on a lone synth appears, an escapee from a Yellow Magic Orchestra track, and from then on everything else plays out in relation to this new tune. A pretty nifty trick. The first two tracks are near-masterpieces in James' (or anyone else's) oeuvre, so it's not surprising that the rest of the EP doesn't quite conform to the same standard. But everything else is listenable and interesting in its own way. ""Shiz Ko E"" is comparatively straight electro with unusual use of a warped and queasy vocal, while ""Rushup I Bank 12"" seamlessly melds acid bass, rough breakbeats, and piano in a disorienting but beautiful tapestry. The abrasive percussion workout ""Death Fuck"" is a bit more trying-- its solo piano interlude sounds tacked-on-- while the closing ""Goodbye Rute"" is spare, ghostly, and pleasingly alien. The latter is closer in spirit to a couple of the excerpted tracks currently found on the Tuss MySpace page, none of which are included here. They suggest another side to whoever is behind this thing: one closer-- whadayah know?-- to the more melodic side of a certain Richard D. James. Stay tuned.","Strongly believed to be a new project authored at least in part-- and probably completely-- by Richard D. James, aka the Aphex Twin, this certainly sounds like a continuation of and expansion upon the ground covered two years ago with dogged thoroughness on the 11-volume Analord series.

Well Well Well,The Safes,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13d5e6ef959693220be/1:1/w_160/673a96f3.jpg,2007-07-05 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10387-well-well-well/,O'Brothers,"How hard can it be to make listenable power pop? It seems like it's pretty difficult to screw up. Sure, you can mutate the blueprint slightly-- maybe get a geeky, adenoidal romantic to front your band like the Modern Lovers or have a distinct sense of underlying melancholy like Badfinger-- but just so long as you can find that happy medium between the British Invasion and new wave, you'll be just about set. The hooks pretty much write themselves, penning clever lyrics takes a backseat to singing them with a loveable-rogue bravado, and there's just enough rhythmic, riff-sustained momentum in two-and-a-half minutes to keep the song stuck to listeners' forebrains for about three times that long. But most dedicated music fans tend to gravitate towards evolutionary steps forward rather than artisan-quality traditional formula, which leads to the inevitable question: Is there something worthwhile in a band that's good at doing something really simple and exceedingly familiar? That being asked, here are the Safes: They do nothing you haven't heard before, and they do it better than most. The outfit from Chicago-- centered around brothers/multi-instrumentalists/vocalists Frankie, Michael, and Patrick O'Malley-- have operated as a modernized power pop throwback for most of this decade, assuming that anyone who operates in a genre that's consistently existed from the Raspberries to Greg Kihn to Fountains of Wayne can be feasibly deemed a ""throwback."" Well Well Well fits that continuum neatly, rarely pushing the envelope much further than the conceits that Cheap Trick are godhead and the pre-Village Green Preservation Society Kinks could've used a few more volts in 'em. It's a plan they pull off well, even if they lack some of the things that make their peers singular. There's not much of the New Pornographers' unpredictable artiness or the Exploding Hearts' speaker-rupturing hyperactivity in their repertoire-- think more along the lines of the Nerves and the Quick and other abruptly-named, fleetingly-extant late 70s merchants of simple-but-mesmerizing pop. Most of the record's pull is in the vocals, a close-harmonizing blur of nasal sneers and surly misery that says more about the ups-and-mostly-downs of distrust and romantic frustration than the words do. Not that the lyrics are always an afterthought-- there are some evocatively bitter phrases running through the titular choruses of ""Since Trust Went Bust"" and ""Bliss This Instance""-- but they're usually so bluntly straightforward (""Only in Your Mind"" actually opens with the phrase ""Now no matter what I do/ You think I am in love with you"") and half-buried in the mix that the only thing that really comes across distinctively in the voices is their perfect tone of contempt. There are probably worse things to muddy up the vocals than the Safes' instrumentation, though, which answers the what-if of the Raconteurs as a Jack White-less power trio. Even if most of their reference points predate the Reagan administration, there's a decent variety of styles: ""Phone Book Full of Phonies"" takes glam-stomp's boogie and strips out all the excess weight to make it run faster, ""Deception"" condenses the limber debauchery of early 70s Rolling Stones into 1:47, and ""Bliss This Instance"" takes the aforementioned Kinks-circa-'66 vibe to a raucous, horn-filled conclusion. It's all done with a workmanlike rock-vet professionalism, and while it's somewhat unremarkable in itself, the Safes do pull off an interesting feat: creating an album that's unsurprising without actually being boring.","Chicago power-pop band-- centered around a trio of multi-instrumentalist brothers-- craft well-executed songs, rarely pushing the envelope much further than the conceits that Cheap Trick are godhead and the pre-Village Green Preservation Society Kinks could've used a few more volts in 'em.

Because Plastic Bag in the Tree, the first and quite possibly only album by the Flash Hawk Parlor Ensemble, blends down-home guitars and spacey synths as if they were recorded between episodes of ""Firefly"". Or, perhaps more likely, between Neighborhood Watch Association meetings: headed by Chris Funk, of Decemberists and ""Colbert Report"" fame, the Ensemble includes many of his Portland neighbors, who reportedly held loose, impromptu jams on the Funks' front porch. The result is an album of instrumentals (Does Funk sing? He does everything else.) that blend the organic and the synthetic in a way that's not necessarily unique, but weirdly charming all the same. The Ensemble won't ever be anyone's day job, but it's a quaint diversion. The songs' guitars, courtesy of Funk and George T. Drag, have a dusty wagon trail stateliness that's usually at odds with the album's extraterrestrial blips and squiggles-- the ""sound shapes,"" as the liners call them. Opener ""Chained to the Pole"" could easily provide the expository text crawl for a homemade re-shoot of Star Wars, and ""The System of Your Choice"" sounds like two R2 units gettin' it on. The pensively plucked acoustic theme on ""Can't See the Moon? Cut Down the Tree"" is interrupted by what sounds like the rush of an unsealed airlock, but live instrumentation doesn't always connote earthliness on Plastic Bag, nor do the sonic baubles always suggest spaceship mechanics. Victor Paul Nash's halting trumpet on ""Sleep at Last!"" sounds like ladies and gentlemen floating in space, while Mark Petty's forlorn horn makes Ray Davies' ""I Go to Sleep"" seem as curious as ""Fantastic Planet"". The Ensemble also cover Massive Attack's ""Teardrop"", but even better is Radiohead's ""Amnesiac/Morning Bell"" performed on banjo and dulcimer, which effectively deflates the original's posthuman pretensions. By ""Not Always Your Best Friend"", which is punctuated by mechano-canine barks, the album starts to seem like a shaggy-dog campfire story-- overlong and a little repetitive. But Plastic Bag in the Tree is not the space detritus it could easily have been. Some judicious editing might have pared the album down to a more manageable length, but would have also gone against the spirit of the endeavor, whose endearing traits are its loose and loopy geniality, its pick-up session informality, its head-beyond-the-clouds whimsy.","Loose instrumental project from Decemberists' Chris Funk effectively combines dusty wagon trail stateliness with extraterrestrial blips and squiggles.

Their steadfast loyalty to up-front pop puts them in a bizarre place about halfway between the Betas and Dodgy, both of whom they occasionally resemble, but the quality of their material gives them the strength to stand on their own. Originally a duo of multi-instrumentalists from the Isle of Wight, A Band of Bees these days is a sextet of multi-instrumentalists, and Octopus, their third album, spills over with psychedelic playfulness and splotches of vintage r&b. The album's worldview seems to be summed up in one of its own song titles, ""(This Is for the) Better Days"", which, judging from the production, occurred sometime between 1965 and 1974. The lead guitar has a bit of a Stax/Steve Cropper sound, rooted to a funky drumbeat and Rhodes groove, and the big harmonies on the chorus nod to freakbeat and the moment when British psych was just about to tip into early prog. The band's r&b edge is a key component of several of the album's best songs, including ""Listening Man"", which retrofits a Memphis backbeat with horns and sublimely loose three-part harmony. ""Left Foot Stepdown"" does even better, tying a tremendous brass arrangement with a Spanish tinge to a choppy beat and some superb organ playing. The harmony vocals slot in when the horn part is about halfway to Seville, and the band dubs out the breakdown after the second chorus. Plenty of bands seem to forget that having memorable instrumental parts makes the vocal parts more memorable, but that's not a lesson lost on the Bees, who consistently hook you before even opening their mouths. ""Got to Let Go"" has a killer organ riff from the Rod Argent playbook, which it echoes in the sax-heavy horn arrangement. The drumbeat is a relentless modified shuffle that sweeps everything swiftly along. There are very few misplaced steps on the album-- from the opening slide guitar riff all the way to end it gives you things to latch onto. Closer ""End of the Street"" is the weakest offering, mostly for the fact that it tries too hard to be eccentric and loopy. But a poorly conceived ending can't obscure that Octopus is a fun, supremely engaging album of modern psych-pop.","Melting down the 1960s and 70s and pressing them into something new, this English band's third full-length is an engaging collection of modern psych-pop.

The Blue Thumb Recordings,Love,by: Stephen M.

Strongly influenced by the baroque folk-pop of the Byrds, his smart, steely psychedelia conveyed a dark vision of hippie America-- a distinct contrast to the good vibrations typically associated with the Summer of Love. That was the same year-- 1967, for those of you who don't read Rolling Stone (which I think might be everybody)-- that Lee and his band Love released its scene-paranoid masterpiece Forever Changes, on which he painted himself as a true L.A. outsider, haunting the scrub-brush hills and looking deep into the dark heart of the city around him. In those songs, he foretells his own doom, and everyone else's: On ""The Red Telephone"", he sings, ""Sitting on the hillside/ Watching all the people die/ I'll feel much better on the other side."" Following Forever Changes, Lee dissolved the now-classic Love line-up-- including songwriter Bryan McLean and childhood friend Johnny Echols-- and reformed the band with an entirely different cast of characters for his final Elektra album, Four Sail, in 1969. Lacking Echols' effortless inventiveness on guitar, Jay Donnellan was a perfect foil for Lee, and the rhythm section of Frank Fayad on bass and George Suranovich on drums lent a lean menace to their jams. Lee originally intended Four Sail as an epic double album, but the label whittled it down to a short ten tracks, including opener ""August"" and closer ""Always See Your Face"". The remaining tracks were released by Bob Krasnow's Blue Thumb Records three months later as Out Here, followed by False Start in 1970. These two albums, only sporadically in print since then, have now been remastered and collected on a 3xCD, limited-edition set by Hip-O Select, which also includes a concert's worth of previously unreleased live tracks and strangely cursory liner notes by Dave Thompson. Imperfect but fascinating, these albums-- and this set-- are essential listening for Love fans, tracking Lee's sad decline into the 70s. Neither of these albums live up to the standards set by Love's Da Capo and Forever Changes LPs and early singles. There are many more digressions, failed experiments, and too much general fucking around, all of which is heightened by Lee's pointed bitterness. Nevertheless, there are moments of genuine and heartbreaking clarity on all three discs in this set, when Lee speaks creatively and strongly or when the band hits an effortless groove. Out Here ranges wildly, with two tracks passing the 11-minute mark (including a pointless rehearsal-level drum solo from Suranovich) and twice that many fall short of two minutes. Opener ""I'll Pray for You"" is immediately poppy and playful, reminiscent of Love's pre-Changes output; its catchy, multilayered call-and-response hook might best be described as jangle gospel. The sing-songy melody of ""Abalony"" works better than the military marching band parody on the embarrassing ""Discharged"" or the lengthy freak-outs on the tiring ""Doggone"" and ""Love Is More Than Words or Better Late Than Never"". The sequencing is awkward, too, making the album seem like more of a mess than it really is and further highlighting Lee's caginess: ""Once I had a singing group/ Singing group done gone,"" he remarks on ""Doggone"". ""Now I got another group/ Didn't take too long."" This new Love isn't a pop band, but a rock band, and Lee's hostility toward his listeners and fellow bandmates makes the band's name strikingly ironic. Lee's eclecticism serves him much better on False Start, which is generally a much more palatable album than its predecessor. Lee and his group-- with Gary Rowles replacing Donnellan-- jump playfully among styles, from the relatively sunny soul of ""Keep On Shining"" to the Sly Stone funk of ""Love Is Coming"" to the simple, lively folk-pop of ""Flying"". Opener ""The Everlasting First"", which features Jimi Hendrix playing (but not singing), begins abruptly, jostling the listener into Lee's world, then segues suddenly into ""Flying"", as if it's only a snippet of an infinite song. The live version of ""Stand Out"" actually begins in the fade-out of ""Gimi a Little Break"", with Lee introducing the song to a lively audience. The studio version of ""Stand Out"" originally appeared on Out Here, but it seemed lost on that overly busy album. Here it sounds like a near-perfect piece of slyly subversive funk-rock, urging listeners to ""stand out!"" rather than assimilate into a crowd. On these two albums, Lee repeatedly refers to other artists and other songs, which doesn't anchor him to the mainstream culture but reiterates his underground detachment. This constant dissociation heightens the lively tension on the live disc, which was recorded at various stops on the band's 1970 tour of England. Like the studio version that closes Out Here, ""Gather 'Round"" appropriates the melody from Dylan's ""The Times They Are A'Changin'"", not out of laziness but as a pointed commentary on the death of that generation's idealism. Lee thrives on complication and contradiction: As either a supremely cynical or a playful gesture, he turns the song into an impromptu cover of Wilson Pickett's ""Funky Broadway"". Similarly, he performs songs from every Love album (including a particularly caustic ""Bummer in the Summer"" from Forever Changes) as a means of acknowledging his past glories as well as his fraught history. Live, this version of Love sounds like a band mustering the conviction to take on the world one more time. But they never did: Lee disbanded the line-up shortly after the tour. Love would barely see the 70s, except as a series of failed reunions.","The late Arthur Lee's eclecticism is on display on this 3xCD collection, which features two of his band's post-peak LPs, Out Here and False Start, plus a disc of live performances recorded in England in 1970.

T.I. vs. T.I.P.,T.I.,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b147c0084474cd0c1db8/1:1/w_160/4342446b.jpg,2007-07-05 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10397-ti-vs-tip/,AtlanticGrand Hustle,"On last year's King, T.I.'s scrappy street-kid swagger seemed indivisible from his pop instincts, and that's partly why it was one of the year's best rap albums. On older records like 2003's Trap Muzik, T.I. built an image of himself as a haunted, remorseful drug-dealer, balancing triumphant anthems like ""Rubberband Man"" with sad, introspective laments like ""Be Better Than Me"". By the time he released King, though, the emotional resonance was all but gone from his music, replaced by a world-conquering confidence unmatched in rap. Titanic bangers like ""What You Know"" and ""Top Back"" didn't work in spite of T.I.'s guttural sneer; they used that harshness as fuel. But T.I.'s new album, T.I. vs. T.I.P. operates on the thin and dubious concept that T.I. the businessman and T.I.P. the unreformed hustler are two completely different entities, and that the strain of balancing the two personas is enough to tear Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. apart. Apparently, those two sides aren't as indivisible as they once seemed. T.I. first explored this dichotomy on Trap Muzik's ""T.I. vs. T.I.P."", crafting an argument that movingly dramatized his internal struggle. That struggle also serves as the concept for the new album: T.I.P. gets the first seven tracks, T.I. the next seven, and the two sides spend the last four songs hashing out their differences. It's an interesting conceit, but it doesn't really work as a hook for an entire album, and the record's exhaustingly long running time pushes the conceit far past the breaking point. For one thing, it's a pacing disaster; by lining up all his sugary for-the-ladies tracks in a row, T.I. leaves a long dead-streak in the second half of the album. For another, it plays against his strengths. His music works best when both sides of his personality are allowed to co-exist in the same track. When they're separated, they both sound emaciated and half-formed. And he never quite commits to the concept. If T.I. represents the rapper's pop half, why do the album's first two singles come from the T.I.P. section? If the album's final stretch is meant to unite both sides, why do they confront each other in song only once, on the second verse of ""Respect My Hustle""? Unsurprisingly, the strongest stretch of the album comes from T.I.P. On songs like the underwhelming first single ""Big Shit Poppin'"" and the clichéd drug-dealer instruction-manual ""Da Dopeman"", the rapper seems to be on autopilot, but a few of the T.I.P. tracks would've been highlights even on King. On ""You Know What It Is"", he rides Wyclef Jean's sublimely summery rubber bassline, intuitively sinking into the beat and savoring the sound of his voice. ""Watch What You Say"" boasts a bluesy organic thump and the most authoritative Jay-Z guest-verse in a couple of years, and T.I.'s throaty snarl conveys menace infectiously. On ""Hurt"", he keeps pace with Danja's royal horns and riotous drums and the fiery guest-verses from Alfamega and (surprisingly) Busta Rhymes. The T.I. suite doesn't fare so well, partly because its mere existence positions it as a compromise. T.I.'s cruise-ship money-talk never feels as urgent as his grimy side, and bored and lazy guest-verses from Eminem and Nelly-- both of whom sound like shadows of their former selves-- don't help anything. The best that can be said about the T.I. section is that it mostly doesn't sound all that different from the T.I.P. section; beats from Just Blaze and the Runners are as convincingly hard as anything elsewhere, and T.I. uses the same cadence and delivery whether he's talking about spending money or killing you. If the final act works more consistently than the previous two, it's more because of its two slyly synthetic Danja beats than because of any trenchant insights the rapper comes up with. Even if the concept falls flat, though, T.I. vs. T.I.P. still warrants a listen, if only because T.I. seems constitutionally incapable of releasing an album full of uncompelling music. As a rapper, he's still a dominant voice; his slurry, guttural drawl is a great instrument, and always keeps it deep in the track's pocket, occasionally whipping out tricky double-time patterns or murmuring singsong melodies. The album is perhaps best heard in chunks; only a few of these songs wouldn't sound great on shuffle. Heard as a piece, though, the album's momentum sputters and dies more than once; after a few consecutive listens, T.I. sounds dour and joyless, like he's just punching the clock. Shortly after the release of King, T.I.'s friend Philant Johnson was shot dead after a nightclub brawl between T.I.'s entourage and some Cincinnati thugs. After Johnson's death, T.I. mentioned that the business of rapping no longer felt good and admitted that he was seriously considering quitting music altogether. On T.I. vs. T.I.P., he repeatedly makes reference to Johnson, and indeed he rarely displays the spark and verve that gave King much of its power. T.I. vs. T.I.P. may be self-obsessed and self-indulgent, but maybe T.I. needed to make this album to keep himself interested. Let's hope he's gotten it out of his system.","The follow-up to King-- one of 2006's best rap albums-- works on the thin and dubious concept that T.I. the businessman and T.I.P. the unreformed hustler are two completely different entities, and that the strain of balancing the two personas is enough to tear Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. apart.

On the Plains,Fourth of July,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b134c0084474cd0c1d95/1:1/w_160/a77b1ce6.jpg,2007-07-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10379-on-the-plains/,Range Life,"You'll get along just fine with Brendan Hangauer. The frontman of Lawrence, Kan., septet Fourth of July, Hangauer knows what it's like to be an under-30, hopelessly romantic Midwestern kid who likes to party and address last night's regrets in fleet verses and big, grinning choruses lined with rock'n'roll guitars and handclap rhythms. After all, Hangauer is an under-30 white kid from the Midwest, and so-- on Fourth of July's endearing debut, Fourth of July on the Plains-- that's exactly how he writes, sings and arranges. Even if you don't identify with his demographic or his particular plight-- trying to balance a long-distance romance and his own vices-- you'll likely understand the feelings they bring. Hangauer's not a brainy writer, or at least that's what he wants you to think. He's fine settling for plainspoken aphorisms (""Goodbye's a hard word to use"" and ""Love can make you do some crazy things"") and lazy end rhyme (""Do I still want her? Now that I'm free/ Like a tree/ And my roots so deep""), writing afternoon-after songs about getting way too drunk and trying not to fall in love with girls he shouldn't go home with. Instead, he watches movies where the characters look like her and himself or locks himself in his house and drinks until he calls her in France and says stupid things. Maybe you've been this person? His band's not brilliant, either: The drums are simple, steadfast rock beats; the bass lines are roots and steps; horns slice in and above the best anthems; the guitars are, at their most effective, simple and predictable. When they're not, they sound uncomfortable, like an inexperienced Nels Cline twisting his way through Kicking Television without the tempering experience of Geraldine Fibbers. It's not a look Fourth of July wears well, so-- luckily-- they generally forego it. Rather, they do comfortable empathy the best, but they get away with twisting a lot of kinks into such simplicity. These are smartly arranged songs with multiple points of entry, fitting for a guy like Hangauer, who writes with ingenious wit and charm. Like, in ""Surfer Dude"", he imagines tracking his paramour to France, and finding her there, about to cheat. ""I watch him help you with your French/ As the season skips the spring."" There's the wink. ""And he whispers he can teach you how to surf."" The nod. ""And I yell, 'I know what that means.'"" And there's the massive headshake of anxiety. You know what he means, too, right? Some will lament that Fourth of July isn't as good as the Weakerthans, and they'll be completely right. As a band, the Weakerthans-- sharp, expert, taut-- tried things Fourth of July doesn't even aspire to with On the Plains. And, lyrically, Weakerthans' frontman John K. Samson flexed smarts Hangauer would say he doesn't even have (he'd be lying?). When Samson needed to excuse himself from an awkward social encounter on Reconstruction Site, he explained his dogs needed to be fed before noting that his acquaintance looked like early 20th century explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. Then things got interesting. When Hangauer's agitated, he drinks, picks up the phone, or thinks about making love. But it is worth noting that Hangauer gets something right that Samson-- unlike many of his sloppier peers-- nails, too. Like a keen, imaginative novelist or a fastidious journalist, Samson drops tiny narrative details in his best songs like signposts-- batteries stolen from fire alarms, darker grays breaking through lighter ones, the sight of nervous hands in tense conversations. Similarly, Hangauer is obsessed with weather and memories. He notes that he was only half a mile from his house when he made the decision to drink with strangers instead of make out with his girlfriend, and, when he professes that the telephone makes him feel less alone during ""She's in Love"", you listen to Hangauer apologize to her in France. ""Your dreams, they are more important than us,"" he sings, trapped in the melody and lying through his teeth. He's the same guy that notes the sun shines for her when she walks down the street or says that he can't cheat and claims that he'll help her move to New York when she's ready. Indeed, this Hangauer is a good guy. You'll get along just fine.","Kansas native Brendan Hangauer is a hopelessly romantic Midwestern kid who likes to party and address last night's regrets in fleet verses and big, grinning choruses.

Amateur,Alog,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1369d034d5c69bf49b7/1:1/w_160/4178faae.jpg,2007-07-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10381-amateur/,Rune Grammofon,"If you count the 2005 rarities comp Catch that Totem!, this is the fifth full-length by Alog, the Norwegian duo of Espen Sommer Eide and Dag-Are Haugan. Its title is apparently derived in part from the fact that many of the tracks were made using instruments neither member knows how to play. Such an approach by these two certainly makes sense. They are sound freaks, fascinated by the emotional potential of timbre, always searching for interesting things happening inside the hyphen that typically joins the words ""electro"" and ""acoustic"", so proper technique seems beside the point. When they are at their best, they make to my ears some of the most thrilling experimental music of this decade. Alog albums have tended to feel like hodgepodges, where the best of what was left after a long period of tinkering was put together without much thought, but Amateur seems more cohesive thematically. They're making greater use of acoustic sounds here-- particularly a wide assortment of percussion, and also a good amount of guitar-- and a few more tracks than usual feature the human voice. Silence is also more of a presence, and the prevailing mood is low-key and reserved. At one extreme on that score is the aptly titled ""Sleeping Instruments"". It's not completely without sound, but you'll need a low noise floor in your apartment to hear the tiny creaks and scrapes happening far away from the microphone. Or maybe that was just my ceiling fan. ""Exit Virtuoso"", ""A Throne for the Common Man"", and ""The Learning Curve"" all use gamelan percussion, and the latter two make use of various guitars as textural devices. ""The Future of Norwegian Wood"" captures what seems to be the groans of a tree branch being stressed by a couple on a rope swing mixed with electronic beeps and the rustling of unnamable bric-a-brac, until voices enter spitting out syllables halfway between a whisper and a chant. These are all tracks of interest, with lots of space around the sounds and plenty of time to soak everything in. But there's not much going on in terms of composition, no sense that each element is in its place for a compelling reason. In one sense there is something liberating about this quasi-random approach, in that the tracks seem malleable and open, basically tossing back to the listener whatever he or she puts in. Heard from another angle, these pieces can sound like raw material from a Matmos recording session, the scraps waiting to be hammered into shape by a record's overriding concept. So the tracks that hold up best to repeated listens are the ones heavier on electronics, the rude bits that don't quite seem to fit with what's going on around them. ""Bedlam Emblem"" is cranky and abrasive, lots of upper-mid electronic squeals surrounded by halos of static, and it clomps around in an unpredictable way but it also builds, gaining momentum as it presses forward. And ""The Beginner"", despite its marked similarity to ""St. Paul Sessions II"" from the band's 2005 album Miniatures, manages to wring serious tension out of its unblinking repetition. Amateur is certainly a decent record, but those moments offering a glimpse at the breathtaking possibilities of pure sound, which made the last two Alog records so special, are sorely missed.","This often excellent Norwegian duo's fifth album features numerous tracks made using instruments neither member knows how to play, an oddly fitting approach for a couple of guys who often explore the intersection between the electronic and the acoustic.

Au,AU,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b139b1335d7bf169a244/1:1/w_160/e74e2acf.jpg,2007-07-03 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10383-au/,AagooOedipus,"Portland's Luke Wyland seems aware that, despite the attempts of many poets and songwriters over time to prove otherwise, the natural world is not, in fact, simple. At any given time, billions of births, growths, reproductions, and deaths are simultaneously happening, and an attempt to take it all in is impossible at best. But, nevertheless, Wyland-- with a group of Oregonian collaborators in tow-- approaches nature with a broad scope: The sound design on his eponymous debut under this name feels composed by his amplification of the taken-for-granted. His process, unconscious as it might be, leads to an album of free music that is dynamic and serene; songs guided by an understanding of the bucolic that grasps its elegance as well as its occasional tumult. Wyland is a classically-trained pianist, and the instrument's inventive incorporation couples with his unique treatment of stringed noisemakers to lend Au an intriguing baroque and experimental sensibility. On the patient instrumental ""Shelter"", a saloon-tuned piano slowly rises from a murk of rolling drone, anticipating the jingling, druidic-style chant at its climax. Album-closing ""Ask the River"" resembles the rhythmic explorations of composer Arnold Dreyblatt, whose unique timbral inclination led him to, among other things, string upright basses with piano wire and strike them until they came together. ""River"" feels like a rural cousin of Dreyblatt's Nodal Excitation; acutely plucked strings slowly accumulate, eventually coalescing into a distinguishable chime of their own. For simple genre-placement purposes, Au can be grouped with what's generally referred to as ""avant-folk."" The record's first two songs especially stand out in this regard, with a strong resemblance to the howling revelry of Animal Collective. ""Boute"" and ""Sum"" feel like Feels-- cresting toward intense, sun-scorched melodic moments, then receding into incessant tick-tacks and smeared snarls of instrumentation-- and establish ideas that reappear in various guises throughout the record. ""Boute"" opens with a clacking rhythm guiding an elegant piano motif, before Wyland's partially discernible vocals expand and lead the song skyward. Only for a moment, however; in one fell swoop, all vanishes save the piano, leaving the song to rise again, which it does magnificently. ""Sum"" takes an even more suite-like approach, beginning with an intense fanfare that abruptly gives way to a brief ukelele, which also suddenly stops. Zoë Wright's weightless vocals glide over a frolicking foundation of toy piano and increasingly hyperactive strings, and the whole thing breaks into a canter. The song ends as a radiant hootenanny, a blustery tribal tangle that threatens to explode, but instead gracefully glides back to earth. Sarah Winchester (A Weather) contributes vocals to the slow-burning ""Death"", which highlights Au's Appalachian underpinnings, and demonstrates that often, on the other side of the blinding light is waiting a somber black. In stark contrast to what came before it, ""Death"" is all empty space and sepulchral sentiment, as Winchester and Wyland's lament drags forward like a horse-drawn coffin: ""Bring me my death/ Bring me my shadow."" The instrumental ""Remain"" follows ""Death"" like a time-lapse of ivy growing on a headstone: Resonating piano notes, buzzing plucked strings, and percussive miscellany slowly mature and fill space, accelerated when a menacing drum and threatening high-pitched rattle appear suddenly. Visitors to Au's website seeking a proper pronunciation of the group's name are informed by Wyland that how it's said is up to them. The same standard could be applied to Wyland's music under the mysterious moniker, as well. Au is both expansive and accessible enough that it leads listeners to take from it what they feel comfortable with, or to read themselves in his arrangements. For a record so entranced with an en plein air approach to music making, it refreshingly offers the opportunity to leave a unique footprint.","Portland's Luke Wyland, with the help of some friends, makes an engaging  avant-folk album inspired by the taken-for-granted elements of the natural world.

What Is?!,King Khan,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b133b1335d7bf169a238/1:1/w_160/001c9416.jpg,2007-07-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10378-what-is/,Hazelwood,"If there's any doubt in your mind that King Khan's got a smirk on his face throughout the entirety of What Is?!, take a listen to the lyrics of its final track, ""The Ballad of Lady Godiva"": ""The sex was so simple/ I swear I saw God/ On the top of white mountains/ On the top of my rod."" Even then, with a breath of relief that sounds more like early hiss-soaked Sebadoh than the gods of rock and soul Khan exhaustively pays tribute to throughout the record, it retains its musty vintage charm and spiky sense of humor. There's a reason Atlanta upstarts Black Lips cited Montreal's King Khan's other band, the BBQ Show, as recent favorites, and it's not just their shared affinity for Nuggets box sets and Eric Burdon. Both bands are more than just revivalists, but pranksters too, from their tongue-in-cheek lyrics, unpredictable live shows, impenetrable self-mythologizing press, and ""live"" albums (yeah, ok, you got me). Buying into the act isn't just a question of suspending disbelief and taking their hand for a magic carpet ride; it's being willing to smile after the shock of the hand buzzer. Thing is, the gritty production of this latest Shrines record might beat Black Lips in the painstaking reproduction department, and underneath that analog hiss is a clever pastiche that hits those nostalgia buttons while sneaking in moments of cacophony and synthesis. ""69 Faces of Love"" adds strings and brass to cool ""Love Potion No. 9""-style rock before a layered and bewildering bridge that's like a middle-school marching band taking on Steve Reich. Elsewhere, Khan plays a bizarro-world James Brown who demands only bum notes from his band on the breakdown of ""Land of the Freak"", and ""In Your Grave"", with its bubbling wah-wah over a simmering rhythm section, is another sly nod to the future (or at least the early 1970s). No need to underline those moments, though, when you've got pitch-perfect 60s pop like ""Welfare Bread"" and ""I See Lights"" and horn-laden hard-rock like ""(How Can I Keep You) Outta Harms Way"". Innovation's just as important here as finding the right second to shout ""guitar!"" before the solo (check ""No Regrets""). The retro shtick almost becomes a spoonful of sugar to make their cross-pollination go down, with the only explicitly adventurous moments being the Eastern-nodding psychedelic globe-boner of ""Cosmic Serenade"" and the French-sung ""Le Fils de Jacques Dutronc"", their tribute to a similarly scornful garage rocker and maybe the only hint that this band is Canadian. Rather than making the audience the butt of their prank, What Is?! becomes a joke that anyone can enjoy without necessarily being in on. There's no reason you should take this record more seriously than the King himself, and no reason you can't embrace it: What Is?! is goofy, affecting, nostalgic, and cathartic all at once, at every moment.","With a musty vintage charm and spiky sense of humor this Montreal-based guitar punk band is-- along with Icky Thump, Black Lips, Jay Reatard, and the solo work of King Khan collaborator Mark Sultan-- breathing life back into good old fashioned rock'n'roll.

Grow Up and Blow Away,Metric,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13bc0084474cd0c1da2/1:1/w_160/d58367bd.jpg,2007-07-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10385-grow-up-and-blow-away/,Last Gang,"Metric are a band of geopolitical extremes. Frontperson Emily Haines was born in India, raised in Canada, and eventually wound up splitting her time between London and Brooklyn, where she and Metric guitarist James Shaw once lived with future members of Liars and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Haines, a vocal critic of consumer society, also licenses her songs to television dramas and Polaroid commercials (a bowdlerized version of the title track from Grow Up and Blow Away was used to promote I-Zone film). In fact, Metric's songs are often characterized by a commercial sheen-- they're smart little packets that, even as anti-consumerism screeds, have a compact luster that makes you feel like getting online to price experimental shelving units from Ikea or browsing all-over print hoodies at H&M. None of this is to criticize Metric for hypocrisy, it's simply to position them as a band that has no qualms about jockeying for visibility-- in the process amassing reams of the sort of context that can sometimes drown out a band's music. So you might know Metric for any of the reasons above, or from Emily Haines' solo project, Emily Haines and Soft Skeleton, or from her otherworldly vocal turn on Broken Social Scene's beloved ""Anthem for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"". And yeah, you might also know them as yet another band in the Broken Social Scene constellation, although they more closely resemble the glossy electro-pop of Stars. But this album, Metric's lost debut of sorts, gives us a chance to get to know them more intimately-- as a charming singer/songwriterly band poised to arrive a little too late for the 1990s alterna-rock boom, when they would have fit in snugly with bubble-poppers, like Letters to Cleo, and scorers of imaginary films, like Self. While both of Metric's official LPs, 2003's Old World Underground, Where are You Now? and 2005's Live it Out were met with a generally favorable critical reception (the latter was nominated for the Polaris Prize and the Juno), the negative responses often took the band to task for bloat and clutter. Grow Up and Blow Away was recorded between 1999 and 2001, and was meant to be Metric's debut LP, but it got lost in the shuffle when their label, Reckless Records, was purchased by Rykodisc. The album has been available on the internet for years, but this marks its first hard release, and it showcases Metric as a two-piece, before bassist Josh Winstead and drummer Joules Scott-Key became permanent members. As such, there's less leeway for clutter, and Haines' arresting songwriting (not to mention her fertile rapport with Shaw) shines through. The album is fully a product of Metric's signature style, where electro-pop, trip-hop, and good old indie rock underpin Haines' effortless charisma. Despite its textural richness, it's feather-light; it's also comely and stylish. In fact, Metric's neophyte effort might be their best. Grow Up and Blow Away's phrasing is redolent of another album that was being recorded around the same time, which also felt like it could have made some mainstream waves had it appeared a few years earlier and shed a few experimental tendencies: Dismemberment Plan's Change. It's stiffly funky, with prickly mechanical drums, supple bass lines, and skittering piano loops as its propulsive grist. Guitars are present, but they take a backseat to the pianos, and when the do appear, they're often deployed so texturally they sound more like guiros. It's structured more like disco than indie rock: simple, striking passages that would be easy to retrofit for an extended mix loop and shuffle. Like Travis Morrison, Haines is more attuned to the stylized melodies of modern r&b than indie rock's more naturalistic, colloquial singing style. She swings with a simple yet elegant dexterity from syllable to bell-clear syllable. This especially comes to the fore on ""The Twist"", a dreamy r&b synth dirge that sounds like a mannered precursor to Cocorosie's ""Werewolf"". Haines' lyrics are also remindful of Morrison's, with their pithy, existential inclinations. The title track, a meditation on suburban ennui set to an ice-blue ribbon of fizzy synths, gives us the first of the album's many modern koans: ""If this is the life, why does it feel so good to die today?"" (or ""fly away,"" as Polaroid would have it). ""Hardwire"", sultry and chiming, gives us the skyscraping chorus ""You are everything; you are nothing at all."" And ""Rock Me Now"", a spoken-word piece about burning out in Vegas, is almost hard to swallow, but Haines really sells it. Perhaps her confidence stems from having Paul Haines, a poet who often collaborated with jazz muscians, for a father, most notably on Escalator Over the Hill with Carla Bley. But that work was dark and impenetrable in the Scott Walker mold, while ""Rock Me Now"" is a jazzbo wisp, breezy and trim. It's a manicured lawn to her father's impenetrable weeds. ""His value declined when he offered his name,"" Haines breathes, slipping into a staccato backing harmony as Shaw echoes her in eerie falsetto over a disco churn. ""My old flame broke the 12-bar blues just to prove he could,"" Haines coos amid the splashy drums and mincing pianos of ""On the Sly"". ""He pays the airline DJs now; he is everywhere,"" while the kids ""get high and eat TV."" With evocative lines like these, Haines roughs out the proportions of her subjective world, focusing on whatever details command her attention from her post in its very center. And she doesn't take this subjectivity for granted: ""Climb the wall to make the sun rise in time,"" she sings on ""Soft Rock Star"" (which appears here in two distinct yet complementary versions). This drive to render the world not as a set of facts, but as a phantasmagorical realm wholly contingent on the presence of a viewer, gives the album its lyrical heft and specific personality. Paired with early Metric's less-is-more approach, it makes for an immersive record that feels much fresher than its long incubation period would seem to warrant.","Metric's lost debut of sorts, recorded between 1999 and 2001, gives us a chance to get to know them more intimately-- as a charming singer/songwriterly band poised to arrive a little too late for the 1990s alterna-rock boom, when they would have fit in snugly with bubble-poppers, like Letters to Cleo, and scorers of imaginary films, like Self.

Tomahawk have managed to sound like less than the sum of their parts for two records now, but this time, they've come together for to flesh out a nobler and more artistic concept. They're now a three-piece featuring Duane Dension, guitarist of Jesus Lizard, John Stanier, drummer of Helmet and the justly-hyped Battles, and vocalist and chronic collaborator Mike Patton, who this website alone has called ""an icon,"" a ""psychotic misanthrope,"" ""the Devil on holiday,"" a ""greasy-ass on of a bitch,"" and ""King Shit of Fuck Mountain."" (What's become of Melvins' Kevin Rutmanis, formerly on bass, is a mystery). The curveball: Rather than the predictable freak-metal they've pursued on their previous albums, Anonymous takes the band name to heart and interprets Native American compositions, researched by Denison while touring reservations with Hank Williams III. And here I thought Patton had run out of ways to alienate people and limit his own appeal. What's it sound like? A lot like two talented musicians pushing themselves to find new contexts for Patton to grunt over. Dension plays it straight for the most part, playing slow and woozy clean guitar lines on tracks like ""Ghost Dance"" and ""Cradle Song"", rooting us in the familiar and evoking the creepier quiet moments of Jesus Lizard songs where listeners patiently waited to get their asses kicked, and the occasional hyper-compressed power-chord thud to keep it lively. Patton is listed as doing some percussion, but the burden of authenticity falls upon Stanier, who's got to not only mimic the backbeat of an entire culture's music, but to add new textures and be the group's historical anchor while still driving the more metal and industrial moments. One listen to ""Mescal Rite 1"" proves he can do all of it ably, even if Patton's contributions make or break the directions each composition takes. The calmer moments of the album can sound like a window into a past ritual, as it does on the surprisingly subtle ""Ghost Dance"", or with his diverse delivery on the downright perky ""Antelope Ceremony"". Elsewhere, it sounds like an alternate soundtrack to Poltergeist 2 with the hammy keyboards and self-consciously spooky chanting of ""War Song"" or the collision of flutes and lazer noises in ""Mescal Rite 1"". And then sometimes, it sounds like Massive Attack (""Mescal Rite 2""). To the band's credit, even the cheesiest songs show genuine respect for the originals, as they play these rhythms and themes without any watering-down or Westernization. Good idea or not, it's hardly a caricature. On top of that, it's an immersive listen that undoubtedly creates an atmosphere; only on the seventh track ""Song of Victory"" do they even begin to sound like a live band and not as if they're scoring a movie. Anonymous does show more potential for Tomahawk and justifies their existence beyond the mere gimmick of a supergroup, but how many listeners this odd, headstrong little record will reach is difficult to picture.  ","Underground supergroup featuring Mike Patton, Duane Dension (Jesus Lizard), and John Stanier (Helmet, Battles) ditches freak-metal for a record that interprets Native American compositions.

Radio Moscow,Radio Moscow,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1325e6ef959693220ad/1:1/w_160/d6dc93a2.jpg,2007-07-02 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10377-radio-moscow/,Alive,"Ah, this is such stuff as beer commercials and Super Bowl ads are made on. Corn-fed Iowa blues-rock trio Radio Moscow have taken a number and are currently waiting in line at the revival deli, hoping today's special will be watered-down sports bar rock. Go ahead, try listening to the first 30 seconds of their self-titled debut without having a Pavlovian flashback to schlubby thirtysomethings high-fiving in a bar as girls in bikinis chug drinks and play touch-football on the Rocky Mountains. It's a shame the band's sound elicits this sort of reaction. They're not a misogynistic or dim-witted collection of musicians; they just haven't considered the world outside the piles of guitar chord and scale charts that presumably consumed their youth. As a result of sheer serendipity, Black Keys member Dan Auerbach tucks these greenhorns under his wing, offering to produce their debut after frontman Parker Griggs gave him the band's demo at a Keys show. Unfortunately, Auerbach's not exactly the alchemist to transmute these lumps of lead into gold, especially after his own band's lackluster 2006 album, Magic Potion. This album's most distinguishing characteristic is easily how indistinguishable these songs are from each other. Several of them sound like they're named after touristy Southern bars (""Lickskillet"", ""Luckydutch"", ""Mistreating Queen"") and all of them feel content with burying Briggs' already muffled vocals in wah-wah guitars and gratuitous mid-song jams. There's only one change-of-pace number on the album, the Far East-tapping ""Ordovician Fauna"", though even that track merely swaps boring pentatonic riffs for boring Indian scale riffs. Some areas where the band could really rally around: ""Timebomb"" has a decent melody, and for the split-second of the chorus where Briggs jumps up an octave to deliver a lovelorn yelp, you feel like the song's actually building towards something. Then poof-- a non-descript lick takes over, the pounding, staccato rhythm sections melts into predictable downbeat flab, and Radio Moscow attempt to once again try blowing your mind with a garden variety ""jam."" The chic criticisms of Cream/Led Zep/Hendrix thievery don't even apply to these classic rock throwbacks-- the band's not swiping full-fledged ideas from anyone. They're barely recreating anything more complicated than atonal finger exercises, a drawback that ultimately makes this debut such a bitch slap to the face of the musical genre that helped proliferate words like ""hook"" and ""riff"" in our lexicon.","Hook- and riff-filled guitar rock band has its debut record produced by Black Keys member Dan Auerbach.

Starvation Under Orange Trees,Ray's Vast Basement,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1235e6ef9596932209c/1:1/w_160/8606db1c.jpg,2007-07-02 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10365-starvation-under-orange-trees/,Howells Transmitter,"In 1996, I saw Bruce Springsteen on the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, when he took the stage for two hours with only an acoustic guitar and a harmonica. He was pretty good when the songs were fast-- I remember the lusty ""Red Headed Woman"" being a stand-out-- but whenever the tempos flagged, the show became deadly dull. When he interrupted the show to recount his favorite passage in The Grapes of Wrath, I actually fell asleep-- despite being in the almighty presence of the man I considered at the time to be my hero. This is the Springsteen flip side that is rarely considered when artists from the Killers to the Arcade Fire cite him as an influence: There's anthemic Bruce of Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A, whose music seems to embody everything that rock and roll can and should be, but then there's serious storyteller Bruce of The Ghost of Tom Joad and Devils & Dust, whose devotion to Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie is so personal that it often comes across as exclusionary. While his colleagues go for the might and majesty of anthemic Bruce, Jon Berrnson is somewhat bolder: while he may not be directly citing the Boss as a source, his third album fronting Ray's Vast Basement seems squarely in the vein of Tom Joad, right down to its last period detail. Starvation Under Orange Trees was, according to the liners, inspired by Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and commissioned by the Actors Theatre of San Francisco. This is a concept album as literary endeavor, which doesn't just mean the lyrics are smart, but rather that they evoke a time, place, and culture specifically and artfully. Fortunately, Berrnson doesn't try to retell that story through song, which would be largely unbearable. Starvation is not a piece of Dustbowl realism like Steinbeck's novel, nor Americana fantasia like HBO's defunct Carnivále-- nor, for that matter, anything resembling the AbEx of its curiously anachronistic cover. Instead, he and the band explore Depression culture on a larger scale: ""Work Song"" and ""California's Gone"" follow itinerants westward to labor in orange groves, and ""The Story of Lee"" recounts the trials of a Chinese immigrant. On the closing ""Annalisa"", a boxcar-jumper longs for the love he left behind, and the spirited ""Cotton Black"" is a boxing tale that could have been inspired by George Bellows' pugilist paintings. With a large cast of musicians that includes Michael Zapruder and Decemberists bass player Nate Query, Bernson anchors these songs in some of the same folk sounds that inspire storyteller Springsteen, but dresses them up in Sufjan-style orchestration. And yet, Berrnson actually incorporates very little period music into these songs, aside from scraps of ragtime on ""Danny's Party"" and blasts of trumpet on ""Cotton Black"". Starvation is overly modern, from the watery bossa nova beat of ""Palace Flophouse"" to the brushed snare on ""Ocean Notes"" that sounds like a loop. The trembling atmosphere of ""Work Song"" and ""Tall Bob Smoke"" are too cinematic, their gravity a kind of soundtrack shorthand that seems empty without a visual, but the backing vocals on ""The Story of Lee"" and ""Not Just Mine"" are mic'ed to sound like they're emanating either from a beat-up radio or from the firmament directly-- a nice atmospheric touch that suggests a dramatic chorus watching over these characters. Starvation achieves the brainy scope of a good novel, but to what end? Too firmly rooted in contemporary musical styles, none of these songs have much to say about the present-day. There's no activist spark here, just an academic scrutiny that rarely extends beyond the stage or the page.","Jon Berrnson's third album fronting Ray's Vast Basement seems in the vein of Bruce Springsteen the storyteller, right down to its last period detail.

The Cloud of Unknowing,James Blackshaw,by: Grayson Haver Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c99d034d5c69bf4913/1:1/w_160/61cc0104.jpg,2007-07-02 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10287-the-cloud-of-unknowing/,Tompkins Square,"For fans of acoustic guitar music, James Blackshaw's The Cloud of Unknowing is a gift that's long overdue. Blackshaw's fourth album gracefully glides over the same sonic ground that his contemporaries generally tread with reverential obedience or dilettante tactics. Growing into his prodigious own at the relatively young age of 25, Blackshaw has finessed his 12-string acoustic guitar into a veritable solo symphony that's as schooled in uncommon beauty as it is in complex 20th century composition. But don't fear the esoterics: For everyone else, The Cloud of Unknowing is the gem no one expected to find. Blackshaw writes high drama into instrumental music with subtlety and charm, speaking on sentiments and stories without requiring a single lyric (or, most of the time, any accompaniment at all). A rare intersection of genre advancement and general accessibility, The Cloud of Unknowing is one of the true masterpieces of its own heralded realm. The title The Cloud of Unknowing is lifted from an anonymous 14th century text that articulated a mystical view of Christianity which asserts that God can be better met through a continuum of experience and love than through absolute knowledge. Fittingly, the five pieces here capitalize on dramatic push and pull, alternately joyous and foreboding 12-string figures that are constantly reabsorbed into a web of sheer movement and energy. Despite his age, Blackshaw accomplishes this through profound musical erudition: Closer ""Stained Glass Windows"" nods to microtonality, climbing up and down an arch in the tiniest intervals, much like Rhys Chatham's gorgeous, glacial work with 400 electric guitars on A Crimson Grail.During ""The Mirror Speaks"", disparate melodies collide, interlock and crisscross, bending and pushing one another up or down. In his final years, Claude Debussy could pin such lines against one another with a piano in much the same way, but Blackshaw is an Englishman born nearly a decade after Bert Jansch left Pentangle and thriving in a time during which folk has found renewed currency. So here, he assimilates those past masters and, prospering from what he's learned from them, laces one technique to another. Part of Blackshaw's success stems from his confidence. He's a beneficent host to one of the few non-technical ideals that united the great early minimalists: He fully inhabits an idea, allows it to build, and expires only when it is ready. The Cloud of Unknowing opens and closes with 11 and 15 minutes pieces, yet these long forms are as approachable as the best four-minute pop songs. Their complex frames bear lucid motifs through brisk movement, guiding the listener through thousands of notes from 10 fingers and 12 strings with purpose. Such perfect commitment is new to this album. Earlier non-guitar excursions embedded in Blackshaw's work felt slightly apologetic or indecisive. An excessive tampoura-and-cymbala drone overran the best bits of last year's O True Believer, and a disc-closing track with heavy percussion and organ provided a simple, sour end. Blackshaw was tempering his extremist tendencies then. On The Cloud, though, Blackshaw seems fully settled, engaging his pieces and ideas with the unflinching belief of Tony Conrad in 1964 or Steve Reich in 1965. ""Running to the Ghost"" augments guitar with violin and glockenspiel, but those auxiliary parts are mere bells and strings highlighting how much sound Blackshaw can fit in one lithe motion. Indeed, it's his rumbling bass line (his tuning for this track starts in B) supporting a nimble, mid-range melody and the strings that weave between its notes. The glockenspiel teases from above. The only non-guitar piece is a wandering four-minute electronic token. It's long enough to serve as an intermission but short enough to feel more like a pause than a distraction. And that's a good thing. On an album where movement, experience, and persistence mean everything, it's best to let Blackshaw's 12-string momentum have as much space as it wants. The Cloud of Unknowing carves out a new, peerless space altogether-- one that puts Blackshaw at the top of his class.","This is a long-overdue gift for fans of acoustic guitar music; Blackshaw-- growing into his prodigious own at the startling age of 25-- has finessed his abilities and 12-string acoustic guitar into a veritable solo symphony, schooled equally in complex 20th century composition and uncommon beauty.

We Are the Night,The Chemical Brothers,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12813d197565213a5a5/1:1/w_160/eacba33a.jpg,2007-07-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10369-we-are-the-night/,Astralwerks,"It's going to take another few years, a lot of nostalgia, and even more critical evangelism for the Chemical Brothers to be recognized as one of the most all-around consistent acts of the 1990s. More than a decade after the release of their debut album, 1995's Exit Planet Dust, they remain inextricably tied to Big Beat electronica, a genre that had already fallen out of fashion by the time the tech bubble burst. Since most of America's hopes for so-called ""electronica"" were pinned on a cynically marketed next-big-thingism, its chart failure has tended to overshadow everything else-- including a fair critical appraisal, as Salon's Michelle Goldberg demonstrated in a pan of the Chemical Brothers' 2002 album Come With Us: ""Commercially, the mid-to-late-90s conceit that electronic music would wrest the airwaves from guitar rock dinosaurs has proved as fanciful as the idea that online video rental could be a billion-dollar business."" You don't need to have the Chemicals' Singles 93-03 video compilation in your Netflix queue to question the relevance of that statement: Electronica was a failure as a mass-culture lifestyle trend. But it was successful, too, in one important area: producing memorable pop records. Even in the post-crash doldrums of the early 2000s, the Chemical Brothers sustained their creative stride more effectively than most other artists clogging up the modern rock charts 30 notches above them. Albums like Come With Us and 2005's Push the Button were more pacekeepers than trendsetters, sure, but there was a cohesive freedom to them, a sort of universal dance music catchall vibe that cross-evolved through acid house, electro, hip-hop, and whatever else they could layer big, explosive bass over. Even as their returns began to diminish the further they got from the staggering peak of Dig Your Own Hole, the mild creative downturn wasn't significant enough to damage the overall feeling of optimistic, psychedelic egalitarianism embedded in their music. This, though, this We Are the Night-- no, come on, not now. Not after Fatboy Slim's Palookaville and the Prodigy's Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned and Orbital's The Blue Album and Daft Punk's Human After All and the last two Moby records. Just because Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons are falling off the cliff a few years later than most of the other once-great hopes of 90s dance music doesn't make the plummet any less frustrating or embarrassing. Not even the low points on Push the Button suggested they were about to tank this hard. On We Are the Night, the Chemical Brothers have switched from integrators to imitators: Where 1999's Surrender opened with ""Music: Response"", expertly streamlining the cutting-edge electro-funk of early Timbaland, ""Do It Again"" sounds like a public domain version of a FutureSex/LoveSounds beat, with perky synths and an aloof radio-dance churn gutlessly approximating the elements that make those tracks work. Guest singer Ali Love turns in a mediocre Timberlake impression-- although even JT himself couldn't pull off a dippy couplet like ""got a brain like bubblegum/ Blowing up my cranium."" The album's title track attempts to weave the duo's euphoric buildups and breakdowns into warmed-over Krautrock, but with a beat that never crests, its dynamics are left to a weakly kitschy Perrey-Kingsley melody, damning the track to 6 1/2 minutes of a rickety retro-future parody of the 360-degree treadmill from 2001. ""Das Speigel"" is an ill-advised stab at minimal house-- have the Chems ever even attempted to pull off minimal anything? -- and after layering on enough electronic giggles, squeals, melodicas, guitars, and extraneous sound effects to a briefly-promising groove, it turns out sounding like something from side 6 of Booka Shade's Sandinista!. Other autopsies of this album might pin its weaker moments on the guest spots, but those mostly just make an already-bad situation moderately worse. ""All Rights Reversed"" would still sound like groggy emo if they got somebody besides the Klaxons to mutter close-harmony vocals over its inflated theatricality. It's probably for the best that ""Battle Scars"" wasn't given to a better singer than Willy Mason: His head-trauma Gordon Lightfoot vocals and the sub-Rod McKuen lyrics (""There's a line in the sand/ Put there by man/ By man whose children built up castles made of stone"") are perfectly suited to the track's tedious, xylophone-laden indie sleepwalk. And while there's been a well-earned avalanche of derision aimed at Fatlip's dopey nature-doc rap ""The Salmon Dance"", he had to work with the beat the Chemicals gave him; most MCs, faced with the prospect of rhyming over something Arthur Baker might have concocted after an afternoon of gorging on vanilla-frosted hash brownies and Spongebob reruns, would probably rap about dancing like a fish on crack, too. The Chemical Brothers' descent into ineptitude is at least accompanied by a few brief highlights: ""Saturate"" plays like one of Surrender's acid house throwbacks, complete with Bill Ward-size drums, while ""A Modern Midnight Conversation""-- based on a whipcrack cowbell beat and the bassline from Crystal Grass' 1974 psych-disco classic ""Crystal World""-- is as euphoric as anything they've done this decade short of ""Star Guitar."" But those flashes of effortless dancefloor-filling greatness used to be the norm for the Chemical Brothers; as exceptions on an album of colossal blunders, they can only serve as fleeting reminders. I once found it hard to fathom that Dig Your Own Hole was released ten years ago; it's easier to believe now.","Despite their innovative 90s repertoire, the Chemical Brothers have spent much of this decade keeping pace. Now, sporting guest spots from Klaxons, Midlake, Fatlip, and Willy Mason, they return with their sixth album.

To say more than this at the outset is to say too much, because there are two distinct ways to engage with this album, and the encounter is richer if one experiences both. Readers who wish to do so are advised to familiarize themselves with the music before reading this review. Go ahead, we'll wait. Everyone back? Okay. With no knowledge of its conceptual underpinnings, Drawing Voices is a decent drone-based record. Nothing on it would surprise anyone who has a couple Growing, Excepter, or Sightings albums in their collection: Wispy modulating waveforms, crystal beds of rhythm, and Turner's processed guitar noodlings-- featured most prominently on the sinuous ""The Shrine of Wreckless Illumination""-- play out in long, palsied arcs. ""Being Born Broken"" consists of little more than a pixilated drone and the overdriven noises that sporadically attack it, while ""Scattered Shavings"" pits batty squeaks against choral vacuum-cleanerish roars. The chattering, richly textured ""Being Born Broken II"" is a lot like Maja Ratjke's voice manipulation experiments, and ""A Choir Speaks"" is a sound-effect corrosion bath, not dissimilar to Svarte Greiner's indirectly representational compositions. While Drawing Voices is not entirely satisfying qua drone, there's something naggingly compelling about it. Its rudimentary palette and its peculiar habit of abrupt, volume-jacked punch-ins-- one moment, you're hearing a regressive hum, the very next, all your EQ levels are in the red-- allude to some sort of hidden guide rail or internalized policy. And so it is: Drawing Voices turns out to be heavily process-based; listening conceptually is the second (and preferred) way to approach it. Dongoski's process involves recording the sounds of ""mark-making"" (the aural environment produced by the act of drawing) and manipulating the results into compositional foundations. In doing so, he mines the rich techno-organic seam between the intimately human act of drawing and the stoic precision of mechanical intervention, and articulates one of the many shadow narratives latent in illustration, effectively translating discrete visual units into their inextricable but wildly capricious sonic analogues. Knowing that Dongoski's sounds are the emulsion of a traditionally visual act brings the album to life. To an extent, process-based art confounds popular criticism. This is especially true of processes like Dongoski's, which exploit areas of slippage between two distinct acts, bringing forces both aleatoric and conceptually predetermined into play. The spontaneous and unconstrained creative act proceeds by a series of decisions, providing numerous opportunities to ""go wrong"" (armor-chinks for critical arrows) along the way; process-based creation begins with one major conceptual decision and then plays out according to the terms of its particular game. As such, the finished product of such a process takes on a secondary importance to the unquantifiable relationships between the product, its mode of production, and the conceptual leap that spawned it. In such a case, whether or not we (or the artist, for that matter) like or dislike the finished product becomes almost moot: It is, quite literally, what it is, and must be contended with on that level. Of course, none of this will interest listeners who engage with music strictly on the level of sound-- this album is not for them. But those attuned to the drastically particular mindset of process-based creation, with its minimization of the creative will and Russian-doll-caliber relational depth, will find Dognoski's curious alchemy worthwhile.","Aaron Turner from Isis meets Craig Dongoski for a conceptual project in which sounds created in the act of drawing are processed into modulating drones.

Spider Smile,Tarwater,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b124c0084474cd0c1d7d/1:1/w_160/2afb10aa.jpg,2007-06-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10366-spider-smile/,Morr,"If there exists a group able to make music as sour-sounding as Tarwater, I'd like to hear it. On second thought, maybe I wouldn't. Spider Smile, Berliners Bernd Jestram and Ronald Lippok's eighth album under the moniker and second for hometown imprint Morr Music, marks a decade of the duo finding ways to further tweak their long-tweaked formula of blending electronic textures and a variety of oft-exotic instrumentation, with all manner of astringent sonics located in the crowded overlap. Spider shows Jestram and Lippok's continued ability to implement a wide array of noisemakers-- many seeming electronic simulations of real instruments-- into their acidic mélange. Opener ""Shirley Temple"" showcases a nauseated synthesized harpsichord, ""Sweet Home Under White Clouds"" features the ethereal whine of what sounds like a musical saw, and the soft honk of an oboe colors ""Roderick Usher"". The album's best moment, the instrumental ""Witch Park"", is a clanky contraption of welded-together scraps; farting synth notes, a slowly dying harmonica and a tabla form a thrumming neo-Krautrock engine held together by a droning electronic wheeze. Even the more traditional utensils, like the pair's omnipresent acoustic guitars, are tapped and twisted to elicit their peculiarities: on ""The World of Things to Touch"", the sound of fingers sliding up and down metal strings is spotlighted, to unnerving effect. The most evocative elements in the pair's instantly recognizable admixture, however, are still the lyrics and vocal delivery. In a pallid timbre evoking a warmer version of Kraftwerk's on The Man Machine, Lippok continues to provide emotionally distant-- and, to a large degree, distancing-- comment, often in stark contrast to the comparatively vivid backdrops. Spider's cover image shows an in-ground pool and umbrella in otherwise colorless surroundings, and its lyrics follow suit. These items encompass, in a manner seemingly known only to these two diffident Germans, various aspects of American society, mostly of the high variety, decontextualized and abstracted. Edgar Allan Poe's vision of decadent isolation is the inspiration for the plaintive instrumental ""Usher"", while the above-mentioned instrumental ""Shirley Temple"" couples with the elegant ""When Love was the Law in Los Angeles"" to construct a trans-Atlantic Hollywood pastiche. ""Los Angeles"" is particularly memorable for being the most upbeat track on the record-- the acoustic pluck and click and light organ flourish sound almost nostalgic for the Golden Age, especially when paired with the lyric ""the boy in the cage set the world on fire."" As Jestram and Lippok's abstractions become more topical, they simultaneously become less meaningful. The new-age-leaning ""A Marriage in Belmont"" takes a musty view of American popular entertainment as endorsed voyeurism (""Darling, there are you and I, making love in a glass box"" and ""We found ourselves alone and voiceless in the fire""). Similarly, ""Easy Sermon"" takes the simple path toward comment on organized religion, doing its own proselytizing along the way: ""A message will come to the deaf and the dumb, in an easygoing way."" The slippage between icy observations and straight sermonizing is an easy indulgence, but it's the sort of tartness that Tarwater would do well to avoid altogether.","More sour-sounding sonics from the Berlin duo, this time addressing American-style high society and decadence.

The Boy With No Name,Travis,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12613d197565213a5a3/1:1/w_160/9519c837.jpg,2007-06-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10367-the-boy-with-no-name/,Sony,"Travis are, of course, most known for their coding of melodramatic Britpop's drowsy DNA with 1999's Nigel Godrich-piloted ""Why Does It Always Rain on Me"", but along the way, the band has also shown a tendency to, superficially at least, intellectually distance themselves from their introspective content. The title of their 1999 breakthrough The Man Who is a nod to neurologist Oliver Sachs' noted 1986 book of patient case studies, and its 2001 follow-up The Invisible Band a twist on ""invisible hand,"" Adam Smith's economic theory of self-interest being good for the whole. Continuing that trend is the best moment on The Boy With No Name, ""Selfish Jean"", a pun on biologist Richard Dawkins' hugely successful book The Selfish Gene. The song's lyrics are, quite literally, nothing new; they're lifted in large part from the band's decade-old B-side ""Standing on My Own"". The instrumentation, however, is what sticks around: Partly drawn from fellow Glaswegian Stuart Murdoch's pop-soul, but merged with a soft take on ""Lust for Life""'s rhythm track, it's the most refreshing song the band's made in quite some time. Boy's title, however, hides no such wordplay-- quite the opposite, really-- as it came from singer Fran Healy's inability to settle on a name for his recently born son, and much of the album deals with the intricacies of family life, good and bad. First single ""Closer"", extended-metaphor number ""Battleships"" (""we're battleships, driftin' in an alley river""), and ""My Eyes"" are delicate, chiming recollections of a troubled, nearly severed relationship. Fittingly, they sound like bombast-free Coldplay as well, but that, of course, isn't Travis' fault. Their last effort, 2003's Godrich-free 12 Memories, came after Chris Martin and co. had appropriated their gentle angst and transformed it into stadium-size sentimentality, and the record unwisely attempted to channel Blair-era political venom. Four years later, Boy feels like a return to form-of sorts. While it's far from great, and won't come close to flaring up another UK pop revolution, Boy's got more than a few moments that recall Invisible, their highly enjoyable, feather-light post-platinum record, and the most fitting direction for the group after the success of what NME referred to as their ""sad, classic record"". Most importantly for all involved, Boy marks the return of Godrich, and his studio sensibilities are now clearly recognizable as second only to Healy's songwriting in terms of indispensibility. ""Big Chair"" skitters along on a syncopated drum patter that recalls Radiohead's ""There There"", as Healy's wide melisma glides atop, and ""Eyes Wide Open"" moves from a tightly-wound stomp to an emotionally and sonically spacious chorus, with multiply layered, echo-laden guitars providing support. To the group's credit, Boy's best songs-- all contained within the first 2/3 of the record-- manage to regain a degree of (and gently tweak) their Invisible mojo, without resorting to pulling ideas from their own pupils. While the first half of the record is promising, however, the band loses steam toward the end, with ""One Night"" and ""Out in Space"" are Travis on auto-pilot, and closing New York ode ""New Amsterdam"" is just too affected to be effective. While more albums like Boy will probably mean that the anonymity of Travis' album titles will turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, variations on the most prominent themes re-established here certainly feel like the proper moniker for the band to adopt.","The melodramatic Glaswegians return, with Nigel Godrich in tow, for their first album since 2003's iffy 12 Memories.

Even in a post-Al Gore America (where Wal-Mart's gone green-- sorta-- and hybrid cars are as much of an it-accessory as Goyard totes), it's still awfully hard for a sweet-faced North Carolina couple to clutch their instruments to their chests and coo bits like, ""It takes a lot of nerve to destroy this wondrous earth"" without making everyone squirmy. But Bowerbirds' pro-Earth proselytizing is more endearing (and inspiring) than precious or cloying, and if anything, all that earnestness will just make you adore them more (and, maybe, think a little bit harder about the interstates slicing up your hometown forests). Snatching their name from an Australian chirper (bowerbirds are most famous for the inverse relationship between a male's plumage and its ability to construct a mate-attracting nest), Bowerbirds' debut long player (released by Pitchfork writer Grayson Currin's label) will likely garner loads of comparisons to Devendra Banhart and Vetiver, but their brand of folk is more Appalachian than British (Carter Family over Bert Jansch), and less concerned with psychedelia than melody (think gypsy-influenced Sufjan Stevens). Opener ""Hooves"" starts small and modest, with Moore mewing about his mom over spare acoustic guitar (""Back when I was born on a full moon/ I nearly split my momma in two""), before the vocals double, drums kick up, and Tacular's accordion starts to whine: the track is somehow quiet and jarring at the same time, and invites all kinds of twee analogies (a family of deer darting through a clearing! Thunderclaps at night! Rainbows!). ""In Our Talons"" is equally mesmerizing, jazzy and rich, with lyrics both gentle and barbed (""We're only human/ This at least we've learned""), while ""The Marbled Godwit"" is Bowerbirds' most classically freak-folk moment (and most Newsom-inspired title?), with acoustic guitar, high, meandering vocals, and cutting violin. Hymns strongest tracks-- ""Slow Down"", ""In Our Talons"", ""Dark Horse""-- manage to be both hypnotically pretty and a little bit weird, characteristics of the very best kind of Americana music. Bowerbirds do for backyards what the Hold Steady's done for parking lots-- translated place into sound.","North Carolina duo's debut album will likely garner loads of comparisons to Devendra Banhart and Vetiver, but this brand of folk is more Appalachian than British and less concerned with psychedelia than melody.

Dylanesque,Bryan Ferry,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12f9d034d5c69bf49ab/1:1/w_160/4ff24e83.jpg,2007-06-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10375-dylanesque/,Virgin,"It's really not that tough to do a good Bob Dylan cover, which is one of the reasons he's been covered so well so often. His lyrics have lots of room for a singer to find a personal angle, and their melodies are durable enough to sound just fine no matter how far they're pushed-- the farther the better, really. ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"", which led off Bryan Ferry's 1974 solo debut These Foolish Things, is one of the most awesome Dylan covers ever, the kind of interpretation that leaves its source bruised, hung over and covered in Sharpied taunts. Ferry ripped apart Dylan's apocalyptic tapestry fiber by fiber and reconstructed it in Day-Glo plastic thread; his performance's deliberately affected mannerisms seem to have made an enduring impact on the young David Byrne. Ferry's returned to the Dylan songbook a few times since then, including two tracks on 2002's Frantic, and the marketing hook for his tedious new record is that it's all Bob: 10 covers of the master, plus ""Baby, Let Me Follow You Down"", an oldie that Dylan learned from Eric von Schmidt. The chief joke of the album is that Dylanesque isn't particularly Dylanesque, aside from a couple of harmonica solos plunked in for symbolic purposes. Anything resembling a rough edge in the arrangements has been buffed away; Dylan's wicked vocal backspin has been replaced by Ferry's touch-my-velvet-dinner-jacket-baby default croon, sometimes backed up by characterless backup chicks. A Dylanesque choice of repertoire would've been perverse and deep-diving, maybe borderline inscrutable, but Ferry sticks to the hits. He also hermetically seals the hits off from meaning. Ferry can be a subtle ironist when he feels like it--he's made a career out of blurring the line between romantic and ""romantic""-- so maybe it's another joke that he treats the opening song here, the despondent ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"", as if it were just an assemblage of syllables and notes like anything else he could rubber-stamp the ""Bryan Ferry"" brand onto. But compared to, say, Nina Simone's blood-in-the-bathwater rendition of the same song, it just seems lazy. When he recycles the same blasé, prefabricated technique for virtually every other song here, it's not just lazy-- it's infuriating. The band isn't much help, either: They play polite, foursquare rock with the occasional ""tasty"" lick at the end of a line. ""All Along the Watchtower"" lifts the Jimi Hendrix arrangement, just like the version Dylan plays on stage almost every night, but Ferry and company amble through it as if its central line is ""no reason to get excited."" There's something in Dylan that Ferry is attached to, obviously, but it's not clear what. He's talked about how interpreting these songs is like reading Shakespeare. That's true, in a way; bad actors perform Shakespeare as if the text were a jeweler's pillow to display their star presence to best advantage, and that's the way Ferry mostly sings Dylan now. He doesn't really address the songs on their own terms, or even wrestle with them the way he did with ""Hard Rain"". He just runs them through the Ferry-izer, treating them all like they're ""Slave to Love"". Which means that, as much as he tries to capitalize on his voice's suaveness and seductiveness and hauntingness, he can't sing ""All I Really Want to Do"" as suavely as the Byrds, or ""If Not For You"" as seductively as Olivia Newton-John (no, seriously!), or ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" as hauntingly as just about anyone else who's ever attempted it. There's only one glimmer here of Ferry's old interpretive wit. He murmurs ""Positively 4th Street"" in a gently mournful tone, backed up by power-ballad piano and whooshing movie-soundtrack synthesizers. The song is one of the most vindictive, venomous kiss-offs Dylan's ever written; gentle mournfulness wouldn't seem to suit it. But Ferry phrases it as a regretful glance back at a relationship that somehow didn't work out, and keeps a straight face all the way up to the last line, ""you'd know what a drag it is to see you""-- whereupon he gives ""drag"" the bitter snap he's been saving up. Thanks, Bryan; the feeling is mutual.","Former Roxy Music singer-- long adept at transforming other people's material, e.g his fantastic take on Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall""-- here attempts an entire record of Dylan covers.

We the Best,DJ Khaled,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11cea9e61561daa671f/1:1/w_160/2eb8fbc7.jpg,2007-06-28 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10359-we-the-best/,Koch,"Miami's DJ Khaled doesn't really do much. He doesn't rap. He doesn't sing. He doesn't cut or scratch. He does produce tracks under his Beat Novocain alias, but not that often; he's responsible for only two of the tracks on We the Best, his sophomore album. Mostly, he just incessantly screams dumb catchphrases, and he doesn't even do that particularly well; one of the reasons that Lil Wayne and Khaled's Da Drought 3 is the best mixtape in years is Lil Wayne's decision to leak it to the internet before Khaled had a chance to yell all over it. Still, for someone so markedly devoid of talent, Khaled managed to throw together a surprisingly decent debut album last year. Listennn...The Album was a state-of-the-art rap compilation. Khaled apparently has ins with half of rap's biggest stars, and his disc probably could've coasted by on star-power alone. But he also employed most of Florida's better production teams, including Cool & Dre and the Runners. And since these guys all work from the same basic sonic templates, Listennn was satisfyingly cohesive for a thrown-together mixtape of its kind, and it made a strong case for the epically plastic Miami synth-rap sound that was ascendant at the time. We the Best plainly attempts to follow up on the formula established by Listennn. First single ""We Takin' Over"" is every bit the equal of its Listennn predecessor, the worldbeating posse cut ""Holla At Me"". The new single wrangles an all-star lineup, boasting an ebulliently overblown Akon chorus and sandwiching a few just-OK verses from Rick Ross and Fat Joe and Birdman between two bravura star-turns. T.I. starts things off with brisk efficiency, and Lil Wayne masterfully caps the song off with deranged verve. The track builds beautifully to Wayne's climactic verse, and his performance would've been star-making if he weren't already a star: ""I am the beast/ Feed me rappers or feed me beats..."" If only the rest of We the Best held up to that song's enormous promise. Instead, we get a rapidly diminishing series of rote posse cuts, every guest claiming to be harder and richer than everyone else. When these sorts of swaggering egocentric brag-raps are done with the exhilarated glee of ""We Takin' Over"", they can be great, even transcendent. But when they're thrown-together and half-assed, as most of the tracks here are, they quickly become oppressively dull. ""Brown Paper Bag"" thinks it's a drug-dealing epic, but its tinny tuba-fart synths and wailing Bee Gees interpolation feel like overkill, and even Lil Wayne sounds bored and unmotivated. ""I'm So Hood"" wastes a monstrous Runners sandworm synth-wriggle and an awesomely overblown T-Pain chorus on a bunch of thoroughly anonymous rap verses. ""Hit Them Up"" is a standard-issue Paul Wall filler-track two years after that might mean something. ""New York"" recruits the same lineup as the great 2004 Ja Rule single of the same name and fails to capture a single iota of that song's urgency and electricity. The mind-numbing six-minute Bone Thugs-N-Harmony showcase ""The Originators"" somehow manages to make those great Cleveland sing-rappers sound flat and boring. And when Rick Ross shows up on the first four songs on your album, you're in trouble. The big problem with We the Best is its inert repetition; things get old fast when virtually every guest posits himself as an indestructible ghetto superhero. And so the album's few non-""We Takin' Over"" highlights come in those rare moments when the guest-rappers allow themselves to become human beings. On ""Before the Solution,"" Beanie Sigel bitterly vents frustration about his jail term, sounding powerfully angry and flawed in the process: ""What up with State Prop, the crew, are they not there?/ The moment that they heard it, the verdict, when it was declared/ Your boy had the city, yeah/ Did they disappear?/ Did Jay really not visit there?"" And ""I'm From the Ghetto"" has a nicely sentimental lilt, with a chorus of kids singing inspirational nonsense and fond but conflicted childhood reminisces from the Game and Jadakiss and Trick Daddy. And so We the Best, it turns out, is indicative of one of the major problems with mainstream rap lately: too many rappers seem unwilling to drop their defenses and speak plainly. In any case, it was probably too much to expect two consistently listenable albums from motherfucking DJ Khaled; we're lucky we even got one.","Second album from Miami hip-hop figurehead, packed once again with posse cuts including verses from Lil Wayne, T.I. and Fat Joe, falls far short of its predecessor.

The Flowers of Hell,The Flowers of Hell,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b120c0084474cd0c1d73/1:1/w_160/b8162236.jpg,2007-06-28 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10362-the-flowers-of-hell/,P&CEarworm,"In listening to The Flowers of Hell, the debut LP from the highly touted London octet of the same name, the obvious criticism is the band's lack of tension and release. Indeed, for a band so indebted to Spacemen 3/Spiritualized glory (Sonic Boom produced pieces of the album and plays guitar on one track), a remarkable chunk of the record is spent watching pretty textures billow and breathe, letting them work more toward a background ambiance than a narrative thrust. But the Flowers of Hell actually pair a perfect amount of release to their tension: they're less like a rubber band, stretched and waiting to be cut or shot, and more like a piece of thick string, pulled for a bit until the only thing left to do is put it down and move along. ""Sympathy for Vengeance"", for instance, marches triumphantly for three minutes before slowly settling into a halcyon downslope, interrupted three minutes later by an attempt at a BIG ROCK CLIMAX! The idea is there, but the music itself plays out like an art student trying to pass off an oil painting as a bas-relief sculpture, with drums that are too staid, guitars that aren't trying to beat themselves, and sounds too timid to saturate. Or there's ""Foreign Lands"", a stock psychedelic drone for viola, reversed long-tones, Indian percussion, and the sort of twisting, slow, mid-range riffs that have become a signifier for ""out rock."" If it were capable of offering suspense or relief, its tonal banality would be forgivable. But, like much of the album (N.B. ""Through the F Hole"" and ""A Moment in Time""), it's not. The Flowers' chief referent was capable of using expected sounds for unexpected drama: At their best, Spiritualized had the capacity to build ""pretty"" alongside ""ugly"" and let the results battle it out in front of a microphone. It's not that the Flowers of Hell don't have the muscle or smarts to match the climb and collapse that made their predecessors captivating. They do: On ""Compound Fractures"", the band briefly comes together in a moment of cathartic cacophony. They pit a singing saw against a deep, dark piano, martial tom rolls, and a menacing viola, deftly letting their brood glow with a sinister pallor. During ""Opt Out"", paired passages juxtapose a weeping refrain from that same viola with the just-about-to-triumph coruscation of a cornet, setting the scene for theatrics that are never realized across the track's dawdling 14 minutes. Even when the Flowers mount momentum that they later crumble, the best you get are slightly louder, faster drums and a few more piggybacked textures. They're never able to commit-- or, properly, overcommit-- to flexing inside of their ideas. It feels more like living life as a moviegoer and less like a zealot (Spiritualized), superhero (Mogwai) or rebel (Godspeed You! Black Emperor). But maybe that's how this band wants it, to let subtlety reign in understated anthems that gather the reflected light (if not spirit) of Brian Eno's rock records, the Velvet Underground's trapped-inside-a-chord swirls, and space rock's ecclesiastical reign. Graceful closer ""Telescopic Suite"" nails that feeling. It's just that if you're coming to the Flowers of Hell looking for anything more than slightly dynamic background music in the hands of composers and players ostensibly capable of giving it to you, you're going to be let down. Wait, that's not right: You'll never actually be picked up.","Symphonic rock project features members of the Early Years, Tindersticks, and British Sea Power as well as production assistance from Sonic Boom.

Tied & True,The Detroit Cobras,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fe13d197565213a562/1:1/w_160/9c78fa41.jpg,2007-06-28 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10332-tied-true/,Bloodshot,"In the liner photos for the Detroit Cobras' fourth album, Tied & True, singer Rachel Nagy is always pictured with a half-smoked cigarette extending from between her index and middle fingers, which in this context carries as much cultural import as peroxide hair, Tura Satana measurements, and a crate full of girl-group 45s. In addition to ostensibly producing the delectable rasp in Nagy's vocals, each butt symbolizes the Cobras' debt to a very specific brand of juvenile delinquent cool that favors leather jackets and tender hearts, raw guitars and boozy beats. Formed guess where in 1995, the Cobras managed to survive that postmillennial garage rock thing on Sympathy for the Record Industry before signing to Bloodshot for their 2005 album, Baby, which was produced by fellow Detroit scenester Jack White. For their follow-up, Nagy and guitarist Mary Ramirez take over production (along with John Smereck) and bring in Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright to beef up their guitar assault. Tossing off tracks like they're flicking dead butts onto asphalt, the Cobras sound reinvigorated, playing up their own feminine smarts and rock-and-roll insouciance that you just know sounds better live. Tied & True suggests the Cobras have become one of the best cover bands around, with better chops and material than their competitors. To their considerable credit, they see no distinction on this album between blues, rockabilly, country, garage rock, soul, r&b, and girl-group pop, and so are free to mix everything together at will. After leading off with a fiery version of Garnett Mims' ""As Long as I Have You"", they pick the pockets of Irma Thomas, Bettye Lavette, the Cookies, the Flirtations, and the Equals, to name a few. Despite the pervasive smoking ban afflicting venues across the nation, the Cobras insist that their hard-living influences are timeless and trendless, and their understanding of how audiences first connected with these songs prevents the band from succumbing to joy-killing record-collection rock. Tied & True primarily emphasizes the band's range through gender-switched covers. Sure, you don't even have to change the pronouns on songs like James Brown's ""If You Don't Think"" and Leadbelly's ""On a Monday"" to feminize them, but Little Willie John's ""Leave My Kitten Alone"" takes on a slightly new meaning delivered in Nagy's nicotine voice and with the band meowing in the background. Instead of the typical scenario of a man defending his woman against leering eyes, their version recasts the sexes and sexualities, opening the song up to new and more volatile readings. Fortunately, the Cobras don't have an academic mission on Tied & True; in fact, they'd probably scoff at such a deep reading. For them a cigarette is just a cigarette.","Bar band from the D with a flair for imaginative covers tackles songs by Irma Thomas, Bettye Lavette, the Cookies, the Flirtations, and the Equals.

Open Field,Taken by Trees,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b129c0084474cd0c1d84/1:1/w_160/161b0416.jpg,2007-06-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10370-open-field/,Rough Trade,"Almost as if by accident, Victoria Bergsman's aching voice has become one of the most widely known in indie pop. As primary singer and songwriter for Swedish pop outfit the Concretes until last summer, Bergsman featured on at least one remarkable album, 2004's The Concretes. But it was a Target commercial that seared the Ronettes-via-Velvets swoon of the Concretes' ""Say Something New"" onto TV viewers' consciousnesses. By now, the songstress might be best recognized for her guest appearance on Peter Bjorn & John's world-conquering 2006 single ""Young Folks"". Bergsman's debut under the solo moniker Taken By Trees is her most consistently winning full-length since the Concretes peaked. But if Open Field leads to any similar mainstream flings, they'll still feel like fortunate flukes. Co-produced with PB&J's Björn Yttling, the album exists in its own ecstatically melancholy pre-dawn realm, at once less crowded and more lushly imagined than Bergsman's previous outings. It's personal, introspective folk-pop with the instrumental palette of a girl-group teenage symphony-- zithers, euphoniums, mandolins, and harmoniums along with flutes and a string section. Think Pink Moon on a ""Be My Baby"" scale. For all the richness of the orchestration, the songs at any given moment tend to be mostly spare, offbeat, and repetitive, the intermittent violin and cello crests merely making more space for Bergsman's lonely yearning. One-finger piano plonks bring the singer closer to a distant, kindred spirit on ""Julia"" (""We rarely speak, but I do think of you a lot""). A child could also play the piano part on sing-songy call-and-response ""Hours Pass Like Centuries"", but the contrast with PB&J's John Eriksson's majestic percussion helps convey the way love can ""Leave you singing to the trees/ Then return so suddenly"". An untreated acoustic guitar on marvelously sad opener ""Tell Me"" sounds like it could be in the room with us. ""I don't have much trust in the April sun,"" Bergsman sighs, and turns the Swedish pronunciation of ""July"" into a bleak pun. Crucially, the arrangements are never busy enough to overshadow Bergsman's unmistakable vocals. As cymbals swell and strings drone over ""The Legend"", there she is, cooing and crying and stretching her syllables in that distant, nearly Nico-like accent, describing a loveless woman who, as if she were a Gabriel García Márquez character, becomes transformed into water-- ""Or maybe blood/ Without its red."" Within the quiet longing of ""Too Young"", it can be overwhelming to notice the way Bergsman's voice quivers on the word ""fear"", or her pealing matter-of-factness on the phrase, ""It was not for me."" A delicate piano passage grows out of the sadness like May flowers. Open Field's many subtleties mean it can't be enjoyed just anytime; it practically demands solitude. The tracks work as mood pieces as well as songs, and the mood is so consistent that it takes time for the craft of each composition to peer through, a silver lining on a gray morning. The best place to start is probably the only song not written or co-written by Bergsman: The album's first video selection, ""Lost and Found"". With some of the most constantly full production here, it's a lilting chamber-pop gem worthy of its composer, Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell. Then again, another highlight is Yttling's matter-of-factly named ""Instrumental""-- an orchestral reminder that, as lovely as Bergsman's voice is, it's only one of several reasons to adore her newest project.","Solo debut from former Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman is co-produced by one of her ""Young Folks"" collaborators, Björn Yttling, and features a track written by Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell.

Build a Nation,Bad Brains,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b130b1335d7bf169a234/1:1/w_160/bf49f2a6.jpg,2007-06-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10376-build-a-nation/,Megaforce,"As I'm sure is true of 90% of Pitchfork's readership, I have no epochal stories where my mind gets blown apart at an 80s Bad Brains show-- although I did have a couple of permanent teeth knocked out when I finally heard the band's 1982's self-titled ""yellow tape,"" with songs like ""Sailing On"" and ""Banned in D.C."" positively shredding all advance hype. Unlike the uglier, post-grindcore 90s hardcore I was devouring at the time, there was a clean, hooky quality to Bad Brains' tumult, and though I didn't know it then, the jazz fusion they'd burned through as apprentices in the Chocolate City scene allowed their music to turn at subconsciously funky angles that would have sent most of their peers scrambling for Dramamine. And yes, that they were African-Americans still matters, as should be obvious to anyone who's disconcertingly watched the pasty wave of bobbing heads at a punk show, whether in 1977 or 2007. With that tape as the formalist high point of early hardcore, even Bad Brains themselves had to branch sideways instead of taking us higher, with more gloss and more metal on subsequent LPs. Following the release of 1983's Rock for Light, they would be plagued by legal troubles, break-ups, reformations, and perhaps most humiliatingly, briefly losing the rights to their own damn band name. But even when the reunion albums flopped or singer H.R. ran embarrassingly afoul of the law, we always had the earlier records. The 1996 CD reissue of the yellow tape came with a quote where Adam Yauch of Beastie Boys messed himself over its life-changing qualities, and that überfan status might be part of why he was drafted to record the band's first real comeback album under its true name since 1995's forgettable God of Love. Build a Nation is neither the equal of those first three Bad Brains albums, nor as disappointing as the string that followed. It is, however, an awesome, if intermittently frustrating, release from a band whose musicians, singer, and producer often seem at cross purposes. Age hasn't slowed the band by much, but they've spread out, with Build a Nation picking up where the lowdown, growling grooves of 1986's metallic crossover classic I Against I left off. Bad Brains' twentysomething thrashing-- where they blasted with a fluidity that took your breath away but never sacrificed hardcore's brutish bump-- is still more convincing to my aging punk rocker's ears as the band approaches middle age, at least more so than the mid-tempo, circle pit-friendly material they helped to invent with ""Re-Ignition"". Of course, pioneer status doesn't mean you can't fall prey to blandness, but virtuosity can still get you pretty far when wedded to ballpeen brutality. So at the same time as Build a Nation tracks like ""Pure Love"" and ""Let There Be Angels (Just Like You)"" will win out for fans of the blistering ROIR tape over crunchy headbangers like ""Jah People Make the World Go Round"", Dr. Know's scouring-pad guitar leads (check the opening of ""Universal Peace"" or the breakdown in ""Send You No More Flowers"") still slay 90% of hardcore axe men, and the band's bass sound remains a thrilling drag-strip roar that's been molded into a fluid, jazzy funk-plunk. Plus, the band's reggae is more fully-assed here-- catchy, even-- with the sheet metal dub effects on ""Natty Dreadlocks 'Pon the Mountaintop"" ditching the ersatz quality that often marred their roots. Credit for the sonic brawn has to go in part to producer Yauch, but some of his other studio decisions are a bit more suspect. What torpedoes Build a Nation is the heavy cream of reverb and echo that drowns the vocals-- an especially heinous decision from a producer for whom words are such an important part of his day job, and for a band whose frontman once channeled as much runaway abandon as the guitar or rhythm section. H.R. flits on Build a Nation between two modes-- a gnarled sort of Rasta-Yoda delivering fragmented chant-raps, and that classic Valley skater sneer that bequeathed such helpful concepts to punk as the positive mental attitude and the need to hunt vampires-- but too often he's reverbed into an apparition floating through his bandmates' demolition. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing given that lyrically he's either been spinning his ""one love"" wheels or taking Rasta's homophobic/gynophobic shtick a little too literally since the late 80s, but nonetheless a shame for fans of kineticism. Who's to say whether or not this decision to diffuse the Brains' most distinctive instrument in a smothering layer of distracting effects was a conscious move or a failure of nerve on the part of the singer, producer, or both. It would have been nice if a little more of that classic back-flipping, elbow-throwing energy made it onto the disc.","The seminal hardcore band issues its first comeback under its true name since 1995's forgettable God of Love.

Colour It In,The Maccabees,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b118b1335d7bf169a20d/1:1/w_160/1edc4eda.jpg,2007-06-27 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10355-colour-it-in/,GeffenFiction,"Credit the UK with this: their bands are exceptionally fast at processing trends, evolving in mere weeks where their American cousins often take whole months or-- gasp!-- even years to catch up. As Blur and Oasis battled it out on the charts, dozens of copycats battled it out to be the next Blur or Oasis. Nearly every iteration of U2 instantly inspired its share of imitators. When Radiohead went weird, a hundred British bands went weird with them. After Coldplay hit it big playing nice, many of those would-be revolutionaries decided a hug was better than a slap, and likewise put down their guitars in favor of pianos. Hell, sometimes the British even pick up on American trends before Americans do. Witness the overseas rise of the White Stripes or Strokes before their domestic breakthroughs. In retrospect, the success of the Strokes in particular seems to have been the major catalyst for the UK's current guitar revolution, setting the stage for the galvanizing arrival of the Libertines and, later, the Arctic Monkeys. These are hybrid acts of a sort, shaggy, reluctant, and rough like their fame-wary American indie cousins but still swaggering and confident like their UK predecessors. God only know what the impact of the Libertines or the Arctic Monkeys will fully evince in the near future, but clearly the wheels are already in motion. In fact, however tangential their styles, it's hard to imagine the Maccabees existing without either of those bands as predecessors or peers, not to mention even more likeminded acts such as Bloc Party or the Futureheads (fellow rediscoverers of the Gang of Four and XTC). In fact, even though the Maccabees have been humping it out for a few years now, the group's debut Colour It In sounds so banally of-the-now that it beggars the imagination. Fittingly, it turns out, as imagination is just what the disc so sorely lacks. The Maccabees supposedly settled on their name after picking it randomly from the Bible, which is just as well, since the band sounds like they settled on their sound as arbitrarily, albeit with an eye toward the charts. Indeed, the record is frontloaded with the band's breakthrough UK singles, but those singles do the band no favors. ""X-Ray"", with its call-and-response vocals and slashing guitars, is a total Gang of Four cop. ""Latchmere"" is the band's entry into the proud UK tradition of documenting the quotidian, in this case a London indoor pool and ""leisure center"" (""Latchmere's got a wave machine,"" goes the song). In between is the token XTC number ""All in Your Rows"", making the most out of Orlando Weeks' affected yelp. Later on the group even tosses a few love songs into the mix, albeit love songs of a particularly creepy bent. ""Precious Time"" features the icky Bon Scotty line ""I held you down and I held my own."" ""First Love"" is probably meant to be self-deprecating, but ""I've made my bed I'll lie in it and pillow talk you into it"" is a far cry from clever. And if there's surely a sad back-story to ""Lego"" and ""Tissue Shoulders"", neither is compelling enough to linger too long over. The album doesn't do a lot of lingering itself, but even at a brisk 35 minutes, Colour It In struggles to overcome the suspicion you've heard it all before. Not just from another band, mind, but from just five minutes ago, on the same CD, from the same band. No doubt, there's a certain effortless quality to the rush of hooks and herky-jerk rhythms, but that's not to say the Maccabees shouldn't have put a little more effort into them. With studiously idiosyncratic songs and easy sentimentalism, the group has started its career backed into a corner by its would-be trademarks. The Maccabees are all wound up, but with nowhere to go. At least not until some other band mutates and points them in a new direction.","Meet England's hot new things, same as the old hot new things.

Compass Rose Bouquet,Great Lakes Myth Society,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10813d197565213a574/1:1/w_160/21df257a.jpg,2007-06-27 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10342-compass-rose-bouquet/,Quack,"I thought I had been dragged to way too many Renaissance Fairs and war re-enactments as a kid to stomach Ann Arbor's resident folk historians the Great Lakes Myth Society. Even potentially worse, they sound equally excited to recount regional lore as the people who dress up like Robert E. Lee and Queen Elizabeth for a living. However, the band, which essentially consists of the Original Brothers and Sisters of Love lineup minus violinist Liz Auchinvole, manages to create songs that, while looking back to the past, boast their share of forward-thinking ideas. You could argue that Sufjan Stevens' critically adored depictions of two major Great Lakes states should banish this band to obsolescence. However, whereas Stevens' manifest destiny seems to draw him across the country to record 48 more masterpieces, the Myth Society keeps their eyes on a much smaller, humbler prize. Conjured by the nasally yet charming dual lead vocals of Timony and James Monger, the Mitten State nostalgia often concedes to the much more interesting harmonization and melodies. ""Queen of the Barley Fool"" tells of the age-old one-two punch of inebriation and star-crossed love, its lyrical content no more contemporary than an Irish traditional, yet the track rocks a country-tinged power-pop chorus worthy of a spot on a New Pornographers album. At their liveliest and most reverb-drenched, the hooks here scrape the Shins/New Pornographers stratosphere of catchiness despite a stilted folksy musk continually bringing them back down to earth. Bouncy, threadbare ballads like ""Nightfall at Electric Park"" and ""Stump Speech"" reach for the ear though are eventually willing to settle for a hippy-worthy hug instead, both melting into new age feel-goodness after establishing more urgent melodies. Even when they try to kick out the jams, nature still calls. ""Debutante"" interrupts the album's mostly gentle strumming with churning power chords and a fist-pumping verse, though by the third gooey sing-along chorus it's back to the campfire, the testosterone release over. While they're still chasing down that sort of majestic folk anthem that echoes throughout the mountains, the band improves upon its self-titled debut with a much more consistent, confident album in Compass Rose Bouquet. Sure, they're not holding a candle to the narrative folk of Sufjan Stevens, but they've been doing this regional mythology stuff for about a decade now. Although they're not the catchiest or most emotionally powerful band or even the most popular Great Lakes yarn-spinners, the band's carved a unique niche that no indie folk monolith can wrest away from them.","Michiganders with an historical bent manage hooks that occasionally scrape the Shins/New Pornographers stratosphere of catchiness.

My Ion Truss,Minus Story,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b127c0084474cd0c1d81/1:1/w_160/e85e9091.jpg,2007-06-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10368-my-ion-truss/,Jagjaguwar,"It's a ritual that sometimes seems nearly as old as the recording process itself. A young band, after releasing several homespun self-recorded albums, finally enters the studio with a bona fide producer and the seemingly contradictory intent to capture a more faithful reproduction of their live sound. Such is the familiar course taken by Minus Story on My Ion Truss, the Midwestern group's third full-length release on Jagjaguwar and their fifth overall. With the assistance of veteran producer John Congleton, who has also done the honors for Explosions in the Sky and the Polyphonic Spree, Minus Story have here crafted what is surely their most vibrant and full-bodied rock album to date, although often at the expense of the ramshackle charm of their earlier work. On 2004's The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corpse Dance, Minus Story displayed lo-fi psychedelic tendencies expansive enough to nearly merit unofficial entry into the Elephant 6 squadron. And though My Ion Truss still allows the occasional crazed sax solo or fleeting glimpse of distorted flute, the past few years have seen the group's sound grow considerably more streamlined and amped-up, increasing their resemblance to the rangy, guitar-centered likes of Built to Spill or Modest Mouse. This gradual evolution here comes to fruition in some of the group's most robust material yet, but it appears to make some unfair demands of vocalist Jordan Geiger-- whose earnest, reedy pipes can sound incongruous and faintly overwhelmed as things get progressively noisier behind him. Although Minus Story did include a wry cover of the Misfits' ""Hybrid Moments"" on their 2005 Heaven and Hell EP, there is little in their past catalog that directly foreshadows such raucous new tracks as ""Aaron"" or the hard-driving ""Beast at My Side"". With Congleton's steady hand at the controls, the group was able to record many of the basic tracks for the album live, and these rowdier cuts deliver a surprising and satisfying punch. The anthemic ""Stitch Me Up"" benefits hugely its wide-open live drum sound, as do ""Battle of Our Lives"" and ""Pretty in the Light"" which each use the band's quirky, fitful song structures to amplify the lyrics' own oblique interior dramas. Likewise, on ""The Way Beyond"" the group expertly weaves a rhythm of handclaps and drum machines beneath their vocal harmonies and piano for what seems like a polished, more sophisticated advancement of their early psych-pop pluralism. The skies soon grow quieter as My Ion Truss progresses, however, and the album's second half is weighted heavily with introspective, crooning pop. This trend plays better to Geiger's strengths, as he sounds right at home on the clean, piano-driven ""Parachute"" and the keening ""Mama Mama"", although it can be rather disquieting to hear his boyish voice pleading out to ""mama"" on the latter, sounding like a traumatized teen sent home sick from school. The imbalance between the album's softer and more hard-driving material makes for an interesting dynamic, but one can't help but miss some of the whimsy and scrappy invention of Minus Story's early work. Even so, the group appear so firmly in control of their performances here that there can be little question that this is the sound they've been striving for all along, and that it only took a little help from an outside producer like Congleton to help coax them into their more natural state.","Midwestern group's third full-length release on Jagjaguwar and their fifth overall finds them finally entering the studio with a bona fide producer (John Congleton, who has worked with Explosions in the Sky and the Polyphonic Spree).

Phantom Limb,Pig Destroyer,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f113d197565213a54d/1:1/w_160/f795e8be.jpg,2007-06-27 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10322-phantom-limb/,Relapse,"The amount of wiggle room in grindcore is, well, practically nil. You don't wake up one day and decide, as a modern day grindcore auteur, that you're going to add a string section or a New Orleans brass band or the Polyphonic Spree as backup vocalists. (Even if what I've described there is basically Mr. Bungle.) Grindcore is a genre with established borders-- tempo is beyond fast, length of song is short, guitar tunings are abrasive, vocal-style is either shriek-y high or growl-y low, and subject matter is dark, if not outright disgusting-- that butt up against other genres (death metal on the one end, noise on the other) but are nonetheless patrolled by vicious attack dogs. The fact that Pitchfork is even reviewing a grindcore band is probably a good sign to the faithful that said band is a crossover act or, you know, false metal. Well, yes and no. Pig Destroyer is grindcore, through and through, and on its new album, Phantom Limb, some of the songs are slightly longer (""Loathsome"" tops out at 4:04!) but many are well within the minute-and-a-half range. Singer J.R. Hayes still delivers his serial killer-chic lyrics (""Stench of solvent covers stench of rot/ I didn't even recognize her like a painting/ A masterpiece torn to pieces""; ""Your rib cage is open like a great white's jaws/ Your legs look so sexy out of context"") in an unintelligible, rasping shout that practically sprays you with acidic saliva. The guitars still feel like you're being pushed ear-first into a knife-grinder's stone, and the beats are often still more of a landslide of cymbal and snare than anything you can even bang your head to. The band still deploys shock-horror samples about bodies on fire and whatnot. But Phantom Limb is such a quantum leap even beyond Pig Destroyer's earlier, already pretty fuckin' awesome records that it might as well represent a quantum leap for the whole goddamn genre. Pig Destroyer have always stood slightly outside grindcore's formal restrictions; for one thing, their sound is instantly recognizable, a plus when even fans sometimes have trouble telling one 30-second song from another. The band had no trouble distinguishing themselves at a performance a few weeks ago at the Maryland Deathfest, a three-day festival devoted to extreme metal and grindcore here in Baltimore: Whereas so many other bands that weekend had a rhythm section so tightly wound (and badly tuned) that their snare drums sounded like a guy whacking a hat box with a ballpoint pen, Pig Destroyer had a beefy low-end, a chest-punching, hefty bottom to its blurred blast beats. (All the more astounding considering there's no actual bass guitar involved.) And Hayes' vocals are ugly and shoved through a layer of distortion-- Pig Destroyer actually brought a noise dude, Blake Harrison, in to add, well, noise to Phantom Limb-- but they're never comical, his thick sneer-roar clamping your throat and giving you the evil-eye. All of this carries over on record to Phantom Limb. But what really sets the album apart is riffs. It's still not ""catchy,"" but the chewy bits of Southern-flavored rock'n'roll guitar that Pig Destroyer leaves like bloody gristle on otherwise bleached bones offers something for every rock fan to gnaw on. For a few seconds before the very end, ""Lesser Animal"" verily boogies until it tightens up into the dopesick bad vibes of Eyehategod. ""Heathen Temple"" shrieks like a Judas Priest solo hacked to fleshy chunks before Scott Hull's ZZ Top-meets-Kerry King riffing actually starts pogoing up and down like a lowrider. With another rubbery, bottom-heavy riff, ""Loathsome"" is the most mosh-worthy song of the year-- I know you don't see it much at Beirut shows, but people do still mosh-- and the breakdown is even kinda (eep!) funky. And guitar heroics aren't the only way Pig Destroyer fucks with grindcore orthodoxy on Phantom Limb. ""Fourth Degree Burns"" is a love song, and not one in which Haynes dismembers the object of his affection at the end: ""Tomorrow she'll step on that plane and disappear/ But tonight her lips are real/ And kissing like a head-on collision."" (I guess even romantic metaphors have to be violent in grindcore.) After hearing Phantom Limb, a friend of mine noted that Pig Destroyer ""only do the one thing, but dammit if it's not a fun thing."" And true enough-- even with a palette that now includes veiny blues and sickly greens among the plasma reds and vomit ochres, Phantom Limb is not for everyone, especially if you have a low tolerance for music that delights in its own ugliness. But if you've ever remotely cared about heavy music-- whether you haven't bought a metal record since that last Megadeth LP in junior high or you're neck deep in one-man black metal bands from the ass-end of Tasmania-- buy the fuckin' thing already.","Grindcore band makes a strong pitch for the Metal Album of the Year honors with a record that's such a quantum leap even beyond Pig Destroyer's earlier, already pretty fuckin' awesome records that it might as well represent a quantum leap for the whole goddamn genre.

Tennessee Fire & At Dawn Demos / Mont de Sundua,Jim James,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10ec0084474cd0c1d58/1:1/w_160/2da72ad0.jpg,2007-06-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11904-tennessee-fire-at-dawn-demosmont-de-sundua/,Darla,"One can only imagine Mr. and Mrs. James' reaction when Baby Jim spoke his first word in that God-given reverb-drenched voice of his. It seems more like a congenital trait than a byproduct of the band's recording environment, and James heightens the effect by drawing his Kentucky accent into a unique phrasing pattern. With My Morning Jacket, as well as with his previous Louisville outfit Month of Sundays, that reverb became as recognizable as Michael Stipe's introverted mumbling and Thom Yorke's strangled screech-- a means of distinguishing himself sonically from other bands, but more crucially, a means of communicating mystery in a way that no other sound or instrument could. So it's fitting that Darla Records' long-delayed Tennessee Fire and At Dawn Demos, which collects rough cuts and live takes of songs from the late 1990s and early 2000s, begins with a version of ""The Way That He Sings"", which James didn't write about himself but which many fans might write about him. Aside from an acoustic guitar, it's all vocals-- two tracks layered simply over one another to form both primary and backing vocals. Most of the songs here-- especially those from Tennessee Fire-- are similarly minimal, with little or no input from other band members. The music feels private and personal, as if these songs are creating their own weird spaces where they can play out unmolested by listener or artist intentions. The demos for My Morning Jacket's 2001 breakthrough At Dawn feature more of the band, but without sacrificing that same sense of space. ""The Bear"" and especially ""Heartbreakin' Man"" sound like inspired practice sessions, informal but spirited, while ""War Begun"" and ""Twilight""-- both recorded live at local station WFPK 91.9 FM-- lose only a little of their effect for sounding so clean. Like a painter's early pencil sketches or a writer's margin notes, demos are generally noteworthy only for revealing new facets of the finished, familiar works. In a sense, the Tennessee Fire demos might seem redundant because the studio tracks sound something like demos themselves, but these versions also track James' creative process of turning lyrical and melodic ideas into finished songs. ""Lowdown"" emphasizes his backing vocals more than his lead: Maybe he's singing those ba-ba-ba's as a guide for another instrument, but they become the focus of the song, its primary hook on the demo as well as on the album version. On the other hand, the early version of ""At Dawn"" is still a wisp of a song in search of a full band who can turn it into the heraldic opener that gives the group's second album its title. Delving even further back into My Morning Jacket lore, Removador Recordings and Solutions is releasing the only album by James' previous band, Month of Sundays. They formed in 1992 and recorded their first and only release in 1998, the same year My Morning Jacket formed. Saturated in the same reverb, these songs have seen only the most limited release until now. (They're available under the name Mont de Sundua, ostensibly so as not to conflict with any of the Months of Sundays that have sprouted and withered during the last nine years.) While the songs sound a little unformed and raw, Mont de Sundua is hardly a skeleton in James' closet, and those looking for a Y Kant Tori Read embarrassment or some sort of sordid ska past will be sorely disappointed. Instead, these songs reveal young men just discovering the power of drums and guitars, as well as the possibilities of unusual recording environments. It's often juvenile and unguided, given to meandering passages and noise for its own sake. There's a definite local feeling to the record, too, as if these songs could have been written and performed by any number of skatepunks hanging around outside the public library. But the band play their spacey jams with metal intensity, grinding their riffs into a fine powder on the massive opener ""Space Beast"" and ""One Salty Kiss"". And tracks like ""Wanna See My Bruise Again?"" and the sax-heavy ""Boots Bar"" show James' early range as a singer and songwriter, the group's dark atmosphere and confident quiet/loud dynamics pointing ahead to their career-making Darla output. Both of these releases are best heard alongside the two Darla full-lengths, which remain My Morning Jacket essentials. Instead of shrinking by comparison, these demos actually benefit from proximity to the official versions, offering an engaging and generous career recap and, more importantly, showing how James' songs live and breathe in different forms.","My Morning Jacket fans are given a glimpse into the creation of the band's first two albums on Darla Records' long-delayed Tennessee Fire and At Dawn Demos, while the Removador label reissues recordings from Jim James' pre-MMJ band.

Pick Up Sticks,They Shoot Horses Don't They?,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1065e6ef95969322076/1:1/w_160/5a80c823.jpg,2007-06-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10340-pick-up-sticks/,Kill Rock Stars,"They Shoot Horses Don't They make what could best be described as headache music. It certainly gives me one. It's a shame that other horse band got to the title Everything All the Time before TSHDT could, because it'd be a perfect title for them. The nine members of the band are all almost constantly engaged, blaring away with horns, drums, basses, guitars, and yelping, hyperactive vocals. Both times I listened to it on headphones, I had to keep turning it down to help my ears out and allow myself to think. No doubt this Vancouver collective has a unique sound-- their all-out large band assault has a lurching, dissonant quality that accentuates its busyness and density. The vocals sometimes remind me of Head of Femur, but that band's sense of contour and melody isn't in effect here. Rather, these arrangements have a remarkably flat sense of dynamics for all their diversity. The horns, somewhat reminiscent of King Crimson circa Lizard, are used primarily to deepen the texture, and as such play often with little melodic material to latch onto. Some of the fault for the album's crowded feel lies with the production, which provides no separation between the sounds in the mix. On closer ""Wrong Directions"", for instance, short horn phrases back short vocal phrases while the drums do everything in their power to avoid propelling the song, but all those sounds, and a few others to boot, are rubbing right up next to each other. If the vocal melody were to be memorable at all, any hook it might provide is dashed by interference from the horns. The song has distinct chorus and verse sections, but they're rendered indistinguishable by the cacophonic arrangement and recording technique. That's not to say many of the vocal melodies are especially memorable on their own terms. They tend to consist of clipped phrases contorted to fit the lyrics and fit in with the drum patterns. The lack of driving rhythm means the songs never gain any kind of momentum, and as a result never feel like they're going anywhere. ""The Guest"" starts out dense and just gets denser as the band fakes a buildup by piling on more keyboards and processed vocals, and the rhythm section just thrashes away in place, failing to carry all that noise to a destination. ""A Place Called LA"" actually kicks off with a hook, as a lone organ plays a little two-chord riff, and the drums play along with a galloping beat-- this alone makes it an easy standout, but the vocals are so unmelodic that a lot of the interest generated in those early moments dissipates. Little else separates itself, but there are a few songs that provide interesting moments. ""What Is That?"" is much sparser and quieter than the rest of the record, and though it's melodically engaging, it's a much-needed respite late in the album. ""Speck of Dust"" is also less dense at first, but when the band ramps up two and a half minutes in, it feels less like payoff and more like an intrusion. TSHDT have many ingredients for interesting music, but as on their other two albums, those ingredients as currently employed don't add up to anything very palatable.","Vancouver collective has a unique sound-- an all-out large band assault with a lurching, dissonant quality that accentuates its busyness and density.

Gentleman on the Rocks,Coyote Bones,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b117c0084474cd0c1d62/1:1/w_160/04315678.jpg,2007-06-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10354-gentleman-on-the-rocks/,CoCo Art,"David Matysiak and Mason Brown, formerly of Jet By Day, have created Coyote Bones to perhaps move with the times and shake off their previous moniker and all that came with it. As it happens, Gentleman on the Rocks is all over the place in a way that many contemporary indie rock fans will appreciate. It has glimmers of Annuals' twinkling, close-at-ear guitars, the sashays of Matt Pond, and the jerking, yet peaceful rhythmic patterns of the Junior Boys. The transitions to and from such disparate sounds can be wonderful: The interlude-like wanderings of ""Lightweight Drinking"" meld into the emo throwback ""Grand Eclipse"" by way of organ synths and a simple, forlorn yet sexy guitar line that repeats throughout the song. The whole of ""Eclipse"" is glossed with an ornately electronic atmosphere, making it one of the most engrossing tracks on the album. But there are also less successful tracks like ""Arlington Curse"", a friendly, thumping anthem with a dull melody and too much yelping. The harmonies can be (intentionally?) sloppy, making for an intoxicated, dizzy experience that works for the Hold Steady and some emo aficionados. But Coyote Bones are neither of these-- these days: the pair, with contributions from Orenda Fink of Azure Ray, Dan McCarthy (Tilly and the Wall, Bright Eyes), Jacob Thiele of the Faint, and a handful more, are flitting between popular acoustic and electronic tropes, only occasionally hitting the mark. ""Don't Lose Your Cool"" is an example of when rabid harmonic reaches actually work, sounding purposefully strained and emotive rather than messy and unrehearsed; but that is only a moment of pleasure in an otherwise transitional song. Effects tricks, keys, and drum machines are at pretty much every band's disposal, but it doesn't always feel natural. ""Fated to Fail"" is a blogger's favorite, and the delicate pulsation of beat plus keyboard and fluttering female vocals makes for a lovely three minutes: still anthemic, a bit depressing, and possessing a clarity of sound that perfects the message, a mournful second-person narrative about being true to...your previous band, from the sound of it. The undulating guitars and washes of synth effects on ""Fated to Fail"" and a couple of other tracks are concrete reminders of Jet By Day, and sit squarely between the purely pop and occasionally grungy pieces that permeate the rest of the album. ""Your War"" makes for an irritating finish: It's an attempt at a dirty rock song that is neatly packaged and well composed on its own, but makes little sense as a tack-on to an otherwise elegant and/or peaceable batch. Acoustic number ""Paint on Your Jeans"" is aurally gorgeous but lacks originality of melody or sophistication of idea. ""39 Forever"", however, turns that statement around, being rudimentary with its instruments, but prodding a simple verse at a wildly surprising and strong chorus, which builds strength in numbers and keeps evolving. It's easily the best song on the album, a great wallop of power pop that, once again, makes a pretty transition to the sole piano showcase, ""Buzzing Below"". The band can't be applauded for enacting every musical idea that they do, because not all of them work, but those few good cases bolster the rest, which are, at the very least, engineered and executed well.","Two members of defunct emo group Jet By Day reinvent themselves for a sonically pretty collection of guitar-based pop and rock that is strongest at its most hodge-podge.

Bumps,Bumps,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11ec0084474cd0c1d6d/1:1/w_160/273a26de.jpeg,2007-06-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10360-bumps/,Stones Throw,"A couple of years ago, someone unearthed and posted a number of drum tracks from the recording sessions to Led Zeppelin's In Through the Out Door. Running about 29 minutes and given the name ""The John Henry Bonham Files"", the tracks isolated the technique of one of rock's most versatile and powerful drummers: ""Moby Dick"" proved Bonham could solo, but it was rare to hear him just lay down the rhythm unencumbered by the rest of the band. As a scrap of music history, it's fascinating, but as an album it's not something you'd want to sit around listening to for more than about five minutes-- with nothing but the drums, you start missing Jimmy Page's guitar and Robert Plant's vocals and, hell, even John Paul Jones' synthesizer. So if Bonzo couldn't carry a half hour's worth of recorded material on his own, how could Tortoise's three percussionists pull it off? Apparently, their side project has a specific extra-musical intent: Bumps' debut has been calculated to serve a purpose as a breakbeat record of sorts, which goes a little way towards explaining its appearance on the hip-hop-centric Stones Throw label. And it makes a certain kind of sense, depending on how much it'd cost to farm these out to producers. Samples aren't exactly like fossil fuels-- they're not finite, for one thing-- but they do share the quality of being a lot more expensive than they used to be, and there's been a decade-plus groundswell of visionaries who've spent a lot of time developing inexpensive alternatives. Tortoise are one of post rock's most culturally omnivorous bands, so their percussive core-- consisting of Dan Bitney, John Herndon, and John McEntire-- seem like a good fit for a project like this. Bumps caters extensively to the sample-using demographic's core musical tendencies, with many of its 23 tracks couched in a number of different rhythmic contexts that fit almost every imaginable dance groove. And with nothing but the beat present, it's easy to imagine these rhythms slotted into multiple contexts. The conga and woodblock-augmented freight-train rattle of ""A Safe Balm"" could equally pass for afrobeat or the chase theme from a 1970s action film soundtrack. ""Fun Injury"" captures a lot of big beat's Northern Soul frenzy, but with a bit of judicious cutting and splicing it could also work like a version of jungle's ""Amen"" break turned inside-out. And it's anybody's guess as to who'd be the first to snatch up the bass-drum 4/4 boom of ""Biotic Discussion"": A one-man indie-punk bedroom producer piecing together a pastiche of his favorite A Certain Ratio songs, or a house producer-slash-disco revivalist hooked on recapturing that early 1980s West End Records feel. (Either way, they'd both benefit.) Most of the tracks ride on a malleable percussive tautness, usually starting with a deceptively simple figure and then rounding things out with some additional fills or transitions. And their timbre tends to range from subdued, almost drum machine-esque flatness (""Craven"") to teeming walls of tight-wound bass (""Dawn at Dawn"") to creaking, aluminum-echo-chamber dub (""A Dumb Month""). It's clear that they've accounted for all kinds of production styles and aesthetics for their potential usage as loops; ""Bin Johnston"" sounds clean and resilient enough for radio-ready neo-soul, while ""Can You See?"" pushes things so abrasively into the red that only the most junkyard-aesthetic corners of indie rap could comfortably rock over it. Unfortunately, this isn't just a breakbeat mine-- it's a record, and as a release aimed at the everyday consumer it doesn't provide the most substantial or satisfying experience. As tight and as professional as everything sounds, it's still hard to shake the feeling that this sounds like a demo track from some unfinished sessions. While a few of the tracks stand on their own as likeable diversions and would probably sound interesting coming out of nowhere in a 3,500-song shuffle, there's enough stylistic redundancy and a deliberate sense of unfinished composition (nearly half the tracks are less than 90 seconds, and all but one are 2:02 or shorter) to make listening to it beginning to end the epitome of pointlessness. Some records sound good on a shitty old boombox, and some are most easily appreciated on an expensive hi-fi system with an audiophile turntable, but Bumps is an oddity: album that doesn't really sound its best unless you're patching it through an SP-1200.","Tortoise's three percussionists aim to pull off a half hour's worth of only rhythmic material on this, a breakbeat record of sorts issued by Stones Throw.

Intermission: The Best of the Solo Recordings 1990-1997,Robert ForsterGrant McLennan,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b119ea9e61561daa6716/1:1/w_160/032164d5.jpg,2007-06-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10356-intermission-the-best-of-the-solo-recordings-1990-1997/,Beggars Banquet,"""I miss Grant McLennan"" read the t-shirt worn by Stars singer Torquil Campbell at last summer's Lollapalooza. Surely those sentiments summed up the thoughts of at least a few others in the crowd. A few, but not many. Sadly, for most of their existence and certainly throughout their long 1990s hiatus, the Go-Betweens stayed one of the music world's best-kept secrets, unimpeachably good but somehow unable to convince the masses of their strengths. While the mainstream more or less ignored the group throughout its tenure, the critics raved. When the Australian band's back catalog was first remastered and reissued, each disc came wrapped in a second sleeve covered with breathless contemporaneous accolades, the kiss of death if ever there was one. After all, no one likes being told what's good for them, so whether writ tiny on the CD cover or plastered on billboards, it was probably just not to be. At the same time, the Go-Betweens weren't quite a cult act, either. The songs of Robert Forster and Grant McLennan were too classy for that, too smart, and their audience modest, even by cult standards. The band's albums were more like great little novels, with Forster and McLennan their tandem authors, talked about and taught to a self-selecting student pool but far from beach reads. Not surprisingly, when the group reunited after a long hiatus, only a handful of people showed up to a 1999 acoustic duo gig in Chicago, a pitiful turnout for a band of their stature but a true pleasure for the few that turned up. Admittedly, once the new albums started coming again, that audience grew, but it was a matter of building up lost momentum as well as making up for lost time. Not that the years between Go-Betweens' group activity were in any way truly lost. During the gap, Forster and McLennan embarked on parallel solo careers, with mostly fruitful results. Speaking to McLennan shortly before his death, I told him that I actually liked a couple of his solo albums better than a couple of the much-vaunted Go-Betweens albums. Famously modest but equally honest, McLennan responded, ""I do, too."" Of course, it's McLennan's untimely 2006 passing that's prompted this retrospective of his and Forster's respective solo outputs. No doubt were McLennan still alive, the two would be working on a follow-up to the great swan song Oceans Apart, but Forster was quick to recognize the obvious: Without his musical partner of so many decades, the Go-Betweens were done for good. So here we are, not exactly looking back at a band but at its two principals, and in particular one songwriter who has left us with nothing to look forward to. If the Go-Betweens slipped under the radar, McLennan's solo career was essentially off the map. But as the Go-Betweens' poppier, more conventional (but no less poetic) songwriter, his solo output does deserve to be held in equal esteem with his best Go-Betweens work. Arranged chronologically, McLennan's half of The Best of the Solo Recordings: 1990-1997 features song after song of heartbreak, hooks, and, for the uninitiated, revelations. ""Black Mule"", from Watershed, would have worked on the Go-Betweens' hushed 16 Lovers Lane, while the absolutely gorgeous ""The Dark Side of Town"", the bittersweet pop gem ""Lighting Fires"", and the anthemic ""Surround Me"" (all from Fireboy) must have driven McLennan nuts, knowing that songs as good as those he was cranking out were for the most part destined for the void. In fact, McLennan's 1994 Horsebreaker Star found him recording in America in hopes of finally finding a bigger and more appreciative audience, but as usual the plan failed to work out. Ever prolific, he still came up with a double disc of material, most of it ace (the haunting title track is one of the few to make it to this double disc set). Songs like ""One Plus One"", from McLennan's final solo album In Your Bright Ray, again would have been perfect on some lost Go-Betweens disc, showing how remarkably consistent McLennan remained as a solo act. Robert Forster was easily the more quirky writer in the Go-Betweens, and his solo career reflects that. His half of Solo Recordings, arranged to his liking, features Forster in all his speak-sing glory, making up in charm, modest melody and a curious turn of phrase what he sometimes lacked in outright pop instincts. ""She reminded me of Africa, though I've never been"" (from ""I Can Do"") is the kind of typically enigmatic line Forster regularly gets off over the course of the collection, sung with just a hint of a wink. But Forster was no pop slouch, either, and once again just about every one of his tracks included on this comp could have probably worked as-is on a Go-Betweens album, particularly the more melancholy ""I've Been Looking for Somebody"" and ""I'll Jump"" (though maybe not the Nick Cave-esque melodrama of ""Cryin' Love"" or ""Danger in the Past""). Missing is any material from Forster's more or less disowned covers record I Had a New York Girlfriend, which at least revealed the breadth of the guy's interests with covers from every corner, the expected (Bob Dylan) and the unexpected (Grant Hart) alike. As of late, Forster's been focusing on prose-- music criticism, ironically-- though it really doesn't take an expert or critic to recognize that neither he nor McLennan, collectively or individually, ever stood much of a chance on the charts. That's why they made such great fits for one another in the Go-Betweens. Up to the end, the band made music that demanded to be heard by being as good as it could possibly be, simple as that. That people didn't listen says less about the music than it does about the people not listening. This collection reminds how, despite it all, both writers followed a similarly straight, dedicated and principled path as solo artists, making music very much of a piece with their work in the Go-Betweens while displaying the distinct but compatible differences in that made their collective work so special.","Nearly unequalled in partnership, Go-Betweens songwriters Robert Forster and the late Grant McLennan managed to squeeze in equally strong solo careers when they weren't working together. This double-disc from Beggars Banquet collects some of their best material, recording while the Go-Betweens were on hold.

The Mix-Up,Beastie Boys,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12e13d197565213a5ab/1:1/w_160/c5fd12e8.jpg,2007-06-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10374-the-mix-up/,Capitol,"By virtue of surviving for so long, the Beastie Boys are doomed to perennially attract the hoariest of reviewer crutches: The trip down memory lane. My Beasties remembrances aren't as libelous as some; consisting mainly of a long, sweaty, suburban bike ride to find a record store that would sell me Ill Communication without a parent or guardian present. Boy, the old critical rubric sure was simpler back then, where the Beastie Boys stood apart from all that rap music I was dismissive/scared of for two simple reasons: 1) They used to be a punk band!, and 2) They play their own instruments! Those criteria come back to play half a life later with the Beastie Boys' new record, The Mix-Up, their first all-instrumental non-compilation full-length. Here, the Beasties get half the equation right; as the tepid reaction to To the 5 Boroughs illustrated, not too many people want to hear them rap any more. The other half of the concept is somewhat questionable though, i.e. do we really want to hear what the Beastie Boys sound like as a band? In 2007? After all, the group seemingly only re-picked-up their instruments in the first place to circumvent the copyright hysteria they themselves started with Paul's Boutique, jamming to create sample material and the occasional interlude for Check Your Head and its successors. Yet here is The Mix-Up anyway, with the Boys mic-less, back behind their chosen instruments (Horovitz-- guitar, Yauch-- bass, Diamond-- drums) and swollen to a five-piece with longtime keyboardist Money Mark and percussionist Alfredo Ortiz. The record runs the gamut of the Beasties' instrumental tastes, all the way from dub to funk to dubby funk and funky dub. While less content with Blaxploitation recreation than they used to be, most of The Mix-Up still sounds more like soundtracks for imaginary 70s B-flicks (names like ""The Melee"" and ""Electric Worm"" don't hurt) than the post-punk touchpoint laundry list Mike D offered in advance interviews-- nobody's gonna mistake this record for !!!. It's every instrumental rock record's responsibility to come off as more than just a collection of studio jam sessions, and that's where The Mix-Up ultimately fails. Beastie Boys lore is that they warm up for each record by improvising like-so, but the 12 songs here don't suggest that the results of those exercises are worth more than raw sampling material. Despite lively additions of percussive texture (the whistle on ""The Rat Cage"", the vibes on ""14th St. Break"") and some peppy organ from Money Mark, the Beasties prove little more than their tightness as a band, cred points that would've been valuable 10 to 15 years ago, but are severely deflated after a million praises of the Roots' instrumental chops. True, there are few overtly embarrassing moments here, though the fake-sitar of ""Dramastically Different"" comes close. And very occasionally, the band hits upon something new (for them), like the refreshingly bold (if a wee bit jambandy) guitar riffs that slice through the noodle-funk plod of ""Off the Grid"" and ""The Rat Cage"". But the spic-span production keeps the occasional nugget from proving itself as a potential grade-A break, with no obvious loops jumping out of the speakers like the itchy thud of ""So Whatcha Want"" or the fuzz-punk of ""Gratitude."" More worrisome than anything, there's a distinct lack of fun in the instrumental wankage of The Mix-Up, a bad sign for a band that has seen their results fade in direct proportion to how seriously they take themselves. The soundtrack homage pieces collected on The In Sound From Way Out! may have been the musical equivalent of the goofy costumes donned for the ""Sabotage"" video, but the Beasties' reverence for references was infectious, as songs like ""Son of Neckbone"" worked like no-words versions of their manic name-dropping rhymes. In an environment where a rap group that plays instruments is no longer the novelty it was fifteen years ago, the Beastie Boys could've used a bit of that personality, rather than trying too hard to prove their chops in chin-stroking, and ultimately forgettable, fashion.","Adam Yauch, Mike D, and Adam Horovitz are joined by longtime keyboardist Money Mark and percussionist Alfredo Ortiz on their first all-instrumental non-compilation full-length.

"We Are All Hopeful Farmers, We Are All Scared Rabbits",Badgerlore,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b107c0084474cd0c1d4f/1:1/w_160/2e99321b.jpg,2007-06-25 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10341-we-are-all-hopeful-farmers-we-are-all-scared-rabbits/,Xeric,"Awarding praise or assigning blame with a band like Badgerlore is difficult: First, there's the group's slow, unsteady evolution. Badgerlore started in 1998 as a duo between former Deerhoof member Rob Fisk and Six Organs center Ben Chasny, the pair occasionally rendezvousing in California to record the fragments that comprise 2003's Of Things Too Sorrowful to Be Mindful Of, Of Things Too Beautiful to Possess. And, as if prescient of the tonal, torpid improvisations that have become Badgerlore's hallmark, the band has continued to build itself by deliberately stirring its own pot. For their second LP, Songs for Owls, Charalambides' Tom Carter and Yellow Swan Pete Swanson entered the mix. On We Are All Hopeful Farmers, We Are All Scared Rabbits, their third and most captivating work to date, Jewelled Antler Collective mainstay Glenn Donaldson falls into place alongside Grouper's Liz Harris. The induction of two new members here emphasizes the difficulty of assessing something like Badgerlore too carefully. After all, Badgerlore's members are like the pseudopods of an amoeba, each doing his or her own thing without knowing where their actions will take them. By reaching out and shaping individual sounds with distinct but inherently related motions, the whole band stretches towards something unplanned and unknown. At We Are All Hopeful's best, Carter, Chasny, Donaldson, Fisk, Harris and Swanson separately arrive at such a destination. When that happens, Badgerlore can be mesmerizing. ""Crops That You Tend"", for instance, twists and snarls a banjo through sheets of inseparable guitar noise before unexpectedly releasing into a resplendent chorus, the voices lifting in ghostly, graceful arches above the resonator: ""Find the ones you love the most and hold them tight/ Find the ones you hate and hold them tight,"" the hopeful farmers sing at a molasses creep, variations on the couplet cutting beneath one another. Or take the first seven minutes of opener ""Furbearer"", in which yawning guitars and basses build in tiny increments as sporadic vocal washes drift above them. It's an intentionally soporific lull-- hazy and sullen and gradual-- that finally coalesces into something bigger as if by accident: For 15 seconds, there's the flutter of an overpowering drone, the sounds of eight minutes' wandering funneled into one dark cloud. Then it's gone. These are risks Chasny and Fisk haven't taken together before now, and they're near-total payoffs. Previously, Badgerlore was sometimes crippled by a listlessness that still lingers in parts. Edits of jams reflected different slipstreams of consciousness that occasionally intersected through happenstance. We Are All Hopeful finds Badgerlore hearing ideas and pursuing them with forward motion. ""Grow Your Hair"", the album's late highlight, works counter to common Badgerlore knowledge, opening through a roar of clipped, unified guitars before falling off into near silence. It ultimately builds back into perhaps the most conventional structure in the band's catalogue-- coherent vocals, a regular guitar figure that kind of progresses, and instrumental dynamics that actually acknowledge structure. Though it's hard to say with certainty as he only contributed to one session for We Are, Donaldson-- credited only with banjo here-- seems to be a key catalyst and enabler, if only by influence. A founder of the Jewelled Antler Collective, he performs with acknowledgment of only his and his collaborators' expectations, running his own CD-R label and taking his various projects either into studios or beside riverbanks, a rolling tape documenting both settings. As a member of Blithe Sons, he's experimented with improvising around a core theme, but his work in the sprawling ensemble Thuja has acquainted him with pure improvisation, or building sounds and structures from ether, en masse. On We Are All Hopeful, Badgerlore seem in the spirit of Donaldson, even if Carter and Fisk were responsible for the bulk of these finished recordings. It's important to know that this is just a personal best. Early Badgerlore recordings made it seem like Fisk and Chasny would happily sit in a room forever, recording whatever came to mind with friends, one microphone and a lot of whiskey in tow. They're still doing that, but, to their credit, they've taken more chances on We Are All Hopeful. Still, stacked against some of the accomplishments from Fluxus acolytes, several decades of international psychedelic music or-- closer to now-- the best from Matt Valentine's New England camp, Badgerlore still has plenty of space and texture to fill. But it's nice to know they've gotten this far.","This time the revolving cast of experimentalists centered around Ben Chasny and former Deerhoof member Rob Fisk includes Tom Carter of Charalambides and Glenn Donaldson of Jewelled Antler collective, among others.

Mi Sueño,Ibrahim Ferrer,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1019d034d5c69bf4967/1:1/w_160/7705e1a4.jpg,2007-06-25 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10335-mi-sueno/,NonesuchWorld Circuit,"Ibrahim Ferrer was literally born into music-- his mother gave birth to him at a dance in his hometown of San Luis, Cuba, in 1927. Orphaned at the age of 12, he sold fruit and sang on the streets for money and ultimately found his way into bands that played in the nearby major city of Santiago. The region around Santiago is widely thought to be the home of the bolero song style, but Ferrer didn't sing boleros with the bands and dance orchestras he joined. The style remained in the back of his mind, though, through a career that took him to Havana, where his band Los Bocucos immortalized two of Cuba's great songs, ""De Camino a la Vereda"" and Faustino Oramas' classic composition ""Ay, Candela"", both uptempo son tunes miles removed from the sensual, slowly swaying rhythms and billowing melodies of the bolero. ""Una Fuerza Immensa"", from 1977, was the only bolero in his catalog until his late-life resurrection with Buena Vista Social Club, where he finally got to put his naturally rich and expressive voice to work on one of the all-time great compositions of the form, ""Isolina Carillo's ""Dos Gardenias"". Looking back, it seems obvious that this man, who once accurately compared his own voice with the flavor of Eastern Cuban rum, should have had free reign to sing these songs all along. Mi Sueño, literally ""My Dream,"" is an entire album of boleros and contains Ferrer's final recordings, made in the years before his death in 2005. For a record that focuses so tightly on such a specific form, it's remarkably varied, giving his voice complete freedom to roam through the songs. It's the type of music I've come to appreciate a great deal more as I've grown older, free of pretense and just plain beautiful. Ferrer could have left no better goodbye to the world. It nearly didn't come out. Ferrer died in the midst of recording Mi Sueño, and it wasn't until after a clutch of well-recorded demos were hunted down that the whole album could be pieced together. Another song with fellow elder statesman Rubén González on piano, ""Melodias del Rio"", was added from a 1998 session with Ry Cooder, and the final tracklist runs by like a river of melody and languid, jazz-informed Cuban rhythm. So it's a dream fulfilled late, but thankfully the work was put in to see it through, as there are some amazing performances. ""Perfidia"" is stunning Cuban jazz, with expansive piano from co-producer Roberto Fonseca providing a deep, deep groove that Ferrer sinks right into. ""Cada Noche Un Amor"" nods to the James Bond theme, perhaps coincidentally, in its opening chords, and then dives into a Santiago slow burn, with Ferrer stretching out and just letting the song spill over the chords as the melody demands. Guitarist Manuel Galban, once the leader of vocal group Los Zafiros and long a personal favorite of mine, is right behind, trading intoxicating lead phrases with Fonseca. His brief solo is gorgeous. My favorite, though, is ""Copla Guajira"", where the tempo picks up a bit and Ferrer trades phrases with clarinetist Javier Zalbar. Galban lends his unmistakable, spindly leads, heightening the late night cool of the song. It's wonderful to hear musicians playing in such telepathic sympathy with each other in any context, but that this was a project that so clearly meant the world to Ferrer heightens the passion just that final bit more. Newcomers to Ferrer's music can't really go wrong with his Nonesuch output, and this is as wonderful a place to start as any, though those seeking a bit more history would be well advised to check his volume of Escondido's excellent Cuban Essentials series. For devotees of Cuban sounds, Mi Sueño is a dream come true in any language.","The Cuban singing legend's final album is a collection of boleros, a song form he'd only attempted on record once before.

Honigpumpe,Thomas Fehlmann,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1049d034d5c69bf496e/1:1/w_160/dd68832e.jpg,2007-06-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10338-honigpumpe/,Kompakt,"Thomas Fehlmann's superb new album starts off in the middle of things, like it only reluctantly consented to be heard after the proceedings had begun. Its reluctance isn't a mark of ill will-- it's just that Honigpumpe doesn't really need you. Certain of its tracks would fit into communal rituals on a dance floor, but Fehlmann's work at this point, close to 20 years after he started working with electronic music in Berlin, sounds too assured and in thrall with itself to get worked up over questions it can't wholly account for. That might prove a problem if Honigpumpe weren't so magnetic and warm. Both have long served as operative words for Fehlmann, from his formative days in the Orb (the epochal ambient-house group he still helps steer) to his current era on Kompakt. It's hard to imagine the label's vaunted limp-strut schaffel sound reaching the heights it did without Fehlmann's help, and it's easy to imagine the kind of historical buzz he brings to the wide-eyed house devotees in the Kompakt boardroom. Like the Field's From Here We Go Sublime, a touchstone album it's sneakily better than, Honigpumpe traffics in mid-tempo electronic music that gulps and rolls. It takes a few tracks for the gulps to start: The album starts out in an ambient mood, with a gentle throb building through the first three tracks, before ""Schaum"" turns out the lights to focus on the glimmer of a disco ball set to spin. It's the kind of track a DJ might drop at the beginning of a set to announce his arrival with a portentous stir, and the fact that ""Schaum"" translates as ""foam"" won't surprise anyone with an ear for the billowing synth figures that that rise up from the hissy beat below. It's when that hiss hits hardest that Honigpumpe finds its prime, in part because Fehlmann is so good at his brand of deep-focus production that even a banging beat skews as just one part of what's going on-- as a texture, a riff, a sign. To that end, ""Bienenkoenigin"" moves in time to a forceful techno march, with a mix of harsh metallic clangs and seething tambourines, but it also gets caught up in a playful mix of oompah pump that is anything but austere. Within the same track, you come to recognize one mood, then another, and yet another-- only to realize then that all had been there all along, lurking in the wrinkles that repetition smoothes. Fehlmann and the Field share an affinity for the principle of the changing same, with loops locked into place and left alone, but tracks here like ""T.R.N.T.T.F."" and ""100 Baeume""-- and others tucked within Honigpumpe's majestic second half-- stare down their patterns with more drama and drive. They sound like they're looking for something instead of getting lost in their lids-- which, of course, makes it all the more easy to get lost in your own.","A storied electronic-music veteran makes a strong case for late-period resurrection on another new classic for the German techno label Kompakt.

Desire,Pharoahe Monch,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12db1335d7bf169a22c/1:1/w_160/d005ae29.jpg,2007-06-25 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10373-desire/,InterscopeSRC,"Pharoahe Monch has a stunning hip-hop pedigree. The Queens-born MC went to high school with Mobb Deep's Havoc and Prodigy, founded the seminal Organized Konfusion with Prince Po, and ghostwrote for Diddy on Press Play. But the brain-bending lyricist remains best known for a quartet of laddering synth bleats (the uncleared Godzilla sample from ""Simon Says"" that got his debut solo album, Internal Affairs, pulled from shelves) and a command to ""get the fuck up"" so irrefutable in that ""how the fuck up?"" was the only possible response. His long-delayed sophomore album, Desire, is primed to change that. It's a best-of-both-worlds record, formulated something like this: backpack-rap's sense of social justice (minus shrill self-righteousness) and overclocked verbiage (minus rhythmic malaise) plus the trap star's outsized charisma (minus deadening conspicuous consumption) and furious delivery (plus rampant conspiracy theories). Monch knows it, too, neatly summarizing the dichotomy on ""What It Is"": ""They thought I was backpack/ Slept/ Didn't know that that he kept inside the knapsack..."" This sort of deft reversal characterizes Monch's lyrics (""Slave to a label, but I still own my masters,"" he spits on the title track), as does an existential and oblique approach to well-worn gunplay scenarios. Vocally, he's like a Yankee Ludacris, except that he peppers his durable, booming vernacular with showy clusters of tongue-twisting homophones. And like Nas in his prime, Monch combines several skill sets into a seamless package: A vivid narrative imagination and the control to bring it to life, a knack for dizzying extended metaphors and haymaker punchlines, and a complex moral sense. Any given track on Desire displays one or two of these attributes-- ""Let's Go"" sustains a rhyme scheme built around the names of various handheld peripherals; the braggadocio-driven title track is full of wild puns like ""even if you were ashes you couldn't ""urn""-- but the best embody them all. In the epic, revenge-fantasy closer ""Trilogy"", a chorus comprised of Mr. Porter (in the funky first act), Dwele (in the elegiac second), and Tone (in the boom-bap third) provides narrative compression and interior monologue. ""Trilogy""'s fantastic pacing and its use of music as a storytelling supplement only adds to its high-wire tension. Monch might flounder into familiar indie territory if his music weren't so lucid and lively. He gives his backup singers and shapeshifting beats plenty of room to breathe, especially on the tracks he produced himself. On the anthemic ""Push"", he drops in for one climatic verse after a long gospel workout moistened by Tower of Power horns, and on ""Body Baby"", he forgoes his usual boom in favor of brisk syllabic shards that slot neatly into the music's juke-joint bounce. Producers like 99 Fingaz, Alchemist, and Detroit up-and-comer Black Milk give Monch the kind of extraterrestrial soul he's built for. The only duds are the genre exercises: The maddeningly insistent guitar noodles during the Public Enemy throwback ""Welcome to the Terrordome"" are a long way from the Bomb Squad's Prince-sampled shredding, while the disposable ""Bar Tap"" shows that club tracks aren't one of Monch's strong suits. Monch also handled production on ""What it Is"", where conspiratorial whispers and an urgent synth monotone make the thread of paranoia running through the record sonically explicit. This conspiratorial bent, combined with the album's interludes (which range from civil-rights polemics, meditations on telekinesis, and a satire of Clear Channel-controlled FM radio), give it a recondite feel. Yet Monch's fantastical side is tempered by hyper-modern references to the Iraq war, stem cell research, Hurricane Katrina, and*,* in a clear moment of weakness, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. His penchant for working hot-button topics into his rhyme schemes is so pronounced that you almost expect to hear about troop surges and colony collapse. The long wait for Desire is due largely to the Rawkus/Geffen debacle, and Monch isn't happy about it-- as on Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury, his frustration with being stuck in label-purgatory is apparent in pockets of the album. The first time he speaks, on the whammy-barred screed ""Push"", it's to liken the rap industry, with its ""choruses of cocaine, tales of black heat,"" to indentured servitude. ""Now switch that advance for your emancipation!"" This angry-prole stance pervades the album; Monch seems more concerned about labels fucking with his personal agency than his money. He doesn't take pride in wealth like cocaine rappers, nor does he take pride in poverty like their undie foils-- he seems more interested in specific self-definition than on picking a side in rap's culture war. At a time when a thread of unquestioning capitalist acquiescence runs through an otherwise lively and diverse rap climate, Monch's embattled anarchism isn't just refreshing, it's inspiring.","This long-delayed sophomore album is a best-of-both-worlds record that combines a backpacker's sense of social justice and overclocked verbiage with a mainstream star's outsized charisma and furious delivery.

Easy Tiger,Ryan Adams,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b121ea9e61561daa672c/1:1/w_160/72b66bcc.jpg,2007-06-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10363-easy-tiger/,Lost Highway,"This was not the Ryan Adams album I was expecting. I ended up downloading the leak like a hardened criminal because these days labels send out the kind of CDs that don't play on computers (otherwise, albums might leak). Squinting at my iPod, I misread the title of one of the songs as ""Ryan Adams Rip Off"", and I suddenly hoped this was going to be his self-referential comedy album. You know, the follow-up to recent stunts like Adams' online-only 2006 hip-hop debut ""Welcome to Ryan Adams Dot Com Motherfucka (Aw Shit)"". That there's a track called ""Halloween Head"" only furthered my suspicions. A couple of days later I realized all the songs on my MP3 rip had Ryan Adams' name in the title; there's just a tagging error I'd somehow only noticed on one. As it turns out, the singer-songwriter's ninth studio album since Whiskeytown is more consistent-- if more predictable and less spectacular-- than pretty much any other record in his exhaustive catalog. If 2001's Gold was a bid for the ""multi-platinum ring,"" as Pitchfork's Chris Schiel put it, the music on Easy Tiger suggests Adams is vying for a spot on the Starbucks CD rack*. * This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in contrast to Gold, or his inspired 2000 solo pinnacle Heartbreaker, the move feels like a forced attempt to grub some crossover dollars and prime retail exposure. Hell, it just might work, even if there's no ""New York, New York"" here, or ""Come Pick Me Up"", or whichever your favorite Adams song might be. Because even while Easy Tiger consists mostly of second-tier Adams songs, it remains blessedly free of the third-tier compositions that marred 2002's Demolition, 2003 two-fer Rock N Roll and Love Is Hell, and the last of Adams' 2005 triptych, 29. These new songs don't always offer enough to cling to after repeat plays the way his best songs do, but producer Jamie Candiloro-- who has also worked with R.E.M., Luscious Jackson, and Luna-- helps put together a sonic landscape that makes any room feel oh so tastefully arranged. Adams has used several of his albums to stake out new (old) stylistic territory the way other bands switch wardrobes. Easy Tiger, however, is practically a compilation of his past seven years, minus Rock N Roll's new wave bent. The Cardinals, who played backup on the three 2005 LPs, return here to the loose, dueling-guitar jams of Cold Roses on opener ""Goodnight Rose"", and to the steel-twang country of Jacksonville City Nights on ""Tears of Gold"". They even leave Adams alone for Heartbreaker-style finger-picking on the lonely-boy lament ""These Girls"" (a cast-off from 2000's unreleased Destroyer). Despite harmonica that recalls ""Come Pick Me Up"", the wistful finale ""I Taught Myself How to Grow"" might just as easily belong on sad-bastard Anglophile outing Love Is Hell. So could another crashing piano ballad, ""Off Broadway"", about being lost in your own city. For a change, let's talk about Adams' voice-- how he shapes phrases and sentences, and occasionally slides them around the edges of the beat during ""Goodnight Rose"" and the mellow acoustic rocker ""Everybody Knows"" (with its heartbreaking refrain, ""You and I together, but only one of us in love""). A gifted chameleon, Adams' voice transforms from a fragile After the Gold Rush whine on ""Off Broadway"" and the album's finale, to a huskier, low-register rasp on dull mid-tempo rocker ""Two Hearts"" and the folky ""Oh My God, Whatever, Etc."" He goes husky to a fault on the contrived ""The Sun Also Sets""-- a stark contrast to his stoic country croon on the down-home ""Pearls on a String"". Fittingly, the free-wheeling opener and its anachronistic vernacular (""the whole she-bang"") take Adams back to the Jerry Garcia tones of Cold Roses, stretched rolling-paper-thin. If what Adams is singing often veers toward vague maxims (""Don't live your life in such a hurry/ Life goes by us all too fast""), at least he's got the delivery down. I wasn't entirely off-base about Easy Tiger's good humor, either. ""Rip Off"" is just a moseying country-rock exercise that packs some brutal honesty (""It's a little too late for goodbyes,"" Adams opines), but chugging rocker ""Halloween Head"" is so much funnier than its title suggests: ""Here comes that same old shit again/ I've got a Halloween head,"" it begins. When there's a guitar solo, Adams shouts, ""Guitar solo!"" And when the song ends, we hear piped-in thundershowers, straight out of the Doors' ""Riders on the Storm"". Just as another larger-than-life figure, R. Kelly, went from ""Bump N' Grind"" to ""Ignition (Remix)"" to the comic stylings of ""Sex Planet"", Adams has gone from ""My Winding Wheel"" to ""Wonderwall"" to this. Man, I really wish he'd made a whole album's worth. The full-court press push behind Easy Tiger suggests that the AOR consistency of its music is the result of Adams' newfound sobriety. (Then again, the guy has self-mythologized so long we should assign ratings to his news clippings.) But ""Two"", the album's first single and a duet with Sheryl Crow, encapsulates Easy Tiger's best and worst-- a tight band, spare yet evocative vocals, but also undercooked lyrics and a twangy, light-rock approach that verges on total snooze.

Cue,Andrew Pekler,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11bea9e61561daa671c/1:1/w_160/c740c151.jpg,2007-06-22 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10358-cue/,Kranky,"Last year, Berlin-based producer Andrew Pekler toured with Jan Jelinek as part of the Kosmischer Pitch band. He's been making music under several names for almost a decade, first gaining notice in 2000 as Sad Rockets, releasing Transition on Matador when the label experimented frequently with electronic releases. Though he's not prolific by the standards of electronic music, Pekler's method reminds me a bit of Atom Heart or Burnt Friedmann: each record is meant to sound different, based on a considered set of aesthetic guidelines. Pekler's time hanging around Jelinek-- after having previously been his labelmate on ~scape-- seems particularly significant here on his latest record. For Cue, Pekler's M.O. was to assemble music using ""library"" records as inspiration. These are those weird LPs you now sometimes find in the ""Misc."" section of record stores, containing music for royalty-free ""needle drop"" use in commercial applications. Pekler took descriptions of the intended effect for various tracks (""slow, ominous piano motif drifting into swirling atmosphere""), and built new tracks, attempting to arrive at these moods from another angle. Knowledge of his process is unnecessary for enjoying Cue. Pekler's use of such sterile material certainly contributes to the record's unusually disjointed feel, but these tracks don't seem tied to any particular era and certainly aren't meant for background use. His fondness for dense, overlapping loops as the basic unit of composition does, however, resemble the direction Jelinek has taken on his last two records, Kosmischer Pitch and Tierbeobachtungen. Each of these tracks sounds build from five or six or ten samples that are cut into pieces, set in motion, and allowed to bump into each other. This approach, while necessarily limited in terms of dynamics, results in a handful of very interesting tracks. ""Rockslide"" even edges toward brilliant, with a droning tone up front that seems to skim along the surface of the beat like a stone across water, its pitch bent into chord-like shapes that, heard over steady floor toms, even manage to get a pretty funky. Indeed, the sound of drums throughout is striking and weird in a good way-- the extreme aridity of the beats opening ""On"" is the sort of thing Steve Albini hears in his dreams, and the exceptionally spacious ""Pensive Boogie"" sounds like a sack of assorted percussion tumbling down the stairs in slow motion, with some of the sounds moving backwards. ""Vertical Gardens"" is one of the places where the samples show their age, the cheap synth outlining the chords evoking early electronics nostalgia in a manner reminiscent of the bubbly, bright electro-pop of Schlammpeitziger, but with an additional layer of abstraction. ""Mote"", one of a few short interludes that take one idea and runs with it for a minute or two, gets a lot of mileage from some cut-up piano bits, sounding like a player piano with a shredded roll that has been left alone in a decaying ballroom. All in all, Cue is very subtle. Aside from ""Rockslide"", none of the tracks leaps out and demands to be regarded, despite the widely varying use of textures, tempos, and layering. But it's the sort of record that gets more interesting the deeper you get inside, as its old and strangely disembodied samples assemble into something new and occasionally even fleshy.","Experimental electronic musician here is inspired by ""library"" records, taking descriptions of the intended effect for various tracks, building new tracks, and attempting to arrive at the same moods from other angles.

The Scenery of Farewell EP,Two Gallants,by: Sara Sherr,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1095e6ef9596932207b/1:1/w_160/bd84b545.jpg,2007-06-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10343-the-scenery-of-farewell-ep/,Saddle Creek,"Two Gallants are no strangers to controversy. What the Toll Tells, their 2006 debut for Saddle Creek, included ""Long Summer Day"", a song written from the perspective of a slave, which raised issues of racism and misappropriation, including from Pitchfork reviewer Brian Howe. Then, while playing a show last fall in Houston, the San Francisco duo had an unfortunate run-in with the police that ended in violence and arrest. Their ultimately triumphant legal battles and hectic tour schedule left Adam Stephens and Tyson Vogel little time to craft a proper full-length (one is due out in September), so in the meantime they've recorded some acoustic tracks at sound checks and radio appearances. Many of the EP's themes are about life on the road, alienation, and loneliness, the struggle to keep long distance (geographical and emotional) relationships going and when to say goodbye to them. String-drenched opener ""Seems Like Home to Me"" is a weary lament about a woman with oceans for eyes. ""Lady"" goes ""where the hobos sleep"" and admits to ""count[ing] my thoughts with coffee spoons."" The strings and harmonicas of ""Up the Country"" lament, ""I've seen salvation's yard but every highwayman's been barred."" ""All Your Faithless Loyalties"" is an early Dylan-styled kiss-off akin to ""It Ain't Me Babe"". With the piano ballad closer, ""Linger"", it's hard to tell if they are men in love or men at war. Love is a battlefield, after all. While the intimate settings give Two Gallants a different palette for themselves and their fans, as well as a spotlight on their literate lyrics, the songs are a little too similar sounding. The Scenery of Farewell is a decent lazy summer listen, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression and is probably not enough to convert anyone who isn't already a fan. In turning down the volume, the band loses much of its unique personality, love it or hate it.","The Saddle Creek duo, recently a lightning rod for controversy, return with a record of acoustic tracks recorded at sound checks and radio appearances.

Collective Psychosis Begone,Hallelujah the Hills,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11a5e6ef95969322092/1:1/w_160/c38f58e7.jpg,2007-06-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10357-collective-psychosis-begone/,Misra,"As part of his ""Promiscuous Materials"" project, author (and EMP conference keynote presenter) Jonathan Lethem made available on his website the lyrics to several partially completed songs he'd been stowing away for the past 20 years, for musicians to adapt however they liked. Boston sextet Hallelujah the Hills took the scant text of Lethem's ""Monster Eyes"" (""Can you feel my eyes abhor you?/ Better run, better run"") and turned it into a somewhat creepy lo-fi dirge, debuting the completed song at Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline, Mass. The collaboration was a fitting first foray into the public eye for HtH, whose debut album Collective Psychosis Begone reveals a group clearly inclined toward the bookish end of the musical spectrum. A verse-ending lyric from the breathlessly delivered ""fight song"" that doubles as the band's name underscores its academic accent: ""made inventions, broke conventions/ Raised a glass to new pretensions/ meta-meta-meta-and the novel is dead. Literary existentialism aside, ""HtH"" (the song)'s exuberant horns and strings combine with its reference-desk references to position HtH (the band) in the Venn diagram overlap between the two most currently prominent strains of Anglo-ethnic indie rock. The band's ensemble structure (cello, trumpet, and melodica) and learned lyricism echoes the stage-packing sounds of Arcade Fire, Danielson, Bright Eyes, and Decemberists, while its shambolic, maximalist barroom aura recalls Robert Pollard, another songwriter infrequently at a loss for words. Anyone even slightly familiar with Pollard will recognize his influence on Ryan Walsh's songwriting. The lyric ""let's all plug in to the telepathic disco,"" which feels traced from Pollard's handbook of power-pop processionals, marks a minor crescendo in album-opener ""Sleeper Agent""; triggering strings to swell, a gang of voices to appear, and temporarily expanding the song into a barroom singalong, perhaps for a pub full of creative writing majors just finished with finals. It gives way to what is easily the album's best song; the irresistable ""Wave Backward to Massachusetts"". Feeling like an excerpt from Alien Lanes or Under the Bushes, Under the Stars, ""Wave"" exhibits Walsh's similar (if not quite as ingratiating) knack for crafting fist-pumping anthems from absurdist word clusters. Don't think he's unaware of this, either: on its way toward yet another raved-up, string-laden ending, slow-burner ""The House Is All Lit Up"" offers that ""non-sequiturs built this nation."" While never again reaching the giddy level of ""Wave"", Collective does tackle a wide variety of subject matter. ""Effie's On the Other Side"" is the most melodic morgue-robbing tale you'll hear all year, and the Golden Age ode ""It's All Been Downhill Since the Talkies Started to Sing"" sets a film-studies fever dream atop fuzzed-out guitar. The extended freak-out coda sticks around for about two minutes too long; like Pollard and so many college seminar papers, Collective could use an editor in places (the song titles, perhaps, and the over-used horns), and at times comes across as a collection of citations without a balance of original vision. As a first draft of Hallelujah the Hills' future potential, however, it's definitely worth a bit of polish.","Debut album from a very promising Misra band clearly inclined toward the bookish end of the musical spectrum.

Playtime Is Over,Wiley,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10d5e6ef95969322081/1:1/w_160/efe1e6d7.jpg,2007-06-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10346-playtime-is-over/,Big Dada,"Playtime, amongst other things: Aside from the possibility of doing some by-request production jobs and mentoring younger artists, Wiley was originally planning on retiring from the grime scene after this album. Yeah, I know, rap retirements-- but he's gone through a lot of shit, whether recent (the fumbled pop-crossover of his Roll Deep crew's 2005 album In at the Deep End) or longstanding (""I'm getting threats but it's never stopped in 10 years,"" he told RWD Magazine during his ""farewell"" interview). Considering he had a beef at some point with almost everyone who appeared on Run the Road and is approaching 30 with a baby daughter in tow, the urge to step into the background is an understandable one-- even if there's little indication on his supposed last album that he's had it on his mind.
*
Playtime Is Over* caps off Wiley's career in a low-profile fashion, considering that the progression he's taken since he dropped the ""Eskimo"" riddim on an unsuspecting underground in 2002 can be measured in inches. While Dizzee Rascal took a few risky chances on switching up and Americanizing his style for Maths + English-- released, significantly enough, the same day as Playtime Is Over in the UK-- Wiley has kept his formula mostly intact: skittering, hiccuping bounce rhythms, synths that sound like a turbocharged Super Nintendo with a subwoofer attached, and a manic, borderline-toasting flow that plows through everything in its path. Wiley's deficiencies as an MC aren't overwhelming, but the possibility that his retirement may just consist of him stepping away from the mic while continuing to produce seems like a decent outcome. His voice is a hell of an instrument in itself, a ragga-inflected string of serrated, lightning-quick jabs, but it spends a little too much time barreling over beats like they're suggestions instead of backbones. Opener ""50/50"" is a sharp bit of lyrical work, wrapping a few tight phrases around a titular term that typically wouldn't give much room for them (""I'm 50/50, nifty nifty/ Got the best deal, nobody can twist me/ Anytime somebody tries to shoot me/ I flip the ball they miss me, miss me""), but by the second verse he's dropping syllables off-rhythm and his inflections fight distractingly against the beat. ""Gangsters"" (one of three tracks carried over from 2006's self-released Da 2nd Phaze) is a loosely-associated string of threats and observations with only one word-- an icy, synthetic female voice echoing ""gangsters""-- holding his verses together, and technically there isn't even really much rhyming involved: ""We just had a wave of new (gangsters)/ Yeah, I think there's been a rise, more (gangsters)/ Imagine that, I'm a street kid brainy like (gangsters),"" and so forth. It's weird that someone with such a straightforward lyrical style is so frequently thrown off by his own beats, but after hearing ""Bow E3""-- where Wiley's postal-code hood-rep is halfway submerged under Maniac's production and constantly undercut by a stuttering, omnipresent hook-- you begin to miss how his voice sounds, flaws and all, when it has breathing room. And there's a couple tracks where he gives himself plenty of it, often with some uncharacteristically gentle touches. ""Baby Girl"" is the most notable example, a dedication to his daughter that tempers his typical gruffness with a soothing flute/Mellotron loop and paternally poignant lyrics about teaching her the music business when she grows up. ""Letter 2 Dizzee"" is the other standout moment of raw feeling, where his side of the beef with his onetime protégé is played out with more wistfulness and disappointment than straight-up fury, reminiscing about coming up in the business together and couching a tentative ceasefire in shit-talking lingo: ""Nothin' ain't changed except I'm the best now/ It don't matter, I'm still your big brother."" (Given how calm and reconciliatory he sounds, it's probable he cut this before Dizzee's alleged Wiley dis ""Pussyole (Oldskool)"" dropped.) Still, Wiley's always been strongest as a producer, arguably as important to the rhythmic aspect of grime's development as Dizzee was to the vocal. Even if there's little here that's surprising to anyone who heard 2004's Treddin' on Thin Ice, there's no sign of any creative entropy behind the boards; the Castlevania creep of ""Johnny Was a Bad Boy"", the elbow-throwing conga line of ""Eski-Boy"" and the electro tinges in ""No Qualms"" round out an album that's varied enough to serve as a solid final mission statement. And the guest spots featuring young, ambitious up-and-comers like Scorcher (who sounds like Wiley's smoother-voiced doppelganger on ""Flyboy"") and Jukie Mundo (growling like a rudeboy version of M.O.P. on ""Stars"") could serve as a preview for what Wiley's post-""retirement"" mentorship itinerary might involve down the road-- dense, precise beats with intricately flexible drum programming, fronted by a new generation of grime torchbearers. But suitably enough, the best beat on this album is on the final hidden track: Like his name-making ""Eskimo"", it's an instrumental with icy electronics and elastic bass, but it's also got a massive rhythm built on Lennox Lewis-force handclaps and a loose-limbed tempo that smoothly shifts gears from an off-center grime rhythm to a pounding, pseudo-house 4/4 for roughly seven seconds, just because it can. The bonus track's name: ""Where's Wiley"". Hopefully not a question we'll have to ask two years from now.","If this really is the grime producer's swan song, * Playtime Is Over* caps off Wiley's career in a low-profile fashion, considering that the progression he's taken since he dropped the ""Eskimo"" riddim on an unsuspecting underground in 2002 can be measured in inches.

After Dark,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b114c0084474cd0c1d5d/1:1/w_160/5eaac4f7.jpg,2007-06-22 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10351-after-dark/,Italians Do It Better,"A compilation like this has been a long time coming. In 1997, Holland-based DJ/producer I-F basically invented electroclash with his underground dance hit ""Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass"". Two years later, he helped catalyze the ongoing Italo-disco revival with one of the genre's most essential compilations, Mixed Up in the Hague, Vol. 1, a DJ mix that pulled together defining cuts like Mr. Flagio's vocoder-fronted ""Take a Chance"" and Klein & MBO's ""Blue Monday""-influencing ""Dirty Talk"". Since then, other DJ mixes such as Morgan Geist's Unclassics have kept vintage Italo on turntables, while I-F's Italo-focused Cybernetic Broadcasting System has deepened the canon for real devotees. 2007 may be remembered in some circles for its dance-rock hybrids: Klaxons and Justice, ""nu rave"" and ""blog house,"" each ably filling in for the dance-punk and electroclash of previous trend cycles. But it's also a year when significant numbers of contemporary artists have embraced Italo's Giorgio Moroder-styled synth arpeggios and brought them into the new millennium. Sweden's Sally Shapiro and Cloetta Paris are breathing new life into the wispy synth-pop of Italo singer Valerie Dore, while the UK's Kathy Diamond is making beardo synth-pop with producer Maurice Fulton. The enigmatic Black Devil Disco Club's 28 After could've been made any time in the past 30 years. In the icy winter afterglow of Shapiro's Disco Romance, Portland, Ore. acts Glass Candy and Chromatics helped keep Pitchfork HQ's Italo love aflame with their first releases for Italians Do It Better, a new label from Troubleman Unlimited founder Mike Simonetti. Viva Italia. On After Dark, the fledgling imprint assembles mostly vinyl-only or previously unreleased tracks by its current roster, which also includes Farah, Mirage, and Professor Genius. Produced in substantial part by Glass Candy guitarist Johnny Jewel, the comp is practically a Mixed Up in the Hague for present-day Italo, only with the darker ambiance its title implies. Where its precursor could at times play up Italo's proclivity for cheese (once experienced in the U.S. via minor Eurodisco hits by the likes of Falco and Taco), this album wisely eschews ironic winks and kitsch-for-kitsch's sake. Shapiro might find an indie pop romance in Italo, but After Dark lovingly re-imagines the style as retro-futurist noir-- a sleek soundtrack to lives of moral ambiguity in post-urban shadows. The best tracks on the compilation embody that eerie slant on the old Italo throb/pulse without letting an air of minor-key reflection lapse into air quotes. On the extended 12"" version of Chromatics' ""In the City"", the crackle of vinyl, distant synth swoops, skeletal drum patter, and singer Ruth Radelet's narcoticized murmurs about ""midnight workers"" and a ""concrete river"" evokes rain hitting sidewalks. Glass Candy's Italo coming-out, ""I Always Say Yes"", is conspicuously absent, but their hazy ""Rolling Down the Hills (Spring Demo)"" opens the disc with horns and singer Ida No's deadly cold vocal presence. After Dark's other acts approach the compilation's dusky Italo aesthetic from similar perspectives. New Jersey-based Professor Genius homes in on the dystopian synth work of Vangelis and the upbeat expressiveness of Alexander Robotnick on instrumentals ""La Grotta (Demo)"" and album-closing ""Pegaso"". The vocoder makes its sole appearances on two tracks by Italy's Mirage (""Lady Operator"", ""Lake of Dreams""), but Mirage uses the instrument to enhance singer Julius' alienation, not to dish cheap nostalgic thrills. Texas-based Farah keep up the metronomic beats and analog cascades, but ""Dancing Girls (Suite 304 Demo)"" adds a section sung in Persian, while the spoken-word monologue of ""Law of Life"" sounds like a scripture reading from a church of the damned. It's one of the few moments on After Dark that seems stilted as much as reverent. For plenty more reverence, look to the album's cover versions. Though occasionally distracting, After Dark's updates of older compositions are good signposts: Glass Candy's relatively direct take on Kraftwerk's essential 1981 ""Computer Love"", or a lavishly orchestrated rendition of Paris-based Eurodisco group Belle Epoque's 1977 ""Miss Broadway"" (later sampled by rapper Special Ed on 1990's ""Come On, Let's Move It""). Not quite a cover, but Mirage's remix of Indeep's 1982 classic ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" adds evocative Italo synths to the original's spare, post-disco bass line and early hip-hop vocals. In addition, both Glass Candy and Chromatics cover songs by ex-DNA member Robin Crutchfield's Dark Day, particularly suiting Glass Candy's shift from no-wave to disco. A tinny analog synth rotates through slight arpeggio variations without giving way to a shift in mood on Glass Candy's cover of ""The Chameleon"", haunted by suicide and unnamed attackers. The steady snare thwack and detached atmospherics on Chromatics' version of the catchy ""Hands in the Dark"" suggest Chromatics' MySpace quote-- ""Night Drive""-- fits them even better than it does Jan Hammer riffer Kavinsky's recent ""Testarossa Nightdrive"", though here it's surely a drive headed toward despair. So there it is: Italo survived electroclash. And the recent explosion of Italo disco-inspired acts culminating (for now) in After Dark probably suggests the style will survive current indie-dance trends as well. In an interview for Australia's Rave Magazine, Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford (who produced the latest releases by Klaxons and Arctic Monkeys) says of his own dance-pop outfit's swooning single ""I Believe"": ""We've been getting into loads of slow, dreamy disco stuff-- the Emperor Machine, and a pair of bands in particular called Chromatics and Glass Candy-- and it partly came about like that."" Just don't look for Justice to follow suit quite yet.","Possessed by a genuine love of classic dark electro and vintage electronics, the new Italians Do It Better label reimagines the Italo-disco of the 1970s and 80s as stark, retro-futurist noir electro. Sparse, skeletal, and consumed by a constant sense of creeping dread, After Dark is the sleek soundtrack to lives of moral ambiguity in post-urban shadows. Rising stars Glass Candy, the Chromatics, and Mirage appear.

Fantastic Hawk,Bottom of the Hudson,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11313d197565213a585/1:1/w_160/f5696fa3.jpg,2007-06-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10350-fantastic-hawk/,Absolutely Kosher,"Bottom of the Hudson was once primarily a one-man band, releasing two patchwork demo-sounding albums before pulling together the effortlessly great and unfortunately overlooked Holiday Machine EP in 2005. That record was steeped in both the proud melodies and personal intimacy of 1990s indie, treading that balance easily thanks to the clean lo-fi aesthetic of bedroom auteur Eli Simon. In reviewing that EP for Pitchfork, I belabored a comparison between BOTH and Guided by Voices, which wasn't completely fair; it's not like they're the only two bands with equal affinity towards lo-fi recording and the British Invasion. They're both rare in how well they can balance the two, however, and Fantastic Hawk shows that and more. It's an album of simple, irresistible melodies and slow, subtle crescendos and insinuations that earn the band's occasional grand gestures. While Fantastic Hawk makes use of a real studio, Simon's best songs transcend however they may be recorded. ""Pretty Much It"" exemplifies his ability for laconic vocal melodies that tug on the ears and pull us in like a familiar scent. ""Perfect Distillation"" (a phrase you'll likely only read in record reviews) builds slowly and cautiously to its perky, note-perfect chorus, while the ascending guitars on the sneaky coda of ""Suffering Time"" are cannily constructed and immaculately delivered. So there's tracks that would sound great in any setting, and tracks that meet new sounds halfway, like the woodwinds that pop up in the final moments of ""Fantastic Hawk"" or the Elvrum-like acoustic scrape of ""Rusty Zippers"", which puts all the burden on Simon's arresting vocal regardless of the oboes and zithers that garnish it. There are also songs that, given the new studio treatment, should hit harder than they do: The raining marimbas and insistent guitar chug of ""Bee Hive"" cry out for top-down highway drives, but its strangely demure rhythm section keeps it stuck somewhere between intimacy and grandeur. ""Over Engineered"" is an overcooked lighter lifter with sheets of underwhelming shoegaze-stolen static. ""Cemetary Gates"" in particular punches at the walls of the band's limitations. From the staccato fake-out drums to the skittering drum pads, experimental and scattered under Simon's gift for traditional songwriting, its potential shines through while still begging for a more sympathetic producer. Of course, as with the case with many of our favorite lo-fi bands (including the aforementioned GBV), we tend to love them during their formative years and turn on them when they get access to real studios and recording budgets. Fickle, maybe, and not something to accurately level at BOTH, but maybe we love not only these bands' tunes but their potential, embracing their would-be classics in their roughened state while believing they'd conquer the world if given a chance. Bottom of the Hudson deserve more than their small, fervent following, but while Fantastic Hawk has plenty of new sounds and strong moments, it seems to lack that world-conquering ambition.","Bedroom auteur Eli Simon ditches his Guided By Voices-like lo-fi aesthetic-- best realized on 2005's overlooked Holiday Machine EP-- for a full-studio approach.

Even more than other potentially forbidding 2007 dance music sub-genres like minimal techno-- paired down to its ultra-serious essentials but at least always mutating along some new and/or interesting axis-- jungle long ago stopped moving for anyone not already down with the program. Offshore releases, then, are excellent points of entry not only because they're more inventive than most 21st century drum'n'bass (techno-tinged percussion that splits the difference between groove and experimentalism) but because they're friendly (which in this case just as often means they're pretty rather than catchy). They're a fresh take on the genre that also remembers you once listened to jungle to hear otherworldly sounds as well as rhythms that rewrote your working definition of ""funk"" with each new 12-inch. The first official Offshore CD release since 2004's Troubled Waters mix CD, the 10 rarities and exclusives collected on Buried Treasure are an obvious way ""in."" Still, there are a few things you need to enjoy before bothering to venture into the modern-day jungle. A love of rapid-fire, jittery syncopations is key to enjoying a track like Graphic's ""Stop Motion"" which, true to its name, is speedier than any techno track you're currently enjoying and stops and starts like a city bus. Looped grooves and the layered interplay between different loops should sound appealing, too; ""Stop Motion"" is all about the dizzying ways Graphic trades off between a handful crunchy, choppy drum breaks, weaving in a smear of grumbling bass, the ping of an elevator reaching its floor, and a wobbly organ motif. But mostly you've got to love drums. Whether it's the way Graphic and Slide push the frantic kicks and snares of ""Crash Kit"" through various EQ settings until they clonk like metal or clink like glass or how Fanu drives his very naturalistic-sounding blaxsploitation beats into a Cerberus-snarling hell ride on ""Defunct Drums' Depression Decade VIP,"" if tightened and twisted drum breaks for their own sake don't immediately get your nose open, Buried Treasure might take a couple spins to immerse yourself in. But one track that will spin everyone's head around on the first play is Sileni's VIP remix of his own ""Twitchy Droid Leg"", easily the most rhythmically complex four minutes you'll hear in 2007. (""Finally,"" a friend said after hearing it for the first time, ""your love of math-rock and your love of drum'n'bass are joined."") The original was the highlight of Troubled Waters, a two-stepping, timbrally-fucked robot rocker that ka-thunked and whirred like southern hip-hop gone horribly wrong. Here, as lunar, bell-like synth tones (shades of early Aphex Twin) slur a melody in the background, Sileni seems to craft funky beats more like he's Matmos recording liposuction and other distressing bodily noises. Even though close-listeners can follow a syncopated pattern throughout ""Twitchy Droid Leg VIP"", it hits you as a riot of squishy squelches and groaning gurgles and Jabba the Hutt slurps. As the track progresses, spasming jazz drums try to kick their way out of the mucous-encrusted sonorities of Sileni's ""motherfucking robotic bounce tweaker beats."" For a genre that's so often stiff to the point of rigor mortis, Chris Leamy makes organic drum'n'bass that's more ""internal organs"" than stand-up bass and totally original. Why isn't this guy, like, hugely famous already? Somebody get The Wire magazine on the phone--or Wired, for that matter.","Latest comp from Offshore, which continues to be among both the most inventive purveyors of 21st century drum'n'bass-- techno-tinged percussion that splits the difference between groove and experimentalism-- and one of the best entry points into the genre for newcomers.

The devil tells him that he has three choices as to where he'll spend his eternal damnation. The devil opens a door, behind which people writhe in perpetual flames. ""No way,"" says the guy. The devil opens another door, behind which people convulse on an electrified floor. ""Uh-uh,"" says the guy. The devil opens a third door. Behind it, people are buried to their necks in excrement, each sipping a cup of tea with one free hand. ""Well, beats the other two,"" says the guy. ""I'll take it."" He eases into the filth, and just as he takes his first sip of tea, a voice comes over Hell's intercom: ""Okay everybody, tea break's over-- back on your heads!"" The joke, like most, masks multiple profundities-- that we all create our own Hells, that none of our vaunted free will or personal agency will keep us from our final reward, and that poo is funny. But while most of us choose one Hell, Oxbow's Eugene Robinson is in the unique position of residing simultaneously in all three. A slab of lurid and tattooed muscle, often near-nude, Robinson strikes a fearsome presence at Oxbow shows, seeming to writhe as if burned and shudder as if electrocuted at once.

And given his gibbering delivery and nihilistic lyrics, which always seem unhealthily scatological even when they don't deal specifically with shit, he would probably be quite comfy in the third room of Hell, especially were the tea replaced with something more potent: embalming fluid, perhaps, or bleach. Oxbow have been a metal band, one steadily moving into more credibly frightening territory. At this point, one can scarcely identify them with traditional metal's canned, often hokey menace, as The Narcotic Story fully embraces a sort of slow-burning, infernal blues. It's a malign transmission, sparser than Oxbow's more metallic styles, and, paradoxically, much heavier. After establishing its extreme poles with a brief intro of piercing ambient tones and heavy-bowelled bleats, The Narcotic Story sustains a deft balance between creeping dirges and panicky rock for its duration. Its evocative disorder is remindful of U.S. Maple, and Robinson's blood-curdling polecat yowl recalls David Yow and the Frogs in equal measure. ""Geometry of Business"" is a raw-boned, blowsy blues with fuzz bass bombs and creeping pianos-- the lyrics, as elsewhere on the album, are mostly, mercifully, unintelligible. Through repeated false starts, the noodly quiet of ""Time Gentlemen Time"" arduously erupts into a sturdy rock slog, shrill tones rising up from the wrecked chords and howled imprecations. By the time the crusty blues-metal swagger of ""Down a Stair Backward"" bleeds into the orchestral butt-jazz of ""She's a Find"", it's clear that Oxbow's usual laddering plod is doubled in effect by the more elegant, tension-building passages that they've stitched, Frankenstein's-monster-style, into it. Every piano-laced tea break is cut short by a sulfurous blare, and then it's back onto our heads, back into Robinson's world of shit.","Eugene Robinson returns with a record that's sparser than his band's more metallic styles, and, paradoxically, much heavier.

Ma Fleur,The Cinematic Orchestra,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b100ea9e61561daa66ed/1:1/w_160/158f5d0e.jpg,2007-06-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10334-ma-fleur/,Ninja TuneDomino,"History has been kind to J. Swinscoe. Despite a five-year drought, his downtempo jazz outfit Cinematic Orchestra has maintained a level of after-the-fact credibility that perceived contemporaries like Nightmares on Wax, Lamb, and Skalpel would probably kill for in 2007. It's true that with the benefit of hindsight, a lot of the stuff from that early noughties post trip-hop milieu doesn't sound nearly as moony or as luxuriant as it once did. For better or worse, that general blueprint (loping rhythms, swooshy atmospherics, stirring strings, trembling female vocals) never managed to transcend the stereotype of being nothing more than a sonic duvet for the gentrifying frontlines; no wonder that as scenes went, it evaporated faster than you could spell ""Café Del Mar"". But thanks mostly to 2002's superb Every Day, Cinematic Orchestra escaped that era pretty much intact. Where most of their contemporaries scored easy points by merging Hallmark-style sentimentality with wiffly atmospherics, Cinematic always seemed to aim higher, recruiting gnarled instrumental veterans, drawing deep from jazz, and making records that felt more like expansive, carefully constructed suites than collections of songs. All of which is reason enough to be a little bit offput by Swinscoe's new direction. His first full-length since Every Day, Ma Fleur abandons the light touch of his prior efforts in favor of an almost aggressively pretty approach. Where Swinscoe's early records were coy slow-burners that captivated over time, Ma Fleur leaves no room for subtlety. From the lonely, pregnant piano chords that open the record to the spiraling strings that close it, this is instructively momentous music, a conveyor belt of carefully delineated deep sighs, thoughtful sounds and big moments. If it all sounds a little too rich, well, it can be. The good news is that some of the songs do merit their lavish surroundings. With a monochromatic piano line and guest vocals from an androgynous-sounding Patrick Watson, opener ""To Build a Home"" is a candlelit ballad that bears more than a passing resemblance to Antony's work. Despite its beauty (or maybe because of it), it also establishes a stultifying air that the album never really shakes itself free of. Sometimes, as with the gently fingerpicked ""Music Box"", the shimmering and stately ""As the Stars Fall Into You"" and the quietly explosive ""Breathe"", it's a look that serves Swinscoe well. But by the time he breaks the pindrop silence with a creeping string coda for what feels like the ninetieth instance in 35 minutes, you might find yourself wishing this particular ride had more than two gears, or at least that one of those two gears wasn't 'park'. Sadly, there's nothing here that approaches Every Day's most spine-tingling moment-- the Roots Manuva-aided ""All Things to All Men"". If Ma Fleur is any indication, Swinscoe isn't particularly interested in evincing those kinds of thrills anymore, and that's a shame, because records that try to do what he's doing here are a hell of a lot easier to come by. Slow, sugary, and perhaps a little too safe, this is not quite the return that Cinematic fans will want it to be.","J. Swinscoe's downtempo outfit-- which escaped the trappings of its peers by feeling more like expansive, carefully constructed suites than collections of songs-- returns after a five-year drought.

Attack Decay Sustain Release,Simian Mobile Disco,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10cb1335d7bf169a1f8/1:1/w_160/0e1295c7.jpg,2007-06-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10345-attack-decay-sustain-release/,InterscopeWichita,"Can we call a moratorium on using the phrase ""rock artists getting into electronic music"" as a pejorative, unless you're going to chuck out, I dunno, Sweet Exorcist or that guy who used to be in the Housemartins or dozens of other beloved post-rave producers? Simian Mobile Disco were as deep in rock as a pair of quarrymen, even if you'd never know it to listen to this record. James Ford and James Shaw got their start in workman-like indie four-piece Simian, lost to the discount bins had SMD not branched sideways into success in the populist end of dance. That success first came with Justice's remix of Simian's ""Never Be Alone"" (titled ""We Are Your Friends""), released on Ed Banger-- a label which, for many people, might as well be a rock imprint. And as a production team, SMD did the rock remix thing and helmed the debut album from neon enthusiasts and indie rock serial daters the Klaxons. But Myths of the Near Future was, even accounting for taste, a tinny din. It was the sound of its producers trying to futilely collate the rapid-fire ideas of a young band without the taste or craft to execute them without it sounding like a drunken bar fight. And Justice wields dance music as if fending off zombie attackers at the DJ booth. Meanwhile, SMD's excellent debut album as a stand-alone group, Attack Decay Sustain Release, is for dancing, not moshing-- especially if that's dancing in front of your bedroom mirror to the radio, like Tony Manero, primping before hitting the town. What makes SMD a better pop band than Justice or the Klaxons is their commitment to clean danceable beats (the electro arpeggios of ""Sleep Deprivation"" clang as loudly and brightly as a Max Martin production) and lighthearted and immediate hooks (""Hot Dog"" turns robotized double-dutch taunts, motor-revving bass, and stampeding drums into the rollerskate chant the last Rapture album couldn't quite reach). But what really sells Attack Decay Sustain Release is Simian Mobile Disco's unerring devotion to always-hooky pastiche in the name of a good time, and to pop's unbreakable formalism when it comes to things like track length and the need for a kick-ass chorus. Justice and the Klaxons are pastiche artists, too, but SMD's vision is friendlier, scornful of ""weren't the '80s wacky"" irony, with their ears wide open to such less-than-punk sounds as Bobby O's hi-NRG, Information Society's pure energy, Sweet Sensation's freefalling freestyle, and every lite-brite shade of pop-house and techno in the spectrum. ""It's the Beat"" falls over itself combining all of the above plus a New Order morse code bleep, a numerical-minded Kraftwerk squelch-melody, a Technotronic fanfare riff, and a rap from a Go! Teamer who wants to be Roxanne Shante. And forget rock, except for maybe the martial tempos, because there's nothing aggressive (read: ""overly masculine"") about SMD's mix, and nothing purposefully ugly, either. ""I Believe"" and ""Love"" both shamelessly borrow the classic big-fey-voice-over-booming-synth dynamics of Depeche Mode at their most pop and Erasure at their most soulful. For SMD, electronic music begins and ends with the radio, from Soft Cell to Crystal Waters, and so its over-the-top friendliness, immediacy, and excitement has a cramped, amped-up hysteria, like all great bubblegum. (It's also short like a bubblegum album-- 10 tracks in under 40 minutes, most songs being perfect A-side lengths for seven-inch singles.) And even as prototypical indie kid pop-cultural curators-- who else is so into old bubblegum sounds?-- SMD's knock-out craft just might win them a wide American audience. After all, another indie pop duo (who used to record for Stereolab's label!) went on to become one of the top-shelf post-rave pastiche pop acts and to sell out arena crowds. And if SMD aren't quite Daft Punk, Attack Decay Sustain Release is a good sign that their Discovery might be right around the corner.","Following Klaxons and Justice, the third of this year's big indie-dance crossovers issues its debut album. SMD's debut maintains an unerring devotion to always-hooky pastiche in the name of a good time and to pop's unbreakable and road-tested formalism when it comes to things like song length and the need for a kick-ass chorus.

Commuter Anthems,Opsvik & Jennings,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f9ea9e61561daa66de/1:1/w_160/1a88c1b0.jpg,2007-06-20 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10328-commuter-anthems/,Rune Grammofon,"As with so many acts on the Rune Grammofon roster, the duo of Eivind Opsvik and Aaron Jennings construct their work directly on the faultlines that separate each musical genre from the next. Their instrumental tides incorporate stray elements of folk, jazz, and country with an impressively gentle touch, as the two musicians invisibly blend acoustic instruments with subtle software effects. With the aid of such evocative titles as ""The Last Country Village"" and ""Lorinda Sea"", the liminal music on Commuter Anthems has melancholic, faintly nostalgic tug, as though absorbed in the quiet conflict between the present and the idealized thoughts of a mythic, pastoral history. Opsvik & Jennings-- New Yorkers by way, respectively, of Oslo and Oklahoma-- might sound like a name better suited to a law firm or a chiropractic clinic, and at points on Commuter Anthems they can perhaps seem rather too business-like in their approach. The two musicians have each been active in a variety of projects, largely grounded in jazz and experimental pop. On Commuter Anthems, their second album overall and their first on Rune Grammofon, the duo make a host of unlikely instrumental choices, joining melodic fragments of banjo and lap steel to jazz string bass and tranquil laptop figures. To their credit, Opsvik & Jennings take care throughout to de-emphasize their composing and recording process, and they partner their individual styles so seamlessly that the album can often seem as a dream-wave transmitted directly from a single conjoined imagination. True to its title, Commuter Anthems is filled with exactly the sort of distant, half-remembered melodic fragments that one might envision while nodding off on the evening train. ""The Last Country Village"" builds up from a base of acoustic guitar and tuned percussion to warm swells of lap steel, patiently chasing a sleepy melody that remains just tantalizingly out of reach. Wordless bah-dah-dah vocals decorate ""Port Authority"" and the title track, further lending to their ethereal daydream character. On such jazzier tracks as the lengthy ""I'll Scrounge Along"", the duo can call to mind the languid rumble of early Tortoise, while Jennings' contributions on guitar and a variety of string instruments echo some of Bill Frisell's cross-genre explorations. As the album progresses, Opsvik & Jennings allow themselves extra enough driving time for a couple fruitful side trips. On the hypnotic ""Ways"" the duo take a break from forward momentum altogether, settling into one of the album's richest melodies with banjo and theremin for an idyllic respite amidst the tempered commotion. Here, as on the lyric ""Lorinda Sea"", the additions of banjo, pedal steel, and/or trumpet cast a wistful, rural glow that sways and hovers like pollen on a lingering summer breeze, only to soon be scattered by a shuffled rhythm or electronic edit. Throughout the length of Commuter Anthems, one can hardly help but wish that Opsvik & Jennings had chosen to push these songs a little further, and take their melodies grander, or allowed their stylistic leaps to retain more of their natural dissonance. Lovely though the album is, the duo appear content to treat their Anthems with an air of light detachment, almost as if too much extra attention or creative interference might cause these fragile creations to vanish off into the twilight as suddenly as they've arrived.","Rune Grammofon duo Eivind Opsvik and Aaron Jenning construct their work directly on the faultlines that separate each musical genre-- here, including folk, jazz, and country-- from the next.

Omns,Lichens,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10513d197565213a56f/1:1/w_160/5be2b0fc.jpg,2007-06-20 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10339-omns/,Kranky,"Rob Lowe of 90 Day Men has an interesting thing going with his Lichens project. He's working at the familiar intersection of abstract folk and drone, but he uses delays and samples to create heavily layered tracks in real time. So while he has on the one hand the Zen-like focus on tone of an Oren Ambarchi, wherein he's perfectly willing to let a plucked E-string decay without another sound for five or six seconds, he's also got his unusual approach to voice to fall back on, where his high-pitched whine can be folded in on itself, sucking up all the space as it's stretched out to the horizon. His pieces, which tend to be long, can be a bit like spinning plates, as he sets various sounds in motion and keeps them going while figuring out where the music is going next. The DVD included with Omns, his second album for Kranky, shows how Lowe makes it happen in concert. Footage recorded live at Chicago's Empty Bottle is intercut with scenes shot in a forest; appropriate enough considering that Lichens sometimes sounds like a field recording of some Earth-worshiping pagan cult ritual, or perhaps a séance. It seems wrong to listen without a cone of incense smoldering away somewhere nearby, and it's not hard to understand why some might be put off by the overt mysticism. At one point during the film, the camera zooms in and catches Lowe closing his eyes in concentration as he wails toward the sky, bringing to mind for a moment the image of a young urban professional on a weekend Iron John retreat. But it's easy to forget about that stuff when just listening to Omns, which is richer than the 2005 Lichens album The Psychic Nature of Being. Lowe does a nice job of varying his palette, mixing up the tone and timbre of the tracks to stay down in a certain groove while avoiding monotony. Both ""Vevor Of Agassou"" and ""Faeries"", for example, are built primarily around vocal drones. The former has Lowe massing his tones together to sound like insects trying to find each other in a pitch-black cave; the latter begins with a more a more ethereal/4AD approach and then brings in bits of piano for an acoustic contrast. But while these two are of a piece, ""Bune"" comes from somewhere else-- namely, the rock tradition-- as Lowe knuckles down for a slow burn, distorted, and heavily psychedelic guitar solo. The 18-minute track with the Wheel of Fortune title ""M St R Ng W Tchcr Ft L V Ng N Sp R T"" is the record's obvious centerpiece, and seems to fold in bits of everything going on elsewhere. Beginning with some acoustic fingerpicking, it drifts into a synth drone, at then goes into an extended section of bird song. Eventually Lowe begins to sing along with the ornithological crew, adding his plaintive and vaguely liturgical wail to the chirps. If you're instantly turned off by anything smacking of new age this is obviously not for you, but Lowe conjures a rather uncertain mood with the track, generally favoring a slowly building tension despite the presence of the birds. Closing out the album is the two-minute electric guitar instrumental ""Sighns"", the aural equivalent of sunlight refracted through a bead of water, which turns out to be the right sort of coda after the record's subtle heaviness.","Rob Lowe of 90 Day Men here works at the familiar intersection of abstract folk and drone, but uses delays and samples to create heavily layered tracks in real time.

Given to the Rising,Neurosis,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e95e6ef9596932204c/1:1/w_160/4d0e6914.jpg,2007-06-20 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10316-given-to-the-rising/,Neurot,"In the hallowed halls of metaldom, the name Neurosis carries some pretty (no pun intended) heavy overtones: they're a staunchly DIY cult band with the most devoted following and a long track record of highly innovative thinking-man's metal. But anyone even vaguely familiar with their oeuvre would wisely not call them a doom band; they're way too varied for such a tag. On these San Franciscan metallurgists' ninth album, Given To the Rising, Neurosis are simply not fucking around. Within the first note you know you're in for a ride: no staple slow-building intros or atmospheric effluvia, just a crushing primordial mid-tempo riff that eventually falls into one of the album's repeating motifs of bendy, long-hanging funereal guitar lines, all braced with plenty of back-to-basics pummeling. The sense of purpose is developed further on ""Fear And Sickness"", where disjointed yet dissonantly harmonious axe lines dodge and dart in paganistic call-and-response around a swing-like snare and kick drum beat. These two dimly lit apocalypse-summoning tracks shine light on why Given very well may be the best Neurosis album in over a decade-- or at least since 1999's signature Times of Grace. First a re-cap: It's difficult making a new album when you're a band like Neurosis. Much like the elders on which they were weaned (Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Black Flag, Swans), aspects of their sound have spawned entire micro-genres. Whether it be their kinetic mega-evil tribal drum-and-guitar interplay or their dense layering of creepy samples and textural atmospherics or their melodic instrumental passages that birthed the ""metalgaze"" school-- see Isis and bands such as Cult of Luna and Mouth of the Architect for starters-- it's hard to stay fresh when everyone's copping your every move. Which is why Given feels so smart and so standing-on-the-throats-of-our-imitators-and-not-giving-a-fuck confident. All the past doomsday bells-and-whistles are still prevalent, all the progressive guitar mayhem and Steve Von Till's classic Tom Waits-meets-Michael Gira vocals. But unlike their last couple albums-- most notably 2004's introspective and mostly-delicate and majestic The Eye of Every Storm-- the noodley bits are tethered as if in direct response to all the quiet-loud-brood-quiet-loud brooding copycats. And songs like the two previously mentioned openers, as well as the Jesu-like ""Hidden Faces"" and the Mastodon-like chug-fest ""Water is Not Enough"", seem to be cribbing notes from the cribbers (as well as the non-copying competition) and then in turn streamlining the turns the cribbers previously cribbed. Such as the way that soundsculptor/keyboardist Noah Landis masterfully blends the dark ambient textures, not just for spooky intros and outros, but for dynamic passages of their own. Or the way that the songs-- most averaging around seven and a half minutes-- keep morphing from thunderous cacophony to desolate soul-searching melodic phrases, but with a mad scientist exactitude regarding all of the subtle, beautiful, and terrifying spaces in between. Even dynamically adroit acts like Pelican and, once again, Isis have yet to explore these depths of shifting-- and, most importantly, gradual-- peaks and valleys. Neurosis have once again conjured those ominous trance-inducing dark spaces, but they've placed them in canyons even more broad and deep.","Ninth album from tremendously influential Bay Area metal band moves away from the more atmospheric direction of recent records; the more direct and hard-hitting approach yields what may be their best album in a decade.

Champion Sound: Deluxe Edition,Jaylib,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ff13d197565213a565/1:1/w_160/0a1a1539.jpg,2007-06-20 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10333-champion-sound-deluxe-edition/,Stones ThrowStones Throw,"It shouldn't have worked. And maybe, in 2003, it didn't: When a series of through-the-mail beat trades between Madlib and Jay Dee eventually coalesced into a full-length collaboration, the final result felt a little gimmicky at first. A pair of producer/MCs taking turns rhyming over each others' beats is unconventional enough, but when both of them had such disparate approaches at the time-- ever try listening to Jay Dee's smooth, uncluttered banger Welcome to Detroit and Quasimoto's blunted, dubbed-out The Unseen back to back, much less shuffled together?-- it was hard not to feel initially disoriented. Many critics (this one included) originally saw it as an enjoyable if disjointed effort, then eventually forgot about it once Madvillainy dropped a few months later. Stones Throw's reissue of Champion Sound, then, seems to work largely as a ""hey, remember this?"" nudge, coming off the heels of the recent deluxe edition of Dilla's Ruff Draft EP in a similar bid to reestablish the value of an underheard record. Unlike Ruff Draft, Champion Sound was a widely-released, full-fledged album-- more slept-on than scarce-- and it's aged a bit better than early reviews might've anticipated. More than a few underground rap albums these days have shot for Champion Sound's stoned-in-the-club vibe and fallen short, while Stones Throw has become indie rap's ""it"" label in recent years with albums much like this: collaborative efforts infused with Madlib's unpretentiously avant-garde spirit, weird enough to stay on the margins of current pop culture but accessible enough to stick on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] (where it seems a bit less bizarre next to willfully batshit stuff like ""Saul of the Mole Men""). The main thing to keep in mind about Champion Sound is that the two main artists involved adapted to each other's production styles just as much as they contrasted. It's easy to theoretically pit Madlib's muddy, crackly, blown-out organics as a barely-compatible counter to Dilla's pristine digital precision, but there's a stylistic bleedthrough that seeps both ways. Madlib's beats here lack much of the skewed jazz eccentricity that his more familiar Quasimoto and Madvillain productions do. Instead, he fine-tunes his approach so that his more far-out tendencies-- reassembled bop flotsam and beats that have a hard time staying put-- are left to sneak in through the margins. There's odd little touches like the title track's Bollywood vocal (which, post-""Addicted"", didn't skew too far away from the mainstream anyways), the piercing, slightly warped-sounding sustained string note that runs through most of ""The Mission"" and the Asian/Middle-Eastern horn that trills through ""Survival Test"". But like the best Dilla tracks, the bass and drums are at the forefront and do most of the heavy lifting, and a couple of Madlib's beats, like the booming fist-pump rhythm of ""McNasty Filth"" and the insistent stutter-thump of ""Strapped"", feel like low-fi versions of Jay Dee's Slum Village work. Dilla's tracks don't rewrite his own plan as much-- which makes sense, since many of them preceded the idea of the collaboration in the first place-- but they're a bit filthier than usual, his glowing digital bass pushed until it strains; not for nothing is his best beat on here, a heavy slab of big-bottomed g-funk built around a disembodied soul wail and a airlock-tight drum loop, repurposed for a track called ""The Red"". And there's a few points that pick up the slack for the prog-fusion bizarreness Madlib pushed to the background: the melody for ""React"" is based around what might be a guitar riff or a clarinet sped up to a hummingbird tempo, ""Raw Shit"" hammers away at a tinny Farfisa that sounds like it's on its last legs, and ""Strip Club"" features a giggly steel drum that's about as sexy as a coconut bra. Even if they're not much worth commenting on lyrically-- ""Shoulda never been allowed in the game/ All y'all fake gangstas now"" and ""My thug niggas know what I mean/ A live bitch, that's what I need"" are typical Jay Dee lines, while Madlib's appeal is mostly in his muttering, halting delivery-- the vocals also fit their productions in a complementary way. Jay Dee's elementary rhymes seem as loosely-assembled and grimy as Madlib's beats, while Madlib returns the favor by vocally skulking across Dilla's precision engineering with his conversational counter-rhythms. A few guests keep things switched up: Kweli's turn on ""Raw Shit"" has more value in his endearingly ridiculous half-sung hooks than his unremarkable verses, Frank-n-Dank give ""McNasty Filth"" the confident swagger the tear-the-club-up beat requires, and Percee P throws out so many acrobatic battle-rap turns of phrase on ""The Exclusive"" (""Perce is nice, worth the price, every verse entice/ one of the most praised men to surface twice on this earth since Christ"") that it's easy to forget he's only rapping for about 40 seconds. Along with the requisite bonus disk of instrumentals and a couple hard-to-find bonus tracks (including the hilarious Madlib-helmed ""Pillz""-- ""Oh shit, I just took an X pill/ now I'm ready to thwoop""), the supplemental material includes a handful of remixes that don't quite fit in with Champion Sound's original vibe. The beatbox-driven remix of ""The Official"" and the rework of ""Champion Sound"" that sounds like ""Whole Lotta Love"" on a busted harpsichord have their place on the second disc, far out of reach of their superior originals, but might not be enough to justify a purchase for fans who already got the CD first time around. Given its single-disc price, the Deluxe Edition of Champion Sound, like most reissues, has the most value for those who haven't gotten around to hearing the CD until now-- and they're coming to it at just the right time.","Stones Throw reissue and expand this 2003 through-the-mail collaboration between Madlib and the late Jay Dee.

It's a Bit Complicated,Art Brut,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1029d034d5c69bf496b/1:1/w_160/2855b662.jpg,2007-06-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10336-its-a-bit-complicated/,Downtown,"If ever there was a group sensitive to the dreaded sophomore slump, it'd be Art Brut. For a group who made their entrance with the autobiographical origin story ""Formed a Band"", the pledge that ""it's not irony, it's not rock'n'roll,"" and a humble and brash sound meant more to buttress singer Eddie Argos' wry observations than draw attention, landmines for a ""mature"" follow-up are everywhere. Change the lyrical approach to sober up the honest and clever self-indulgence, and you forfeit the angle that makes Art Brut unique and lovable. Pretty up the music too much, and you distract from and compromise Argos' regular-dude frontman bit. Merely remake Bang Bang Rock N' Roll, and risk the accusation that the band's concept was only good for one 30-minute shot, sentencing the group to the cult-band one-and-done footnotes. No wonder the second album is called It's a Bit Complicated. Perhaps aware of this foreboding obstacle course, Art Brut have wisely managed to somehow make all of these mistakes and none of them, incrementally expanding their sonic palette while Argos evinces a slightly more grown-up perspective, yet never straying too far from the band's original M.O. Sure, there's a more muscular lead-guitar on most tracks here, they've discovered the joys of audible backing vocals, and a horn section even turns up on ""Late Sunday Evening"", but there aren't any ill-advised dalliances with laptop beats or orchestration or even, god forbid, ballads. Meanwhile, Argos' muse has perceptibly changed from ""gee-golly, I'm in a band!"" and bedroom performance anxiety to domestic living and the simple joy of music-listening without blunting his wit or giving in to the temptation to talk about fame and touring. The subtle shift is apparent from the very start, as ""Pump Up the Volume"" hangs on a lead riff and an almost-solo more upfront than anything on Bang Bang, albeit far too slowly played to register as overly flashy. Meanwhile, the vocal is classic Argos, amplifying the dilemma of mid-makeout radio adjustment to epic proportions, interrupting a kiss to tentatively ask ""have you heard this song before?"" Sexxing is, in fact, on Argos' mind throughout the record, from the courtship drama of ""Direct Hit"" to stay-in-bed-baby pleadings of ""Blame It on the Trains"". ""Jealous Guy"" is even the polar opposite of the last record's slightly uncomfortable impotence trilogy, finding the singer pleading with his sleepy girlfriend to stay up and frolic while torturing himself with paranoia about her exes. But more effective than these romantic ruminations are the tracks where Art Brut switches up their meta-aware music-about-music tendencies for the better, progressing from songs about making songs to songs about the irresistible urge to build a soundtrack to one's own life. In a way, ""Pump Up the Volume"" fits this category as well; if nothing else, it's about wanting to enhance an already, er, stimulating experience with the proper audio accompaniment. ""Sound of Summer"" is even more direct, fetishizing the process of creating the perfect mixtape in painstaking detail, right down to breaking the tabs ""so you can't tape over it ever."" The zenith of this subject is clearly reached on ""Nag Nag Nag Nag"", the band's between-albums single that amps up the central riff and sun-bleached backing vocals to make the song's dead-on coming-of-age headphones drama properly triumphant. The upgrades in production values aren't always an improvement, however, as it occasionally comes at the sacrifice of the band's scrupulous spontaneity. Argos' self-aware humor is still present-- pronouncing ""here comes the really good bit!"" in the breakdown of ""Direct Hit"" or apologizing for his Germ-glish (""punk rock is nicht tot"") in ""St. Pauli""-- but doesn't produce as many banner-waving one-liners. Moments like ""People in Love"" and ""Post Soothing Out"" are more demure than anything found on the group's debut, and embellishments like the horn breakdown of ""Late Sunday Evening"" are a poor substitute for the homegrown fist-pump peaks of older tracks like ""Emily Kane"" and ""Modern Art"". These missteps are testament to Art Brut's hidden element: the band itself. While Argos draws the spotlight of most reviews (this one included), the rest of the band quietly adds its own crucial element, which at its best is a simple, raucous sound perfect for underscoring melodramatic tales of sex and rock. As ""St. Pauli"" nervously reflects, Art Brut are at heart a throwback punk band-- albeit one with a frontman that is far more charming, thoughtful, and witty than your typical three-chord bashers-- and two albums down, they're already bumping up against the constraints of that genre. By only gently nudging the musical formula on It's a Bit Complicated, Art Brut have succeeded in crafting a satisfying half-mature sequel, but may have only delayed, rather than thwarted, the sophomore jinx.","On their sophomore effort, Art Brut have wisely managed to incrementally expand their sonic palette while singer Eddie Argos evinces a slightly more grown-up perspective-- and yet, the group never strays too far from its original M.O.

Future Clouds & Radar,Future Clouds & Radar,by: Stephen M.

He wrote from his bed for two years, then recorded and played with a revolving roster of Austin musicians. At 27 tracks covering a range of styles and sounds, Future Clouds & Radar is predictably ambitious, overlong, and aggressive in its eagerness to impress. Like almost all double albums, it provokes the phrase ""needs an editor."" But this exaggerated scope makes a certain kind of sense: in a large scene clogged with new bands and big statements, selling yourself as a pop genius through this sort of monument to indie hubris at least gets you noticed. And it just might work: already this debut has earned praise for its scope and has garnered comparisons to The White Album, among other doubles. Certainly the Beatles are Robert Harrison's primary frame of reference-- along with artists like George Harrison, John Lennon, and Wings-- but Future Clouds & Radar is not the sort of interesting mess that The White Album was. Of course, there is so much material here that it inevitably hits all the marks: from wholly unlistenable (""Doctor No"") and bafflingly bad (""Cowboy Weather"") to decent enough (""Let Me Get Your Coat"") and actually really good (""Build Havana""). But even at its best, there's no connective tissue between these songs, no overarching theme or consistency of quality to justify its immodest length. Harrison's everything-and-the-kitchen-sink production doesn't help, either. These songs are busy with sound, as if intended for a hyperactive child: in addition to the standard pop instruments, there are crickets, chimes, sitars, drones, static, ghostly background voices, errant beats, and floating samples of significant dialogue, as well as unidentifiable clicks, chirps, whirs, loops, bings, blips, pings, pongs, bells, and whistles. Such excess, however, does not denote originality or excitement in this case: despite Harrison's best efforts to cram these songs to bursting with so many Technicolor sounds, these two discs are relentlessly beige-- pop without any power, psychedelia rendered as easy listening. On songs like ""Malice of Stars"" and the cover of Bob Marley's ""Wake Up and Live"", the supersaturated production drowns the melodies in noise, distracting you from the songs' core. Elsewhere, it tugs the songs earthward, making them sound leaden and often annoyingly choppy. Worst of all, a certain smugness rules these proceedings-- the same kind that makes us scoff at baby-boomer blues rockers like Eric Clapton and makes hardcore Beatles fans largely unbearable. Future Clouds & Radar gives the sense that Robert Harrison and his band make music with the conviction that their influences-- their idols-- are critically unassailable and that perhaps they are similarly unassailable by association. But no artist is merely the sum of his or her influences. It's not who you listen to that matters, but what you do with what you've heard. Future Clouds & Radar do way too much, but not nearly enough.","Former Cotton Mather frontman, having recovered from a serious spinal injury, returns with a lengthy double album of Beatles-inspired guitar pop

Learning to Cope With Cowardice,Mark Stewart,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f4b1335d7bf169a1d3/1:1/w_160/149a5d26.jpg,2007-06-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10324-learning-to-cope-with-cowardice/,On U SoundOn U Sound,"When famed post-punks the Pop Group disbanded at the start of the 1980s, barely-legal frontman Mark Stewart joined forces with Adrian Sherwood, a white Briton dedicated to going where no dub reggae producer had gone before. The first album of this union, Learning to Cope With Cowardice, is still a proudly, profoundly disorienting act of oblique cold war criticism. Oh, and it's as funky as the early hip-hop Stewart was clearly digging as an import. ""The Wrong Name and the Wrong Number"", a bonus track included on this reissue, is listed as a ""DJ battle"" and sounds like it's cutting up Cheryl Lynn's ""Got to Be Real"" with the Funky 4+1's ""It's the Joint"". On the other hand, no Bronx block party was rocked by this much distortion, even through the crappiest speakers. And that's not to mention the samples of froggy doomsayer William S. Burroughs and a hysterical Stewart shouting ""This is a restricted area!"" when you least expect it. As Stewart groans like a boy in the corner of his own songs-- much like his future friend Tricky later would-- and the drums pop like they're being dropped into a pot of hot oil, the zombie female backing vocals and vaguely Ethiopian saxophones on tracks like ""Liberty City"" and ""The Paranoia of Power"" twist roots reggae's trappings of earth-mother security into a hall-of-mirrors horror. And in Sherwood's hands, reggae steppers rhythms and American funk grooves-- played by members of bands like African Headcharge and Creation Rebel, who orbited Sherwood's On U Sound label-- lurched drunkenly through the hazy vale of dub's purposeful obfuscation. Throughout Cowardice Sherwood EQ's Stewart's voice into a thousand shades of fucked up, raises and lowers the volume level on the mix with a near-sadistic inexplicableness, phases everything until it curls like palm fronds, or blasts it mercilessly with grating noise. But even obscured, the political ambitions of Stewart's lyrics are implicit in the album's title. ""Let's storm the citadels!"" he shrieks from nowhere on ""The Paranoia of Power"", except his mocking delivery (and the instability of Sherwood's mix) feels like a satire of such easily-stenciled politico slogans. On Cowardice, Stewart rejected both the easy-to-swallow, Day-Glo pop tranquilizers of the 80s and the bluntness that came to characterize the Pop Group's final records for wracked, ambiguous protest music. So who better to turn to for lyrics than a possible madman and authority-critiquing refusenik that was marginalized in his own time, only to later be viewed as a seer? On Cowardice's version of William Blake's own wracked, proto-""the-personal-is-political"" English portrait ""Jerusalem"", the poet's mania becomes manifest as Sherwood mixes the drums as if your ear is laying on the snare and places Stewart's voice as if he's on the other side of a warehouse shouting through a megaphone that keeps shorting out, a taped orchestral version of the hymn wobbling triumphantly behind him. ""Jerusalem"" has come to be seen by many as Stewart's defining moment, like hearing one English visionary stretched through another, and it is undoubtedly the most psychedelic (and weirdly beautiful) moment to come out of post-punk. Unfortunately, the bulk of Learning to Cope With Cowardice lacks the power ""Jerusalem"" comes by through its unearthly mix of the pastoral and the terrible. And as with the crumbling basslines and unspooling tape effects of the Pop Group's 1978 half-masterpiece Y, Cowardice's sonic instability can be infuriating if you hate it when a good groove gets poked full of holes. When it comes together, however, the disorientation feels right on time for reissue in an era of renewed nuclear hostilities, as protesters clash at the G8 summit and we continue to drug ourselves on reality TV shenanigans and celebrity weddings.","After the Pop Group disbanded, frontman Mark Stewart joined forces with dub producer Adrian Sherwood and their first collaboration, recent reissued, is still a profoundly disorienting act of oblique cultural cold war criticism.

"Si, Para Usted: The Funky Beats of Revolutionary Cuba, Volume One",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e8ea9e61561daa66c6/1:1/w_160/3b5da0ad.jpg,2007-06-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10315-si-para-usted-the-funky-beats-of-revolutionary-cuba-volume-one/,Waxing Deep,"Cuba was a late 20th Century anomaly: a repressive communist government that fostered a vibrant, influential, and essential musical output. Cuban sounds resonate and persist in music throughout Latin America, Africa (where some of the most popular styles have roots in the Cuban rhumba), Europe, and even, yes, the United States. Americans tend to think of Cuba as more isolated than it really is. You may not be able to fly there from our airports, but if you simply drive over the border to Toronto or Mexico City, no one will stop you. In the 1960s and 70s, Cuban music played just as big a role in the development of popular music styles in Central and West Africa as anything coming out of the U.S. or Europe. Still, Cuba's lone record label, Egrem, is the property of a government with no real conception of how to run a business (check their housing policies for proof), and that means recorded music is erratically available outside the island, when it's available at all. It's been up to labels like Nonesuch, Escondida, and Honest Jon's to go in search of it and make it available. Which is to say there's a lot we don't know about Cuban music and plenty of exploring to do. The guys at Waxing Deep, producers of a radio show and popular podcast, have taken note of the overwhelming response to the funky Cuban tracks they play in their sets and decided it was time to make some of this elusive music available to everyone, complete with well-researched liners and a wealth of background information. The music they've gathered comes mostly from the 70s, with a bit of bleed into the 80s, and based on what I hear, I couldn't be happier about the implications of that ""Volume 1"" at the end of the title. One important thing to note before we get to the details is that Castro's government, for all its innumerable flaws and broad terribleness, has generally been good to its musicians. They were granted artistic freedom so long as the music didn't get out of line politically, professional musicians were on the government payroll and so had no worries about making ends meet, and subsidies opened top-tier music academies to anyone who was good enough and had the desire, eradicating established class barriers. Not a perfect system, but one that allowed for amazing variety and prolific creation. If you're into Cuban music beyond Buena Vista, Arturo Sandoval and Celia Cruz, you'll likely recognize some of these names-- Jaun Formell y Los Van Van, Orquesta Riverside, Juan Pablo Torres, Irakere-- but you'll likely scratch your head at some others. This compilation digs deep to provide a nice mix of straight-ahead funk and psychedelic experimentation, with frequent hints of more traditional sound. They've also mostly chosen individual tracks that haven't made it outside of Cuba before. Juan Pablo Torres and his band Algo Nuevo (""Something New"") check in with three tracks, including disc opener ""Son a Propulsion"", which is well described in its title. It brings the traditional song form of the son, which predominated in the 30s, to bear on stabbing horns, wicked fuzz guitar, dubby effects and funk drums. It's just an appetizer for the track that follows it, though. Irakere's ""Bacalao con Pan"" is an astounding slab of grinding, psychedelic funk that tosses freak-out guitars with bright horns and even a bit of salsa piano for a mix that justifiably became a massive Cuban hit. There's an abundance of weird sounds on the compilation. Síntesis' ""Con la Luz de la Mañana"" is crazy, synth-heavy fusion with stacked vocals and a definite European prog influence. Los Van Van's ""Y No le Conviene"" is colored by a strangely arranged string section, and Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del ICAIC's ""Sondeando"" is government-sponsored free funk. The electric bass tone (chorus with light distortion) on Jorge Reyes' ""Pocito 11"" is unbelievably grotesque, and the bass is the lead instrument for much of the song-clearly some very left-field American and European fusion records were circulating in Cuba when this was made. Even an old institutional orchestra, Orquesta Riverside, which thrived on Cuban radio since well before revolution was even a glimmer in Castro's eye, gets in on the action with a super-funky big band track that features great call-and-response vocals. I'm used to the group as a purveyor of something much more traditional (their early 78s are treasures), but damn it's fun to hear them getting up expressly to get down here. The compilation ends with its biggest shock: the psychedelic, Eastern-tinged trip that is Mirtha Y Raul's ""Casina Y Epidecus"", which comes complete with an oud part and a spoken word passage that Timothy Leary would've died for. It's a surprising end to a necessary and vital compilation that exposes a world that never deserved to be hidden. These artists took promise of artistic freedom they were given to heart and created some wonderful and innovative syntheses. This is what every revolution should sound like.","Funky and psychedelic Cuban tracks from the 1970s and 80s, rarely if ever heard off the island, are lovingly assembled by the Waxing Deep label.

The Sun,Fridge,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1129d034d5c69bf4982/1:1/w_160/2a4e9812.jpg,2007-06-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10349-the-sun/,Temporary Residence,"About a decade removed from its mid-90s heyday, post-rock has largely succumbed to the same musical limitations it originally set out to obliterate. Torch-bearers Tortoise settled into a predictable, off-kilter groove with 2004's It's All Around You and riff-monsters like Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky sound less triumphant and more manipulative with every touchdown-worthy crescendo. In the current climate, a genuine post-rock stunner like Battles' Mirrored is considered more of a one-off shock than a revitalizing statement. So it's an odd time for cult post-rock heroes Kieran Hebden, Adem Ilhan, and Sam Jeffers to resurface as Fridge six years after their elegant high-water mark, Happiness. The return is especially strange considering the respectable indie success Hebden and Ilhan have achieved as Four Tet and Adem since 2001. Possibly by design, they won't have to worry about The Sun taking off and putting their solo careers on hold. Instead of combining to push their moody acoustic-electronic instrumentals into the future (or at least the present), Fridge come across as a nostalgia act on The Sun-- a hodge-podge of rough sketches dressed-up as a comeback. While their output ranges from wiry guitar excursions to hypnotic krautrock to Eno wallpaper, Fridge excel most at subtle, scuttling foreplay-- their best work sounds like the first minute of every Sigur Rós song aired-out and deconstructed. As such, Happiness stands as their most complete record, teeming with the meticulously precious production Hebden would later expand upon with 2003's Four Tet effort Rounds. Happiness is a benchmark of homed-in humility, revealing its gorgeousness in shimmers of warm acoustics and careful, cut-up percussion. By contrast, The Sun starts with a track more akin to Hebden's recent scattershot work with drummer Steve Reid than anything in Fridge's catalog. It's a jarring and showy Sun Ra-style introduction adorned with plenty of cymbals and feedback-- a ""look what we learned!"" moment that plays against the group's taut, minimalist strengths and a telling precursor of what's to come. Hebden's-- and, to a lesser extent, Ilhan's-- impressive solo material also works against them in this context because we know the heights they're capable of on their own; in that light, most of The Sun sounds like a batch of slap-dash demos for other projects. The pretty-enough ""Our Place in This"" and Broken Social Scene-esque ""Lost Time"" lull like in-progress Adem songs, while the rumbling ""Oram"" and the stumbling ""Insects"" could very well be sub par left-overs from Hebden's last Four Tet album, Everything Ecstatic. The lilting ""Comets"", with its simplistic piano chords, loping upright bass, and looping drum machine, has the trio using repetition and tunefulness to its advantage-- too bad it's the exception rather than the rule here. Free-spirited and Bonnaroo-friendly, The Sun is more of an alternate Fridge history (heavy on the rock-leaning jams of their early albums and EPs) than a progressive follow-up to Happiness. While the band has certainly grown musically, it also seems less patient and focused; much of the record feels like a hastily recorded jam session with a few superfluous electro-bobbles floating above the fray. More than anything, it's the sound of three long-time friends trying to stuff a couple new tricks into old memories and coming up with a discombobulated coda.","Six years after their elegant high-water mark, Happiness, Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) and Adem Ilhan (Adem) reunite with fellow Fridge man Sam Jeffers on a new record of moody acoustic-electronic instrumentals.

The Fragile Army,The Polyphonic Spree,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1035e6ef95969322071/1:1/w_160/6da93165.jpg,2007-06-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10337-the-fragile-army/,TVT,"Does size matter? Now three albums in, the Polyphonic Spree would appear to be the indie rock band uniquely positioned to answer that question. The Dallas symphonic-pop chorale weren't the first under-the-radar group to mimic the overflowing orchestration of sunshine-pop acts the Fifth Dimension and the Partridge Family; Danielson did this in the 90s. But the Spree's 2002 debut coincided with a period of new respect for over-sized lineups, from Broken Social Scene and the Arcade Fire to Architecture in Helsinki and I'm From Barcelona, with even Belle & Sebastian going Godspell for a minute there. Surely indie rock nerds couldn't just be overcompensating. In the battle of ""size of the boat"" vs. ""motion of the ocean,"" new Spree album The Fragile Army proves, perhaps appropriately...indecisive. Pre-release buzz centered as much on the band's shift from robes to black combat garb as on its new songs, but ain't nothing wrong with a good gimmick. The Fragile Army channels the group's positive collective energy into a more focused political solidarity, plus a few of Tim DeLaughter's best songs since his Tripping Daisy days. Still, the Spree's vision remains too vague, their revolutionary pop ambition too dependent on fuddy-duddy classical pomp, for The Fragile Army to rank as an unqualified success. Relatively speaking, the Spree have downsized. For The Fragile Army, DeLaughter and wife/co-leader Julie Doyle pared their joyous horde down to 24 members from 28 and built their songs around the rock-oriented core of the group's vaunted live performances. In fact, the trilling flutes, imperial horns, and bombastic strings-- even the fleet-fingered guitar fills-- of energetic first single ""Section 22 [Running Away]"" sound almost incidental to this ordinary power-pop love song. If the Spree's cover of Tripping Daisy's ""Sonic Bloom"" on last year's Wait EP showed how DeLaughter's themes have stayed consistent, it also illustrated that a choir and orchestra are often embellishments rather than essential elements of his songwriting. Ho-hum rocker ""Section 23 [Get Up and Go]"" reiterates the point. Not so the title track, which needs all the bigness the Spree can muster (and the ""Karma Police"" piano of David Bowie cohort Mike Garson) to bring its anti-Bush ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" onto Broadway: ""It's time for you to lose your excitement,"" the choir repeats, whatever that means. But DeLaughter's biggest breakthrough on The Fragile Army comes with ""Section 29 [Light to Follow]"", which establishes the record's overarching subject-- ""love in a mixed-up time""-- and explores new sounds for the group, from electronic beats to an Air-like bass groove, achieving spacey ambiance instead of anodyne catharsis. Rich with guitar harmonics, ""Section 31 [Overblow Your Nest]"" is another of DeLaughter's more emotionally sophisticated songs and also an existential assertion of self: ""I want this world to know that I'm alive,"" goes a surging, ELO-like chorus lyric. That individualistic mantra is at odds with Spree's egoless concept-- many voices joining as one to accomplish any goal, overturn any war-monger. ""Together we're all right,"" DeLaughter intones on uncharacteristically bittersweet ""Section 25 [Younger Yesterday]"", still sounding like Wayne Coyne. ""When we're both together, I know that we'll be just fine,"" the Spree chieftain adds on a lush slower song, ""Section 26 [We Crawl]"". Brief instrumental opener ""Section 21 [Together We're Heavy]"" echoes the title track to the group's 2004 album of the same name (minus the section number). In interviews, DeLaughter has been talking up utopia. ""It's a goal I think we all have deep down,"" he tells Paste. Pop's most famous utopian, John Lennon, picked up Sir Thomas More where Karl Marx left him: No possessions, and no religion, too. Echoing Lennon and Ono's refrain ""war is over (if you want it)"" on finale ""Section 32 [The Championship]"", DeLaughter sings, ""Someday the world will be one if we try."" Fine, but one what? The Spree frontman's vision shares the unitarian communalism of other ""perfect societies""; on the other hand, President Bush's post-9/11 stranglehold over national policy relied on unity, too. We don't want campaign platforms from our rock stars, but it'd be nice if their idealism extended beyond well-meaning peer pressure. For Plato, a ""just society"" doesn't even have music. For Todd Rundgren, Utopia were a three-keyboard 70s prog-rock band. As for the Spree, it's hard to believe any utopia would sound like symphonic-veneered rock music-- a style some classic-rock mainstays adopted back when their forward-looking peers were developing new genres. The Fragile Army is an all-out orchestral and choral assault for optimism in a turbulent era, but only infrequently are the Spree's songs as memorable as their numbers (and changing wardrobe).","Pre-release buzz for the Spree's third LP centered as much on the band's shift from robes to black combat garb as on their new songs, and here the group channel its positive collective energy into a more focused political solidarity.

"Please, Please, Please",Tobias Thomas,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f2c0084474cd0c1d2e/1:1/w_160/f36da12a.jpg,2007-06-18 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10323-please-please-please/,Kompakt,"Judging by how long it takes a Tobias Thomas mix to get up and running, you'd expect him to be more tortoise than man; it's a good 10 minutes and three scratchy ambient tracks before Thomas drops the beat on Please ,Please, Please, his third mix disc for Kompakt. Actually, it might be longer, since I'm not sure if ""vinyl crackle plus bass pulse"" really counts as a beat. Thomas' extended intros are nearly all atmosphere and ambient drift because he's serving notice on anyone who comes to his mixes looking for a little Saturday night fever. Thomas is keenly aware that a mix CD should operate on its own-- in this case more intimate-- terms. Please, Please, Please is an object made by one friend for another, rather than by a DJ looking to make 1,000 friends on the dancefloor. Thomas gets so intimate, in fact, that he almost climbs into your inner ear. The opening of PPP takes the deliquescing church bells of Pantha Du Prince's ""Butterfly Girl (Pantha Lost the Beat Version)"" and the freefalling piano chords of Adolf ""DJ Koze"" Noise's ""Was Ist Zuviel Zeit? (Dub)"" and slides them across the big black headspace a good pair of headphones can create. His taste in beats tends towards the timbral/melodic as well; it's five tracks and a good 20 minutes before the recognizably jacking house boom-tick of Johannes Heil's ""Aquarius"" finally pokes its head above the surface of Thomas' aqueous mix, rippling like a lake under moonlight. The first half of PPP sounds like it should only be played around 4 a.m. at just-audible volume. As PPP progresses, starting with the starved tribal house bongos and emaciated handclaps of Ricardo Villalobos' ""The Contempt (Trip Tollsmix)"" at the halfway mark, it picks up the pace with a string of beefy, if ultimately interchangeable, mid-tempo bangers, a slight capitulation to the fact that Thomas is supposed to be making a ""dance"" mix. This muscular middle peaks with the Detroit techno hi-hats and bouncy ball electro bassline of Reinhard Voigt's ""Suchtkultur"". And then, after an almost entirely instrumental hour, a charming (if cheesy) vocoder-hiccup cover of the Smiths' ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" by Brant featuring Mr. Roper sets up two leftfield diva tunes to close us out. The baby's rattle electro beats of International Pony's ""Gravity"" are strung between tingly cartoon harp runs and keyboard trills coated with major label gloss, as the Pony playfully pitches up the kittenish female singer until she's as screechy as that Dan Deacon album. Thomas and Geiger's own remix of Stella's cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" (follow all that?) mixes up live instruments (you can hear the frets squeaking), competent vocals (though hardly Nicks-ian), and a spacey New Order breakdown that then ditches the electric bass and jazzy drums for a spot-on early '90s techno pastiche. Like the rest of PPP, ultimately less of a state-of-the-nation dance mix than an idiosyncratic diversion, its inclusion is a sign that, though Thomas' mixing skills mean the disc flows smoothly, his ear for selection remains tuned to a very private channel.","On his third mix for Kompakt, Thomas again takes his time getting to the point, offering atmosphere and ambient drift on an intimate, home-listening mix that features tracks from Pantha Du Prince and Ricardo Villalobos, as well as an Ada remix of a Smiths cover and a Thomas/Geiger mix of a Fleetwood Mac cover.

Kraut Slut,Antiguo Autómata Mexicano,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e1c0084474cd0c1d16/1:1/w_160/c56b71c1.jpg,2007-06-18 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10307-kraut-slut/,Static Discos,"Late last year Ángel Sánchez Borges released a mini-album of ethereal drone-pop under the name Seekers Who Are Lovers. Seekers could be considered a side project for Borges if he didn't have so many things going on at once; he's also an experimental video artist of some renown, and now returns as Antiguo Autómata Mexicano, the name he uses for instrumental journeys into beat-driven minimalism. In 2005 he released his debut AAM record Microhate on the German label Backgroung; follow-up Kraut Slut is his first release for the Tijuana-based label Static Discos. Given the titles of the album and the first track here, ""Rother, Dinger, You, and Me"", you might guess you're in for a concept record. And ""Rother"" certainly delivers on that score, channeling the spirit and the sound of classic Neu! with almost frightening accuracy, but doing so in an even more compact and completely digital package. It's basically a cover tune, but covering a sound as opposed to a song; Borges programs a simple series of pulses to mimic the interplay between Dinger's stark and insistent drum pulse frames Rother's buzzing, carefully picked guitar. Both the idea and the execution are fantastic. But Kraut Slut doesn't stay long on the motorik road. ""Mitte"" sticks with sharp, crackly beats but drapes over them a soft curtain of static and lush chords suggesting a much more amorphous and dreamy headspace. It has the pulse of techno, but in terms of mood ""Mitte"" is closer to the shadowy and sensual world of his Seekers work. Same goes for ""Extirpe"" which is mostly slow-drift synthetic drone, with just a few percussive beeps and rips lurking in the shadows, while ""Harm and Jazz"" kicks up so much digital dust it the foreground, a constantly shifting collage of machine noise and buzzes, you can barely make out the steady bass and drums moving somewhere behind. ""Malandro de Culto"" and ""Ill Stijl"" are Borges' excursion into more dancefloor-oriented techno, and the latter especially, with its precise but busy array of bleeps, is a particularly focused beam of forward-moving energy. So then, album title and opening track aside, what exactly binds these disparate elements into a single project? Borges seems most drawn to micro-leaning computer music as a way to conjure atmosphere; there's a lot of suggestion in Borges' music, hints at various possibilities, and you never get the sense that the technology-- always at the forefront considering the persistent use of glitches and noise-- is the music's subject. On its own, Kraut Slut is an evocative sampling of the potential of computer-based minimalism with a handful of fantastic tracks; considered along with Borges' other recent work, the record makes him seem an even more compelling artist worth following closely.","Seekers Who Are Lovers' Ángel Sánchez Borges returns under the name he uses for instrumental journeys into beat-driven minimalism on this, his first release for the Tijuana-based label Static Discos.

Superfly, The Mack, and Dolomite served helped cement concepts of black masculinity and gave rise to the pimp/pusher caricature still glorified by many modern day rappers. You get mad at Snoop for claiming that he's ""never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap""? Spread a little of that moral hysteria to the O.G.s like Rudy Ray Moore (of course, you might also want to save a little spite for the government goons who oversaw the assassination, imprisonment, and marginalization of black leaders following the riotous 60s). And while it's no surprise that another rap group is adopting the flared-out, pimpadelic funk template of these films, it does come as a bit of a shock that this time Portland's Lifesavas are the culprits. After all, Lifesavas are the oh-so-conscious, Blackalicious-cosigned group of rap bohos who spent their 2003 debut, Spirit in Stone, ruminating on political apocalypse, spiritual desolation, and postmodern identity politics. But here the Portland trio jumps into the conceit feet first. They've adopted the personas of Bumpy Johnson (Vursatyl), Sleepy Floyd (Jumbo) and Jimmy Slimwater (DJ Rev Shines), and they traverse the mean streets of Razorblade City, ostensibly a stand-in for Portland but really more of an allegorical dump for all modern day social ills. If you can get past the geeky premise-- and, admittedly, it's a big hurdle-- the album is wonderful. From the outset, producer Jumbo absolutely nails the sound of blaxploitation films. His work lurches off the disk, strutting out the shuffling noir of ""A Serpents Love"" and the bouncy funk of ""Shine Language"" before dipping into the bleary, cerebral valleys of ""Take Me Away"" and ""No Surprise + Scene 1 + Fly Paper"" (produced by Seattle beatsmith Vitamin D). Certainly Bobbie Womack's seminal Across 110th Street soundtrack is a touchstone for the sound, but you can also hear echoes of Edwin Starr's Hell Up in Harlem and Willie Hutch's Foxy Brown score in the mix. And, as with everything that comes out Quannum camp, the sound is both satisfying dense and impeccably polished. The album also manages to seamlessly employ live instrumentation-- it never feels as though the musicians are being incorporated for the sake of a gimmick. Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the album serves as a virtual reunion platform for the old Black Rock Coalition, with Vernon Reid, members of Fishbone, and George Clinton all dropping in. On the mic, lead Lifesavas MC Vursatyl delivers a virtuosic performance. He overcomes a somewhat generic voice by stringing together rapid-fire metaphors and finely detailed ghetto surveys. For most the album, he veers away from anti-rap moralizing, instead opting for a broader social criticism. ""Shine Language"", in particular, is strong. The MCs assemble a visual pastiche of housing projects, murderers, maximum-security prisons, unemployment offices, and homeless shelters. But though imagery is bleak, the message is transcendent, and the song ultimately offers a testament to the power of self-determination. Vurs ends by asking the audience to feel the tension of the disenfranchised people when it's our time. This is not an easily digestible album-- it takes a few close listens-- but it's ultimately rewarding.","Portland-based Quannum associates change their pitch up with an album steeped in the flared-out funk of blaxploitation soundtracks, even while the lyrical focus remains socially conscious.

This Bliss,Pantha du Prince,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bab1335d7bf169a182/1:1/w_160/4a5d341c.jpg,2007-06-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10273-this-bliss/,Dial,"Pantha du Prince's This Bliss hit me hardest during a train ride on a foggy evening. Peering out my window, the electricity poles looming out of the mist and then vanishing again looked like starkly geometrical trees (while the starkly geometrical trees looked like electricity poles), and the fog seemed to press against the window like it wanted inside. Most instrumental electronic music benefits from such evocative surroundings, but the work of German producer Hendrik Weber seems almost to require it: His delicate, brittle melodic techno under the Pantha du Prince moniker is itself only evocative, to the point that it only makes sense when it's making sense of the world for you. Perhaps I was vibing off how the ambiguity of the world outside mirrored the ambiguity of the music. Weber's productions, filled with fragile melodic sequences, grim basslines, dolorous chimes, reticular house percussion, and unidentifiable found sounds (TV static? Trickling water? Rocks banging together?), seems to dwell at the precise point where nature and industry become indistinguishable. It's a vantage point from which plants and machines become just more shapes to populate the surface of the earth, and from which humans are curiously absent. But Weber is not blind to the differences between the two, and This Bliss moves gracefully between visions of the natural world and its manmade counterfeits. Given the sweeping romanticism of his depiction of the former, it's not surprising that technology adopts a slightly sinister role in his work: If the music quite frequently drifts towards ""proper” dance music (often resembling the cavernous grooves of LFO's Frequencies, only with none of its playfulness), this is portrayed throughout as a sign that things are very wrong. As with Ellen Allien and Apparat's Orchestra of Bubbles album from last year, Weber is less interesting in a sonic fusion of the human and the mechanic than he is in playing the differences off one another, and This Bliss mostly sidesteps the naturalist preoccupations of much recent German techno. For all its intricacy, its lushness, this music is clearly the product of a strictly mathematical technology, its clicks and whirs and tinkling arpeggios evoking images of an abandoned factory in which the machines quietly run themselves. The mechanical abstraction of ""Moonstruck"" counterposes an ominous, almost gritty bassline and depressive, atomized synth patterns that occasionally resolve into the vigilant bleep of a life-support machine (Note to producers: This trick always works), while for long sections the moody ""Urlichten"" sounds like it's being sucked through an industrial fan. Even when Weber is indulging in crystalline and romantic visions of nature, the music remains a stage without actors: The sighing strings, furtive rustles and mournful horns of ""Saturn Strobe"" could be the sound of an abandoned forest patiently crafting its own elegy, utterly detached and yet quietly sorrowful as it awaits its own demise. Only in the anthemic final act of ""Walden 2"" is any light let in, with a succession of spectacular synth arpeggios that sound almost hopeful; but the moment passes quickly into a sense of remorse, as if hope is only defined by its own precariousness-- hope itself becomes too much to hope for in a narrative defined by decay. This overwhelming sense of loss, of something slipping away, becomes almost claustrophobic as the album continues, and exacerbates its context-dependence: In the wrong setting its pathos can become intolerable and its fragility ignorable. Choose your moments, however, and the quiet rebuke of this music makes for a magically humbling experience.","Pantha du Prince sidesteps the naturalist preoccupations of much recent German techno with this fusion of the human and the mechanic.

Icky Thump,The White Stripes,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10b13d197565213a579/1:1/w_160/858e2586.jpeg,2007-06-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10344-icky-thump/,Warner Bros.,"For all intents and purposes, the White Stripes appeared to be defunct in 2006, put on hiatus while Jack White gallivanted the globe with Midwestern pals the Raconteurs. The previous year's Get Behind Me Satan, commercial success that it was, sounded in retrospect like a man frustrated with his duo's limited options, fiddling with more keyboards and pedals than previous Stripes LPs. Coupled with White's perceptible glee at the Raconteurs' expanded sonic palette and shared frontman duties-- not to mention the more diverse wardrobe options-- some thought it unlikely he'd don the red and white again any time soon. Icky Thump, then, is a bit of a resurrection: Reuniting with Meg gives Jack the opportunity to slip back into sister-lover character, get his weird clothes out of the attic, and return to basement blues. After the straightforward radio-rock trappings of the Raconteurs, Icky Thump packs an unexpected freshness, even given its back-to-basics premise; had it come immediately after Satan, it could have seemed like a cynical, regressive gift to the core fanbase, but following Broken Boy Soldiers, it recaptures a sense of goofy fun and a caustic edge that the duo haven't possessed since White Blood Cells launched them to the A-list. Recorded over what qualifies as a marathon session for the Stripes (a whole three weeks), Icky Thump re-assembles most of the scrap-heap elements that characterized the White Stripes' pre-fame trilogy: grimy garage-blues, a left-field cover, bizarre spoken-word bits, and shameless Zeppelin and Dylan cues. The most obvious breaking development is White's instrument sound-- its tones are so aggressively tweaked that it's hard to tell whether he's playing a guitar that sounds like a keyboard or a keyboard being played like a guitar (prediction for the next White Stripes album gimmick: keytar). The leadoff title track declares this territory nicely, alternating an overdriven, tortured organ with savage guitar jabs, and already proving a better integration of keys and frets than Satan's marimba experiments. ""I'm Slowly Turning Into You"" blends Wurlitzer verses with fuzz-guitar choruses almost seamlessly; ""St. Andrew (The Battle Is in the Air)"" finds White facing off against bagpipes (yes, bagpipes) with chainsaw seizures; and on ""Conquest"", he trades shrieking Casio tones with a trumpeter. Yet, Icky Thump also treats us to a band that once again seems comfortable with its broken-in sounds, from the reverb-thud hammer of ""Little Cream Soda"" and the British Invasion 12-bar of ""300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues"" to the back-porch ditty of ""Effect & Cause"". Perennially dismissed, Meg White once again puts the lie to the theory that John Bonham like totally made Led Zeppelin bro, squeezing the most from her limited repertoire and unsteady tempo when locking in with Jack on classic Stripes-stomp breakdowns like the one in ""You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)"", where raw talent takes a backseat to chemistry. The duo's effortless dynamic on ""Bone Broke"" dismisses the garage-rock trend starting to tiresomely re-bubble yet again amongst the indie dregs, showing that world tours haven't taken them too far away from sweaty suburban Detroit house parties. But unlike most other 10th-time-around blues-rock revivalists, the Stripes don't settle for endlessly rewriting ""96 Tears"", as the record's two weirdest (and maybe best) cuts prove. ""Conquest"", with its theatrical vocal and faux-mariachi fanfares, teases a promising revved-up early Scott Walker direction until you realize that it's a meticulous recreation of the Patti Page original. ""Rag & Bone"" with its spoken-word verses, is practically a thesis statement for a band that loves to write songs about itself, casting Jack and Meg as junk collectors with a way-creepy relationship, prone to amphetamine rambles and big, chunky rock choruses. If there's a complaint to be registered about Icky Thump, it's that certain aspects of the Stripes' early character appear to have been annexed off: The sweet pop of ""You're Pretty Good Lookin' (For a Girl)"" would probably be Raconteurs property nowadays, and White's country dalliances (i.e. ""Hotel Yorba"") are totally absent. Revisiting old territory also carries with it the hazard of backward comparison, and the highest highs of Icky can't quite reach the altitude of the band's breakthrough singles, but some of that inadequacy is tempered by the group's more robust sound-- De Stijl now feels anorexic in a side-by-side taste-test. Whether it was remembering their own advice from ""Little Room"" or the freedom to write in another mode with the Raconteurs, White's strategy worked its rejuvenating magic, allowing the Stripes to roll back the stone on Icky Thump.","After the straightforward radio-rock trappings of the Raconteurs, the back-to-basics Icky Thump packs an unexpected freshness, resulting in the best White Stripes album in years.

Immaculate Machine's Fables,Immaculate Machine,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ecb1335d7bf169a1ca/1:1/w_160/cd85bae4.jpg,2007-06-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10319-immaculate-machines-fables/,Mint,"Spoiler Alert: There is a life lesson to be learned at the end of Immaculate Machine's Fables. ""Blinding Light"" ends the trio's second album with Kathryn Calder imparting a bit of wisdom for those who feel they might have lost their way: ""Sometimes when you're going down, you're going down no matter what. Find the deepest well you can and climb on in and wait it out."" Her retreat-and-wait mode of problem solving seems most appropriate for a child-- how many adults have Aesop on their bookshelves, after all-- and it appropriately draws to a gentle close a record that, not unlike a super-hip pre-school teacher, turns pop songs into proverbs. Enthusiasm is not, ironically enough, something that Immaculate Machine approaches lightly. Fables has energy and vitality to spare, but any emotional release is consistently tempered by intimations for better living.  ""Jarhand"", the record's most effusive track, opens the LP with a ramp toward a pub-chant coda (sung by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and his new discovery the Cribs, who were recording at the same studio) that
echoes Calder's occasional dalliances with the New Pornographers. Like so many A.C. Newman songs, ""Jarhand"" also packs cryptically-worded, foreboding lyrics (""always want what you don't understand,"" then ""your time is coming up"") into a buoyant, shape-shifting melody. Second track ""Dear Confessor"" continues the group's fiercely advisory power-pop spirit, warning those searching for treasure to trust their instincts, keeping in mind that ""maps won't show us where we're going."" ""C'mon Sea Legs"" effectively reverses Calder's suggestions from ""Light"", urging the most delicate form of action: ""come on now, put a sweater on and go outside for a while."" The song opens with guitarist Brooke Gallupe alone on vocals, exposing his strained croon, which he augments with bits of dramatic affect substituting for range. Calder joins Gallupe for the second half, and the song expands into a construction-paper wave of gentle encouragement. Calder's voice is as spindly and emphatic as Gallupe's is deliberate and smug, yet both come across with a youthful fervor that outpaces either's ability. The duo's harmonies thus become one of Fables' most memorable components, coming to full fruition on the foreboding ""Old Flame"", which more or less sounds like Archie and Veronica trying on the icy passion of John Doe and Exene Cervenka. It's a fine pallette from which to work, leading the song to its well-earned fiery conclusion. The band wears didacticism well, but the album's catechizing can feel a become a bit cumbersome and murky at times. This makes the Machine's enlisting of arranger-for-hire Owen Pallett seem like a perfect idea, and, as advertised, he leaves his clearly recognizable mark on two of Fables's best songs. Pallett's strings creep in for the middle-eight of ""Roman Statues"" like the French horn in the Beatles' ""For No One"", and smear the sinuous ""Small Talk"" throughout with an airy, august drama. Fables seems designed to be heard as an anthology of songs-- one that loosely uses the ideals, if not necessarily the style, of its literary predecessor-- and as such, doesn't present a uniform message, but a collection of disparate ones. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Fables is least effective when its lessons are aimed inward instead of toward whomever might be within earshot. There's nothing particularly wrong with a song like ""Nothing Ever Happens"", which sees the band go full-on into pop-punk ennui, but it feels out of place surrounded by its more lyrically adventurous counterparts. Gallupe's voice temporarily channels Will Sheff on ""Pocket"", and his strident amorousness (""I'm out looking for sex but all I get is love"") does nothing as a penultimate song but starkly contrast with Calder's skittish closer. When Fables succeeds, and it does more often than not, its songs tackle the tenuous stage of young life when quests for knowledge are pushed aside by harsh realities, offering well-intentioned advice to navigate these moments. It's a pious sentiment indeed, perhaps best summed up with a lyric from ""Small Talk"": ""The big ideas somehow snuck in when we weren't looking, and scared away the light-hearted laughter of our innocence.""","With energy and vitality to spare, Kathryn Calder-- niece of Carl Newman and sometimes New Pornographer-- here turns pop songs into proverbs.

Tomorrow No One Will Be Safe,JazkamerHoward Stelzer,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0da5e6ef95969322031/1:1/w_160/33965d61.jpg,2007-06-15 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10301-tomorrow-no-one-will-be-safe/,PACrec,"Improvised music is usually more enlightening live than on record; the mechanisms behind the madness often illuminate the sounds without demystifying them. It's kind of a reverse Wizard of Oz effect: Paying attention to the people behind the aural curtain makes their creations even more magical-- or at least trickier than the sounds alone might suggest. I've never seen Jazzkammer, the Norwegian duo of John Hegre and Lasse Marhaug, but based on their busy recorded output and mysterious use of guitar and electronics, my bet is they're fascinating to watch. I have seen Howard Stelzer, and he definitely is. The Boston-based sound artist works mostly with cassette tapes, and the way he exploits this fading technology-- discovering sounds in rewinds, hiss, and dirt-- is a unique sight. Given their intriguing methods, it's hard not to think of recordings by Stelzer and Jazzkammer as half-experiences, like a TV show with the sound turned off. But their records are really starting points-- calling cards for the audiovisual experience each offers in concert. Tomorrow No One Will Be Safe, taken from a 2004 Jazzkammer/Stelzer American jaunt, certainly contains enough interesting sonic matter to tide anyone over until either act's next tour. The first cut, ""Requiem for Officer Bobby Barker"", is by Jazzkammer alone. It begins nearly silent, with small, creaking sounds that evoke the minimalism of AMM. As the pair gradually distribute metallic clangs, morse-code-like blips, and filtered static, their swelling mix becomes like a wordless shortwave radio conversation. That the piece ends with a noisy maelstrom might be predictable, but it's the way Jazzkammer gets there-- building noise through patient, organic construction-- that's the surprise. Stelzer follows with a stranger solo piece, ""Last Night at BLD"". His sounds don't build so much as they randomly fire, shooting all over the place without any obvious interest in meshing or melding. Springy twangs, warping scratches, and the sound of tape rolling over playheads all create a cartoon soundtrack without the music. Close your eyes and you can almost see the ACME products exploding in time to Stelzer's picturesque noise. Most compelling is the collaborative, album-ending title track. Stelzer's tape warps chime in immediately, tempered by Jazzkammer's low guitar rumbles and electronic slashes. Loops of noise provide rhythm here and there, but the main attraction is the connective tissue that the three use to string their noises into arcs. Jump around the track and you'll swear all these different sounds couldn't possibly fit together, but somehow Stelzer and Jazzkammer make it all stick through simple listening and response. Whatever the shortcomings of improvised noise on record, releases like this are the only chance most people will get to hear these two Norwegian noise hounds meld minds with a Massachusetts tape addict. As such, Tomorrow No One Will Be Safe is a pretty valuable document.","Taken from a 2004 American jaunt, this live album combines the talents of a Boston-based sound artist and a Norwegian guitar-and-electronics duo.

Granddance,Dappled Cities,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0db13d197565213a529/1:1/w_160/0b995693.jpg,2007-06-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10302-granddance/,DangerbirdSpeak 'n' Spell,"I had the pleasure-- the privilege, really-- of seeing Dappled Cities live on their home turf of Sydney, Australia, several months ago. It's not every day or even every decade that I get to go to a concert in another hemisphere, and they put on a good show both times I saw them, once in an art gallery/clothing store and once in a club so sweaty the walls were dripping. What struck me even more, perhaps, was the row of utterly smitten expressions on the faces of the girls who crowded up to the front of the stages, sang along to every song and screamed their lungs out in the gaps between. I think what I valued about the show was being able to experience a band that was trying to become an international entity on a local level, seeing those fans who'd watched the band grow up and looked up to them. The larger world will never understand a band in the same way as the people in its hometown, and it's background I wish I could get more often. Dappled Cities-- alternately known as Dappled Cities Fly-- have hopped stateside with the release of their second album, and it's a record that doesn't skimp on the grand gesture, opening with its most bluntly dramatic track. The song is even called ""Holy Chord"", and it's a swelling, shimmering thing that announces the album with clipped verses that build up to a huge, grandiose falsetto hook. The band builds behind vocalist Tim Derricourt, finally leaping into a charge at the beginning of the third verse, where it begins building up again. The sound is built for an era where the Arcade Fire rules the indie rock world-- it's big and complex and pipelines emotion straight to your speakers. Derricourt shares lead vocals with fellow guitarist Dave Rennick and frequently plays the introverted foil to his partner's more theatrical presence. It keeps the album balanced and helps the flow considerably. A frequently overlooked aspect of most great bands is the presence of an inventive drummer in the lineup, someone capable of more than just a standard beat. Hugh Boyce is such a drummer, and his work helps each song carve out a distinct identity behind its melody. ""Work It Out"" is the most obvious example of this, with its thundering, staccato snare runs and sizzling crash cymbal, but even his more subtle moments can subtly transform a song. On ""Beach Song"", for instance, he rides the toms on one and three, creating a heartbeat effect behind Ned Cooke's drifting keyboards. He brings this approach to the album's most obvious single, the sweeping, mid-tempo ""Fire Fire Fire"", which opens with a fanfare that sounds like it could either be guitars or keyboards or both. The song's delivery is restrained, even subdued, but it still sticks in your head right away-- its very restraint is probably a big part of what makes the moments where Rennick and Derricourt double each other or break into falsetto even more memorable. On ""Vision Bell"", the vocals trade off falsetto and normal lines, giving the song a conversational back-and-forth that draws you in. Bassist Alex Moore holds back until the second verse, and when he drops in, it completely changes the feel of the song, the way a rip tide changes the feel of a leisurely swim. Dappled Cities are a mature band with a highly evolved sense of songcraft and arrangement. Aside from merely writing them, they know how to inhabit songs and make them breathe. It's that quality elevates Granddance beyond being simply good and makes it occasionally border on great.","This Australian indie band makes a stateside splash with its second album of big, dramatic, and complex rock.

Good Girl Gone Bad,Rihanna,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ed9d034d5c69bf494f/1:1/w_160/04826f73.jpg,2007-06-15 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10320-good-girl-gone-bad/,Def Jam,"Produced by Timbaland and co-written by Justin Timberlake, Rihanna's ""Rehab"" is a slight but solid entry into the rapidly-expanding Timbalake catalog. With its pillowy acoustic guitars and strings and rattling percussion, ""Rehab"" could hold its own against most of the second-half ballads from FutureSex/LoveSounds. But listening to the song, it's tough not to speculate how it might sound if Timberlake sang the whole thing rather than just the backing vocals. Timberlake's not Marvin Gaye or anything, but his falsetto is perfectly equipped to convey the track's plaintive, regretful sentiment. Rihanna, meanwhile...not so much. Here she comes closer than usual to depicting something resembling human emotion, but she still comes off sounding like a robot programmed to impersonate Alanis Morrissette. There's something puzzling about the way Def Jam has pulled out all the stops to anoint Rihanna as the world's newest pop superstar and to position Good Girl Gone Bad as its blockbuster summer tentpole. The chief characteristic of Rihanna's voice, after all, is a sort of knife-edged emptiness, a mechanistic precision that rarely makes room for actual feelings to bulldoze their way through. And that blankness, coupled with Rihanna's glaring lack of technical vocal skill, serve to make her a truly unlikely pop star. In the past, Rihanna's best singles (""Pon de Replay"", ""S.O.S."") have camouflaged her weaknesses by reducing her voice to a chilly sound-effect, using her on tracks propulsive and streamlined enough that she doesn't have any room to do anything other than coo melodies over the top. On last year's Evanescence-esque ballad ""Unfaithful"", though, she sounded totally lost trying to execute r&b runs that her voice just wasn't built to handle. Her current single ""Umbrella"" makes similar mistakes. The song's production gleams, but Rihanna's voice takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill the space between the slow-tempo beats. (A brain-numblingly awful Jay-Z verse helps nothing; it's like that guy's lost all interest in rapping.) ""Umbrella"" is uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics. Fortunately, most of Good Girl Gone Bad actually does the opposite, miraculously transforming Rihanna's all-consuming blankness into an aesthetic asset. The majority of Good Girl Gone Bad doesn't qualify as r&b even in its Ciara robo-diva form. Even the sleekest Ciara tracks revolve around projection of a certain emotional state: the kinetic thrill of dancing, the teasing self-assurance of denying admirers your goodies. But Good Girl is closer to teenpop territory, where sex and consumerism supersede personal connection. It's telling that a couple of the album's standout tracks come from Stargate, the Norwegian production team who made their name writing songs for posthuman British computer-pop entities like Mis-Teeq and Atomic Kitten. Stargate is responsible for the best track here, ""Don't Stop the Music"", an amazing bit of synth-bass Euroclub insanity; halfway through, sampled mamasay-mamasas from Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" come in and seamlessly blur into the track's overpowering beat. ""Push up on Me"" exploits the hell out of Rihanna's vocal similarities to any number of forgotten 80s Latin freestyle divas; she tries out a great clipped, staccato delivery over rapid-fire electro synth-blips. On ""Shut Up and Drive"", she sings about being a car looking for the right driver, appropriate considering that the song-- which samples New Order's ""Blue Monday""-- begins with über-processed new wave guitars that sort of sound like the Cars. When Good Girl Gone Bad falters, it usually does so because Rihanna's been pushed too far into her slick comfort zone; ""Say It"" is an irritatingly trebly and thin track, and ""Question Existing"" rests on puerile psuedoporn lyrics about Rihanna staring at herself naked in a mirror. But the album pushes Rihanna's flat coo through a number of different musical contexts, always finding new ways to further gloss things up. And those ideas work way more often than not, so Good Girl Gone Bad makes for an unexpectedly varied and satisfying listen. She's still a long way away from developing a recognizable personality, but at this rate, she's never going to need one.","Def Jam star and Jay-Z protégé's new album has a lot more to like about it than just its summer mega-hit ""Umbrella"".

Maths + English,Dizzee Rascal,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e39d034d5c69bf493e/1:1/w_160/48f6421f.jpg,2007-06-15 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10309-maths-english/,XL,"The back cover of the new Dizzee Rascal CD is a rear shot of the onetime grime wunderkind flipping the bird over his shoulder. Note the number of fingers raised: One, the American-style middle finger, rather than the ""V"" more traditionally associated with obscene hand gestures in the UK. Whether or not it's an acknowledgment of his American audience, however, is almost irrelevant: Stateside fans can't walk into Target or Best Buy and look at the back cover firsthand. XL has limited American sales to digital distributors. That they made this decision for Dizzee's crucial third album, Maths + English-- a record that features his most Americanized production yet and a Yank-luring guest turn from Houston rappers UGK-- is a bit perplexing. Even if this decision turns out not to be a significant constraint on his American sales (or, let's go crazy here, somehow improves them), it says a lot about XL's lack of faith in the U.S. market for grime's international ambassador: Given how the notoriously fickle audience back home has gotten tired of waiting three years for the followup to Showtime and has gravitated towards the dubstep of Burial and Skream, Dizzee's best prospects for an expanded fanbase may well be across the pond. Given his career arc, it's not impossible to see a precedent for a potential American breakthrough. With Boy in Da Corner as his scene's import-buzz breakthrough album, Showtime the self-conscious more-of-the-same-but-bigger effort, and now Maths + English as his post-genre American-mythos statement, Dizzee could very well be doing for hip-hop what many UK artists have done for rock: Reinvent its British adaptations on American terms and vice-versa. First single ""Sirens"" supposedly started as a KoRn pastiche, but it finished as the ungodly offspring of ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""99 Problems"" (with a bit of Chemical-née-Dust Brothers' ""Song to the Siren"" thrown in). And album opener ""World Outside"" offers turbocharged ambiance, glassy percussive clinks, subwoofer-stressing bass, and a chorus that ends ""There's a world outside of the ghetto, and I want you to see it/ I can see it, I can see it, I can see it."" It's easy to wonder if Dizzee is talking about more than one type of ghetto. You could hardly call the album on the whole ""grime"" without a qualifier or two, and only one track has a direct and uncontaminated lineage to his solo career's origins five years back: The belligerent touch-tone chirps of last track ""U Can't Tell Me Nuffin"", which shows up long after anyone who bothers to listen to the record in sequence will have discovered he's not making Boy in Da Corner anymore. And while it's impossible for any album where Dizzee's East London dialect figures prominently to be fully Americanized, there's a lot for the States to latch onto. ""Pussyole (Old Skool)"" is the personification of this particular trans-Atlantic exchange: While the chorus hinges on a derisive term seldom heard in the States (at least past the second syllable), the beat is so instantly recognizable as the backbone of a beloved circa-88 club-rap smash that early leaks were described as riding the ""It Takes Two"" beat. (In a neat production twist, it also incorporates the sample source that was used in the intro to ""It Takes Two"", Galactic Force Band's 1978 astro-disco obscurity ""Space Dust"", but features an entirely different, more propulsive section of the original song.) There's other, newer-school forays into Southern turf: The spare, punchy post-No Limit synth strings and drum machine beats of ""Hardback (Industry)"", which sounds like it could've easily fit somewhere on Ludacris' Back for the First Time, the Timbaland slickness of flosser's anthem ""Bubbles"" and 2-step b-girl club banger ""Flex"", and the aforementioned UGK summit ""Where's Da G's"", which pulls off the admirable feat of sounding like grime when Dizzee's on the mic and Southern bounce/g-funk during Bun B and Pimp C's verses. The tail end of the album has its share of fellow Brits mopping things up guest-wise-- Lily Allen dominates the grating music-hall pseudo-ska ""Wanna Be"", while the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner turns in a decent performance warbling the chorus of ""Temptation""-- but they don't set the tenor like the album's club-rap front half does. The other major change in Dizzee's music-- some might say concession-- is his lyrical approach, which does less to cloak his rudimentary rhymes with busy pachinko-machine production and double-time verses. This is hardly a fault; like the circa-87 incarnations of Schoolly D or KRS-One, Dizzee's strength lies in the ability to wring ferocity out of uncluttered, straightforward verses. He shines when he gets philosophical about the police's role in the community on ""Excuse Me Please"", recounting the sickness and unease that came when robbing a couple on ""Sirens"", and seething with frustrated disappointment over the duplicity of an ex-friend (a maybe/maybe-not allusion to former Roll Deep mentor Wiley) on ""Pussyole"", but even the more well-worn hip hop subjects-- paranoia, phonies, how to survive the music industry-- flow viciously in a manner that's just about as good as anybody alive when it comes to completing the sound of a production. It works in a way that can't properly be evoked by just quoting lyrics; transcribing Dizzee's verses would be like printing the guitar tabs for ""Theme From Shaft"", reducing a point-blank gut-punch of a sound to its deceptively simple base elements. You could try, of course, and that'd make a track like ""Suck My Dick"" look like imbecilic bullshit -- ""I don't give a shit who likes it/ I don't give a shit who don't/ Don't tell me to change my fuckin' attitude because I won't"" -- but you'd miss the exaggerated schoolyard nyeah-nyeah inflections, the Lemmy-bassline cadence, and the sense of adolescent mischievousness that keeps it from becoming a self-serious, tiresome fuck-you tirade. You'd also miss the fact that those lines are accompanied by a bar of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""-- he could be catering to American sensibilities on this album, but he's not caving into them.","The former grime wunderkind's third record features his most Americanized production yet and a Yank-luring guest turn from Houston rappers UGK; shame it's not for sale in U.S. stores.

Family Trees Or: Cope We Must,Sean Na Na,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e25e6ef9596932203f/1:1/w_160/aa85e1da.jpg,2007-06-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10308-family-trees-or-cope-we-must/,Dim Mak,"At least with most bands working from the ground up, you'd be getting something weird. Unlistenable, maybe, but still weird enough to justify its small niche-audience release. Putting something so benign as Sean Na Na's latest, however, on an independent label like Dim Mak just strikes me as lazy, but singer/songwriter Sean Tillmann (Har Mar Superstar) needs an outlet for every persona-- even the bland ones. The most subversive band Sean Na Na recall on Family Trees is the goddamn Shins. From the squeaky clean guitar lead to its superfluous baby-mobile keyboards and Tillmann's sudden over-reaching yelp, opener ""We've Been Here Before"" uncannily recalls James Mercer & co. (that cover isn't helping), but marching in a midtempo lock-step rhythm where the Shins would have reached for something with an ounce of color or personality. But whether they're clutching at someone else's coattails isn't the problem. If these songs were played by a four-piece guitar/drums/bass, some multi-instrumental indie band with a baseball-team roster, a midi orchestra, or a klezmer ensemble, they'd still be duller than a golf pencil simply because they aspire to so little. Tillmann's reaching on the opening track is about as exciting as it gets; on ""Don't Look Me Sideways"", he sounds like a understudy for a barbershop quartet, singing softly in his apartment so as not to wake the neighbors while the band putters away in the kitchen. Whatever aesthetic they're going for here-- 1970s power pop, 80s college-rock, or maybe more just 90s rootsy innocuousness (wither the Counting Crows and, alas, Fastball)-- it sounds muddled, indecisive, and limp. I can barely recall another band playing it so annoyingly safe. But the singer's voice is operatic compared to the range of his actual band. After the first half of this record, I wanted something, anything, to expand beyond their dorm-room pick-up band skiffle. Then I heard the leaden face-plant attempt to rock out with ""The Hunter"", and the first half didn't seem so bad after all. As a matter of fact, ""Fold, Hit, or Stand"" conjures up a vague country-influence with the twang of a staccato guitar line and barroom piano. The lyrics, too, nearly elevate this power-pap to something stirring. They're often dark and introspective against the otherwise perky backdrops, populated by characters like the burnouts of ""Don't Look Me Sideways"", or the stressed baby daddy in ""Fold, Hit, or Stand"", or the jilted lover/voyeur in ""Can't Get a Spark"". Dark lyrics on top of happy music is a gimmick older than radio, and unfortunately, it's about the only thing Family Trees has going for it.","Singer/songwriter Sean Tillmann (Har Mar Superstar) returns on a palatable and benign indie pop project that essentially sounds like dorm-room pick-up band skiffle.

City of Echoes,Pelican,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e49d034d5c69bf4941/1:1/w_160/60d4a114.jpg,2007-06-14 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10310-city-of-echoes/,Hydra Head,"That's it: Fire the drummer. Though it's a problematic if long-standing complaint, Pelican drummer Larry Herweg has consistently prevented his Chicago-based instrumental four-piece from being as transcendent as they've long been touted. On their third album, City of Echoes, it's worse than it's ever been, largely because it now seems that the excellent and consistently developing guitar duo of Laurent Schroeder-Lebec and Trevor de Brauw are better than they've ever been. The compositions and performances have become more subtle and complex and, here, are occasionally as powerful as those early Pelican moments, when a young, passionate band would grind a handful of chords into fine, red-hot dust. But Herweg, unlike his flanking guitarists and even his bassist brother Bryan, hasn't progressed beyond his role of generally beating things hard and misguiding the upswing of a song by botching fills and missing beats. On City of Echoes, he muddles some of the album's most otherwise-transcendent moments, the album's approach of more density and less repetition giving him more opportunities for failure than ever before. Plenty of them are requited. This complaint is nothing new. Long before Pelican were popularly associated with the post-rock cadre that includes Explosions in the Sky, Mono, and a dozen other post-Young Team acts, Kid606 mentioned that the band, drum machine and all, reminded him favorably of Godflesh. Oops. At this year's South by Southwest, one writer noted Herweg seemed to be made of wood. But City of Echoes demands a different drummer with finesse and a wide toolkit. After all, this is Pelican's big shot at making a more concise and dense album. City of Echoes edges 45 minutes, while 2005's The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw was 14 minutes longer with one less track. Here Pelican spent more time compacting things, excising prior largesse, and letting each part stand out more by raising the contrast. As de Brauw told Decibel reporter Andrew Parks in a fantastic, blunt feature, ""There was an intensity that wasn't there before in our songwriting-- a real heightened sense of awareness of each other's parts and a desire to write really compact, perfect songs."" But that entails a wider range of dynamics and a higher number of changes in less time, two qualities that lay a series of snare traps for Herweg. Consider the title track, the only piece here that breaks the seven-minute mark. The ideas warrant such length: Schroeder-Lebec and de Brauw diverge and converge, ricocheting between calculated broods and angular charges with guitar lines stretching as catapults. Less than two minutes in, half of the guitar duo is sprinting in sludge while the other is serializing a triumphant, ascending pattern. But if something sounds like it's unraveling, it is: As he does with almost all of his transitional movements, Herweg falls apart by a hit or two, chopping his hands and losing his place. It's awkward and unnatural, detracting from the intended motion entirely. Pelican proper sounds so good here, really: They're as aggressive and brimming as they are patient and smart, writing an anthem harmed by corrupted technique. But it's not that Herweg simply can't play; he can't place properly in the band's evolving approach, either. Herweg sits the record's acoustic midsection out, but he spoils the album's other quiet track, closer ""A Delicate Sense of Balance"". He understeps his pace on a simple turn-around, but even when on point, his big, lumbering drums sound cumbersome and stiff. The guitars snake; he stomps, occasionally subdiving his beat without any awareness for the rest of the band. By the time the track peaks, Herweg stays in place. And, when one of the guitars finally trails off for the dénouement, Herweg's sore thumb is still there, negating delicacy. Herweg's drumming and complete oblivion to feel doesn't allow Pelican the range to be the exciting, dynamic band that's capable of the structural complexity they're interested in here. This makes City of Echoes static and, often, boring. Ignoring the rhythm section and its side effects, though, this is the best Pelican album yet, largely because de Brauw and Schroeder-Lebec are only getting better in tandem, increasingly comfortable as complementary foils. On ""Far From Fields""-- one of the disc's late-breaking, open-vista tracks-- one guitarist embraces textural sweeps while the other builds through a surface staccato motion. Both guitars eventually arrive together, on top, flipping between near-harmonies and counterpoints. It's a special moment, pure finesse. Behind his kit, though, just as the guitars open up and soak in the shimmer of their sound, Herweg sounds like he's staring down, grimacing and just heave-hoeing, sticks in hands, oblivious to the aural eclipse happening feet away. If you focus too hard on how Herweg's trying to keep up (with himself?) and failing, you could miss the beauty of that moment, too. Or you could simply continue to demand more from this ""[quasi-] triumphant band."" ","The excellent and consistently developing guitar duo of Laurent Schroeder-Lebec and Trevor de Brauw are here hamstrung by an unraveling rhythm section.

Sketchi,Cex,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e013d197565213a530/1:1/w_160/8fc1785c.jpeg,2007-06-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10306-sketchi/,Temporary Residence,"No sooner was Rjyan Kidwell beloved for being the most accessible purveyor of a then in-vogue IDM than he switched to, in order, white-boy rap, industrial flailing, public nudity, stand-up comedy, traditional indie-rock, bedroom production, and recently, marital-aid funk. Sketchi, a limited-release on Temporary Residence, chooses hollowed-out studio-reggae as its new frontier. Cex's vaunted aversion to continuity holds up-- all that remains from his last release, Actual Fucking, is a reprisal of that record's ""Denton"" (on ""Damon Kvols"") and similarly eye-catching graphic design. Actual Fucking's cover depicted a guy jizzing, in big comic book droplets, on a girl's arched back. Sketchi one-ups its predecessor with an altered still from Twins: A black cloud of smoke pours out of Danny DeVito, obscuring most of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In place of DeVito's face is an explosion and a collaged-in cloud of debris. We're meant to recall the World Trade Center towers at the moment they came down-- Kidwell's provocations just don't stop. Whether it's worth overcoming whatever reaction this elicits in you, I have no idea. As it happens, Sketchi is one of Cex's best records: rhythmically convincing, menacingly dark. Distance and space are what Kidwell's added: The skittish, distant drum-and-bass of ""Rattler Bin"" comes as if from three or four blocks away, while ""Camber Sands"" expands indefinitely out of a single sound, something like a hollow pipe falling to the ground. Late-period Boredoms and Cex's fellow Baltimore noise act Wzt Hearts come to mind on tracks such as the ocean-steady ""Goober Says"". Plus, Kidwell's endemic hostility to his own audience finally comes in handy. His new songs, in their repetitive cruelty, are more affecting for being abusive. ""Damon Kvols"", Sketchi's restless opener, adds inaudible, howling chants and moans to an already centerless bass and impatient delay; the discomfort of the stray sounds and the low end's relentless pulse only multiplies over the track's 10 minutes. Kidwell strips away all the extras-- including his recently ubiquitous vocals-- to bring you face-to-face with the almost sickeningly steady motion often hidden within his compositions. Does anybody actually listen to old Cex records? One byproduct of Kidwell's experiments has been to firmly date each record of his, in sequence. But it's hard to imagine him being able to derail Sketchi and its persuasive simplicity, even if he doesn't make another record like it.","On this limited-release Temporary Residence record, the shapeshifting Rjyan Kidwell tackles hollowed-out studio-reggae and the results are menacingly dark.

Speicher 3,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ebb1335d7bf169a1c8/1:1/w_160/bce28d29.jpg,2007-06-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10318-speicher-3/,Kompakt Extra,"For a project that began as a big ol' umbrella for Cologne techno, Kompakt has never had much of a sonic thumbprint, as likely to toss out Justus Köhncke's cosmic disco as Jürgen Paape's beer-hall diva house as Kaito's piano-happy neo-trance. Even as far back as 2004, on the heels of the Kompakt 100 remix collection, Pitchfork techno guru Philip Sherburne pointed out in a The Wire magazine review that Kompakt's tenuous unity had already begun to crack into a confederacy of sub-labels-- Kompakt Pop, Kompakt Extra, and later K2-- all devoted to specialized tweaks on the sound of a label as catholic as any German techno imprint. Kompakt Extra was for the Speicher series, and the distinction made sense. The Speicher records were, at least in the arena of continental European post-techno, out-and-out bangers designed for maximum shirts-off, popper-fueled dancefloor humping. That wasn't something a DJ could always be sure of with a regular Kompakt release. Whatever the individual sound, Speicher releases always had a certain functional consistency-- a brand identity as it were. Speicher 3, the latest ""digital mix"" of recent Speicher singles by Kompakt's Michael Mayer and Jörg Burger, is proof that over the last few years either Kompakt's regular roster (many of which appear here anyway) has moved closer to the sound of Speicher or vice versa. Whereas Kompakt's early 00s mixes were often mid-tempo, melodic, and stuffed with quirky choices, there's far less difference between Speicher 3 and Michael Mayer's techno-focused Immer 2 on plain' ol Kompakt. For sure Speicher 3 is still closer to something you'd hear on a Friday night than Tobias Thomas' recent, crepuscular come down mix Please Please Please. But now the rest of the clubbing world has caught up to Kompakt's version of minimal techno, or maybe it's Kompakt that's caught up to the rest of the clubbing world's version of minimal techno. A track like Superpitcher's ""Enzian"" retains the unearthly quality (those reverb-slurred chimes, for instance) that spreads like mist in a Hammer horror flick through much of his work, but the paired electro-house rhythm running underneath the briny mix means the dancefloor will stay full when the needle hits the groove. Typical for a Speicher collection, the mix is fairly uniform in terms of tempo and structure, and as usual with Kompakt in straight-ahead mode (and minimal techno in general), the trick to enjoying Speicher 3 is often about the ability to get lost in the each track's devilish details. Jurgen Paape's ""Fruity Loops #2"" is simultaneously the mix's most propulsive couple of minutes--that surging bassline splitting the difference between deep house and Detroit techno--and its most lovingly finessed, kitted out with multiple layers of shivery synth pads, clanging piano chords, and Italo disco arpeggios. But hewing to the series' stated mission of body moving, most of Speicher 3's best tracks stick to the basic writ of hypnotizing dancers first and getting fussy with the sonics later, like Axel Bartsch stringing nothing but his percolating, compulsive handclaps across a bottomless pit of black low-end on ""Deal"". John Dahlback's ""Wet Summer"" squrims with pointillist synth blips and gurgles like a bucket full of robot grubs, but Misc's roid-raging post-acid house splurts and spizz over a jacking beat on ""Status Now"" revel in the restrictive pleasures of dance classicism. Speicher 3 will be comforting terra cognita for longtime Kompakt fans, and like all Kompakt mixes, it takes a little while to move into first gear, Mayer and Burger continually preferring a long-view percussive tease to one hammering climax after another. The mix's actual climax, Motiivi:Tuntematon's ""Mankind Failed"", is almost an anti-climax, four minutes of charging drums that fizzle like a snuffed match only to flame up again into an atonal breakdown of gnarled, mile-high synthesizers and distorted digital feedback that's left to play out in all its 8:58 sturm-und-drang intensity. It's the ugliest sound Kompakt has ever pressed to vinyl, sounding more like a selection from Kevin Drumm's Sheer Hellish Miasma, and an utterly perverse way to close out a dance mix, even a dark one. If any artist on Speicher 3 is one to watch, it's these three Finns, and even if it's not ""the point,"" the mix could have used a few more curveballs like ""Mankind Failed"". There's a point where brand consistency teeters on the edge of contemptible familiarity, after all.","The latest collection of recent Speicher singles-- digitally mixed by Kompakt's Michael Mayer and Jörg Burger-- features tracks by German techno heavy-hitters such as Superpitcher, Jürgen Paape, and Mayer himself.

Wild Mountain Nation,Blitzen Trapper,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ceea9e61561daa66a4/1:1/w_160/2cb00a79.jpg,2007-06-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10292-wild-mountain-nation/,Lidkercow Ltd,"Blitzen Trapper have self-released three albums since 2003, including their latest, Wild Mountain Nation. The struggle of DIY indie bands can be over-romanticized, but in the case of Blitzen Trapper, the freedom to work at their own pace is most likely what brought them to come up with the cock-eyed stylistic blitzkrieg of Wild Mountain Nation. The steps up to it have been hesitant: The band's first two albums adhered to both earnest country-derived conventions and a modern disregard for the constraints of genre, somehow reconciling these two impulses to cook up perfectly listenable, if somewhat tentative, pop on tracks like ""Summer Twin"", ""Asleep for Days"", and ""Texaco"", to name a few. But aside from a few songs worth cherry-picking, none showed the work of a group destined for the spotlight-- or, for that matter, capable of deciding between being an alt-country revival act or boundary-blurring experimentalists. It's better for all of us they've refused to focus. While I'm loathe to make a Pavement reference (lo-fi recordings! Slackers with guitars!!1!), Wild Mountain Nation comes closer to catching the carefree fuck-off sprawl of Wowee Zowee than any record in recent memory. Here the band sail through any number of genres and styles without giving off a whiff of effort, their apparent West coast breeziness covering for the judicious amount of detail crammed into nearly every song. Opener ""Devil's a Go-Go"" undermines its windmilling guitars with stuttering, unpredictable rhythm; those same hiccups slide inauspiciously into the unrepentant country/southern-rock of the title track. Singer Eric Earley double-tracks himself with as much personality as his reedy voice can muster, but there's a ringer somewhere in the Blitzen Trapper's pack of guitarists-- some Guitar Center regional manager bending notes with optimal precision, lifting these songs to more authentic peaks. Elsewhere, the prim and proper indie pop of ""Futures & Folly"" collides with the snarling glam rave-up of ""Miss Spiritual Tramp"" (which features a brief harmonica and, swear to god, a jaw-harp hoedown). The canny snake-charmer guitar line of ""Sci-Fi Kid"" fits easily on any satellite radio playlist, yet here it's next to the gleefully raucous carnival stomp of ""Woof & Warp of the Quiet Giant's Hem"". All of them demand equal attention on a dizzyingly sequenced album. Compared to their previous albums, Wild Mountain Nation has a newfound and audible confidence. It's the work of an assured band who can not only treat genre like so much fingerpaint, but brave enough to play it straight for a minute-- not as an empty exercise, but a chance to aspire. ""Summer Town"" is the record's big breather, a washed-out AM country ballad on which Earley sings slowly and carefully through his most arresting lyrics while a harmonica, its tone sweet and simple, cements the song's yearning. Closing tracks ""Country Caravan"" and the western slowpoke ""Badger's Black Brigade"" are chummy and unpretentious sing-alongs, and while the former comes a little too close to the Eagles for comfort, it's only because of its fantastically broad but contagious melody. The home run, though, is the title track, conjuring up easy freedom-rock images and Last Waltz montages, but forget nostalgia and influence for just a moment: The whole song swings, the guitars bend as proudly and woozily as teenagers with stolen six-packs, and on every clear enunciation and careful slur, you can hear Earley's grin. But as diverse as it is, and as joyous as it is, Wild Mountain Nation just has songs worth coming back to. It's the title track's early vocal hook that begs you to replay it before anything else, and then maybe the fact that it's so crammed with slide guitars that the edges glisten. The gentle, almost uptight pop (comparatively) of ""Futures & Folly"" bely its resilient melody, as it's the nugget that holds up best after repeated listens. I could list more highlights-- like, the downtuned dark horse ""Hot Tip/Tough Cub"", or playful glam tribute ""Murder Babe"", or or or-- but if you're down with the diversity and can sit still while the band tears through every idea it has left, Wild Mountain Nation is a revelation from beginning to end.","On their third album, Portland-based Blitzen Trapper unleash a cock-eyed stylistic blitzkrieg that comes closer to catching the carefree fuck-off sprawl of Pavement's Wowee Zowee than any record in recent memory. Spanning midwestern country-rock, mild-mannered indie pop, jagged art-rock, and West Coast swoon, Wild Mountain Nation swears allegiance to multiple touchstones of indie rock without limiting itself to just one.

Buncha Beans,King Kong,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0dc9d034d5c69bf4933/1:1/w_160/c1816a71.jpg,2007-06-13 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10303-buncha-beans/,Drag City,"Returning after a five-year absence, armed with Buncha Beans' goofy hee-haw party-rock, King Kong are showing more stamina than I could've ever imagined. I first caught the Louisville group in the early 1990s while ""working"" as a college radio DJ. I didn't care much for chuckles in my music, but Ethan Buckler's Calvin Johnson-meets-Fred Schneider monotone on Old Man on the Bridge struck me as wonderfully weird. Fifteen or so years after that Homestead debut? Well, big ups for stamina. Back then, something I'd zeroed in on and relished was that Buckler had been Slint's original late-80s bassist (he'd departed after recording Tweez). I was obsessed with everything Slint, so around the same time, in 1993, I was also keen on that fact that another Drag City act, Will Oldham, had taken the cover photo for Spiderland, but put out a collection of creaky, melancholic mountain music, There Is No-One What Will Take Care Of You. Seems insane now, but there were legitimate ""late-night debates"" about authenticity, whether or not Oldham was shitting us with a sort of yokel punch line (one dude getting teary to ""I Tried To Stay Healthy For You""). Of course, turns out Oldham wasn't fucking with us. I mention this because in his transition from Slint bassist to B-52-style chanty ringleader, Buckler wasn't fucking with us either-- though his honesty is much less satisfying than Oldham's. What sounded fresh and unhinged in 1992 comes off here as pretty darn stale. Buncha Beans is a return to King Kong's traditional sound following 2002's The Big Bang, which found the band incorporating more electro accents. The band's albums usually center on a specific theme; this one has an arc of animal stories involving cockroaches, monkeys, a ""funky mule"" (uh-oh), elephants, hippos, zebras, kangaroos, and, among others, a ""bald-headed"" eagle and pack of caribous watching steamrollers, bulldozers, and billions of people. Yeah, it's a critique of modern society, of us. Silly as the songs are and as half-baked as the critique comes off, King Kong often finds pretty fun grooves, like the up-beat, surfer-moseying ""Bulldozers"" or the disco high-hat swiveling ""Bug Make"". The storyline of the latter? You smash a bug, wonder ""what difference does a bug make?"" Cue the war/modernization theme and Kafka. Being ""tough in the city"" (or universe) comes up again on ""Tough Guys"", where Buckler's joined by a female vocalist for a sorta rising last-dance/prom-theme/Banana Splits/slow-mo Shaft anthem. Really. He ends the song-- over six minutes later-- with a spoken list of toughs, including my favorite, ""Sloped Forehead Ted."" What ties 'em together? Well, they know that ""cigarettes are not enough"" and ""they're all dead."" Yikes. A pattern's developed over time and the album's title track follows a standard King Kong method of introducing a simple theme, maxim, or well-worn cliché, and then tweaking it with a play on words or subversive inversion. In this case, a bunch of beans come in various colors with different, shapes, dispositions, and fates. Some watch porno. Many create alienating societies. He doesn't mention it, but I'm guessing some even write record reviews for Pitchfork. Eventually, pulling a Walt Whitman, Buckler hits us with ""I'm a can of beans."" As with most of the record, this a-ha's cute, but doesn't add up to a hill of...","After a five-year absence, the Louisville group returns with a Drag City-released album of hee-haw party-rock.

"Soul Sides, Volume 2: The Covers",Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0deb1335d7bf169a1b5/1:1/w_160/7c4f38c0.jpg,2007-06-13 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10305-soul-sides-volume-2-the-covers/,Zealous,"It's a bit perplexing when a blog-- especially one as historically minded as Oliver Wang's encyclopedic Soul Sides-- releases a compilation CD, much less an ongoing series. For one thing, there's the financial aspect: several of these tracks have ostensibly been available for free download at some time or another. Why buy the cow and so on? More crucially, there's the technological aspect: Mp3 blogs offer a product that is supposed to make compact discs obsolete. So why bother retrofitting your merchandise to increasingly irrelevant technology, especially when sales of music in corporeal form are tanking? While I can't speak for Wang or anyone at Zealous Records, there are two possible reasons for setting up this series on disc. First, the audience for decades-old soul music (aside from music critics of course) may tend to skew much older than visitors to sites like Stereogum or Said the Gramophone, attracting an audience that's still grumbling about the quality loss from vinyl to CD-- and don't get them started on CD to digital. So this is a means of branding Wang's site to a larger audience that might not look to the internet as a first source for music. Second, the music nearly demands the medium. Apart from a few notable exceptions like Isaac Hayes' Hot Buttered Soul or Marvin Gaye's What's Going on, soul favors emotion conveyed in quick bursts rather than drawn out across an album, which has made the music easily compilable under endless themes-- artists, labels, songwriters, eras, cities, even subject matter. From Memphis Soul Classics to the Numero Group's Eccentric Soul project to the latest Trikont musical essay, the compilation may be the most effective delivery system for the music and the most useful summation of its development. Releasing CD-based compilations is a means for Wang not only to collect and comment on that history, but also to participate in it. Just two volumes into its hopefully lengthy run, Soul Sides speaks to the depth and breadth of Wang's collection, mixing the new and the old, the obscure and, well, the slightly less obscure. These two discs cover decades, tracing the music from its roots to its current manifestations while offering an admirably inclusive definition of soul. Following the themeless but solid Volume 1, Volume 2 is billed as a covers compilation, which is perhaps inevitable considering that the best tracks on Volume 1 were Donny Hathaway's better-than-the-original take on John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" and Erma Franklin's ""Piece of My Heart"". Avoiding obvious choices and easy novelties, Wang unearths some gems: Volume 2 kicks off with Sharon Cash's enormous and immediate ""Fever"", with its immense horns and her immenser vocals. Al Green doesn't change very much on the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", but his ecstatic delivery completely reinvents the tune. Following the organ-drenched uptempo jam of Spanky Wilson's ""Kissing My Love"", O.V. Wright's performance on his grave cover of Latimore's ""Let's Straighten It Out"" strikes a fine balance between despair over a lover's sadness and hope that they can resolve it, giving his pleading a sense of firm authority. Wang's choice of songs is nearly impeccable, but his presentation seems problematic. Volume 2 moves via unintentionally jarring transitions and awkward juxtapositions. For example, Green's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" sets up Esther Phillips' coolly bitter ""Home Is Where the Hatred Is"", which is then followed by Marcia Griffiths' slinky ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"". It's a strange sequence that detracts from Phillips' real-life hopelessness and makes the physicality of Green's and Griffiths' songs sound frivolous. Wang backloads Volume 2 with single-play curios like El Michels Affair's nearly note-for-note re-creation of Isaac Hayes' ""Walk on By"" (itself a cover of a Burt Bacharach tune) and Laura Lee's sluggish ""What a Man"", which has none of the robust spirit of Linda Lyndell's original. These might have sounded stronger peppered throughout the album, but together, they weigh down the comp's second half. It might seem nitpicky to point out sequencing missteps like these, but any good compilation-- and especially a soul compilation-- should be able to generate a larger groove, with each track building on the previous to create a fluid arc from start to finish. The tracklist for Volume 2 actively detracts and distracts from each song's impact and meaning, which makes the whole sound disjointed. But that's what playlists are for.","Oliver Wang's encyclopedic and historically minded blog Soul Sides issues its second album, a covers record that features Al Green vs. the Beatles, as well as tracks by Marcia Griffiths, Spanky Wilson, and O.V.

Electric Dress,Carlos GiffoniMerzbowJim O’Rourke,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d313d197565213a51c/1:1/w_160/7d0a75f4.jpg,2007-06-13 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10295-electric-dress/,No Fun,"When Brooklyn noise fiend Carlos Giffoni set out for Japan last fall, he had just about finished his first all-analog solo album, Arrogance. Sticking to computer-less mode, he dubbed his five-date Far East jaunt ""The Synth Destruction Tour."" At a duo show with Merzbow, Giffoni was surprised to find Masami Akita in a similar mode. The King of Japanese Noise also chose to play the gig with only analog equipment, including his infamous homemade instrument comprised of springs and junk metal. It was the first time Akita had worked without a laptop or other digital implements in at least a decade. Recordings from that date were released in April on Important as Synth Destruction, and now Giffoni has issued the pair's only other performance from the tour-- in a trio with Jim O'Rourke-- on his own No Fun label. O'Rourke edited and mastered the album's single 52-minute track, a relentless, exhaustive journey through nearly every synth noise imaginable. Whirring static, spurting effects, heavy drones: everything you'd expect from three prolific noisemakers is here, all doled out in big, dense brush strokes. Yet Electric Dress is no oppressive onslaught. Each participant is careful to share and trade sonic space with the other, and what could have been claustrophobic or suffocating is instead a balanced improvisation, akin to a thoughtful free jazz session. Most interesting is how no one here shies away from any kind of sound. Even the most standard synth noodlings and laser-like squiggles are given equal chance to make a dent. Any noise aficionado has heard all these sounds before, but the way the trio times them, massaging them to fit inside the mix's ever-changing shape, breathes new life into well-worn sonic tools. Not that Electric Dress will win over many skeptics. The album is actually relatively easy to enter, opening with 20 minutes of varied sounds that form mini-patterns, even getting rhythmic at times. But once the noises pile up, things ascend into a challenging assault that rarely recedes. From there, a diverse collection of sonic parts add up to a monolithic sum-- the kind only noise obsessives are likely to sift through. But for such diehards, Electric Dress is a ton of fun to get lost in, living up to any expectations these three daunting names might inspire. Merzbow was back in the States just recently to play Giffoni's No Fun Fest, but the creative success of this record demands that Giffoni return the favor, and get back into Akita and O'Rouke's sonic territory as soon as possible.","Noise mavens come together in Japan to make a racket with analog machines; what could have been claustrophobic or suffocating is instead a balanced improvisation, akin to a thoughtful free jazz session.

Kitsuné Maison 4,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d2ea9e61561daa66a8/1:1/w_160/208e9f19.jpg,2007-06-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10294-kitsune-maison-4/,Kitsuné,"I poked fun at Darkel's ""Be My Friend"" when I first reviewed it, but that was probably the best track on Air lunar safarian Jean-Benoît Dunckel's disappointingly limp solo outing. Still, it came as a surprise to see this relatively sleepy song chosen to start the newest compilation by Paris-based label Kitsuné, which along with neighbor Ed Banger has played a huge role the past couple of years in expanding the intersection between indie rock and dance music. The best selections on the previous three Kitsuné Maison comps tended to be more muscular: Hot Chip, Klaxons, Simian Mobile Disco...hell, even underrated Swedish synth-popper Jenny Wilson. Darkel's fey, mid-tempo tune about forever friendship wouldn't be my first pick to get a party started. So maybe it's a declaration of intent. Air can hardly be considered ""dance"", but they were one group both rock fans and electronic-music obsessives could agree on in the mid- to late-90s. They got pretty big, scoring Sofia Coppola films and landing whichever TV commercial placements Moby didn't, without sacrificing much critical esteem. Sure, the mid-80s PBS vibe of the synths on ""Be My Friend"" does jibe with the analogue nostalgia of some other Kitsuné Maison inclusions. But what the track lacks in dancefloor-friendly beats it may make up for in symbolism. Like: Axes, keyboards, it don't matter. And: This stuff is getting pretty big; Klaxons are on MTV. Kitsuné Maison 4 is another solid collection of previously 12""-only releases that stretch across the indie-dance axis. Some of the best cuts will already be familiar to most readers who keep track of this stuff, which it's still tempting to call silly names like ""nu rave"" or ""blog house"". The intoxicated blips and fractured loops of Thieves Like Us' ""Drugs in My Body"" accompany a frail indie-dude vocal, appropriate for going out or coming down. Feist's ""My Moon My Man"", remixed here by Boyz Noize but originally from this year's excellent The Reminder, proves pleasantly well-suited to dry dance beats, robot guest vox, and a jerky bass groove. Adam Sky's remix of ""La Musique"", by Australian dance-poppers Riot in Belgium, adds sleazy electronics to a French-language club stomper. Fellow Aussies (and Kitsuné faves) Van She have remixed this track and also Dragonette's ""I Get Around"". The latter appears here in a Midnight Juggernauts mix, with sparkling, filtered synths around Martina Sorbara's digitally tweaked vocals about doing the wrong thing and feeling pretty right. There are pleasant surprises, too. Rambunctious Toronto duo Crystal Castles take a bewitched, bewitching turn on ""Knights"", which keeps their trademark 8-bit squiggles but buries a dolorous vocal in nocturnal distortion. Grime-informed UK band Hadouken! chat up a girl who's ""fit but fucking boring"" on ""Tuning In (H! Re-Rub)"", which sounds like the Streets for places with ridiculous cover charges and no jukebox. ""Yes, I've got a nice place/ And I don't mind, we can walk at your pace,"" frontman James Smith spits. The sing-song vox and stripped-down groove of Whitey's electro-folk ""Stay on the Outside"" is just a monster Led Zeppelin mash-up away from a White Stripes song. OK, is the Kitsuné aesthetic ready for its media close-up? Yeah, in all likelihood, though perhaps thanks more to Simian Mobile Disco, Klaxons, and Ed Banger's Justice than Kitsuné Maison 4, which still lacks any tracks as instantly godly as those artists' best works. Nevertheless, the latest compilation shows what diverse results this approach may yield, from the guitar-driven dance-punk of London band Punks Jump Up's ""Dance to Our Disco"" (closer to Shy Child on the Rapture-Radio 4 spectrum) to the rocking, Justice-like electro of Los Angelenos Guns N Bombs on ""Crossover Appeal"". Kelly, watch the charts.","The latest compilation from Paris-based label Kitsuné is another solid collection of previously 12""-only releases that stretch across the indie-dance axis, including tracks performed or remixed by Feist, Thieves Like Us, Crystal Castles, Dragonette, Boys Noize, and Darkel.

Daydream Nation: Deluxe Edition,Sonic Youth,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f79d034d5c69bf4958/1:1/w_160/32703652.jpg,2007-06-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10326-daydream-nation-deluxe-edition/,EnigmaEnigma,"I don’t expect to hear too many complaints about the rating above. Daydream Nation is a great uniter: You’d be hard pressed to find many fans of indie rock who don’t have some love for this record. That’s partly because this record is great, sure—that’s one boring reason—but it’s also because this record is one of a handful that helped shape the notion of what American indie rock can potentially mean. It’s almost a tautology: Indie fans love Daydream Nation because loving stuff like Daydream Nation is part of how we define what indie fans are. Not that there wasn’t plenty of underground music in the U.S. before this album’s 1988 release—hardcore punk, high-art avant garde, quirky college rock, DIY, weirdo regional scenes. But the notion that all those Reagan-era discontents might be in the same boat—a new Alternative Nation just beginning to converge—hadn’t yet been fully articulated. Sonic Youth sensed that convergence in the making, and they were pretty sure it had something to do with Dinosaur Jr.: “A new aesthetic of youth culture,” Thurston Moore called it in Matthew Stearns’ 33 1/3 book about the album, “wherein anger and distaste, attributes associated with punk energy, were coolly replaced by head-in-the-clouds outer limits brilliance.” Right. So the band writes the most glorious, accessible pop song of its career, calling it “J Mascis for President”—i.e., an underground-rock campaign song—and it kicks off this record under the title “Teen Age Riot.” What does that sound like if not the grand calling-together of a nascent underground audience? Sonic Youth don’t set the song up as a call to arms. Instead, Thurston, singing, is in bed, just like you might be while listening to it—or to Bug, or Surfer Rosa, or Isn’t Anything, all of which came within the same year. Just two motes of potential energy, both waiting for Mascis to “Come running in on platform shoes/With [his] Marshall stack/To at least just give us a clue.” The video for this song contains more images of musicians who aren’t in Sonic Youth than musicians who are: Ian MacKaye, Patti Smith, Mark E. Smith, Iggy Pop, Black Flag, Sun Ra, Daniel Johnston, Neil Young, the Beach Boys—a crash course in what still, almost 20 years later, looks like an indie canon. Following that, the band spends this double album managing to inhabit just about every major strain of the underground, collecting and referencing each facet of what this “new youth culture” might look like: All melted down into one lump: “Seamless” isn’t even the word. Of course, now that a whole genre's grown out from Daydream Nation’s roots, all its “difficult” sounds, modified guitars, and strange collisions have become de riguer, invisible, and normalized, more clearly revealing the shimmering pop epics that always lay beneath. What’s really shocking is the energy of it. This record’s default setting is the place most rock bands try to work up to around the third chorus—guitar players veering off into neck-strangling improvisations, singers dropping off the melody and into impassioned shouts. These songs start there and just stay. Usually the guitars spend a few bars wandering off and into sideways tangles, choking out their harmonies, and then come back together and spend a few bars pinning down the riff: On “’Cross the Breeze,” that means Kim Gordon keeps returning to the same refrain, each time grunting it more insistently than the last. Sometimes they don’t even stay there: Lee Ranaldo’s “Hey Joni” starts off already on some next level of energy, and then Lee shouts “kick it!” and the band ratchets up to some next next level, and then he coasts up to one exhilarating shouted “HEY!” and the band bursts through a ceiling higher than you could have imagined at the start of the track. It’s the kind of transcendent glory that crosses genres and even arts: that same in-the-zone feeling you get from a be-bop combo in top gear, a rapper at the absolute clear-eyed peak of his game—hell, even an athlete in perfect function. Lyrically, it’s Thurston who turns in the rock slacker trash: When he’s not just lying in bed, heÆs wandering around downtown Manhattan, getting mugged, blowing up amplifiers, and talking in a stoned skater-kid argot (“you got to fake out the robot!”). Lee, being Lee, exists on some more mystical future/past plane, located in dreams and open fields instead of on the Bowery. Kim’s lyrics are the brutal, terrifying ones, each song outlining a flirtation with some demonic jerk. In “Kissability,” it’s a rotten entertainment mogul, pledging “you could be a star” and probably playing with himself under his desk. In “Eliminator Jr,” it’s Robert Chambers, the teenage rich-kid “Preppy Murderer,” and a horrible little shit even before he raped and strangled Jennifer Levin behind the Met in Central Park. In “’Cross the Breeze,” it may be the devil himself. This reissue does what reissues have to do these days, raising the volume to compete with all the over-compressed new stuff on your mp3 player. Someone’s clearly taken care with the process, making sure not to spoil the wide dynamics of this music, but this kind of re-master isn’t the best fit for the open-room feel of the original: I’d be lying if I said the crystalline brambles of guitar in these songs didn’t suffer a little from being flattened out like this. (Steve Shelley’s busy, subtle drumming gets a particularly raw deal.) Mild audiophiles—or anyone attached to the feel of the original CD and LP issues-—might want to spring for the vinyl re-release. On the plus side, this package is well aware that Daydream Nation is for celebrating Daydream Nation, and that there are already record stores where you can spend a year’s salary on Sonic Youth rarities. Never mind the four covers included, or the home demo of “Eric’s Trip” that quietly fades out the album disc: The treat, for this album’s devotees, is a terrific, seamless collection of album-contemporary live performances, touching on every song on the album. (Yes, even “Providence.”) It’s a thrill, and not just for those who've heard this record enough times to need a fresh perspective. Daydream Nation was one great, liberated scribble on the mostly blank slate of what underground rock was starting to become, and through these tracks you get to hear the band take it out on the road and show it to everyone—playing loose, sliding energetically through things they made precise on record. And, 12 tracks in, taking their J Mascis campaign song on a Straight Talk Expressway to Yr Skull.","A deluxe, remastered version of the indie rock classic, this original 1988 album was the first full articulation that the underground music of the Reagan era—hardcore punk, high-art avant garde, quirky college rock, DIY, weirdo regional scenes—was converging into a new, exciting Alternative Nation.

The Dark One,Alsace Lorraine,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d513d197565213a51e/1:1/w_160/2d642f85.jpg,2007-06-12 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10297-the-dark-one/,Darla,"The cover photograph of The Dark One, the first record since 2001 from Alsace Lorraine, seems designed to represent a symbolic break with the past from the band's previous (and only other) album, Through Small Windows. Dark's picture shows a window, but from the outside of a building in disrepair, ready for renovation. The group itself has gone through a significant overhaul over the past six years-- the hiatus caused by core member Paul Francke's recovery from health problems and entrance into an Episcopalian seminary-- and Dark features a new vocalist, Isol, the former singer for Argentinean electro-pop group Entre Rios. Isol is also an illustrator of books for what she calls ""smart children"", and her lyrics-- highbrow narratives presented through a thick veneer of youthful wonder-- merge with Francke's hazy, weightless backdrops and wry introspection to create an muted, effervescent collection of ivory-tower indie pop. Dark's clear highlight is ""Call for Papers"", which favorably compares to predecessors who've also highlighted the ""twee"" in ""tweed"": the Magnetic Fields, Belle & Sebastian, and especially Camera Obscura, whose wonderfully glum academic rebuke from last year, ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken"", feels like its companion piece. Taking a subject line of so many inter-collegiate e-mails seeking intellectual collaboration and re-imagining it as a plea for improved interpersonal communication might seem a recipe for disaster of the ponytail/elbow-patch variety, but ""Paper""'s duet is heartfelt and, in its own way, sweet. Isol responds to Francke's romantic plea (""How many times have I cut your hair?"") by lamenting her silence as a ""writer's block,"" arising as it does from a too-quantitative approach to love: ""weighing facts, cataloguing dreams."" ""Papers"" comes during the middle of Dark's first half, surrounded by likeminded songs that highlight the band's knack for wispy melodies, opaque literary pretensions, and, occasionally, bizarre yet still appropriate-sounding phrases. The chiming, xylophone-laden ""As We Fight"" mines the same Spectorian territory as the Pipettes, while featuring the lines ""Homeskillet, does she calm your Dad?"" and ""There is a way that clinically sad students in love talk, my darling."" ""Dulce et Decorum"" is a Cocteau Twins song masquerading as a Basil King motivational tract (""Vigilant bulrushes kneel before you, surround and guard you""), and ""One Day, Far Off, If the World Forgot"" imagines a future where ""the world forgot all about rock"" and ""if in our teenage years, nothing changed."" It's not a sad song either, just cautiously speculative, from the same emotional distance the rest of Dark employs to good effect. Like good intellectuals, Francke and Isol know in which tradition they're situated: Saint Etienne's Ian Catt and the Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie show up to remix ""Papers"" and ""The Tall Grass"", respectively. Unfortunately, Guthrie feels the need to create a stereotypically Cocteau-esque icy whirr, thereby sapping the original of its airy appeal, and Catt's version enriches ""Paper""'s sonics, adds a zither and melodica, but not much else. This is fine, though; Catt's and Guthrie's underwhelming remixes only prove that Alsace Lorraine don't need tacked-on cameos to flesh out or draw attention to their record; their original work does well enough on their own.","The first Alsace Lorraine record since 2001 features Argentinian vocalist Isol, and the same winsome literary pretension and odd humor of the band's debut.

Ongiara,Great Lake Swimmers,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d95e6ef9596932202e/1:1/w_160/4c1ebc75.jpg,2007-06-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10300-ongiara/,Nettwerk,"Ongiara is named for the vessel the Great Lake Swimmers took to reach their initial recording studio on Toronto Island. But the real gem in this band's acoustics goes deservedly to Aeolian Hall in London, Ontario, where Vieux Farka Touré and dozens of others have performed, and where most of this album was recorded. The effect is, naturally, that of a live performance, which lends some color and depth to an otherwise bland, somnambulant group of songs. Some of the contributions from several seasoned collectivists and soloists, including Owen Pallett's string arrangements, add washes of pleasure-- among them, Mike Bonnell's friendly-sounding organ at the edges of ""Backstage with the Modern Dancers"", or the trickling electric guitar on ""Changing Colours"". But others-- such as the lead banjo on opener ""Your Rocky Spine""-- are ultimately immediately disappointing and distracting. The perpetually slow pace isn't always necessary, either, and ploddingly cliché lyrics like, ""Where the wind takes you/ It takes me too/ When you change colors/ I change colors too"" add to the dearth of faux-folk motifs. Still, ""Colours"" has the pleasant ring of Mazzy Star: The subtle, lilting melody and assumedly natural reverbs are perfectly at home with the grunge aperitifs of the 90s. Like many a competent folk singer, Tony Dekker has a full, warm voice that's perfectly suited to the recording atmosphere and the acoustic guitar, but it would be more enjoyable to see Dekker's vocals paired up with Lewis & Clarke's complex, energetic string arrangements. If there are half a dozen additional instrumentalists on this album, most of the time you can't tell, whereas Lewis & Clarke's small number still manages to sound like a controlled experiment in one guitar's response to nature, and each other instrument's response to it. ""Put There By the Land"" has the body and weight-- with just a few thick bass plucks early on and string pizzicato later-- to provide the shy vivacity the first half of the album could have used, and periodic electric guitar strums show us just the faintest glimmer of rock. ""Land"" also harkens back to sea shanties with pretty repetition from the violin, rather than being feather-light or overly ruminative. Lovers (and players) of the guitar see intricacy in even its most subtle melodic inventions, and the beginning of ""Where in the World Are You"" shows potential. The lyrical narrative is also stronger, and benefits from surprising yet simple rhymes: ""I looked for you up in the tallest of trees/ Swayed back and forth in the mid-autumn breeze/ When the leaves reddened and left too/ I knew then that it wasn't you."" Still, what detracts from this album is just how light it is: It doesn't need anger, darkness, or mania to prop it up, but it does need variety and vivacity, something only tempo changes and more frequent sprinklings of different tones and bolder instrumentation could accomplish.","Canadian acoustic trio's third album gets arrangements from Owen Pallett and help from several other instrumentalists, but its pared down, slowed down tunes make this quite a wash-out.

Can't Wait Another Day,The Ladybug Transistor,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ddea9e61561daa66b6/1:1/w_160/8d0f0c4b.jpg,2007-06-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10304-cant-wait-another-day/,Merge,"Can't Wait Another Day would be easier to love if it didn't keep accidentally signposting a shortage of fresh songwriting ideas. It can't help but feel symbolic when the Ladybug Transistor covers Trader Horne's ""Here Comes the Rain"", if only because the chorus is awfully similar to Jan & Dean's ""Like a Summer Rain""-- a song this band covered a few albums back. Only a pop geek would spend much time noticing that the next track is vaguely in the style of Twinkle's 1964 hit ""Terry"", except that said next track is titled...""Terry"". And you'd never think that the album's second-best track, ""For No Other"", feels a bit like a song called ""Rushes of Pure Spring""-- not unless you'd heard that one on the Ladybug Transistor's second album. Oh, I'm vastly overstating the case: These are dim resemblances, not steals, and the ""Here Comes the Rain"" thing is surely intentional. But they do seem to reinforce the sense of a band that's still sorting out where to head next, not yet nailing it down. They can be forgiven for that, especially after the departure of key member Sasha Bell. This is a figuring-things-out album, just as the vast Ladybug & Friends roster of guest contributions suggests: Even the label's advertising copy calls it ""a promise of good things to come."" The good news is that they'd seem to have their eyes on a new path. A few years after 1999's fantastic The Albemarle Sound, the group's high point of paisley-covered indie pop baroque, they took a few steps back toward rock's middle ground, as if worried that all those stately arrangements and flute breaks were going out of style; it's made them more popular, but less interesting. On this record, they make some firm, decisive gestures toward a new direction: Their usual lush, languorous sound picks up tinges of well-heeled folk and country, and a few big doses of the warm, sentimental Nashville sound Lambchop used to trade in. Bobby Goldsboro gets offered as one potential inspiration, and a listen to his 1968 hit ""Honey""-- lavished with strings, choir, and even theremin-- will explain the connection: Just compare with ""Lord, Don't Pass Me By"", the Ladybug Transistor's grand album closer. (Elsewhere, ""This Old Chase"" sounds, weirdly enough, like Ric Ocasek and the Cars going western.) This sound isn't in the least a bad fit: Singer Gary Olson is one of far too few guys in indie with the kind of rich, liquid baritone that can sell a slow, sad melody. That comes in handy through the rest of this record, too, which feels like a late-breaking, friends-and-all lap through the good old gorgeous: ""For No Other"" in particular is as deep and warm as anything they've ever done. When all those qualities come together with a solid song-- like the beautifully written ""Always on the Telephone""-- it's a real thrill, even before the astounding 80s-styled sax solo. When it comes to staking out a new direction, these are solid results: You can't help but wish them lots of luck in pinning down their new sound, lineup, and working method, especially after the recent death of San Fadyl, one of the more lovable drummers in indie rock. As an album, though, this one feels like a bit of a stall-- a little filler, a little room to breathe, and a little time to make plans. The band's years making friends and fans all through the indie and indie pop worlds mean they've earned enough credit for people to bear with them, and even enjoy their work in progress-- but here's hoping they'll plow their new furrow as fully, uniquely, and single-mindedly as they did with The Albemarle Sound.","The veteran indie pop band releases this Merge album just after the recent death of its drummer, San Fadyl.

Weirdo Rippers,No Age,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fbea9e61561daa66e3/1:1/w_160/611326ad.jpg,2007-06-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10330-weirdo-rippers/,Fat Cat,"Beginning this past March, Los Angeles duo No Age released five impeccably decorated, vinyl-only EPs on five different labels. The blitz coincided with a seemingly endless string of live shows-- the kinds you go home and tell friends about. Not a bad one-two punch. Shattering eardrums in clubs is the most natural way to spread the word about your band, and their records were a smart way to spread a wealth of material while creating colorful collector's items in the process. Weirdo Rippers, an 11-song compilation consisting of highlights from those records, stitches songs together by sound and feel, rather than presenting them chronologically. The songs flow together swimmingly, and despite track-by-track brevity (three songs are under two minutes, three are under three) the group has mastered a low-tech immensity, and the album builds into something much bigger than its constituent parts. Guitarist Randy Randall and singing drummer Dean Spunt nabbed ""No Age"" from the 1987 SST compilation of the same name. The album featured Black Flag, Blind Idiot God, Henry Kaiser, Pell Mell, and others taking a stab at instrumental music-- not a bad historical, aesthetic, or West-Coast linkage. The band's coolly detached, eye-catching design schemes aren't random, either: Randall and Spunt, who were two-thirds of beloved noise-rockers Wives, are firmly entrenched in the L.A. DIY/art scene. They collaborate on visual/performance/video art and are connected to grassroots art space the Smell-- the building on the cover of Weirdo Rippers-- where you can score vegan pancakes, drink orange juice, and get a $5 haircut while watching Silver Daggers bleed the speakers. No Age played their first show there in April. (Continuing with the multi-trasking, Spunt also runs PPM! records, which has put out music by Wives, Mika Miko, KIT, Shoplifting, and John Wiese.) A loud duo with art credibility, a massive touring schedule, and a one-man label in its ranks brings Lightning Bolt to mind; but No Age have a softer surf-psychedelic side that conjures another twosome: old Olympia favorites Kicking Giant. Or, as another Pitchfork staffer pointed out, the best K Records fuzz-rock band of all time, Lync. No Age, though, goes into an even airier, bedroom-pretty realm, with a punk rawness to their delivery. Their oft-chanted hooks (see ""Boy Void"" or ""Every Artist Needs A Tragedy"") are out-of-phase, the approach sloppy and spastic. At the same time, these songs come off soporific, restful, and totally in control. Nothing grates. It all feels soft and up-close. ""I Wanna Sleep"", maybe a mellow response to Harry Pussy's ""I Don't Care About Sleep Anymore"", is a feedback lullaby beneath mellow, chugging guitars. A similar rhythm opens ""My Life's Alright Without You"", which jump-cuts suburban goth to the Dickies' nasal enunciations (""Well, I hate you/ I hate you/ My life's alright without you""), only after a shuffling loop. Every now and again the drums and vocal kick disappear, revealing that trippiness, which never quite goes away. ""Everybody's Down"" (full disclosure: I included it on a CD I recently curated) is the most rousing, kick-ass song I've heard in a while. Opening with brief spate of backwards distortion strands, it shifts to a speedy strum and doubled vocals shouting teen-bleak lyrics that culminate with a poppy shout of angstful communalism: ""Everybody's down/ Every soul in every town/ Everybody's got me going 'oooh ahhh ooh ahh ooh ahh ooh'."" A speedier shout and dust-kicking drum'n'guitar wrap it up with a clatter. Deerhunter's Bradford Cox recently called No Age his favorite new band. Like Cox's crew, Randall and Spunt seem to be creating their own universe. In ""Loosen This Job"", after drum sticks tap out a code and distortion gently floods the room, Spunt asks, ""Why are there so many records in my life?"" Or at least it sounds like that. It's hard to tell. Whether or not that's what he says, or what he means, he's right. Despite an overload of music these days, if often feels like there are fewer essential listens. At the end of Weirdo Rippers, you're left with a rare sense of having discovered something new. Outside just their sound, No Age bring back the DIY energy of Kicking Giant and Lync and '90s zines and, importantly, a life away from computer screens. The songs have thumping heartbeats. Each and every one. All the jangling feedback loops and cymbal submersions in the world can't hide that.","Over the course of five EPs issued on five different labels-- the highlights of which are compiled here-- this Los Angeles duo's mastered a low-tech immensity that allows its songs to seem much bigger than their constituent parts.

Given the hilariously horrified reaction that many in the dance music community have when confronted with the music of French duo Justice, you'd think they were two 300-pound rampaging Huns who sacked Berlin's Panorama Bar and made off with Ricardo Villalobos and Ellen Allien over their shoulders. Instead, Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay-- high school kids when Daft Punk's Homework dropped over a decade ago-- grew up, like many a young Parisian, filtering hard rock (never a French strong suit) through disco until it sounded more Judas Priest circa 1983 than Stardust circa 1998. Their ""new French touch,"" as the genre's being termed, actually feels like the caress of a sledgehammer. Throughout †, Justice's long-awaited debut album, Augé and de Rosnay genuflect again and again in front of the Stations of French Dance Music: The metallic ripples of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's Crydamoure label, which once sizzled your ear hairs; Thomas Bangalter's Roulé imprint, and its champagne kisses and Chaka Khan dreams; the coke-mirror reflections of idealized 80s keyboards in Alan Braxe and Fred Falke's work; the tongue-lolling hip-hop buffoonery of TTC; Mr. Oizo's spritzing-sphincter bass and convulsing keyboards; and Jackson's OCD vocal edits. Listen to the Cassius-esque disco-twang of ""Genesis"" and tell me these guys are somehow dance-ignorant. But like two naughty schoolboys, they've got their fingers crossed behind their backs the whole time; one thing the duo is not is reverent. Justice takes this history of the French rave era and blows it out by embracing 21st-century stadium-rock production. They squeeze everything into a mid-range frequency band so loud that the riffs on tracks like ""Let There Be Light"" and ""Stress"" practically cock-slap you in the face. (""Stress"" in particular sounds like a disco-era string arranger came to an in-house orchestra with the injunction ""make it sound like Emergency Broadcast System."") The drums on ""Let There Be Light"" and their big breakthrough single ""Waters of Nazareth"" are the rat-a-tat rhythms of electro scraping like Freddie Krueger's fingertips along the slimy walls of some basement dungeon. That's it-- engorged electronic riffs, dizzying astringent strings, vocal samples torqued to all hell, and nasty metallic drums. It's astoundingly unsubtle stuff and bracing as fuck, a decade's worth of French electronic music stripped down like a Peugeot parked overnight in a bad neighborhood. Of course, if that's all † was, it would be unbearable for a full hour, and Justice's critics might have half a point. But the album's more varied than most folks will give it credit for. (Unfortunately, that variety also includes ""The Party"", featuring Ed Banger's abhorrent in-house female rapper Uffie.) ""D.A.N.C.E.""-- the album's slightly incongruous, Schoolhouse Rock-esque filter-disco track-- is Justice's only obvious stab at a capital-p pop crossover hit and you'll certainly be humming ""Do the D-A-N-C-E, 1-2-3-4-5"" whether you want to or not after hearing it. But like Homework, † is a harsh and mostly instrumental set that nonetheless plays like the ideal crossover electronic-pop record. Justice knows how to sequence a dance album to avoid drag and boredom, a skill more suited to hook-friendly architects than a putative demolition crew. The wistful instrumental vignette ""Valentine"", coming after the one-two slap of ""Phantom Pt. 1"" and ""Phantom Pt. 2"", is like a sour, palate-cleansing appetizer between fat-rich courses in big ol' French meal. But well-sequenced or not, † is also a sensation-for-sensation's-sake record, something French house has always excelled out-- even when it's been more classy than crass. Cheekily disregarding so many things that good dance music is ""supposed"" to have-- especially, you know, bass-- and in a post-microhouse era where ""quality sound design"" is a fetishistic obsession, Justice's digital distortion, 128kb-grade hyper-compression, and sometimes aggressively un-funky house sprays good taste with its pissed-up, pissed-off 3 a.m. musk. They've somehow managed to split dance music into a brother-against-brother battle, turning message boards into minefields and blog posts into mini-manifestos. There's no mystery to Justice tracks, true. But whether it's deep house revelers out of their heads on jacked-up gospel or folks in German basements getting down to their own form of minimalized riffing, club rats all over the world are just trying to have a good time. Even if Justice is more about throwing devil horns than doing the hustle, well, we're all still in the same gang.","The French duo-- who have received hilariously horrified reactions from some in the dance music community-- take French dance and blows it out by embracing 21st-century stadium-rock production, filtering heavy rock through disco until it sounds more Judas Priest circa 1983 than Stardust circa 1998.

We Can Create,Maps,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cd13d197565213a513/1:1/w_160/d731843f.jpg,2007-06-11 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10291-we-can-create/,Mute,"Until now, the reputation of Northamptonshire home-recorder James Chapman has rested upon a couple of singles, ""Start Something"" b/w ""To the Sky"" and ""Lost My Soul"" b/w ""Sparks in the Snow"". The singles evoked a simpler version of Caribou, with their sorta-hip-hop beats and kinda-psychedelic pop trappings; of M83, with their swooping and unapologetically grand keyboards; and perhaps of the Postal Service, albeit one cured of the hiccups. But because Chapman forewent the use of computers in favor of recording straight to 16-track, the singles lacked the imposing stature of these digitally-inclined touchstones. For all of its luxuriant majesty, Chapman's music sounds somewhat aloof; the tape onto which it was recorded acts as a thin but palpable barrier between the music and the listener. This is not an unpleasant quality; in fact, the analog warmth of Chapman's compositions is among their most charming aspects. As if realizing he'd found a winning formula on these early releases, Chapman opted to make them over and over again to flesh out his debut LP, We Can Create. As a result, the album-- which includes both ""To the Sky"" and ""Lost My Soul""-- contains no real duds, and almost any song on it would make a fine single. Taken together, however, the homogeneity of their construction dilutes their appeal. Track after track drops melodic and tonal variations into the same inflexible stencil-- one that's invariably linear, with a transparent, bar-by-bar approach to dynamic shifts. The drums, in particular, beg for some discrepancy-- virtually the same skittering smack pushes along the surging keyboards on each song. Not that this formula doesn't produce some winners. ""So High, So Low"" is a perfect summertime confection, despite being the most formulaic song on the album-- it is, in fact, transcendently formulaic. Its title aptly summarizes its dynamics-- alternating between a lean, fuzzy synth throb and sweeping, overdriven ahs, its bright pastel contrasts and unforgettable melody elevate it above its peers. ""You Don't Know Her Name"" is almost as good, adhering to the same template in more intricate detail, but by ""Elouise"", with its buzzy synth wash and straightforward churn, one gets the sinking feeling that all else is preordained. The telegraphic urgency of ""It Will Find You"", with its trip-hop density and spaghetti-synths, provides a welcome contrast to the album proper's exaggerated sway, as does the vanishing and beatless ""Glory Verse"". There's a lot to recommend in Chapman's as-the-crow-flies approach to songwriting, but one wishes he'd occasionally slow down and take the scenic route instead.","Full-length debut from Northamptonshire's James Chapman continues with the beat-driven, psyche-tinged bedroom electronica exhibited on earlier singles.

James & the Quiet,Wooden Wand,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05e9d034d5c69bf4872/1:1/w_160/0c461d1c.jpg,2007-06-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10190-james-the-quiet/,Ecstatic Peace,"Two years ago, summer was in full swing, the sun was shining, and James Toth had ten thousand records out. ""It's a fucking epidemic,"" wrote Pitchfork reviewer Brandon Stosuy, before giving Wooden Wand's solo outing Harem of the Sundrum & the Witness Figg the notice it deserved. Toth had departed from his signature improvised collaborations with the Vanishing Voice in order to make a minimal, surprisingly spiritual collection of unadorned songs. Who knew for sure, before Harem, that beneath all the improv and WWVV's mountain-man affectations the group included at least one real songwriter? Harem staggers into the present as one of a few survivors of the plague of forgetfulness than has pretty much sent ""free-folk"" back to the wispy place from whence it came. Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice tapered off soon enough-- though not before releasing the NNCK-jazzed Gipsy Freedom last year-- and according to Toth are pretty much done: after James & the Quiet, he's retiring the Wooden Wand mantle. James is a close cousin to Harem, featuring as it does Toth stripped down. But where Harem, in retrospect, benefited from the rush of creativity Toth was surfing-- its lo-fi unfinished veneer and Shrimper-style tape-distortion had all the hallmarks of a quick in-and-out job-- James & the Quiet is a more deliberate animal. Produced in rich fashion by Lee Ranaldo, who also plays on the record, Toth's new record features comparatively elaborate arrangements built around the same basic guitar and vocal template, and not always for the better. Listen to ""The Pushers"" and hear just how much more he's singing, how focused the mix is on his lyrics and voice. This is a bit strange, given that his writing tends towards the nonlinear and the oblique-- say, the Dylanesque koan of ""mutants and monsters did gather in the mausoleum,"" from ""Invisible Children"". A more favorable Dylan comparison (well, here's third: Toth's voice can be brutal) might apply to the nigh ecstatic ""Spitting at the Cameras"", a slow motion and abstracted ""To Ramona"". ""Spitting"" is raspy and melodic and beautiful. There, as elsewhere, Jessica Toth helps out with the vocals, and her voice is wonderful-- a husky hyper-articulated alto, an even tone skating easily over a whisky-soaked vibrato. James & the Quiet is Toth's attempt at a singular presentation of himself as an artist-- ""an un-weird record,"" in his terms, designed to be music more synonymous with its creator than the wah-wah pedal wash that characterized his output with the Vanishing Voice. Along with ""Spitting"", the mid-record pairing of ""We Must Also Love the Thieves"" and ""Invisible Children"" arrives at this sort of portrait of the artist as back-porch master, playing sing-along songs in all the places you weren't at but wished you had been. As he writes in the latter, ""There's nothing in the light/ Just invisible children we sing to at night."" But a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. The country-cooked minimalism of the drawling ""Blood"", the snake-charmer sleaze of ""In A Bucket"", the adjective-plagued ""Blessed Damnation"" (e.g., ""The residue of collegiate superstitions will not be removed/ So you take your own gristle-caked notions for a walk in a dream"")-- it all starts to feel like somebody sticking their tongue into your ear. The fastidiousness of the sound on James, and the heavy emphasis on the artist at the other end of the speaker, can be a trap for Toth. In 2005, the distant production and spontaneous aesthetic of Harem of the Sundrum & the Witness Figg held a lot of this discomfort at bay, even it if it cost Toth some notice. Maybe now he's overcompensating?","James Toth's supposed final record under the Wooden Wand mantle is a stripped-down and song-based companion to 2005's Harem of the Sundrum & the Witness Figg.

Soft Punk,John Wiese,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a95e6ef95969321fe2/1:1/w_160/94671f6b.gif,2007-06-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10257-soft-punk/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Soft Punk is the first full-length album released by California harsh noise and parasympathetic drone aesthete John Wiese on New Jersey's Troubleman Unlimited, an eager imprint that's been treading the turbulent waters between sonic abstraction and punk aggression for a decade. Through TMU's small-batch/good-records approach, bands like Growing and Double Leopards share shelves with Meneguar and Panthers (not to mention Glass Candy, Tussle and The Walkmen), meeting somewhere near the fuck-all eruptions of Wolf Eyes and now in the careful and meticulous, feverish and intoxicating noise of Wiese. Recorded between 2002 and 2005, Soft Punk is a zenithal intersection of everything Wiese has done right for the past decade: Collagist tendencies meet drone hyper-abilities; assaulting glitches and glissandos come buried between near silence and hair-raising volume; beauty is refracted through sonic brutality. The title Soft Punk seems to have two functions, then: Like its brilliant cover art by Kaz Oshiro-- three bright pink Marshall amplifiers that are, as the back cover shows, simply stretched-canvas, three-dimensional paintings of such fantasy gear-- Soft Punk suggests looking and listening again, of rethinking that ugly noise/punk divide. Just when you think you have a handle on Wiese, he's onto something else. There's always a next level here. No, this isn't punk, and it's not soft. But it's not simple sheets of harsh noise, either. Wiese's constant push and pull and his eventual acquiescence to let things build and burn are capable of rock's epiphany and articulation, even if it's ""just a bunch of god damned noise"" in the end. Soft Punk is a statement of process, too. Under the name Sissy Spacek-- which he uses for both solo work and collaborations-- Wiese manipulates and processes his own recordings and spews them back as ultra-damaged, something-like-punk, more-like-noise spasms. Here, he's sampling his punk rock friends again, stacking those sounds-- crowd cheers, drum rolls, drumstick counts-- on top and inside of his own. During ""Snow Pit"", Wiese concentrates on snippets from Olympia trio Die Monitor Bats, using a live set's beginnings, ends, and screaming innards as heavy construction paper and bright crayons. He drops drumstick counts into the mix four times, sprinting in wildly different directions after each. It's either ""One, two, three, four, NEAR SILENCE"" or ""One, two, three four, OH SHIT! LOUD!"" Take your chances, sucker. Much like Japanese electronic composer Ryoji Ikeda, Wiese excels in making clean, precise cuts between drastically different sounds, building a drop-dead dynamic capable of stepping from almost-absent rumbles and hums to furious noise bursts. This is apparent on ""PS2"", where Wiese uses bait-and-switch, build-and-kill mechanics as his chief compositional tool. He buries valleys into peaks and somehow finds peaks that are higher and more rugged with uncanny persistence. A machine-gun rhythm reverses into a glitchy spasm, then settles into a pressurized monotone before ducking into near-nothingness. None of these sounds lasts for more than three seconds, but such vacillations never seem rushed with Wiese. He's always in control, the master of a sonic domain that reaches far-and-wide, high-and-low with enthusiasm and magnetism. It's as though he collects a world of sound and spits it out piecemeal-- methodically, dramatically, emphatically-- through a morphing matrix designed for ricochets. Falling in love with a sliver of sound only to be slapped senselessly by something totally unrelated? It's as maddening as it is exhilarating. But the proof is in Soft Punk's center: During a three-track, mid-album stretch, Wiese eases into a neon pink drone, a beautiful sound that he just won't leave alone. He bends and shocks it, reshapes it, piles drums on top of it, overdrives it, and eventually altogether destroys it. When the track expires with a blitz of malformed waves, Wiese builds a perfect, long-tone aubade reminiscent of Jason Lescalleet's work on ""The Pilgrim"". For those who haven't heard it, ""The Pilgrim"" was Lescalleet's gorgeous 74-minute farewell to his deceased father, all gentle tones fanfaring gradually into outer space. For three minutes, Wiese sings a similar sigh, perhaps letting the body of the punk rock he's setting on fire burn away at the midpoint. And then, as he should, Wiese thrusts all of his weight into ""New Wave Dust"", perhaps the album's most chaotic, relentless, damaging track. Power electronics? Oh my. Punk rock? If only.","Harsh noise figurehead builds new tracks by sampling punk rock recordings-- crowd cheers, drum rolls, drumstick counts-- and inserting them on top and inside of his own.

Version,Mark Ronson,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d8c0084474cd0c1d05/1:1/w_160/76ea7f06.jpg,2007-06-11 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10299-version/,Columbia,"I'm sure Mark Ronson's a real talented DJ, a kickass producer, and a formidable music connoisseur, with or without the rock'n'roll silver spoon inherited from his step-daddy, Foreigner co-founder Mick Jones. Hell, even his block party of a debut, 2003's star-studded Here Comes the Fuzz, had its share of interesting musical ideas. However, it's hard to look at Version-- a guest artist-boosted showcase that comes on the heels of Ronson's production work for Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse-- as anything but a cash-grab. Not that cover albums can't be eclectic, but there's little-to-no coherence between the songs chosen here except for the fact that the artists who wrote them are UK chart mainstays. While song selection seems suspect on Version, it's not the deal-breaker. Ronson is a phenomenal multi-instrumentalist, but someone's gotta cut him off at a certain number of horn and string sections. For example, hearing a moody, standoffish anthem like the Smiths' ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"" (its presence here a cheeky nod to critics who'd call this entire album superfluous) get dusted off and given the Pygmalion treatment smacks of indie blasphemy, the canned strings and Daniel Merriweather's schmaltzy croon clumsily converting Morrissey into a blaxploitation theme. To Ronson's credit, what should be the most egregious track on the album, a cover of Radiohead's ""Just"", is actually a standout. Nicked from last year's abysmal Radiohead tribute album Exit Music: Songs With Radio Heads [review], the track finds Phantom Planet's Alex Greenwald adding a playful dose of white-boy funk, and is one of the few instances where Ronson's hip-hop proclivities come in handy. Still, slapping a brand new bag on these pasty-white-dude tunes more often bombs than not. Maxïmo Park's ""Apply Some Pressure""-- re-interpreted here with help from MP singer Paul Smith-- loses its jagged post-punk edge amidst the lush horns and thin symphonic outro, and the Zutons' ""Valerie"" gets mauled by Amy Winehouse, bent and twisted until it sounds like a spare part of ""Rehab"". What this all boils down to is that Ronson probably would've been better off remixing these songs than dolling them up with droves of big-name mercenaries and genre-fucking. Most of Version's tracks have little replay value, shaking your attention before you can say, ""So that's what 'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' would sound like played by a high school marching band."" And of course, a handful of the originals just weren't that great to begin with. Maybe I'm giving Ronson more credit than he deserves, but the guy's too talented to smash square pegs into readymade round holes and abet the ongoing implosion of pop music as we know it.","The hip-hop/nu-soul producer who played a large role in recent albums by Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse enlists some famous friends for a covers album that includes takes on songs by Radiohead, the Smiths, and Coldplay, among others.

Era Vulgaris,Queens of the Stone Age,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f813d197565213a559/1:1/w_160/01ea1214.jpg,2007-06-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10327-era-vulgaris/,Interscope,"It may seem cheap to bring up the departure of Nick Oliveri three years and two albums after he was fired from Queens of the Stone Age, but the more I listen to Era Vulgaris, the more I think his presence is sorely missed. I'm not advocating the guy's return, but the tradeoff between Josh Homme's reserved cool and Olivieri's crazy-go-nuts screaming was one of the group's strengths in their heyday; years later, someone for Homme to play off would still be a welcome addition to the band. Queens of the Stone Age has been mostly Homme's show ever since, and it's been a mixed bag so far. Lullabies to Paralyze was quality, a chance for QOTSA v2.0 to retrench and carve out their own niche, even if those who were less enamored with the album's glowering charms, saw that niche as a rut-- an example of what Oliveri's loss actually meant to the group. If Era Vulgaris is any indication, the group felt the same way: This album tries its best to be everything all at once (often within one track), and in attempting to cover too much ground, the band loses focus and direction. It's not so much that the songs themselves are weak, just that many of the choices made in them are. For instance, ""Sick, Sick, Sick"" would be better off simply sticking with Homme's motor-mouthed singing and riffing; instead, the song bellyflops into a flat chorus where everyone sings like they're scared of their own voices. (Since the Strokes' Julian Casablancas guests on this song, let's blame him. Why not?) Elsewhere, Homme spreads his falsetto all over ""Misfit Love"", where it'd be more effective in shorter bursts, while the obnoxious bridge on album closer ""Run Pig Run"" (it pops up twice!) kills any chance it might've had for worthy inclusion on a future edition of Guitar Hero. (Note to Activision: I am totally cool with requisite QOTSA singles ""No One Knows"" or ""3's and 7's"" bringing the rock fury and carpal tunnel.) The most enjoyable moments on Era Vulgaris come when the band treads off the beaten path. One of the album's standout tracks, ""Make It Wit Chu"", is a straight-forward blues-rock number plucked from the last Desert Sessions disc.  And the album's gentler digressions, like the guitar-weeping ""Into the Hollow"" and the mournful ""Suture Up Your Future"", reveal Homme has a surprisingly palatable softer side. ""Turning on the Screw"" and ""I'm Designer"" aren't exactly groundbreaking departures from the QOTSA's usual fare, but Homme's lyrical bent adds an interesting wrinkle. No one's going to confuse him with Bob Dylan any time this century, but you could put much worse in your mouth than lines like, ""My generation's for sale/ Beats a steady job/ How much have you got?"" or, ""You can't lose it if you never had it/ Disappear man, do some magic."" It's at points like these when Era Vulgaris truly comes to life. Unfortunately for listeners, those moments are few and far between, leaving fans to trudge back to older Queens records for the fix they crave.","Josh Homme and co. follow their first post-Nick Oliveri album-- the quality Lullabies to Paralyze-- with a more diverse record, one that tries its best to be everything all at once, often within one track.

Imperious Delirium,The Saints,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c613d197565213a504/1:1/w_160/14101b1d.jpg,2007-06-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10284-imperious-delirium/,Wildflower,"The Saints were the first breakout stars from Australia's simmering late 1970s punk scene. They were also one of the first to come to the conclusion that punk just wasn't enough. Following 1977's monster ""(I'm) Stranded"", the Saints branched out with ""Eternally Yours"", soon going even further afield with ""Prehistoric Sounds"". Casual fans checked out, and soon so did co-leader Ed Kuepper, leaving partner Chris Bailey to carry on with the Saints name. The recent reunion of fellow Aussie pioneers Radio Birdman has somewhat overshadowed the continued output of the Saints, which aside from the very rare reunion with his old bandmates remains Bailey and whomever he calls his bandmates. As recently as 2005 that included Martin Wilson-Piper of the Church, but with Imperious Delirium the Saints are down to a trio. Still, Bailey is at the helm, and he plays all the guitars, so it's a Saints record. Close enough, right? It's to both the band's credit and detriment that Imperious Delirium could have been released at nearly any time in the last 30 years by nearly any neo-punk guitar band from that span. Of course, the Saints aren't just any band, and this is 2007, not 1977. So how much of the Saints legacy should be taken into account when assessing the record? On its face, Imperious Delirium sounds like a promising, above-average demo, muddy sound and all. It's more than listenable if totally unexceptional stuff. But if it weren't by the Saints, would we be listening at all? And if it had come from the Saints circa '77, would be still be listening to it today? Probably not. If anything, the album hearkens back to the days just before punk, when garage and pub rock ruled the underground and bands like the Stooges, MC5 and later the New York Dolls bridged the gap between rote riffage and something louder, faster, leaner and meaner. Ironically, for a band with so much history and now a whopping 13 albums to its name, the Saints here sounds like they're just getting their feet wet, readying themselves for a revolution yet to come. It's the most retro of retro stances, and the results are predictably modest. ""Other Side of the World"" could be a nice forgotten Johnny Thunders ballad, while ""So Close,"" ""Je Fuckin' T'Aime"", and ""Drowning"" sound like little not-quite classic garage nuggets/Nuggets. When Bailey gets poppy, as he does with ""Getting Away With Murder"", ""Learning to Crawl"", and ""War of Independence"" you can hear a bit of Tom Verlaine in his writing, or at least Television aficionado Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate. It's fun but spotty stuff, and ultimately less than impressively mundane. What's missing is any real sense of inspiration or imperative, any compelling reason for it to exist outside of extending a legacy that many would argue ended at the dawn of the 80s. Change the name, or change the direction, but a legendary band in name alone does the legend no favors.","The venerable, apparently indestructible Australian punk band has never really gone away, but it returns again all the same to show that it's not really going anywhere, either.

Ice Station,The Race,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c713d197565213a506/1:1/w_160/d8fb8aec.jpg,2007-06-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10285-ice-station/,Flameshovel,"Chicago's the Race split up in 2004, the result of the buzz-killing intrusions that have prematurely ceased so many other young bands: personality conflicts and a lack of money. Singer and songwriter Craig Klein took that misfortune as an opportunity to redouble his songwriting efforts, however, augmenting them with the sort of historical research made possible by his day job at the Chicago Public Library. A couple of years later, he emerges with Ice Station, a concept album about an imagined trip from Siberia to China and back again. Like any travelogue worth undertaking, Ice Station concerns itself not as much with the destination as the process of reaching it, and each song is a keenly crafted and ingratiating set piece documenting an imagined journey. Much of the record's crystalline desolation is no doubt due to Klein's collaborator Joshua Eustis, previously known for his sharp, electronic dissonance with Telefon Tel Aviv. Here, the guitars purr robotically, the drums are as flat and unforgiving as the white tundra, and Klein's voice resonates like a warm radio signal. Echoes of dark, pliable post-punk bass appear frequently, as does the lonesome electro-gloom of Casiotone for the Painfully Alone and the understated eccentricity of early Pinback, but Klein's work here is set apart by its clean, simple approach to moody expressionism. The record abounds with the sort of spaciousness and clarity that come from an all-too-rare effective translation of environment to music, and its vague narrative of adventure and romance is impressively heightened with a keen ear toward the forcefulness of big, dramatic moments. ""The Shortest Way to China"" opens with a guitar tightly wound into a thin screech, before giving way to a towering chorus. ""Ice Station"" complements its bassline, which rumbles like an icebreaker engine, with clipped puffs of breath and the spectral repetition of ""Ulan Bator"", the Mongolian capital that doubles as a steady vamp. ""Odessa"" is a cantering road fable about a journey to the titular city, and Klein's weary, melismatic vocals on ""A Kind of Solution"" feel like an exhausted plea to a long-lost lover. Throughout Ice Station, the sense of cinema is palpable; Klein and Eustis' music seems designed to aurally evoke elements David Lean's panaoramic stoicism, the glimmering dystopia of Blade Runner, and Robert Flaherty's lonesome minutae. If the record has a fault, it's that its last quarter relaxes a bit too much, gliding to a gradual conclusion instead of going out with a bang. But it's a minor quibble-its best quality is Klein's ability to make restraint sound fresh and vibrant, and it offers evidence that his own isolation, digging through stacks of dusty reference books, helped immeasurably to create Ice Station's ingratiating sense of frozen solitude.","The Chicago band's first effort since 2004, essentially a collaboration between Craig Klein and Telefon Tel Aviv's Joshua Eustis, is a taut, widescreen narrative of a journey from Siberia to China.

"Split Lips, Winning Hips, a Shiner",Shapes and Sizes,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d69d034d5c69bf4928/1:1/w_160/83c6b2c7.jpg,2007-06-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10298-split-lips-winning-hips-a-shiner/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Shapes and Sizes carried a heavy but unlikely burden on their self-titled debut album: They had too many melodies, and their best ones were lost in the bustle. Each song set off in numerous directions, leaving the listener with that muddled feeling of flipping through too many channels, opening too many IM windows, or leaving bookmarks in too many books. The eight months between their debut and Split Lips, Winning Hips, a Shiner has given Shapes and Sizes time to streamline their songs, hone in on the best parts of their jumbled structures, and embellish those parts with engaging instrumentation, dynamic vocals, and smart lyrics. The stylistic shifts are still here-- they're just less jarring now-- and on the whole, the band seems to be paying closer attention to songcraft. From leadoff track ""Alone/Alive"", it's apparent that keyboardist and co-vocalist Caila Thompson-Hannant has improved as a singer: She deftly navigates loud/soft, elated/depressed dynamics, and not just on this song. And while the boasts and hyperbole of their self-titled LP are still present, Thompson-Hannant tempers her shouts with whispers and moans, all of which melds beautifully with the blustery chaos and slight dissonance that colors the opener. What makes Split Lips rise above similar albums is its ability to inflate small portions of songs into mini-showcases for, say, a few great bars of percussion (""Head Movin'""), gameshow synths (""Geese""), or pubescent cracks, shrieks, and hisses (""Can't Stop That (Sinking) Feeling""). That amplification comes in handy on ""The Taste in My Mouth"": Slower, shorter, and more mournful than most S&S songs, its verses hint at domestic abuse and self-mutilation. Elegiac trumpets and a nervous tick on a single guitar string add to the tension. ""I'll suck my fingers until they're dry and numb/ And all the pain is in the taste in my mouth,"" Thompson-Hannant whispers meticulously, as if she's prepared to catch her words between her lips before they escape. Guitarist and co-vocalist Rory Seydel still plays the straight man to his female counterpart's brashness. However, in ""Can't Stop That (Sinking) Feeling"", he briefly breaks free from his indie rock grumble: During the song's Sea and Cake-esque guitar progression, he repeats ""As I grow old!"" until Thompson-Hannant enters, backing up his anguish. Their frequent vocal interplay, combined with their loss-of-innocence lyrics, could get them mistaken for Rainer Maria. But Shapes and Sizes aren't all heart-on-sleeve declarations; they balance every weighty proclamation with humor, and-- imagine-- actually sound like they're having fun. In fact, most songs here travel a range of emotions, but sadly some are sketches that could have been tacked onto other songs or relegated to B-Sides and tour EPs . ""Grassy Corner, a Sunset"" and ""Canvas Skies, Muslin Trees"", both ramblers, share so much but add up to so little. These missteps pass quickly, though. For the most part, Split Lips is a statement of newfound confidence that finds Shapes and Sizes growing without sacrificing their infectious, guileless innocence. Each repeat listen reveals new tunnels through the band's complex of melody and sound, and each turn feels new and untrodden.","Eight months after issuing their self-titled debut, the Asthmatic Kitty band has streamlined their songs, honed in on the best parts of their jumbled structures, and elaborated those sections with engaging instrumentation, dynamic vocals, and smart lyrics.

Arms Down,Get Him Eat Him,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ebc0084474cd0c1d22/1:1/w_160/228a5931.jpg,2007-06-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10317-arms-down/,Absolutely Kosher,"Beyond harping on the fact that the lead singer of Get Him Eat Him can be emailed directly through this website, a recurring thread in reviews for the band's 2005 debut, Geography Cones, was the album's myriad 90s-vintage indie rock influences. But what saves the Providence-bred quintet from being a mere exercise in college-radio nostalgia is that the sort of endearingly fidgety indie rock Get Him Eat Him deal in never really went out of fashion-- it just got its shit together and decided not let amateurism get in the way of ambition. Even in brief two-minute bursts, Geography Cones displayed no lack of grandeur, combining the sensitive melodicism that was intrinsic to so much 90s bedroom-rock with synth-heavy, progged-out arrangements. On Arms Down, that nervous energy matures into confidence. The first words frontman Matt LeMay utters on opener ""2x2"" are, ""It's a familiar sound/ We're under attack,"" perhaps a knowing nod to its place in the canon of underachiever fight songs. But for Get Him Eat Him, resignation is best combated with celebration. The enemies ""beating [them] back"" are unidentified, but that's immaterial-- as ""2x2"" illustrates, the best part about going to war is getting to write your own cavalry song, and they've got guest trumpeter Zach Condon on hand to give it the coup de brass. Condon is but one of the special guests (the Wrens' Charles Bissell and occasional Broken Social Scene keyboardist Chris Brown among them) who lend Arms Down an expanse and emotional release that its predecessor sometimes lacked, whether because it had a more modest production budget or its oversaturated synth arrangements verged on schticky. Credit producer Jason Cadell (ex-Dismemberment Plan) for encouraging the band's art-pop fancies without buffing the jagged edges-- for all the horn charts and dense keyboard textures, you never lose the sense that these songs would sound just as good in a drunken, sweaty basement gig on campus. It's tempting to gauge the influence of LeMay's writing career on his music, but, what the hell, I'll give in: Arms Down's front-loaded sequence and tightly stuffed, multi-sectional song structures sound like the logical products of someone who's spent many a day sifting through stacks of unknown bands' CDs, plopping them on his stereo, and praying he won't be bored. To that end, Get Him Eat Him waste no time in seizing your attention: ""Diminutive"" manages to shift gears from urgent soul stomper to swooning, string-swept balladry with a remarkable ease worthy of Ted Leo; ""Push and Pull"" is a melancholic power-pop surge that, with the sudden intrusion of some piercing guitar tones, takes a sharp left turn out of the second verse and careens off the rails. Elsewhere, LeMay's GBV jones manifests itself in a pair of beauties: the gleaming, Under the Bushes-style ballad ""The Coronation Show"" and ace Do the Collapse-era rocker ""Leaders in Doubt"". But as so many indie pop bands have learned, it's an exuberance that's difficult to sustain for the full duration of an album, even one that clocks in under 40 minutes. In its closing stretch, Arms Down settles into a comfort zone of sorts: The unpredictability of the songs' constantly changing structures starts to feel predictable in itself, and the unwavering sensitivity of LeMay's voice has the effect of making post-punky jangle-pop turns like ""CBT"" and ""Get Down!"" sound more uniform than they actually are. If Get Him Eat Him eventually succumb to battle fatigue, the effectiveness of their opening strikes is proof enough that their efforts were not in vain.","Matt LeMay and co. again touch upon 90s-vintage indie rock influences on their second Absolutely Kosher release.

The Singles,The Clash,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b8c0084474cd0bfc3e/1:1/w_160/cd31dc69.jpg,2007-06-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10313-the-singles/,Epic,"Only an enterprise as fucked as the record business could, or would, consistently wring new material out of permanently defunct outfits-- labels of all sizes continue scrambling for new (and sometimes appalling) ways to re-package, remaster, reissue, re-release, and re-squeeze artist catalogs dry-- and then some. The heartbreaking part is that sometimes all that industry hustle yields devastating results: Last November, Sony released a 19xCD box set of the Clash's 19 U.S.- and UK-charted singles from 1977 to 1985, complete with B-sides, promotional bits, accompanying 12"" mixes, and the Capital Radio EP (which was originally given away with copies of the NME, and previously unavailable commercially, although the Clash fan club did reissue the collection in 1977). With more than 60 tracks (laid onto endearing faux-vinyl compact discs, each with paper liners), the box was a sentimental and aesthetic triumph. But in pragmatic terms, it was also vaguely infuriating: To listen to the entire collection, you'd have to change CDs 19 times, or more likely, waste half an evening loading all the discs onto your computer and constructing your own playlist. Plus, it cost $80. Now, ostensibly on occasion of the band's 30-year anniversary, The Singles box set has been squished onto one reasonably-priced long-playing disc, the 20-track The Singles: Included are all 18 A-sides from the box (no Capital Radio), plus ""Train in Vain"" (the ""secret"" song-- and U.S. hit single-- tucked at the end of 1979's seminal * London Calling*) and ""Groovy Times"", a U.S.-only promo single that was also included on The Cost of Living, a four-song UK EP released in 1979. The Clash wrote loads of political songs, and Joe Strummer's extracurricular sermonizing only inflated the band's finger-wagging rep. But Clash records were never didactic, cold, or patronizing-- The Singles is high proof that the group (unlike other equally-adept, equally-great political songwriters) were actually a killer party band. Try broadcasting The Singles from top to bottom without sneering, pogo-ing, fist-pumping, spitting, high-kicking, shoulder-popping, disco-shimmying, or punching yourself in the thigh at least once. Try not adding in your own background howls; try not screaming ""Thinks it's not kosher!"" out an open window, collapsing onto the couch, then returning to holler, ""This is a public service announcement… with guitars!"" Clearly, the triumph here is not so much the assembling of these tracks (these file-swapping times mean scoring rare cuts is less a victory than a banality), but the reminder that, after all the mythologizing and eulogizing, the Clash were a band who released a mess of mind-blowing singles. The songs seem to be organized in order of notoriety (starting with ""London Calling"" and ending with ""White Riot""), and unsurprisingly, it's the oft-forgotten middle songs that sound the best right now. 1980's ""Bankrobber"" is slathered with tin-can echo, so much so that Mick Jones' backing vocals sound as if they're bring transmitted from space. Fold in a handful of weird bass effects, and it starts to sound like the whole thing was written and realized underwater, in zero gravity. The notion that the song is actually about a kid whose dad robs banks because he doesn't feel like getting a real job suddenly seems irrelevant. 1978's ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"" is equally surreal-- arguably the Clash's first successful experiment with reggae, and written when Strummer was bummed about staying up all night for a crappy reggae showcase (""Midnight to six man/ For the first time from Jamaica/ Dillinger and Leroy Smart/ Delroy Wilson, you cool operator"") at London's Hammersmith Palais, ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"" manages to indict power-pop, shoddy reggae, and neo-Nazism in one four-minute span. Strummer was openly pissed about the show's Four Tops-style geniality (""but onstage they ain't got no roots-rock rebel""), but ""Palais"" is plenty friendly itself, featuring a classic, singalong pop melody. Likewise, ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Know Your Rights"", and ""Clash City Rockers"" are all timeless, addictive romps. As intellectual as the Clash may have seemed to some, their songs were always more ecstatic than enraged. Ultimately, the Clash endure because they inspire.","Marking the band's 30-year anniversary, last year's 19xCD The Singles box set has now been squished onto one reasonably-priced, 20-track long-playing disc.

Cold Summer,Young Jeezy Presents USDA,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c4c0084474cd0c1ceb/1:1/w_160/cb0f7e55.jpg,2007-06-07 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10282-cold-summer/,Def Jam,"Young Jeezy isn't much of a rapper, at least as far as that term is traditionally understood. Instead, his appeal rests on three pillars: his overdriven Tony Robbins motivational-speaker rhetoric, his usually-multitracked slow-motion groan, and the churning, monolithic doom-rap production style pioneered by frequent collaborator Shawty Redd. Those three selling-points don't look like much on paper, but they were enough to make for two compulsively listenable albums. Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 and The Inspiration both shifted more than a million copies in a period when albums aren't selling well at all, and they did it on the strength of the triumphantly larger-than-life persona that Jeezy's created for himself. When those three pillars come together right, Jeezy sounds enormous. Without them, he'd be nothing, and that's why you never hear him on tracks that don't match his singular aesthetic. But Cold Summer, the new album from Jeezy's group USDA, mostly does away with the sweeping production and the success-above-all exhortations. When Jeezy is alongside compatriots Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, he loses his emotional strive, instead bullshitting about the day-to-day minutia of drug-dealing. And the production mostly comes from relatively anonymous and untested unknowns, all doing their best to approximate Shawty Redd's titanic lurch and only occasionally succeeding. As for Jeezy's voice, it takes up a whole lot less space, leaving room for his less distinctive friends. And still Def Jam released Cold Summer, and it debuted in Billboard's top five, selling nearly 100,000 copies in its first week. Young Jeezy is good at what he does. The album has a few bright spots. The regal horns of opener ""Focus"" animate the song's trap-rap cliches. ""Check"" boasts disorienting waves of swarming synths and a Bloodraw chorus that actually works. ""Live My Life"", with its shimmering acoustic guitars and its warm, slow glide of a chorus from Outkast-affiliated crooner Scar, is genuinely pretty. But most of the tracks here sound chintzy and samey, their bargain-basement beats melting into a tedious lump and bottoming out with a remarkably unseductive troika of sex-songs at the middle of the album. We've been hearing a lot of these entourage albums lately, but most of them have been coming out on Koch, an indie-label apparently willing to release music from the crews of B-list rappers like Slim Thug and B.G. I can't for the life of me figure out why Def Jam, still the most important rap label in existence, would take a flier on the two jokers who stand next to Jeezy onstage, and maybe it's telling that the resulting record sounds for all the world like a Koch product. The single best moment on Cold Summer comes at the end of the album: the remix of The Inspiration single ""Go Getta"", which features strong and memorable guest appearances from Bun B and Jadakiss. Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, appropriately enough, are nowhere to be found.","The new record from Young Jeezy's group mostly does away with the sweeping production and the success-above-all exhortations of Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 and The Inspiration.

Bad Blood in the City: The Piety Street Sessions,James Blood Ulmer,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c513d197565213a502/1:1/w_160/ca06843c.jpg,2007-06-07 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10283-bad-blood-in-the-city-the-piety-street-sessions/,Hyena,"The blues may be the most mutable-- and mutated-- form of pop music of the past 100 years, but pity the poor musician who actually tries to push its boundaries. While Eric Clapton and John Mayer reap untold fortunes toeing the middle, the most interesting variations of the blues often go marginalized as edgy niche offerings. Veer too far from tradition and you're likely to be considered separate from that tradition entirely. To be fair, James Blood Ulmer is a bluesman only in the sense that Ulmer's onetime mentor Ornette Coleman is a bluesman. Yes, the blues is there, but such reductionism only captures part of the picture. Indeed, Ulmer's always been predisposed to Coleman's harmolodic theory of rhythmic convergence, especially as applied to jazz and funk, and though the blues isn't typically busy enough to take total advantage of Coleman's pioneering crosscurrents, Ulmer's been working overtime all the same to mesh his divergent influences. He's been on a roll, too, embracing a brand of far from smooth blues with newfound vigor. 2001's Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions teamed Ulmer with guitarist/producer Vernon Reid (of Living Colour fame), and the chemistry was perfect; one shouldn't forget Reid cut his teeth with former Ulmer and former Coleman bandmate/fellow harmolodic traveler Ronald Shannon Jackson. With Ulmer at his best using the blues as a jumping off point for his trademark jagged solos, often delivered in tandem with Reid's distinctly less-traditional playing, 2003 saw the arrival of No Escape from the Blues: The Electric Lady Sessions, which kept the train a-rollin', as it were, summoning equal parts Hendrix and Howlin' Wolf. 2005's beautiful, haunting solo venture Birthright aside, Bad Blood in the City: The Piety Street Sessions, continues Ulmer's electric odyssey with a handful of original compositions supplementing some choice covers, simultaneously platforms for social criticism and launching pads for some colliding guitar duels. Once again, Reid produced the album, and once again Ulmer chose a historic studio to set the mood: From Sun to Electric Lady and now to New Orleans' Piety Street. The setting is wholly appropriate, as few cities have earned to right to own the blues in the 21st century as obviously as New Orleans has. The city's rife with heartache and heartbreak, teetering in purgatory on the brink between urban revival and ghost town. Needless to say, Ulmer's got hurricanes and floods on the mind, too, and the album begins with the Ulmer original ""Survivors of the Hurricane"". Coming off the spare but hardly subdued Birthright, the slamming New Orleans funk and searing electric guitar comes as something of a shock, but a welcome shock at that. This isn't the mournful blues but its angry, riled-up cousin, and the killer playing reflects that. On Junior Kimbrough's ""Sad Days, Lonely Nights"", Ulmer sings like he's been gargling paint thinner, while his band (including Reid on banjo and guitar, and longtime compadre Charles Burnham on violin and mandolin) provides the perfect complements of swinging rhythm and steady pulse. ""Katrina"" is slightly more somber, though far from toothless, yet ""Let's Talk About Jesus"" (featuring singer Irene Datcher) is a more optimistic hunk of gospel-soul, a wash of wah-wah guitars, dancing percussion and Hammond organ bouncing off one another while Ulmer preaches the Christian ethic of charity that seems to have left New Orleans behind. In terms of tribute, Ulmer hits up all the big names-- John Lee Hooker's ""This Land is Nobody's Land"", Willie Dixon's cynical ""Dead Presidents"", Howlin' Wolf's ""Commit a Crime"", and Son House's ""Grinnin' in Your Face""-- but recontextualizes them to fit the album's theme of hard times Crescent City rebirth. ""This is a burial ground, and I don't know why,"" Ulmer singers in the voodooed-up ""This Land Is Nobody's Land"", but one suspects Ulmer knows the answer. In fact, it may even have something to do with those dead presidents. After this salvo, Ulmer may be preaching to the converted when he sings ""There Is Power in the Blues"", though he chooses to end the album on a more accusatory note with ""Old Slave Master"", which lists the Katrina aftermath as just the latest in the long line of wrongs that have trapped millions of Americans in seemingly unchangeable circumstances. It's an astute and natural way to underscore the blues as a living thing, not just the sum of its traditions, still mutating and moving forward to encompass whatever it encounters. From the sound of things, we shouldn't count Ulmer as one of the trapped.","Jazz/funk pioneer James Blood Ulmer continues his exploration of the blues, with an emphasis on the state of New Orleans and guitar/production help from Vernon Reid.

Lightning Dust,Lightning Dust,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bfb1335d7bf169a18b/1:1/w_160/4f93d368.jpg,2007-06-07 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10278-lightning-dust/,Jagjaguwar,"Bummer alert! For those half-to-fully-baked music fans who gloriously tripped on Mr. Stephen McBean's wild retro-rock ride, Black Mountain, don't go expecting a similar buzz from sobering side project Lightning Dust. Sure, they sound like they're named after a volatile drug combination (PCP and pop rocks?), but as Lightning Dust, Black Mountaineers Amber Webber and Joshua Wells seek better living through histrionics, not chemistry. Fortunately, they didn't also kick their awesomely nasty late 60s/early 70s rock habit, making their self-titled debut just as potent a blast from the past as their full-time band. Webber's dour vocals attracted some criticism on Black Mountain, and in the context of that free-wheelin' album, the gripes are somewhat fair. However, with opening track ""Listening On"", Webber and Wells make no bones about the pall cast over their new incarnation. Like nearly every track on the LP, you can count the total instrument and vocal parts on one hand, a compositional illusion that seems to catapult Webber's stark quivering wails out of your speakers. Even ghostlier, the absence of percussion and other auxiliary touches helps to create ephemeral melodies that materialize briefly, only to vanish at the delicate touch of an organ key. As sparse as the duo's toolbox appears, their album has a pronounced dramatic landscape of suspenseful highs and tranquilized lows, thanks both to Webber's powerful emoting and Wells' ivory-tickling flair. ""Castles and Caves"", the album's five-and-a-half minute centerpiece, consists only of piano, vocals and a brief cello part, but when those left-hand keys are pounded during the final chorus, they pack the gravitas of a full-blown orchestra. It doesn't hurt that the piano riff lifts King Crimson's ""In the Court of the Crimson King"", though, as so many Black Mountain reviews point out in nauseating detail, these guys clearly aren't afraid of walking the line between artistic gesturing and flat-out mimicry. However, while very transparent influences sometimes hamper Black Mountain's music, Lightning Dust racks up a much smaller tab borrowing classic rock ideas. Instead, sheer paucity, a typical symptom of side projects, plagues the duo. With ten tracks clocking just over a half-hour, the debut whets the palette but fails to satiate the stomach, instead leaving us with brief, majestic tracks that hint at something more epic. Although catchy, haunting three-minute howls like ""Highway"" or ""Breathe"" come as second nature to the duo, their attempts at curveballs and changeups miss the mark, as drab hoedown ""Wind Me Up"" and gooey FM ballad ""When You Go"" respectively show. Still, when these two stick to their comfort zone, they make magic happen, proving Lightning Dust to be another crag on Black Mountain worth scaling.","Black Mountaineers Amber Webber and Joshua Wells seek better living through histrionics, not chemistry; fortunately, this self-titled Jagjaguwar debut is just as potent a blast from the past as their full-time band.

Hope for Men,Pissed Jeans,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e5c0084474cd0c1d1b/1:1/w_160/62c8cdd6.jpg,2007-06-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10311-hope-for-men/,Sub Pop,"Caveat emptor: I'm kind of obsessed with Pissed Jeans, this hardcore punk quartet from Allentown, Penn. It's the kind of obsession that bores your friends and alienates folks who casually ask, ""So, heard any good records lately?"" If those people do go on to check out the band, they tend to reply: ""It just sounded like a lot of noise with some dude moaning/yelling about scrapbooking and Whole Foods."" And that's why it's great! Now signed to obscure boutique label Sub Pop and already on their second album, the brand new Hope For Men, Pissed Jeans' rock is sourced in the early-80s loose-booty sludge of Flipper and Black Flag, the tightly wound treble-spray of late-80s/early-90s noise-rock such as Drunks With Guns and the Jesus Lizard, and a maxed-out Paypal account's worth of hyper-obscure hardcore nobodies who put out one awesome 7"" before permanently taking that job at Orange Julius. It's an ugly sound-- sometimes frenzied (the sawn-off boogie of closer ""My Bad"") and sometimes totally entropic (the glue-huffing feedback-dub bummer ""Scrapbooking"")-- that I can't get enough of. Unlike so much music in 2007, whether it's Justice or the Arcade Fire, Pissed Jeans doesn't want to inflate your sense of euphoria. They want to stub out enthusiasm like a cigarette on a forehead. Plenty of folks who grew up with hardcore have since moved onto its noisier or artier or less-traditional cousins. (Or they've written it off entirely thanks to the Victory Records version where the multiple T-shirt designs are pretty cool and all the bands fucking suck.) Pissed Jeans singer Matt Korvette also runs the White Denim label, which has put out great, smartly packaged, and obtuse offerings by not-really-hardcore weirdos like Baltimore's tweaked circuit-benders Leprechaun Catering and English improv-rock druids Aufgehoben. And when Pissed Jeans want to, they can certainly delight in noise for noise's sake. Just listen to Hope for Men opener ""People Person"": The buzzing that swarms throughout the song like a B-movie's worth of giant locusts isn't even solid enough to pass for a riff. Those squeals and sobs are like rock music made by sadists who join a seal clubbing expedition because they like the sounds the seals make when clubbed. Hope for Men is generally a little slower and lower than Pissed Jeans' 2005 debut Shallow, like the three-minutes of drunken stumblebum riffs lurching back and forth on ""Fantasy World"" or bad-vibes whirlpool of ""Secret Admirer"". But ""bash first and ask questions later"" tracks like ""A Bad Wind"" and ""Caught Licking Leather"" are reminders of why your tense, agitated ass started listening to punk rock in the first place. After I wrote about ""I've Still Got You (Ice Cream)"", I was gently chided for treating the lyrics, in which Korvette seems to claim that no matter how bad things get he can still enjoy a frozen treat, in some sort of ironic ""LOL guy is writing a song about ice cream"" way. Not so! What makes Pissed Jeans' lyrics great is the real-world specificity of them. Dude gets bummed. Dude has ice cream. Dude feels better. Who among us can not relate? ""Scrapbooking"", which crawls for five-minutes over broken piano keys and is sung like a version of Black Flag's ""Damaged 1"" written by a dude with a normal-sized neck, appears to be about, you know, scrapbooking. On ""The Jogger"", a few minutes of sewer drip ambience, Korvette beefs about the kind of Whole Foods-shopping, Bally's Fitness Club membership-having, shirt-tucked-in douche who makes the rest of us feel vaguely bad about our record collecting and drinking-unto-blackout lifestyles. And really, whether or not Korvette is dead serious or taking the piss, he knows, like all great comedians, that it's at least 75% in the pained, sexually frustrated, stubbed-toe delivery. If you've just been fired or dumped and are currently contemplating either drinking an entire case of generic beer or setting an orphanage on fire, this is the album for you. When life got too heavy in 2006, and it often was, I listened to Shallow, laughed my ass off, and felt better. Hope for Men makes me laugh even harder. (And, you know, bang my head, kick over newspaper boxes, bare my teeth at small children, want to form a Halo of Flies cover band, stuff like that.) Listening, I was often reminded of Lester Bangs famously playing a suicidal friend Public Image Ltd.'s ambivalent death dirge ""Theme""-- the track's another good sonic reference point for Pissed Jeans, come to think of it-- and asking if John Lydon groaning ""And I wish I could die"" over and over again was therapeutic in any way. The joke of the small indignities and crushing defeats is on all of us, and Hope for Men is currently one of the few records you should pull out-- both at your darkest moments and just the times when some jerkoff gets the last bagel at Dunkin' Donuts in the morning-- to remind yourself that no matter how many times you catch your dick in your zipper, metaphorically or literally, it's better to laugh along. That, and there's always ice cream.","The second album from this recent Sub Pop signing is sourced in the early-80s sludge of Flipper and Black Flag and the tightly wound treble-spray of late-80s/early-90s noise-rock bands like the Jesus Lizard.

Excellent Italian Greyhound,Shellac,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e79d034d5c69bf4949/1:1/w_160/601daba4.jpg,2007-06-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10314-excellent-italian-greyhound/,Touch and Go,"You're not even really reading this. Why would you? I could rate this album a 12 divided by Q or say it's on par with seven ham-and-cheese Hot Pockets and it wouldn't matter. Anyone who cares has already marched to their nearest independent retailer and purchased Excellent Italian Greyhound, laughed aloud at the dog picture, shook the unmarked CD from the gatefold cover (because Steve Albini hates digital recordings-- and you), and spun the vinyl with warm, grating satisfaction. The reviews are irrelevant, and one from Pitchfork probably means even less to Shellac listeners than most. Shellac's audience is built-in and guaranteed in a way that, despite Touch & Go's perfectly respectable roster, no other active band on the label can claim; they're the last real band standing on the last real label standing. Steve Albini's notorious reputation may precede him, but Shellac have maintained their integrity by cutting out the promoters, the promos, the PR, the interviews, the hype, and the bullshit. Who cares about integrity any more, you ask? Just wait. One day you'll tell your kids who Albini and Ian MacKaye were and get blank stares in return. You'll watch your children grow up to become managers and ""indie"" PR shills for groups with at least two exclamation points in their bandnames while you shout about how ""back in my day, bands used to stand for something"" while slack-jawed, iPod-toting orderlies push your wheelchair in a circle around the nurses' station at the old-folks home. That Shellac continue to seek the shortest path between the music and the fans is a point worth repeating. Yet there's a point, I think, when the fans will wonder what they're getting beyond a pat on the back. Excellent Italian Greyhound is unique in being one of very few albums anticipated for seven years-- a punk-rock eternity-- that still feels rushed. Albini and Bob Weston are both very busy engineers, and Shellac was never a full-time gig for either of them, or drummer Todd Trainer, so no one within reason gets pissy over the wait between their records. Plus, the band's very occasional live shows (which have thankfully increased in number lately) are still essential life experiences. Of course, you could say the same for a band like Fugazi, whose last release, The Argument, came out way back in 2001: They pushed past boundaries and expectations until the very end before wisely resting on their laurels. Here, Shellac are simply digging in their heels, relishing their in-jokes, and doing what they do best-- and not much else. All that said, EIG's first half is a holy affirmation, and maybe short of ""Prayer to God"" features the band's best opening track. ""The End of Radio"" is a minimalist three-chord funeral march for (you guessed it) radio, as Albini assumes the character of the last DJ (and man) on earth, screaming dedications to a deserted planet. While the vocals aren't as foaming as they've been during live performances, the more desperate and pathetic tone fits this clever conceit. Albini errantly lets out nervous patter and thanks non-existent sponsors before wailing, ""Can you hear me now???"" and letting loose with the crackling guitar lines we love Shellac for. ""Steady as She Goes"" is another live staple finally seeing release, exemplary of the thin, metallic chug they've patented, though it's without the tension or left turns of their earlier work. The band saves the stretching out for side two. ""Lulabelle"" is undoubtedly the strangest and most difficult track to get through: Its heavy riffage is interrupted by a long segment of the Sinatra-like crooning of some pretty unsettling lyrics, plus voiceovers from maybe-movie announcers and Strongbad. The juxtaposition is hilarious and disturbing, and while you may never play it more than a few times, it's the most confrontational the band gets on this record, as well as closest in spirit to At Action Park or Albini's former projects. ""Boycott"" is a quick-and-dirty anti-capitalist rant from Weston, and though the metronome tick of the instrumental ""Kittypants"" strikes me as filler, the other instrumental, ""Paco"", is a vicious highlight with atmosphere that's as sparse and evocative as an Ennio Morricone score. The odd interlude that introduces ""Spoke"" gives way to straight-up punk rock with unintelligible screaming from both Weston and Albini. I can't help but feel like the joke's on the listener here, but it's hard not to smile at it. I bring up Fugazi because they're the only of Albini's like-minded contemporaries still (maybe) kicking, and because the Weston-sung ""Elephant"" makes the curious choice of directly quoting them at the start (""Here comes the argument""), before proceeding with some slippery bass chords and militant rhythms that are pretty darn close to sounding like the flagship Dischord band. Elsewhere, the relentless hammer-ons and spat-out non sequiturs of ""Be Prepared"" (""I was born wearing pants!"") stop abruptly in midstream to start an oddly cheerful groove that sounds not unlike Thin Lizzy. It's a gleeful moment, but there was a time when Shellac barely acknowledged other bands, leaving a blazing trail of influence in their stubborn wake. Not only is Excellent Italian Greyhound Shellac's most off-the-cuff record; it's often an uncharacteristically indebted one. For those of us scratching our heads and laughing at that album cover, anyone who's seen the band live knows that they're hysterical, and EIG, like 1000 Hurts before it, proves you can still provoke listeners without being uniformly dour. Even at their silliest, even when they're treading water, no one else sounds quite like Shellac, and anyone who professes to be a serious music fan without having spent quality time with the band's albums should be forced to familiarize themselves. This just wouldn't be the first record I'd force on them.","After seven years-- an eternity in punk rock-- Steve Albini, Todd Trainer, and Bob Weston return, digging in their heels, relishing their in-jokes, and doing what they do best.

Keeper of Youth,The Only Children,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b9c0084474cd0c1cd6/1:1/w_160/c71cb97b.jpg,2007-06-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10272-keeper-of-youth/,SideCho,"Immediately on the Only Children's second album, Josh Berwanger makes his frustrations known: over a determined Stones riff on ""Tired of this Town"", the former Anniversary frontman and indie lifer sings, ""Tired of being wrong/ Tired of singing songs/ Tired of not acting my age."" The nine songs that follow on Keeper of Youth elaborate on his disappointments, some of which are well founded, others a little tiresome. Certainly Berwanger and his band are entitled to them: he's been making music for nearly a decade, a once-hyped artist surpassed by many subsequent flavors-of-the-month and now an outsider proud of his flyover-state heritage. The Kansas-based Only Children express this wizened anomie with a bar-band ethos that glorifies immediate riffs, unpretentious lyrics, chorus hooks that make a virtue of predictability, and the mournful country flourish of pedal steel. It's classic rock freighted with punk dissent. The Only Children make it work often on Keeper of Youth, but their mission gets the better of them. The melodramatic strings on the title track and the convincing reggae rhythms of ""Hide Your Sorrow"" fare much better than the ridiculous gospel posturing of ""Amen Amen"". Heidi-Lynne Gluck's feminine vocals nicely complement Berwanger's howl on ""Invisible Streets"" and the quiet closer ""Blackheart of Life"". ""1969"" starts with a near-perfect rock couplet: ""Said you were leavin'/ And then you stole my car,"" but Berwanger screws it up almost immediately: ""Said you'd feel a whole lot better/ Drivin' some place [wait for it] far."" The reigning tone of Keeper of Youth is prideful nostalgia. Berwanger glories in looking backwards for inspiration and guidance, but he too readily buys into classic rock myths that should have faded away when baby boomers started subscribing to Modern Maturity. ""What happened to the spirit of rock and roll/ I guess it died a long time ago,"" he sings on ""Invisible Streets"". ""But that ain't true/ Do you remember Dylan and the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters and the Ramones..."" Please, tell us more about these good ol' days when music mattered. ""Dusty Magazines"" wants it both ways: after lambasting critics, Berwanger bitches about record labels whose next-big-thing tunnel vision has generated so much crappy music. But he's just preaching to the choir. A truly controversial statement illustrates how readily the Only Children would change places with the popular bands: ""My band's got what it takes/ But we just can't catch a break."" It'd probably be heartbreaking if it didn't sound so self-pitying. Keeper of Youth recalls another state-of-the-indie-career album: the Wrens' Meadowlands, a wrenching collection of songs about lives wasted in the indie trenches. The comparison is instructive and the artists' frustrations similarly sympathetic, but instead of playing like their live(lihood)s depend on it, the Only Children sound like they're retreating into their record collection. Even though their bitterness was more acute, the Wrens' frustrations felt more universal, to the extent that Meadowlands perfectly expresses every thirty-year-old's sense of time wasted and opportunities lost. Keeper of Youth, on the other hand, sounds like the Only Children are too tired to see beyond themselves.","Former Anniversary frontman Josh Berwanger makes a state-of-the-indie-career album that leans toward backward-glancing classic rock freighted with punk dissent.

Kajak,Benni Hemm Hemm,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b6ea9e61561daa667e/1:1/w_160/ef36a374.jpg,2007-06-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10269-kajak/,Morr,"There is more luster to the Icelandic, 14-member Benni Hemm Hemm's second album, as the brassy pomp of their self-titled debut is mostly abandoned, or tucked into the opening and closing corners of each piece. In its place are the shimmers of the guitar and delicate wind passages: ""Brekkan"" is content to have a glockenspiel and strings sift lazily through the pretty three-note descents of the brass which, though usually overpowering, back off to give the drums and bass center stage. What the album mostly figures as is an understated decoration of a landscape: the few repeated words of ""Snjórljóssnjór"" and its locomotive rhythm, or the dusty desert suggested in the banjo strums of ""Stoffer"". But the pulse of Kajak turns out to be measured by those punchy hodgepodge introductions and exits, where cymbals, strings, and all manner of brass crash in unison, thus forming the lump of material from which the meat of a song is carved. The ""meat,"" particularly on ""Stoffer"" and finale ""Egísa"", can suffer by being whittled away to almost nothing, resulting in listless rhythms, epically held notes, and rocking-chair guitar patterns. Sometimes, as on ""Abbastúfur"", this stripping away works: Benedikt Hermannsson conducts bass and tenor male vocalists around the soft and glittering sounds of the guitar. The full, flawless sound of this chorus is one of the best features on the album, and reappears later on ""Ég á bát"". When the song builds to include basic punches of percussion, the brass threatens to overpower the human voices, but in the end each part perfectly complements the other. There was considerably more English on the debut, but it seems inconsequential here that the lyrics are in Icelandic. ""Sex eða sjö"" is another quiet number that succeeds because it's pulled out of somnambulism by marching drums, another strong chorus, and most of all, the deep vocal lines. The urgency of many instruments joining in sets many of the songs apart from the ruminative, airy acoustics of a song like ""Ég á bát"". Still, by changing up predictable guitar chords just slightly-- by hollowing them out and creating surprising vocal harmonies around them-- the songs become summery memorabilia as opposed to forgettable. But for almost every one to finish with a bombast flourish à la Neutral Milk Hotel can be frustrating, and when such colorful volume is fully embraced (""Mónakó""), the song is too brief, its consistent 1:49 of noise just a fleeting alternative to the norm: lullabies that age well-- and go out with a predictable, usually affecting bang.","Iceland native Benedikt Hermannsonn's 14-piece band returns with a second album mixing whispy, ruminative strums with brass, strings, and fiercely emotive rhythms.

The Art of the Slap,Scharpling & Wurster,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bdc0084474cd0c1cdb/1:1/w_160/ab72c677.jpg,2007-06-06 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10276-the-art-of-the-slap/,Stereolaffs,"Modern talk radio as we know it effectively functions as a conduit for anger and provocation, a way to prod people with sharp sticks to find out what they sound like when they yell. Condoleeza Rice rape jokes and ""flied lice"" prank calls to Chinese restaurants aren't just goony shock-jock hijinx, they're the signs of an arrogant sense of bad-boy entitlement that values offense as the driving force of humor instead of a potential side effect. Worse still, these ideas of what makes for outrageous humor are depressingly uniform: A 2003 Entertainment Weekly article revealed that, when pressed for accounts of the ""craziest thing ever done in their studio,"" three different DJs from three distinct regions of the country all answered to the effect of a woman spraying some sort of beverage out of an anatomical region invariably referred to using baby-talk euphemisms. Rock and roll! For roughly 10 years, radio host/comedy writer Tom Scharpling and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster have built on that uncomfortable dynamic in an escalatingly absurd and elaborate fashion, and there's a pointed jab at the current character of American radio and its listeners beneath the surface of their call-in sketches. Despite the often-irritable undercurrent to his radio program The Best Show on WFMU, Scharpling is the quintessential demoralized straight man: Frequently lamenting the craziness of his callers, snapping ""GET OFF MY PHONE"" at some of the more problematic cases, and preemptively warning the addled listener on the other end of the line to steer clear of ""toilet talk""; many of his conversations with callers end with a rapidly-deflating, high-pitched sigh, as though he considers himself lucky to get out of that exchange alive. The other half of the The Best Show team is Wurster, who regularly calls in as a character whose belligerence, delusion, ignorance, or just plain sociopathy ricochets madly off Scharpling's uneasy attempts to make sense out of the situation, and that's where The Art of the Slap gets its material. This 3xCD set is the fifth in a series of releases that dates back to the original 1997 bit ""Rock, Rot & Rule"", and while it skews a bit weirder than previous entries-- Tom has an extended conversation with a carp-- it still sticks with what works. The Scharpling & Wurster formula is airtight: Tom takes a call from a vaguely shady-sounding man who usually has prior business with Tom or, alternately, some sort of response to something said at some previous point during the show. The conversation goes smoothly for a few minutes until Wurster's caller lets some uncomfortable detail slip and everything starts to unravel in a horrific mess: The guys who were supposed to repair Tom's computer are a bunch of roid-raging jocks who opted to smash his PC instead; a tornado survivor who pledged to turn his life around two years ago is calling back to hawk his ""Pimp City"" video game and a series of celebrity blackmail videos; the carp turns out to be a fratboyish jerk. Things inevitably go sour, and Tom finds himself the brunt of some sort of elaborate impending threat, assuming the caller doesn't have his own to worry about. And it all builds to a peak over the course of twenty-plus minutes. (Unsurprisingly, the duo ply their trade on community radio, where this kind of indulgence gets appropriate breathing room; an episode last December condensed the previous week's bit into a two-minute commercial ""morning zoo"" pace and it landed with a thud.) Naturally, it's how the two riff on the structure that makes each bit. Wurster tends to drop several reoccurring catchphrases (""Define…,"" ""Yes, why?"", ""Wait, whaaaat?"") that wryly betray his character's dimbulb obliviousness, and while he doesn't have the most versatile or easily-disguised voice-- listen for three weeks and you'll be able to spot a Wurster call a mile away-- he manages to find a way to make each call unpredictable. Scharpling is largely left to react, which he does with superb comedic timing; often all he needs to do is skeptically repeat one of Wurster's more ridiculous assertions or laugh in incredulous horror to keep the momentum going. Some bits tend to wander thematically, like ""Postal Slap Fight"", which starts as a tirade against Tom's music snobbery and subsequently covers subjects ranging from the merits of ""Vice President Lon Chaney"" to the fictional Alan Alda/Brendan Fraser movie President Baseball to the caller's professional slap-fighting league. Others feature an extended scenario, like horror film auteur Trent L. Strauss (director of You're Soaking in Her and Art School Arsonist) laying out the entire plot of his ludicrous upcoming project The Toolbelt Killer: it's a movie about a disfigured Lowe's employee who enacts revenge against the town that shunned him for coming from the wrong side of the tracks-- the rich side. The undisputed highlight of the set is the ""bonus CD"" detailing the triumph and tragedy of alt-rock remainder bin fodder Mother 13, who planned to conquer the music world by becoming the first band to play Mt. Everest. Part 1 features the arrogant, preening alt-rock frontman Corey Harris, whose band plies its trade at assorted corporate-sponsored festivals such as the Huggies Fall Into Softness Tour, hyping the all-star bill and detailing his regimen of mountaineer training-- which mostly involves beer and a fake rock-climbing wall at a local shopping mall. Part 2, recorded a week later, is the grisly aftermath, in which a wheezy, whimpering Harris elaborates on a morbid but uncomfortably hilarious series of disasters: Buddy Guy dies during the ascent and is abandoned in a ""blues igloo"", Clarence Clemons comes down with snow madness and commits unthinkable acts of cannibalism, and a member of the Polyphonic Spree falls off the peak; since the band is roped together, he brings them all down with him. ""Wow,"" Scharpling concludes at the end of the call, ""this kinda puts a damper on the show."" It also makes The Art of the Slap one of the easiest comedy record recommendations of the year, proof that shock and provocation work best when it's the host who's taking the brunt.","For almost a decade, WFMU radio host/comedy writer Tom Scharpling and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster have built on the uncomfortable shock-jock dynamic in an escalatingly absurd and elaborate fashion; here, they collect their best work.

Funf,Clinic,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ccc0084474cd0c1cf4/1:1/w_160/7cfe2b7b.jpg,2007-06-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10290-funf/,Domino,"It's hard not to feel a bit of sympathy for Clinic. When they hit the ground running in the late 1990s, they were greeted with such an intense blizzard of critical acclaim that they were damned never to live up to the expectations set for them. Their fingerprint, first established on a series of excellent early EPs and solidified on their unremittingly brilliant debut album Internal Wrangler, is unmistakable: Drawing from dub, surf-rock, doo-wop, psych, British jazz, girl groups, the Velvet Underground, and everything in between, it's a sound that stimulates countless record-collector pleasure centers. And yet, for whatever reason, their successive albums have all felt relatively lacking, failing to fully recapture the diversity of their debut. Now comes Funf, a collection of odds and ends pulled from the steady flow of three-song singles that have accompanied each of Clinic's albums, covering the period from Internal Wrangler through last year's Visitations. Funny enough, the random, fractured flow of the disc is the closest the band has come to recreating the aesthetic their fans have pined for since Walking With Thee changed the script with its consistent, icy sound. Unfortunately, the quality of the material widely varies. The disc opens with ""The Majestic"", from the ""Return of Evil Bill"" single, an instrumental track that might have served as an alternate Internal Wrangler opener if ""Voodoo Wop"" hadn't bettered it. Radiating the haunted surf vibe Clinic have often explored, it packs enough material for a whole suite into just two minutes. The alpha, however, is quickly followed by the omega: ""The Magician"" B-side ""Nicht"" is just horrible, an overdistorted punk rant that transforms familiar Clinic territory into a dense, impenetrable mess. Nothing else on Funf approaches this nadir, but much of it comes off as subpar variations on sounds they've delivered more capably elsewhere. The ""Second Line"" single's ""Magic Boots"" is like a less memorable, vocal version of ""Hippie Death Suite"", for instance, while ""Christmas"" (off ""Come Into Our Room"") falls somewhere between ""Earth Angel"" and ""Goodnight Georgie"". With its jazz-inflected, smoothly flowing guitar part and well-placed hook, ""Christmas"" is something of a rarity on Funf: a well-executed run that actually earns its inclusion. There are a couple of others here that deserve another look. ""The Castle"" (from the flip of ""The Return of Evil Bill"") is one of the record's best tracks, employing the overdriven organ sound of ""2nd Foot Stomp"" and spotlighting a classic, clenched-teeth vocal from frontman Ade Blackburn. ""Lee Shan"", originally a B-side to ""Harvest (Within You)"", rides a repeated piano phrase through a cavern of Spector-esque reverb, but instead of a Carole Kaye bassline and a soaring vocal, we get Blackburn's paranoia and nail-biting surf guitar with a bit of spooky reed organ. It's a good example of Clinic doing their best to subvert the expectations set up by the obviousness of the influences at work in their music. Apart from these, there are a couple of surf-style tracks that sound kind of cool but don't feature much in the way of melody, some other tracks that were obviously left aside in favor of better ones, and a handful of go-nowhere experiments like ""Dissolution; The Dream of Bartholomew"", which aimlessly meanders between passages of stinging fuzz guitar and twinkly noises. Clinic completists aren't likely to find much of note here, as they'll already own all of these tracks and more (the collection is far from definitive, leaving off several b-sides, including ""Stardust"", ""The Sphinx"", ""Saxon Road"", ""Cutting Grass"", and ""Mechanical Madrigal""), but those open to traversing the band's more haphazard experiments may find a few fleeting moments of worth.","Clinic compile odds and ends from the steady flow of three-song singles that have accompanied each of their albums, covering the period from their breakout Internal Wrangler through last year's Visitations.

With Lasers,Bonde Do Rolê,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0d49d034d5c69bf4922/1:1/w_160/530deb3a.jpg,2007-06-06 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10296-with-lasers/,Domino,"A few months ago, on a weeknight when I just wanted to catch the ""American Idol"" results and be in bed at a reasonable time, I was coaxed out by some friends to catch a set by those young, Manic Panic-coiffed Brazilian indie kids Bonde Do Role. Tired and cranky, I gave Bonde my best arms-folded, disdainful rock critic ice grill for as long as my shriveled Grinch heart could hold out. I wasn't quite sure when the band finally won me over-- was it the track that chopped up Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" or when singer Marina Vello stuffed her microphone down the front of her tights and began air-humping with Pretty Ricky vigor?-- but my crankiness quickly melted away in the face of the trio's pungent and playful shtick, oversexed and overdosed on the beat from Tone-Loc's ""Wild Thing"". Bonde do Role are constantly bracketed with CSS and Diplo in the press. The Diplo connection is obvious: The dilettante cratedigger discovered them on a vacation to Rio and released an earlier EP on his boutique label, Mad Decent. But forget the association with CSS, the adorable day-glo cult cargo that washed up on American shores at roughly the same time: They may share an unusual fashion sense (Marina, sporting a Paul Revere and the Raiders-style pudding-bowl haircut, stuffs herself into a pair of too-tight leopard print stretch pants), but Bonde's jones for baile funk, the popular fusion of hip-house, Miami bass, and Latin beats that rose to international prominence in recent years, thanks in part to championing from a number of acclaimed DJs, sets them apart. With Lasers, the group's debut album, opens with a Van Halen hammer-on, Gregorian chanting, and a growling computer voice that falls halfway between Vincent Price and the iron man who kicked off Rob Base and DJ EZ-Rock's ""It Takes Two"". And what we get for the rest of the album isn't so much indie kids versioning baile funk as... antmusic! Maybe it's just the fact that 10 of its 12 songs clock in under three minutes (some barely squeak to two), or that the platonic baile funk beat sounds so much like an off-brand Latin version of the Burundi stomp with some added Salt-N-Pepa snap and pop, but you can totally imagine Marina as the take-no-shit 21st-century Annabella Lwin with bandmates Pedro D'Eyrot and Rodrigo Gorky acting as the two-man Bow Wow Wow behind her-- especially on ""James Bonde"", with its distorto-twang surf guitar, or the Bo Diddley cruise-ship sound of ""Tieta"". Bonde do Role may have inherited their homeland's love of really crappy sounding 808s and breakbeats that rattle like coconuts in the breeze, but they friggin' love cheesy guitars. I mean, terrible sports bar blues-band buttrock licks and 90s grunge grunts (an earlier single turned the detuned wah riff of Alice in Chains' ""Man in the Box"" into a dance hook), and the hairiest of hair metal. Just like baile funk. And also like baile funk, you can't really describe it as ""ersatz"" because the whole genre is ersatz as fuck, and Bonde's baile is one, two steps from the ""real"" thing. Cheerleader chants and horny panting! Incredibly cheap programmed drums and pop culture quotes! Booty bass beats and inexplicable Afrika Bambaataa shoutouts played on Todd Terry's vocal-chopping keyboard! (Bonde loves the vocal stutter effect almost as much as they love guitars.) As with baile funk, this low-budget throwback is an aesthetic virtue for Bonde do Role. It's a building block-- the horns on ""Tieta"" are as tinny and off-the-rack as any Trinidadian soca hit, while ""Caminhao de Gas"" rocks and the 8-bit video game hook-- not a necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention third-world practicality. Those of us lacking a functional understanding of Portuguese will have to approach the chants as universal party-starting sex-urge noises that go beyond language-- which isn't hard to do, really, since Bonde probably aren't exactly flipping Rakim or Lil' Wayne level metaphor. If With Lasers suffers for anything, it's the fact that no one's figured out a way to get sweaty leopard print crotches onto CDs just yet. I do wonder how much of my enjoyment derives from my memories of the Bonde do Role live gig and its awkward but non-ironic booty popping, pheromones, and spilled beer. But there's still a lot of pleasure to be had during the humid months this year in imagining the Bonde kids shaking their barely-legal, jiggling stuff as they trade off raps on record like Run-DMC. And if you're part of the generation that's erased the distance between dancing and dry humping, With Lasers should easily get you through a long, hot summer of awkward hook-ups at backyard barbecues.","Brazilian indie trio follow last year's Diplo-issued Melô do Tabaco EP by consummating their love of baile funk with their Domino Records full-length debut.

Five Roses,Miracle Fortress,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0beb1335d7bf169a188/1:1/w_160/e9218b39.jpg,2007-06-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10277-five-roses/,Secret City,"It's telling that the title track here is an instrumental. As a member of wacky Montreal popsters Think About Life, Miracle Fortress' Graham Van Pelt has already demonstrated his ear for keyboard textures (and a gung-ho live show). On his debut album as Miracle Fortress, Van Pelt plays all the instruments (though he's since recruited a touring band that includes Sunset Rubdown's Jordan Robson-Cramer), and he embraces sonic textures as the defining element of a sunny auteur-pop aesthetic. Amid the post-Smile hoopla of 2004, I nervously predicted a Beach Boys backlash. Of course, I'm happy to report I couldn't have been more wrong: Panda Bear's everywhere-praised Person Pitch might be trippier, or the Crayon Fields' Animal Bells more charming, but Five Roses is as upfront as either about its debt to 2007's oft-name-checked Brian Wilson. Most overt is ""Maybe Lately"", which plays off the angelic verse melody of ""Don't Worry Baby"" before dissolving into shiny electronics. ""And maybe when we're older I'll be less afraid/ And maybe when it gets colder you can come to stay,"" Van Pelt sings in a near-falsetto. Layers of high-pitched vocal harmonies likewise give a Pet Sounds sound to polished midtempo pop-rockers ""Hold Your Secrets to Your Heart"" and ""Have You Seen in Your Dreams""; the sparkling arpeggios on ""Beach Baby"" could almost be a slowed-down recreation of the opening guitar chimes of ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"". You know, pleasant vibrations. Miracle Fortress' tracks can sound as much like cybernetic love songs as teenage symphonies, suggesting another influence on Van Pelt's studio exercise: fellow texture-lover Brian Eno. Van Pelt's washes of dreamy synths and synth-like guitar leads over straight-ahead strums on opener ""Whirrs"" or the atmospheric ""Little Trees"" recall the way Eno achieved like-minded combinations during his 70s peak-- though without similarly commanding tunes or vocal presence, the comparison isn't entirely complimentary. Moreover, Van Pelt doing Eno is blander than the real dude's best: On songs like cloying ""Blasphemy"", the myriad electronic effects barely disguise what's basically lackluster acoustic rock. ""I know always we're on different trains/ Sunday meet me, see me here again,"" a multi-tracked Van Pelt peeks out from the whirring soundscapes on ""Poetaster"". Five Roses reveals Van Pelt as a talented producer who knows his way around summery pop songs. Still, the album at times indulges Van Pelt's ear for textures a bit much. Miracle Fortress' use of traditionally nonmusical sound effects-- cats meowing, birds chirping, or, on the title track, a propeller-like whir-- can end up being more memorable than the songs such noises adorn. In a perverse move, Van Pelt saves the strongest track, ""This Thing About You"", for last; bouncy tambourine and a gauze of effects-laden guitars put life into old love-song lyrical tropes. Like Eno, like Wilson, Miracle Fortress sounds best when the productions serve the songs.","Panda Bear's everywhere-praised Person Pitch might be trippier, or the Crayon Fields' Animal Bells more charming, but this debut from Think About Life's Graham Van Pelt is as upfront as either about its debt to 2007's oft-name-checked Brian Wilson.

Bayani,Blue Scholars,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b5ea9e61561daa667b/1:1/w_160/3984461f.jpg,2007-06-05 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10267-bayani/,Rawkus,"The line between relatable and mundane has been a hard one for rap artists to straddle: for every time Del complained about the Oakland public transit service on I Wish My Brother George Was Here or Devin the Dude stressed about how to stretch $17 on Waitin' to Inhale, there've been countless other underground MCs who rhyme about the struggle of their daily lives with the same ground-down fatigue that makes their living situation hard to tolerate in the first place. They spend so much time talking about their humble regular-guy status that they forget to draw an identifiable picture of what it's really like to be there -- and often what you're left with is PSA rap, something that somberly feeds you information you already know and thinks it's important for doing so. Blue Scholars frequently risk falling into this trap during their sophomore full-length Bayani, even if they've got distinctiveness on their side. They play up their otherness as a nationally known hip-hop group from Seattle, dropping evocative regional references from 1980s Sonics fixture Xavier McDaniel to front-line accounts of the World Trade Organization demonstrations, while their ethnicity (MC Geologic is Filipino-American; DJ/producer Sabzi is of Iranian heritage) stands out as a prospective dialogue-starter in such a race-conscious genre. But while there's admirable intent behind their working-class solidarity, the album could use a bit more levity and funk for fans still riding high off the party-political momentum of last year's brilliant Coup album Pick a Bigger Weapon. That said, you can't lay any significant blame on Geologic's ability as a lyricist: while he tends to rest his lyrics' weight on a well-worn brand of conscious populism, they're strung together with some worthwhile wordplay and frequent flashes of narrative sharpness. The immigrant story in ""The Distance"" pivots quickly from idealism to cynicism on a pointed phrase: ""But this life was premised on a lie/ Instead of being promised by society the nature of economy is sodomy/ Ten generations of property turn to poverty."" ""50K Deep"" is a firsthand perspective to the aforementioned WTO protests (""I admit, had to split when the first gas canisters hit/ Felt it burnin' my nose, eyes and lips"") that brings a personal context to an event that's become largely forgotten during the Bush era. And where some battle-rap-bred MCs might relate a childhood growing up broke in the 80s strictly in pop-culture touchstones and throwaway metaphors, ""Morning of America"" ties in Geo's childhood memories of Purple Rain, Transformers, and the Cosby Show into the larger, more unsettling era those icons were a distraction to -- a time that also saw the Iran-Contra scandal and the hate-crime murder of Vincent Chin. But the thing that makes Bayani approach tedium is the tone of Geo's voice itself, so laser-focused on the words at the expense of inflection that it borders on monotony. The chorus of ""Back Home""-- a call to return our soldiers back from the front-- demands a certain intensity for it to resonate, especially with such straightforward phrasing behind it (""We say bring 'em back home/ For my brothers and my sisters who been gone too long/ Saying bring 'em back home/ And I don't want to have to keep on singing this song""). But he sounds more defeated than defiant, as if he just got a look at the Democrats' compromised no-timetable Iraq funding bill. It deadens the anthemic potential of a few other cuts, too-- ""Fire for the People"" talks about clenching fists with a tone that couldn't crack a hard-boiled egg, and the hitches for breath on ""Still Got Love"" are more noticeable than the conflicted bitterness and frustration over ingratitude that should be powering it. (The chorus does, however, reveal a decent capacity for half-sung cadence.) Fortunately, whatever force is lacking in Geologic's voice is largely offset by Sabzi's beats. His style is packed with dynamic low-end and clean, glossy updates on late-70s/early-80s r&b, drawing on the last ten years' worth of East Coast and Midwest neo-soul-rap production with strands of the Roots, the Ummah, and Hi-Tek running through. There's lots of odd and unique little touches that tend to stick out: a hook that could've been a straightforward Bill Withers interpolation is hollowed out into a series of truncated syllables; a vocoder bridges the gap between Zapp and fellow Seattleites United State of Electronica; a guitar riff is bent so far out of shape it's hard to deduce what genre it originated from. Even if the record skews towards the mellow and the downtempo, it sounds better each time you play it -- and when that happens with production it usually means the rhyming will grow on you. Even if Blue Scholars are conscious rap's next great hope more or less by default, Bayani hints that maybe they aren't as ordinary as they say they are.","Seattleite MC Geologic drops regional references ranging from Xavier McDaniel to front-line accounts of the World Trade Organization demonstrations over producer Sabzi's glossy update of late-70s r&b.

Shortwave Music,William Basinski,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b2ea9e61561daa6672/1:1/w_160/32fa11b2.jpg,2007-06-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10264-shortwave-music/,2062,"Unless you bought the original LP-only issue of Shortwave Music, released on Germany's Raster-Noton in 1997, there's a good chance you've never heard Muzak like this. Even then, Shortwave Music wasn't new-- it comprises recordings made all the way back in 1982 by William Basinski, during an especially prolific phase of musical experimentation that generated an archive that sat dormant until the last ten years, when the multimedia artist's release schedule has suddenly become quite busy. All of that work involved looped sound in one way or another, and this is no exception. By 1982, Basinski had already created most of the great stockpile of loops that have brought him recent acclaim, and seeking a new source of sounds, he turned to radio. He sampled short phrases of Muzak and slowed them down until they were unrecognizable, drifting ghosts of themselves. The samples were then looped at varying lengths and combined two at a time with the crunchy surface texture of shortwave broadcasts. The pieces of music that result are tense, droning and dissonant to the point that they barely qualify as ambient-- you really can't help noticing them (my wife certainly does, and they drive her nuts). If you followed Basinski's releases on Raster-Noton, you've already heard the fullest realization of this approach on The River, one of Basinski's defining works. If you haven't started listening to him yet, I'd recommend hearing that before taking in the five tracks compiled here, as it's the most impressive of his shortwave works yet released. This is the experimentation that lead him there, and it's for listeners who want a deeper understanding of the process and the sound. There are two main points of dynamic tension in the music: the shifting of the main musical phrases as two loops of varying length repeat out of sync, and the random rise and fall of shortwave static set against the two steady loops. The best of the five pieces here (""Particle Showers"" is a bonus track not on the original LP) is the 23-minute ""On a Frontier of Wires"", which really lets you marinate in the technique. One of the loops is also an especially intriguing phrase that sounds like it's searching its way through the soup of static and reverb. The other pieces are shorter, though no more direct. ""Evening Scars"" is perhaps the most interesting texturally, the way it takes place in extremely low registers and is built off of eerie loops that convey an underwater feeling. Basinski has carved out an unmistakable sound, and though he's walking familiar ground here, it's a beautiful and striking place to return to.","Created in the early 1980s and first released on vinyl in 1997, this reissue collects pieces created with altered loops of Muzak combined with the crunchy surface texture of shortwave broadcasts.

Double Up,R. Kelly,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cfb1335d7bf169a19f/1:1/w_160/40858ae4.jpg,2007-06-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10293-double-up/,Jive,"More than any other R. Kelly release, Live! The Light It Up Tour encapsulates the man, the myth, and the freak in all his singular insanity. Like an unholy cross between Marvin Gaye and Peter Sellers, the r&b architect plays several roles throughout the performance, from booty-ogling King Dong to Patrón-popping master of ceremonies, but none is more indelible than R. Kelly: Singing Comedian. On an extended version of ""In the Kitchen"", Kells dry humps an imaginary cooking buddy with the vigor of five Emerils before bringing out a chubby dude with an Abe Lincoln beard and sleeve tats to launch some R. Kelly apparel into the cheap seats with a t-shirt bazooka. (He does all this while wearing an R. Kelly t-shirt himself.) After singing the lines, ""I gotcha so wet, it's like a rainforest/ Like Jurassic Park except I'm your sexasaurus baby,"" in the middle of an a cappella version of new song ""The Zoo"", he's greeted with a mix of incredulous screams and laughs. ""There's such a thing as a sexasaurus,"" deadpans Kelly. ""The Zoo"" is only one of several out-and-out joke tracks on the controversial star's ninth LP, Double Up, which puts his stand-up routine to the fore; against next-level metaphorical ridiculousness like ""Sweet Tooth"", the jeep-sexing ""Ignition (Remix)"" seems Ben Stein-straight. Hardly a stranger to absurdity, Kells has been studying the art of crazed hilarity for more than a decade. Years before ""Trapped in the Closet"" cast its spell, he was yodeling randomly on ""Get Up on a Room"" and puncturing Pavarotti with ""The Opera"", both off of 1998's R. But 21 counts of child pornography derailed his ribald candor in 2002, resulting in the spiritually minded Chocolate Factory (2003) and Happy People/U Saved Me (2004). Then people started to forget about that tape and R. Kelly started to embrace his flightier fancies with force. Now, five years after he was first arrested on those infamous charges and with no trial date in sight, Double Up aims for the funny bone. Instead of going up against the likes of Dave Chappelle (""Piss on U"") and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (""Trapped in the Drive Thru""), Kells attempts to join them-- and top them. In a sense, it seems more apropos to judge Double Up as a comedy record than as a pop record. To wit, ""Sex Planet"", with its middle school Uranus-isms, is a tad amateur night. Kells fares better when he attempts to conflate his ""Closet""-style soap opera mastery with his still-peerless way with an r&b hook. Atop a featherweight beat on ""Best Friend"", Kelly acts out a nightmare scenario where all he can do is worry about his wife's fidelity and bitch about toilet paper while holed up in prison due to some vague crime. And though that may not sound like much fun on paper, the songwriter uses his keen, Seinfeld-like observational skills to find punchlines in strange places. Plus, the track's underlying sadness gives it a perverted confessional quality. Now 40 and facing a difficult divorce, Kelly sometimes sounds like a man too old for the club but too stubborn and horny to turn away. Thankfully, he's somewhat aware of this predicament; the singer mines humor as a hapless rube to Usher's young turk in the love triangle saga ""Same Girl"" and a stumbling, regretful drunk on ""Leave Your Name"". (What's mid-life-crisis without the R.?) But while the album contains enough ""Did ya hear that?!"" couplets to keep even the worst Technorati slut stocked with catchphrases for weeks, such one-off bits and scenes lack the repeatability of more traditional pop smashes. Luckily, Kells provides a couple of those, too; ""I'm a Flirt"" (Remix) and ""Hook It Up"" are relatively light on guffaws, but they're both equipped with warm, forever-bounce beats that defy gimmicky plot twists, age, dubious morality, and shameless fuckaphores. When talking about the impetus behind ""Trapped in the Closet"" in a November 2005 appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"", Kelly said, ""Sometimes you can go through so much that you can't do nothin' but laugh."" In 2007, he still faces multiple counts of child pornography that could put him in jail for up to 15 years. His daughters, currently ages 9 and 7, will soon be old enough to comprehend their father's legal troubles (and his songs). On Double Up's opening salvo, ""The Champ"", he claims, ""I've confessed my sins and still didn't find peace."" His moment of reckoning is moving closer, however slowly. But, until then, he's chuckling; comedy, after all, is just tragedy plus time.","After the pious Chocolate Factory (2003) and Happy People/U Saved Me (2004)-- as well as five years with multiple counts of child pornography hanging over his head-- R. Kelly continues to embrace his flightier fancies.

Asa Breed,Matthew Dear,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0cb13d197565213a50e/1:1/w_160/22add025.gif,2007-06-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10289-asa-breed/,Ghostly,"Between the animalistic funk of 2003 single ""Dog Days""-- a dance track that cheerfully nuzzled its way into a SXSW/CMJ mindset-- and 2004's Backstroke LP, there was a lot of talk of Matthew Dear's shapeshifting abilities. He'd already proven, both under his own name (recording for Ghostly and its Spectral sublabel) and as False (for Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 and Minus labels) and Jabberjaw (for Perlon), that he could stretch and twist his Slinky-like tracks to traverse any hairpin of techno's staircase. Now, word was, Dear was turning towards even greater accessibility with a record that would bring a new sense of songform to his gritty, agreeable beat structures. But while six of Backstroke's eight tracks featured vocals (as did ""Dog Days"") and fell into the occasional verse/chorus structure, the record failed to deliver Dear a wider audience. His voice, even with its odd pitch, put its shoulder to the wheel in the service of pop, but the tires were worn from burning rubber behind a disco stoplight; its tracks felt like retreads-- cracked, wobbly, a little thin. I still enjoy the record, but compared to the staggeringly confident tracks Dear released as Audion in just the last year -- ""Mouth to Mouth"", ""I Gave You Away"", remixes for Claude VonStroke, Hot Chip, and Black Strobe, anthems all-- it's difficult to hear Backstroke as the work of the same individual. With his new album, Asa Breed, Dear finally makes good on his long-awaited metamorphosis. It's not that the record is a straightforward pop romp: It's still anchored in Dear's lumbering beats, its rhythms cobbled together from misfiring drum machines and colored with barely-in-tune keyboards and yellowing room tone. Still, Dear pulls together his widest array of elements yet, not just in terms of instrumentation-- electric and acoustic guitars, live drums, and haphazard percussion all play strong roles-- but also style: Hints of new wave, indie rock, Afropop, and even country enliven Asa Breed. Dear's mercurial approach to genre, however, feels less like dabbling than a kind of shambling dandyism, trying on mismatched styles with a sidelong wink in the mirror. The most immediate change is that Dear's voice now sits front-and-center in every track. Actually, make that front-and-center and side-to-side: Virtually every song features two- or three-part, multitracked vocals, encompassing his natural baritone, a more idiosyncratic midrange, and finally a warbly falsetto, generally digitally smeared as a sort of pitch-correction. It's not the greatest voice in the world, but he uses it well, sliding into the notes, lingering on his vowels, and greasing the mechanistic clutter of his backing tracks. It's a suggestive and evocative voice, though exactly what's being suggested is often left ambiguous. On the downcast ""Deserter"" it's impossible to miss the influence of Joy Division's Ian Curtis; on the ruminative ""Fleece on Brain"", his backing Ooh-oohs sound like a scrap of 1960s pop that's wafted in on some errant, psychedelic gust. Sometimes, the vocals themselves mutate into something approaching pure musicality, more sensibility than sense: On ""Will Gravity Win Tonight?"" it might take you dozens of listens to realize that the background babble is really the mantra-like repetition, ""More work to be done."" Asa Breed is a moody record, thanks in no small part to its affirmational lyrics and plaintive guitars. Some critics have found fault with Dear's way with words, and he does occasionally misstep, but more often than not, his slightly cryptic character sketches work well, allowing ambiguous narratives to sprout from the cracked pavement of his productions. The lyrics invite all manner of questions. Who are ""Don and Sherri""? If love is ""such a tricky thing/ Can include diamond rings,"" is that a good or a bad thing? (Dear is married.) And in a record so filled with self-doubt, how much is pure literary invention, and how much points to a crack in the artist's own psyche? It's so rare to get any sense of dance artists' personae that Dear's ambiguous, occasionally confessional lyrics take on extra weight. Part of the pleasure of Asa Breed is its introduction of a character we've never met before; Dear's reluctance to reveal only sends you back into the music looking for answers. (Some of those answers will surprise you: the closing country dirge ""Vine to Vine"", featuring a Johnny Cash-like spoken word drawl, is about a paternal ancestor of Dear's that was allegedly gunned down by Texas Rangers over a century ago.) The other thing that keeps me returning to Asa Breed again and again, beyond its individual songs' inventive, engrossing composition and production, is the pacing of the album. It's moody, yes-- even a jaunty track like ""Fleece on Brain"" feels haunted and fraught with anxiety-- but the record's sequence pinballs from brassy electric bumpers to pensive pits and suspenseful pauses. The first four songs seem to circle a common mood as if poking and prodding from every angle, shining a Maglite in the recesses of a deep funk. (The way he wields phrases suggests the minimalist he's always been, twisting and spinning a few sinewy strands into a rope as tough as woven steel; you can hear Audion's druggy abandon throughout, in slow, grinding synthesizers and tones that change color as gradually as a darkening, stormbound sky.) With ""Elementary Lover"", Dear abruptly changes course, channeling the Tom Tom Club. ""Don and Sherri"" plunges back into the murk of a humid dance floor. ""Will Gravity Win Tonight?"" is bitter black tea as a sort of palate cleanser; ""Pom Pom"" is a bizarre, Beach Boys-influenced miniature (at 2:39, it's the shortest song on the album, by two seconds); ""Death to Feelers"" is a kindergarten tale of unrequited love for toy piano and tambourine. And the last four songs usher us out in a kind of extended dream sequence of organs, acoustic guitars, country yelps, the Sea and Cake lounge jazz, and the totally unexpected American Gothic of ""Vine to Vine"". Maybe it's because Dear has worked on the album, off and on, for the past three years that its stylistic drift is so wide; what's remarkable is how well all the pieces sit together, and how convincingly they lay out a series of stepping stones. Ultimately, the path leads back inside the album itself, breeding as many questions as certainties. One thing remains clear, though: As producer, songwriter and persona, Dear has come into his own with Asa Breed, a bootstrapping album that not only reveals the miles walked, but an ambitious road map ahead.","Techno star's latest album further explores pop accessibility, bringing a new sense of songform to his shapeshifting production work and drawing comparisons to LCD Soundsystem, Beck, and Caribou.

What the Hell Do I Know? EP,Illinois,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0af9d034d5c69bf48eb/1:1/w_160/c24acb2b.jpeg,2007-06-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10262-what-the-hell-do-i-know-ep/,Ace Fu,"With the release of each new Wilco album comes the niggling disappointment that it's not going to be another Summerteeth-- still the band's most successful attempt at casting their country-rock rusticity in a gilded, big-production glow. That it's Wilco's second lowest-selling record (after debut AM) may put me in the minority, but after spending a few lazy Sundays with the debut EP by Illinois, I'm pretty sure these guys can relate. They may hail from small-town Pennsylvania and have a banjo player as a frontman, but Illinois' stock trade is roots-rock uprooted: Dust Bowl balladry that's been yanked out of the soil and set free to float away. If Illinois don't add anything new to the indie rock conversation, they are clearly well-versed in the proper lingo: this seven-song EP hurtles skyward on a billowy bed of ""ba da ba ba bas,"" those onomonopoetic endearments that softened up a million Pavement and Yo La Tengo songs. Illinois are decidedly less obtuse in their emotional expressions: That the chorus to opener ""Alone Again"" repeats the phrase ""I'm alone again"" pretty much sums it up. But even Illinois' most downcast songs possess a heady grandeur that serves to leaven their simplistic, sad-sack sentiments, particularly on splendorous piano-pop serenade ""What Can I Do For You"", whose dejected disposition (""So this is goodbye/ I miss that look in your eye"") is remedied by a swooning chorus and a tasteful banjo break that's more affective than decorative in function. What's most impressive about Illinois at this early stage is their ability to indulge in lovelorn lyricism and cosmic-cowboy reveries while honoring pop music's premium on levity and brevity (the longest song here clocks in at 3:14). And besides, it's not all tears-in-beers here: ""Screendoor"" is 128 seconds of acoustic-strummed rolling rock and call-and-response ""ooh ooh ooh"" elation, and the uncharacteristic hayseed funk of ""Nosebleed"" offers a quaint reminder of that fleeting period in the mid-90s when anyone associated with Beck got an instant deal with DGC and the Flaming Lips hit the top 40. The latter song's quirks-- distorted megaphoned vocals, compressed drum beats-- reappear in much less satisfying form on the concluding spoken-word ramble ""Bad Day"", which feels more like a B-side toss off than a closing statement, and suggests Illinois will need more than just a few banjo plucks to establish their own singular personality. Still, amid the grand lineage of bands named after states, I'll take 'em over Texas or Kansas.","New from Ace Fu, this small-town Pennsylvania band has a banjo player as a frontman and makes its stock trade in Dust Bowl balladry.

Poly.sci.187,Mansbestfriend,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ae5e6ef95969321fee/1:1/w_160/c24acb2b.jpeg,2007-06-04 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10261-polysci187/,Anticon,"Like most of the Anticon roster he's helped curate, Tim Holland, aka Sole, is a rapper-as-slam-poet, purposefully eschewing hip-hop iconogrphy in lieu of abstruse, intellectualized streams-of-consciousness over cold, unforgiving beats. Alongside fellow Anticon artists and former tourmates, Holland's website links to a Noam Chomsky torrent site and a database for vegetarian recipes, echoing his persona as a loquacious lefty, with equal tendencies toward introspection and anti-capitalism. Holland's keen eye toward self-branding, however, led to the Mansbestfriend series, on which he allows himself a high degree of experimental latitude, free of the burden of his more established moniker. On Poly.sci.187, Holland takes what some might see as too large a step into new territory, however. He completely excises his own lyrics, substituting archival digital audio clips of religious conservatives, popular culture oddities, and political dissidents-- thus emerging, more or less, as a DJ Shadow for the Huffington Post set. Poly.sci came into being while Holland was touring Europe, a location doubly important for its geographic and ideological remove from the right-wing American political atmosphere. Fittingly, then, the record opens with ""Dedemma Speaks"", a bit of biographical role-play on which exiled early 20th century anarchist Emma Goldman is heard to say ""I will leave the country rather than deny my ideas."" An ominous, Endtroducing-style tableau underscores ""The Teachings of Leviticus"", over which a distorted female voice, culled from archive.org, recites bizarre anachronisms from the most politicized of Bible books, including: ""If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death. He must also kill the animal."" That the quote is not too dissimilar from something former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum actually said publicly is the song's most distressing element. Later, ""Spin the Humans"" begins with the voice of a young boy, snatched from YouTube, advocating for peace in Lebanon, then giving way to Poly.sci's best instrumental moment, an insistent, darkly rhythmic Middle Eastern groove. The title of ""Humans"" is clarified at the song's end, when Holland abruptly cuts in audio from an episode of ""Wheel of Fortune"" taped in the New Orleans Superdome, complete with over-excited, whooping American college students eagerly awaiting cash and prizes. As an attempted political manifesto, the jarring transition could certainly be regarded as binaristic, but it's also thought provoking and entertaining, which counts nearly as much with the milieu is Web 2.0 musique concrète. Holland devotes as much time for less political instrumental excursions as well, and with a good degree of success. ""Wilting Onward"", which he describes in the liner notes as emerging from ""a time period when I had basically gotten sick of the sound of my own voice and everything I have to say,"" surrounds a plaintive female vocal sample with menacing drums and increasing layers of fuzz, before segueing nicely into the dissonant, string-laden ambience of ""High Noon and Sobered"". ""Allieverwanted"" and ""Stuck in My Head Since I Was 12"" return to the old-school rap on which Holland was weaned, and late-album highlight ""Missile Defense"" is tumultuous drum-and-bass shoegaze. The Mansbestfriend series was inaugurated when Holland realized the potential of wholly computerized modes of production, and acquired its title from the nickname he gave his Mac G4. While Poly.sci might risk alienating the fervent fanbase he's built through his sui generis flow, it's still the most complete realization of his original impulse. More importantly, though, and to Holland's credit as a producer, Poly.sci proves that he can remove his signature musical element and still create a record that pushes many of the same affective buttons while moving out in unconventional directions. Rappers like Sole-- strident, politically and tech-savvy, Caucasian-- do share one linguistic affinity with the progressive activists they often strive to emulate: they often overspeak the boundaries of their chosen medium. The rap idiom, like the news media, operates most efficiently when filled with short, cadenced blurbs of sound; in this sort of environment, more potent messages can be delivered when the speaker himself pipes down and lets others do the talking.","Loquacious Anticon rapper Sole abandons his voice altogether on the latest release in the Mansbestfriend series, replacing it with politically-charged archival audio and re-emerging as a DJ Shadow for the Huffington Post set.

D-I-Y: Do It Yourself,Various Artists,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bc9d034d5c69bf48fc/1:1/w_160/90b1f35c.jpg,2007-06-04 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10275-d-i-y-do-it-yourself/,Soul Jazz,"In the late 1970s, making and releasing a record all by yourself could be framed as a revolutionary political gesture and a sign that you were busting out of the music business's cultural apparatus. The first record to come out of D.I.Y. as it's defined by this Soul Jazz compilation was also one of the first British punk records: the Buzzcocks' Spiral Scratch EP, represented here by the deathless ""Boredom"". But, of course, D.I.Y. wasn't a movement in the usual sense-- more like the parallel activities of a whole lot of bands who didn't fit in anywhere, and mostly didn't even have much of an affiliation with each other. Luckily for them, punk opened up possibilities for a lot of other kinds of misfit music to find some kind of audience, however small. The world could use a great one-disc survey of the UK do-it-yourself scene's early years, which the likes of Hyped2Death's Messthetics series have been documenting; unfortunately, this isn't it. For one thing, a definitive D.I.Y. compilation would have to include something by the Desperate Bicycles, who made their own process and ideology the subject of their best single, ""The Medium Was Tedium"". (The Desperate Bicycles have never permitted their music to be officially reissued; you can hear them with a little Googling, though.) For another, about half of D-I-Y is actually from records released by labels that weren't run by their artists, which muddies the point. It's more like a random sampling from the early years of independent distribution, which makes for more interesting reading than listening. And the album's chronological scope extends from 1977 to Red Lorry Yellow Lorry's 1986 instrumental ""Paint Your Wagon"", whose brittle, doomy crunch doesn't have much of an aesthetic relationship to, say, ""Boredom"". There seem to be a handful of compilations struggling to cut themselves loose from this disc: one of them might be comprised of icy, pasty Brit-funk (A.P.B.'s ""All Your Life With Me"", Glaxo Babies' ""Shake the Foundations"", Biting Tongues' ""You Can Choke Like That""), another devoted to Suicide-inspired electronics and ghostly dub throbs (the Naffis, Russ McDonald, Windows, Thomas Leer, Throbbing Gristle), another filled with poets and comedians who found that music was a better way to get people to pay attention (Artery, Patrick Fitzgerald, the ridiculous pre-Simply Red band Frantic Elevators). All that would be fine if D-I-Y worked as an album. But it doesn't, really, despite the presence of some extraordinary songs: Swell Maps' buzzbomb ""Let's Build a Car"", Blurt's monomaniacal headbutt ""The Fish Needs a Bike"", Kleenex's joyfully crude ""Ain't You"" (one of only two tracks here with women's voices), Scritti Politti's flutter-crawling dub mutation ""Skank Bloc Bologna"". The presence of the latter two is just a reminder of how much better Rough Trade's long-out-of-print Wanna Buy a Bridge? compilation, on which they both appear, documented the musical and historical moment this hints at. Everything on both that record and D-I-Y has its jagged edges, but Bridge fit them together into an improbable, luminous mosaic. This collection is just a pile of broken glass with some beautiful shards in it.","Soul Jazz offers a single-disc look at the late 1970s UK D.I.Y. movement-- at the time, a revolutionary political gesture.

Fort Nightly,White Rabbits,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c8ea9e61561daa6698/1:1/w_160/855ffe9e.jpg,2007-06-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10286-fort-nightly/,Say Hey,"Fort Nightly is that rare debut where potential isn't the operative word-- White Rabbits deliver the whole package straight away. The NYC six-piece writes great songs that merge rhythmic intensity with grandiose melodrama in a seamless and inventive package. Opening the album with a sinister left-handed piano riff, ""Kid on My Shoulders"" features steam engine drums that give the song's many hooks ample chance to sink in. It's a track that keeps getting catchier as it goes, ending with a choral coda that has a monumental sweep. Opening an album with a headrush like that will be a good strategy from now until humans finally wipe themselves out, but plenty of albums peter out after this kind of track. Fort Nightly doesn't-- thanks to the band's enormous bag of musical tricks. The piano, especially the lower octaves, is hugely important to a lot of the group's best tracks, though you might not realize it at first. It slots well into the band's big, spacious sound, and it helps ground the multi-layered vocals and keep the frequently surf-inspired guitars at bay. The piano also frequently adds what Duke Ellington once referred to as ""the Latin tinge""-- its lead on ""Navy Wives"" provides a tango accent to the song's subtle ska rhythm, one of many tracks that sport a major second-wave ska influence. As far as that's concerned, this band is a lot more Specials than Madness, keeping its content mostly dark and serious rather than jaunty and jovial. As important as the piano is, though, the band's biggest weapon is the vocals. The leads are strongly melodic, with just a slight gravelly edge, and the production puts them front and center without forgetting everything else. Around the lead vocals you get everything from doubling that simply fortifies the melodies to soft ""ooh-aah"" backing harmonies to weirdness like the freakish falsetto choir that pops up twice on of reggae-spiked ""March of Camels"", accompanied by a nicely funky staccato piano riff. The simple doubling on the fractured verses of the title track heightens the uneasy atmosphere created by the positively evil piano undertow and chunky march/funk drums. The song breaks out of the dark forest with a stately piano melody in the middle, only to be sucked back in again. Fort Nightly can be appreciated both for its overarching vibe and for minute details such as the very subtle, hair-raising organ part that perks up just long enough in the second verse of ""Dinner Party"" to shake the song out of its rhythmic comfort zone. It's a great debut for a band with an impressive, distinctive sound.","This NYC six-piece writes great songs that merge rhythmic intensity with grandiose melodrama in a seamless and inventive package.

Memory Almost Full,Paul McCartney,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ca13d197565213a50c/1:1/w_160/3b7394a6.jpg,2007-06-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10288-memory-almost-full/,Hear Music,"Paul McCartney is truly in a class of his own, but not always for the right reasons. The enduring cultural importance of his accomplishments-- and the fact that his private life still moves tabloids in the UK-- affords him a greater stature than your average classic-rock icon. His formidable bank balance suggests that his ongoing recording and performing career is motivated by something more significant than financial gain, but unlike fellow 60s survivors Bob Dylan and Neil Young, McCartney's senior years have not produced an album to challenge the notion that all his best work is decades behind him. He came close with 2005's mostly acoustic Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, a deliberate and welcome retreat to the homespun simplicity of his 1970 self-titled debut. But while Chaos may have been the best album of his post-Wings career, it still felt a touch too familiar to constitute a Time Out of Mind-style late-career surprise. You have to wonder if McCartney's unwavering dedication to maintaining his cheery, ""cute one"" persona negates the sort of sobering introspection that aging rockers often require to create revelatory, relevant albums in their sixties. That McCartney's latest album is being released through an exclusive retail agreement with Starbucks only serves to reinforce the most damning stereotypes about him: he's too safe, too typical, too square. And on first song ""Dance Tonight"" [video], he plays right to latte-swilling crowd, with an egregiously innocuous mandolin-folk hootenanny (""Everybody gonna dance tonight/ Everybody gonna feel alright"") custom-built to have his target demographic tapping along on the steering wheels of their Beemers. It's perhaps the least exciting, least arousing song about moving to music since Genesis' ""I Can't Dance"". But as Memory Almost Full plays out, you get the sense that by opening the album with this trifle, McCartney is perhaps intentionally pandering to those stereotypes, and that ""Dance Tonight"" could very well be a sitting-duck decoy for an album that turns out to be a lot more idiosyncratic than its coffee-chain marketing plan suggests. For one, McCartney isn't just writing love songs here; he's writing sex songs. Take the boudoir-bound white soul of ""See Your Sunshine"", which, if you can forgive the lame mad/sad/glad rhyme scheme, could be the smoothest (read: horniest) thing he's written. And if ""Only Mama Knows"" plays like a standard-issue rocker-- a less fun ""Junior's Farm"", to be exact-- it could be the first song he's written about trolling airport lounges for one-night stands. All of which would suggest that Memory Almost Full is Macca's post-Heather rebound album. As he insisted in last month's Pitchfork interview, his recent, media-saturated divorce proceedings had no bearing on the songwriting, much of which predates Chaos. However, at this stage in his career, one of the most daring things McCartney could do is show us that even the eternal thumbs-aloft optimist we see hamming it up at photo-ops and awards-show presentations can occasionally crack under the scrutiny. The stress seems to show on the opening line of ""Ever Present Past"" (""I've got too much on my plate/ Ain't got no time to be a decent lover"") but the song turns out to be just another reminiscence for the good ol' days, albeit with a perky new-wave rhythm that's almost novel enough to make you overlook the fact the song lacks a real payoff chorus. These songs comprise Memory's patchy first half, betraying the album's piecemeal recording process. But even these unremarkable turns are dotted with interesting production quirks (the tremolo-heavy guitar fuzz on ""Ever Present Past"", the foreboding string sweeps that bookend ""Only Mama Knows"") that suggest a more mischievous spirit lurking behind the pedestrian songwriting. Thankfully, McCartney's oft-overlooked eccentric streak is given freer rein on the album's second half, which feels far more cohesive and substantial thanks to an Abbey Road-like aversion to between-song gaps and an affinity for choir-like vocal effects that momentarily turns the enterprise into a Queen album. In particular, ""Mr. Bellamy"" rates as a worthy addition to his canon of stodgy-English-folk character studies, colored by baroque flourishes, baritone backing vocals and a coda reminiscent of the eerie, dying moments of ""Magical Mystery Tour"". McCartney can be guilty of tripping the light bombastic (see: the squealing guitar solos on overblown power ballad ""House of Wax""), but he also knows when to keep it lean and mean: ""Nod Your Head"" sounds like ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"" as remixed by Sonic Youth, a blues goof given a palpably more threatening edge by a spark-shower of abrasive feedback textures. Piano ballad ""The End of the End""-- an uncharacteristically somber meditation on looming death-- is being positioned as Memory's defining moment, but the obligatory string-section swells and a too-cute whistling solo detract from its affectingly melancholic melody. For a more honest portrait of Macca '07, look to Memory's best (and loopiest) song, the self-effacing retro-culture commentary ""Vintage Clothes"". The sprightly piano intro initially suggests a rewrite of Fleetwood Mac's ""Say You Love Me"", but its West Coast idyll is soon pushed askew by a skittering dub break and subliminal synth/bass frequencies; top it off with some vintage Wings-style harmonies and you've got a prog-pop triumph just waiting to be to covered by the New Pornographers. Sure, the song's opening salvo (""Don't live in the past"") is a bit rich coming from someone who still makes millions by singing 40-year-old songs in sports arenas. But for the two minutes and 21 seconds it takes for ""Vintage Clothes"" to traverse its shape-shifting universe, the sentiment rings true-- because the song proves that McCartney still knows the difference between just singing about the past and measuring up to it.","The living legend follows 2005's mostly acoustic Chaos and Creation in the Backyard-- a retreat to homespun simplicity-- with a Starbucks-issued record that turns out to be a lot more idiosyncratic than its coffee-chain marketing plan suggests.

Harmonium,Glös,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b3b1335d7bf169a171/1:1/w_160/bf68abbc.jpg,2007-06-01 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10265-harmonium/,Lovitt,"To their fans, Virginia's Engine Down were a rock band, a post-hardcore band, an anthemic indie band-- anything but an emo band. And it's true that a minor-key, Dischord-inspired edge balanced out their emotional evangelism. Nevertheless, in almost every Engine Down song, there came a point when Keeley Davis would launch into a rafter-shaking blare that was related to the guitars churning below it only by key. At these moments, you had to contend with the uncomfortable realization that you were listening to emo-- nth wave, suburban, mall-friendly emo. No one knows how Denali fans regarded Denali, because no one has ever met one. This isn't meant to be as snarky as it sounds-- in fact, Denali were pretty good. Maura Davis' pipes were even more imposing than her brother's (one imagines Richmond homeowners taping up their windows against high-decibel shattering when the Davis family went Christmas caroling), and Denali had a more nuanced style than Engine Down-- slinky and glacial, it was a sort of electrified lounge-noir. But Denali were that archetypal band that lacked memorable songwriting to bolster their cool sound. They were easy to like, but too compositionally effaced to love. After the demise of both bands, the Davis siblings reunited (with talented Engine Down drummer Cornbread Compton) as the power trio Glös, and their debut scans as a mature corrective to their juvenile excesses. This would explain any number of decisions on Harmonium that would seem to play against their established strengths. If you've spent your musical career recording vocals that absolutely crush everything else in the mix, then on your mature album, you might decide to filter them so heavily that they sound recorded via long-distance call. If both of your singers are known for scenery-chewing crescendos, then you might keep them low in the mix, seldom breaking free from their dusky minuet. And if you're smart, then you might retain the more winning characteristics of each band-- in this case, Engine Down's syncopated thrust and Denali's stripped-down smolder-- to create lean, sinewy dirge-pop of unexpected sophistication. If this approach sounds formulaic, it can be, and some songs on Harmonium seem to overcompensate for their creators' prior intemperance. These suffer from the Denali-syndrome: They sound good, but are difficult to distinguish from one another. The album opens with ""Unharmed""-- a reversed guitar figure launches a gritty, minor-key scrape contrasted by floating trebles, then collapses into a slashing grind that's somehow heavy and buoyant at once. The sound is enticing and specific to Glös, but plays out predictably over the next few tracks, which, while pinioned by crisp dynamic shifts, run together in a shadowy, glittering blur. This isn't true of the album's midsection, which profits greatly from a bit of stylistic variation. ""Telepathy"" uses a runaway jangle, elastic bass, and damaged guitar flourishes to drive home its potent vocal line, and ""Tainted"" is an album-stealing standout that crackles like a live wire, mostly because the Davis siblings capitalize upon the harmonic possibilities of their dual vocal prowess rather than tip-toeing around them. Singing two different vocal lines that tangle and then surge together amid thunderous percussion, their new sound comes into full flower, and the slight vocoder accents on Keeley's voice are surprisingly effective. Glös is already a more captivating idea than Engine Down or Denali, and they should only improve as they put more distance between themselves and those towering shadows.",,6.6,
Let in the Light,Shannon Wright,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ad5e6ef95969321fec/1:1/w_160/52a7de72.jpg,2007-06-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10260-let-in-the-light/,Quarterstick,"There is no more delicious experience as a music critic than being accused of sexism. It's a delight to hear via e-mail how your opinion on one particular album by one particular artist can be extrapolated to a worldview that favors the marginalization and stereotyping of an entire gender. This despite all my best efforts to avoid the common pitfalls of a community that continues to be dominated by male voices: no sexualized descriptors like ""chanteuse"" or condescending adjectives like ""cute,"" no allegations that there is a male Svengali behind the curtain, no commentary on how attractive (or un-) I find the artist in question. Yet all the same, I still feel pangs of guilt when I look at my music library and see the men outnumbering the women by a healthy margin. It's better than it once was, and two of my last three year-end favorites were bands with female singers, but the disparity remains undeniable, an easily interpretable manifestation of my personal taste. It doesn't help matters that recent indie rock trending, particularly the rise of coffee-shop folk, has pushed a lot of female artists in a rather dreary direction; in other words, there are a lot more Cat Powers these days than Sleater-Kinneys. Not that there's anything wrong with Chan Marshall, though her sparse and moody sound can very easily become too slick or too dilute in the wrong hands. Shannon Wright lives dangerously on this border throughout Let in the Light, sticking close to the usual guitar and piano-centric formulas and singing in a distinct but familiar low, raspy alto. The production skews twilight, the arrangements tend to be solo, and her lyrics bend towards the poetic and the metaphorical, with a couple maybe/maybe-not Dylan references thrown in for good measure. All par for the singer-songwriter course. Wright also drifts back and forth on the casual vs. formal axis, some tracks (""Defy This Love"", ""Steadfast and True"") built on recital-proper piano parts, while others (""When the Light Shone Down"", ""In the Morning"") shamble along at a sleepy pace and leave the edges rough. The fancier piano numbers are more unique, but also more restrictive: Wright composes pretty instrumental melodies with a classical flourish one rarely hears from a rock artist on ivory keys, but their complexity leaves little space for her voice to navigate, even in solo arrangements. With the guitar, the opposite tends to be true, as Wright's deliberate and mellow style calls out for some caffeine and mimes Girlysound-era Liz Phair a bit too closely. The coffee theory is borne out by the more strident tracks, which tend to be album highlights, especially in contrast to the majority melancholy. ""St. Pete"" is built on Wright's most jagged guitar part, and requires her to go beyond her currently-preferred whisper to a slightly snotty bellow more in line with her earlier full-band sound. That welcome snarl comes back on the choruses of ""Don't You Doubt Me"", where an unleashed drummer and two off-kilter guitars lend the tune a discomforting urgency, and the album-closing ""Everybody's Got Their Own Part to Play"", a triumphant piano-rock epic with an acidic underbelly. These flashes of menace amidst the hazier surroundings make me wish they were more frequent, that Wright still favored the toothier approach of her previous records. It's these harsher moments that separate her from the indie female singer-songwriter pack, a clique that seems increasingly drawn into the dreary hypnosis of heavy atmosphere and somnambulant tempo. Ah, but perhaps I shouldn't generalize.","On her latest Quarterstick release, this singer/songwriter's production skews twilight, the arrangements tend to be solo, and her lyrics bend towards the poetic and the metaphorical.

Everyday I Said a Prayer for Kathy and Made a One Inch Square,Wheat,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c29d034d5c69bf4904/1:1/w_160/4adf00e2.jpg,2007-06-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10280-everyday-i-said-a-prayer-for-kathy-and-made-a-one-inch-square/,Empyrean,"For years it seems Wheat fans have fallen into two camps. On one hand there are those who prefer the band's second album, 1999's Hope & Adams, which featured pop music sharply refined to its sleekest, simplest assemblage of elements: a riff, a verse, a chorus, a fade, not necessarily in that order. Minimalist to a fault, Hope & Adams sounded like it was made to be shed immediately: Its appeal continues to lie in its embrace of the ephemeral as transcendence. Then there are those who prefer Wheat's 2001 major-label debut Per Second Per Second Per Second...Every Second, which refines Scott Levesque's songwriting and finds him organizing his ideas within more traditional song structures. The result is a power-pop album that's more memorable than its predecessor-- but in this case, that's a neutral adjective. To fans of Hope & Adams, Per Second sounds too polished and radio-friendly, as if the band (or their label) were smoothing over their eccentricities for a spot on the Elizabethtown soundtrack, but to fans of Per Second, Hope & Adams sounds hopelessly obtuse, wasting its potential hooks on songs that seemed unfinished. Ostensibly, Wheat's fourth album, Everyday I Said a Prayer for Kathy and Made a One Inch Square, attempts to reconcile these two factions by giving musical weight to Levesque's songs while avoiding obvious pop structures. In doing so, however, it has the potential to alienate both camps: Toying with sound and rhythm, noise and melody, Square is less minimalist than Hope, more fractured than Second. It's the band's first record in nearly four years, during which time they were dropped from their label and long-time member Ricky Brennan departed. But Square is not a return to form, mainly because Wheat have never really had a set form to begin with. The songs on Square follow their own logic, as if Wheat are trying to make them move nonlinearly. After a burst of synth noise, opener ""Closeness"" sets up a wordy chorus that eventually gives way to a passage of ahooooo's that goes on about twice as long as you'd expect before returning to the main melody. ""Little White Dove"" ends with a lengthy coda that layers Levesque's vocals in a round with Brendan Harney's rolling snare. These songs always promise some sort of pop pay-off-- a supremely catchy hook, a buoyant riff, a momentous push-- but make a point of rarely delivering on it. Sometimes this tendency can be frustrating and even a little disingenuous on the band's part, as if Levesque and Harney are consciously holding back. As a result, Square sounds like an album lacking verses and choruses and comprised entirely of bridges. But Levesque and Harney aren't subverting listener expectations so much as they are ignoring them altogether, so the album's disjointedness, mostly comes across as playful, allowing each passage to stand on its own: the guitar fanfare on ""Init. 005 (Formerly, a Case of...)"", the high-hat-heavy beat on ""I Had Angels Watching Over Me"", the spoken insistences on ""An Exhausted Fixer"", the crack in Levesque's voice as he tries to hit the high notes on ""Saint in Law"". In a sense, these moments exist independently from one another, like the one-inch squares for Kathy that fill up the package design. By the middle of the album, the songs have grown almost collagistic, especially the pairing of ""Init. 005 (Formerly, a Case of...)"" and ""Saint in Law"", but they are merely an intermission before the reinvigorated rush of ""What You Got"" picks up the frayed pop threads again and carries it through to the instrumental closer ""Courting Ed Templeton"". Weaving through these moments is a larger story of loss, grief, and recovery, as if a single tragic event has inspired this album. Levesque constantly hints at it by flirting with lyrical cliché. The chorus of ""Move=Move"" seems to crib from Sting-- ""the things u love should be set free""-- but Levesque tempers it with a dose of realism-- ""The things u love can get off track/ Because everything don't come back."" On ""I Had Angels Watching Over Me"", the Hallmark-friendly title forms the basis of an uneasy conversation: ""I recall a friend said, I had angels watching over me/ I thought that they were making fun of me."" Levesque's dryly self-deprecating delivery makes the line register as a humbling joke. Fortunately, that story remains just under the surface throughout Square, where you can make out its shape but not its specifics. It's enough to give weight and direction to what otherwise might simply seem like separate one-inch squares of music.","Wheat's fourth album attempts to reconcile the divide between their sleek Hope & Adams and its more refined major-label followup by giving musical weight to Levesque's songs while avoiding obvious pop structures.

"Live From Austin, TX",Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c3c0084474cd0c1ce9/1:1/w_160/4be2e9af.jpg,2007-06-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10281-live-from-austin-tx/,New West,"For a live album to make sense, it needs to document a moment worth remembering. The recent tread toward ""instant live"" records epitomized the live album as concert memento, delivering freshly burned CDs into the hands of eager concertgoers mere minutes after a show's end. Other live artifacts seek to preserve a crucial moment in the performer's career, frozen in time (hopefully) with one's energy and excitement intact. This just-released document of a three-year-old Guided by Voices show-- part of New West's extensive Live From Austin, TX series-- is the concert album at its most mundane and frustrating, showcasing a perfectly fine performance by a very good band and nothing more. Guided by Voices never released a truly seminal live record, though the career-spanning live performances compiled as Live at the Wheelchair Races from the Hardcore UFOs box set come close. For the most part, GBV's extensive concert bootlegs are best described by phrases beginning ""the one where"" (i.e., ""have you heard the one where Bob gets drunk and asks whose dick he's gonna have to suck to hear something in the monitors?""). Sadly, this new 2xCD concert document seems like an average night out for late-era Guided by Voices. Making matters worse is the fact that the band's big live finale was already released in the form of the Electrifying Conclusion DVD. Two-and-a-half years after the band's breakup, Live From Austin evokes none of the poignancy of the band's beginning, middle, or end. The performances on Live From Austin are unerringly solid, and the setlist is characteristically thorough. The sound quality is not bad for a live show, though Bob Pollard's vocals tend to overpower everything else in the mix. As is often the case with live GBV recordings, the banter often outshines the music, starting when Pollard interrupts the crowd's chant of ""G! B! V!"" with ""sing it! Learn it! Know it!"" and then introduces ""Demons are Real"" slurred to sound kind of like ""Stevens are Real"". Highlights from the set include early favorite ""Pendulum"", ""Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)"" from the band's final album Half-Smiles of the Decomposed, and all the usual mid-period ""hits,"" played no better and no worse than usual. Pollard's trademark oddball sloppiness, coupled with the workmanlike
proficiency of his bandmates, does not necessarily make for an engaging long-term listening experience. If you've seen or heard a live GBV show from the group's final 10 or so years, you probably have a pretty good idea of how these songs are performed-- tight, energetic, entertaining, but often lacking the ineffable magic of the band's best work.","New West's extensive Live From Austin, TX series offers a three-year-old Guided By Voices concert that attempts to finally translate the group's on-stage power into a seminal disc.

Z,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ea5e6ef959693202c8/1:1/w_160/80b2d81f.jpg,2007-06-01 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10268-z/,Ecstatic Peace,"Everything is abbreviated on the Sunburned's Z, from the band's name on down. For their first full-length album on Ecstatic Peace, the collective typically (formerly?) known as Sunburned Hand of the Man have scaled back to become simply the Sunburned, and they have streamlined their sound as well, evidently in quest of an express route to extra-dimensional nirvana. Gone-- for the most part-- are the expansive tribal jams and creaky backwoods funk that characterized such top-notch Sunburned releases as Headdress or No Magic Man, replaced instead by a far more conventional noise-rock strategy. Regardless of what name they're traveling under, the Sunburned have continued to produce and release so many recordings that it becomes difficult to make any grand, sweeping announcements about any one individual album. But suffice it to say that Z definitely ranks among the heaviest and most No Wave-influenced artifacts in their prodigious catalog. As with many a noise act before them, John Moloney and company here seem to retreat to the squalling riff destruction of the Dead C or early Sonic Youth almost as if reverting to their natural default setting. And though the work they capture in this feral state makes for some fine bottle-smashing entertainment and plenty of ephemeral thrills and spills, Z remains one of the group's least distinctive releases to date and is so unlikely to reach ""go-to"" status in your already teetering Sunburned stack. Moloney has described Z as being an acknowledgment of ""infinity and the double dimension we all live in but don't fully understand."" With that in mind Sunburned have here designated each of the album's five tracks with an ascending number of infinity symbols. The first of these pieces commences with a brief snatch from one of the group's familiar pan-ethnic rituals, before suddenly dropping out-- with no further preamble-- into a maelstrom of distended noise. Beneath thick curtains of soaring feedback and amp distortion, Sunburned's elastic rhythm section rolls and roils through the album's first two tracks in continuous free-rock turmoil, their ramshackle psych-rock grooves recalling Acid Mothers Temple at their most fried. Sunburned pause for a brief gulp of brown oxygen on the album's third track, on which some of the collective's latent Butthole Surfers tendencies are allowed room to fester. As Moloney gibbers with an incoherent ecstasy, the guitars scribble mysterious figures on the cave walls as landmarks for future pilgrims. So rejuvenated, the collective is then ready to address the album's final two mammoth improvisations (that would be ""four infinity symbols"" and ""five infinity symbols""). On these long-winded tracks the group's sound mutates into increasingly unrecognizable forms, their squiggly blasts of analog electronics nodding more to Wolf Eyes and their disorienting ilk than to the group's own past wide-open cooperative ceremonies. As Z screeches to a close with the sound of a solo human voice electronically dilating into oblivion, perhaps the Sunburned are suggesting that in the face of such infinity, each of us must ultimately approach alone. Hopefully, however, this album does not indicate that on their path forward, SHotM will feel the further need to shed or otherwise abandon the potent communal narcosis that has carried them this far.",,5.8,
The Heart Is the Place,Goldrush,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a7b1335d7bf169a162/1:1/w_160/ae2029fe.jpg,2007-05-31 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10255-the-heart-is-the-place/,Better LookingTruck,"Oxfordshire's Goldrush never got their gold rush. Major-label debut Don't Bring Me Down came out to polite Coldplay comparisons in 2002, but that must not have been enough for EMI/Virgin. Subsequent releases, including 2003's Extended Play EP and their David Fridmann-assisted 2005 sophomore album Ozona, have trickled out on indie labels. Disappointingly, Goldrush's third proper full-length The Heart Is the Place sounds like the work of a band still rehearsing for Keane-level background-rock stardom. Around the internet, Goldrush's RIYL pretty much comes down to the melodic shoegaze of Ride plus the ringing folk-rock of Neil Young circa After the Gold Rush. Um, OK. Now, Goldrush probably know Ride better than I do; I may have listened to ""Vapour Trail"" nearly every day for six months back in 2003, but these guys backed ex-Ride frontman Mark Gardener on his 2005 solo outing. However, the glinting acoustic guitars, thinly compressed lead guitar whorls, and unobtrusive electronics of The Heart Is the Place have more in common with Snow Patrol's sensitive arena-rock, minus Gary Lightbody's underrated songwriting acumen. Nor is the stoned-Young piano homage of The Heart Is the Place's ""Yours and Mine"" enough to earn such a slick-sounding record a prominent spot in that Canadian's ragged lineage. Like similarly over-polished UK rockers Fields, Goldrush do have catchy moments. ""Every One of Us"" is a light, inclusive pop song that sets cleaned-up shoegaze cloudbursts against vaguely uplifting hooks and synthesized strings. ""We are not the way that we were/ She will forget about you, so forget about her,"" vocalist/guitarist Robin Bennett sings with breathy emotion, capping one of the band's more memorable melodies. The next track, ""Can't Give Up the Ghost"", may be a weeper reminiscent of Jimmy Eat World's dippiest ballads, but it's a candidate for the Zach Braff sweepstakes. ""If you're really so small/ In the scheme of it all/ Then you've gotta stand tall,"" Bennett insists. Goldrush get more compelling, if less immediate, on weirder songs like ""Sun in Your Eyes"", with its angelic harmonies and an eerie horn section out of Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"". The Heart Is the Place is the latest in the recent trend of EZ-indie albums that sound like they're trying so hard not to stand out that they, indeed, fail to stand out. Even the occasional distorted guitar solo, as on ""We Will Not Be Machines"", is still restrained enough to keep from alienating potential record-buying demographics. On this song and elsewhere, Bennett's lyrics are often so simple and declarative as to be meaningless: ""Words are sometimes so obscene,"" he sings. On the title track, Bennett adds, ""Maybe the best is yet to come/ Just you, me, and everyone,"" a line that could've been sung by, well, just about anyone. Then again, anyone can strike it rich in a gold rush, too, with the right amount of luck. It's what happens after that counts.","Oxfordshire band's third proper full-length sounds like the work of a band rehearsing for Keane-level background-rock stardom.

An Athens-based musician who also performs Celtic-tinged acoustic folk under her own name, she plays a number of instruments on Liar and the Thief, her debut as Tin Cup Prophette (which was released locally in early 2006 and is now getting a wider push), but the primary element on all her songs is the violin, which she loops and manipulates into a versatile range of sounds that coalesce into dark melodies and exotic rhythms. As it is for her male counterparts, this concept is a freeing innovation that allows Kapousouz to test the limits of her instrument and exert greater control over her music. In execution, however, Kapousouz-- who collaborated with Daniel Rickard of Parker and Lilly-- distinguishes herself from her loopy peers by eschewing both indie rock and art pop to mold her langorous strings into sharp beats and tense, decidedly urban mood music. Kapousouz's approach works best on ""Going Numb"", which begins with nervous plucks that form an unsettling staccato rhythm. Then come the Mike Oldfield-style bells, still suggesting otherworldly menace even nearly 35 years after The Exorcist, followed by a bassline and strings that have been manipulated to saturate the low end. Over this carefully textured backdrop, Kapousouz sings about her body emptying itself out, her voice sounding simultaneously desperate and distant, as if inhabiting some middle plane. The instruments each fall away, only to build back up for a dramatic push on the chorus. Overall, it's the most effective showcase for Kapousouz's loops and vocals and easily the most fully realized track on the album. Unfortunately, every other song on Liar and the Thief inhabits the same cramped, forbidding space as ""Going Numb"", but fails to capture the song's expertly calibrated dynamic. There are highs, of course: On the title track and ""80 Days"", her plucks and staccato bows coalesce into strict military beats, and elsewhere, longer notes add background dissonance, adding to the somber tension. With its low guitar and almost chirpy bells, ""Poster"" is a down-key song that places Kapousouz's layered vocals in an almost-live setting. But there are also many lows. As studiously experimental as her music is, Kapousouz's songs are uniformly, almost monotonously somber, with trip-hop beats that recall Sneaker Pimps more than Portishead. Those rigorously thudding rhythms create strictly regimented tempos that rarely change within or among the songs, and as a result, she has very little opportunity to alter her vocal delivery, as if she's stuck on tortured setting. As a result, her songs hit the same pained marks over and over, eventually blurring together into a slightly amorphous whole. Too carefully textured to be demos, the songs nevertheless sound like first stabs at a promising project.","Athens-based Amanda Kapousouz-- who also performs Celtic-tinged acoustic folk under her own name-- builds each of her songs around the violin, which she loops and manipulates into a versatile range of sounds that coalesce into dark melodies and exotic rhythms.

Perhaps there's nothing intrinsically original or even noteworthy about that combination, but the band-- which includes Martin Abrahamsson, Martin Hanberg, Anna Modin, and David Nygård-- puts a personal stamp on its music. Vapnet favor open-ended song structures that permit long instrumental passages and unexpected melodic twists, even though Abrahamsson and Hanberg typically write traditional verse-chorus patterns. In 2006, when Sweden seemed to produce great acts on a weekly basis, Vapnet's dense production and inventive arrangements made their full-length debut, Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar, a stand-out, one whose concept-- each song was named after a street in their hometown of Östersund (thanks to reader Fredrik for that info)-- helped to frame the music without constraining it. Något Dål**igt Nytt Har Hänt, their EP-length follow-up, isn't an epilogue to that album, but an expansion of its sound. Vapnet have obviously spent a lot of time in the studio since Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar, laboring over these new tracks and ambitiously filling each one with as many ideas as they'll hold. Fussiness becomes them: The music is polished without sounding slick, busy without sounding overloaded, and cerebral but warm. All those sonic details add up to a compelling, often exciting whole: On ""Släpa Hem Mig"", each softly percussive tone has been painstakingly sculpted to shift the accent from beat to beat. Opener ""Tjernobyl"" falls away for a few seconds of abrupt silence before its final verse-- it's both a dramatic pause and an intake of breath before the rush of melody. These studio elements mingle easily with the band's live instrumentation, striking a fine balance. Every track on Något dål**igt Nytt Har Hänt has its own signature instrument: Modin's flute plays a soft, simple theme on ""Tjernobyl"" that blossoms into something large and almost transcendent by song's end, and on ""Häll ihop"", Jens Lekman's baritone mingles with Per-Olof Stjernered's reedy saxophone over a subtle bossa nova-inflected beat. Abrahamsson's melodica glides across the shuffling dance rhythms of ""Tar Tillbaka Det"", shedding all of the instrument's connections with Damon Albarn. On ""Mera Om Varandra"", a choir of voices joins Hanberg on the final chorus, as if the EP has been secretly building to that moment all along, while Nygård's trombone provides a poignant denouement on the brief closer ""Tjernobyl (Repris)"". But nothing is as it seems with Vapnet. The band's name means weapon, yet their music sounds too upbeat and unabashedly enthusiastic to be threatening. The title Något Dål**igt Nytt Har Hänt even translates (roughly) to Something new bad has happened, but the songs betray no sense of doom, at least not musically. In fact, the obvious joy these musicians take in crafting such sophisticated, surprising songs has made them one of the most interesting bands in Sweden-- or anywhere else for that matter.","Swedish pop group follows its 2006 full-length debut, Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar, with an EP that expands on its predecessor's sound, coming across polished without sounding slick, busy without sounding overloaded, and cerebral but warm.

The Sun and the Moon,The Bravery,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b013d197565213a4e9/1:1/w_160/9c14d871.jpg,2007-05-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10263-the-sun-and-the-moon/,Island,"Like it or not, a lot of today's mainstream rock acts are resurrecting the lost art of the concept album to surprising degrees of success. While old staples like Nine Inch Nails or Red Hot Chili Peppers spiced up their recent twilight albums with the respective themes of apocalypse and love-via-music, newer groups have embraced the concept album to the point of self-reinvention. Take My Chemical Romance-- whose Welcome to the Black Parade LP's affinity for Queen-sized riffs and glam-rock pomp raised many elitists' eyebrows-- making Top 40 music more intriguing for an indie contingent long nauseated by the Linkin Parks and Nickelbacks of the world. Then there's the Killers, the synth-rock monoliths inexorably linked to Brooklyn parasites the Bravery. Although Hot Fuss served as the nefarious stem cell to the seemingly hundreds of new wave/post-punk revivalist clones-- the Bravery included-- Brandon Flowers & co. risked alienating their fanbase by swapping 80s icons on Sam's Town, replacing airy Duran Duran electro-pop with stone-washed Bruce Springsteen ethos. No matter how many prefabricated altercations Flowers and Bravery frontman Sam Endicott want to engage in, the latter can't deny his debt to the former: The Bravery's self-titled debut flourished in the new-wave niche carved out by the Killers. Unsurprisingly, the band now appears at a loss for a next move on their follow-up, The Sun and the Moon, jilted by a dance-rock scene that's grown less and less forgiving with every soulless, four-on-the-floor wannabe anthem. To understand what a failure of a record this is, you have to consider the few redeeming qualities of the band's self-titled debut. Despite its shameless Cure copping, ""An Honest Mistake"" left open the possibility of the band becoming a jaded, Americanized Franz Ferdinand, while ""Fearless"" and ""No Brakes"" flashed subtler, smarter synth and basslines than nearly anything on Hot Fuss. However, seeking to now eschew their blatant touchstones, the band strips down to a more guitar-based mush not beholden to any one or two specific influences, but remains shockingly unoriginal nonetheless. Modern rock fixture Brendan O'Brien mans the boards here, spackling the band's sound with as much fluff and plastic as his early 90s records had grunge and feedback. First single ""Time Won't Let Me Go"" candy-coats Endicott's slit-wrist pathos, wrapping sunny organs and Coldplay-style reverb riffs around the frontman as he bitches about how dreary life was before he became a fabulous rock star: ""I never had a summer of '69/ Never had a Cherry Valance of my own/ All these precious moments you promised me would come in time."" As annoying as Endicott's mascara-tainted bellyaching was on the Bravery's debut, his histrionics-for-the-masses commandeer the group's stylistic direction on The Sun and the Moon, cheapening already trite regurgitations of Robert Smith confessionals by bloating them to anthemic proportions. ""Every Word Is a Knife in My Ear"", an utterly unsexy, castrated version of ""Take Me Out"", wouldn't even be plausible as a sticker on a goth teenager's bookbag-- let alone as a relatable relationship grievance. Even worse, ""Tragedy Bound""-- the album's stab at a tearjerking, showstopping acoustic ballad amidst a barrage of smug one-liners and putdowns-- follows the traditional Britpop formula for lamenting female depravity, right down to Endicott occasionally lapsing into a mopey British accent. There was a time when the most desperate of NME apostles could argue that the Bravery had simply been victims of indie elitists' version of McCarthyism. After all, Razorlight, the Killers, and any number of other hacks hailed as part of a dance-rock revolution by the notorious British tabloid had heated purists' blood to a boiling point, practically guaranteeing the Bravery as DOA when their debut hit. However, The Sun and the Moon-- an album content to find hooks with the least resistance, to place the last 10 years of indie rock in a blender, and try to foist that gruel as something novel, to offend the very art of rock'n'roll-- vindicates even those extremists who practically urged to blacklist this band. Have you no sense of decency, Bravery?","The Bravery's self-titled debut flourished in the new-wave niche carved out by the Killers, but on follow-up The Sun and The Moon, the band appears at a loss for a next move, jilted by a dance rock scene that's grown less and less forgiving with every soulless, four-on-the-floor wannabe anthem.

Tromatic Reflexxions,Von Südenfed,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0c0c0084474cd0c1ce5/1:1/w_160/4545cc06.jpg,2007-05-31 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10279-tromatic-reflexxions/,Domino,"Huh? That was my first response, in late 2004, when I saw that Mark E. Smith had lent his signature talky vocals to two remixes of Mouse on Mars' ""Wipe That Sound"" for a 12-inch. His pinched rants ripped apart the sugary pop buzz that Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma had conjured on the MES-free original version, which had appeared a few months earlier on the duo's Radical Connector LP. They'd taken all that time to assemble dense tracks and memorable hooks, and Smith sounded like he'd just stumbled in off the street to grouchily announce whatever random thoughts happened to pop into his head. Though Mouse on Mars had been enjoying a bump in popularity at the time, owing to their recent turn to pop, no one seemed to pay much attention to that single. It seemed reasonable to write it off as a joyless dead-end experiment and nothing more. So it comes as something of a surprise now that Mouse on Mars and Smith apparently found the one-off inspiring enough to record an entire album together. Tromatic Reflexxions, their (first?) full-length, reflects the general tenor of that original collaboration, even featuring one of the ""Wipe That Sound"" remixes in a slightly different form, and retitled ""That Sound Wiped"". Somehow, even though ""That Sound Wiped"" sounds just OK, the ideas presented actually gain some cumulative force as they're hammered at again and again over 48 minutes. In this way, the record operates something like a Fall album, wearing you down with its relentless energy. Some have noted that Von Südenfed occasionally sounds like Smith is knocking back at the early LCD Soundsystem singles, on which he'd been such a clear influence, and opening track ""Can't Get Enough"" is probably the reason for the comparison. St. Werner and Toma have crafted a crunchy, bouncy beat with a bassline not terribly far from ""Losing My Edge"", and of course, Smith carries on like the scenester-baiting O.G. that he is. It's a solid kickoff that also lays out the project's tight parameters: Its grooves are harsh and noisy, often stuttering about in strange ways, and they strike a strong contrast to the accessible pop tendencies of Mouse on Mars' clubbier recent material. Meanwhile, Smith's voice is slathered in reverb, EQ'd to give it midrange-only bite, and occasionally chopped into bits and inserted where its abrasion can be best felt-- the sonic equivalent of a pebble in a shoe. The first eight songs stick closely to this template with slight variations, like a catchy chorus hook (""The Rhinohead"") or a ridiculously broken beat that seems to bypass your hearing entirely and head straight for the fragile equilibrium maintained by your inner ear (""Serious Brainskin""). It's a weird stretch of music, sometimes exciting, but also oddly monotonous-- especially considering the tightly packed and maximal approach to sound-- and ultimately a little draining. They finally decide to mix things up a bit during the album's last quarter. ""Chicken Yiamas"" begins with acoustic guitars playing some mutant blues. Smith says something about a yardbird and how he has two bones, but there must be something about those drumsticks because he ululates wildly, sounding more energized than at any other moment on the record. ""Jback Lois Lane"" is mostly just a goof, a field recording dominated by a lawnmower as Smith speaks to someone only partly coherently in the middle distance. This leads to a bubbling tune with a vaguely West African guitar line and plenty of slide. Smith sounds like he's having a lot of fun by now, and his rhythmic feel is completely on as he negotiates the groove with strategically elongated vowels. How did we get here? What does this all add up to? Hard to say. Tromatic Reflexxions sounds like three guys having a great time ignoring whoever might be asking these questions.",,7.0,
Reflector,Antelope,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a9b1335d7bf169a164/1:1/w_160/62fbd84a.jpg,2007-05-30 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10256-reflector/,Dischord,"Throughout most of its lifespan, Dischord Records has trafficked almost exclusively in big, bruising, anthemic post-punk. Many of its best artists (Fugazi, Nation of Ulysses, Circus Lupus) approached transcendent outrage in oblique and radically different ways, but they all sounded larger than the sum of their parts. In the past few years, bands such as Q and Not U and Black Eyes drank deep from a more tourettically rhythmic form of rage, but it's been rage just the same. D.C. punk bands, however, rarely last for more than an album or two, and both of those bands have already broken up; the only surviving band from Dischord's mid-90s peak is Lungfish. In recent years, the label has gone small, releasing a string of records that look inward as much as outward, like the two prettily hushed albums by Ian MacKaye and Amy Farina's Evens. And now they've got Antelope, a trio who's muted restraint often prevents them from writing songs that even resonate as songs, let alone anthems; draw from that whatever conclusions you like about the state of American post-punk. Reflector is Antelope's first full-length, if you can call a 10-song, 25-minute CD a full-length. It might be the cleanest-sounding record that Dischord has ever released-- or at least since that last Fidelity Jones album. Everything is restrained and minimal: the flinty and trebley guitar lines, the clearly enunciated vocals, the tick-tock pulse-drums. Sometimes, that cold sparseness serves the band well, as on the opening title track, which marries a glimmering motorik bassline to a gorgeously longing vocal from former Vertebrate Bee Elvy. Other times, it results in annoying messes like the obnoxiously monotonous ""Contraction"", which manages to be harsh and choppy without building up the slightest hint of catharsis and which seems way longer than its two-and-a-half minutes. Eventually, a pattern emerges. The band splits its vocal duties between two poles, with Elvy's melodious coo sharing space with the violent adenoidal honks of fellow former Vertebrate Mike Andre and former El Guapo and Supersystem member Justin Moyer. (Andre and Moyer's vocals sound so alike that this review originally credited all of them to Moyer.) When Elvy sings lead, the songs are usually slight, diffuse, supple and pretty little trifles of kraut-psych wonder. When Moyer or Andre sings lead, the tracks begin to sound like a fourth-grader making fun of you. In Supersystem, Moyer's nasal yawp was put to good use, bouncing around in that band's sometimes-glorious, always-furious dancepunk clutter. In Antelope's geometric openness, though, that voice has nowhere to hide. Tracks like ""Justin Jesus"" sound informed by Lungfish without actually rocking at all, a hard thing to pull off, and his lyrics tend toward inscrutable bullshit: ""Pisces in the breach/ An elemental monument to mirth/ A psychic stand/ Three-fingered hand."" And so Reflector is a curious document of a band at a crossroads. Right now, they're half of a good band. If they let Elvy take over completely, they could blossom into a melting mountain of gooey beauty. If Moyer and/or Andre takes control, they'll march onward toward unlistenability. And if they continue to split duties, they'll keep churning out slight and half-decent albums like this one. Knowing D.C., though, they'll probably break up before moving in any of those directions.","This Dischord trio-- which features former El Guapo and Supersystem member Justin Moyer-- offers a muted debut that could be the cleanest-sounding record that the legendary D.C. label has ever released.

It Had Wings,Feltbattery,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09cea9e61561daa6658/1:1/w_160/eed07c78.jpg,2007-05-30 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10244-it-had-wings/,Migration Media,"Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori pioneered the theory of the ""uncanny valley."" It holds that humanoid robots produce positive emotional responses in humans both up to a certain point of realism (the ""barely-human"") and after utter realism has been achieved. The gray area in between is the uncanny valley, a level of not-quite-realism that produces feelings of unease. Think wax mannequins and lifelike yet gesturally stilted automatons, how they seem to question fundamental boundaries of the human. The natural history museum-- especially the small-town variety that get by on ingenuity more than funding, where cavemen, Native Americans, flora, and fauna are frozen in glass-encased, fluorescent-lit pantomime-- resides in the uncanny valley of humanity's relationship to nature. Feltbattery's homemade sound art is the natural history museum in a recorded format. In the small North Carolina town of Hillsborough, Benjamin Trueblood and friends run birdsong, minimal percussion, humming voice, flute, recorder, and charango (a small South American lute) through pedals and laptops, arranging them in long, cycling loops. While the skewed natural representations of It Had Wings produce a lingering eeriness, their beatific phrasing undercuts their sense of unease. Here are some excerpts from the Feltbattery blog: ""Spring is creeping in, soggy toes and green everywhere...I've been paying attention to the colony collapse situation with our friends the bees and listening to the forest with all my little second graders. So much life and so much death...Incidentally, the house finches that inspired the piece 'a house finch' on It Had Wings have returned to nest in the rafters of my porch. I am going to try to record them again and perhaps make a video..."" The reverent attention writ large in these musings is what makes Feltbattery's compositions resonate more broadly than their minimal sound palettes would seem to merit. On a subconscious level, art retains the aura of the work that went into it, and pragmatically, Trueblood's diligence has produced a compositionally sly album that works equally well as one long arrangement or eight discrete movements. Each track is dominated by a handful of repetitive rhythmic elements and a mood; a hypnotic continuity is achieved largely by holding over one element of the previous track in each new one. So leaving behind the twittering nest of ""Birds Flew"", squiggly flutes plunge into the insistent rhythm and thickly textured ratcheting sounds (rather like something snorting and rooting in turf) of ""Meganser (Hooded)"". The flutes, shakers, and rooting sounds are rounded out by burbling hand percussion, woodland chatter, and cicada chirrs on ""Mock Influenza"", and the chirring bends into a high insectile whine amid the amplified beat of wings, insistent metallic percussion, and loopy vocal harmonies with jarring rhythmic squawks of ""Garuda"". The spiraling squawks gradually overtake the track and become the foundation of ""Split the Polygon"", then sporadically reappear throughout the monastic drones and graceful, chuffing fans of ""A House Finch"", which works itself into a gently convulsive electrical storm. The final two tracks are a digest of the record's motifs, making for an understated crescendo, and It Had Wings ends with the snore of something that sounds large, something that, despite the record's placidity, one hopes will not wake up. Such ominous notes occur throughout Trueblood's idyllic meditations, and paired with the album's almost-natural affect, it renders his valley an uncanny place indeed.","Benjamin Trueblood and friends create naturalistic sound art by running birdsong, minimal percussion, humming voice, flute, and recorder through pedals and laptops.

Dear Companion,Meg Baird,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a5b1335d7bf169a15b/1:1/w_160/7e8be8bd.jpg,2007-05-30 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10253-dear-companion/,Drag City,"At the tail end of last year, Espers' Meg Baird released Leaves From Off the Tree, a collection of traditional English and Appalachian folk songs recorded in a trio with British singer Sharron Kraus and her Espers bandmate Helena Espvall. Casting aside Espers' baroque psychedelia and hushed electricity, Baird and her friends showcased a breathtaking affinity for this traditional material with their spare, homespun arrangements and bracing vocal harmonies. The relaxed atmosphere and spirit of that album now shines through again on Dear Companion, Baird's captivating new solo collection of traditional ballads, unlikely covers, and well-crafted originals. Recorded in her Philadelphia attic apartment between sessions for Espers II, the album features Baird using only her voice, guitar, and/or mountain dulcimer. For these deeply intimate recordings, Baird has clearly chosen songs that she knows inside and out, and is so able to treat each with an overriding empathy and affection. Her faith in this material helps give Dear Companion its easy air of self-assurance, but most often it is her astonishing voice that draws the attention. At once delicate and earthy, Baird's vocals sound naturally suited to the purpose of breathing fragile new life into these romantic tales of love gained and lost, as she firmly stakes a claim in the folk lineage alongside such 60s-era artists as Shirley Collins or Anne Briggs. Two of the traditional songs on Dear Companion--"" The Cruelty of Barbary Allen"" and ""Willie O'Winsbury""-- also appeared in different versions on Leaves From Off the Tree. And Baird's stunning performances here amply illustrate several of the reasons why these ballads have been among the most frequently re-interpreted (and dissected) folk songs of the past few centuries. Outfitted with their simple, eternal melodies, each of these songs frames a deceptively oblique romantic narrative that is open to enough analysis and interpretation to fuel a full semester's gender studies curriculum. (Poet and scholar Robert Graves, for example, once even speculated that the poor misunderstood Barbary Allen was in fact practicing witchcraft and murder.) For her part, Baird wisely chooses to let these songs speak for themselves, delivering them simply with a thoughtful, meditative air of eyewitness. Although several of these traditional ballads do feature some anachronistic imagery and language--including the occasional reference to kings, maidens and lords-- Baird is careful to balance the album with several tracks of more modern origin, skillfully blurring the distinction between the various vintages. The infidelity and loss of the title track--an old Appalachian folk song--is mirrored almost exactly on Baird's stoic version of Jimmy Webb's ""Do What You Gotta Do"", a song perhaps most memorably associated with Nina Simone. And Baird strikes the album's most sensuous note with her cover of ""Waltze of the Tennis Players"", which was originally written and recorded by the obscure 70s folk act Fraser & Debolt. ""My love for you is an overnight sensation,"" she sings in a seductive near-whisper, a sentiment which surely echoes the thoughts that fans of exquisitely wrought folk music will have for this lovely and enrapturing album.","Espers singer offers another solo collection of traditional ballads, unlikely covers, and well-crafted originals.

Silverfish Trivia EP,Robert Pollard,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0acc0084474cd0c1cb9/1:1/w_160/94ab863d.jpg,2007-05-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10259-silverfish-trivia-ep/,Prom Is Coming,"When Robert Pollard disbanded GBV, but announced he still intended to record, the big question was: ""...then why bother?"" Pollard was the obvious creative center of the group, to the point that, particularly in the later years, many considered GBV little more than a revolving door (which isn't very fair to guitarist Doug Gillard, among many others). What would be the point of continuing under his own name? Another EP from Pollard is hard to get excited about considering the deluge around it, but it's a good time to stop and address that earlier question of why. Having released a good chunk of material in the two years since disbanding GBV (you expected anything less?) with collaborative partner Todd Tobias as producer, we're finally getting an answer-- and you might not like it. The uncertain sound of the ""record"" button being pressed couldn't be more comforting at the top of opener ""Come Outside"", and the string section that follows couldn't sound simpler or sweeter. A promising, wordless start, but these interludes are bookends on mostly predictable material. While the final moments ""Circle Saw Boys Club"" has an unexpected escalation into grandeur, and ""Touched to Be Sure"" features the disc's most memorable melody, both tracks are ponderous, sluggish, and smothered in easy-atmosphere background synthesizers. Fortunately, the whole of the EP is much more diverse, with the aforementioned bookends and interludes that push Pollard out of his comfort zone. There's the warm organ drone of ""Wickerman Smile"" and the instrumental ""Waves, Etc."", with keyboards that'd be comfortable on an Angelo Badalamenti soundtrack or (more likely) a Circus Devils album. And then there's the eight-minute ""Cats Love a Parade"", which follows much the same pattern as ""Boys Club"" or ""Touched"", before taking a left turn into a near-industrial lurch halfway through, while Pollard adopts a husky, creepy tone and repeats the song's strange chorus at length. These three songs together suggest similar tones to Pollard's recent Merge albums, but with higher compositional ambition that approaches his traditional DIY stadium-rock from another angle. The variety represented here isn't just reassuring, it's badly needed. And while it's not surprising that the Pollard/Tobias partnership might return to the well and draw inspiration from their material together as the Circus Devils, to take their more synth-oriented work and add a dash of Pollard's everyman guitar strums and his newly acquired sensitive bleat to create flowery adult-contempo pap-- this isn't a road I want to follow him down. Perhaps he'll continue to stretch his compositions, but if the choice is between ""Circle Saw Boys Club"" or the strange ambitions of ""Cats Love a Parade"", I choose door number three.","The latest self-released Robert Pollard record is an EP that occasionally finds the former GBV leader pushing himself out of his comfort zone.

Unbreakable (A Retrospective),The Afghan Whigs,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b7ea9e61561daa6681/1:1/w_160/c6b9842f.jpg,2007-05-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10270-unbreakable-a-retrospective/,Rhino,"There's about eight years between the first and second tracks on Unbreakable (A Retrospective), immediately revealing how much the Afghan Whigs developed over a decade, what was gained in the process, and what was lost. Opener ""Retarded"", from 1990's Up In It, a lo-fi maelstrom of raw, threatening guitars, introduces the band's defining elements: the knife-fight between guitar players Greg Dulli and Rick McCollum, soul and funk melodies ratcheted to aggressive tempos, and Dulli's in-character performance (""Motherfucker lied to you,"" he snarls), which detractors would label ""posturing"" throughout the 1990s. Following ""Retarded"" is ""Crazy"", from the band's 1998 swan song 1965; it's slicker and more controlled, dialing down its tempo and filling its empty spaces with ""Soul Finger""-style party chatter, yet sacrificing not one iota of menace. Unbreakable, a best-of collection that democratically gathers tracks from every facet of the band's career, along with two newly recorded songs, is a sort of last laugh. Despite their stature today (there's a 33 1/3 book on Gentlemen in the works), the band-- and especially Dulli-- were largely neglected during the 1990s, relegated to second-tier status behind alt- bands such as Live, Alice in Chains, and Candlebox. Formed in Cincinnati in 1986 and defunct by 2001, the Afghan Whigs were one of the few alt- bands to flourish on a major label, where greater control and bigger budgets allowed them to indulge every sinister urge. While alternative rock radio still sported untucked flannel, the Whigs looked dapper in all black or tailored suits. When popular music was at its most studiously PC, the Whigs emphasized the sexual, and Dulli played power-struggle games that many read as misogynist. While their peers could barely see past the Who, the Whigs were digging through the Stax Records catalog and covering the Supremes (""Come See About Me"" is included here). Even on their early tracks, the band found a way to integrate African-American sounds and influences into their white rock: ""Turn on the Water"", from 1991's Congregation (whose album cover infamously features a nude black woman holding a white baby, no less) uses Isaac Hayes' wakka-chikka guitars as a punk accessory, and its jumpy guitar riffs instill these songs with a sense of motion that suggests amped-up r&b. Black Love, the band's 1996 blaxploitation-rock epic, should have been the culmination of this trend, but in 1996 it sounded overdone and obvious. Unbreakable, however, reveals Black Love to be a closet singles album, fitting three still-visceral songs into the tracklist but making ""Blame Etc."" and ""Honky's Ladder"" the most glaring omissions. With more dry wit and intelligent frustration than was often recognized, Dulli's lyrics were also intensely personal in their intimate sadomasochism, to the extent that he invited Scrawl's Marcy Mays to sing ""My Curse"" on Gentlemen because he couldn't bring himself to do it (nor could the producers include it here). Taken at face value, though, Dulli's songs made him out to be an asshole, so that's what people assumed he was. And he likely played that up, too. But on Unbreakable, the hyperbolic tension of his lyrics plays as an amplification of his own angst, not as a one-to-one projection. He wasn't necessarily the people he sang about, but they were certainly part of him. The leering threats of ""Be Sweet"" and ""66"" might best be read as useful exaggerations. And yet, Dulli's voice wavers on the quieter, slower numbers. He misses notes on ""Faded"", muddles his phrasing on the new track ""Magazine"", but never self-censors. He lets the moment stand, powerful in its imperfection, the sound of someone trying to convey overwhelming inner conflict. At a time when many bands strained to project anguish, Dulli kept his performances as raw as the hurt he's singing about. The two newly recorded tracks-- the band's first since their break-up in 2001-- are surprisingly strong, picking up pretty much where 1965 left off. It's nice to hear McCollum's guitar slicing at Dulli again and Curley's bass trying to break them up. After the military grunts that count off ""I'm a Soldier"", the band launches into a massive gospel assault that prominently features Memphis vocalist Susan Marshall (who also appeared on 1965), as if they had the audacity to rewrite ""Gimme Shelter"" with a three-note chorus and cagier lyrics. Written shortly before the band split six years ago, ""Magazine"" begins as a slow ballad, but builds into something more angular, lacking a hook but still intriguing. Rather than presenting these songs chronologically-- starting with their earliest Sub Pop singles and ending with their newly recorded tracks-- Unbreakable is sequenced more organically and intuitively, mixing together songs from each phase of their career so that they comment on one another. Ultimately, the tracklist comprises a larger, self-mythologizing narrative-- culminating in the sweeping drama of ""Crime Scene Part One"" and ""Faded"", both from Black Love-- that fits well with the Whigs' album-as-song-cycle approach. Unbreakable is one of those rare career compilations that shows its subject in a new and immensely flattering light, with the potential to clear up past misperceptions and to reveal vast complexities that were previously overlooked.","This best-of collection democratically gathers tracks from every facet of the band's career along with two newly recorded songs, and it acts as sort of a last laugh for a group unfairly maligned throughout much of the 1990s.

In DeWiit's soon-to-be extinct former band, the drummer/multi-instrumentalist busted his ass to keep up with PGMG's breakneck tempos and swirling melodies. Night Canopy must feel like a retirement home for DeWitt by comparison, as he peppers Blaschke's easy-does-it folk numbers with innocuous instrumental texture. Of Country and Honey essentially sounds like a singer-songwriter solo album that scored a primo arranger in DeWitt. Blaschke's moody tales of love won and love lost take center stage here, even if that means downplaying the rest of the band. At her best, Blaschke writes gnarled folk songs able to conjure the haunting demons her previous-- and blander-- solo material could only allude to with cheap lyrics. At her worst, she sounds like backwater from Saddle Creek, her vanilla dirges plodding about as forgettably as Maria Taylor, the tempo, at times, even slower somehow. Hopefully, as the album's schizo nature suggests, Blaschke is at a crossroads stylistically and not entirely wedded to this ""Home on the Range""-sounding filler. As with nearly every ""tortured"" singer-songwriter these days, publicity releases and half-assed write-ups will throw out Elliott Smith comparisons. In reality, neither Blaschke's depression nor dementia can hold a candle to something like Either/Or, though her country-tinged catatonic despair echoes more recent acts Cat Power or Broadcast. ""Signs of Life"" bucks the linear songwriting found on most of Of Honey and Country, with a creepy organ and clanging percussion burying Blaschke's distant vocals. Even further out in left field, the 80-second French number ""Elle Etait"" recalls Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot's collaborations, explosively jumping from one melodic idea to another at the sound of a massive cymbal crash or squealing violin. These avant-garde tracks are exceptions, however, as most of this album falls within the conventionality of an open mic at Starbucks. Opener ""Seasick Casanova"" very acutely forecasts the album's low-lying goals. Kicking off with a hokey ocean wave sound effect, Blaschke's songwriting colors too perfectly within the lines, content with lullaby-level complexity. Even more disappointing, Blaschke doesn't sound engaged in her own songs, even with a ripe title like ""Seasick Casanova"". On stripped-down tracks like ""Tell Me You Been Lyin'"" and ""Double or Nothing"", DeWitt gets sent on an apparent bathroom break, spotting Blaschke's acoustic ditties with little more than some keyboard or (seriously) chirping bird sound effects. Except for some brief, urgent outbursts, Blaschke's charisma could use a jumpstart-- or at least DeWitt could take the heat off with something more scintillating than his quaint, table-setting accompaniments. Hopefully Night Canopy's still a project very much under construction, a team-up that just hasn't found its chemistry, because as their default songs reveal, the band's got its fair share of kinks to work out.","Seattle singer-songwriter Amy Blaschke joins forces with multi-instrumentalist and arranger Nick DeWitt from Pretty Girls Make Graves for an album of gnarled folk dirges.

Blasts of Holy Birth,Lewis & Clarke,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b083c0084474cd0c1c71/1:1/w_160/b083081e.jpeg,2007-05-29 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10224-blasts-of-holy-birth/,La Société Expéditionnaire,"Lewis and Clarke, fronted by singer-songwriter Lou Rogai and here helped by Eve Miller of Rachel's and Russell Higbee of Man Man, have for several years quietly glorified the sound of strings. This second full-length is a pared-down complement to 2005's blues-inspired Bare Bones and Branches. Blasts of Holy Birth is at times cloying, weepy, and overly familiar, but at others it's a naturalistic vision that creates a hunger for some the simple, rural images conjured by the instruments. Sometimes words get in the way, as on ""We Think We Have Eyes"", a song thick with a generalized guilt and self-awareness. Greed is a perfectly apt subject from a ruminative musician, but the lyrics here are delicately trampled upon, potentially forgettable and incidental, perhaps because Rogai's voice has all the force of a light breeze. While his tone complements the soothing guitar and occasional cello, it's less successful as the carrier of a message. Still, the song's undulating chorus recalls the rare beauty of Matt Pond PA, who's also a contributor here. Rogai's lyrical dive-off just before this moment is perfectly executed, the words punching out their meaning in time to the strings. Tara Jane O'Neil has a command of atmosphere similar to Lewis & Clarke, the way she showcases the string family without overindulging how instinctively of the land they are. The wandering slides and sixth chords on the opener ""Secret of the Golden Flower"" are a reminder of this respectful approach, where a very simple grouping of sounds are pushed to their limits with a few effects. The mystical, natural homages in Rogai's vision are conveyed, though our notion of what exactly the ""golden flower"" is remains vague. The following title track is less successful, its sweet sap and lullaby rhythm too predictable, the instruments too obedient to the typical progressions. But at nearly seven minutes, it's not all dross: the quiet moments (plucks) and loudest (shimmying ascents) are fairly interesting. The runaway road-trip ballad ""Comfort Inn"" is a little too Ray LaMontagne, with vocals turned up and guitar plucks skittering around the song's hollow, empty room. The contrast it makes to ""Black Dove"" and to the final track, ""Be the Air We Breathe"", actually bolsters them all -- to shift from this man-and-guitar stereotype to the gorgeous summit of ""Breathe"" is a worthy journey. ""Breathe"" is where Rogai realizes the most redeemable elements of his other tracks: little alterations of typical chords, locomotive but understated drums, a forceful but controlled rhythm, and several layers of string dialog. ""Black Dove"" works with similar success, with more thunderous guitars evoking an idealized environment that's unplugged, untouched, and unspoiled.","For his second full-length, guitar connoisseur Lou Rogai invites members of Man Man and Rachel's for an evocative set of pieces that sing loudest when the vocals desist.

Poste e Telegrafi,Alessandro Stefana,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09d9d034d5c69bf48cd/1:1/w_160/3ec9a515.jpg,2007-05-29 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10245-poste-y-telegrafi/,Important,"Italian guitarist Alessandro ""Asso"" Stefana has gall. For his solo debut, Poste e Telegrafi, Stefana treats his guitar like a quarter-piece of the puzzle. He collaborates with six people and avoids the guitar altogether on two of these seven tracks. He alternately employs the 1980s electronics artifact the omnichord, a ""strings machine,"" various African percussion instruments, and vinyl loops to build intricate, subtly shaped substrates for his meticulous, twang-redolent guitar fantasies. Largely because it avoids the solo guitar record template, Poste e Telegrafi is one of the most striking works you'll hear from a young composer all year. It's not as if Stefana is hiding anything. His guitar playing is graceful and dexterous, his fluid phrases are precise without feeling stiff. He's not trying to make himself sound better by playing with slouches, either. The cast here includes guitar maverick Marc Ribot, Italian songwriter Marco Parente, and Brian Eno/Nick Cave collaborator Leo Abrahams. But of special interest is Ribot, who's spent the past two decades planting six-string sparks in albums like Tom Waits' Rain Dogs, Richard Buckner's Devotion & Doubt, and several volumes of John Zorn's Film Works. A young guitarist and composer trying to establish himself while asking Ribot to take a solo on his debut is tantamount to Menomena asking David Byrne to sing a song on their first record. But on ""Poste e Telegrafi Blues"", Stefana and Parente build a bouncing groove, all heavy, stutter-step drums and arpeggiating electronics, only for Ribot to light it on fire. He swoops in and hurls out one of the most vital, urgent solos of his career, his savage, gritty tone biting Keith Richards circa ""Sympathy for the Devil"" while teasing out the melody in broken clips and phrases like your favorite saxophonist between 1960 and 1967. It's a brilliant minute. Smartly, ""Blues"" is both the album's centerpiece and climax, the track's frenetic action a fitting apex for the three cuts surrounding it on either side. The rest of Poste e Telegrafi either builds to or from Ribot's massive solo through Stefana's beautiful guitar-and-sidemen hazes. ""Semi Tostada di Cielo"", the anchor of the first half, showcases Stefana alone, his Bill Frisell-built guitar phrases registering like sentimental confessions without words. But much like one of his few ranking contemporaries, James Blackshaw, Stefana is only intrigued by the sound of his own guitar only to a point. Midway through the nine-minute odyssey, he corrodes his own pearl, fancying a cacophony of hammered West African percussion staple the balaphon and letting barely perceptible guitar tones slip beneath. The guitar ultimately crawls from the confusion, emerging shaken, its slow, sliding moan a bit closer to expiring in the song's second half. The album's falling action hinges on ""Whales Cemetery,"" Stefana's duet with Enrico Gabrielli's bass clarinet. Stefana's playing is reserved and razor thin here, setting the bait for Gabrielli's colossal terratone. When it arrives, it shakes the framework, pushing the capacity of its microphone and your speakers, and saturating the ground beneath Stefana's Morricone-like portrait. It's dramatic and careful, a more compelling use of torpid, heavy winds than either Earth or Sunn 0))) has found through Steve Moore's trombone on Hex, Altar and Hibernaculum. Gabrielli's clarinet is impressive, in large part, because of Stefana's constraint as a composer and arranger. That is, Gabrielli's presence means so much because he plays for much less than half of the piece. All of Stefana's compositions are defined somewhat by negative space, meaning he's able to say as much with the absence of a note as he is with the presence of 20. Opener ""Western Soda"" stumbles forward in regular rhythmic convulsions, a junk percussion loop reminiscent of Tom Waits' Real Gone allowing Stefana's picked-and-strummed banjo notes to drop casually and naturally, like hued leaves in the autumn wind. On the austere ""Motel"", Stefana climbs up and down one gentle pattern, eventually doubling the guitar and letting faint veils of feedback and a web of cymbal scrapes fall between his most distant notes. The ends of Stafana's phrases, though, are about not perfecting the right note, but, instead, letting the assumed resolution arrive slightly altered. The climax, to wit, is one lonesome pedal steel note pushed through a web of effects. It sounds more like Glenn Branca conducting 100 guitars than one being built into something else entirely, like a cathedral carved from a single stone. These are rare talents for someone so young, and, given Poste e Telegrafi, Stefana sounds as if he'll be wielding them among the heavyweights for a long time to come.",,7.8,
The Warmth of the Sun,The Beach Boys,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b8b1335d7bf169a17c/1:1/w_160/f811ba27.jpg,2007-05-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10271-the-warmth-of-the-sun/,Capitol,"Consider the taxonomy of the Beach Boys compilation. First, you have cheapies like Beach Boys Greatest Hits Vols. 1, 2 and 3, each gathering a dozen or so singles into a succinct package. With such a deep collection of quality hits, the Beach Boys could continue to repackage these in various combinations forever. Various permutations can still be found on cassette in gas stations from coast-to-coast. Then there's Endless Summer, from 1974, the prototype for the expanded compilation that gathers hits but also attempts to position the band as an iconic snapshot of a bygone era. It's hard to convey now how massive that double-LP set was during the remainder of that decade. Widely considered all the Beach Boys anyone ever needed, Endless Summer charted for three straight years and launched the idea of the band as a touring oldies act-- a nostalgic fantasyland you could revisit where Vietnam never happened and baby boomers never had to face the responsibilities of parenthood. Almost everything on the record predated Pet Sounds, before things got heavy and complicated. Even #1 single ""Good Vibrations"", often called the band's (and sometimes pop music's) peak, had to wait for the CD reissue in the 80s to come along for the carefree ride. In 2003, a new set, Sound of Summer, properly updated the ""Only Beach Boys You Ever Need"" comp for the era of the 80-minute CD, and (again) went multi-platinum. The third kind of Beach Boys collection tries to tell the alternate history of the band-- the one that didn't stop making music after Smile fell apart in 1967. This Beach Boys had to contend with an increasingly awkward-sounding bandname, naïve politics, a shift in creative energy away from Brian Wilson, and a generally fuzzy notion of what ""The Beach Boys"" as an idea was all about. Most Pitchfork readers are familiar with this period of the band's career-- they're used to debating how Wild Honey stacks up against Sunflower, and trying to figure out which of the mid-70s albums has the most to recommend. But most of this stuff, to many music fans, remains largely off the radar. These are the fans that alternative-history Beach Boys comps mean to bring into the fold. Good Vibrations, from 1975, Ten Years of Harmony (1981), and Sunshine Dream (1982) were the first of these alternative histories, each offering a look at the ""Pet Sounds and after"" Beach Boys from a slightly different angle. The new compilation The Warmth of the Sun takes a similar approach and applies it to the Beach Boys' entire career. So along with a generous helping of the post-Smile material (nothing from Pet Sounds or Smiley Smile is here), there's also a sampling of minor earlier hits. There's even one 80s curio: a truly awful version of ""California Dreamin'"" cut for inclusion on Made in U.S.A., the 1986 half-old-faves/half-deep-cuts compilation notable for including four tracks from the then out-of-print (!) Pet Sounds. ""California Dreamin'"" is the highest-charting single here, hitting #8-- on the Adult Contemporary chart, that is. On the Pop charts, like almost all of these 28 songs, it didn't crack the Top 40. Warmth of the Sun isn't chronologically sequenced; instead, songs seem to be grouped together in a rough thematic configuration. ""All Summer Long"" is an excellent opening thesis, but then the comp detours with four kitschy throwbacks in a row-- two about surfing (""Catch a Wave"" and ""Hawaii"") and two about cars (""Little Honda"" and ""409""). The chorus of ""Little Honda"" is still something to behold, the way the backup vocals chug along like pistons while Mike Love gets us up to third gear. But ""409"" sounds like a middling test-run from the Chuck Berry rip-off days, and the dippy ""Hawaii"" is interesting only as history (""I don't know what town you're from, but don't tell me they have bigger waves/ Everyone that goes comes back with nothing but raves""). The meat of the lesser pre-Pet Sounds material are the songs that showed how far Brian Wilson's art had come even before he was considered a great artist. ""Let Him Run Wild"" (remixed for stereo here) is one of his most fully realized arrangements, the surging dynamics in the chorus perfectly mirroring the narrator's unhinged frustration at an unrequited lover's fondness for the bad boy, while Mike Love's ""guess you know I waited for you, girl"" bass part allows him to regain his composure. ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"" follows, and then when the bass notes introduce the breathtaking ""Wendy"" (also in a new stereo mix, with the famous cough deleted), we get the perfect triptych of romantic longing, Beach Boys-style. Then come the post-Smile years, from which The Warmth of the Sun chooses remarkably well. Songs like ""Forever"", ""Friends"", and ""Feel Flows"" demonstrate how they turned into a very capable-- even adventurous-- group of songwriters. They were becoming ""West Coast"" in the 70s sense of the term, with songs that were tuneful, professionally sung and recorded, laidback, and vaguely spiritual. Throw in ""Til I Die"", ""Cool, Cool Water"" and the album version of ""Surf's Up"" and you're talking about tremendously sophisticated pop that ably extended the innovations of the 60s, admittedly by recycling old ideas. We end, appropriately enough, with the couples-only prom-night classic ""Warmth of the Sun"". In addition to being one of the Beach Boys' most beautiful ballads, it also represents Capitol's hopes for the continuing appeal of the band's catalog, a collective wish that their music is permanently embedded in pop music's DNA, and that it, like the warmth of the sun itself, will only grow stronger in the coming years. As long as these kinds of smartly sequenced compilations keep on coming, such longevity seems like a safe bet.",,8.6,
So Real: Songs From Jeff Buckley,Jeff Buckley,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b45e6ef95969321ff5/1:1/w_160/caa347c2.jpg,2007-05-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10266-so-real-songs-from-jeff-buckley/,Sony,"There's little use in debating whether or not Jeff Buckley's legacy is best served by a seemingly endless stream of posthumous releases. Buckley's music and persona are cemented in the pop music canon even before the repackaging, re-sequencing, or re-mastering. And given that Buckley only released one proper LP in his lifetime, it makes sense that these reissues-- including the latest, So Real-- offer little in the way of either consistency or deeper perspective. Playing more like a label-mandated promotional release for an up-and-coming artist than a thorough retrospective of one of rock's contemporary greats, So Real showcases the arc of Buckley's career in a chronologically scattered and not-particularly-enlightening way. Buckley's three best-known releases-- the Live at Sin-e EP, Grace, and the unfinished Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk-- each encapsulates a distinct moment in Buckley's career, and together constitute a fairly complete snapshot of his musical goals and aspirations. This compilation, however, demonstrates no such personal depth, showcasing Buckley's talents while omitting his inspired missteps. There's very little new that can be said about the cuts taken from Grace and Live at Sin-e. The choices are even pretty obvious: ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"", ""Grace"", ""Last Goodbye"", and ""Hallelujah"" from the former; ""Mojo Pin"" and ""Je n'en Connais Pas La Fin"" from the latter. Mediocre outtake ""Forget Her"" and a sped-up ""road version"" of ""Eternal Life"" are culled from the still-freshly-released ""Legacy Edition"" of Grace. The only at all questionable omission here is that of ""Morning Theft"", a fan favorite and by far one of the strongest tracks on Sketches. The three tracks chosen to represent Sketches-- ""The Sky Is a Landfill"", ""Everybody Here Wants You"", and ""Vancouver""-- all speak to the largely unacknowledged influence of D.C. art-rockers Shudder to Think on Buckley's later work. After the release of Grace, Buckley spent some time playing bass in Shudder guitarist Nathan Larson's underrated Mind Science of the Mind project, and the influence is apparent in Sketches' flashes of inspired, angular weirdness. Listening to ""The Sky Is a Landfill"", in particular, it's clear that Buckley was beginning to explore a more discordant and subversive approach, even if he hadn't quite figured out how to execute it. One can see why Buckley wished to re-record the songs that were released as Sketches-- while his vocals are in prime form, his band lacks the cohesive, communicative energy that makes Shudder's Pony Express Record so amazing. You can hear Buckley growing more lyrically adventurous too, with similarly mixed results. The straightforward, lovelorn words of ""Last Goodbye"" and ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"" perfectly suit that era of Buckley's material. The more impressionistic lines of ""The Sky Is a Landfill"" and ""Vancouver"" are a striking contrast; ambitious, overreaching, and occasionally very awkward and clumsy. No matter how many live albums, B-sides, and covers surface, the unbelievably sad truth remains that the record Sketches hints at-- a more sinister, dissonant and explosive take on Buckley's heart-on-sleeve romanticism-- will never be heard. The inclusion of a single previously unreleased track (a fairly predictable cover of the Smiths' ""I Know It's Over"") hints that this compilation is meant for completists as well as newcomers. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much to offer either. Buckley's legacy is necessarily imperfect, inconsistent, frustrating, and exhilarating, and the ""best-of"" treatment ultimately does nothing to bring out the best in his work.","Playing more like a label-mandated promotional release for an up-and-coming artist than a thorough retrospective of one of rock's contemporary greats, this best of showcases the arc of Buckley's career in a chronologically scattered and not-particularly-enlightening way.

A Tribute to Joni Mitchell,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09bb1335d7bf169a14a/1:1/w_160/2d58a874.jpg,2007-05-25 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10243-a-tribute-to-joni-mitchell/,Nonesuch,"A Tribute to Joni Mitchell is a cobbled-together set featuring songs specially recorded for the occasion and a few that have been lying around for ages. The first thing I did when it showed up in my review queue was make my own version of the tribute, with Mitchell's originals side-by-side with the remakes. I've liked Joni Mitchell's music for a long time, but this disc has given me a much greater appreciation for what a great performer she was. The reason is pretty simple: most of the people on this compilation can't handle her stuff, or screw it up trying. Mitchell is often lumped in with the mostly abhorrent 1970s singer-songwriter thing, but unlike contemporaries who emerged from the last wave of folk as hippiedom broke apart and sank into the cultural memory, she was an explorer. Even her early folk material, which is pretty musically basic, exhibits deep idiosyncrasies-- the way she attacked a melody doesn't really have a parallel, and there's an extemporaneous energy to her performances that makes her hard to imitate. This adventurousness spilled out into the music in the mid-70s, as she incorporated jazz on 1974's Court & Spark and dove in the avant-garde on the following year's The Hissing of Summer Lawns. This stretch of her career, extending through Hejira and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter to 1979's Mingus, is my personal favorite, and it accounts for a fair number of the covers included here, including all of the good ones. Starting with the positive, Björk's take on 1975's ""The Boho Dance"" is a small joy-- one of today's most unique female vocalists taking on one of the most unique female vocalists of the 70s. She makes the song her own, turning it inward with Vespertine-ish twinklings. Caetano Veloso's version of ""Dreamland"" is a perfect execution of something that makes total sense. The original's sparse arrangement was nothing but vocals and percussion, and Veloso preserves that, changing out the Afro-Caribbean track for an Afro-Brazilian assault. Hearing it sung by a guy who has slave ancestry and calls the song's Dreamland home gives even heavier weight to the images of Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus walking out of the waves. Elvis Costello gets together with a woodwind ensemble to cover Hissing's ""Edith & the Kingpin"", and it has that minimalist intensity he does so well. For his part, Sufjan Stevens seems to be having fun leading off the compilation with his version of ""Free Man in Paris"", and he puts perhaps more imagination into his contribution than anyone else here. Even so, some of his moves don't work. He replaces the original flute fanfare with a dryly-recorded horn arrangement that sound like it's introducing a network news winter storm report, and the first verse is underwhelming, but he saves it by completely re-inventing the chorus at about twice the original tempo. Not competing directly with Joni pays off. Then there's the rest of it. Emmylou Harris sounds okay taking on the latter-day Mitchell tune ""The Magdalena Laundries"", mostly because she lets the song's tale of girls spirited to a convent to protect their families' reputations speak for itself. But Prince's take on ""A Case of You"", aside from being completely incongruous, is excruciating. First of all, it's not much of a tribute to drop the verses you don't feel like singing, but more importantly, the arrangement is Prince at his sappy, syrupy, high-note-milking worst, and it rapes the song of its import. Brad Mehldau's jazz piano interpretation of ""Don't Interrupt the Sorrow"" is boring in all caps, even if it obviously took a lot of thought. The final tier of covers is reserved for the boring, the uninspired, and the slavish imitations that can't match what they're imitating. James Taylor does ""The River"" and can't even sing the melody, K.D. Lang tries to be Joni on ""Help Me"" and fails over a limp arrangement and naff production, Cassandra Wilson's ""For the Roses"" is minimal to a fault, and her vocal barely leaves a three-note range. I'll give Sarah McLachlan credit for trying to do something interesting with layered vocals on ""Blue"", but that doesn't actually make it good. I feel like it's an indie rock cliché saying that the good tracks are by Björk, Sufjan, Elvis Costello and Caetano Veloso, but it's true. There's just no reason for a version of ""Ladies of the Canyon"", sung by Annie Lennox with fake koto flourishes and hideous sequenced tabla in the background, to exist. Listening back to the all-Joni version of the record, it's clear that this is a musical legacy that deserves a lot better.","The original Lady of the Canyon is buried under a mudslide of slavish imitation and ill-conceived arrangements.

Ode to Ochrasy,Mando Diao,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a313d197565213a4d3/1:1/w_160/dbbb36c3.jpg,2007-05-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10251-ode-to-ochrasy/,Mute,"For all the freedom that rock'n'roll promises, the archetypal guitar/bass/drums four-piece band ultimately seems to follow two paths: You can take the Ramones route and pump out three-chord thrills until you die, or you slow down, hire a string section, and perhaps dust off the acoustic guitar. For Mando Diao, Ode to Ochrasy predictably marks the point where these Swedish garage-rockers trade in their leathers for Nehru jackets, and tidy up the student-squat squalor of 2004's Hurricane Bar with some incense and expensive-looking import rugs. But as evolutions go, Ode to Ochrasy makes for a particularly awkward adolescent phase, the sound of a band that is outgrowing their loud-fast-rules roots but still too timid to sever them completely. Ode to Ochrasy's disjointed nature is reinforced by the fact that, with few exceptions, its tracklist segregates the band's two principal songwriters, Björn Dixgard (the one who sounds like Noel) and Gustaf Noren (the one who sounds like Liam), to separate sides, making it feel like two albums. Side one belongs mostly to Dixgard, who seems determined to both preserve Mando Diao's Scando-Libertines rep and subvert it-- a relationship that ultimately proves irreconcilable and produces the album's most ill-advised turns. With its ""Heart Full of Soul"" fuzz riff and Jacques Brel-inspired imagery, ""Amsterdam"" signals a pronounced shift in the band's direction, but its attempts at evocative narrative are undermined by would-be clever lines that fall flat (""When I came to in Amsterdam, the hotel showed a movie/ with Marlon Brando and his friend Paciiiinooo""-- why not just say you watched The Godfather?) and a wannabe profound chorus (""I talked to god on the telephone/ But I really can't tell you what he told me but he was alive"") that confuses the meaningless for meaningful. And though ""Good Morning, Herr Horst"" and ""Long Before Rock 'n' Roll"" provide swift, skiffle-punk kicks, momentum is stalled by buzz-kill ballad ""Josephine"", while the acoustic title track seems emblematic of the album's wayward ambitions: a populist life-during-wartime lament framed around a made-up fantasy world of the singer's own design and comprehension. So it's with considerable relief that Noren appears mid-album with ""Morning Paper Dirt"", a power-pop pick-me-up that serves as a fitting companion piece to his Hurricane Bar standout ""Annie's Angle"", and effectively signals his seizure of the album's reins. Though guilty of faceless student-disco fodder (""TV & Me"") and the odd lyrical clunker (""I woke up on your kitchen floor with a headache made in hell""), Noren proffers a more agreeable evolution for Mando Diao's mod-rock by upping the Hammond-organ soul quotient and toning down the punk fuzz for a loose jangle: ""Song for Aberdeen"" and ""The Wildfire (If It Was True)"" are spirited, spilled-pint communions that suggest early E Street Band more than the band's usual Anglo influences. And with orchestro-ballad ""The New Boy"", he shows other retro-minded rockers that there is a future beyond rewriting the Beatles-- that is, rewriting solo Lennon. In the lawless terrain of rock'n'roll, sometimes the best move forward is not the most challenging one, but the most obvious one.","This album marks the point where these Swedish garage-rockers trade in their leathers for Nehru jackets, and tidy up the student-squat squalor of 2004's Hurricane Bar with some incense and expensive-looking import rugs.

Afrikan Majik,Je Suis France,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08dea9e61561daa6641/1:1/w_160/dc8dcdc5.jpg,2007-05-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10232-afrikan-majik/,Antenna Farm,"So many bad things have been done to Africa over the years that this album cover just seems like piling on. My colleague Rob Mitchum remarked that Lupe Fiasco and his astral appliances must be floating just out of the frame. Garish as it is, with its NES Power Glove, laser-eyed bear, a dude eating a massive cheeseburger, and a beer cooler crushing Madagascar, the cover art is actually sort of a reflection of the record. There are, like, 50 guys in this band (actually just nine, but it seems like 50 sometimes), and the songs are stuffed with objects in motion bound together only by grooves that suggest large collections of LPs from 1970s Germany. If your average stoner jam band had ambition, this is the type of sound it might reach for-- a bit heady, suggestive of hallucinogenic chemicals, all over the stylistic map, and too long in several spots. An overabundance of length is perhaps the album's weakest point, in fact. It's over an hour long where a more traditional LP length might've been a better fit for the material. They don't hold back on giving you the extended jams, either: Opener ""Sufficiently Breakfast"" is a 16-minute instrumental. The bassline is a little bit Boredoms, a little bit Neu!, and the drums smack along deeply in the pocket. After about two minutes, the guitars come in, and the next five minutes are a blur of awesome astral jamming. It reaches a point of excess toward the end, but concludes marvelously with a return to the original groove. A couple of tracks indicate that these guys could be a pretty formidable indie pop band if they chose to focus in that direction. ""That Don't Work That Well For Us"" turns the mob-speak of its chorus into a catchy hook by placing it over the last kind of drum beat you'd expect in a peppy, up-beat pop tune. ""The Love of the France"" is even better-- it has this 80s Creation Records vibe to it, with the lightly filtered, fey vocals, and acoustic guitar high in the otherwise electric mix. It's like something the older college-aged sibling would've mixtaped for the younger high school-aged sibling back home in 1990, and it snuck up on me to become my favorite moment on the album. The album is such a widely mixed bag that it's tough to find a central thread to talk about. ""Whalebone"" is an eight-minute slice of cosmic krautrock, ""California Still Rules"" and ""101 Miles and Runnin'"" are good psychedelic hard rock with strong group vocals, ""Feeder Band"" is a long, New Age-y twiddle that for some reason reminds me of the old Simpsons Halloween episode where Homer falls into the third dimension. It doesn't all work, as one might imagine. ""Digital Shrimp"" is a bleepy, boring drag, and ""Wizard of Points"" starts out cool with heavy drums and crazy vocoder but drags it out too far. By far the least forgivable song is the last one, though. ""Never Gonna Touch the Ground"" is a leaden, even insulting ersatz reggae track complete with embarrassing fake Jamaican accents-- even the way it's listed on the back cover makes it look tacked on. You might've noticed a lot of compound adjectives up there, and it's simply because there is no easy, direct way to describe what this band does. If they can decide what kind of band they want to be, or at least more fully unify their disparate elements, they'll be a force to reckon with. As it is, there are a handful of pretty awesome tracks on the album, and it's well worth checking out for people who like their rock with a touch of adventure.","A bit heady, suggestive of hallucinogenic chemicals, all over the stylistic map, and too long in several spots, this adventurous album has a bit of something for everyone.

"No Shouts, No Calls",Electrelane,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b055b1335d7bf169a0cf/1:1/w_160/869b2959.jpg,2007-05-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10181-no-shouts-no-calls/,Too Pure,"Victims of many a lazy finger-wag for their heavy Stereolab borrowings, Electrelane have spent almost a decade refining their thick-set guitar ballads without really gaining much ground. On their latest album, No Shouts, No Calls, the all-female group displays a production-free grittiness that makes it sound less of this era, but closely adjacent to it. It looks backward, disdainful of the current indie picture-- particularly England's, where buzzsaw guitars and post-Strokes poses remain bewilderingly en vogue. It's a relief, then, that organ showcase ""Tram 21"" shows no ambition to transform the band's sound into something more immediate or trendy-- say, shiny production, domineering vocals, or an untested instrumental formula. Since 2004's dark and deeply affecting The Power Out, the group has abandoned French lyrics in favor of singing in English or just plain keeping their mouths shut-- 2005's Axes was largely instrumental. On No Shouts, No Calls, the Krautrock-esque sonics of the band's last album have been fused with The Power Out's flair for continental pop, but it's the guitars that sing loudest: Each of the album's tepidly sung but passionately orchestrated songs is a raucous, quietly impressive guitar overture with garnishes of organ and keyboard. ""In Berlin"" blends four harmonies-- vocals, guitar, bass, and violin-- to craft a resolution-free dirge accompanied by nearly unintelligible lyrics. Indeed, on much of the album, the vocals work more as a separate instrument or additional melodic line than any sort of verbal communication. On ""Between the Wolf and the Dog"" the band is happy to revive its instrumental beginnings with a metal-inspired interlude, highly repetitive and stretched to epic length. It's one of the album's strongest tracks, defying structural logic with a long intro and a surprising, cheery chorus at odds with the song's frenetic, Fugazi-like sound. Ghostly vocals are a perfect addition to another torrential but hygienically precise jam session, ""Five"", but again, they serve as a tinselly bit of color, much as the strings, keyboard, or farfisa do on other tracks. Oddly, a banjo makes an appearance on ""Cut and Run"", one glimmer of the band embracing new ideas. The group also embraces the cute chorus on ""Between the Wolf and the Dog"" and makes an entire beachy ballad of it: The guitars stay quiet; the dry, hollow vocals sound as if recorded in a closet; and punchy drums and tambourine obediently steer clear of the urgency displayed elsewhere. ""The Lighthouse"" is the most magical moment on this album. Its frantically circling keyboard arpeggio (the track repeats the same melody at both rapid and slow speeds) perfectly captures the band's energy, best displaying how this album-- and this group-- distinguishes itself in a stubbornly crowded field.","UK band fuses Krautrock-esque sonics with a flair for continental pop, creating a record of passionately orchestrated songs.

Plague Park,Handsome Furs,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a4ea9e61561daa6664/1:1/w_160/489f77d0.jpg,2007-05-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10252-plague-park/,Sub Pop,"Early into ""Handsome Furs Hate This City"", Dan Boeckner sings: ""Open the heart/ It's just a machine."" Boeckner's Handsome Furs, his Wolf Parade side project with fiancée Alexei Perry, also locates its tired heart in a machine. When Boeckner told Pitchfork a few months ago that Handsome Furs were ""basically Wolf Parade without the guy that everybody likes and no real instruments,"" he might as well have said, ""...with a drum machine instead of a drummer."" That trade-off seems to have determined their debut album's tone and texture, because each of the record's nine songs moves to a precise beat that's rarely changed or improvised, doesn't adjust speeds, and can't sense the intentions of the other players. Thus, Plague Park creates a feeling of listlessness and jet-lag-- too much potential and too little movement. This was always the band's intention, it seems-- even in their most prominent press photo, they display a disaffected, decadent boredom. Because each song on Plague Park seamlessly moves into the next, and since both halves of Handsome Furs make a living as writers (one of Perry's poems was part of ""Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul""-- rock!), the album is best approached lyrics-first. It's difficult to tell who contributes what, since Perry is a poet and Boeckner penned Wolf Parade's best words. As is often the case with Wolf Parade lyrics, the songs here scorn technology, ""progress,"" and urban life. ""Hate This City"" lays down the band's philosophy pretty clearly: ""We can get you anything you want/ But you won't know what it's for,"" Boeckner sings over weak static and a sickly, spare beat. Synths dance around a handful of notes to make it a sleepwalking lullaby. In ""Cannot Get, Started"", the title's comma forces a pause that acts in much the same way as the electronics on the record-- Boeckner and Perry loathe modernity, but need to make it visible in order to show you how it works. That anger sometimes fades into grudging acceptance, however-- and on ""Dead + Rural"", it's clear that the alternatives are just as disheartening. Handsome Furs make sparse and minimal music, but stating an intention doesn't remove it from discussion. The album is only nine tracks long, but for all its brevity, it seems to last a while-- and even has time to repeat itself. The album's middle section sticks to the same tempo, the guitars all use the same strident strum and texture, so by the time Boeckner sings, ""If there’s a god/ He holds you closely/ Inside these walls"" during ""Dead + Rural"", Plague Park itself is tightening around you, its airless, thin synths and florescent-lighting hum draining your energy. The power of Boeckner's songwriting is in its harmonic simplicity. In that way, his work is a lot like the Constantines'-- each artist wrings quite a bit out of four or so chords. Despite Boeckner's obvious talents-- he's clearly refined his songwriting gifts-- and the presence here of a worthy collaborator, Boeckner most excels when he works alongside someone who provides a stronger contrast. In Wolf Parade, Spencer Krug helps provide that balance; without Boeckner's typical foil, the results remain impressive, if not quite as compelling.","Wolf Parade's Dan Boeckner teams with his fiancée, poet Alexei Perry, on this textural, minimal Sub Pop release.

1986 EP,Kavinsky,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04ac0084474cd0c1c04/1:1/w_160/ae16fca8.jpg,2007-05-24 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10173-1986-ep/,Record Makers,"If you would have told me back in 2004 that there'd come a time in the not so distant future where I'd be grumpily moaning about how Alan Braxe and Fred Falke's ""Rubicon"" had a lot to answer for, I'd have called you a crazy, fun-hating nut. Alas, as proof that too much of anything can make a man go sour, here I am, in 2007, feeling pretty much that exact way about cokey French electro-house, the 80s, and goddamn it, even arpeggios. To be fair, I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted a sudden, abundant upswing in fake cop show theme electro over the last three years-- not to the extent that we got it, anyway-- but I guess that's what happens when you spend too much time as a culture fixating on ""Grand Theft Auto"", ""Miami Vice"", and the relative merits of Giorgio Moroder. Thankfully, we're in the hangover stage of that particular long weekend, which means that not only is France's Kavinsky at the wrong party, he's late to it. The followup EP to 2006's Teddy Boy, 1986 is at once indebted to Braxe's early work and yet somehow utterly impervious to it. As pure homage goes, Kavinsky's sounds are dead on, his structures work, his chord changes feel right, but, ultimately, there's no blood here. It's how most miniature movements end, really; eventually something comes along that has all the on-paper characteristics of the original thing and absolutely none of its joy. This is that. In what I guess is meant to be a cute thematic quirk, 1986 is a mini sorta-concept EP about...driving. With its comic book depiction of a drug cartel-type wearing a racing jacket and driver's gloves, the album artwork hints at the video game-reinforcing theme. Those who bother to dig deeper into the ""back story"" will be thumped over the nose with a silly tale about how 1986 was the year Kavinsky crashed his Ferrari Testarossa, only to come back as a zombie hell bent on...what, it never says. Haunting a dead horse? That all the song titles sound like driving games doesn't help to disabuse us of the notion that Kavinsky made most of these tracks in between serious face time with his PS2. There's ""Wayfarer"", ""Grand Canyon"", ""Dead Cruiser"", the pointlessly expository ""Flashback"" (which advances the car crash storyline with a 90-second skit featuring news reports, police sirens, and what sounds like a lost soundtrack to a body magic fitness tape) and, just for good measure, a SebastiAn remix of 2006's ""Testarossa Overdrive"". With the possible exception of ""Grand Canyon"", which has a nice shimmer to it, none of them feel particularly essential; what they might do is make you pine a bit for the days when Braxe and Vitalic and Daft Punk were doing this sort of thing with style. A craven attempt to dine out on the last remaining scraps of appeal for this particular strand of French house, 1986 is a bloodless miss; less Jan Hammer, more nail in the coffin.","Conceptually heavy French Touch producer follows his outstanding Teddy Boy EP with a far less rewarding effort.

GAame,Aa,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09713d197565213a4bf/1:1/w_160/6332a31c.jpg,2007-05-24 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10239-gaame/,Gigantic,"Aa is pronounced ""Big A Little a."" There's something worth noticing there: You see the signs representing a vowel sound, but you don't say ""ahhh."" Instead, this Brooklyn band decides how you should pronounce its name, and it upsets your expectations in the process. You feel the same displacement when listening to GAame (no pronunciation key given), Aa's debut LP. The band employs its own secret language across the record's 13 tracks, and because the group doesn't give the listener a key, its grunts, howls, and cries become part of the rhythm of GAame, an album where rhythm is privileged above all. Of course this remapping brings up comparisons to other rhythm-is-all, language-is-secondary bands, such as Animal Collective, Liars and OOIOO. While there is something (little-a) animal about Aa, GAame doesn't have the same sweaty, visceral propulsion of AC's Feels or the wildman roar of Liars. Instead the album is insect-like, full of seemingly chaotic rhythms that are, on closer inspection, guided by complex systems. Think of GAame as a container for different suites, each guided by their own pacing and palette of sounds. These tracks also bleed into one another-- a feature that the iPod ruins. Opener ""Deathmask"" is GAame's overture, a 30-second sampling that begins with the same eerie tension that ends the whole record. On ""Time In"", that palette is wet fingers on glass, flicking cicada wings, vespine drums that keep low to the soil. ""Best of Seven"" speaks in strident ringing school and sleigh bells. For ""New Machine"" and ""Thirteen"", Aa use synths as rhythm-- in the former they approximate chirps and chortles; they rise and fall like gentle respiration in the latter. ""Manshake"" shows the band at their best: Not just noise, not just drums, but something that reaches ecstatic, bombastic heights. Since GAame works as a suite, it also suffers from being a little too cohesive. Sometimes Aa draw the connections between songs too strongly, which means the record can drag toward its end, when the listener has long been ready to drop the repetition and move on. And sometimes the vocalizations are all wrong. Take the shouted opening to ""Time In"", in which the vocalist shouts out a list of puns, including, ""You've got GAame."" Its micro-rhythms and elephantine horns would have been better off alone. The vocal doesn't work because cliché doesn't suit Aa's intentions. GAame wants to function the same way the band's name does-- as a way to control your attention by forcing the unfamiliar. So the sounds we're used to hearing disrupt an otherwise strange experience. Move into the familiar and the structure collapses.","Brooklyn band employs its own secret language, and in the process its grunts, howls, and cries become part of the rhythm of GAame-- an album where rhythm is privileged above all.

"Operator Dead, Post Abandoned",Burning Star Core,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08cb1335d7bf169a137/1:1/w_160/00b262a2.jpg,2007-05-24 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10231-operator-dead-post-abandoned/,No Quarter,"Ohio's C. Spencer Yeh is known for drone. (He named his record label Drone Disco, after all, and it’s far heavier on the former than the latter.) But the noise the avant-violinist bows and scrapes up on Burning Star Core's new Operator Dead, Post Abandoned is thick with textural variation, far more so than the steady, implacable screech of many 21st-century identikit dronesters. This is thanks to the constantly undulating layer of gritty analogue and piercing digital electronics from Yeh and bandmates Mike Shiflet and Robert Beatty, as well as the scattered percussion of drummer Trevor Tremaine. (Tremaine plays electronics too, because really, you can never have enough). In fact, the very listenable, if undeniably hairy, Operator Dead is the best BxC record to date, a master class in grotty, lo-fi droneology. Sometimes the drones on Operator Dead scream until it sounds like the record's lungs are going to implode. At others, they're pretty, if not quite pastoral. (Occasionally, the band goes for both extremes on the same track.) Over the 19 minutes of opening track ""When the Tripods Came"", Yeh and crew build a resonant buzzing like a tamboura run through a distortion pedal-- you assume this is Yeh's violin, but the density of the music makes a mockery of figuring out which sound comes from which player-- that's joined by pounding, tribal drums and free flurries of cymbal by Tremaine. The electronics sound like everything from bagpipes squawking through crappy reverb to the traditional roar of psychedelic guitar fuzz. The track's opening half is actually intoxicating-- almost inviting-- but it slowly tangles into a climax of ear-bleed noise before painfully, and abruptly, shorting out. The rest of Operator Dead feels like its aftermath. The 16-minute title track is similar to Repent and White House-era Dead C, full of sibilant scrap yard percussion and the suffocating feeling that the band has set a gasoline fire in its practice space and is slowly asphyxiating on the fumes. The album's two shorter codas are equally narcotic, especially the almost-beautiful shimmer of ""Me and My Arrow"". (But ""The Emergency Networks Are Taking Over"", which starts like a free jazz drummer sitting with the Bernard Herrmann orchestra only to finish up with the noise of a melting calliope, is also thrilling.) So Yeh knows his drones, and he also knows drones are tricky things. When you listen to a drone, you can start to hear a world of infinite texture. Or you can become bored enough listening for variations to go back to playing Wii tennis and listening to Lil Wayne. And actually, none of what Yeh does here is a strict, by-the-book ""drone""-- BxC's tracks are far too busy for that, always providing plenty to listen for--but throughout Operator Dead, Burning Star Core does explore the immersive capabilities of noise, the drone's capacity to ""snow you under."" The band wants to overwhelm you, and it succeeds.","Led by avant-garde violinist C. Spencer Yeh, this No Quarter band's lo-fi droneology recalls the collaborative work of Tony Conrad and Faust.

The Great Unwanted,Lucky Soul,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a0c0084474cd0c1ca0/1:1/w_160/1ccc0bde.jpg,2007-05-24 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10248-the-great-unwanted/,Ruffa Lane,"Ever since the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"", guitar groups have set out to capture the teenage melodrama of 60s girl groups. Most recently, Britons the Pipettes broke hearts in matching costumes, while El Perro del Mar cried Swedish tears into orchestrally fluffed pillows. And don't forget Johnny Boy's ""You Are the Generation That Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"". Some bands add the Velvet Underground to the formula, whether in the sweet noise squall of the Jesus and Mary Chain or the Concretes' misty Mazzy Starscapes. When I first encountered Lucky Soul, on last year's chic indie pop comp The Kids at the Club, all I could hear was the past. The London sextet's thrillingly overwrought girl-group glamor is completely unmediated by hipster weirdness; you'll find no Wes Anderson postmodernism on their debut album, The Great Unwanted, so you can leave your ironic T-shirts at home. The syrupy orchestration of ""My Brittle Heart"", the group's first single, takes from Phil Spector's ""Wall of Sound"" not the overly familiar drum patterns, but the grand, open-hearted directness, as huge and as potentially embarrassing as first love. ""Liberty is wasted on me,"" sings frontwoman Ali Howard, cribbing a line from 1991 Morrissey B-side ""I've Changed My Plea to Guilty"". Another Lucky Soul single, ""Lips Are Unhappy"" remembers the Motown lesson on amplifying emotion by seeming to suppress it, as Howard calls for us to ""shake, shake, shimmy, shimmy"" (for sure!) over sunny-day tambourine and velveteen harmonies. ""I'm tired of keeping composure when I'm not supposed to feel sad,"" she sings on ""One Kiss Don't Make a Summer"". The tracks of her tears are easy to trace. Still, The Great Unwanted isn't the kind of album that leaves you walking out humming ""Be My Baby"". Guitarist, primary songwriter, and arranger Andrew Laidlaw pays more attention to composition than to homage, and Howard has an unshowy, girlish voice that's nevertheless more polished than usual in indie pop, with shades of Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw, and Petula Clark. She can cast a spell over upbeat Northern Soul floorshakers like ""Getta Outta Town!"" and bouncy third single ""Add Your Light to Mine, Baby"". But she's just as at home on decorous torch songs like guitar waltz ""Baby I'm Broke"", aching finale ""The Last Song"" (with its reviewer-ready ""the penultimate beat of the drum"") and the smoldering ""My Darling, Anything"", which pours sugar in the singer's wounds with musical puns about missed beats and a heart that goes ""skip-skip-skip"" like a scratched-up CD. It's the type of sumptuous bubblegum that made an impressive showing on Pitchfork's ""The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s"" but rarely places on year-end album lists. On ""The Great Unwanted"", Lucky Soul decisively align themselves with the uncool, a not uncommon move that rings true mostly due to the music's non-appetite for winks. ""Look for us, we were the casualties/ Forever paying the price for a life less boring,"" Howard proclaims. Elsewhere on the album, the toweringly embellished title track from recent EP Ain't Never Been Cool once again sides with the unfairly unloved. Which on one hand could be viewed as commercially astute; the latest girl-group revival can't last forever. Then again, that's where things get really poignant. Howard has chosen whole-broken-heartedly to stand among the pop-besotted, lonely souls to whom the Smiths addressed another B-side, 1985's ""Rubber Ring""-- the huddled masses whose lives were once saved by a song.

But unlike their twee-pop predecessors, the band also enjoyed the promotional boost of the mp3, and nurturing from online music communities which allowed them to leverage their few brief releases into a contract with the Beggars Group. Now backed by an honest-to-god record deal, and with fans eagerly awaiting their next step, the band has attempted to transfer their mastery of the EP format to a full album. Unfortunately, it turns out to be something of an awkward translation. During the first episode of the band's YouTube album-recording documentary ""Reaching for the Lasers"", bassist Jason Chronis admits, ""Everybody in the band was ready for things to sound more advanced. We only have three EPs out; it's funny that on our first album we feel like we have to make fairly big changes."" Thus, the extended dramatic opening and string-laden climax of ""Introduction"", which feels like the prelude to something extravagant. Densely detailed, thinly produced EP tracks like ""Raised by Wolves"" and ""Mothers, Sisters, Daughters & Wives"" are perfect candidates for bigger-budget expansion, and Ramesh Srivastava's songwriting style-- loquacious, emotionally insecure, buoyant, and tidy-- carries over to Voxtrot in full force. The ""Kid Gloves"" lyric ""cheer me up, I'm a miserable fuck"" may not halt the Smiths comparisons any time soon, but the song's propulsive power-pop backdrop suggests a well-executed fleshing-out of the sound that gained the group such a strong following. Likewise, ""Firecracker"" ascends an Arcade Fire-style bridge toward a satisfying, rocking chorus. Moments like these, however, are too few and far between, as the majority of the record's new tracks need to either be more focused or show more dynamic range. Voxtrot songs tend to rely more on successive alterations to near-melodies than full-on excursions into big, transcendent melodic moments. Yet while the band continually strives for hugeness on their debut long-player, they opt to force the issue through instrumental layering and sheer volume rather than re-tooling the songs at the base level. ""Easy"", for example, desperately wants to gleam but is flattened and disallowed the dynamic spikes it deserves. It's far from empty ambition-- more like unrealized potential-- but the band's M.O. here makes for a frustrating listen. Srivastava's singing voice-- previously an attractively coy, boyish warble-- is a big casualty here, stretched beyond its very limited range, yet still trying to express sentiments fit for a late-night phone call. His coo feels appropriate when crafting a tranquil melody on ""The Future Pt. 1"" or demurely lamenting on ""Steven"", but it struggles to keep up with harder numbers like ""Brother in Conflict"" or the cluttered closer ""Blood Red Blood"", finding itself buried in the mix. It suffers a bit of melodramatic misuse as well, most obviously on the mushy late-album slow jam ""Real Life Version"". Of course, that Voxtrot failed to make a career-defining record on their first attempt should not be held against them-- it was simply turned around too quickly. Their internet celebrity has uniquely magnified their tenure and significance, and the resulting echo chamber of hype and anticipation has more than likely placed an unfair burden on them to produce a work out of frame with their intentions. If Chronis' above quote is an indication of the full group's mindset while recording, they placed similar pressure on themselves as well. As a result, Voxtrot shows a young band eagerly trying to have it all: attempting to establish a mature musical identity while aiming for a wide audience. Voxtrot may very well have a great pop record within them, yet their first effort stumbles from the band's enthusiastic, ambitious attempt to produce it immediately.","The Texas band behind the fantastic Raised by Wolves and Mothers, Sisters, Daughters & Wives attempts to transfer its mastery over the quick-hit efficacy of the EP to the album format.

The mind-blowing unknown opening act is a familiar enough trope, but the then-Philadelphia band's set didn't blow me away so much as gently but firmly guide me into the their corner. Playing first of three at a big club can be daunting, and sure enough the band performed to an almost-deserted Bowery Ballroom without the benefit of a soundcheck. And yet, they pulled off a surprisingly solid set with just the right balance of eagerness and gentle self-deprecation. Too much self-awareness can kill a young band's appeal and leave genuine charisma reeking of transparent manipulation, and it was refreshing to see a band that seemed so at ease, especially given the circumstances of the show. Nearly four years later, a similar sense of ease permeates the band's debut, Flight of the Bass Delegate. The album has its fair share of genre-hopping, but never in a way that seems obnoxiously cool or haphazardly referential. If anything, the dub and reggae nods on Flight of the Bass Delegate come off as...kinda dorky. The Jai-Alai Savant are not dabblers, and they follow through some of these stylistic cues with an aplomb that at can be both disarming and distracting. The brief introductory track ""Data Massagana"" is both justified and obliterated by the unstoppable, explosive ""Arcane Theories"". Here, the band's pop and post-punk sensibilities come to the fore; ""Arcane Theories"" pairs the unrelenting muscle of a Fugazi song with massive, sun-soaked harmonies. It's pop music based in rhythm, not melody-- singer Ralph Darden doesn't have much of a range, and many of his melodies don't extend beyond four or five notes. But his short, repetitive harmonized vocal phrases make for an integral and memorable part of the album's overall feel. The best moments on Flight are generally the most intense and concise. Again, this is not a band that drops aesthetic signifiers and then moves on; they commit, and sometimes they'll chase a groove a little too far. ""Scarlett Johansson, Why Don't You Love Me?"" adds just a bit of reggae syncopation to the band's propulsive sound, to great effect. The seven minute-plus ""The Low Frequent See""-- the title of which should put to rest any questions regarding the band's nerddom-- finds its way to a number of cool sounds and interesting instrumental moments, but such explorations almost always seem to come at the expense of focused songcraft. Still, this is the age of shuffle, and there are some kind of unbelievably ass-kicking tracks to be found here. And, even when the band meanders, they do so whole-heartedly. Though it was long in the making, this is still their first release, and it certainly isn't short on good reasons to keep paying attention. Flight of the Bass Delegate has some very good stylistic ideas and some very good songs, even if they don't always happen at the same time.","Rather than coming across as dabblers, this Chicago band's genre-hopping seems the work of a group that's well at ease with each of its stylistic switches.

You might expect Âme's debut DJ mix …Mixing to speak to this development (""where is Rej?"" asks the tongue-in-cheek sticker on the front of the CD, presumably so that I don't have to), but instead it talks around it, weaving a constellation of influences and reference points that almost too-perfectly circumscribe Âme's sound-- too-perfect, because the result sometimes feels a bit like a list of ingredients rather than the finished product. Perhaps because Âme's current sound tends toward the monolithic, the gentle eclecticism on display here struggles to startle: Âme's penchant for moody hippy disco, lush vocal garage, dreamy tech-house, scaly minimal and nervous Detroit techno seems so reasonable, it's hard to imagine that this could result in efforts as disorienting as ""Rej"" or the recent ""Fiori"". But reasonability isn't the worst thing you could accuse a DJ mix of, and one of the pleasures of …Mixing is precisely how logical and familiar Âme's aesthetic seems-- even the unashamedly pretentious use of Tangerine Dream-style synthesizer epics to open and close the mix seems cheerfully appropriate. For people who look to dance music for sonic revolutions, the album's appeal will be limited. The sound of this music-- clean but amorphous, accomplished but not complicated, existing in a space where acoustic and electronic sounds merge and become indistinguishable-- gestures towards a sense of timelessness that usually prevents it from sounding futuristic, or even retro-futurist. At its most intoxicating-- the gorgeously soporific disco of Double's ""Woman of the World"", the orchestral grandeur of Henrik Schwarz's remix of Coldcut's ""Walk a Mile in my Shoes"", the bruised atmospherics of Atjazz's ""For Real (Version Remix)"" or the existential diva echoes of Ben Westbeech's ""So Good Today (Yoruba Soul Mix)""-- the sensation is perhaps rather that of a future of damaged dancers looking back to the past for shelter and succor; the utopian or dystopian resonances of this music are given shape insofar as they excluded from the frame. Perhaps best of all is Carl Craig's 12-year-old remix of Jonny L's ""This Time"", in which a female diva's declaration, ""there's no need to climb the mountains high"", is looped into an ominous ""high-igh-igh-igh"", while the jazz-house groove builds to a seemingly infinite plateau of intensity. At once luxuriant and slightly unnerving, the track exposes a darkness at the heart of opulence, the ""timelessness"" of the music now an eerie sign that the embodied world has fallen away, leaving no path back to reality. At these moments the mix comes closest to capturing the mystical feel-- if not the specific sound-- of ""Rej"", which repeats its haunting motif to the point of monomaniacal delirium, a soundtrack to some arcane pagan rite. ""Mystical"" is not a vibe that deep house has had much truck with historically. ""Soulful,"" yes, even ""spiritual,"" but the voluptuous warmth of the music has usually been immersive rather than overwhelming, beguiling rather than bewitching. In its decision to cover so much historical and stylistic ground rather than burrow deeper into this as yet still under-explored aesthetic, …Mixing can feel like a bit of a missed opportunity; compared to recent efforts from Âme's labelmate and occasional collaborator Dixon, it doesn't go deep enough. Still, as an introductory biography on how the duo got to this point, it succeeds admirably. Let's just hope they have a sequel planned.","Instead of burrowing deeper into the as yet still under-explored mystical aesthetic of tracks like ""Rej"" and ""Fiori"", this mix covers a wide variety of historical and stylistic ground.

Mapmaker,Parts & Labor,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0965e6ef95969321fbf/1:1/w_160/00b0b480.jpg,2007-05-23 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10238-mapmaker/,JagjaguwarBrah,"With Mapmaker, Parts & Labor display a newfound matur-- wait, come back! I know what you're thinking. ""Maturity"" means new heights for some, and a slower and duller version of the same for most. For noiseniks like Parts & Labor-- a band that wears its hardcore roots on its sleeves-- maturity would likely mean the latter. I wouldn't blame anyone who read that and immediately thought of all the *Sandinista!*s and Candy Apple Greys crowding the used bins of record stores worldwide. P&L have the same members as on last year's Stay Afraid, as well as the same basic sound: uptempo noise punk with the irrepressible drums of Chris Weingarten, blurting and squealing keyboards to replace guitars, and the vocals always set to a strident, monotone bellow. However, Mapmaker does everything else it can to diversify their sound without sacrificing the winning formula they've established. On paper, these new flourishes are signals of a band that's probably spinning its wheels: horn sections, more vocal harmonies, more open space, more slow songs... but bear with me. Stay Afraid wasn't just exhilarating, it was exhausting and bordered on uncomfortable in its relentlessly treble-heavy attack. A little open space does wonders for the band, especially on tracks like ""Ghosts Will Burn"", where the death rattle of a cheap keyboard precedes vicious stabs of distorted bass and a precise drum beat that murders the fourth bar while letting an ominous air fill the other three. Plenty of inadvisable influences killed punk bands, but a little bit of funk never hurt. ""The Gold We're Digging"" adds a bit of rave-era rhythm to its sober sloganeering, and ""Long Way Down"" is makes more stunning use of space with firing-line percussion and ringing high notes that nearly falls apart before rising up in a wave of cacaphony and thundering low-end. The growth extends to second vocalist BJ Warshaw, whose ""Brighter Days"" is his best spotlight track thus far, unaccompanied vocals juxtaposed with rhythmless noise interludes, all grounded by the album's most calculated melody. Elsewhere, the dominating textures on ""Fake Rain"" and ""New Crimes"" are their nimble clean guitar lines. Even the more obvious dynamic tricks, like the disorienting attack-and-retreat of ""Camera Shy"" or the simmering tension of ""Unexplosions"", still have plenty of mileage when in their hands. As for those horns, opening track ""Fractured Skies"" tucks them into a final gasp on its gargantuan final chorus, spending every moment of its frenetic drumming and counterpoint keyboard squeals building up to that one moment-- they know you gotta earn those horns, and they do. The band didn't need to grow up in any way, especially as it's only been a year between releases. Regardless, Parts & Labor took cues from their forebears and tried their hand at a more diverse record without losing the thread, leaving the more wildly experimental work for their tour EPs and pushing at the walls of the box they established with Stay Afraid. By now, we know there doesn't have to be a binary between young and reckless or old and slow-- it's a balancing act, and Parts & Labor balanced it pretty well here.","On its latest album, this post-hardcore band does everything it can to diversify its sound without sacrificing the winning formula the group's established.

Dandelion Gum,Black Moth Super Rainbow,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09eea9e61561daa665c/1:1/w_160/b7365eb8.jpg,2007-05-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10246-dandelion-gum/,Graveface,"Black Moth Super Rainbow apparently consists of a few pals with funny nicknames like Tobacco and Father Hummingbird, who dress strangely, occasionally wear masks, and make music together off in some isolated rural area near Pittsburgh. It all sounds suspiciously engineered to cultivate an image for the band as eccentric pop outsiders. Fortunately, the backstory doesn't matter much, because the first thing to do with a record like BMSR's latest, Dandelion Gum, is to forget about who made it: The music discourages any engagement with personality. For one thing, the album's vocals are warped beyond repair by vocoder, even when its tracks occasionally veer toward a mutant electronic version of sun-drenched folk-pop. Most of the time, you can't understand a thing being said, but here, that's not a problem: The meaning of the music comes through regardless. As a band, Black Moth Super Rainbow, have been toiling away for a few years now, amassing several full-lengths, CD-Rs, and collaborations, most notably a 2006 split EP with the Octopus Project. But where the group's earlier records, when not traveling a purely instrumental path, incorporated more or less ""regular"" singing, Dandelion Gum takes a big risk: It relies on a single vocal filter throughout the course of the entire album. Typically, a processed voice so readily becomes the focus of a song that, without at least some change to the effect, a full record can seem samey or redundant. Luckily, Black Moth have an unusual enough mood going here that the uniformity becomes a strength. The vocals are playful but not played for laughs; to me they sound claustrophobic, almost sickly. It's not a voice that brings shiny singing robots to mind, but rather people who've spent so much time indoors that their bodies have begun to change in unhealthy ways. To that end, the vocoder gives the record a shade of darkness it wouldn't otherwise have. The keyboards throughout sound vintage, with textures that bring to mind Mellotron and Moog, while the guitars are thin, trebly, and speckled with analog dust. The central pulsating riff of ""Sun Lips"" sounds an awful lot like the dream-channeled refrain of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", even as it's used in service of what is ultimately a tremendously simple little pop tune. ""We miss you in summertime,"" the singer (that would be Tobacco on the mic) intones through his machine, and since it seems kind of like a love song, the presence of ""we"" is a little odd. Does he have a mouse in his pocket? Maybe it's one of those songs that seems directed to a woman but is really about weed. Somehow, though, it works. Chalk it up to the world of this album. If much of Dandelion Gum sounds like something recorded at home on the cheap, ""Rollerdisco"", which forms an impressive 1-2 punch after ""Sun Lips"", demonstrates that Black Moth gets the most out of their modest set-up. Like much of their past work, it comes over like a spry, airy, and tremendously evocative instrumental Boards of Canada interlude, from back when the Scottish duo still did that sort of thing. And the acoustic guitar loop in ""Jump Into My Mouth and Breathe the Stardust"" has the old-tape-found-under-a-tree-stump vibe that gave BoC's The Campfire Headphase an appealing sense of water-damaged psychedelia. Early Beck is even invoked on ""Melt Me"", which sounds an awful lot like what ""Devil's Haircut"" would have been had Carl Stephenson helped lay it down for Mellow Gold. Still, despite the occasionally folky melodic sensibility, Black Moth's aesthetic is always spacey-- they're more likely to be scoring a laser show at a planetarium than busking on a street corner. Wherever these guys are holed up and whether or not they really call the drummer Iffernaut, Dandelion Gum is a nice surprise and a good example of why doing one thing very well is sometimes more than enough.","Graveface band veers toward a mutant electronic version of sunny folk-pop that somehow also sounds claustrophobic, sickly, and a little bit damaged.

DJ Kicks,Hot Chip,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12bc0084474cd0bfd47/1:1/w_160/5c319a15.jpg,2007-05-23 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10250-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Pop songs repetitive enough to appeal to the dance set. Dance sets poppy enough to beg constant repetition. Fun songs about love. Love songs about fun. These are just some of the reasons why Hot Chip may be the closest thing we have to an indie music Switzerland. Different factions may try to claim them as their own, but the London electro-pop quintet has managed to remain largely nondiscriminatory with their output. It's so-called ""poptimism"" of the best kind: Hot Chip's answer to every genre always seems to be a resounding, open-armed ""yes."" Spanning blue-eyed soul, synthpop, r&b, and geek-rock, Hot Chip's musical hybrid is a lovable (if unlikely) one-- and, mostly for utilitarian reasons, it's not one you'd expect them to clearly communicate during the course of a single-CD mix. Nonetheless, that's exactly what they do with their entry in !K7's acclaimed DJ Kicks series. A mulched-up whirlwind of pretty much everything they hold near and dear, the disc darts through drivetime FM soul, goofy techno, cartoonish fun, and big synthpop moments, taking the best few minutes (or in some cases, few seconds) of each of these 24 tracks and cramming it all into a breakneck 68 minutes. As you might imagine, the only way anyone could ever pull this off would be to cop to a bit of A.D.D., so DJ Kicks flits excitedly and unapologetically from one listening station to the next. Amidst the madness, though, there is a vague sense of order in the form of four loosely defined acts: a) The goofy party stuff, b) The retro block, c) The techno half-hour, and d) The closing free-for-all. It's a structure that basically mimics that of their more substantial live DJ sets, albeit on a much more condensed scale. Hot Chip's occasional proximity to yacht rock has been well-documented, and it's a sound they good-naturedly embrace here by bookending their mix with two derivatives; first, the opening ballad ""Nitemoves"", courtesy of new act Grovesnor (aka former Hot Chip drummer Rob Smoughton), which starts with a WKRP-ready palette of Rhodes piano and blue eyed vox before sputtering into a mess of programmed drums and synth squibbles; later, Joe Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"", which they show deference to by playing out in full. There's also pinches of hip-hop here and there, such as a quick verse from Positive K's 1992 hit ""I Got a Man"" and current Baltimore phenom Young Leek's ""Jiggle It"". That the latter is preceded by New Order's ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and followed by Etta James' ""In the Basement"" should clue you in to what you're in for. This is fun by the minute-- no buildup, all payoff, but happily, it works. The mini techno set in the latter half of the mix provides a bit of room to breathe, and gives Hot Chip a chance to acquit themselves as guys who are just as capable of spinning at five a.m. as midnight. Selections from Dominik Eulberg, Gabriel Ananda, and Marek Bois all stand out, but it's Noze's off-kilter ""Love Affair"" that has the last laugh, melding a tight, clattering groove with an English lyric made charming by the French accents singing it: ""I wash my fit and I feel so good/ I brush my tiff and I feel so good/ I clean my nose and I'm ready for my love affair/ For my love affair!"" A beguiling mix of technical precision, fun pop, and dumb humor, it's the one track on the mix you suspect Hot Chip probably feel closest to. At the end of the day, though, the reason this works so well is because Hot Chip never seem too close to any of the music presented; there's a nice democracy to the way this stuff's been blenderized to a neon pulp. It provides the sense that they're too busy rummaging through their record bags for the next big moment to worry all that much about things like pace and structure. Turn yourself over to those moments for an hour, and you won't end up worrying much about anything at all.","This London band's lovable hybrid of dance and pop craft a DJ Kicks that's a mulched-up whirlwind of pretty much everything they hold they hold near and dear.

Through the Belly of the Sea,Morningbell,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08f9d034d5c69bf48bc/1:1/w_160/855b2fe7.jpg,2007-05-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10234-through-the-belly-of-the-sea/,Orange,"It's a maxim among many who think about such things that no new technologies are ever really ""new,"" but are hybrids and re-conceptions of pre-existing modes of doing similar things. For its part, the record album, despite the second term's indication of a collection of disparate works, has never shaken its association with the narrative format, where songs are chapters and musicians storytellers. As actual works of literary art, concept albums tend to approach the idea of ""story"" rather loosely, a function of the obvious fact that songs have nothing on words as tale-creators. Perhaps then, the Gainesville power-pop band Morningbell is on to something with Through the Belly of the Sea, which they've styled after that most nonlinear of the fictional arts, the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. Even aside from the music, then, Belly sits at a rarified, if not necessarily sought-after, level of indie rock ironic nostalgia, by combining the classic rock-ness of the concept album with the dime-store novelty of the Bantam book series. The trick to the album is simple, and seems like a fun idea; you read the liner notes while listening, and after each track you are given two choices as to your next move. Relax on the coral reef? Fight the mysterious sea monster? The world is yours. For a lot of people, shuffling music around is a daily activity, so Belly's batshitness is of a much lesser conceptual realization than that of, say, Zaireeka. But in a way, this is the most compelling aspect of Morningbell's gimmick; its regressive approach toward listening technology, limiting iTunes' infinite-choice power to but two post-song options. Along that line, perhaps a good idea to market the CDs might be a slogan like one from the back of a comic book: ""Magically Transform iTunes Into a Paperback!"" The record as either music or narrative, however, does little more than tread water. The tale told is of some sort of vague oceanic exploration, and it becomes quickly clear that the songs, for the most part, have little to do with adventure or science fiction. Reading the half-paragraphs that carry the story forward takes about 15 seconds each, after which the waiting game starts for something exciting to happen in the song, which invariably does not. Opening track ""The Speed of God"" is impassive keyboard pop-as-expedition-launch, which leads to, without option, to a brief interlude on track seven. I read during this song that a JOLT!!! happens as my ship is attacked by a sea monster, but the music-- which aims for The Life Aquatic but lands somewhere in a Krofft Brothers interstitial-- is indifferent. I decide to ""flee,"" and end up ""Lost Again"", before opting to watch an octopus walk across some coral, both excursions set to slight mid-tempo indie pop. I'll stop short of recommending a Rick Wakeman or Jethro Tull degree of nutty orchestration for an album with this set-up, but Morningbell's anonymous, aqueous Shinsiness is much too thin for the fantastic voyage they seem to have in mind. That Belly could be listened to in its published running order without any huge change in effect is a testament to either the universality of its lyrics (hope, fear, going home, etc.), or the more likely explanation that the Choose Your Own Adventure idea is, well, a rather thorough publicity gimmick. Morningbell's real breakthrough with Belly, then, instead of any adventurous narrative novelty, is its unique way to gain notice for otherwise timid music.","The Gainesville indie pop band attempts the rarest of ironic indie hybrids: a concept album based on the Choose Your Own Adventure book series.

A Raining Sun of Light and Love For You and You and You,Titan,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0785e6ef95969321f8a/1:1/w_160/f2d95bd3.jpg,2007-05-22 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10215-a-raining-sun-of-light-and-love-for-you-and-you-and-you/,Tee Pee,"Titan is a Brooklyn quartet into excavating late-1960s/early-70s progressive psychedelia. Along with mostly instrumental incense burners comes attendant throwback imagery-- note the suitable-for-black-light mushroom and freehand lettering that melts across the CD's inner flaps-- and long titles to match reasonably lengthy songs. Really, no need to dig further than the title, A Raining Sun of Light and Love For You and You and You, to find those ingredients displayed. To get a good sense of the sound of the four atmospherically analog boogie bongs on Titan's first non-CD-R studio recording project, skim the instrumentation listed at the band's MySpace page. Adding some DayGlo flesh to the drums, guitar, and Fender Jazz bass are a parade of synthesizers and pedals. It's the sorta stuff that makes kids who've never heard Hawkwind or Amon Düül II yell, ""Hawkwind and Amon Düül II!"" (sometimes adding Ash Ra Tempel because it appears on the label's cover sticker). In my teens I went through a severe psych era, aided by walks to the now-defunct Sound On Sound records in Highland Park, NJ and hitched rides to the Princeton Record Exchange. At that time, anything even slightly swirly, extended, or stinking of pot (or Wayne Rogers) was purchased. As a result, I have the record collection of a geeky senior citizen, including hundreds of albums from the period Titan loves as well as post-70s players who've shared that fixation. Closing my eyes, opening my ears, and placing A Raining Sun of Light in that context, I'd say it lands somewhere in the lower middle of the other revivalists. Which is too bad. The record actually begins more than promisingly. At the onset, ""Annals of the Former World""'s out-of-phase, pseudo-sacred vocals and pastoral acoustic guitar warp into a tripped Can freak-out in the course of ten truly compelling minutes. It's a beaut. Or fast-forward to the album's final seconds when the acoustic spire returns after the sounds of crickets and a truck, a tinny micro-jamboree from outer nowhere. What happens in between? There are other successful turns of phase, but across 42 minutes of Comets on Fire on Acid echo rides, projectile Neu! vomits, flanged crescendos, and some right pretty guitars (respect), an uninspired sameness eclipses the proficiency. Ultimately it's the less polished, odd rumblings that stay with you, start to feel like a tease beneath the weight of a too-well-oiled juggernaut. The players are obviously compatible and technically astute, but on the whole the collection isn't specific or individual (or warped or weird) enough to inspire return trips. Dudes need to spring more leaks.","On its first official studio release the neo-kosmische Brooklyn band draws inspiration from turn-of-the-70s progressive psychedelia.

Retina Riddim,Gang Gang Dance,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b099b1335d7bf169a146/1:1/w_160/1fc5c06b.jpg,2007-05-22 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10241-retina-riddim/,Social Registry,"What to make of Gang Gang Dance's gorilla preoccupation? Retina Riddim sports three, while their CMJ set last fall saw Brian DeGraw stage left, a monkey staring off his shirt. There's the band's sincere initiative to start a sanctuary for primates, and the quotes DeGraw's given this site-- he imagines that gorillas ""look at what we have done, how we have fucked up so many pure and beautiful things, and they just all make a pact to stay somewhat primitive, to keep existing in a more natural state. They sit back and laugh amongst themselves at the ridiculous things that humans do."" DeGraw hints at an easy metaphor-- GGD as Macy's Day Parade floating ape, New York's backyard naturalists. And yet, far from primitive or pure, Gang Gang Dance are some of the city's most savvy editors, imposing order while making it look like chaos. They do love their mythology. The gorilla talk is another decoy in a long string of dodges, joining the guerilla art and Ghostface T-shirts and their frontwoman's rough-edged sex appeal as ways of understanding the band when deeper understandings are slow to come. Given how fragmented and harsh their sound sources are, and how unwilling their records are to betray the fact that their music does in fact live and thrive on rhythm, it's no surprise people often take them at their word. The long-delayed Retina Riddim began as a film project. Using the band's past records, practices, and live performances as source material, DeGraw matched video to audio; Retina is, like Panda Bear's recent Person Pitch, a synthetic collage masquerading as an organic outburst. GGD have always cultivated the rhythmic potential in virtually everything at hand. The difference here is minor, loops and samples standing in for live and spontaneous edits. Split in its final incarnation over a DVD and CD, Retina is the natural result of years of careful attention by the band to the smallest aspects of their own sound. At the outset of ""Retina Riddim"", an old-world violin pings around, each scrape and incidental ricochet looped and layered. Something hollow falling to the ground provides a beat. Liz Bougatsos's distorted chanting swirls up, new chimes and violin registers following behind it. An air-horn sounds, a baby chuckles-- at one point, what sounds like a gunshot cues up a disco charge, gabber by way of the subway or the sewer. GGD share a common approach with Panda Bear and his Animal Collective bros but unlike that sector of their cheerful lite-noise brethren, choose sample sources as ugly and jarring as possible. This can hide how sophisticated their compositions are. Retina Riddim is probably one of the year's only records that could handle a bit of a comparison to Proust-small things, memories, snatches of sound and sensation recur again and again. Time passes but it's not a linear time. Somehow it's hard to like the DVD as much-something about literalizing the audio. There are kaleidoscopes. The screen bifurcates, fractalizes. There are ocean shots and shots of Bougatsos outdoors. The footage is sharp-- for instance, the chopped and looped live performance towards the end is such a good representation of what you're hearing you can't help but laugh - but there's more to what they're doing than the DVD's all too literal smoke and mirrors. Even monkeys know not to mess with a good thing.","This began only as a film project and, like Panda Bear's Person Pitch, is a synthetic collage masquerading as an organic outburst.

Tio Bitar,Dungen,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0869d034d5c69bf48b3/1:1/w_160/afb7a02e.jpg,2007-05-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10226-tio-bitar/,KemadoSubliminal Sounds,"Dungen took longer to catch on than your average overnight sensation. In 2004, momentarily existing outside the micro-managed Web 2.0 landscape, the band shouted a hearty Swedish ""surprise"" with their excellent Ta Det Lugnt. It may have been the language barrier-- or the fact that the collection was released by Subliminal Sounds, a smallish Stockholm-based label known as much for its exotica/cocktail bent as for its underground psych fetish-- but the group seemed to come out of nowhere, with little advance word or ground-level buzz. Of course, we're talking stateside reception. At home in Sweden, they'd already undergone a post-major label backlash (and, after flourishing elsewhere, a sheepish critical rebirth). Since those days of relative anonymity, though, Dungen have toured extensively as a four-piece, reissued and reconfigured older material, and connected with the New York-based Kemado label, who in 2005 issued a super-sized Ta Det Lugnt. Despite the flurry, Dungen's reputation still rests on that one gem of a record in its original, slimmer state: The early material wasn't that great, and the extras included on the deluxe edition felt gratuitous. Now, three years after that album's first release, Dungen has issued Tio Bitar, album number four. Worth the wait? Well, bad news first: There's no ""Panda"". But then, it's a different, imperfect monster: Tio Bitar explores the mellower side of psychedelia, working largely as the dusk-backdropped counterpoint to the band's earlier fireworks. Dungen mastermind Gustav Ejstes has spent the past few years studying fiddle with a Swedish master, and while it adds another distinctive layer to the group's distinguished sound, its omnipresence lends the album a decidedly different feel. Perhaps the album's strangest attribute, though, is how even a few of the best songs here-- excluding, of course, tracks like ""Gör Det Nu"" or ""Du Ska Inte Tro Att Det Ordnar Sig"", on which the band unequivocally succeeds-- come off as something gorgeous in the background, rather than the in-your-hair, fist-pumping rockers Dungen seems to have intended. The record opens extraordinarily with ""Intro"", a fried stage-setting rocker that massages one of guitarist Reine Fiske's majestically distended, havoc-wreaking guitar lines (and extended chords) through repeating flutes and busybody drums. As counterpoint, the next track, ""Familj"", is pleasantly airy, an afternoon Dungen pastoral that could go on forever. Then, the band summons stormclouds with the blustery, thundering ""Gör Det Nu"", echoing ""Intro"" in sheer fret magick, and shredding off any remembrance of its golden-skied predecessor. But, perhaps acknowledged by its title (Tio Bitar translates as ""10 Pieces""), the album doesn't always congeal. One song may uncharacteristically plod while the next overreaches. Most of its tracks are brief-- six clock in under four minutes, one above eight-- but while the tracks weren't much longer on Ta Det Lugnt, they all felt titanic. Granted, Tio Bitar's aesthetic pull aims for somewhat different horizons than the last album's larger, more energized sound, but-- tough love, guys, tough love-- where even Ta Da Lugnt's verdant instrumentals hooked talons into you, a few of these suites slide past like water off a duck's back. Instrumentally, of course, the album is airtight. Its loose, colorful sunbursts of bright fiddle, guitar, organs, drums, tambourines, and flute find the band perhaps at their most technically proficient to date. In promotional material, we're reminded Dungen is basically the omni-instrumental Ejstes accompanied by guitar ace Reine Fiske, and here, Fiske's leads are the stars: Despite the band's overall move toward a quieter gentleness, his guitars cook with a unrestrained, Hendrixian sizzle. The drums, too, have their colossal moments-- especially when twisting out seismic rolls on ""Svart Är Himlen"". (Who's the more fun multi-instrumental drummer, Mascis or Ejstes?) Still, chops alone can't salvage the midtempo ""Ett Skäl Att Trivas"", which sounds and feels like Dungen, but, with its lifeless drums and soporific bassline, bores very much unlike Dungen. Or, the one gigantic track, ""Mon Amour"", which recedes into extended soloing, forgoing the band's usual, admirable restraint for the kind of hippie self-indulgence they've always managed to transcend. Even given these disappointments, though, the record is far from a dramatic departure from the band's previous outings-- you'd certainly never mistake it for another band-- and its few missteps are well balanced by a handful of blissful, seismic bright pockets. Just be ready for its late-afternoon haze: Leave your acid on the porch and grab the bong instead.","After extensive touring, reissuing older material, and recasting their breakthrough album, 2004's Ta Det Lugnt, Gustav Ejstes and company finally release their follow-up, on which they explore the mellower side of psychedelia.

Betty Davis / They Say I'm Different,Betty Davis,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07dea9e61561daa6627/1:1/w_160/576b07b6.gif,2007-05-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11903-betty-davis-they-say-im-different/,Just SunshineJust Sunshine,"It's rare that a pop history footnote looms as large as the figures she's meant to support, but then again, Betty Davis is one hell of a footnote. Malcolm Gladwell groupies can tell you all about ""connectors,"" roaming person-to-person hubs that link disparate corners of society. Well, in the late 1960s, Betty Davis-- then Betty Mabry-- was the link connecting such luminaries as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Miles Davis, the latter ultimately contributing his last name through a relatively short but tumultuous marriage. His 1968 album Filles de Kilimanjaro features then-model Betty on the cover; the track ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" was inspired by her. As legend has it, Miles grew jealous of Betty's friendship with Hendrix (which Miles allegedly suspected may have been more than that), but Betty's place in the middle of this intersection of geniuses apparently resulted in more than just divorce filings. By popular account, it was Betty who turned Miles on to Sly and Jimi, which in turn may have been the catalyst for Miles' most radical musical evolution: the still awe-inspiring Bitches Brew, released in 1970, a year after his separation from Betty. Betty Davis' own response was her self-titled 1973 debut, a groundbreaking slab of funk that featured a huge hunk of the Family Stone (it was produced by drummer Greg Errico) and fused soul, sex, and hard rock like the best Sly or Funkadelic disc, albeit from a female perspective. But if George Clinton waved his freak flag proudly, Betty Davis wore it as underwear then rubbed your face in it. An oft-quoted passage in Miles Davis' autobiography gets it just right: ""If Betty were singing today she be something like Madonna, something like Prince, only as a woman,"" wrote Davis back in 1989. ""She was the beginning of all that when she was singing as Betty Davis."" No doubt. Betty Davis never gives up in its aim to seduce and destroy; songs like ""If I'm In Luck I Might Get Picked Up"", ""Ooh Yeah"", and ""Game is My Middle Name"" are raw and relentless in their intent. Then-Afrophile nympho Brian Eno might have called it Music for Fucking, though the semi-classic ""Anti Love Song"" is music for fucking with, specifically fucking with a former lover many suspect is Miles, but who might as well be any man stupid enough to do Betty wrong (in every sense). Davis' part banshee/part Amazon shriek isn't the smoothest delivery system for seduction, but it does get the point across. Supposedly it was Marc Bolan who encouraged Davis to write her own songs, and there's no question Davis understood the best way for her to perform them was to wail like she was about to bite someone's head off. As underscored by Oliver Wang's informative liner notes (drawn in part from one of the only interviews Davis has consented to in the last several decades), Davis' ever-growing sense of empowerment played a part in her decision to self-produce her 1974 record, They Say I'm Different. While the self-titled disc's band (which also included Neal Schon on guitar and future disco queen Sylvester on backing vocals) was dissolved, the sound remained mostly the same, and Davis' outré sexuality just as out there. On ""He Was a Big Freak"", she essentially spars with a lover over who is freakier: the whipped or the whip-wielder. ""Git In There"" is house party in progress. The defensive title track finds Davis casting herself against her grandfather's more traditional blues favorites, while ""Don't Call Her No Tramp"" makes a distinction between an ""elegant hustler"" and a hooker (according to Wang, the song drew the ire of the NAACP for its ""demeaning"" depiction of black women). It's a slightly slicker album than its predecessor, but no less unreserved. Yet despite the fact that these albums drip with personality, Betty Davis remains something of an enigma. Her catalog (including a short but confusing and uneven string of follow-ups to They Say I'm Different) have gone in and out of print over the years, while the singer herself is reportedly living in Pittsburgh, broke, bemused but largely ignoring the attention her brief career continues to garner. And no wonder: Light in the Attic claims Davis never received any royalties from previous releases. Without steady checks coming in, what's cult fame even worth? Better to just keep on keeping on and let other folks parse out the legacy, but hopefully these reissues will remedy the situation. Anyone whose albums sound as electric as ever over 30 years late deserves more than Davis has received.",,8.9,
"The Dead Will Walk, Dear",The National Lights,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b077b1335d7bf169a111/1:1/w_160/0f0269c9.jpg,2007-05-21 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10214-the-dead-will-walk-dear/,Bloodshake,"Sick, sick, sick. That's what this album is. Oh sure, it sounds pretty, with its gentle, mostly acoustic arrangements, whispery vocals, and other folkish whatnot, but wait a second. All those references to grinding bones and eating flesh and burying things aren't metaphors or poetic turns of phrase-- they're actually about killing people, eating them, and burying them. Songwriter and principle vocalist Jacob Thomas Berns sounds musically well adjusted, but I get the feeling he was the kid who worried his eight grade English teacher with disturbing journal entries about sexual violence and cold-blooded murder. Berns is abetted by two accomplices in these crimes. Multi-instrumentalist Ernest Christian Kiehne, Jr. colors the arrangements with jaunty banjo, some lovely steel guitar, and the occasional subdued organ part, while second vocalist Sonya Maria Cotton, who is a really damn fine singer, gets down in the dirt with Berns and assists in the drownings, statutory rapes, and shootings with disconcerting ease. ""Let me cover you up/ With my flannel shirt/ Your skin so cold without a skirt on."" Those are the opening lines of the record, on a song called ""Better For It, Kid"". Uh, yeah. Take the ""kid"" part literally and you pretty much figured out what happens in the song. The very next track, ""Mess Around"", opens with a guy talking to a young girl, telling her it's okay if she wants to mess around, and goes on to say that her body will be found before her hair can grow out long. But the music is this pretty acoustic fingerpicking and the vocals are more fragile than Delftware-- it's an insidious and nauseating juxtaposition, but it's no worse than some of the darkest murder ballads that populate the established songbook. If nothing else, the little bird that lit down on Henry Lee has some company now. So here's the thing: I can't decide if this is all unforgivably repulsive or totally ingenious. The record disarms you so thoroughly with its gentleness and lack of dissonance that when you get to figuring out the content, you almost become like one of the victims from Berns' songs. There are moments of striking beauty, like the steel guitar intro to ""O, Ohio"" or the organ passage that takes up the end of ""Buried Treasure"", which is fairly close to Low's ""Sunflower"" in its overall feeling. Cotton's lead vocals on ""Swimming in the Swamp"" are coldly perfect as she sings matter-of-factly about disposing of a body with dirt in its mouth in a vast swamp. My overall impression is conflicted-- the songs are nice-sounding but not terribly memorable melodically, and they all tend to follow a formula of a couple verses followed by a short instrumental passage, the last of which finally goes fully electric, with a wailing e-bowed guitar part. As much as I love brevity, I think they might benefit from stretching out a bit and developing the stories in the songs. The combination of dainty folk music with murderous and lecherous themes is decently executed, but you have to wonder if they can do it again without it feeling tired. Personally, I can't decide whether to listen to it once more or stop Berns before he kills again.","Band from Richmond, Va. juxtaposes delicate indie folk with tales of extreme violence and mayhem, updating the murder ballad for the era of the slasher film.

All That to the Wall,The Narrator,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07bb1335d7bf169a119/1:1/w_160/2ab4d31c.jpg,2007-05-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10218-all-that-to-the-wall/,Flameshovel,"With their infamously hectic live show and small catalog that's been tantalizing but spotty, I never thought the Narrator wanted to be just another above-average indie guitar band. I just figured they had yet to realize their ambitions on record. With All That to the Wall, however, the Narrator have indeed recorded an above-average indie guitar record, and in doing so have probably made their most cohesive and listenable full-length yet. Don't take that as backhanded-- there's no way to capture in the studio hoarse catharsis, ringing ears, collapsing floorboards, errant bodily fluids, saxophonists in pink bunny suits, or whatever other shit happens at the band's shows, and I'd guess this record is borne of that realization. It's not a question of lowering the bar; it's knowing the difference between a performance and an album. The basic sound of the band hasn't changed significantly, but the difference is clear right away: On opener ""Son of Son of the Kiss of Death"", the guitars are still winding and spidery, but the vocals have been refined considerably, their frayed and flailing yelp becoming more expressive at every turn. The stiff fingering of the verses shifts to a surprisingly catchy, straightforward chorus, with just a few keyboard notes poking through before they finally grind through some cacophonous bent notes in the outro. Even with that, they sound more patient, balanced, and focused. No doubt that they're stronger songwriters now: anthems like ""SurfJew"" can stand up to rushed beats and sweaty deconstruction on stage as well as repeat listens on headphones. (Best I can tell, it's about a west coast Bar Mitzvah, but the band's lyrics have been largely nonsense and that trend continues here.) But more than that, they've integrated their previously rough edges and found ways to responsibly sabotage their perkier pop tendencies, presenting accessible songs with unusual production choices. ""Son of the Son of the Kiss of Death"" stops everything for a backwards-sucking string sound, there's a theremin-like keyboard drone in ""Speeding up the Gang"", and later tracks like ""A Decade in Kentucky"" utilize strange echoes and flanges. The record's centerpiece is a Bob Dylan cover. If that surprises you, the song they chose will really throw you: ""All the Tired Horses"", which is given a faithful and somber reading. Not only does it show how far their singing has come, it also includes anachronistic production touches like heavily-reverbed Max Weinberg-style drum hits and the synthetic pluck of simulated strings, lending it a nostalgic but weirdly out-of-time quality. Funny that there's a gradual downhill slide after the cover, though there's a memorable staccato delivery in ""Papal Airways"", and a weary but impressively building melody on ""Breaking the Turtle"", one last gasp of the band showing what they're made of before the tired, almost pop-punk toss-off of ""A Decade in Kentucky"". Armchair critics have long cited ""All the Tired Horses"" as a sort of commentary on the creative exhaustion Dylan was feeling at the time, a judgment based on the homonym present in the lyric, ""How'm I gonna get any riding done"" (substituting ""writing"" for ""riding""). Given the more sluggish second half of this record, you could say the Dylan song signifies the Narrator's fatigue-- they did lose a drummer not long ago, and grabbed fill-ins from Russian Circles and Oxford Collapse to finish the record. But there's something endearing in how they present this on-the-nose version of an imperfect castaway with all sincerity. The Narrator sound better on record with less to prove, making imperfect pop out of their rough edges, and turning fuck-ups into hymns.","By moving away from the sound of their rambunctious stage show and refining their vocals, the Narrator manage their most cohesive and listenable collection of songs to date.

Pterodactyl,Pterodactyl,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b076c0084474cd0c1c59/1:1/w_160/5e23cedc.jpg,2007-05-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10213-pterodactyl/,Brah,"A brief series of birdcalls open Pterodactyl's self-titled debut. The misty chirps don't evoke the prehistoric lizard after which the Brooklyn-via-Ohio band named themselves-- more like the tiny creatures that wake you early on weekends. Regardless of who owns the peeps, it's a fitting 11 seconds, because even when Pterodactyl pushes for fury, a melodic sweetness and nerdy fragility hover within the trio's chiming guitars and cymbal crashes: These birds cackle, giggle, brim with sugar-coated spastics. Folks use ""Brooklyn noise-rock"" to describe things that aren't so noisy, and maybe not even from Brooklyn. This particular not-so-noisy Brooklyn band is often linked to labelmates Parts & Labor. First the practical reasons for the pairing: two thirds of P&L released Pterodactyl's last 7-inch, along with the vinyl version of this one, on their Cardboard label. You could connect dots musically, but it's more telling to jot differences: drummer Matt Marlin goes easier on his equipment than P&L's Christopher R. Weingarten; Pterodactyl's harmonies aren't as sonically or psychedelically deep; P&L is a longer-running crew, able to draw from a bigger aesthetic/experiential bag of licks. Pterodactyl can be raw, goofy, or upfront. The album's most compelling tracks, though, sport a high level of sampler-amped sumptuousness; they find a way to loop and rotate without losing steam. ""Safe Like A Train"" turns Sonic Slinty sharps into merry-go-rounds layered with clipped nasal pop-boy song-birding; on ""Polio"", muscular, slaphappy drums and slippery guitars lap against high, airy Jane's Addiction vocals; ""Three Succeed"" pits loping Deerhoofed staccato with duct-taped harmonies that make perfect sense on a label run by Oneida. The rush of ""Ask Me Nicely"" is a pummeling, snotty punk blast. Not everything is such a triumph. ""Rampage, Pt. 1"", which introduces a mid-level pace and Modest Mouse-like sing-a-long, drags, though there's still something slinky about it. Also scattered throughout the program are a few too many micro-sound bits/bytes and instrumental fragments that, unlike the initial tweets, don't add much beyond padding... Not bad, but might as well cut to the chase. Thankfully, momentum's recovered torrentially on ""CHX. BX."", a Lighting Bolt-speed rocker, and the stately, time-ticking closer ""Esses"", which finds the group experimenting successfully with a slow-arcing six-minute build of barber-shopped, Beach-Boyed pop. Where those tiny incidentals and mid-tempo songs drag, this expansion's an emphatic exclamation. As groups grow increasingly sophisticated in genre blending, they can reject simplicity en route to aesthetic expansiveness. Spread your wings bravely, cool-- but it doesn't always work. As 2001 as it sounds, sometimes it best suits a group when they forgo the fancy shit and just rock. Interestingly, ""Esses"" shows Pterodactyl are capable of opening it up incrementally-- something to look forward to in the future. For now, the youngsters' collection, one of my favorite surprises of 2007, more often than not hits best when it plows ahead like an out-of-control pickup truck.","Brooklyn noise-rock band isn't so noisy, really, as a melodic sweetness and nerdy fragility hover within its chiming guitars and cymbal crashes.

Do You Trust Your Friends?,Stars,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0985e6ef95969321fc6/1:1/w_160/d463a919.jpg,2007-05-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10240-do-you-trust-your-friends/,Arts & Crafts,"In recent years, everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Architecture in Helsinki to Bloc Party have succumbed to the temptation to create indie remix albums. Now we're faced with Stars' Do You Trust Your Friends?, which we may someday see as the tipping point from indie rock remix albums being idle, indulgent fan-club novelties to becoming inescapable annoyances. Helpfully, it gathers all the transgressions of the trend into one convenient package: incestuous choice of collaborators, unimaginative use of technology, and reconfiguration that uniformly fails to improve on the originals. It also ups the criminal ante by revisiting, track-by-track, an album that's already three years old (Set Yourself on Fire) and splitting the time between flimsy remixes and lazy covers; in other words, Stars has commissioned their own tribute album. The sheer egotism is the most impressive thing about it. Final Fantasy's leadoff take on ""Your Ex-Lover is Dead"" sets the tone, lying limply between remix and cover. Preserving Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan's vocals, Owen Pallett fills in the rest with waltzy piano and random string bursts that seem fairly oblivious to the song, sounding more like an audition to be Jon Brion's film-soundtrack intern than a new take on a song that was already more effectively cinematic to begin with. And Pallett's not the only one who utilizes the ""hey let's attach the original vocal track to whatever random shit we have lying around"" method, as the Most Serene Republic short-circuit the glistening synth-pop of ""Ageless Beauty"" by layering Millan's singing over an aimless acoustic jam, and the Stills use ""Soft Revolution"" as a riff-and-solo trashcan, with a horrible pan-flute solo as frosting. Even when the covers sound less like a band cleaning out their hard drive, the reinterpretations misunderstand Stars' appeal and strengths. Both Apostle of Hustle's slack ""One More Night"" and the Russian Futurists' breakbeat-and-power-chord ""The First Five Times"" over-masculinize the sleepy and sensitive Stars sound, while retaining none of their romantic grandeur. Only Broken Social Scene alumnus Jason Collett's top-to-bottom remake of ""Reunion"" offers any sort of surprising alternate take, turning the song into a ragged, Stonesy number that's far enough afield of Stars' usual M.O. to justify the makeover. In the actual remix department, there are multiple examples of the most common rearrangement gaffes. Camouflage Nights' ""Celebration Guns"" and the Dears' ""What I'm Trying to Say"" (inexplicably split into two parts) both commit the crime of reproduction, with new versions mostly adhering to the originals' structure and sounds and merely moving the sonic furniture around a bit (""hey, what if the chorus drumbeat was the drumbeat for the verses!""). Then there are the tracks that are completely electronified, but to little result, like the Junior Boys' phoned-in ""Sleep Tonight"", perhaps the most promising (given the Boys' remix know-how), and therefore disappointing, track on Friends. Minotaur Shock (with ""The Big Fight"") and Metric (""He Lied About Death"") at least get a little ambitious, but both leave the oven undercooked, the former rendered somewhat uncomfortable by gallons of empty space, and the latter fixated like a third-grader on the swear-word lyric ""don't fuck with our lives"" as it runs a psych-loop treadmill. All together, Do You Trust Your Friends? is an ideal demonstration of why the trend of indie rock remix records should be snuffed out before they becomes industry standard. While we understand the urge to create this kind of stopgap project, either as a way to keep an artist's name in the newswire, a chance to make some extra pocket change with minimal work, or an opportunity to promote some musical pals, as an artistic statement these releases almost uniformly fail to creatively re-imagine any of the source material, only serving to fill the market with inferior versions. Ideally, indie bands will restrict their remixing impulses to B-sides and blog leaks, utilize artists with some experience and talent in the art, and spare us from the feeble, immaterial album-length likes of Friends.","For some reason, Stars decide to take a three-year-old album and commission their own tribute to it.

Boxer,The National,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09aea9e61561daa6654/1:1/w_160/7a4f09b9.jpg,2007-05-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10242-boxer/,Beggars Banquet,"Among critics and fans, the National's third album Alligator has become synonymous with the term grower. Released to minor acclaim early in 2005, the album has since quietly and steadily built up a large, avid listenership. Matt Berninger's lyrics-- initially off-putting and seemingly obtuse in their non sequiturs and stray details-- proved unpretentiously poetic over time. His sober baritone and dogged repetition of phrases and passages made it sound like he was trying to figure the songs out in tandem with the listener. The band, meanwhile, played around the hooks instead of hard-selling them, so that in a sense, despite two previous albums and a killer EP, we all pretty much learned how to listen to the National on Alligator, eventually finding deeper shades of meanings in the words, sympathizing with Berninger's anxieties, laughing at his grim jokes, and tapping out the band's complex rhythms on desktops and steering wheels. It's a testament to the good will engendered by Alligator that fans are now likewise calling the National's follow-up, Boxer, a grower. Despite the scrutiny greeting its release (brought on by the inevitable leaks), many listeners seem to be approaching these songs patiently, giving Boxer the space and time to reveal its dark, asymmetrical passageways. In a sense, the album demands it. The same elements that kept listeners returning to Alligator (Berninger's clever turns of phrase, the band's dramatic intensity) are present on Boxer, but are now more restrained and controlled. From the first piano chords on opener ""Fake Empire"", the National create a late-night, empty-city-street mood, slightly menacing but mostly isolated. The 10 tracks that follow sustain and even amplify that feeling, revealing the band's range as they play close to the vest. Aaron and Bryce Dessner's twin guitars don't so much battle one another as create a unified layer that acts as a full backdrop for the other instruments, while touring member Padma Newsome's string and horn arrangements infuse songs like ""Mistaken for Strangers"" and the stand-out ""Ada"" (featuring Sufjan Stevens on piano) with subtle drama. But Boxer is a drummer's album: Bryan Devendorf becomes a main player here, never merely keeping time but actively pushing the songs around. With machine precision, his fluttering tom rhythms add a heartbeat to ""Squalor Victoria"" and give ""Brainy"" its stalker tension. In fact, the title Boxer could conceivably be a reference to the way his rhythms casually spar with Berninger's vocal melodies, jabbing and swinging at the singer's empathies and emotions. Despite this implied violence, Boxer doesn't have the same aggressive self-reckoning and psychological damage assessment of Alligator. Here, Berninger sounds like he's able to look outward from that mental space instead of further inward. He observes the people around him-- friends, lovers, passersby-- alternately addressing them directly and imagining himself in their minds. Or, as he sings on ""Green Gloves"", ""Get inside their clothes with my green gloves/ Watch their videos, in their chairs."" He sounds more genuinely empathetic than previously (the accusatory you from the first two albums is thankfully absent), toying with ambiguity and backing away from outright satire. Certain themes continue to prevail: He maintains a fear of white-collar assimilation, addressing ""Squalor Victoria"" and ""Racing Like a Pro"" to upwardly mobile hipster-yuppies (""Underline everything/ I'm a professional/ In my beloved white shirt""), and clings to his American angst (""We're half awake in a fake empire""), as though recognizing the world's craziness makes him more sane. Better even than these songs are the three mid-album tracks that toy with a love = war metaphor that miraculously avoids the obviousness that implies. On ""Slow Show"", over background guitar drones and a piano theme that echoes U2's ""New Year's Day"", he daydreams, ""I want to hurry home to you/ Put on a slow dumb show for you/ Crack you up."" But the capper is in the coda: ""You know I dreamed about you for 29 years before I saw you."" That hard-won contentment begins to crumble in ""Apartment Story"", in which the world invades the couple's shared space, and in ""Start a War"", where the possibility of loss looms threateningly. ""Walk away now and you're gonna start a war,"" Berninger sings against the band's simple, uncomfortably insistent rhythm, his concrete fears giving the song the extra heft of the personal. Obviously, it's pretty easy to read a lot into the National's music and especially into Berninger's lyrics, but that shouldn't imply that Boxer is a willfully difficult or overly academic work. Like those on their last album, these songs reveal themselves gradually but surely, building to the inevitable moment when they hit you in the gut. It's the rare album that gives back whatever you put into it.","Matt Berninger and co. follow their 2005 grower Alligator-- an excellent album that we initially underrated-- with another patient record full of clever turns of phrase and dramatic intensity, here even more restrained and controlled.

Trueno Oscuro,Monotract,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07413d197565213a48a/1:1/w_160/674d0a60.jpg,2007-05-18 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10211-trueno-oscuro/,Load,"When I first saw Monotract at 2004's inaugural No Fun Fest, the trio was hunkered over tables, poking at laptops and twiddling mixer knobs. The setup made sense; since Carlos Giffoni's solo work to that point consisted primarily of electronic-based noise, it figured he would surround himself with like-minded sound-makers in a group setting. It turns out that show was an anomaly-- Monotract's roots actually lie more in fractured punk rock than experimental noise. Since forming in Miami in 1998 (and moving to New York in 2000), they have produced a slew of releases exploring many sonic styles and instrumental configurations. But most often, the group starts from a foundation of guitar, bass, and drums. Last year's Xprmntl Lvrs gave the most balanced version of Monotract's noise/rock amalgam, with punkish beats and semi-melodic vocals grafted to harsh electronics and guitar distortion. Trueno Oscuro (which means ""Dark Thunder"") also stitches rock and noise into one monstrous hybrid, but leans farther toward the rock side than any previous Monotract release: Nearly every song here has a big, bold beat, supplied by the mix-dominating pound of drummer Roger Rimada. On top of that huge pulse, Giffoni and bassist/vocalist Nancy Garcia spin thorny noise, sauntering bass, and rhythmic vocal chants. This spastic combination can produce oddly funky tunes-- a kind of skewed dance-noise akin to the fractured chug of RTX, the disco damage of Ciccone Youth, or even the hardcore crunch of Atari Teenage Riot. There's also something sultry and even seductive about the way Monotract swings and sways here, especially during the songs sung by Garcia. On ""Big N"", her breathy half-spoken vocals cascade over Ramada's hip-hop beat like syrup over pancakes, while her urgent yelps at the close of ""Muddy Thunder"" bewitch like Lydia Lunch's best screams. On the only cut without drums, ""Under My Arm"", she tentatively whispers over whirring drone, her voice a siren as entrancing as Kim Gordon's on Sonic Youth's ""Shadow of a Doubt"". When Rimada and Giffoni sing, Monotract's sound gets a little less unpredictable. The marching thump of ""Ballad of Lechon"", DNA-like stop/start of ""Cafu y Kaka"", and metallic stomp of ""Mar Roja"" are all meaty enough on their own, but strung together they feel like blurry photocopies of each other. But whatever repetition Trueno Oscuro suffers from is easily offset by the record's many high points, making for another unique entry in Monotract's rainbow-colored catalog.","This Carlos Giffoni-led experimental group's noise/rock amalgam leans farther toward the rock side than any previous Monotract release, as nearly every song here has a big, bold beat supplied by mix-dominating drummer Roger Rimada.

Everything Last Winter,Fields,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0819d034d5c69bf48aa/1:1/w_160/22a1a5dc.jpg,2007-05-18 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10223-everything-last-winter/,Atlantic,"London quintet Fields grabbed headlines overseas last year for the label bidding war that ultimately found them a place with venerable Warner Music Group subsidiary Atlantic. If there's anything American indie rock fans have largely rediscovered in the last couple of years, it's that a jump to a major label doesn't necessarily mean a band has started to suck. Among the more recent examples, Death Cab for Cutie and then the Decemberists executed the transition with only minor stylistic changes, the latter group if anything becoming weirder. Fields haven't started to suck, either, but they have gone from winsome guitar-pop group to unwieldy big-room behemoths. Maybe they figured Muse's shift toward glammed-out dance-rock on last year's Supermassive Black Hole left room for another purveyor of overly compressed post-Radiohead mope. Everything Last Winter still has the close boy/girl harmonies, insistent songwriting, and restrained squalls of the band's early releases, including 2006's 7 From the Village EP; it's still, in the words of Pitchfork's Stuart Berman, a ""Zach Braff panty-remover soundtrack."" On the other hand, it's harder to get someone else naked when you keep putting on more and more layers of clothing. Like another hushed UK indie band gone arena-ready, Snow Patrol, Fields really do have the tunes and the detached grandeur to one day potentially play big venues. While their songs may lack the wounded emotional verisimilitude of Gary Lightbody's best work, they share his Glasgow band's predilection for restrained, shoegaze-indebted white-noise tendrils. Single ""If You Fail We All Fail"" distills the band's perpetually ascending shimmer into nearly six minutes of electronic Slowdive swirls, submerged acoustic guitars, and the vocal interplay of singer/guitarist Nick Peill with keyboardist Thorunn Antonia. ""I need you as much as they do,"" the two murmur, their vaguely pleasant vagueness almost (but never quite) overcome by superfluous overdubs and reverb. This is where college-town babies come from. As big as the heart-swelling hooks get, though, Fields are more memorable when they let their early-1970s folk ghosts creep into the corners of their songs like dusty cobwebs. Antonia's breathy coo takes the lead amid the modal whir of ""Feathers"", but the song loses its way in the woods during a final crescendo of whitecapped guitar, strings, and effects. The lofty vocal harmonies of Peill, Antonia, and drummer Henry Spenner finally get some space to settle in on languid acoustic waltz ""Schoolbooks"". Songs such as these, the ironically sweet ""Skulls and Flesh and More"" and lilting campfire closer ""Parasite"" suggest Fields might've been like a more mystical Magic Numbers if there had never been a Doves or Elbow. The band (and producer Michael Beinhorn, whose credits include Korn, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden along with Mew and Herbie Hancock), must have had other ideas. Surging opener ""A Song for the Fields"", here in its latest of many incarnations, encapsulates Fields' shift from folk-tinged British rockers to red-line anthem hawkers, thick with so many heavily compressed effects and guitar fireworks that the song has, paradoxically, gotten less direct even as it's become more radio-polished. Perhaps it's as Peill proclaims over a Snow Patrol thrum on ""Charming the Flames"": ""Passion makes you vain."" Halloween-ready rocker ""The Death"" is an ill-advised sojourn into demonic whispers (unsurprisingly, Beinhorn has also produced Marilyn Manson). On the Pete Yorn-like ""You Don't Need This Song (To Fix Your Broken Heart)"", yet another track that undercuts its catchiness with anonymizing slickness, Peill adds, ""Sing this song like any other one/ 'Cause they're all the same."" Thing is, they're really not, but on Everything Last Winter it eventually starts to sound that way.","London quintet goes from winsome guitar-pop group to unwieldy big-room behemoths on its major-label debut.

It's the kind of amorphous sound mass you imagine at the beginning of the universe, an obliterative black-hole suction that takes modern cues only from the intuitive progressions of jazz and the chaotic sound atmospheres of electronic devices. Not to mention that post-rock is in the habit of forcing its cues, determined to hit that cathartic peak before the tape runs out. Supersilent, meanwhile, arrives at catharsis torturously if at all, preferring to let their variations unspool organically, reveling in unresolved tension and inertia. On his third full-length album for Rune Grammofon, Supersilent's virtuoso trumpeter Arve Henriksen explores the genesis of his own universe: Strjon is the medieval name of Henriksen's home town-- it roughly means ""streaming water,"" which even the most unsympathetic listener would have to admit is germane to the album's fluid, natural sound. Drawing from a wealth of home-taped sounds from his youth in Stryn, Henriksen recruited his Supersilent band mates Ståle Storløkken and Helge Sten to produce the album and to add keyboards and guitars to Henriksen's trumpet and electronics. But Strjon isn't an early demos thing; Henriksen simply used these early sketches as templates, allowing his modern polish to dovetail with his youthful zeal. The result is a quietly stunning album of fugues, stasis, and moods. Given the starkness of its sound palette and the restraint of its compositions, its allure is uncanny-- that melancholy trumpets threading through evocative drones doesn't wear thin over the album's forty-seven minutes is a testament to Henriksen's compositional ingenuity and ace musicianship. The album opens with ""Evocation"": The sinuous, quavering trumpet figure is at once ominous and inviting; it has a palpable whooshing quality that makes it sound almost like a reed instrument, and you get a distinct sense of the musician's subtle embrasure behind the sounds. As a bowed drone pushes in for contrast, Henriksen's theme breaks out of its unsteady rut and waxes lyrical. Amid the gently reverbed guitars of ""Leaf and Rock"", Henriksen plays a slightly throttled and darkly romantic theme that cracks emotively at its root notes. His trumpet springs tiny, squealing leaks over the angelic glimmer of ""In the Light"", and lurches through damaged iterations of the caesurae-divided theme of ""Evocation"". Elsewhere on the album, Henriksen breaks away from this satisfying but circumscribed approach to tinker with rhythm and mood. On ""Twin Lake"" cavernous guitar twinkles play off of hovering keyboards and Henriksen's bracingly high trumpet runs. Its nighttime-at-the-wharf aura is so strong you can practically smell the brine; all that's missing is the caw of gulls and the lonesome clank of a rusty pylon bell. The title track consists of nothing more than a primordial, modulating rumble; it's a study in soupy inertia. ""Green Water"" is light and airy with an atonal atmospheric buffer; percussive pings make it feel less nebulous than most of the album. ""Black Mountain"", a gyroscopic whirl of clipped, aggressive synth peals, is also atypically kinetic. And on ""Glacier Descent"", which is remindful of Growing with its shivering melodic cycles and low textural rumbles, Henriksen intones clear vowels over droning throat singing, gradually gathering it all up into a celestial crescendo. It's worth noting that the presence of a voice doesn't humanize ""Glacier Descent"" to any greater degree than the instrumental songs on Strjon, an album that is remarkable for its intimacy and wordless expressivity.","On his third full-length album for Rune Grammofon, Supersilent's virtuoso trumpeter explores the genesis of his own life, drawing from a wealth of home-taped sounds from his youth.

Cendre,FenneszSakamoto,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b093c0084474cd0c1c8b/1:1/w_160/a51e9d7f.jpg,2007-05-18 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10236-cendre/,Touch,"This piano/electronics duo is an arrangement Ryuichi Sakamoto has been recently exploring in concert, with ultra-minimalist Alva Noto among others, so it seems a natural for his second collaboration with Christian Fennesz. Listening to Cendre after returning again to Sala Saint Cecilia, their EP from 2005, affirms that the two records couldn't be more different. The latter was a single live 19-minute track that found Sakamoto inhabiting the abstract digitalia we've come to associate with Fennesz, directing his diverse talent toward epic computer-based composition. Cendre feels like a meeting of equals occurring precisely halfway between the two. The obvious precursors here are the two albums composer Harold Budd made with producer Brian Eno. Like Ambient 2/Plateaux of Mirror and The Pearl, Cendre consists of one person playing delicate pieces on an acoustic piano while another fills the ample spaces with electronic treatments. Eno's contributions to the Budd records were sometimes so subtle you weren't sure he was doing anything beyond giving the reverb slider an occasional bump. Fennesz' omnipresent drones and crackly beds of sound, on the other hand, are central here, providing a virtual room for Sakamoto's piano and regularly shifting the tone of the pieces by several shades in a given direction. Fennesz also plays and processes guitar, and he and Sakamoto both are credited with ""laptop."" There's an intriguing openness to this music, a sense of suggestion that nonetheless refuses to favor any particular mood. Fennesz and Sakamoto seem to be constantly searching for those in-between spaces, where serenity is infused with a sense of uneasiness and hope is laced with dread. The music's emotional cast can move in any of several directions depending on what the listener brings to it. Because of this atmospheric flexibility, Cendre as a whole is at first difficult to get a handle on, and single-word song titles like ""Trace"" and ""Mono"" provide few clues. Sometimes the musicians seem to be pushing against each other, as on ""Aware"". Here Sakamoto's right hand plays a soft melody while the disconcerting electronics stew and churn, a veritable cauldron of trouble and unease. ""Glow"" derives its energy from the contrast between the measured piano lines and the unpredictable surges of feedback and bits of cut-up guitar, which emerge like random flutters of sound bouncing against some Chopin nocturne. Elsewhere, the two composers seem to be working in concert toward a single goal, as with the title track, which is mostly electronic drone with bits of a garbled transmission and just a foreboding bass note or two from the piano. Ever since having my guts torn out by an encounter with Satie's Gymnopédies many years ago, a certain kind of piano makes me a little suspicious. From watching films, we're so used to hearing spare keyboard melodies propping up melodrama, it can seem too easy to rig an effect, so I've always got an ear out for something that feels manipulative. This music, which is most interesting when the record is heard at its full length, seems to come from a different place. With its even mood and patiently unfolding tracks, Cendre leaves a lot of time and space for contemplation, and there is the sense that the listener is expected to do some work to ""complete"" the music. Cendre seems to be a series of exquisitely phrased questions that we're all to answer as we wish.","The second collaboration between Ryuichi Sakamoto and Christian Fennesz is vastly different from their 2005 EP Sala Saint Cecilia.

Miss Diamond to You,Kathy Diamond,by: Dominique Leone,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08ec0084474cd0c1c81/1:1/w_160/4189b228.jpg,2007-05-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10233-miss-diamond-to-you/,Permanent Vacation,"It's not hard to imagine a time when music comes from increasingly obscure sources, out from a corner of the smallest bedroom in an apartment shared by four people blogging about four different records, arranging tours on the fly (with about a 50-50 ratio of confirmed dates to TBAs), producing impeccable hybrid music for god knows what audience of downloaders and strangely bedfellowed word-of-mouthers. I'm not just talking about experimental stuff either, but ""pop"" and ""dance"" and ""indie,"" and did I mention ""pop""? It's not hard to imagine this because it's already happening. Chances are, you or someone you know has turned out a track in the last few months that sounds suspiciously accomplished, oddly amazing, and perhaps even deserving of widespread recognition; sure, software and various electronic machinery make music production easier, but they don't necessarily make it ""good,"" which is why people like Maurice Fulton, Kathy Diamond, and [insert your friend here] are such badasses. Fulton has been making and house and future-soul tracks for more than a decade under the guise of at least a dozen aliases and (usually) short-lived groups-- which means, you can't exactly call him a bedroom producer. However, in the best indie tradition, he manages to maintain an almost iconoclastic, stubbornly outsider profile. His fans (hello there) endlessly sing his praises while his gigs go late into the night and attract a weird mix of clubbers, hipsters, and electro-musos, but his MySpace blog posts can read like rants from an exiled deviant, going so far as to blacklist any potential ""friends"" repping for a certain hated former label. His records with wife Mutsumi Kanamori as Mu feature some of the best electronic, dance-ish music of the decade, yet still seem on the outer fringe of what you'll hear in a club on any given night. Diamond's résumé isn't as full, but she's hardly less independently minded. Originally from Sheffield, UK (Fulton's current residence), she describes the long, frequently frustrating road to self-releasing her music on her MySpace bio, and though that kind of story is hardly rare for independent musicians, the quality of the songs on her debut album is. Miss Diamond to You (with production credits for Fulton, though ""performed"" by his Syclops alias) is hard soul for beardos. However, it's also got hooks all over the place, accentuated by Fulton's never-intrusive mix of rock drums (""programmed"" of course), funky bass (definitely not programmed), and a countless array of synth patches that he uses both sparingly and to perfect accompanying effect. And yes, there's something about the record that sounds borne of a couple of people holed up in a small Sheffield studio; perhaps it's consistency of the sound from track to track, or maybe it's just the top-heavy, ultra-compressed timbre of Diamond's vocals which sound a bit on the demo-y side compared to, I don't know, Timbaland producing Nelly Furtado. Still, the songs and the beats don't lie: This is a good record. Diamond's vocal melodies in tunes like opener ""Between the Lines"" or her underrated 2006 single ""All Woman"" are airy but syncopated and percussive at just the right moments, as any melody worth its pop has to be. Her ""watch me, see me, love me, push me, pull me"" over Fulton's tight arrangement of slap bass, handclaps, and funky chicken-scratch guitar is like hearing Kylie Minogue perform with Chic, and when Fulton brings in the cavernous echo and salsa percussion on ""Until the Sun Goes Down"", what could easily have sounded overstuffed and eye-rollingly ""eclectic"" just comes out like a self-contained block party. Indeed, when the snare figure comes in, shortly succeeded by the churning, Tangerine Dream-y synth patterns (an increasingly hip sonic reference for dance producers), the track could pass for a break in a Mu song. And then Diamond comes in with the vocal, and it becomes immediately apparent: This is Pop. Ultimately, I guess that's part of the only disappointing aspect of the record. Where these songs beg to be played loud for large numbers of happy people, the vaguely homemade sound occasionally compacts what should be expansive. Make no mistake, subtle details of record mastering or mixing aren't enough to sink the songs, and if you heard this stuff in a DJ set between, say, a Lindstrøm track and a Deodato re-edit, you wouldn't notice anything except how hard it was tell which tracks were new and which were from 1983. And even then, you probably wouldn't care: The modern independent musician not only refuses to die, she's getting better and better every night.","Sheffield singer collaborates with Mu's Maurice Fulton for a record stuffed with hooks, accentuated by a never-intrusive mix of rock drums, funky bass, and synth patches used both sparingly and to perfect accompanying effect.

Ingleside Terrace,French Toast,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07aea9e61561daa661e/1:1/w_160/f03f07df.jpg,2007-05-17 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10217-ingleside-terrace/,Dischord,"Quick, name the last Dischord band you heard hyped. Fugazi? The Evens, maybe? Never? In a music marketplace where, sadly, the chart position that may matter most is who's climbing the port side of elbo.ws' homepage the fastest, a label like Dischord-- purposefully small, resourceful, and geographically focused-- often skates just beneath the world-wide wheel of publicity. To wit, while everyone was busy forming a mid-autumn opinion on Annuals, White Whale, and Matt & Kim last year, Dischord was busy doing what it's done for 27 years: Putting out fine records by District of Columbia bands from a small office on Beecher Street. While you were streaming, the Evens, Soccer Team (""Traffic Patterns"" kills), and-- most notably-- French Toast released largely unbuzzed, very good records. Indeed, elbo.ws reveals exactly one blog hosted one song from French Toast's excellent second album, Ingleside Terrace. In an even more damnable deed, Ingleside Terrace was released in October. This is finally our review. Ingleside Terrace is no groundbreaking album, but it does represent a long step forward in French Toast's short evolution. In a Cave, French Toast's debut as the duo of James Canty and Jerry Busher, was just fine, its ramshackle looseness worn best by Canty's imprecise guitar playing splayed out beneath his sociopolitical screeds and Busher's convoluted grooves building a base for his weary observations. Multi-instrumentalists both, Canty and Busher split drum, bass, guitar and lead vocal duties almost exactly in half. That in mind, In a Cave often felt wobbly and overly stylized. Ingleside Terrace, though, adds third member and songwriter Ben Gilligan, and that changes everything. His thick-tongued flair and proletarian logic (""I'd be better at kissing if my teeth were all straight"") supply French Toast with equal parts Television thrum (""Take Me All the Way"") and mid-'90s alt.rock jangle (""Settle In""). Gilligan's addition gives the rest of the band room to breathe, too. Ideas and songs seem fully realized: The pop pops and the sulk sulks, and, over 12 tracks, three strong, separate, ultimately connected voices emerge. Busher, for instance, supplies two of the record's best moments with tracks recorded in his bedroom using loops, E-bow, acoustic guitar, keyboards, and tape decks. Busher's ""Treason"" and the eerie, perfectly couched rant ""Brejnev"" are the least rock songs on this record, and they seem perfectly comfortable with that rank. Closing track ""Fork in the Road""-- a full-band affair with Busher on guitar and James and Brendan Canty shaping a taut, automated rhythm-- even lets Busher imply a psychedelic oeuvre to French Toast, multiple guitars washing over one another and a stardust of staggered, dissonant keyboards. But French Toast are plenty grounded here: Even as a three-piece, they sound leaner and more focused, thanks in no small part to the production work of older brother, Fugazi drummer and Burn to Shine co-founder Brendan Canty. The kiss-off opener ""The Letter"" keeps the bros-in-a-basement rough edge intact, but its hinges swing better than anything from In a Cave, low-key three-part harmonies and a simple, driving rhythm invoking Leo at his most direct. It's a James Canty track that falls perfectly into ""Protest Sign"", a parallel Busher kiss-off that sounds like Mission of Burma throwing its hands in the air at political reform. Bad relationships and misguided political efforts eschewed by way of introduction, French Toast is free to coalesce as a three-piece for the entirety of Terrace, and that's exactly what they do. Ingleside Terrace boasts impeccable pacing, especially for a new lineup built on the backs of three divergent songwriters. Sure, they don't have a shtick and they don't have a PR machine at their back, but let this humble Dischord entry ($10 post-paid and available by mail order, as always) spin more than once, and you'll wish it was still October and you ran a blog.","With the addition of third member and songwriter Ben Gilligan, this D.C. Dischord band takes a long step forward in its short evolution. Fugazi's Brendan Canty-- older brother to one of the group's members-- handles production.

Burning Birthdays EP,Harlem Shakes,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b079ea9e61561daa661c/1:1/w_160/fe06eeba.jpg,2007-05-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10216-burning-birthdays-ep/,self-released,"Geography plays a funny trick on the brain when listening to new music, especially when that new music is an unsigned band with a self-recorded EP. Suppose someone told you the Harlem Shakes were from, say, Albuquerque and they employed good use of that ""Albuquerque keyboard sound."" Now you probably never heard of a keyboard sound from Albuquerque, but you may find yourself knowingly nodding anyway, and you have instant (albeit false) familiarity with this brand new group. Well, the Harlem Shakes aren't from Albuquerque, they're from (surprise!) New York, a city that rouses about a gazillion times more presumptions about its bands than nearly anywhere else on Earth. Blame it on the NYC indie explosion at the beginning of this decade, when bands as disparate as the Strokes, Interpol, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs were all credited with capturing the Big Apple's essence. At this point the label almost carries a stigma of pleasure and privilege, one which the Shakes-- a smart, young quintet that's run themselves ragged by endless touring and recording without a record deal the past few years-- just don't deserve. Burning Birthdays drips with sweat and elbow grease, though the EP is hardly a taxing listen. Despite toting an array of genres and ADHD song structures, the band seamlessly bounces along with the continuity of a stripped-down pop punk band. ""Red Right Hands"" opens with an artsy post-punk guitar line that nearly buries lead singer Lexy Benaim's vocals before melting into a warm, shuffling blues chorus wrapped in 21st century keyboards. Adding some muscle to the band's sound, a wall of backing harmonies supports nearly every song, a secret weapon that works especially effectively on opener ""Carpetbaggers"". While Benaim's thin vocals sometimes feel lost amidst the swirling instrumentation, the rest of the band coats nearly every melodic line on this track with a sunny splash of Beach Boys-style harmonies, elevating a simple ditty into full-fledged power pop anthem. Unlike so many up-and-coming New York bands, the Shakes avoid lingering in one narrow-minded framework. The harmonies may lend themselves to some throwback Spector-era comparisons, and some of the grander choruses may resemble a primordial New Pornographers or Walkmen, but thanks to a frenetic clip of hooks, you can't simply pigeonhole Burning Birthdays. Like a lot of young bands, the Shakes make several impressive nods to their formidable iTunes library, but a distinctive sound hasn't quite jelled yet. While 90% of Burning Birthdays feels like a tangential homage to the band's pet influences, the remaining portion hints at exciting things to come. This five-song combine workout proves the Shakes have the mental and physical tools to succeed at a higher level, but for now they're just blue chip prospects taking all their cues from the pros.","Self-released EP from a rising NYC band artfully crafting more 00s indie record-collector rock.

Cult Cargo: Grand Bahama Goombay,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0735e6ef95969321f83/1:1/w_160/abc6e3e5.jpg,2007-05-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10210-cult-cargo-grand-bahama-goombay/,Numero Group,"There's a tendency among Americans to think of the Bahamas as nothing but a tourist destination, a place to go snorkeling and get a tan. We tend to forget that people live there, that people were living there even before it became one of the first places in the Western Hemisphere to be spotted by Europeans. The country's population today is made up largely of the descendants of British loyalists who fled the U.S. after 1783, the slaves they brought with them and escaped slaves who took advantage of the short water route to the islands after slavery was abolished in the Crown colonies in 1834. The islands achieved self-governance in 1964, and 10 years later became fully independent from Britain, but most of the country's cultural and popular influence from outside came across the Straits of Florida. In the 60s and 70s, that meant jazz, rock, soul, and funk. The island of Grand Bahama is the closest to Florida, and during those decades played host to an intriguing music scene that lightly Caribbean-ized American soul and funk. The music that scene produced during its heyday is, like so much other global music from that era, very much in danger of disappearing from the collective memory-- a hot, rainy island that gets nailed by about one major hurricane each decade isn't the most conducive environment to keeping tapes and old LPs in top shape. Enter Numero Group, whose Cult Cargo series, now two volumes, extends the brilliant restoration work of their Eccentric Soul series beyond U.S. shores. They chose the word goombay for the title because of its myriad meanings on Grand Bahama-- it's a flavor, an annual festival, and most importantly for our purposes, both a drum and the style of music for which that drum provides the rhythm. In the 60s, Grand Bahama was in the early stages of a tourist boom that continues to the present day, and tourists begat hotels begat bands begat recordings. The key figure in the island's scene was a man named Frank Penn, a bartender/barber/carpenter who found himself in possession of the Bamboo East when its owner hopped the pond to the States. Penn set about transforming it into a youth music hotspot and ultimately parlayed its success into a record label, GBI International, which released most of the music on this compilation. Penn himself shows up on instrumental and vocal versions of his song ""Gimme Some Skin"", offering the opening couplet ""Black is beautiful/ White is nice"" in a gentle falsetto that floats right over the top of the locked-in drums, wah-soaked guitar, and bright, catchy horns. As his country gained its independence, Penn was integral in helping the people of his island discover their own thing, and interracial harmony was part of that vision. There were also plenty of good bands for Penn to record, and the Mustangs were one of the best. Their two tracks here are both laid-back soul killers. ""Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It"" bumps along on a slow but insistent rhythm, with the lead vocals joined in two-part harmony on key phrases, while ""The Time For Loving Is Now"" seems to be balancing influences from all over the Western Hemisphere, from Jamaica to Cuba to Detroit. The compilation incorporates a fairly eclectic batch of songs, including a few truly unexpected gems: Ozzie Hall's cover of Paul Desmond's ""Take Five"" is a brilliantly funky, even noir-ish recasting of the song (it also ignores the 5/4 rhythm that helped make the original famous), while Sylvia Hall's ""Don't Touch That Thing"" takes a slightly racy schoolyard chant advocating abstinence (""don't touch that thing/your belly gonna show,"" concludes the chorus) and turns it into a slice of breezy, instantly memorable funk. All these other artists are pretty much hors d'oeuvre for Jay Mitchell, though. The Grand Bahama native rules this compilation like he ruled the scene in Nassau, the Bahamian capital he left for as soon as he could. Mitchell very nearly had a career in the States-he toured with Otis Redding, who was slated to produce an album for him, but he instead returned to Freeport, Grand Bahama after tiring of road life and the pressure of trying to make it in the ocean of American pop music. It's clear from the five tracks here that he could have gone as far as he wanted to. The man was an adroit bandleader who presided over lengthy funk workouts like ""Funky Fever"" and ""Tighter & Tighter"" with charismatic authority, leading the band into fantastic breakdowns full of nasty breaks and peels of psychedelic guitar. He was capable of sweetness, too, as on his smooth, elegant 1968 cover of Edwin Starr's ""I Am the Man For You, Baby"". His ""Goombay Bump"", written by Penn, is a distinctively Bahamian creation, creating a dance around a fluid local rhythm. But it's his mind-blowing 13-minute cover of ""Mustang Sally"" that best highlights his genius. Apart from the lyrics, it doesn't even resemble the song we know, riding a sick drum beat and a healthy slathering of Hammond organ until it boils over. That cover closes the disc, which is fitting, because I don't know what you'd follow it with. It's a perfect capper for yet another ridiculously great compilation from Numero Group. It's not a perfect disc, mostly because of an embarrassingly inept cover of ""Theme From 'Shaft'"", but it's so full of great, nearly lost music that it's hard to fault the inclusion of a head-scratching curio like that. On the whole, Grand Bahama Goombay offers a peek into a musical world well worth preserving, and I can't wait to see where Cult Cargo goes next.","Numero Group expand its Cult Cargo series-- an outpost of its Eccentric Soul work that focuses on non-U.S. sounds-- with a look at Bahamian music that lightly Caribbean-ized American soul and funk.

Rumpelzirkus,Kalabrese,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08bb1335d7bf169a134/1:1/w_160/27665250.jpg,2007-05-17 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10230-rumpelzirkus/,Stattmusik,"Kalabrese might be minimal house music's first great defector since Matthew Herbert; he's certainly its most inventive upsetter since Isolée went all disco-schizo with We Are Monster. Now forget I mentioned both those names, much less ""minimal house music,"" because Rumpelzirkus, Kalabrese's beguiling debut album, absolutely deserves to be heard on its own terms. The record opens with a platitude wrapped in a cliché, as a Jamaican-accented voice-- certainly not Kalabrese's-- deadpans, ""Where's the future? It's not the past, it's not the present. It's…the future."" You can take your finger off the eject button, though. This isn't some European roots-reggae travesty; that's just Kalabrese's off-kilter sense of humor. Living up to the latter half of its name, Rumpelzirkus carries about it an air of the carnivalesque, or at least the tongue-in-cheek, that verges on the outright bizarre. (What else are we to make of a song like ""Aufm Klo"", that begins with Kalabrese, sounding a bit like Bob Dylan as filtered through a vocoder, singing, ""I got pain in my ass…""?) Beyond that tongue-in-cheek intro, there's actually next to no reggae here, beyond the obvious genetic trace of dub that enlivens all electronic music. There's just as little overt futurism, if by futurism you mean the streamlined forms and steely timbres that have electrified the electronic-music imaginary since Kraftwerk and Cybotron. Rumpelzirkus is a bit of a head-scratcher: Is it a click-house album aimed at listeners who prefer real live instruments or a lush comedown reverie for real live clubkids? Really, it's both of those things and more. Most of the album's cuts ride a bumptious 4/4 beat, which won't be surprising given the album's distribution via Kompakt and Kalabrese's own discography. (Perlon published his best known single, and various of his tracks have appeared on James Holden's At the Controls session, the Four:Twenty label's Circoloco at DC10 Ibiza showcase, and Akufen and Tyrant's respective Fabric mix CDs.) But this is hardly your bog-standard oonce-oonce. Most of Kalabrese's beats are made not with drum machines or soft synths but clattery samples swathed in natural reverb: sticks on rims, pots and pans, creaky bedsprings, drunken handclaps. He's not afraid of a fat analog kick or fizzy, filtered white-noise hi-hats, but the machine aesthetic never dominates-- especially once we move out of the percussive layers. With the exception of a few growling analog synthesizers, electric and acoustic instruments dominate-- low-slung electric bass, kalimbas, glockenspiels, tambourines, horns, and acoustic guitar-- giving rise to the specter of folk-house, or maybe, just maybe, something we might call struminal. But ultimately it's not what Kalabrese puts in his music that's important, but his sophisticated compositional sensibility. At their best, Kalabrese's songs draw simultaneously from dance music and pop songwriting, fusing a rare sort of architectonic strength with a tender, unabashedly sentimental sense of narrative. In keeping with all good dance music, there is no real division between the rhythmic and melodic registers. On ""Deep"", for instance, a lone acoustic guitar figure taps out a gleaming ostinato pattern that the beat warily circles like a side-stepping spider. On ""Heartbreak Hotel"", hand drums, spindly guitar lines, Moogy squeals, and groaning vocal harmonies string together a kind of pointillistic approximation of a country ballad. ""Not the Same Shoes"" starts off almost like a parody of a minimal house track, complete with a baritone voice supplying an eighth-note boom-boom-boom pattern, before blooming into a gravelly duet with the Swiss laptop chanteuse Kate Wax. He-said/she-said verses make a play for radio-readiness as vines of bright analog synthesizer go climbing like morning glory through the track's percussive lattice. (It's a remarkably similar strategy to that used by LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"".) On the very best songs, Kalabrese extends his ambitions beyond the horizontal, proving himself to be a remarkably talented songwriter, full stop. ""Hide"", featuring the rosin-throated Guillermo Sohrya, goes so far as to suggest José González' acoustic mood pieces as fleshed out with Afrobeat-inflected guitar licks, swirling Hammond organs, jittery synthesizer blips and a woozy barroom guitar solo. Cozy as a duvet, its most immediate reference point might be Yo La Tengo's ""Autumn Sweater""-- but better written, better produced, and better suited for tugging heartstrings to the point of unraveling. It's a shame that Valentine's Day is behind us, because ""Hide"" is the lovers' mixtape closer of the year. Rumpelzirkus' greatest asset might just be its sense of surprise, rolling as magically haphazard as a jam band in top form. Just listen to the way ""Oisi Zuekunft"", the album's oddball opener, evolves unexpectedly from a grab-bag of po-faced phrases and sly musical jokes into a slow-burning groove: the last third of the song squeezes the horns into a bellows that stokes the funk and blows away any stray trace of irony. (Just as almost every individual track displays a remarkable sense of development, the whole album is marked by a masterful sense of flow: given that the 11 cuts were initially released on three 12-inch E.P.s, Rumpelzirkus makes for an uncannily cohesive longplayer.) The same trick inflates the closing ""Body Tight"" from its anemic percussive opening into a billowing sentimental singalong. Rumpelzirkus's title, it turns out, has less to do with circuses than with the fairy tale of Rumpelstiltskin (or in German, Rumpelstilzchen): Kalabrese takes straw and spins it into gold.","Minimal house's first great defector since Matthew Herbert, this Stattmusik artist's debut LP carries an air of the carnivalesque, or at least the tongue-in-cheek, that verges on the outright bizarre.

Release the Stars,Rufus Wainwright,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b092c0084474cd0c1c87/1:1/w_160/a6358e8b.jpg,2007-05-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10235-release-the-stars/,Geffen,"After a decade-long career and five albums, Rufus Wainwright's best work is still ahead of him. His heritage implies this; much like his father Loudon and his mother, Kate McGarrigle-- as well as spiritual contemporaries ranging from Randy Newman to Van Morrison-- Wainwright is cut from the cloth of songwriter for whom youth isn't an essential component of creativity. A quick scan through Wainwright's discography reveals he often falters when he self-consciously asserts his age. Whether in occasionally cringeworthy attempts to massage fragments of popular culture into his comi-tragedies (see 2003's ""Vibrate"", on which he crooned ""My phone's on vibrate for you"") or his increasing propensity for folding rock music into his otherwise anachronistic cabaret pop, Wainwright generally works best when he's trying to be outside of his time, not of it. Continuing in the tradition of 2003/04's double-shot of Want One and Want Two, Release the Stars finds Wainwright flitting between opposite poles-- lovestruck and glib, opulent and gimmicky, overblown and undercooked-- with rumpled uncertainty. To be fair, it doesn't take much to locate the source of his wanderings; unlike most new artists, Wainwright came out of the gate with an incredibly assured aesthetic. Both his 1998 self-titled debut and his 2001 follow-up Poses were remarkably developed records-- the former establishing his way with a wending, operatic arrangement; the latter proving his songs nicely amenable to tidy flourishes of 70s AOR. Since then, whether out of boredom, excitement, or desire for the mainstream acceptance he's so frequently pined for, Wainwright's expanded his sound, tempering his natural inclination towards opulence with different song styles and textures, always with mixed results. A theatre buff, Wainwright has always known the value of a good opener, and Release the Stars is no exception. ""Why does it always have to be fire and brimstone?"" he wonders in the explosive curtain-raiser ""Do I Disappoint You"", which itself sounds a bit like five orchestras playing out the second coming. That's followed by first single ""Going to a Town"", which balances simple piano chords against a uncommonly pointed lyric: ""I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down/ I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced/ I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down/ I'm so tired of America."" With all kinds of satisfying variations and twists on the main melody, it's the rare political song that actually hits its mark, and is easily the album's highlight. As is often the case, Wainwright's ballads account for a disproportionate amount of the standout moments. With its gentle turns of phrase and slow string arrangements, ""Nobody's Off the Hook"" recalls what still might be his finest single song, 2001's ""Poses"". Elsewhere, ""Leaving For Paris No. 2"" finds Wainwright at his most lovelorn, wrenching a meandering ballad out of a churning piano motif. As he's always been better about writing about romance than sex, there are some clunkers to contend with as well. None of are more forgettable than the tepid bar-room rock of ""Between My Legs"", in which a small army of lite rock guitar peels soundtrack Wainwright ""shedding a tear"" you know where. Meanwhile, allegedly based on Wainwright's one-night stand with the Killers' Brandon Flowers, ""Tulsa"" opens with a killer jab (""You taste of potato chips in the morning/ Your face has the Marlon Brando club calling"") and descends into self-aware pointlessness. Even worse is ""Slideshow"", a six-minute epic that rests on a ludicrously overwrought refrain: ""And I better be prominently featured in your next slideshow."" Such frequent attempts to elevate the banal into the meaningful ultimately keep Release the Stars from achieving any significant momentum and only add weight to the notion that Wainwright's shaky aim-- rather than his lack of talent-- might be his biggest downfall. Nonetheless, it's hard to take away from what he's already accomplished. At only 33, he's quietly amassed a body of work, the best of which rivals most of his singer/songwriter contemporaries. If we do ever get that masterpiece, it'll be straight icing.","Continuing in the tradition of 2003/04's double-shot of Want One and Want Two, Release the Stars finds this singer-songwriter flitting between opposite poles-- lovestruck and glib, opulent and gimmicky, overblown and undercooked-- with rumpled uncertainty.

Whistleblower,Vladislav Delay,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b072b1335d7bf169a104/1:1/w_160/cdf42665.jpg,2007-05-16 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10209-whistleblower/,Huume,"Is there anybody doing as much with dub these days as Sasu Ripatti? The tricks and tenets of the form have been so integrated into different realms of music production that they're simply part of the weather. Disembodied echoes, horizontal smears, transfigurations of details into plot-points and vice versa-- all such things are base elements that owe to the days when reggae producers started wondering what might be hiding between the wires in their mixing desks. It would be hard to overstate the importance of dub in electronic music, but it's also easy to take for granted. Part of that owes to how literally dub gets invoked by those most closely associated with it: When the likes of Pole or Rhythm & Sound show their devotion to the dub methodology they hold dear, it tends to come out sounding more or less like re-versioned reggae. Drums fan out over bulbous bass-lines, tempos skew slow, melodies grow lazy and warm, and so on. Sasu Ripatti is less literal. Under his working guises as Luomo, Uusitalo, and Vladislav Delay, the Finnish producer has allied with dub as both a method and a mindset. It starts with the interrelation of his three personae, which itself functions as a sort of dub gesture. But it's most evident in the way he trips and rubs each and every element of his sound as it transpires, whether under the schedule of house (cf. Luomo), techno (Uusitalo), or dub that wanders out of line. The last one is what plays on Whistleblower, the eighth album credited to Vladislav Delay. The sounds are the same as they've always been: miasmic synth tones, rubbery kick-drums that stutter and tap, weird whirligigs given to tumbling around what could well be a big washing machine filled with an irradiated syrup of significant thickness. They're basically the same sounds that Ripatti mines as Luomo and Uusitalo, minus any veritable rites of rhythm. As Luomo has grown evermore sensuous and inviting, the common knock against the work of Delay is that it's all a big tease. (Who could resist the desire to hear Luomo when he's so close at hand?) But while the tease does in fact taunt in tracks that rarely build beyond a lumbering yawn, the Luomo aura helps as much as it hurts, mostly by making Delay's dubby hesitations and ambient lack of pacing resonante all the more for the decisions they imply. When a series of pounding sounds wanders into a 12-minute track like “Wanted To (Kill)"", what initially scans as arbitrary carpentry noise falls into a hypnotic pulse, in part because you're listening for it. Likewise the barely-suggested sound of a voice cut up in ""Stop Talking""-- the mere chance that it might turn into a lush chorus in the fashion of Luomo makes it sneak into an ear all the deeper. That's not to say that Whistleblower isn't worthwhile on its own terms. Few producers have as varied a store of sounds to draw on as Ripatti. And he never just plugs them in, which proves all the more evident when he's at his slowest and most patient. It's a wonder to hear how he tweaks and customizes every little fidget in ""I Saw a Polysexual,"" just as it's stirring to hear when he pulls back to haunt in ""Lumi."" You could fashion a Venn diagram to make sense of the effects as they relate to Luomo and Uusitalo, or you could just draw a circle and stay inside.","The Finnish electronic whiz best-known as Luomo revists his dubby ambient guise.

Prezens,David Torn,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b060b1335d7bf169a0e5/1:1/w_160/3383d01a.jpg,2007-05-16 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10192-prezens/,ECM,"Has there ever been a guitar hero with a more misleading moniker than David Torn? With his violent, evocative surname, you expect Torn to really shred, to take that fretboard and rip it to pieces. And he does that, but not the way you might expect. His is a more considered virtuosity, a style that stresses mood and amorphous cloud technique over light-speed pyrotechnics. Torn doesn't rip. He weaves, he pulls, he draws. ""Why would a first-rate guitarist want to sound like a third-rate saxophonist?"" someone once asked, rhetorically, of guitar-synth whiz Alan Holdsworth. While no less adept at transforming his axe into something else, Torn has taken a more tasteful tack. He comes from the Robert Fripp and Michael Brook school of style and discipline, which is why his playing has been enlisted so often as backdrops for film scores and for experimental-minded pop stars like David Sylvian and Bowie. Prezens marks Torn's return to ECM, for whom he recorded his breakthrough Cloud About Mercury, for the first time in over two decades. He's joined on the disc by the capable team of Tim Berne on alto sax, Tom Rainey on drums, and Craig Taborn on keys, who as a trio comprise Berne's Hard Cell but here fill out Torn's ranks as a full-fledged (albeit bass-free) jazz quartet. Not that ""jazz"" really does the music justice. If only it were that simple. Part of the fun of Prezens is dissecting its various components, especially given such a shape-shifting presence as Torn. While there's no confusing Torn with Berne (one of the best skronkers in the business) or Rainey, he and Taborn seem to be sharing duties when it comes to harder-to-place sci-fi effects and general otherworldly sounds, at least until the inevitable fireworks erupt. When they do, several minutes into the first track ""Ak"", the effect is a brief but shining free-for-all, a jazz-blues jam where the players are encouraged to step on each other's toes. Yet nobody trips. They understand how to give one another just enough room to navigate, and when they do overlap, they do so sympathetically, with each instrument supporting the other in sometimes surprising ways. It's Torn and Taborn who provide the bulk of the atmosphere in ""Rest & Unrest"", which brings to mind what the Orb might have sounded like as a jazz outfit. But it's Torn and Berne who start out with the mood-setting in ""Structural Functions of Prezens"", an epic track that sounds almost aimless and wistful until Rainey takes over, his snare cracks and cymbal crashes like the patter of rain on the windowsill during a heavy storm. ""Bulbs"" drifts closer to prog territory, not unlike some of the more recent iterations and side projects of King Crimson, the sound of the 21st century schizoid man taking his meds, mellowing out a little, then suddenly realizing he took the wrong pills before really freaking out. ""Sink"" briefly brings the funk before shifting in and out of phase, making room for a serpentine guitar solo that sets Torn adrift in a sea of electro-acoustic strangeness before bringing it all back to a warped kitchen-sink groove. The epic ""Neck-Deep in the Harrow..."" is another great example of how the players can balance staying busy without cluttering up their music, the compositions shifting and tilting every few minutes. Noir atmosphere. Metallic outbursts. Drowsy space music. Blues dirges. Dubby detours. Electronic deconstruction. Lesser musicians might have gotten lost up their own asses. Torn and his band make all these twists and turns make sense, and tracks like the syncopated album closer ""Transmit Regardless"" give recent Radiohead a run for their money. Track after track, the same questions are raised: What are those low groans that keep bubbling up from the depths? Is that Torn sounding like a flute, or Taborn? (Or, for that matter, Berne?) And who's in charge of the digital distortion? How much is live? How much is looped? How much is composed, how much is improvised, and how much was pieced together after the fact, Teo Macero style? In one sense, you can only answer these questions watching the group's live interplay, in the flesh. On disc, the best you can say is that whatever they're up to and whoever's doing it, it sounds right, so it's best to just go with it. Indeed, Prezens provides ample proof that you needn't be traveling at top speed before everything becomes a blur, and that a blur can often be just as beguiling and beautiful as more sharply defined trips. Just be sure to put on your thinking cap and hold on tight.","The guitarist returns to the ECM label with an album of cyber-jazz improv.

Säkert!,Säkert!,"by: Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski",,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0575e6ef95969321f5c/1:1/w_160/219c8832.jpg,2007-05-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10183-sakert/,Razzia,"I was pretty sure I liked Sweden's Hello Saferide for her lyrics, mostly. Under that name, singer/songwriter Annika Norlin's 2006 U.S. debut, Introducing..., set out a personality that won me over like late-night conversations with a new close friend-- full of warmth, humor, and the kind of gnawing insecurities that tend to interest me more than caricatured angst or weepy bathos. Instead of asking what drew me in about her almost defiantly direct indie pop sound, I found myself wondering how her words managed to make her come across as some kind of Scandinavian kindred spirit, and whether other people would be moved in the same subtle way. So of course, Norlin's latest album is entirely in Swedish. A language barrier hasn't stopped Pitchfork's growing cohort of Swede fanciers from drooling all over groups like Dungen and Vapnet (honorable mench: [ingenting]), just as it didn't stop many of us from digging the Welsh-language outings of Super Furry Animals or Gorky's Zygotic Mynci a decade earlier. Still, I wasn't sure I'd get as excited about a Norlin record without being able to understand her touchingly weird words about AltaVista stalking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and those first nervous steps toward true human intimacy. Needn't have worried. On Norlin's Swedish-language debut as Säkert! (literally, ""Safe!""), she's back with more of her alternately giddy and aching fresh-air pop, shading the AM-friendly side of the 60s through a post-Sarah Records lens to sit alongside the likes of Sambassadeur, Vapnet, or Acid House Kings. Perhaps producer Henrik Oja of ""outlaw mutation boogie"" band the Spacious Mind enlivens Norlin's aesthetic with an outsider's touch, after another fragile popster, Niccokick's Andreas Söderlund, produced Introducing... Still, the Skittles-colored arrangements here are merely whizzbang fancier, not really much different: acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, piano, tambourine, glockenspiel, and touches of programming, Rhodes, or quirkier instrumentation like accordion or clarinet. Odds are Norlin's frank voice and candy-twirling melodies explain more of what I like about her songs than I'd ever expected. First single ""Vi Kommer Att Dö Samtidigt"" (""We're Going to Die at the Same Time, You and I"", according to an English-language cover version) certainly suggests as much, even though I now know its peppiness matches a lyric about friendship that's not nearly as creepy as its title suggests-- or, creepy in a cute way, at least. Norlin's electro-pop duet with Markus Krunegard from Laakso can stand up with countryfolk Club 8, and her pairing with Vapnet's Martin Hanberg, ""Sanningsdan"", is as head-noddingly catchy as tracks like that band's ""Rådhusgatan"". While a clutch of faster songs recall the infectious energy of Hello Saferide's ""My Best Friend"", slower piano waltz ""Ditt Kvarter"" comes closer to the quiet charm of Canadian folk-popper Christine Fellows' ""Paper Anniversary"". Clarinet-driven ""Du Kanske Var På Holmön"" evokes the eerie hangover of Introducing...'s ""Saturday Nights"". Finally, spare closer ""Är Du Fortfarande Arg?"" is reminiscent of the first Norlin song I ever heard, ""The Quiz"", and at last makes me start copying the lyric sheet into online translators-- to little avail. ""If I blush when I sing, that's good,"" Norlin has said of the lyric-writing process behind Säkert! (at least, that's my best translation). That blush was part of what caused her English-language songs to glow, but for now just the sound of Säkert! might be enough.","Hello Saferide aka Annika Norlin returns with a new moniker and a Swedish-language indie pop record.

Time Out Presents: The Other Side Los Angeles,Madlib,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b088c0084474cd0c1c76/1:1/w_160/cf9e5fde.jpg,2007-05-16 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10227-time-out-presents-the-other-side-los-angeles/,Deaf Dumb and Blind,"For more than a century, a motley collection of artists, writers, filmmakers, and musicians have tried to get their collective heads around the nebulous, mercurial city of Los Angeles. Is the City of Angels the sunny fulfillment of the American dream as portrayed by any number of Hollywood films, or is it the through-the-looking-glass-darkly noir of Raymond Chandler and James Cain? Can the key to the decoding the vast intellectual sprawl be found in quasi-scientific sorcery of L. Ron Hubbard and Aleister Crowley, or in the compromised pop art of Edward Ruscha? Of course, L.A. is all of the above-- to paraphrase an old tourist slogan: L.A. is where it all comes together, for better or worse. And for the past decade it's also been the home to a burgeoning underground hip-hop/soul/electro scene. Acts such as Flying Lotus, Nobody, Georgia Anne Muldrow, and Guns 'N' Bombs are carving out a niche that will hopefully some day rival the late-50s, early-60s glory years of West Coast free jazz, when musicians such as Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, and Billy Higgins subverted traditional jazz structure and forever altered that genre's landscape. And whatever success the current scene has can be traced back, in part, to Stones Throw Records and it twin titans of hip-hop, Peanut Butter Wolf and Madlib. So, the prospect of an L.A. edition of Time Out hosted by that pair looks amazing on paper. Personally, I can't imagine a better person to chronicle the chaotic history of L.A. music better than the Beat Konductor, whose own ADD avant garde aesthetic mirrors the city's restless and on-going search for definition. And while no one is going to mistake Peanut Butter Wolf for a Duck Tours guide, the Stones Throw founder and DJ is affable and witty enough to fulfill his task as subterranean guide. Unfortunately, the package is underwhelming. Sure, PBW's DVD works well enough as a hipster tour guide: He hits all the right spots-- night spots the Social Trust, Cinespace, and Greenlight as well as cool fashion/ culture spots such as Barracuda, Blue Chips, and Suro-- and carries it off with an intimacy and wit that personalizes the entire experience. If you're a PBW groupie, or maybe if going to L.A. for the first time, it's probably required viewing. But honestly, we're not in the business of reviewing DVDs, particularly ones of the travel guide variety. Which leaves us with Madlib's mix CD. The tagline on here is that the disk is a reflection of Madlib's L.A., but at least half the artists here aren't even from Los Angeles. Dabrye, Jay Dee, Phat Kat, and Cybertron are all from Detroit; Sun Ra hails from Chicago; and the handful of Lee Perry collaborators (the great Prince Jazzbo, Burning Spear drummer Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace) are from Jamaica. Sure, there are some great tracks here. The quirky, windy Mark Murphy track, ""Sly"", produced by Herbie Hancock, is an odd pleasure, while the Outlaw Blues Band delivers an appealing slice of psychedelic blues with ""Deep Gully"". The sporadic insertion of his own tracks, including the exclusive (and mediocre) ""Infinity"", suggests that perhaps Madlib is attempting to trace his own music genealogy. In fact, many tracks hint at Madlib's reckless disregard of traditional song structure. But if self-illumination is the goal, then the CD fails to really highlight the breadth of Madlib's aesthetic. At best, the disk approximates the dadaist, ramshackle charm of his Blunted in the Bombshelter disk. Both mixes are full of unexplained pans and level tweaks, and stock dialogue makes its way into several songs. But the thing about the Blunted was that at least it had a central point: namely, mixing the Trojan catalog. In the end, the CD is enjoyable yet kinda pointless. It feels as if Madlib spent 30 seconds in between bong packs assembling a playlist. Sure, you could do worse, but Madlib could also do better.","Paired with a Peanut Butter Wolf-hosted travel DVD, this ""reflection of Madlib's L.A."" oddly features a handful of artists from places like Detroit and Jamaica.

Da Drought 3,Lil Wayne,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08a5e6ef95969321fa9/1:1/w_160/863c4a85.jpg,2007-05-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10229-da-drought-3/,Young Money Entertainment,"""Everybody in this fuckin' game got the game fucked up. Work, man, work. I feel you, Nas, the new rappers today, they act like R&B singers. Man, what is you done?! Go into the studio with clips-- ammo: positive subjects, bitches, niggas, fake niggas, club song, ho's that shake their... Who am I shootin' at? I got bullets for days."" -- Lil Wayne rant on YouTube It's no secret: Nowadays, most mainstream rappers aren’t rappers. The majority just throw a few bars together around Christmastime before getting back to their real hustle, whether it be acting, designing clothes, or thinking about how to make Rick Ross the next Biggie Smalls while sitting behind a desk in a sharp suit. So when Lil Wayne calls himself the ""best rapper alive,"" the claim isn't that controversial-- it increasingly seems like he's one of the only rappers alive. And he's pissed (see above). With Hip-Hop Is Dead, Nas tried to resuscitate the culture with a hit-and-miss jumble of grumpy nostalgia and over-the-hill soul-searching; it was a far cry from indie-rap's nagging grandmother pose, but the album didn't hold much hope or promise for the future. With its free-associative, intangible, postmodern pull, Da Drought 3, by contrast, sounds a lot like the future. Released on the internet for free, the 29-track, 100-plus minute, DJ-less behemoth finds Lil Wayne sidestepping the music industry-- and the mixtape industry-- while delivering similes, jokes, and flows by the ton. After last year's stunning Dedication 2 tape with DJ Drama, Da Drought 3 ups the ante in almost every way possible. To use a distinctly Wayne-ian analogy-- that is, part '80s baby trivia, part ridiculous, all true-- the New Orleans native is akin to one-time ""American Gladiators"" champion Wesley ""Two Scoops"" Berry. Like Berry, Wayne goes headlong into an inherently absurd competitive atmosphere (i.e. modern hip-hop) and dominates. He scoots around giants, making the most of his nimble, versatile patter. No longer satisfied with being a southern rap ambassador, Wayne emphasizes his range with a cross-country, cross-generational, cross-genre beat selection here, from the Southern R&B of Ciara's ""Promise"" to the neo-soul of Gnarls Barkley's ""Crazy"" to the moody New York bap of Jay-Z's ""Dead Presidents II."" It's effortlessly encompassing. Then there's the quicksilver flow and morphing subject matter, from the West Coast gangsta-isms of ""I'm Blooded"" to the off-the-wall Cam'ron-esque abstractions of ""Live from 504"" to the MF Doom-style kitchen talk. No assembly required-- everything to everybody. It's fitting, then, for the MC to start the album off rhyming over a snap music smash (""This Is Why I'm Hot"") originally made by a New York rapper (MIMS) trying to pander to a nationwide audience. As if to underline his alien mystique (""I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet""), Wayne goes international on the track, working a Jamaican flow simply because he can. Later, while introducing his revamp of T.I.'s ""Top Back"", Wayne clarifies, ""T.I. is the king-- don’t get that shit twisted/ And me? I am the best rapper alive."" The difference-- divine right vs. tireless politicking-- is spelled out through Wayne's regional-poaching as high-art stumping. Work, man, work. At one point, Wayne poses the question, ""I'm crazy for bein' Wayne or is Wayne just crazy?"" And while that chicken/egg query may be unanswerable, there's no doubt Wayne makes several insane decisions on Da Drought 3-- choices no other rapper would ever consider. Take ""My Daddy"", Wayne's spirited defense of his close relationship with surrogate father Brian ""Baby"" Williams over Danjahandz's untouchable ""We Takin' Over"" beat. Instead of just ignoring the hubbub, Wayne calls attention to it with one of the set's most jaw-dropping tracks. When he says, ""Damn right, I kissed my daddy,"" it's not a confession as much as a chest-pumping pronouncement, i.e. why don't you kiss your daddy? Then, the heartfelt justification: ""Who was there when no one wasn’t? Just my daddy."" Finally, Wayne goes into light-speed, forgoing typical syntax for a trail of breathless keywords: ""Beef, yes, chest, feet, tag, bag, blood, sheets, yikes, yeeks, great, Scott, Storch, can I borrow your yacht?"" And just like that, a winning defense turns into a staggering offense. More zaniness as Wayne gets all MySpace stalker over Ciara's ""Promise"" with a love letter to the Atlanta R&B singer that's at once nebbish, cartoony, hilarious, and sweet. ""I know that this is pretty awkward for me,"" he mumbles, his typical playboy routine neutered by a celebrity crush. Even after countless, detailed blowjob verses and rhymes about slipping women pills to get them into bed, the rapper's crazy-in-love yammering (""Nasty as I wanna be or nasty as you like me to be/ I hope you like me too now you know I like you too"") somehow still comes off as earnest. It's a rare moment when Wayne comes down from his interplanetary star-search and joins every other guy who's fallen for Ciara's ""Promise"" video. ""That chair or stool move was cool,"" he gushes. Yeah, it was. Along with its bounty of blog-worthy one-liners (Wayne can be heard imitating Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac and Bobcat Goldthwait across the record) and its fascinating internal weed/food cycle (which you can read about in Julianne Shepherd's recent column), this latest opus from Lil Wayne is marked with a beguiling sense of infatuation. The rapper is in love with language, left-field references to Gremlins and Harry and the Hendersons, the man who helped raise him, his hometown, Ciara and-- even after more than 10 years of professional experience-- hip-hop itself: ""I just love music, I love to rap, I love what I do,"" he says. That much is clear.","Love him or hate him, the divisive NOLA rapper's latest mixtape-- a sprawling 29-track, 100-plus minute behemoth-- ups the ante of last year's DJ Drama-produced Dedication 2 in every way possible.

Remixes Compiled,Telefon Tel Aviv,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afed13d197565213a385/1:1/w_160/dacac620.jpg,2007-05-15 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10088-remixes-compiled/,Hefty,"New Orleans-born, Chicago-residing duo Telefon Tel Aviv introduced their limpid post-rock blend of digital blips and organic murmurs on 2001's Fahrenheit Fair Enough. In 2004, second album Map of What Is Effortless took them beyond instrumentals, but their songs didn't always live up to their soundscapes. That shouldn't be a problem on Remixes Compiled, which collects seven years of the duo's work remixing other people's songs and serves as a decent introduction to Telefon Tel Aviv's singular brand of glitchy, melodic chillout music. This is a remixer's remix compilation. Telefon Tel Aviv's remixes are all extensions of a common aesthetic, a fact that's particularly remarkable if you grew up with the idea of these comps as schizophrenic cash-ins full of your favorite rock group's DJ-tweaked B-sides. Quick-pan beats, twinkling acoustic guitars, and warm synths put the Telefon Tel Aviv stamp on songs by artists as disparate as Nine Inch Nails (a percussive, previously unreleased mix of The Fragile's ""Even Deeper"") and, one track later, Bebel Gilberto (transporting Gilberto's loneliness contemplation ""All Around"" into the lonelier void of outer space). A remake of Oliver Nelson's ""Stolen Moments"" gives the jazz-blues classic's melody to a Loyola University Chamber Orchestra subtly beset by computerized dentist drills, memorably combining old and new. A sensitive, Rhodes-washed version of Apparat's lap-pop anthem ""Komponent"" also carries the Telefon Tel Aviv signature. Still, Remixes Compiled shows only glints of the heightened intensity that occasionally peeked out from the duo's typically more reserved tones on their last album. An exception is the compilation's concluding remix of ""Knock Me Down"" by Hefty label head John Hughes' Slicker project. Here, the electro-funk original's fatherly mantra-- ""You are my only girl,"" vocalist Khadijah Anwar soothingly proclaims-- juts out from quiet beginnings into a thorny tangle of distortion and dying synths. A previously unreleased take on American Analog Set's ""The Green Green Grass"" also has a big, noisy chorus and a bit of the vitality of Map of What Is Effortless's quirky ""My Week Beats Your Year"". Most times, Remixes Compiled is content merely to maintain the duo's restrained cool, whether amid ringing synths and distant horns in a mix of Hughes' ""Got Me Lost/ Driving in LA"", or human-breath percussion and late-night electric piano on a version of AmmonContact's ""BBQ Plate"". Much as on the albums, the songs don't always live up to the sounds (Nitrada's breathily sung ""Fading Away"" is just one not particularly memorable example).

No One Will Know Where You've Been,The Roadside Graves,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06bc0084474cd0c1c4a/1:1/w_160/96f18a9e.jpg,2007-05-15 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10202-no-one-will-know-where-youve-been/,Kill Buffalo,"Vocalist John Gleason and guitarist Jeremy Benson wrote the Roadside Graves' first song, ""Song for a Dry State"", following a cross-country road trip to Utah. And judging from the New Jersey group's vibrant third album No One Will Know Where You've Been, that's hardly the last time they've drawn inspiration with a little help from Rand McNally. The album showcases the Roadside Graves' affection for the American landscape-- both physical and musical-- and hearkens back to the days when long-distance drivers were at the mercy of whichever classic rock or country station carried the strongest signal, and those lonely instances when a well-timed selection from Creedence, George Jones, or the Band might make your whole evening. After beginning life as a trio, for the bulk of No One Will Know Where You've Been, the Roadside Graves have settled in as a versatile seven-piece outfit. Thanks largely to the band's Jersey roots and Mike DeBlasio's dramatic contributions on piano and organ, this lineup all but guarantees a few unavoidable E-Street echoes. But their sweet-tempered country-rock is far more slippery than it might first appear, buffered as it is by rich Jayhawks vocal harmonies, Benson's quicksilver guitar leads, and frequent detours that can occasionally conjure images of a roadhouse Bad Seeds. These unexpected instrumental flourishes serve well to illuminate the intimate psychic geography that Gleason ambitiously maps out in his lyrics. ""If California didn't end, you'd still be driving around,"" Gleason sings to the wayward characters that populate ""If California Didn't End"", one of several examples in his lyrics where lives and plans are forcibly reconfigured by the facts on the ground. This theme is repeated on the album's best track, the triumphant ""West Coast"", a bittersweet tribute to family and the heart's resilience. ""I've got a heart that won't quit, won't break/ no matter what you do"" the Graves sing together, with a passion and vitality that quashes any hint of melodrama, the irresistible chorus framed perfectly by Benson's sun-drizzled, Jerry Garcia guitar. Elsewhere, the album's shades can take a darker hue, as on the cheerfully macabre ""Women in Black"", which finds the Roadside Graves taking their name rather literally with a car-crash narrative that nearly skirts into ""Teen Angel"" territory. And on the folk-like ballad ""The Black Hills"", Gleason further internalizes the details of the American topography, repeating ""She walks the Black Hills for me"" with a baleful gravity. These gloomier passages are balanced out by the presence of spirited, sawdust-floor country numbers like the rollicking ""Man at Every Port"" or ""Stranger"", whose closing guitar jam should easily gather the My Morning Jacket faithful into the congregation. ""I've drank enough to know that I've drank enough,"" announces Gleason on the world-weary ""Live Slow"", the one track that seemingly comes closest to encapsulating the enduring spirit behind No One Will Know Where You've Been. Performed with an uncommonly deft touch and subtle grace, these songs concern themselves primarily with the pause for breath that comes after reaching their original destinations, and the long, careful glance at the atlas that should come before determining what exactly is supposed to happen next.","Indie-country album showcases the Roadside Graves' affection for the American landscape-- both physical and musical-- and hearkens back to the days when long-distance drivers were at the mercy of whichever classic rock or country station carried the strongest signal.

Private Cinema,Slaraffenland,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b065c0084474cd0c1c3e/1:1/w_160/4ba09668.jpg,2007-05-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10197-private-cinema/,Hometapes,"This Danish quintet's first full-length release on Home Tapes is a full of dark and radiant songs that compete and unite at equal turns. The album opens with the peaceful, anemic bombast of ""Sleep Tight"", its winds and strings chugging through crashes of cymbals and bass. An ominous chorus of voices enforces a marching cadence, but the precision breaks midway for guitars and distant howls reminiscent of Animal Collective's Campfire Songs. Incorporating so many instrument families into one sound is difficult, and Slaraffenland have some trouble with ""Show Me the Way"", which ineffectively plods and floats with punches of saxophone and trombone and flits of guitar and drum. At only two minutes it never quite lures us in, but it's the only track that doesn't. ""The Run Up"" is another softhearted interlude that coaxes the ear with soft harmonies and the powerful foundation of brass in low registers. ""This One Will Kill Us"" starts with a disappointingly rote guitar intro, but gives way to an aquatic dirge of twinkling guitars and a suffocating saxophone. It's an immensely evocative atmosphere, and devolves back to post-punk for the close, creating our slow, drawn out shock that these two sounds can come from the same band. The minor key of ""Roed"", with its squirming hint of synth and elongated guitar static, makes for a darker mood we only hear in brief segments of other songs. But this song is also a conclusive chapter to the death march of ""Sleep Tight"". As an antidote, the following ""Watch Out"" gives us a trombone set to a percussion section-- unusual on this album, where guitars and cymbals often mark the beat. The tinge of post-punk shout-outs in the lyrics (""You better watch out"" is hollered intermittently) make pretty good sense, as all the other instruments are similarly content to wow us with surprise: they skulk creepily, or suddenly arrive and recede. Even this song's gorgeous climax is understated, the brass rolling around in chaotic scales, guitars whining in the reverbed background-- but no instrument too loud, and none abrasive. It's easy to imagine Slaraffenland scoring a film or an installation-- their rendition of the title subject on ""Ghosts"" is spot on, bringing in a mix of soft, textured aural luxury with ominous industrialized beats. Here, in a story-like arrangement, the first mood builds to the highly effected second, instead of sandwiching the noise within the calm as happens frequently in previous songs. The album as a whole is a brave perambulation, drawing on the acidic thunderstorms and gorgeous lullabies of two great Icelandic exports (Björk on ""You Win"" and Sigur Rós for aching closer ""How Far Would You Go""). In music, it's not often that this borderline overindulgence, where structure and uniformity are all but forgotten, works. But here the members of Slaraffenland showcase their virtuoso skills and shared vision, always modestly.","Danish quintet's first U.S. release is an evocative mix of prog, post-punk, and folk.

Fight for Anarchy EP,Ladyhawk,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0805e6ef95969321f9f/1:1/w_160/8681519b.jpg,2007-05-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10222-fight-for-anarchy-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"""Meet me outside the skating rink/ Your mom is a bitch/ I don't care what she thinks/ Of me."" When Ladyhawk frontman Duffy Driediger barreled into ""Teenage Love Song""-- the most endearing 150 seconds on the band's self-titled 2006 debut-- with those words, you could have sworn Southern rock had a new poet laureate, still wet behind the ears and punch-drunk with enthusiasm. The best part of that idea, though, was knowing that Ladyhawk was from Vancouver, British Columbia, a Canadian port city with one of the highest costs of living in the world. The most essential music from the southeastern portion of the United States has long been united by the same sense of exposed nerves and uncloaked emotions, as integral to the songs as the sounds themselves. Neither Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sam Cooke, nor Superchunk hedged bets for subtlety's sake or pursued passivity for passion. On both their sweeping debut and the vinyl-only, six-track follow-up Fight for Anarchy, Ladyhawk (like their Canadian predecessors the Band and Neil Young) haven't either. But Fight for Anarchy offers a different approach toward their same humid feelings. While nine of the 10 tracks on Ladyhawk were straightforward, electric-guitar marches, five of the six tracks here are rooted in piano or acoustic guitar. That's not to say Fight is more docile: In fact, Fight for Anarchy is the most musically aggressive batch of Ladyhawk songs yet, in terms of both musicianship and production. ""Boy You Got Another Thing Coming"" is a downtrodden, bitter fuck-you to the girl that left guitarist Darcy Hancock lonesome, high, and dry. He's backed by wailing cello, ramshackle acoustic guitars, and commiserating harmonies until two minutes in, when he funnels his emotional damage through a minute-long, razor-thin knife of feedback posing as a solo. He's out to damage his heartbreaker's hearing, and, when the track limps to the finish line, his punishment is the only thing left standing. Closer ""You Ran"" sounds like a Carey Mercer nod, the heavy strum of a barely tuned acoustic guitar and Driediger's shouting-down-the-hallway vocals nearly overloading the microphone. The band bleeds at track's end into a great sonic mess, unintelligible moans, smeared guitars and a sole clattering drum bashing against each other. Ladyhawk are still singing about loving women, bearing busted hearts, and running wild, but they didn't take these chances before. The risks work only in clips, though. Fight for Anarchy was recorded in one session between tours, and imperfections remain exposed all over the place, with aberrant beats, notes and tones popping from every song's surface. While the same could be said of Neil Young's Tonight's the Night, those flaws were bolstered by a devastating emotional gravity (a member of Crazy Horse and a roadie had just died of heroin) and some of the best songs Young has written. Here, Ladyhawk just sounds alternately mad, sad, and stoned, and most of Fight for Anarchy runs only like a sketchbook for what could have been. ""Boy"" and the 45-second acoustic interlude ""Amber Jam"" are endearing enough; however, opening quick takes on ""War"" and ""If You Run"" seem like wasted statements warranting a little more preparation. But what Fight for Anarchy lacks in absolute worth it makes up for in potential: Sonically, lyrically, and structurally, Ladyhawk are restless here, proclaiming that they've got more to offer than the ragged, social-renegade rock they wore so well on last year's debut, even if they're still sorting through the kinks of making outsider interests coalesce around Driediger's beer-breath anthems (they are). Interestingly, the two Canadian acts whose raucous Southern nature is reflected in Ladyhawk's raw-nerve tendencies-- the Band and Young-- had the same problem: Robbie Robertson has long said that he felt the need to shelter the Band from his interest in 20th century composition, and Young hit the biggest brick walls of his career when his experimental reach far exceeded his grasp. But Ladyhawk are of a different time and place, when dissonance and abstraction aren't mere avant artifacts or obtuse anathema. Somewhere between Frog Eyes' saturated northern sprees and My Morning Jacket's distended southern rails, Ladyhawk will eventually find their place: Fight for Anarchy doesn't quite put them there, and that's OK. They've proven they have the interest and energy, if you'll just give them time.","This vinyl-only, six-track EP follows the Vancouver band's excellent Southern rock-tinged, self-titled Jagjaguwar debut.

Mirrored,Battles,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08513d197565213a4a3/1:1/w_160/90da4abf.jpg,2007-05-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10225-mirrored/,Warp,"Marc Bolan may be dead, but Battles can rebuild him. They have the technology. On ""Atlas"", the second track on the band's debut album, drummer John Stanier's pistons pump out a steroidal version of Bolan's trademark shuffling stomp-beat. His three bandmates-- Ian Williams, Dave Konopka, and Tyondai Braxton-- constrict their two-note keyboards and one-note guitars until the song coalesces into a stiff, slick, swinging robot rock. It's like a skills-exchange workshop where mechanically minded krautrockers are encouraged to share their knowledge with remedial class glam bands only interested in big beat thrills. And as the almost-club-friendly single, it's the perfect introduction to the rest of Mirrored, easing you into the album's mix of over-the-top whimsy, extreme analogue rhythms that are often as much jazz-fusion as IDM as tech-metal, vocals that would do Roger Troutman proud, and vise-tight, ""live or laptop?"" musicianship connected as much by USB ports and Firewire cables as the improvisatory interplay of four dudes just jamming. In fact, Battles may be the first band to really play with the way that 21st century software can extend and distend the sound of a rock band in real time; Mirrored moves in ways that Battles' first two instrumental EPs--post-rock played with the locked-down seriousness of modern techno--only suggested. Early Battles shows could sound like a metal band performing Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians, and Mirrored spurns solos, favoring a caffeinated maximalism where compositions are built out of 100 microscopic parts. The guitarist/keyboardists string together tracks out of riffs that crisscross with the careful preplanning of a subway system. Each instrument on opening track ""Race In""-- Stanier's military-precise massed snares, the guitars tensely climbing up and down a few notes, what sound like synthetic tubular bells-- is added with the deliberate patience of a Terry Riley composition. The song feels nervously repetitive, like it's suffering from OCD. If you've seen Battles live, you've probably seen the phrase ""ex-members of"" written on the flyer, and so maybe none of this surprises you. Save Stanier, everyone in Battles is a multi-instrumentalist, playing a prog album's worth of guitars, electronics, and/or keyboards. Braxton's put in time splitting the difference between IDM and avant-garde electronics; Konopka played with underrated indie instrumentalists Lynx, Stanier drummed for scholastic-metal pioneers Helmet; Williams finger-tapped for Don Caballero. But while there's certainly more than a shade of math rock's intricacy on Mirrored, tracks like the terse, tambourine-rattling quasi-funk of ""Tonto"" or Stanier's time-signature and tempo fuckery on the crescendo-crazed ""Tij"", the stern stuff is continually undercut by a vibe that's more romper room than po-faced. The ""hook"" on ""Race In"" is a whistle-while-you-work chant that they're probably humming down at Fraggle Rock. The astounding ""Rainbow"" spins into dizzying Rube Goldberg corkscrews of keyboard, xylophone, and giddily speed-attenuated symphonic metal drums. It sounds like the band is trying to recreate the Looney Tunes cartoon where Bugs and Daffy are dueling orchestra conductors, each driving their ensembles to crazier and crazier call-and-response peaks. And what makes Mirrored's merry melodies really stand out isn't the crazy quilt structures or needlepoint precision of the playing. It's the frenzied gibberish of Braxton's pitch-shifted and electronically processed vocals-- a kind of ecstatic robot that's speaking in cartoon tongues. When ""Atlas"" dropped a few months back, those vocals were a squeaky line in the sand for old fans, and across the internet, everyone had the same thought: ""Why are Battles suddenly aping the Animal Collective?"" But Avey Tare and company hardly invented high-pitched sing-song vocals-- just ask David Seville. On ""Leyendecker"", Braxton croons in a falsetto that's been whipped up by technology until it sounds like a neutered D'Angelo. Combined with the music, a low-res quasi-R&B beat as grainy as a glitch track, Braxton's circuitry pushes ""Leyendecker"" into far stranger places than any the Collective has wandered into. Throughout Mirrored he shreds his vocals with the post-human glee of Warp labelmate Jackson and His Computer Band, whether it's the joyful opening burst of voice on ""Ddiamondd"" that spits pitch-bent consonants, or ""Tij"", where Braxton pants and wheezes in a creeped-out asthmatic lower-register. You couldn't even approximate ""Leyendecker"", or any of Mirrored's 11 tracks, with just acoustic guitars and voices. At the same time, listen closely to the intro to ""Atlas"" and you'll hear the pedal on Stanier's kit hitting the kickdrum in the physical world of the studio, pushing air as the hammer connects with the skin. Even when reminiscent of the unfeasible programming of post-drill'n'bass electronica, Battles' spastic drums are being played in real time, with the brute force and metronome-focus of a guy with a background in heavy rock. But its avant-pop hooks and ultrabrite melodies are being dissembled and reassembled by pitiless CPUs in equally real time. It's thrilling and disorienting because the virtuosity of both man and machine means that, unlike earlier rock/techno hybrids hampered by both technically unskilled players and crude technology, Battles sound is indivisible. Battles may not be the world's first bionic rock group, but they've done more to extend the idea of a flesh-and-blood band enhanced by computer technology than anyone since the late, lamented Disco Inferno. Mirrored is a breathtaking aesthetic left-turn that sounds less like rock circa 2007 than rock circa 2097, a world where Marshall stacks and micro-processing go hand in hand.","This foursome's first full-length is a mix of over-the-top whimsy, extreme rhythms, vise-tight musicianship, and a 21st century man-machine interface between live and laptop. And although it may not mark the introduction of the world's first bionic rock group, Battles have done more to extend the idea of a flesh-and-blood band enhanced by computer technology than anyone since the late, lamented Disco Inferno.

Seymore Saves the World,Seymore Saves the World,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b068b1335d7bf169a0f3/1:1/w_160/0acc0cef.jpg,2007-05-14 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10200-seymore-saves-the-world/,"Royalty, Etc.","Geek rock's always been a pseudo-genre that stinks of stylistic hair-splitting and a cock-rock-normative mentality. Okay, so someone like Rivers Cuomo indisputably qualifies as ""nerdy,"" but take a look at rock's ""coolest"" icons--Mick Jagger's high school report card was immaculate, Led Zeppelin obsessed over Tolkien, and countless guitarists from Eddie Van Halen to Slash spent their teenage years hunched over a fretboard memorizing scales and chords. In the cafeteria of rock, the line between the nerds' and cool kids' tables appears infinitely blurrier than real world high school stratification. Then again, none of these artists ever sounded as vulnerable as Minneapolis's Seymore Saves the World, a pop rock trio seemingly doomed to relive their high school tribulations for an eternity. As their name suggests, the band revels in a Peter Parker-like transformation from zero to hero, their superpower being frontman Scott Hefte's brainy lyrics and turn-on-a-dime melodies. Joined by ex-Tapes 'n Tapes bassist Shawn Neary and drummer Shawn McGregor, the band's sound borrows a great deal from similarly wry piano-based 1990s pop artists such as the New Radicals or Fastball. However, no influence more blatantly shows through these twelve songs than Ben Folds. Like Whatever and Ever Amen..., Seymore's self-titled debut engages in a nostalgic, one-sided repartee, conjuring wince-worthy high school themes like sports (""Track Star"", ""Team Player"") and awkward teenage poetry (""Love Song"", ""The Night""). Although at times Hefte resembles the chatty ""Remember that time senior year..."" stereotype, he packs enough interesting melodies to accompany the rants. On ""Red Wing"", Hefte goes ga-ga for some girl named Mary Christmas, though the real story lies in the song's pulsating rhythm, which climaxes at a meaty fuzz-bass bridge. As well executed as these songs are, the album sorely lacks any landmarks to latch onto. The keyboard/bass/drums texture never changes throughout the album, no genre outside of piano pop is ever touched. The final third of the album especially drags, as each song ends on a show-stopping rally cry so desperate to provide closure for an album's worth of salad days nostalgia. The band's ad hoc sound makes sense considering this is, after all, one of Hefte's side bands away from the buffer Minneapolis trio Superdanger. Whereas that band's vocalist Caleb Rick has a slacker howl to complement Hefte's nasally whine, Seymore doesn't enjoy such versatility, and their self-titled album sounds like a stray piece that'd be more engaging connected to the rest of the puzzle.","Side-project of Superdanger's Scott Hefte includes former Tapes 'n Tapes bassist Shawn Neary and focuses on piano-based tunes filled with teenage angst.

Golden Pollen,Savath y Savalas,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06a13d197565213a473/1:1/w_160/41821047.jpg,2007-05-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10201-golden-pollen/,Anti-,"Sometimes I feel for Guillermo Scott Herren. His almost-namesake, Gil Scott-Heron, could get away with nearly anything in his prime, partly because his reputation preceded him, and partly because he had enough inborn charisma and cool to pull off virtually anything-- even to the point of making decent spoken word records. But perspective is everything, and because he's known primarily for his ""glitch-hop"" project Prefuse 73, even Herren's most esoteric works tend to be processed by most listeners as having some relationship to hip-hop. Like an episode of ""Three's Company"", hilarious misunderstandings ensue. To be sure, Herren's new Savath & Savalas album, Golden Pollen, would make a terrible hip-hop record. In fact, it might actually have been the worst Spanish-language hip-hop record of all time, putting it about a notch below Gerardo's Mo' Ritmo-- if it was a hip-hop record at all. Fortunately, it's not: Just as Herren's work as Prefuse 73 fits neatly amid Warp Records' boundary-pushing electronic fare, Savath & Savalas plays to the Anti label's artist-as-personality aesthetic. Golden Pollen shines a brighter spotlight on Herren himself than it does on the equipment he uses to arrange his instruments (a variety of traditional Latin American stringed instruments, percussion, vibes, and synths) into loungey, modernist folk pastiches. Granted, he does pull in help from Tarantula A.D.'s Danny Bensi, Battles' Tyondai Braxton, Triosk drummer Laurence Pike, singer/songwriter Mia Doi Todd (who sings wraithlike harmonies amid the intro's cinematic string flurries), and Ghostface, who takes the lead vocal on slow-burning anthem ""Estrella de Dos Caras"". Wait, did I say Ghostface? Make that José González. But most of the album focuses on Herren himself. His voice, featured more prominently here than ever before, is a nice surprise-- a soft Spanish coo that integrates with floating vibes and skittering flamenco guitars, creating a uniformly placid yet dramatic sonic surface. Some of the songs are just a hair away from traditional: ""Apnea Obstructiva"" and ""Olhas"" betray nothing of their producer's usual post-modern leanings and wouldn't sound out of place on a compilation of modern Latin American folk. Elsewhere, Herren shows his colors, using sturdy traditional compositions as canvases for his deft collages. The clip-clopping percussion and flecked guitar of ""Paisje"" emerge from abstract atmospheric rumbles, while the dense, off-kilter blur of ""Concreto"" seems held together only by Herren's sedate croon. The dark romantic ballad ""El Solitario"" blooms out of a spring-wound electro meltdown, as does the cymbal-crashed tone-droner ""Faltamos Palabras"". These touches, combined with Herren's consistently lively playing, make for a seamless album that should be just inventive enough for his fans, yet comfortable enough to draw in listeners for whom the term ""Ableton plug-in"" has no significance. This seamlessness is at once an asset and a shortcoming. It can be exquisite in short bursts, but drags a bit over the course of this 16-track album, which is too homogenous in its dreamy, mid-tempo mood to justify its length. Despite the consistent allure of its sounds, Golden Pollen becomes tedious; by its final third, the songs sound so familiar you might keep checking to see if it's cycled back to the beginning. There's a very strong EP here, even a good short album, but you know these rap guys-- always gotta make an hour-long album, even when they don't have the material to flesh it out. And even, apparently, when they're not actually rap guys. But no one's forcing anybody to wade through the whole thing at once, and as a series of moments, Golden Pollen stands with 2004's more concise Mañana as further proof that there's more to Herren than looking for the perfect beat.","Prefuse 73's Guillermo Scott Herren sings and plays a variety of traditional Latin American stringed instruments, percussion, vibes, and synths.

There's No Home,Jana Hunter,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05b5e6ef95969321f62/1:1/w_160/2e7f0ccd.jpg,2007-05-14 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10187-theres-no-home/,Gnomonsong,"Many listeners first became aware of Jana Hunter through her appearance on 2004's catalystic folk compilation Golden Apples of the Sun, curated by her friend and sometime collaborator Devendra Banhart. Not out of place for a neo-folk comp, her song ""Farm, CA""-- a dark country-ish tune with haunting strings and lackadaisical acoustic guitar-- didn't fully intimate the depth and diversity of Hunter's songcraft and wise-beyond-her-years croon. Then she hit us with the dusky, dreamy full-length Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom. Similar in feel to Banhart's early lo-fi bedroom album Oh Me Oh My, and to a degree, CocoRosie's early ramshackle naiveté (minus the corn and bloated self-importance), the dimly lit, introspective, and cathartic nature of that excellent debut felt almost hermitic. Appropriately, the record also marked the launch of Gnomonsong, the label started by Banhart and Vetiver's Andy Cabic. For her sophomore release, There's No Home, Hunter stands in the light, brings along a few friends, and seems ready to go emerge from her cave. The album opens with ""Palms"", a meditative invitation (""I open my hands to you/ I've showed you my palms/ I've showed you my soft skin for what it really was"") wherein Hunter's breathy, long-held chorale-like voice reaches out to someone who she senses is nearby, but in fact, is ""already long gone."" Hunter's tone quickly changes with the sassy second track ""Babies"", a tune evocative of Moon Pix-era Cat Power. One of Hunter's poppier numbers, its ""bah bah bah"" backing vocals are accompanied by bouncing drums while strings and guitars spiral around. It's also a great example of what makes Hunter's music so rich: Here, she tills a fertile bed of melancholy, only to yield colorful, joyful flowers. One contributing factor to the album's relative lightness-- like Blank Unstaring, it's pretty blue on the whole-- is the concise and fluid songwriting: Most of these songs are under three minutes. The emotional complexity-- or rather, saddled contradictory feelings-- aren't all that set her apart from her peers: She also draws on influences from outside folk which, largely due to her finger-style treatment and accompaniment choices, wind up adhering to a folk template. For example, the excellent ""Vultures"" pairs a rhythmic, flamenco-like guitar part with syncopated drums, evoking a dusty desert highway. The country- and gospel-tinged ""Bird"", and the experimental ""Pinnacle"", add fusion drum flourishes, angular electric guitar bursts, and feedback drones that wouldn't sound out of place on a Ghost or Six Organs of Admittance record. ""Recess"" is a somber ballad akin to some of the Pretenders' saltier sad songs. And ""Sirens"", stylistically in line with numbers like ""All the Best Wishes"" and ""The Earth Has No Skin"" from her debut, is a ballad with minor-chord arpeggios and the waltz-like time-signature used in all those 60s girl-group breakup songs. Hunter's winding melodies possess a mysterious déjà vu quality, like lost tribal folk hymns, and the captivating sense of mystery inherent in her voice, which is at once both husky and wispy, is enhanced by keeping the subject matter purposefully vague. She often employs the Björk-like lyrical conceit of using ""it"" to refer to some ambiguous source of discontent or exaltation. Once again, take the poetic ""Vultures"" (""I can feel my thoughts a circling like vultures do/ When it comes on/ Comes on so strong"") or the reflective ""Babies"": ""For many reasons I left my home/ Most of the reasons I still don't know."" Which leaves us to guess, finding our own empathic reasons.","Singer/songwriter integrates influences from outside folk and cultivates a strong sense of mystery on her second album for Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong label.

Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0265e6ef95969321f10/1:1/w_160/40bfd490.jpg,2007-05-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10141-joe-strummer-the-future-is-unwritten/,SonyLegacy,"Joe Strummer lived just long enough to see his luster fade. You can't read a Strummer profile nowadays without a snide mention of his privileged upbringing, backhanded accusations of opportunism, or some sneaky assault on his revolutionary man-of-the-people credentials. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Strummer was a secret admirer of Margaret Thatcher, or at least a politically ambivalent populist. If there's anything Joe Strummer made clear right up to his untimely death, it's that he loved life and loved the world, and all it had to offer. He was an idealist who embraced diversity in art with the same arms that embraced diversity of opinion-- the same arms he sometimes raised to defend the things he held sacred and assail the things he found offensive. Strummer fought the good fight not as a rigid dogmatist or a didactic preacher but as an optimist who at his heart hoped for everyone to feel the enthusiasm he radiated on record, on stage, or on the radio. Strummer himself best sums up his appeal in an interview excerpted on The Future Is Unwritten, a soundtrack tribute to Strummer by way of his songs and the songs he liked, timed to a new Julien Temple documentary of the same name. ""Joe, we're going to have your name up on screen,"" goes the TV producer. ""Would you like anything under your name? Would you like 'Mescaleros' or 'The Clash' ...?"" he asks, trailing off. ""I'd like you to write 'Punk Rock Warlord,'"" deadpans Strummer in response, without missing a beat. ""With 'Warlord' being one word."" Joe Strummer didn't care what anyone thought of him-- probably punk's most basic, honest position, though one unlikely to endear him to all. ""I don't care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members,"" quipped Groucho Marx, a man as likely a hero to Strummer as that other Marx. And, as The Future is Unwritten attests, he was a complicated man, if not necessarily conflicted, something this disc points out by way of several jarring juxtapositions. A ragged demo of ""White Riot"", which opens with Strummer's a cappella shouting, rubs up against Rachid Taha's recent cover of ""Rock the Casbah"", only to be followed by two of Strummer's favorite songs: Elvis Presley's ""Crawfish"" and Tim Hardin's ""Black Sheep Boy"". After a soundbite in which Strummer explains the epiphany-like effect of the 1968 cultural revolution and a spin of the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", the disc shifts to his own pre-Clash response to changing musical trends: ""Keys to Your Heart"", an innocent little number performed by his pub-rock band the 101ers. From here the compilation shifts to the Clash era, which any fan of the always-evolving band knows drew from wildly disparate ends of the musical spectrum, and didn't stay stereotypically ""punk"" for very long. To whit, The Future Is Unwritten includes tracks from U-Roy and Ernest Ranglin, Bob Dylan doing ""Corrina, Corrina"", Nina Simone covering the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"", and Eddie Cochran's ""Nervous Breakdown"", all simmering somewhere in the Clash's gumbo. As a full portrait of the band, however, the selection is naturally less rounded than, say, MOJO's ""Radio Clash"" freebie from a few years back. But as a snapshot of Strummer's particular influences-- which in turn rolled into the Clash-- it at least provides a little perspective. For example, the Clash's cover of ""Armagideon Times"" (included here) may not be as iconic as Willie Williams' original, but it's certainly credible, in no small part due to Strummer's enthusiastic delivery. The tragedy of Joe Strummer, of course, is that little of his post-Clash work stood up to his previous high-water marks, and that goes for the various soundtrack, Mescaleros, and Latino Rockabilly War tracks included. For that matter, the unreleased Clash track ""(In The) Pouring Rain"", recorded live in 1984, isn't one of Strummer's best, either, but both it and his subsequent band work shows even average Strummer material to be of value. Is The Future is Unwritten essential listening? No. Is it educational? A little. Is it entertaining? Definitely. Four and half years after his death, the world's changed a lot, but Strummer's rightful place in it remains the same. ""Without people, you're nothing,"" declares Strummer in one final clip. ""People can change anything."" Well, we can't bring Strummer back. But with discs like The Future Is Unwritten we can at least pretend he's still here.","The soundtrack to Julien Temple's well-received Joe Strummer documentary serves as a portrait of the legendary Clash singer's life and mind.

Sky Blue Sky,Wilco,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07cea9e61561daa6623/1:1/w_160/19b31145.jpg,2007-05-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/,Nonesuch,"Jeff Tweedy's restlessness has always been one of his greatest strengths. Since Wilco's inception more than a decade ago, his willingness to explore an ever-widening spectrum of sounds and genres, and to keep the revolving door of the band's line-up well-oiled, has paid off in a discography that's as diverse as it is indispensable. Though his songwriting DNA was bound tight during the later days of Uncle Tupelo, Tweedy has nurtured it in different ways with each successive album, from the transitional sunset country-rock of the first two, through the keyboard-thick pop of Summerteeth, the fractured deconstructions of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and the languid abstractions of A Ghost Is Born. Following that last record, Wilco swelled to its largest and (according to Tweedy himself) best lineup ever, with the addition of guitar hero Nels Cline and utilityman Pat Sansone. Charged up and bursting with eccentric and experimental talent, Wilco Mk. 5 seemed poised to generate the band's finest-- or at least most interesting-- music yet. Instead, it produced Sky Blue Sky. An album of unapologetic straightforwardness, Sky Blue Sky nakedly exposes the dad-rock gene Wilco has always carried but courageously attempted to disguise. Never has the band sounded more passive, from the direct and domestic nature of Tweedy's lyrics, to the soft-rock-plus-solos format (already hinted at on Ghost's ""At Least That's What You Said"" and ""Hell Is Chrome"") that most of its songs adhere to. The lackluster spirit even pervades the song titles: ""Shake It Off"" is probably most accurate (not to mention the album's worst track), but ""On and On and On"" and ""Please Be Patient With Me"" are both strong alternatives. It's hard to contest Tweedy's headspace in the making of Sky Blue Sky-- the record's themes of exhaustion and hesitantly returning to normalcy are particularly resonant in the wake of his recent rehabilitation. Perhaps it's just a shame that the music fits the message so well; just as the chaos and space of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot fit with that record's message of communication breakdown, Sky Blue Sky's soothing classic rock elements feel like a desperate pursuit of comfort. Even the noisy guitar interludes (often led by Tweedy rather than Cline) play a dramatic role, absorbing the frustrations Tweedy must have accumulated during all the difficult moments documented in the record's lyrics. Among Sky Blue Sky's most distressing attributes is its misuse of the experimentalist weapons at Tweedy's command: drummer Glenn Kotche is given no room to stretch beyond routine time-keeping, and Cline is used for his capacity to rip and wail rather than his ear for texture and atmosphere. Case in point, the drowsy opener ""Either Way"" sleepwalks through a list of indecisive sentiments (""maybe you love me, maybe you don't"") before breaking for a Cline solo that's straight-up Weather Channel Local on the 8s. Elsewhere the sextet lineup tends to overplay what should be a collection of fragile, lonesome material. Multiple songs (""Impossible Germany"", ""Walken"") end up in multi-guitar Skynyrd jam sessions or White Album aspirations (""Hate It Here"") that sound more homage than heartfelt. Meanwhile, quiet moments such as ""Leave Me (Like You Found Me)"" are marred from being delicate Being There throwbacks by excessive noodling and Tweedy's passive-aggressive self-pity. On the other hand, ""Side With the Seeds"" is the rare track where the new band demonstrates its chops without getting in the way of the song. With a soulful vocal, intertwined piano and organ, and guitar conversations that build to melodic peaks over a loosely swinging Kotche drumbeat, it's way jambandy, but epic and triumphant nonetheless. And speaking of the granola crowd, the acoustic simplicity and warm harmonies of ""What Light"" make it the American Beauty nod that Wilco's always been itching to play, even if the song title calls for an exclamation point (or at least a question mark) and is sung with an indifferent period. For a band who can credit a hefty part of their charm to always thinking they're weirder than they actually are, stripping away the disconnect between Wilco's earthy adult-alternative center and their more recent ambitious aspirations-- whether they're exploring Krautrock, breaking into a Sonic Youth freakout, or sabotaging a song's structure-- reveals a fairly traditional band that's emerged from their ""weird"" phase a markedly less interesting group than they were before they entered it. Perhaps after giving the band-member carousel another spin, Tweedy merely ended up with the wrong personnel to articulate his mood here. If that's the case-- as long as his restless habits hold-- we may only need to wait one more album for message and messenger to click back into alignment.","Despite the experimental pedigree of their new lineup, Wilco's sixth album finds them receding into the comfort zone. The result is an album that exposes the dad-rock gene the band has always carried but attempted to disguise-- the stylistic equivalent of a wardrobe change into sweatpants and a tank top.

Yes Yes to You,The Affair,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0675e6ef95969321f73/1:1/w_160/f0f4a88e.jpg,2007-05-11 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10199-yes-yes-to-you/,Absolutely Kosher,"Kali Holloway, lead singer and lyricist for the Affair, has the kind of voice that sounds like it emanates from her entire body. Somewhat low and earthy, it's reminiscent of Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las but with a punk edge, and I bet she'd do a mean karaoke version of Pat Benatar's ""Love Is a Battlefield"". Holloway would probably sound like she was wailing even if she whispered into the microphone, though there's no way of know that from listening to Yes Yes to You. On the 13 songs on the band's debut full-length, life is apparently always intense enough to warrant a full wail. Which is funny, considering how simple and innocent some of these little stories are. The Affair continually draw inspiration from the early 1960s, but not so much in sound as in subject matter. Take ""Andy"", a knockout girl-group rewrite that finds Holloway adding a tinge of longing to her bellow as she outlines a scene that sounds jacked from an early episode of ""Happy Days"": ""Andy, Andy, Andy, the first date was heavenly/ In the movies on the balcony/ When they dropped the lights"". You just know Andy has freckles. Holloway's post-movie designs are equally pure: ""I want to make out like bandits with you."" The possibility of heavy petting, apparently, will be taken up at a later date, maybe after the archetypal ""1-2 (pause), 1"" drum finishes beating. If the lyrics to ""Andy"" seem inspired by third-generation memories of the Kennedy years, the music updates the sound at least to the 70s. Neel Arant plays organ like she's auditioning for the Attractions while the guitars retain a pleasantly thick crunch, the sort of garage tone that's been such a constant in rock and roll it's hard to peg it to an era. Nothing else here is as catchy-- nothing to be ashamed of, really, few songs anywhere are-- but another half-dozen tracks acquit themselves nicely. Opener ""Unwanted Company"" has a dull, almost half-spoken melody on the verses that nicely deflates expectations for the massive chorus hook. ""Honey"" is another charming ode to the values of another era (""You want to take it slow/ Let's go/ Take it back from 10 to zero"") and the song's bubbling organ base is the prefect soapbox for Holloway to stand and project from. Lyrically, at least, they border on twee, but it's interesting to hear such naïve sentiments coming from a singer who sounds so worldly and strong. Yes, the record flags in its final quarter, but that's not such a big deal. The Affair seem more like a few-tracks-at-a-time kind of outfit anyway, the type of band that'll find its way into mixes on the strength of their occasionally brilliant hooks and clear, consistent viewpoint.","Led by powerhouse vocalist Kari Holloway, this Absolutely Kosher band finds lyrical inspiration in the early 1960s and musical roots in the power pop of the 1970s.

We Walked in Song,The Innocence Mission,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06eea9e61561daa6608/1:1/w_160/3245a643.jpg,2007-05-11 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10205-we-walked-in-song/,Badman,"Over the course of two decades, the Innocence Mission's name has come to feel less like the mere moniker of another earnest late-80s college-rock act and more like an evangelical pursuit for simplicity and propriety, the result of which has been increasingly tranquil records that are practically defiant in their quietude. But it speaks volumes about their direct, affecting songcraft that principals Karen and hubby Don Peris can boast of a past collaborating with Natalie Merchant, soundtracking ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Party of Five"" episodes, and writing songs for Amy Grant's Christian catalog, and yet, 18 years after their band's formation, find themselves right at home releasing a string of quality records for an indie label that counts My Morning Jacket and Mark Kozelek as alumnus. Even by the Innocence Mission's modest standards, We Walked in Song is especially spare in presentation-- we don't hear drums till the final chorus of the fourth track-- but draw from a deep tradition of solitary music: from Appalachian folk and gospel hymns to breezy bossa nova and the third Velvet Underground album. The myriad of regional and historical influences are appropriate analogs for a record that's often consumed by thoughts of travel-- not from a romanticized, escapist point of view, but from the perspective of those left behind. Beyond giving Karen's peculiar Joni/Newsom coo all the room it needs to soar and sigh, the stark arrangements-- built around Don's dew-drop guitar lines-- make the introduction of each new detail seem all the more purposeful, like the way the Hammond organ gives the third verse of ""Brotherhood of Man"" an extra nudge toward the finish line, or how the subliminal string arrangements and piano chords lurking in the shadows of ""Love That Boy"" seem to push Karen's object of affection further out of her reach. When the drums finally appear for the finale of ""Into Brooklyn, Early in the Morning"", in this album's calming context, the effect is as almost momentous as the opening kick-drum crash of ""Be My Baby"". But this careful craftsmanship would feel overly precious if these songs didn't possess a pleasing, lived-in familiarity that makes you think you've already internalized them through of a lifetime of AM oldies-radio osmosis. In their less captivating moments-- which emerge in the album's third quarter-- the Innocence Mission can succumb to a certain folk-circle innocuousness (""A Wave Is Rolling""), but even these more typical turns are adorned with intriguing touches-- like the orchestro-flamenco flourishes on ""Over the Moon""-- that enhance We Walked in Song's air of muted majesty. ""You'll never lose that light,"" Karen sings on ""Song for Tom"", though it could easily be a song for them: a testament to the durable, slow-burn beauty of their work, and their softness of touch-- a light that rarely feels lite.","Veteran college rock band's latest is, even by its standards, especially spare in presentation, drawing on a tradition that includes Appalachian folk and gospel hymns to breezy bossa nova and the third Velvet Underground album.

The Mary Onettes,The Mary Onettes,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b064b1335d7bf169a0ed/1:1/w_160/f3699277.jpg,2007-05-11 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10196-the-mary-onettes/,Labrador,"The Mary Onettes, a guitars-and-keyboards band from Sweden, don't make any excuses about sounding awfully 80s, and their indie-romantic touchstones aren't so different from any other new-wavers': This debut album includes broad, obvious borrows from both New Order and the Cure, and fainter echoes of plenty of other stars from that constellation. The main difference is the side of this stuff that they're interested in borrowing. These days, lots of acts look back on New Order as the serious-minded dance-music pioneers who made ""Blue Monday""; the Mary Onettes sound more intrigued by the swoony, chart-topping pop of a song like ""Regret"". Lots of acts draw on the Cure for their spikiness, their spookiness, their goth; the Mary Onettes would rather compete with ""Just Like Heaven."" When they reach the height of unembarrassed pop on this record-- on a song called ""Under the Guillotine"", which their singer pronounces, lovably, ""gilly-o-teen""-- it's not hard to imagine them being shoved unnoticed into a glossy 80s-station lunchtime playlist, somewhere around ""I Melt With You"" and ""Take On Me"" and ""Under the Milky Way"". And so here's the slick, earnest, romantic, spiffy-haired pop music that most of today's new-wavers try their best to harden up and steer clear of, generalized and blurred out to the point where it feels more like just big dreamy radio anthems than an imitation of anything-- we endeavor not to stereotype, but how Swedish is that? Like all experiments in the field of ""perfect pop,"" it has its pros and cons. The good news is that bright, breezy, joyful retro always beats the kind of retro that pretends it's still fierce and original, and the generalist pastiche of the Mary Onettes' big singles feels generous, charming, and not at all ripped off. ""Lost"" might start out a bit New Order, but it quickly blows up into grand teen-movie hooks that only a grump could find much fault with: They actually capture that ideal mid-80s quality of sounding like they're posing happily in slow motion, one of the music video's many gifts to the vocabulary of actual music. This is their main strength, really-- on songs like ""Lost"" and ""Void"", the Golden Age they're conjuring comes back through their melodies and song structures, not just the superficial business of synth settings and production styles. (Melodies rarely feel like they're copying anyone in particular; an era, a genre, but rarely anyone in particular.) They're good enough at this that even when their retro styles are amusingly blatant-- the glacial synth-bath of ""The Laughter"" is just a recreation of Cure songs like ""The Funeral Party"", and ""Slow"" nips happily from all of New Order's shiniest hits-- it doesn't seem to matter: It's the hooks you're listening for, not the style, and these guys' hooks are practically out there wrestling with Tears for Fears. The bad news is that it does matter, something that comes clearer when the band isn't so much reminding you of another era. You're listening for dreamy hooks, not style, sure-- but once they drop that borrowed style, it turns out they don't have a whole lot of their own. We have a word for good, earnest, romantic hook-writers lacking in style, and that word turns out to be ""corny"". Tracks like ""Pleasure Songs"" and ""Henry"" feel like their swoon potential is buried in a sea of middling pop-band moves (and tame, muted production that sands off what few rough edges liven up their stage show)-- an even bigger shame when, as on the chorus of the former, the melody really does seem worthy of some starry-eyed daydreaming. Style is a hard thing to come by, and these guys may not ever come around to much of their own. But if they can turn out a few more singles like ""Lost"" to slot onto mixes and obsess over for a few weeks, well, that'll be plenty appreciated on its own.","Guitars-and-keyboards band from Sweden recall the synth-pop 1980s and other dreamy, indie-romantic touchstones.

Human the Death Dance,Sage Francis,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05ac0084474cd0c1c24/1:1/w_160/1e24556d.jpg,2007-05-11 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10186-human-the-death-dance/,Epitaph,"With 2005's A Healthy Distrust, Sage Francis ditched introspection, the meat and potatoes of his earlier work, for fire-breathing activism. And who could blame him? A president he didn't vote for had just won another four years-- missteps into lecturing could be forgiven. The old Francis, the quirky, quipping storyteller, triumphantly returns on Human the Death Dance, his second record on Epitaph, to his unique blend of diaristic, down-to-earth meditations, eerie soundscapes, and loopy abstraction. Not that an herbivorous slam poet from Rhode Island, to put it frankly, would be expected to drop politics altogether. The personal is especially political on ""Underground for Dummies"", a biting, but never bitter, record of Francis's long tango with the music industry. And he's losing patience with the close-mindedness within his own art form: ""This is hip-hop for the people/ Stop callin' it emo!"" Francis sees nonsense everywhere. On ""Midgets and Giants"", he lampoons subcultural bullshit across the board, from the doe-eyed disciples of 8 Mile (""a promotional tool, shithead/But not for you, shithead"") to the sexed-up and curiously alive Suicide Girls. And the mission to broaden hip-hop's palette (and palate) presses on behind the curtain, where usual suspects-- Sixtoo, Alias, Reanimator-- switch off with other outer-rim stars. cLOUDEAD's Odd Nosdam blends ghostly atmospherics and Golden Age breakbeats on the opener, while composer Mark Isham lends a swank, silver-screen drama to ""Good Fashion"". Isham's tender union of piano, harp, and strings nearly steals the show on ""Water Line"", a spoken-word diatribe on not doing your job, and not just in New Orleans. ""Got Up This Morning"" sways to Buck 65's high-tech confederacy of fiddles and harmonica, before Francis' female companion poses that timeless question: What would Bukowski do? Pendulums may swing and paradigms might shift, but you can always count on underground hip-hop for those endearingly nerdy, English-major moments. If you decode Jolie Holland's dreamy sighs on ""Black Out on White Night"", rumor has it you'll hear Dante. As you circle deeper into the record, whispers of the old confessionalism get louder and louder. ""Going Back to Rehab"" weaves allusions to the greats, Nas and Biggie, into a six-minute tapestry that encompasses everything great about Sage Francis's strongest album to date: Its neon rainbow of tones and moods, the almost telepathic harmony between producer and rapper, the riveting fault-line tiptoe between memoir and manifesto.","After the fire-breathing 2005 album A Healthy Distrust, the MC's first for Epitaph, the old Sage Francis-- the quirky, quipping storyteller-- triumphantly returns.

Spiderman of the Rings,Dan Deacon,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b070ea9e61561daa660b/1:1/w_160/0e3558b4.jpg,2007-05-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10207-spiderman-of-the-rings/,Carpark,"I first saw Dan Deacon play live in August 2005, just after I moved to Baltimore. The occasion was a ""bridging-the-gap"" measure at a local loft space to foster unity between the city's art-damaged noise kids and its breakbeat-loving club kids. By the time I arrived, a balding, baby-fattened fellow with a patchy Brillo frizz of beard was unraveling a mess of electronics on a table in the middle of the dancefloor. And once all the plugs were plugged and the jacks were jacked, this man, Dan Deacon, turned himself on. What came out of the PA was a barrage of cheap-sounding, rainbow-hued, breakcore-tempo electronic noise. It felt like I was hearing my entire childhood record collection of cheerful kiddie 45s sped up on a hotrodded Fisher Price record player. Deacon himself was dancing along with a joyous palsy, singing through a scrim of squeaky effects. In a night where I'd shown up wanting dance music, Deacon had completely upended my expectations. He also made me a fan for life. A small handful of the grouches stood with incredulous arms folded across their chests and everyone else proceeded to freak the fuck out, almost as wildly as Deacon himself. Welcome to Baltimore. ""Wooody Wooodpecker"", the opening track from Deacon's Carpark Records debut Spiderman of the Rings, combines everything awesome-- and potentially alienating-- about Deacon's music into 3:50 and sticks it right at the beginning of the record. Here, he loops and distorts the famous cartoon character's convulsive laugh over a sizzling synthesizer crescendo, a needling 12-note keyboard melody, and mechanical percussion that winds to a point where a human drummer's tendons would snap. It's like Deacon's switch got stuck somewhere between ""irritate"" and ""captivate"" and he decided to never bother fixing it. Despite its cacophonous electronic surface, the best of Spiderman of the Rings hits the pleasure centers with a string of great pop singles. ""The Crystal Cat"" could almost be a straight-up surf-rock tune until the moment when Deacon's leader-of-the-pack goon croon becomes a grotesquely twisted helium shriek and the drums explode like illegal fireworks. ""Okie Dokie"" is basically ""Wooly Bully"" rewritten with Deacon's handmade tone generators and ring modulators. See, Deacon makes ""noise rock"" that taps directly into the great lineage of batshit bubblegum pop. Spideman connects at various points with Kasenetz and Katz, Sam the Sham, happy hardcore and gabba techno, ""Surfin' Bird"", the twinkly melodies of an infant's mobile (the unexpectedly gorgeous ""Big Milk""), the Ramones, Koji Kondo (composer-in-residence for the Nintendo Entertainment System), Max Martin, and Daft Punk. On an earlier EP, 2006's Acorn Master, Deacon covered Bobby Darin's ""Splish Splash"". That spastic take on a rock'n'roll classic feels with hindsight like an obvious run up to Spiderman. But there's at least one song on Spiderman that betrays his deep background in more cerebral electronic and avant-garde music. Deacon is a core member of Baltimore's Wham City crew-- a Baltimore loft/show space and arts collective-- and the 12-minute ""Wham City"" is this album's centerpiece. In this tribute to his friends and his former home, you can hear hints of all sorts of hypnotic beats, from Neu!'s motorik percussion and Kraftwerk's synthesizers to Steve Reich's mallets and Terry Riley's keyboards. But as a sing-along-- or chant-along in this case, one of the catchiest of the year-- it also hints at a deep love of old ""Sesame Street"" records and a full collection of ""Muppet Show"" DVDs. Even when Deacon goes epic-- and pays tribute to the hardcore experimental composers he studied in college-- he can't resist the urge to play up to your inner child. Like all the kid-friendly stuff that informs his sound-- pop bands, candy ravers, Carl Stalling, noise bands in stupid masks, rap music reduced to a bunch of catchy catch-phrases, and jumping on your bed with friends-- Deacon doesn't care about looking cool. (Rock magazine stylists will never get within 100 feet of the guy.) And if you're down with the cause (Wham City fliers flatly stated ""no jerks""), Deacon wants you to join him in adding silly joy to a world that's been feeling pretty drab. This fearlessness in the name of trying to make people happy spills onto Spiderman of the Rings like neon poster paint. The album deserves to make song-and-dance man Deacon a superstar, or at least as much of a superstar as the Dean Martin of self-soldered electronics can be.","Tapping directly into the great lineage of batshit bubblegum pop, Baltimore art kid Dan Deacon's Spiderman of the Rings is one of this year's happiest, catchiest, and weirdest records, repeatedly hitting pleasure centers with track after track of gleeful, electronics-infused hyperpop and candy-coated sound experiments.

When Mother Hips began their indefinite break after crowning their career with 2001's excellent The Green Hills of Earth LP, it seemed logical that they might be hanging it up for good. They'd just dropped their best record, and the idea of going out on top has at least some appeal to most people. Well, it turns out they weren't done after all, and on the evidence of Kiss the Crystal Flake, it's a welcome return. This, their sixth LP, follows on the heels of last year's promising Red Tandy EP and doesn't skip a beat getting back to the band's rootsy mix of 70s rock and power pop. Songwriters Tim Bluhm and Greg Loiacono split the duties slightly in favor of Bluhm, which means the album as a whole is tilted just a bit more toward the power pop side. The sound is about as bread-and-butter rock'n'roll as you can get, mostly limited to the four band members with the occasional keyboard embellishment or trumpet. Both songwriters sound recharged, and the band, with new bass player Paul Hoaglin, seems glad to be back at it, taking time to jam a bit and let the guitars loose on a few songs, but always bringing it back to tight, melodic songcraft before things get out of hand. If anything, it reminds me of the direction Sloan has gone-- using their muscle to reinforce their popcraft and not as an end in itself. Loiacono's slowly churning, Tom Petty-influenced ""Confirmation of Love"" is a good example, using the hard downward strumming of the chorus as a mere table-setting for the really big hook, one powerfully delivered ""she went down to California,"" that plays off all the charged meaning the name of that state has acquired in the American subconscious. Bluhm chips in a couple of quality slow songs himself. ""Let Somebody"" makes great use of the blend of Bluhm's smooth voice and Loiacono's rougher tone on the chorus harmonies, while ""Not So Independent"" fakes you out with a stomping guitar intro before settling back into a recollection of a fireworks display at a beach party. On the higher tempo tip, ""Time We Had"" is one of the best pop songs in the band's catalog, with great doubled vocals from Bluhm and a brief guitar solo that sneaks in a new hook at the end. Loiacono's ""No-Name Darrell"" is stuffed with Beatles chord progressions and accomplished falsetto vocals, but shies away from a typical song structure, instead moving through multiple ideas as they arise. I can't imagine anyone who followed Mother Hips in their initial run being unhappy with this, and people who came on board at the end for Green Hills will find the same forces that made that record so broadly appealing at work here. Kiss the Crystal Flake is the sound of a refreshed band making as solid an album as they ever have.","California power pop band returns from indefinite hiatus to record its first album since 2001's excellent The Green Hills of Earth.

Above the Trees,Paul Duncan,by: Stephen M.

His low, wounded voice barely registers the swells and fades of the music or the unsettled worry of his lyrics, simply drifting away as his songs veer off in unexpected directions. Like Will Oldham, he undersings to remarkable effect, yet never sounds detached or uncommitted. Instead he simply mingles with the instruments, often allowing the music to eclipse his own performance. That in itself is no mean feat: Duncan's previous albums, 2003's To an Ambient Hollywood and 2005's Be Careful What You Call Home, were subdued and quiet to the point of being minimalist. However, the austere surface could barely conceal the painstakingly textured blend of organic elements (acoustic guitars, reticent rhythm section) with synthetic (spacey squiggles, canned beats), creating a space where Duncan's voice was merely one sound among many. With Above the Trees, his third album, Duncan at last features more prominently in the production, seemingly overtaking his accompaniment or at least drawing even with it. Again, this is no meager accomplishment, as the album sounds louder and fuller, boasting a full-band sound and a collaborative dynamic, as if Duncan and his backing musicians worked the songs out on stages across America, fine-tuning each verse and crescendo in front of responsive audiences. Strings mimic his vocal line on opener ""Red Eagle"", subtly reinforcing the chorus melody and focusing the spotlight directly on the guy whose name is on the album cover. ""The Fire"" and ""The Lake Pt. 2"" lope along at a deceptively gentle midtempo, while ""High in the Morning"" and ""Country Witch"" achieve an electric country-rock momentum similar to Magnolia Electric Co. Only ""Parasail"" falls flat: the rhythmically churning guitars sound brutish and obvious in this context, although perhaps the song translates better live. Duncan doesn't jettison all of the loops and beats of Be Careful, but submerges them in the mix, where they can compliment, rather than compete with his band [who are credited with playing computer, modular synth, (d)rumble, shirts, and piano innards]. The approach creates a sense of depth in the production and a parallax relationship between the instruments, as if their roles and relationships are constantly changing. As Above the Trees progresses, Duncan and his band indulge these spacier elements, occasionally to the detriment of the song (as on the noisy ending of ""Parasail"") but mostly to the benefit of the album's tone. As always, atmosphere remains crucial, but the difference is that the guitars, horns, strings, drums, and especially Ken Champion's otherworldly pedal steel create the nighttime ambience rather than CGI. In doing so, they not only push Duncan to the forefront, but tether him to the earth.","On his third album, this singer/songwriter-- who, like Will Oldham, often undersings to remarkable effect-- finally features more prominently in his austere songs.

Dirty South Dance,A-Trak,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b066c0084474cd0c1c42/1:1/w_160/f2b81a2d.jpg,2007-05-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10198-dirty-south-dance/,Obey,"At their worst, mash-ups can come across as patronizing in-jokes, elbowing your sternum at how totally way-out crazy it is that two pieces of music from disparate genres can actually coexist in the same space. The lazier bootleg artists stick to a predictable formula: Look for the most incongruous styles you can beatmatch, give the resulting track a cringeworthy portmanteau of a title (""Smells Like [insert Britney Spears reference here]""), and jam that culture for all it's worth. Maybe that's why mash-ups fell out of favor after their Boom Selection-fueled circa-2002 heyday: The idea worked a lot better when it wasn't the three-minute, 192 kbps version of a rimshot. There's reason enough to assume that Dirty South Dance is a similarly ironic venture: regardless of how seriously you take boutique propagandist Shepard ""Obey"" Fairey, his ""Easter Bunny bling"" cover design screams forced whimsy, and the mix's idea to combine last year's crunk and comparatively obscure electro-house theoretically smacks of hipster goonery. (If the name ""Tha Pumpsta"" hasn't yet dislodged itself from your memory banks and forced some bile into your throat, I'll give you a minute.) The (stereo)typical audience for this type of thing tends to skew towards the superficially trendy, and the first minutes of the mix-- Lil Jon yelling over gleeful, chirpy Euro-scuzz electro-- might elicit either baffled amusement or embarrassed revulsion, depending on how tired you are of club kids screwing around with crunk. But if A-Trak is prone to a certain level of aesthetic smartassery, he's no charlatan. In the decade since he won the 1997 DMC World DJ Championship at a prodigious 15 years of age, he's turned the art of turntablism back toward its original party-rocking focus-- the dude can scratch and beat-juggle, but he's just as skilled at maintaining momentum and crafting seamless segues. And while listeners might look at Dirty South Dance on paper and formulate some sort of genre hierarchy-driven classism in its blueprint, the mix works simply because it largely pretends that line doesn't exist. (And considering how Tag Team's ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"" turned Kano's 1980 Italo-disco track ""I'm Ready"" into one of the first nationally massive Southern bounce hits, it's not that much of a stretch.) Most of the blends are effective to the point of essentially supplanting the original tenor of the instrumental portions, and while A-Trak tends to tweak the rap a cappellas in order to better fit the rhythms, the best ones still feel like dance on the Dirty South's terms. The cartoon ghettotech Peanut Butter Wolf mix of Baron Zen's ""Turn Around""-- one of the more stilted moments on Stones Throw's Chrome Children comp-- sounds a lot more natural with Da Backwudz' unruly ""I Don't Like the Look of It (Oompa)"" laid over it. And Rick Ross' ""Hustlin'"" is fused to Simian Mobile Disco's ""Hustler""-- a matchup obvious enough that Cadence Weapon attempted it sometime last year, though A-Trak's take (titled, yeah, ""Hustlin' Hustler"") does more to trim the empty spaces from Ross' vocal and heightens the velocity of the SMD original. The result is that each beat of its amped-up electro rhythm turns into a foil for Ross' deceptively-calm voice to ricochet off. But while most of the cuts tend to lean a bit more heavily towards the rhythms of the indie-dance set and modify the vocals accordingly, they hardly detract from the MCs' original qualities. Yung Joc's ""It's Goin' Down""'s is stretched out over the throbbing raver punk of Soulwax ""E-Talking (Nite Version)"", his cadence drawn out to a relaxed drawl that makes his declaration ""err'body loves me/ I'm so fly"" sound twice as smooth as the original. Rich Boy's ""Throw Some D's"" is turned into a halting but forceful hip-house vocal to match Para One's remix of Daft Punk's ""Prime Time of Your Life"". And Clipse's ""Wamp Wamp"" is scattered frenetically across Alex Gopher's retro-electro ""Motorcycle"", their tempo (and the Neptunes' lingering steel drum hook) ratcheted up to Bambaataa velocity. (One aside: A-Trak, who got his first turntable as a bar mitzvah gift, noticeably omits Malice's ""It cools to a tight wad/ The Pyrex is Jewish"" verse.) Dirty South Dance isn't an entirely accurate title, though, and there's a decent-sized glut of international debris that breaks the theme. And aside from the Pack's Bay Area anthem ""At the Club""-- with its glassy-eyed ""in the club, I shake my ass/ At the party, I shake my ass"" chorus sounding enough like a stereotypical deadpan electroclash chanteuse to feel right at home alongside Cassius' ""Feeling for You""-- most of them push the mix out of focus. Gwen Stefani's dippy ""disco Tetris"" dud ""Yummy"" clashes against the disco Katamari Damacy of LCD Soundsystem's ""Time to Get Away"", French rappers TTC sneeringly sing-song their way through ""Quitte La Piste"" (which, to its benefit, features a synth hook that sounds like a Ducati exhaust hooked up to a pipe organ), and the mandated-by-law appearance from M.I.A. has her muttering ""XR2"" over a Giorgio Moroder track-- which sounds all right, but why should she be the one get all the Scarface quotes? As if there was still any question that this techno shit belongs anywhere near hip-hop, A-Trak ends his mix with a good Q.E.D.-- naturally, it's Timbaland's beat for ""My Love"", which he lets fly at its own familiar pace for a moment before frantically juggling it and eventually cranking it up as fast as it'll go, transforming it into a dizzying explosion of breakbeat hardcore that sounds like the Prodigy circa 91. It's one of the most berserk codas you'll ever hear in a dance mix, but A-Trak knows well enough to bring that beat back down to its original pitch before switching the lights off. He may have just spent the last 50 minutes pairing off some unlikely artists, but he's too busy moving the crowd to smirk at the results.","The accomplished DJ-- who's turned the art of turntablism back toward its original party-rocking focus-- here blends contemporary hip-hop and blog house into a mixtape that recalls the Perfect Beats-era sound.

Betti-Cola / Come Out Come Out,Cub,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b052b1335d7bf169a0c9/1:1/w_160/cd9ca6f8.jpg,2007-05-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11902-betti-cola-come-out-come-out/,MintMint,"Like most artists, 1990s cuddlecore queens Cub resented being pigeonholed. In a way, that's kind of a shame. When I say the Vancouver-based trio's early recordings are among the cutest things I've heard, I'm giving some of my highest praise, but to most people, ""cute"" probably means something less, well, substantial. Especially when applied to three young women with only modest technical chops, the term could seem both confining and condescending. Sure enough, Cub were moving in a noisier direction by 1997, when they called it quits. In interviews, singer/bassist Lisa Marr would emphasize her smoking and drinking, two very grown-up vices; at another point, then-drummer Neko Case shocked an unruly audience member with a roundhouse right. Twee as fuck, maaan. Cub may have been understandably uncomfortable being written off as cute, but their music-- mostly punky three-chord twee-pop similar to Sacramento's Tiger Trap or a Pacific Northwest all-girl Ramones-- was often more memorable, emotionally affecting, and flat-out fun than so much of the self-serious, middlebrow cock rock that tends to top year-end lists. Their 1993 collection of EPs and new material, Betti-Cola, which features future New Pornographer and solo songstress Case behind the kit on a couple of tracks, shows Cub finding their ramshackle, sweetly innocent voice. When they began to toy with their squeaky-clean image on 1995's Come Out Come Out, a good band got even better. Both albums, recently given the deluxe-reissue treatment on original label Mint, come as endearingly awkward reminders of a free-spirited enthusiasm too often missing in today's crop of licensing-ready indie-pop upstarts. At least cuteness can be controversial. Featuring cover art by Archie Comics artist and Josie & the Pussycats creator Dan DeCarlo, Betti-Cola compiles Cub's early Mint EPs, Pep and Hot Dog Day, and adds 15 newer songs-- plus, on this reissue, four previously 7-inch-only tracks and one live ""Wipe Out"" goof. Girly and unabashedly juvenile, Betti-Cola lets Marr, guitarist/singer Robynn Iwata, and a rotating cast of drummers breeze through songs about chinchillas, dolphin boys, flying carpets, and eventual Destroyer guitarist Nicolas Bragg; like Jonathan Richman post-Modern Lovers, Cub prove that childlike whimsy can be, in the words of Joe Harvard, ""a purer form of rebellion."" As with most proudly amateurish bands, Cub actually improved given practice, so jangly mid-album tracks like lonesome ""Pretty Pictures"" and popsicle-packing ""A Picnic"" are among the best here, charming and melodic. ""It's true, the world is ugly/ But everything could change,"" Marr sings on ""Someday"", a wrenchingly optimistic love song for no one. The covers-- the Beach Boys' ""Surfer Girl"", Beat Happening's ""Cast a Shadow"", Daniel Johnston's ""Tell Me Now""-- are well chosen, always neatly suited for Cub's powerfully light-hearted delivery. Cub tighten up as a band still more for Come Out Come Out without losing their appealing simplicity, thanks in part to increasingly confident songwriting. Having a full-time drummer, Lisa G., probably also helped. The reissue tacks on an alternate version of adorable watching-you-sleep song ""Your Bed"", a silly live version of ""Cast My Shadow"", a sillier radio rendition of the debut's ""My Chinchilla"", and an, uh, ambient-house mix of early song ""Go Fish"", but the original full-length itself still stands as one of the better twee-pop albums from an era that also brought us great material from the Pastels, the Softies, Rocketship, Tullycraft, and others. ""New York City"" captures the joy of being young and in love in a big city, with fuzz-tone guitars and girl-group melodies, while organ-accented ""Everything's Geometry"" goes for jangly guitars but fuzzy math: ""If 1 is 3 and 3 is 9, then we can be happy all of the time."" Here, pumpkins turn into princesses, and a ""flaming red bobsled"" can be a thing of menace. A closing Go-Go's cover, ""Vacation"", is as deceptively exuberant as you'd expect. The album takes a darker turn on songs like bloodstained ""Life of Crime"", but it never loses its spirit of fun. Where Betti-Cola seems assured of the modern ideal of romantic love, Come Out Come Out interjects playfully self-aware anxiety next to the giddiness of tra-la-la love songs like ""I'm Your Angel"". On ""Tomorrow Go Away"", Marr sings (with some irony): ""We never talk of love/ 'Cause I'm much too cool for that now/ And you fuck me on the floor/ 'Cause there's no room for a bed... We eat lunch with your parents while you're wishing I was dead."" It's been said that you can reason someone into believing in God, but you can't reason them out of it, and I wonder if it's the same way with true love: Once you've taken that leap of faith, does everything change? Bad as they may have wanted to be, Cub landed squarely on the side of the angels. And that's totally punk rock.","As heard on these expanded reissues, the Vancouver band that once included Neko Case on drums gives cuddlecore a good name.

God Save the Clientele,The Clientele,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06f9d034d5c69bf4893/1:1/w_160/0b91d2eb.jpg,2007-05-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10206-god-save-the-clientele/,Merge,"It's a little difficult not to hum the melody to ""Daydream Believer"" during the opening of ""Here Comes the Phantom"", the first track from the Clientele's third full-length album. The chords bump against those of the Monkees classic without mimicking them precisely; it's not what is played that sounds so familiar, but how, as the piano moves with a whimsical bounce that evokes someone dancing in a brightly-lit studio with walls the color of a television's test pattern. And when Alasdair MacLean begins to sing, it's like all the rain that fell during the first 50 or so songs the Clientele recorded has finally given way to sunlight: ""April in my mind, but I can't sleep/ So I took a walk around the trees/ And what did I see?/ Summer waits in the leaves/ As lovely as I've ever known."" We hear of cops picking flowers while walking their beats and a heart that plays like a violin. We've been introduced to a new Clientele world. But it's not all golden shafts of light: ""Happiness just comes and goes,"" MacLean sings to finish out the verse. Listening to God Save the Clientele I keep thinking of how, through their first two albums, various EPs, and the godlike singles collection Suburban Light, the Clientele seemed defined by a certain kind of thoughtful stasis. They were the band that to casual observers sounded the same from track to track, employing a handful of production tricks and a slightly larger handful of lyrical themes to articulate a rich and complex world informed by magical realism, memory, and the ache of nostalgia. For good or ill, this uniformity seems to be slipping away. God Save the Clientele sounds like the work of the same band, but it shows them in a new, brighter light, broadened in both sound and outlook. In terms of sonics and tunes, these changes are welcome and logical, expanding upon the sound with which they made their name without sacrificing intimacy or risking coming across overcooked. Most of these tracks were recorded by Lambchop's Mark Nevers at his Beech House studio in Nashville. Brian O'Shaughnessy, who worked on Strange Geometry, also recorded two numbers and mixed the lot. String arrangements-- and there are lots of them-- are again by Louis Philippe, the indie pop veteran with the golden ears. Suffice to say, God Save sounds warm, balanced, and absolutely gorgeous. Nevers' commitment to analog and his stated desire to recapture the depth of field of the finest recordings from the 1970s are matched well to the Clientele's classicist aesthetic. The range of guitar tones, along with tasteful use of orchestrations, piano, and pedal steel, has led to an album that sounds absurdly expensive and lush for an indie release. The band's easy melodicism is intact. ""Here Comes the Phantom"" and ""Bookshop Casanova"" are the sort of peppy, tuneful pop that would have sounded odd coming from the Clientele five years ago. The latter has been remarked upon for its Beatles-referencing lyrics (""You've got my name/ Pick up my number/ Come on, darling/ Let's be lovers"") and an overall mood that brings to mind the Fab Four (seems like there's probably a writer of paperbacks lurking somewhere in this particular shop). ""Winter on Victoria Street"" sounds like a Clientele title of old but it's another swinging track that, like ""Bookshop"", has lyrics that work the edge between longing and lust (""Watching a movie and getting bored/ Trying to get up with the girl next door""). ""The Queen of Seville"" might be the most beautiful ballad the band has recorded, with a Erik Satie-like piano line, acoustic guitar picking that oozes melancholy, and a radiant pedal steel that sounds dialed in from a rain-soaked countrypolitan dream. Balancing its sonic pleasures, God Save is more difficult to get a handle on lyrically. Which is ironic, considering that MacLean's words now seem simpler, more direct, and ultimately more grounded in pop tradition. On early singles like ""Reflections After Jane"", MacLean's viewpoint seemed utterly strange and simultaneously familiar, like he was pointing out things we'd all noticed but no one had bothered to articulate. ""On the bridge the workers pass in threes and fours and fives,"" he sang back then, and you could see those dudes in your mind, striding along with their lunch pails, and you knew it was important even if you weren't quite sure why. The instantly evocative couplets here are harder to find, and there are more references to a larger, more generalized big picture. Another of the album's stronger songs is titled ""From Brighton Beach to Santa Monica"", which is a whole lot of real estate, even if the verses are actually quite specific. (""Voices in the park following us down to Vincent Street/ Ghosts inside the yard, rattling their balls and chains."") ""The Dance of the Hours"" sets prose to music, and the quickly whispered words are impossible to catch on record. Fortunately, they're included in the album's liners. The song's tale is quintessential Clientele, telling of a tiny knight found in a back garden by a child. It's the kind of story that could be covered in 10 words but MacLean takes a couple hundred anyway, teasing out every detail of the small figure's appearance (""I realize now that his delicate frame could only have been nourished by medieval foods: turnips, blood sausage, perhaps songbirds roasted in a thin, toxic sauce of mercury"") and circumstances. That feeling of a banal moment being imbued with so much potential significance, if only one would only take the time to comb through it, is what the Clientele's music captures at its very best. God Save may not get there quite as often as Strange Geometry or the songs collected on Suburban Light, but it does so much else right such potential shortcomings are easy to set aside.","After two albums, various EPs, and the godlike singles collection Suburban Light, this London band inches away from articulating a rich and complex world informed by magical realism, memory, and the ache of nostalgia toward a new, brighter light, broadened in both sound and outlook.

VI,The Fucking Champs,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0385e6ef95969321f33/1:1/w_160/b8a3d744.jpg,2007-05-09 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10157-vi/,Drag City,"What an opportune time for a Fucking Champs release. Seems every Joe Indie's been losing their shit over some record with guitars that sound like they're playing violin parts, employing homophony, polyphony, counterpoint, and all those other concepts taught in any high school's state-mandated music appreciation class. Artists ranging from Mastodon to Ratatat to Marnie Stern have whetted the indie audience's appetite for tight-yet-intricate axe compositions, and the veteran Champs, composed of two indie-metal lifers and ex-Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green, make a case for the old guard on VI. In the past, this portion of a Fucking Champs review would be reserved for prog-rock apologies/pleas aimed at indie fans repulsed by shifting time signatures, modes, and advanced guitar playing techniques. However, with the number of ambitious, technically adroit albums released and praised today (c.f. Ys, Welcome to the Black Parade, Friend and Foe, etc.), you'd possess a lot of gall to dismiss the Champs as pretentious or esoteric. VI strips down the prog to an ingestible 2-guitar/drums setup, forgoing many of the spacey, Yes-influenced synths and flare of previous releases and instead narrowing its focus on more immediate hooks and transitions. ""The Loge"" kicks the album off on an accessible note, stomping through a series of melodic patterns not inherent to metal guitar but pretty ass-kicking all the same. Whereas a lot of math rock tries to obscure its nerdiness with stygian minor modes and excess distortion, this opener contains equal parts pomp and fist-pump, even during its palm-muted grinder of a bridge. The wistful ""Spring Break"" boasts its share of metal emasculating as well, bookending its middle rawk-out section with an airy guitar opening and carefree closing solo. The brief transitional tracks particularly flash a lot of nuanced ideas, such as the stately ""Abide With Me"" or ""Champs Fanfare"", both potential national anthems for countries that don't yet exist, or the eerily calm ""Insomnia"", one of the few instances of synths on the album. Of course, the threat of novelty still haunts the Fucking Champs, and with the recent explosion of Nintendo-core bands, that threat feels more real than ever. The intro of ""Fozzy Goes to Africa"" sounds like the soundtrack for a pixelated, 8-bit kid embarking on his first RPG journey, while the remainder of the song stagnates on a seemingly never-ending meat-and-potatoes AOR riff. This prosaic plug-and-chug songwriting pops up in several other tracks, hardly tempered by the baroque King Crimson knockoff ""Dolores Park"" or the band's best stab at Xanaxed Madchester, ""That Crystal Behind You? (Are You Channeling)"". Still, VI serves as a fun changeup both to today's more doomsday prog-metal and hipster-approved electroclash fugues. The album, while technically proficient, packs enough surprises and raw energy to avoid rote Yngwie Malmsteen-esque ""songwriting"" tropes. Don't be surprised if this heady offering leaves you less eager to fire up your lighter and crowd surf as it does to fire up your TI-83 and take the math portion of the SATs.","Sixth album from proggy indie metal mainstays loses some synths but adheres closely to their established sound, now oddly in step with the times.

LP1,Plastiscines,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04f9d034d5c69bf485e/1:1/w_160/8f9fe99b.jpg,2007-05-09 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10177-lp1/,Virgin,"One thing that separates humans from other animals is the ability to imagine a world without oneself in it. This extends to the world after your death, places you're unlikely ever to visit, fantasy worlds that don't actually exist, and of course the world as it existed before you were born. As such, we have a strange ability to be nostalgic for things we never actually experienced, which keeps young bands coming back to music that bloomed and faded long before they could walk, much less be cognizant of cultural currents. The members of French quartet Plastiscines weren't around for the first wave of punk-- they were barely in primary school when Nirvana broke-- but that doesn't stop them from having a genuine affinity with the sounds of the UK and Manhattan undergrounds from ten years before their time. The ""Hey, I can do this too"" spirit of early punk is what shines through most brightly here, though the notion is filtered through the Libertines, the Strokes and riot grrrl. There's very little information on this band in English, but the hilariously/horrendously translated interviews I've read all seem to detour into observations of how unusual it is for four 19-year-old French women to start a punk band and release an album, along with discussions of the attendant resentment they've incurred in their homeland. The band's approach is basic, a few chords chugging along on distorted guitars, drums and bass thudding away, but lead vocalist Katty has a low, brassy voice, backed by exuberant group singing from her bandmates that puts them closer to the Clash's pop classicist end of the punk spectrum. The album is split between French and English songs. Though the English can be charmingly awkward, with strangely accented words and syllables, I generally prefer them in French, where their confidence really comes through. One exception there is ""Human Rights"", one of a couple songs that finds the band reaching into the political realm with a plea for consideration over a rugged punk tune that takes a few cues from the Adverts. Lead single ""Loser"" is sung entirely in French apart from the title, which works well with the great chorus melody. This song best showcases the group's pop chops, and ultimately, I think they have more potential moving in that direction than they do getting more agitated. Further evidence is on display in ""(Zazie fait de la) Bicyclette"", which nips at the group vocals with new wave organ and accentuates the bounciness of the rhythm with bubbling glockenspiel. It's something of a nod to the groovy pop of 1960s France, where eccentricity and humor rode shotgun with arty seriousness. Likewise, ""Pop in, Pop Out!"" is a hugely enjoyable nod to the excitable ye-ye pop of a long-gone era-- that could totally be Brigitte Bardot squeaking out the title between instrumental spasms. Producer Maxime Schmitt, a longtime Kraftwerk associate and EMI record executive, keeps things stripped and focused on the girls, but more importantly, he hasn't pressed them to expand the songs beyond their natural lengths. More than half the album's thirteen songs clock in under two minutes, and the whole thing whips by in less than a half hour, which is perfect for this kind of thing. The Plastiscines offer basically what you hope for from musicians their age: huge potential for the future and a lot of fun right now.","Four young women from France draw inspiration from the spirit of early punk.

Alone in the Dark Wood,Fursaxa,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05613d197565213a44f/1:1/w_160/e4a43442.jpg,2007-05-09 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10182-alone-in-the-dark-wood/,ATP,"For something so simple, the music of Philadelphia magician Tara Burke (aka Fursaxa) is remarkably distinctive. Her bag of tricks isn't exactly bulging-- she usually uses multi-tracked vocals wrapped in organ drones, acoustic guitar, and a light dusting of percussion. Yet the tone-hymns she spins from those basic elements are unmistakably her own. Burke expanded this alchemy to perfection on 2005's Lepidoptera, using atmospherics to weave songs and melodies to create environments. On Alone in the Dark Wood, the fifth Fursaxa full-length, those atmospheres and environments dominate. There is less to latch onto in the way of structure or melody; where on Lepidoptera Burke developed ideas over long arcs, here she opts for smaller sketches (almost half of the tracks hover in the two-minute range)-- more like haiku than short stories. Yet her curling plumes still entrance, the musical equivalent of a hypnotist's watch swinging before your eyes. True to its title, this album has the aura of a late-night hike in which ghosts seem to waft up from the misty ground. On ""Lunaria Enters the Blue Lodge"", a creaky organ melts into acoustic guitar strummed in cresting waves. ""Bells of Capistrano"" mixes monasterial chimes with flutes chirping like insects and birds, while the shimmering, Steve Reich-like ""Clé Elum"" resembles a sonic smoke signal coming from a far-off gamelan orchestra. The best pieces on Alone don't evoke environments as much as they create sonic universes. On ""Sheds Her Skin"", Burke sounds like the ghost of Tiny Tim, offering delicate ukulele-like strums and warbling vocals akin to Yoko Ono's experiments. The a cappella ""Nawne Ye"" spawns a choir from Burke's chants, and ""Alone in the Dark Wood"" bewitches with detuned guitar and distant moans. Most mesmerizing is ""In the Hollow Mink Shoal"". Here, Burke's tentative vocals match the endearing hesitance of Vashti Bunyan, and lead deftly into a mind-locked acoustic séance. That's all a lot to chew on, but the most impressive aspect of Alone in the Dark Wood is how Burke's layered vocals never grow stale. In so many songs, cycles of wordless purr recur nearly to the point of rote repetition. But like an endless chant that clears a meditator's mind, Burke's singing is more a portal than a pat device. And at its best, Fursaxa's music is a Zen koan, as mysteriously unsolvable as it is beautifully simple.","On her fifth Fursaxa full-length, Tara Burke again uses atmospherics to weave songs and melodies to create environments.

...And the Family Telephone,Page France,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b061b1335d7bf169a0e8/1:1/w_160/3bf9ed08.jpg,2007-05-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10193-and-the-family-telephone/,Suicide Squeeze,"The word ""crooked"" pops up frequently in the lyrics to Page France's new record, and its two definitions apply to both sides of the band's one-of-a-kind theatricality. ""Crooked"" can refer to either dishonesty or a physical irregularity, and on Page France and the Family Telephone, the group's third and weirdest album to date, singer and lyricist Michael Nau navigates both iterations; the lopsided celebration of ""Mr. Violin and Dancing Bear"" (""You get what you get/ When you bite from the tree/ A crookeder you, and a crookeder me"") coming after the trickster vibe of album-opener ""The Ruby-Ring Man"", in which he confesses: ""I lie so well, I even start to buy it, too."" Over the course of Page France's three full-lengths, Nau has gradually removed himself as the lyrical focus. The boyish sensitivity of Come, I'm a Lion gave way to Hello, Dear Wind's conceptual folk, and on Telephone's ""Circus Head (Nobody Knows)"" he admits to creating an album-long disguise for himself as a Barnum character-- a huckster, unsuccessful joke-teller, and magician with a playfully devious streak. And in the long tradition of sad clowns, Nau is nothing if not painfully self-aware. In a voice reminiscent of Sonny Bono's pinched paisley caterwaul, he laments on ""A Belly to the Sea"": ""So I fear it's all a joke, that I just wasn't supposed to make/ Apples in a cloud of smoke/ So fake, I'm so fake."" Then, on ""The Joker's Joke"": ""I am a stagefright comedian, that nobody wants to go see again/ My jokes are so long out of season, but they're laughing at me."" Of course, like the fairy tales, Bible stories, and lullabies to which Telephone is clearly indebted, external sinister forces lurk just beyond the flower patches. Page France keep them at bay, partly with a miniature army of sunny guitars, glockenspiels, and the merry harmonies of Whitney McGraw, but also by motivating the more potent force of simple, blissful naivete. ""Beware the bug-infested apples,"" Nau warns on ""Rooster and Its Crow"", before scampering up the tree and picking a basket full of them for his sweetheart. This instance of winsome romance streaks through Telephone, best expressed at the close of ""Wet Dog Afternoon"": ""I still love you dear, perhaps it gets the best of me sometimes."" As happens with all Page France records, Telephone's overt Christian symbolism will no doubt result in many scrambles to alternately celebrate or bemoan the Almighty's infiltration of indie pop. But those searching for evangelical underpinnings of Page France songs are barking up the wrong apple tree. Nau's interest is much more arty than devotional, merging surrealist lyrics (the sun as a giant ""eye,"" for example) with Biblical imagery (""I led a king through flaming doors"") as a formal experiment, relying on both aesthetic traditions to help him express the dark underpinnings of even the most sunny scenarios. This braiding of the unconscious with the Unknown, as crookedly rendered as it might be, is Telephone's greatest charm-- an inventive intertwining that gives the record a woozy, playful charisma. Like Danielson's Daniel Smith, Nau creates a loopy musical world concerned with the extratextual elements of organized religion, with any converts he attracts along the way merely interested in playing along. Like religion, music only exists inasmuch as it is performed, and on Telephone's closer ""Casting Day"", Nau seeks to recruit a new crop of participants for his next show, asking: ""Who do you wanna be? In that crooked afterlife, at the bottom of the sea?""","The band's third effort, and its first for Suicide Squeeze, is an engaging folk-pop pastiche of surrealism and religious symbolism.

New Moon,Elliott Smith,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b071b1335d7bf169a101/1:1/w_160/b1975bfa.jpg,2007-05-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10208-new-moon/,Kill Rock Stars,"Elliott Smith's legacy is best spoken by his records. For all the emphasis placed on his unhappy backstory and the distressing nature of his death, Smith left behind a body of work that defies and exceeds any stereotyping. Sadness may be the easiest emotional current to pick up on in his songs, but Smith's expressive range was as wide as it was subtle; his music could be angry, funny, hopeful, and despondent, often at the same time. New Moon collects two CDs' worth of material recorded around the same time as 1995's Elliott Smith and its 1997 follow-up Either/Or, and unlike typical posthumous releases (not to mention second ones), is a genuinely worthy addition to a stunningly consistent catalog. Part of what makes both Either/Or and 1998's XO so essential is Smith's avoidance of ""classic album"" compartmentalization; you don 't get ""the sad song,"" followed by ""the experimental song,"" followed by ""the upbeat song."" Smith didn't record specifically towards any album, he just recorded-- more or less constantly. At their inception, the songs compiled for New Moon were no less significant than those that wound up making the cut for Elliott Smith and Either/Or, and for the most part they're no less developed. Smith's signature style is more musical than it is aesthetic; from the lo-fi folk of Roman Candle through the muscular chamber-pop of Figure 8, Smith's songwriting tics remain completely recognizable. New Moon is overflowing with characteristic melodic turns and unexpected chord changes, yet still covers a good deal of ground stylistically. The chugging acoustic guitar of ""Big Decision"" conjures Johnny Cash, while ""New Monkey"" subtly nods to a similarly titled Beatles song. Each song seems fully realized in its own right; for a 2xCD posthumous compilation, it's unbelievably refreshing to not pick up even the slightest whiff of exploitative barrel-scraping. Like much of Smith's material from this era, New Moon is by and large quiet, acoustic, and emotionally complicated. It's easy to see why Smith's music earned him a reputation as a ""sad sack,"" but such dismissals don't really hold up to any scrutiny. When asked whether he considered himself a ""lo-fi"" artist, Smith once responded that he simply didn't want the recording process to be ""a drag."" Smith's interest in the the expressive potential of recording comes through loud and clear on New Moon; even when the subject or tone of a song is depressing, it still carries an unmistakable note of joy. Which is certainly not to say that New Moon finds him sounding ""happy."" Many of the songs here are almost unbearably melancholy, but their weight is the product of expert craft, not wanton self-indulgence. The coda of ""Talking to Mary"", in which Smith repeatedly intones ""One day she'll go/ I told you so,"" would not be nearly as powerful without the subtle tension and movement in Smith's guitar part. ""All Cleaned Out"", which hints at the musical and lyrical concerns that Smith took up with XO, is made all the more affecting by a second vocal line that injects well-placed harmonies into an already memorable melody. Every musical decision on New Moon feels both intuitive and considered; never obtrusive or distracting, but thoroughly rewarding when examined in depth. Nowhere is this clearer than on an early version of the career-making ""Miss Misery"". This is the fourth, and earliest, version of this song that I've heard, and it speaks to the incredible care and refinement that went into Smith's recordings. The melodic backbone of the song is definitely present on this version, as are formative fragments of the lyrics, harmonies, and arrangements. It's fascinating to hear this track in such an early stage, but downright humbling to connect the dots to the song it eventually became. Smith had an uncanny and arguably unmatched talent for developing his music to suit his ever-evolving arrangement and production techniques, and every intermediate version of ""Miss Misery"" makes perfect sense the way it's performed and recorded. Phrases like ""rare talent"" are thrown around all the time these days, but this compilation makes painfully clear just how unique and valuable this music is. Smith's visionary qualities were not terribly flashy or transgressive, and his great musical gifts were not those of innovation. Instead, he steadily and quietly wrote, honed, and recorded a body of beautifully executed, deeply moving records not quite like any others. Consider him the patron saint of hobbyists, a talented and dedicated craftsman with a tireless love of the creative process.","This set of unreleased material from the late singer/songwriter collects two CDs' worth of material recorded around the same time as Elliott Smith and Either/Or, and makes for a worthy and welcome addition to a stunningly consistent catalog.

Modern Love and Death,Hail Social,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03bc0084474cd0c1bec/1:1/w_160/d88959d0.jpg,2007-05-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10160-modern-love-and-death/,Hail Social,"I heard that you and your band sold your angular guitars and bought synthesizers. Philadelphia-based quartet Hail Social trade the post-post-punk herky-jerky of their self-titled 2005 Polyvinyl debut for this year's self-released sophomore effort, Modern Love and Death, moving toward synth-pop without giving up the first album's dancefloor aspirations and plentiful hooks. The group seem to have lost some of their personality in the exchange. Classics Dept. in-joke moniker aside, Hail Social have been slickly populist since the beginning. That's part of their appeal, but the watered-down vibe too often accompanying such boomer-friendly accessibility is also the band's biggest stumbling block. On Modern Love and Death, the shadow of radio nostalgia hanging over Hail Social's Franz Ferdinand-skinny, Duran Duran-humongoid debut (""Radio, radio,"" singer Dayve Hawk proclaimed) recurs both sonically and lyrically. ""All night, we can listen to the radio,"" Hawk suggests on vocoder-enhanced ""All Night"" over romantically gooey synths that could've been eBayed from fellow Philadelphians Hall & Oates. A track later, the title number goes in for funky guitar licks and four-on-the-floor beats (too clean to be Shitdisco, not stark-raving enough for nu-rave) as Hawk imagines ""no more songs, no more favorites."" Could this be love? ""It felt a little more vacant,"" Hawk muses in his polished tenor. At times Modern Love & Death reaches radio-appropriate catchiness, but that doesn't mean the songs are necessarily memorable. Nothing here tops opener ""Annabelle"", with galloping drum programming and disco hi-hat decorating Hawk's sentimental reminiscence about a neighborhood bad girl. ""Hell belongs to us,"" he quips, but he's just as likely to repeat such standard-issue pop pleasantries as ""You're the only girl that I will ever love."" Where a group like Hot Chip would explore robot-of-love sonics and give even a song about (say) a ""Boy from School"" a distinctive angle, Hail Social's tunes sound like they could've been played at any 80s-themed party in the past five years. ""I don't know if I can live without you,"" Hawk worries on ""Heaven"", another standout in terms of tunefulness, if not aesthetic or, um, lyrics. Right, right, not everything people dance to needs to be Dostoevsky, let alone LCD Soundsystem, but Hail Social's lack of unique characteristics becomes a bigger bummer on the second half of Modern Love and Death. Y'all don't want this party to fizzle out early, right? ""One U Love"" blips and bleeps into rapidfire verses, but it's pretty much the tonight-let's-be-lovers rule that makes exceptions like Natasha Bedingfield's ""(I Wanna Have Your) Babies"" so refreshing. Then again, ""The Strangest Things"" lurches into an insistent ""Blue Monday""-like bass line, but listen to the two tracks side by side and the differences between New Order's trailblazing genius and Hail Social's shiny, retro adequacy should be quickly apparent. Hail Social may be glad to give the people what they want, but they don't seem to know what people really want.","Philadelphia-based quartet trade the post-post-punk herky-jerky of their self-titled 2005 Polyvinyl debut and move toward synth-pop.

Supastarr EP,DJ Blaqstarr,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05c5e6ef95969321f65/1:1/w_160/afea7a27.jpg,2007-05-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10188-supastarr-ep/,Mad Decent,"The 22-year-old Baltimore producer DJ Blaqstarr has carved out a weird little space for himself. In his hometown, he's something of a pop phenom, but he's totally unknown outside it. Blaqstarr (no relation to Mos Def or Talib Kweli) makes Baltimore club music, the frenetically physical hybridized form of black dance music that's thrived for nearly two decades in the 410 area code but which has only started to make inroads outside it. And even as club tracks find their way into the record crates of out-of-town hipster DJs, the music's producers have yet to taste anything resembling national fame. Blaqstarr's club-rap tracks for local MCs like Young Leek (""Jiggle It"") and D.O.G. (""Ryda Girl"") have helped his clients secure major-label contracts, and he's also produced his own apocalyptic local club anthems like ""Hands Up Thumbs Down"" and ""You Keep on Fuckin' Around"". But Blaqstarr himself has only recently signed his first national record deal, and it's with a small start-up rather than with a hegemonic major; he's now the second signee to Diplo's Mad Decent label, following the rabble-rousing baile funk trio Bonde Do Role. As Baltimore rap blogger and former Pitchfork contributor Al Shipley recently pointed out to me, there's a pretty good chance that all of Blaqstarr's Mad Decent 12""s combined won't sell as much as one of the mix CDs he sells exclusively at the local Baltimore shoestore chain Downtown Locker Room. So maybe it makes sense for Blaqstarr to try out his weirdest sounds on the Supastarr EP, his first national release. Club is generally a fairly utilitarian form of dance music; most tracks loop a couple of identifiable drum-breaks and slather them with instant-recognition samples. Most of the track's on Supastarr stick with club's relentless BPM-levels, but they're emptier and spacier, leaning hard on echo-effects and awkwardly lurching beat constructions. More than most club producers, Blaqstarr layers his productions, adding and subtracting different elements throughout their running times. On a few tracks, he also sings in weightlessly airy falsetto-rasp. The title track repeats a single phrase over and over like a mantra (""I like the way you move, I love the way you are/ I love your sexy ways, girl, cause you're my superstar""), giving the song a sort of hypnotic beauty that rarely finds room to surface in a genre as dense and hectic as this one. On another song, ""Rockstarrz"", he multitracks his voice into a ghostly Boyz II Men chorus, ominously cooing over a loop of fluttering strings and muted horn-stabs. ""Tote It"" uses gunshot sound-effects as percussion. ""Check Me Out Like"" phases its ravey synth-beeps back and forth and sounds best when the drums drop out completely. ""Shake It to the Ground"" has a guest-spot from the 16-year-old female rapper Rye Rye that would sound like garden-variety kiddie-rap if not for Rye Rye's eerie deadpan delivery and for the disorienting layers of echo that Blaqstarr piles on, both of which turn it into something bizarrely ominous and otherworldly. For all its showy production tricks, though, the EP feels something like a work in progress, a young producer playing around with different sounds to figure out what suits him best. Most of the tracks don't have the fiery immediacy of something like ""Hands Up Thumbs Down"", and not all of the ideas work. And for anyone used to hearing club on radio mixshows or mix CDs, it'll always be a bit weird to hear a bunch of club tracks arranged as discrete individual songs, not given a chance to build on each other's momentum. But that's fine; this is a twelve-inch, after all, and it almost certainly works better as a DJ tool than as a stand-alone release. And it's still club music; even at its most complicated and counterintuitive, it's still funky and insistent as all hell. But it's also something more than that; when those chilly layers of vocal samples and stripped-down drum-loops work, they add up to something really exciting. If anyone is going to push club music outside Baltimore's city limits and turn it into the bizarre pop subgenre it could be, Blaqstarr could be the one.","Diplo's Mad Decent offers an EP from its second signee, a 22-year-old producer who has found fame in the 410 area code making Baltimore club music.

Monstrance,Andy Partridge,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05913d197565213a454/1:1/w_160/fc58f240.jpg,2007-05-08 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10184-monstrance/,Ape,"Before Andy Partridge locked down his place in the new-wave pantheon as the brain and public face of XTC, he had two loves. One was a famous affair with slightly-off pop and the other was a secret crush on free jazz. Fans may have seen the signs in 1994's Through the Hill, his record with ambient composer Harold Budd. Partridge finally fully liberates his love for Pharaoh Sanders and Albert Ayler on Monstrance, reuniting with keyboardist Barry Andrews (who left XTC in 1979, later starting Shriekback) and recruiting Martyn Barker (drummer in Andrews' band). Together they abandon the domain of shimmery pop with a twist for a moody, dissonant netherworld. It bears repeating: Don't expect to encounter XTC here. And good luck finding Shriekback. But if you take Monstrance on its own terms-- bringing a yen for improvisational, instrumental music-- you might feel the strange thrill of eavesdropping on a freewheeling, nonsensical conversation. Culled from roughly eight hours of recordings, we still get to hear the awkward lulls, the autistic blurts, the little foils that often enrich the surrounding noise. Lightly edited and proudly free of overdubbing, Monstrance allows concepts to roam, phrases to drift. The record's long prelude, ""I Lovely Cosmonaut"" unfolds in slow motion, as a rhythm of silences accrues in the potholes, everyone swerving around it, stubbornly, until a fuller rhythm crystallizes. ""Winterwerk"" is not as coy. On the contrary, Barker turns it into twirling, tropical carnival. Nevertheless, the longer tracks are the richest here. Coming in at 16 minutes, ""Priapple"" is arguably the centerpiece of the album. Partridge heroically sticks to a pair of fuzzy chords, as Andrews mounts a relentless and chaotic siege, while Barker answers with erratic percussion. Every song-- and not always for the better-- seems to be at war with itself. ""Chaingang"" milks a sense of unease out of two rhythms, Partridge's ragged Beefheart riffs in 7/4 and Barker in 4/4, that fleetingly lock into place. These blink-and-you'll-miss-it resolutions, each one a tiny solar eclipse, give the song its thrilling air of flux and incompleteness. During the whole drama, Andrews remains the outsider looking in. He works this same routine in the first half of ""Torturetainment"", while he drills holes-- it literally sounds like heavy machinery-- into the oddball groove Partridge and Barker crafted together. Calling this ""unlistenable noise"" is baffling. This record falls closer to the viscous, chaotic beauty of Swans than the poisonous crunch of Metal Machine Music. All the stretches of darkness have real depth, while at its calmer and more intimate moments, Monstrance evokes the stoic, spacey impressionism of ECM chamber jazz.","The XTC leader finally fully liberates his love for Pharaoh Sanders and Albert Ayler on this 2xCD album, which also finds him reuniting with former bandmate and Shriekback co-founder Barry Andrews.

Everybody,The Sea and Cake,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0625e6ef95969321f6a/1:1/w_160/b3c7bb63.jpg,2007-05-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10194-everybody/,Thrill Jockey,"I've never seen the Sea and Cake play, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did so with their backs to the crowd. Their albums have never been unapproachable-- most of the time, in fact, they're pretty and inviting. They have great ears for rhythm, borrowing from bossa nova and Afro-pop, and they've a charming vocalist in Sam Prekop. And yet they can come off as stuffy and cerebral-- the kind of band categorized as ""pop"" by default, the way you'd use the word to describe Stereolab or their neighbors and contemporaries Tortoise. These qualities became even more prominent with the keyboards and electronic dalliances on albums beginning in 1997 with The Fawn up through 2003's One Bedroom. So I picture them on stage interpreting some fluttering theme over bongos and layers of analog keyboards, their brows furrowed over nailing a sound rather than playing a song. Whether ethnic or electronic, whatever the Sea and Cake runs through their eccentric filter winds up sounding slightly ""off,"" either from the space and ambiguity in their compositions or the hoarse peculiarity of Prekop's voice. Yet even a more direct, backyard-barbecue-ready album album like Everybody still works. In fact, it may fit the band's idiosyncrasies even better. In moving a little closer to the middle-of-the-road, they start exuding something long absent from the group: warmth. The band that once cultivated abstraction and aloofness now, as elder statesmen of Chicago post-rock, stuffs its liners with pictures of their hometown next to guitar tablatures spelling out the chords for their songs. The Sea and Cake want to be your friends, all of a sudden. To make another one of those inevitable Chicago comparisons: in a catalog full of stiff frosts, this record is the thaw. Its spring release couldn't be more perfectly timed. ""Up on Crutches"" quickly sets the tone with a sparkling, insistent strum, a typical rock pattern from the drums, and Prekop sounding breathlessly nonchalant while the rhythm builds. ""Too Strong"" has the typically effete melody you'd expect from the band, though it's far more immediate and has a stunning slow jangle of a chorus, deft and breathtaking in its quiet appeal. Not to make him self-conscious, but age suits Prekop well, as he creaks earnestly and sounds wizened and authoritative no matter what he's singing about. This is especially noticeable in ""Middlenight"", where he pines about a possible ""return to better days"" while pedal steel guitar warms the soles of listeners basking in its gorgeous mid-tempo strumming. Everybody picks up the pace in more than one spot, however: ""Crossing Line"" is one of their best pop songs, hummable and slick with a buzzing single-note guitar tearing through Prekop's cheery ""doot-doo-doo""' and simple requests (""All I need's a little smile""). There's some syncopation in ""Exact to Me"" that recalls their love for the bossa nova beat, though it's far too straightforward and sinewy to fit in with their earlier work. Likewise with the monotone pluck of ""Lightning"", with a rhythm so tricky it'd sound like a CD skipping if not for the calming consistency of Prekop's crooning. It's a shame that adjectives like ""pleasant"" wind up sounding backhanded or inadequate; maybe ""playful"" is a better word for Everybody. That it still sounds mischievous and human through the band's studious chops and omnivorous listening habits is no small feat, as these qualities have eluded them for quite a while. It's been four years since their last album, and Chicago's post-rock heyday has past, but the Sea and Cake remain relevant simply by becoming more transparent. They're still in the business of being a pop band, and this might be their most direct pop record.","On their first album in four years, the eccentric Chicago post-rock/pop band adds a new warmth to their sound while putting more focus on melody, resulting in perhaps their most immediate record.

Volta,Björk,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06dea9e61561daa6606/1:1/w_160/f1ffba1a.jpg,2007-05-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10204-volta/,AtlanticElektraOne Little Indian,"If you wanted to find the last time Björk really let her hair down on a record, you'd have to look all the way back to 1995's Post. From ""Army of Me"" (its video found her driving a tank and wearing gold teeth) to ""It's Oh So Quiet"" to ""I Miss You"", that record sired some of the most vibrant songs of her career. It's a side of her we've only caught in brief glimpses ever since.  In the course of moving back to Iceland after a letter bomb scare in 1997, engaging in psychological warfare with Lars Von Trier on the set of 2000's oppressively bleak Dancer in the Dark, falling in love with Matthew Barney in 2001, giving birth to her second child in 2002, and of course, just getting older, Björk's output has become increasingly austere and inward-looking. The unhinged, mischievous screamers that were once her calling card are now mostly a thing of the past, replaced by songs that more closely resemble holy moments than sing-alongs. But in her pre-game interviews for Volta, Björk hinted that it might finally be time to flip the switch back. ""All I wanted for this album was to have fun and do something that was full-bodied and really up,"" she told Pitchfork-- one of a handful of interviews to feature descriptors like ""fun"" and ""poppy"" and ""accessible."" Disappointingly, it turns out that Timbaland and the Technicolor artwork were red herrings-- Volta is not Björk's pop record. Figuring out what it is, actually, is a much more difficult task; where even her most divisive albums have managed to push her artistic boundaries, Volta feels limp and strangely empty-- almost unfinished. Its emptiness is doubly disappointing when considering the caliber of guest performers involved. In addition to Timbaland, Volta features Antony Hegarty (of & the Johnsons fame), improv drummer Chris Corsano, Lightning Bolt drummer Brian Chippendale, Konono No. 1, Malian kora player Toumani Diabate, Chinese pipa player Min Xiao-Fen, and a 10-piece Icelandic brass band. Some of that guestlist goes wasted; Chippendale is banished to slow-build purgatory on the brooding Antony duet ""The Dull Flame of Desire"", while Konono No. 1 are reduced to fighting for space with 37 other elements in the already overstuffed ""Earth Intruders"". Even Timbaland's contributions feel oddly apathetic; aside from ""Earth Intruders"", which pales in comparison to any Timbaland/Björk collaboration you'd hear in your head, neither of his other productions bear much of his imprint at all. With its distorted, squelching rhythms, ""Innocence"" sounds, ironically, more like the work of longtime collaborator Mark Bell, and ""Hope""s scampering percussion and spindly kora lines, while interesting, are marred by an atrocious lyric about terrorism: ""What's the lesser of two evils?/ If a suicide bomber made to look pregnant/ Manages to kill her target or not?"" For a record ostensibly about tribalism and reconnecting with our animal sides, much of Volta plods. Insulated with samples of running water, long, mournful horns, and gently plucked pipa, ""I See Who You Are"" is a tranquil lullaby without much of a melody at all. ""Vertebrae by Vertebrae"" rests on a looped horn sample not far from Peter Thomas' ""Bolero on the Moon Rocks"" (sampled by Pulp on ""This Is Hardcore""), but  Björk can't take it anywhere, instead filling its five minutes with runs from her catalog of preferred vocal shorthand scribbles. On the heels of those two songs, the rhythmless ""Pneumonia""-- which finds Björk utterly adrift melodically-- is an even harder sell. There are, of course, a handful of lovely parts as well. While I have problems with the way ""Earth Intruders"" sounds-- muddy, clunky, overcompressed, and not nearly as aerodynamic as you'd expect a Björk/Timbaland track to sound-- its charm comes through with time. With lyrics pulled from a Russian poem made popular by Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (how's that for pop!) and regal, curling horns reminiscent of the crescendoing strings in Henryk Gorecki's 3rd Symphony (uh, ditto), the 7½-minute Björk/Antony duet ""The Dull Flame of Desire"" is a darkly elegant setpiece that beautifully showcases both voices. Ultimately, though, it's the industrial jackhammering of ""Declare Independence"" that steals the show. Built around a wriggling synth lead, some brash EQing, and white-hot swaths of digital noise, it's a gloriously messy few minutes-- one of her most transcendent tracks to date. In the end, though, those golden moments are too few and far between, and the slow, unfurling, lingering moments too long. If the critical and fan response to this album reflects that of the fascinatingly eccentric (but largely maligned) Medúlla, I'll be curious to see how she responds. Until then, Volta is mostly proof that Björk is as fallible as the messy, unpredictable humanity she celebrates, and that even her definition of ""pop"" is avant-garde.","Far from the accessible pop record it's been touted as, the iconoclastic singer's latest outing rarely revisits the celebratory spirit of its first single, despite welcome guest spots from Timbaland, Antony, Lightning Bolt drummer Brian Chippendale, and Konono No. 1, among others.

Solace in Sore Hands,Amandine,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0399d034d5c69bf4836/1:1/w_160/b318ef97.jpg,2007-05-07 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10158-solace-in-sore-hands/,Fat Cat,"Amandine is a geographical conundrum. Start with their second LP, Solace in Sore Hands, and try to pick the region of the American mainland Amandine calls home. Opener ""Faintest of Sparks""-- with its sinister banjo rail and hard-lined persistence that together recall the ""The House Carpenter""-- makes its writer seem like a Southeastern Americana immigrant, moving somewhere in the Appalachians on the heels of a bitter breakup and an introduction to Harry Smith. But then there's the earthen imagery of ""Better Soil"" and its major-chord acoustic jangle, bolstered by a maladjusted fiddle and clanging piano. Mellencamp is from Bloomington, right, and that place is an indie rock nexus? But so are Athens and Seattle, and ""Silver Bells"", all strident strum and stuttering drums, makes Amandine sound like it spent half a decade camping with the Shins outside of Sub-Pop's window. Here's something surprising, though: Amandine is a four-piece from the Southern tip of Sweden, and they're fronted by Olof Gidlöf. Not John, James, Sam, or Joe-- Olof. And as charming as it may seem in theory for a band to explore the connections between American roots music and its Scandinavian counterpart, Amandine does so without a strong sense of self. Solace in Sore Hands sounds exactly like another faceless album about distance putting pressure on stretched heartstrings. Gildöf occasionally seems optimistic for his future, but his misery and the circumstances he laments-- war, small towns, traveling careers-- are his preferred muses. In one sense, this resembles the approach of the band's 2004 debut Leave Out the Sad Parts, but, sonically, Amandine is bigger now. There's a tightly controlled veil of electric feedback on ""Faintest of Sparks"", and ""Our Nameless Will"" splits its choruses and verses between plucked banjo and overdriven guitar paired with big, languid rock drums and bass, respectively. By those terms, though, every piece of Amandine's discography has hitherto been only another point in making Gidlöf's laments a little more dramatic, a little bit louder. Such excuses only go so far, and here, regardless of the band's past, the climaxes and crescendos are rushed, pre-emptive, and undeserved. On ""Chores of the Heart"", Amandine goes straight for the throat, springing from a one-guitar, 35-second intro into a loud first verse, complete with a plodding rhythm section and a howling organ. But there's little other excitability. Still, the guitar somehow manages to believe Gidlöf when he concludes, ""We've been wading in water so dark/ Now we're drowning in the chores of the heart."" Gidlöf is writing about the same motif of impending heartbreak he's mined for three years now, but he still doesn't own it. David Karsten Daniels, who shares the Fat Cat mantle with Amandine now, has based both of his albums around one breakup: The first, 2004's independently released Angles, was grief-stricken but undecided. It felt as if Daniels was still too sad to make a sustained, articulate statement. But this year's Sharp Teeth was a bold move, its arrangements-- Dixieland funeral marches, distended crescendos, painfully quiet brooding-- proclaiming that Daniels had finally conquered his hurt and used it to his advantage. Gidlöf lacks the conviction to direct his troubles into either strong songs or fodder for his clearly capable band. His three-shades-of-grey writing opens the door for any old arrangement that will do, and the band generally mirrors its principal writer, taking the tired sound that comes with the least resistance.","Second album from Malmö, Sweden's finest Americana band retains its earthen imagery while experimenting with more aggressive sounds.

Despite this phenomenon, Brooklyn's Alex Delivery sounds intent on blowing your mind on their expansive and ambitious debut, even if you're familiar with all their go-to tools and tricks. In many ways, Star Destroyer sounds like prog tailored for a hipster audience that hates nearly everything prog's about (dramatic climaxes, technical proficiency, rich instrumentation), though likes having several chic genres crammed down their throat on nine minute-plus tracks. Furthermore, many of these songs contain a strange blend of aestheticism and ascetism, whether by preemptively deflating a potentially epic melody or shaving down noisy krautrock into harmless laptop pop. Catchy opener ""Komad"", for example, initially extends Sebadoh's lo-fi pop to the same cacophonous degree as Iran's Moon Boys, though midway through transmogrifies into a space-age motorik freakout, its mechanical synths and beeps starkly contrasting frontman Robert Lombardo's all-too-human vocals. Star Destroyer may be a pretty opaque record, particularly on first listen, but its brief flashes of hooks often shine through the murky krautrock and shoegaze. The mild pretentiousness of ""Komad"" comes down to earth on ""Rainbows"", the following track. Canned strings and soothing keyboards compliment Lombardo's serene vocals, unlike other passages on the album where feedback squalls and jarring percussion poke holes in the leading melody. At just over two minutes, ""Scotty"" feels like an insignificant blip sandwiched between two behemoth tracks, though the track's goofy carnival feel provides a much-needed break from the plodding stoicism of Star Destroyer's longer songs. The drastic shift from tight and catchy to protracted and cerebral is easily Star Destroyer's most frustrating characteristic. While the binary works on a song like ""Komad"", other lengthy tracks like ""Sheath-Wet"" and ""Milan"" fail to create stylistically disparate sections that are equally interesting, degenerating instead into repetitive jams that never quite jell. This is not a plea for catchier songs, either, but rather for more ear-grabbing ideas that can unfold over a nine-minute track coherently. Thankfully, these guys show a glimpse of that promise with closer ""Vesna"", an intergalactic ballad reminiscent of David Bowie's Berlin albums. As their gorgeous impressionistic album art indicates, Alex Delivery loves revealing pretty ideas at obtuse angles, always wary of cheapening their songs with direct, straightforward hooks. Even more promising, they clearly have the encyclopedic musical knowledge and sonic mastery to craft an album that both borrows from their influences and puts a unique, innovative spin on them. For now, however, Alex Delivery's got a bit of a mad scientist streak, still searching for some method to their madness.","Brooklyn-based Jagjaguwar band's ambitious debut sounds like hipster prog that ignores nearly everything prog's about (dramatic climaxes, technical proficiency, rich instrumentation).

Imagine Our Love,Lavender Diamond,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06c13d197565213a47b/1:1/w_160/e3f7f2b6.jpg,2007-05-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10203-imagine-our-love/,Matador,"There are plenty of reasons to write off Lavender Diamond as intolerably precious: their bandname, their showtune-like arrangements and vocals, or frontwoman Becky Stark's billowy pink dresses that make comparisons to Princess Toadstool just slightly too easy. To date, the band's most excessive gestures have been their most successful. The recently re-released Cavalry of Light EP reaches its apex with its opening track: ""You Broke My Heart"" is a bulletproof wide-eyed stomper that embraces the band's potentially cloying approach with gusto. Until now, Lavender Diamond had struck me as a band willing to plunge unreservedly into its own aesthetic world-- to embrace theatrical bombast without stopping to look over its shoulder. But with the release of their debut album, there's already some speculation as to whether Stark's fruity delivery can be chalked up to genuine eccentricity or art-school put-on. Of course, any kind of wink-and-nod assurances that Lavender Diamond are ""in"" on their own shtick would have destroyed their mystique. And similarly, any attempts to temper their sound with rote signifiers of sincerity would have stripped them of the persuasive charm that made their EP so promising. Miraculously, Lavender Diamond manage to evade both of these traps on Imagine Our Love. But there's a potentially bigger problem: Rather than developing or disavowing their penchant for glittery spectacle, they play it just a little bit too safe throughout, delivering a record with few glaring flaws but just as few highlights. ""You Broke My Heart"" finds its near-equal in ""Open Your Heart"", bringing to mind what ""Downtown"" might sound like had it originally been performed by Julie Andrews instead of Petula Clark. The melody and flow of ""Here Comes One"" has a ""Sesame Street Theme""-like irresistibility . ""Like an Arrow"" is less melodic and more meditative, but manages to cultivate a mood without falling back on sheer ambiance. But there isn't much else of note beyond these few moments. Stripped-down, bluesier numbers like ""Side of the Lord"" and ""Garden Rose"" offer a welcome respite from the record's usual pageantry, but the subtlety and repetition that enhance Lavender Diamond's best songs also doom these weaker ones. Most of the hooks on Imagine Our Love appear within the first 30 seconds of their respective songs, and when that initial idea needs work, as is often the case, its gradual development and expansion doesn't exactly make for an enthralling listen. Given the amount of attention Lavender Diamond has received lately, it's easy to forget that this is their debut album. Though ""You Broke My Heart"" made for an incredibly solid and self-assured first step, Imagine Our Love finds the band not quite sure how to deliver on their strengths. Which, for all the hype and expectation, is hardly the worst that could happen.","Becky Stark and the rest of her Matador band finally follow their reputation-making Cavalry of Light EP with their debut album.

"Icons, Abstract Thee EP",Of Montreal,by: Rob Mitchum,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05db1335d7bf169a0e0/1:1/w_160/5f97497d.jpg,2007-05-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10189-icons-abstract-thee-ep/,Polyvinyl,"Fickle sadists that we are, we want our artists to lay their suffering out for us without being, you know, too emo-obvious about it. So even though Of Montreal's Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? leads off with the thesis statement ""we just want to emote 'til we're dead,"" we find ourselves too distracted by the shiny synthesizer baubles and merrily chugging machine rhythms to immediately pick up on the record's gloomy words and themes. By the time we realize the record is an auditory record-keeping of Kevin Barnes' marital and psychiatric struggles, the hooks are already sunk and we're singing along to his pain and agony, and feeling really good and terrible about it. You'd think that trick wouldn't work again, that the bite-size format of Hissing Fauna's sister EP, Icons Abstract Thee, would be an easier and happier pill to swallow. Wrong. Rather than cobbling together the chaff from Hissing Fauna, it's more like a condensed version-- the Reader's Digest summary of its parent album's themes and sound. In this highly concentrated form, Kevin Barnes' romantic anguish is even more difficult to voyeurize. Bearing in mind that the record is only 20 minutes long, there's a disturbingly high proportion of dear-diary lyrics dripping with self-loathing and anger: ""Every thing is in the trash, and it's my fault/ I destroyed us, I know, it's unrecoverable"" ""I am a flaw/ I'm a mistake/ I am faulty/ Always break"" ""My heart is juvenile/ And my character's not so hot"" ""Please don't lose any sleep over me/ Baby, I hardly exist"" ""Is happiness even possible?"" ""Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself"" ""I lost so much in our collapse/ Now my only hope is gone"" ""I'm killing myself, but it's not suicide"" ""I never ever wanted to write this song/ I always thought things would change somehow/ And we would start getting along/ But it's hopelesssss"" (italics for multi-Barnes overdub emphasis) Yikes. But like Hissing Fauna before it, Barnes' bitter self-reflection is largely surrounded by a candied sugar shell, the same techno-updated hyper-pop the group is known for. Opening track ""Du Og Meg"", in fact, is probably closer to Of Montreal's early sound than anything on Hissing Fauna; its sunny guitar riffs and horn-section breakdown are vintage Elephant 6, and only the drum programming dispels the throwback illusion. A fairytale retelling of Barnes meeting his wife abroad, bringing her on tour to hock merch, and eventually proposing, the song's innocence also recalls the group's more romantic days, songs in love with love like Coquelicot's gorgeous ""It's Just So"". But this moment of fleeting happiness is just a cruel setup by narrator Barnes, and the rest of the EP is a headlong descent into DSM-IV depression. ""Voltaic Crusher"" is a peppy number more in line with the band's current synth-pop leanings, a busy rhythm track underscoring a melody competition between bass, guitar, and keyboards as Barnes pleads with God to send his wife a better man than him. ""Derailments in a Place of Our Own"" and ""Miss Blonde Your Papa Is Failing"" come closer to the sad-sack approach the band has astutely avoided, both largely solo acoustic tracks lacking the giddy complexity of the Hissing Fauna material, the arrangements trading gleeful escapism for seething anger and fragile honesty. These stripped-down tracks are just a mellow calm before the climactic storm of ""No Conclusion"", the most ambitious and breathtaking portion of Barnes' pop opera of depression and despair. Consisting of roughly five songs sutured together Fiery Furnaces-style, ""No Conclusion"" is among the most complexly catchy contemplations of suicide ever committed to tape. Here, Barnes doesn't attempt to even flimsily cloak his feelings, going so far as to address himself by name within the song (""Don't worry, Kevin""), while the music hops maniacally from idea to idea behind him. The track is filled with meta-moments, most blatantly the two instances when Barnes mentions ""repeating"" before a multi-track loop is triggered; a clever joke, until the sad realization that there's not even a band present to share his pain, just a computer running Reason. By the end, Barnes reaches his most desperate point (see #9 above) and loops it relentlessly like self-flagellation...until a mournful string section echoing the chord progression gently ushers him off-stage. Those 10 minutes of music make Icons, Abstract Thee worthwhile all by themselves; after all, it is half the EP's running time, and will likely end up as one of 2007's finest musical accomplishments. It's a worthy final sequence to the saga that Hissing Fauna and Icons, Abstract Thee comprise, bravely integrating real-world emotion into Of Montreal's cartoonishly sugar-high sound while the band finishes its metamorphosis into a more electronics-based state. It's enough of an achievement that we can forgive being seduced by Barnes' pop talents into dancing to his anguish; let's just hope he has happier experiences to report on next time around.","Rather than coming across like a set of castoffs from this year's outstanding Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, this tour EP instead reads like the condensed version of its parent album's themes and sound.

Mosaic,Love of Diagrams,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24e13d197565213883c/1:1/w_160/9ddcfded.jpg,2007-05-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10185-mosaic/,Matador,"No wave and post-punk were cousins in sound and philosophy, disaffected soundtracks for disaffected youth on both sides of the Atlantic. Recently signed to Matador, the Melbourne trio Love of Diagrams invoke this moment of revolt on Mosaic, their full-length debut. With mad scientific precision, they clone that factory-town aura of blankness and unrest, as well as the bohemian suspicions of structure and prettiness for its own sake. This may as wel be a love letter to 1978. It might also have been a mere period piece, but every detail is emotionally spot-on, a lovingly crafted balance of fury and malaise. Even Love of Diagrams' bare-bones palette looks like a reaction to Thatcher-era excess. Opener ""Form and Function"" reveals a simple blueprint: nervous drumming from Monika Fikerle, low-frequency ennui from bassist Antonia Sellbach, all mantled by Luke Horton's guitarwork. After 2003's The Target Is You-- their wordless, Sonic Youth-inflected debut-- Horton and Sellbach proved they could do a great Thurston and Kim, too. Yet on its own, Sellbach's deadpan witch-chant calls to mind Siouxsie Sioux, or the other Kim. There's this classic, spellbinding hollowness to it. And it works its magic on ""Pace or the Patience"", which zips from earthbound dub to a passage of chiming lightness before reverting, inevitably, back to Sellbach's wistful indictments: ""You came in with flying colors."" Meanwhile Horton, tired of pleasantries, yells past her, ""Well, can I give it to you?"" There are a million ways this can be protest song, and a million it can't. In ""At 100%"" it could go either way, too: the steely jerk and winking corporate-speak could pass as an attack on the workplace, modern love, or, what the hell, modern love in the workplace. Better not to know. They are usually going so fast, riding their hurried Krautrock rhythms, they almost race past any stable meanings. But when they downshift to slower tempos, they tumble clearly from outrage to resignation. Somewhere under the sludge of ""Ms V Export"", you suspect, lurks a pop song, all the balladry filtered through Sellbach's robotic delivery. You can hear more notes of defeat, but in the coiled-spring, Devoesque ""Confrontation"", the hope drowns it out. Granted, historical accuracy has its downside. No wave and post-punk came from cold places, after all, and for every lightning-flash of dark and dissonant drama, there were untold stretches of dreary, bloodless austerity. Love of Diagrams undoubtedly realize this. They have learned from their forebears' mistakes, keeping Mosaic predictably terse and tense, but they achieve something else: a strange spartan beauty, full of listlessness and all kinds of longing.",,7.6,
Let's Just Be,Joseph Arthur,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0419d034d5c69bf4849/1:1/w_160/aeda3cce.jpg,2007-05-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10165-lets-just-be/,Lonely Astronaut,"Joseph Arthur has about as much freedom as a musician can get. He has his own studio, owns his own record label, and has a backing band on call whenever he needs them. Let his sixth album then stand as a reminder that, sometimes, freedom isn't a good thing. Let's Just Be sounds like it came together on the fly, in jam sessions that didn't stem from any kind of solid idea. There are moments on the album that left me speechless the first time I heard them. I just don't think I was properly equipped to process the precipitous drop in quality between Joseph Arthur's past offerings and this one. Arthur peaked in 2004 with Our Shadows Will Remain, a lucid, occasionally even ingenious meditation on living in a time of war. But here it's difficult to find any focus. Moreover, Arthur's tendency toward experimentation seems to have devolved to rote sonic noodling that goes nowhere. There are a few quality tracks among these 16-- enough for a pretty good EP-- but this is an 80-minute album with at least an hour of stuff on it that sounds at best like studio outtakes. I can get behind the gentle acoustics and subtle electronic shading of ""Take Me Home"", for instance-- it has a fragile beauty that echoes some of his best quiet work for Real World and Vector. The album's nine-minute finale, ""Star Song"", has some of that as well, combining an American roots aesthetic with some vaguely South Asian overtones, harmonica rubbing up against guitars tuned and processed to sound like sitars. It's startling to hear something so interesting and affecting close out a record like this, and it at least leaves some hope that this is merely a short detour in Arthur's career and not a sign of things to come. Beyond those songs, though, there's not much. ""Lonely Astronaut"", the album's 20-minute centerpiece, begins on reasonably solid ground, with acoustic guitars strumming away, but Arthur's gravelly voice sounds like it doesn't even know the lyrics and he falls way down in the mix. After a certain point it just wanders off into a hideously boring vamp with sounds randomly rising and falling as voices repeat single syllables over and over but not in any particular pattern or rhythm. Listening to the whole thing, which I've done several times now, is genuinely grueling. It's exhibit A in the argument that having 80 minutes available on a CD doesn't mean you have to fill it. Other songs are terrible for more pedestrian reasons. He sounds more like he's puking than singing as he screeches his way through ""Cockteeze"" over lumbering, sloppy riff rock, but it's not nearly as horrendous as ""Shake It Off"", where he sounds like he's trying to imitate first an eagle and then a sheep as he vocalizes the title refrain. It might be a joke, but if you weren't in the studio when it was recorded, it's not very funny. The next song is unironically titled ""Lack a Vision"", and though it's merely boring and not outright bad, it's truly an unfortunate phrase to have on the album's back cover. There's plenty of evidence outside of the general sloppiness of the playing and forced-sounding ""out there"" production that this was kicked together in great haste: witness Arthur instructing the band on the form of the song in the middle of the already rehearsal-ish ""Yer the Reason"". He could have at least overdubbed the planned solo he mumbles about. It's almost disappointing that there's any good music on this thing, because the bits he seems to really be engaged with, like the faux-country of ""Precious One"" or the folky ""Gimmie Some Company"", are bound to be lost along with the rest of it, much of which is simply unendurable. Here's hoping he got it out of his system.","The singer-songwriter follows 2004's Our Shadows Will Remain-- a lucid meditation on living in a time of war-- and 2006's Nuclear Daydream with a much less-focused effort.

Little Pop Rock,Sister Vanilla,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03fea9e61561daa65c1/1:1/w_160/00314c7e.jpg,2007-05-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10163-little-pop-rock/,Chemikal Underground,"As the 2007 concert calendar has shown, any group of geezers can reunite if the price is right. But the Jesus and Mary Chain's Jim and William Reid and Ben Lurie are the only ones who can claim to be reuniting twice. However, if they did Coachella for the money, then their other recent venture-- backing up the youngest Reid sibling, Linda, in Sister Vanilla-- appears to be for the love. Or, at least, their participation suggests a token gesture of gratitude to the one person who can probably keep the two brothers from kicking the shit out of each other. Though Little Pop Rock is Sister Vanilla's first album, the lineup effectively formed on the Mary Chain's 1998 swan song Munki, on which Linda lent her pretty-vacant vocals to the revved-up Ramones pastiche ""Mo Tucker"", a sprightly performance that contrasted sharply with the femme-fatale cameos the band routinely farmed out to Hope Sandoval. Nine years later, this enthusiasm appears unabated on Little Pop Rock, on which Linda sings with the wide-eyed wonder of a fan girl who gets to front her favorite band: ""Honey's Dead and Psychocandy, I listened to them all the time,"" she sings on ""K to Be Lost"", her sense of awe undiminished by the fact she's related to the guys who made them. As it's genetically impossible for the Reid clan to sound like anything other than the Jesus and Mary Chain, it's no surprise that Little Pop Rock's acid-casual serenades-- centered primarily on the symbiotic relationship between getting high and feeling low-- could've featured on any Mary Chain album from Darklands onward. And that's a comment on both the songs' lack of deviation from the JAMC's Sunday-morning-Velvets songbook, and the songs' consistent quality and unhurried charm. But the steady, metronomic nature of rockers like ""Jamcolas"" (just like the title says: the JAMC gone pop) and the cheeky Let It Bleed tribute ""Delicat"" is undercut by a more free-spirited approach to the album's quieter moments, like the casually anarchic piano plinking that closes the opening ""Pastel Blue"", a gentle acoustic lullaby wherein Linda recounts a car crash caused by her zoning out to the Pastels. How appropriate then that Little Pop Rock comes full circle with ""The Two of Us"", a closing Stephen Pastel duet powered by an inviting Stereolab drone that provides the proverbial exclamation point to a mutually beneficial family affair: The sister gets to live out her indie rock fantasy, while her brothers are given the opportunity to come back stoned and re-throned.","Jesus and Mary Chain's Jim and William Reid back up their younger sibling, Linda, on this album of metronomic pop and unhurried charms.

Ola Podrida,Ola Podrida,by: Stephen M.

He is a film composer by day, most notably for the movies of southern director David Gordon Green (including his upcoming Snow Angels), and this experience may or may not be relevant to his debut with his band Ola Podrida. It's tempting to read these 11 songs on the group's debut as extensions of Wingo's soundtracks, as the band name implies: Ola Podrida is a variation on the Spanish term olla podrida, which refers specifically to a stew and generally to any sort of miscellany. Podrida itself means rotten, suggesting a dish made of ingredients unused in previous recipes. The implication is that this group is a secondary outlet for Wingo and the album a catch-all for mood-setting music that didn't fit into a film. If that's really the case, it's impossible to tell. Ola Podrida is a cohesive, confident album full of folky, quiet guitars and thoughtful lyrics that coalesce into complete songs. But what sets the group apart from similar acts like Iron & Wine and Paul Duncan is its cinematic flair: Wingo treats his words like images, so that the music acts like a soundtrack that gently reinforces their meaning and impact. These songs are like short films-- action sequences (the fiery ""Cindy""), montages (the humorous ""Photo Booth""), denouements (the stark closer ""Eastbound"")-- but the band's spartan sound never makes that idea too obvious. Ola Podrida, which began with Wingo as its sole member but has grown to a full lineup, make the most of only a handful of instruments: Acoustic guitars pluck ruminative melodies while synths softly suggest atmosphere. Singing with an open twang that sounds both observant and expressive, Wingo performs most songs by himself, even playing piano on ""Eastbound"". Appropriately, Wingo's lyrics emphasize the visual, and his songs are full of off-hand concrete imagery, such as these lines from ""Day at the Beach"": ""I played in the waves like a five-year old, timing my jumps with the rolling tide"". However, the songs are most effective when he leaves certain specifics to the listener's imagination. In the middle of the plaintive ""Run Off the Road"", in which a woman gauges her life's course through the changes in her old home, he sings, ""When you showed up at the farm, visions of the summer flying past you/ The foxes had torn up the mother and her pups, and the well was full of flies."" The violence occurs off-screen, but its aftermath lingers in this southern gothic quatrain, feeding the song's meaning and mystery. All is not so bleak. ""Photo Booth"", about lovers slowly growing apart, repeats a playful refrain: ""Dog's asleep out in the yard, cat's up on the roof/ We're out drinking at the bar, down each other's pants in the photo booth."" Wingo's characters-- all of the lovers, friends, acquaintances, passers-by who inhabit these songs-- hover teasingly between real and fictional, suggesting typical songwriterly confessionalism but slyly undermining those expectations. For this reason, ""Jordanna"" is one of the album's many triumphs, showcasing not only Wingo's shapeshifting songwriting (in which verses bleed into choruses with such fluidity that it's often difficult to distinguish the two) but also his descriptive powers. The song is an ode to a powerful performer, and the words and music give listeners front-row seats: ""You drink from your flask and ask if anyone here has a favorite,"" he sings, then adds, ""I don't care what you play, just do it in your old fashioned way."" Wingo sounds like he wants to believe in the power of music to set the world to rights, and on ""Jordanna"" he comes away with what seems at first like cold comfort, but reveals a musical generosity that's almost like a mission statement: ""I don't know if there's any point to it all, but I sure like hearing your voice.""","Film composer David Wingo-- best known for his work with director David Gordon Green-- helmed this cohesive, confident album full of folky, quiet guitars and thoughtful lyrics that coalesce into complete songs.

Quique: Redux Edition,Seefeel,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af89c0084474cd0c1ab9/1:1/w_160/3c2d9f64.jpg,2007-05-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9993-quique-redux-edition/,Too Pure,"Being an early 1990s shoegaze band whose big claim to fame is that they ""went electronic,"" it's impossible to talk about Seefeel without also talking about technology. On Seefeel's MySpace page, there's live footage of ""Industrious""-- from their 1993 album Quique-- at a Russian festival in '94. The band doesn't quite stand still; bassist Darren Seymour does some kind of spastic dance during the bridge. But something about the basic immobility of the band-- attempting to recreate its pulsing, programmed loops live on stage, a music that pours My Bloody Valentine's oozing pink and purple plasma onto techno's chrome skeleton-- is tied to a long-gone age of implacable MIDI-sequencing, lacking the real-time software flux available to Christian Fennesz or the freedom of movement enjoyed by modern cyborg bands like Battles. But only a maniac would claim that Kraftwerk's neon lights shine any less brightly because they didn't have Ableton Live, and Seefeel's music continues to sparkle 14 years later, an entire generation having built an ambient-motorik noise-pop aesthetic around Quique songs like ""Plainsong"". Too Pure finally brings the album back into print after far too long with this double-disc ""Redux Edition"", and listening now, you'll hear the beginnings of a still-thriving genre that remains slippery and unnamed, purely electronic music with a strange, tangy rock aftertaste-- think Tim Hecker's own post-shoegaze explorations into ultra-violet noise, Nathan Fake's plastic techno My Bloody Valentine homages, M83's heavily sequenced Vangeliscapes, a good chunk of the Darla Records catalog, and the twinkling textures of Mouse on Mars, who sent Too Pure a mash note with their demo after they had become infatuated with Quique. Even starting out in a genre where texture and noise already did much of the heavy lifting, the ""rock band"" version of Seefeel was just a shadow on the studio wall by the time of Quique, making it kind of proto-IDM before the genre even really had a name. And in this rock-free space, the eight minutes of opener ""Climatic Phase No. 3"" actually sound like ""Comedown Phase No. 3"". It's just the barest tinkling of percussion, a rising and falling bass line to provide a barely audible pulse guiding the track, and the laziest melody Kevin Shields or Robin Guthrie never wrote. Not afraid to name a song ""Spangle"", that most overused of adjectives when it comes to post-Cocteau Twins' guitar atmospherics, Seefeel's canvas on Quique was the azure 8-bit horizon of a computer game where the band blew pixilated clouds that spritzed digital mist and crafted minimal hooks from just hypnotic smears of faraway feedback and Sarah Peacock's nape-of-your-neck intimate whispers. Needless to say, if Seefeel's pace gets to, say, mid-tempo, the band's pretty damn worked up. The songs stretch out like groggy limbs after a mid-day nap, and the band is often at its best when it's at its most languid, as on the impossibly sensual and nearly static ""Filter Dub"". The underrated, understated rhythm work--rarely brought up when critics like me start talking alliterative nonsense about vapor trails and guitar swooshes--scrapes and pulses more than it pounds or strides, often recalling a stiff Kraftwerkian metal-on-metal version of polyrhythmic sway of Polynesian percussion. The silvery splash of the cymbals on ""Industrious"" is just another harmonic color in the palette; the chittering ""Through You"" sounds like gamelan recast with Atari-era tools. In the band's attempt escape rock's orbit, the second disc of nine unreleased tracks and rare cuts melts any remaining physicality away until all that's left is, as the band titles the last track, a ""Silent Pool"", even removing most of the ""techno"" from ""ambient techno."" The ""avant garde"" mix of ""Charlotte's Mouth"" mutes the original's percussion until it's the spectral, washed-out blur of an underdeveloped Polaroid, and the eerie ""My Super 20"" blows barren winds as cold the bleakest tracks on AFX's Selected Ambient Works II or the arctic static of Thomas Koner. Moving to labels like Warp and Rephlex and exploring a more purely electronic sound--guitarist Mark Clifford went on to a long and fruitful techno career as Disjecta and other pseudonyms--was perhaps Seefeel's only option as they forced a rock/techno fusion that the technology of the time couldn't quite accommodate. But while it would have undoubtedly been interesting to see where the band might have gone in the anything-goes laptop age, Quique still sounds timeless.","One of the key 1990s ""Lost Generation"" UK post-rock bands gets a 2xCD reissue of its masterful debut album.

Nadel relates an anecdote that seems too perfectly symbolic to be true: A teenaged Cohen, after reading a book on hypnotism, successfully hypnotizes and undresses the family maid. This is the stuff of parable, presaging the hands-on mysticism, conflicted morality, and voracious lust that would come to define Cohen's art. The story also speaks to the peculiar effect of his music-- few singers leave us feeling so mesmerized and vulnerable. On paper, Cohen's music is astoundingly simple. Because he became well-known as a poet and novelist in his 20s, there's a popular misconception that he didn't begin to play music until he started releasing albums in his 30s. But he became infatuated with the guitar at an early age, played in a country band called the Buckskin Boys at McGill University, and accompanied his poetry readings with live jazz, inspired by the Beat poets for whom he was a little too aristocratic to be taken seriously. He didn't become known as a musician until his 30s, but he was moving toward it his whole life, in an attempt to put his poetry where he thought it belonged-- with the people, not the academy. Because of this long gestation period, Cohen's music seemed to emerge fully formed, and the qualities that dominate his first three, newly reissued albums can be succinctly cataloged. There's his reedy baritone-- a humble, melancholy instrument and an inviting source of warmth; there's his unique guitar style-- most of his songs are built from delicate webs of musky, finger-picked flamenco or broad, awkward chord progressions; and there are his lyrics, tracing out the hidden contours of love, lust, sex, religion, responsibility, and history through an inflexibly personal lens. There's also the uncanny ambiance of the songs, the almost brutal frugality of which is offset by calliope, bells, keyboards, strings, horns, and Jew's harp. While Cohen was resistant to such embellishments and particularly displeased with John Simon's arrangements on his debut, they've worn into the songs' creases. These reissues do a good job of bringing out the instrumentation without crowding Cohen's voice or tainting the music's dark thrall, and an early version included on Songs from a Room reveals that ""Bird on a Wire"" isn't quite ""Bird on a Wire"" without those drafty keyboards pushing in under it. This is enough to explain why these albums are good, but what makes them great is the ongoing search for personal truth and spiritual grace that they express, and how they manage to always embody both sides of their thematic coin. Everything is married to its dark twin: Freedom and shelter in ""The Stranger Song"", laughter and tears in ""So Long, Marianne"", salvation and destruction in ""Joan of Arc"", whom Cohen often used as a symbol for spiritual discipline and the power of womanhood. We find this same dual nature in Cohen himself: Born to a stern religious father and a bohemian mother, Cohen's sensibility was forged in the tension between the liberal and the conservative. He's been a religious sensualist, a student of police work and law, bourgeois outsider poet, and disciplined dabbler in marijuana and LSD. While he emerged as a Dylan-inspired folkie, his music was anachronistic and only nominally political, less concerned with the timely issues of the day than the timeless issues of the spirit. Cohen was interested in ""The Old Revolution"", with its outmoded concepts of chivalry, and its religious (not secular) imperatives. The political ferment of the 60s manifests only obliquely, as in ""Story of Isaac"", which is as much about Cohen's awe of his father's stern religion as it is about the sacrifice of youths upon the altar of war. It's appropriate then that Cohen's songs present him to us in far-flung locales. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" finds him in a cold New York hotel, catching snippets of music wafting up from Clinton Street. In ""So Long, Marianne"", he's probably on Hydra, a pale spectre amid the Grecian island's greenery and whitewashed terraces. In ""Suzanne"", eating Chinese oranges on the St. Lawrence river in Montreal. In ""Diamonds in the Mine"", checking his empty mailbox on an isolated farm outside of Nashville. All three of these albums, despite their musical simplicity, are leavened with the wisdom that comes from such a diverse existence. 1968's Songs of Leonard Cohen contains many of his most essential songs-- ""Suzanne"", ""Master Song"", ""Stranger Song"", ""Sisters of Mercy"", ""So Long, Marianne""-- and establishes the themes and stylistic tics he would pursue relentlessly over the ensuing decades. John Hammond, the album's original producer, fell ill during the process and was replaced by John Simon; the two bonus cuts are from the Hammond sessions. ""Store Room"" emulates the restrained urgency of ""Teachers"" while ""Blessed is the Memory"" is more prayerful; both feature rather incongruous Ray Manzarek-style organs. A long-time country music fan, Cohen would travel to Nashville to record his next two albums. 1969's Songs From a Room is similar to his debut: Just as Songs of Leonard Cohen replaced original producer John Hammond, who had signed Cohen to Columbia (as well as Billie Holiday and Bob Dylan) with John Simon (then just off the Band's Music From Big Pink and Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends), this album was started with the Byrds' David Crosby and finished with Dylan producer Bob Johnston. It also contains a number of Cohen's signature tunes, including ""Story of Isaac"", cover song ""The Partisan"", ""Lady Midnight"", and the seminal ""Bird on a Wire"", whose iconic opening lines (""Like a bird on a wire/ Like a drunk in a midnight choir/ I have tried, in my way, to be free"") were cited by Kris Kristofferson as his desired epitaph. It seems a direct continuation of his debut, and in truth, the debut seems superior simply for having come first. Of course, any seeker can become lost, and on 1971's Songs of Love and Hate, Cohen shows signs of disorientation. Though he's backed by a crew of ace musicians, including Charlie Daniels on fiddle, the record is thinner and less even than the first two. In contrast to his early precision, Cohen takes some wild swings that miss the mark, such as the weird Santa Claus imagery on ""Dress Rehearsal Rag"" and the uncomfortably strained singing style he adopts on ""Diamonds in the Mine"", which might be chalked up to an insecurity about his voice encouraged by his negative press. It's also a more blatantly depressive album than the first two, lacking hopeful equanimity, and does indeed reflect a period of great depression and uncertainty in Cohen's life. But elsewhere on Love and Hate, he's in his finest, subtlest form-- ""Avalanche"", ""Last Year's Man"", and ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" alone justify the album's classic status. Despite its relative flaws, it's an indispensable document in the development of one of the 20th century's most enduring artists. Cohen potently captures the pull between safety and the unknown, love and freedom, spirituality and sensuality: a panoramic view of human experience, rendered through the work of one exceptional artist.","Legacy reissues the first three albums from the legendary singer-songwriter, adding a few bonus cuts in the process.

Lynn Teeter Flower,Maria Taylor,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b046ea9e61561daa65cd/1:1/w_160/649483ad.jpg,2007-05-03 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10169-lynn-teeter-flower/,Saddle Creek,"The last time Maria Taylor released an album, Pitchfork was in a zingy sort of mood, classifying her ""somber, gooey"" efforts as the sort of stuff you'd see abetting some tender & verbose moment from ""Gilmore Girls"". Two years later, and her latest offering of somber goo finds itself stuck in the middle of poignant scenes from a slightly more popular television drama, ""Grey's Anatomy"". A recent episode actually utilized two tracks from Lynn Teeter Flower. ""Clean Getaway"", featuring Taylor's frail croak and the sparse acoustic veneer listeners come to expect from her work, was a perfect fit for its associated scenes of antiseptic regret and recrimination. The full-rock-band moves of ""Good Start"", on the other hand, clash with the poignant moments it was meant to soundtrack, just as Taylor's sad-sack ruminations on the track slap clumsily against the instrumentation that tries its best to coax some catchiness from the song's melody. It's hard to keep toes tapping, though, when you sound like Eeyore's mother on an ether binge. Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of Taylor's first album, then you're going to find similar stuff on Flower. Whether she's giving the rhythm section a cigarette break, trying to approximate the sound of an anesthetized New Pornographers, or adding the same sort of pseudo-dancey Casio flourishes that have colored her work since the first Azure Ray album, Taylor never fails to instill the same sense of inescapable inertia throughout. Unless you're drinking gallons of the street team Kool-Aid, repeated exposure will only make each subsequent listen even more of a chore, and whatever charms her music might possess get washed away. A voice that might sound haunting or weary in a charming fashion at first quickly becomes a mewling sigh afraid of its own volume. Her melodic knack is apparent, but there's only so much morose mid-tempo pop one can take, and it'll take a lot more than a fleeting dalliance with some Mellotrons to cover that up. Once upon a time, this sort of bait-and-switch was accomplished thanks to her Azure Ray partner, Orenda Fink. As lugubrious as Taylor's music might seem at times, Fink's own despondent dolorous haze made her partner in crime seem like a spastic pixie. Without Fink to play Sadder Cop to Taylor's own Sad Cop, the jig is most definitely up. Given the alternative to the M.O. that's presented on this album, though, I'm all for Taylor turning her modest niche into a shallow grave. ""Irish Goodbye"" presents a peppier version of Taylor's block-rocking beat manifesto, but it gets waylaid by an awful rap (indie style, of course) that would probably turn even the most ardent backpackers against the stuff. If that's what this record could have been, then by all means, Maria, please trot out more deathly songs about clichéd devil dreams and self-recriminating passive-aggressive relationships (and feel free to close with some clip of a younger you singing the name of the album over and over in an awkward and winning fashion). However, if given my druthers, I'd rather have an album full of songs like ""The Ballad of Sean Foley"", Taylor's collaboration with Saddle Creek sugar daddy Conor Oberst. Though Oberst is officially given a co-writing credit, the song's word-per-minute rate, and its folky obsession with naming landmarks and cities, makes me think he should be given at least three-quarters credit. His presence as a back-up singer also flatters the song, as well as Taylor's performance. Taylor doesn't necessarily snap out of the tortoise-like torpor she's painstakingly established throughout this album, but for a few minutes, you can see some light at the end of the tunnel, and imagine what it would sound like if she finally did.","Azure Ray vet and ""Grey's Anatomy"" sweepstakes winner offers another album of morose mid-tempo pop.

Blood Is Clean,Valet,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b035b1335d7bf169a096/1:1/w_160/52a975ea.jpg,2007-05-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10155-blood-is-clean/,Kranky,"The voice and presence of Portland's Honey Owens has a lent a captivating accent to every group she's been involved with, whether it's the dub-inflected Nudge or the roots-centered improv of Jackie-O Motherfucker. For her latest project Valet, however, Owens proceeds alone, shaping her environment with spare, dreamy traces of voice, guitar, and free-spirit drones. On Valet's debut Blood Is Clean, Owens uses her solitude to maximum effect, crafting a singularly hypnotic album that is at once intimate yet deceptively expansive, her every spectral breath and note focused in an uneasy, almost supernatural isolation. Then again, it could be said that perhaps Owens is not quite so alone here as she might first appear, as her stated intention for Valet's work is to operate as a medium, channeling sounds from an unknown realm. And there's no question that Blood Is Clean is charged with a disquieting, otherworldly energy-- even for listeners skeptical of Owens' spiritualist designs. In this regard, Valet bears favorable comparison to such free/drone contemporaries as Charalambides' Christina Carter or Fursaxa's Tara Burke. Yet Owens takes care never to allow any stray loosened spirits to crowd her out completely, and each of these eight pieces is composed and performed in a voice that is wholly and irretrievably her own. To achieve her mystic sound, Owens utilizes a number of subtly variant techniques, but she recorded the bulk of this material in live single takes with few added overdubs. Aside from her distinctive, impressionistic vocals and guitar, many of her other source materials seem deliberately obscure, an ambiguity which contributes directly to the music's unsettling glow. On the opening invocation ""April 6"" she frames her wordless vocals against a shifting backdrop of submerged percussion and winds, granting the performance the clouded perception of some distant, half-remembered ritual. This effect is repeated on ""Mystic Flood"", which draws inspiration from Haitian Voodoo drumming to further its mysterious, almost subliminal pulse. Elsewhere, Owens reluctantly makes a few marginal concessions to more conventional song structure. On the spectacular title track, her molten psych-guitar figures emerge from beneath a dense, virtually motionless bass rumble while she sings ""My blood is clean but the devil's in me"" with a chilling detachment. ""Tame All the Lions"" works a lurching, bone-simple riff into a swirl of wall-rattling distortion, while the potent ""My Volcano"" echoes Loren Mazzacane Connors at his most desolate. Throughout these songs, Owens' vocals remain a familiar yet inscrutable element, her whispery-- and, yes, honeyed-- delivery as seductive as it is vaguely unnerving. As might be expected with music so spontaneously channeled, there are plenty of lulls on Blood Is Clean where apparently the spirits lacked anything fascinating to share. The album closes with ""North"", a 13-minute textured drone that, charming though it is, feels rather lackluster coming on the heels of the rest of the album's spirited, emotive display. These occasional lapses notwithstanding, Blood Is Clean shows Valet to be yet another fruitful project for Honey Owens, whose music evidently rings pure no matter what company she's keeping.","On this solo project, Honey Owens (Jackie-O Motherfucker, Nudge) shapes her solitary environment with spare, dreamy traces of voice, guitar, and free-spirit drones.

Lazarus Beach,Through the Sparks,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b040ea9e61561daa65c5/1:1/w_160/1d49bd49.jpg,2007-05-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10164-lazarus-beach/,Skybucket,"About 10 years ago, around the time Verbena were tipped to be the next Nirvana, there was talk that Birmingham, Alabama, might be the next Seattle. Just like every other next Seattle prediction, it didn't come to pass. Verbena all but vanished, and prognosticators began looking elsewhere for new next Seattles: Williamsburg, Omaha, Montreal, somewhere in North Carolina. Even if it lost that buzz, Birmingham did manage to produce such solid acts as Azure Ray and its solo projects, Louis Schefano (of Regia and Louis), and 13ghosts, and the city continues to cultivate an indie scene centered around clubs like the Bottle Tree. Then there are those two ""American Idol"" winners... just kidding. More recently, this hospitable environment has given us Through the Sparks, a group of childhood friends who pooled all their equipment into the makeshift Alamalibu Studios. Their first full-length, Lazarus Beach, follows their 2005 debut EP, Coin Toss-- both on local Skybucket Records. Like labelmates and fellow Birmingham natives 13ghosts, Through the Sparks favors a slightly ramshackle approach that incorporates disparate styles into a compelling clutter. Lazarus Beach is a sophisticated sprawl of sound and songs, with elements of power pop, 70s singer/songwriter, prog, indie guitar rock, and even some smooth southern soul. The album opens strong with ""L. Roi"", on which Jody Nelson sings about a friend who committed suicide. As a deceptively chirpy six-note melody gently nudges the song along, Nelson sounds like he's struggling to maintain his composure, and just when it sounds like he might lose it, a saxophone comes in from nowhere, offers a few kind words, then ushers the song to its gentle finale, where Stax horns offer comfort. ""L. Roi"" derives its power from its subdued performance-- no ""Black Parade"" hysterics-- and serves as a fine introduction to the band. Such is the gravity of that opener that everything afterwards feels a little frivolous by comparison, but at least Through the Sparks realize that personal loss doesn't make them unique. Instead, they look outward-- way, way outward. ""Mexico (Every Last Buffalo)"", one of many concept-driven songs on Lazarus Beach, considers American imperialism as wanderlust on a grand scale. Decorated with a hint of bossa nova organ and a nervously double-time guitar solo, the lyrical imagery sounds pat, its whimsy a little too forced: ""Please Dianetically explain this urge to roam,"" Nelson sings. ""In the name of Kennedy let's give the moon a mall."" But the slow-building momentum, culminating in Spoon-ish repetitions of ""shake shake it off/ For a second"" (the song's best moment and perhaps the album's), could excuse any sin. Through the Sparks' eclecticism can be exciting as well as a little frustrating, as these songs indulge seemingly every idea that crossed the band members' brains. A short carnival interlude interrupts the otherwise tight ""Falling Out of Favor with the Neighbors"", drawing attention from Nelson's sh-boom-booms on the final chorus. Most of the album's second half sounds discursive and unfocused: The short ""segue"" tracks are intrusive when they actually register with your ear, while songs like the instrumental ""The Smile of Your Shadow"" and ""Only the Messenger"" sacrifice melody for murky atmosphere. Fortunately, these dubious experiments are redeemed by songs like ""Local Moon"", which channels a young Elvis Costello, and ""The Final If and When"" and ""A Natural Machine"", which end Lazarus Beach on a strong note. If digression is a local tendency-- and an admirable one at that-- then Through the Sparks are best when they're most disciplined, when their musical wanderlust doesn't take them too far off track.","Like labelmates and fellow Birmingham natives 13ghosts, this group of childhood friends favors a slightly ramshackle approach that incorporates disparate styles-- power pop, 70s singer/songwriter, prog, indie guitar rock, and even some smooth southern soul-- into a compelling clutter.

Baby 81,Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02cea9e61561daa659f/1:1/w_160/43ac9f1e.jpg,2007-05-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10146-baby-81/,RCA,"If you wanted to make an effective argument in favor of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's career, musical relativism would be the best place to start. There's not much doubt, especially after listening to Baby 81, as to what BRMC does, nor could it be ignored that they do it particularly well. The band's four albums have overtly displayed their method: well-worn rock symbology adorned with modern flair and presented as variations on a common theme. While BRMC's update of one of rock's most lingering yarns (itself never more than a performative construct) can at times feel like a well-executed recipe, it more often comes across as a cold, cynical ploy to revive rock's extended adolescence. Past themes of rebellion, self-empowerment, and rock'n'roll salvation are in full force on their new album, and the mythology that started to pervade rock music after the Summer of Love-- especially the hippie blooze of T. Rex, the Rolling Stones' satanic majesty, and the equally-orchestrated rune-lore of Led Zeppelin-- remain the band's preeminent generic signposts. On their first three records, BRMC's paint-by-numbers psych-blues approach resulted in some pretty good songs. From their 2000 debut, ""Whatever Happened to My Rock 'N Roll"" had the branding power of an Apple ad, but it was fun nonetheless. Take Them On, On Your Own's ""Stop"" was a dude-ish Slider update, and Howl's title track was an effectively whiny, densely engineered blues meditation. There's nothing even remotely as enjoyable on Baby 81, however: The closest they come is the piano-driven ""Window"", which starts promisingly before spinning its wheels for six minutes, and first single ""Weapon of Choice"", which strangely feels like another band imitating the Club. Most unfortunately, Baby furthers the band's ham-handed thematic extractions of evil from the everyday. Love is lethal, women are insidious, sin is everywhere, rock is redemption, you know the drill. For whatever reason, they still think it effective to use ""666"" in a song title, but without any hint of the theatrical appropriation of the beast-sign's former employers. Here, the number's ""conducer"" is some chick, the star of a ""Sympathy for the Devil""-type narrative complete with a ""how do you do"" play on words. The band's more recognizably annoying Harley-revving guitars underscore ""Took Out a Loan"", which uses an empty heart as collateral, ostensibly at the First Bank of Eternal Damnation, and ""Berlin"", a swaggering Bolan rip about a vague search for romantic redemption. The song's refrain expresses Baby's leaden attempt at quasi-political macho vigor: ""Suicide's easy/ What happened to the revolution?"" On the band's MySpace page, Peter Hayes describes the type of empowerment the band strives for on Baby 81: ""Personal revolt. It's gotta start somewhere, and if it ain't on a personal level, it's too easy to beat the crap out of governments with words. Start with yourself and hopefully you get enough people doing it on their own and we can all come together."" With supposedly meaningful songs, however, bands don't get points just for trying, and BRMC's calculated notions of revolution and struggle are vague to the point of meaninglesness, with the clanky effect of a carefully-worded political stump speech. But the group soldiers on, their main weapon a lack of self-awareness disguised as apathetic cool. Despite critics continuing to brazenly compare them to the Jesus and Mary Chain (it's the hairstyle, dudes), the truth is that BRMC is a big, dumb band who writes big, dumb songs, proven by Baby's ""All You Do Is Talk"", which is separated from the Fray by only a few melodramatic degrees. There is nothing inherently bad about over-earnest rock clichés and thuddingly obvious arrangements, and there are quite a few bands who can pull it off very well. But BRMC's problem is that they don't seem to recognize their superficiality and continue to make music with the pose-striking potency of a glossy Budweiser Music sign hanging in a college bar.","Another album of re-heated rock'n'roll cool from the Bay Area trio.

Tears of the Valedictorian,Frog Eyes,by: Carl Wilson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b044c0084474cd0c1bf8/1:1/w_160/e737e161.jpg,2007-05-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10167-tears-of-the-valedictorian/,Absolutely Kosher,"Why is this valedictorian crying? For the classmates he's leaving behind? For that van full of kids who drove drunk into the storm ditch after prom? No, if the speaker is Carey Mercer, who fronts Victoria, B.C.'s Frog Eyes, he's bawling because he's supposed to be an adult now and what's more a man, but there are no men around, only military blowhards, craven merchants, and drunken dads. Frog Eyes have been a band more namechecked than listened to, thanks to now-and-then keyboardist Spencer Krug's other groups (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown), and Mercer's collaboration last year with Krug and Dan Bejar of Destroyer under the guise of Swan Lake. While Mercer shares his friends' elliptical and bombastic rhetoric, he's at once more of an orator and more of a synesthesist, working with smears and splatters more than melodies, and bringing his own fixations. Tears of the Valedictorian is Frog Eyes' first substantial advance since 2003's The Golden River, which was a fanciful songcycle on a backdrop of ecological anxiety. The Folded Palm (2004) approximated the frenzy of their shows, but at the expense of the songs. The intervening mini-albums were pleasant small-scale studies. Valedictorian again mobilizes the band's full palette-- Mercer's wife Melanie Campbell's stomping drums and flat stutter cymbals, Krug's keyboards switching from crosshatch shadows to radiant showers, Michael Rak's grounding bass, Mercer's and McCloud Zicmuse's light-seeking insect guitars and, always, Mercer's gibbering, his croon, his grumbles, his yodeling yip. Mercer stands in the lineage of rock frontman as half-carnival-barker, half-gnostic-preacher that Greil Marcus describes as the ""crank prophet,"" from Screamin' Jay Hawkins through Arthur Lee of Love, Captain Beefheart, David Thomas of Pere Ubu, Tom Waits, and the Pixies' Frank Black. But Frog Eyes' sound owes more to early Roxy Music-- music that filtered out blues in favor of high modernism-- as well as advertising jingles and John Philip Sousa. In keeping with Victoria's Brit-dominated demographics, it also recalls English music hall, though the hall is on a riverboat and the river on fire. Mercer's preoccupation here seems to be masculinity, as it often has been in rock, the music of boys coming of age. But unlike Mick Jagger or Bruce Springsteen (whose trace, as so often these days, shows up here in some surprising runs of piano fills and exhortations), Mercer is stalking the heath of manhood's ruination. He turns over artifacts of Romanticism like an anthropologist on a dig, sketching out the landscape and puzzling over how these dick-swinging ancients survived. His yowls are the cry of somebody waking up from history with a hangover-- ""he was what the Poor call the Maimed,"" he sings-- as its dreams disperse over the horizon of legibility. I don't mean to make Mercer sound like a nostalgist. His voice is nothing if not urgently present, struggling to pull his warring selves into some workable here and now. He invokes patriarchs just to dispose of them, from the ""Roman ambassador"" who is ""torn apart by plaster and reassembled after"" in the opener, ""Idle Songs,"" to the ""druken and besotted father figure"" who's pushed out to sea on an ice floe in ""Evil Energy, the Ill Twin of..."" They stand between Mercer and a longed-for future in which the masculine spirit somehow gets sane and whole. Meanwhile, touchingly, that bad dad out on the ice ""trembles and he trembles and he puts his heart on tremble."" Mercer breaks from the crank-prophet line in that he wants to defeat his solipsism, to hack his way out of the thicket of male ghosts and build relationships-- with nature, lovers, family, his band and the listener. This album is peppered with references to himself as singer, from the epic second track ""Caravan Breakers, They Prey on the Weak and the Old"" (""I bet you are sick of hearing songs about the trail"") to the entrancing near-closer ""Bushels"", which assures ""there's a colony in song"" and ends on the simple statement, ""I was a singer and I sang in your home."" In between comes ""The Policy Merchant, the Silver Bay"", an acoustic, falsetto-sung ballad in which he teases, ""Mercer is a merchant, a policy merchant/ He calls himself urgent!/ He gathers all of the urchins up in their tearaways/ He gathers them into his palm and then he sings 'Another Day.'"" These wry acknowledgments feel especially gracious from a singer who is so under siege by sound and by the unending, unpredictable demands of all the voices of past and future birthing and dying in his gullet. But that's what Frog Eyes achieves here, not just in the songwriting but in the band's new dynamic range and precision-- for the first time, there's space in their hermetic universe for the rest of us. It's graduation day.","More namechecked than heard, Carey Mercer, Spencer Krug, and the rest of this B.C. band follow a series of small-scale studies with one of their best full-lengths to date.

The Trick,PANTHERS,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04513d197565213a42d/1:1/w_160/dae9c945.jpg,2007-05-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10168-the-trick/,Vice,"Panthers' career has been a case of two steps forward, one step back. The Brooklyn proto-punk band began their public life with Are You Down??, an album of polemical art-skronk so joyless, so overcooked, and so hell-bent on fingerbanging the boneheaded revolutionary specter of MC5 that it was essentially unlistenable. The album was plastered with more bumper-sticker rhetoric than a Whole Foods employee's Volvo, and while it most of it rang hollow, the bit about Panthers wanting to destroy art seemed on the money. If it were the only album they'd ever released, a sort of musical slash-and-burn, you'd have to give them credit for walking the walk. But it wasn't, and Panthers 2.0 retraced their steps through rock history to figure out exactly where they'd lost the plot on the debut. The result of these bug patches was an EP called Let's Get Serious, and, well, it did and it didn't-- Panthers got serious about monster riffs and coherent song structures, but toned down the overbearing gravity of the lyrics. They were still throwing stones, but it suited them better in this hard-charging rock powerhouse than their former art-damaged glasshouse. Things Are Strange, like Let's Get Serious, found Panthers just as learned in the sweet science of riffology as in post-structuralism and Hegelian dialectics. Only problem was the trend toward tuneless, tensionless epics that reminded us in no uncertain terms that Panthers were a very serious band. Two steps forward, one step back. If Panthers stay together until 2050 or so, they might wind up becoming the greatest band in the world. But this is 2007, and Panthers are still improving by gradual degrees. On their latest LP, they've made another vital step toward shedding their excesses-- quite literally. Where Things are Strange lost steam whenever it meandered away from its blistering grooves, The Trick sticks to the beaten path: Panthers saddle up bucking bronco riffs and ride the hell out of them for a minute or three, no detours. It's a rock qua rock record, with all the circular reasoning that entails: It rocks because it rocks; rocking is worth doing because rocking rocks; ad infinitum. And like anything with a value defined mostly by tautology, it has the potential to seem tedious, even vacuous, to any but the truest believers. For all the raw power of The Trick's riffs and the better-than-usual efficacy of Jayson Green's slightly aloof sneer, it's a slow starter. ""Goblin City"" promises excitement as its fuzz-bomb chords crash in over stony snares, but for an ostensive rave-up, it's a little too lean; a sizzling fuse that never quite explodes. ""Listen to Me"", with its cock-out guitar cascades and strangulated chorus, would be more sympathetic if Big Business wasn't doing the same thing, but with a sense of humor. The title track simply plods. But about halfway through the album, a shift occurs-- Panthers abandon moody micro-epics and really start to cook. ""Long Time Coming"" sizzles; overdriven surf-guitar peals bend into a syncopated stomp with the muscle-bound percussion. ""Panther Moderns"" actually establishes some drama with its hazy distortion overture, drama that comes to fruition in the snarled guitar lead that leaps out with Green's confident vocal turn. And ""Uncertainly"" burns down and rebuilds thrillingly for two intense, time-lapsed minutes. Hopefully, on their next effort, Panthers will focus in tighter on the searing energy that they wear better than heavy atmosphere. If the current trend continues, they'll will, but they'll also do something else to undercut it.

Glitter Glamour Atrocity,White Hills,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0425e6ef95969321f40/1:1/w_160/df6b6378.jpg,2007-05-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10166-glitter-glamour-atrocity/,Fuck Off & Di,"Ah, the great meditative bait-and-switch. The sampled instructor's voice on ""Air Waves (Intro)"" promises ""pure consciousness,"" but after the ensuing track full of simmering bass drone, all you get from ""Under Skin or By Name"" is a hammer to the face with ""HAWKWIND"" scratched somewhere on the wooden handle. White Hills have a few tricks up their sleeves, but even if they didn't, they manage to take the judicious wah-wah and space noises from Lemmy's old, infamous, severely underappreciated band without forgetting the role rhythm played in it. Note how long it takes to get to the rock, though, and how quickly it recedes. By ""Under Skin or By Name"", it's apparent what the band wants to do, but it's only at the record's end where it puts together everything it can do. Glitter Glamour Atrocity is far more carefully and deliberately paced than any listener would assume from its scuzz-rock title and cover, and the moments of ambience and calm might just outnumber the stretches of full-on freak-out. ""Air Waves"" isn't exactly spitting in your mouth, featuring a stiff, tasteful rhythm and an almost jangly guitar line; the tribal groove of ""Spirit of Exile""-- the album's most accessible moment-- simmers gorgeously without ever bubbling over. And, after four minutes of palette-cleansing hum with ""Distance"", comes an acoustic-led instrumental. It's almost an entirely different band that comes in with the brick-heavy psychedelia of ""Love Serve Remember"", but the transitions feel natural. It's during that track's politically dour death march (""never question these words I say"", they chant) where the band really begins to stretch out, as the guitars recede for a woman singing ghostly lullaby and a recorded-- and heavily edited-- speech from George W. Bush, devilishly rearranged to have him label himself a terrorist and a threat, showing more culpability in this re-constituted address than in his entire presidency. Then, a guitar solo."" In fact, White Hills don't really let it all out until the near 14-minute closer and title track, when they finally throw everything they have at the wall-- the riffs, the solos, the pedals, the pre-recorded proselytizing-- and it sticks like projectile puke. GGA doesn't tease, necessarily, it's just overwhelmingly patient. It's a tribute to heroes, it's a modern twist, it has a current of political unrest, but above all that it knows when to hold back. This is an honest-to-god-album, with peaks and valleys, crests and chill-out sections-- hell, ""Glitter Glamour Atrocity"" alone has all that. You might take only one or two songs away at first blush (probably ""Spirit of Exile"" or the title track), but it's a consistently engaging listen from end to end.","Moments of Hawkwind-like freak out and deliberately paced ambience sit alongside one another but rarely mix on this NYC band's consistently engaging debut album.

Vision Swim,Growing,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b049c0084474cd0c1c01/1:1/w_160/f2fbe465.jpg,2007-05-02 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10172-vision-swim/,Troubleman UnlimitedMegablade,"Laptop composers often reference the arc of the symphonic music, with clear beginnings, middles, and ends. Bands like Growing-- who favor guitars and pedals and analog machines and leave a tail of patch cords dragging behind them as they move from town-to-town-- seem like they're always tinkering, listening to each other, and deciding in the moment what comes next. This analog-based live approach can lead, oddly enough, to heavy use of repetition. Sometimes Growing stay with a certain effect, holding it and letting it spin in place until they figure out where they're going to go next. Such repetition is key to their latest album Vision Swim, as is the sense of in-the-moment discovery. Here Growing often seem like they're tending a sound garden more than composing. ""Morning Drive"" begins with a throb of acidic feedback drone that never lets up, giving the tune the 4/4 pulse of mid-tempo techno. And when guitar sounds gradually come in, they're unstable notes flying all over the place, circling and tearing off like flies trying to dodge the tail of an angry cow. Whether or not it was all planned out in advance, the track sounds like something created by listening as much as playing, as if bassist Kevin Doria and guitarist Joe Denardo didn't know themselves exactly where it was going and after eleven minutes just decided to wind it down. This looseness gives ""Morning Drive"" a nice sense of unpredictability, its emotional ambiguity and zig-zag direction helping to reinforce repeat plays. Vision Swim makes clear that Growing are at their best when their music has these frayed edges. The pure drone of 2004's* Soul of The Rainbow And The Harmony Of Light* on Kranky, for example, was solid but had nowhere near this amount of personality; a more restless music, away form the quest for the perfect harmonic sequence, is where Growing's strengths lie. Sometimes, as on the 15-minute ""On Anon"", the various guitar delays, crunching distortion and squiggly notes assemble into a torrent of sound that's loud and frightening with a molten core of beauty that even a kindergartener could appreciate. Here they approach the sublime tension perfected by Black Dice on ""Endless Happiness"", where they manage to be simultaneously both fuck-you obnoxious and warmly ingratiating. Nothing else on Vision Swim quite approaches the knockout power of ""On Anon"" but all of it is at least pretty good. ""Emseepee"" also creates a bedrock bass rhythm off which playful bits of distortion pivot, ""Lightfoot"" turns white guitar noise into a wave pool, pushing forward with discrete surges of feedback. I haven't heard quite enough Growing to call this their best record, but it sounds to me like they're thinking hard about what goes where and why, finding new ways to get the most out of their varied sound palette.","The spirits of repetition and improvisation color the latest from this guitar, pedal, and analog machine-loving symphonic band.

The First Original Silence,Original Silence,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02b5e6ef95969321f17/1:1/w_160/5bb541ea.jpg,2007-05-02 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10145-the-first-original-silence/,Smalltown Superjazz,"Those inclined toward improvised music can usually find something worthwhile in all forms of it. But even the most blindly faithful recognize when a session shoots so high that it sounds more like a rocket than a record. The First Original Silence is that kind of instant attention-grabber. Original Silence use the same tools as many improv groups: rolling percussion, squawking horns, guitar feedback, and scraggly electronic noise. But these six sound-crushers have added some sort of performance-enhancing drug, injecting their sound with energy rare to any music, improvised or otherwise. That shouldn't be a surprise given the pedigree of the participants. High-level improv is routine for sax player Mats Gustafsson and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love (both from free jazz dynamo the Thing), guitarist Terrie Ex of the Ex, bassist Massimo Pupillo of Zu, and guitarist Thurston Moore and Jim O'Rourke (on electronics here) of whatever it is they do. But improv history is littered with mediocre records made by well-heeled musicians unable to get out of each other's way. Original Silence avoid such pitfalls by committing to improv-rock, the kind that actually sounds like experimental rock music rather than just rock musicians noodling. This is due mostly to the heavy gravitational force of Nilssen-Love and Pupillo, whose metallic rhythms swing between structure and freedom. The closest parallel to their bombastic stomp is the hammering lurch of Norwegian trio Noxagt; in fact, much of The First Original Silence sounds like Noxagt gone free-jazz, an enticing prospect to be sure. Recorded during a 2005 tour of Italy, the album gets off to a ferocious start, grafting Minutemen-like bounce to Gustafsson's guttural horn playing. ""If Light Has No Age, Time Has No Shadow"" continues to hurtle forward from there, remaining insistent and vigorous through 15 minutes of tonal changes. Most impressive is how the musicians never step on each other; their fluid exchange of sonic positions almost feels conducted. When Pupillo backs down, Moore or Ex fills in with cutting string-work, only to slip underneath O'Rourke's squiggly slashes, which in turn make way for Gustafsson's full-body bellows. The 45-minute closer ""In the Name of the Law"" is understandably not as high-speed. It does have stretches of mass hysteria, especially a crazed section starting around eight minutes in, where a nearly-4/4 beat, wailing guitar noise, and Gustafsson's Albert Ayler-esque squalls evoke the Stooges' ""L.A. Blues"". But even the most placid moments crackle. Stretches of electronic whirr, minimal guitar clang (reminiscent of Evol-era Sonic Youth), and thick atmosphere all emit an electric charge. Even the final 15 minutes, a nearly rhythm-less denouement, has enough plot points to keep you turning the sonic pages. Long improv tracks have become such a cliché that they often seem doomed to fail. But Original Silence attacks these two epics like sprints instead of marathons, and The First Original Silence proves you don't have to stop playing to catch your breath.","Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, Mats Gustafsson, Terrie Ex of the Ex and others avoid the common pitfalls of improv-rock by emphasizing the ""rock"" rather than the ""improv.""

"The Singles, Volume Two: 1960-1963",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03a9d034d5c69bf4839/1:1/w_160/40cfc38e.jpg,2007-05-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10159-the-singles-volume-two-1960-1963/,Hip-O Select,"In the early 1960s, James Brown was a hustler. As his nickname suggested, he worked unbelievably hard, touring 300 days a year and playing as many as five shows a day. Hustlers have to be flexible, and Brown treated his records as advertisements for his live gigs; it was in his interest to get across the idea that whatever kind of thing the audience wanted to hear would probably be part of his show. Of the 20 singles (two unreleased at the time) whose A- and B-sides are collected on this volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only exercise in blessed completism, 13 were chart hits, and it's still easy not to have heard most of them, wedged as they are between the roaring soul of his early years and the funk he'd invent a few years later-- only ""Night Train"" appears on his 20 All-Time Greatest Hits. Beyond that half-instrumental cover of a 1952 Jimmy Forrest r&b hit, they include three 30s-era pop songs, one of them recorded with an orchestra and a choir; a raw, frantic ripoff of the Isley Brothers' ""Shout""; a trio of delicately balanced original ballads with Brown's voice slicing across their grain; covers of country hits by Kay Starr (faithful-ish) and Cowboy Copas (unrecognizable); a mashed-potatoes riff offhandedly overdubbed with JB yelping his tour itinerary; a 10-year-old R&B tune that had recently been a hit for Gladys Knight, recast as an organ instrumental; and a two-part secularized version of the gospel tune ""Mary Don't You Weep"". That's an enormous variety of stuff-- even more enormous, if you count B-sides and non-hits like the incredible rock'n'roll freakout ""I've Got Money"" and the scenery-chewing blues ""The Bells""-- and it also encompasses a lot of covers. (Some are unacknowledged, like the instrumental ""Night Flying"", a not-fooling-anybody variation on Bill Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"".) Brown's discography in these years was shaped by his ongoing tussles with King Records, which had moved him up from the less-promoted Federal imprint but encouraged him to cover songs from its publishing catalogue. By 1963, when Live at the Apollo was the hottest album in r&b and Brown was selling out venues across the country, he was practically on strike against King, and they were pumping out whatever ballast happened to be in the archives. Fortunately, most of the ballast was still pretty juicy. Brown's band in this period was one of his best: The rubber-band note-snaps of guitarist Les Buie, and the New Orleans second-line-inspired clatter of drummer Clayton Fillyau (or Fillyua; he's identified both ways in the extensive liner notes), gave the group its toughest attack yet. And Brown's voice was as monstrously strong and supple as it ever got. Mr. Dynamite hadn't figured out how he was going to change the world yet, but he knew he had to get everyone's attention first.","Second volume of the Godfather of Soul's A- and B-sides features one of his best backing bands and an incredibly diverse array of sounds and song styles.

Revenge!,Robbie Fulks,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b028ea9e61561daa659b/1:1/w_160/d9874952.jpg,2007-05-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10143-revenge/,Yep Roc,"On ""We're on the Road"", the song/skit that introduces his first live album, Revenge!, Robbie Fulks puts forth an outdated and ungenerous view of the long-running tension between artists and record labels. He stages a fictional cellphone call with Yep Roc prez Glenn Dicker, who informs Fulks that the label needs a new product from which to wring dirty filthy record-label lucre. It's a joke, of course-- and who knows? Dicker may even be in on it-- but not a very good one. Yep Roc in particular has never seemed in it for the money-- the label is home to seasoned cult artists like Robyn Hitchcock, John Doe, and Paul Weller as well as to future cult artists like Rock Plaza Central. Yep Roc even gave Fulks a home, and he's not exactly generating Arcade Fire-sized buzz anymore. The label=bad, artist=good worldview, besides being a little too pat, peaked at approximately the same time as Fulks' brand of smart-ass, backwards-looking alt-country-- somewhere around 1998. Now, in 2007, there's a throwback quality to his throwback music: he was looking back to what he perceived as a better country-music era, and on Revenge! he's looking back to when that sort of nostalgia had more cultural weight and commercial potential than it does now. You'd almost expect to see swing dancing at his shows. Equitably representing each of Fulks' albums and peppered with new songs and a few covers, the 2xCD Revenge! features an electric set on disc 1 and an acoustic set on disc 2. Electric is his more natural setting, not just because his backing band is better, but because the tone of that show compensates for his weak vocals. At its best, the first disc reveals the breadth and strength of Fulks' songwriting: ""You Shouldn't Have"" and ""Fixin' to Fall"" hew closely and sometimes cleverly to knee-slappin' country wordplay (example: ""Thanks a lot for wreckin' my heart... You shouldn't have""), and ""Mad at a Girl"" is unabashed power pop in the Rhett Miller vein. On the other hand, songs like ""Rock Bottom, Pop. 1"" and ""The Buck Starts Here"" seem too clever by half, riding a concept for a couple verses too long. Fulks comes across as a needy performer. Entering the stage to audience chants of ""Robbie! Robbie!"", he actually joins in with them, then later asks, ""Was that good enough?"", with just enough irony that it's not too transparent. Throughout the set, he shouts and cajoles his audience like he's Sam Kinison: ""Smoke 'em if ya got 'em, motherfucker!"" he screams by way of introducing ""Cigarette State"". His demeanor quickly becomes off-putting and creates a strange mood in the set, but all's forgotten when he strikes the first chords of the chugging ""Let's Kill Saturday Night"", the title track from his ill-fated 1998 major-label debut. More so than its studio counterpart, this live version sounds rocket-powered, as Fulks vents small-town, working-class disappointments that barely disguise his own career frustrations. For once the stakes sound dire. The acoustic set replaces that needy persona with a slyer, more self-impressed version of ""Robbie Fulks,"" one prone to in-joke exchanges with his band as well as tongue-in-cheek musical passages. It's as much a stand-up routine as a concert, which might be entertaining and personable with the right performer (see Tom Waits' Nighthawks at the Diner), but it severely leaches songs like ""In Bristol Town One Bright Day"", ""Bluebirds Are Singing for Me"", and an otherwise adequate cover of the Carter Family's ""Away Out on the Old Saint Sabbath"" of any gravity. It doesn't help that Fulks performs a silly, vocoder-assisted cover of Cher's ""Believe"" that's just a waste of time. Ironic covers of pop songs... how novel! Without the energy of the electric set, the acoustic set can only highlight Fulks' weaknesses as a performer. He may be a talented songwriter capable of witty wordplay and studied mimicry, but his pencil-thin voice sounds sarcastic and self-aware even when he's serious, to the extent that he almost always seems to be satirizing the old country music he professes to love. Revenge! suggests that he loves the applause and attention too much to surrender the stage or even rethink his approach. Maybe that's his own way of keeping it real, but is anyone asking him to sell out anymore?","Live album finds the alt-country singer/songwriter poking fun at showbiz tropes with generally dire results.

""I know all whales can sing"" is not the most profound opening line, but the quick, rough rhythm sets an appropriate tone for an album is chock-full of rhythmic lullabies that hint at folk standards, 1960s pop icons, and the topical colorings of indie rock. The album's first single, ""The Sleepless"", makes a seamless transition from the opener. It curls around the ear with the soothing homemade guitar strums last heard on the Shout Out Louds' Howl Howl Gaff Gaff. A sweet, diffident electric guitar and a kick drum build the structure of the song around soft, simple flashes of pulse and silence. The melody is familiar chords in a hop-skip decent; the chorus is a metallic clash of ardent relationship analysis. ""Let's try it out now/ Breathe it in now/ And all we have is now."" It's certainly no bucket of cold water, as lyrics go, but Nick Delffs (also of Castanets) contemplates a fine balance, meandering between bliss and its opposite in a slice of pleasing, sunny rock. The band lists its first two influences on MySpace as ""weather, the Beatles,"" and such candid sensitivity is completely obvious in its music. If the familiarity of ""We Will Rise"" approaches ubiquity, it's only because the Shaky Hands harness a sound that's been omnipresent for the past five years, permeating, if not always originating in, Portland and Seattle. The band's instrumental formula here combines minimal but clean fireside production with guitar, violin, the softest of percussion, and vocals that never overpower, instead relinquishing their grip to clarity of message. Sometimes that message is supposed to be unintelligible, emotive squirming, as on ""I'm Alive"". Foot taps make their entrance on this track, where Delffs quietly warbles for a long stretch of verse before another heavy, messy chorus makes its mark-- then the song is over. Such is the structure of the album, songs as short as pop songs, lackadaisically perky and energetically sulky. ""Another World, Pt. 1"" appears halfway through the album, an interlude of feathery cymbals, lazy string pulls, and ponderous guitar strums: an indie orchestra tuning up. What bolsters the second half of the album is a more energetic turn to rock: Instead of splicing brief tracks with soft/hard alternations, ""Host Your Day"" has a more powerful bass line, a grating, minor-key guitar riff in one corner, a vigorous chorus that remains in the same creeping key, and ""la la la"" backup vocals. The pleasure of unaffected production means that ""Whirling Wind"" has a clean, organic, live flavor: guitar and vocals are coated in a hum of flutes and strings drawn out over the entire song. ""Hold It Up"", a doomsday, howling rush-through, hints at the built-up, near-anthemic structures of bands with bigger sounds. The material may not be breathtaking, but it's often invigorating, proving why this uncluttered, posture-free scene is more a scene than a fad.","Portland quintet's gleefully pensive debut upholds the down-home indie aesthetic-- playful melodies and unadorned production-- of bands like the Unicorns.

Ben + Vesper's jangly weave of guitar, accordion, organ, piano, and drums might be richer and bigger than their acoustic guitar-and-campfire predecessors, but these are songs for everyperson, tough, frank, and, miraculously, never the least bit precious. Occasionally, Ben + Vesper's doting coos and warm freak-folk(ish) pop can prove reminiscent of other (equally whimsical) boy-girl outfits-- the Handsome Family and Ida, in particular-- but All This Could Kill You (which follows a seven-song EP, More Questions, released earlier this year) is boosted into distinction by Danielson/Danielson Famile mastermind Daniel Smith's rich, cuddly production: All 13 songs here are impeccably recorded, tender, balanced, and gorgeously organic. Smith's label, Sounds Familyre, is releasing the record, and elsewhere on the album, Smith's fingerprints are equally indelible: All This was recorded in Smith's studio (the New Jerusalem Recreation Room, deep in Smith and the Ben + Vesper's home state of New Jersey), and incorporates the contributions of plenty of Smith's pals and former collaborators, including Famile member Elin (also Smith's wife) on backing vocals, Famile member David (also Smith's brother) on drums, and longtime Famile accomplice Sufjan Stevens, who offers up banjo, recorder, piano, oboe, percussion, and backing vocals. Likewise, Ben's big brother and childhood friend-- Josh Stamper and Chris Weisman, respectively-- add arrangements and man various noisemakers, from guitar to marimba. All that friend-and-family closeness leads to songs that feel especially easy, which each musical piece slipping into simple, hand-holding harmony. While the record's melodies are, for the most part, uniformly sweet and memorable, Ben's big, booming vocals (offset, naturally, by Vesper's breathy murmur) provide a welcome shot of weird: on opener ""Door to Door"", Ben bellows ""They will reach out and hold on to you/ Go on, introduce yourself or they will do it for you""-- and while he may be speaking about any number of benign things, the line turns more dark and sinister with each deep, baritone rumble, the kind of warning you're sure to heed. ""Rockaway Twp."" is a sharp acoustic/accordian throwdown (that half-sounds as if it could have been plucked from the new Vetiver record), a rare piece of beauty culled from a town better known for its strip malls (that ends, appropriately, with the caveat ""I wanna live in the country""). All This Could Kill You is packed with grim observations and impressive sonic flourishes-- enough to make you wish you had more talented friends.","Danielson's Daniel Smith handles production duties and Sufjan Stevens guests on this husband-and-wife team's debut LP, which is rooted in the profound minutiae of life with children.

(Honestly, you'd think we'd be onto the guy's shtick by now.) As with Tarantino's previous soundtracks, Death Proof skids across decades, countries, and cultures like Kurt Russell's Grindhouse deathmobile, taking in Italian B-movie soundtracks (the queasy ebbing and flowing flute and strings of Ennio Morricone's ""Paranoia Prima""), American pop-soul (the Coasters' noirish doowop ""Down in Mexico""), and British glam (the fuzzed-out boogie bop of T.Rex's ""Jeepster""). Taraninto treats his soundtracks like he treats his films, as if the invention of the VCR abolished the space-time continuum and suddenly all genres, decades, and countries existed at once within one parallel Hollywood universe. But with Tarantino's pop song sound markers becoming iconic in their own right-- I'm pretty sick of seeing Michael Madsen hacking off that cop's ear every time I turn on the oldies station-- the guy obviously knows a thing or two about picking a memorable song to match a memorable image. Despite the years that separate them, most of Death Proof's tunes do sound like they could have been plucked from three decades of double features at the drive-in, even if April March's ""Chick Habit"" really sounds like interstitial music from the Powerpuff Girls. Hell, Jack Nitzsche's ""The Last Race"" and Eddie Beram's ""Riot in Thunder Alley""-- a deliciously schlocky combo of fuzz bass, cheesy new-for-1967 sitar, and cod-Latin drumming that will have you instantly imagining teenage rabble cruising down two-lane blacktop to a middle-aged man's idea of rock'n'roll menace-- were already B-movie standards before being repurposed by Tarantino. And like all of Tarantino's soundtracks, Death Proof comes with dialogue from the film that wears itself out before the first play through, though thankfully these snippets are much easier to get rid of in the age of iPods than they were with the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. (Unless you were one of those people who actually figured out how to program a CD player.) So Quentin once again collects a pretty killer clutch of semi-familiar and downright unknown pre-80s pop, rock, and soul; he probably made some awesome mixtapes for his friends before he was famous, too. But Death Proof raises the same old unfortunate parallel between Tarantino's big-budget exploitation flicks that quote the history of low-budget cinema and his major label soundtracks that repackage golden oldies and thrift-store obscurities now for iTunes. Tarantino spent $53 million and three years to recreate a B-movie era where directors were lucky to get $53,000 to crank out a whole flick over a three-day weekend. Likewise, you can spend $19.99 on Death Proof at Best Buy or dig up a .99 copy of that Joe Tex album at your local Salvation Army. It might sound even better on vinyl, in much the same way that the movies Tarantino pays homage to with Grindhouse are more fun when you catch them on late-night TV than they are when they're lovingly restored by the AFI and turned art-house respectable.","The latest Quentin Tarantino soundtrack skids across decades, countries, and cultures, taking in Italian B-movie soundtracks, American pop-soul, and British glam.
